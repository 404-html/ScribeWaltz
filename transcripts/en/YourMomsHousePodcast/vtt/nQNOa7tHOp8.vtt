39
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.380
The thing with hyenas,
and I didn't say this before,
there's two shows,

40
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.740
7:00 PM and an 8:30 PM one is in the plan.
Oh,

room and then one is in the regular room,
the Dallas.

42
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.540
It's like,
it makes no sense,

43
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:08.710
but now there's a 7:00 PM and the planet and then eight 30 whatever.

room and then one's in Dallas Room.

49
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:28.570
It's that makes sense then it makes no sense.

50
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.160
Makes no sense.
But a,

I don't know.

69
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.120
How come you put your whole fucking head up your ass hole?

70
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.360
How come you can't have both way out of it?

71
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.300
Why don't you put both thumbs in your,

72
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.900
your Cujo and pull them apart and then show us,
sent us a picture of that.

73
00:04:50.901 --> 00:04:54.410
We'll put her on the show.
That's our answer to your question about that.

74
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.010
They'll show us the inside of the hole.
I know,

75
00:05:01.011 --> 00:05:05.830
I can hear the tears coming.
Can't you timed it?
15 minutes.

76
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.130
I mean 15 minutes as well.
Here's the thing,

77
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.860
an hour program on television or if you listen to radio,

78
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.070
but they have way more Joe.

79
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.240
And he did it to a just today and he did a three hour show and he's like,

80
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.060
this is not as good and you're not Joe.

81
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.010
And he didn't know he only did two ads.
Why come?

82
00:05:29.011 --> 00:05:32.730
Why come you don't do like he do?
Well,

83
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.810
why don't you bite the end of your dad's Dick off and then,
uh,

84
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.000
like smear the blood all over your face.

85
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.790
Make a video and then we'll play it on the show.

86
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.480
Wanting to answer coming your dad's boss.

88
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.950

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.020

He didn't change your diaper.

90
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.310

I don't even want to hear him.
I don't understand how fast forward works.

91
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.280
Scroll,

94
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.700

Mine's on.

95
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.240

96
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:30.560

I couldn't have made that sound.
All right.
God dammit.

97
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.480
Oh,
it's you.
I don't know.
Of course it's you.
It's not me.
I want an airplane.

98
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.270
Let's start the show.
I'm so excited.

99
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.420
<v 3>You know why you don't fuck your friends?
I'll tell you why.</v>

100
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.670
<v 2>I tell you,
boy,</v>

101
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.410
<v 3>you find them hideous.</v>

102
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.580
That's why you don't fuck your friends.

103
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:50.623
<v 2>Okay?</v>

104
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.450
<v 0>Don't bring in one loving to this.</v>

105
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.470
Well,
go to your mom's house,

106
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.020
Christina visits.

107
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.433
Yeah,

108
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.970
<v 2>I tried something new with the sound earlier.</v>

109
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.470
I was told that if I did this quarter inch to eighth inch line and set up,

110
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.980
it would be better and it didn't sound as good.
So I went back to the old setup.

111
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.550
We also don't have the habits of the new board yet either.
Oh,

112
00:07:58.551 --> 00:08:01.700
should we got an old barn?
Oh,
I see it right there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,

113
00:08:01.701 --> 00:08:06.140
why don't we hold it for the new studio?
I mean,
why bother setting it up here?

114
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:09.060
We're just going to move in like three weeks.
What if this,
this is a p this is,

115
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.340
I don't trust this thing anymore.

116
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.600
I wanted to burp and then there was barf under it and I didn't,

117
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:19.140
I don't trust this anymore.
Why is that?
What failed us?
Yeah,
that's the,
Oh,

118
00:08:19.141 --> 00:08:23.180
the cable did the cable did we got a new cable in there,
but it's not.
Yeah,

119
00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.100
but the board is,
but well,

120
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.730
it's a cable that came with the board and this board is kind of Dog Shit,
Huh?

121
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:32.900
Yeah.
Then I guess we got to set that shit up.
I need an engineer to come over.

122
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.760
Yeah,
I'd like that too.
Yeah,
that'd be great guys.
We're so stoked.

123
00:08:37.761 --> 00:08:39.880
We were going to move into a new place.
Yeah.

124
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.820
We're going to have fucking dope ass studio and it's a little while here.

125
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.620
Way better than we are.
Way Better.

126
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.920
It's much more advanced than what you guys are going to shit when you see it.

127
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.070
Yeah.
No.
See that's the kind of Burp I thought I was going to have.
Yeah.

128
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.490
And then there was too much vomit under it and I didn't want to push it.
Yeah,

129
00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:02.790
sure.
You want to keep that couch in that room in the the room.
Why?

130
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:07.740
Because you can't put like,
you can't like kicky foot up.
Did that couch,

131
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.630
just so you know the sound studio we're getting.
Yeah.
It's a real studio.
The Guy,

132
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.140

the guy who owns it owned.
Is it?
He's a composer.

133
00:09:16.141 --> 00:09:19.470
Composer and he scored movies and famous people.

134
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:23.730
He told us Michael Mann said on the couch.

How horrible would that be?

He's a right cut a fire.

139
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.460
Yeah.
So every ball is a right can't,

140
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:48.060
but that couch has like stories to it.
Right.
And ice cube farted on that couch.

141
00:09:48.061 --> 00:09:50.210
Yeah,
you're right.
It's got the wrap or foreign.

142
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.650
It's a weird stain on one side of it.
Did you see it?
Yeah,
there's a weird stain.

143
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.410
What color?
It's just like a,

144
00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.490
it looks like it has some type of water damage or something on the left arm.

145
00:09:59.491 --> 00:10:02.700
Right.
So you're telling me you don't want the couch?
Well,
not because of that.

146
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:06.660
I was just thinking of being able to relax.
You know,
it's a relax room.
Oh,

147
00:10:06.661 --> 00:10:09.330
you want to go in there and dad down?
Well,
I thought we would,

148
00:10:09.331 --> 00:10:11.430
we could watch movies in there also.
Like,

149
00:10:11.431 --> 00:10:13.800
do you want that to be the movie watching couch?
Well,

150
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:17.970
here's a good point that our real estate lady said is that that couch fits in

151
00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:21.570
there and you know that it fits there.
That's true versus the unknown.

152
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.410
But here's what we can do.
The day of moving.
We bring our shit there.
Yeah.

153
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.670
And we test it out.
And if we don't like it,
that company that we use,

154
00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:34.140
they take away to stuff you don't want.
Yeah.
So like no harm.
Okay.

155
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.410
No harm.
No fart.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
I was going to say it the same.
Yeah,

156
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.940
I know you and I are like,

157
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:44.820
<v 3>you know why you don't fuck your friends?
I'll tell you why.</v>

158
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.730
I'll tell you why you find them hideous.

159
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:49.913
<v 4>Okay.</v>

160
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.920
<v 3>That's why you don't fuck your friends.</v>

161
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.390
<v 2>It seems like he really has thought about this.
It's smart.
You know I love her,</v>

162
00:10:57.391 --> 00:11:00.420
but you know what?
She hasn't thought about getting a haircut,

163
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.230
a haircut and a proper support Bra.
Oh,

164
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.510
cause you can see her tits are not harnessed in,
yeah.

165
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:11.340
Maybe the whole new shirt [inaudible] magical.
It's again and off.

166
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.130
Yeah.
There's like,
I don't know.
It looks like it's been,

167
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.600
it's like that spray paint style,
you know,
like a mall.
Yeah.

168
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.900
Like a mall made shirt and there's stars and shit.
Nah,
I don't like it.

169
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:24.210
But her tits are real sloppy and they're moving around.

170
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.100
Let's see what she has to say.
I think she might have more to say.
Oh yeah.

171
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:29.050
<v 3>Lie to them and say,</v>

172
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.540
well,
my family,
you move.

173
00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:35.853
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

174
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:37.840
<v 3>Why don't you fuck me?</v>

175
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.030
<v 2>Do you think that the thing is that she's desperate?</v>

176
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.350
Like is she making this because she's not getting laid?
Yeah.
It's kind of angry.

177
00:11:45.351 --> 00:11:48.320
Right?
She's on the receiving end of that fight.
Just like,
why don't you fuck me?

178
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:52.610
That's really the agenda here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What'd you fucker fucker?
No,

179
00:11:52.611 --> 00:11:56.590
I'm being don't,
don't just why not?
Of course.

180
00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:59.560
Cause like she said she's hideous.
What if it's her?

181
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.520
I'm giving you permission.
Yeah.
You have to fuck her.
No,

182
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.680
I got it.
No.
And anybody else?

183
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.020
Do you have any other suggestions for fucking are Guatemalan Nanny Bay?

184
00:12:14.021 --> 00:12:16.960
What is wrong with you?
That's the whole point.
It's a hard one.
It's a,

185
00:12:16.961 --> 00:12:20.720
would you rather,
it's the essence of it.
So fucking horrible.
Horrible.

186
00:12:20.721 --> 00:12:24.650
It's supposed to be black hoodie.
A bank.
She's like,

187
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.670
look at her like a grandmother.
I know.
That's the point.
Which I couldn't,

188
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:34.350
I couldn't,
I'd take this animal to doing these videos.
Animal.

189
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.590
That's such a dad old dad thing.
This animal.
Well she is,

190
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:42.310
my dad says this fucker animal.
That's what I,

191
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:45.623
<v 3>yeah.</v>

192
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.140
Friendly relationships with people.
Look,
you're two adults.

193
00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.280
You're not related by blood.

194
00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:07.350
<v 2>It sounds like somebody is not returning her advances.
What she's doing.</v>

195
00:13:07.351 --> 00:13:10.460
What happened?
Here's what can I tell you?
My theory on this woman,
she has a,

196
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.710
a friend,
she's attracted to attract a friend.

197
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.660
This is all her inner thoughts coming out that she's never,

198
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:22.740
she's wanting to tell this one friend who she's been dying to fuck.
Yeah.

199
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.380
And for her it's like this makes sense.

200
00:13:25.381 --> 00:13:29.790
Like the logic is there for her and that's why she's spewing this out.

201
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.090
But that friend doesn't want to Fucker,
you know,
at all.

202
00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:38.270
Like there's not even any reciprocation.
It's such an easy fix.
I think.

203
00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:43.260
Just a little bit of makeup for this lady at a support Bra.
Yeah.

204
00:13:43.261 --> 00:13:46.730
Maybe some therapy.
Yeah.
Clearly.
Yeah.
You got to work.

205
00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.450
So he got some shit you got to work out.

206
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:53.220
Especially if you're posting this on Youtube.
Yeah.
It's real bad advertising.

207
00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:57.050
Yeah.
This is
real.
Like,
uh,

208
00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:00.340
like it's like a bad Facebook posts,
but worse,
cause it's,

209
00:14:00.341 --> 00:14:04.710
it's you actually on video saying things.
Imagine her,

210
00:14:04.711 --> 00:14:07.550
all of her friends that see this,
they're all like,
oh God.

211
00:14:07.551 --> 00:14:12.210
And he's saying it or whoever.
This is far.
Yeah.
I don't want to use pronouns.

212
00:14:12.211 --> 00:14:15.030
I don't want to assume.
Well if I were to guess pronouns,

213
00:14:15.031 --> 00:14:19.290
I think she's talking to her.
I don't think she's in the,
he's,

214
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.840
I don't think Zur is in the Sims,
if you know what I'm saying.

215
00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.513
Hey,

216
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.680
I'm wondering what's your Pronoun but this cute little thumb rings.

217
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.240
He's one of those dudes with summaries.
What?

218
00:14:40.241 --> 00:14:43.050
What's up Russ respects somebody.

219
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.850
Do you know that we've gotten some emails in the academic world.
Um,

220
00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.330
hold on.
Hi.
We're doing one wide shot today,
which is why we're like,

221
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.420
we got to say something.
Hi.
Hello.
This is how we're doing it today.

222
00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.480
We have no blue band of blue band is working on another project and this is to

223
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:05.960
kind of save time in post.
Hello.
Anyways,

224
00:15:05.961 --> 00:15:10.961
we've been getting these emails from act people in academia and now it's,

225
00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:12.860
it's becoming the norm.

226
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:18.760
Somebody signed off so you got like professor of the psychology department,

227
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.020
Pronouns,
Zim or he his whatever the fuck.

228
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.640
I think the craziest one.
I'm going to start doing that.
We saw him one,

229
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:31.400
it was like Roger and something and then it was like pronouns.

230
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.980
He him his,
yeah.
That's what I thought Robert.

231
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.560
That is typical of a cisgender.
It is,
by the way,
in some privileged,

232
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.940
I don't know if you've seen this,

233
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:45.890
but for a while now I haven't made any anything about it and I don't really get

234
00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:50.540
any attention for it,
but I've been very high.

235
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:55.510
This is my look at my,
uh,
this is my Twitter bio.
Oh,
I've seen this comedian

236
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.650
tweets from Tom signed fart.
I love it.
You know what?

237
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:07.080
They always do that for super famous people.
It's like tweet from Tom Cruiser,

238
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.820
sine t,
all the,

239
00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.430
all those like really famous people have like their team manages it,

240
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.910
but like if Barry Obama side,
it's like,
well those will be signed to be,
oh,

241
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.300
you know what I love is when people think you're famous enough to have someone

242
00:16:23.301 --> 00:16:26.140
managing your social media.
It gives me a thrill.
I know.

243
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.370
I don't know who manages your Twitter account.
I'm like,
gene,

244
00:16:28.371 --> 00:16:31.520
either do I get in touch with them?
Like I said,

245
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:35.810
on Facebook all the time ever really reads this.
The truth is,

246
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.160
I don't know,
because I hate Facebook emails.

247
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:44.810
So I checked them like once a month it'll full inbox.
I'll skip over them.

248
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:47.630
The worst,
the worst Facebook message,

249
00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:52.820
you got to see this and a link.
I go,
Nope,
I'm never gonna look at it.

250
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.890
Because for some reason the video never loads quickly like it.
It's like,
uh,

251
00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.090
I also don't want to take that chance.
What's the chance of,

252
00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:03.380
of like spending time seeing something I don't care about.

253
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.210
So if they describe something in a meet an amazing detail,

254
00:17:08.211 --> 00:17:11.260
but when it's just like,
this is hilarious,
don't care.
Yup.

255
00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:16.500
And nine times out of 10 it isn't,
it's not something I've been sent.
Okay.

256
00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.430
Jesus Christ is my n word.
We've been sent.
Oh my God.

257
00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:21.500
We get sent that daily to the show,

258
00:17:21.501 --> 00:17:25.310
to your mom's podcast@gmail.com and that's a fake thing.

259
00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:28.610
So we don't play that because we are aware.
It's stupid.

260
00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:32.390
But I'll tell you the people that send us videos,
big words to the show,

261
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.260
they're funny.
Yeah,
those are great.
A lot of good ones.

262
00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:40.310
Not like you're dumb friends.
You know.
The Shit.

263
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:44.090
What was I going to say?
I don't know.
You got to see more of this lady.

264
00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:49.380
<v 3>People pretend to care about like you know,</v>

265
00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.460
it's like these poor people who have down syndrome,
you know,
like,
like,

266
00:17:53.461 --> 00:17:56.540
like eat all,
they're put into this world and nobody's going to fuck with him.

267
00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.420
You might have people who are like high function,
it's not true.

268
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:04.950
And yet these people go,
oh I love these people,
I take care of them every day.

269
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.410
And I have a good friend who is,

270
00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.870
who's east high function you has down syndrome and I feel like saying um,

271
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.980
did you find them?
Did you bought them?
Did you,

272
00:18:14.981 --> 00:18:19.440
did you blow it?
Did the guy could probably really use a little below.

273
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.880
<v 2>Did you see a movie?
She's,
she's got a lot of dark.</v>

274
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.980
Let anger and see only cares about blowing down.

275
00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:32.940
By the way,
that's our biggest problem.
I was sent a link to,

276
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:38.220
I think the show's called born like this and I watched it.
I was,

277
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:42.500
I can't believe how misinformed I was on like the,

278
00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:47.520
your assumption of all downs people that like the how articulate and and and

279
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.690
high functioning to,
to borrow from are our friend here.

280
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:57.180
These people were like two of the Lane married one.
The guy,
they were like,

281
00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.160
are you interested in dating?
He's like,
I don't want it.

282
00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.010
Like he talked like that I'm not interested in dating a girl with down syndrome.

283
00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:05.220
And they were like,
why?
He was like,
honestly I'm not attracted to it.

284
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:09.420
Like that was the level of the conversation that he didn't talk funding at all?

285
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.540
No,
there was no like a affectation.

286
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.600
Nope.
It's pretty nice to you to take it there though.

287
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.410
But that's what we're having.
We're having a nice time.

288
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.350
And then everybody listening is thinking because you ordered,

289
00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:32.970
cause you're talking like you're talking normally and everyone in their head is

290
00:19:32.971 --> 00:19:35.340
translating it to retarded when you straighten your arms.

291
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:37.523
<v 5>Wow.</v>

292
00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:44.840
<v 2>That guy's,
that guy's,
that guy's not retarded.
That's,</v>

293
00:19:44.841 --> 00:19:49.390
that's the best part.
Let's go guys functioning.
And he just,

294
00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:57.360
he just makes himself returners.
Nice,
Nice,
Nice.

295
00:19:57.361 --> 00:20:02.290
Everybody's thinking.
I'm just saying what the listeners?
No,
no,
the answer is no.

296
00:20:02.291 --> 00:20:05.430
They were like,
he talked,
he talked like Tom Segura.
I mean,

297
00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.240
I wouldn't take it there.
It wasn't like guys

298
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.133
like you're all,

299
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.290
would you fuck a down syndrome?
No,
no down syndrome girl or her.

300
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:24.850
Honestly,
this,
this lady really scares me.

301
00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.050
I think there's some real severe look out.

302
00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:31.820
I mean that that looks like when you see somebody that killed somebody and they

303
00:20:31.821 --> 00:20:34.150
do a mugshot and you're like,
especially when it's a woman,
you're like woo.

304
00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.990
And they show that.
I'm like,
Oh yeah,
I see that Eileen Warner,
there's,

305
00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.960
there's just darkness and her man angry.
You know what this is like a,

306
00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:44.380
like an East Coast d like,
you know,

307
00:20:44.381 --> 00:20:48.130
some of them are just so angry just because they're born the east coast

308
00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.180
<v 6>and they were like,
we don't have Starbucks.</v>

309
00:20:50.181 --> 00:20:54.260
Really have Dunkin donuts and there's no sun.
No Sun shine here.

310
00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:58.180
Oh your mom's con.
Yeah,
the citrus is terrible.

311
00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.630
I know she's mad cause she can't get a decent avocado on the east coast.

312
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.230
Everybody gets mad about that.
Fucking blow him.
Did you fuck them?

313
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.950
That's really,
that's a really look for that to be your genuine perspective.
No,

314
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.550
not at all.
On the normal regimen.

315
00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:17.020
And that's probably on the list of things a downs person is concerned with.

316
00:21:17.021 --> 00:21:19.150
Like they fall by the way.
That's the other thing you should've put.

317
00:21:19.151 --> 00:21:21.880
She's wrong about,
it's wrong.
She didn't she have a lot of sex.
No,

318
00:21:21.881 --> 00:21:24.880
I didn't download caffeine anyways.

319
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.920
Every time this thing goes asleep,
I get 25 messages.

320
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:34.690
Get Caffeine asshole.
I know.
And I keep forgetting.
Okay.

321
00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:39.643
<v 7>So</v>

323
00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:48.560
yeah,
she's,
she's,
she's grumpy.
Uh,
very [inaudible].

324
00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.540
<v 3>Normally how many sick a straight women,
straight women who,</v>

325
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:57.590
who write the trying to understand core lesbian.

326
00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:01.500
Do you want to understand what you want to help me?
Okay.
Do you want,

327
00:22:01.501 --> 00:22:05.550
you want to help me?
Any straight women out there link my con,

328
00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:10.170
lick it until I calm in your mouth.

329
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.273
<v 7>Didn't</v>

330
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.800
<v 6>do it for you
is a really,</v>

331
00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:22.600
this is the equivalent of some really sexually repressed dude.

332
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.990
Yeah.
Women are fucking assholes.
Something like that.
Like it's a lot.

333
00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:30.160
She's that aggressive.
She's like,
she's like a dude that's upsetting.

334
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:32.770
It's like a bummer how upset she is.

335
00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.410
It's not attractive to the what part.

336
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.990
<v 7>Okay.</v>

337
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:42.650
<v 6>Is it all the physical features that are thrown together?
Oh,
is it the attitude?</v>

338
00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.580
It's the attitude.
Yeah,

339
00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.780
because honestly somebody in the world would find her physically.

340
00:22:47.781 --> 00:22:48.680
She's not physically,

341
00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:53.330
she's talking about after an adventure and like maybe like digging through some

342
00:22:53.331 --> 00:22:55.910
caves.
There would be someone that we could find that would fuck her.

343
00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:57.140
You said somebody in the world,

344
00:22:57.141 --> 00:22:59.300
I'm just saying that they're not around probably that much,

345
00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.860
but if you kept searching and you got like a like a group of people together and

346
00:23:03.861 --> 00:23:05.120
it was one of those things where you went,

347
00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:09.500
you know when they have like 70 people walk through the woods and they each have

348
00:23:09.501 --> 00:23:11.060
a flashlight,
like a search party,

349
00:23:11.061 --> 00:23:13.880
then they can find the one person that would fucker.
I got what you're saying.

350
00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.553
Yeah,
you're right.

351
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.450
<v 3>You want to be helpful.</v>

352
00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:20.380
Straight women open up a nice little lesbian sexual clinic.

353
00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:25.720
Go in there and dress up in a nurses out there with the shortest skirt and you

354
00:23:25.721 --> 00:23:29.350
can come in and go,
hi honey.
Time to get your spine reach back.

355
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:34.450
Then you wouldn't be kicked out of your rubber Mommy fucking rubbing my face.

356
00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:40.090
<v 6>Yeah,
so attractive and she's really crazy.
I feel like I need to tell her,</v>

357
00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:45.260
you know how you're going to get laid.
Not that like I need to help her.
How's,

358
00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.160
how would you help her?
First

359
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:46.880
<v 2>of all,
right</v>

360
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.190
<v 4>lick Kublai Khan.</v>

361
00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:56.180
<v 2>First of all,
she's a positive attitude.
Lesbian or not?</v>

362
00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.530
No one likes a Debbie Downer.
Like it doesn't matter what you do.

363
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:03.620
And then maybe change the tee shirt.
Maybe we're a bra.
Yeah.

364
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.860
I mean I don't think she wears deodorant.
Do you think she would be like,

365
00:24:06.861 --> 00:24:11.390
you know what?
How about I buy a new t shirt at all?

366
00:24:11.391 --> 00:24:14.690
Fucking wear some makeup and then all you gotta do.

367
00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.293
<v 4>He's like my country.</v>

368
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:21.650
<v 2>She,
she really throws it out there.
She does.
Yeah.
She's aggressive.</v>

369
00:24:21.651 --> 00:24:25.370
Do you remember that one time when we were in New York City for my 30th birthday

370
00:24:25.371 --> 00:24:30.340
we were with Shauna and Joanie.
Thank you.
And we were in the,

371
00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.230
what's their park park called?

372
00:24:33.231 --> 00:24:35.890
The big core central park and dumpy.

373
00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:41.180
Remember it's been stuck in my brain for 10 years.

374
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:43.850
It's a woman who walked up to us and she wanted to,

375
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.970
she bumped you want to bum a cigarette and she was wearing a shirt with the

376
00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:50.210
shirt tee shirt with no bra.

377
00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:56.390
And she was young too.
Right?
That's what stood out.
And she was young.

378
00:24:56.391 --> 00:25:01.100
She was in her 20s.
Cute.
But there were like sloppers I remember just being like,

379
00:25:01.101 --> 00:25:04.310
I bet like for 20 bucks.
And he's like,
Hey,
he my asshole for 20 bucks.

380
00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:08.930
I bet she'd be like,
all right.
Now she's like,
can I bum a cigarette?
You're like,

381
00:25:08.931 --> 00:25:13.660
if eat my ass hall.
Do you think she did it for a cigarette?
I think she was uh,

382
00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:17.150
you know,
down enough on life that you could have been,

383
00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:21.020
you had to ask her anything.
She was down online.
Oh,
she looked really,

384
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:25.580
really like she was bummed out.
Like she didn't belong.
It feels like a runaway.

385
00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:28.160
Wow.
You really remembered her.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cause I was like,

386
00:25:28.161 --> 00:25:30.740
oh my wished her team would take a walk so I could see what I can figure out

387
00:25:30.741 --> 00:25:33.440
what this chick,
you know,
cause her tits.

388
00:25:33.441 --> 00:25:36.050
What was neat about and why it sticks out in my mind,

389
00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:44.210
it's the way that they moved.
Like you ever seen when the ladies,

390
00:25:44.211 --> 00:25:48.110
the burlesque ladies with the tassels.
Yes.
Boom,
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.

391
00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:53.600
Just from walking the walk.
But they went like this boom,
boom.
Until they didn't,

392
00:25:53.601 --> 00:25:54.800
they didn't sync up.
Right.

393
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:57.650
It was also one of those things where the four of it was the four of us,

394
00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:01.380
we all are to turn crazy.
Everybody saw it.

395
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:06.910
And it's rare when four people notice the exactly like triple J's on a 21 year

396
00:26:07.941 --> 00:26:12.130
old girl
and like Shauna and I,

397
00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:17.450
the bus station for days now I bum a cigarette.
She did not say that.

398
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:21.990
She looked like it.
She did.
She looked like it.
And I was like,

399
00:26:21.991 --> 00:26:26.330
why don't you give me a fucking blow job?
Jesus.
No,
I,
you're so aggressive,

400
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:30.230
bitch,
sitting over here fucking lick my can.

401
00:26:30.231 --> 00:26:32.750
You know what I was thinking?

402
00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:37.530
<v 4>Emotional problems.
Right,
right.</v>

403
00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:42.330
<v 2>That's what I felt like that I could use one of those.
She's very repressed.
Yeah.</v>

404
00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:44.130
She's angry.
She's really,
really

405
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:48.840
<v 6>mad.
She's seen so many beautiful women that weren't attracted to her.
Yeah.</v>

406
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:52.410
Yeah.
But it's her doing it is,

407
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:56.480
but you don't see it whenever anyone like everyone's,
I don't know that everyone,

408
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.950
but like,
and whenever you're frustrated like that,
yeah.

409
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.940
You texted while to separate and sometimes some people never see it,

410
00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:06.520
but it's not other people.
It's you and your perspective.
Yeah.

411
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:08.520
Cause there's someone for everyone.
I've been there,

412
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:12.840
I've been in that position sitting it,
not like I didn't wolf shirt,

413
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:16.170
but I've been in like,
this sucks.
You know,

414
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.470
sitting and sitting around in the apartment and then you're like,

415
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.880
well why not me?
But you're not going to figure it out in the apartment.

416
00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:26.570
You got to get out of your apartment because you want,

417
00:27:26.571 --> 00:27:28.290
you want to know why you're all fucked up.
Yeah.

418
00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.140
Cause your friends are fucking loser because the fucking bumps you hang around

419
00:27:31.141 --> 00:27:34.080
with.
Well it's true though.
It's true.

420
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:38.730
It's her negative and her negativity is just going to repel.
It's true.

421
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.430
Other women and you have to hang out with that.

422
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:45.400
It doesn't matter where you are in life.
You can't be around negativity.
No,

423
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:48.780
that is the kiss of death.
I agree.

424
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:52.470
It's like negative people that are always always complain and our downs,

425
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:57.360
every shit on everything and everything sucks and fuck that person would tell

426
00:27:57.361 --> 00:27:59.700
you those people are poisoned,
man.
Yeah,
show me your friends.

427
00:27:59.701 --> 00:28:01.930
I'll show you your future.
Yeah.
Dan Pena said,

428
00:28:01.931 --> 00:28:03.330
and you're sitting around your apartment like,

429
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:10.320
cause the thing is I get out,
don't hold up a little.
Changed her attitude.

430
00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:13.890
Go for a walk.
Go for a walk,
go to the bar,
Go meet other women.

431
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:17.640
I mean there's someone for everyone yet another wolf shirt.

432
00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:21.690
Get another wolf shirt.
Put some,
get some hairspray.

433
00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.940
I'll wear fucking makeup.
He'd dump cond you've lived my cotton.

434
00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:31.860
I'll come in your mouth.
That's a cool thing.
That's really aggressive.

435
00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:36.340
So she said,
Hillel fucking common your mouth when you,
oh my God,

436
00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.090
my face.
We're talking about a woman,

437
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:44.210
but women have dark thoughts like that too.
Of course.
Of course.
Do you have that,

438
00:28:44.211 --> 00:28:46.620
those,
those thoughts sometimes rub that,

439
00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:49.050
rub those big tits in my face or like why don't you stuff,

440
00:28:49.051 --> 00:28:52.920
you're digging my mouth like that all the time.
Really?
That's how I think.

441
00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:56.130
So I go check.
When you're frustrated,
you're like,

442
00:28:56.131 --> 00:28:57.570
why don't you to stuff your balls in my mouth.

443
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:02.760
Like some guy behind the counter and you're like,

444
00:29:02.761 --> 00:29:07.530
this guy's good looking bulls and my mount you stuff your fucking balls in my

445
00:29:07.531 --> 00:29:12.210
mouth on train them.
I don't think I've ever,

446
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.440
never the kind of right kind of,
yeah,

447
00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:18.660
like I want to like the meat and the potatoes,

448
00:29:18.661 --> 00:29:20.130
the dog in the bath tub in my mouth.

449
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:26.370
But you as a woman do women,
do you have those thoughts?
Sometimes aggressive sex.

450
00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:29.880
Yeah.
Yeah.
But that's usually in the act of,

451
00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:33.420
or when you and I are ramping up all it was talking about.
Okay,

452
00:29:33.421 --> 00:29:36.960
let's talk about fun,
aggressive.
Let's get,
let's take me out of the equation.

453
00:29:36.961 --> 00:29:39.240
Let's say like way before we were together.

454
00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:42.370
Did you ever have like 14

455
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.820
<v 2>years?
Right.
But let's say you're,
you know,
I can't remember that far.</v>

456
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.860
You see in the guy,
he's,
he's,
he's wheeling the trash bag.
Oh,
and you're like,

457
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:53.260
yeah,
like he's wheeling it back to the curb and you're like,

458
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:57.660
why don't you stuff that?
No,
no,
no.
Why not like that?
I don't,

459
00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:00.610
not that angry.
She's angry.
Sexual.
Yeah.

460
00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:05.530
She's so hard up that her horniness is turned into rage.

461
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.040
Right?
Like she's angry.
Horny.
What gives that away

462
00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:11.090
<v 4>lick?
Because my con lick it.</v>

463
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.800
<v 2>I don't think I've ever been angry corn.
Yeah.</v>

464
00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:21.660
What about you when you see that lady in front of the Vons and she's missing all

465
00:30:22.451 --> 00:30:26.140
her teeth,
but she's got that sign if she's got some free kittens.
Yeah.

466
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.610
And she's,

467
00:30:27.611 --> 00:30:32.500
her face is a little dirty and her beard is grown in just the little at her

468
00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:37.390
tits.
I Dunno.
What the hell was going on there?
Stop again.

469
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:41.800
She doesn't want one.
Why is that about the close?

470
00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:46.660
What's going on?
I don't know.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Oh No.

471
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.080
Why is this stop

472
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:57.470
one too?
Um,
all right.
I don't know.

473
00:30:57.471 --> 00:31:00.590
He's had some weird technical thing there with our,

474
00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:06.260
fuck me man.
But it's recording.
Okay.
Yeah,
it's recording.
It's fine.

475
00:31:06.261 --> 00:31:10.100
I just got scared.
I got scared.
Did you pee in your pants a little bit?

476
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:15.080
Back to my question.
Yeah.
You see the lady in front of Vaughn to the sign?
Yeah.

477
00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:19.670
And she's got the free kittens and her beard is grown in and her tits are a

478
00:31:19.671 --> 00:31:23.480
little loose cause they're not in a bra.
Yeah,
she's probably smells pretty bad.

479
00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.390
Did that doesn't stop.
You know,
that's the thing.

480
00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:30.050
If you paint a different picture without the smells,
I can,

481
00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:35.420
I can probably approach it.
The smells are too much.
So I've sat,

482
00:31:35.421 --> 00:31:39.530
I've walked by those ladies.
She uses this smells overwhelmed.

483
00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:43.850
So one of those ladies or lesbian,
both lady,

484
00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:48.830
I think this lady might murder someone.
She's,
she's so a horny.
Yeah,

485
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:54.080
she's horngry.
But she also has,
um,
empty soulless eyes.
Yeah.
She's mentally ill.

486
00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.130
That lady without the teeth and the kittens.
She's a little,

487
00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:00.650
she's nurturing a little loving,
but she's got to take a shower.

488
00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:05.250
What if you brought her home and we show her no.
Why?

489
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:09.710
I don't want to bring her home.
A hotel.
The hotel.
I take her to a motel.

490
00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:13.100
Motel?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's not worth the hotel.
No,
no,
no.
Yeah.

491
00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:18.620
And then I'd be like,
Hey,
hey,
here you go.
Here you go.

492
00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:21.560
Here's a few bucks.
And then you'd have to shave up or coach too.

493
00:32:21.561 --> 00:32:26.540
It's all fucked up.
Yeah.
Um,
what,

494
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:31.460
how has your beard coming back in?
It's not good.
No,
it's good now.

495
00:32:31.461 --> 00:32:35.770
It was bad last week.
Yeah,
you got all fucked up.
Your beard got all jacked.

496
00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:40.050
It got all fucked up.
But now your beard's growing back in and it

497
00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:44.120
<v 6>starting to look good.
What do you think?
Tell me how you feel.
Um,</v>

498
00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:49.460
I'm feeling pretty,
I'm feeling better.
Every day is better.

499
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:54.240
He really fucked me up.
Uh,
I can faint.

500
00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:57.910
He jacked it up to you.
Look fucked up.
It was really funny when you came home,

501
00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:58.970
it was really your face.

502
00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:03.470
I'll never forget your face cause your eyes really were like Ooh,

503
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:08.450
he got ya.
What happened there?
Got Ya.
Every now and then a hairdresser gets,

504
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:12.350
they get ya.
Yeah.
Every now and it happens.
It just happens here.

505
00:33:12.351 --> 00:33:14.390
I'm going to do a poll on Twitter.
I just thought about this.

506
00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:15.950
What's the poll I'm going to do?

507
00:33:15.951 --> 00:33:20.951
What should I name my tour and I have I think three or four options.

508
00:33:21.081 --> 00:33:25.980
I know you what?
Stan Ama.
The standard.
Mature

509
00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:32.710
stand up.
Yeah.
Um,
stand Stan standing up.

510
00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:33.613
That's pretty good.

511
00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.710
I liked staying tomorrow but I don't know if that's going to be in mind about

512
00:33:36.711 --> 00:33:41.230
fuck my beard.
My beard.
Beard fucked.
I'm beard fucked.

513
00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:46.160
I got beard.
Fuck.
Do you guys my beard sucks.

514
00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:51.140
Suck.
Beard.
Beard smells.
That's a I like beard smells.

515
00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:55.730
Oh my God.
So I like beard smells.
I've always liked that one.

516
00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:05.003
<v 0>No,</v>

517
00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.740
<v 6>I was thinking hell to the Nah as the tour name.
I like hell to the na.
Yeah.
Okay.</v>

518
00:34:08.741 --> 00:34:11.710
So what are your front runners?
Okay,
here we go.
Here they are.
Yeah.

519
00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:16.460
They are my hell to the Nah,
uh,

520
00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:20.620
verifiable as a tour name.
I don't understand that one.

521
00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:25.310
It's a play on a couple things.
It's like,
you know,
it's checkmark like,

522
00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:30.280
yeah.
Yeah.
This is verified.
It's verifiable.
Yeah.
It's also,

523
00:34:30.281 --> 00:34:32.220
I think a play on this sincerity.
Like,

524
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:36.460
cause I could see someone doing that sincerely like verifiably good.
You know?

525
00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:41.890
So it's like kind of a joke about that.
Like,
um,

526
00:34:42.490 --> 00:34:45.570
yeah.
Give me the check mark.
Uh,
fresh on parole.

527
00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:50.720
[inaudible] is one and then I have no teeth,

528
00:34:51.341 --> 00:34:54.940
no entry.
Those are my leading tornado.

529
00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:58.480
What do you feel in your gut?
I think I want to go with hell to the Nah,

530
00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:01.360
I liked that one.
Hell No.
And you just got your theme song.

531
00:35:01.361 --> 00:35:03.810
So when they bring you on stage,
yeah.
The health of the norm.

532
00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.130
<v 2>All right.
You guys,
are you ready for your headliner?</v>

533
00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.210
<v 6>Yay.</v>

534
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:11.890
<v 2>Ah,
here he is.
You've heard him on your mom's house.</v>

535
00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:15.520
You've seen him jerking off in alleyways.

536
00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.810
Give it up for Tom Segura.

537
00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.530
<v 0>Hey guys,
what's up?</v>

538
00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:32.910
<v 6>Yeah.
Who sings this is this.
Yeah.
Who Sings this bishop?</v>

539
00:35:32.911 --> 00:35:36.090
Bullwinkle they should run.
Yeah,
I think this is great.

540
00:35:36.091 --> 00:35:38.190
And then your poster could be dressed as the bishop.

541
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:42.030
<v 2>Yeah.
How about,
what if I call suit?
What have I called my tour?</v>

542
00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:43.370
<v 7>What is bullshit?</v>

543
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:50.610
<v 2>I love watch this bullshit.
I can't put it as the toy,
but that's a really fun.</v>

544
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.250
Why Not Watch this bullshit?
Bullshit.

545
00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:56.443
<v 7>Bullshit.</v>

546
00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:04.750
<v 2>What was the best clip?
Where were his other ones?
So funny.
He goes,
watch this</v>

547
00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:13.690
guy.
He's so drunk to work.
The best is that when that happened is there,

548
00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:17.380
they're there in North Korea and they were doing your presentation state dinner

549
00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:21.390
for him.
Yeah.
And then he grabs a Mike.
He carry boxes.

550
00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:23.260
Bullshit law.

551
00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:28.210
So loaded term drunk than a deck.
Oh my God.

552
00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:32.110
Uh,
oh.
I guess there's also,
um,

553
00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:36.190
I'm Pauley and I'm by,
oh,
that's a good one.
No,

554
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:39.880
the poly and by tour.
I know,
but when people are going to be like,
wait,

555
00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.550
that's too confusing.
If they're not fans of the show,
I know.

556
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:46.090
It's like when you do a standup show and then podcast fans just yell,

557
00:36:46.091 --> 00:36:49.900
shout or you Paulie by,
you know,
and you're like,
I can't,
I can't right now.

558
00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:55.540
You don't like a beard?
Smells I liked beards or smells is good.
What is amazing?

559
00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:59.350
Oh fuck this.
Great.
Amazing.

560
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:10.060
It's so good.
Oh Man.
You want to know?
Well,
I think,

561
00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:12.940
I think the answer you have it.
I think it's held to the na.
Yeah.

562
00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:15.590
Did you write down my,
my,
my time.
Okay.

563
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:20.290
I did kiss my pussy would have been good to
kiss,

564
00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.510
kiss my printed on these tickets and everything.

565
00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:26.770
I think that's even funnier if you get a ticket and it's like the kiss my Pussy

566
00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:30.400
Thompson represents kiss my pussy.
Yeah.
Or golden voice or whatever.
Yeah.

567
00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:35.840
Presents,
uh,
the kiss my pussy tour.
Yeah.
Yeah,

568
00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:41.530
yeah.
Hmm.
Yeah.
That's a good one too.
What am I,

569
00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:46.480
what am I top ones again?
All right.
You got hell to the,
Naw,
you got verifiable.

570
00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:51.490
Fresh on parole.
No teeth.
No entry.
Yeah.

571
00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:56.580
I think that's top for,
see now I like fresh on parole.
So do I.

572
00:37:56.581 --> 00:37:58.720
You know why it made me laugh when you just said chuck,

573
00:37:58.721 --> 00:38:00.960
and it's always a good thing when it makes you laugh.
Yeah.

574
00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:07.860
But hell to the Nah.
It's so dumb.
It's dumb,
but it also has,
it's catchy,

575
00:38:07.861 --> 00:38:11.640
right?
Yeah.
That's a silly name.
Hell to the nine.

576
00:38:11.641 --> 00:38:14.070
You can play that song when you come out on stage.

577
00:38:14.071 --> 00:38:17.900
I might be able to even book bishop Bullwinkle somewhere.
That'd be fun.
Yeah.

578
00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:22.890
To sing it up fresh on her role.
It's stupid.
It's very stupid.

579
00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:28.200
Which amuses me a lot.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Fresh for all.
Wow.

580
00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:30.840
You know,
it's tough.

581
00:38:30.841 --> 00:38:33.900
This is one of the toughest decisions we've ever had to make.

582
00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:40.030
<v 6>Make a branch and get over it.
That's what I got to do though about this.</v>

583
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:43.810
It's like,
all right,
well I'll tweet that out if you want to vote for me,

584
00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:44.870
but okay.
Alright.

585
00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:52.750
Look what's here.
It's a quarter of a piece of bread that I didn't eat last week.

586
00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:57.400
Somebody pointed that out,
I think in a tweet or something.
Oh yeah.

587
00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:01.600
I don't know why I didn't finish.
I don't know why it's still here.

588
00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:06.490
It's really hard.
You were talking earlier about,
um,

589
00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:10.890
Dan Amoss a Ma,
you know,
and how standard must on a mall,

590
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:14.540
how it's important to have stand on my,
um,
the standard.

591
00:39:14.541 --> 00:39:18.820
My kid put together some raps.
Oh,
cool.
I think he's rapping.

592
00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:23.830
Someone said to me he is rapping about social injustice possibly.

593
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:27.370
Okay.
That's kind of exciting.
Let's hear what he has to rap about.

594
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:30.760
Can't wait to hear your raps.
Stay Anima.

595
00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:36.010
<v 9>It is my desire.
Yeah.</v>

596
00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:40.340
Mom's desire.
My desire.
Mm.

597
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:44.410
Kay.
Quit with the [inaudible],
the bitching

598
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:46.970
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

599
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:50.160
<v 9>on the fake artificial world.
Everything's aren't a phish show.</v>

600
00:39:50.161 --> 00:39:55.161
All of these nerds going to tap it Victoria secret and they complaining they

601
00:39:55.521 --> 00:39:59.300
don't have money because they spend money on these twitch hose because they

602
00:39:59.301 --> 00:40:01.880
can't control their desire.
But then the minute you call them out,

603
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.910
it's politically correct.
You're a woman.
Hated massage.
Dennis.

604
00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:09.350
This is political correctness up the ass political correctness.

605
00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:14.970
<v 6>Is that the son of the lady that wants me to liquor con or no,</v>

606
00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:20.730
cause I see a lot of similarities.
Yeah.
Including hairstyle.
Oh,
anger.
Yeah.

607
00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:25.020
That was that.
That was not his best verse.
I don't think,
no,

608
00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:30.210
I'm not inclined to continue,
but,
um,
do you want to hear one more verse?

609
00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:35.010
Possibly?
No,
I think he needs to work on it a little.
Yeah,
maybe

610
00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:40.290
just work on it.
He talks about words in the second verse.
Okay.
All right.

611
00:40:40.291 --> 00:40:41.350
Let's give it a listen.

612
00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:42.850
<v 9>I can't even,</v>

613
00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:47.010
I can't even look on my computer screen because they want to castrate me and

614
00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:48.400
crucify me over some,

615
00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:52.690
and political incorrectness can't even use the word slow anymore because it's

616
00:40:52.691 --> 00:40:56.590
wrong and they need to take it out the dictionary for these people want to take

617
00:40:56.591 --> 00:40:59.800
everything out of the dictionary because everything's offensive to them.

618
00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:04.480
<v 6>Okay.
Do you know what I was thinking and a correct me if I'm wrong.
Yeah.</v>

619
00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:09.370
The one thing you really need the rap is flow.
Yeah.

620
00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:12.910
He's got,
he said,
that's what you're saying,
right?
He's got it.
He's got the look.

621
00:41:12.911 --> 00:41:15.540
Yeah.
You're saying he's got that.
So you're saying he's got the,

622
00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:20.260
the one thing you need.
Got It.
He's got the hair.
Yeah,
he's got it all.

623
00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:24.940
Lyrics,
check,
flow,
check,
check,

624
00:41:24.941 --> 00:41:25.900
check video.

625
00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:30.460
She got an email about the poop pile.

626
00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.830
Oh Bullshit.
Your poop pile.
Who

627
00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:39.050
<v 0>mix dog</v>

628
00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:45.870
Brown dog coming off makes me laugh every morning

629
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:48.190
<v 1>and says,
hey jeans.</v>

630
00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:52.060
I just wanted to pile on the heap and the Pooh story debate.

631
00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:56.860
I am inclined to believe Tom because on boy scout outings we would do something

632
00:41:56.861 --> 00:41:59.620
similar.
You were supposed to dig a sizeable hole.

633
00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:02.830
The being fascinated by fire and fucked up stuff.

634
00:42:02.831 --> 00:42:06.910
As teenage boys we would use sticks,
leaves or we would,

635
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:10.600
we could find a sizable sheet of bark to move the poop and do a mound.

636
00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:16.170
We would then set the very flammable methane life shit stack ablaze best Ben

637
00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:18.493
Jeans.

638
00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:22.040
<v 2>It's not exactly,
it's not exactly the way you described your poop pile.</v>

639
00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:26.430
It's not exactly the same,
but name is similar.
I'll tell you why.

640
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:30.630
You at one point lied and said that you had a ladder and that you guys would

641
00:42:30.631 --> 00:42:32.150
climb up the ladder.
I said,

642
00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:35.940
ally and hang your ass is over the ladder and then shit.

643
00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:39.690
Awful ladder,
which is almost impossible to off of a ladder.

644
00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:44.700
A ladder on a tree.
You know,
it was like,
no.
There were steps.

645
00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:46.680
Someone hammered into a tree,

646
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:52.190
you could climb up a makeshift ladder and then on the tree there was a like a

647
00:42:52.801 --> 00:42:53.730
seat,
like a ledge.

648
00:42:53.731 --> 00:42:58.731
You could sit on and shit from the tree or you find that this is so stupid and

649
00:42:59.101 --> 00:43:03.540
that you keep adding to it.
Adding till,
I'm not adding.

650
00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:05.370
Why would you do that?

651
00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:10.230
Why would you go through the trouble of building a makeshift ladder on a tree?

652
00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:14.470
Yeah,
so you could climb up it and then she boot pile.

653
00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:19.110
That's a lie.
You think,
ah,
I like that.
And then people would,

654
00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:23.430
they would drop with either the children would come running for miles,

655
00:43:23.431 --> 00:43:27.360
they would on the poupon.
They loved it.
The kids loved it.
And neighborhood kids,

656
00:43:27.361 --> 00:43:30.530
you'd see it.
They would drop their ice cream just to do it,
you know?
Okay.

657
00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:33.670
It was really not,
I know.
He was really fun.
Yeah.
Officially line.

658
00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:37.420
I'm not guys don't believe Thompson Gora.
Yeah,

659
00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:41.910
<v 1>I'm leaving this guy.
You got another email from a listener that says,</v>

660
00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:47.280
Hey,
I know my,
my husband is now using a double pipe.

661
00:43:47.281 --> 00:43:52.230
Classic excuse to Fart all over the place.
Thanks guys.
I played me both.

662
00:43:52.231 --> 00:43:56.910
I want this to stop.
No more double pipe.
Classic mythology is low and loose,

663
00:43:56.911 --> 00:43:57.744
Jess.

664
00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:02.160
<v 2>Okay.
Wow.
Yeah,
yeah.
This year it.</v>

665
00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:06.430
See I can't do that with moving on to the room.
Right.
I feel like it's too,

666
00:44:06.431 --> 00:44:10.930
it's too much for him.
Yeah.
I'm his mother figure.
I feel like he can't see,

667
00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:14.510
can't handle it.
Not,
yeah,
he doesn't have the standard.
The standard.
Yep.

668
00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.990
You heard it first here.
Sorry.
Blue Band.

669
00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:24.010
<v 1>No farts.
Hi Mommy's.
I'm a huge fan of your show as well as mommy jeans.</v>

670
00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:28.750
That's deep,
Bro.
Weekly Jam.
That keeps me sane.
Thank you.

671
00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:32.010
Normally I wouldn't chime in,
but after that,
after listening your last podcast,

672
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:36.450
<v 6>I had to say something you guys were talking about naming your next born Carl's</v>

673
00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:39.420
Jr.
Well,
I am a woman.

674
00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:44.670
I forgot about that.
I have a one and a half year old daughter who's exclusive.

675
00:44:44.671 --> 00:44:49.671
Nickname is just that I nicknamed her car when she was just a newborn and

676
00:44:50.341 --> 00:44:52.290
somehow it morphed into Carl's Jr.

677
00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:57.620
My super uptight mom always has to throw her 2 cents in about how I'm screwing

678
00:44:57.631 --> 00:45:00.480
up my kid and giving her gender identity issues because of this,

679
00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:05.040
I say in an era where people name their Kids Cherries,
waffles,

680
00:45:05.041 --> 00:45:07.110
tennis and apple race car.

681
00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:12.120
Whatevs this nickname is totally acceptable considering she has a normal girl's

682
00:45:12.181 --> 00:45:15.810
first name for all intents and purposes,
which I typically call her in public.

683
00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:19.590
My hope is that you guys can weigh in on weird family nicknames you were called

684
00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:24.210
and ones you plan on embarrassing your kid with also.
Am I fucked up?

685
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:27.720
I fucked up.
Parents were calling my kid this hilarious nickname.

686
00:45:27.721 --> 00:45:32.100
What's the long term damage?
Thanks.
Love y'all.
Zooey um,

687
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:36.870
I have to say you're talking to nicknamed fanatics 10 nicknames for everybody.

688
00:45:36.871 --> 00:45:41.370
If it's a problem,
we're in trouble.
So we have a lot of nicknames for ourselves,

689
00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:45.810
for each other,
for drugs.
Yeah.
I mean,
you know,
we actually,

690
00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:48.300
many of you know our good friend Ryan Sickler,

691
00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:53.310
I started calling him sickle cell 10 years ago calling him sickle cell.

692
00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:57.400
No you didn't.
And I called him a with,
sorry.
Sorry.

693
00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:01.950
You need to get your life because that was mine.
No,
no,
no.

694
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:06.500
I've called them sickle cell the longest mine.

695
00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:11.940
You're lying.
No,
no,
no,
no.
Not you like your claim things that I did.

696
00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:16.230
I called him sickle cell after sickle cell anemia.
Dave.

697
00:46:16.231 --> 00:46:19.980
I know what it's named after.
I know what I had called him.
Of course.

698
00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:23.730
Of course.
I remember when I told it to you.

699
00:46:23.731 --> 00:46:27.570
You do not remember when you told it to me.
No,
you laughed and then you go,

700
00:46:27.571 --> 00:46:31.320
we can't call him that.
That's so inappropriate.
That was fun.
He's a comedian.

701
00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:35.560
It's fine.
No,
you're so crazy.
You're going to,

702
00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:41.970
you're so crazy.
What are you talking to?
I came up with sickle cell.

703
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.280
You don't even know what sickle cell anemia was at the time.

704
00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:48.450
What are you talking about?
Okay.
Anyways.

705
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:53.010
Oh my God.
Okay,
let's ask sickle cell.
Okay,
let's ask him.

706
00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.350
I'm going to call him right now.
Yeah.
All right.

707
00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:57.180
But he doesn't know who invented it.

708
00:46:57.181 --> 00:47:01.650
I don't think maybe he'll have a recollection.
I think he's going to say it's me.

709
00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:04.170
Well,
that's what you're claiming.
So I would assume that you think that,

710
00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:06.990
but then how does he know who invented it?

711
00:47:06.991 --> 00:47:10.260
Cause I could have told you at home and then you could have said it first to him

712
00:47:10.261 --> 00:47:13.650
and then he thinks you came up with it cause you were the first to say it.

713
00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:16.050
You seem you have a reputation and we'll just,

714
00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:22.920
your or your reputation is a shaky memory.

715
00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:26.670
So I don't think it's,
first of all,

716
00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:30.220
that's so fucking bullshit.
What?
You're such

717
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:32.920
<v 2>a bullshitter.
Your list smiling because you know you're lying right now.</v>

718
00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.490
I think it's so funny that you,
everything that I say you're like,

719
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:41.560
I thought of that.
I said that for her.
It did say that first.
Okay.
All right.

720
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:45.540
Oh my God.
Fucking hope he answers be does too.

721
00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:47.550
How come?
What's going on?

722
00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:49.923
<v 10>Okay.</v>

723
00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:52.720
<v 2>It's horrible.
It's not going to answer it.
Some weird Skype.</v>

724
00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:55.773
<v 10>Okay.</v>

725
00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:59.520
<v 2>Dammit.
You're so,
so full of it.</v>

726
00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:06.500
I named him that.
Tony's been four.
I thought of sickle cell.
Okay.
All right.

727
00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:11.840
Okay.
So I'll just give you,
I'll just give you that bone.

728
00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:13.880
So Christina,
oh my God.

729
00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:17.840
Heard me say something and then said that she did it.
Oh my God.

730
00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:22.040
You're such a shitbag.
Next you're going to say you came up with El Chapo.

731
00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:26.900
That was mine.
Oh,
though is mine.
Chap Pito is yours.
El Chapo.

732
00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:29.920
I called him El Chapo first.
The baby,
right?
Oh John.

733
00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:31.730
I'm the queen of nicknames and songs.

734
00:48:31.731 --> 00:48:34.810
And you even told me that you're good at it.
Yes,
thank you.

735
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:39.460
But you didn't come up with sickle cell.
Oh my God,
you didn't.
Oh my God,
you did.

736
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:42.920
That is one thing I know I came up with his sickle cell.
You did not.

737
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:47.600
You're such a shitbag.
You are liar babe.
Oh my God.

738
00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:51.590
I'm embarrassed for you.
Oh my God.
I'm embarrassed for you.

739
00:48:51.591 --> 00:48:55.280
Where's your fucking water?
Water Champ.
What are you drinking?
That's not water.

740
00:48:55.310 --> 00:48:59.570
Yeah,
it is.
It's salted flavored water.
I'm the real watershed.
Zero Sodium,

741
00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:04.500
by the way,
by the way,
zero sugar zero.
By the way,
when I,

742
00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:09.020
I got a lot of tweets from people who saw your shows in Texas reporting back to

743
00:49:09.021 --> 00:49:12.830
me.
You had no water on stage.
Okay.
I did have water on stage,

744
00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:16.670
but you didn't talk but you didn't touch it.
Right,
right.
So,
okay,

745
00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:21.080
if it was 2100 sets,
so what?
I don't go 20 minutes without hydrating.

746
00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:27.830
Well look at your Yorkie sieve.
It doesn't matter.
I do frequency.

747
00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:30.910
Now let's talk about nicknames.
Did you have any embarrassing?

748
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:35.210
Let's go back to this and not about all right.
You named them and say go sell.
Um,

749
00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:39.620
so the point is we call our friend sickle cell.
Oh my God.

750
00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:43.400
Which is for people that are,
that don't know what's going on.

751
00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:47.270
And then they hear you go like,
hey sickle cell.
Like believe me,

752
00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:52.100
we've seen people turn hell.
Even one of our friends heard the nickname,

753
00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:54.800
ended up working with Ryan somewhere years ago.

754
00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:58.430
Saw Him and yelled out in an office setting sickle cell.

755
00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:01.160
And she said this guy popped over the uh,

756
00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:05.450
there was like a cubicle and you went like sickle cell.
And then Ryan was like,

757
00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:09.830
uh,
that's what they call me.
Like had to,
cause I came up with it.

758
00:50:09.831 --> 00:50:12.770
You thought it was so offensive.
You wouldn't say it for the longest time.

759
00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:17.900
I called Ryan sickle cell first and he went and then you hopped onboard.
Okay.

760
00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:22.400
That's how it worked.
Okay.
Okay.
Remember,
remember

761
00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:29.710
Moreau when you went to the,
and then they're like,
as a lot of cabinet

762
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:36.290
dabbling.
Me Too.
Oh my God.
It did happen to ruin you.

763
00:50:36.291 --> 00:50:40.560
Studied in Spain for a semester.
And I know I did not do that.

764
00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:48.110
Such a dad laughed.
Now can we talk about this topic though?
I like this idea.

765
00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:51.260
I know what your parents called you.

766
00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:58.050
Let's see.
Last year,
I know you're coming and turning into your time.

767
00:50:58.100 --> 00:50:58.940
Starting at the top dog.

768
00:50:59.330 --> 00:51:04.130
I know your parents called you the king of the dumps.
King of the dumps.

769
00:51:04.131 --> 00:51:08.340
As My,
my dad calls me,
he calls me big dog.
Yeah.
Uh,

770
00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:12.020
for a while was it like when I was a kid was Kaka maker.
Uh Huh.

771
00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.490
King of the dumps.

772
00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:18.540
<v 6>Um,
yeah.
You know,
stuff like that.</v>

773
00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:23.840
<v 2>They call me Chris Tucker.
Yup.
Christa law as in a horse.</v>

774
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:28.990
There's some rhyme and Hungarian.
She got,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.

775
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.820
Oh,
that's right.
Tell people what that song means.

776
00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.740
It means the snow is falling.

777
00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:41.690
The horses are farting and the the littlest or worse taking a shit

778
00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:47.510
that's a Hungarian like a,
it's like a children's song.
Yeah.

779
00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:52.640
So,
uh,
there is a time where we call each other little at the end of it,

780
00:51:52.641 --> 00:51:57.170
like crystal low,
poppy low.
So they call me Chris Crystal.
Why?

781
00:51:57.171 --> 00:51:59.510
Why did they call you that?
I forget low.

782
00:51:59.511 --> 00:52:02.990
We just add it because that song was around our house and she got home,

783
00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:05.240
Christy low and we were just singing a lot.

784
00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:10.180
So I became Criscuolo could he see low?
Oh Krista,

785
00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:15.200
Krista Potsy,
which is a horse to [inaudible] low energy.

786
00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:21.450
You do like a lot of times you walk kind of horse like not true.
Yeah,
true.

787
00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:25.700
We kind of have a go.
I got prancing horses kind of walk.
I feel like not true.

788
00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:29.810
Yeah.
I have bird energy,
bird energy.
I'm more of a bird.

789
00:52:29.811 --> 00:52:32.330
I like to perch and I look like a bird more.
Yeah.

790
00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:37.670
I don't have and I have dog energy.
Yeah.
Like a Brussels horse legs though.

791
00:52:37.671 --> 00:52:42.310
You have horse legs.
How the thin and beautiful,
no,
it was a very shapely,

792
00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.450
muscular and strong.
Yeah.

793
00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:51.530
Why are you making fun of me?
How strong I am?
Because I've seen you do squats.

794
00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:56.400
You saw me doing them this morning at 5:00 AM yeah,

795
00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:00.170
we got a lot of nicknames by the way,
for our son.
I know,

796
00:53:00.171 --> 00:53:03.660
and I just ate what I did.
And guys,
if you have children,
I recommend doing this.

797
00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:08.000
Open up an email account for your kid and then send them emails when they're

798
00:53:08.001 --> 00:53:11.330
babies and then eventually,
you know,
they can read all this stuff.

799
00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:15.170
And actually at the same time that you started doing that,

800
00:53:15.171 --> 00:53:18.530
which I think is wonderful,
I'm going to send him an email as well.
Please don't.

801
00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:22.850
Why he doesn't want to hear from you.
He told me.
Okay.

802
00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:25.920
Um,

it's okay to talk to animals and other letters from dad.

805

So he's a great comic buddy.
My used to live here and he wrote,

806
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:42.060
he wrote this book.

807
00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:46.200
It's a collection of letters that he wrote to his daughter is the same day you,

808
00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:48.340
you started doing that?
Yeah.

809
00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:51.870
It looks like Nathan's wrote written a bunch of stuff.
Oh,

810
00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:56.100
he's got a bunch of shit.

813
00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:09.570

871
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:53.840
And then they'll say the name and then they don't ask you what's your kid's
name?

872
00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:57.860
Right.
It's Jimmy.

873
00:57:58.520 --> 00:57:59.353

933
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:20.011
We don't know.

934
01:02:20.011 --> 01:02:24.040
We know that she put bags in the trees to keep the squirrels away from eating

935
01:02:24.041 --> 01:02:28.070
the figs for meeting the,
is that what it was?
Yeah,
yeah.

936
01:02:28.110 --> 01:02:30.040
Somebody sent me a picture from like,
I dunno,

937
01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:33.750
reddit or something of that practice of that being done somewhere.
You know,

938
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:38.280
that's a a thing that people do bags over the figs,

939
01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:40.260
the fruit trees.

940
01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:46.500
We got to 30 plastic bags on it,
so it's totally crazy.

941
01:02:46.501 --> 01:02:47.420
Then the do.
Yeah.

942
01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:51.850
You May as well let that doesn't make or immigrant move for sure.
For sure.
Yeah.

943
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:56.740
Yeah.
Remember when you're,
you told me the story of your Nana.
Yeah.
Um,

944
01:02:57.090 --> 01:03:00.690
she couldn't believe there were lemons,

945
01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:06.030
so she's squeezed every single lemon from a lemon tree.
Yeah.

946
01:03:06.490 --> 01:03:10.320
In a,
in a Ziploc bag and then put them in the freezer.

947
01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:14.400
So your freezer was just like full 50 Ziploc bags of lemon juice.

948
01:03:14.970 --> 01:03:17.850
And you're like,
what?
So my father,

949
01:03:17.851 --> 01:03:20.530
we had a lemon tree back in the house we lived at,

950
01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:24.720
this is when I was a teenager and she lived in Canada at the time and she grew

951
01:03:24.721 --> 01:03:29.310
up in Hungary where they never saw citrus cause of communism.
There was no fruit.

952
01:03:29.610 --> 01:03:34.320
So she came to La to visit us and also the climate,
right?
Climate.
Yeah.

953
01:03:34.321 --> 01:03:39.321
She could not believe we were wasting free citrus lemons.

954
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:44.700
So she juiced and I mean it took days and she juiced every single lemon and then

955
01:03:44.701 --> 01:03:47.790
put the juice in a Ziploc bag,
a regular old zip lock,

956
01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:49.200
and then put it in the freezer.

957
01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:54.210
Now she used the freezer that was in our garage that my father used for Fresca

958
01:03:54.211 --> 01:03:57.450
and beer.
Like,
you know,
he only has like a fresca and beer.

959
01:03:57.810 --> 01:03:59.100
It's a real dad move like that.

960
01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:04.140
And she took out all the fresca and the beer and just stocked it.
Oh,

961
01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:08.450
I didn't realize it was that much.
I mean I'm not,
it was bags.

962
01:04:09.070 --> 01:04:12.670
What'd your death thrilled when he found out
live it?

963
01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:18.000
Fuck,
are we going to do the fucking lemon juice?
I mean,

964
01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:22.470
I don't even need the shit.
But what happened was,
so she took the lemon,

965
01:04:22.471 --> 01:04:26.550
she made lemon cakes,
lemon juice,
lemon bars.

966
01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:32.130
She uses everything.
And then she went back home to Canada and we had these bags.

967
01:04:32.131 --> 01:04:35.370
And sure enough,
my dad actually ended up making lemonade a lot.

968
01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:39.630
So it was a good thing.
And we used them for years,
like years later.

969
01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:42.510
Fresh lemonade is delicious.
Certainly is Tom.

970
01:04:42.511 --> 01:04:47.060
But what a pain in the ass to make hate lemon bars.
I hate lemon.

971
01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:48.773
Lemon cake.

972
01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:54.620
Lemon cake or 11 Marangu I hate limit or key lime pie.

973
01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:00.060
All loving grocer.
I hate keyline so,

974
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.700

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:07.850

977
01:05:07.850 --> 01:05:12.500
I fucking hate lemon bars and I fucking hate orange marmalade with like the

978
01:05:12.501 --> 01:05:13.790
orange peel in it.

979
01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:18.580
Why do you want to eat that flavor of of Jam Orange?

980
01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:23.050
[inaudible] I'm not a fan.
No mind the flavor.
I don't just want the the Ryan,

981
01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:26.680
I'm sorry.
Maybe I'm a child.
But if I,
if I'm going to put a a jam,

982
01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:30.070
a spread on something,
I like strawberry.
Yeah.

983
01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:34.390
Gray but bras raise grapes.
Great.

984

I remember doing it and it was,
it was so delicious.

988
01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:54.460
Looking back though it you would just take like cups of sugar,
right?

989
01:05:54.590 --> 01:05:58.960
Have this boil going that free God.
But it was incredible.

990
01:05:58.990 --> 01:06:03.020
I wish your mom would do that stuff.
Now I know she's a little tired.

991
01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:06.400
You eat things like I would never put these together.
She would take toast.

992
01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:11.350
Put butter on it.
Yep.
Put that strawberry Marmalade.

And then a piece of Munster cheese.

That was like your dad would do that too.

995
01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:21.700
I never saw that in most American households.
You know what?

996
01:06:21.701 --> 01:06:25.090
My Dad would pack for my lunch for Sam a lunch.

997
01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:27.460
It would be butter and jam.

998
01:06:28.330 --> 01:06:30.860
Strawberry jam and butter for a sandwich.

I got scared for him Saturday because I had a friend who in college would light

1028
01:08:29.931 --> 01:08:32.390
his hand on fire when we were drunk as a joke.

1029
01:08:32.810 --> 01:08:37.490
He would put rubbing alcohol on his hand and then the light it and then one
time,

1030
01:08:37.491 --> 01:08:40.820
of course he burned himself.

And

This is crazy.
This kid.

1038
01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:17.180

1040
01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:29.920
lucky.
His buddy was there to help him

1041
01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:37.453

Fire is nothing to fuck with no dude.
And you know,</v>

1043
01:09:42.311 --> 01:09:46.200

When I was a kid,
I should,

1044
01:09:46.210 --> 01:09:50.260

Oh my gosh.

1064
01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:11.180
<v 2>anyways.
It's probably because you're so thirsty and dehydrated.</v>

But why?
Why would he do that?

Because you're his dumb boyfriend and you're going to lead him.

01:12:34.441 --> 01:12:38.450
He says the column.
So you're a lying liar.
Like your poop.

1086
01:12:38.451 --> 01:12:41.590

Let's see.
What,

1087
01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:46.320

Why is it do that?
It's because you're shooting

1088
01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:50.640
<v 13>so fucked up.
It's all retarded.
Is it going to do that through the thing?</v>

1089
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:55.080
Oh,

That there was,
I just saw a missed call numbers at you.

Hey Man.
So we've been having this debate.

1093
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:10.810
it got pretty heated.
Um,
and we needed you to weigh in on it.

1094
01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:12.553
Um,

1095
01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:16.870
who gave you the nickname sickle cell

1096
01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:22.880
<v 13>man,
that's a tough,
that's a tough,</v>

1097
01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:27.290
<v 6>should it be?
Cause it's the answer.
I let them let them decide.
Let them think</v>

1098
01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:29.130
<v 13>because</v>

1099
01:13:29.130 --> 01:13:33.600
<v 6>just tell you we both claim to have done today and um,</v>

1100
01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:36.760
<v 13>clearly you both claim claiming or you wouldn't be calling me on a Skype call</v>

1101
01:13:36.761 --> 01:13:41.150
Darren.
Okay.
Yeah,
yeah.
Got It.
Got Real man.
We've got a real,
I love the,

1102
01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:42.810
I love that this matters so much.

1103
01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:48.780
You gave me the horrible nickname I took off my wedding ring.
I'm sorry.

1104
01:13:49.470 --> 01:13:54.180
Lead defending it.
Who did it like that will be something that I'm like,

1105
01:13:54.210 --> 01:13:59.130
Nah,
you came up Holy Colette.
And I go,
no.
We're like,

1106
01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:03.680
no,
you're the piece of shit.
Why Cancer?
And um,

1107
01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:09.870
I know,
but we really are trying to claim.
So you don't recall though.

1108
01:14:09.871 --> 01:14:14.020
Let's be honest.
Right?
It sounds like it.
I know if a gun to my head now,

1109
01:14:14.021 --> 01:14:16.240
here's what I do recall.
I feel like,

1110
01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:21.340
I feel like the way Christina says it,
I feel like I've heard it more,

1111
01:14:21.341 --> 01:14:23.800
but I really felt like you started saying it first.

1112
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:26.090
<v 6>Yeah.
That's how you feel.</v>

1113
01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:29.460
Cause I do a lot of times I know my therapist has to go with my feelings.

1114
01:14:29.461 --> 01:14:30.980
So I feel like,

1115
01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:35.610
I feel like he just spoke and dairy Ryan,
I invented it.
Okay.

1116
01:14:35.650 --> 01:14:39.130
<v 13>Clearly you feel like you needed to call me.
Yeah,
I do.
You're feeling</v>

1117
01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:40.560
<v 1>I'm going my feelings right now.</v>

1118
01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:45.710
<v 13>I feel like it was t bonds.
I might,
God,
sorry Christina.
But am I wrong?</v>

1119
01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:49.310
Yes you can.
But here's the thing,
I'm malleable so if you can go,

1120
01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:52.560
we'll remember this.
I could go,
oh yeah,
yeah,
I do remember,

1121
01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:57.390
<v 6>cause I feel like I invented it and then he was too chicken shit to call it to</v>

1122
01:14:57.391 --> 01:15:01.590
your face.
And then I did at first me,
I'm chicken shit to call it.

1123
01:15:01.591 --> 01:15:03.930
They call him sickle cell.
You didn't want to,
you thought it was,

1124
01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:09.790
<v 13>I'll tell you the,
the best way to solve this.
Yeah.
After call,</v>

1125
01:15:10.090 --> 01:15:13.620
call pudding.
No,
we're definitely not going to do that.

1126
01:15:14.250 --> 01:15:15.420
We're a APP.

1127
01:15:15.930 --> 01:15:20.350
Do you remember when I came to see your,
uh,

1128
01:15:20.410 --> 01:15:22.270
to Brian screening?
Yeah,

1129
01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:25.920
the screening and I walked into the movie theater.
Right.

1130
01:15:26.010 --> 01:15:31.010
And in unison you both screen Circleville everyone including African Americans

1131
01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:37.590
in the theater looked at me.
So I feel like maybe it was a joint venture.

1132
01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:38.690
Really

1133
01:15:38.690 --> 01:15:40.340
<v 6>better answer.
That's good answer.</v>

1134
01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:43.300
The maiden voyage or we were going through all nick,
the reason,

1135
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:47.060
and we're going through nicknames that we have for family,
for friends,

1136
01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:48.470
and that's how it came up.

1137
01:15:48.471 --> 01:15:51.320
And you actually just brought up one you didn't even bring up was buns.

1138
01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:56.600
Obviously you call me,
you call me buns sometimes fun your buns.

1139
01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.550
Busay bunzee sometimes.
Yeah,

1140
01:15:58.650 --> 01:15:59.483
<v 13>yeah,
that all up.</v>

1141
01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:05.300
<v 1>Yeah.
Bonds a bond.
Fun.
I remember those.</v>

1142
01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:10.010
He used to leave me voicemails.
Ryan would call me and it would just,

1143
01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:12.970
it would go to voicemail and I press play and it'd be like,
okay,

1144
01:16:13.730 --> 01:16:15.340
I'm calling for bonds.

1145
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:19.910
And he would leave a long message about like,

1146
01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:24.740
I'm out on a fishing boat and this guy,
this guy taps me on the shoulder.

1147
01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:28.370
I mean,
I couldn't believe some guys swam up to me and he said,

1148
01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:33.100
I'm looking for buns.
And that would be the [inaudible] Leo.
Yeah.

1149
01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:37.130
You leave me these elaborate messages about looking for buns.
Tenets.

1150
01:16:37.370 --> 01:16:41.400
I got socks and balls and dicks and taints.
I liked that one.
Um,

1151
01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:43.280
t bonds came from Tommy bonds,

1152
01:16:43.281 --> 01:16:46.760
which comes from the movie belly where Dmx,

1153
01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:51.590
Dmx plays a character named Tommy buttons.
So in College,
Huh?

1154
01:16:51.610 --> 01:16:55.350
<v 13>I'm going to ask you back.
Yeah.
When is the first part you said Tom,</v>

1155
01:16:55.351 --> 01:16:59.250
you say you created,
yeah,
pickle here are the originator.
So when,

1156
01:16:59.251 --> 01:17:03.030
when was the first time you remember calling me that and same question for you,

1157
01:17:03.031 --> 01:17:03.700
Chris.

1158
01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:07.480
<v 6>The first time I remember calling you that I honestly can't remember.</v>

1159
01:17:07.481 --> 01:17:10.190
I mean it would be like,
it would have to be back around.

1160
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:15.590
<v 2>Oh my God.
Probably 2004 or something.
Three or four.</v>

1161
01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:20.330
No.
When did you start dating?
You and I started dating around that time.

1162
01:17:20.730 --> 01:17:22.880
Yeah.
More.
Your and I started dating more,

1163
01:17:22.881 --> 01:17:26.840
I would say Ledo for early oh five.
Interesting.

1164
01:17:26.841 --> 01:17:30.530
And right around the time the nickname originates.
Yeah.
Interesting.

1165
01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.510
Well that's right around the time I started,
you know,

1166
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:37.640
hanging out with Ryan a lot too,
so,
oh,
oh you guys weren't friends before?
Yeah,

1167
01:17:37.641 --> 01:17:39.930
we were.
Okay.
I said,
Oh,
three Oh four,

1168
01:17:41.170 --> 01:17:43.850
I think it came around the Putin time,
the Putin era,

1169
01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:48.230
putting another nickname of a great man.
Um,
yeah,
more nicknames.

1170
01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:52.480
<v 13>I can't take credit.
That's our high school football coach.</v>

1171
01:17:52.590 --> 01:17:54.090
<v 2>Do you remember that?
I love that.</v>

1172
01:17:54.091 --> 01:17:56.850
The story behind that is one of my favorite nickname stories.

1173
01:17:57.150 --> 01:18:01.290
It's just that basically Ryan's old roommate was playing high school football,

1174
01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:03.330
goes to his coach,
which is,

1175
01:18:04.290 --> 01:18:08.940
it's better if you really imagine how pathetic this is that a player went up to

1176
01:18:08.941 --> 01:18:12.930
a coach and was like,
all these guys have nicknames.
I want to nick.

1177
01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:16.740
And then the coach looked him up and down and goes,

1178
01:18:17.090 --> 01:18:17.923
<v 13>well it gave me,</v>

1179
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:22.410
he gave an elevator look up and down and then just went poorly.

1180
01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:27.240
<v 2>And then he was happy with that.
Right.
Wasn't he happy with pudding?</v>

1181
01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:30.330
<v 13>I mean,
you gotta be fucking happy what you asked for.</v>

1182
01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:34.770
<v 2>Do you have any other nicknames?
I mean,
sickle cell is your best nickname.</v>

1183
01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:37.480
I'll go ahead and say that.
Yeah,
but do you have any other ones?
Huh?

1184
01:18:38.250 --> 01:18:42.390
<v 13>I'm sure Beth goes to a,
an individual preference on that.
But yeah,</v>

1185
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.943
there's been up.

1186
01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:49.580
Christina says you stay oh three Oh four Putin was oh two so Christina statewide

1187
01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:55.680
might've just might've just on a sentence here.

1188
01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:57.770
<v 2>Wait,
wait.
I'm confused.</v>

1189
01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:02.600
Wouldn't put in half that putting God his nickname in high school though,
right?

1190
01:19:03.370 --> 01:19:03.710
<v 13>Yeah,</v>

1191
01:19:03.710 --> 01:19:08.590
but what I'm saying is Christina said she sickle cell originating around that

1192
01:19:08.591 --> 01:19:13.580
time,
that time would have been 2002 which precedes your o three o fours.

1193
01:19:14.110 --> 01:19:16.570
<v 2>Interesting.
I'm confused.
Meaning I'm right.</v>

1194
01:19:16.670 --> 01:19:20.410
That's how they originated with sickle cell.
Burkina falls.
And I'm saying wait,

1195
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:25.360
meaning I the,
I say the name origin dates further back in time.
That's not true.

1196
01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:27.280
Meaning that's not,
I'm right and you're wrong.

1197
01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:30.550
It doesn't update date back to Otu.
That's what Ryan's saying.

1198
01:19:31.930 --> 01:19:33.280
That's what your BFF is saying.

1199
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:37.040
<v 13>Chris,
I asked you when you first remembered you said,</v>

1200
01:19:37.041 --> 01:19:41.030
oh three Oh four I asked Christina when she said quoting top,

1201
01:19:41.031 --> 01:19:42.230
beginning of putting time

1202
01:19:42.330 --> 01:19:43.830
<v 2>around the pudding era.</v>

1203
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:49.110
You weren't hanging out with Brian and putting an old man,
but listen,

1204
01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:53.130
Tangier was happening and I would book you and Ryan every week when we were

1205
01:19:53.131 --> 01:19:57.590
doing Tangier.
And that was right around Oh two oh three and I saw,

1206
01:19:57.690 --> 01:20:00.990
I know them guys were done in Atlanta.
Yeah.

1207
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:03.810
He says one of his favorite rooms he ever did and I know it wasn't that fun.

1208
01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:08.210
Yeah.
And I remember Ryan seeing you at the cat club and that and round there,

1209
01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:11.730
<v 6>that era came sickle cell.</v>

1210
01:20:13.650 --> 01:20:14.483
Okay.

1211
01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.740
<v 13>That night was when it was really like,</v>

1212
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:21.760
I feel like you guys had just been saying it's a meaty,

1213
01:20:21.761 --> 01:20:23.020
but that's what it was born

1214
01:20:23.330 --> 01:20:28.190
<v 6>well walked into Brian's screening and we saw him.</v>

1215
01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:36.300
My favorite sickle cell story is when I was working that writing job we were

1216
01:20:36.311 --> 01:20:37.210
talking about this

1217
01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:42.650
<v 13>Dina's friend coincidentally happened to work on the same floor to fill side of</v>

1218
01:20:42.651 --> 01:20:46.850
the building in parenthesis down the hallway screaming sickle cell and this

1219
01:20:46.851 --> 01:20:51.851
little feminine black to that sat across from me named Kendrick,

1220
01:20:52.041 --> 01:20:56.320
who I love all.
I could hear him say,
well say it.

1221
01:20:56.790 --> 01:21:01.120
<v 6>I laughed so hard.
I didn't know what to say.
I was like,</v>

1222
01:21:01.121 --> 01:21:02.860
isn't that a terrible nickname?

1223
01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:13.640
<v 13>So that I can phrase the how,
how we,
I say it like that.
Back to that guy.</v>

1224
01:21:14.930 --> 01:21:19.530
<v 6>Yeah.
It predates other nicknames.
Yeah.
Do you have any other nicknames,</v>

1225
01:21:20.730 --> 01:21:22.600
Ronnie?
Ronnie love?

1226
01:21:24.270 --> 01:21:27.240
<v 13>Um,
that's really it.</v>

1227
01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:30.990
I mean my last name,
so a lot of people just short.

1228
01:21:31.150 --> 01:21:34.260
A lot of people have shortened sickle cell probably cause they don't want to

1229
01:21:34.261 --> 01:21:36.450
look like the idiots that you guys do to sickle.

1230
01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:44.830
Not comfortable screaming across the crowded fucking

1231
01:21:47.310 --> 01:21:52.040
<v 6>if I got you like a jacket with a badge that says sickle cell on it,</v>

1232
01:21:52.041 --> 01:21:55.670
would you wear that?
Definitely.
I would never wear that.

1233
01:21:57.140 --> 01:22:00.930
How about a hat?
Yeah.

1234
01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:06.200
What if it's a real nice jacket though?
Like a nice jacket or a nice hat.

1235
01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:13.070
I thought you just meant like a cheap wind breaker.
But if it,

1236
01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:18.290
what if it was like,
it was like a $1,500 leather,

1237
01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:23.110
you know,
Gucci Jacket and we just so sickle cell on there?
Yeah.

1238
01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:23.810
Embroider it.

1239
01:22:23.810 --> 01:22:26.290
<v 13>Yes.
That a badge.
Like I'd be sheriff.</v>

1240
01:22:28.690 --> 01:22:32.370
<v 6>Okay.
That's pretty cool.
We got to get that for him.
Christmas is right around.</v>

1241
01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:36.630
Um,
do you remember Vinnie Jones?
No,

1242
01:24:37.690 --> 01:24:41.860
Vinnie Jones was a,
a British footballer,

1243
01:24:42.190 --> 01:24:46.930
right as we would call him a soccer player.
Um,

1244
01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:51.400
and here he is in a scene from the movie snatch.

1245
01:24:51.970 --> 01:24:53.520
Oddly enough.
Okay.

1246
01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:59.170
<v 7>That's him right there with like the big mug.</v>

1247
01:25:02.590 --> 01:25:05.470
<v 6>Great Movie Guy Richie as you mentioned.</v>

1248
01:25:12.570 --> 01:25:13.403
<v 7>Hmm.</v>

1249
01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:25.470
<v 14>You don't have to second folks</v>

1250
01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:30.800
<v 6>guys good though.
Oh,
he's amazing.
Um,
that's how good I am too.
So second,</v>

1251
01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:34.420
but the funny thing is he's known for being,
you know,
he was uh,
like I said,

1252
01:26:34.421 --> 01:26:38.050
well known,
not just soccer player footballer,

1253
01:26:38.710 --> 01:26:42.790
but he was one of like the,
you know,
intimidators aggressive types on the field.

1254
01:26:43.090 --> 01:26:46.390
Fuck people up,
you know.
So anyways,

1255
01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:48.790
I guess now he's doing some coaching or something.

1256
01:26:49.570 --> 01:26:51.850
It's like he's coaching and we're trying to see where he's coaching here.

1257
01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:56.710
See if the leads,
anyway,
there's a video of him,

1258
01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:59.950
given what it looks like.
Obviously people are younger than him.

1259
01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:03.510
He's coaching them up.
Like what the fuck was that?
Oh God,

1260
01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:09.030
<v 14>code.
It's the fucking decisions.
Uh,
Santa Monica.</v>

1261
01:27:09.550 --> 01:27:11.620
Oh,
she was a boy.
He stood in front of you there,
mate.

1262
01:27:11.970 --> 01:27:16.200
Why not say you put his fucking do you want,
it's 90 degrees.

1263
01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:21.690
It's,
it's decisions easy there.
Then we can come out here.

1264
01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:24.030
Then we can go there and then we shuffle it over.

1265
01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:29.610
But you sold a bad decision then are you can't tell me you'll fix for free.

1266
01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:33.270
You ain't want to fucking rule dot gates was on my bucket of a sudden.
You'll go,

1267
01:27:33.271 --> 01:27:33.681
no idea.

1268
01:27:33.681 --> 01:27:37.120
Here's all the how bullets for certain roles coming in here and going bang up

1269
01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:39.960
that bike there.
You'll find the fucking front one in.

1270
01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:41.490
I'll put it in the game too long,
Danny,

1271
01:27:41.491 --> 01:27:45.390
for this politics over fucking winning or fucking get off.

1272
01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:48.000
I'll get someone who can fucking have a challenge.

1273
01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:51.600
<v 6>Hello?
It's like he's coaching.
What is this high school I had?</v>

1274
01:27:51.810 --> 01:27:54.520
So could you imagine this guys,
your coach,
you're like,
wait a minute.

1275
01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:55.960
You're the guy from fucking statue

1276
01:27:56.580 --> 01:28:00.020
<v 14>that coming straight through.
Yeah.
And the big fellow,
the off color fed up.</v>

1277
01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:04.340
He ain't a bad fucking player.
Oh.
Beside me.
My fucking midfield.

1278
01:28:04.530 --> 01:28:07.460
I love it because at least he can pass with fucking blue shirt.

1279
01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:12.590
<v 6>Blue Shirt.
I like to take a pass her fuck a blue shirt.</v>

1280
01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:15.710
Ash Coaches.
I love it.
Cursing coaches for sure.

1281
01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:18.880
<v 14>Correct.
Fucking Pawson all over the place.
I don't want to,</v>

1282
01:28:19.210 --> 01:28:23.950
don't waste my fucking time on a Sunday,
but Tom in here and when can it off?

1283
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:26.720
<v 6>Why can it are there on a Sunday?</v>

1284
01:28:29.610 --> 01:28:33.120
<v 14>Oh,
you caught Paul six fucking yards to a fucking yellow shirt.</v>

1285
01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:37.350
You'll think you fucking know the fucking status until you've composed fucking

1286
01:28:37.351 --> 01:28:39.660
10 yards.
Then fucking listen to me.

1287
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.760
<v 6>Hmm.</v>

1288
01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:45.480
<v 14>I like it.
You will let us come in and then you fucking all it's got excuses.</v>

1289
01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:49.200
Don't fit that have been at the level,
the highest level you can get.

1290
01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:54.060
I can see you as fucking cig in or can see that old nearly run Daniella

1291
01:28:54.061 --> 01:28:57.000
concealed at oldest son's in yours in his eyes is it

1292
01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:02.070
might a fucking Sunday morning pub.
I look fucking good

1293
01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:08.700
looking around here right now.
I would have money on them,
right?

1294
01:29:08.850 --> 01:29:12.660
All you lot sure there's,
there's my prediction.
My money's on them.

1295
01:29:13.170 --> 01:29:14.060
Unless you Wayne,

1296
01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:19.300
come fucking pull yourself out in the fucking bed and fucking get in there and

1297
01:29:19.951 --> 01:29:24.951
fucking work hard and when the fuck in bulk and pass the ball or see a Olin

1298
01:29:25.591 --> 01:29:26.550
fucking training.

1299
01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:30.780
<v 6>This is a,
I think it was the halftime speech.
I know what it was.
Yeah.</v>

1300
01:29:30.781 --> 01:29:31.614
I think it's the APP

1301
01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:35.950
<v 14>breakdown stock or do you know spit?
Oh boy.
Yeah,
that's fucking insurance balls.</v>

1302
01:29:35.951 --> 01:29:36.880
Little balls in there.

1303
01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:41.210
You're the fucking best player on this side because you get in my fucking voice.

1304
01:29:41.211 --> 01:29:46.090
Jail.
Fuck you played it one.
Now it play one in on this.

1305
01:29:46.091 --> 01:29:46.924
Fucking it there.

1306
01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:51.430
<v 6>What is this from is so good.
I really love it.
You really,
really love it.</v>

1307
01:29:52.090 --> 01:29:54.850
I love,
I could watch just clips of that.

1308
01:29:55.450 --> 01:29:57.670
You could tell that he does really give a shit though.
That's,

1309
01:29:57.671 --> 01:29:58.930
that's why it's red.
Yeah.

1310
01:29:59.050 --> 01:30:03.070
Don't you wish somebody could come in and shout at you after bad standups?
No.

1311
01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:04.840
Cause I hear the voice in my head already.

1312
01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:10.260
I know I have that voice for my standup shit most days during the day.

1313
01:30:10.450 --> 01:30:14.650
I know you're fucking shit.
The internal coach.
Yeah.
Internal coach is like,

1314
01:30:15.070 --> 01:30:18.760
I know.
You think that's a fucking good punchline here.
A piece of shit.
Yeah.

1315
01:30:18.910 --> 01:30:22.170
I Open Microsoft.
Better fucking punchline is here.
You find out soccer.

1316
01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:23.321
Isn't that terrible?

1317
01:30:23.321 --> 01:30:26.290
Do you think most people's inner voices or that horrible mine?
Mine's whole.

1318
01:30:26.291 --> 01:30:28.150
I think a lot of stand ups for sure.

1319
01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:31.060
I think that's one thing we definitely have in common with other comics.

1320
01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:35.830
Self-Loathing intense.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Yeah,
I think so too.
I think I got it.

1321
01:30:35.831 --> 01:30:39.760
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
I used to fuck her.
Fuck.
Oh Shit.
Fuck Shit.

1322
01:30:39.930 --> 01:30:43.390
No fucking soccer.
Should we roll?
Which we do you want to do a dental lab date?

1323
01:30:43.391 --> 01:30:47.080
Which should we do?
Um,
yeah,
I liked them.
I haven't had one in a long time.

1324
01:30:47.130 --> 01:30:52.030
I think we got to find another dentist,
man.
We're moving.
What's going on?
Fuck.

1325
01:30:52.031 --> 01:30:56.410
Oh,
he's open pictures of myself on accident.
An accident.
You know,

1326
01:30:56.411 --> 01:31:01.150
you wanted to say,
I don't want to see that shit.
I love looking at me.
God,

1327
01:31:01.170 --> 01:31:02.890
it's the worst.
Here we go.

1328
01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:07.680
I will say [inaudible] doing this show and that's Ebro I'm,

1329
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:10.450
I'm used to hearing my shitty voice.
Yeah.
You know,

1330
01:31:10.451 --> 01:31:13.090
in the beginning I couldn't even listen.
No,
wait,
why don't you give me the,

1331
01:31:13.091 --> 01:31:16.070
would you rather instead?
Oh,
this is silly.
It's just silly.
Yeah.

1332
01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:22.273
<v 15>Drink</v>

1333
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:24.110
<v 7>the top layer.</v>

1334
01:31:28.770 --> 01:31:29.603
Chunk,

1335
01:31:32.450 --> 01:31:36.380
the urine homeless men.
There's times by my buttons

1336
01:31:38.670 --> 01:31:40.710
have sex with your sister.
They,

1337
01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:45.500
the face grandmother walks on you masturbating.

1338
01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:50.680
Never have another orgasm.
Trying to play,

1339
01:31:50.890 --> 01:31:52.710
trying to play.
Would you rather?

1340
01:31:57.460 --> 01:31:58.270
All right.

1341
01:31:58.270 --> 01:32:00.250
<v 6>This one's a little subtle.</v>

1342
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:04.600
<v 2>It's not gross.
It's not,
you know,
would you rather eat calm or shit?</v>

1343
01:32:04.601 --> 01:32:09.370
Like it's more nuance.
So you have to pay attention to campaign listening.
Yeah.

1344
01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:12.670
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
What'd you rather?

1345
01:32:13.690 --> 01:32:18.670
Everywhere you go,
everywhere meetings,
you're on the airplane,

1346
01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:23.200
you're in the hotel,
you're on tour.
Everything.

1347
01:32:23.201 --> 01:32:27.310
Everywhere you go you have to take bitsy.

1348
01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:31.300
So that means you got a service,
animal hair,
you got to get a note from a shrink.

1349
01:32:31.301 --> 01:32:32.230
It's your emotional needs.

1350
01:32:32.231 --> 01:32:37.231
Dog's already really bad and you demand that she has her own area in your

1351
01:32:37.421 --> 01:32:42.421
dressing room and she barks senselessly all the time and wakes you up in your

1352
01:32:42.911 --> 01:32:46.450
hotel room if she did this morning for no reason.
Yeah.

1353
01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:51.300
And you've got to be that guy that carries her a 10 pound Brussels Griffon.

1354
01:32:51.380 --> 01:32:55.900
Yeah,
it's,
it's your dog.
People are like,
this guy's an asshole.
You're an asshole.

1355
01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:57.940
Yeah.
Any,
it's embarrassing.

1356
01:32:57.941 --> 01:33:02.941
And people think you're fucking mental problems or same thing everywhere you go,

1357
01:33:03.730 --> 01:33:06.250
every city you go to,
everything you do,
do

1358
01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:08.890
<v 6>you do it?
Yeah.
With your mom.</v>

1359
01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:16.810
So easy just became so easy.
I mean I how this easy,

1360
01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:21.840
I commend you for like the thoughts involved and for giving it like a real,

1361
01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:28.480
you know,
a real go at,
at something interesting and different.

1362
01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:32.450
Um,
100% busy.

1363
01:33:36.270 --> 01:33:40.030
You know what happens is the bond between a dog and I will grow.

1364
01:33:41.950 --> 01:33:46.860
I'll be just more attached to her probably.
Yeah,
she'll probably,

1365
01:33:47.230 --> 01:33:50.230
she's going to bark all the time on planning your way into my act.

1366
01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:54.190
I was just like bring her on stage and yeah.
You know,
I'll just figure it out.

1367
01:33:54.370 --> 01:33:57.280
And she's small.
That's the one thing.
She's very small.
Yeah.

1368
01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:02.160
Even a busy shit is small,
you know,
bitsy p a small.
Yeah.
Easy to feed her at.

1369
01:34:02.170 --> 01:34:05.500
Easy to get her water.
That's embarrassing.
It is embarrassing.

1370
01:34:05.501 --> 01:34:08.860
And I'm walking around everywhere with my fucking dog.
10 pound little shit.

1371
01:34:08.861 --> 01:34:12.910
And you're this,
you know,
big dude and I dunno man.
I said,
but I do love the dog.

1372
01:34:12.970 --> 01:34:13.270
Of course,

1373
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:17.410
those of us and it is fun to have a companion and she is a great companion.

1374
01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:22.390
Love cuddles.
Yeah.
She loves belly scratches.
Yes.
Sweet,
adorable dog.

1375
01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:27.700
My mother would would drive me to either murder or suicide.

1376
01:34:27.790 --> 01:34:31.240
You know how much I love my mom.
Domain domain?
No.

1377
01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:33.370
What time is the plane leaving?

1378
01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:38.060
Can you imagine having to manage that?

1379
01:34:38.330 --> 01:34:43.330
Manage someone like that?
I have so much anxiety and I'm like,
Oh God.
I'd be like,

1380
01:34:43.331 --> 01:34:46.180
and then we're going here.
I'm diet.
I'm like,
I don't want to hear it.

1381
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:50.940
That's what I got to do.
Sorry,
what time is the show?
Do I sell your merch?

1382
01:34:52.150 --> 01:34:56.560
Yes.
I don't have a square reader.
Go get one.

1383
01:34:56.780 --> 01:35:00.980
How weird.
How do I sign?
When do I saw a mom?

1384
01:35:02.210 --> 01:35:04.740
I want to go to the casino.
Go get change.

1385
01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:09.960
I don't have no change dummy questions all the time.

1386
01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:14.030
Oh my God.
And we have,
then we'd go back.
No,

1387
01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:19.880
it's like traveling with a toddler.
It is once your parents get older,

1388
01:35:19.881 --> 01:35:21.680
especially ones who,
my mom already,

1389
01:35:21.681 --> 01:35:25.400
like she asked questions when I was a toddler.
Like she would be,

1390
01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:28.420
it would be insane.
It would be.
I'm really fucking,

1391
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:32.570
when you think about your parents just to generate and they get shittier and

1392
01:35:32.571 --> 01:35:36.590
Shittier.
Crazy.
And then you have to,
you know,
like we were taking,

1393
01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:40.580
we took Ellis out last night for dinner and he was sitting in a high chair in

1394
01:35:40.581 --> 01:35:41.540
the corner of my eye,

1395
01:35:41.541 --> 01:35:44.900
saw what looked like a stroller and I was going to look and go,
oh,

1396
01:35:44.901 --> 01:35:49.580
look at the other baby.
And it was an elderly person in a walker.
So,
you know,

1397
01:35:49.581 --> 01:35:53.320
it's interesting.
You start in a stroller,
you end in the stroller,
you know,

1398
01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:57.290
someone's pushing you around at the end of the day to,
um,
look,

1399
01:35:57.291 --> 01:35:59.480
we got to get going.
By the way,
don't forget,
uh,

1400
01:35:59.510 --> 01:36:03.980
patrion.com/mom put that shit.
Don't do shit.

1401
01:36:04.130 --> 01:36:07.610
Don't patrion.com/mom.
Um,

1402
01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:12.570
we had to take away a couple of tiers of rewards because,
uh,

1403
01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:14.870
just because of scheduling,
it's just too hard to pull them off.

1404
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:19.460
But there's a new episode that's up.
Um,
one,
is it up Friday?
Something like that.

1405
01:36:19.490 --> 01:36:22.890
Monday,
Sunday,
Saturday insurer the first.
So,
um,

1406
01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:25.580
thank you for all the Patriot and support and um,

1407
01:36:25.610 --> 01:36:27.890
thank you for listening to your mind.
What would you take?

1408
01:36:27.891 --> 01:36:32.430
You take the dog for sure.
Over your mom or your dad.

1409
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:33.830
Oh,
forget it.

1410
01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:38.310
I would take 10 dogs over either of my parents.
Yeah,

1411
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.590
yeah,
yeah.
Gosh,
my mom was a mess too.

1412
01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:46.220
She was a real moms.
Not easy to manage cray cray.
I seriously,

1413
01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:49.670
I would have to go to see a,
like a psychiatrist.

1414
01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:54.860
I have to get Medicare d after spending a week to 48 hours.

1415
01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:57.380
Makes me crazy.
My mother,
you know,
it's funny.
It was that bowling with her.

1416
01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:01.760
My Dad hated being with me too.
After a couple of days,
like in my aunt,

1417
01:37:01.770 --> 01:37:05.360
I remember the Miami thing.
Oh,
are you going to get out of here or something?

1418
01:37:05.970 --> 01:37:10.250
I thought we were hanging out.
He ain't saying an hour with me.
It's funny.
So I,

1419
01:37:10.251 --> 01:37:14.120
I couldn't do it.
No.
Very few people.
I could spend that much time with you.

1420
01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:17.150
My cousin Julie.
You Know Shawna,

1421
01:37:17.210 --> 01:37:20.720
Sarah Burns like few people in my life.
You can really do it.

1422
01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:23.810
I know they spend days and days.
I'm the same way.

1423
01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:27.730
You have to like Jenny Petland like people have grown up with basically family

1424
01:37:27.731 --> 01:37:31.560

Yeah,

Dude.
Things too.</v>

1444
01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:06.730

1445
01:39:06.731 --> 01:39:07.564
hands.
