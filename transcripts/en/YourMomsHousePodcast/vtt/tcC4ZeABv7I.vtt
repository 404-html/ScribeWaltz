Well.

2
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.383

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.730
<v 0>Oh,</v>

<v 2>all right,

5
00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:25.260
and here we go and aware we're off to this.

6
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.540
I just saw Fifo humping bitsy.
Very rare in this.
Doesn't happen a lot.

7
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.960
It doesn't happen.
You have a high libido.
We thought we had.
Absolutely not.

8
00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:35.810
We thought we had a genderless sex list.

9
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.980
Asexually asexual animal many years.
He was.

10
00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:42.570
We got his nuts off and he never heard anything.
Never.

11
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.700
But today I know we got him fixed.
Right then we got,
of course we did.

12
00:00:46.701 --> 00:00:49.430
Both of them are animals arrived to us fix.
No,
he did not.

13
00:00:49.431 --> 00:00:52.790
He arrived to us with these big black balls.
Oh,

14
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.260
remember he had big black nuts and gets a huge for his little body.

15
00:00:57.261 --> 00:00:59.800
He only weighs that's right because,
oh,
pants.

16
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.400
The first day that um,
we got FIFO.
He,

17
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.040
we,
he,
we walked him into our house and he was,
yeah.

18
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.130
<v 0>Hi.
I'm Payton Lafferty and fall.
Huh?</v>

19
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.580
<v 2>That's right.
True story shelter named him Peyton Lafferty.
Right.</v>

20
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.120
We had to change it and he,
oh,
he was like,
yeah,

21
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.180
I got these big black balls and I don't want you to suck on them.
We were like,

22
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:25.380
whoa.
They were so big.
And I remember he used to run and they would jangle.

23
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:29.430
It was actually very cute.
But no,
no.
He has no Bob,
no balls.

24
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:30.760
But he's just humping her.
He,

25
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.740
he gets anxious when other people are coming around.
Yeah.

26
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.950
I think she senses we're going to have a guest.
Yeah.
You think so?
Yeah.
No,

27
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:41.230
that's the only time he does it.
When he senses he,
it's chaos.

28
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.540
It's like when you are anxious or depressed and you masturbate compulsively,

29
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.240
or when you're on the road and you're depressed,
why are you telling everybody?

30
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.870
Yeah.
Isn't that everybody's thing?
Especially if you know,

31
00:01:51.871 --> 00:01:55.530
like a red heads coming over,
then it happens more.
You don't think so?
I think so.

32
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.490
He gets excited over that.
I think he knows.
Yeah.

33
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.750
He's a huge fan of the guy that's coming today.

34
00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:02.970
I know he watches all of his specials and yeah.

35
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.210
Big Huge Fan of ATC,
Eh,

You know,

37
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.190
so it's excite,
excite Amaz.
Anyways,

38
00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:21.890
where we had a lot to cover.
Let's um,
let's get into,
okay.
Yes,

39
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.610

Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Alright.
Alright.
You crazy.
Ball Hog and here we go.

40
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.550
Here we go.
The team did that like

41
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.750
<v 0>testable electronic capsule to monitor gas levels are not human god when it's</v>

42
00:02:34.751 --> 00:02:37.870
paired with a pocket size.
Let's see her and the mobile phone APP,

43
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.670
the till reports tail wind conditions in real time as it passes from the stomach

44
00:02:42.671 --> 00:02:46.600
to the colon.
Colon is Randy,

45
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.370
don't bring anyone in loving.

46
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.520
<v 1>You're welcome.
Welcome.
Welcome to your mom's house</v>

47
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.610
<v 2>Kabuki.
So yeah,</v>

48
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.280
I'm petting laugh on it about Baja bug.

49
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.230
That's my favorite series of all time.
I also like the name Peyton pay.

50
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:13.600
I laugh our day like it's such a white girl.

51
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.440
It's such a thing to make your more names.
I mean,
I know there's the old kind of,

52
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:21.640
wait a minute,
that's not her given God name.
You would never believe it,

53
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.010
but know your parents didn't destine you to become a pornography.

54
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.280
There's like three people that use their real name.
Yeah.

55
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.190
And everybody else obviously picks up performing name and the old joke,

56
00:03:35.191 --> 00:03:37.120
you know it was like you pick like the name,

57
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.480
your first street or something stupid.

58
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.890
I mean what have you had to go out there right now and pick up Horne name?

59
00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:48.790
Shit skiing,
easy to pronounce.
Easy to spell.
Easy.
Horrible,
horrible.

60
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:49.660
I'm such an idiot.

61
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:53.890
I should have changed my last name for like 15 years ago when they started stand

62
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:58.840
up,
but I couldn't find a suitable,
I just couldn't,
you know,
you could have,

63
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.590
I tried,
I wanted to be Christina Black,
but then there's Jack Black.

64
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.160
He was huge at the time.
Louis Black.
Oh right.
You know what I mean?

65
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:09.910
There's too many blacks like there was too many.
There are.
There are.

66
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.600
I know exactly what you mean.
There's just,
they're everywhere.

67
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.850
That coming into our cities,

68
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.070
there are too many people with that last name and that's what I wanted.
I just,

69
00:04:22.071 --> 00:04:25.640
I couldn't think of something.
What would you name me now if he like,

70
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.080
give me another name besides to go.

71
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.670
Obviously I can't do that cause we're not the fucking bobsy twins of comedy.

72
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.660
I know you,
I dunno.
So lame.
Uh,
Delilah dog hunt.
That'd be one.

73
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.580
We'll be talking about this ticket seller,
Christina,

74
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.100
if you were doing porn and they,

75
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.570
and they do that thing before you're,
you're seeing,
you're seeing the guy,

76
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.700
the guy's like,
hey babe,
you look super hot.
And you're like,

77
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.480
that's,
and he's like,
what's your name and your like,
Delilah.
Doug Kahn.
Good,

78
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.040
Whoa,
let's see this thing.
I mean,
that does Pique your interest.
Now,

79
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.140
if somebody texted me right now,
you've seen this,
uh,
Delilah dog hunt,

80
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.950
I'd be like,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
What?
Like,
yeah,
she's a do a porno.

81
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.490
She's pretty fucking crazy.
I'd be like,
yeah,
of course.

82
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.970
She named herself dog hunt.
That's,
that is the craziest,
yeah,
that's,

83
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.380
she's wild for sure.
It's a Laila dog hunt.

84
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.220
It's so funny that they,

85
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.640
that the porno industry still insists on calling it things like scenes or Phil.

86
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.270
I know,
I love it.
I love

87
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.500
language thing that they do is that they call people outside of its citizens.

88
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.040
Oh right.
We're do that in comedy.
I,
yeah,
I know.

89
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:49.930
But it's just funny to me that like,

90
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.800
cause there is usually we think of civilians,
you think of the military.

91
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.100
So I think of,
I think of porn people thinking of themselves as,

92
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:02.040
I'm like really sacrificing the cultural elite.
Yeah.

93
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.750
Well these regular civilians,
they don't know the kind of thing that we do.

94
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.270
We're special.
We don't know anything about fucking yet.
Nobody does.
Yeah.

95
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.620
Civilians,
I'm gonna shoot my scene today.
It does help.
So I gotta go to work.

96
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.730
It's all about,
so yeah,

97
00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:23.830
it's all psychological cause you've got to feel okay about being paid Lafferty.

98
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.570
The ball hog.
Yeah,
of course.
If you're like,

99
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.880
well I'm kind of technically so people around you normalize it.
Yes.

100
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.640
That's absolutely true.
Yeah.
So it's legitimize,

101
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.160
well I guess porn back of the day was showed in movie theaters,

102
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.990
which now you're just like,

103
00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:42.470
could you even imagine going to us sitting in a full theater,

104
00:06:42.471 --> 00:06:46.070
not jerking off like a whole room full of especially that now they have those

105
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:50.610
recliner chairs in theaters.
So it's like state of the art comfortable,
you know?

106
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.160
Yeah.
You can't have a blanket over,

107
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:56.530
you press a button to call the server and some of those exclusive theaters,

108
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.400
you know,
it'd be like,
I kind of need some more tissues.

109
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.740
You have to whisper.
I made a mess,
can I,
can I have the cup,

110
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:07.550
the cup cleaner?

111
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.430
But then they come cleaner will come around and wipe you off as he's just an old

112
00:07:10.431 --> 00:07:13.610
guy and you're like,
it's like it's not erotic.
You're like,
oh man.

113
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.030
I been gaining come for 48 years.

114
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.140
He's got a filthy rag and he uses the same rag on every word tea.
He's like,

115
00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:25.130
I came here,
I needed a job.
And they said,
Dean,
they come.

116
00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:28.380
And that's how I get my list here.

117
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.260
I think come cleaners gotta be the worst job in the world.
I did it.
Oh,

118
00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:37.810
that's right.
It's split.
I was a comm cleaner.
Yeah,

119
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.530
but not like,
not like in the movie theater.
No,
but it was nasty as fuck.

120
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.350
I did laundry where people just fun.
Um,
I had to mop the floor.

121
00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:52.880
The hot tub.
People know there was this place called splash,
relaxation,

122
00:07:52.881 --> 00:07:54.620
spa third street,

123
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:59.480
or watched this show blind date for some reason.

124
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.830
Excellent reference ended up at splash because I'll tell you why

125
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.290
it was monetary.
So what happened was,
so splash spa,

126
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.970
the relaxation spa.
So if you're,
you're unaware,
you go like,
oh,

127
00:08:13.971 --> 00:08:16.310
maybe that's a spa.
That's what I thought when I went in there,

128
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:21.470
because that's what they're calling at a spa.
I imagined I go like,
I like spa.

129
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.980
That's when I first got here.
You know,
I like to relax,
to relax.

130
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.780
I like steam rooms.
You know,
like maybe I can get a discount on a massage.

131
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.970
So I figured,
you know,
I'll be like a towel boy.
Like the guys you see at a spa.

132
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.360
Sure.
I'm dressed up and wearing their little thing like can I get you a glass of

133
00:08:38.361 --> 00:08:42.730
water or something?
So I get there.
Um,

134
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.690
and the guy gives us a tour.

135
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:48.410
I was with my friend chuck and we go in there and he's like,
oh,

136
00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:53.090
it's hourly rentals of themed rooms.
So there's like the Barcelona,

137
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:58.480
I remember that garden Greek room and basically Greco Roman.
Yes.

138
00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.430
A stupid call on is behind them with has like plants,

139
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.060
paintings on the wall and it has a hot tub and a bed.

140
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:10.800
And so what it does do is it,
it was just to rent now they would,

141
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:15.480
they would lean on the fact that this is like a date spot because there were

142
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:20.010
some people that wanted to do that as like a date,
like an exciting,

143
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.500
I'll just go to this,
but could you,
okay.
And this is my,

144
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.990
my thought always on blind date with Roger Lodge.

145
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:29.460
There are two horrendous first dates for me personally.
Number one,

146
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.010
the workout date.
Terrible.

147
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.990
Meet me at the gym and we'll put on our gym clothes and sweat.
Terrible.

148
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.310
Number two,
the Jacuzzi,
the Public Jacuzzi Day.
It's crazy.

149
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.620
I mean that's television.
It's growth.

150
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.370
They knew it was good TV and when I said monetary because it was cheap for a TV

151
00:09:47.371 --> 00:09:48.280
production and they would,

152
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:53.300
I'm sure they were thrilled to have the publicity splash on every episode about

153
00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.520
what should happen is people would come in and splash,
rent the rooms,

154
00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.110
but the big thing was hookers.
Right.
Clearly so because it's also,

155
00:10:01.111 --> 00:10:04.640
where else can you go for an hour?
Yeah.
Now when I got,

156
00:10:04.641 --> 00:10:06.600
when the guy was hiring us and training us,

157
00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:11.400
he told us people will come in and they'll ask you about getting a hooker.

158
00:10:11.401 --> 00:10:14.370
Here it goes.
You cannot tell them.

159
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.230
You have to say like we don't do anything like that.

160
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.820
Like we don't provide the hook.
Right.
But you can bring,
you can bring a hooker,

161
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.400
but like you can't be like,
hey,
can you help them arrange a hooker to come here?

162
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:28.920
So man,
I,
I mean we lasted chuck last like three days.

163
00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:32.850
I laughed like two weeks.
What kept you hanging in?

164
00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:36.840
Like what was honestly,
it was just that I had a job.
Yeah.
So I was like,

165
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.100
but then like it was one of those things psychologically you break down because

166
00:10:41.101 --> 00:10:43.560
it's gross and yeah,

167
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.310
so they used to have this policy that you will have to go,

168
00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.690
you have to go to the room,
you have to go to the room,
uh,

169
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:54.770
when all parties are there.
But imagine if you're meeting a hooker,

170
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.610
let's say you set it up and you don't like,
you're nervous,
right?

171
00:10:58.611 --> 00:11:01.730
You're embarrassed that this is happening.
So I would see guys coming in,

172
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.940
they were like,
I'll take the whatever room.
I'm like,
okay.
And they're like,

173
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:09.230
I'd like to go there.
And I'd be like,
well,
this is the other person here.
Uh,
no,

174
00:11:09.231 --> 00:11:12.620
they're going to meet me here.
I'm like,
are you have to wait until they get here?

175
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.020
And they would get like,
they're like,
I don't want to wait.

176
00:11:15.021 --> 00:11:18.170
I just want to go in there.
I'm like,
I'm sorry.
It's policy.
Ah,

177
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:22.970
you'd see them just kind of like,
man,
I can't,
there's nothing I can do.
Like,
can,

178
00:11:22.971 --> 00:11:26.020
I really don't want to be like waiting here and like,
I'm sorry.
That's like,

179
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:30.710
that's the policy.
And then like a couple of times I would see,

180
00:11:30.711 --> 00:11:33.230
you know,
another guy would walk in and go,

181
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.370
Kevin Are you Mario?

182
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.050
And they'd be like,
okay.
And then you look at me like,
come on.
Okay.

183
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:47.290
And then I would take them to the room one time two guys or one guy had two guys

184
00:11:47.391 --> 00:11:52.010
meet him there and they were in that room six minutes,
you know,

185
00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.220
pay Lafferty,
hey Lafferty in there.

186
00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.160
And there's like three use condoms of course.

187
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.390
But there was no actual policy at splash prohibiting.
No,

188
00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:06.391
of course walking in the hot tubs of body fluid being expelled in the water.

189
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.700
I mean that was encouraged that that was,
that was the whole point of splash.

190
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:10.720
But we just couldn't,

191
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.310
you couldn't get the hookers for them that you could facilitate the meeting kind

192
00:12:14.311 --> 00:12:15.910
of.
I mean,
you're just like,
you're renting a room.

193
00:12:15.911 --> 00:12:17.140
Like I don't care what you do in there,

194
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:22.510
but a room that's also really unhygienic and really dangerous if everyone's

195
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:25.090
coming in the whirlpool ev every day.

196
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:29.850
I mean how many loads of Tj's were in those jacuzzis and then now you're going

197
00:12:29.851 --> 00:12:31.370
to rent that Jacuzzi and second.

198
00:12:31.371 --> 00:12:36.371
So unhygienic system for like chlorine and measuring the Ph balance.

199
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.470
Then we had this mop,
you had to mop,

200
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.500
cleaning thing and then you had to

201
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.030
bunch up all the linens and wash that.

202
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.330
I remember one time after every quarter,
no matter what,

203
00:12:52.331 --> 00:12:56.120
even if they like didn't use the bed,
sure you still had to do it.
Um,

204
00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:01.660
I remember one time this couple came in that was clearly like a real couple and

205
00:13:01.661 --> 00:13:03.780
the guy was like place nasty.
I kept,

206
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:07.620
he kept saying that and a nasty as hell and she was like,
no,

207
00:13:07.621 --> 00:13:10.000
it's going to be fun.
She was trying to have like a romantic night.

208
00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:15.970
I take them to their room and like a minute later the guy calls the front desk

209
00:13:16.721 --> 00:13:19.270
and I go,
yeah,
he's like,
it placed nasties helmet.

210
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:24.630
So I go down there and there was a pubic hair and I don't know in the sink or

211
00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:28.090
something worse.
And I was like,
oh,
I had to pretend.
I was like,
aw man.

212
00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.250
So I immediately cleaned it up and he was like,
no,
Nah,
of course.

213
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:38.250
And I'm assuming that's why splash got shut down was probably prostitution and I

214
00:13:38.561 --> 00:13:42.080
dunno,
I think he actually probably just had a good run,
you know,
that place was,

215
00:13:42.081 --> 00:13:44.950
he was,
it wasn't old,
but I mean,
when I moved here,

216
00:13:44.951 --> 00:13:49.840
which was over more than 15 years ago,
he had all white hair and he was,

217
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.780
I had to be like in his sixties or something.
Oh,
I mean,

218
00:13:52.781 --> 00:13:56.020
splash has been around probably,

219
00:13:56.021 --> 00:13:59.620
I don't know if it got closed for that as much as it might have been.
Just the,

220
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:05.620
um,
growing up here,
splash was the punchline.
Like you take your day to splash.

221
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:09.090
Everybody knew that some nasty shit was going down.
You know,

222
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.800
that shows you when you're new somewhere,
you don't know.
Of course.
Yeah.

223
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.110
I just walked in there like,
I like spa.

224
00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.350
I wish I would've known you right when you moved here,

225
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:21.100
God told you to run from splash.
Yeah.
It was so gross.

226
00:14:21.101 --> 00:14:25.990
He was such a weird guy.
Clearly.
Could you imagine what a rough business to run.

227
00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:30.240
He boasted about his friendship with Hugh Hefner and you know,

228
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.980
parties at the playboy mansion and all that stuff.

229
00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:38.110
Douchey old guy and the girl out.
Oh yeah.
He's like the run down.

230
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:42.970
I get a lot of broads.
Oh yeah.
Gross.
Anyways,

231
00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.640
we saw a movie.
Yeah,

232
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.780
I wanted to have fun the other day and we made the mistake of seeing the movie

233
00:14:49.781 --> 00:14:54.170
the post.
Yeah.
It wasn't a fun movie.
I don't know why I thought it would be like,

234
00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:57.380
it's a well constructed movie.
I'm like all the,

235
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.680
all the moving parts of a story are there as well.

236
00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:07.550
You know,
it's well put together,
but it just,
I just didn't find it that exciting.

237
00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:10.280
I felt like I felt like,

238
00:15:10.281 --> 00:15:15.270
am I a dumb person because I'm not riveted by what's happening here.
Oh,

239
00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.750
okay.
We can't,
we gotta.

240
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.860
We gotta stop for a moment and,
uh,
get our guests.

241
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:25.820
Will you make a note of where we stopped this conversation so we can talk

242
00:15:25.821 --> 00:15:28.610
further about it?
Thank you.
Um,
all right.

243
00:15:28.611 --> 00:15:33.590
We had to stop really quickly to get let our guest in and he's here now.

244
00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.940
I know many of you know him from his,
uh,

245
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.710
many stand up comedy specials,

246
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:44.180
his hit show VH ones.
I love the 80 strikes back

247
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:51.530
fart is for family on Netflix.
It's old Billy red nuts.

248
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:56.900
Bill Burr.
What's going on here?
Third time,
second second,

249
00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:57.771
I think a second.

250
00:15:57.771 --> 00:16:02.630
He came back in the old school and I'm now here.

251
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:07.220
Thanks for coming over man.
Yeah,
lots of change with you.
You've,
you've uh,

252
00:16:07.221 --> 00:16:09.740
I remember in the silver lake days you were just a young,

253
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:13.700
a young little man and now you're a younger person.
I wasn't,

254
00:16:13.701 --> 00:16:15.130
I was well into my forties.

255
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:20.960
I'm just developing very slowly and delightful young man.
I'll take that.

256
00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:25.340
I remember,
I like that a 43 year old I met bill.
Um,

257
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.340
I don't know if I mentioned this on the last one,
but I met,
I met him in person,

258
00:16:28.341 --> 00:16:31.100
I'd seen him on Chappelle show and you know,

259
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.940
central and like at the height of its popularity.

260
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:38.500
And then I was at Melrose and this is like,
I don't know what it was.

261
00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:42.890
It was the year that you moved here and he was at the bar and I just started

262
00:16:42.891 --> 00:16:47.750
talking to him and he was like,
uh,
yeah,
you know,
I walked here and I go,
oh,

263
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:52.640
from wearing,
he goes,
silver lake walked here from silver lake.

264
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.900
He was like,
yeah,
it's kind of far.
And I go,
yeah,
uh,

265
00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:01.640
and I still in a New York sorta see.
Yeah,
of course.
Which makes sense.

266
00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.470
And he goes,
uh,
you know,

267
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:05.660
plus I wanted to be able to see a little bit of the city.

268
00:17:05.661 --> 00:17:09.560
It's just like so much of it,
it's just like,
you know,
just go,
go,
go,
go,

269
00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:12.260
go somebody up your acid,
you're trying to drive with something.
So,

270
00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:15.110
and I gave him a ride back to his house and I was like,

271
00:17:15.111 --> 00:17:19.730
this is way far for a walk.
And then right before he got out of the car,
he goes,

272
00:17:19.731 --> 00:17:23.990
uh,
do you want to see me come?
And I was like,
alright.

273
00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:28.370
And He,
you know,
he just jerked off and then he got out of the car.

274
00:17:28.371 --> 00:17:32.780
This is a me too story.
What's the thing is like I was,
I was,
I wasn't effecting,

275
00:17:32.781 --> 00:17:36.530
you weren't saying that.
I'm saying that.
I was like,
that's pretty cool man.

276
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.670
Then he goes,
that's the secret to be to being good at Sam.
Or I told you,

277
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.750
too many comics listened to me and now they're all getting in trouble.

278
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:50.100
But that is the secret for all.
You Young,
uh,
open miker is out there.

279
00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.290
<v 3>Kind of start doing it more.
Um,</v>

280
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:57.500
we discovered that there's a weirdest story anybody's ever said that like made

281
00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:02.970
me uncomfortable from the beginning.
Now it's the serial killer,

282
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.240
right tone,
like his complete lack of emotional scale.

283
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.680
This happened.
You know what?

284
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.640
And I know building missing from his stories is sound of somebody gagged,

285
00:18:14.641 --> 00:18:18.520
screaming in the other room.
Right now I know that you,

286
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:25.290
and I know that you suspect that my husband is a psycho.
I've heard,

287
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.640
I've heard about,
yeah,
no,
I know.
And I've,

288
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.730
and I've been trying to prove this on this show for a loss like you don't have

289
00:18:32.731 --> 00:18:37.140
is like bud,
this bud light.
There's like psycho and psycho light.
Like,
he just,

290
00:18:37.141 --> 00:18:41.760
he's not the,
uh,
the high calorie one that can't get married and have kids.
Yes.

291
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:45.240
But if you,
if his thoughts were a movie.
Yeah,
definitely.

292
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.900
NC 17 he's a functioning psychopath.
Yeah.

293
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:52.800
You know why?
Because when I started dating him ball,
and this is a true story,

294
00:18:52.801 --> 00:18:56.670
when I started dating Tom Segura back in oh five,
there were red flags,

295
00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:01.940
little stuff like when we were little dead animals behind your apartment

296
00:19:03.241 --> 00:19:07.570
building.
I remember,
you know,
in the beginning you're all lovey Dovey,

297
00:19:07.571 --> 00:19:12.090
D and a,
and he'd be like,
I like you so much.
I like you so much.

298
00:19:12.091 --> 00:19:16.490
I just want to gouge your eyes out.
I want to squish your face and kill you and,

299
00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:21.180
and put a sledge hammer in your hand and you're like,
I love you so much.

300
00:19:21.181 --> 00:19:25.000
I just want to smash your God damn head in.
I'm being serious.

301
00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:29.010
If somebody said that about my kid,
my time,
oh my God,
look at those feet.

302
00:19:29.011 --> 00:19:33.480
I just want to cut them off.
And it was just like fucking lunatics.
Yeah.

303
00:19:33.481 --> 00:19:35.640
Right there.
You can't,
you can't be with a person like that.

304
00:19:35.641 --> 00:19:38.460
So we need a safe house.

305
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:44.130
We got a guest room.
Well I'm two kids deep now.
I think I used to say like,

306
00:19:44.131 --> 00:19:46.800
I want to put your head through that.
Yeah,
yeah.

307
00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:51.390
But I was like as an expression of love and there were other things too,

308
00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:54.090
like cause you don't like love and you hate that and makes you feel weak or

309
00:19:54.091 --> 00:19:57.390
something that you want to violently take it out on her.
That's exactly right.

310
00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:02.390
Exactly right.
Yeah.
I mean,
you know,
it worked out.
It did actually.

311
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.370
You're frustrated that you knew you had no control over the love that you had

312
00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:08.640
for your wife.
So then you just,
you starting to feel trapped.

313
00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:13.050
I think it was more of like didn't know how to express how good I felt,
you know?

314
00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:17.230
So I thought,
no,
no,
he really just tried.

315
00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:18.910
He tried to play like dimwitted they're

316
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.530
calculated you,
everything you need to be to make in this business.

317
00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.040
You just can't keep creative and just be floating around like,

318
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.550
Oh that tickles my artistic fantasy.
You have to have a plan,

319
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.690
but you've got to leave your friends and family behind.
This is all these things.

320
00:20:36.691 --> 00:20:39.100
When Oprah talks about women,
oh,
you're going to do this,
you got,

321
00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:43.050
she leaves all that part out.
Yeah.
You're going to miss your children growing up.

322
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:48.130
Get to the top of the mountain and you're going to be alone and have no real

323
00:20:48.131 --> 00:20:51.870
friends.
And there's a reason I never had children as Oprah because I,

324
00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.770
I don't give,
I don't have time for that shit.

325
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.950
I wanted to fucking take over the world for a second.
Yeah.

326
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.060
We were swinging the sickle with both hands.
You mean you can't,

327
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:04.990
you can't carry a kid.
No,
I agree.
Yeah.

328
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.360
The other side of it,
of course you're talking about me,

329
00:21:07.361 --> 00:21:10.690
is that there's a lot of people writing in that bill is,
you know,

330
00:21:10.691 --> 00:21:15.360
a much more profound psycho.
No,
never seen it.
No.

331
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:19.870
No.
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't disagree with tight,
but I think that like,

332
00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.860
he fits the,
uh,
it's,
I get away with it being a redhead,

333
00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:29.150
so everybody thinks,
oh,
oop,
Ron Howard,
they think like,
oh yeah,

334
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.200
the guy who doesn't get the girl,
the,
uh,
the fucking awkward.

335
00:21:32.201 --> 00:21:34.630
That's what they think him.
He looks like,
you know,

336
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:39.190
every time there's a fucking serial killer that is the exact hairline when they

337
00:21:39.191 --> 00:21:43.470
lead them out,
that is CSC,
exact fucking hairline.

338
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:48.850
Well,
and also,
you know,
I'm a sweet guy,
Bill.
That's why you're an extra psycho.

339
00:21:48.851 --> 00:21:52.780
And Bill deals with his anger on stage,
right?
You've got act.

340
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.450
It's parts of your act.
They're very,
the punching of the muffins,

341
00:21:55.451 --> 00:21:59.830
it's very aggressive.
He deals with his anger creatively.
You suppress,

342
00:21:59.831 --> 00:22:02.730
you pushed down,
you push down.
You start,
you're doing is you're,

343
00:22:02.731 --> 00:22:05.020
you're looking at me on stage as if that's who I am.

344
00:22:05.021 --> 00:22:08.170
Like you got to talk to my wife.
My wife lives with me and I,
yeah,

345
00:22:08.171 --> 00:22:12.370
I'm a fucking lunatic.
Which you express the rage.
It comes out creatively,

346
00:22:12.371 --> 00:22:15.860
at least is what it also comes out in his personal life.
Are you,
do you,

347
00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:20.750
are you angry at home over the dumbest shit these stupidest.

348
00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:25.030
What got you last time?
The hiatus.
It's blind,
right?
Like I see red,

349
00:22:25.031 --> 00:22:29.440
so I don't remember just dumb shit.
Dumb Shit.
I don't remember.

350
00:22:29.441 --> 00:22:33.200
I go to a garage and it's locked and I don't have my keys.
Yeah.

351
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:37.720
And I'll just scream of course.
And 1.3 houses down,

352
00:22:37.721 --> 00:22:40.510
they'll hear it.
Can you imagine,
by the way,
she has this trait.

353
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.360
If you think I'm bad,
what?

354
00:22:43.361 --> 00:22:45.910
How you would be with Mr Burger over here.

355
00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:50.470
So if I drop my phone,
I go,
God dammit.
Right?

356
00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:55.280
Like oh shit.
She goes,
what happened?
I dropped my phone.
Oh yeah.

357
00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:59.710
No you wouldn't last.
Cause I had so much anger in my house growing up.

358
00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.650
Everybody's fucking yelling all the time and I don't like it.

359
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.970
So why did you pick this lunatic?
Cause he doesn't rage.
It's,

360
00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.550
it's under the SURPI suppresses it?
Yeah.
And then he'll let it out.

361
00:23:09.551 --> 00:23:12.940
A one big spurt.
Like I'll,
I'll really piss them off and then he'll let it,

362
00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:16.150
let me have it.
Let you have it.
It takes like a while.

363
00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:18.670
What does let you have helped the dog?
You poke the dog.

364
00:23:18.671 --> 00:23:22.000
You poke the dog and the dog eventually.
I don't bite really though.

365
00:23:22.001 --> 00:23:24.760
I mean I bite like what?

366
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.370
I'm sure I'm way worse than him.

367
00:23:27.371 --> 00:23:32.000
I don't know what you guys bicker through when you say,
of course,
God dammit.

368
00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:36.040
Right?
When you forget the keys,
what's the of course is,
oh,
that is,
that is the,

369
00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:39.790
that's the movie trailer.
That's not the movie of me getting angry.
I mean this,

370
00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:41.590
it's Haaretz.
Yeah,

371
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:46.460
you just caressed I have like a string that's almost like Carlin's seven dirty

372
00:23:46.461 --> 00:23:48.710
words.
Like I,
I can't,
I can't do it unless I'm mad.

373
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:53.140
I know Qantas in their cock sucker.
Yeah.
What about dog?

374
00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:56.910
Couldn't fucking cock sucking mother fucking cunt.
Like I'll do that.
Yeah,

375
00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:02.740
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I go,
I go mother fucking God.
Yeah.
A lot of fun.

376
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:04.190
God mother fucking damn it.

377
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.200
But there's something about pronouncing the whole world,

378
00:24:06.201 --> 00:24:11.120
it takes the edge off motherfucking Goddamn Cock sucker.
Yeah.
It just,

379
00:24:11.121 --> 00:24:13.970
it takes it away.
You know,
it's good for you.
Right?

380
00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.870
There's studies about people who like run by angry scientists,

381
00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:20.530
second sick or their wife's bitching at them.
No,

382
00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.810
I got a lot of work to do on myself that I'm turning 50 this year,

383
00:24:23.811 --> 00:24:25.340
so I'm already on the other side of it.

384
00:24:25.341 --> 00:24:30.110
So maybe the last three hunting 50 so maybe the last three holes of the golf

385
00:24:30.111 --> 00:24:34.550
course.
He's like off.
Wait,
do you play golf?
No.
Okay.
I just want to know.

386
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:38.840
All right.
Do you ever seen a shrink before a therapy?
I went to therapy.

387
00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.830
But you stopped going.
Well after a while it's just like,
well,
you know,

388
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:46.190
I've told all the bad stories and I'm always gonna have problems.

389
00:24:46.191 --> 00:24:48.890
It's just becoming like this,
you know,
lifelong car payment.

390
00:24:48.891 --> 00:24:51.950
Now to have to come over here and be like,
well this happened.

391
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.990
My garage door was locked and it's just,

392
00:24:53.991 --> 00:24:57.200
I just felt like a pussy after while like when are you going to just,
you know,

393
00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:02.120
get off this fucking couch here and go live your life and stop having to talk to

394
00:25:02.121 --> 00:25:04.070
this fucking person.
Yeah.

395
00:25:04.071 --> 00:25:08.830
You're full of anger because you don't flog yourself for for being voce.

396
00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.630
Would you stop it?
Like you have some sort of psychology degree,

397
00:25:11.631 --> 00:25:15.740
10 years in therapy.
I've watched the football for 40 years.

398
00:25:15.741 --> 00:25:19.780
I shouldn't be somebody coach.
I agree.
Yeah.

399
00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:25.130
Then you're going to like super impose your fucking issues of the psychos in

400
00:25:25.131 --> 00:25:28.760
your life onto me.
It's like fucking alcoholics.
They always like,
oh yeah,

401
00:25:28.761 --> 00:25:31.100
you're drinking,
you're drinking.
You must be like me,

402
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:34.970
the whole world because they're addicts.
So they're so fucking self involved.

403
00:25:34.971 --> 00:25:38.020
The whole world has to be like them.
Yes,
I agree.

404
00:25:38.021 --> 00:25:40.250
I'm so glad you're here to put Christine and her place.

405
00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:44.710
I'm the worst.
I'm the worst.
I know.

406
00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.380
And you think you're a fucking shrink right now.
I mean,
let the guy,

407
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:52.880
we get eight sometimes me join.
I want to ask bill something.

408
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.230
Is this funny to you?

409
00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.713
<v 0>Jesus.</v>

410
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:11.230
<v 3>So this guys,
yeah.
What's going on?
Well,
he's backing into a mechanic.
It's</v>

411
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.210
<v 0>garage,
uh Oh.</v>

412
00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:20.380
Uh,
another part of the world.
So he's just kind of,
you know,

413
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:24.580
he's taking his time
kind of getting it aligned.

414
00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:35.200
Jesus fucking

415
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:42.800
off.

416
00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:48.610
It's funny cause y'all laughing
dude.

417
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.330
<v 3>Somebody's got to teach set person a little throttle control.</v>

418
00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.640
Look how concerned he is.

419
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:05.310
He looked.
Yeah.
Life.
Life is cheap.
And that shop,
Huh?
Oh Man.
He just walked away.

420
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.630
Like I took it like a champ though,
Huh?
Yeah,
pretty much,
man.
No,
but funny,

421
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:14.120
I saw you laughing.
It's funny cause it shouldn't have happened.
It's unexpected.

422
00:27:14.121 --> 00:27:15.930
You Die.
Yeah.
You know,

423
00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:21.010
and it's so funny to think that that again,
part of the,
uh,

424
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:23.840
I think the guy in the red show be a little more concerned unless he was the guy

425
00:27:23.841 --> 00:27:27.650
driving.
I think he was the guy driving.
Yeah.
Isn't,
isn't it a little funny

426
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:28.843
<v 0>extreme.</v>

427
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:36.240
<v 3>You guys are both big.
Nobody,
if you listened to that,</v>

428
00:27:36.241 --> 00:27:39.360
you wouldn't think like just close your eyes and listen to that yelling.

429
00:27:39.361 --> 00:27:41.880
You don't that doesn't that sound like I'm pinned.
Right,
right,
right.

430
00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:47.180
<v 0>Yeah,
it</v>

431
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:52.140
<v 3>helps.
Yeah,
that's true.
See Cause Bill I enough already.
All right.</v>

432
00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:54.730
All right.
Yeah,
he's further than me.
Right.

433
00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.290
But he thinks this is the funniest clip we've ever played.

434
00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:59.270
I don't think it's the funny was really like it,

435
00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:03.400
I think it shows a lack of empathy for others because I know that that man's

436
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:05.990
hurt.
I have a harder time laughing.
You know what I mean?

437
00:28:05.991 --> 00:28:09.160
And I think that that's your husband's identity and that's his safety blankets.

438
00:28:09.161 --> 00:28:12.440
So he stays in there cause he feel safe.
Who's therapizing knit?

439
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:16.850
I mean therapizing therapist is Abbas is isen what's my safe space?
Yeah.

440
00:28:16.851 --> 00:28:20.900
What did I say that again,
Bill doing that.
So I bring a beat while that time.

441
00:28:20.901 --> 00:28:23.420
He's crazy.
I like him.
Oh really?

442
00:28:23.421 --> 00:28:26.260
I'm going to say mean things to him because he's crazy.
No,
I don't find it.

443
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.250
Oh know,
I

444
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:34.020
just grew up watching Benny Hill and the three stooges like I did just like,
uh,

445
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:37.790
you know,
physical slapstick.
Yeah.
It's,

446
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:42.590
it's reality TV slapstick.
How long have,
uh,

447
00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:46.520
are you doing another,
you're doing another season of your show?
Yeah.
We're,
uh,

448
00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:49.940
working on season three right now.
Is it awful to do that much work?

449
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.370
Uh,
it can be on days when it's,

450
00:28:53.371 --> 00:28:56.980
it's not working days when it's not working.
I mean,

451
00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:00.200
you can say that about any job,
but I mean,
I can tell you this,

452
00:29:00.201 --> 00:29:02.180
it's way better than,
uh,

453
00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:05.160
back when I had nothing to do and I was staring at my phone.
Yeah.

454
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:09.770
But there's definitely a days when it's,
it's not working.
It's like anything,

455
00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:12.920
any job.
Some days it's great.
And you're loving it.

456
00:29:12.921 --> 00:29:15.650
And then other times you're like,
oh my God,
how was it only 1130?

457
00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:18.520
Did you love animated shows?
Like I just always wondered like,
no,

458
00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:21.920
I just love being able to say what I want to say without a bunch of fucking

459
00:29:21.921 --> 00:29:23.090
assholes tweeting about it.

460
00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:27.530
And for some reason you could do that in an animation.
Oh right.
Oh,
that's why.

461
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:31.340
That's why I went into it.
Really?
Yeah.
I didn't know that.
Well,

462
00:29:31.341 --> 00:29:34.940
cause I was telling all these stories on stage and it was like this,
this,
uh,

463
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.030
I feel bad for millennials.
Everybody shits on them.
It's not their fault.

464
00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:42.120
It's the people who raised him and everything got like,
and that's all,

465
00:29:42.121 --> 00:29:45.760
it's not even people raise some,
it's this social media shit that came out,

466
00:29:45.761 --> 00:29:49.660
which is just a horrible,
for the most part experiment that's gone wrong.

467
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:53.770
And um,
everything just got labeled.

468
00:29:53.771 --> 00:29:56.290
So all these stories that were funny and you could just,
Oh,
you know,

469
00:29:56.291 --> 00:29:58.810
I had a dad like that,
or I had,
my brother was like that.

470
00:29:58.811 --> 00:30:01.400
Or the guy down the street was like that.
Everything got labeled.

471
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:06.220
That's emotional abuse,
physical abuse,
bullying,
fat shaming,

472
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.740
ah,
you know,
all of it right down the thing.

473
00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:13.740
So it's just this landmine of groans trying to just tell the fucking story and,

474
00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:17.680
and um,
and then I get off stage and if said,
oh my God,

475
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.860
they would say my brother was like that and blah,
blah.
And I just got sick of,

476
00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:25.300
I just stopped telling stories like that on stage.

477
00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:28.490
And then I was walking my dog and I was thinking,
how the hell can I tell him?

478
00:30:28.491 --> 00:30:31.870
And I don't know if I'd watched a cartoon or something,

479
00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:34.030
I don't know if it's like one of I just animate him and I was just going to make

480
00:30:34.031 --> 00:30:37.840
little animated shorts,
little shorts.
But like most Comedians,
I say,

481
00:30:37.841 --> 00:30:40.810
I'm going to do it.
And then I never did it.
And then,
um,

482
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:45.880
I met Vince Vaughn and all those guys through Steve Byrne and uh,
uh,

483
00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.170
my pilots never got picked up,
so I was like,
no,
I don't have a show idea.
Yeah,

484
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:53.230
they never get picked up.
And I'm not taking myself off the table for a year.

485
00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.280
So if you guys have a movie or a TV and you want to cast me in something,

486
00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:00.160
I will do that.
And then they go,
okay,
all right.

487
00:31:00.161 --> 00:31:02.220
And I'm walking around us and I kind of felt bad.
I was like,
well,
you know,

488
00:31:02.221 --> 00:31:04.900
all kind of have this idea for an animated show.
And they were looking to do one.

489
00:31:04.901 --> 00:31:08.320
So they literally,
I was literally walking out the door and they go,

490
00:31:08.321 --> 00:31:11.830
let's hear it.
I told it to him.
And then,
uh,
you know,

491
00:31:11.831 --> 00:31:14.590
those guys are like amazing over there,
wild west.

492
00:31:14.591 --> 00:31:18.770
And they got me in touch with the,
they brought him Mike Price from the Simpsons,

493
00:31:18.771 --> 00:31:22.720
the Great Mike Price.
And together we cocreated the show it.
Here we are.

494
00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:26.650
It's amazing,
man.
Yeah,
that's awesome.
Oh,
thank you.
And you could run for,
I mean,

495
00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:30.920
animated shows fucking go forever,
man.
That's kind of the,
I guess the bag.

496
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:34.690
You can get little sick of it,
but it can be,
it all depends on that yet.
I will,

497
00:31:34.691 --> 00:31:37.180
if I'm sick of it,
I won't do it anymore,
but I'm not sick of it.

498
00:31:37.181 --> 00:31:39.730
I'm still having fun.
How many,
uh,
in a,
in a show like that,

499
00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:42.040
cause it's funny too with Netflix,
you know,

500
00:31:42.041 --> 00:31:44.590
you get into one show and you're like,
how many episodes are in the season?

501
00:31:44.591 --> 00:31:46.190
It's like eight.
You're like,
God dammit.

502
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:49.810
And then the next show you pull up has 13.
And the next show,
I mean,

503
00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:54.550
what is like a run is 10.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay,
that's cool.
Eight's not bad,

504
00:31:54.551 --> 00:31:58.060
but if they're hour long things,
even if it's a good show,

505
00:31:58.061 --> 00:32:00.910
it does kind of feel like all of a sudden you've dumped all this work in your

506
00:32:00.911 --> 00:32:03.610
lap.
Like I got to sit down and watch all of these.

507
00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:08.410
And then if the story starts to go a little in a way that you don't want it and

508
00:32:08.411 --> 00:32:11.300
you're like,
ah,
fuck,
well things get,
I mean,
some of the show,

509
00:32:11.301 --> 00:32:16.060
I'm going to finish this,
like a house of cards definitely got wacky as,

510
00:32:16.061 --> 00:32:19.640
uh,
as the seasons progressed.
I never could,
I never got into that year.
Yeah.

511
00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:22.990
It was really,
I didn't like the asides to the camera.
Oh yeah.

512
00:32:22.991 --> 00:32:27.870
Like that's the senator and he's a Hooptie do.
But
I like,

513
00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.470
I just fucking,
I I guess,

514
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.410
and they really going to do this every fucking 10 minutes.

515
00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.040
That breaking of the fourth fucker wall.
I hate that shit.

516
00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:41.540
I didn't like it in Ferris Bueller's day off.
Yeah.
Either do the fucking movie.

517
00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:44.720
I'll make a documentary.
I don't like this hybrid shit.

518
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:48.140
Like I'm supposed to be excited and I'm like,
oh,
he's talking to me.

519
00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:51.550
There's like,
I don't know their story.

520
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:56.270
I agree that that device can be distracting.
But the stories,
like the writing,

521
00:32:56.271 --> 00:33:00.650
everything was,
I thought spot on.
So good season one,

522
00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:05.740
season two got started off just like crazy by like three season four,

523
00:33:06.471 --> 00:33:10.520
you're like,
what the,
yeah.
But it's hard.
It's hard to keep it going.

524
00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:15.050
I saw this giant pizza dough and you just keep spinning and eventually,
you know,

525
00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.530
there's no,
no show at some point.
Uh,

526
00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.540
other than like the wire breaking bad.

527
00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:23.750
There's a few that just somehow just stuck the landing the whole way.

528
00:33:23.751 --> 00:33:27.140
But it's the hardest thing in the world to,
you know,

529
00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:31.510
to keep going and not eventually,
you know,
path people going like,
you know,

530
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.560
oh my goodness.
It doesn't,
I don't like this character.
And then you've got to,

531
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:37.790
after a while,
years exhaust all your characters.

532
00:33:37.791 --> 00:33:40.610
That's not worried about our show.
Cause people always fucking die on the show.

533
00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.660
We're always introducing characters and then somebody gets killed.

534
00:33:44.661 --> 00:33:47.890
So hopefully this season,
you know,
we're still working on it.
Nobody dies.

535
00:33:47.891 --> 00:33:51.730
So that's awesome.
That's fantastic.
Um,
yeah,

536
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:55.880
I'm a big fan man,
so congratulations on all that for real.
Thank you.

537
00:33:56.750 --> 00:34:00.810
I love you.
Even just the way he goes.
Yeah,
thank you.
You know,

538
00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:02.580
whatever you just said,
you know,
congratulations,
blah blah blah.

539
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.760
This the lack of a mode.

540
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:09.850
Like I like how our relationship is him trying to do that and then sees me

541
00:34:09.951 --> 00:34:11.420
looking at him like you're a psycho.

542
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.810
And then he laughs and he has like this infectious laughs and he just pulls me

543
00:34:14.811 --> 00:34:19.130
back in.
Like most of my,
most of my brain is saying,

544
00:34:19.131 --> 00:34:23.060
I got to get away from this guy because he's going to fucking hit me over the

545
00:34:23.061 --> 00:34:27.350
head with a hammer.
But then that laugh,
I love his left.
Do you,

546
00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.520
do people ever tell you,

547
00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:32.870
especially after he was caught and the and the movies started to come out,

548
00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:36.770
that you have a look of Whitey Bulger?
Is that a thing for you or no?

549
00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:38.990
No.
Never.
No.

550
00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:43.490
I could totally see you planting little bit.
I'm not,

551
00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:44.570
even if they shoot another one,

552
00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:47.540
I think the role was down to me and Johnny Depp and they were like,
oh,

553
00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:53.510
which way do we go?
I think the last thing I said to the casting director,

554
00:34:53.511 --> 00:34:58.490
I was like,
but wait,
I'm already bald.
No,
we're still good.
No,

555
00:34:58.491 --> 00:34:59.324
I didn't go in for that.

556
00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:05.000
You think I'm actually going up and you think he got offered that he's fucking

557
00:35:05.001 --> 00:35:08.450
Johnny.
No,
but I figured,
you know,
they'd be like,
it's Bill Byrd.
Fucking,

558
00:35:08.451 --> 00:35:11.580
let's take a look.
It's bilberry cells,
no movie tickets.
Right out.

559
00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:16.610
She sold out an Improv,
a clip from bill show.
Oh,
is this here?

560
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:21.230
I Dunno.
Or producer sends us folders of Shit.
I Dunno.
This is it.

561
00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:22.093
What is this?

562
00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.740
<v 4>Black guys love the fuck and fuck good.</v>

563
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:30.550
If you're a hot black guy and you want to fuck me at 2195 if you want to move

564
00:35:30.741 --> 00:35:33.500
in,
you come move in,
but you got to fuck the I have any,

565
00:35:33.501 --> 00:35:37.710
I need to be fucked a lot,
man.
You can rent free food,
free rent,
everything else,

566
00:35:37.711 --> 00:35:38.880
man has a deal,
man.

567
00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:43.070
<v 3>Definitely your show.
No,
I'm just fascinated by that guy.</v>

568
00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:48.710
That's about as free as it gets.
He just doesn't care if his mother sees that.

569
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:54.640
He knows what he wants at a bone in his hair.

570
00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:03.410
Free rent though.
Free Rent.
You get free food.

571
00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:08.480
The reason why he's alone,
he suffocate shoe.
Yeah.
Yeah.

572
00:36:08.481 --> 00:36:12.950
He's a very needy,
very needy to be fucked to be fucked alone.
It's like,
okay.

573
00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.910
I was like,
you know,
if you were did that,

574
00:36:15.911 --> 00:36:20.240
that he would be enjoyable for about two,
three days.
It would tire you out.
Yeah.

575
00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:24.960
<v 4>Then from jail,
homeless or you were thug.
Want to come?</v>

576
00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:29.160
We'll then frank would you too man?
Free Rent.
You can at least in the cake.

577
00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.760
Fucking piss.
Somebody beat me up home.
I know.

578
00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:34.980
You see me when I come up with today and try it out.
Try it out,
man.

579
00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:39.330
<v 3>Try it out when he thinks no,
I'm just trying to think of what happened.</v>

580
00:36:39.331 --> 00:36:43.280
He definitely was not built up as a child.
Now you,

581
00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:47.990
that stuff beat me,
pee on me.
It's just like your parents are just,

582
00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.240
I think there's this whole childhood were just yelling.
You're not good enough.

583
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:52.950
Yeah,
I was probably disappointing you.

584
00:36:52.951 --> 00:36:56.400
I wish the kid across the street was my son and not use this horrible shit.

585
00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:00.270
I feel bad for that guy.
I know.
But at the same time it's funny,
however.
Yeah,

586
00:37:00.271 --> 00:37:03.340
but you know what's funny is like he's so hates himself that he just fucking,

587
00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:07.080
he doesn't give a shit.
Yeah.
I mean,
how do you get like this?
No.

588
00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:09.360
How does he have a jolly good?
What do you mean rent free?

589
00:37:09.361 --> 00:37:10.200
Like what are you doing?

590
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.960
Does he drive like a ups truck and like they're going to see that and be like,

591
00:37:15.961 --> 00:37:18.720
well,
you know what he does on his own time.
He's,

592
00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:26.560
but here we can't give them any black and I partners though that'd be deliver in

593
00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:31.530
the white neighborhoods,
so we keep that side of,
oh my God,
about drug use.

594
00:37:31.531 --> 00:37:34.240
What do you think's going on?
Yeah,
I think he's a little high.
Yeah,

595
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:37.200
those rings around the eyes are pretty serious I think,

596
00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:40.260
but that's such a crazy mustache that if he shaved that off,

597
00:37:40.261 --> 00:37:44.280
I don't think I'd recognize him.
I didn't even really think about the mustache.

598
00:37:44.281 --> 00:37:46.580
It's a good point.
Cheech Marin.
Yeah,

599
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.530
look and if he wants to track

600
00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:53.410
<v 4>my fucking pissed,
let me try it out.
She has applied only this.
Fuck man.</v>

601
00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:57.700
I'm looking for hardcore guys and meaning meaning I want him to live with,

602
00:37:57.850 --> 00:38:00.820
I'm a hot swap.
My trash come down for fuck

603
00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:05.550
<v 3>true.
That's a good offer.
Free.
He's a hot cum dumpster.</v>

604
00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.590
Yeah,
it's got a lot going on.

605
00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:14.700
Does he have enough pain in his life?
He's got to be on this show too.

606
00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:22.650
You know what I mean?
That wasn't,
that wasn't like low hanging fruit.

607
00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:26.550
That was actually,
if you did that in a movie,

608
00:38:26.551 --> 00:38:29.490
if that was the character you would be nominated cause that that was an amazing

609
00:38:29.491 --> 00:38:32.670
performance.
I actually,
uh,
what I would,

610
00:38:32.671 --> 00:38:34.800
I was kind of addicted to was his cadence,

611
00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:40.020
the way he had a very unique way of you want to [inaudible] it's some sort of,

612
00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:47.030
somebody sent it says interesting speech pattern here.
This is like a,

613
00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:49.490
he'll be always,
that might be the drug thing.
Like it's,

614
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:54.310
I've never been like a hard core drug guy,
so I don't know.
Uh,
we,
um,

615
00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:58.750
what that is,
that's tweaking.
Is that what the kids say?
Twittering,
he's tweaking.

616
00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:02.440
Well,
we play a lot of times interesting speech patterns.
Some people have lunch,

617
00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:06.320
it comes off the math and the teachers just looks on his phone off.
Fuck,
I pause.

618
00:39:06.321 --> 00:39:08.950
I was,
I was,
I videoing again,
just so you know,

619
00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:13.600
his home address on this video and we had the decency to block that out,

620
00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:16.600
but he gives his street address.
Yeah,
yeah.

621
00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.470
If you want to try it on the Internet,
it's not a good thing.

622
00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:21.730
The Internet is not a good thing,

623
00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:25.400
but as much as we would all still be struggling if it wasn't the Internet,
uh,

624
00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.250
you know,
it's good for comedians.

625
00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:29.090
Internet has been great for Queens for the most part.

626
00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.780
You can still get in trouble.
But like for people like that,
you know,

627
00:39:31.781 --> 00:39:34.180
he just would have been muttering that around his house.
True.

628
00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.710
Or maybe out in his front yard,
people walking by then he could deny it.

629
00:39:38.711 --> 00:39:40.090
He could deny it.
I do that.

630
00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:45.040
And then they just phone,
yes,
you did.

631
00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:50.070
Back in the day was your word against theirs and you actually had to prove shit

632
00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:54.220
and now there's like video evidence and now it's gone past that now.

633
00:39:54.221 --> 00:39:58.030
Or if it's just somebody gives a really good detailed story,
people just go,
well,

634
00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:01.130
I mean,
how could you make something like that up?
Yeah.
And uh,

635
00:40:01.131 --> 00:40:04.180
that's become due process.
I feel like now too,

636
00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.150
aren't we moving towards an age where like you remember,

637
00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:12.010
you remember when the clippers owner got in trouble and he,
uh,

638
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:16.420
they recorded his conversation,
his mistress did and released it.

639
00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:20.380
Don't you think we're,
I mean it might be past our life.

640
00:40:20.381 --> 00:40:23.740
You don't think the police are going to tap into that.
Hey Siri,

641
00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:27.610
how many fucking teeth does an alligator habitat was stupid fucking commercials.

642
00:40:27.611 --> 00:40:31.600
They talk rolling all you,
you're recording your entire fucking personal life.

643
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:35.160
And what I'm saying,
you are going to be,
somebody is going to end.
Even if,
if

644
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:41.380
somebody hacks into that thing,
I'm saying that and they will,
they will fucking,

645
00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:42.310
they will do their,

646
00:40:42.311 --> 00:40:46.510
their cut of the film of your life and they'll make you look however the fuck

647
00:40:46.511 --> 00:40:47.650
you want.
People are self duck.

648
00:40:47.651 --> 00:40:49.690
It's dumb to have this fucking thing laying around.

649
00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:53.940
It's going to happen sooner than we think where you are going to your Rick

650
00:40:53.941 --> 00:40:57.230
conversations,
anything you said will be,
well,

651
00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:00.040
someone will be able to pull that out at some point and be like,

652
00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:02.800
this is what bill said.
You know what to think about the,

653
00:41:02.801 --> 00:41:06.280
that all of that shit is,
is you have to like,
um,

654
00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:09.970
this is a time to be fearless.
Yeah.

655
00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:15.450
And I'm finding every body is like so many people agree on so many different

656
00:41:15.851 --> 00:41:18.700
things right now that they had so afraid to talk about.

657
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.790
Cause you don't want to get in trouble.
You don't want to bring it onto you.

658
00:41:21.791 --> 00:41:25.220
I don't want to get,
you know,
I don't want to say anything like it's just you,

659
00:41:25.221 --> 00:41:29.020
you know,
you gotta like,
you know where the all black Tuxedo,
uh,
you know,
we're,

660
00:41:29.021 --> 00:41:32.470
we're fighting for their freedom.
Like anything about foreign policy,

661
00:41:32.471 --> 00:41:36.030
anything about all these sexual harassment cases there,
anything about any,

662
00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:39.920
it's like there is this one line of fucking thought that you can have.

663
00:41:39.921 --> 00:41:43.130
And if you don't have that a 100%,

664
00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:46.040
if you go a little bit out of the turn and go,
well,
hey,
there's a little,

665
00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:49.400
did you know this degree?
Any of that shit out the fucking window.

666
00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:51.200
It's heightened care too.
It's heightened.

667
00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:55.700
It's heightened in social media too because there's always been these nut bags

668
00:41:55.701 --> 00:41:58.040
that will latch on to one thing you say.

669
00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:02.210
But now they can congregate online and they can become an angry mob.

670
00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:05.600
And now corporations listened to these idiot angry mobs.

671
00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:07.790
And like what you're saying with the sexual harassment stuff,

672
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:12.500
it's bad enough just being accused of it and now everything gets taken from you

673
00:42:12.501 --> 00:42:16.730
and there is no due process.
There is no like,
well,
hey,
there's no degrees as,
hey,

674
00:42:16.731 --> 00:42:20.930
this guy's a rapist.
Hey,
this guy has said something.
Well,
Hey,

675
00:42:20.931 --> 00:42:24.140
I had a bad date.
And then it's just all it's out out.

676
00:42:24.141 --> 00:42:27.140
No out in the fucking woods to behind your ear over.

677
00:42:27.141 --> 00:42:29.660
And then like some of this shit like,
I don't know,
like what is the end game?

678
00:42:29.661 --> 00:42:33.410
It's like these people are they not allowed to ever earn a living again?

679
00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:38.230
Are they supposed to become homeless?
I just you,
I dunno and,

680
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:39.230
but this is the thing,

681
00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:43.370
obviously that behavior is completely unacceptable and you shouldn't be doing
it.

682
00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.880
But the way that they're there,
I just looked at it this way,

683
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:50.270
it's like this shit was like a fucking pressure cooker because no one was

684
00:42:50.271 --> 00:42:52.540
listening.
So in a way it's,

685
00:42:52.541 --> 00:42:54.890
it's deserving on the male side that this is happening,

686
00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:59.630
but it's fucking exploding now.
But any sort of like,
hey,
hey,
hey,
okay,

687
00:42:59.631 --> 00:43:04.300
okay,
let's,
let's,
let's find out what happened.
Well,
you know,
there's,

688
00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:05.960
there's,
there's none of that.

689
00:43:05.961 --> 00:43:10.961
I've actually heard the argument that we shouldn't break down and explain the

690
00:43:12.021 --> 00:43:16.190
degrees and the differences of these accusations.
Like,
I've heard that,

691
00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:19.550
I think that's because there needs to be a corrective first,
right?

692
00:43:19.551 --> 00:43:22.100
There needs to be a correction.
The pendulum,
like bill said,

693
00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.220
was so far on this end,
and everybody's so fucking angry.

694
00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:29.030
So now the pendulum's way here and now with the last thing,
with the z story,

695
00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.340
I think people are starting to go,
well,
wait a minute.

696
00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:36.110
Maybe there's gray areas to this discussion.
It's not just,
there's gray areas.

697
00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:41.300
If you're looking at people who created law,
who are way smarter than me,

698
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:46.460
you know what I mean?
There,
there's,
there's misdemeanors and felonies,

699
00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:51.770
murder one murder to manslaughter people that are in this thing with,

700
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:54.620
with their anger,
especially if they're emotional about it,

701
00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:59.200
don't even want to entertain that conversation.
They are just like,

702
00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:02.150
it's like you're trying to sell somebody like,
hey,

703
00:44:02.151 --> 00:44:06.180
arm robbery and shoplifting or different,
right?
And they're saying,
no,
all the,

704
00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:10.610
somebody took something that's the same,
take care of them in the public square.

705
00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.970
I think you're being unreasonable because you're so emotional,

706
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:15.950
which is a totally fair thing to say.

707
00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:20.930
But everybody else who's kind of thinking logically I think is open to the idea

708
00:44:20.931 --> 00:44:25.730
that the majority of the people are.
Because anytime I've said that on stage,

709
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:29.330
like there's no like,
oh my God,
heckling shouting down.

710
00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:32.640
There's no like fucking problems.
Eh,

711
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:35.640
same thing when you talk about the war.
There hasn't really been any problem,

712
00:44:35.641 --> 00:44:38.680
but everybody is afraid to like,
you know,
it's,

713
00:44:38.681 --> 00:44:43.260
it's not good to,
um,
you know,
when,

714
00:44:43.261 --> 00:44:47.550
when it's,
it's this level of emotional reaction to,

715
00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:51.450
to just just lay back and just be like,
just,
okay,
just don't get involved.

716
00:44:51.451 --> 00:44:56.250
Don't get involved because it's going to,
you know,
God,
I mean,

717
00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.970
you know,
the,
the thing about a sex thing is if you,

718
00:44:58.971 --> 00:45:01.890
if you just get accused of it,
I've said for the longest time,

719
00:45:01.891 --> 00:45:03.510
like if you get accused of rape,

720
00:45:03.511 --> 00:45:06.390
they shouldn't show your face or name until you're convicted.

721
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:09.930
Because once somebody just gets accused as you have it,

722
00:45:09.931 --> 00:45:14.070
you have to fucked done.
Not to mention,
even if you were just accused of it,

723
00:45:14.071 --> 00:45:17.100
like everybody in your own like personal life,
your work it,

724
00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:19.770
that's going to get out of course.
And now social media,

725
00:45:19.771 --> 00:45:22.350
everyone's gonna rat you out in any ways and it's just like there's,

726
00:45:22.351 --> 00:45:26.370
there's no comeback from that.
And if you're actually innocent,

727
00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:30.570
and I've seen people going like,
well,
the incidences are that are really rare.

728
00:45:30.571 --> 00:45:32.300
It's like,
I'll look them up.
Yeah.

729
00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:35.940
There's enough of them that there should be some sort of thing like that,

730
00:45:35.941 --> 00:45:39.930
but I just don't think you can keep anything under a lid anymore.
But,
um,

731
00:45:39.931 --> 00:45:43.880
I really do believe that it's a time for like,
you know,
uh,

732
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:48.270
to not be afraid.
Um,
when you're on stage,

733
00:45:48.271 --> 00:45:51.060
especially as a comedian,
like all,
like the,
they're just starting to like,

734
00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:55.470
you know,
uh,
paint.
It's the weirdest thing.
Like when I was,

735
00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:59.610
I was on stage,
I was joking with,
I was like this younger crowd.

736
00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:02.070
And usually when he get to my age,
it's like getting 50.

737
00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:05.040
It's like you kind of become like the corn ball,
like,
hey,
take my wife please.

738
00:46:05.041 --> 00:46:09.420
You know,
like your style becomes old.
But they are so under a microscope,

739
00:46:09.421 --> 00:46:13.170
they act like old people.
So like I,
I was watching,
I was at a show last night,

740
00:46:13.171 --> 00:46:17.550
there was a couple guys like my age were like the edgy guys,
right?
Corn balls,

741
00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:21.330
right.
Looking at the 20 something year olds in the crowd being like,

742
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.830
Jesus Christ,
these people are going to be running in the nation.
Oh my God.

743
00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.330
Remember back in our day,
we just did Dick Jokes.
What are these?

744
00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:31.200
I'm not really saying the Comedians,
I'm just saying the way the crowd.
Yes.

745
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:34.230
It's like you're on fucking doing a whole bunch of old people on a cruise ship.

746
00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.450
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
It's interesting.

747
00:46:36.451 --> 00:46:41.451
We had dinner with someone that has three 25 year old children and he was saying

748
00:46:42.001 --> 00:46:46.770
how these kids are so terrified now because of the whole,
uh,
you know,

749
00:46:46.771 --> 00:46:50.940
me too.
Or the sexual harassment stuff there.
So under a microscope,
like you said,

750
00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:54.410
that every move is like,
can I ask a graph?
I don't know what to do today,

751
00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:57.750
like there.
So two less than it was at the laugh factory.

752
00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:59.370
And W as I was walking out,

753
00:46:59.371 --> 00:47:03.760
I was looking at my phone and there was a waitress in front of me and like I

754
00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:07.050
just didn't see her and I bumped it up,
bumped into like her backside,

755
00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:10.530
like her back all the way down.
I said,
Oh fuck,
I can sorry about that.

756
00:47:10.531 --> 00:47:11.730
And she goes,
yeah,
that's cool.
I was like,

757
00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.760
dude,
I've been on stage.

758
00:47:17.761 --> 00:47:21.810
I've been doing this bit about the degrees of the sexual harassment,

759
00:47:21.811 --> 00:47:24.950
things like how they're basically,
it's a bit about that.
Uh,

760
00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:30.190
I did it in Phoenix,
Honolulu.
I did it at the store.

761
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:34.420
We get it.
You're work in the road.
People like you and I did it.

762
00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:40.670
I did it at a fundraiser show here.
Oof Man.
Well,
when eggs,

763
00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:45.400
well anytime you do a fundraiser,
people are in this phony,
uh,
sort of,

764
00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:49.900
uh,
I have to pretend I care.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So it,
it,
and it goes beyond you,

765
00:47:49.901 --> 00:47:53.340
obviously care cause you there.
Yeah.
But there is the cause,
but then it,

766
00:47:53.341 --> 00:47:57.730
it seeps into everything else.
Yeah.
You know,
and then it becomes like,
oh,

767
00:47:57.731 --> 00:47:58.111
you just,

768
00:47:58.111 --> 00:48:03.111
but I usually one line [inaudible] usually like gets rid of it or whatever.

769
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:05.650
You know what I mean?
If you just call him on it,

770
00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:09.970
then they can kind of like relax.
But yeah,
no,
I show,

771
00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:13.330
oh it was,
it went pretty,
it went south pretty,
pretty badly.

772
00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:14.470
You aren't able to recover.

773
00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:19.530
I was able to recover after more than a moment and there was a little bit of

774
00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:23.910
chaos in the room.
That's how,
that's not,
it was,

775
00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:28.380
it was a totally,
you liked that.
It was like fuel.
It was fun.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

776
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:30.130
So I mean if you're steering into it,

777
00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:35.080
but I'm saying I hadn't experienced that reaction doing that bit.
In other words,

778
00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.540
my experience,
sometimes you have bids where you're like,

779
00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:41.930
I know this is going to run into like a,

780
00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:46.030
a huge pushback.
This wasn't that bit to me because I had done it.
That was my,

781
00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:49.240
like I had done it in places and it was always like a bit that worked.

782
00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.910
And then this was the first time where I was,
well that's always funny.

783
00:48:51.911 --> 00:48:55.370
We were like,
ah,
this one's going to get,
yeah,

784
00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:59.050
it's going to be one of these shows.
Have Y'all,
cause you've done,

785
00:48:59.051 --> 00:49:01.110
like obviously everyone know you've done a ton of specials.

786
00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:05.350
Do you have in your catalog a bit that you're like,

787
00:49:05.351 --> 00:49:08.710
that's the one that infuriated people the most,
in other words,

788
00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:12.400
from your spouse?
The most reaction yet?
I gotta be honest.

789
00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:16.870
I don't read any of that shit.
None of it.
I am,
I mean I'm,
I've,
I've read it,

790
00:49:16.871 --> 00:49:18.610
but it's,
it's just,
it's silly.

791
00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:24.660
Silly if you want to get,
like,
if you're like one stood out,
that's the look.

792
00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:28.050
I know that I don't meet it anything in a malicious way.
Right?

793
00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:29.313
<v 5>MMM.</v>

794
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:33.930
<v 3>So somebody on the Internet,
why are,
or whatever,
they watch it,</v>

795
00:49:33.931 --> 00:49:36.690
they have the right to take it.
Like I said it seriously.
I mean,

796
00:49:36.691 --> 00:49:38.340
if you want to do that,
yeah.

797
00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:42.390
But just because you think that I meant it seriously doesn't mean I now meant it

798
00:49:42.391 --> 00:49:45.030
seriously.
Right.
You don't control the fucking universe in.
Yeah.

799
00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:47.810
I like when they argue with you,
like,
no,
I was just joking.
No,
yeah,

800
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:49.560
I can tell you blah,
blah,
blah.
So it's like,
okay,

801
00:49:49.561 --> 00:49:52.550
so you know what my intent and my thoughts are more than I do.
Yeah.

802
00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:56.190
That's what your argument is right now.
I guess.
So just saying I'm a liar.

803
00:49:56.191 --> 00:49:58.780
I don't know,
but it's just like,
it goes nowhere.
Yeah.

804
00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:02.510
And you make their day if you write back and forth.
And uh,

805
00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:06.480
fortunately I've always been at this level in the business where like,
I don't,

806
00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:11.160
I don't get like,
uh,
too many of those types of things,

807
00:50:11.161 --> 00:50:15.850
but I also think that
the stuff that I say isn't that crazy.

808
00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:19.990
Like I don't,
I don't,
I'm not really super dark.
I'm not,
uh,
you know,

809
00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:23.800
I'm just sort of,
I always said just the loud guy at the bar who's just,
you know,

810
00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:26.980
you think he's making sense and then you find out he flunked everything in

811
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:28.820
school and you're like,
oh,
this guy's just an idiot.

812
00:50:28.821 --> 00:50:32.120
That is a great description of you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't mean the idiot part.

813
00:50:32.121 --> 00:50:35.120
I mean the loud guy at the bar that you want,
every everything

814
00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:39.950
where you bad in school.
Oh yeah,
I did.

815
00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:45.140
I did really well in elementary school and then I did pretty good in junior
high.

816
00:50:45.141 --> 00:50:48.740
And then when it mattered like high school to what they looked at,

817
00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:51.740
that's when the kind of the wheels fell off.
But uh,
you know,

818
00:50:51.741 --> 00:50:54.140
my favorite thing is about,
um,
like when I hang out with comics,

819
00:50:54.141 --> 00:50:55.160
what I want to know the most.

820
00:50:55.400 --> 00:51:00.200
I would love a 15 minute documentary on every comics,
like a house,

821
00:51:00.201 --> 00:51:01.070
like where they grew up.

822
00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:06.280
Like I would love to see like a short doc Netflix doing that on your 15 minutes,

823
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:11.940
they're just going to whittle the special down to absolutely nothing.
Comedians,

824
00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:15.770
houses.
When you love though to see like bill's folks,

825
00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:19.240
siblings like that would be the best.
I want to hear every,

826
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:22.430
I want to hear the therapy version.
I want to watch mom and dad fight.

827
00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:27.230
I want to watch you want to spray.
It's just intriguing.
Creeps me out.
Really.

828
00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:30.770
I don't like this.
I,
uh,

829
00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:35.540
like I felt like what that is story.
Like I started to read,
it's just like,
dude,

830
00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:37.790
I don't want to know about his private.
This is not,

831
00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:40.790
I don't want to slide of my fucking business,

832
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:44.630
but just you doing that,
just you doing that,
you don't,

833
00:51:44.631 --> 00:51:47.620
you all you heard was one side of the story and it's just,

834
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:51.170
that's not how court works.
Oh,
I totally agree.
If he just heard one side,

835
00:51:51.171 --> 00:51:54.320
every fucking thing would be a conviction.
It would be compelling.
Yeah.

836
00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:56.750
Everything would be compelling and we're totally fucking make sense.

837
00:51:56.751 --> 00:51:58.340
It's when you hear the other person's side,

838
00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:02.150
that's where the artist and then trying to sift through and look at somebody.

839
00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:07.120
Yeah.
And looking at how somebody like emotion,
cause I ran into somebody and uh,

840
00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:10.140
they were talking about how they had some of that bullshit going on and they

841
00:52:10.141 --> 00:52:12.080
were like,
well,
you know,
I mean that's just how it is and blah,
blah,
blah.

842
00:52:12.081 --> 00:52:13.850
And it was very like laid back about it.

843
00:52:13.851 --> 00:52:17.000
And I was just thinking I would be fucking livid.
Yeah.
Yeah.

844
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:20.240
So I was thinking like that,
that's not a,
so I don't know what happened,

845
00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:23.420
but if I was in the jury,
I'd be like,
that's not the fucking reaction.

846
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:25.130
Even though he's saying I'm innocent,
I'm innocent,

847
00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:27.880
I'm going to just sort of listening,
going like,
you know,
you,

848
00:52:27.881 --> 00:52:30.610
you sound like you're in a fucking yoga class.
And he's like,
Yup,

849
00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:33.460
that's how it goes.
So,
you know,
but I mean that's the time we're living in and I,

850
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:37.200
you know,
kind of fucking,
yeah.
And it's just like,
okay,

851
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.710
that's not how I would've fucking dealt with it.

852
00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:43.820
I think about Louis Ck and I love him so much and I,
I want like,

853
00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:45.680
I feel like he should just be punished.

854
00:52:45.681 --> 00:52:50.270
Like we should just shame him a little bit,
but not take away everything.
Right.

855
00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:53.030
Well doesn't that feel fair?
Like,
all right,
we'll shame him a bit.

856
00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:54.710
I think that get them to knock it off.

857
00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:59.210
I think that what's actually going to happen is a version of what you're saying.

858
00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:03.620
Cause the shaming has happened,
punishment has happened and then it's just time.

859
00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:06.320
So at a certain time,
it's not like,
dude,

860
00:53:06.321 --> 00:53:11.321
there's so many people that want to see him and see what he has to say and just

861
00:53:11.391 --> 00:53:14.840
our special ever like in five years,
I don't know how long,

862
00:53:14.841 --> 00:53:18.470
but it'll definitely happen without a doubt.
Without a doubt.
Unless he's like,

863
00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:22.160
I'm fucking done with all of this.
So I moved to France.

864
00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:25.740
They would definitely welcome it.
They always,
yeah,

865
00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:29.460
the French are checked off.
Everybody just calls.
Yeah they don't,

866
00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:32.580
they think that what's happening now is ridiculous and American women,

867
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:38.030
Catherine what dyno and Brigitte Bardot or like decent malicon mentally this is

868
00:53:38.941 --> 00:53:43.230
how they fled.
They're totally,
me too is these nonsense.

869
00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:46.210
There's so indoctrine there are women that are,
it,

870
00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:51.450
it probably somewhere in the middle like the French get too much respect for

871
00:53:51.451 --> 00:53:54.120
like,
oh they can have mr citizens.
It's sort of acceptable.

872
00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:58.560
Do you go over over there like a,
you know like in Paris or whatever,

873
00:53:58.561 --> 00:54:02.910
that there,
there was a misery to that place.
So,
I mean,

874
00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:06.510
I,
I don't,
I don't think that there is like a,

875
00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:09.750
cause I used to look at that and I used to be like,
okay,

876
00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:13.710
are they just like honest or they just like,
uh,

877
00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:19.060
in the future or if they take like a wrong turn at a,

878
00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:21.060
I think it's a little bit of both.
Yeah.

879
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:23.640
They are in the future and they also took a wrong turn.

880
00:54:23.641 --> 00:54:28.440
And I just think it all depends on how you're wired to like plug it in.
So,

881
00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:32.410
um,
I dunno,
those are my new points of view,
by the way.
Why?

882
00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:35.580
Just make sure that I say like,
this is what I think,
but I don't fucking know.
No,

883
00:54:35.890 --> 00:54:39.450
because I'm so sick of people talking about,
yeah.
Absolutes.

884
00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:41.910
I unfollowed a lot of people too on like Twitter.

885
00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:45.810
Like when the people who go into Lenny Bruce mode and all they can do is just

886
00:54:45.811 --> 00:54:46.920
tweet about Trump.
It'd be like,

887
00:54:46.921 --> 00:54:51.270
so this happened and then they put the thing on there and it's just like,
I just,

888
00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:55.740
and every fucking day,
every fucking second.
And it's just like,
okay,

889
00:54:55.741 --> 00:54:58.170
and what's the solution?
Right.
I don't have any,

890
00:54:58.290 --> 00:55:02.850
I'm just going to show you all this negative shit from this point of view that's

891
00:55:02.851 --> 00:55:06.750
going to have you like,
it's like,
it's depressing.
It is.
It is depressing.
Yeah.

892
00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:09.210
You got like a,
I used to,
I was,
I was in,
uh,

893
00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:12.540
like indulging in news fucking 24,

894
00:55:12.541 --> 00:55:17.541
seven from the like election day through the written in like months and months.

895
00:55:17.941 --> 00:55:21.840
A month at a certain point.
I think another like Steve Martin Comedian,
right?

896
00:55:21.841 --> 00:55:26.730
It's right.
Right now for another just Steve Martin.
Just silly,
silly,
yeah.

897
00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:30.510
Facility.
But there was a brilliant behind what he was doing like that.

898
00:55:30.511 --> 00:55:33.440
I don't just mean like silly,
stupid,
silly,
brilliant.
Totally brilliant.

899
00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:38.450
This is a good moment for that cause you're going fucking heavy and um,

900
00:55:40.350 --> 00:55:43.740
I don't know.
And I love silly.
So I'm looking for,
because I know it's not me,

901
00:55:43.741 --> 00:55:45.750
so I'm looking forward to whoever the fuck it's going to be.

902
00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:50.160
Now you have a child.
Are you raising your child?
Not at all gender Pronoun.

903
00:55:50.161 --> 00:55:52.930
None at all.
Okay.
So I gender,
gender,

904
00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:56.460
just throw food into a room in the general direction.

905
00:55:56.550 --> 00:56:01.550
Are you raising your child by the gender binary or your car or is it,

906
00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:07.910
this is why I would never do that to my kid.

907
00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:10.920
May well,
I get into something,
right.

908
00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:14.190
I always get into shit and then a year later I don't give a fuck about it.

909
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:18.690
This kid has like a developing brain.
I'm going to dump like my,
uh,

910
00:56:19.690 --> 00:56:22.940
whatever Mike fucking my own constitution has shit on it.

911
00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:28.200
I just feel like that is like adult stuff and you should allow kids to be kids.

912
00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:31.610
Can they,
can they have a fucking child?

913
00:56:31.611 --> 00:56:34.600
Because right now what I love about when I grew up was I was allowed to be a
kid.

914
00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:37.780
Yeah.
And like,
you know,
I didn't like this,

915
00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:40.150
like the stuff that these fucking kids could,

916
00:56:40.350 --> 00:56:44.030
they could see any up beheadings card core or all of this shit to do.

917
00:56:44.090 --> 00:56:47.740
They could have access to.
So,
um,
I would never have sex,

918
00:56:47.741 --> 00:56:49.990
some sort of political agenda as to way.
Um,

919
00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:54.040
but are you going to force your child to be recognized as FEMA girl,

920
00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:56.560
are you going to say like,
you get to choose your gender later?

921
00:56:56.710 --> 00:57:01.300
What do you mean force my kid?
If you recollect kids,
a girl,
no sad,
so yeah,

922
00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:04.870
that's what I'm saying.
Subjective now and know that you're actually,

923
00:57:04.871 --> 00:57:09.310
it's kind of a form of child abuse if you make the gender just because their

924
00:57:09.311 --> 00:57:11.170
sexual organs are female.

925
00:57:11.171 --> 00:57:14.000
I don't agree with that and good luck to how you want to raise your kid and I'm

926
00:57:14.001 --> 00:57:18.230
going to raise my kid the way I want to.
Okay.
All right.
Amy,

927
00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:19.820
I feel like you're just,

928
00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:24.130
<v 6>Sweden is based food thinking country in the world when it comes to questioning</v>

929
00:57:24.131 --> 00:57:28.960
gender,
the gender neutral Pronoun Hen is now commonly used by most Swedes.

930
00:57:29.770 --> 00:57:34.030
This is Nikos Room on how this Nico,
Nico is two and a half.

931
00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:36.640
I'm Mayfair is a almost five and a half

932
00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:44.090
<v 3>to being called a woman or a man or a boy or a girl is.
It's shameful.</v>

933
00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:49.430
It's what the idea is that you are going to force your child to be too gender

934
00:57:50.631 --> 00:57:55.631
identify as female even though just because of her sexual organs or daughter is

935
00:57:55.941 --> 00:57:59.870
a girl.
I mean,
and if she wants to work on carburetors or yeah,

936
00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:03.800
do some quote Guy Shit,
I don't give a fuck.
Yeah,
I know,

937
00:58:03.801 --> 00:58:06.260
but it's this leg that way into labor,
her girl.

938
00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:08.900
So then what will cause then once you have two kids,

939
00:58:08.901 --> 00:58:13.610
if you have a boy and a girl,
you always have to say their names then.
Yeah.
Yeah.

940
00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:15.320
Just over and over and over again.
Well,

941
00:58:15.321 --> 00:58:19.400
gender and you can't just go hand came in here and pissed on the floor.

942
00:58:19.550 --> 00:58:23.240
Which hand?
What's wrong with that?
You got,

943
00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:28.280
you got us like colors.
I hope we're not forcing her to wear pink.

944
00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:31.850
I would just not hurt you.
I would appreciate if you stop seeing her.
I'm sorry.

945
00:58:31.851 --> 00:58:36.110
Is that the head they can,
yeah.
I mean,
here's the thing.

946
00:58:36.590 --> 00:58:37.940
There's this big mystery.

947
00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:41.570
People don't realize that sexual organs don't dictate your gender.

948
00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:44.180
That's just a sexual Oregon.
That's the point.
Bill.

949
00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:47.400
I don't know if you can wrap your fucking head around that idea.
You know,

950
00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:51.830
I must be a caveman.
I,
yeah,
you can do whatever you want to do.

951
00:58:51.831 --> 00:58:53.210
As long as you're not hurting people.
I don't,

952
00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:54.550
I don't have a fucking problem with that.

953
00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:58.610
I would be just would like you to open your mind to maybe letting your child

954
00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:01.070
decide what giant my mind I listened to you.

955
00:59:01.071 --> 00:59:04.130
I don't agree with what you're saying and it's my kid and I'll raise her the way

956
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:07.370
her,
the way I want to grow.
There it goes again.

957
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:10.460
I have knee as number we'll call hostile pronouns.
Okay.

958
00:59:11.130 --> 00:59:15.060
<v 6>Family,
the sex you were born with does not dictate your gender identity.</v>

959
00:59:15.490 --> 00:59:19.750
<v 3>Yeah.
Oh,
very sad.
Okay.
I absolutely 100% agree with that.
Okay.</v>

960
00:59:20.110 --> 00:59:23.300
But I don't think a pronoun dictates no,

961
00:59:23.301 --> 00:59:27.500
and I don't mean to be like all male by saying Dick cisgender white privilege,

962
00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:31.060
um,
which you are right in their heterosexual,
you will write it in there.

963
00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:33.410
I the white women's saying white privilege to me,

964
00:59:33.411 --> 00:59:37.250
it's just because their lives are slightly less awesome than mine is so fucking

965
00:59:37.251 --> 00:59:39.210
annoying.
Oh,

966
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:42.290
I used to do a bit about that.

967
00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:46.070
Although all the white women crying when Hillary Clinton lost like their lives

968
00:59:46.071 --> 00:59:47.020
are going to be that affected,

969
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:49.280
like they still going to be drinking their glass of Rosie at four in the

970
00:59:49.281 --> 00:59:52.970
afternoon,
free pin up to three 58 two.
I have a problem.

971
00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:58.430
Um,
yeah,
I gotta be honest with you.
Like I,

972
00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:01.520
since becoming a parent,
I'm still a rookie,
obviously only a year end.

973
01:00:01.550 --> 01:00:06.550
There's a lot of shit that other parents say to me or stuff that they're doing

974
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:10.310
that I observe it and I just fucking,

975
01:00:10.311 --> 01:00:12.830
I just fade back because,

976
01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.050
because I,
I,

977
01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.860
I understand how much they love their kid so they,

978
01:00:20.861 --> 01:00:23.870
and I'm not going to go in and fuck with whatever it is that they're doing,

979
01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:28.610
which is why it's so crazy that these people who've decided to do this,
not that,

980
01:00:28.611 --> 01:00:31.940
that they've decided to do this hand thing is that they're now going to fucking

981
01:00:31.941 --> 01:00:35.360
attack people who don't.
Right.
Right.
Which is where all that,

982
01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:40.190
you're not liberal anymore.
Right.
You are a fascist,

983
01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:43.940
fascist.
Liberal.
Yes.
That's what you are was you're dictating.

984
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:45.320
But this is the thing though.

985
01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:50.590
They are a very small portion of the population who knows where,

986
01:00:51.271 --> 01:00:55.190
where the pressure points are and they go after advertising money and then

987
01:00:55.191 --> 01:00:58.010
everybody caves in and everybody has to live off of money.

988
01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.870
So everybody gets afraid like,
oh fuck,

989
01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:02.330
if I don't start saying hand and if I don't start saying this,

990
01:01:02.331 --> 01:01:04.340
then I'm gonna lose my job.
I can't.
We're going to become homeless,

991
01:01:04.341 --> 01:01:07.430
we're going to live in our cars or it's going to be cars.

992
01:01:07.431 --> 01:01:10.970
I just said this privilege in our car and these minority,

993
01:01:10.971 --> 01:01:14.930
the very small group of people,
like you said,
these far,
far,

994
01:01:14.931 --> 01:01:17.750
far less paper tiger and everybody's folding.
Yeah.

995
01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:22.040
It's really interesting how they got to dictate the norms now like these,

996
01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:24.040
these outliers of society,

997
01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:28.610
because people are choosing self preservation for logic.

998
01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:32.630
Chicken shits over yet and the sky is falling and it's a fucking acorn on your

999
01:01:32.631 --> 01:01:34.730
head.
And I'm not saying that,

1000
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:39.770
that all that hence shit is bullshit.
It's,

1001
01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:43.310
it's like they're there.
What they're trying to do is a good thing.

1002
01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:44.660
Their heart is in the right place,

1003
01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:50.020
but to then become like this fucking fist that is just beating on people

1004
01:01:50.841 --> 01:01:54.020
everyone else has to do.
And that's a,
you know,

1005
01:01:54.021 --> 01:01:58.430
if I'm cool with you doing it and I'm doing it my way and I'm not forcing you to

1006
01:01:58.431 --> 01:01:59.241
do it my way,

1007
01:01:59.241 --> 01:02:04.241
then like why can't you give me that same common courtesy as an adult?

1008
01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:09.020
I guess they feel oppressed too because I guess they feel like,

1009
01:02:09.021 --> 01:02:12.050
well I've been having to do it your way for all this time.

1010
01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:14.330
We should all do it my way now or something.
I don't know.

1011
01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.540
I'm just trying to think of,
I guess,

1012
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:19.350
but it's like I didn't come up with the way and I never told you to do it your

1013
01:02:19.351 --> 01:02:23.760
way,
but then it's also like that would just be like,
uh,
you know,

1014
01:02:23.761 --> 01:02:24.900
somebody murdered my family,

1015
01:02:24.901 --> 01:02:27.600
said I'm going to go out and start murdering other people's families.
Right.

1016
01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:29.940
That'd be fine.
And then I'd be like a,
then I'm right.

1017
01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:33.710
<v 6>How is use key for them?</v>

1018
01:02:33.830 --> 01:02:37.190
Sometimes it's mixed and it depends,
you know,

1019
01:02:37.191 --> 01:02:41.540
because in Sweden we have hen the gender neutral pronoun in Swedish.

1020
01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.850
I think Mika has always said when I've asked,

1021
01:02:43.851 --> 01:02:46.640
it's been she or Ken.

1022
01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:51.030
<v 3>So the other thing is you could also do changing pronouns if you wanted to do</v>

1023
01:02:51.031 --> 01:02:53.520
that with your child.
Like have led to it.

1024
01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:56.070
I don't think I've ever given a shit less about a topic.

1025
01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.120
If this is what people want to do,
go ahead,
go ahead and do it.
But you know,

1026
01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:04.200
there's like certain things like you just,
you know,
certain things,
you come in,

1027
01:03:04.201 --> 01:03:05.310
you're like,
hey,
you know,
let's,
I'd like,

1028
01:03:05.311 --> 01:03:08.070
there's all this stuff in education that blows my mind that people are talking

1029
01:03:08.071 --> 01:03:12.130
about that I,
I,
but I am open to everything.
Look,
this is the thing to it.

1030
01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:15.590
If people across the street use Hana,

1031
01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:17.130
whatever the fuck they're going to say this county,

1032
01:03:17.131 --> 01:03:20.460
and that's what they want me to do,
I'll do it when I'm addressing their kids.

1033
01:03:20.461 --> 01:03:23.340
But when I'm in my house,
I'm going to do what I want to do.
If you don't mind.

1034
01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:27.120
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
No,
I do have a problem with that,
that I,

1035
01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:31.510
you'd be sorry.
Yeah.
Fuck off.
Yeah.

1036
01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:35.880
You want to come over for a barbecue?
Yeah.
One thing we may heads,

1037
01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:40.320
would you have a barbecue with the hens if they weren't cons.
Yeah.

1038
01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:43.140
If they weren't constantly dumping their fucking agenda.

1039
01:03:43.141 --> 01:03:47.700
And then also like secretly trying to put their agenda and to my kid,
like,

1040
01:03:47.730 --> 01:03:52.620
like a fucking lunatic flipping a burger and then they'd be talking to that

1041
01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:54.590
single parents are fucking psychos.
They do that.
Like,

1042
01:03:54.690 --> 01:03:57.900
like if you like raising your kid is like a vegetarian and shit.

1043
01:03:58.230 --> 01:04:00.990
Like people who eat meat like they want,
they want like people,

1044
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.090
just the thing about humans,

1045
01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:07.440
the big flaw that we got is that a lot of times we,

1046
01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:11.870
we wanna we wanna win more than finding out what's right.
Right.

1047
01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:14.610
You just want to win.
Totally.
So,
uh,

1048
01:04:14.611 --> 01:04:18.410
it can cause you to do shit like that.
And uh,
you know,

1049
01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:22.050
and I bet I've been guilty of it.
Oh,
that's a hand from fucking Sweden.

1050
01:04:25.770 --> 01:04:30.150
Do you feel like you want to be right a lot?
No.
I want to win.

1051
01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:31.290
You want to when I'm saying no,

1052
01:04:31.291 --> 01:04:34.620
I would love to find out what all the right answers are.
But you want to win.

1053
01:04:34.650 --> 01:04:38.250
But uh,
yeah,
I find like when I'll be arguing with my wife that I want to win,

1054
01:04:38.251 --> 01:04:42.750
but I,
over the years as I've matured,
I want to win for less time.
Right.

1055
01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:46.560
If I know I'm wrong,
right.
A bad guy.
Right.
You know what your eye,
your eye,

1056
01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:49.150
I've found,
I should've said Cock sucker motherfucking car.

1057
01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:50.003
I shouldn't have said that.

1058
01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:55.220
I found the garage door that the being right thing for me is the urge was

1059
01:04:55.411 --> 01:04:59.250
strongest always with my mom and that as I've gotten older,

1060
01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:02.040
become a parent and just realize how,

1061
01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:07.790
how much energy it takes that I constantly throw in the towel before it starts.

1062
01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:12.510
Just I don't even,
I don't care about winning,
I just,
it's like self preservation.

1063
01:05:12.511 --> 01:05:16.690
That is a,
that is a high level of existing that I'm trying to get to.

1064
01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:18.780
What I just like this.
Uh,

1065
01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:23.940
I did real well over the last couple of years.

1066
01:05:23.951 --> 01:05:28.170
Especially like,
you know,
holidays are like big get togethers where it,

1067
01:05:28.171 --> 01:05:31.750
when people start fucking doing that.
Oh my God,
Hillary Clinton.
Oh my God.

1068
01:05:31.751 --> 01:05:35.260
Trump on there by the left.
Oh my God.
The right fucking transgender people.

1069
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:37.150
Whatever topic they're talking about.
Sure.

1070
01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:41.890
And somebody is just going on like a rent and if they say something that I don't

1071
01:05:41.891 --> 01:05:45.820
necessarily agree with,
I used to,
I would have just fucking go right.

1072
01:05:45.821 --> 01:05:50.590
Like a mosh pit.
I would go right in the middle of it.
Now what I do is,

1073
01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:55.540
my default thing now is to myself,
I just go,
oh boy.
Yeah that's it.

1074
01:05:55.600 --> 01:06:00.280
And then I leave and I'm trying to go back to the old school rules and used to

1075
01:06:00.281 --> 01:06:04.390
be you didn't talk politics or religion at a social thing?

1076
01:06:04.391 --> 01:06:06.250
It was considered rude.
Yeah.

1077
01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:10.960
Cause it's going to cause fights and it was like one of those.
And you,
I've never

1078
01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:15.600
ever had a political or religious argument with someone who didn't agree with
me.

1079
01:06:15.601 --> 01:06:18.940
We're in the end,
we've been like,
you know what?
Now I think the way you think.

1080
01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:24.080
Of course all you do is blow out your voice.
Screaming yellow feel.
Yeah,
yeah.

1081
01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.670
You'd just,
yeah.
And then you're terrible.
Then you're a bad mood.

1082
01:06:26.671 --> 01:06:29.060
You're going to get your car,
you're going to drive like an asshole.
Yeah.

1083
01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:33.780
And it's just,
uh,
you just got,
I save it for the stage now.
I'd just be like,
hey,

1084
01:06:33.781 --> 01:06:38.400
this person said this.
I'll say my point to a crowd,
you know?

1085
01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:39.600
And then maybe I'll get heckled,
like,

1086
01:06:39.601 --> 01:06:42.720
that'll be like the worst argument I'll get in,
but I just,
um,

1087
01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:47.490
yeah,
I don't,
I don't,
I don't have any answers to it and I,

1088
01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:50.980
and I don't want to argue with people anymore,
so I can't just,
I just cannot.
Oh,

1089
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:55.600
right,
okay.
I just do it to avoid the feeling of how upset I'll know I'll get,

1090
01:06:55.750 --> 01:07:00.550
oh boy.
Yep.
Yeah,
definitely my own,
oh boy.
Oh boy.
Oh boy.
Yeah.
No,
no,
no.
Good point.

1091
01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:02.530
I actually go like,
I see what you're saying.

1092
01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:05.350
Even when it's like totally opposite,
I'll be like,
yeah,
I know what you mean.

1093
01:07:05.770 --> 01:07:08.170
I see what you mean is I don't want to fight with them.
I don't want to argue.

1094
01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.360
Yeah.
But people like,
it's funny,

1095
01:07:10.361 --> 01:07:12.700
like they tried to like put their like agenda in deck.

1096
01:07:12.701 --> 01:07:15.520
You'd just be hanging out with your kids and stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1097
01:07:15.521 --> 01:07:18.320
Isn't she cute with that little toy phone that she has?
You know,

1098
01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:22.600
I'll tell you what,
if Trump passes this bill,
but blah,
blah blah.
Oh boy.
Oh right.

1099
01:07:22.610 --> 01:07:24.940
There we go.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Are you,
um,

1100
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:27.920
are you road dog in it right now or no?
Um,

1101
01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:31.780
I took January off cause it was my daughter's birthday and I just wanted the

1102
01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:36.550
whole month like assault and number nine.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Are At Lambeau?
Uh,
no I did.

1103
01:07:36.610 --> 01:07:40.510
Uh,
I made her a cake though.
That's nice.
So that's my tradition.
Die Every year.

1104
01:07:40.511 --> 01:07:44.470
I'm going to make her a cake.
So,
uh,
hopefully that'll make up for,
uh,
you know,

1105
01:07:44.471 --> 01:07:49.180
my outburst or whatever,
which I'm really going to try not to do.
Um,

1106
01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:50.710
<v 0>yeah.</v>

1107
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:54.430
<v 3>Yeah.
I got a lot of work to do that,
so she won't eventually hate me someday.</v>

1108
01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:57.070
Do you think about that?
I think about it all the time.
All the time.
No,

1109
01:07:57.071 --> 01:07:59.710
because I am a very hateful person.
If you live with me,

1110
01:08:01.810 --> 01:08:04.330
I have my good qualities or whatever.
It's weird,
man.

1111
01:08:04.331 --> 01:08:07.060
If I could just stay in the energy that I am right now.
Yeah.

1112
01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:11.500
If I could just stay in this during times of heightened emotion.
Yeah.

1113
01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:16.850
Uh,
it's really my goal because I think if I learned how to do that,

1114
01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:21.630
I would,
I'm doing everything else fine.
Yeah.

1115
01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:24.770
And if I could just,
but that thing is so bad,

1116
01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:28.250
it's like water damage.
It leaks into all areas of my life.

1117
01:08:28.251 --> 01:08:31.770
I could just get that under control.
That energy.
Yeah.

1118
01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:36.110
It's like what could she bitch about?
Right,
right.
I saw you.

1119
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:39.830
I got a job.
I'm bringing in good money.
We'll live in a great life.
Right.

1120
01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:44.600
You don't really have any wants.
Yeah.
With,
you know,
I cook,

1121
01:08:44.810 --> 01:08:48.380
I like doing dishes.
Jesus,
you know,

1122
01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:53.320
you're not a fucking maniac.
I'm a maniac,
dude.
I,
I,
I just,
I wake up,
I,

1123
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:57.060
my motors running and I get shit done.
You know,
we were at that part,
but yeah,

1124
01:08:57.140 --> 01:09:01.340
I snap like,
you know,
too much.
Is it,

1125
01:09:01.490 --> 01:09:06.200
is it really often the snapping?
Uh,

1126
01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:10.730
it's,
it's,
you know,
I want to say it's gotten better,
but,
uh,

1127
01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:15.610
she doesn't see my champion really know.
You know,
I,
I got to work on,

1128
01:09:15.650 --> 01:09:19.010
I remember,
uh,
we know we ran into each other at that party a few weeks ago.

1129
01:09:19.770 --> 01:09:23.260
Remember that?
No recollection.
Yes.
Okay.
Um,

1130
01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.460
that was one of the things I left was like,
man,

1131
01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:28.010
you seem like you're in a really good mood.
That's what was my,

1132
01:09:28.011 --> 01:09:32.420
that was my thought about it.
Like,
you were like,
just like you just found out,

1133
01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:36.470
I dunno that they fucking sold the house or some shit.
You know,
like,

1134
01:09:36.471 --> 01:09:41.120
you were just like,
you had such a happy demeanor.
I was like,
Geez.

1135
01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:45.170
Yeah,
it wasn't a good,
well,
that's good.
I don't get that review that often,

1136
01:09:45.171 --> 01:09:47.930
so that's good.
I might even have to tell my wife that.

1137
01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:49.670
I think you should know that party we went to,

1138
01:09:49.671 --> 01:09:53.210
Tom Segura said that I had a really,
really nice energy.

1139
01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:55.450
You know I played drums with somebody the other day and they,

1140
01:09:55.451 --> 01:09:58.790
and she was on bass and she said,
you got,
you got a good energy.

1141
01:09:59.210 --> 01:10:02.000
This is shit that I've never heard.
I was like,
wow.
Yeah.

1142
01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:05.180
That's what I took away from that part.
It's like bill's and are really good.

1143
01:10:05.450 --> 01:10:09.740
I think he's way,
you seem much happier than the first time you did the show.

1144
01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:11.000
I'd say.
I mean

1145
01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:16.250
you seem a lot happier than you were.
It's like,

1146
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:19.580
I don't want to bring you back to that.
What?
That actually breaks my heart.

1147
01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:22.550
Like the egg shells that you just said that,
cause I don't want to be that guy.

1148
01:10:23.090 --> 01:10:26.640
Never wanted to be that guy.
And I became that.
I became that guy.
Cause you,

1149
01:10:26.650 --> 01:10:31.650
you just a little more introverted I think in a little more maybe distrustful.

1150
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.230
It felt,
oh back then I'll have solution.
Had the guard up.
Yeah,
the gardener.

1151
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:40.580
Where's it coming from?
Me?
Like I'm fucking bill burr.
I was like the black dude.

1152
01:10:40.581 --> 01:10:43.580
And predators shaving my head,
I can see it over there.
And then trees.

1153
01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:46.960
I was a paranoid lunatic.
Yeah.

1154
01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:50.870
So what do you think hat like less than that over the light got out of

1155
01:10:50.871 --> 01:10:51.980
conspiracy theory.

1156
01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:56.270
I stopped doing that because it was just becoming insane and it was becoming

1157
01:10:56.271 --> 01:10:59.390
that guy that you didn't want to talk to and uh,

1158
01:10:59.510 --> 01:11:03.320
I stopped watching the news because I just realized it's just like I can't solve

1159
01:11:03.321 --> 01:11:06.740
any of these problems and knowing that they exist makes me sad.

1160
01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:10.550
So I just watch sports and you know,

1161
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
hang out with my kid and thing.
I'm all about the movement but I,

1162
01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:17.280
I'm not the leader of the movement.
Right.
Okay.

1163
01:11:17.281 --> 01:11:21.810
If somebody wants to fucking figure out how to clean up all that trash and the

1164
01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:24.750
Pacific Ocean,
I'm all about it.
I don't know how to do it,

1165
01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:28.230
but I'm not going to watch a documentary looking at it and seeing my,

1166
01:11:28.231 --> 01:11:31.470
all my toothbrushes for my entire life still floating out there cause they made

1167
01:11:31.471 --> 01:11:33.710
out of plastic.
Like,

1168
01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:36.690
I need a new toothbrush right now and I can't get myself to fucking buy one

1169
01:11:36.691 --> 01:11:40.830
cause I'm like,
this thing is going to be in the ocean 200 years after I'm dead.

1170
01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:44.640
Broken down into like little particles that a porpoise is going to breathe into

1171
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:47.160
because God forbid,
you know,

1172
01:11:47.490 --> 01:11:51.540
I got a cavity so I'm fucking with this thing in the middle that lives thousands

1173
01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:56.410
of miles,
not even in the same like world is me.
Can I send you a quip?
I Dunno.

1174
01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:00.100
What equip is this?
A new toothbrush?
Oh,
you know what you look,

1175
01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.410
you're looking at or write a prescription.

1176
01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:05.310
I feel like this is the end of a therapy session.
I'm going to send you a quick,

1177
01:12:05.490 --> 01:12:08.690
okay.
Just let me see.
What is it quip?
It's a tooth to tooth brush.

1178
01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:12.140
Is it a good one?
Yeah,
it's really good.
It's a fancy really fancy one.
Please.

1179
01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:15.210
It's on me.
You can fucking throw or you just try it out.

1180
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:17.370
Is this how you handle your relationships and people were,

1181
01:12:17.371 --> 01:12:20.940
I was just should have bitched about something bigger.
Yeah.
Fucking hate my car.

1182
01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:22.920
So that,
you know,
you get your car

1183
01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:28.470
now you've been with your lovely wife for how long?

1184
01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:33.140
How long have you guys been together?
Uh,
I don't know.
Like 1415 years.
Yeah.

1185
01:12:33.150 --> 01:12:35.480
It's a good run.
I love him more than ever.
I've get,

1186
01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:39.450
see she's the best fucking happy rest.
Nice.
I know.
It's refreshing.

1187
01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:42.420
I hate when people hate their spouses.
You can always,

1188
01:12:42.450 --> 01:12:46.260
I bitch about her on stage but I love it.
No,
but you meant it.

1189
01:12:46.290 --> 01:12:49.680
I fucking saw that bit and you meant it.
All right.
Don't yell at me.

1190
01:12:49.710 --> 01:12:54.280
So you got to put my head through the dresser because I love you.
You

1191
01:12:55.800 --> 01:13:00.210
know,
you're always looking for ways to spice it up.

1192
01:13:00.211 --> 01:13:02.460
Every relationship is,
I wouldn't want to bring that to me.

1193
01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:04.310
I'm wondering if that's what you're looking to do.

1194
01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:07.440
Don't say that I you will consider something different.

1195
01:13:08.290 --> 01:13:12.520
<v 7>Hi Melanie.
I'm Scottio with ecstatic hearts.
Tantra.</v>

1196
01:13:13.150 --> 01:13:16.930
I was just wanting to share that there are many ways to orgasm.

1197
01:13:17.410 --> 01:13:22.410
You don't actually have to be having sex orgasm just from hugging.

1198
01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:29.070
<v 8>Ah,
ah,</v>

1199
01:13:29.370 --> 01:13:30.510
ah.

1200
01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:35.460
<v 3>You know what's funny is they like if you switch their hair,</v>

1201
01:13:35.461 --> 01:13:36.480
they can be each other.

1202
01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.080
They each other,

1203
01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:47.300
<v 7>the whole body can be orgasmic and especially when you start off awesome boss</v>

1204
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:52.060
law,
why they stopped everything can be a trigger for her.

1205
01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:53.580
That's awesome.
Yeah.

1206
01:13:53.610 --> 01:13:58.610
That would you and your wife go to a con hugging seminar if we send you that?

1207
01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.353
<v 3>Because that would,</v>

1208
01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:05.990
it would just interfere with all the things I'm trying to succeed with.

1209
01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:09.170
Like if I could just,
you know,
a water bottle,

1210
01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.010
you just touch it with your fingertips will bring you to orgasm.

1211
01:14:12.011 --> 01:14:14.090
I would never be able.
That's amazing.
Yeah.

1212
01:14:14.170 --> 01:14:16.660
Good for them that they've found that doing they're full of shit though.

1213
01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:19.490
Well I think it'd be weird when they have a baby and that was in the rails,

1214
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:22.660
how soft it is and it just,
then now there are two open when they become like,

1215
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:25.540
oh my God,
it's relative against the baby.
Yeah.

1216
01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:29.740
I just loving it a different way than you did you do with your,

1217
01:14:29.741 --> 01:14:34.360
if your wife came home and was like,
we need to start getting into tantric staff.

1218
01:14:34.361 --> 01:14:38.050
I'm,
I booked a seminar I want,
I really want to be open to that.
And I would say,

1219
01:14:38.051 --> 01:14:43.030
no,
I'm not going.
Do you want to read up on it?
Once you go to like a,

1220
01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:47.740
uh,
uh,
uh,
public sex thing with other couples,
it's just you like the,

1221
01:14:47.741 --> 01:14:52.720
the fortress you've left the gate open and some Weirdo that's is going to come

1222
01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:52.990
fuck.

1223
01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:57.070
And I should judge some fucking person that's in the shit that I'm not into is

1224
01:14:57.071 --> 01:15:00.010
going to get in there.
And uh,
you know,
and there's just,
yeah.

1225
01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:04.150
Even think they're going to infiltrate your wife and your relationship.
Yeah.

1226
01:15:04.151 --> 01:15:08.350
I just think you're just bringing up something that's,
yeah.

1227
01:15:08.351 --> 01:15:11.530
You open up Pandora's box.
That's why upon intent,
that's a wise no.

1228
01:15:11.531 --> 01:15:15.370
What if she were to get into other things?
Exploring her femininity.

1229
01:15:16.050 --> 01:15:17.650
Um,
well this,

1230
01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:22.750
so a clip we could show him about the woman who was exploring her femininity.

1231
01:15:23.230 --> 01:15:25.580
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
You guys don't have to do the long set up.

1232
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:27.820
See if we can just watch funny clips if you want to.
No,
no,

1233
01:15:27.821 --> 01:15:32.380
it's just we wanted to see,
um,
all right.
Oh,
how I felt about it.
Yeah.
Um,

1234
01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:35.710
or if your wife were to suddenly do something like this.
Yeah.

1235
01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:38.440
You have great glasses by the way.
Thanks.
I just got them.

1236
01:15:38.441 --> 01:15:42.710
My vision is getting terrible.
Bad to do.
You look good in those.
I,
I've,

1237
01:15:42.711 --> 01:15:45.400
I've tried on glasses.
It's not a good thing.
No.

1238
01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:53.710
<v 9>The first thing I thought of those real effective force.
Next Steps.</v>

1239
01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:54.573
Second thought.
What?

1240
01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:55.221
<v 3>I actually,</v>

1241
01:15:55.221 --> 01:15:57.940
the first I was like is that the woman from the bangles that I had the crush.

1242
01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:03.220
Oh isn't once we know what she's doing right there though.
This woman,

1243
01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.420
she's coming with finger paint.
Okay.

1244
01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:12.260
<v 10>Yeah.
And I just wanted to share with all of you why don't need to,</v>

1245
01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:13.670
yeah.
Shami.

1246
01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:18.760
Placing menstrual blood all over my face and what power it holds for us as women

1247
01:16:19.941 --> 01:16:24.470
to fully [inaudible] this part of self that we've been shaming because so many

1248
01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:25.820
lifetimes.
Yes.

1249
01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:30.860
<v 3>The overcorrection.
Yeah.
He's that show a graph.
The videos.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

1250
01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.950
But you're going to wait now.
She'll get away with it cause she's beautiful now.

1251
01:16:33.951 --> 01:16:35.610
What kind of reaction do you think she would've gotten?

1252
01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:39.980
If she did black guys who want to fuck and fuck it for free rent that's put out

1253
01:16:39.981 --> 01:16:43.460
that video,
we wouldn't know.
We wouldn't have seen it because there's so many.

1254
01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:47.480
There's so much of that.
Like that guy was just in a,
he flipped the script.
Yeah,

1255
01:16:47.481 --> 01:16:49.610
he does.
Yeah,
he did.
Yeah.

1256
01:16:50.150 --> 01:16:52.470
He might have actually been re reading from somebody else.

1257
01:16:52.471 --> 01:16:56.240
That might have been plagiarism,
but
that's like,

1258
01:16:56.241 --> 01:16:57.860
we know that that we used to be a brilliant fit.

1259
01:16:57.890 --> 01:17:02.630
Announce a hacky thing when somebody like croons like psycho lyrics to a song.

1260
01:17:02.690 --> 01:17:03.710
[inaudible] switching it up.

1261
01:17:03.711 --> 01:17:07.800
You're not sure that that's basically what that guy was doing sex way.

1262
01:17:08.010 --> 01:17:11.420
It's interesting you brought her looks because what we were saying a few

1263
01:17:11.421 --> 01:17:14.300
episodes ago,
if this were not an attractive woman,

1264
01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:16.220
there'd be a whole different reaction.

1265
01:17:16.221 --> 01:17:20.460
I mean the fact that she might've created a new genre of porn period on the

1266
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:25.070
blood.
On her face.
Yeah.
Like if that woman was at the hugging seminar,

1267
01:17:25.130 --> 01:17:28.460
I might've been more open to it and I'm really sick of like people.

1268
01:17:28.461 --> 01:17:32.030
Like that's another thing like regular looking people all the way to ugly people

1269
01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:35.980
trying to convince us that that our,

1270
01:17:35.981 --> 01:17:38.910
our standards of beauty where somehow it's like,
no,

1271
01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:44.480
it's fucking beautiful and they should be naked and we shouldn't be most

1272
01:17:46.611 --> 01:17:51.530
upsetting with children when there's ugly children and people keep saying that

1273
01:17:51.531 --> 01:17:55.850
like,
you're beautiful.
It upsets me so much.
You know,
I'm thinking more of adults.

1274
01:17:56.250 --> 01:18:00.230
I'm thinking of this movement where they,
okay,
yeah.
Oh boy.
Oh boy.

1275
01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.700
I'm talking about where they're like the,

1276
01:18:02.710 --> 01:18:07.280
the morbidly obese a runway modeling and you're like,
what were beautiful?

1277
01:18:07.281 --> 01:18:10.070
And you're like,
hmm.
I don't think,
no.
I think if you're going to be in a movie,

1278
01:18:10.071 --> 01:18:13.280
you should be,
if you're going to get naked on film and TV and movie,

1279
01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:17.690
you should be in the best fucking shaking.
Could possibly.
Yeah.

1280
01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:21.580
Or you go the other way for the laugh,
right.

1281
01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:23.660
What you're doing it for the laugh,
but like to,

1282
01:18:23.670 --> 01:18:28.670
to sit there and just show off an unworked out body and say that that's brave.

1283
01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:32.820
It's like the bravery is the person who has to look at it.
Yeah.

1284
01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:36.770
Because listen,
we all look at each other's fucking regular bodies.

1285
01:18:36.771 --> 01:18:40.730
You know it when you're in a relationship because you love the other person,

1286
01:18:40.731 --> 01:18:43.640
right?
You have to love somebody.
Right.
You know what I mean?

1287
01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:47.030
That's what's amazing about beautiful people is you're not in love with them,

1288
01:18:47.031 --> 01:18:51.890
but you can see him naked.
That's how that's,
that's,
that's really in shape,
right?

1289
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:55.940
I mean I know the whole idea.
It's like no one wants to see me naked.
I joke,

1290
01:18:55.941 --> 01:18:58.620
you know what it looked like nick and I looked like I have the exact same
bodies,

1291
01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:03.320
the pink panther,
which is just a big head and it's just straight down no ass.

1292
01:19:03.321 --> 01:19:07.730
And then I have like as a pink panther,
it was like in first trimester like Emma,

1293
01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:08.121
there was,

1294
01:19:08.121 --> 01:19:11.390
but we live in an age though that if I was completely naked I would be called

1295
01:19:11.391 --> 01:19:12.224
brave.

1296
01:19:12.230 --> 01:19:16.640
Courageous rather than fucking rude and inconsiderate to make you guys look at

1297
01:19:16.641 --> 01:19:20.180
me.
Oh yeah.
I mean I've been asked to,
I mean be a shirtless.
I'm like,

1298
01:19:20.181 --> 01:19:24.440
it's disgusting.
Like is it for,
cause it's funny cause if it's going to be funny,

1299
01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:26.150
that's one thing.

1300
01:19:26.150 --> 01:19:31.150
But like if if like it can I act like I think I'm good looking right?

1301
01:19:32.031 --> 01:19:35.330
Right.
Then I would do it.
But if I'm going to do it like Yemen,

1302
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:40.750
this is my body deal with it and literally put the pressure on you to not laugh

1303
01:19:40.881 --> 01:19:45.040
at me and ridicule me is I am living in such a world of fucking delusion.

1304
01:19:45.090 --> 01:19:47.780
I don't have any fucking pigment just for me.

1305
01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:52.220
No matter what shape I got into to take my shirt off,
I would be blinding people.

1306
01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:57.030
Right?
Yeah.
I have,
I have other things that I'm good at,
right?

1307
01:19:57.780 --> 01:20:02.510
I can vote.
I can think that's it.
Make,

1308
01:20:04.570 --> 01:20:09.000
uh,
I get errands done really good at that.
I don't mind doing dishes.

1309
01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:12.400
<v 2>He likes doing dishes.
Come to ours.</v>

1310
01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:16.840
We hate it because beauty is a commodity.
You know,
models,
these chicks,

1311
01:20:16.841 --> 01:20:19.900
everyone makes fun of,
they might,
who knows if they're intelligent or not,

1312
01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:21.250
but that's a special thing.

1313
01:20:21.251 --> 01:20:25.750
If you're board member in the 70s if you are born and you had nice teeth and

1314
01:20:25.751 --> 01:20:29.320
real big tits,
not fakers is before cosmo hernia surgery,

1315
01:20:29.530 --> 01:20:34.120
that was a really big deal.
Like we're Calwell the Hov Lane.
Yeah.

1316
01:20:34.150 --> 01:20:37.720
That was special.
Uh,
you know,
now you can go to the surgeon and have whatever,

1317
01:20:37.721 --> 01:20:39.810
correct it,
but back then beauty was a real,

1318
01:20:40.230 --> 01:20:43.290
<v 3>I know it's a gift.
I hate the lie of beauty.</v>

1319
01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:48.380
So much like the idea that we're going to act like these really beautiful people

1320
01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:53.200
are,
you know,
not special.
They are.
That's your special thing.
Yeah.

1321
01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:56.090
I get in a debate with my wife because she goes,
if people want to do that,

1322
01:20:56.130 --> 01:21:00.360
it makes them feel better about themselves.
It's fine.
Which is a very enlightened

1323
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:06.330
point of view.
I look at it is you quit,
you gave in.

1324
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:10.020
It's weak.
What,
what plastic surgery.
Well,

1325
01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:15.530
that's an extreme,
stupid opinion,
but it's what I just like.
Well,

1326
01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:20.290
I'm,
I'm of the belief is,

1327
01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:24.930
especially in this business to age,
naturally,
you're going to look way better.

1328
01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:28.350
Yeah,
I agree.
Because trying to be 50 and looking like you're 25,

1329
01:21:28.351 --> 01:21:30.160
you're just going to look weird.
Yeah.

1330
01:21:30.161 --> 01:21:33.460
It never looks at 25 and you'll,

1331
01:21:33.870 --> 01:21:38.520
but you kept yourself in shape and you look 43 that's about is the best that you

1332
01:21:38.521 --> 01:21:41.880
can hope for.
But as you get older,
uh,
you know,

1333
01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:45.040
and it's,
it's like you're going to,
you,

1334
01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:50.250
you start to look fucking nuts,
but you can play like a,

1335
01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:52.020
a character or something like that.

1336
01:21:52.170 --> 01:21:54.540
I love these people who are still like in you,
if you're 50,

1337
01:21:54.541 --> 01:21:57.360
you're going to be the next Brad Pitt.
It's like a would've happened by now.

1338
01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:57.840
Right?

1339
01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:02.840
Just stop trying to be good looking and just be a fucking regular guy that beat

1340
01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:04.110
you.
Gotta get on that thing.

1341
01:22:04.111 --> 01:22:07.650
So like literally what they're doing with looks would be like if somebody who

1342
01:22:07.651 --> 01:22:12.630
sucks at math should now like design a plane and get into fucking aviation's,

1343
01:22:12.670 --> 01:22:16.560
everybody else has to crash and die because this person feels bad that they're

1344
01:22:16.561 --> 01:22:21.260
not good at math.
Like you gotta be like,
like part of being successful is,

1345
01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:23.460
is not only figuring out what you're good at,

1346
01:22:23.461 --> 01:22:25.710
but figuring out what you suck at so you don't waste time.

1347
01:22:25.770 --> 01:22:30.770
And I have not wasted one day of my life trying to become a male model.

1348
01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:36.100
How much,
like what a fucking treadmill that would be to be on it.

1349
01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:42.300
I would be exactly where I was when I started.

1350
01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:46.900
He started now bill burr,
the hot model be great.

1351
01:22:47.370 --> 01:22:49.110
If I did that,
it would just be,

1352
01:22:49.170 --> 01:22:52.760
it would if I was serious that we just be unintentional comedy and then I would

1353
01:22:52.770 --> 01:22:56.520
make it out of ridicule.
But like that's true.
That's true.
You know,

1354
01:22:56.521 --> 01:23:01.250
like I look at somebody like Pamela Anderson who were at our heyday,

1355
01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:06.040
you were like,
wow,
she will define the 90s right.
And then,

1356
01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:08.760
you know,
as we all do,
we all get older and,

1357
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:13.570
and to try to maintain the persona you had 20 years ago,

1358
01:23:14.050 --> 01:23:17.710
30 years ago.
But that's the regular book.
Terrible.

1359
01:23:18.190 --> 01:23:22.660
Like myself.
If you actually resent good looking people,
which I don't,
I love him.

1360
01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:25.270
I love looking at it.
The fucking,
I did a movie one time,
I would say,

1361
01:23:25.271 --> 01:23:28.330
who was this person was so beautiful.
Like I never had this thought before.

1362
01:23:28.331 --> 01:23:30.640
I was like sh her forearms were beautiful.
Yeah,

1363
01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:32.650
like that's like the level of genetics.

1364
01:23:32.651 --> 01:23:36.460
It's just like you would just like sculpted,
you know?
Um,

1365
01:23:37.390 --> 01:23:39.580
I can't remember my point cause I just started thinking of her forearms,

1366
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:44.650
Pamela and being,
the thing is,

1367
01:23:44.710 --> 01:23:49.120
is the,
all of those people that,
I guess these people have issues with that.

1368
01:23:49.121 --> 01:23:49.451
Oh my God,

1369
01:23:49.451 --> 01:23:51.910
she's so beautiful ended and they don't have to fucking work for anything.

1370
01:23:52.150 --> 01:23:54.820
The thing about it is,
is this the expiration date?

1371
01:23:55.570 --> 01:23:59.690
Those people never age well because everybody's looking like I love when they,

1372
01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:03.010
people go,
oh my God,
did you see so and so?
What the fuck happened to her?

1373
01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.170
You just see songs.
What happened?
He's like,
dude,
what happened to you?

1374
01:24:05.730 --> 01:24:06.490
What happened?

1375
01:24:06.490 --> 01:24:09.910
It's like they're coming down to your fucking level and you weren't good looking

1376
01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:12.610
to begin with.
And you're 20 years old or do you think you look better?

1377
01:24:12.611 --> 01:24:15.070
They need like everybody,
what happened to everybody?
That's right.

1378
01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:18.100
Everybody looks older.
So,
but what you're saying is true,

1379
01:24:18.101 --> 01:24:22.120
cause we talk about that on this show that the cosmetic surgery thing.
Yeah,

1380
01:24:22.230 --> 01:24:25.950
he just looks solid and the truth is,
I mean even though it,

1381
01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:29.900
you can give it both sides.
I've seen it more now.
You know,

1382
01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:33.280
and traveling and stuff is like guys that do it,

1383
01:24:33.281 --> 01:24:36.570
these men that the pullback back,

1384
01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:39.340
their foreheads don't move.

1385
01:24:40.410 --> 01:24:43.150
They have a bad wig and then they,

1386
01:24:43.151 --> 01:24:47.680
they're older and they have just blinding white teeth cause they got the

1387
01:24:47.681 --> 01:24:51.000
pictures of like make them make them super white.
Oh yeah.
It looks like

1388
01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:56.910
it looks like a spotlight from a stadium.
RVC Yeah.
Yeah.
Like,

1389
01:24:56.930 --> 01:25:01.930
like led lights on the front of a jeep and they know like I look dumb and you're

1390
01:25:02.611 --> 01:25:06.130
like,
you look out of your yeah.
And you know what they look like too.

1391
01:25:06.131 --> 01:25:08.110
After awhile they start looking like raceless.

1392
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:11.910
Like it's like that's not a white dude anymore.
That's not Asian.
I don't know.

1393
01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:15.200
Yeah.
It's like are you an alien?
Yeah.

1394
01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:18.660
Do you just fucking land air and you don't know what it is true.

1395
01:25:19.630 --> 01:25:24.020
What's going on with the fake Tanner?
The lit up?
Yeah.

1396
01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:27.930
It just like,
and then this is something that you do with your eyes.
You just,

1397
01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:32.320
you become like a,
uh,
like,
I don't know what it is.
It's almost like animation.

1398
01:25:32.321 --> 01:25:34.950
You don't like the Simpsons look like they like,
they're like,

1399
01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:38.650
like live action animated people.
It's an,

1400
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:43.660
it stands out more maybe because it's newer for men,
but like when it's men,

1401
01:25:43.661 --> 01:25:48.470
I just,
I'm more feminine.
You look worse.
You Do,
you look more feminine.
We do.

1402
01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:51.130
You know what?
I noticed that when I did the shopping to do doing,
coming up,

1403
01:25:51.131 --> 01:25:56.131
I can type a date during the Irvine Improv on the 30th and 31st of January.

1404
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:58.890
That was the first time.
Like,
I used to think that like,
uh,

1405
01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:01.780
the real housewives of Orange County.
I said,
okay,
all right.

1406
01:26:01.810 --> 01:26:04.100
They pick like some extreme people from down here.

1407
01:26:04.101 --> 01:26:05.240
And I went down there and I did it.

1408
01:26:05.450 --> 01:26:10.100
And like I saw like nine people that had like back when Bruce was Bruce the

1409
01:26:10.101 --> 01:26:14.390
Bruce Jenner fucking I jobs like walking around the mall and they all had like

1410
01:26:14.391 --> 01:26:17.180
those laminated phase like in my eyes were watering,

1411
01:26:17.181 --> 01:26:20.790
looking at them like going like they look like something like that.

1412
01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:24.110
He had it hot wax on there.
You don't look younger.

1413
01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:26.930
You just look like that face what you're talking about.

1414
01:26:26.931 --> 01:26:31.130
The polled and the lips that are so smooth and shine.

1415
01:26:31.150 --> 01:26:35.270
The neck always gives your way.
Of course.
You know what's weird though is if you,

1416
01:26:35.310 --> 01:26:38.960
if you keep working out and like your body can stay looking young but your head,

1417
01:26:38.961 --> 01:26:40.490
I don't know what the fuck it is with your head.

1418
01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:42.890
It's like no sit ups or anything for your head.
Like I don't know,

1419
01:26:42.891 --> 01:26:46.010
he keeps you ahead and shape what your head just gives it away.

1420
01:26:46.730 --> 01:26:50.150
That's the ring on the fucking,
I think cause it's outside your shirt.

1421
01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:53.740
Like the rest of your body's like cover it up.
This is just taking the weather.

1422
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:58.430
Hey,
will you put up that picture of Dennis,
the guy from cat house?
The pimp.

1423
01:26:58.790 --> 01:27:03.030
Oh yeah,
I bet.
I bet.
Gifts page.
Great.
Gimps like when those,

1424
01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:07.160
that whole zipped up fucking leather so preserved and they're under the floor.

1425
01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:09.230
It's like there been a human wine cellar all day.

1426
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:14.510
But Dennis is a great example of that stuff.
Super White White Veneer.

1427
01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:18.640
Uh Yeah.
He looks like shit.
You got your,

1428
01:27:18.641 --> 01:27:21.380
if you get the super white veneer then you have to get the fake Tan.

1429
01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:26.150
Then you've got something that you start when you start wearing like you know

1430
01:27:26.151 --> 01:27:27.410
the guys who keep wearing tank,

1431
01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:29.900
like guys who keep wearing tank tops past a certain age.

1432
01:27:30.530 --> 01:27:35.060
It's like the only way that works is if you totally Jack are,
you're a fat fuck.

1433
01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:38.810
But if you just have like those,
those old arms,

1434
01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:44.060
just like this is what he looked like before he got them.
Okay.
So this is,

1435
01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:45.440
this is just regular teeth.

1436
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:50.000
Like you just look like a regular street that watching fucking sick.

1437
01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:52.310
I love that watch.

1438
01:27:53.210 --> 01:27:56.810
And everybody who doesn't know this is the bunny ranch owner of the famous bunny

1439
01:27:56.811 --> 01:28:01.710
ranch owner has the,
the the show was,

1440
01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:06.260
it was called cat house.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was on HBO for a show called whorehouse.

1441
01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:09.770
It's cat house bell.
It's different.

1442
01:28:09.771 --> 01:28:13.910
It's human trafficking house that was taken.

1443
01:28:15.050 --> 01:28:19.070
There's a lot of fun.
It's a lot of shows out there.
We run out a name.

1444
01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:23.600
It's like you to name a standup special mouth,
like,
oh,
it's the worst.

1445
01:28:23.601 --> 01:28:25.490
That was the worst experience.
The latest one.
I don't know.

1446
01:28:25.491 --> 01:28:28.220
The first two are easy for me to name.
Couldn't name the third one.

1447
01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:31.430
I just was like sending in submissions and I was like,

1448
01:28:31.431 --> 01:28:34.280
what do you think of these six titles?
No,
I didn't know what to say.

1449
01:28:34.281 --> 01:28:38.330
I didn't know what to call it.
You've named them.
Well,
you've had good names.
Oh,

1450
01:28:38.331 --> 01:28:41.840
thank you.
Walk your way.
Okay.
Here's his latest one.

1451
01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:48.110
Looks totally different.
Oh yes.
Hold on.

1452
01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:52.960
I'm trying to find him.
I'm trying to find a way to go.

1453
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:58.250
Yeah,
that's a problem,
Bill.
Is that those red flags?
I just find him so endearing.

1454
01:28:58.251 --> 01:29:02.460
My husband and I.
Those are not,
those are crazy.

1455
01:29:02.610 --> 01:29:05.310
Those are crazy teeth.
Yeah,
and the thing is too,
like what?

1456
01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:06.520
What you supposed to do that?

1457
01:29:06.521 --> 01:29:08.510
I worked in a dental office with my dad for a while.

1458
01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:11.160
What you're supposed to do is when you've fixed somebody's,

1459
01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:14.580
it's supposed to be subtle like cause they totally,

1460
01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:18.300
it not only did they whiten them up and they obviously fixed that chipped tooth

1461
01:29:18.301 --> 01:29:21.180
as what you would want to do a little composite action there on number nine.

1462
01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:24.980
I'm sorry it's all coming back to eat.

1463
01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:29.250
They totally changed the alignment of the teeth and then there's so perfect,

1464
01:29:29.410 --> 01:29:32.070
you know like you want somebody whose yard is so landscape like you know you're

1465
01:29:32.071 --> 01:29:34.950
not supposed to walk on it.
It's like you literally can't walk on the grass.

1466
01:29:34.951 --> 01:29:37.340
Like you can't have teeth like that.
You can't,
you can't.

1467
01:29:37.470 --> 01:29:40.790
I guess you can because I have the nearest my two friends cause I knocked and

1468
01:29:40.791 --> 01:29:45.570
one of them out as a kid they say they'd have to be at somewhat translucent

1469
01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:47.070
light has to go through them.

1470
01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:50.640
So when the people get them they look like chiclets when they're just white,

1471
01:29:50.641 --> 01:29:53.340
white wine and like just like bricks and your mouth.

1472
01:29:53.341 --> 01:29:56.400
That's when they lived terribly.
Get them like glass or something.

1473
01:29:56.780 --> 01:30:00.660
This is the craziest Mozzarella balls like could do just like shape,

1474
01:30:04.970 --> 01:30:09.680
pretty solid heavy on the MOOC there.
The uh,
the craziest one.
I've,

1475
01:30:09.730 --> 01:30:14.330
I saw
this natural teeth,
Danny Aiello,
Danny,

1476
01:30:15.390 --> 01:30:19.650
his teeth match the age of the face.
That's his.
Yeah.
So his is like,

1477
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:23.070
here's his normal,
this is like his man.
What a great actor by the way.

1478
01:30:24.810 --> 01:30:29.790
But come on these new ones.
I mean,
those are nuts.

1479
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:32.190
Those are crazy.
Here's the thing,

1480
01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:36.750
did they make you know about why they make veneers now that will be like,
oh,

1481
01:30:36.930 --> 01:30:41.790
there'll be nice,
but they'll,
they'll have like normal,
uh,

1482
01:30:41.850 --> 01:30:46.260
color I'm saying,
but like,
that's super white.

1483
01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:50.070
What is that?
Is that maybe like a porcelain?
He just went like a straight,

1484
01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:52.360
what is it?
It's probably having his bathroom redundant.

1485
01:30:52.361 --> 01:30:55.500
They had some leftover material.
I don't know.

1486
01:30:56.550 --> 01:30:59.130
I don't want to make fun of this guy's guy's fucking great.
I know.

1487
01:30:59.131 --> 01:30:59.581
I'm just saying,

1488
01:30:59.581 --> 01:31:02.820
I'm not trying to make fun of me saying that the teeth replacement didn't go

1489
01:31:02.821 --> 01:31:04.650
well.
Let me just think it's too white.

1490
01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:08.310
When's the last time you went to the dentist?
I,
last month.

1491
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:12.450
I'm actually doing Invisalign right now.
Good for you.
Because I,
you know,

1492
01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:15.240
I never had braces.
I just lucked out that they came in pretty straight.

1493
01:31:15.241 --> 01:31:17.910
But as you get older,
like I dunno,

1494
01:31:17.911 --> 01:31:20.400
like your jaw keeps growing and stuff and stuff started.

1495
01:31:20.410 --> 01:31:21.480
I was thinking this guy's,
you know,

1496
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:25.140
and they took a three d model of put my teeth we're going to look like and
stuff.

1497
01:31:25.170 --> 01:31:28.500
And he scared the shit out of me.
It's like I was going to pick Mr Ed psych.
Okay.

1498
01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:32.670
Bold redhead and haven't fucking Freddie Mercury smile.
I can't have that.

1499
01:31:33.490 --> 01:31:37.020
So it's 16 weeks of these things and uh,

1500
01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:40.710
I'm about seven weeks and so,
okay.
And then at the rest of your life,

1501
01:31:40.711 --> 01:31:42.630
you just at night you just wear a night guard,

1502
01:31:42.631 --> 01:31:45.180
which is fine cause I grind my teeth anyways cause I,

1503
01:31:45.181 --> 01:31:50.100
even when I sleep by stress,
like I gotta get this done.
So,
um,
yeah.

1504
01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:53.620
Now had you had your wisdom teeth removed?
Yeah.
Oh,
so that,

1505
01:31:53.670 --> 01:31:56.970
I thought that would prevent that from happening,
but apparently not.
No.

1506
01:31:56.971 --> 01:32:00.160
I just noticed down here they were just getting more and more and it was funny,

1507
01:32:00.161 --> 01:32:01.770
like I,
I thought like,
uh,

1508
01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:05.500
it was these that were the problem is actually behind was like pushing on them

1509
01:32:05.501 --> 01:32:08.140
and like it's pretty amazing though.
But every,
every,

1510
01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:11.050
every week like you put a new one in like on Wednesday,

1511
01:32:11.051 --> 01:32:13.550
so that fucking hearts you on Wednesday.
Right.
And they,

1512
01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:16.720
it just move it just incrementally.
It's Nice,
you know,

1513
01:32:16.721 --> 01:32:19.360
considering like at the point the age that I'm at,

1514
01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:21.790
everything is slowly tapering off.

1515
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.790
It's nice to have something going in like a positive direction.

1516
01:32:25.870 --> 01:32:28.950
So can you eat with them energy?
God,
no.

1517
01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:31.870
You have to take them out and then you got to brush your teeth and floss because

1518
01:32:31.871 --> 01:32:33.460
his animals,
and I know,
I know,

1519
01:32:33.490 --> 01:32:36.490
it's just like if you do that for a week like that,
it's not,

1520
01:32:36.491 --> 01:32:38.110
it's no longer Invisalign.
It's like,
oh,

1521
01:32:38.111 --> 01:32:42.040
I saw you had to eat for the rest of the whole week.
It's like a retainer.

1522
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:44.140
I had braces and retainers.
It's similar.

1523
01:32:45.070 --> 01:32:46.840
You have a nice dentition is how it's said.

1524
01:32:46.841 --> 01:32:50.470
Let me see what you got going on that there.
That's not back.

1525
01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:53.140
I've never had braces anything.

1526
01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:56.790
But they couldn't be wiping his bottom teeth.
No.

1527
01:32:56.810 --> 01:32:58.670
That's when he could go somewhere between what you got in.

1528
01:32:58.690 --> 01:33:03.610
Danny's got really to see your bottom teeth when you smile but,

1529
01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:06.370
but look hot.
But you never even see his bottom teeth when he talks.

1530
01:33:06.371 --> 01:33:10.720
When he does his bottom lip is so big I feel or what is that the fuck man?

1531
01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:15.610
Yeah.
Layoff.
I don't see yours when you talk.
Yeah.

1532
01:33:16.150 --> 01:33:19.270
Say So.
No,
no,
no.
You're trying and are you thinking about your mouth?

1533
01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:23.050
I'm going to steal a look.
You can still look camera.

1534
01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:28.150
I can see both years cause I got this fucking mouth guard and my mouth and I'm

1535
01:33:28.151 --> 01:33:32.800
also not a good looking person.
We've,
we've established this.
Alright,

1536
01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:37.270
let me right there.
You can't see it.
Well that's silly smile.

1537
01:33:37.271 --> 01:33:42.271
That's not a deliberate is that I said cause you grew up a wrestling fan.

1538
01:33:45.490 --> 01:33:49.510
Yeah.
Do you know about this?
Like,
there's like the,
you know,

1539
01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:52.690
whatever the single a league of wrestling,

1540
01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:57.220
like this is like a like guys that like wrestling and kind of do amateur style.

1541
01:33:57.250 --> 01:34:00.940
Oh,
cool.
Um,
open mic rustling open.
My wrestling is the best way to describe it.

1542
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:03.030
And you're speaking of speech patterns.

1543
01:34:03.031 --> 01:34:06.340
So this was sent in as an interesting speech pattern.
This guy named Lou Jean.

1544
01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:09.960
<v 11>I'm just going to throw it to you and I want you to give your opinions and your</v>

1545
01:34:09.961 --> 01:34:14.850
feelings said about you.
Listen up Lou Jane,

1546
01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:18.000
this fright trying.
I seent your video.

1547
01:34:18.001 --> 01:34:20.610
What you call on you too about me and stuff.

1548
01:34:20.670 --> 01:34:25.590
They ain't going to happen to me on July 27.
Listen Up.
You're ugly.

1549
01:34:25.591 --> 01:34:29.730
Short part.
You ain't got to take this belt from me.
Lou Jane.

1550
01:34:29.850 --> 01:34:34.530
I'm sure you're old school.
I ask where I represent you from old school.

1551
01:34:34.531 --> 01:34:36.480
Just a new school.
Lou Jane.

1552
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:40.040
<v 3>Is that the real life?
CLEVELAND?
It feels like it,
right?
It sounds like,</v>

1553
01:34:40.041 --> 01:34:40.970
you know what I,

1554
01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:46.790
I would definitely watch this and I love this fucking village people guy on the

1555
01:34:46.791 --> 01:34:51.320
fucking left.
That's his promoter.
GGL.
I actually could be a stunt double for him.

1556
01:34:51.321 --> 01:34:54.480
I'm not.
You could that it's worked out though.
Yeah.

1557
01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:59.990
Sounds like Forrest Gump.
Yeah.
He has like a such a terrific speech pattern.

1558
01:35:00.110 --> 01:35:02.220
You know that listen up [inaudible] I don't think,

1559
01:35:02.730 --> 01:35:05.780
I don't think he's putting it on.
I don't know.
I know that guy.

1560
01:35:05.781 --> 01:35:07.310
He's a scary dude because he's,

1561
01:35:07.311 --> 01:35:11.480
Tony didn't yell and because it was calm and he's a big guy like that guy.

1562
01:35:11.481 --> 01:35:14.240
I think when the bell rings he might not hear it and you might keep going.

1563
01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:19.450
What happened?
What happened there?
I just want him to kill,

1564
01:35:19.810 --> 01:35:24.300
heal something beautiful.
I was at fight club moment.
Everybody was talking about,

1565
01:35:24.301 --> 01:35:28.150
I saw that movie once of mice and men.
That's what it reminds me.
Oh yeah.

1566
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:31.430
Remember he loves them so much that he kills them all and he's like,

1567
01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:33.890
I was hugging it.
Did you cry when you read it,

1568
01:35:33.891 --> 01:35:37.070
like you finally related to somebody?
Yes,
I did.

1569
01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:41.000
I got really emotional actually in that.
I've never read it.
No,
no.

1570
01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:41.811
This is a few things.

1571
01:35:41.811 --> 01:35:45.110
Like I am a movie that was saw Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory till I was

1572
01:35:45.111 --> 01:35:49.730
like 40 Oh really?
So then I finally just heard I could weave how dark it was.

1573
01:35:49.731 --> 01:35:54.460
I loved it.
I was some kids movie.
Oh my God.

1574
01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:57.260
My wife was like,
the other night she goes,
you want to go to the movies?

1575
01:35:57.261 --> 01:35:58.940
I was like,
yeah,
let's go the movies.
She goes,

1576
01:35:58.941 --> 01:36:02.810
do you want to see like Jumanji like star wars?
And I was like,
no.
She goes,

1577
01:36:02.811 --> 01:36:04.460
why not?
I go,
cause I'm going to Delta.

1578
01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:11.600
Oh my God,
we're trapped in a board game.
Yeah.
I mean I'm 49 years old.

1579
01:36:11.601 --> 01:36:13.910
I can't fucking watch that.
God bless everybody in it.

1580
01:36:13.911 --> 01:36:15.460
They made a ton of fucking money.
But that won't be it.

1581
01:36:15.461 --> 01:36:18.280
And that movie wasn't for me.
Exactly.
So that would be,

1582
01:36:20.230 --> 01:36:24.020
I've watched this take this belt from me,
Lou Jane.

1583
01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:30.320
I hate seeing fucking bomber movies.

1584
01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:33.350
Like you want to see the movie about the guy who's got cancer?

1585
01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:35.940
Oh yeah.

1586
01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:40.210
Kind of a fucking watch this for two hours or white bummers right.

1587
01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:43.260
It's always love bombing and feel like it's a white person.

1588
01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:44.360
White people are like,

1589
01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:48.590
and then the baby had cancer that Casey Affleck,

1590
01:36:48.591 --> 01:36:51.740
where we wait is performance is amazing.
I fucking had to get up and walk out.

1591
01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:56.530
I said Manchester by the sea.
Fuck.
I would never see that.
But we got,
God,

1592
01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:01.970
I don't even have a kid at that point.
I don't even want no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1593
01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:03.050
They all came in.

1594
01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:06.990
The screeners all came in last year we got the stack and we were like white

1595
01:37:06.991 --> 01:37:09.650
bummer,
white bomber wipe bump,
and then it was moonlight.
We're like,

1596
01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:13.460
that's a black bumper.
Cars since moonlight was like aids and like,

1597
01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:17.290
I don't want to watch any of these.
You know?
It's funny,
I saw moon moon.

1598
01:37:17.630 --> 01:37:20.720
I think like,
I think I'm gonna sit and with lighting,

1599
01:37:20.990 --> 01:37:25.070
I know it's supposed to be the,
I know I saw that and I have no idea how it ends.

1600
01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:29.770
Really.
I can never remember him.
Really.
No,
I can't.
I'm a,

1601
01:37:29.820 --> 01:37:34.580
when I saw the usual suspects,
I,
I daydreamed in the middle of it.

1602
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:35.810
All right.
It's like massive,

1603
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:40.670
crazy add back then like I lost focus so I didn't really pay attention.

1604
01:37:40.671 --> 01:37:43.880
So when the end cap and everyone was like freaking out around me and I was just

1605
01:37:43.881 --> 01:37:47.360
like,
I don't have,
I go,
whatever,
I won't,
I won't remember the movie,

1606
01:37:48.020 --> 01:37:49.820
so I'll be able to go back and go see it again.

1607
01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:54.440
But what happened was it became such a legendary movie that everybody said,

1608
01:37:54.460 --> 01:37:58.680
Oh my God,
the ending.
So I,
I,
I you put it together.
No,
no,
no,
no.

1609
01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:02.030
I was never able to go back.
Oh,
and then,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
No,
I want to,

1610
01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:04.800
as it was happening,
I was like,
oh,
so this was all right.

1611
01:38:04.830 --> 01:38:07.980
I'm telling you to ruin it for anybody.
I understood what happened,
but I didn't,

1612
01:38:07.981 --> 01:38:12.300
I wasn't on the ride.
Did you enjoy moonlight?
If that's what it's called?

1613
01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:17.550
Yeah,
I did.
Yeah.
I really liked that movie.
Like I like,
I like movies where I,

1614
01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:21.080
I think like,
okay,
that would happen,
that that's a natural reaction,
blah,
blah,

1615
01:38:21.090 --> 01:38:24.060
blah.
Like,
I either want it to be like totally over the top,

1616
01:38:24.061 --> 01:38:29.061
blowing everything up or just an absurd comedy or like something that seems like

1617
01:38:30.031 --> 01:38:30.960
this is really happening.

1618
01:38:30.990 --> 01:38:34.890
That's shit that exists in the middle that passes itself off as like a real

1619
01:38:34.891 --> 01:38:39.320
gritty movie and it's just like people not holding guns right and shit like
this.

1620
01:38:39.330 --> 01:38:42.720
Stuff like that.
And it starts to annoy me after one.
Yeah.
I like grounded.

1621
01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:47.220
I like grounded comedies where it's like,
it's not big studio comedy of like,

1622
01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:52.440
you know,
like in the nice guys.
Yeah.
One of my favorite fucking movie.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1623
01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:55.900
Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe.
Russell Crowe.
I was a good movie.

1624
01:38:55.901 --> 01:39:00.480
I love that movie.
I like those types of like dark comedies.
But then I just,

1625
01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:04.590
honestly,
the only thing I really want to see that I really go for our thrillers.

1626
01:39:04.650 --> 01:39:09.390
I love suspense.
I love like a political thriller.
I love murder,

1627
01:39:09.391 --> 01:39:12.900
mystery,
all that stuff that's entertainment to me.
I hate horror films.
Horror.

1628
01:39:12.901 --> 01:39:13.650
I'm not entirely,

1629
01:39:13.650 --> 01:39:16.980
I just hate having the shit skate on it cause I always take the ride on them.

1630
01:39:17.150 --> 01:39:20.430
Yeah.
Like everyone.
Blair witch came out and it was like,
that didn't scare me.

1631
01:39:20.431 --> 01:39:22.190
That movie scared the shit out of me.
Really.

1632
01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:25.020
I did a set at the laugh factory and I went and I saw the midnight showing by

1633
01:39:25.021 --> 01:39:28.680
myself and later on and I walked into the parking garage by myself.
I mean,

1634
01:39:28.681 --> 01:39:31.590
I was waiting to see some dude standing in the corner facing the wall freaks you

1635
01:39:31.591 --> 01:39:35.670
out.
That did the ring freaked me out.
Uh,
I,

1636
01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:39.510
what was that Baba dog?
Dog.
Dog.
Do you ever see that fucking one?
No,

1637
01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:43.980
I forget that.
That fucking,
and this is nothing to,
I will literally,

1638
01:39:44.010 --> 01:39:47.340
I literally get angry if there is a horror movie and this some kid,

1639
01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:51.350
little kid in trouble.
Uh,
like I get mad at the movie like foot.

1640
01:39:51.351 --> 01:39:54.540
Not for the fuck would I want to watch this.
We just started dark.

1641
01:39:54.570 --> 01:39:56.850
It'd be something you watch on Netflix,

1642
01:39:57.270 --> 01:40:02.050
but the serious chairman to chairman series,
it's a big hit of you.
You know,

1643
01:40:02.090 --> 01:40:05.220
you haven't seen it though.
I'm going to watch a German horror move.
No,
no,
no.

1644
01:40:05.221 --> 01:40:07.320
It's a series.
It's the monster shit on somebody.

1645
01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:13.110
It's like a stranger things,
but German kind of,

1646
01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:15.910
but there is a kid that goes missing.
I can't,
I can't watch it.

1647
01:40:18.170 --> 01:40:19.640
What was I going to fucking say?
You know,

1648
01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:22.230
we started watching law and order special victims unit

1649
01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:25.013
don't even show me.

1650
01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:28.560
How did it go from happy days to that I know special victims unit,
which is like,

1651
01:40:28.561 --> 01:40:32.650
these are the most egregious violence,
sexual crimes,
and it's a series.

1652
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:37.350
It's like crazy.
You know,
we started watching on Netflix,

1653
01:40:37.351 --> 01:40:40.890
everyone shit on and we were actually enjoying,
is that movie bright?

1654
01:40:41.190 --> 01:40:42.610
The new the Will Smith movie?

1655
01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:47.790
I want to see that we're halfway through it.
I was expecting like a hate watch,

1656
01:40:47.791 --> 01:40:52.100
like a ha ha.
It's entertaining.
I never do that.
Yeah.

1657
01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:55.810
I think that's bad Karma to watch something.
Anything artistic,

1658
01:40:55.811 --> 01:40:57.730
you're gonna Watch it because it sucks as a few of them.

1659
01:40:57.730 --> 01:41:00.040
I guess I can just watch that wrestling thing,
but like,

1660
01:41:00.041 --> 01:41:03.130
I don't do that cause I feel bad for the people,
especially if it's a guy like,

1661
01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:06.040
you know,
who's had great movies.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And you know,

1662
01:41:06.041 --> 01:41:10.450
sometimes they just don't come together,
right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
um,
but her good guy,

1663
01:41:10.451 --> 01:41:13.360
man,
you have a lot empathy.
Yeah,
I do.
Yeah.

1664
01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:17.950
I actually do as much as much content as I am.
Yeah.
I actually,
you know,

1665
01:41:18.970 --> 01:41:21.520
I don't,
but this is my thing.
I don't like kicking somebody when they're down.

1666
01:41:22.090 --> 01:41:24.820
I don't,
but I'm sure you could go back in my act.
I'm sure I'm guilty of it.

1667
01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:27.130
I'm also a hypocrite though.
So they got there you go there.

1668
01:41:27.131 --> 01:41:30.660
You got a cell phone on it before.
So billboard,
it's funny.
He said,
oh,
I got it.

1669
01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:33.670
Irvine dates.
Of course they're all sold out.
Um,

1670
01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:38.860
you can see him in Christ in the fold them again.
And Reno,
Reno Ballroom,

1671
01:41:38.861 --> 01:41:40.960
Santa Barbara,
the Arlington Theater.

1672
01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:44.800
He's going to do the Patrice O'Neal benefit in New York.
February 20th.

1673
01:41:44.801 --> 01:41:49.390
That's right.
Only a few tickets left.
You're going to be in Vancouver.
And uh,

1674
01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:53.320
even we just added a show there.
Check it out,
try it out,
check it out,
try it out.

1675
01:41:54.010 --> 01:41:56.920
Can I do,
what'd you rather with though?
Oh,
of course.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Let's do it.

1676
01:41:56.950 --> 01:42:00.630
Let's do it.
Get to a movie,
other music and yeah,
I don't know.
Okay.

1677
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:06.390
Would you rather smile and only show your bottom teeth or have to get the worst

1678
01:42:08.291 --> 01:42:11.050
boob job ever?
Ah,
have the smile

1679
01:42:11.810 --> 01:42:12.643
<v 0>clearly.</v>

1680
01:42:18.190 --> 01:42:19.030
The top layer,

1681
01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:28.350
chunk compose this music.
Somebody married.

1682
01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:34.350
There's times by my buddy John Sex with your sister.

1683
01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:38.530
They the face grandmother,

1684
01:42:38.710 --> 01:42:43.030
Washington on you masturbating.
Never have another orgasm

1685
01:42:47.740 --> 01:42:50.620
intro with it long enough.
It's going to be a little bit longer.
Hold on.

1686
01:42:51.410 --> 01:42:52.243
What's it now?

1687
01:42:53.790 --> 01:42:58.020
<v 3>Okay.
Okay.
Ready?
Here we go.
Would you rather,
this is just specific for you.</v>

1688
01:42:58.021 --> 01:43:02.460
I crafted this one just for you.
Okay.
Okay.
Would you rather from now on,

1689
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:07.380
you're known as the non-binary comedian Bill Burr Hen,
right?

1690
01:43:07.381 --> 01:43:08.214
I love this already.

1691
01:43:09.180 --> 01:43:11.460
I feel like I need to reinvent myself at this point in my career.

1692
01:43:11.461 --> 01:43:12.660
So I like this so far.

1693
01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:16.170
And you're kind of going to do an Eddie Izzard thing where you maybe you want,

1694
01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:20.250
you might wear like high heels and a skirt for the first half of your show and

1695
01:43:20.251 --> 01:43:24.450
then you might gender flux in the middle of your set and then go back to being a

1696
01:43:24.451 --> 01:43:28.140
man.
What does gender flux mean?
Good question.
So gender is fluid,

1697
01:43:28.141 --> 01:43:33.090
wasn't condescending at all
genders fluid.
It's,
it's,
uh,
it can,

1698
01:43:33.150 --> 01:43:37.230
it can change throughout the course of the hour.
The 10 head,

1699
01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:41.130
could it be she to start the show and he,
by the end of the show,

1700
01:43:41.131 --> 01:43:44.220
you could be asked for someone to take them on a bright color gender.

1701
01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:47.850
It could be dog and [inaudible] mission,
which I think would be advisable.

1702
01:43:48.030 --> 01:43:51.380
Where you switch genders.
So like your first half,
like she said as an address,

1703
01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:52.940
maybe you can pick the shoes.

1704
01:43:52.941 --> 01:43:55.100
Can they have like the ones that don't hurt your back?

1705
01:43:55.101 --> 01:44:00.080
The one with the less sexy or stiletto one big square one.

1706
01:44:00.410 --> 01:44:04.610
Oh,
right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wedges.
I'm going to a barn raising.
Yeah,
true.
Okay.

1707
01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:08.840
So you're the nonbuyer,
your bill burr,
the non-binary comedians are in right now,

1708
01:44:09.140 --> 01:44:12.470
or your bill burr,
the race comedian,

1709
01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:16.340
where you do kind of what Don Rickles and Lisa Lampanelli we're doing,
you know,

1710
01:44:16.341 --> 01:44:18.330
so it's like,
aw man,

1711
01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:22.160
a Puerto Rican guy in the front and once with the go clean,

1712
01:44:22.161 --> 01:44:23.810
the hotel rooms connect.

1713
01:44:23.811 --> 01:44:28.760
Can I do it as like a Tony Clifton type character or do I have to believe it?

1714
01:44:29.090 --> 01:44:32.270
Well,
you know it's you.
I know.
No,
no,
he gave you,
this is a character.
It's not,

1715
01:44:32.271 --> 01:44:35.720
you're no longer bill burr the race.
I would do the binder.
Everything.
Absolutely.

1716
01:44:35.780 --> 01:44:37.550
Really?
So you can do it all the material you want,

1717
01:44:37.551 --> 01:44:41.060
but your presentation will just be as Hen I absolutely.

1718
01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:45.290
I probably have more female fans by Mike fucking fan bases,
a sausage fest.

1719
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:49.800
You know,
maybe have that prince vibe,
but he's in drudging us.
Yeah,
that's true.

1720
01:44:49.940 --> 01:44:53.070
So you'd go for that too.
Some of my jokes and false settle.
Fuck yeah.

1721
01:44:54.170 --> 01:44:57.440
Here you go.
Learn a couple of languages.
Okay.
He's in.

1722
01:44:58.020 --> 01:45:01.790
I her in a dress and heels and not addressing it would be the fucking,

1723
01:45:01.791 --> 01:45:05.900
most of them.
You can't be like this is because Chris soap soap.
Would you rather,

1724
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:07.910
it would be so brave.
So courageous.

1725
01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:12.530
So woke woke a f,
you know what I mean?

1726
01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:19.130
Coming out.
Okay,
so you're the nonbinary comedian.
Very good.
Good.

1727
01:45:19.190 --> 01:45:23.000
Here's another one in Irvine.
By the way up.
They didn't mention,

1728
01:45:23.001 --> 01:45:27.190
I'm going to be wearing a dress.
Yes,
please.
Okay.
What'd you rather?

1729
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:31.970
Everywhere you go,
you have to run to get there.

1730
01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:35.240
I'm out on that one.
I don't even care what the next one is.

1731
01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:36.980
My back can't take it.

1732
01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:42.040
It's literally like you go to the next room in your house to say exactly like

1733
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:45.230
always running.
Never stretching,
just always running.

1734
01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:48.290
You have to run somebody that someone knocked on your front door.

1735
01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:53.180
You have to run there to run on stay heavy fees,
Rome,
boom,
boom,
boom.

1736
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:58.190
I don't care what this or join isis.
Isis,

1737
01:45:58.540 --> 01:46:00.080
let's get those fucking infidels.

1738
01:46:01.130 --> 01:46:04.280
Or every time you speak you're shouting.

1739
01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:08.850
So you're basically a toddler that you're just your soul volume.
Well,

1740
01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:13.130
it hurt my voice to Doris A.
Little bit.
Of course.
Ah.

1741
01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:17.750
Either of these are going to be fun.
You have to go like the phone.
Hello?
Yeah.

1742
01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:23.150
You always say everything in that range and your standup.

1743
01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:29.720
I find a loophole.
The loophole.
I would just ignore people.

1744
01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:33.150
Oh,
so then I wouldn't have to talk to them when they,

1745
01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:36.410
I just wait till they saved my name 10 times.
Then I'd be like,
why?

1746
01:46:36.650 --> 01:46:41.360
So it makes sense.
It's a loophole because you need,

1747
01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:44.160
you need your health,
you need your health.

1748
01:46:44.161 --> 01:46:46.160
In a way I buy my body would just hurt so much.

1749
01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:51.270
If you love be like bail,
you got to go.
Yeah.
And then she's like,

1750
01:46:51.271 --> 01:46:54.570
do you think you get her daughter to the park?
You're like,
yeah.

1751
01:46:54.571 --> 01:46:58.040
And then your sweet daughter.
But I could explain to go

1752
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.730
in a tone of my voice.
I love you more than life itself.

1753
01:47:04.710 --> 01:47:09.080
You're my best friend.
So

1754
01:47:11.170 --> 01:47:13.110
what's,
you're going to have to do the purchase

1755
01:47:15.450 --> 01:47:18.000
Westboro during the movie?
Yeah.
He could shout it.

1756
01:47:19.010 --> 01:47:22.560
It's one of my favorite actors.
Yeah,
definitely.
I think could do it.

1757
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:29.340
Yep.
I actually would that,
that would be fun.

1758
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:32.100
Why is my wife was into it.
I would just be totally quiet

1759
01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:38.320
and you're having sex.
You're like,
dad,
you bounce off.

1760
01:47:40.770 --> 01:47:45.010
It would wear on her
after awhile.

1761
01:47:45.490 --> 01:47:50.470
I would just stop.
Take a pillow around my mouth.
Right.

1762
01:47:53.890 --> 01:47:57.740
It's still hard.
It's still not sexy.
No,
no brainer.

1763
01:47:58.250 --> 01:48:02.760
Terrible back in my head.
But if you run it everywhere,
you'd be in great shape.

1764
01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:06.180
There you go.
And You can maintain your,
your human relationships.
Yeah.

1765
01:48:06.181 --> 01:48:07.050
You wouldn't yell at it,
but it's,

1766
01:48:07.060 --> 01:48:11.330
it's as simple as like you have to go piss in the middle of the night
to

1767
01:48:13.100 --> 01:48:14.100
go,
but I would be miserable.

1768
01:48:14.101 --> 01:48:17.100
I would start yelling at people because your body can't take that.
Yeah,

1769
01:48:17.590 --> 01:48:19.680
that'd be a lot.
But you get used to it.

1770
01:48:19.681 --> 01:48:22.650
What do you mean you'd be getting in fantastic shape?
I would just love to see.

1771
01:48:22.651 --> 01:48:23.820
That's all you need to be in.

1772
01:48:23.821 --> 01:48:27.180
Fantastic shape and you'd run everywhere and you don't get used to it.

1773
01:48:27.181 --> 01:48:31.490
Your body breaks down.
Then he goes into the bank runs,

1774
01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:35.490
so the line,
they're like your next sprint up.
Hey,

1775
01:48:35.790 --> 01:48:39.090
just wanting to make a deposit and they're like,
all right,
chill the fuck out.

1776
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.510
Run up to the TSA line.
I'll be fucking amazed.

1777
01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:44.850
Every time I have to start flying private,

1778
01:48:45.380 --> 01:48:47.730
please split sprinting through the airport.

1779
01:48:50.700 --> 01:48:55.520
So you're going to take shouting?
Uh,
it made me laugh.
So yeah,

1780
01:48:55.521 --> 01:48:58.740
I would take shower.
I told you I just,
I wouldn't talk to people a lot.
Yeah,

1781
01:48:59.710 --> 01:49:01.310
just ignore everyone.
What's your act?

1782
01:49:01.340 --> 01:49:05.690
You're going to have to shout to start writing books and I would live alone.

1783
01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:11.450
He couldn't do the audible version of the book though.
Just to read your people.

1784
01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:15.140
I after awhile I went up to talk to,
but yeah.
Then what?

1785
01:49:15.141 --> 01:49:18.170
If I want those hard ones,
I'm maybe I would choose running

1786
01:49:19.850 --> 01:49:22.160
neat.
Neither what?
I think I kill myself.

1787
01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:27.980
Either one of those would lead me to suicide.
That's the point.
The show.

1788
01:49:28.730 --> 01:49:32.270
Tom,
what would you choose?
Running or yelling?
Yelling.
Look at him.

1789
01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:39.340
He's completely out of shape.
I have not.
I run,
I lift weights.
No,

1790
01:49:39.341 --> 01:49:41.870
you're done.
I swear to you.
I have to do.
I always do.

1791
01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:45.920
You should feel bad about yourself.
Phil.
I've been doing aiming you shaming me?

1792
01:49:45.930 --> 01:49:49.630
I could do it more.
She you all right?
Uh,
yeah.
Husky.

1793
01:49:51.010 --> 01:49:52.300
Husky.
No,

1794
01:49:52.301 --> 01:49:56.470
like in the 70s when they used to have that size husky rescue Jane's.
Yeah.

1795
01:49:57.970 --> 01:50:02.360
You'd be a Husky when you were a boy.
You're a Vicky.
Vicky.
Yeah.

1796
01:50:02.650 --> 01:50:04.480
Thick boy nation.
That's what I'm part of

1797
01:50:07.470 --> 01:50:10.420
the ICC.
Um,
no,

1798
01:50:10.421 --> 01:50:14.650
I would definitely not take running.
I would yell at everybody.

1799
01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:20.260
I would take running,
maybe not pregnant,
but if I were pregnant,

1800
01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:25.180
I just run everywhere we good for you get my,
I hate exercise.
Yeah.

1801
01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:28.450
No,
that was what I'd get it out of the way.
It'd be insane.

1802
01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:32.230
You'd feel a sense of urgency.
They both make you feel unsafe,
but I take,

1803
01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:34.690
I was shouting,
run into yoga class,

1804
01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:39.400
then run out like crazy man.

1805
01:50:41.590 --> 01:50:45.970
But they'd also be crazy if you're like,
I'm ready to die,
you know?
Feeling good.

1806
01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:50.980
All right.
Yeah.
You could hide the having to run everywhere more.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1807
01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:54.940
I bill,
can you come here for a second?
I busy.
Yeah,

1808
01:50:55.720 --> 01:51:00.190
I said come here for a second.
Not in a second.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Go to commercial.
Boom,

1809
01:51:00.191 --> 01:51:01.710
there's your sick.
This might be a sick comp.

1810
01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:06.190
It could be these two people live together.
Dude.
I like it.

1811
01:51:06.980 --> 01:51:08.910
Well,
yeah,

1812
01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:16.450
I'll stop running if we stopped shouting.
We can't.
We played.

1813
01:51:16.451 --> 01:51:20.250
Would you rather so we're stuck in this agreement?
Yeah.
That's the steak.

1814
01:51:21.580 --> 01:51:24.530

1816
01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:35.470

It's global warming.
I don't know if he's going to come.
