66
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.760
No,

people always see me and bomber jackets and stuff.
You know,

67
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.420
they're always like a light sensible jack and life jackets.

that's code for November 24th.

70
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.670
That is a very hard code breakdown.

71
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.130
I don't even know how you solve that at the house of Brews in San Diego.

72
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.710
Man.
Diego,
California.
Excuse me.
What I miss.
Pronounce it.

73
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.100
It's a hard l.
That's how you pronounce that.
Yeah,
go ahead.

74
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.250
Then 12 seven that's December 7th and fill her up.

75
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.093

Dork titties the 10 30 now this is guys,
this is way out in December.

78
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:55.120

I know you're thinking so far.
No,

79
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.070
Girls and boys cause this shit selling out.
And I will be

80
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.730
<v 3>announcing 2019 dates very shortly.
We're putting together a tour,</v>

81
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.560
but as you know,
it's hard for us to tour between the genes and I,
his schedule,

82
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.650
my schedule.
I've got two little ones that I give a shit about.

83
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.270
You know what I'm saying?
I gotta stay here a lot,

84
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.200
so I'm only doing select cities,
select dates I'm in,
I'm out.

85
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:19.550
It's very quick so I can get back to my family.
We have a very limited amount.

86
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:24.320
We can actually leave a course.
So if you want to see us,
I mean don't,

87
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.100
don't sit on your hands and fart because you can fight on your hands,
not,

88
00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:31.170
but not so much or otherwise.
You're gonna miss the genes.
Train.
Okay.

89
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.180
You're ready to open this show?
Heck yeah.
Let's have some fun.
We go.

90
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.390
We have a lot of things to talk about.

91
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.370
I like to talk about how disappointed I am in you for not being a ride or die

92
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.520
wife.
Let's get going.
Here we go guys.
Let's get into the show.

93
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.760
<v 1>I had an interesting,
Oh yes.</v>

94
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.800
My internal emotional life reflects terrain on the planet,

95
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:57.860
how the planet has a Sahara desert and not have a Sahara desert within me.

96
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.940
That place where my fear and isolation resides.

97
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.973
<v 3>Okay.</v>

98
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.573
<v 1>No,</v>

99
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.490
<v 3>look,
I'm not saying Jada Pinkett Smith is crazy or anything,
but,</v>

100
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.870
but I think that guys that got it a little more together.

101
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:29.160
Can I tell you how I actually feel very honored that you chose this as the

102
00:07:29.161 --> 00:07:34.140
opening clip?
I,
as you know,
I love Instagram.

103
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.860
I'm fascinated.
I think it's a reflection of you know,

104
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.500
it's what you want people to know about you.

105
00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:45.660
It's an interesting psychological experiment.
Interesting.
And once,

106
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.920
I want you to keep saying this because once you hear this assessment,

107
00:07:49.921 --> 00:07:53.670
which I think you're dead on about,
yeah,
it'll make you look at it differently,

108
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:58.850
which is that with Instagram it's your choice of how to visually present who you

109
00:08:00.931 --> 00:08:03.390
are.
Well,
it's what you think you are.

110
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.530
It is what you want other people to know about you.
For instance,
for Mine,

111
00:08:07.531 --> 00:08:09.060
you know,
I like to do my shows,

112
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:16.680
this podcast and you know,
silly things,
but,
uh,
for instance,
I know this guy,

113
00:08:16.681 --> 00:08:19.650
this,
this gay couple,
they're very reserved in real life.

114
00:08:19.651 --> 00:08:22.320
Like twice on Instagram.

115
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.060
It's digs out practically there,
the two of them in each other's laps and like,

116
00:08:27.061 --> 00:08:30.960
it's all overtly sexual.
And I'm like,
you guys are not these people in real life.

117
00:08:30.961 --> 00:08:33.300
That is a peak into the psyche.
That's right.

118
00:08:33.301 --> 00:08:37.500
That's what they want to be perceived as being perceived as or projecting.
Yes.

119
00:08:37.501 --> 00:08:42.030
I am a sexually violent cock monster.
Come fuck me.

120
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:47.080
And it's so fascinating.
So
I love duck tape.
I,

121
00:08:47.081 --> 00:08:51.960
um,
I stumbled upon Jada Pinkett Smith who we've had on the show and clip form,

122
00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:56.110
um,
years ago,
years ago,
and got this news.

123
00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:01.030
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
She's so fucking crazy.
So she's got a new show now,
um,</v>

124
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:06.080
where she talks about her feelings a lot and her Instagram has been fascinating.

125
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.593
Daily.

126
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.460
I mean it's a lot of overshare and there was a time also we should point out

127
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:14.100
that we,
uh,
we played some of the,

128
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:19.140
I guess it was more his written stuff for her kid.
Um,
uh,
Jaden,

129
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.000
Jaden Smith.
And sometimes it felt weird.
Uh,

130
00:09:23.001 --> 00:09:27.180
I know it felt weird because you're like,
oh,
he's a minor.
Right.
But he was also,

131
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:32.150
it's weird because he's a minor,
but he's a huge celebrity.
Yeah.
And,
um,

132
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.990
but he was,
he was,
he was writing hilarious and,

133
00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:40.920
or terrifying things,
you know,
just things like,

134
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.840
you know,
how do we mirrors,
don't have eyes or,
you know,
just all kinds of shit.

135
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.400
Yeah.
He was like,
you know,

136
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.780
really listen to the trees will tell you this full story,
just bonkers stuff.

137
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:55.440
And you know,
you didn't know whether it,
he's busy winking at you.
Was he joking?

138
00:09:55.441 --> 00:09:58.110
Is he playing indoors?
He's serious.
Cause I always felt like he was serious.

139
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.220
So we were like,
what the fuck is going on?
But then you're like,
oh,
it's,

140
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.080
it's teenage kid.
And you know,

141
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.610
it must be weird to be that famous at that age.
But then,
you know,

142
00:10:08.611 --> 00:10:12.840
and then it just kind of like,
he kind of fell out of the psych guys like that.

143
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.950
Did he know?
I don't know.
But then upon further examination,

144
00:10:16.951 --> 00:10:21.000
I think of what you're saying is watching mommy then a lot of things you go like

145
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.700
crazy.
Apple doesn't fall far from the mentally ill trust.

146
00:10:25.701 --> 00:10:29.940
You should look at like,
I mean I don't know if I can,
uh,

147
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:35.430
I love this shit.
I love when people do this on social media.

148
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.090
This is why this is what I live for on Instagram.
Do you know what I'm saying?

149
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:39.330
It's,

150
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:43.380
I like the tract of pictures of people actually like pictures back and when he

151
00:10:43.381 --> 00:10:47.980
was getting,
oh boy.
Oh boy.
Could you read that for,

152
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.750
well this one's not so bad.
I mean,
this one I think you shouldn't share this on,

153
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:52.770
so come on,
let me read it for you.

154
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.850
If I had a nickel for every time that I've cried in the back of an Uber,

155
00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.580
I would have another pair of Yeezys.
That's just funny.
That's fun.

156
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.800
That's not really like,
I think that one is funny.

157
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:06.780
I think he's saying I'm emotional,
but I'm,
but he made it pretty funny.

158
00:11:06.781 --> 00:11:10.350
Like it's saying I would have so many,
I would,
okay.
I would have another car.

159
00:11:10.351 --> 00:11:13.140
I mean,
I mean,
I would have another pair of these expensive shoes.
I mean,
yeah,

160
00:11:13.141 --> 00:11:14.130
he's saying I'm emotional,

161
00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:17.360
but that's not the level at where I'm saying where it was like,

162
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:22.350
like this is one here.
This was one where I was like,
how can,

163
00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:27.990
oh,
sorry.
How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real?
Then you go like,

164
00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:30.600
wait,
what?
That's some philosophy right there.

165
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.980
The moment when you're wearing a dress with no pants and you swerve weight.

166
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:38.880
I mean,
that's,
I guess kind of silly.
He,
um,
I built pyramids constantly.

167
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.540
That was from,
uh,
nine,
nine 14.

168
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:47.460
That's code for September 19th,
2014.
If I was Moises,

169
00:11:47.461 --> 00:11:50.730
where would I be?
Yeah.
I Dunno.
Am I god

170
00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.100
ever read?
Uh,
you know,

171
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:54.993
<v 4>it's,
um,</v>

172
00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.620
<v 3>it was just odd,
right?
It's just odd to see a kid,</v>

173
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.140
<v 4>um,
you know,</v>

174
00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:05.490
<v 3>tweeting this stuff.
It just seemed like it made,
it,
made it,</v>

175
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.790
it made it seem like he was unstable.
You know that that's,

176
00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.600
that was the kind of the perception,
and maybe that was the wrong,

177
00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:15.810
if newborn babies could speak,

178
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:20.040
they would be the most intelligent beings on planet earth.

179
00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:24.540
<v 4>No,
they wouldn't.
No,
they wouldn't come around one we often,</v>

180
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:29.800
<v 3>yeah.
The,
all they talk about is burping,
farting,
shitting,
eating,
sleeping.</v>

181
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.100
That's all we know
anyways.
Yeah.

182
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:38.030
So I get the impression that he was like kind of,
you know,

183
00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:42.400
cooking for himself and Kooky.
Yeah,
yeah.
Anyway.
Well,
well,
no,
hold on.
Okay,

184
00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:45.990
the let's go,
let's go deeper down this rabbit hole.
So one wonders,
well,

185
00:12:45.991 --> 00:12:50.210
why does that kid feel like they should be oversharing and well,

186
00:12:50.211 --> 00:12:54.710
because I remember hearing Jadah one time on interview,
she goes,
you know,

187
00:12:55.070 --> 00:13:00.070
there is so much talent in our house that we cannot hold it back.

188
00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:07.130
I children are so talented.
And I was like,
wow.

189
00:13:07.131 --> 00:13:10.820
And I don't talking.
This is when Janan and willow were like 1211,

190
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.550
10 years old and I,
hey listen,

191
00:13:13.551 --> 00:13:17.420
every parent thinks their child is a genius and is amazing and they should.
Yeah.

192
00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.160
That's kind of sweet.
But like,

193
00:13:19.161 --> 00:13:24.161
you don't really share that sentiment unlike a talk show.

194
00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.270
And you know what I mean?
It's,
it's a,
it's a lot.

195
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.950
It's a lot of pressure for the kids.
Yeah.
It is a lot of pressure for the kid.

196
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:33.140
Probably the worst part of genius.
Yeah.
Oh,
and you gotta be a book.
Thank God.

197
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:38.830
Thank God our parents never a no.
Raised our egos to genius,
Huh.
Um,

198
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.741
interesting.

199
00:13:39.741 --> 00:13:44.741
Realization that my internal emotional life reflects terrain on the planet.

200
00:13:45.711 --> 00:13:49.730
How the planet has a Sahara desert within me.

201
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:53.870
That place where I have to fear and isolation resides.

202
00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:57.020
She looks great.
She looks fantastic.

203
00:13:57.021 --> 00:14:02.021
Lawless planet has an aunt Artica I have an aunt article with in me where I have

204
00:14:03.351 --> 00:14:08.351
hurts that run so deep that my compassion and my understanding and my love is,

205
00:14:09.531 --> 00:14:13.520
is frozen over.
I mean,
okay.
If a Toledo inside of you

206
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:19.340
full of many malls understand theaters,
the uh,
what,

207
00:14:19.341 --> 00:14:24.260
what she's trying to say here.
Sure.
I do too.
You know,
but it's not,
sorry.
Well,

208
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:28.160
it's here.
Hold on.
It's not that,
I don't think you should share this on,

209
00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.240
I just think that this,

210
00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.840
this is reserved for you and someone else smoking a Doobie.
No,
your therapy,

211
00:14:32.841 --> 00:14:37.130
your friend.
Yeah.
Therapist.
Yeah.
You go like Antartica inside of me.

212
00:14:37.131 --> 00:14:38.180
And then your third was just like,

213
00:14:38.181 --> 00:14:42.410
that's a very interesting way of presenting that.
Correct?
Yeah.
Yeah.

214
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.960
That's private.
And then public versus private wars.
You know,

215
00:14:44.961 --> 00:14:47.410
you really don't actually have an Antarctica inside of you.

216
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.440
And then I have those Hawaii's within me that right.

217
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:59.590
Lush and green and full of waterfalls where I can be more sensual and receptive

218
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.960
and giving a lot to be around.

219
00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.490
Could you imagine being married to that?

220
00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:12.320
<v 4>To this?
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

221
00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:20.870
I bet.
I bet there's a lot of interactions like this.

222
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:24.750
This isn't the first time she said this speech.
No,
this is like,

223
00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:29.640
we'll right now at articles feeling especially cold.

224
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.650
And he's like,
all right.
He's like,

225
00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.980
I know I gotta get on a,

226
00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:40.110
I'd like to get on an excursion boat and see what's going on there.

227
00:15:40.111 --> 00:15:43.800
And she was like,
well,
you better because it's about to be the whole house.

228
00:15:43.801 --> 00:15:47.280
About to be at Arnica.
If you don't come over here and defrost this motherfucker.

229
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.930
He's like,
okay.

230
00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:54.050
And then also you imagine how you know he's such a superstar and it's,

231
00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.290
it's gotta be an issue all the time.
No time for this nonsense.
No,
I know,

232
00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:01.500
but I'm saying that that is an issue.
You know,
she's going to be like,

233
00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:05.100
oh we know Mr Stars here.
Okay.

234
00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.800
<v 3>There's a lot of,
I think there's,
I think there's a lot of,</v>

235
00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.990
there's other stars in this house just so you know,

236
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.450
they have like a star rivalry,

237
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:18.150
<v 4>probably not pushing back on it cause he knows his place in the world that he's</v>

238
00:16:19.391 --> 00:16:23.890
an international mega star.
And I think it probably,

239
00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:25.570
I think it annoys her.
That's my,

240
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.160
<v 3>well you think she needs the limelight too?</v>

241
00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:32.710
I think she said there's a lot of light that needs to shine and we all feel how

242
00:16:32.711 --> 00:16:36.200
big your lights shine and I need to shine too.
Wow.

243
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:40.130
<v 4>Try like,
all right.
Like fuck.
All right.
Is Your,
uh,</v>

244
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.780
is your internal Tahiti ready to shine?

245
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:50.590
<v 3>Yes,
exactly.
We'll exactly to,
he's ready to go.
All right.
All right.</v>

246
00:16:50.591 --> 00:16:51.490
That's what I picture.

247
00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:56.680
I can't have these kinds of conversations with will.

248
00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.990
He's just not as deep as I am now.

249
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:05.410
My trainer,
Julio loves to talk about these things.

250
00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.010
That's what I'm saying.
Like I think especially when we stretch,

251
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.990
there's some reason the emotions tied to stretch.
It

252
00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:18.870
really helped me.
Julio condensed,
right?

253
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.880
Like she's got all kinds of dudes or pocket that she talks us nonsense with that

254
00:17:24.971 --> 00:17:27.600
like,
you know,
she thinks that they're her friends and she's got,

255
00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:30.520
she's got a group of nut bags that she talks about that there's no way will

256
00:17:30.521 --> 00:17:31.880
Smith's listening.
No.

257
00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:32.551
<v 4>Here's the thing.</v>

258
00:17:32.551 --> 00:17:36.520
If we know we do such this thing with celebrities where we go like,
yeah,

259
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.010
I guess so you know you kind of like,

260
00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:43.710
but like if you were regular neighbor friend,
the lady that you go on,

261
00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:44.221
I don't know,

262
00:17:44.221 --> 00:17:48.120
walks around the neighborhood with or you meet for coffee started saying this,

263
00:17:48.121 --> 00:17:49.800
you'd be like,
you'd really need to get some help.

264
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.250
<v 0>Like you tolerated only because they're famous.</v>

265
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.940
That is so fucking true,
Tommy.

266
00:17:56.941 --> 00:18:01.530
Like that's the observation of the century on this is that if she were Kathy

267
00:18:01.531 --> 00:18:04.500
next door,
he'd be like caddies off her fucking rock.
Whoa.

268
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.610
Somebody called the pet team,
get this chick.
Fuck Kathy's husband.

269
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.500
What's your fucking wife said to me today?

270
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.250
She said the Antarctica and he'd be like,
Oh shit.

271
00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:18.870
She's been going through a lot of stuff to be fucking committed.

272
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:20.250
That's so true.

273
00:18:20.251 --> 00:18:24.360
And the reason and the reason I'm like kind of considering like listening to her

274
00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:29.090
is because she's famous.
She's famous.
She's pretty beautiful.
Okay.
All right.

275
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.220
I'm just like,
I'm trying to follow,
she's got it.

276
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.750
She's got to have insight because the thing is I actually really like her and

277
00:18:36.751 --> 00:18:40.130
that's why I follow her on Instagram because I'm very curious like what?
What is,

278
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.840
what is she about?
You know there is this thing that you,

279
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:46.770
I think you pick up on too.
Especially like also having,

280
00:18:46.771 --> 00:18:51.090
when I did a movie,
you realize that you're like,
there's,

281
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:56.190
there's the person you do the scene with.
Boy,
girl,
girl,
boy,
girl,
boy,

282
00:18:56.191 --> 00:18:59.940
girl scene though saying that,
that when the camera's rolling,

283
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:04.970
they're able to do this thing and that is only one aspect of that person.

284
00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.380
We always try to like go like this.
You go like this person's amazing.
Well,

285
00:19:10.381 --> 00:19:12.210
they're amazing at that.
Sure.

286
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:17.600
But that doesn't mean that everything else they do is valid or of value,

287
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.890
you know?
Yeah.
Because she could be,
yes.
If you could find an amazing actress,

288
00:19:22.891 --> 00:19:26.940
which is a skill and it should be admired and celebrate it by our Burt Reynolds,

289
00:19:26.941 --> 00:19:29.280
let's say he was pretty entertaining and some films,

290
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.650
it turns out he's beating the shit out of Lonnie Anderson.

291
00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:33.720
He was a real asshole in real life.

292
00:19:33.721 --> 00:19:38.700
You don't know what the fuck that guy was like,
right?
Yeah.
So case in point,

293
00:19:38.701 --> 00:19:41.250
it doesn't mean that if they can play smart on TV,

294
00:19:41.251 --> 00:19:44.280
that they're smart and real life.
Of course,
of course.

295
00:19:44.281 --> 00:19:48.330
We just give her a lot more leeway on this stuff and she's pretty.
But man,

296
00:19:48.331 --> 00:19:50.880
if you guys want to get some prime entertainment,

297
00:19:50.881 --> 00:19:55.320
you want to look inside that the window of Jada Pinkett Smith Psyche go to her

298
00:19:55.321 --> 00:19:59.400
Instagram page.
Uh,
I mean she is really deep.

299
00:19:59.401 --> 00:20:03.240
This chick's got a lot of fucking thoughts on stuff,
man.
It's pretty interesting.

300
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:07.020
Yeah,
I mean it's a,
by the way,

301
00:20:07.021 --> 00:20:11.280
I wasn't saying that thing to like talk shit about somebody in the movie.

302
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:15.150
I'm just making the point that you realize there's a separation.

303
00:20:15.151 --> 00:20:19.740
There's camera rolling and then resource and then the per sure.
Well sure.

304
00:20:19.741 --> 00:20:23.600
I mean I think that can be said for everybody whose lives you go to work and

305
00:20:23.601 --> 00:20:27.720
you're a different person come home and we see it big time in our line of work,

306
00:20:27.721 --> 00:20:32.520
especially in the comedians are Jekyll and Hyde man.
That's who you see on stage.

307
00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:34.440
Some people,
it's really dramatic.

308
00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.220
It's terrifying with some people.

309
00:20:38.221 --> 00:20:42.180
And I mean over the years been doing this 16 years now,
you know,

310
00:20:42.181 --> 00:20:45.960
I've seen people on stage,
so you're like,
wow,
that's really something

311
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:53.860
fun,
funny person.
You go backstage and you hang out with that person.
You're like,

312
00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:57.010
oh,
darkness.
Darkness.

313
00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:02.460
Can Be odd,
like shit like this for sure.
Shit like this.

314
00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:07.990
There's a handful right now that are this.
Yeah,
there's weird,

315
00:21:07.991 --> 00:21:12.720
there's a lot of mental illness.
It goes on a dress,
you know,

316
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:17.710
very quiet.
I'm introverted,
but like to the point where it's,

317
00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:19.420
it's,
uh,

318
00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:25.170
almost to turning you to curiosity about what this,

319
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.720
not just all these quiet,
you know,
it's like,
it's too much.

320
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:33.790
I would say you and I are actually introverts.
Definitely.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

321
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.740
And then there's,
you know,
there's drunk fat people.
There's always deeply racist,

322
00:21:38.741 --> 00:21:41.300
deeply raises people.
You don't know it onstage,

323
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:42.490
and then you hang out and you're like,

324
00:21:42.491 --> 00:21:45.670
why didn't know you're this fat and racist?
It's just that you just don't know.

325
00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:49.990
I'm saying it's just,
it's just,
uh,
yeah.
And of course there's,

326
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:54.700
there's the really extreme fucked up cases too,
where they're like,

327
00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.440
don't say
no.

328
00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.670
Don't say naughty works.
I'm a rape.
You do.
Yeah.

329
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.350
That was the wackiest one of the malls.
I think.
So.
Let's see what else.

330
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.290
<v 1>I want to be more of those things,</v>

331
00:22:08.291 --> 00:22:11.420
but we also have to embrace our internal and articles.

332
00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:14.170
And so Harvard deserts and we can't see him as wrong.

333
00:22:14.171 --> 00:22:17.590
Just like we don't see the Sahara desert has wrong on the planet.

334
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:22.660
It is just what is and we can love ourselves in those places.
It's

335
00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.370
<v 0>now,
see I actually,
I understand what you're saying.</v>

336
00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:32.060
I understand what she's saying.
I get it and I get it on an emotional,
I just,

337
00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:36.050
I get it too.
I mean I get embarrassed.
Nothing wrong with the,

338
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:40.070
you said like with the desert or that part of you.
It makes sense.

339
00:22:40.071 --> 00:22:41.840
I mean it's fine.
I just imagined like,

340
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.980
like we were saying like the personal relationship between the husband and wife.

341
00:22:45.981 --> 00:22:49.530
Like you haven't been to hear this shit fucking 24,
seven.
I'd be like,
God dammit.

342
00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:54.020
There she goes again with this nonsense talk.
Um,
go see a therapist.

343
00:22:54.021 --> 00:22:55.250
Go see five,
right?

344
00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:02.760
Let's say Asia Guy.
No,
that's the parachute or no,

345
00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:05.660
that's the Brazilian guy I said presented was electrocuted.

346
00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:10.460
Remember everybody laughs,
got an email about it.
You want to see?

347
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:14.660
Sure.
The guy being electrocuted by grapes as a classic Brazilian meme.

348
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.650
Glad you guys are delving into this because Brazil has host a hundreds of

349
00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:20.720
thousands of hours of absurdist content.
Cool.

350
00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.030
The video was super big here when youtube started.

351
00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.240
The dude electrocuted is a conservative TV host from south Brazil.

352
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:30.740
His name is Laci or Martine's.
Not only did he not die from the grapes,

353
00:23:30.741 --> 00:23:35.630
he somehow became a senator later on because this is Brazil left,
right.
Helps.
It.

354
00:23:35.631 --> 00:23:40.220
Helps it.
God,
I'll do the bone bang.

355
00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.190
I still listened to my Brazilian jams,

356
00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:48.550
<v 4>Sergio Mendez.
Before I forget,</v>

357
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.350
I want to talk about how highly disappointed I am in you and thinking about

358
00:23:51.351 --> 00:23:56.000
moving on.
So the other day we were in bed,
not the other day.

359
00:23:56.001 --> 00:24:00.280
Last night we're watching Ozark,
which I love.
So good.
The season too.

360
00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:03.860
So good.
Mr Bateman and cast.
Oh,

361
00:24:03.861 --> 00:24:06.500
Charles Wilkes reached out to me on Twitter.
That's amazing.

362
00:24:06.501 --> 00:24:08.980
About the beautiful boat that he drove a,

363
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:13.760
tweeted that out and he found me and told me it's a hacker craft.
Uh,
600 grand.

364
00:24:13.761 --> 00:24:15.680
I was like,
I'm gonna get to,
I didn't realize it was so cheap.

365
00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:19.370
It's so need college.
Um,
anyways,
uh,

366
00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:23.510
we were talking about the whole family kind of has to watch out for each other,

367
00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:24.440
have each other's back.

368
00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:29.970
<v 3>And you told me and you in no uncertain terms that you would report me to the</v>

369
00:24:33.851 --> 00:24:38.580
authorities.
Yeah.
If I were to murder

370
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.800
<v 4>one and it was premeditated.
Yeah.</v>

371
00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:45.460
I was so stunned by this declaration.

372
00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:49.180
I just realized I thought I'd had a ride or die.
Yeah.

373
00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:52.820
And I thought I was with my wife for life.
Yeah.

374
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:57.870
And now I am actively searching for number two because the fact that you would

375
00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.150
even hypothetically

376
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:05.090
<v 3>turn me in,
it really,
it changed my whole voice.
I'm going to turn yet.</v>

377
00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:10.120
Here's the distinction that's very important.
Now what I turn in for,
uh,

378
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:14.610
involuntary manslaughter.
No.
Or even a lesser charge,

379
00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:19.090
but lying in,
wait,
first degree murder.
You're,

380
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:22.500
you're a fucking nut bag and I got attorney in manatee cause you're going to

381
00:25:22.501 --> 00:25:25.550
fucking kill me in the kids next.
I got to protect our children.

382
00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.270
I'm not doing that.

383
00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:30.510
I don't understand why you tie the two together because you're going to get a

384
00:25:30.511 --> 00:25:34.620
taste for it.
That's what happens.
And I know this for it.
For Kellen.
No,

385
00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:37.560
you're already developing the thirst.
You're watching all these shows,

386
00:25:37.561 --> 00:25:39.180
getting your skills together,

387
00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:42.900
and then you're going to kill [inaudible] skills together.
Yeah,

388
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.910
I'm murdering somebody who did something wrong.
I'm not just mercy.

389
00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.960
Now you're ready.
You're contemplating a mark.

390
00:25:48.961 --> 00:25:51.180
You're already thinking who you're going to kill.
Yeah,

391
00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:56.130
but I'm saying it's not for no reason.
It's not just blood lust.
Well,

392
00:25:56.131 --> 00:25:57.270
what's the reason,
Tom?

393
00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:01.860
The reason is that somebody slided me and now I'm going to kill him.
See,

394
00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:07.050
and you think I should defend this?
Oh,
of course you're my wife.
No,

395
00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.870
because it was going to happen is one day I'm going to slight.
Yeah,

396
00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:11.640
and then you're going to murder me.

397
00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.700
You're going to kill our children and our dogs alone,

398
00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:19.380
and you're going to have no support system.
Great.
I'd rather be alone.

399
00:26:19.381 --> 00:26:24.210
Have you put behind bars?
Why favor?
How can you not support?
I told you,

400
00:26:24.211 --> 00:26:26.070
if you hit somebody with a car,
guess what?

401
00:26:26.071 --> 00:26:29.340
I'm the first one to be out there and hiding the body with you.
You know that,

402
00:26:29.341 --> 00:26:31.140
right?
That's the kind of love I have for you.

403
00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:35.340
It's supposed to extend beyond that.
You hit a bicyclist or something dead.

404
00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.230
They're dead on the road.
I'm going to come out there with you.

405
00:26:37.231 --> 00:26:39.120
I'm going to find somewhere to bury this guy.
Yeah,

406
00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:41.220
we're going to find somewhere to burn his body.
No.

407
00:26:41.221 --> 00:26:43.560
What we've learned is that you have to dig hole.

408
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
You have to get hydrochloric acid for it on the body and then cover it up,

409
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.080
but I still,
well,
you don't have my back.
Why don't you have my back?

410
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:56.190
I just told you if it's,
if it's manslaughter,
involuntary manslaughter.

411
00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:00.830
Not First degree.
I can't.
I can't.
I can't support you first.

412
00:27:00.831 --> 00:27:05.400
Hickory lying in wakes me over and I'm like,
all right,
it's time for payback.

413
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:09.480
Why can't you?
It's so disappointing that you don't hypothetically have my back.

414
00:27:09.481 --> 00:27:13.440
I'm serious.
Like I've never been.
I'm so disappointed.
Okay.

415
00:27:13.441 --> 00:27:16.680
What's considered a slight in your world?
Let's talk about that because maybe,

416
00:27:16.681 --> 00:27:19.140
maybe I can get on board if it's a legit,

417
00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:23.070
like I'm just giving you somebody fuck me over.
Okay,
here's,

418
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.670
here's when I think it's okay.
Here's what somebody fucks with our kids,

419
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.590
like seriously fucks up with our kids or hurts them.
Yeah,
absolutely.

420
00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.680
Let's go kill the mother fucker.
That's,
that's different.

421
00:27:34.681 --> 00:27:38.580
That's probably the only scenario.
Or they try to fucking hurt you.

422
00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:43.670
Like physically tried to kill us and you kill them first or physically harming

423
00:27:44.071 --> 00:27:47.310
my children or me,
then that's different.

424
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.240
But I'm talking about some guy cuts you off in traffic and you're applying it

425
00:27:50.241 --> 00:27:52.380
and cause that,
that's what it sounds like to me is where you're headed.

426
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:54.840
Somebody cuts you off in traffic.
Somebody,

427
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:58.740
your Starbucks doesn't come out so hot enough and you're planning the Baristas

428
00:27:58.741 --> 00:28:01.680
death.
That's what I'm hearing.
Okay.
I mean,
first of all,

429
00:28:01.681 --> 00:28:04.350
I think both of those are reasonable.
That's what I,
that's the problem.

430
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:06.760
But see that's the problem here.
Okay.

431
00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:11.250
You're supposed to have your spouse's back not on that.
Yes you are.

432
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:15.420
That's what I'm saying.
No,
yes.
No,
I cannot ride or die.

433
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.460
You're not and it's disappointing.
That's,
that's Cray cray tongue.

434
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:23.490
You're telling me that if you murder a Barista cause you're ordered didn't come

435
00:28:23.491 --> 00:28:27.300
out right.
I'm supposed to stand by you.
Yes,
of course I'm standby.
Or Man,

436
00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.150
of course.
I mean,
you could tell me that you're like,

437
00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:34.100
you can lecture me know and tell me like how fucked up it was that I did that

438
00:28:34.101 --> 00:28:38.070
and I got to stop killing Baristas.
You still don't turn me in.

439
00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.180
Of course I turn you in.

440
00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:44.220
Your Real Kenyan if you're now it all makes sense if you're the unibomber I'm

441
00:28:44.221 --> 00:28:47.850
turning in.
That's different.
How's that different?
Because that's killing people.

442
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.670
That's terrorizing people that didn't do anything to you get,

443
00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:55.150
but in his mind they were doing stuff to him.
No,
it was symbolic to him.
Okay.

444
00:28:55.500 --> 00:29:00.390
Well I like how you know the inside of his mind so well,
I mean,
I studied it.

445
00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:04.080
Have a little bit about it.
Okay,
well look,
you're already on the brink.

446
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.870
I'm saying like somebody scratches my car in a parking lot,
right?

447
00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:13.170
Then I go and stick an icepick says neck.
Sure,
I can't,

448
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.580
I can't abide the eye.
Yeah,
so now guess what?
Now I'm not telling you stuff.

449
00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.820
Oh,
now we don't have a communication and the relationship anymore.

450
00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:22.980
It's definitely going down.
It's not going up.

451
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:26.280
It's not going to improve because you're a fucking tattle tale.

452
00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:33.870
I would report you so fucking fast,
so fast.

453
00:29:33.871 --> 00:29:37.230
If you're doing crazy stuff like that.
Oh,
you're out.
You're in jail partner.

454
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.000
You're going to turn on me and the kids.

455
00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:42.220
I want to protect my young and turning it into,
it's not boo

456
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:46.060
<v 0>boo boo boo because that's where it goes.
It doesn't go there.
Okay.</v>

457
00:29:46.061 --> 00:29:46.900
Let me ask you this.

458
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.110
How many killers have good relationships with wives and children?

459
00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:56.510
Healthy marriages.
Healthy relationships.
Their children?
Yes.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.

460
00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:02.520
Ted Bundy had a nice wife and children at home that he cared about real p o s

461
00:30:02.831 --> 00:30:07.270
for this.
Yeah.
You're a big disappointment.
Not just to me,
to the entire fan base.

462
00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.640
I promise you're going to listen.

463
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:14.040
They always side with you on a nonsense like this nonsense.
This is,

464
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:19.000
but you don't have the,
to any woman that's got children knows to protect them.

465
00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:20.440
I would protect my children from you.

466
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.750
The fact that you keep twisting the two twist.
Yeah.
You're like,
oh,

467
00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:28.570
we got to protect my kids.
Like that has anything to do with the fucking Barista.

468
00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:32.980
You're Outta here.
Gone.
If you,
if you,
if you were violent like that,

469
00:30:32.981 --> 00:30:36.190
gone Tom,
you're gone.
What's a deal breaker for you

470
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.700
like in those bitch tits?
Uh,
says,
uh,
Bi needs help finding this man.

471
00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:46.180
John Doe 40 spotted in a child porn video.

472
00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:50.710
Oh my God.
I hope it's not Bert.
He's got to go.
It doesn't have a beard.

473
00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:54.190
Half eyebrows.
Well,
that's what Burt looks like without a beard.
That's true.

474
00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:55.623
What has bird,

475
00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:01.720
she's other deal breakers.
Well,
what about,
what about me?

476
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.770
Would you turn me in if I killed the Barista?
No,
of course not.

477
00:31:05.771 --> 00:31:07.450
That's the difference.
I'm not a piece of shit.

478
00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:12.780
I'm not going to report my children's mother and my spouse and have her go to

479
00:31:12.941 --> 00:31:17.270
prison.
They should be locked up if I'm doing crazy stuff.
Like,
no,

480
00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:20.800
you should never thought about that towel.
I just tell I pull you aside and I go,

481
00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:24.580
the fuck are you doing?
You gotta stop killing people.
God.

482
00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:27.490
Uh,
and then you go,
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

483
00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:31.980
And I guarantee if I called your father and was like,
ah,
dude,
Tom and a Barista,

484
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.330
because hundred percent he would not turn me in.

485
00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:39.490
Hundred Years ad is a rule follower and you have no idea.

486
00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.930
No idea.
No.
He broke the mold.

487
00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:46.840
He would fly out here and kill you if you said you were going to turn me in.

488
00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.120
I cut.
You don't that.
Can I,
are you serious?

489
00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.130
He would sneak into the house at night.
I'm sorry buddy.

490
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:57.210
I had to slice her throat.
She was going to talk.
All right.

491
00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:01.210
He was like,
it's fun.
Turn on the children and me and I know that because,

492
00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:06.010
okay.
Let me ask you something apart that everyone just so you know is going,
wow.

493
00:32:06.011 --> 00:32:08.230
She's really doesn't get it.
She really doesn't get it.

494
00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:10.320
He's not going to hurt kids.
Listen to me.

495
00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:15.010
When you read about your serial killers,
who's the first person they kill?

496
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:18.060
Who?
The woman who was,
who was it?
Who was the first person they killed?
Oh,

497
00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:23.020
my wife fell down the stairs.
That's not serial killers,
so he's a killer.
Okay.
No,

498
00:32:23.021 --> 00:32:24.040
no,
that's,
that's the,

499
00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.670
you're talking about like crime of passion stuff that's like walking in on you

500
00:32:27.671 --> 00:32:31.730
having an affair.
That's when they kill the wife.
The it's,
it's like it's,

501
00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:36.400
it's not a plotted planned for the most part thing.
It was her passion kills.

502
00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:40.070
Okay.
Okay,
so what's killing the Barista when

503
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.550
<v 4>that your order crime of passion,
that would be right,</v>

504
00:32:43.551 --> 00:32:47.630
but that doesn't mean that I'm going to go home and kill my kids.
So Yana,
Yana.

505
00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:52.660
What that leads me to believe is that your specific brand of sociopathy lends

506
00:32:52.731 --> 00:32:54.920
itself to crimes of passion.
Now,

507
00:32:54.921 --> 00:32:57.140
if you're going to count the Barista over a coffee,

508
00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.010
you're certainly prone to kill your wife.
What if I get your coffee wrong?

509
00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.910
I bring you a cup of coffee without milk.

510
00:33:04.911 --> 00:33:08.840
You're going to slit my throat to whatever.
It's adjacent.

511
00:33:08.841 --> 00:33:09.980
It's psycho adjacent.

512
00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:13.960
We should start figuring out what our next great.

513
00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.770
Now who was my second husband?

514
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:20.990
It's going to be someone who doesn't value loyalty.
Doesn't value they've alone.

515
00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:25.760
Yeah,
and I hope,
I hope there are,
they're gone.

516
00:33:25.761 --> 00:33:29.210
I don't worry.
And tums Ray Times.

517
00:33:29.211 --> 00:33:33.650
It would just what Tom does,
nothing.
I'm helping,

518
00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:38.660
I'm helping our fans left and right with this one.
Uh,

519
00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:43.690
my girlfriend and I were watching the episode of why Mhw with Bobby Lee and Clia

520
00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.950
Khalila sorry,
I forgot how to say her name correctly.
Uh,

521
00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:50.990
I started laughing at Tom's look of disappointment and discussed when Bobby said

522
00:33:50.991 --> 00:33:54.890
he didn't want to get his ass eat.
And my girlfriend turned to me and said,
Hey,

523
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:59.150
do you want me to do that to you?
And I went,
ah,
yeah.

524
00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:04.280
And now she does it regularly and it's so good.

525
00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:08.270
I know in four strokes every time.
So thank you Tom,

526
00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:13.250
for sort of being the catalyst for this new part of my life.
I appreciate it.

527
00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:17.000
Piss on me and beat me.
Try it out from Eric in Norway.

528
00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.240
You're welcome or welcome Eric.

529
00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:24.480
And maybe it's a signal to one other person.
Listen,

530
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.480
Norwegians or they do their own thing.

531
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:30.350
Everybody knows that 20 hours of sunlight a day makes you crazy.

532
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:35.710
Last week I played a prank call from Fort Simpson that was great.

533
00:34:36.651 --> 00:34:39.620
Involving top dog.
This is the one I was holding onto.

534
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:43.040
This is in my estimation,

535
00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:46.850
the greatest prank call that he's dumb.
Okay.
Wow.

536
00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:51.020
This is one that I asked him was,
I asked him,

537
00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:52.970
I asked him,
would you marry your mom?

538
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.860
I asked him if this was possible a few months ago.
And he was like,

539
00:34:57.861 --> 00:35:01.710
well,
you know,
he told me a lot of variables have to come into play,
you know,

540
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.890
to make a prank call work.
Anyways,
he did it.
So it's so great.

541
00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.500
I'm going again,
going to mute our lines.
Okay.
Um,

542
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:12.470
after this we'll come right back,

543
00:35:12.471 --> 00:35:15.920
but I'm going to mute our line so that you can just hear this call
uninterrupted.

544
00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.870
If you're not going to make the sound,
why do you even buy it?

545
00:35:18.871 --> 00:35:23.060
I know it wasn't like a full burp.
Let it go.
You're at your mom's house.

546
00:35:23.061 --> 00:35:27.380
This isn't,
that's true.
All right,
church.
Are you ready,
gene?
Yes.
Okay,
here we go.

547

574
00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:04.410
<v 0>My name is Bert,
uh,
calling on behalf of my client,
John.</v>

575
00:37:04.411 --> 00:37:08.910
I'm a registered caretaker here in Oregon and the woman we just spoke with told

576
00:37:08.911 --> 00:37:13.440
us that you might be the best person to talk to about treating erectile

577
00:37:13.441 --> 00:37:14.200
dysfunction.

578
00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.150
<v 8>Absolutely.
Yeah.</v>

579
00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:19.360
<v 0>I'm going to put John on the phone with me,
if that's all right.</v>

580
00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:24.450
<v 8>Sure.
Okay.
Yes.
Hello?
You were interested in the games wave treatment?</v>

581
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.450
Yes.
Okay.
And how old are you John?

582
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:29.300
<v 0>He's a 78</v>

583
00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:34.670
<v 8>78 okay.
John,
are you on,
are you on any medications currently?
No.</v>

584
00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:39.990
Okay.
And Are you able to achieve an erection?
Yes.

585
00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:41.880
So you're able to achieve an erection,

586
00:37:41.881 --> 00:37:45.840
but it just doesn't last as long as you would like or you lose a Rexall function

587
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:47.700
over time?
Yes.
Okay.

588
00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:51.650
<v 7>I just want you guys to see,
but I don't know if you believe me or not,</v>

589
00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:52.790
but I promise you,

590
00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:54.650
<v 8>I'm sorry you're,

591
00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:59.330
<v 7>I promise you,
if you can find any body you know,
that won't get you into trouble,</v>

592
00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:03.140

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.770
<v 7>And my brother named Billy,
or when he smoked with me,
he put his dick.</v>

597
00:38:14.771 --> 00:38:18.920
I can't believe how big his dick was.
He jacked off in droves.

598
00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.640
<v 8>It's the person who's the caretaker there available.</v>

602
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:34.830
<v 8>is there,
John,

603
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:39.020

You won't believe how good it feels.
Good.

604

606
00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:49.620
<v 8>Um,
I'm sorry this,
this is,
um,</v>

607
00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:54.170
this is not information that is of value to me.
Um,
I am,
I really,

608
00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.620
<v 7>I'm so sensitive that you don't need lube.</v>

609
00:38:57.630 --> 00:39:02.630
You don't need spirit and you shoot an enormous amount of very thick hot white

610
00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:05.253
come.

611
00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.230
<v 8>I'm going to have to end this phone call.</v>

612
00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:11.640
<v 4>Okay.
That's so great.</v>

613
00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.610
My favorite and it was so subtle in the beginning where it goes,

614
00:39:14.611 --> 00:39:17.630
I have no neuropathy.
She goes,
okay.
Okay.

615
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:22.380
So it was perfect.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No problems at all.

616
00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.420
How does he very good,
very good.

617
00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:31.410
No neuropathy problems at all.
Very good.
Uh,

618
00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:34.560
perfect.
That was a perfect perfection.
It was perfection.

619
00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:37.350
The only thing I asked him,
he was like,
hey call,

620
00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:39.970
you want me to try to make it go?
If you could get the forest stroke,

621
00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:45.030
I know a reptile expert.
And he was like,
hmm.
And he told me,
he was like,

622
00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:49.230
you know,
I've been trying to email,
been trying.
It just ha cause I guess you,
you,

623
00:39:49.231 --> 00:39:53.460
you see that like everything has to line up for a call work.
It seems simple.

624
00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:54.400
I Dunno how they use it.

625
00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.360
It's funny because obviously he jumps in where when unnecessary.

626
00:39:57.570 --> 00:40:01.590
It's like when that guy goes like,
how old are you?
He's just like a 78,

627
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:05.160
like,
he just on the spot to think of something.
You know,

628
00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:09.300
I have quite brilliant for him to be the guys caretaker as a smart so he can

629
00:40:09.301 --> 00:40:10.860
jump in on last weeks.
It was a,

630
00:40:10.861 --> 00:40:15.760
he was like my daddy with his truck nuts and all that.
Sure.
Yeah.

631
00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.410
Yeah.
This guy's a genius.
It's great.
And by the way,

632
00:40:19.411 --> 00:40:24.411
you can hear that call and a bunch of other calls.

633
00:40:25.201 --> 00:40:27.690
He has a free album out of his prank calls.
Wow.

634
00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:31.620
It's over two hours of prank calls and there's a bunch of,
uh,

635
00:40:31.621 --> 00:40:36.621
your mom's house when sprinkled in it is Fart simpson.bandcamp.com and it's a,

636
00:40:39.391 --> 00:40:42.510
it's an album of that.
Tony and his friends,
uh,

637
00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:46.870
I have been working on for quite awhile.
Uh,
anyways,

638
00:40:46.871 --> 00:40:51.540
so hello honey.
He's like,
my brother tried it,
get big hat and he's like,
um,

639
00:40:51.541 --> 00:40:53.310
sir.
He's like this info.

640
00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:56.050
<v 8>This is not information that is of value to me.</v>

641
00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:00.270
<v 4>That is a value to me.
So great.
Uh,</v>

642
00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:03.260
no neuropathy rep,
this is it.
Oh

643
00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:08.560
here's my client.
And I liked that.

644
00:41:08.561 --> 00:41:10.840
That guy's like a caretaker there available.

645
00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.090
I don't want to hear about all your com and how hard your brothers Dick is

646
00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:21.340
as the best part.
Oh Man.
By the way,

647
00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:25.870
I got an email from the director of the movie that's coming out.
Um,

648
00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:30.340
instant family.
This is a,
by the way,
just people know,
I mean,
I'm,
you know,

649
00:41:30.341 --> 00:41:33.980
I joke about being a movie star lifestyle.
I'm in good amount of scenes.

650
00:41:33.981 --> 00:41:36.830
Let's say I have like probably seven,
eight scenes in a,
in a,

651
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:39.530
in this major Bush picture is a massive release.

652
00:41:39.531 --> 00:41:43.060
This will be in every movie theater in America and internationally.
It's a,

653
00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.780
you know,
4,000 plus theaters here.
So I'm just saying big,
you know,

654
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:49.760
big paramount release.

655
00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:54.890
The IMD B page about it has trivia mostly about me.

656
00:41:55.530 --> 00:42:00.230
You know,
it's like,
it's that this movie has mark Walberg,
Rose Byrne,

657
00:42:00.231 --> 00:42:03.110
Octavia Spencer,
like legit stars.

658
00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:08.500
And the highest rated piece of Trivia on the page right now is,

659
00:42:08.871 --> 00:42:13.520
uh,
um,
cigarette experience,
no neuropathy issues during filming.

660
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.840
You know,
I think that it's like my favorite color.
You must show the director.

661
00:42:20.841 --> 00:42:25.100
He was like,
Hey,
your fans are pretty hardcore man.
And then it says like,

662
00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:29.480
there's a longer one that says like Thompson Euro,
the water champ.
Um,

663
00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:34.540
like international water champ was making this film just absolute craziness.

664
00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:38.930
He should go back to the deadline posting of our cvs d.
Oh yeah.
I mean,

665
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:42.470
that one's just littered with mommy comments.
It's so funny.
People were like,

666
00:42:42.471 --> 00:42:46.160
what is this?
Why is everyone saying this shows about jeans?

667
00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:49.040
Um,
okay.
Why don't we,
our guest is here.

668
00:42:49.041 --> 00:42:52.220
Why don't we just take a break to go get them and we'll be right back Jean.
Okay.

669
00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:58.060
And we're back with our very special guest comedian Doug Mellard,

670
00:42:58.281 --> 00:43:02.420
who has a new album out.
It's a chart topper.

671
00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:06.650
It's called FARC safari to fart harder.

672
00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:11.390
That's right.
I honestly think that's the best album title I've ever heard.

673
00:43:11.391 --> 00:43:14.240
I love the album title.
What a talent.

674
00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:19.650
<v 9>It took a lot to get there,
you know,
to come up.
Any push back a little bit.</v>

675
00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:22.860
Uh,
originally the producer was like,
I don't,
that's the dumbest.
Yeah,

676
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:23.703
<v 4>I think I've ever heard.</v>

677
00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:27.880
But you're so good at capitalizing on the dumbest thing someone's ever heard,

678
00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:33.310
you know,
from tattoos.
I summered in.
No worries.

679
00:43:33.311 --> 00:43:35.980
Yeah.
Oh,
it's fantastic.

680
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:41.270
<v 9>Oh,
where do you want to start?
Uh,</v>

681
00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:46.850
I think the general consensus for favorite dumb tattoo was a,

682
00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.610
so I dated,
this is on fart safari one by the way.

683
00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:51.800
It's a great [inaudible] this is a bit,
I mean,

684
00:43:51.801 --> 00:43:53.540
the reason I know about it because I heard him say on stage,

685
00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:59.240
don't get it confused with two is the new release.
Yeah.
You don't have to,

686
00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:02.080
you know,
have both to have them connected.
Right.

687
00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:05.390
You'll figure it out double album.
But uh,
but yeah,

688
00:44:05.391 --> 00:44:10.190
so I dated this girl name Allie and uh,
it didn't end well,
like at all.

689
00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:14.240
And so I got iHeart alley on my chest and then,
uh,

690
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:18.980
when that went south I had to get like a really clever cover up,
you know?

691
00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:23.090
So,
uh,
came up with iHeart alligators.

692
00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:29.490
It's pretty amazing.
It's got the little Lacoste alligator.
It's pretty sweet.

693
00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:34.500
Yeah,
no,
I love it.
It's actually maybe my favorite tattoo.
That's pretty,
oh,

694
00:44:34.501 --> 00:44:37.960
and then right here,
that's a,
the movie alien vs Predator.
Uh Huh.

695
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:42.210
I thought the movie was so dumb that I drunkenly got a tattoo of it like later.

696
00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:45.720
It's not even correct.
Like that's supposed to be a line that goes straight down.

697
00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:47.801
<v 0>So that's,</v>

698
00:44:47.801 --> 00:44:52.540
those are two great examples of capitalizing on dumb ideas and making them
funny.

699
00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:53.990
<v 9>Oh yeah.
I got a,</v>

700
00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:59.200
I auditioned for a show and it was called epic fail and I did not get the part,

701
00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:02.420
but they were like,
we're looking for wacky comedians.

702
00:45:02.421 --> 00:45:05.500
And I like people that like,
we'll do anything.
So I was like,
oh,

703
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:06.710
just get a tattoo of the show.

704
00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:11.780
So I got epic fail on my arm and I was like,
worst case.

705
00:45:11.781 --> 00:45:15.860
Uh,
you know,
uh,
it's an even dumber.

706
00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:17.780
It's Funnier I think for sure.

707
00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:23.030
<v 0>And it's so great that you didn't get epic fail after getting epic fail.
Yeah.</v>

708
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:26.270
That's even funnier.
That's better.
How many of these tattoos do you have?

709
00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:31.240
<v 9>Uh,
God,
well,
it's funny,
like I've got an old dirty bastard tattoo,</v>

710
00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:37.060
uh,
that it could be better.
I got accommodate madness,

711
00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:39.940
but this is on parts of I two.
I talk about it.

712
00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:42.100
It's misspelled just to screw with people.

713
00:45:42.101 --> 00:45:45.280
And I thought it'd be real funny because of that.
People would constantly like,

714
00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:49.430
tell me that and then I'd have to look like and be like,
Oh shit what?
And uh,

715
00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:51.453
we're done.
Yeah.

716
00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:55.550
<v 0>It's one of my favorite type of personalities and comics,
which is like,</v>

717
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:59.540
he lives for the moment of making it funny.

718
00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:02.620
So like getting the tattoo just so that,
right.

719
00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:07.730
So that he can play dumb to somebody in life.
Like what?
Fuck,
I got.

720
00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:11.450
Call that guy now,
just for that moment.
That's,
I love that about you.
Yeah.

721
00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:15.710
Here's the artwork here.
It's,
it's everywhere.
It's on Spotify.

722
00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:20.180
Obviously it's on iTunes.
This is,
I just pulled up the,
uh,
Amazon,
uh,
banner.

723
00:46:20.181 --> 00:46:23.510
But um,
yeah,
it's,
it's hilarious.
Doug is hilarious.

724
00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:27.140
It's that the Amazon music farts safari too far.
It harder.
Yeah.

725
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:32.150
Doug Mellard guys definitely download at least some positive reviews for this

726
00:46:32.391 --> 00:46:35.300
man.
Let him know how much you loved his work.
It's great.
How funny.

727
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:40.310
A lot of you saw Doug,
by the way,
with me,
um,
uh,
an a on the last tour.

728
00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:41.640
You came with me to a number of cities,

729
00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:47.570
Seattle together can Portland.
Yup.
Houston.

730
00:46:47.571 --> 00:46:51.440
Dallas.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
so you Tom,

731
00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:54.770
the last time we were all together,
it was it when we were all together.
You,

732
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:59.120
well first of all,
Doug,
congratulations.
You just got married.
Oh,
thanks.
Uh,

733
00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:03.700
I had hold off on that,
but,
and it's like a c minus so far,
you know?
Yeah.

734
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:08.800
The honeymoon.
Yeah.
No,
I'm looking to get remarried to a loyal person soon.

735
00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:12.320
We'll get into it later.
But,
um,
someone who won't just leave,

736
00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:16.580
call the police on their own spouse just because he let the,
uh,

737
00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:19.780
sprinkler run on the wrong day.
So anyway,
um,

738
00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.980
you just got married and uh,
no.
Well,

739
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:27.160
the point being that they came to the home,
they came,
uh,

740
00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:32.110
Doug and his now wife came and we had a lovely time.
We were drinking,

741
00:47:32.111 --> 00:47:37.111
we were laughing and then you farted in front of his lovely fiance.

742
00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:41.010
That's true.
And I was like,
you don't even know this person yet.

743
00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:44.290
You have to have some precedence with them before you fart in front of them.

744
00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:46.500
<v 1>Oh my gosh.
Yeah.</v>

745
00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.760
<v 0>When did you meet her?
Like how long have you known her before?</v>

746
00:47:48.761 --> 00:47:52.730
Before we started actually I hung out with Flint quite a bit because she met,

747
00:47:52.731 --> 00:47:56.300
we met on the,
like I've known Doug for a number of years.

748
00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:00.110
I probably by the second time that we did to get a gig together,

749
00:48:00.111 --> 00:48:03.410
I was hanging out with Flynn.
Then when we did our Texas gigs together,

750
00:48:03.411 --> 00:48:07.200
she's from there.
We hung out with her and her brother.
We crashed a wedding.
Yeah.

751
00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:10.760
There I've hung out with her a good,
I mean,
not like,
oh my God.

752
00:48:10.761 --> 00:48:13.550
Years and years and years,
but enough to know.
Yeah,
and I,

753
00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:19.380
it was pretty loud.
I think part of it,
it was,
yeah,
it was nasty,
but

754
00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:24.740
like here's the deal.
It's like I'm used to him,
but he's right.

755
00:48:24.741 --> 00:48:29.090
He also knows me and I think that's why he's like,
I can,
she lives with this guy.

756
00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:32.760
Sure.
So it's fine because he knows that I do that in front of her.

757
00:48:32.761 --> 00:48:35.930
I know now off the rails,
he goes sure.

758
00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:39.330
And I know what his boundaries are and there's not a lot of them.
Yeah.

759
00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:43.100
So that's why I felt like I could probably far,
far to,

760
00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:45.890
and it was in our kitchen too,
which was really nice by the,

761
00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.540
we were all sitting at the dining room table.

762
00:48:47.541 --> 00:48:50.650
We having a good time and you just farted in front of her and I,

763
00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:56.250
I felt bad for you just because you felt like that was bad because like Flint

764
00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:59.670
was not at all phased.
Okay.
As long as I know.

765
00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:03.420
I when she told me to tell you personally that uh,

766
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:08.330
the other night we were,
uh,
she like gave me a kiss and I farted varieties.

767
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:10.600
Like I saved it just for that moment.
Yeah.
Yeah.

768
00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:13.610
Cause I had just gotten back from Vietnam out of town and uh,
she was like,

769
00:49:13.611 --> 00:49:17.780
tell Christina that happened is,
well,
I feel as though I've experienced the same.

770
00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:21.890
I,
yeah,
my life is a mirror to her soccer.
We're in solidarity now.

771
00:49:21.891 --> 00:49:25.340
How long did you wait before you farted in front of?
Oh God,
no,

772
00:49:25.341 --> 00:49:29.360
that was immediate.
I don't,
you got her like I'm not going to live a lie.

773
00:49:29.450 --> 00:49:30.850
Like it's Gunna happen.
What was that?

774
00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:34.630
Was it like you weren't you friends before you dated?
Is that right?
Yeah,
yeah,

775
00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:39.260
yeah.
We were friends pray before.
Yeah.
Where you farting as friend?
Yeah,
sure.

776
00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:42.970
I mean she thinks farts are funny.
Like,
yeah.

777
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:47.310
I finally let it out.
I like that Weenie burpee had yeah,
yeah,
the break.
Yeah.

778
00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:54.130
<v 1>Oh my gosh.</v>

779
00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:58.100
<v 0>So,
so you farted it as friends in front of her.</v>

780
00:49:58.101 --> 00:50:01.820
So by the time you were lovers it was like,
now do you,
here's the thing,

781
00:50:01.821 --> 00:50:05.030
here's the,
here's the line in the sand.
That type of thing I have is,
uh,

782
00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:10.090
Tom and I will make marital loves and then afterwards he'll wait about 10 or 15

783
00:50:11.271 --> 00:50:14.810
minutes before he starts farting again.
Yeah.
And then he'll,
he'll be like,

784
00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:18.950
but I held it in this whole time for you.
Like he was doing me a favor,
that hole.

785
00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:23.750
That's a huge sign of respect.
That's,
that's a long time.
I,
yeah,
like I'll,

786
00:50:23.751 --> 00:50:26.270
sometimes we'll get started and I'll be like,
oh,
I got to Fart.
Right.

787
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:30.440
And I'll hold it.
Hold it.
Do you ever done it while?
No.

788
00:50:30.441 --> 00:50:33.110
I mean it's probably been once like snuck out,
but I'm saying yeah,

789
00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:37.250
I've felt it where I could push and make a big scene and obviously I know that,

790
00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.980
you know,
get,
get an more turned off,
I'll,

791
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:43.840
I'll hold it and then I've finished and then like,

792
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:47.300
I'd really like to fart now.
It's still been like,
oh,
but you know,

793
00:50:47.301 --> 00:50:49.000
love still in the air.
I don't want to know.

794
00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:53.090
I don't want to be accused of being too much of an asshole,

795
00:50:53.091 --> 00:50:57.830
so I'll wait until it's like,
hmm.
You know,
cuddling is,
you know,

796
00:50:57.831 --> 00:51:02.330
done.
And during cuddling.
Yeah.
Don't really let me cuddle you either.

797
00:51:02.331 --> 00:51:06.080
It's another thing.
I like it.
And you're always like to hide.

798
00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:09.770
I said Hi.
You don't let me.
Yeah,
I don't like that.

799
00:51:09.771 --> 00:51:13.230
I bet my next wife will probably line up.
Exactly.
So,

800
00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:17.180
so you,
you hold it in during post coital are

801
00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:23.180
probably less than 10 minutes.
So I think he's doing great,
I think.

802
00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:26.000
I think you've got a good guy.
Of course.
Yeah.

803
00:51:26.001 --> 00:51:28.570
Do you guys shit in front of each other?
Has that barrier bro?

804
00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:31.910
Talk to each other while we shit.
I mean we don't,
we don't keep the door open.

805
00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:35.040
Yeah.
That ones,
that's a,
that's a barrier.
Like you,

806
00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:38.480
he won't let me talk to him through the door.
Oh really?
I,

807
00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:42.410
I'm like really like to block everything out.
Yeah.

808
00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:44.840
It's a bomber or apartments.
Not huge.

809
00:51:44.841 --> 00:51:48.800
And we'll have people over and we're still talking to each other while I spent a

810
00:51:48.801 --> 00:51:53.360
lot of time in there that's called love.
Tom.
Why don't you support me in that?

811
00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:55.910
I feel like if I don't turn you into the cops from murder,

812
00:51:55.911 --> 00:51:57.350
you can talk through me.

813
00:51:57.351 --> 00:51:59.130
You can talk through the door when you're taking your shit.

862
00:56:03.491 --> 00:56:06.280

871
00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:46.320
Well that was straight up from your Instagram.
Yeah,

Yeah.

872
00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:51.540
You look really cool with that haircut.
Yeah,
I love it.
And I love my expression.

873
00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:55.470
Yeah.
We always wear that same outfit.

874
00:56:58.470 --> 00:57:01.320
You never disappoint what your short game.
I'm very impressed

875
00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:01.631
<v 9>man.</v>

876
00:57:01.631 --> 00:57:06.631
There's one in Denver where I panicked because I forgot to do it and it was like

877
00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:10.520
we were about to take off and you panicked that you didn't get,

878
00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:13.530
it's so fun.
And,
uh,

879
00:57:13.531 --> 00:57:18.531
so I found a place that like a flea market that would make a like a,

880
00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.760
what's it called?
Like the spray painting?

881
00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:26.710
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
It was actually ended up being one of the most beautiful ones.</v>

882
00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:29.280
Oh,
all we,
I forget this,
but then,
you know,

883
00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:31.900
it just hits me is that when I first met him,

884
00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:35.800
it was in Cap City and in Austin and he got jumped.

885
00:57:36.690 --> 00:57:40.670
I got jumped like earlier that day or the night of the night.
Yeah.
1:00 AM,

886
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.820
I was like,
why are you on crutches?
I got jumped and then the club was like,
dude,

887
00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:50.440
if you're going to be hobbling up there,
we can't put you on.
The guys are like,

888
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:54.530
come on man,
you got crutches,
you're hobbling.
People don't want to see that.

889
00:57:54.531 --> 00:57:57.460
And he's like,
I was attacked last night.
And they're like,
yeah,

890
00:57:57.461 --> 00:58:02.350
but no one wants to look at you like this.
Managing that week was like,

891
00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:07.480
dude,
come on.
You're all fucking bruised up.
Like blaming him.

892
00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:12.200
<v 9>Yeah.
I did the,
uh,
crutches and I just took the pain.</v>

893
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:15.760
<v 0>That's still stuff on Viking and the whole weekend to me that somebody who like</v>

894
00:58:15.761 --> 00:58:17.910
you were in a car accident,
God dammit,

895
00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:21.970
I've got cuts on your face and you're like,
ah,
you piece of shit.
Yeah.

896
00:58:21.971 --> 00:58:26.020
Like yelling at the person who's sick essentially like,
come on man,

897
00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:26.863
audience won't like that.

898
00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:29.710
<v 9>Well,
and like,
yeah,
they were trying to talk me out of just like,
you should stay.</v>

899
00:58:29.711 --> 00:58:31.690
I was in the hospital and I was like telling them like,
hey,

900
00:58:31.691 --> 00:58:34.240
this is what happened.
And uh,
they were like,

901
00:58:34.241 --> 00:58:36.850
you should probably just like take care of yourself.
And I was like,
no,

902
00:58:36.851 --> 00:58:38.760
like after something like,

903
00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:41.470
I like PTSD for a little bit after that and it was like,
no,

904
00:58:41.471 --> 00:58:45.280
I need to get on stage to feel normal.
You know,
like it was pretty messed up.

905
00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:48.140
Yeah,
it was printing to get hit.
But yeah,

906
00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:51.970
my knees are just like screwed for life.
Really?
Yo.
Yeah,
it's really bad.

907
00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:54.410
What was the scenario again?
It was like just,

908
00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:58.900
I was just walking to say some say hi to a couple of friends and it was like

909
00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:02.740
late at night and I had friends that would like lectured me later.
Like,

910
00:59:02.741 --> 00:59:06.610
what was your fault for walking?
And it said,
it's not a bad neighborhood.

911
00:59:06.611 --> 00:59:09.820
It's fine.
It wasn't a bad neighborhood.
I was,
I mean it's not the best,
but it's,

912
00:59:09.850 --> 00:59:14.260
you know,
it's like I live in the middle of La,
like,
yeah.
You know,
like in Austin,

913
00:59:14.261 --> 00:59:17.410
I wouldn't think that would be a problem.
And uh,
yeah,

914
00:59:17.411 --> 00:59:20.200
I just heard like screaming,
I heard someone say,

915
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:22.340
I'm going to kill you motherfucker and they can't.

916
00:59:22.341 --> 00:59:26.450
It was a big dude and he came running with his fist up and he's running full

917
00:59:26.451 --> 00:59:30.560
speed at me and I just,
and there was a group of guys behind him,

918
00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:35.360
they were laughing,
which was just like,
so like unsettling.

919
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:37.250
And I just kind of shimmied over.

920
00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:40.610
I'm really good at juking and I just like Barry Standard over.

921
00:59:40.611 --> 00:59:43.340
And then like he ran,
he was going too fast,

922
00:59:43.341 --> 00:59:47.720
so we had to run past me and then couldn't run that way because those guys were

923
00:59:47.721 --> 00:59:50.170
there,
didn't want to run towards him.
So there's,

924
00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:54.530
there was like 10 foot ledge behind this church's chicken and I just ran and

925
00:59:54.531 --> 00:59:57.950
like long jumped off this ledge.
And I remember when I landed,

926
00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:02.210
I could see I was past this,
uh,
you know,
the parking space lines.

927
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:06.620
I had jumped almost all the way past that and just,
but when I landed,

928
01:00:06.621 --> 01:00:10.520
just everything in both legs,
just,
I knew it was bad and then they,

929
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:15.710
the guy jumped after me and then he hit his head and like he was kind of days

930
01:00:15.711 --> 01:00:17.690
and he was kind of shaking his face,
but I was like,

931
01:00:18.130 --> 01:00:21.110
I was worried I was going to get shot in the back or like those other guys,

932
01:00:21.111 --> 01:00:23.660
we're going to jump down.
And I got,
it was still trying to get up.

933
01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:27.800
And so I like ran out to like where the s the streetlights were and we'll just

934
01:00:27.801 --> 01:00:30.020
kind of waving at cars and like called my friend.

935
01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:33.470
And then just random where I was supposed to be going because it was right
there.

936
01:00:33.471 --> 01:00:37.370
It was like a three mile walk that this happened and,
and uh,

937
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:42.430
showed up and they run after you when you were not after that guy was too messed

938
01:00:43.761 --> 01:00:46.410
up I think like,
but I was still just so nervous.

939
01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:51.260
He's like people being drunk and silly I think.

940
01:00:51.350 --> 01:00:55.730
I mean,
I,
I've been in a lot of like heightened situations,

941
01:00:55.731 --> 01:00:58.370
but I've never had the like,
flight response.

942
01:00:58.850 --> 01:01:01.430
But that really felt like I had a voice in my head that was like,

943
01:01:01.431 --> 01:01:04.850
you're going to get killed.
It was really scary.
It was,
I mean,
yeah.

944
01:01:04.851 --> 01:01:09.140
It sounds terrifying.
Yeah.
Did you ever find these guys or did anything?
Oh man,

945
01:01:09.141 --> 01:01:09.921
I went to the cops.

946
01:01:09.921 --> 01:01:14.330
The cops ended up saying that they basically thought I made it up.

947
01:01:14.770 --> 01:01:19.500
And at one point I was told over the phone from a detective that,
uh,

948
01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:22.160
they basically started accusing me,

949
01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:23.850
<v 4>by the way,
I hate to cut you off.</v>

950
01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:27.000
I feel like you're the perfect person to say that too.

951
01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:30.240
Like you could tell me a story.
I'd be like,
you made that up.

952
01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:35.540
He was like,
no,
it really happened.
I'd be like,
there's something about though

953
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:42.810
that's because they picked up on the check jokester.
He was like,

954
01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:43.560
come on.

955
01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:44.520
<v 9>Well yeah it was like this weird.</v>

956
01:01:44.521 --> 01:01:48.300
So this lawyer buddy mine told me about this program that could help with my

957
01:01:48.301 --> 01:01:52.890
medical bills like through the state for situations like that.
And so,

958
01:01:52.891 --> 01:01:57.600
but because I technically wasn't hit by anyone and there was no witnesses,

959
01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:01.050
they just kind of hinted at like,
Hey,
if he just called me in,

960
01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:03.130
the first thing that was a mouth is like,
uh,

961
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:06.750
something like if you're making this up,
you're going to go to jail for awhile.

962
01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.480
And I was like,
you think I fucking made this?

963
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:13.500
I started screaming at him within that feels weird cause like to yell at a

964
01:02:13.501 --> 01:02:17.460
detective like,
and how do you handle that?
Uh,

965
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:19.800
I mean it in the,
like they,

966
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:24.240
that he still didn't really back down and then I took a lawyer down in the

967
01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:28.170
police station and that really like changed it.
The guy like,

968
01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:32.610
and the once I sat down with the detective and like showed him with detail by

969
01:02:32.611 --> 01:02:37.020
detail,
knowing everything that happened,
he kind of was like,
okay,

970
01:02:37.021 --> 01:02:37.854
this guy and bullshitting.

971
01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:41.640
And then like six months later I get a letter that was like basically like,
we,

972
01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:46.320
we think this happened,
but they couldn't even like fully like we're sorry.

973
01:02:46.321 --> 01:02:47.970
You know,
like it was a terrible,
of course

974
01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:52.200
<v 3>getting your medical bills cover Kinda,</v>

975
01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:55.980
<v 9>uh,
I mean like some of it a little bit.
Yeah.
But it was just,
yeah,</v>

976
01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:57.730
he just ignore that led it.

977
01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:01.510
<v 4>That gets so crazy.
I'm so sorry.
That terrible.
Okay.</v>

978
01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:06.110
You seem like the perfect guy to maybe weigh in on this.
We got an email.
Uh,

979
01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:08.720
somebody said,
hey,
I,
I love the,
about the Po.

980
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:11.430
I've just found the podcast have been catching up on episodes.
It's,

981
01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:12.740
I'm 22 years old.

982
01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:17.540
I just moved out of my mom's house and now I live in a five bedroom apartment in

983
01:03:17.541 --> 01:03:20.180
Chicago with roommates,
three girls and a guy.

984
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:23.930
I have never shit in a public bathroom in my life.

985
01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:29.500
I had been living in this apartment for 48 hours and still haven't shit at my

986
01:03:29.541 --> 01:03:31.250
mom's house.
I would go at least twice a day,

987
01:03:31.251 --> 01:03:35.210
sometimes up to four I've thought of going up to the rooftop of the building

988
01:03:35.330 --> 01:03:39.110
where they have two great bathrooms with loud fans and a nice shower just in

989
01:03:39.111 --> 01:03:40.280
case things got crazy.

990
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:44.000
But I can't justify going up there every time I have to go.
How do you,

991
01:03:44.001 --> 01:03:48.620
do you have any suggestions on how to overcome his,
basically his shyness?
Yeah.

992
01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:52.640
Uh,
you know how to break that down.
Yep.
Piss on me and beat me.
Thank you,

993
01:03:52.641 --> 01:03:53.474
Christian.

994
01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:58.620
<v 3>I do.
I'll tell you what.
Yeah,
go ahead.
And College,
I lived with four other kids.</v>

995
01:03:58.770 --> 01:04:01.830
Yeah.
And we had the exact same problem.
There's one Turlock.
It was,

996
01:04:01.831 --> 01:04:06.240
it's in its own room.
And then for other people,
so here's what you gotta do.

997
01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:10.890
You gotta be loud and proud and vocal and you got to start announcing your

998
01:04:10.891 --> 01:04:14.760
dumps.
Hey guys,
I gotta make a brown.
Nobody fuck with me right now.

999
01:04:14.761 --> 01:04:19.020
And maybe put like a thing on the door.
Hey,
I'm browning like a note on the door.

1000
01:04:19.021 --> 01:04:21.690
Like leave me the fuck alone.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's the only way.

1001
01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:23.400
Because when you live with them,
any people.
Yeah.

1002
01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:27.060
<v 4>When you're shooting,
let's see this guy,
he's struggling.
I,
you know,</v>

1003
01:04:27.061 --> 01:04:30.560
I feel for him because he's embarrassed,
you know,
this is,

1004
01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.620
this is new ground for him.
Cause also something every guy,

1005
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:38.390
I don't think he even ever really leaves you sometimes about like he's hesitant

1006
01:04:38.391 --> 01:04:39.230
about shitting in front of the

1007
01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:44.070
<v 9>Oh ladies.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean I still think it,</v>

1008
01:04:44.090 --> 01:04:48.810
chances are you can't,
you're not going to hook up with this is a bad idea.

1009
01:04:48.811 --> 01:04:52.240
Yeah.
If your roommates,
so I mean I think maybe we'll just own it,
I think.
Yeah.

1010
01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:56.730
Just go in there,
eat some Indian food and just really let it go.
Yeah.

1011
01:04:56.731 --> 01:04:58.320
Just announced that.
Make light of it and then

1012
01:04:58.430 --> 01:05:01.230
<v 4>walk in and be like,
hey guys,
I've got to tell you something.
Maybe.
Yeah.</v>

1013
01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:04.730
Maybe throw a House meeting,
you know,
and be like,
hey,
how's meeting?

1014
01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:07.610
And then you get,
you get an everybody in the room and you go,

1015
01:05:07.790 --> 01:05:10.570
I have to go make a chocolate right now.
And I want everybody to know.

1016
01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:11.870
And then you just,
you know,

1017
01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:16.740
<v 3>well,
cause we had,
okay,
so yeah,
we had one male living with us,
Kevin.
Yeah.</v>

1018
01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:18.010
And all knew.
And Kevin was

1019
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:19.720
<v 4>shooting.
But like you say,
like you're not banging,</v>

1020
01:05:19.721 --> 01:05:21.280
nobody was banging Kevin in the house.

1021
01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:27.040
When you start to feel weird about shitting,
you know about like,
oh my God,
every,

1022
01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:31.870
you forget everybody shits,
Bro.
Everybody does.
And everybody's shit smells.

1023
01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:34.960
Everybody's shit is shit.
So just,

1024
01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:38.710
you gotta just remember that each of those people that you're kind of

1025
01:05:38.711 --> 01:05:42.760
embarrassed to show they've had those same feelings.
Yeah.

1026
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:45.240
<v 3>And you're going to shower.
You probably have one shower.</v>

1027
01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:47.820
You're going to see each other coming out in the towel.

1028
01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:50.130
<v 4>Don't forget that pretty girl that,</v>

1029
01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:53.550
that roommate that you kind of have little crush on.
She takes smelly running.

1030
01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:55.473
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1031
01:05:55.480 --> 01:06:00.480
Real that you can run the shit you ever run the shower to cover up the side.

1032
01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:04.430
Yeah.
That's another movie.
Could try.
But I mean,
if there's a rooftop option,

1033
01:06:04.431 --> 01:06:06.980
you could also,
yeah,
but like every time he's like,
yeah,

1034
01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.880
<v 4>you just got to break it down.
You just gotta go in there,</v>

1035
01:06:08.881 --> 01:06:11.840
fucking have that morning coffee and just let it,

1036
01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:13.230
<v 3>let the brown down.
Yeah.</v>

1037
01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:17.290
I could even suggest waking up an hour before your roommate's generally do drink

1038
01:06:17.291 --> 01:06:17.831
your coffee,

1039
01:06:17.831 --> 01:06:22.480
take your ship before anyone else is awake or do late night when everybody's

1040
01:06:22.481 --> 01:06:24.670
asleep.
I mean,
I can't play on them like that.

1041
01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:29.140
Setting your alarm at four 30 to pick a monster DEP.

1042
01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:32.680
But then if you wake everybody up,
it's oof with your shit.

1043
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:37.240
<v 4>Sexy moves.
You remember?
Um,
we had the,</v>

1044
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:41.410
the guy that uh,
he had,
he put his flyer out there,

1045
01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:46.420
somebody saw him putting his flyer up,
shut the front door.
So this guy,

1046
01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:51.090
I thought this guy was incredibly terrifying.
Christina was like,
I,

1047
01:06:51.091 --> 01:06:53.140
I mean I guess I would go out of the way.
He seems nice.

1048
01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:59.650
I say this guy 100% would bash your head in with a hammer

1049
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:06.850
looking for a girlfriend.
Okay Bro.
So we got this message that somebody,

1050
01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:10.690
yeah,
he looks real sweet.
Fucking crazy.

1051
01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.210
Here's the uh,
hey.

1052
01:07:13.211 --> 01:07:18.040
I was watching the mom cast for 64 and was surprised to see a familiar face.

1053
01:07:18.041 --> 01:07:22.660
The Flyer man who was searching for a girlfriend.
I saw the same flyer,

1054
01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:25.630
snap the picture cause I could not believe such a handsome,

1055
01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:30.570
nice looking guy who only looks a little dead behind the eyes was resorting to

1056
01:07:30.571 --> 01:07:33.280
such unconventional methods and his search for love.

1057
01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:37.570
When I saw the flyer there were at least to kind souls who had ripped off the

1058
01:07:37.571 --> 01:07:39.940
name number and we're interested in contact and this man,

1059
01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:45.480
I admit I considered taking the final remaining rip off contact card but then

1060
01:07:45.971 --> 01:07:50.230
decided that although I proudly considered myself a hot white trash come dump,

1061
01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:54.400
I was not certain that I could get into being tied up in a basement and having

1062
01:07:54.401 --> 01:07:59.401
my knees broken based on his headshot slash mugshot and I've definitely killed

1063
01:08:00.421 --> 01:08:03.430
an endangered woodpecker to Mona Lisa smile.

1064
01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:07.960
The chance that our friend searching for a female companion is into light

1065
01:08:07.961 --> 01:08:12.961
bondage and Tonya Harding style leg injuries just seem too likely for me to

1066
01:08:13.061 --> 01:08:16.100
pounce.
Hope this sheds some light on the origin of this

1067
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:20.690
<v 0>flyer.
I love the podcast.
Christine is the true water champions.
Sorry Todd.</v>

1068
01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:23.760
Congrats on the birth of your second little jeans.
Keep them high and tight.

1069
01:08:24.170 --> 01:08:25.070
Kaylee.
I guess you didn't.

1070
01:08:25.071 --> 01:08:28.260
I thought she saw the guy she saw this flyer years ago.

1071
01:08:28.290 --> 01:08:33.140
See the flyer is pretty amazing.
I see a white person in person.
Incredible.

1072
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:38.000
You can for sure to see that guy like dragging a body.
Oh yeah,
I know him.

1073
01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:42.230
Can you imagine if the cops come to you and they're like,
what happened?
You know,

1074
01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:47.230
who was it?
And you're like,
well,
uh,
my friend,
um,
she uh,
she took a,

1075
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:51.350
you took a fly of the number of this guy.
They'd be like,
your friend.

1076
01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:55.520
We're not going to search for her.
She,
she called this guy like,
yeah,

1077
01:08:55.521 --> 01:08:56.920
he's looking for a girlfriend.
Like,
yeah,

1078
01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:01.130
you don't see the murder in this guy's heart.
See it through his eyes.

1079
01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:05.140
Shame on you.
Yeah.
This guy.
Now,
this guy you should call,

1080
01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:09.230
you should turn them in bed.
Who Does he look like?
Some actor.
Do you think so?

1081
01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:15.230
Ah,
yes.
He's bad.
It looks a little like,
uh,
Eric Ban and the eyes.

1082
01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:20.330
Hey,
go see.
I like Eric Bana.
I changed.
Yeah.

1083
01:09:20.331 --> 01:09:24.430
He's not that unattractive as far as these creepers go that we play on the show.

1084
01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:28.050
It's better than the guy with no teeth.
He's better than a,

1085
01:09:28.110 --> 01:09:30.560
they'll make you calm guy.
Yeah,
he's better than the right now.
Right now.

1086
01:09:30.561 --> 01:09:32.390
Right now.
Yeah.
Well,
here's the thing.

1087
01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.090
We don't know these better than any of those guys cause we're looking at a still

1088
01:09:35.091 --> 01:09:39.650
shot of him being like,
all right,
girlfriend.
That's him at his best.
Yeah.

1089
01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:42.770
That's the best representation you can chose that picture we were talking about

1090
01:09:42.771 --> 01:09:46.660
Instagram is your verb.
You're projecting like,
this is who I am.

1091
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:50.680
That's what he's like.
This who I am.
This is me right here,
Bro.

1092
01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:56.250
Hickey.
Uh,
here's a clip.
Uh,
Doug Mallory farts far too far.

1093
01:09:56.251 --> 01:09:56.840
It harder.

1094
01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:01.600
<v 10>Uh
Huh.</v>

1095
01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:09.213
<v 2>Uh,</v>

1096
01:10:10.810 --> 01:10:14.380
<v 0>it's funny stuff.
That's good.
Thanks man.
Yeah,
I worked on that.</v>

1097
01:10:14.381 --> 01:10:19.330
You said you saw the,
I saw how that started,
right?
No,
this is a,

1098
01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.190
yeah,
to do that.
That was Phil Miller.

1099
01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:25.330
Phil Minton best known for having his free form work,

1100
01:10:25.331 --> 01:10:28.750
which involves extended to techniques,
voice improvising.

1101
01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:31.120
He's the most celebrated in his field.

1102
01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:33.170
<v 2>Oh,
it's uh</v>

1103
01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:38.090
oh.
Oh,

1104
01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:40.843
ah.

1105
01:10:42.370 --> 01:10:47.080
<v 0>I mean,
good.
That's really good selling tickets.
And I'd be curious what the room,</v>

1106
01:10:47.530 --> 01:10:50.710
you need a question that you guys doing theaters,
man,

1107
01:10:55.370 --> 01:10:59.480
I'm actually opening for him next month.
How's that going to go?
I mean,

1108
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:02.630
I'm glad I'm opening.
I'm not following that.
Well,
yeah,
but what's the,

1109
01:11:02.631 --> 01:11:04.610
he's gonna not gonna have anything left to do after you're done.

1110
01:11:04.611 --> 01:11:07.670
What is this called again?
The voice improvising.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1111
01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:09.530
Vocal and probably just came up with this

1112
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:15.150
<v 12>category himself.
There's so many sounds.
It's a wide range.</v>

1113
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:16.343
It is.

1114
01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:24.630
<v 0>Isn't it upsetting that you spent 16 years honing a craft for people to notice</v>

1115
01:11:24.901 --> 01:11:28.290
you and come see your show and then this asshole too?
Yeah,

1116
01:11:28.530 --> 01:11:30.480
I'm pretty good at what I do.
Yeah.
Dickhead.

1117
01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:32.720
<v 12>[inaudible]</v>

1118
01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:39.330
<v 2>uh,
uh,</v>

1119
01:11:42.490 --> 01:11:46.070
<v 0>you know what's crazy is that anybody would go like we'll set up a chair.
Yeah.</v>

1120
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:50.070
Love to have you do bullshit that we saw you doing on the train.

1121
01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:52.920
If you don't mind the crazy,
this is the crazy guy on the subway.

1122
01:11:53.130 --> 01:11:56.430
Do you think that this isn't a museum and this is like an installation?

1123
01:11:56.460 --> 01:12:00.920
Absolutely.
We're like,
oh wonderful.
This is a,
this is good.
Oh,

1124
01:12:00.970 --> 01:12:05.250
staggering comment on capitalism and Trump's America.

1125
01:12:05.490 --> 01:12:06.320
Is that what this is?

1126
01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:09.320
That's probably exactly what this is a bunch of fucking horse shit.

1127
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:12.150
That's crazy as that anybody would walk up and be like good job.
Yeah.

1128
01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.680
That's the part that pisses me off.

1129
01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:18.180
This guy or the girlfriend looking guy who's weirder and their downtime.

1130
01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:22.080
Oh this is the fucking girlfriend first guy.
Wait,

1131
01:12:22.081 --> 01:12:26.070
which guy was this flyer guy number.
Uh,

1132
01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:29.880
I see this guy is more annoying.
This guy.
The other guy though.

1133
01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:32.870
He's wearing a tie.
Yeah,
the other guy will dismember you.
Okay.

1134
01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:36.340
Who would you rather go on a dinner date with though?
That's true.

1135
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:37.890
Well I mean do you like to listen?

1136
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:40.470
Cause this guy is definitely making it about him.

1137
01:12:40.710 --> 01:12:44.700
I think the flyer guys like tell me more about you and you know,
right.

1138
01:12:44.701 --> 01:12:46.770
Where do you go?
What time do you leave the house?

1139
01:12:46.771 --> 01:12:49.860
What time do you have any roommates who's keeping in their own bus schedule?

1140
01:12:49.861 --> 01:12:54.150
You follow?
Yeah.
He just turns off the lights and puts on classical music

1141
01:12:56.050 --> 01:12:59.580
you liked.
Do you have any duct tape and rope and your rocking?
Yup.

1142
01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:02.250
How about a shovel?
Do you have is real?

1143
01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:05.190
Let's stop at home depot before we just said,
I don't know.

1144
01:13:05.191 --> 01:13:08.880
Do we need to further the hardware store out works too.
Okay.

1145
01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:11.940
<v 13>Horse Shit.</v>

1146
01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:16.350
I mean it makes me so mad.

1147
01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:19.200
<v 14>Ooh,</v>

1148
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:23.090
<v 13>that's,
I mean that's a little bit,
that's like scatting.</v>

1149
01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.270
I don't know the cab Calloway.

1150
01:13:28.730 --> 01:13:31.070
<v 0>I'd rather listen to scatting than this guy.</v>

1151
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:35.880
I'd rather buy tickets and invest in a night watching scatting scat.
Huh.

1152
01:13:36.130 --> 01:13:39.200
And that,
what would you rather watch?
I mean I could,

1153
01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:42.860
I thought about just making some firetrucks tracks at the end of my album just

1154
01:13:42.861 --> 01:13:45.470
to end it.
And I think that would be much better than what's going on there.

1155
01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:48.940
I think that had been amazing.
If you think I should have had some bonus far,

1156
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:51.710
it's very good.
Or just the ending of it.

1157
01:13:51.850 --> 01:13:56.630
If it's a bonus track and it was just,
you're like,
plant repping forest,

1158
01:13:56.631 --> 01:13:58.340
I'd be like,
this is a great album.
Yeah.

1159
01:13:58.341 --> 01:14:00.320
It already is the greatest album ever made.

1160
01:14:00.510 --> 01:14:01.343
<v 14>Yeah.</v>

1161
01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:06.810
<v 0>Maybe I'm not sophisticated,</v>

1162
01:14:06.811 --> 01:14:10.290
but I don't understand the art world when it does stuff like that.
Yeah.

1163
01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:15.130
I like looking at stuff.
Yeah,
pretty pictures.
I mean,

1164
01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:18.640
I don't like stuff like that,
like interpretive things.
They just anger me.

1165
01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:22.180
Oh yeah,
we'll get it.
Pictures of assholes.

1166
01:14:22.181 --> 01:14:25.750
But then they'd like turn it into like,
well the deeper meaning behind this

1167
01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:32.320
colonoscopy.
Yeah.
Scan is whatever feels so bullshit.

1168
01:14:32.321 --> 01:14:35.810
Right.
It's like that's not what's happening.
I mean,
yeah.

1169
01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:38.530
I don't think it makes you feel stupid.
Yeah,
me too.

1170
01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:42.520
Like I'm not sophisticated or something cause I don't like the fucking yodeling

1171
01:14:42.521 --> 01:14:46.040
guy in the museum.
It's that's,
that's terrible.
That's all point.

1172
01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:47.050
Or something like that,
isn't it?

1173
01:14:47.051 --> 01:14:50.050
Just to make normal people feel dumb because they don't get it.

1174
01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:54.040
I'm only upset if that guy makes a living.
Yeah.
Depending on its price.

1175
01:14:54.041 --> 01:14:58.150
I would hired him for a party though,
just to like,
guys got to come over.

1176
01:14:58.430 --> 01:15:00.640
Here's the thing,
we're all going to tell him he's amazing.
That's

1177
01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.930
just everyone got like,
that's one of the greatest.

1178
01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.850
As he starts to like overstate as welcomed,

1179
01:15:07.851 --> 01:15:11.050
you just kind of shoved him out the door and they're like,
yeah.
And he's old too.

1180
01:15:11.051 --> 01:15:15.850
Like he's been doing this shit for affecting his horse shit for years.
Um,

1181
01:15:16.150 --> 01:15:17.350
yeah.
You work on that.

1182
01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:22.120
How do you yell at my friends and I have been having a heated debate.

1183
01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:24.700
One of our writers are listeners writes in about,

1184
01:15:24.701 --> 01:15:26.380
which is the proper way to make Pp.

1185
01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.860
I say you pull your hog through the hole in your boxers and go,

1186
01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:33.340
they're telling me I'm dumber than bird is racist and that you're supposed to

1187
01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:37.720
flip your Wang Dang doodle over the top of your waistband and drained the vein.

1188
01:15:37.721 --> 01:15:42.040
That way I seek your guidance,
especially the water champ on this one.

1189
01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:45.310
So when I meet a white trash comes up,
I have the proper form.

1190
01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:49.630
Looking forward to your thoughts.
Been Filler is a cook,
Kyle.

1191
01:15:50.810 --> 01:15:53.380
Oh,
white trash.
Go through the hole.

1192
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:57.100
I usually go over or just go,
you know,

1193
01:15:58.450 --> 01:16:02.440
I don't go through the whole aisle.
Here's the thing.
Okay.
Here's the truth.

1194
01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:06.970
If I'm wearing like suit pants,
right,
right,
right through the hole.

1195
01:16:07.450 --> 01:16:11.530
But if I'm wearing basically anything else I pulled away,
hang out at the top,

1196
01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:14.640
pull everything down.
What about you?
What do you do?

1197
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:16.570
I pull mine through the whole why?

1198
01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:20.050
Why did they build a whole if you're not going to use it?
No,
I know.
I think,

1199
01:16:20.410 --> 01:16:24.250
I dunno.
I mean definitely when you pull everything down the waistband down,

1200
01:16:24.251 --> 01:16:28.450
it's definitely a a boss move.
You feel like,
take this,

1201
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:30.760
look what I have for you.
The urinal,
you know,

1202
01:16:30.761 --> 01:16:34.270
it's just like everything comes out.
Feels like you're really in charge.

1203
01:16:34.730 --> 01:16:36.240
Who's just showing that you're an alum?

1204
01:16:36.250 --> 01:16:40.390
Who's boss telling me that you don't ever use the utility of the whole that's

1205
01:16:40.391 --> 01:16:44.250
provided suit pants.
Suit pants on occasion.
Yeah.

1206
01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:48.730
Explain to me why.
I think suit pants,
the way that,
you know,

1207
01:16:48.731 --> 01:16:52.770
there's usually like a buckle in a button.
So it's like more yeah,

1208
01:16:52.830 --> 01:16:56.110
to out and actually it's quite comfortable.

1209
01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:59.980
So if you're somebody who wears a suit every day,
I think that's very effective.

1210
01:16:59.981 --> 01:17:04.780
But if you're wearing,
obviously if you're,
I mean jeans,
it's kind of up to you,

1211
01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:09.560
but I think I normally,
no,
you're right.
If I have a belt on,
if I have a on,

1212
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:11.860
<v 4>I would unzip and just use just as rolling.</v>

1213
01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:17.170
<v 0>Here's the thing.
I mean you guys,
Eric,
that's the answer.
First of all,</v>

1214
01:17:17.650 --> 01:17:21.820
why can't I have panties with like a slit cut in the bottom so that I can just

1215
01:17:21.821 --> 01:17:24.940
pull the fabric apart in Piss as you can.
We should do that.

1216
01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:29.680
But it's because you guys,
yeah,
like why can't I do this too?

1217
01:17:29.681 --> 01:17:33.670
And then I'll cut a slit and my jeans and then just let the fountains gun.

1218
01:17:35.170 --> 01:17:38.700
I don't want to pull my pants down.
Ah,
who's got time for that?
All right.

1219
01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:42.820
I at urinals do the full on.
I go all the way to the ground.

1220
01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:46.780
So the urinal pulling down to my ankles.

1221
01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:51.250
It's fun.
Are you supposed to do that?
Oh No,
not at all.

1222
01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:55.390
It's just a really cruise people out.
Tom at a urinal.

1223
01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:58.270
Do you poke it through the hole or you go

1224
01:17:58.750 --> 01:18:01.960
<v 4>pull the wiener out?
And I think it all depends on the pants that I'm wearing.</v>

1225
01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:06.160
You know?
It's just really what it comes down to.
I mean,
I'm trying to think here.

1226
01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:10.720
There's certain,
like there's shorts.
Let's say I have these shorts that are uh,

1227
01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:13.060
I guess,
you know,
there's a button and a zipper.

1228
01:18:13.061 --> 01:18:16.630
It just makes sense when you walk up.
I just naturally unbuttoned,
pull it down.

1229
01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:18.460
Everything's out of the top,
you know?

1230
01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:21.430
But then if I was wearing these jeans right here,

1231
01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:25.150
there's a belt on them right now.
Yeah,
right.
No,
there's no belt on this one.

1232
01:18:25.330 --> 01:18:28.390
No belt.
Open it.
If the belt we're on,
I would,

1233
01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:32.090
I would just go through the hole.
So it just depends on the,

1234
01:18:32.970 --> 01:18:36.810
<v 0>a real volume of,
I was like Mbas slip away pants where you just,</v>

1235
01:18:37.530 --> 01:18:40.240
Oh yeah,
boom.
The warm up pants.
Yeah.
I feel like

1236
01:18:40.690 --> 01:18:45.390
<v 4>such a boss.
If I'm wearing,
you know,
no button,</v>

1237
01:18:45.391 --> 01:18:49.390
no zip.
Just let's say regular.
Let's say shorts,
like gym shorts.

1238
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:53.590
Then you pull down,
everything flops out.
That's,

1239
01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:57.430
that's that most everything tall cock,
everything's out.

1240
01:18:57.980 --> 01:18:58.813
Everything comes up.

1241
01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:04.430
<v 0>Yeah.
Tako balls.
I wish I could try it just for a day.
I don't want have any,</v>

1242
01:19:04.431 --> 01:19:08.240
he can balls permanently on the road.
He makes me do all that for her.
No,

1243
01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:10.580
that's great.
Yeah.
Part of it I would take out his,

1244
01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:16.010
let's have you weigh in on a debate that is really cooking on this show.

1245
01:19:16.011 --> 01:19:20.630
Forrest Gump?
Yes.
Oh yeah.
Wow.
You really knew we were going.

1246
01:19:20.631 --> 01:19:24.140
Wow.
Uh Wow.
Is it unethical?

1247
01:19:24.230 --> 01:19:28.160
Was it unethical for Jenny to the forest to give her aids for forced to give her

1248
01:19:28.190 --> 01:19:31.280
aids,
for her to take advantage of his mental state though.

1249
01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:36.650
Cause he was cool.
His capacity was what?

1250
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:41.450
You know his men.
Sure.
I mean he did go to college but he's,

1251
01:19:41.451 --> 01:19:45.640
because he played football games mean to college.
I forgot that Alabama.
Oh,
right.

1252
01:19:45.710 --> 01:19:48.500
Yeah.
He was a star football player.
Football,
but that's why he's a,

1253
01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:53.300
he's a football player.
He can read,
he can write,

1254
01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:57.590
he can read it cause he needed some,
a bounty on top.
Fill out a raise like,

1255
01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:02.770
like you,
I hear,
uh,
uh,
dude,
you nailed it.

1256
01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:07.950
Do you remember being on the road for like 10,
15 years

1257
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.430
<v 9>after that came out?
People there was still comics.
You'd come across it like,</v>

1258
01:20:11.710 --> 01:20:15.630
<v 0>oh,
the Gna doing their forest joke.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1259
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:20.500
And that stayed for a while and that you Baca the Chewbacca impressions lasted

1260
01:20:20.501 --> 01:20:23.000
well into early 2000 will go on.

1261
01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:27.940
Boy Arnold Arnold's stuff.
That's a biggie.
Sly.

1262
01:20:27.941 --> 01:20:32.540
I guess some of them are more on Arnold was like the one to do Dinero.

1263
01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:35.830
Oh yeah man.

1264
01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:38.250
Why are you not doing that soon after the stage man,

1265
01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:43.230
you're blowing your nose special.
Oh,

1266
01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:48.160
so what's a divisive issue?
Well,
I think I,

1267
01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:52.290
<v 9>I think he ended up making her,
making his life.</v>

1268
01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:55.650
She made his life complete in the end.
I think he was fine with it.

1269
01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:58.140
I like look at how happy that guy was

1270
01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:03.470
<v 0>cause it feels good to come.
But what is it wrong of her?
Yeah.
I mean,</v>

1271
01:21:03.471 --> 01:21:04.304
I don't think it was the best,

1272
01:21:05.150 --> 01:21:08.930
but what would you have interpreted it differently if the gender roles were

1273
01:21:08.931 --> 01:21:12.620
switched?
If a girl,
if the girl is,

1274
01:21:12.621 --> 01:21:17.270
I fall rise and he was like this normal electrical person.

1275
01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:22.310
Yeah,
that rate.
But yeah,
I don't know.

1276
01:21:22.311 --> 01:21:25.120
Some form of molestation or

1277
01:21:25.610 --> 01:21:30.610
<v 9>I think there was a someone that weighed in last time and said that like she did</v>

1278
01:21:30.801 --> 01:21:32.630
try to hook them up with a h j or so.

1279
01:21:32.850 --> 01:21:37.650
<v 0>Right.
She'd get so they made out in her dorm room and he was like,</v>

1280
01:21:37.670 --> 01:21:42.420
oh,
like he was all weird.
Like they French.
Did he come when they fucked?

1281
01:21:42.421 --> 01:21:43.740
I don't remember.
I don't like,
I think

1282
01:21:43.810 --> 01:21:48.210
<v 9>she just showed boobies and that was too much for him.
I can't remember.
Yes.</v>

1283
01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:50.010
<v 0>Yeah,
he wasn't into it.</v>

1284
01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:55.160
So he was he such an innocent though that he got quite the email about this this

1285
01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:58.770
week.
You want to hear it?
Okay.
Good Morning Mommy's,

1286
01:21:58.771 --> 01:22:02.100
I sat idle for the last few weeks listening to you butcher the Forrest Gump

1287
01:22:02.101 --> 01:22:04.890
situation.
I decided to weigh in.

1288
01:22:06.210 --> 01:22:07.380
My main point is this.

1289
01:22:07.410 --> 01:22:11.430
There is no minimum Iq level to catch a nut by saying

1290
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:17.130
that June,
that Janay shouldn't be allowed to fuck forest.

1291
01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:19.470
You're saying that he's too stupid to come.

1292
01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:22.530
This sounds a lot like eugenics.

1293
01:22:22.770 --> 01:22:25.080
Only the smartest among the should be allowed to come.

1294
01:22:25.081 --> 01:22:29.670
This is precisely what Hitler was trying to pull off.
Forest.

1295
01:22:29.671 --> 01:22:33.360
Isn't that stupid?
He attended college,
was a member of the armed forces,

1296
01:22:33.810 --> 01:22:35.490
a multinational corporation,

1297
01:22:36.090 --> 01:22:39.810
and was apparently able to navigate his way around the country on foot.

1298
01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:44.730
I could not pull these things off using game alone.

1299
01:22:44.731 --> 01:22:47.610
He was able to pull some smears on multiple occasions.

1300
01:22:47.610 --> 01:22:48.930
In his first encounter with Jenny,

1301
01:22:49.050 --> 01:22:52.920
he caught his nut with zero consideration for her orgasm.
In spite of this,

1302
01:22:52.921 --> 01:22:57.210
he was able to convince her to engage his love making on another occasion and

1303
01:22:57.211 --> 01:23:00.630
apparently the only thing us pulls out of his his driveway.

1304
01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:02.970
That's the mark of a true cocksman.

1305
01:23:03.330 --> 01:23:07.960
Jenny also did not have HIV.
This is a common conclusion,

1306
01:23:07.961 --> 01:23:10.870
but incorrect.
It was never stated exactly what she had,

1307
01:23:11.170 --> 01:23:13.870
but in the second book it was confirmed it was hepatitis.

1308
01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:17.590
This is why forest didn't have the disease.
Even though he goes,

1309
01:23:17.591 --> 01:23:22.120
Rah loved the show.
My friend turned me on a few months ago.

1310
01:23:22.121 --> 01:23:24.550
I've gone back and listened to a bunch of keep up the good work.

1311
01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:27.280
Beat me and Piss on me.
Todd in Pittsburgh.

1312
01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:31.230
Well that is just about wraps up Solomon.
I think.
Todd,
thank you so much.

1313
01:23:31.231 --> 01:23:34.110
Nice clothes,
Judge Todd.
Todd,
get it.

1314
01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:37.490
Let us know he's right now.
I see it differently.
Well,

1315
01:23:37.491 --> 01:23:42.140
I hadn't considered too stupid to come for us.
That went to down to come

1316
01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:45.700
to your next album.
Yeah.

1317
01:23:46.450 --> 01:23:50.920
Not too damn far.
It's hard.
It's three.
Not too dumb to come.

1318
01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:54.970
Hey,
I'm going to write that down.
Yeah,
it's out there.

1319
01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:59.630
But considering his accomplishments that you did do everything,
so yeah.

1320
01:23:59.650 --> 01:24:03.730
Who did judge what he can come and not come.
Whatever.
That's true.

1321
01:24:03.731 --> 01:24:05.040
You can come whenever he wants it.

1322
01:24:05.041 --> 01:24:07.210
If he can run a corporation and do all that stuff.

1323
01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:09.880
There was a Forrest Gump to book.

1324
01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:15.020
I didn't even know there was not,
I was not aware.
Um,

1325
01:24:15.530 --> 01:24:18.940
look at this person told us,
hey,
hello out there.

1326
01:24:18.941 --> 01:24:22.390
I found this in my neighbor's lawn and I find that it's basically the stranger

1327
01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:25.340
equivalent to telling your aunt what makes you come and forth.

1328
01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:30.090
I wanted to hear you weigh in on this nice front long decore.

1329
01:24:30.091 --> 01:24:35.080
Am I just a big fat black Dick or is this unnecessary?
Okay,

1330
01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:38.110
here's the neighbors in this house.

1331
01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:41.830
We believe healthcare is a human right.
Black lives matter.

1332
01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:45.670
Women's rights are human rights.
No human is illegal.
Science is real.

1333
01:24:45.671 --> 01:24:49.540
Love is love.
That is quite the declaration for the lawn,
right?

1334
01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:54.910
Everybody know I'm a social justice warrior and I got no children and no

1335
01:24:54.911 --> 01:24:59.110
responsibilities and my life.
You know what?
I would do a lot of free time.

1336
01:24:59.111 --> 01:25:02.170
I would I,
I mean,
I think it's obviously,
it's fine.
Whatever you want.

1337
01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:03.370
I think you should.

1338
01:25:03.371 --> 01:25:08.371
Maybe you make a big brown chocolate right here and then put your own sign in it

1339
01:25:08.621 --> 01:25:12.790
and you go in my house.
This is where I take a shit.
Put it right there.

1340
01:25:13.570 --> 01:25:17.770
It's just annoying.
It's like the Jadah speech or something.

1341
01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:21.820
It's annoying and especially because,
well,
let's see.
Let's do the other way.

1342
01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:25.390
If somebody who was on the opposite end of that spectrum put a sign on their
lawn

1343
01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:30.250
really lit up.
Yeah,
it's,
it is though.

1344
01:25:30.251 --> 01:25:34.240
It's like the person said it's the equivalent of being like I got to tell people

1345
01:25:34.241 --> 01:25:35.780
what turns me on.
You know,

1346
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:40.510
like I have to announce that I'm pansexual to my parents at Thanksgiving and

1347
01:25:40.511 --> 01:25:44.830
ruin their holiday armpits.
Give me a hard on God just when I eat Turkey,

1348
01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:49.840
you know you don't have to tell him.
Do both.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1349
01:25:50.530 --> 01:25:54.070
It is like bumper stickers which were much bigger and like the eighties I feel

1350
01:25:54.071 --> 01:25:57.700
like when everyone had to put their political leaning and they're driven by one

1351
01:25:57.701 --> 01:26:02.380
of those cars that has like 40 bumper stickers,
what can I get pulled over?

1352
01:26:02.590 --> 01:26:06.140
What kind of instability is in that?
But that kind of went out of fashion,

1353
01:26:06.141 --> 01:26:09.770
these bumper stickers,
but for a while it was declared your,

1354
01:26:09.890 --> 01:26:13.460
now I guess it's social media.
You can be like,
this is what I'm all about.

1355
01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:15.710
Here's my political still like,
all right dude.

1356
01:26:15.890 --> 01:26:18.980
Plus we have emojis which are just stickers now.
Yeah.

1357
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:22.070
Let we get to be children is through our phones.
I guess.

1358
01:26:22.130 --> 01:26:24.690
Here's somebody just telling you what makes them come.
You know?

1359
01:26:26.050 --> 01:26:30.490
<v 3>Can I read this one?
I think I like it.
Just another day being bio,</v>

1360
01:26:30.491 --> 01:26:34.330
gender.
I feel so amazing.
I love being connected to nature.

1361
01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:37.720
I'm a reincarnation of a dinosaur.
I'm so happy.

1362
01:26:37.721 --> 01:26:42.490
Thank you all for being accepting and to my haters.
Please stop.
Love you all.

1363
01:26:42.810 --> 01:26:46.900
Uh,
there's zero punctuation.
Describe what's in these photos then.
Um,

1364
01:26:46.930 --> 01:26:49.150
I don't know what their pronoun is.
Yeah,

1365
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:54.990
there's a person in grass like licking the grass and then this person is,

1366
01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:59.290
has a leaf in their mouth like there.
I mean,
they're also staring at the camera.

1367
01:26:59.330 --> 01:27:00.640
Sure.
So it's menacing.

1368
01:27:01.710 --> 01:27:06.370
Menace thing or extremely hot depending on as a bio,

1369
01:27:06.371 --> 01:27:09.370
gender person,
myself,
biogen,
biogen,

1370
01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:13.950
<v 0>I'm going to jerk off for sure.
Are they wearing like the color lenses?
Can I say,</v>

1371
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:17.500
oh my God,
I hear that's,
it makes it even more terrifying.
Now,

1372
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:21.050
how long do you think this horse shit,
it's gonna last.
Imagine being the parent.

1373
01:27:21.051 --> 01:27:24.260
That's what I think.
Ah,
yeah.
How old are you?
I mean think this person is,

1374
01:27:24.261 --> 01:27:29.240
this person is not that old.
I think they're like a teen at the,
at the oldest.

1375
01:27:29.241 --> 01:27:33.350
They're like 1920 but you know if you're a parent you've got to be like,
look,

1376
01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:39.380
I know you jerk off in the yard.
You don't have to share this stuff.
All right.

1377
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:41.150
And then they're like,
dad,

1378
01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:45.890
so sick of all your fucking antiquated views on the world.

1379
01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:48.500
But how long do you think this trend is going to go on?

1380
01:27:48.501 --> 01:27:51.800
This gender horse does biogen,
I think it's revving up.
Let's just,

1381
01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:55.990
just getting started.
Oh I think so.
Yeah,
they're 10 years.
Oh yeah.
Easy.
Huh.

1382
01:27:56.100 --> 01:27:58.970
That's,
that's the horse like with us growing up,

1383
01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:02.820
the pictures you had like the real photographs.
Yeah.

1384
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:06.260
So we don't have the constant evidence that like I went through some weird

1385
01:28:06.261 --> 01:28:10.100
phases that the map fucking crazy,
but that person forever,

1386
01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:14.900
it just has this stamp of like if they have kids like Yup.
There you were.

1387
01:28:14.970 --> 01:28:19.010
Just being a dinosaur,
getting your fuck on.
Imagine you know how we get,

1388
01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.770
you get embarrassed of some things from your youth.
Like,

1389
01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:25.310
let's say you see a picture of leading bear,
but like,
you know,
like I'll,

1390
01:28:25.311 --> 01:28:29.210
I'll see a photo or a video of myself again.
I hate everything.

1391
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:33.860
I'd just like totally cringe.
Yeah.
Um,
this I would hope,

1392
01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:38.510
I think of when this person's a 35,
they see this and they're like,

1393
01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:42.470
oh my God,
no,
they're going to be bio gendered forever,
Tom.

1394
01:28:42.471 --> 01:28:47.300
It's how they identify.
Yeah.
There's just like,
I need to get back to that.
Uh,

1395
01:28:47.630 --> 01:28:52.630
I lost myself a businessman now with this make you want to know what somebody

1396
01:28:52.791 --> 01:28:56.750
sent us.
Pretty amazing.
They sent us to,
sure.
Um,
okay,

1397
01:28:57.020 --> 01:29:01.100
so amber emailed us.
She goes,
this past weekend,
my friends,

1398
01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:02.040
I took 10 or 12

1399
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:06.950
<v 4>Benadryl and hit the tent not long after we arrived.</v>

1400
01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:11.960
Some real f g t r d t was telling me about this video his friend receive after

1401
01:29:14.251 --> 01:29:19.140
drug and lead dancing and giving her phone number to a real shit pig.

1402
01:29:19.770 --> 01:29:21.250
Thought you guys might enjoy this man.

1403
01:29:21.251 --> 01:29:24.780
His dedication to texting a 20 something girl,

1404
01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:28.790
this gem of a video first thing in the morning for her to wake up.
So,

1405
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:32.340
so it's like you meet a guy,
he's like,
we got your number.
And she's like,

1406
01:29:32.370 --> 01:29:37.370
all right,
give us a number.
Next day you wake up.
Um,
she goes,

1407
01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:41.120
she goes,
sorry.
He hasn't shirtless.
It was a real blessing in disguise.
Um,

1408
01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:44.970
we're all dedicated members of the forest stroking amber.
But like,
imagine,

1409
01:29:44.971 --> 01:29:48.030
you know,
you're out your friends,
right?
But this is like,

1410
01:29:48.031 --> 01:29:50.700
you're out of college basically.
Yeah.
And like some guy's like,

1411
01:29:50.850 --> 01:29:52.950
can I get those digits?
And you're like,
okay.

1412
01:29:53.490 --> 01:29:58.440
And then the next morning you're like,
man,
that was a,
I was a late night.

1413
01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:03.360
I think I drank too much.
Oh,
what's this on my phone?
Good morning,
Julia.

1414
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:08.610
Me Gel.
Just wanting to say hi.
Wish you a great day.

1415
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:10.870
Tell you that meeting you yesterday

1416
01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:15.560
<v 0>and getting a look at you was probably one of the greatest moments of my life.</v>

1417
01:30:15.950 --> 01:30:20.060
You were so beautiful.
You don't know how beautiful you are to me.

1418
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:23.090
I mean,
just,
you're gorgeous,
you're precious.

1419
01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:25.910
But it's been sitting in my mind when you said to me,

1420
01:30:25.911 --> 01:30:30.320
you want to go back with your ex boyfriend,
please erase him from your memory.

1421
01:30:30.530 --> 01:30:32.480
Don't ever go back in the past.
I know,

1422
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:36.860
cause I've been there and I understand when you know you're trying to find

1423
01:30:36.861 --> 01:30:41.861
somebody and you go on dates and nothing compares to your racks,

1424
01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:46.820
but there is that better person out there and Julia,

1425
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.390
I promise you it is me.
I love you like you've never been loved before.
Oh God.

1426
01:30:51.450 --> 01:30:55.730
Oh cherish shoe.
I'll make you feel like a woman,
a real woman,

1427
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:58.340
and believe me,
after you experienced me,

1428
01:30:58.830 --> 01:31:00.440
you won't even know who your ex boyfriend is.

1429
01:31:01.010 --> 01:31:04.040
How's he sound like Bill Burkhart to me in your arms?

1430
01:31:05.090 --> 01:31:08.570
Open up your heart to make in your arms.
Oh my God,

1431
01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:10.730
let's go full throttle.

1432
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:14.270
I could see me falling in love with you with just so I don't know.

1433
01:31:14.271 --> 01:31:17.750
I just looked into your eyes and I just melt.
Anyhow,

1434
01:31:18.230 --> 01:31:21.080
I'm heading off to work.
This is my cute little home.

1435
01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:22.790
Everything you see behind me,

1436
01:31:23.090 --> 01:31:28.090
I built everything every square inch from crown mold into chair rail to floors,

1437
01:31:28.221 --> 01:31:31.740
to lighting,
to plumbing,
doors,
windows,
whatever,

1438
01:31:31.810 --> 01:31:35.770
<v 4>bells like this how I got my girl that's in a video.
I was like,
yeah,</v>

1439
01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:38.680
this is my house.
I tell jokes and uh,

1440
01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:41.020
I could see myself going full throttle with you.

1441
01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:46.040
<v 0>So this is the type of guy you get head the guy,
right.</v>

1442
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:49.960
I love to build you,
whatever you want a sweetheart.

1443
01:31:50.290 --> 01:31:54.340
So I hope this video doesn't scare you.
That's how I feel.

1444
01:31:55.210 --> 01:31:58.950
I just want you to know that.
Okay.
When I look for you have to say that.
Yeah.

1445
01:31:59.150 --> 01:32:03.470
With you.
So let's make it happen.
No.
Ah,

1446
01:32:03.970 --> 01:32:08.830
Ciao Baby.
Oh perfect.
And they just,
I mean I feel bad for,

1447
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:10.960
I'm embarrassed for him.
Yeah.
I also,

1448
01:32:11.310 --> 01:32:15.730
I it brings about just any embarrassing thing I've ever done in my mind.

1449
01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:20.050
You know,
like you go like when,
cause the,
the feeling I get for him is like,

1450
01:32:20.530 --> 01:32:23.980
it's reminiscent of feeling bit embarrassed for myself.
Right.
You know,

1451
01:32:23.981 --> 01:32:27.880
you put yourself out there for,
girls are going like,
what have I done?

1452
01:32:27.881 --> 01:32:32.300
Like one time.
Oh God,
I left a voice mail.

1453
01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:35.680
Oh my God,
I've never done that.

1454
01:32:35.710 --> 01:32:39.670
I've gotten a few of those embarrassing voice voicemail because this is prior to

1455
01:32:39.671 --> 01:32:43.720
the day.
What kind of voicemail?
Okay,
so there was a guy,

1456
01:32:43.721 --> 01:32:48.130
I was seeing it very early.
It was very early,
like,
like one,

1457
01:32:48.190 --> 01:32:51.220
one time we hung out and it was like,
I miss you.

1458
01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:55.720
I just wanna let you know I'm thinking about you.
Yeah.
I just,

1459
01:32:55.721 --> 01:33:00.040
I miss you so much.
And I was like,
well,
you just went out on like,
yeah,

1460
01:33:00.041 --> 01:33:02.570
I think I've done that before.
Yeah.

1461
01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:05.410
And then like maybe had a song playing.

1462
01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:09.140
<v 9>How old are you?</v>

1463
01:33:09.370 --> 01:33:12.830
<v 0>Like 33 no,
I was,
uh,
no,</v>

1464
01:33:12.850 --> 01:33:16.230
it was like 20 weeks.
Yeah,
that's about the age I was,

1465
01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:19.960
but it's just the kind of thing where I feel like,
it's like as you hang up,

1466
01:33:19.961 --> 01:33:23.500
you're like,
what the fuck did I like?
It almost immediately history.
You're like,

1467
01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:28.030
I should kill myself.
Yeah,
for sure.
You're like,
I,

1468
01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:32.110
I need,
I need to,
I need to kill her

1469
01:33:34.110 --> 01:33:36.190
fucking boys seeing,
there it is.

1470
01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:39.920
That's why I turned to the police.

1471
01:33:40.570 --> 01:33:44.320
I'm going to go steal this woman's phone so that she can never hear this.

1472
01:33:46.090 --> 01:33:48.700
But he has some awareness that it's not cool because he's like,

1473
01:33:48.701 --> 01:33:52.750
I hope this isn't free.
Right.
Which is,
no,
that's not a good writer.
He does know.

1474
01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:54.490
He does know and he probably,

1475
01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:58.540
what happens is he has the thought right before he's like,
oh,

1476
01:33:58.541 --> 01:34:02.230
this could come across as scary or weird,
but he's like,
well,
you know what?

1477
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:06.350
I feel so such that that love,
oh my God,

1478
01:34:06.351 --> 01:34:10.660
the Nri relationship energy move and he's just like send.

1479
01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:14.440
And then in his,
in his dream mind,
he's like,

1480
01:34:14.441 --> 01:34:18.370
it's going to be the best reception back.
She's going to be like,
oh my God,

1481
01:34:18.371 --> 01:34:23.320
I loved waking up to this.
That's what he,
that guys so long.

1482
01:34:23.321 --> 01:34:25.320
Have you ever done that?
Really got the message like that?

1483
01:34:25.470 --> 01:34:27.720
<v 9>Oh yeah,
countless times.
I mean,
I was,</v>

1484
01:34:29.490 --> 01:34:33.910
I feel like more like middle school.
Junior high.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1485
01:34:33.930 --> 01:34:38.040
You're like figuring it out and you're just so terrible.
But yeah,

1486
01:34:38.041 --> 01:34:40.110
it's that immediate like,
but yeah,

1487
01:34:40.111 --> 01:34:43.500
it was like you can't go back and this is before he could even like,

1488
01:34:43.501 --> 01:34:46.320
did you like your message?
It was before that stuff where it was just like,

1489
01:34:46.710 --> 01:34:49.680
well this is it.
So you keep kind of like that guy where it's like,

1490
01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:54.220
but he could have edited that or done it over,
but it's like you just keep going.

1491
01:34:54.250 --> 01:34:56.010
You're like,
oh,
I've got to dig out of this hole.

1492
01:34:56.011 --> 01:34:57.930
So he keep going in and deeper and,
but,

1493
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:59.120
<v 0>but that I had options.</v>

1494
01:35:00.530 --> 01:35:05.250
It doesn't scare you if you stayed at them.
It's fucking terrifying dude hub.

1495
01:35:05.450 --> 01:35:08.630
Just scared that I also have already declared my love for you.

1496
01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:13.790
That's awesome.
I've done before you go on a date,
you're like,

1497
01:35:14.250 --> 01:35:18.110
pretty sure I love you.
And they're like,
ah dude.

1498
01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:23.870
I
one time I think I told you this story.

1499
01:35:25.190 --> 01:35:27.590
<v 9>Oh,
this woman got so afraid of meat.</v>

1500
01:35:27.591 --> 01:35:30.470
So we hung out one night in New Orleans.

1501
01:35:30.471 --> 01:35:33.830
We met on the streets of Austin after,
it wasn't Katrina,

1502
01:35:33.831 --> 01:35:36.380
but whatever it was before that.
And as she was just like,

1503
01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:41.330
had to like get out of town.
She's in Austin,
parting run into her.
We hit it off.

1504
01:35:41.331 --> 01:35:45.470
She's real cute.
We'd go like,
I'll give you a place to stay if you fuck me.
No,
no.

1505
01:35:45.471 --> 01:35:48.350
I was like,
she was only in for that night,
but I was like,

1506
01:35:48.351 --> 01:35:51.170
I was randomly going to be in New Orleans two weeks later for the first time.

1507
01:35:51.171 --> 01:35:55.220
And she's like,
hit me up.
Let's hang out.
So I go,
I hang out with her.
I mean,

1508
01:35:55.221 --> 01:35:57.020
she was just,
she was stunning.

1509
01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:02.560
We had a really good time and then we make out some stuff happens and it was

1510
01:36:04.671 --> 01:36:09.290
right after that movie punch.
Drunk love came out and there's this,
there's a,

1511
01:36:09.291 --> 01:36:14.000
see I love that movie.
Great.
And uh,
there's a line,
the Adam Sandler says,

1512
01:36:14.150 --> 01:36:18.140
you're so beautiful.
I just want to smash you in the face with a sledge.
Yes.

1513
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:22.310
And I said that to her and uh,
without context,

1514
01:36:22.311 --> 01:36:26.600
if she has not seen the film,
uh,
yeah.
She immediately was like,
well,

1515
01:36:26.601 --> 01:36:29.900
we're going like,
she,
her whole demeanor just changed.

1516
01:36:30.510 --> 01:36:34.820
<v 0>Yeah.
She,
she somehow gave me a ride back to the hotel,
which I,</v>

1517
01:36:34.821 --> 01:36:38.300
she didn't have to die if I,
if it were reversed and I didn't know the context,

1518
01:36:38.301 --> 01:36:39.890
I'd be like,
get the fuck out.

1519
01:36:40.650 --> 01:36:42.730
<v 9>She still gave me a ride,
but it didn't say one way or the whole.</v>

1520
01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:47.670
<v 4>I said a similar thing to her.
A second date,</v>

1521
01:36:47.671 --> 01:36:48.504
third date,

1522
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:53.490
<v 0>10 years later,
married two kids.
Oh my God.
I was like,</v>

1523
01:36:53.491 --> 01:36:54.810
I'm so into you.

1524
01:36:55.080 --> 01:37:00.080
I want to put your head through that dresser and like and smash it against the

1525
01:37:00.181 --> 01:37:04.510
wall.
And she was like,
okay,
congrats.
Yeah,

1526
01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:07.530
almost 10 year.
But you didn't call the cops then.
So that's a good big plus.

1527
01:37:07.770 --> 01:37:10.530
But thinking about staying married,
you know,
but it was a red flag.

1528
01:37:10.531 --> 01:37:15.060
I did laugh cause I was like war comedians.
So that's funny.

1529
01:37:15.061 --> 01:37:17.900
But on the other hand I was like,
he's really violent.
I'm not sure I should.

1530
01:37:17.901 --> 01:37:19.630
But that's also like you see a baby,
you're like,

1531
01:37:19.631 --> 01:37:22.260
you're just so fucking cute or just want to smash your fucking face.

1532
01:37:22.261 --> 01:37:23.330
Then you know,
we're

1533
01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:27.990
<v 4>going to that one.
Do you remember?
It was like in a strip mall,
a silver lake,</v>

1534
01:37:28.110 --> 01:37:31.590
um,
restaurant where they would make things off the menu.

1535
01:37:31.770 --> 01:37:34.950
Do you remember this place?
It was like a,
uh,

1536
01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:39.750
a very small restaurant and it was like a guy who was the head chef at another

1537
01:37:39.751 --> 01:37:43.680
restaurant,
opened his own restaurant.
I'm vaguely sorry.
Yeah.
Anyways,

1538
01:37:43.710 --> 01:37:48.710
I remember sitting in that restaurant and I'm ordering stuff that like is not on

1539
01:37:50.221 --> 01:37:55.221
the menu that we'd learned from going there a couple times and describing being

1540
01:37:55.351 --> 01:37:56.010
like,
can we

1541
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:58.980
<v 3>were there with him.
It was like another couple with us.
I go,</v>

1542
01:37:58.981 --> 01:38:00.060
this food is so good,

1543
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:03.620
you're going to want to go in the kitchen and beat the shit out of the guidance.

1544
01:38:04.830 --> 01:38:07.820
And the guy at another table tournament,
he goes 100%.

1545
01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:10.360
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1546
01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:13.180
<v 3>he was.
He got it.
But um,
yeah,</v>

1547
01:38:13.181 --> 01:38:17.680
I guess it wasn't the smartest thing to say three days.
Well,
as you can see,

1548
01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:19.350
audio worked out listening.

1549
01:38:19.390 --> 01:38:22.870
My husband has a long history of declaring violence,

1550
01:38:22.930 --> 01:38:27.480
senseless violence on me,
on restaurant tears,
restaurant tours,

1551
01:38:27.670 --> 01:38:28.720
[inaudible] chefs.

1552
01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:33.340
<v 0>Uh,
I sent that same girl like a letter later.
Just kind of tried to apologize,</v>

1553
01:38:33.341 --> 01:38:36.940
but it probably came off as like that guy's video,
I'm sure.
Oh yeah.

1554
01:38:37.330 --> 01:38:40.280
They ended with Chow.
And I hope this isn't crazy,
but,

1555
01:38:40.850 --> 01:38:45.070
and when you try to follow up on something like that,
yeah,
no,
no,
sure.

1556
01:38:45.071 --> 01:38:48.980
To let it go.
Uh Huh.

1557
01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:52.650
<v 3>There's so many of those Nike memes and it's,
you know,</v>

1558
01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:56.980

1561
01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:08.830

And it just says,

1562
01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:13.520
just try it out so hard at that.
Um,

1573

Oh yeah.

Now what I liked about this video is he got a nice new haircut.
Yeah.

1597
01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.670
He looked fresh.
We got a close up of the mouth.

1598
01:41:55.700 --> 01:42:00.200
I got to really see those teeth that look like a candy corn just with four of

1599
01:42:00.201 --> 01:42:04.130
them and we got a neat burp at the end.
Yeah,
that's pretty cool.
Yeah.

1600
01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:09.080
I that guy in some print ads for sure.

Ah,

Is he speaking espanol?
I didn't here,

They speak in Spanish.
Si.

1609
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:49.303
<v 10>I don't think he's speaking.</v>

Huh.
Um,

he's drunk.
He's speaking.

1612
01:42:59.451 --> 01:43:03.560
Do you think he drinks?
He looks like a guy that

1613
01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:08.090
used to hang out outside of my apartment and Korea dam.

1614
01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:11.780
They would always just be passed out playing with his belly button.
Uh,

1615
01:43:12.350 --> 01:43:14.630
I miss that guy a little bit.
Hey,

Yeah,

So.
Yeah.
Hopefully he's still there.

1619
01:43:25.930 --> 01:43:29.510

01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:35.000
And there's the bearded lady in Silver Lake and let me know if she's still

1622
01:43:35.001 --> 01:43:36.850
around.
And uh,
there's a budget.

1623
01:43:36.860 --> 01:43:40.490
There's a few people that kicky foot in their wheelchairs.
Oh yeah.
Kick,
kick,

1624
01:43:40.491 --> 01:43:43.190
kick,
kick,
kick,
kick,
kick.
And you're like,
oh,
your legs were pretty well,

1625
01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:48.320
thank you for the rest.
Easier than walking.
It is easy.

1626
01:43:48.350 --> 01:43:51.980
There's a dude in silver lake now that like he's always on a scooter

1627
01:43:52.490 --> 01:43:53.121
<v 9>and uh,</v>

1628
01:43:53.121 --> 01:43:57.920
at one point that Mcdonald's near us burnt down and so they had their giant m

1629
01:43:57.950 --> 01:44:02.950
just on the ground and he rolls up on his little rascal gets,

1630
01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:04.280
I don't even think he needs it.

1631
01:44:04.281 --> 01:44:07.970
Like he's just lazy or whatever gets up off the rascal.
He gets the M,

1632
01:44:07.971 --> 01:44:12.890
puts it on his shoulder,
just zips off and it's right outside of his house.
I see.

1633
01:44:12.891 --> 01:44:14.520
This is why I Miss Silver Lake.
Yeah,

1634
01:44:14.521 --> 01:44:16.080
that's pretty great because they had such a good,

1635
01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:19.040
<v 0>great bevy of Weirdos.
They don't see it in the burbs here.
Now,</v>

1636
01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:22.460
there was a silver Lake Walker,
I dunno if that may be before your time,

1637
01:44:22.461 --> 01:44:25.190
but there was,
this guy was a doctor,
a medical doctor,

1638
01:44:25.410 --> 01:44:29.360
but he would eat like crap and apparently would spend about 12 hours a day just

1639
01:44:29.361 --> 01:44:32.240
walking through silver lake shirtless in these turquoise shorts.

1640
01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:36.860
There's even a mural dedicated to him on the sunset.
There's the pink guy.

1641
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:38.810
I've seen the pink,
pink,
pink,

1642
01:44:40.100 --> 01:44:44.700
there's the purple lady at Michael's arts and crafts and I fucked her.
Yeah,

1643
01:44:44.930 --> 01:44:45.561
we've been talking about,

1644
01:44:45.561 --> 01:44:48.890
but I'm talking about this in my act now actually because it's such,

1645
01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:51.380
it's so in my brain,
the uh,

1646
01:44:51.381 --> 01:44:56.381
the people who do speakerphone conversation got in public.

1647
01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:01.570
I can ask this lady,
Rita sent us this.
She's a dental hygienist.
Yeah.

1648
01:45:01.670 --> 01:45:05.620
And one of her patients took two calls during his cleaning.
No.

1649
01:45:06.150 --> 01:45:07.180
<v 7>How do you even do that?</v>

1650
01:45:07.181 --> 01:45:12.181
So people are super conscious of their time and they don't want us to take their

1651
01:45:12.421 --> 01:45:16.620
time,
but yet this patient a while,
I literally had my hands in their mouth,

1652
01:45:16.621 --> 01:45:19.530
had answered the phone.
No it flip it.
Open speakerphone,

1653
01:45:19.650 --> 01:45:21.750
no girl speakerphone moments.

1654
01:45:21.751 --> 01:45:26.520
So this is my operatory and I have this partition and there's the chair next to

1655
01:45:26.521 --> 01:45:30.690
me.
So not only did I get to hear the patient's conversations,

1656
01:45:30.691 --> 01:45:32.230
but I had two other people next to you.

1657
01:45:32.260 --> 01:45:35.910
They get to hear the patient's conversation as well.
So again,

1658
01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:39.030
speakerphone and inappropriate in public places.

1659
01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:43.570
I love you guys making fitness.
Say United.
Yeah

1660
01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:46.300
<v 0>girl.
But I mean,
come,
come on.</v>

1661
01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:50.540
<v 9>I think she should be able to do it right back at while she's doing it.</v>

1662
01:45:50.541 --> 01:45:52.520
Just like,
well fuck it.
I'll fight fire with fire.

1663
01:45:52.521 --> 01:45:55.010
And just let that lady panicked that like my dentist is not,

1664
01:45:55.011 --> 01:45:55.844
maybe I should get off this.

1665
01:45:56.140 --> 01:46:01.120
<v 0>The level of fucking obliviousness people are great.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1666
01:46:01.230 --> 01:46:05.470
All of them.
Yeah.
All people are great.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm actually,

1667
01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:07.220
oh,
sorry.
No,
no,
I,

1668
01:46:07.221 --> 01:46:10.060
I'm just gonna say that I'm so surprised that a medical professional listens to

1669
01:46:10.061 --> 01:46:13.930
this show.
Oh,
we've been hit up by,
I did not.

1670
01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:19.020
We got a top tier doctor really?
Guy Sent me,
um,
really?
Yeah,

1671
01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:22.480
he sent me a message about,
he's like,
I can answer all your Dick Question and um,

1672
01:46:22.540 --> 01:46:25.180
he goes,
just don't use my name.
I'm like a urologist at this.

1673
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:27.100
And he sent me pictures.
He's like,

1674
01:46:27.101 --> 01:46:31.020
he's like a victory king and zippers don't go well together is Dick's card

1675
01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:35.150
zippers?
Holy Shit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm,
I'm married.
I can't believe it.

1676
01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:39.760
She's such a nice,
sweet lady.
Smart but a,
yeah,
no,
absolutely.
That,

1677
01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:43.090
that level of this where she would like farts and stuff is what I'm saying.

1678
01:46:43.150 --> 01:46:46.960
The level of disrespect to that guy.
It's preposterous.
Yeah.
It's really crazy.

1679
01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:50.020
Preposterous.
But I do,
I facetime all

1680
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:53.460
<v 9>shit and all that while you're at the airport.
Yeah.
At the airport.
You know,</v>

1681
01:46:53.470 --> 01:46:56.800
just let it,
just scream it now.
But you hear that at the airport a lot.
Yeah.

1682
01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:00.300
<v 0>Yeah.
I've recorded people having conversations,</v>

1683
01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:05.180
having shit all the time arguments.
Yeah.
And like the greatest

1684
01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:09.850
<v 4>is,
um,
you know,
you'll be at an airport bathroom,</v>

1685
01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:14.230

Just flush,
flush philosophy,
just noise.

1686
01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:15.070
And a guy would be like,

1687
01:47:15.070 --> 01:47:19.950
<v 0>that's correct.
Yup.
Uh,

1688
01:47:20.030 --> 01:47:24.330

1689

1692
01:47:36.031 --> 01:47:39.950
