24
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.090
oh my God,
I can't say anything yet because it's not an official,

25
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.080
I wouldn't say anything,
but I'm saying don't get mad at me when this happens.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.840
Don't hate the player.
Hate the game.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.420
I guess there's a boy,

And then there's like,
um,

29
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.830
I dunno,
there's just a couple blow bangs,
but yeah.
Uh,

30
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:34.500
I have to shoot those scenes and um,

31
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.730
it's going to make me have to move and loose some live dates,

32
00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:41.400
which whatever,
I can't get into it yet,

33
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.990
but as soon as they get the official word on it,
I will post about it and I'll,

34
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.310
I'll talk about it on the show.
Okay.
They just don't have a signed deal.
So,

35
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.180
but I'm just giving the heads up that it's a,
for them to emotionally,

36
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.980
emotionally prepare yourself,
that I got a job and,
um,
it's at Granger.

37

Oh Shit.

00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:09.880
but yeah,
and that's just how it goes gene.

40
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.530
<v 2>Well,
um,
I hope those people can handle it.
I hope they don't get too emotional,</v>

41
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.570
emotionally troubled by this kind of stuff.
Wow.

46
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.580
<v 3>My name is Tracy and you may have seen before,</v>

47
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.430
see men facial tutorial looking into natural remedies,

48
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.100
looking into the benefits,
digesting,
seaman,

49
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.420
scribbling notes.

50
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.940
<v 2>You knew how to write.
Okay.
Okay.
You know what's funny about these broads?</v>

51
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.440
I feel like there's every few cycles of life.
It's like,

52
00:04:15.441 --> 00:04:19.250
it's this thing where every now and then some fucking dumb bitch thinks that

53
00:04:19.251 --> 00:04:23.840
she's figured out that the semen cure,
right.
Look to her.

54
00:04:23.841 --> 00:04:26.790
I'll give her that.
She looks great but drop.

55
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.970
But every now and then it's like some stupid bitch gets cum on her face and

56
00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:33.500
she's like,
it's so sad.
I mean,

57
00:04:33.501 --> 00:04:36.530
if people have been doing the Siem and stuff for decades,

58
00:04:36.531 --> 00:04:37.860
they always think they're the first one.

59
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.590
Cause some guy shot a load on your tits and now you think it's medicinal.

60
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.463
Like come on.

61
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.210
<v 0>Why?
They think that they're the first one always.
You know,</v>

62
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.880
it does that.
It's kind of silly to me that they're like,

63
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.850
I did this.
I figured out the come thing first.

64
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.040
<v 2>Well,
I mean there's books written with the recipes,
natural harvest.</v>

65
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:04.780
We've covered that book in the early days of your mom's house.
Semen,
recipes,

66
00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:09.340
semen drinks.
We've invented calm.
Is he here already?

67
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.460
Do you want to get it
all right?
Oppressed?
Yeah.

68
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.520
Like I said too,
we've also built an industry on it,
a common GAM.

69
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.120
Remember that when we,
we wanted the middle,

70
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.090
<v 0>one of our favorite products that we took on shark tank and people didn't even</v>

71
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.940
see that episode.

72
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.330
Apparently it broke a lot of the broadcast guidelines,
but you know,
we,

73
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.870
we sat there with Mark Cuban and the lights go out and we were like,
you know,

74
00:05:36.871 --> 00:05:41.820
there's everyone likes gum or likes guys were about different flavored gum with

75
00:05:41.821 --> 00:05:45.060
different guys flavors in it.
And then he was like,
okay,

76
00:05:45.061 --> 00:05:47.820
like what about distribution?
And we've got kind of caught up there,
but

77
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.470
<v 2>well,
and also like the QVC lady really took a shine.
What's her name?
She's like,</v>

78
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.700
I can see this come,
come in every house in America.
Was that Laurie?

79
00:05:56.701 --> 00:06:00.110
Is that her name?
Yeah,
Lori.
She really liked it.
Yeah.
And they,

80
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.600
they all like the free samples we gave them.
They were all aligned on the,

81
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.620
what is it has to Chinese guy,
you know,
that's a black guy.

82
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:08.180
That's a Puerto Rican guy.

83
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.370
You need to have all their different genes in their mouth.

84
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:12.760
It was really exciting.
You know,

85
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.800
and I remember reading a vice article on this a decade ago,

86
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:20.540
whether or not the comm stuff it works as a moisturizer are actually has

87
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:25.460
nutritional value.
The answer's no,
no,
no.
And you know,

88
00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:28.830
it's,
it's a placebo thing.
These women think that they're,
you know,

89
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.880
doing something big.
Yeah.
Rehmann Jizz on their face or the first one.

90
00:06:33.881 --> 00:06:37.460
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's going to fluid bonding with Jessie

91
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.830
still my favorite.
Those ideas.

92
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.290
Jesus fucking all over my face.
Yeah.
Yeah.

93
00:06:49.291 --> 00:06:52.310
She's another one that's like,
I don't,
I'm empowering myself

94
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:59.090
on me.
I let him,
I wanted it.
It's so foul as so nasty,

95
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.390
but accidentally before.
Yeah,

96
00:07:02.391 --> 00:07:05.870
of course I laid on my back and shot it over over my head and had some,

97
00:07:05.871 --> 00:07:10.130
but like I'm telling you,
you got to move quick.
You're like,
I gotta get this off.

98
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.200
You don't find it to be medicinal or I didn't even think,

99
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.070
I just always think it's growth.
Of course.
Yeah.

100
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.100
I think my body fluids or gross,
like there's nothing I cherish.

101
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.360
I make so much of it that comes out.
Yeah.
Oh,
you do make a lot of loads.
I mean,

102
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:30.850
it doesn't bother me.
Like your staff does never bothers me,
but I don't,

103
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.430
I wouldn't want to like put it on my face or,
but some people do though.

104
00:07:34.431 --> 00:07:36.920
I understand that.
That's some people's kink.
Yeah.
You know,

105
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.820
maybe that's what this is being mistaken for.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

106
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.950
He loves this company.
So let's see what she has to say.
Here's her tits are nice.

107
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.550
<v 3>I've seen that</v>

108
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.200
many rules it to men

109
00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:00.150
<v 2>play this.
I think we played this before.
No,
not her.
I feel like we have,</v>

110
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:02.880
there's just,
I'm telling you,
these bitches,
they all think they're new.

111
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.210
This bitch looks familiar.
Yeah.
But I remember her stupid fucking what's her,
uh,

112
00:08:06.211 --> 00:08:10.440
her tattoo.
A cactus on her belly.
Look how stupid I would remember that.

113
00:08:10.441 --> 00:08:11.020
Stupid ass.

114
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.760
<v 3>Some things that you can do to improve the taste of semen.</v>

115
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.810
God Not Pineapple.
Yes.
We know

116
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:21.730
you're not the first one you bought.

117
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.740
<v 2>Yeah.
It's like she just started having sex so she's like,
oh my God.</v>

118
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.990
I think she just knows this is going to get views.
Right.
Cause she wore her.
Yeah.

119
00:08:30.991 --> 00:08:34.320
You wear that and she wears a tinny tiny youtube.
You know,

120
00:08:34.321 --> 00:08:36.210
you're going to get crazy click.
That's true.

121
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.620
We need to use this as the opening the trailer for this episode.
No.
Right.
Yeah.

122
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:45.200
<v 3>Diary throughout the day,
whether it's in the morning or last thing at night,</v>

123
00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:48.910
how hydrated you are,
the kind of diets and lifestyle that you haven't done.

124
00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:49.230
I like,

125
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:53.520
or if there is a dramatic difference in the taste and texture in receiving,

126
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.340
it could be an indication underlying health problems.

127
00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.040
No type of scene

128
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.570
<v 2>since this is um,
you know,
she seems like she's all on board with this.</v>

129
00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:09.250
I wonder if she'd try mine out,
you know,
do you want to mail her?

130
00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.350
She's obviously in Australia.

131
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.130
She Australian or nearly kill me.
Well,

132
00:09:15.131 --> 00:09:19.240
do you want to seal it in a jar and then send it across the world?

133
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.770
We try it out.
Try let's find your,

136
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.550
she uses your sperm to get impregnated nicely.
You know,
she's like,

137
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.850
well you know what I would do?
I would say I have to be there to,

138
00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.880
to spoon feed you.
You know,
I'll,
I'll spoonfeed you try it out.

139
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.240
So still back and tell her

140
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:50.683
<v 3>to be using.</v>

141
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.190
I am not involved in instruction at the scene and I'd just like to cling to
that.

142
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.130
It's fairly new.
I'm done.
I tapped out.

143
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.700
<v 2>We have done,
we played this and let's not play.
I don't want to see it anymore.</v>

144
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.050
And you don't because old school,
I used to only see the video and

145
00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:17.150
this is nasty.
They've got a little disappointed in blue band.

146
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:23.450
He would never,
not knowing our back catalog,
our entire 400 episodes of the show.

147
00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:27.160
But yeah,
we've played at Tom.
Look how little that just is.

148
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.330
You make so much more than that.
No,

149
00:10:29.331 --> 00:10:33.530
she would be like holding up like a jar and she'd be like swinging it around.

150
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:34.970
Big One of those mason jars.

151
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.650
Can you believe this is one guy who's called comedian Tom.

152
00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:45.410
His culture,
overseer,
new special.
Um,
anyways,

153
00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:49.300
we've been a,
I want to get to our topics before our guest shows up.
You know,

154
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.690
just catch people up on what's been happening.
Let's just see.

155
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.340
<v 3>Anyway,
throw up.
I don't want to watch to see if she,</v>

156
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.920
she or not.
No.
Ooh.
Ooh,

157
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.980
no shit.
Bitch.

158
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.460
<v 2>Are you talking about dummy stub it?</v>

159
00:11:08.461 --> 00:11:12.720
That's her friends ges and it's all cold and it's been sitting around.

160
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:17.160
Oh,
my eyes are watering,
right.
Nasty.
These hell bitch.

161
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.520
She's so fucking retarded for that.
Dammit.

162
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.210
I mean it's one thing to eat it fresh out of the oven,

163
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.970
but to have it sitting in a fucking Dixie cap dude.
Fucking foul man.

164
00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:37.150
<v 3>Kind of bitch.
No Shit,
dummy.
Okay,</v>

165
00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.250
I got it.
I did not.

166
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.100
<v 2>It's making me sick too.
It's so hard to listen to her.</v>

167
00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:47.650
It's not even somebody you fucking love.
You idiot for the health benefits.

168
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:53.410
Nothing else.
Just health.
Ah.
Anyway,
uh,

169
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.130
we've officially turned into our parents.
We started watching the Olympics,

170
00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.430
which I feel like is something your parents did remember,

171
00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:04.960
like back with five channels and that was like the biggest program of course.

172
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.370
And a,
you and I realized just how sexist we both were.

173
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:14.670
We were watching these snowboarders do all these crazy tracks are a hundred

174
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.670
years old.
First of all,
I was like,

175
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.970
I thought the Olympics were just a bunch of French guys skiing.

176
00:12:21.971 --> 00:12:26.590
How boring is that?
So I never watched it.
Now these fools are doing,
you know,

177
00:12:26.591 --> 00:12:29.470
halfpipe whatever that,
you know,
they look like they're skateboarding,

178
00:12:29.471 --> 00:12:34.030
but on snowboards and their chicks man,
and both of us are like,

179
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.940
we're a thousand years old that we didn't know that,
hey,

180
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:40.360
and that we're amazed that it's like 17 year old girls doing this.

181
00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:43.420
It was so awesome.
We were like,
these girls could do this.

182
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:51.310
I totally did too.
Like that's not a chick it natureraised farms.

183
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.950
Oh,
I felt so old and I like the Winter Olympics now.

184
00:12:56.951 --> 00:13:01.510
I had no idea how cool it is.
I just had it on in the background and you know,

185
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.220
and I was watching snowboarding stuff and I was like,
that guy's fucking crazy.

186
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.700
And then takes her helmet off and blowing and says,

187
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.250
I'm 16 and I'm in high school.

188
00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.050
I know she's well,
I'm a ball hog.

189
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:21.840
I'm Christine [inaudible] and I'm a Baha'i is super disrespectful.

190
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.940
Why doesn't the Olympics,
these are nice girl.

191
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.890
How could you say that about one of those girls?
They're all,

192
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.000
but they're all ball hogging Shaun white.

193
00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.390
He's like the hot shit and he's getting his nuts out.

194
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:41.530
I'm following him on Instagram and he's taken all the pics with all the cute

195
00:13:41.531 --> 00:13:45.400
blonde skier bitches and all that.
He's,
this is his last one probably,
right?

196
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.690
I mean,
yeah,
for something.
So he's got,
if I were him,

197
00:13:49.691 --> 00:13:52.750
I would just be like on a nut draining mission right now.
Of course,

198
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.910
you know what a fuckers for like six different countries.
I gotta go,

199
00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.830
I gotta do it.
I'm like,
he's just trying to close a deal with every country.

200
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.680
He's great,
great mission to accomplish.

201
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.130
And I think he should get a medal for that just for busting nuts and

202
00:14:06.131 --> 00:14:06.851
international.

203
00:14:06.851 --> 00:14:09.340
And that's the kind of thing I could see Trump inviting them to the White House

204
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:10.580
door call.
I'm like,

205
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.900
I heard you folks from every country I respect to show.

206
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:19.360
Yeah.
Thank you,
Mr. Yeah.
Yeah.
These fucking bitches are doing it,

207
00:14:19.361 --> 00:14:23.170
man on the snowboards.
I'm like,
um,
um,
you know what I'm saying?
No,

208
00:14:23.171 --> 00:14:26.530
it's incredible.
God Damn,
they're so good.
They're so good.

209
00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.800
God Damn it.
It's still so much every time.

210
00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.670
And we were watching,
they don't call it figure skating anymore.

211
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:41.250
It's called ice dancing.
I don't know when that fucking lame shit happened.

212
00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:46.320
That shit.
So we were watching this as a,
as it aired the Frenchies.

213
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:50.020
I thought the,
I thought the back broke it,
it just,
it's all good.
Nip slip though.

214
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.910
Not In the back did break because it was around her neck.

215
00:14:52.911 --> 00:14:55.850
So what happened was these Frenchies they were,

216
00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:00.970
they were ice dancing and her costume came down because it wasn't latched on

217
00:15:02.181 --> 00:15:05.030
properly around her neck.
And I guess her teddy popped it.

218
00:15:05.031 --> 00:15:08.930
I didn't even see that live,
but I have less Eugene.

219
00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:13.490
But I was thinking to myself,
she's gotta be so distracted by that man.

220
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.430
But they did a great skate despite that.
Do you think he's gets,

221
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:18.950
do you think he's gay?

222
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:23.450
Do you think any of these guys ice dancing on a straight straight,

223
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.710
I feel bad for it.
Or actually,
you know,
course work so hard.

224
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.960
How do you not have that shit?

225
00:15:29.961 --> 00:15:34.130
Like triple check that you're going to be in the Olympics and you're like,
Hey,

226
00:15:34.131 --> 00:15:37.690
uh,
I want to make sure my teddy doesn't pop out.
I'm telling you,

227
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.910
you know when you're performing at a high stakes thing like this,

228
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.260
you make sure everything is sewn onto you of course,

229
00:15:44.261 --> 00:15:45.680
that they should have sown that.

230
00:15:45.681 --> 00:15:49.310
I don't know why someone didn't really make sure.
Poor girl.

231
00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:53.230
And of course she's French so she's like,
ah,
manipulate.
Yeah,
of course.

232
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:57.200
She didn't even give a shit.
Probably Lillian,
this guy,
my beard,

233
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:04.490
I think he does some nice and easy.
It's real dark.
It's pretty dark,
really dark.

234
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.920
He's totally straight,
totally straight and the ass cheeks on these guys.

235
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:13.820
Oh my God,
look like little end tables.
Perfect.

236
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:18.490
These guys can go rest all your keys or wallet for days.

237
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.330
Everything on that ass.
Credible ice dancing.
Can we start ice dancing?

238
00:16:23.331 --> 00:16:28.310
You and I,
I would.
I wouldn't mind.
I would love.
Okay,
here's my proposal.

239
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:33.230
You,
Ari,
Joe Burt.
Next challenge.
Figure skating.
I'm sorry.

240
00:16:33.231 --> 00:16:34.064
Ice Dancing.

241
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:39.530
And I want all you guys to learn how to sow cow and twizzle.

242
00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:44.390
I want to see you guys and Leotards twizzler Lang.

243
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:49.430
Let's see,
what did they still end up placing or no?
I don't know.

244
00:16:49.431 --> 00:16:54.431
Moyer and what's start face a distracting kind of my worst nightmare.

245
00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:58.490
That's a poor girl,
man.
That's terrible.
This is what I could do.

246
00:16:58.491 --> 00:17:00.110
That they stayed relatively calm.

247
00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:05.270
That landed him in second blow of a right.
They got second after they skated.

248
00:17:05.271 --> 00:17:07.250
Did they maintain that's what I don't know.

249
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.520
Cause those Canadians really killed it.

250
00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:15.470
Maybe that is just to get into the placement thing.
Oh right.
Just to,
yeah,

251
00:17:15.471 --> 00:17:19.340
right to compete or whatever.
I don't know.
But they had those Canadians.

252
00:17:19.341 --> 00:17:23.220
They are really had a hard on for them.
They scored really high those till June.

253
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.410
I just saw this thing that popped up.
Well what's that?

254
00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:30.060
And then we watched that show sometimes where that couple flips houses.
Yeah,

255
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.120
they split.
I know.
I've been hearing that on us.
Christine Mussa.

256
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:39.110
No,
no,
no.
Not that.
The one that we make fun of.

257
00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:43.730
Chip and shut up.
Yeah.
We called that though.

258
00:17:43.731 --> 00:17:47.450
You and I called this because she has total contempt for him.

259
00:17:47.451 --> 00:17:51.520
Every time he fucking opens his mouth that show her eyes roll so far back into

260
00:17:51.521 --> 00:17:56.040
her head,
you can't even hide it.
He's always like,
do you love me?
Oh my God.

261
00:17:56.041 --> 00:18:00.100
He loves her so much.
He does.
Yeah.
No.

262
00:18:00.101 --> 00:18:03.190
And they have like five kids,
six or uppers.
The name of the show.

263
00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:07.690
Fuck yeah.
Knew it.
She hates him.

264
00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:13.980
The feeling that she has already conquered than a fixer upper children together.

265
00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.990
What did a lot of kids?
Yeah.

266
00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:22.670
I mean he adores her,
but you can tell.
So I know he,

267
00:18:22.671 --> 00:18:26.260
she fucking hates him because every time he tries to be funny and cute on the

268
00:18:26.261 --> 00:18:27.094
show,

269
00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:31.270
like he acts like a little boy and you can see she the contempt and her,

270
00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.850
she hates his sense of humor and hates it.

271
00:18:33.851 --> 00:18:36.730
He's childish and stuff cause he'll like,
you know,

272
00:18:36.731 --> 00:18:41.130
throw a hammer through a wall and be like,
ah.
And just she see that,
I don't,

273
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.350
I'm not understanding this.
This just says they're pregnant to ah,

274
00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:49.150
what are they quitting the show or quitting the time?
The show.
Oh God.

275
00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:52.390
Well now I know,
but I'm,
I mean,
I'm reading the thing that it says here.

276
00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.740
Who knows what this fucking means?
Yeah.
This is like a,

277
00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:01.310
God damn.
How many kids is that Nem?
The Ham,
like their fifth child,

278
00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:05.440
the they need to stop any more than four is a cult.
That's not okay.
Yeah,

279
00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:08.660
so they're not splitting.
She's,
she doesn't want to do the show anymore.
Oh,

280
00:19:08.661 --> 00:19:10.910
shut up.
You know what?
I hate people like that.

281
00:19:10.911 --> 00:19:14.690
Like you've got your fucking gravy train.
Make your money,
bitch.

282
00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.040
Do the show until they stopped paying you.
All right.
Am I right?

283
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:22.820
You're lucky that you're on a show that they must make a good living now.

284
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:27.170
Fuck you.
Okay.
Walk away from it.
You dumb dumb.
That's stupidity.

285
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:29.030
That's so stupid.

286
00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.510
Do the show until the fucking no one wants to see you doing that stupid show.

287
00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:33.693
Right,
man,

288
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:37.400
we're going to do this show until no one wants to listen to us talk about

289
00:19:37.401 --> 00:19:41.340
farting.
It's not just about farting hate.
When people say that.

290
00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.380
Speaking of you and I had a very in depth discussion the other day at the

291
00:19:47.381 --> 00:19:52.381
breakfast table over which body functions you and I prefer the most.

292
00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:57.850
Right?
Because you actually really enjoy your body functions.

293
00:19:57.851 --> 00:20:00.670
You're sneezing things.
Every time you sneezed you're like,
ah,

294
00:20:00.671 --> 00:20:05.100
such a good sneeze tight.
Yeah.
Every time you fart and you're like,
oh,

295
00:20:05.101 --> 00:20:09.400
it was a good farther was a kitchen and I don't enjoy them as much as you do.

296
00:20:09.401 --> 00:20:12.730
I don't really,
to me it's just relief of suffering.
Like when I take a shit,

297
00:20:12.731 --> 00:20:16.210
it's just,
it's only really isn't relief of suffering.
Enjoyment.
No,

298
00:20:16.211 --> 00:20:20.710
it's relief and joy are two different feelings.
For me,
relief is like,
Oh God,

299
00:20:20.711 --> 00:20:24.940
I'm not hurting anymore.
That can be a joyful experience to feel the relief.

300
00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.160
Oh my God.

301
00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:34.180
Oh God,
it feels so good.
He liked that.
So what's your,

302
00:20:34.181 --> 00:20:35.990
let's rank your body functions.
I don't know.

303
00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:40.200
Cause sometimes I feel like after I sneeze I feel like I just just right.

304
00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.970
You love,
you get that head rush ahead.

305
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:47.020
I I could almost go to sleep right after a good sneeze.
Now,
sometimes I,

306
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.590
<v 0>and I think it's associated with,
um,</v>

307
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:55.900
maybe a food reaction and it'll,
I'll sneeze sneeze.
It feels all right,

308
00:20:55.901 --> 00:20:59.860
but it really fuck up my,
my,
uh,
breathing.
In other words,

309
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:04.690
I feel like it irritated air passage,
you know,

310
00:21:04.691 --> 00:21:07.330
so it's like air gets trapped.
Then I'm like,
ah,

311
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:12.100
it's just not as their different style sneezes.
But if it's a pure sneeze,

312
00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:17.380
sunlight induced sneeze,
you know,
walk outside and boom,
boom,
boom.

313
00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:20.590
And I get a few going.
I really relish that feeling.
I enjoy it.

314
00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:24.170
<v 2>Yeah.
That's interesting.
You and I are vastly different</v>

315
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:28.890
<v 0>when it sit there in the sun and kind of let it sit.
You know,</v>

316
00:21:28.891 --> 00:21:33.060
I really want to,
I mean I feel like it's like almost orgasmic.

317
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:35.780
<v 2>I feel like body functions are just,
um,</v>

318
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.370
an unwelcome interruption into whatever I'm doing.

319
00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.210
Like the body is a hindrance to everything I want to be doing.

320
00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:47.220
You're cleansing with a Q tip.
I like that.
I love cleaning my ears.

321
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:48.850
Burps sometimes.
See,

322
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.850
I was going to say now you're not like you're already on board again.
Well the,

323
00:21:51.851 --> 00:21:54.870
the thing is I like Burks.
I feel like burps are fun.

324
00:21:55.230 --> 00:22:00.090
They create joy for other people.
You can compete,

325
00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:04.530
you can challenge yourself and get good at them.
You know what I mean?

326
00:22:04.531 --> 00:22:09.130
Like I like those.
Yeah.
But everything else about my body,

327
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.760
just an inconvenience.
You never enjoyed the feeling of a sneeze?

328
00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:15.630
I don't enjoy it now I get,
I get scared because I'm losing control.

329
00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.960
I don't like it.
I don't like that after kind of buzz from a sneeze,
you know?

330
00:22:18.961 --> 00:22:22.060
Talking about no.
Know what I'm saying?
No,
really.

331
00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:25.380
I don't relish my body functions to know you ask you if you don't relish.

332
00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:26.520
I'm saying,
do you ever get,

333
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:31.500
have a sneeze when you feel kind of light headed after a sneeze?
No,
never.
I mean,

334
00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.270
I don't think so.
I don't,
I don't notice it.
I don't care.

335
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.410
That's the thing.
I'm not paying attention.
Okay.

336
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:43.140
I'm just asking you if like you have the same experience.
I don't.

337
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.530
I'm telling you that I just get through it so that I can get onto the next
thing.

338
00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.980
Like I'm not even thinking about how that sneeze,

339
00:22:49.981 --> 00:22:54.720
just inconvenience it took second out of my life.
I am no fun.

340
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:58.320
I have no joy.
Uh,
just things like that.
I don't care.

341
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:03.710
You're always doing that.
I like farting.
I like burning Burbank.
Okay.

342
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:07.920
So you enjoy a couple of bobcats?
They're loud and they interrupt things.

343
00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:11.280
Okay.
Yeah.
I mean,
you're making it sound like you're like,

344
00:23:11.281 --> 00:23:14.280
I'm not on board with any of this.
And then two minutes later you're like,

345
00:23:14.281 --> 00:23:18.780
I'm actually pretty into these two things.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
No,
I mean,

346
00:23:18.781 --> 00:23:21.990
I guess,
I guess what you and I have different,
I don't know.

347
00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:24.650
You're saying that you think that I enjoy them more.
Yeah.

348
00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:29.660
I feel like you really savor a sneeze or you savor the shit and I just don't.

349
00:23:30.781 --> 00:23:31.561
I,
to me,

350
00:23:31.561 --> 00:23:34.440
those are two things that I just want to get over with so that I can move on to

351
00:23:34.441 --> 00:23:38.760
the next,
but a burp is kind of welcome to because it's fun.

352
00:23:38.761 --> 00:23:41.840
Everyone's going to like it.
I don't know if everyone's gonna like,

353
00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:46.610
it's gonna make my,
you know,
it'll upset my mom.
Those kinds of thoughts.

354
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.530
It's a good feelings.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey,

355
00:23:51.531 --> 00:23:56.180
same strokes for everybody.
Tom.
Everyone's the same.
It's the same for,

356
00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:02.240
um,
okay.
I have to say that I do enjoy pretty much all of them.

357
00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.310
Yeah.
I also enjoy like a nice long post,
you know?
Yeah.

358
00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.040
It's relief associated to those,
but that's the difference for me.

359
00:24:10.041 --> 00:24:13.130
I think the Relief Association,
cause I'm in,

360
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:17.330
you're in torture and then I don't find relief to be the same as the joy of a

361
00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:20.960
burp.
A burp is,
there's a,
you know,
it's just fun.

362
00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:25.220
It's frivolous.
Yeah.
Just like a fart.
A fire.
It's just,

363
00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:29.890
it's just there to say hi.
You have,
I mean it's okay how you're fart.

364
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:32.400
Oh yeah.
Say Hi.

365
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.200
<v 1>Okay.
That's fine.
Okay.</v>

366
00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.960
<v 2>There you go.
There it is.</v>

367
00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.610
I'm just thinking about it,
you know,

368
00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.950
I feel like I enjoy all the bodily functions.
You tail well,

369
00:24:50.951 --> 00:24:53.380
enjoy picking my nose.
I do like picking why now?

370
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.240
Now you're at another one that you're in today.

371
00:24:55.241 --> 00:24:58.840
Is that a body function or it's something gross you do?
It's kind of,

372
00:24:58.841 --> 00:25:02.200
it was kind of unnecessary at times.
I like some hygiene things.

373
00:25:02.201 --> 00:25:06.260
I do like cleaning my ears and I do like picking my nose a lot.
Yeah.

374
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:12.730
Yeah.
Well,
I like talking and burping.
Do you also like it?

375
00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:17.710
You don't realize how much in on the same thing you really are.

376
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:19.380
I know.
I just feel like you,

377
00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:22.930
but I'm saying that your level of enjoyment is higher than my expressing joy.

378
00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:27.340
Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't see,
I think you still enjoy it.

379
00:25:27.341 --> 00:25:31.240
You just don't express it.
Yeah,
but I don't feel a lot of things.
We know this.

380
00:25:31.241 --> 00:25:36.130
This is why we're comedians not,
and don't you feel are take joy.

381
00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:40.030
Joy is a feeling.
I'm not comfortable with feelings.
You know that.

382
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:45.400
I've been in therapy for 10 years.
Okay,
so we're going to happen.
I don't,

383
00:25:45.401 --> 00:25:48.610
I don't have the same sensitivity to things.
Whoa.

384
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.390
This is so off the showing a feeling you're saying?

385
00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:57.940
No,
I just said expressing.
I didn't say,
Oh yeah,
no,
you enjoy it.

386
00:25:57.941 --> 00:26:01.150
You're just not expressing it.
I guess you were expressing it.
Now you're like,

387
00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.000
I do like it.
So you do enjoy it.

388
00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:08.850
You just don't express it as much in the moment.
I guess,
but I don't,

389
00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:13.900
I don't enjoy,
I don't enjoy sneezing.

390
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:17.710
Okay.
We press pause,
pause,

391
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:22.180
and now we're back.
Oh,
it's blocking you.

392
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:25.800
There you go.
You got to see my tits,
tits

393
00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:33.210
and our guests.
Johnny Pemberton is here.
Thank you.
Pepper.

Sorry.

394
00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:37.960
Johnny pepper is here.
Come all over my face.

395
00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.110
That's how I feel now that I said it wrong.
Actually.
Pemberton.
You're right.

396
00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:44.010
Got David.
So fucking with me man.

The Greater,

399
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:57.040
Minneapolis area.
Now I'm from Rochester.
It's like a,
it's like a medium size.

400
00:26:57.041 --> 00:27:00.750
I already know about the Mayo Clinic.
You fucking show off.
There you go.

401
00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:04.170
That's it.
That's all.
We've got some male clinic.
You have premium healthcare.

402
00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.050
I mean it's not premium.
It's above premium.
It's like diamond.

403
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:11.220
I'm in the diamond diamond,
diamond platinum.
Did you ever go just to be like,
hey,

404
00:27:11.221 --> 00:27:15.640
I got a cold.
You can't see.
They could do.
My Dad was a doctor,
so yeah,

405
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:19.110
he's a,
sorry.
He still works there.
He still works there.
Yeah.
After Pemberton.

406
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:23.740
Doctor Pemberton,
bad growing up with a dad doctor.
I Dunno.

407
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.890
I think it's kind of depends.
My Dad was a surgeon,

408
00:27:25.891 --> 00:27:29.910
so surgeons are basically completely not helpful for anything at all.

409
00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:33.810
Like if I ask,
if I say something like I have a Coleman that's like,
I don't know,

410
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:38.610
I'm just,
I take this try.
It just nothing is no,

411
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.960
unless than less.
It can be fixed with a knife.
It's something you can't fake.

412
00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:47.720
What is his specialty?
He's a colon rectal surgeon.
Get the fuck out of here.

413
00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:51.180
Yeah.
Uh,
yeah.
That's what he says to this shit.

414
00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:56.880
So he does a lot of um,
making you,
uh,

415
00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.580
your,
you know,
your shit come through your side,
whatever it is.
Well,

416
00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:02.640
he does all that stuff.
Yeah.

417
00:28:02.641 --> 00:28:07.320
Well he like put me installing a stoma or like an illegal anal anastomosis.

418
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:11.650
Shit.
Shit is right.
I read,
um,

419
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:16.440
this book about sociopath's and said there was a,
it's a cool segue.

420
00:28:16.441 --> 00:28:18.870
I want to say this is going disproportionate.
Um,

421
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:24.090
higher number of surgeons have,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

422
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:26.700
I guess I can see that.
Not that obviously that all are,

423
00:28:26.701 --> 00:28:31.170
but just like some of the guys were like kind of a good job for associate path

424
00:28:31.171 --> 00:28:36.070
cause you can kind of totally emotionally he died and so we went to lunch.

425
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:39.570
Well maybe it makes you a sociopath because you have to be that way because if

426
00:28:39.571 --> 00:28:43.320
you don't,
if you have like an attachment to your patients and you're a surgeon,

427
00:28:43.321 --> 00:28:47.020
it's like you wouldn't be able to handle that shit.
Yeah,
that's true.
Oh Dude.

428
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:50.730
Weeping all the tall.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know how,
I mean,

429
00:28:50.731 --> 00:28:55.050
I don't know how they do it,
period.
Whether or not they're sociopath's.
Um,

430
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:56.730
they've gotten,
it's gotten hard.

431
00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.780
I've seen an operation once and it was something where it was before it was back

432
00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:04.380
when they still allowed that like allowed family to watch an operation.

433
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:07.560
Now they don't allow that shit anymore.
It's like,
it's really locked down.

434
00:29:07.561 --> 00:29:12.150
Like very,
um,
it's a lot of administration there,
but when you see it,

435
00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.840
it doesn't seem gross at all.

436
00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:17.280
There's like a real disconnect between if you watch someone getting,

437
00:29:17.281 --> 00:29:20.640
having surgery at home on TV,
it's 10 times more gross.

438
00:29:20.641 --> 00:29:23.340
And makes you more squeamish than if you were just there because you were there.

439
00:29:23.341 --> 00:29:25.110
It's kind of like,
it's normal.

440
00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:29.160
I went and watched a bunch of surgeries one day at the Mayo Clinic in

441
00:29:29.161 --> 00:29:31.350
Jacksonville.
He's serious.
Yeah.
Because why?

442
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:35.130
My uncle worked at the Mayo clinic in Rochester.
He did what's his last name?

443
00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:40.560
Okay.
And um,
he,
uh,
so I told,

444
00:29:40.561 --> 00:29:41.800
I had the bright idea

445
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.870
<v 0>that I wanted to be a doctor when I was like,
before the band.</v>

446
00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:50.920
Yeah.
Yeah.
This is pretty bad.
Pretty bad.
So this is like,
you know,

447
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:54.130
I was an eighth grade,
ninth grade and I'm like,
I want to be a doctor.

448
00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:57.420
So I call my,
I tell my dad,

449
00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:01.510
my dad calls his brother and he arranges for me to go to the Mayo Clinic in

450
00:30:01.511 --> 00:30:04.600
Jacksonville,
which is like,
you know,
the sister

451
00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:09.290
<v 4>been there.
Yeah.
I've had my,
I've had my ass looked at there.
Yeah.</v>

452
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.910
You're the son of the colon surgeons.
Highly Ironic.
I had,

453
00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:17.990
I actually had a had colitis.
Oh Wow.
Yeah,
I know I,

454
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:21.880
my colon removed too,
so.
Yeah,
I know it's nuts.

455
00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:25.040
That was a long time when I was about 17,
maybe 17 years ago or so.

456
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:29.510
That sounds so rare,
right?
Yeah.
It's super rare and weird,

457
00:30:29.511 --> 00:30:32.990
but it's also just,
um,
I dunno.
Yeah,
irony.

458
00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:35.630
The irony is incredible.
It's really deep.

459
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:38.480
We had like a friend do it basically.

460
00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:41.780
It was weird because I knew everyone has done in his department,
right?
Like,

461
00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:46.430
cause we grew up together and like had the uh,
the cnrs picnic,

462
00:30:46.431 --> 00:30:49.950
which stands for colon rectal surgery picnic that you never put on a sign

463
00:30:49.951 --> 00:30:54.500
because no one wants to go to the colon rectal surgery picnic.
Yeah.
So yeah,

464
00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.570
I knew all of his friends are fine.
Uh,
I guess so.
I mean I was,

465
00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.020
I was sick for a long time though,

466
00:31:00.021 --> 00:31:03.710
so it wasn't like something where it was more like a relief kind of thing.

467
00:31:03.711 --> 00:31:07.160
And Yeah,
I dunno.
Some about surgery,
it's so overwhelming that

468
00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.050
<v 0>is it like would he,</v>

469
00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:12.830
because he's so knowledgeable in that particular field,

470
00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:16.400
was it like more comforting that he's like telling you the ins and outs of

471
00:31:16.401 --> 00:31:19.910
what's going to happen as far as the surgery went?
Like how it's going to go.

472
00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.940
Like cause I mean he obviously is really well versed but most dads be like,

473
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:25.750
it's all right buddy,
you know,
kind of my hair.
I'm

474
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:26.560
<v 4>trying to think.
I don't want it.</v>

475
00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:31.390
Don't remember it that well in terms of that stuff.
I think a,
he said some stuff,

476
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.340
I don't even fucking know you have a,
when you want the full download.
Okay.
Okay.

477
00:31:36.341 --> 00:31:37.780
What happens is you have,

478
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:41.920
well from my case at least they were able to do something where they basically

479
00:31:41.921 --> 00:31:46.510
reroute it back through your asshole again.
But,
but there's two surgeries.

480
00:31:46.511 --> 00:31:50.230
The first surgery they take the colon out and they establish um,

481
00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:52.290
you have like a stoma,
you have like a,
you know,

482
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:56.650
you poop out of your abdomen because everything has to heal up.

483
00:31:56.651 --> 00:32:00.180
What they do is they take the ending of your small intestine and it makes them,

484
00:32:00.181 --> 00:32:02.290
he called the j pouch cause it's the shape of a j.

485
00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.980
And that is your new sort of like rectum,
like your rectum.

486
00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.870
Everyone thinks rectum is actually your anus.

487
00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:13.270
Rectum is technically like sort of like the the loading dock to the last part of

488
00:32:13.271 --> 00:32:16.720
the colon.
So they basically make that out of the ending of your small intestine.

489
00:32:16.721 --> 00:32:19.630
But as it heals up that they can't have shit that going through it.

490
00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:21.280
So there you have the bag.

491
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:24.910
I had a colostomy bag for maybe about 10 weeks or saw my God.

492
00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:28.510
Yeah and it sucks but it's also one of the things where there's people who have

493
00:32:28.511 --> 00:32:31.600
their entire life.
Half of that thing I just had temporarily.

494
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.580
And I assume then that you go back in for a second.
Yeah,

495
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:38.080
the second was not as bad and they reconnect everything and then you know when

496
00:32:38.081 --> 00:32:41.600
you wake up they're like once your bowels wake up cause your bowels will go to

497
00:32:41.601 --> 00:32:46.160
sleep if they could touched it sounds so weird.
Maybe touch your bows.

498
00:32:46.161 --> 00:32:50.630
Like if you were somehow to able to go inside your abdomen and touch your
bowels,

499
00:32:50.631 --> 00:32:53.900
they just go,
they just stop.
They stop working for like 24 hours.
That's like a,

500
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:57.440
it's like a defense mechanism against in case you get like a bowel perforation

501
00:32:57.441 --> 00:33:01.430
or something like that.
Wow.
Isn't that fascinating?
So you don't shit for a while.

502
00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:06.770
So.
So does your asshole go dormant when it's like not my asshole.

503
00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:11.120
Yeah.
Or like anyone's who has the rerouting.
In other words it's like,
well no,

504
00:33:11.121 --> 00:33:14.000
I mean I don't have,
I mean it's,
it's fully functional now.
No,

505
00:33:14.001 --> 00:33:17.900
I'm saying when this window,
yeah.
So it's like there's no use to it.

506
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:20.960
Well Mucus still comes out so he's still like shit.

507
00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.060
Every once in a while you're like,
what's that feeling?
You have to shit.

508
00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:25.520
And it feels really weird.
The first time I do it it's just like,

509
00:33:25.521 --> 00:33:29.510
cause your body produces fluids in any sort of negative space and you've got to

510
00:33:29.511 --> 00:33:32.390
get them out so you,
you shit out like some mucus.

511
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:39.050
So fascinated in like so uncomfortable.
It's a weird thing.
It's terrible.

512
00:33:39.051 --> 00:33:43.640
Like the classmate bag is one of those things that is a,
it's the worst thing,

513
00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:47.690
but it's also kind of deeply fascinating cause it's so fucking bad.

514
00:33:47.691 --> 00:33:51.870
It's so terrible.
It's like this thing where like I had,
um,
there,

515
00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:54.860
the crazy thing about classmate bag is that the waste that comes out,

516
00:33:55.310 --> 00:34:00.000
it's not like regular shit.
Why wait?
It's worse.
Like,

517
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:04.940
Oh,
I'm going to shit.
And then it goes out of the colostomy bag.
It's all,

518
00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:07.580
it's like who's there?
You're like a little,

519
00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:10.190
sometimes you're like a little gurgling or maybe nothing at all.

520
00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:13.670
But either way it's kind of,
um,
wait,
what does it look like again?

521
00:34:13.671 --> 00:34:16.680
So you're saying it,
what does it look like?
It's not regular shit.
You said it's,

522
00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:19.670
Oh,
well,
it's sort of like,
um,
I,

523
00:34:19.671 --> 00:34:24.020
I always liken it to if you went to a sausage factory in inner and walked in

524
00:34:24.021 --> 00:34:26.720
when before they were finished making it,
it's like this is,

525
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:30.290
this is the worst part.
It's worse than the,
what they start with.

526
00:34:30.291 --> 00:34:32.200
And it's obviously worse than the ending because it's really,

527
00:34:32.201 --> 00:34:36.560
you're like interrupting a natural process and so it's like,
we're not done yet.

528
00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:40.580
It's fucking terrible.
It's like,
yeah,
I mean,
uh,

529
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:43.310
it's something where if you could,

530
00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.800
if you could bottle that you could clear out,

531
00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:49.040
you could clear a space out pretty quickly.
She goes,
you would probably,

532
00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:51.770
you should brought on an airplane.
It would,
they have to land,
you would have to,

533
00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:55.220
I feel like maybe,
maybe,
well yeah cause they just did it this week.

534
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:57.850
Somebody was farting and they look away.
He's serious.

535
00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:00.980
They landed a plane cause someone's foreign.
When he refused to stop,

536
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:03.080
it wasn't about the farting stop farting.

537
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:07.970
Well he was asked to stop or other passengers and then a fight broke out over it

538
00:35:07.971 --> 00:35:10.520
and then they landed the plane.
Oh,
so it's the fight.
It was the fight.

539
00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:14.210
It was the part that broke the window.
They literally broke the,

540
00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:19.160
it was pretty bad.
Yeah.
It was a pretty bad for us with the reports.
Wait,

541
00:35:19.161 --> 00:35:23.240
so I was,
I was telling you though,
and saw surgeries I witnessed,

542
00:35:23.241 --> 00:35:26.030
like you saw surgeries,
I saw many surgeries,

543
00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:30.540
how many surgeries and I saw they were all in the um,
um,

544
00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:36.400
urinary tract.
Okay.
Come on.
So I,

545
00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:38.250
I basically had a,

546
00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:39.930
<v 0>I watch like this,</v>

547
00:35:39.931 --> 00:35:44.931
the first one was this 87 year old woman that had a cyst the size of a golf

548
00:35:45.031 --> 00:35:49.610
ball.
Oh,
that's not very big.
Really?
No,
no,
no.
Sorry.
Softball.
Softball.
Okay.

549
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:53.650
There you go.
Now.
And then they were like,
this is a record setter.
What brought,

550
00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:57.420
brought in cameras and then the guide,
the surgeon was like,
hey,
just don't,

551
00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:01.080
don't say anything to her.
And they'll be like,
oh,

552
00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:06.000
you're a pussy is gross if she's awake.
And I was like,
oh,
okay.
Oh,
she's awake.

553
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:10.840
Yeah.
That's weird.
Yeah,
she was awake.
Yeah.
It was gnarly.

554
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:13.850
And then I kept,
you know,
went to the next one,
the next one,
the next day.

555
00:36:13.851 --> 00:36:17.040
It was a full day of it.
And Damn.
I was like,
I don't,
I don't know man.

556
00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.860
I don't know if I could do this.
Actually.
Yeah,
it would be hard.
I think

557
00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:24.860
<v 5>I wouldn't let that happen if I were awake and some punk ass kids were in there</v>

558
00:36:24.861 --> 00:36:28.790
as my pussy was getting operated on.
But it's a teaching hospital.
They ask you,

559
00:36:28.791 --> 00:36:33.200
they're like,
hey,
so we want,
we're so good because we let people,

560
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:37.580
we got to watch.
And so will you let him watch so he can be good?
Absolutely not.

561
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:41.950
Go Fuck Yourself.
I guess if for a pussy surge,
I would say no.
Yeah,
yeah.

562
00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:45.980
It's bad enough when you give birth.
And I was pushing my son out,
uh,

563
00:36:45.981 --> 00:36:47.990
Ellis and they had a shift change.

564
00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:52.520
So like for nurses changed as I was pushing out my son,

565
00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:56.510
nothing related to eight people get to see my posts right now.
Blasted.

566
00:36:56.930 --> 00:37:01.170
<v 0>So,
but can I ask you,
since these,
these many years that this has happened,
um,</v>

567
00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:02.360
everything is cool now.

568
00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.970
<v 4>I mean,
it's never,
it's never going to be like,
it's cool.</v>

569
00:37:05.971 --> 00:37:09.840
It's like a dude who takes a big dump once a day kind of thing.

570
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:13.860
I always think of like some old dude who's really sweaty and a golf course,

571
00:37:13.861 --> 00:37:16.110
you know,
I gotta go take a dig boys.

572
00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:20.640
It takes like some giant fucking ropey thing that has been sitting in there for

573
00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:24.990
a week after a steakhouse visit.
Yeah,
yeah.
No,
I'll never have that.

574
00:37:24.991 --> 00:37:28.740
But I guess watch what you eat.
Yeah.
I kinda like religiously do it,
but it's not,

575
00:37:28.741 --> 00:37:29.780
I don't think about it.
I'm just,

576
00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:34.680
<v 5>I know.
Yeah.
What can't you eat?
Things that are bad.
I mean I'm,</v>

577
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:39.860
<v 4>anything that's greasy or,
uh,
I mean for me,</v>

578
00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:44.270
my favorite thing that I love buffalo wings.
Yeah.
But when I eat them,

579
00:37:44.271 --> 00:37:48.050
it's like this thing where I'm either hurting myself because I'd done something

580
00:37:48.051 --> 00:37:51.170
wrong.
I need to be punished or I'm like,
okay,

581
00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.320
so I know there's going to be held to pay for this,

582
00:37:54.321 --> 00:37:56.660
but it's going to taste really good right now.

583
00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:01.370
But 10 hours from now I'm going to wake up and I'm going to be having extreme

584
00:38:01.371 --> 00:38:04.240
hot exits at 4:00 AM where it's like,
yeah,

585
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:07.580
it's going to hurt because it's like what happens is I think w with the spice,

586
00:38:07.581 --> 00:38:11.750
a lot of times the spices get broken down.
The longer your intestines are.

587
00:38:11.751 --> 00:38:14.130
So mine are shorter,
so don't get a chance to get it

588
00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:15.021
<v 5>broken as much.</v>

589
00:38:15.021 --> 00:38:20.010
So when they still got their fucking swords when it's so hot.
Yeah.

590
00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:24.770
Cause you need that real estate to really work to mellow with the nutrition out

591
00:38:24.771 --> 00:38:26.060
of your poops.
Yeah.

592
00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:31.380
<v 0>Tony,
what are the disadvantages of looking attorney 16?</v>

593
00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.233
Like give us,

594
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.071
<v 4>well,</v>

595
00:38:33.071 --> 00:38:38.071
I'd say advantages is I'm having people talk down to you constantly having

596
00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:43.780
consistent customer service problems because you're treated like a child and a

597
00:38:43.781 --> 00:38:46.780
first timer on for anything you possibly do,

598
00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:51.850
even though you're older than the person you guaranteed.
Um,
basically that,

599
00:38:51.851 --> 00:38:55.570
I would say that that's where the upside is just consistently being treated as

600
00:38:55.571 --> 00:39:00.490
though you have a,
it's your first day on earth.
Sort of like,
you know,
that's a,

601
00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:06.100
I never thought of that young man.
Why don't you relax and you're like,
I'm like,

602
00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:08.380
Gosh,
that,

603
00:39:08.381 --> 00:39:11.440
but there are sometimes it is good because I feel like people won't be,

604
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:15.480
won't be mean to me.
Oh yeah.
Like I can get away with a lot of,

605
00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.810
I can get with a lot of shit.
I go,

606
00:39:16.811 --> 00:39:20.470
well you know I can get away with is being an Ada so I can,
I can plead,

607
00:39:20.471 --> 00:39:24.550
I'm like if I'm at an airport,
a lot of times I will uh,

608
00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:29.020
steal a bottle of water because I don't want to pay for a bottle of water.

609
00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:32.440
Cause I feel like,
cause it's like a multinational corporation selling it.

610
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.500
They're not losing anything from where do you steal it from?
It depends.

611
00:39:35.501 --> 00:39:37.230
Like if you're in line at Starbucks or something like that,

612
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:42.400
just grab it and just hold it.
And if you,
if you pretend it's yours,
it's yours.

613
00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.870
What I mean and so,
and let's just say I were to take like 15,

614
00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:50.260
15 bottles of water.
Yeah.
And walk away.
And someone,

615
00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:53.380
someone were to actually say,
excuse me sir,

616
00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:58.650
Sir ag would just turn around and go,
Oh,
oh I'm sorry I didn't,
I didn't really,

617
00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.810
I didn't pay for these.
I'm sorry,
I'm so confused.
I'm just really tired.

618
00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:05.320
I didn't think there would be nothing.
What happened?
Yeah.

619
00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:09.800
Cause I just sort of just lying can just turn around and just look wide.

620
00:40:09.801 --> 00:40:14.230
I just feel like what,
what?
Oh,
these are,
oh,

621
00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.980
I thought these were mine.
My Dad get these.
They're like,
oh,
it's okay.
It's okay.

622
00:40:17.981 --> 00:40:21.310
It's okay sometimes,
but I don't you do that,

623
00:40:21.311 --> 00:40:24.250
that author and cause it's Kinda like a weird thing where it's like that whole

624
00:40:24.251 --> 00:40:29.251
abyss stares back sort of thing where I feel like anytime you live in something

625
00:40:29.621 --> 00:40:33.730
that's certain way,
like if you're an actor and you add play a character,

626
00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.190
you can say it's a character all you want,

627
00:40:36.191 --> 00:40:41.140
but it's going to become your life come part of your life.
So it's,
um,

628
00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:46.360
it's,
it's gotta be an advantage and disadvantage at times with your acting too.

629
00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.980
Yeah,
it's both,
I guess.
Probably because of it.
Right.

630
00:40:49.981 --> 00:40:53.500
And you're going to be not considered because of it,
I guess.
I mean,

631
00:40:53.501 --> 00:40:56.800
I don't only play a,
I mean you said 16.
I don't play the 16.

632
00:40:57.850 --> 00:41:00.240
I know you're exaggerating.
You're a comedian,
right?
Sometimes I,
yeah,

633
00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:05.020
and I exaggerate and indulge really,
you,
I mean,
every,

634
00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:09.100
that's weird.
I mean,
I just take everything I hear at face value.
I,
it's weird.

635
00:41:09.101 --> 00:41:12.230
I assume that everything everyone says,
it's like,
oh,
they mean that completely.

636
00:41:12.231 --> 00:41:16.900
100% there's no such thing as satire or like hyperbole.
No,
it doesn't exist.

637
00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:22.050
No irony.
Sarcasm doesn't exist.
No.
Yup,

638
00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:25.060
that's good.
It sounds like you're,
you get it man.
I'm just,

639
00:41:25.061 --> 00:41:27.430
you know what I see is what I believe and that's,

640
00:41:27.431 --> 00:41:30.580
I'm just now papers.
Jean,

641
00:41:30.581 --> 00:41:34.310
did you know that a new case has been brought to our attention

642
00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:36.200
<v 0>of foreign accents?</v>

643
00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:42.920
<v 5>I hide the,
my voice in the conversation for nearly four year now.</v>

644
00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:46.380
<v 0>This was sent to a,
that's the original that became oh,</v>

645
00:41:46.381 --> 00:41:48.410
so popular on this show.
Yeah.

646
00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:52.820
And then I actually did a bit about it on my latest Netflix special.

647
00:41:52.821 --> 00:41:56.570
I talked about foreign accent syndrome and because of that I started getting a

648
00:41:56.571 --> 00:41:58.670
lot of messages from people about it.

649
00:41:58.671 --> 00:42:01.340
And then it was in the news last week and it was send it to us.
Many.
Yeah.

650
00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.880
<v 5>Very exciting.
Now Johnny,
are you familiar with that?</v>

651
00:42:03.881 --> 00:42:07.510
I am familiar with this and I still can't believe it's a real thing.

652
00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:12.190
I feel like it's gotta be some sort of a brain trauma or something.
Yeah.

653
00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:15.590
I can't believe she's dressed like Minnie mouse.
Look at her.
Yeah,
that's perfect.

654
00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.900
Everyone only sees um,
or,
oh,
he,
Mary Poppins,

655
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.900
<v 6>not a British nanny.
This former Texas beauty,</v>

656
00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:27.520
the USA who would do this for attention?
I don't know,
three times.

657
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:30.350
Michelle Myers has gone to sleep with blinding headaches,

658
00:42:30.351 --> 00:42:32.510
waking up with different accents.
Irish,

659
00:42:32.511 --> 00:42:35.720
Australian and British for the past couple of years.

660
00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:39.110
<v 5>They send in the psychiatrist at the hospital,
you know,</v>

661
00:42:39.111 --> 00:42:40.820
they make sure you're not alone.

662
00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:45.400
<v 6>Not Crazy,
not faking it.
She was diagnosed with foreign accent syndrome,</v>

663
00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:48.370
a rare condition that usually accompanies a stroke.

664
00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:51.220
Neurological damage or underlying health issue.

665
00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:53.820
<v 0>It's kind of funny to me that,
um,</v>

666
00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:57.300
we picked us up on the other one is that it's not just an accent,

667
00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:01.830
but then their grammar,
the word.
Yeah.
And host balloon at hospital.

668
00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:05.640
Make sure you're not alone.
We don't say no,
you know?
No,
but that's,

669
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:06.660
but that's just,

670
00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:08.450
<v 5>I mean,
sorry,
but that,</v>

671
00:43:08.451 --> 00:43:11.880
that also kind of whatever speaks to the authenticity of foreign accents.

672
00:43:11.881 --> 00:43:16.550
I don't pick up the grammatical,
but you're going to pick up colloquialisms.
Yeah.

673
00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:20.820
See that to me that means something different than just the way you're speaking.

674
00:43:20.821 --> 00:43:25.290
Right.
So it has to be learned.
Yeah,
because like the,
the,
the,

675
00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:27.780
the Chinese accent,
she would be,

676
00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:31.160
she would say grammatically incorrect thing.
Right.

677
00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:35.130
She was speaking English as though she were like a Chinese person learning,

678
00:43:35.131 --> 00:43:37.710
learning English.
I have on not that actually had my

679
00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:42.080
three year now.
Like they know what she did,

680
00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:47.070
didn't speak English like that right now I wonder to native speakers,
whatever,

681
00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:50.550
does it sound proper?
Like is her accent good?
I'm going to say,

682
00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:53.460
I'm going to say no.
As a person who likes accents a lot.

683
00:43:53.461 --> 00:43:57.860
Like to add to an annoying degree.
Yeah.
I'm calling no on that one.
Really?

684
00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:01.920
<v 0>Yeah.
I would have to say as,
as somebody who also enjoys accents,</v>

685
00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:03.480
it doesn't feel like she's

686
00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:06.380
<v 5>like,
which part of England is she from?</v>

687
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:10.880
She sounds like she's from like a sort of a semi posh area of the Midlands or

688
00:44:10.881 --> 00:44:15.710
London.
Wow.
Specific Johnny.
Well,
cause she's,
she's not doing like the uh,

689
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:19.490
the whole like oh from north London,
may from the flock and north London.
Oh,

690
00:44:19.491 --> 00:44:22.520
right,
right,
right.
Yeah.
That's how we do here.
Fuck off.
That's good.

691
00:44:22.521 --> 00:44:25.700
Sod off from your and all.
You got these people who live in like,
um,

692
00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:29.060
like with Jon Snow's from,
I did a movie,
this girl who was from there,

693
00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:33.990
it's like God,
their accents.
So annoying.
Kind of.
It's like God,
I came and think,

694
00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:37.050
oh mom's here for,
why are we going to go there?

695
00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:38.880
Oh well great to be here with you.

696
00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.670
It's like this weird mixture of Scottish and Irish.

697
00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:46.590
Is that accent considered?
Well the one you just did like a lower class.

698
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:51.660
I think it depends.
Collar the posh.
That's think that depends on I think,

699
00:44:51.661 --> 00:44:54.810
um,
I don't think so.
Cause that's more of a regional one.

700
00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.740
I can't think of they call it.
Um,
but we have a master of access.

701
00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:01.740
We can do it next week.
You can recall.
I want to ask you the salt,

702
00:45:01.741 --> 00:45:04.940
we were watching that movie about Winston Churchill last night.
Right.

703
00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:09.680
And I noticed the royals,
they speak in the very,
this big highest,
Hey,

704
00:45:09.681 --> 00:45:14.450
I'm good shouting at standing it,
Shannon,
Ciao.

705
00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:19.230
Hey.
I noticed that sometimes they don't,
they don't do their ours,
right.

706
00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.160
They go uh,
the web or whatever.

707
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:26.130
Well that's because in uh,
you're allowed to have a list there.

708
00:45:26.131 --> 00:45:28.590
It's not considered a speech impediment or speech impediment.

709
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:32.340
Is it still like that or was that still is it was just talk show host him grant

710
00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:35.670
things.
Graham Norton,
he has a,
he's a full on list and he's like,

711
00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:37.210
I think his grandma,

712
00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:41.970
there's definitely a guy on TV in the UK who has a list and it's just,

713
00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:45.720
that's considered like just how you talk because I remember that TV show.

714
00:45:45.721 --> 00:45:46.830
Do you remember the young ones?

715
00:45:46.831 --> 00:45:51.510
I don't know if you ever saw that as they used to make fun of that Viviane some

716
00:45:51.511 --> 00:45:54.570
guy would always do it like,
like it was a posh thing to do.
I'm like,

717
00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:57.210
oh that makes sense.
Maybe it is,
maybe it's posh cause you can get away with it.

718
00:45:57.211 --> 00:46:00.600
It's like,
I'm so rich,
I don't have to change the way I speak or something.
Yeah,

719
00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:05.320
that could be.
It said British chip Chabot.

720
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:12.140
I used to always go to my mom and my bones had the stack of medical papers.

721
00:46:12.141 --> 00:46:13.890
As Michelle also has ehlers,

722
00:46:13.891 --> 00:46:18.891
Danlos Syndrome joints and master doctors can tell it turned her British,

723
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:28.730
British love that to be the result of something that happened to me.

724
00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:31.020
What she used to sound like.
These are always fascinating.

725
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:35.580
Looking back at how she used to be is difficult today.
I want to encourage you,

726
00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:39.870
so what do you think when you hear that?
I'm sad.
Why does it make you sad?

727
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:45.500
I guess you still having your head different path.

728
00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:48.720
Can you say something?
Personality thing.

729
00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:52.380
She was standing in front of a massive weed plant and that previous video,

730
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:55.890
which she really,
yeah,
I'm pretty sure that was.
If it wasn't,
it was like,
ah,

731
00:46:56.970 --> 00:47:00.840
right.
Oh yeah,
so you're a,
what about that?

732
00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:04.410
She's staying in front of Ganja plant.

733
00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:06.660
We just have a big druggie problem here.

734
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:10.520
I smoked a bunch of weed and the whole

735
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:17.620
too much.
Downton Abbey.
That's what happens to me.
If I watch that.

736
00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:22.620
Sally,
what's that show that came out on Netflix?

737
00:47:22.621 --> 00:47:26.370
The cloud.
The one,
the one that gets me all the time.

738
00:47:26.371 --> 00:47:28.890
It's like the old cowboy movies when they have the southern.

739
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.270
<v 4>I just want like live in that.
I watched that one.
The old southern,
the cowboy.</v>

740
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:37.270
We've got to get on down here before.
If you don't,

741
00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:39.890
if you don't find a way out of here.
We look from hell to breakfast at night.

742
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:44.560
Found nothing but dust and dust and tumbleweeds.
Ahh,
here.

743
00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:49.600
Oh heck.
It sounds like a lot of,
wow.
I would love to just wake up.

744
00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:54.400
I would love to have that to wake up.
I,
I don't know.
I grew up in Minnesota.

745
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:58.360
America is how I am,
but you know,

746
00:47:58.361 --> 00:48:02.320
y'all want to get some beer.
I'm just,
I'm sick and tired.
Drinking water today.

747
00:48:02.321 --> 00:48:06.080
Stars Day.
I'm just,
I,
I just plum sick of it.

748
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:10.780
I had a new is how they thought it'd be great if it wasn't just an accident was

749
00:48:10.781 --> 00:48:11.980
like a different time period.

750
00:48:11.981 --> 00:48:16.840
Like he has an accent from the 1920s and Texas.

751
00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:22.060
Those southern expressions are the man.
It's the greatest.

752
00:48:22.061 --> 00:48:23.630
It's the absolute greatest thing I ever like.

753
00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:27.030
Some of those leaders and plum juice and all that shit.
Like you're like,
who?

754
00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:32.140
Who comes up with this shit?
But it's all in the lexicon down.
We got,

755
00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:34.910
oh you can come on here,
but it's cash on the barrel head here son.

756
00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:38.760
We don't take credit or we don't take credit or check it's cash on the barrel

757
00:48:38.761 --> 00:48:42.370
head or you walk do,
you can come.
You can come loaded to bear,

758
00:48:42.371 --> 00:48:47.370
but we were going to turn you out.
Wow.
I just think about it a lot.

759
00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:51.130
It's like,
it's like a,
it's like a brain massage almost.
I feel like.

760
00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:56.080
Were you an only child?
No.
First Child.
Same thing.
Almost sometimes.

761
00:48:57.090 --> 00:49:01.510
Dude told me,
he's like,
you know,
my daddy told me one time,
he said no.

762
00:49:01.511 --> 00:49:04.570
My Dad said you called me daddy when were tomboys me last time he comes out your

763
00:49:04.571 --> 00:49:09.040
mouth.
I didn't even understand that.
He was saying,

764
00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:13.930
you said he got mad at you cause I got got to the age where he's don't say daddy

765
00:49:13.931 --> 00:49:18.850
no more.
So it was like seven,
seven.
I was like,
so he was saying,

766
00:49:18.851 --> 00:49:22.960
he's like,
he said he's going to whip the bit me to the white meat,

767
00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:29.320
mid down the white meat boy.
You don't say daddy no more like,

768
00:49:29.321 --> 00:49:32.170
okay man.
Well,
you know,
cy day and no more.

769
00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:35.980
You now say,
daddy no more.

770
00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:39.270
I tell you what,

771
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:46.360
this guy from Tennessee east to say to tears in a bucket.
Fuck it.
Oh my God,

772
00:49:46.361 --> 00:49:49.750
that's good.
I like that.
Wow.
I knew a guy.

773
00:49:49.751 --> 00:49:53.440
I'm an engineer in Minnesota who would smoke a cigarette and three drags,

774
00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:57.820
never wore a jacket all winter,
and he had some crazy expressions.

775
00:49:57.830 --> 00:50:02.170
He's really into a tractor pulling.
He'd be like,
Oh yeah,
oh,
going on.

776
00:50:02.171 --> 00:50:06.730
They're firing frauds letters today.
Or we say it's like a,
Oh,

777
00:50:06.731 --> 00:50:11.230
you couldn't catch me five ways.
A Friday on that thing.
Finally talking about,

778
00:50:11.231 --> 00:50:14.170
man,
his name was Dale Dale Mann.

779
00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.300
Dale had a lot of traction pulling magazines in the shitter.

780
00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:22.000
I love that expression.
Um,
I heard it for what?
Canadian first when he said like,

781
00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:26.820
ah Buddy,
he looks like 10 pounds of shit in a five pound bag.
I like that.

782
00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:27.663
I've never heard that

783
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:32.830
<v 5>when I was like,
that's a good script.
Her Canadians,
same things.</v>

784
00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:37.070
Minnesota.
Yeah.
Pretty close.
Close enough.
Close enough.
Here's the last one.

785
00:50:37.071 --> 00:50:41.870
Hold on.
Let's see.
But her outlook is sunny.
Um,

786
00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:46.610
what?
What?
What is but wondering if the sound of her voice,

787
00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:50.920
am I talking like this will never change again.
Oh,
is that I dunno.

788
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:55.730
Psychedelic and weird.
So weird.
Tim and Eric turned her British.

789
00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:59.720
That's the best part of that whole thing.
That it's just silly.

790
00:50:59.721 --> 00:51:03.410
Turned her British.
No,
not really.
That's it.

791
00:51:03.411 --> 00:51:05.510
That'd be a cool way to wake up as you talk.

792
00:51:05.511 --> 00:51:07.070
Like you're introducing this segment.

793
00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:11.360
I just can't find its parking.

794
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:16.250
We're here and we just can't seem to find a way out of the store.

795
00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:20.870
Excuse me.
Do you know where they keep air freshener?

796
00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:24.860
He couldn't answer the question.
Oh God.

797
00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:28.010
It was being spoken to them as though they didn't know.

798
00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:32.930
If you don't take that on stage,
you're an ass.
It's mine.
I just got it.

799
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:37.100
And it's mine now.
What'd you rather for Johnny?
What's that?
Okay.

800
00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:42.000
What'd you rather talk in that exact,
the TV show,

801
00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:45.980
news caster announcement.
The Chris Hansen from dateline NBC.

802
00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:48.530
You have to fight like that to your wife too.

803
00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:52.340
When you go on stage to do your act,
everything is inland and the life,

804
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:55.940
all of life and you can't tell people why because it's a would you rather or

805
00:51:55.941 --> 00:51:59.450
would you rather shout everything?
Definitely shout

806
00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:05.330
like shout or scream.
Shoutings different than screaming,
right?
Yeah,

807
00:52:05.331 --> 00:52:07.170
I kind of is because there's,

808
00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:10.910
there's people who do live the shouters people who are like,
I'm loud.

809
00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:15.240
That's trail.
You sleep over.
My sisters are shouting.
Yeah,

810
00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:20.150
they are God.
Well I'm going to say screamer and I was like,

811
00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:22.653
oh my God,

812
00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:28.310
I can't handle it down and belligerent.

813
00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:30.620
We a know Tom and I are low talkers.

814
00:52:30.621 --> 00:52:33.590
That's why we're married cause we can practically whisper to each other.

815
00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:38.170
It's true.
I'm a low toggle too loud.
I can't stand.
It's almost like a,

816
00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:41.030
I feel like it's like a fault where I can't.

817
00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:45.260
If I can't have a conversation in a place where I'm not being overheard,

818
00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:49.310
oh my God,
I may not be able to take that call from a place I come get.

819
00:52:49.311 --> 00:52:51.200
So like I don't want to be,

820
00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:55.340
this girl used to know who lived across the street from us when we lived

821
00:52:55.341 --> 00:52:59.510
downtown years ago and she would um,
we were watching a movie in our apartment.

822
00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:00.260
Right.

823
00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:04.460
She'd take a phone call sitting in the middle of the couch during the movie and

824
00:53:04.461 --> 00:53:09.030
just so totally oblivious.
No.
What,
how are you,

825
00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:11.650
how do you do that?
I don't know.

826
00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:16.880
It's one of those things where I wish they could understand that perspective.

827
00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:18.710
I always make me crazy.
This is all,

828
00:53:18.711 --> 00:53:20.900
everything's back to childhood where I would watch,

829
00:53:20.901 --> 00:53:25.901
it'd be watching a movie and I'm just like focused on the television washing it

830
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:30.130
and my sister were just walking room and be like,
Hey Tommy,

831
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:33.660
do you want to go later on to the,
over to the park with it.
I'd be like,

832
00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:38.400
you know,
like my hand and be like,
she's like,
hey,
hello.
And I'm like,
dude,

833
00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:41.580
can you see that I'm watching something?
Right.
And she'd be like,

834
00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:45.810
so do you want to go or not?
I'm going to,
I'm like,
hold on,
I gotta stop this.

835
00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:48.990
I gotta rewind it.
Like,
why would you disrespect?
You know,
like,

836
00:53:48.991 --> 00:53:51.060
why would you just say like,
Hey,
can I ask you something?
Right.

837
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:55.650
It's just always like right into it.
It would make me crazy man.
Fucking crazy.

838
00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:59.580
I don't think I actually took a nap in my life until I went to college.
Yeah.

839
00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:03.770
Because I'm so used to my mom always like checking off like,
oh,
what's going on?

840
00:54:03.850 --> 00:54:06.930
Why I hate what's going over there.
It was gone and when I had it,

841
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:11.430
I could actually lay down and not be disturbed.
It was like,
Holy Shit.

842
00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:14.730
Yeah,
you can take an,
I can.
I've never,
never took a nap before.

843
00:54:14.731 --> 00:54:17.990
Then at the same thing,
by the way,
my,
uh,
siblings would do on like,

844
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:20.620
I'm on the phone holding the phone.
I'm like,
yeah.

845
00:54:20.621 --> 00:54:23.820
So I guess later and they would just be like,
Tommy,
do you want to go to,

846
00:54:23.821 --> 00:54:27.690
I'm like the Tommy Tom on the phone.

847
00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:29.730
Like you don't see that I'm on the phone.
Yeah,
yeah.

848
00:54:29.731 --> 00:54:32.740
I'm asking you something and I'm like,
why wouldn't you be like,
oh,

849
00:54:32.741 --> 00:54:36.180
I'll wait until he's done talking on the phone?
I guess it's good.

850
00:54:36.181 --> 00:54:38.820
I was ignored most of my childhood.
Oh Dude,
totally alone.

851
00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:43.940
I took naps and it makes me know,
talks to me when I'm on the phone.
Um,

852
00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:47.550
you know what I hate is people that take cell phone conversations on

853
00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:51.080
speakerphone.
Uh,
like in the airport.
Oh,
you said,
hey,

854
00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:55.050
those people are psychotic.
Yeah,
I would,
if that ever happens,

855
00:54:55.051 --> 00:54:58.560
if I ever see that,
I immediately go,
oh,
I'm involved in this too.

856
00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:01.890
Everyone is just to walk up and be like,
ah.
I just love,

857
00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:06.630
I love like just walking up as close as I can just join again.
Yeah.

858
00:55:06.631 --> 00:55:09.700
Actually Know Jim,
we thought that that wasn't going to work because they did.

859
00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:14.310
The deliverables aren't ready.
I was like,
what the fuck you man,

860
00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:18.060
it's you.
And it's always that conversation.
It's never anything interesting.

861
00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:20.700
You know,
it's every like,
should I break up with him?
I don't know.

862
00:55:20.701 --> 00:55:23.730
Let's take her off of life support.
I don't know.
It's like video.

863
00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:27.030
We were going through my phone the other day and it's me at the airport.

864
00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:27.993
Remember taking,

865
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:31.080
I'm in the Dallas airport and I'm looking at this film like what is this?

866
00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:31.950
And it's cause it's old.

867
00:55:31.951 --> 00:55:36.630
It's from like a year and a half ago and I'm taking a leak and then like you,

868
00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:40.050
you just hear a loud guy,

869
00:55:40.110 --> 00:55:43.820
a guy saying a business call and the shitter in this shit.
And then like,

870
00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:48.780
he's like,
well we'll arrive on Tuesday and uh,
if we don't have those,

871
00:55:48.781 --> 00:55:52.800
uh,
the p six teens,
then a Wednesday at the latest,

872
00:55:52.801 --> 00:55:57.270
I think you hear like fart flush,
sing.
He's like,
absolutely,
absolutely no,

873
00:55:57.271 --> 00:55:59.310
I mean we're,
we want to get it to you guys.
You know,

874
00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:03.300
I just making a video of them like how crazy is this guy?

875
00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:06.180
What is your working too?
He would just now look,

876
00:56:06.181 --> 00:56:08.910
I feel like you might be able to take my title on this.
It's not,

877
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:12.090
I didn't expect this,
but I feel like you're so good at this.

878
00:56:12.091 --> 00:56:13.680
That might actually happen.
We don't know.

879
00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:20.540
<v 7>Ladies and gentlemen,
Tom Segura,</v>

880
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:23.240
master of accents,

881
00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:29.740
<v 0>Hebert tend to hear for the title.
Uh,
we didn't know what was gonna happen,</v>

882
00:56:29.741 --> 00:56:31.320
but here it is.
Master of accidents.

883
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:36.220
What's going on with this man from Liverpool?

884
00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:38.350
<v 8>We got on and off</v>

885
00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:46.090
is owns it all and got to be fire dog to even to last game.

886
00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:52.340
<v 5>How's your vision monkeys?
These are goddamn monkeys.</v>

887
00:56:53.130 --> 00:56:56.930
I'll see what's happening here.
Yeah,
these are brothers,
probably twins.

888
00:56:57.620 --> 00:56:59.440
And they just mumble like hell yeah.

889
00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:06.210
<v 8>You didn't park the bushy play.
Can I fall football takes off.</v>

890
00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:12.690
Is it just one Noel called?
Cause you do it.
I'm thrilled.

891
00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:19.110
<v 5>Yeah,
the fucking learn half that the stayed in.
I mean,
all the railroad,</v>

892
00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:23.190
<v 0>there's a few words in our language that I picked up on,
but not that many.</v>

893
00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:27.390
I know.
It's really,
really thick.
Let's see.
Um,

894
00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:32.380
I'll see if I can do this.
So,
all right,
here is a,

895
00:57:32.381 --> 00:57:34.740
the email.
Hey,
I'm a fan from the UK.

896
00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:38.070
I found the ultimate challenge for the written no water champion,

897
00:57:38.071 --> 00:57:40.620
master of accents previously a live episode.

898
00:57:40.621 --> 00:57:42.960
You listened to someone from my home,

899
00:57:42.961 --> 00:57:45.860
city of Liverpool thought they were Scottish.
Uh,

900
00:57:46.110 --> 00:57:49.680
however these two brothers make that guy sound like the queen and just for the

901
00:57:49.681 --> 00:57:53.640
record,
their accents are abnormally strong.
They sounded ridiculous.

902
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:57.030
Even to me add to that,
they also sound like they'd been drinking.

903
00:57:58.090 --> 00:58:01.800
Imagine it in comprehensible for anyone outside of Liverpool.

904
00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:04.830
So know that they in no way reflect all of us,

905
00:58:04.831 --> 00:58:07.680
but that's what made me laugh a much love Danny.

906
00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:11.450
So let's even see,
um,

907
00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:15.110
I have the advantage of having the transcript with me.
So it's like,
okay,

908
00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:17.430
well let's see,
cause I'll,
I'll just throw in the towel.

909
00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:20.640
I don't know what the fuck these guys are saying.
Let's see if,
uh,

910
00:58:20.641 --> 00:58:25.050
if you can get what these,
the first two lines are tweets.

911
00:58:25.110 --> 00:58:28.590
So in other words,
the line that the first guy says and then the reply back.
Okay,

912
00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.630
let's see what if you can get it.
Okay.
Okay.

913
00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:33.013
<v 8>You got all</v>

914
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.570
these islands at all and got to be fire dog around.
Yeah,

915
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:43.300
<v 5>that is why I actually seeing it in front of me.
I'm like,
wow,</v>

916
00:58:43.301 --> 00:58:46.870
but no on Joe.
Do you know what they're saying?
I have an idea.
You have an idea.

917
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:49.300
This is just always the case.

918
00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:52.810
Anyone from it sucks that there's a music bed because it'd be better without it.

919
00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:56.100
They're talking about football.
That's true.
Football.

920
00:58:56.160 --> 00:59:00.790
I think he was saying something about his playing and so I'm pretty sure it's

921
00:59:00.791 --> 00:59:04.090
what's going on or if it's not that I'm talking to there.
How about a footballer?

922
00:59:04.590 --> 00:59:06.630
<v 0>Okay,
you're pretty close.
Okay.
I mean you're,
you're,</v>

923
00:59:06.631 --> 00:59:09.830
you're definitely in the right,
the right field.
You have a guest,
Jeanne.

924
00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:13.860
<v 5>Um,
he's talking shit to him.
He's like,
you're not shit.</v>

925
00:59:14.210 --> 00:59:17.850
And it's a either about,
he can,
maybe he can't drink enough.

926
00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:20.400
He's a pussy with drinking or something like that.
Actually.

927
00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:22.280
Your both your ideas together.

928
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:28.740
<v 2>Football,
he's saying that his team?
I believe so.</v>

929
00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:29.750
The first guy says,

930
00:59:29.751 --> 00:59:34.751
so how do you reckon we're going to get on side is the first thing you said and

931
00:59:35.451 --> 00:59:39.230
then the reply is obviously use aren't going to win.

932
00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:44.120
We're going to beat us or draw and get a replay at our ground.
Never,

933
00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:47.900
whatever.
Now you know,
now that you know,
you'll hear it all.

934
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:55.550
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

935
00:59:56.040 --> 01:00:01.020
<v 2>wow.
Yeah.
No,
that's fucking amazing.
I still don't hear it actually.</v>

936
01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:06.500
Once I'm having to really struggle and then the next,
here's the next uh,

937
01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:08.310
mumbling too,

938
01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:11.540
<v 8>so it off.
If we don't have lost game too,</v>

939
01:00:12.850 --> 01:00:16.120
<v 4>it's also making a tea get,
uh,
if I'm,</v>

940
01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:21.230
if I'm using the sink in my house and Brett talks to me,
I'm like,
oh,

941
01:00:21.231 --> 01:00:24.730
I have no idea what you said.
If you could be right next to me,
sing song.
Oh,
here.

942
01:00:24.731 --> 01:00:26.030
A guide in thing.
That's what this is.

943
01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:30.430
<v 2>Sync problem was a sync issue.
I had the same issue with our shower.</v>

944
01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:33.400
She'll be like,
Tom.
And I'm like,
yeah.
And then she's like,

945
01:00:34.790 --> 01:00:38.040
nothing that I hear that just the water coming down issue.

946
01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:42.430
If you're doing anything other than you're just listening.
I

947
01:00:44.970 --> 01:00:46.330
don't hear you.

948
01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:49.960
You don't hear me when you're doing anything other than listening.

949
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:51.640
When you're frying bacon,
you don't hear me.

950
01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:53.800
<v 4>When you're writing is a skill.
That right there.</v>

951
01:00:53.801 --> 01:00:58.780
Is it a skill that I developed my man as a skill I developed at home because my

952
01:00:58.781 --> 01:01:03.010
mom talks constantly.
I have two younger sisters,
younger brother.

953
01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:06.840
It's just a constant influx of eh,
eh,
Eh,
eh.

954
01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:11.830
And so I learned to just shut it down.
They shut it down because it happened.

955
01:01:11.831 --> 01:01:16.120
Was I developed a skill is in the same house home.
Yeah.
Growing up.

956
01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:17.810
And then it's just,
I can't break it.
Yeah.

957
01:01:17.811 --> 01:01:20.290
The one that I can't break and I don't even try to do this,

958
01:01:20.291 --> 01:01:25.291
but I swear to you it is a fail proof is that if I'm reading something,

959
01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:29.500
I don't hear anything.
I don't hear a thing.
Sometimes I'm that way.

960
01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:32.860
I'll be reading it and she'll be like,
so,
and I'm like,
so what?
She goes,

961
01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:34.810
did you hear anything I just said?
And I'm like,
no,

962
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:37.780
you can't do more than one thing at a time.
I mean,
really,
if you're reading,

963
01:01:37.781 --> 01:01:40.270
you should not be able to hear anything.
Right.

964
01:01:40.271 --> 01:01:43.000
If you're actually come comprehending what you're reading in Spanish,

965
01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:46.150
really hear anything.
Yeah.
Um,
well this,

966
01:01:46.151 --> 01:01:48.670
this accident though is really crazy.

967
01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:54.790
Grandma Shannon.
No.
Yeah.
That might be the,
I mean I think this guy's right.

968
01:01:54.791 --> 01:01:57.090
This might be the craziest one that I've,
this one's really right,

969
01:01:57.190 --> 01:02:00.360
<v 8>man.
He didn't park the bushy play.</v>

970
01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:03.190
Can I for four takes off

971
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:09.600
user salad and might use it just one Noel called cause you do it.

972
01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:13.140
<v 2>You're just celebrating.
Might cause he just won the World Cup.</v>

973
01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:16.250
You're celebrating like you won the World Cup Cup.

974
01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.550
<v 4>You're gay for play.
I saw you gave play.</v>

975
01:02:18.551 --> 01:02:21.870
You want to get on there and you gave the play and you were a at Ogle.

976
01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:25.950
You want to just suck is on me now.
I'm a gay for playboy.

977
01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:30.920
<v 5>Gay for play and you gave her plan.
You want to do suck.
He's on me.</v>

978
01:02:30.921 --> 01:02:33.120
You're a big boy.
Big Puff.
Yup.
That's it.

979
01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:38.930
<v 8>And our families a blue or my older brother,</v>

980
01:02:38.931 --> 01:02:42.750
he was a rather new sorts of got older.
Me and Sam.
Yeah.

981
01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:47.960
It's taught me on the Claudi path while they are always to the way I make my own

982
01:02:47.961 --> 01:02:49.690
decisions on let you on with

983
01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:53.740
<v 5>yum,
yum,
yum.</v>

984
01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:00.760
That's all I hear it all man.
I make my own decisions.
I'm on the glide path.

985
01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.830
So now they're,
now they're speaking.
They were doing,

986
01:03:02.890 --> 01:03:04.860
they were acting the fool earlier.
They were,

987
01:03:04.930 --> 01:03:08.910
that was t talk really storing them up.
I was pretty tall.

988
01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:14.260
Yeah.
Fair enough.
Fair.

989
01:03:14.350 --> 01:03:19.150
That isn't masterful master of accents.
No,
I'm very impressed.
It's wonderful.

990
01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:23.350
That was bumbling too though.
Yeah.
A lot of mumble mumble rappers.

991
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.640
<v 4>So it's got to go.</v>

992
01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:32.290
Are we going to go to the Oscars are coming up.
You've ever gotten?
No.

993
01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:36.670
That's a fun question to ask someone though.
Have you ever been nominated?
No.

994
01:03:37.570 --> 01:03:40.880
You would know that?
I think you would know.
I wouldn't,

995
01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:44.260
I would probably lead with that.
I'd walk in the room.
Hey,
just so you know,
um,

996
01:03:44.261 --> 01:03:46.530
I've been out here for an Oscar so just,
you know,
watch your tone.

997
01:03:48.850 --> 01:03:52.450
I thought that was why we booked you cause I'm up for an arm right now.

998
01:03:52.510 --> 01:03:54.880
I thought so.
Well I'm not,

999
01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:58.180
I was in a movie that was nominated in the loop.

1000
01:03:58.450 --> 01:04:01.440
I got nominated for best adapted screenplay.
When,

1001
01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:06.280
when the nomination happens you get phone calls.
No,
cause I was an actor.
I know,

1002
01:04:06.281 --> 01:04:11.080
but still did they go like,
hey people start,
this was the first thing I ever did.

1003
01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:15.820
So no,
it was like just a,
that was just a,
there's just no,

1004
01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:19.270
no,
I don't get any phone calls for that cause there's a screenplay thing.

1005
01:04:19.310 --> 01:04:21.080
It wasn't like a,
you know,

1006
01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:24.490
I don't think anyone was Oscar's are screwing up by like really pushing

1007
01:04:24.491 --> 01:04:29.410
diversity.
I think the Oscars are,
have always just been pale 100%.

1008
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:30.700
It doesn't make any sense.

1009
01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:35.710
Anyone he gets angry about Oscar nominations or wins is forgetting that none of

1010
01:04:35.711 --> 01:04:36.850
it makes any sense at all.

1011
01:04:36.851 --> 01:04:41.020
Like no one ever won an Oscar for the thing that they won an Oscar for.

1012
01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:45.670
What do you mean you win an Oscar for like a movie you did 10 years ago,

1013
01:04:45.671 --> 01:04:47.030
but they couldn't give it to you though.

1014
01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:50.410
Cause I had to give it to someone who needed an Oscar who from movie they did 10

1015
01:04:50.411 --> 01:04:55.090
years ago.
Oh right,
right.
Once in a while you get an Oscar nom thing.
It's just,

1016
01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:59.230
it's all just,
it's all payola too.
They put so much studios,

1017
01:04:59.231 --> 01:05:03.640
put so much money in trauma voting Oscar votes.
It's,
it's insane.

1018
01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:08.500
They put a push that shit like,
oh my God,
Millie system is rigged.

1019
01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:11.740
I put so much money into it and it's all just,
yeah,
cause it's all,

1020
01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:15.050
it's all like a cool contest.
Like who are you going to vote for?
Because who,

1021
01:05:15.550 --> 01:05:18.460
who does the academy want to feel like supporting at this time?

1022
01:05:18.461 --> 01:05:22.710
So the academy looks good.
Oh yes.
We gave it to them because we are obviously,

1023
01:05:22.711 --> 01:05:26.470
do you see how you see how we voted for them?
Cause we,
we like this.
We like this.

1024
01:05:26.471 --> 01:05:30.200
Cool.
We're cool.
We're cool.
We like these young Biz bumble core director.
We're,

1025
01:05:30.201 --> 01:05:33.670
we're supporting them even though it's not a comedy at all.
But yeah,
it's all,

1026
01:05:33.671 --> 01:05:37.060
it's all that.
I mean I still obviously wonderful if you get one,
I suppose.

1027
01:05:37.061 --> 01:05:41.060
And it's,
it's,
it's great and it's a real thing.
But at the same time,
this,

1028
01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:44.410
there's so many people who haven't been nominated for Oscars who deserve them

1029
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:49.300
hands just 10 times over.
Any other people in their same category.

1030
01:05:49.330 --> 01:05:51.640
There's just not,
because maybe they're not sexy enough or,

1031
01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:56.900
<v 5>well,
speaking of sexy,
do you feel like,
are you,
uh,
in,
you know,
in on these,
um,</v>

1032
01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.700
the push to make the award shows genderless?
You know,

1033
01:06:00.330 --> 01:06:02.590
<v 4>I don't know.
That seems kind of weird to me.
Ellison,</v>

1034
01:06:02.790 --> 01:06:05.840
there'd be so many less awards.
Yeah,
I dunno.

1035
01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:09.620
I mean it's Kinda like a thing where if you do that then it doesn't,

1036
01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:12.900
it doesn't make any sense.
I just,
it seems like a pro,

1037
01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:16.090
you're creating a new problem that doesn't really exist.
That's enough.

1038
01:06:16.330 --> 01:06:18.450
There's not a,
there's not a problem there.
Is there a problem?

1039
01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:22.860
<v 5>I don't know.
I don't think so.
I didn't see all this stuff you have up there.</v>

1040
01:06:22.861 --> 01:06:24.900
I don't even know that it was the thing right now.
Oh,
it's a thing.

1041
01:06:24.901 --> 01:06:29.901
Did you know and Canada Trudeau change their national anthem to be non gender

1042
01:06:31.141 --> 01:06:34.230
specific so they,
what did they use?
Non Binary.

1043
01:06:34.231 --> 01:06:37.410
It was something about there's a line in there like the boys are Blah Blah Blah

1044
01:06:37.411 --> 01:06:39.870
and they changed it to be gender neutral.

1045
01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:43.110
There's not like a historical reference to the boys who had like bed nets and

1046
01:06:43.111 --> 01:06:47.850
stuff probably.
Yeah.
Who died actually boys that did die.
Man.

1047
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.090
I see that.
The,
what's the point of that?
What do you get here?
Oh No,
here it is.

1048
01:06:51.091 --> 01:06:54.330
Oh Canada.
Our home and native land.

1049
01:06:54.331 --> 01:06:56.730
True Patriot love in all thy sons command.

1050
01:06:57.030 --> 01:07:01.410
So they change it from in all thy sons command to in all of us command.

1051
01:07:01.890 --> 01:07:05.040
So I don't know there was that really bothering people.

1052
01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:09.000
I think it's bothering people more that he just went ahead and changed it.

1053
01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:11.790
That seems to be the,
the dilemma here.
Like,
hey dude,

1054
01:07:11.791 --> 01:07:15.120
we didn't nobody authorize that.
Like you can't just change our national anthem.

1055
01:07:15.121 --> 01:07:18.090
I think that's the general three Trudeau though.
It's very true.

1056
01:07:18.091 --> 01:07:22.740
Drove Trudeau brand.
Yeah.
It's on Trudeau about this gene.

1057
01:07:22.770 --> 01:07:26.390
Have you seen this go?
Oh,

1058
01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:28.460
I always like a good spark video.

1059
01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:33.353
<v 9>Oh,</v>

1060
01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:36.390
<v 5>that's really pretty.
I didn't see,
I knew that was going to happen,</v>

1061
01:07:36.391 --> 01:07:39.560
but then you're like,
maybe it won't.
Maybe it won't work.
There you go.

1062
01:07:39.570 --> 01:07:40.403
So it's nice to see it.
Yeah.

1063
01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.400
A little nug.
Yeah,

1064
01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:56.230
I remember that part of Jackass Three d Dave England.

1065
01:07:56.380 --> 01:07:58.930
You seen this Jackass Three d?
I don't think so.
Off The three D.

1066
01:07:58.931 --> 01:08:01.090
I don't know if you got to see it.
They're so funny.

1067
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:05.890
I love those dudes and we must see that one.
I feel like I'm,
I love them so much.

1068
01:08:05.891 --> 01:08:07.180
I love the show.
I saw it.

1069
01:08:07.181 --> 01:08:11.440
I think two films and we'll do three d is the one for me.
Okay.

1070
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:15.190
That's the last one though.
Yeah,
there's a great,
is a great uh,
Poopoo one there.

1071
01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:16.133
I can,

1072
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:21.160
<v 4>I think about it,
um,
at least once a week.
Wow.
Wow.
Really so satisfying.
Yeah,</v>

1073
01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:25.880
it's truly amazing.
If he liked those,
you got to see my new movie coming out.

1074
01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:29.250
Do you,
do you have any movie coming out?
Yeah,
it comes out June 1st.
What is this?

1075
01:08:29.251 --> 01:08:33.540
It's called action point.
Action points,
but Action Park in New Jersey in,

1076
01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:37.490
but the old,
the old amusement park in New Jersey now he's like super dangerous.

1077
01:08:37.491 --> 01:08:38.780
Wasn't like the late seventies.

1078
01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:42.980
It was like a place where kind of like a drunks ran the rides.

1079
01:08:42.981 --> 01:08:45.650
It was a six people died.
Well,
it was open,

1080
01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:50.030
but having the best time in their lives like died like,
dude,
you should do that.

1081
01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:51.830
Oh really?
Okay.
Uh,

1082
01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:57.310
and so it was like a notoriously very fun kind of like working class place to

1083
01:08:58.581 --> 01:09:02.930
go,
but like real danger.
Yeah.
It's kind of like in Hungary,

1084
01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:07.940
the Communists built an amusement park there and I went in the nineties like

1085
01:09:07.941 --> 01:09:10.850
right as communism fell and it was truly terrifying.

1086
01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:13.550
Like the roller of safety restrictions.
Zero.

1087
01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:16.730
There was no seatbelt on the roller coaster,
not the trailer.

1088
01:09:16.731 --> 01:09:19.760
This is something wrong.
This is some,
some Chinese shit here,
man.

1089
01:09:19.761 --> 01:09:23.180
This is like some weird,
you know what I mean?
Some weird like Chinese,

1090
01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:26.420
like that's not it.
No,
it's not.
The trailer is not out yet.

1091
01:09:26.421 --> 01:09:29.740
I'll probably be out next month,
I think.
Interesting.
I don't know what,

1092
01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:32.930
how much trailers lead movies these days,
but it comes out in June.

1093
01:09:32.931 --> 01:09:37.220
It's Johnny Knoxville.
That's why I brought it.
Oh yeah.
It's not the comedy.
Yeah,

1094
01:09:37.221 --> 01:09:39.260
it's an action comedy.
It's Knoxville and Pontius.

1095
01:09:39.290 --> 01:09:43.650
They're like the two main people that I put like Knoxville's like lackey who's

1096
01:09:43.670 --> 01:09:46.010
like a great engineer.
Yeah,
it was fun.

1097
01:09:46.011 --> 01:09:49.730
We shot in South Africa for like three months,
man.
Oh Wow.
So it was a pretty uh,

1098
01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:51.260
why did you guys shoot there?

1099
01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:56.060
Because they shoot there cause they can basically get stuff for a quarter of the

1100
01:09:56.061 --> 01:09:59.510
price.
Cause we have like 300 extras every day.

1101
01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:03.800
They have this massive amounts but they had to build from scratch and amusement

1102
01:10:03.801 --> 01:10:08.050
park and this is a,
I'm supposed to be Jersey.
Yes.
Supposed to be,

1103
01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:08.923
well that's the thing.

1104
01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:12.770
They had to change it because South Africa is like southern California 10 years

1105
01:10:12.771 --> 01:10:13.910
ago,
record drought.

1106
01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:18.140
So they couldn't make it look green enough to be New Jersey so they made it.

1107
01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:21.410
They just basically everything is the same from action.

1108
01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:26.440
It's the story of Action Park but just changed to be a fictitious,

1109
01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:32.840
I could take space in California.
Wow.
Yeah.
Nice.

1110
01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:37.430
Speaking of some Chinese shit,
you know Chinese New Year,
it was two days ago.

1111
01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:41.520
Yeah.
You're the dog man.
Good.
This is a good year.

1112
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:48.430
Basketball and the NBA is extremely popular in China,

1113
01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:53.090
but you just say basketball is extremely popular and then talk about something

1114
01:10:53.091 --> 01:10:57.830
else as well is,
was true of popular sport.
Okay.
So

1115
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:04.910
yeah.
So anyways,
uh,
just as like a little promos,
nothing new.

1116
01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:08.390
They had a bunch of NBA players to a end,

1117
01:11:08.391 --> 01:11:12.970
like former players say like happy Chinese New Year on a promo tour.
Oh dear.

1118
01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:14.190
There's

1119
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:15.420
<v 2>a controversy right now.</v>

1120
01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:19.440
This guy has apologized for and here's the amazing thing.

1121
01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:22.770
They released it this way.
First of all,

1122
01:11:22.771 --> 01:11:27.660
I'm just gonna play it for you and you tell me,
um,
you know what you think.

1123
01:11:27.661 --> 01:11:32.400
Okay.
So this is like just going through it.
These guys are just doing like,
oh,

1124
01:11:32.401 --> 01:11:35.370
happy new year.
Happy New Year and it'll,
you'll,
you'll see.
Okay.

1125
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:37.833
<v 1>Yup.</v>

1126
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:41.210
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

1127
01:11:44.150 --> 01:11:45.260
happy new year and go Jess.

1128
01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:50.780
I just wanted to wish all of China and very happy Chinese New Year.

1129
01:11:52.090 --> 01:11:55.540
<v 2>That was it.
What,
what happened?
What's offensive?</v>

1130
01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:00.070
You're gonna see it again?
Yeah.
This is like,
I'm not sure I,

1131
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:02.250
it's this guy right here.
No Way.
Yeah.

1132
01:12:02.730 --> 01:12:07.660
That he's had to issue like mold guy though.
He did the best job.
Okay.
Yeah,

1133
01:12:07.661 --> 01:12:11.650
me too.
I do the best job.
That was nice.
I get that last guy

1134
01:12:15.090 --> 01:12:18.470
<v 9>fans in China.
I'm very happy with Chinese.
Oh,
that's I know</v>

1135
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:23.200
<v 2>why?
Because he's inferring that only Chinese people in China celebrate.</v>

1136
01:12:23.230 --> 01:12:27.180
You still missed it.
You said chant?
No,
he's,

1137
01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:31.090
do you see a word I didn't hear?
Yeah.
What'd he say?
He said Chink.
No,

1138
01:12:31.091 --> 01:12:35.490
he didn't say it.
He didn't say that.
He did.
He did.

1139
01:12:36.430 --> 01:12:40.660
I thought that it was him saying a different word.
It was one of those like,
oh,

1140
01:12:40.661 --> 01:12:43.620
Lee,
like a liaison or something.
They weren't goes between them.

1141
01:12:43.930 --> 01:12:47.220
He said it and then you could see all the,
like he basically restarted,

1142
01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:50.830
but they edit it together.
Okay.
Let's say one more time.
This is true.
It is true.

1143
01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:51.933
This is,

1144
01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:54.220
<v 1>yes.</v>

1145
01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:58.500
<v 9>The jazz
bands and China.</v>

1146
01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:03.820
<v 2>Yeah.
Right in there.
He said the MBA,
Chink Fan.
The edit comes afterwards here.</v>

1147
01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:06.200
See how they're doing?
Like a little transition.
Oh,

1148
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:08.390
<v 9>Chinese new year.</v>

1149
01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:12.460
<v 2>When you said the NBA Chink fans,
right?
Yeah.
Oh my God.
But it was like,</v>

1150
01:13:12.490 --> 01:13:15.520
I don't think he's,
he actually was running back,
hey,
you fucking chinks.

1151
01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:18.010
Happy New Year.
I think you know,

1152
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:22.570
sometimes your brain just morphs a word out that was not,

1153
01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:24.910
you didn't want to see,
I don't think he's trying to say it,

1154
01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:27.300
but he actually says it.
I got a question.
Yeah,

1155
01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.920
why wouldn't they edit that out if they edit it at all?

1156
01:13:30.610 --> 01:13:34.930
That that was one of the things that now later on they edit it out.

1157
01:13:35.410 --> 01:13:37.660
I don't think he said Chink.
What do you think he said?

1158
01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:41.710
I think he said China and the edit made it seem like he said that.
No,

1159
01:13:41.711 --> 01:13:46.040
because the edit happens afterwards.
He says no it one more time.
Yeah.

1160
01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:50.920
I swear to God says Nba Change Pants and then had it happened,

1161
01:13:51.250 --> 01:13:55.210
he goes like NBA Cheat Mba.
He like restarts.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1162
01:13:55.211 --> 01:13:58.060
because I think because he restarts cause he's like,
I'm not,

1163
01:13:59.230 --> 01:14:03.520
I think the word escaped his mouth,
his mouth and his mouse.

1164
01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:06.880
But I think that the,
he then tries to reset.

1165
01:14:08.050 --> 01:14:12.100
I don't think he's trying to say with the intent of saying like

1166
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:16.840
<v 0>a pejorative word,
but I think the actual five letters,</v>

1167
01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:19.300
whatever just popped out of his mouth and then he just

1168
01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:22.810
<v 5>didn't hear a k simple as that.
I know.
I'm not here.
Okay.
I heard a hard chunk.</v>

1169
01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:25.390
You gotta listen,
I'm going to close my eyes.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.

1170
01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:26.640
<v 9>Just a little leery to go jazz</v>

1171
01:14:29.670 --> 01:14:30.570
fans in China.

1172
01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:35.290
<v 5>See,
I thought he said NBA Champ.
No.
Well,
the first time I saw it I was like,
oh,</v>

1173
01:14:35.291 --> 01:14:38.500
I didn't said this is chat in here.
Check the first time either.
But then,
well,

1174
01:14:38.501 --> 01:14:43.420
this guys,
he said,
who is this guy?
He's a dumb ass dumb ass.
He's,
I know he's,

1175
01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:47.250
he's been doing apology after a poem.
How dumb.

1176
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:51.970
It's like of all the people to piss off China.
I know.
And you know,

1177
01:14:51.971 --> 01:14:55.210
I'd actually forgotten the word Chink.
I don't even think of it anymore.

1178
01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:59.360
It's an old one.
Such an old school that way.

1179
01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:04.990
Now remember that word?
Yeah,
I was tongue tied.
Jeez.

1180
01:15:05.130 --> 01:15:09.400
Oh boy.
Why would they air it?
That's the silly.
Was it live or something?
Couldn't,

1181
01:15:09.401 --> 01:15:10.480
they have controlled that?

1182
01:15:10.670 --> 01:15:13.910
<v 0>He says,
I just saw the video being circulated of me.</v>

1183
01:15:13.911 --> 01:15:17.270
I was tongue tied as the word purportedly said is not in my vocabulary.

1184
01:15:17.271 --> 01:15:19.520
I'm disappointed and he would think I would use that word.

1185
01:15:19.521 --> 01:15:21.620
I love and respect our friends in China.

1186
01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:26.860
Then he did a second thing where he went further to all our NBA fans in China.

1187
01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:31.590
Sincerely apologize.
Anyone I have offended.
I was glad to do.
I was in Tennessee,

1188
01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:35.960
NBA,
Chinese fans.
I think that's what happened.
Cause I think this guy,

1189
01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:37.260
yeah,

1190
01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:41.720
he had to run away and he said as we record it and no one in the room,

1191
01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:46.490
not the NBA pro PR team.
Nobody heard the word that was important to say.
Anyways.

1192
01:15:46.491 --> 01:15:49.930
He's like doing,
you know,
apology after a pilot.
Oh Geez.
Um,

1193
01:15:50.090 --> 01:15:52.700
I'm saying he didn't say it.
You really still don't think you said it.

1194
01:15:52.730 --> 01:15:55.490
I don't think he said it.
Why would you say that?
But he said it.

1195
01:15:55.670 --> 01:15:59.390
But why would you,
it's like such a,
such a bad thing to say,

1196
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:04.810
but I mean there's audio of it.
You can hear him right,

1197
01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:08.660
but isn't one of those things where if you are looking for it,
you'll find it.

1198
01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:14.090
<v 5>Cause we don't want you to punch.
And it sounded like he just said NBA,</v>

1199
01:16:14.091 --> 01:16:17.630
China,
they're in pain about without watching it.
Close your eyes.
Okay.

1200
01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:20.110
<v 9>But now I know,
I'm just looking for that</v>

1201
01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:23.203
China.

1202
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:28.510
<v 5>Yeah,
I wouldn't,
yeah,
I sound fans and we aid ching.
I'm saying that the,</v>

1203
01:16:28.511 --> 01:16:32.500
I don't think the intent is there of,
of right insulting,

1204
01:16:32.710 --> 01:16:35.230
but I still think that that word came out of,
I don't mean,

1205
01:16:35.231 --> 01:16:37.210
I'm not saying you guys should be roasting.
Where did he grow up?

1206
01:16:37.211 --> 01:16:39.310
You think he grew up in Chinatown

1207
01:16:41.710 --> 01:16:46.060
here also the cadence to,
you know,
NBA,

1208
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:50.680
Nba.
I want to thank all the NBA champ fans.
Yeah.
Ho knows.
Wait,

1209
01:16:50.681 --> 01:16:53.260
are you saying though that the word is still not the word coming out of his

1210
01:16:53.261 --> 01:16:57.670
mouth?
I just feel like it's something where,
uh,
it wasn't,

1211
01:16:58.030 --> 01:17:01.110
it's gotta be,
it's not malicious.
I say it's not malicious.

1212
01:17:01.210 --> 01:17:04.750
I don't fuck you on Chinese may.
Oh,
it's like a second.
I'm Chinese meal,

1213
01:17:04.751 --> 01:17:08.570
you're saying?
Yes.
Yeah.
Succulent Chinese meal.
Um,

1214
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:10.000
I do love a second,

1215
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.750
<v 4>like Chinese meal who doesn't enjoy it?</v>

1216
01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:15.350
He seems awfully young to throw out chink.
You know what I'm saying?

1217
01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:18.770
It does feel like an old time.
It's a grandpa word.
Yeah.
Like it's,

1218
01:17:18.771 --> 01:17:22.040
it's such an old colored or something,
you know,
it's not really,

1219
01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:25.730
you watch that Vietnam War documentary.
The Kim Burns one.
No,

1220
01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:28.750
there's so many words I say all the time that I'm like,
oh,

1221
01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:32.930
can't say that anymore.
Really?
Like dink,
dink.

1222
01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.570
Dink is a racial slur.
Evidently.
I mean,

1223
01:17:35.571 --> 01:17:38.660
I still keep saying it because Dank to me means stupid.
Like,
oh,
look at that.

1224
01:17:38.661 --> 01:17:41.990
Dinker trailing.
I think what's a dank?
It's a,
I guess it's a,

1225
01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:45.800
it's like a very specific word for Japanese,

1226
01:17:45.801 --> 01:17:47.780
I think in the real world war two or something like that.

1227
01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:52.190
It's like super specific.
It's,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's an Asian person saying that.

1228
01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:53.570
I believe it.
Yeah,
sure.

1229
01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:54.753
<v 10>Yeah.</v>

1230
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:57.730
<v 4>That's not me saying that.
Yeah,
it's fine.</v>

1231
01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:01.030
Because talking about Johnny Pemberton said Ching Chong,
Ching Chong on the spot.

1232
01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:01.930
Yeah.

1233
01:18:01.930 --> 01:18:05.480
<v 10>Oh Shit.
Without them.
Ally,
she's on and make up.
What a bitch where.</v>

1234
01:18:05.481 --> 01:18:07.720
I'm still cute to say.
Get the fuck up Outta here.
I'm,

1235
01:18:07.730 --> 01:18:11.120
I live a little bit more chicken,
Tom.
We don't get me fucked up bitch.

1236
01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:14.060
I'm still hurting.
She and we'll fuck.
Go Away.
Stop.
Okay.

1237
01:18:14.061 --> 01:18:16.860
You want to fuck with my money?
You want to fuck with my mind?

1238
01:18:17.290 --> 01:18:20.260
<v 4>Who was that?
That's that Asian lady.
Damn,</v>

1239
01:18:20.261 --> 01:18:24.400
that sounds like a like a weird hood girl from,
no,

1240
01:18:24.401 --> 01:18:29.130
she's in that Vietnam documentary.
Oh yeah.
Oh,
okay.
I met,

1241
01:18:29.410 --> 01:18:30.580
I didn't finish it.
Actually.

1242
01:18:30.581 --> 01:18:34.240
I only got to number 10 so it was probably the last part I was,
boy,

1243
01:18:34.241 --> 01:18:36.690
he was waiting.
So wait,
so dink is this racial slur?

1244
01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:39.220
It's like a really subtle one that no one knows,

1245
01:18:39.250 --> 01:18:41.530
but it's like a one that they would use.
Soldiers would say that.

1246
01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:45.060
How would you use it?
I say it like stupid.
Like,
Oh man,
look at that Dank.

1247
01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:47.020
He's trying to put it fit that bag and the overhead.

1248
01:18:47.050 --> 01:18:50.470
What a Dang Degas or something.
It sounds like a stump.
A stupid thing,
right?

1249
01:18:50.471 --> 01:18:55.120
Sounds like dingus or like flathead cost on the flat hat.
They're an idiot.
Oh,

1250
01:18:55.121 --> 01:18:57.250
that flathead.
And that's a racial slur.

1251
01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:00.550
I don't think flathead is now flat heads like an old that's like from the 18

1252
01:19:00.551 --> 01:19:04.330
hundreds I think flat face though is the racial faces.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1253
01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:07.610
But I might've just said flat face just now.
Yeah.
With that.

1254
01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:09.310
I don't wish to listen to audio.
Play it back.

1255
01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:11.860
Why don't you fucking wasted attorneys a happy new year and see what happens.

1256
01:19:11.890 --> 01:19:13.420
You know what?
I thought it was going to be for real,

1257
01:19:13.421 --> 01:19:14.590
cause I had a Chinese neighbor,

1258
01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:18.280
this lady named Jenny and she would always bring us stuff for Chinese New Year.

1259
01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:21.340
Right.
Happy for tennis,
Delia.
She'd always come over and say,
that

1260
01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:26.050
makes sense.
Okay.
That's what Jenny would say.
I hit her on the podcast years ago.

1261
01:19:26.051 --> 01:19:29.500
It was like the best podcasts ever recorded because she like would just ramble

1262
01:19:29.501 --> 01:19:33.130
on and on about stuff about Chinese new year and there's always things you can't

1263
01:19:33.131 --> 01:19:37.750
say.
You can't say anything.
I think the number four,
we never say four.

1264
01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:41.950
It's like extremely bad luck because if it's a square,
it's something,

1265
01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:44.920
it's really absurd.
Look man,
big time on luck.

1266
01:19:44.921 --> 01:19:49.480
And if you do something that is unlucky on Chinese new year,

1267
01:19:49.481 --> 01:19:53.680
it's like a curse.
If you do that to someone else,
you can basically curse them.

1268
01:19:53.681 --> 01:19:57.010
And she told me this and I thought this guy has said like,
um,

1269
01:19:57.250 --> 01:20:01.690
wishing you for more.
Like he said,
oh,
he said for,
he said the number four.

1270
01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:04.440
That's,
that's why I thought it was going to be like some weird thing.
Like what,

1271
01:20:04.441 --> 01:20:07.800
what's wrong with,
I can't say the number four.
I remember

1272
01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:11.370
<v 2>learning that in Vegas basically.</v>

1273
01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:16.520
Even the ones that don't appear to have any type of Asian influence or theme

1274
01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:22.230
casinos,
right.
Are All designed with Asian guests in mind.
Oh,

1275
01:20:22.231 --> 01:20:25.850
I'm sure.
Such a huge part of the gambling airfare.

1276
01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:30.750
And so it's like,
there was even,
MGM did a crazy thing,

1277
01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:34.950
uh,
like 10 years ago where they had an entrance that was,

1278
01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:39.060
I dunno if it was like a lion's mouth or something like that and a bunch of

1279
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:41.640
Asians were like,
this wouldn't go in there.
Like,
yeah,

1280
01:20:41.641 --> 01:20:44.310
they didn't like it and so they were like Tara Nasha down tomorrow.

1281
01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:47.080
Like they yeah,
they did it immediately.
They,

1282
01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:51.450
they adhere to whatever that you know,

1283
01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:54.570
part of the world wants because they're big part of,

1284
01:20:54.571 --> 01:20:57.930
of gambling on a number eight.
They're like eight,
eight,

1285
01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:01.130
eight everyone the license plate,
that's the most desirable one.
Eight.

1286
01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:06.040
<v 5>Lucky.
Yeah,
I think fours.
I'm pretty sure fours I'm lucky to have.
Okay,</v>

1287
01:21:06.041 --> 01:21:09.770
so let,
yeah,
to have an uneven number of dogs.
Yeah.

1288
01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:12.610
I remember I did a Chinese guy just so you know.
Yeah.

1289
01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:17.290
Had his sister had three dogs cause two or four is unlucky.
Wow.
There you go.

1290
01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:20.540
Three dogs.
I think some of it comes from the word.

1291
01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:25.850
If a word sounds like another word.
Hmm.
It's,
it's that.
It's that arbitrary.

1292
01:21:26.630 --> 01:21:30.850
Who knows?
Bros got a vibration test.
Yeah.
This camera's silly.

1293
01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:35.420
It does its own thing.
Why do you,
why do you have it?
Oh,

1294
01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:41.020
why did we do anything?
We do anything.
Why don't we have,

1295
01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:45.500
have you done movies,
man,
coach Breaux coverage coverage,

1296
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:48.560
it's different setup.
Okay.
Yeah.
You got Company and move.

1297
01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:53.440
Those are all the words I know.
I love a company move man.
Company and move.
Oh,

1298
01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:57.350
did the company move?
Oh God.
Okay.
Well we have base camp set up here.

1299
01:21:57.730 --> 01:22:01.010
We're going to push your call.
Actually we've got,
we've got forced calls.

1300
01:22:01.011 --> 01:22:05.060
Check the prelim audio Martini Shot Martini.

1301
01:22:05.130 --> 01:22:08.610
<v 2>Oh,

Um,

Okay.
Uh,

Am I in my mls?
Right.

1303
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.580
Mls middots sound without sound.
You know what that's from?

1304
01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:22.020
Meats is with a German,
right?
So it's because the German guy,

1305
01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:25.320
uh,
was the first guy that said it.
So they,

1306
01:22:25.470 --> 01:22:27.940
they have this expression is named mls,

1307
01:22:27.941 --> 01:22:31.860
those or movies saying modern led business.

1308
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:36.600
Can you play that video?
We watched it before Johnny came.
Uh,

Oh yeah,

yeah,
yeah.

1311
01:22:42.910 --> 01:22:45.350
I remember thinking about it and I want to see it again.
And then,
um,

1312
01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:49.390
we also have to have him a guest.
Oh my God,
I can't wait.

1313
01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:54.120
[inaudible] the audience is going to be folks,
those guys,
it's coming.
Yes.
Um,

1314
01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:56.600
how I know did it done?

1315
01:22:59.150 --> 01:23:01.830
I love this because I feel like it's somewhere like in Brussels or something.

1316
01:23:01.831 --> 01:23:02.950
Somewhere like that.
Elgin.

1317
01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:09.873
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1318
01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:11.373
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1319
01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:19.180
<v 5>That's incredible.
Where is this looks like as Europe somewhere.</v>

1320
01:23:19.181 --> 01:23:23.800
And did you see,
did you see her jump?
No,
I miss jump.
Watch her.

1321
01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:28.760
Which one?
I wanted short.
Jack.
How long game?
Right here.
Are you looking at it?

1322
01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:29.783
Yeah.

1323
01:23:37.010 --> 01:23:37.843
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1324
01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:43.390
<v 5>That's amazing.
That's like boogers and revenge of the nerds.
Yeah.
So incredible.</v>

1325
01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:48.600
Have you seen those homemade ship horns?
The people make shit porn.
The ship,
uh,

1326
01:23:48.670 --> 01:23:50.470
fall quarter and I saw one this morning.

1327
01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:51.890
That's the greatest thing I've ever seen.

1328
01:23:51.930 --> 01:23:56.260
Some guy in the back of his backyard in Kansas makes this horn at a PVC pipe and

1329
01:23:56.261 --> 01:23:59.260
an air compressor.
That sounds like a fucking cruise ship.

1330
01:23:59.261 --> 01:24:04.210
Just as docking really unbelievably loud.
Just like,

1331
01:24:05.670 --> 01:24:06.503
and it's,

1332
01:24:06.670 --> 01:24:11.670
you can tell this is loud as shit to imagine doing that in your apartment

1333
01:24:11.831 --> 01:24:15.930
complex.
Oh my God,
that's so cool.
It's so funny.

1334
01:24:17.170 --> 01:24:18.003
I think he does more.

1335
01:24:23.950 --> 01:24:27.660
That's a talent that is a real skill.
You see the girls run away.

1336
01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:33.130
That's going to be a match with a certain type of disease as well for bacterial

1337
01:24:33.191 --> 01:24:38.030
infection.
Might need to see your dad.
Um,
so fiber,

1338
01:24:38.050 --> 01:24:39.460
we all know a kid that could do that.

1339
01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:42.900
These girls get so scared of high school and they decided to run the other way.

1340
01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:52.090
This is the kind of guy,
like in the 16th century,
he would be a warlord.
Yeah.

1341
01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:55.500
Like you would just run into a village and do that.
Like,
oh,
we are scared of him.

1342
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:56.970
Yeah.
Was it coming?

1343
01:24:57.770 --> 01:25:01.340
The king would either kill him or bring them around,
bring them around.

1344
01:25:01.341 --> 01:25:03.660
I want to see him do it again.
Bring in the man.

1345
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:12.930
It's like a dying goats or something like a giant.
He goes,
okay.

1346
01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:35.520
The most popular guy in high school for sure.
Yeah.

1347
01:25:35.970 --> 01:25:38.160
There's always the guy that can do this early in life.

1348
01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:40.350
You discover these talents early.

1349
01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:44.850
I knew a guy used to be to suck in air to his ass and just fart.
Sure.
Unlimited.

1350
01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:47.610
I knew a girl that could queef on command.
Uh,

1351
01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:49.500
I knew I kid like kid burp like that.

1352
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:53.940
I had a roommate that could suck air through his ass and Fart.
Sure.
And you know,

1353
01:25:53.941 --> 01:25:54.900
who did it used to do burps?

1354
01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:59.160
Burps are really big like that were Brian and Jeanette.
Really?
Oh Jeanette.

1355
01:25:59.190 --> 01:26:04.070
Definitely.
Really?
She's been on the show,
but the brain deep verb,

1356
01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:06.690
when there's a woman that can do it,
she's exceptional.
Yeah.

1357
01:26:06.691 --> 01:26:09.200
There was a girl in my high school that could do it.
Yeah,

1358
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:12.390
she could do the alphabet.
It was pretty amazing.
Right.
The opposite.
I have,

1359
01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:16.940
I [inaudible] sound like a little lizard just died.
It's like they're terrible.

1360
01:26:16.941 --> 01:26:17.774
This sound like a,

1361
01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:21.350
like the crypt keeper or something like that and be like Gollum.
They're just,

1362
01:26:21.351 --> 01:26:24.080
they're really gross.
I hate them.
I'll do it.
I'll forget.

1363
01:26:24.081 --> 01:26:26.230
I have that burp and I'll do it around like a,

1364
01:26:26.290 --> 01:26:29.510
like a friend I'm comfortable with and I'm like,
are you okay?
And it sounds,

1365
01:26:29.511 --> 01:26:30.344
it sounds bad.

1366
01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:32.710
<v 11>[inaudible] guys.
I don't have a man of video in a while,</v>

1367
01:26:32.711 --> 01:26:36.160
but I'm to make it out to you because this year I've come up with something

1368
01:26:36.161 --> 01:26:40.750
called the super and super purpose where I saw all in a lot of air.

1369
01:26:40.810 --> 01:26:44.110
I wait till it sinks down into my stomach and then I saw the more air because it

1370
01:26:44.111 --> 01:26:46.450
makes her up instead of just barfing up.
Right.
Oh,
right away.

1371
01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:50.010
<v 5>So give me a little bit,
be patient.</v>

1372
01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:55.220
It's really painful to,
so it's hard to watch her federal and load it up.

1373
01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:58.640
Is that what she's wearing?
Her prom dress.
Nice.
Yeah.
Here we go.

1374
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:01.340
I hate the buildup to it.
Yeah,

1375
01:27:06.010 --> 01:27:08.530
it was loud.
I feel like really good.
No,

1376
01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:11.510
that's really good.

1377
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:20.103
<v 11>All right.</v>

1378
01:27:20.370 --> 01:27:23.440
<v 5>She could rival the guy.
What about the king?
I didn't realize that.</v>

1379
01:27:23.441 --> 01:27:27.810
He's got a corner right here it is.
Yeah.
Two liter.

1380
01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:33.420
Two liter.
This is king ass.
Repor Jun.
Yeah.

1381
01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:39.300
His perhaps aren't as good as,
as far as,
as far as our,

1382
01:27:39.330 --> 01:27:44.280
that's where his talent is.
Yeah.
I'm from Brooklyn.
I don't think he's just,

1383
01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:51.960
God Damn God damn.
He's got food on his shirt.

1384
01:27:52.850 --> 01:27:57.470
The animal that's by design though,
right?
Yeah.
Mean he stopped himself,

1385
01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:02.360
but he really goes really crazy.
You see a professional eater?
Yeah,

1386
01:28:02.530 --> 01:28:04.670
a lot.
And then a foreign fighter.

1387
01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:09.590
I watched a guy once eat five chipotle burritos and five minutes.
Wow.

1388
01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:12.650
Like in the state of nature.
And it was almost one of these guys,

1389
01:28:12.651 --> 01:28:14.380
one of these youtube guys.
No.

1390
01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:18.220
Like a power eater gotta be sick immediately after that.
Wow.

1391
01:28:18.930 --> 01:28:22.610
I've in five minutes.
Yeah.
It was something where it doesn't seem,

1392
01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:26.960
because they're so dense.
Right.
Does it seem humanly possible?
But I guess that's,

1393
01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:30.650
that's why we train.
That's why it's true actually true Kobayashi.

1394
01:28:30.730 --> 01:28:33.710
Those hearts are getting guys,
they do train.
You gotta stretch it,

1395
01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:38.120
stretch your stomach.
One of the competitive food ears and I didn't realize,

1396
01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:41.510
I was like,
Oh man,
how does that stuff pass through?
You think it was like,
oh no,

1397
01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:44.900
we could all puke it up.
And I'm like,
what a waste.

1398
01:28:45.290 --> 01:28:49.820
So just making it a dog food or something.
I do something with it.
Right.

1399
01:28:49.850 --> 01:28:50.451
They should do that.

1400
01:28:50.451 --> 01:28:53.750
They should actually vomit up all that stuff and make like a certain type of dog

1401
01:28:53.751 --> 01:28:58.000
food or horse food or something.
Yeah.
My dog would eat that.

1402
01:28:58.370 --> 01:29:02.080
He did a second bit.
Oh,
well we'll get vomit.
Oh,
I'm in

1403
01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:05.520
<v 4>food.
Yes.
Oh,
thank you daddy</v>

1404
01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:11.460
food.
They love anything.
My dog drank half a drink,

1405
01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:14.690
10 ounces of salmon oil.
One night we came home,

1406
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:18.750
I left the salmon oil,
buy her food on the floor thinking,
oh,

1407
01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:20.730
just because we put this in their food,

1408
01:29:20.850 --> 01:29:23.550
it doesn't mean that she's going to think it's your food.
No,
of course not.

1409
01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:26.280
She tore it open.
The carpets ruined the house,

1410
01:29:26.281 --> 01:29:27.780
smells like a fucking fish restaurant.

1411
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:33.950
She vomited multiple times in eight to vomit again and she was,

1412
01:29:34.021 --> 01:29:35.910
she was sick for 48 hours.

1413
01:29:35.911 --> 01:29:39.270
It was like we thought she was going to fucking die from drinking all the salmon

1414
01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:43.140
post to put two pumps in their food and she had like the most,

1415
01:29:43.141 --> 01:29:46.930
the entire bottle of it.
And she kept,
even,
even after,

1416
01:29:46.931 --> 01:29:49.860
like even after we got home and we took care of everything and gave her charcoal

1417
01:29:49.861 --> 01:29:52.560
pills,
she's still a,

1418
01:29:52.561 --> 01:29:54.960
I think she vomited up and ate some more of it.

1419
01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:59.790
<v 2>Why do they eat the Barf?
That's the worst smell.
Good.</v>

1420
01:29:59.791 --> 01:30:04.020
It's like Jesus,
right?
Fifo got into some toms the other day,

1421
01:30:04.050 --> 01:30:08.400
but he didn't puke.
Puke can be like,
that looks good.
I know.

1422
01:30:08.430 --> 01:30:10.740
It's the worst I would,
I would eat,

1423
01:30:11.050 --> 01:30:13.890
I would do if I was a dog at 8:00 PM I would not eat pig.

1424
01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:17.670
What if it was like you a bunch?
I don't.
Oh,

1425
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:21.580
she's got a real aversion to puking.
Yeah.
I have a kind of a phobia.
Wait,

1426
01:30:21.581 --> 01:30:23.970
we almost,
I almost fucking forgot again.
Okay.

1427
01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:27.840
So she's got big all hangers on it,
a huge tits.

1428
01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:32.310
And I'm pregnant too,
that a lot of speculation.

1429
01:30:32.311 --> 01:30:35.550
I've got big tits even before I got pregnant.
I've always had big tits,

1430
01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:39.900
always has fucking grading or fifth grade and she's nice.
Always had big tits.

1431
01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:43.080
So a few weeks ago she's like,
God,
you know what I mean?
She's always like,

1432
01:30:43.081 --> 01:30:46.710
my back hurts,
these tastes are so big.
I got to slice these things off.

1433
01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:49.670
And I don't say that I just slice them off,

1434
01:30:49.950 --> 01:30:52.380
but they're getting bigger with some off pregnancy.

1435
01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:54.390
I want to get a reduction down yet.

1436
01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:56.910
So they're getting big with pregnancy and then she goes,

1437
01:30:56.940 --> 01:30:58.050
how much you think my tits way.

1438
01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:01.650
So I'm sitting down and she's standing up and I reached my hand up and I was

1439
01:31:01.651 --> 01:31:05.190
like,
I dunno,
like 15 pounds or something.
It's a huge,
yeah.

1440
01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:08.910
And so we start talking about on the show and then we talk about how about like

1441
01:31:08.911 --> 01:31:12.060
how can we actually get these things legit weighed.

1442
01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:17.120
So people start sending in ideas and then one of them was doing meat scales.

1443
01:31:17.130 --> 01:31:20.400
Yeah.
Like a good idea.
That was like,
that makes sense.
Yeah,
that'd be a good one.

1444
01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:22.260
We also thought that actually we always,

1445
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:26.080
we as without the local whole foods would be into it.
You know the sponsorship.

1446
01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:27.660
Sure.
Just go in there,

1447
01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:31.910
drop that big old slop or on that food scale and see what it was.
Yeah.

1448
01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:34.620
But then we realized,
you know,
maybe they won't.

1449
01:31:34.621 --> 01:31:39.550
So we ordered a food scale and we brought it to the we,
we,

1450
01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:44.660
we brought out the hangars and we put the milk flaps on the foods and the studio

1451
01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:49.260
before you came today.
Now it's an inexact science.
Of course.

1452
01:31:49.290 --> 01:31:53.270
Obviously there's a margin of error here because of what about my force without

1453
01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:56.880
my pushing down.
And you know,
it's,
it's an imperfect science.

1454
01:31:56.881 --> 01:32:00.100
So I think we got kind of an estimate here on what

1455
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:04.960
<v 5>these hangers way Johnny,
take a look.
What do you think is your wife?</v>

1456
01:32:04.961 --> 01:32:08.290
Big chested or something,
but she's not pregnant.
What size?

1457
01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:11.500
So he knows what he's looking at.
Okay.
So before I was pregnant,

1458
01:32:11.501 --> 01:32:12.840
they were quadruple ds.

1459
01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:16.210
Now they're even beggars that exponential with the DIY thing.

1460
01:32:16.211 --> 01:32:20.730
Cause it's like how many days until you get to the e four.

1461
01:32:20.731 --> 01:32:24.620
So it goes four days and then the next size up is an e.
Okay.
So you're on,

1462
01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:29.110
you're on the cusp of a d no,
girl,
I'm sorry.
I'm on the cusp of Drupal now.

1463
01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:33.680
Now I am an as I am and here he adjacent quadrupled.

1464
01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:38.680
D.
S.
L.
U.
T.
E.
Okay,
got it.

1465
01:32:38.681 --> 01:32:43.670
Yeah.
The triple DSL.
Ut those are big.
Okay.
So how much does that weigh?
What,

1466
01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:47.830
what'd you say?
I'm telling you.
We're talking about one GAM.
One,
one man.
Okay.

1467
01:32:48.010 --> 01:32:52.190
We'll talk about a single one.
Not the,
not collective.
Okay.
Rob.
Rob,
Rob,

1468
01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:56.860
Jesus Christ.
I'm going to guess.
Um,
okay.

1469
01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:59.240
Uh,
hugs.

1470
01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:04.280
How much do I have to narrow it down to there's two breasts and we weighed them

1471
01:33:05.741 --> 01:33:10.210
both separately.
I think you can guess.
You don't have to be like the left one.

1472
01:33:10.211 --> 01:33:14.650
Is this the right one?
Is that you just have to guess one number.
Cumulus and,
Oh,

1473
01:33:14.651 --> 01:33:16.380
you wanted him to guess.
I mean like it,

1474
01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:20.480
it's very difficult to gauge what each one individually,
what's it,

1475
01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:23.500
the cumulative.
What do you,
what do you think both of these honkers together,

1476
01:33:23.501 --> 01:33:27.730
what am I carrying on my chest?
What is,
what was your initial gas before?

1477
01:33:27.731 --> 01:33:31.210
Like way back was your initial guests.
Initial guests was like 15 pounds,

1478
01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:33.580
15 pounds each.
Well,
I did think that,

1479
01:33:33.790 --> 01:33:38.230
I did think that too high.
That's not even possible.
I don't know.

1480
01:33:38.230 --> 01:33:40.930
But I thought gravity,
we just pull me to the floor.
I know.
I'm,

1481
01:33:40.931 --> 01:33:45.760
I say I'm going to say a seven pounds co collective,
but no one each seven.

1482
01:33:45.810 --> 01:33:50.580
Seven.
Wow.
No,
no,
I,
it's hard.

1483
01:33:50.610 --> 01:33:54.310
It's so hard because my dog is so big.
It's like a thing where,
you know,

1484
01:33:54.311 --> 01:33:56.560
I think about animal weight,
right?

1485
01:33:56.650 --> 01:34:01.240
And I'm so strong that like I pick up my heavy dog and it's like,

1486
01:34:01.890 --> 01:34:02.690
um,
I will,

1487
01:34:02.690 --> 01:34:07.170
I'm going to have to say five and a half as the cumulative Cayman's know as
each,

1488
01:34:07.171 --> 01:34:10.020
each breast is five and a half.
Oh Wow.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.

1489
01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:13.360
That's my final answer.
The final answer.
And you,
well,
I mean,
I know,

1490
01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:14.591
oh that's right.

1491
01:34:14.591 --> 01:34:19.591
But before you said about 15 and I guessed about it feels about 10 to 15 so

1492
01:34:20.301 --> 01:34:24.640
your,
your final answer is five and a half each.
Each meaning 11 total.
Yeah.

1493
01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:26.870
Okay.
Well here we go.
You ready to

1494
01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:32.620
get ready for it?
The Deli scale

1495
01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:38.570
milkers we call crackers.
We have start with the righty.

1496
01:34:40.510 --> 01:34:41.343
The lesser.

1497
01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:46.540
So now as is common with most women,

1498
01:34:46.570 --> 01:34:50.070
my boobs are not perfectly symmetrical.
One is bigger than the,

1499
01:34:50.071 --> 01:34:53.050
is a little bit of of a breast meat.

1500
01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:59.420
Let me see.
Okay.
I can get it out.
Nevermind.
I could get it out.
Please get it out.

1501
01:34:59.421 --> 01:35:00.050
Yeah,
go on.

1502
01:35:00.050 --> 01:35:04.680
These people seeing my sloppers the funky dunkers you mean fuck it.

1503
01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:07.070
Younger ready?
My favorite new when you were younger.

1504
01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:09.953
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1505
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:13.240
<v 5>That is my right breast.</v>

1506
01:35:13.241 --> 01:35:17.530
That is 2.16 pounds.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1507
01:35:17.630 --> 01:35:22.210
I totally overshot.
Didn't way [inaudible] feels like five.
Like and again,

1508
01:35:22.211 --> 01:35:25.600
we might not be doing it correctly.
Well,
here's the thing is that the skill,

1509
01:35:25.630 --> 01:35:29.400
you know,
fluctuated,
but I'm kind of just rounding,
um,
I feel as though it's,

1510
01:35:29.401 --> 01:35:32.200
it's an,
it's an accurate enough.
Did you,
uh,

1511
01:35:32.230 --> 01:35:35.950
did you have it where the breasts was a,

1512
01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:39.790
wasn't obviously,
it wasn't so high as to have it be,

1513
01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:42.510
you're below the scale.
You're not doing that,

1514
01:35:42.990 --> 01:35:47.710
which are also high enough to where I guess you know what it feels like for the

1515
01:35:47.711 --> 01:35:50.880
full [inaudible] was at chest level.
Like it was right there.

1516
01:35:50.910 --> 01:35:53.920
But it's also this thing,
it's like what?
Where does the breasts begin?

1517
01:35:54.690 --> 01:35:57.810
All right God,
I do what I wanted to do to do by the way.
Yeah.

1518
01:35:58.210 --> 01:36:02.770
I want to do it standing where the breasts is that where the countertop is,

1519
01:36:02.771 --> 01:36:04.720
let's say.
Right.
And you just go boom.

1520
01:36:04.750 --> 01:36:06.590
That's just how did you do it then we did it.

1521
01:36:07.690 --> 01:36:10.030
But a CD you gotta stand cause you get,

1522
01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:13.690
it's like of all things you got to stand it.
But listen,
here's the thing,

1523
01:36:13.691 --> 01:36:14.680
what's the difference between,

1524
01:36:14.710 --> 01:36:17.710
it's not going to fluctuate between two and five pounds.

1525
01:36:17.711 --> 01:36:20.980
If I'm sitting or standing,
I feel as though this is an accurate approximation.

1526
01:36:21.010 --> 01:36:24.790
Let's just try it again.
So here,
that was the rest of the system.
This is righty.

1527
01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:25.451
Okay.

1528
01:36:25.451 --> 01:36:30.451
And then here is this battle and this is the big three point big fluctuation.

1529
01:36:31.210 --> 01:36:33.730
One seven.
So one is a full pounder,

1530
01:36:34.330 --> 01:36:38.310
which is actually true because this one is an entire cup size larger.
Yeah,

1531
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:39.400
always my whole life.

1532
01:36:39.401 --> 01:36:44.200
So I've had to get a cup size smaller to go for both of you guys want to tell

1533
01:36:44.201 --> 01:36:46.510
you I'm not the most romantic guy or anything,

1534
01:36:46.511 --> 01:36:49.960
but you got a huge tits that ain't no shit.

1535
01:36:50.490 --> 01:36:52.840
Expand interrupting.

1536
01:36:54.730 --> 01:36:58.330
And there's a medical doctor out there that will in the Los Angeles area that

1537
01:36:58.331 --> 01:37:00.840
will weigh my breasts more accurately if you want.

1538
01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:04.060
Do you want to go see a medical doctor that listens to this?
And that's true.

1539
01:37:04.061 --> 01:37:06.670
That's true.
And he was like,
Yo,
well your tits for you.
Why now?

1540
01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:11.620
Like Trump's doctor,
that guy,
that guy is so awesome man.
You do anything.
Yeah.

1541
01:37:12.250 --> 01:37:13.640
Well I think this is a nice,

1542
01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:18.720
it's a roundabout also the grand total of those was like five point what it was

1543
01:37:19.361 --> 01:37:23.560
it five and change how points from it feels about right.
Yeah.
So if you're,

1544
01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:25.080
if you're per

1545
01:37:25.690 --> 01:37:26.523
<v 1>mmm.</v>

1546
01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:29.020
<v 5>If your guests of the chemo native wait,</v>

1547
01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:32.620
was the actual your guests of the each weight.
Yeah,
you would.

1548
01:37:32.630 --> 01:37:36.050
You'd have been spot on.
Yeah,
I guess I just don't know what breasts way.

1549
01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:38.810
I know and I,
and I really do want to try the standing method.

1550
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:40.820
I just want to see if it changes your honor it let's do it tonight.

1551
01:37:40.850 --> 01:37:44.510
It's all because he,
I guess I forget that that type of tissue is not right.

1552
01:37:44.511 --> 01:37:46.580
Dance.
Well why?

1553
01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:50.930
Well yeah now it's getting full of milky and stuff to the milk ducts because of

1554
01:37:50.931 --> 01:37:55.190
the baby.
Yeah.
Milky.
He's on there all milky

1555
01:37:56.930 --> 01:38:00.570
way when they're going to be fully in gorged with Milliken.
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

1556
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:05.280
Well now you can chart your progress.
I can like you can try your progress.

1557
01:38:05.281 --> 01:38:08.460
This might be some sort of breakthrough breast cancer research.
Actually.

1558
01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:12.870
That's a really good idea.
And keep a chart.
Yeah,
I like that.

1559
01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:14.970
You could have a chart on the wall.
Yeah.

1560
01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:19.320
Next to every song is wait your son's height.
You can put it next to it.

1561
01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:22.830
It's a really good idea when you were this tall.
My breasts weighed this much.

1562
01:38:24.630 --> 01:38:25.463
It's a really good point.

1563
01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:29.190
I think five is about right cause there's this video people sent us about

1564
01:38:29.191 --> 01:38:33.790
animals and how much the animal weighs and comparison to the breast.
And uh,

1565
01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:37.320
it seems about right cause my,
my ted sizes like two chickens.

1566
01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:42.600
That's what this video said.
I love chickens.
Yeah.
I need to,
chickens are great.

1567
01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:47.460
So there you go.
Big Mystery.
Big,
uh,
big reveal guys.

1568
01:38:48.730 --> 01:38:53.610
Um,
okay.
What do you look for gene?
I was looking for a song.
Oh,
an outro?

1569
01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:57.930
Yeah,
I found it.
That's a lot of weight to carry around.

1570
01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:01.830
I got to get these fuckers reduced.
Uh,
Johnny Pemberton and working people.

1571
01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:05.290
See you Amy.
Action points.
Yeah.
Action

1572
01:39:05.290 --> 01:39:09.120
<v 4>Park.
When it comes out.
Action Point.
I always get confused.
I get come.</v>

1573
01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:13.030
You were right.
I was wrong.
All right.
Ah,
you know,
Instagram,
Youtube.

1574
01:39:13.031 --> 01:39:17.290
I post a lot of videos on youtube.com/just my nipples.

1575
01:39:17.330 --> 01:39:21.970
Oh really?
Yeah.
And um,
Instagram,
I post videos on there.

1576
01:39:21.971 --> 01:39:25.720
It's just Johnny underscore Pemberton and I've got an album coming out on

1577
01:39:25.721 --> 01:39:28.720
Starburns audio.
And uh,
where's your recording?
Oh,

1578
01:39:28.721 --> 01:39:31.930
well it's actually a compilation of all the best prank phone calls.

1579
01:39:31.931 --> 01:39:35.860
I've done love prank phone calls.
I have some of them on my youtube channel,

1580
01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:38.620
but most of them are just going to be on the album.
It will be on,

1581
01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:39.670
it's going to be on a cassette.

1582
01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:42.940
They have a cassette club that's also going to be available digitally cause

1583
01:39:42.941 --> 01:39:46.750
obviously,
uh,
cassettes or cassettes.
So that's amazing.
So do you,

1584
01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:48.590
do you do calls regularly?
Yeah,

1585
01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:51.550
I've been doing them for a long time and I do mostly,

1586
01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:54.340
they're not prank phone calls.
They're more like a,

1587
01:39:54.341 --> 01:39:57.910
I called customer service places and um,

1588
01:39:58.330 --> 01:40:01.450
kind of engage with people in a way that I think they're not used to being

1589
01:40:01.451 --> 01:40:03.940
engaged with.
That's great.
I got to hear some of them.

1590
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:06.130
Give me an idea of like what kind of,

1591
01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:11.220
just like I always pretend to be a guy named Kevin tip corn and I usually call

1592
01:40:11.530 --> 01:40:15.280
with like a legit complaint about something and it just sort of starts to get

1593
01:40:15.281 --> 01:40:18.100
really absurd and I ask a lot of personal questions like what you're having for

1594
01:40:18.101 --> 01:40:22.660
lunch.
And,
uh,
I just get really,
like there's one,

1595
01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:27.340
I basically just tried to get weird people out to the point where they are

1596
01:40:27.341 --> 01:40:29.980
trying to stop the call,
but I know that they can't,

1597
01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:33.940
I used to work in call centers.
I know how it works,
the politics of it.

1598
01:40:34.540 --> 01:40:36.370
So yeah,
I called like Aveda,

1599
01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:40.930
I'm complaining about these little ball like scrubbing balls inside the shampoo,

1600
01:40:41.380 --> 01:40:43.750
talking about how he look like lice and trying to get through to the girl starts

1601
01:40:43.751 --> 01:40:47.550
talking about her hair care and stuff.
And I have one cognitive uh,

1602
01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:51.940
calling the police,
asking them like weird questions about their phone system.

1603
01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:54.040
It's a strip club call with a guy.

1604
01:40:54.041 --> 01:40:58.210
I just went on about asking all these questions like country kind of a glove and

1605
01:40:58.211 --> 01:41:02.470
can I like kind of worse 20 to wear shorts and he just is indulging me for some

1606
01:41:02.471 --> 01:41:05.530
weird reason.
The constantly I called Halliburton,

1607
01:41:05.531 --> 01:41:09.070
somebody Halliburton talks about chem trails and all kinds of shit like that.

1608
01:41:09.071 --> 01:41:11.740
It's great man.
Yeah,
it's called,
uh,
it's called,
um,

1609
01:41:11.890 --> 01:41:15.910
recorded for quality assurance.
Nice.
Great.
All right,
so look for it,

1610
01:41:16.090 --> 01:41:21.000
look for it a go.
See the movie action point actually?
Yeah.

1611
01:41:21.001 --> 01:41:22.850
Yeah.

<v 9>My jeans near my son.
I'm your mom.</v>

1620
01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:55.010
You're my son.
I'm your mom asked them,

1621
01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:57.150
ask them when you do update your mom.

01:42:00.150 --> 01:42:04.860
Yes.
I would hear my son.
I'm your mom.

1623
01:42:05.070 --> 01:42:09.960
It's just like the gaze,
just like,
just like the gate.

1624
01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:12.960
I looked at her and she looked at me

1625
01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:21.530
because like the gate,
once my wife calls me,
mom,
you,

1626
01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:25.110
I mean,

when I asked him,
when you,

1628
01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:34.860
I looked at her and she looked at me and hear my son,

1629
01:42:35.670 --> 01:42:37.990
I'm your mom.
Just like the gate

1630
01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:45.690
the gate.
Ask them,

1631
01:42:45.691 --> 01:42:49.440
will you pass pass,
pass.
It's just like the gays.
