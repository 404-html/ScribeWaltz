118
00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:04.290
Don't bring it

119
00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.820
to your mom.
So

120
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:16.043
Christina.

121
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:24.803
Okay,

122
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.660
I got your own water.

123
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.840
Hold on.
I know you're reaching

124
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:56.610
<v 3>or my water,</v>

125
00:10:56.611 --> 00:11:01.230
but I brought you a more appropriate size water have for your water intake.

126
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.170
You had to use both hands like Ellis does.

127
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.930
Is that good?
It's nice and warm.
It's from the sink.
It's tap water.
Jesus,

128
00:11:15.931 --> 00:11:18.090
you jerk.
You couldn't even give me regular water here up.

129
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:22.680
I'll put the good stuff in there for it.
Yeah.
You kind of drank a lot of that.

130
00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:25.680
You must not have been drinking that much this morning.
No,
I'm uh,

131
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.600
I'm drinking coffee right now.
You know why?

132
00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:31.890
Because I'm super tired from drinking so much water.
Sure.

133
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.490
What color was your p this morning?
You're finished your city.

134
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:40.560
It was so clear that like trans,
it was just transparent,
whatever.

135
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.650
You don't even know this yet.
I haven't told you,
but yeah,

136
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.940
I installed this thing we got is called the the bowl glow.

137
00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:53.580
That's a stupid little device you put in the toilet and it lights up the water

138
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:58.660
at night so you can see the toilet.
It can be any color.
Red,

139
00:11:58.661 --> 00:12:01.060
blue,
green.
That's what that thing is.
Yeah.

140
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.480
So I was thinking how fun it would be if it's like,
you know,

141
00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:08.530
if it's blue and then you make the water green with you,

142
00:12:08.531 --> 00:12:13.180
it's going to be like a dark green.
No,
no.
With Neil stay blue.

143
00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:17.080
Yeah.
It'll be like,
oh,
it's clear.
It doesn't even turn into anything.

144
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.500
I should have made it red.
That's normally what you see today.

145
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.770
This weekend with water.
With fitness actually.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Really?
No Sir.

146
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:29.140
I don't worry about it.
Okay.
Well I landed and Gosh,
Ceville Nashville,
Tennessee.

147
00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:35.200
Uh,
I worked out every day.
They're good for you Thursday?
I did.

148
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:39.880
Uh,
what did I do?
I did both.
It was split day,
so I did like cardio and weights.

149
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.650
Friday only weights and Saturday cardio.
Wow.

150
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:48.460
I did it like two hours before my shows so I could work out.
Then you shower,

151
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.420
you little something,

152
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.810
go to the show and I just drank just ridiculous amounts of water.

153
00:12:52.811 --> 00:12:57.400
Plus it was hot as fuck.
That'll make you drink a lot of water.
It's true.

154
00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:00.910
I did.
I drank a lot of water this week.
Wow.
Good for you.
See that.

155
00:13:00.911 --> 00:13:05.110
That's like a notable thing for you because I drink water all the time and I got

156
00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:07.510
up
every morning.

157
00:13:07.511 --> 00:13:10.520
I wake up at 5:00 AM before the kid wakes up and I hit the weights.

158
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:16.450
Even see me down there in the garage because I heard you say massage for my 40th

159
00:13:16.451 --> 00:13:21.090
birthday,
my BFF Shauna came and we went to Bark Williams.
Happy Smurf Day.

160
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:26.320
21 years old.
You went to Burke Williams did everything to do with that.

161
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.810
She says,
you know,

162
00:13:28.811 --> 00:13:33.811
thank you for my mom's side and they tag on my nails and my toes and they,

163
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:39.390
they go,
now you're gonna want to hydrate Africa toxin.

164
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.930
But the lady,
when she whispered in my ear,
her breath was really bad.

165
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.580
I'm a serious.
Did she go,

166
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.410
he'll probably want to drink a little more cause I can tell you

167
00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:56.090
no,
but then she goes,
you're my favorite.
No Shit.
Then she kissed me on the floor.

168
00:13:56.091 --> 00:13:59.200
No,
she did.
They don't do that for you there.
Yeah,

169
00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.910
but I thought I was their favorite.
So she actually went,
she went

170
00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.650
and her breasts dog so bad.
I know.

171
00:14:08.651 --> 00:14:11.780
Don't whisper in my ear if you're breastfeeding,
that's brutal.
You know,

172
00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:16.480
I just did an Uber ride with a driver whose breath wafted over across,

173
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:22.030
you know,
the console is like Jesus,
man.
Get your entire life.

174
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.100
Now this piece of shit video you made,

175
00:14:24.101 --> 00:14:28.360
I saw an Instagram or are you threatening me with,
you're like,
oh,

176
00:14:28.361 --> 00:14:31.060
I drank more than just a reminder that I'm the water champion.

177
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:36.630
I flew to Nashville sitting next to R and B legend Jill Scott,

178
00:14:37.271 --> 00:14:41.740
by the way.
So my black celebrity status continues.
Yeah,
that's neat.

179
00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:46.780
I told her about it about that.
That was like,
when I hear my list,
she goes,
yes,

180
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:50.710
we talked like most of the flight and she,
she goes,
yeah,
I go,
so I list her,

181
00:14:50.711 --> 00:14:55.160
but she of course,
most impressed by Tyson.
That is that.
That's a good yet.
I go,

182
00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:56.810
you're on the list now.
And she was like,
okay,

183
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.610
now do you have a funny story with her?

184
00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:03.440
She was so lovely and just like just,
she's a poet and a,

185
00:15:03.441 --> 00:15:04.070
you know,

186
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:09.070
she just talks about being centered and balanced and happy and not needing

187
00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:13.220
everything to feel happy and like,
wow,
that's fair.
Very fun call.

188
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:14.620
She was very cool.
No,

189
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.250
you issued a little video statements saying that you drink more water.

190
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:23.410
I have a retort.
I'd like to finally make an official retort.

191
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.810
You've been a tag and make you this with you.
Did you guys work on this together?

192
00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:28.821
It feels,
I know,

193
00:15:28.821 --> 00:15:32.180
but I'm telling you that I am sick of the attacks on social media.

194
00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:37.420
And finally this video will prove who is the real water drinking champion.

195
00:15:39.121 --> 00:15:42.470
Just remember I,
okay.
Schnitzel.

196
00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.760
Cause she's saying she,
she's a glass of water rights,

197
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.620
which makes the most of the water.
She's got her little,

198
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.610
her little hamster feed her in her cage.
I'm a little concerned about this.

199
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:54.140
Should I set this up?

200
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:59.770
This is going to definitively answer who's the more drinker of the waters in

201
00:16:00.051 --> 00:16:02.780
this house?
Which one is it looks like there's two in here.

202
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:08.110
Oh it says three 49 underscore video or three 48 underscore water underscore

203
00:16:08.781 --> 00:16:13.610
drinking.
Uh,
three 49.
Yeah,
three frame.
Okay.
Just so you know.

204
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:19.400
Okay.
So we're doing this.
Just see,
should I set it up a little bit?

205
00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:22.370
Can you tell me,
well Tom,

206
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:27.470
I decided to surveil your actual water drinking habits.

207
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:29.030
What?
Yeah,

208
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:34.780
I have footage from the last episode of Your Mom's house and let's see who

209
00:16:35.331 --> 00:16:38.120
really drank more water.
Oh man,
you're so dead.

210
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.770
It was so dead with my weight.

211
00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:45.130
My response videos absolutely massacre you.
Well,

212
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.610
let's see who drank more water and the last episode of Your Mom's house.
Kelly?

213
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:53.570
Yes.
What is she?
Parking?
Brake marking and our video.
Okay.

214
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:59.330
Hmm.
How has music?
Yeah.
Okay.

215
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:07.430
All right.
Which mommy drinks more water?
Has what?
It says there is me.

216
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:11.190
I got one so far drinking the first time.
There's that one.

217
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:15.730
<v 6>I got two,
two times.</v>

218
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.270
I got three.
Tom's one right now.

219
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:27.220
Alright.
He's got to,
I can already tell you the floor and your video

220
00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.200
<v 3>got three.
I've got four.
Can I tell you the flaw in that?</v>

221
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:35.440
There's no fraud drinking so much more than you.
You can tell.

222
00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.420
You can tell.
You're really going to contest.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

223
00:17:38.421 --> 00:17:40.670
You can tell like yours,
just like,
like,

224
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.100
like you're just like a bitsy sit like and I'm like blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

225
00:17:44.101 --> 00:17:45.500
blah,
blah.
Yeah.
Whatever.

226
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:51.120
<v 6>The record shop.
I'm at five,
five times drinking.
You're only a three.</v>

227
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:56.160
You're four,

228
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.530
six,
four,

229
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.710
seven.
I'm at seven and we're still at four.

230
00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.360
Oh,
I'm an eight.
And you're still at four.
I've

231
00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.660
with what you drank on the last episode.

232
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:25.980
I drank doubling.

233
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:30.420
It's an old song on the record

234
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.320
<v 3>so that was blue man.
Thank you man for making that second.</v>

235
00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:42.480
I drink double what you drank on the last episode.
Secondly,
first of all,

236
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:43.950
I mean people,

237
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:48.060
I feel like they can see this and they can see them in the population.

238
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:51.990
That was honest.
I just asked him after the episode,

239
00:18:51.991 --> 00:18:53.070
why don't you put it together?

240
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:58.100
But I had an empty like 16 ounce bottle and that you had a still like half full

241
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
abi where you're like not well not sure cause I had to Amy on look at the backup

242
00:19:05.431 --> 00:19:09.300
water to go with my primary.
There's overwhelming online support.

243
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.970
I'm a lot of champion.
Yes there is.
I've been getting,

244
00:19:11.971 --> 00:19:15.950
a lot of people are just like I taught look at any posts down,

245
00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:20.320
Instagram,
Twitter.
They're like,
clearly Tom's the water champ.
Yeah,

246
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.850
that is so false.
If you look in my car,
just go down to my car.

247
00:19:23.851 --> 00:19:28.200
There's empty water bottles,
half bottles.
I hydrate constantly.

248
00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:32.040
I just knocked down that sippy cup like it was nothing.
That is nothing.

249
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.530
It's a baby baby cat up dummy.

250
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:41.090
That's so stupid and it's so wrong.
You just got a water changes,

251
00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:43.680
got molded and your booty exploded.
Here we go.

252
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:47.990
Well where's your water for it today?
It's here right now.
Okay.

253
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:55.200
Whenever
that's the point.
That's a sip for me.

254
00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:59.680
Well you're except for me is a fucking pint and the sip for you is like,

255
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:05.310
like a little baby step or a bear.
You are drink way more water.

256
00:20:05.311 --> 00:20:09.660
Five times my size and he'd drink five times less.
You're hydrated.

257
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:14.160
Inferior.
Hydrated fairy.
Yes.
Your age to know.

258
00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:19.350
Wow.
I'm age too.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.
Wow.

259
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.890
So I just want to make it clear that video is dog shit

260
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.580
and you're the dog shit.

261
00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:31.610
You're the water winter in the same sense that if I were to play basketball with

262
00:20:31.801 --> 00:20:33.900
our son right now,
I'd be like,
you're the winner too.
You know,

263
00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:38.880
I just put it in the basket mad because I burned you so good.
It's so,

264
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.830
so offensive.

265
00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:45.360
Moded and your booty exploded all over this water place.
Okay,

266
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.170
we'll see.
Yeah,

267
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:53.170
<v 0>we'll do a live contest coming up.
Legit.
It's already been done.</v>

268
00:20:53.171 --> 00:20:57.790
Legit.
You want to talk about what happened?
A burns fat.

269
00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.390
We can go there.
What did,
what did you want to talk about though?
Nashville.

270
00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.990
<v 3>Oh,
right.
So you,
you've met several celebrities in your life.
You've met your,</v>

271
00:21:05.991 --> 00:21:08.540
your Jill Scott.
Yup.
And that was awesome.

272
00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:11.270
You sat next to her and then you met another

273
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:14.420
<v 0>celebrity.
By the way,
a bunch of the titans came out and Tennessee titans,</v>

274
00:21:14.421 --> 00:21:19.220
football players,
a current and former really nice guys,
um,

275
00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:24.830
hung out with them.
So shout out to the titans.
Um,
yeah,

276
00:21:24.831 --> 00:21:27.980
so you're never going to believe this will you will now.

277
00:21:27.981 --> 00:21:32.910
But I think a lot of our audience will be blown away by this.
Um,

278
00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:37.670
throat Zilla came to a show Saturday.

279
00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.940
It was unexpected.
I,
I've seen her posts and things like,

280
00:21:43.941 --> 00:21:46.850
when are you doing a show here?
And I've just,
you know,
never,

281
00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:49.620
it never occurred to me that,
that she wouldn't,

282
00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.310
I saw a couple of posts that she said,
I'm coming to Nashville,
but you never,

283
00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:56.270
you know,
people post things on your wall and you're like,
okay.
Yeah.
Um,

284
00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.960
she bought a ticket.
She showed up and uh,

285
00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:04.850
she wore a shirt that said throat Zilla on it and then Google me.

286
00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:10.610
I'm so hoping somebody there,
it was like,

287
00:22:10.611 --> 00:22:14.000
I wonder what that means is it picks up their phone like Google.
Whoa.

288
00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.540
<v 3>Yeah.
She DMD me on Twitter.</v>

289
00:22:16.541 --> 00:22:21.130
Like I'm going to see your man wants his shirt size and yes.
And then he's,

290
00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:25.120
she's like,
there's too many people in line.
Oh,
really?
You meet your husband?

291
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:28.870
I was like,
what?
Wait though.
The woman who sucks Dick's professionally is like,

292
00:22:28.871 --> 00:22:29.710
it's too hard to see.

293
00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.240
<v 0>That's fine.
Maybe you shouldn't be damning.</v>

294
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:37.290
The wife I bought that throws with that.
How,
how uh,
pure her intention.
No,

295
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:38.700
I know.
I believe that.
Yeah.

296
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:44.110
But the funniest thing was that Friday I'm out with my friend Mike and his wife

297
00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:49.220
and I'd only briefly met his wife.
So now we're having dinner after the show.

298
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:54.510
And I actually,
since I'm just getting to know her,
I go,
how'd you guys meet?

299
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.740
And as she's telling me,
and that's usually a story that you're paying attention.

300
00:22:58.741 --> 00:23:01.460
You're pretty engaged.
My phone's lighting up and it's you.
Yeah.

301
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.440
So I just go like,
you know,
he's kind of look real quick and it says,

302
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.110
are you and your friends getting blown by throat Zillow right now?

303
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:11.610
And so I gotta I gotta I gotta answer this right?
Yeah.

304
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.510
So I tie it back to you like,
of course.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We're all,
we're all doing that.

305
00:23:15.511 --> 00:23:16.650
Whatever.
No,

306
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.460
and then she's continued with the story and then the phone lights up again and

307
00:23:20.461 --> 00:23:25.170
it's,
it's,
it's you.
Yeah.
And I keep going,
so I have to go.

308
00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:28.940
I'm sorry too.
I'm not trying to be rude here.
Um,

309
00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:33.360
but I think I got to call my wife.
She's like,
she goes,
no,

310
00:23:33.361 --> 00:23:36.990
of course it's your wife,
like color.
She has no idea what we talk about.

311
00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:39.660
So I tried to call you,
but of course we have no reception here.
Yeah.

312
00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.510
So I have to keep texting you.

313
00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.310
And then when I finally feel like,
cause don't,
you know,
with texts,

314
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.040
she actually had a good suggestion.
She's like,
I go,

315
00:23:49.041 --> 00:23:52.130
I can't tell what she's joking.
You know sometimes when we joke she goes,

316
00:23:52.131 --> 00:23:54.980
you're going to have like an Emoji that's code for a joke.
I'm like,
that's a,

317
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:58.570
that's a
serious or not serious.

318
00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:02.910
If I use emojis generally and the text exchange it means I'm no,

319
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:06.320
but what if you had one that meant this is,
but just so you know,

320
00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:11.290
generally if I'm using emojis it means I'm not really mad.
True.
So here is,

321
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:16.650
here's the exchange.
I go,
no,
she's not.
There you go.
Oh good.
I'm so happy.
My,

322
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:21.320
the blowjob lady is BFFs with my husband.
So I'm like pay.

323
00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:27.220
Yeah.
Hopefully she'll be getting ready for Josh with me.

324
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:29.900
And then you go,

325
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:34.560
how did this come about that she was making the trip to see a nice trip to man.

326
00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:38.300
I told this to Josh.
I've never seen him laugh so hard.
You Go,
great.

327
00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.570
So can I become friends with the pussy eating machine guy?

328
00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:49.580
And I go,
we are not friends.

329
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:53.750
And then you did put a bunch of emojis in eye rolling and one of the family

330
00:24:53.751 --> 00:24:57.230
Emoji.
Yeah.
Like remember your family,
please remember your family

331
00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.250
and your two dogs.

332
00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:07.160
Emoticons for dogs and for our child together.
And you go,

333
00:25:07.161 --> 00:25:08.450
please don't ruin our lives.

334
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.360
Like Babe,
you're killing me.

335
00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:17.480
And then you sent me a picture of you and our son.

336
00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:25.460
Well the best part was this,
that whole exchange then led to,

337
00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:28.390
I'm really likes this guy.

338
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:33.400
Know that whole exchange then led to me coming back to the table and of course

339
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:36.710
everything all right.
And I go,
Oh yeah,
you know,

340
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:40.580
my wife was just joking but I didn't know.
She was like,
oh she's,

341
00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:43.820
she makes a suggestion.
I go,
yeah,
this is this whole throat Zillow thing.

342
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.410
Like I'm sorry.

343
00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:50.690
So then I'm laying out the details of who throws Zilla is and I can see her face

344
00:25:50.691 --> 00:25:51.740
is like,
that's cool.

345
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:57.700
And I'm like realizing that our level of appropriate honor talk normal's a

346
00:25:59.541 --> 00:26:04.190
little skewed.
Yeah.
Especially for first time didn't like normal people.

347
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:07.460
The Blow Job Queen,
you know.
So

348
00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:13.340
anyways,
they were,
they were very nice people,
but I think I was horrified her,

349
00:26:13.341 --> 00:26:17.310
but oh and throw Sheila was very nice.
Yeah,
I know.
I know.
She has.

350
00:26:17.311 --> 00:26:20.940
How I finally got you to calm down.
I was like,
baby,
calm down.
I go telling,

351
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:25.310
you know you go,
come on man.
I go,
well first of all I'm going to have $400 on me.

352
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.680
And you're like,
oh,
okay.
I'm like,

353
00:26:27.681 --> 00:26:30.530
he could have led with that that I don't have hundreds of dollars,

354
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:35.870
hundreds of dollars to spend on blowjobs.
Gosh,
no,

355
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:40.550
I did have my fingers crossed for Josh to,
I'll be honest with you.

356
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.100
I actually did as well.
So what did she

357
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.490
<v 4>need Josh to or know what is is separation of church and state.</v>

358
00:26:47.491 --> 00:26:52.350
She was out for a night of just comedy and having gray.
She was off.

359
00:26:52.351 --> 00:26:55.530
She was off the clock,
so to speak.
This was when she met him and she was like,
oh,

360
00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:59.340
hi,
nice to meet you.
Like she was just nice and sweet lady.
Very nice.

361
00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:02.910
And it's what an exciting thing.
Josh was kind of excited.
He was like,
hello.

362
00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:06.910
He knew it was Josh,
by the way.
He's the one who introduced the whole story.

363
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.260
He started this again at Virginia Beach with,
I told her,
I go,

364
00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:14.160
Josh is the one maybe maybe reward them,
you know?
And she was like,

365
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:19.530
she just said goodbye and left.
But she sounded sweet actually.

366
00:27:19.531 --> 00:27:20.440
She was very nice.
Yeah.

367
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:24.600
I saw the picture of you two together and somebody saw the back of her head

368
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:29.700
picture somebody,
somebody goes,

369
00:27:29.701 --> 00:27:33.180
uh,
did you give her,
did she give you the throat?

370
00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:39.000
And she posted,
oh,
I could never do that.
I love his wife.
Aw,
that's sweet.

371
00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:43.380
You're BFFs with throat.
We,
we DM each other.

372
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:47.180
It's really gave me your shirt size.
Yeah.
I was supposed to get my own church.

373
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:51.480
Said I should tell her your size.
So anyways.
Well good.

374
00:27:51.481 --> 00:27:53.820
I'm glad to hear that your marriage is,

375
00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.430
your valves are solo taxonomy are still intact.
Yeah.

376
00:27:56.610 --> 00:28:01.490
Maybe we'll get Josh potter a Bj.
That's the goal.
That's the goal.
Yeah.

377
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.970
What do you think it would take?

378
00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:05.670
I mean it probably would take those hundreds and hundreds of dollars.

379
00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.580
My whole thing is how disposable is your income?

380
00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:13.140
I mean if I was making five,
$10 million a year,

381
00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.990
think that's well worth the entertainment.
Sure is,
hey,

382
00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:19.140
here's whatever your fee is please.

383
00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:24.290
And then do we make them snap chat it to you?
Uh,
you know,

384
00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:28.800
do we make it public or I wonder if he would sign up for that.

385
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:31.950
That's what I'm saying.
Like you can't just get something for nothing.
Josh,

386
00:28:31.951 --> 00:28:33.720
if we get this for you,
you need to,

387
00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:37.200
well as long as they give us a play by play afterwards of how should we do a

388
00:28:37.201 --> 00:28:40.150
Kickstarter for Josh?
He did say though,
he goes,

389
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:45.200
cause we've seen some of her online footage and it's with let's just say large

390
00:28:45.421 --> 00:28:48.260
individuals.
He goes,
what would she do with me?

391
00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.510
Just kind of leaned forward and it would all be gone.

392
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:58.800
Oh I told her,
I asked her to do that for that video.
I go,
so then can you go pop,

393
00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:01.170
pop,
pop.
And she goes,
that's not what it sounds like.

394
00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:07.440
She did her own,
she was like,
she did it.

395
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:09.480
There was all kinds of people in the room and they were like,
wow,

396
00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:12.570
that sounds way more authentic than Tom's version.

397
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.640
She's a professional experienced.
Yeah.
That's professional.

398
00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:21.600
Baghdad professional man.
So big,
big celebrity week for you.

399
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.320
Big Celebrity Week.
Um,
Jill Scott and throwed Zillow.

400
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.470
So hilarious.
So

401
00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:34.350
Smash Ceville.
Yup.
And give us an IBS update.

402
00:29:34.351 --> 00:29:36.330
Did you really?
Interesting.

403
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.810
You know what's so interesting to sometimes you have explosive diarrhea,

404
00:29:39.811 --> 00:29:43.360
like I do a couple of times a and you'll go,
oh it's,

405
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:46.690
you know what I just ate.
Must cause it.

406
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:49.510
And you go that's too rich or something.

407
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:54.280
And then just kind of not on your mind the next day

408
00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:56.720
<v 5>have a cheeseburger</v>

409
00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:02.510
<v 4>and later you have a totally normal bowel movement.
Oh it is.
I be like Joe,</v>

410
00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:06.210
that is IBS.
Yeah.
I mean that's from what I have.
Why would that be IBM?

411
00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:07.470
Because it is random.

412
00:30:07.471 --> 00:30:11.280
It could be like a spasmatic a bowel thing.

413
00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:15.800
So it is kind of arbitrary so that that could be part of it.
I don't know.
Okay.

414
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:17.940
What was the one going to a specialist?
Yeah.
When are you,

415
00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:22.110
when is that appointment is coming up?
Let's put that on the calendar.
What?

416
00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:23.850
What does blue band laughing?
I don't know.

417
00:30:23.851 --> 00:30:25.410
I think he's just laughing that I have an appointment.

418
00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.710
Maybe it take him along with you in video it?
No,
maybe not.

419
00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.990
<v 5>When is that appointment?
Jesus.
What is today?</v>

420
00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:40.830
<v 4>20th okay,
so I have,
I have some appointment tomorrow,
but that's not it.
Oh,</v>

421
00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:43.170
it's the 30th good.
Okay.

422
00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:48.090
The 30th I am keeping kind of a food diary so that you can tell the doctor after

423
00:30:48.091 --> 00:30:50.730
I eat certain this and that.
It's a good idea.

424
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:54.030
I think that's what they're going to make you do.
Right.
So I'll do that.

425
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:58.220
I know Tempura makes you whenever we get like a fried food.
Yeah,

426
00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:02.820
he shit right away.
Yeah.
Vegetables make you shit a lot.

427
00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:04.873
<v 5>Yup.</v>

428
00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:09.540
<v 4>Pretty much everything makes you share.
No,
you say that and that's not true.</v>

429
00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:12.530
You Shit from Turkey.
Sketti I made that upsets your stomach too.

430
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:18.300
I didn't have Rhea.
Hmm?
No,
just the normal a blaster.

431
00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:23.990
No,
just that's like a normal thumb.
Yeah.
I mean what was this morning?

432
00:31:23.991 --> 00:31:27.480
He's like,
it was a little hot,
but nothing.
You went out in a panic.

433
00:31:27.481 --> 00:31:31.860
We were putting LJ down for his nap and you are like,
I got a shit.
No it wasn't.

434
00:31:31.861 --> 00:31:34.440
I was like,
give me the baby,
don't,
well I think it was,

435
00:31:34.441 --> 00:31:37.290
I was sitting with him once I stood up,
it was like I still had to go.

436
00:31:37.291 --> 00:31:41.040
But sitting down.
Yeah.
It was the first coffee of the day.
It was ready to go.

437
00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:45.690
You know,
it was kind of hot.
So,
but in Nashville,
what did you get to eat?

438
00:31:45.691 --> 00:31:49.800
Ribs?
Cause that's a big,
no,
I didn't,
I didn't do anything crazy.

439
00:31:49.801 --> 00:31:51.270
I mean you know how it is.

440
00:31:51.271 --> 00:31:52.830
You always think you're going to do something like that,

441
00:31:52.831 --> 00:31:55.320
but if you don't really make the effort,

442
00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:57.330
like I was wanting to go to Hattie B's there,

443
00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:01.170
which is like the hot chicken place.
There's a line around the block.

444
00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:05.420
I never feel like doing that ever.
No matter how good it is.
If they're like,
yeah,

445
00:32:05.421 --> 00:32:08.940
then you just wait in line for 45 minutes.
No,
fuck,
I'm Gail.
I agree.

446
00:32:08.941 --> 00:32:11.160
I go down the street to the other place I went to,

447
00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.740
I went to a good breakfast place.

448
00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:18.920
<v 5>Um,
what else did I do?
Pretty much hit man.</v>

449
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:22.010
I ate at the hotel once,
um,

450
00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:27.840
<v 4>went out to eat.
We sit in smash bill.
We did that [inaudible] together.</v>

451
00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:32.130
We brought the fif even that,
that was a few years ago.
When was that?

452
00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:36.330
Not that long ago.
Maybe.
Maybe two years.
Yeah.
Yeah.

453
00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:40.040
And we stayed in some cool place downtown and there is that fancy

454
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.070
<v 3>restaurant across the street in the hotel that you like to remember that.
Yup.</v>

455
00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.190
Yup,
Yup.
I hate that shit.
Where they're like,

456
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:50.570
let's go to this famous a waffle place for breakfast.
And you're like,
great,

457
00:32:50.571 --> 00:32:52.930
I'm starving.
And then you get there and they're like,
yeah,

458
00:32:52.931 --> 00:32:55.760
that's another 40 minutes.
And you're like,
but I'm already fucking hungry.

459
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:58.910
Then you got to stand there and everybody are watching and patiently is

460
00:32:58.911 --> 00:33:03.580
everybody gets seated and then by the time you sit down,
you're freaking out.
Um,

461
00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.473
worst.

462
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:09.880
<v 0>By the way,
I love these,
these weird Midwest and southern,</v>

463
00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:15.320
uh,
calling contest.
So they have,
oh,
right.
We've had the mom calling contest.
Yeah.

464
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:19.240
It's silly.
So this is a hog calling contest?
Yes.
Uh,

465
00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:20.530
it's so bizarre man.

466
00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:22.410
<v 3>It is a whole art form.</v>

467
00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:27.020
<v 6>Yeah.
Kris Carr.
More Eleanor.
Look how many motherfuckers are watching.</v>

468
00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:28.570
That's the crazy part.
Yeah.

469
00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:41.220
<v 8>Piggy,
piggy,
piggy,
piggy,
piggy,
piggy,
piggy,
piggy,
piggy,
piggy,
piggy,
piggy,
piggy,</v>

470
00:33:41.221 --> 00:33:41.441
piggy.

471
00:33:41.441 --> 00:33:44.670
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme

472
00:33:44.671 --> 00:33:45.430
gimme gimme

473
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:46.263
<v 3>Bert,</v>

474
00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:48.400
<v 6>Kris Carr.</v>

475
00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:53.230
<v 0>Oh Wow.
That's weird.
Um,
what happened?</v>

476
00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:54.810
You're not going to watch the other one.
Yeah.
And there's,

477
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:59.080
there's different files.
Oh,
that's a good one.
Yeah,
that was good one.
So that guy,

478
00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:03.080
he also had a corn cob on his head.
Sure.
Um,

479
00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:06.010
so these people really do spend their days calling piglet.

480
00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:06.960
<v 3>I didn't know,
like,
I don't,</v>

481
00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:09.960
I don't know why you can't just call a pig the way you would the dog suit.

482
00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:13.763
<v 9>I like this one.</v>

483
00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.713
<v 10>Come on.</v>

484
00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:22.410
<v 3>This is how you talk to me.
Is that it?
Oh
wait,</v>

485
00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:26.910
you didn't get the rest of his,
uh,
what are you serious?

486
00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:32.550
Jesus,
man,
you could just go to the original.
Holy Shit.

487
00:34:32.551 --> 00:34:37.000
That's the whole thing is so good at it.
Lubin he was the best.
Yeah.

488
00:34:37.001 --> 00:34:41.820
Like I really any kind of looks like a pig to super fat a,
but he's,
no,

489
00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:43.820
we should just,
instead of calling people fat wishes,

490
00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:47.820
call him Bert like I Super Bert.
You know Jesus.

491
00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:49.970
Okay.

492
00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:50.803
<v 7>Okay.</v>

493
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:56.450
<v 3>It's a pretty intense feeling.
So Burt today.
Yeah.
You really are.
Oh,

494
00:34:56.451 --> 00:34:58.790

Yeah,

<v 0>Yeah.

496
00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.020

That Lloyd Christmas here.
I can actually,
yeah.

I actually studied this and washed it and washed it,
so,

504
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:55.110
We'll see how well I do today.
Okay.
We will one week

505
00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:57.770
<v 4>you call yourself a big color.</v>

<v 6>He's never really called a peg.</v>

509
00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:25.570
Does that really get them to come to you?
Got It.
Okay.

510
00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:31.150
<v 7>Oh Wow.
Yeah.
Okay.
Nailed that shit.</v>

511
00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:32.133
Thank you.

512
00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:34.940
<v 4>His big mistake too.
You don't want to go to the same,</v>

513
00:36:34.941 --> 00:36:38.000
like I'm from the city folk.
You don't qualify what you're doing.

514
00:36:38.001 --> 00:36:42.370
Just I can do it.
Yeah.
They'll make excuses.
Country of Shit.
Can you see us?
Yeah.

515
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:45.740
We don't want to hear about you city folk.
We're country is shit.
Yeah.

516
00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:48.550
This is the Illinois.
Well,
there's an actual big

517
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:56.900
guys.
Don't fat.
Shame me.
Birch.
Shame with long hair right there.

518
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:59.580
She doesn't know.

519
00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:00.413
<v 11>Sure.</v>

520
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.433
<v 7>Whoa.</v>

521
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:20.160
Oh.
Oh my God.

522
00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:28.590
Jesus Christ.
They shouldn't assume Wacko.

523
00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:32.853
Crazy.

524
00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.230
Two birds tied together.

525
00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.060
That's not even a pay college she's doing.

526
00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:51.830
That's awesome.
I think

527
00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.910
<v 4>interpretive level.
Look how uncomfortable that she's like,
um,</v>

528
00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:59.540
that wasn't a pig call.
That was something else.

529
00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:02.060
They're all looking at each other late.
I'd check.

530
00:38:02.061 --> 00:38:04.680
What's crazy is that she comes to bed.

531
00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.713
<v 7>Wow.</v>

532
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:20.280
<v 4>Now we got to decide,
right?
Yeah.
Oh,
do you know who wins?</v>

533
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:23.660
I think that lady does.
Really?
What?
Oh,
bullshit.

534
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:28.230
She sucked compared to a home.
Maybe that guy doesn't know that fat guy was,
uh,

535
00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:32.100
the second guy was getting the sunglasses.
That was amazed.
This is crazy.

536
00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:32.970
That's that.

537
00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:37.710
This is the area you're calling champion this year is Kyle Barnes.

538
00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:39.133
<v 3>All right.
It was</v>

539
00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:46.700
hell to the no.
Oh,
this is fame from Des Moines,
Iowa.

540
00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:50.740
<v 15>Yeah.
Well,
I'm a Newbie here at the Illinois State Fair.</v>

541
00:38:50.741 --> 00:38:54.010
I have actually won the Iowa State Fair three times.

542
00:38:54.011 --> 00:38:58.120
I'm the reigning champion over there and I was going to try the yard pig calling

543
00:38:58.121 --> 00:38:59.590
trifecta.
Okay.

544
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:07.690
<v 4>Yeah.
Sucks.
Nobody likes you.
Did not the champion and he's not the chair.</v>

545
00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:12.410
Not In your mom's house.
You're not as big boy with the sunglass.
Yeah.
By a mile.

546
00:39:12.411 --> 00:39:15.430
Like I really killed it.
Yeah.
You know what it is?

547
00:39:15.431 --> 00:39:19.060
I think they were sold by his hand gestures.
They liked that he,
his,

548
00:39:19.061 --> 00:39:23.890
he added a little more flair.
Yeah.
And he went up with that.

549
00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.260
I want to do it.
You sound like you almost ready.

550
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:33.210
I liked the,
uh,
that was good.
By really good at in practice.

551
00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:37.410
That was my first time.
But that,
that shriek,
that sounds genuine.

552
00:39:37.411 --> 00:39:41.880
Piggish you don't talk when they do the like,
yeah.
That thing.
That is so good.

553
00:39:41.881 --> 00:39:45.150
I am even,
wow.

554
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:49.920
Maybe on the master of the closing,
my eyes go for it.

555
00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:55.900
Burt Holman was super fat.

556
00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:04.980
She's so big.
That was alarming.
Yeah.
Like you couldn't even see her chin.
Oh,

557
00:40:04.981 --> 00:40:07.290
by the way,
my father texted me.
Yeah.

558
00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:10.020
Got To tell you this a few days ago,

559
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:14.790
and he texts me that I put it on.

560
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:18.960
Um,
I put it on Instagram.
He goes,
I'm in the Orlando Airport

561
00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:21.923
and I'm

562
00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:27.540
shitting in the store that I shat in 18 years.

563
00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:33.900
Wow.
So I wanted to see if we can get them on the phone.

564
00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:39.900
Geez.
Let's see.
In the Orlando Airport

565
00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:46.000
and his Chin is on the,
the outlet,
like the courts

566
00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:47.883
<v 16>hours,</v>

567
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:52.910
<v 17>Ponce.
Say Fifo.
Take a picture.
Hey Dad.</v>

568
00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:57.760

Good man.
How's it going?
Do you want to be great?

569
00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.600
Just don't forget to tell him right now.

570
00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.880
<v 4>Yeah,
I'm happy.
Father's Day.
Of course.
Again,</v>

571
00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:07.190
<v 17>I hope you had a good one here.
I hear.
Yeah,
I did.
Yeah.</v>

572
00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:11.070
<v 4>I,
uh,
I'm going to ask you,
you,
uh,</v>

573
00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:15.550
texted me the other day that you went to the Orlando Airport

574
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:21.900
<v 17>and Oh yeah.
Yeah.
You ended up kind of a notch</v>

575
00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:27.380
in the same store where I did my,

576
00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:30.700
my famous shit.
Um,
I'm 19 years ago.

577
00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:32.990
<v 4>This was the shit that went through your</v>

578
00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:37.630
<v 17>yeah,
yeah.
This is the one where I leave my underwear in the,</v>

579
00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:42.720
in the place and kind of just do the best I could with Nigel housers.

580
00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:47.360
Amanda get on the plane.
I was in a brown spot in the cracker,
you know,

581
00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:53.250
so this was the Yak stall.
So that was kind of it.

582
00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:57.070
It ended up being kind of a nostalgic moment,
if you know what I mean.

583
00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:02.890
You know,
you get emotional about it,
you know.
Well,
you know,

584
00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:05.840
I mean get emotional,
but you know,
I,
I,

585
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:10.930
this is one of the challenges that you face in life and you have to,

586
00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:15.040
you know,
I mean,
I actually thought about adding to go home,

587
00:42:15.041 --> 00:42:19.930
but I got it out and made my flight and you know,
got engine the new place.

588
00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:23.790
<v 0>Right.
So where were you flying to?
Do you remember?</v>

589
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:27.170
<v 17>Well,
uh,
I was flying to,</v>

590
00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:33.180
I think I was trying to Arizona,
so I was just like,

591
00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:37.610
<v 0>oh wow.
So you cross country with Dukie on your pants.
That's not too,
yeah,
yeah,</v>

592
00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:42.350
Yup,
Yup,
Yup,
Yup.
Um,
wow.
That's pretty,

593
00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:43.213
that's pretty neat.

594
00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:48.220
It'd be Kinda cool if you also were to go to the same gas station in Miami that

595
00:42:48.261 --> 00:42:50.710
you pulled over for your biggest shit ever.
Do you remember that one?

596
00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:55.230
<v 17>You know,
at that place she still existed today.
It would be a nurse.</v>

597
00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:57.180
I know.
Really.
You know that,

598
00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:01.010
that we're talking by Miami's damage,

599
00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:05.670
you know,
say kind of place where,
you know,

600
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.320
on the side you had transmissions.
I just discarded on the side.
Oh

601
00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:14.130
<v 0>Wow.
Do you remember,
did you finish that shit?</v>

602
00:43:14.131 --> 00:43:16.770
Did you tell him I'm about it at all or no?
Cause it was so epic?

603
00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.090
<v 17>Probably.
Yeah.</v>

604
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:23.700
<v 0>Do you think she probably enjoyed that or no?
Definitely not.</v>

605
00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:28.140
Definitely not.
Um,
you know,
I was the one that we've been getting a lot,

606
00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:33.180
a lot of people emailing us about double pipe classics,
you know?

607
00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:38.340
<v 17>Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,</v>

608
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:44.110
yeah.
They were,
you know,
they're very rare.

609
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:49.280
Yeah.
When I had my last one,
you know,
you,

610
00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:51.840
you can go a whole year or two without even have her.

611
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:56.910
<v 0>Yeah.
I mean,
Christina had her first one this year,</v>

612
00:43:56.911 --> 00:44:00.720
I think the first one in ages and I haven't had one this year.

613
00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:03.850
<v 17>I haven't handled it this year either.</v>

614
00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:08.500
<v 0>Yeah.
That's the thing is,
and people are keep trying to,</v>

615
00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:13.770
they keep trying to manufacture them and I tried to encourage them.
You

616
00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:17.890
<v 17>can't,
you can't do it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just one of those things.
Yeah.
You know,</v>

617
00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:21.790
it's one of those things you just,
you got to let it happen.
Right.

618
00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:26.590
Like you can't make it rain,
you know,
there's certain thing.
Right.
Right.

619
00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:31.170
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.
I remember the last time,
time

620
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:37.170
<v 0>it rain.
That's true.
Yeah.
I mean,
cause then people will be like,
Hey,
um,</v>

621
00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:41.220
I sneezed and fired at the same time.
Does that count?
And I'm like,
no,

622
00:44:41.221 --> 00:44:42.300
of course not.
No.

623
00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:46.950
<v 17>The GG to do that.
Exactly.
You know,
it's not special,</v>

624
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:53.110
you know,
and uh,
and still not won yet.
Sorry to the shame.

625
00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:56.050
So I know that,
you know,

626
00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:01.290
in this round you just want to be judged.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

627
00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:03.510
you gotta think about music though.

628
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:08.440
<v 0>The reason it's so rare too is that you got air coming out of both ends.</v>

629
00:45:08.441 --> 00:45:12.040
You know,
usually,
usually it takes a,
it picks a road,
you know,

630
00:45:12.041 --> 00:45:13.510
it doesn't actually go down both.

631
00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:16.320
<v 17>Oh yeah,
that's right.
You know,</v>

632
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:19.330
I was like getting punched in the gut and it goes both ways.
Yeah.

633
00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:22.290
<v 0>Yeah.
It's really,
it's really something.
So</v>

634
00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:25.340
<v 17>I don't remember the last time I had one of those,
you know,</v>

635
00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:28.280
I haven't had one that I would really remember it.

636
00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:33.440
I'm pretty good about my classic moments about,
can't take it this way.
Wow.

637
00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:38.900
<v 0>Just shows you that you as the master an even you don't even recall your lap.</v>

638
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:43.020
I remember having one,
I believe.
I mean,

639
00:45:43.021 --> 00:45:47.730
we can probably find it in our show a year ago and it's,
you know,
for me,

640
00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.680
probably maybe the third or fourth ever.
Very rare.

641
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:54.300
They're so rare and um,
yeah,
every time though,

642
00:45:54.301 --> 00:45:55.740
it's a really special moment.

643
00:45:55.741 --> 00:45:59.070
A lot of people have let us know about their first time and they're like,
oh,

644
00:45:59.071 --> 00:46:01.140
it happened to me today is really spectacular.

645
00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:07.130
<v 17>Well,
yeah,
as Yogi Berra used,
just say,
you know,
there's only one the first time.</v>

646
00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:07.983
The first time.

647
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:13.110
<v 0>Right,
right,
right.
That's true.
Um,
so have your,
um,
you know,</v>

648
00:46:13.111 --> 00:46:18.111
I'm going to go see a specialist actually because I have so many catastrophic

649
00:46:18.451 --> 00:46:21.210
shits that I'm actually going to go check my guts out.

650
00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:23.940
<v 17>Really?</v>

651
00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:28.070
<v 0>Yeah.
I mean,
I don't know that I have anything medical for sure,
but,
um,</v>

652
00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:30.240
I just figured,
you know,
I could just check it out,

653
00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:33.170
see if any maybe food allergies.

654
00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:39.320
<v 17>It'd be my career all over again.
I'd really want to be a gastroenterologist.</v>

655
00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:41.010
<v 0>Oh yeah.
You were made for it.</v>

656
00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.200
<v 17>Yes.
If fascinates me,</v>

657
00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:50.240
Ron insider and the guts.
Yeah.
Well,
you know,
I checked her Nana,
I got,

658
00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:54.480
I'm trying to say I took an antibiotic and as an antibiotic I've never taken

659
00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:56.500
before.
Well,

660
00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:01.270
I had the hardest shift gears.
Okay.
Really?

661
00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:05.050
I May,
we're talking,
we're talking one GS and twosies.
Okay.

662
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:06.830
<v 0>How long ago was this?</v>

663
00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:09.170
<v 17>Just two weeks ago.</v>

664
00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:11.000
<v 0>Oh really?
Cause I remember,</v>

665
00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:15.580
was it last year when you had the real hard shifts and we talked about
hydrating.

666
00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:18.850
<v 17>Yeah.
But this is really due to the antibiotic.</v>

667
00:47:18.851 --> 00:47:22.880
So I loaded up on metamucil and the center,
so that makes a difference.

668
00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:27.170
Once I quit,
I quit the antibiotic.

669
00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:32.260
I knew I was out of the Claire and I had my normal smarts smell a certain right.

670
00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:36.430
You know,
I know.
Smells a certain way.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
And,

671
00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:38.080
and that was like the ghost state know.

672
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:43.120
And sure enough later that day back to normal.
Wow.
What a neat story.

673
00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:46.850
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
She had a price.

674
00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:51.260
They little with that bacteria in your gut.
All right.

675
00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:52.150
That's what they do.

676
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:56.440
They acknowledge Shoba your germs for you or what's wrong with you.

677
00:47:56.441 --> 00:48:01.350
But they also getting a gut and,
and uh,
oh,
I have to tell you this.

678
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:04.260
Okay.
I was having lunch with a doctor.

679
00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:09.880
It was like 85 and I don't know if you've ever heard what's called C diff.

680
00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:15.280
It's a bacterial infection that is really a result of taking too many

681
00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:20.940
antibiotics.
Okay.
Very common in nursing homes.

682
00:48:20.941 --> 00:48:24.810
And today was people just take too many antibiotics.

683
00:48:24.811 --> 00:48:26.280
You going to get to get all right.

684
00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:32.060
Well you know a lot of people they say take probiotics and all this stuff,

685
00:48:32.281 --> 00:48:33.030
but the,

686
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:38.030
what they really need to do is introduce a shit back into your gut.

687
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:43.440
In the old days they used to give you shit animals.

688
00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:46.260
They would give you an animal of somebody else's shit

689
00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:52.500
into your gut in order to reintroduce.
That's very,

690
00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:54.490
what about just doing,
I never,

691
00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:58.370
well you know I,

692
00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:03.850
I'm sure that somebody might want to do that for fem or I was just fascinated by

693
00:49:03.851 --> 00:49:08.020
it.
Yeah.
That is interesting
to do that or no,

694
00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:09.401
no,

695
00:49:09.401 --> 00:49:13.240
I never knew that until here earlier this year when I was having lunch with this

696
00:49:13.241 --> 00:49:16.880
doctorate.
Wow.
Shit.
Anima.
What's the

697
00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:24.830
C diff?
Yeah.
Wait,
spell it.

698
00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:33.170
D.
I.
F.
F.
C.
Oh by the way,
speaking of shirts.

699
00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:35.930
How about your bedspread?
Th is everything cool with that now?

700
00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:43.250
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
That is cool.
Cause you shit on it.

701
00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:49.490
I did
find or good to go.

702
00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:52.260
Yeah.
It really,
I tell you,

703
00:49:52.261 --> 00:49:55.750
you got to adjust a lot of room and the washing it only do one thing and the

704
00:49:55.751 --> 00:49:57.840
washer and then the dryer and you know,

705
00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:02.520
it's a lot of work to do also a badge for that.
But I'm sorry.
Yeah,
you're fine,

706
00:50:02.521 --> 00:50:06.830
Huh?
Okay.
And the best friends.
Fine.
Yeah.
Once you do,

707
00:50:06.831 --> 00:50:09.440
as if you're by yourself.
I was by myself and I did this,
you know,

708
00:50:09.441 --> 00:50:11.650
you just take that with the shitty party.

709
00:50:11.651 --> 00:50:14.360
You this kind of folds up the other way so it doesn't get idea.
Jay,

710
00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:15.950
can you just sleep

711
00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:26.640
right then?
You wash it right away,
you know,
I think I did it the next day.

712
00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:28.990
It's already the truth.
My Dad,

713
00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:33.800
<v 4>she wants from you slept in a,
in a shit filled bedspread.</v>

714
00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:36.633
Yeah.

715
00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:43.760
That's barbaric man.
I know,
I know.
Yeah.

716
00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:46.410
<v 17>It's your own stop.
So who cares,
right.</v>

717
00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:49.790
<v 4>Kay.
Ah,
I do.
I think I would probably get up.</v>

718
00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.900
It's really,
that's a really savage,

719
00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:57.130
<v 17>I own my own brand and it doesn't bother me that much.</v>

720
00:50:57.310 --> 00:51:01.510
<v 4>Okay.
Um,
Jesus man.
So you just,
Oh,
you hung up.</v>

721
00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:04.870
I guess how he did it.
I bet this face,
yes.
I bet you he did.

722
00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:09.580
He mashed his face.
It was will be the first thing he said.
I hung up by you.

723
00:51:09.581 --> 00:51:10.414
My face in it.

724
00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:13.493
<v 1>Hey Buddy.</v>

725
00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:18.180
<v 4>Yeah man.
He believed that and I can,</v>

726
00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:22.530
it's a little like the room eight oh eight rooms.
Six one eight revelation.
Yeah.

727
00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:26.100
He told us one story and it actually was another story

728
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:31.690
early.
Interesting.
Really interesting.
Yeah.
I can uh,

729
00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:36.960
can't call him back trying to,
oh,
maybe he's calling,
you know.
Oh Man,

730
00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:41.970
I got to let the Schnitzel out.
You do.
I think she has to go potty.
Go potty too.

731
00:51:41.971 --> 00:51:45.170
Cause I hydrate so much.
Well these you just at least get,
yeah,

732
00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.680
she's standing up.
Walking.
Yeah.

733
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:53.910
<v 17>Hello.
Hey,
what happened there?
I just a the soft phones.
Okay.</v>

734
00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:56.390
<v 4>Oh really?
Are you sure you didn't accidentally hang up?</v>

735
00:51:57.050 --> 00:52:00.390
<v 17>No,
no,
no.
I'm just,
I'm just,
I'm,
I'm laying down a sudden.</v>

736
00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:04.130
I am laying down.
Yeah,
I'm going to shut up.

737
00:52:04.350 --> 00:52:09.030
<v 4>No,
no,
no,
it's fine.
It's fine.
Um,
okay,
well look,
uh,
oh by the way,</v>

738
00:52:09.031 --> 00:52:12.360
I know you have a travel day coming up.
You know,
travel days are really,

739
00:52:12.361 --> 00:52:15.570
I travel a lot and it can really affect your,
your bowel movements.

740
00:52:15.571 --> 00:52:16.770
So just make sure you,

741
00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:20.870
<v 17>it does.
Oh,
it does.
You know,
I have to tell you.
It does.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

742
00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:24.480
When I'm traveling and the trouble is,
is that um,
you know,

743
00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:27.500
I'm hitting the road and go to the airport tomorrow at eight o'clock,

744
00:52:27.501 --> 00:52:32.390
which is really normal bomb normal bombs away time is eight 30.
Okay.

745
00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:35.570
Yeah.
So I'll be in the car so that just,

746
00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:40.190
it just plugs you up the hallway and then you got to get another car and scratch

747
00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:44.570
dinner.
And so I probably won't do my first load job tomorrow night.

748
00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:48.490
<v 4>Oh Wow.
Yeah.
That's going to be something.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yes.</v>

749
00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:53.170
<v 17>The smell.
I'll alcohol do back to back loads probably in the evening.
Okay,
cool.</v>

750
00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:57.370
Come on buddy.
Let me know how it goes.
Okay.
I love you.
I'll let you know.
I do.

751
00:52:57.371 --> 00:53:00.970
Love you.
Bye.
Bye.
Yeah,
unreal.

752
00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:02.360
<v 1>Come on guys.
Let's go.</v>

753
00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:06.210
<v 4>Yeah,
we're back.
How was the doctor and my water?
Yeah.</v>

754
00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:10.800
Well a Schnitzel had their shit twice.
That was an intense time of her.

755
00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:15.840
No,
please don't drink at all.
Just a set for me.
That is not just a sip for you.

756
00:53:15.841 --> 00:53:19.770
You're such a liar.
She took two dumps in the grass.

757
00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:21.300
It was 40 of your sips left.

758
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:26.543
<v 1>Yup.</v>

759
00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:31.970
<v 3>I look,
biggest sip of your life just went down.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,</v>

760
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.150
yeah.
It's bullshit.
She had the ship pretty bad,

761
00:53:36.151 --> 00:53:39.900
so yeah,
she does.
She's usually stupid and she'll just go in.

762
00:53:39.901 --> 00:53:43.200
The sprinklers are on,
you know.
Yeah.
She actually waited for them to be,

763
00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:46.980
to be finished,
which is a first,
it's good.
She comes back.

764
00:53:46.981 --> 00:53:49.140
So good job.

765
00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:56.550
Um,
how amazing was that called top dog?
I loved when he's like,

766
00:53:56.551 --> 00:53:59.490
you can't make it rain with double pipes,
which is true.

767
00:53:59.491 --> 00:54:01.620
That's the whole essence of it.
It's,
it's special.

768
00:54:01.621 --> 00:54:03.810
It's rare because out of respect we got to do this.

769
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:08.520
<v 4>Hey Buddy.
Stop Dog.
Right Kate,
buddy.</v>

770
00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:13.390
Stop Dog.
Hey Buddy.
Stop Dog.

771
00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:18.780
Do you need to wipe down?
Stop Dog.

772
00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:24.870
<v 3>Now,
did you talk to him yesterday on Father's Day?
Briefly.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.</v>

773
00:54:24.871 --> 00:54:27.360
It was brief.
What did he do?
What?
Go to the movies with your mom?

774
00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:32.230
My mom and my aunt flew back from payroll,
so,
right,

775
00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:35.940
so he was alone that whole time.
Was that your mom?
They were gone for 10 days.

776
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:39.650
What does he do without her?
Nothing.
Right.
He was like,
you're like me.

777
00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:42.120
Stares at the ceiling.
Doesn't like forgets to eat.

778
00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:47.160
Why is that with men?
If the wife leaves,
they just there.

779
00:54:47.161 --> 00:54:49.970
They stopped and they stopped counting on you,
man.
What do you think?

780
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:52.710
Stay up all night.
Yeah.
For me,

781
00:54:52.711 --> 00:54:56.080
I go to bed at like four 30 every night that you're gone.
I'm like,
blah,
blah,

782
00:54:56.090 --> 00:55:00.270
blah,
blah,
blah.
I just ate.
Well,
we had in the snack drawers.

783
00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:06.420
No meals.
No.
I think we put a little order in your life,

784
00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:10.740
but when you leave I fly off the rails too,
you know,
not behaviorally.

785
00:55:10.741 --> 00:55:13.050
I just get really like I don't know what to do right now.

786
00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:17.040
I just feel like you're,
you're my,
you're my left side.

787
00:55:17.041 --> 00:55:19.620
You're at my other pair of,
we share a pair of jeans.

788
00:55:19.621 --> 00:55:22.830
It's like how I do not go to bed when you're gone.

789
00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:26.010
I don't split.
You have to wake up with Lj.

790
00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:31.080
I mean it's better now,
but when he before him,
Oh,

791
00:55:31.081 --> 00:55:32.730
you never did completely.
I was like,

792
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:36.360
it's 5:00 AM I should really just turn it in.
She'll like that.

793
00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:40.830
What were you doing?
Watching TV?
Watching movies and just like forcing,

794
00:55:40.831 --> 00:55:45.750
like feeling tired,
like fight through it.
Right.

795
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:48.180
I remember those days before I kid.

796
00:55:48.181 --> 00:55:51.630
When you get to stay up all night and then just sleep next day.

797
00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:57.060
I know to stay in bed.
Tozer over,
go to brunch.

798
00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:00.150
Yeah.
It's not going to happen for a minute son.

799
00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:05.880
Now I fly off the rails too.
I just,
I don't know what to do with myself,
you know,

800
00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:10.080
cause you're the left leg and my jeans and when you're not here,
I'm like,

801
00:56:10.081 --> 00:56:14.910
I don't know.
I do.
I had to hopping around on one leg,
you know,
it feels sucks.

802
00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:18.180
I feel as jeans,
mummy your mind.

803
00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:22.890
This is how I feel when,
uh,
when you're not around.

804
00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:27.790
<v 19>I called up inside her,
I called.</v>

805
00:56:34.310 --> 00:56:35.143
<v 7>I'm excited.</v>

806
00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:43.560
He's
so happy that I'm done.

807
00:56:50.130 --> 00:56:50.963
<v 19>No,</v>

808
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.690
<v 0>no.
American announcer does anything even close to that.
I know.</v>

809
00:57:04.530 --> 00:57:09.530
Basically Dick Vitale probably would be the guy,

810
00:57:10.110 --> 00:57:15.090
right?
That is,
does he do,
what's his sound?
He just really,

811
00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:20.660
he is so high energy did he talks himself out of breath and he's,

812
00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:24.150
yeah,
baby.
It's always baby,
but he's like screaming it.

813
00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:28.890
He gets really hype about it.
So people that that are,
you know,

814
00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:33.170
he definitely adds enthusiasm,
but it could definitely wear you out.
Um,

815
00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:37.370
it's a,
it's a lot.
It's definitely a lot.
Um,

816
00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:43.530
wow.
This is a,
that's Italian,
right?
Yeah.
This is,

817
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:47.530
yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This is this deadly for sure.
Um,

818
00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:53.510
I can't even imagine getting this excited about soccer.
Well,
just,

819
00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:59.100
yeah,
I like enthusiastic announcers,
but it's just crazy to,
to be like that,

820
00:57:59.101 --> 00:58:04.050
right?
Like,
yes,
cause night for American football.

821
00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:06.830
I'll give you a,
with what he's said,

822
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:08.503
<v 7>another guy in</v>

823
00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:14.950
ESPN now to dig by cow clearly gets carried away with his word God is going to

824
00:58:15.951 --> 00:58:16.784
be,

825
00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:35.990
that's fine.
Yeah.
That's still within reason.
Now.
It's within reason.

826
00:58:43.350 --> 00:58:44.700
<v 0>Are you serious,
baby?</v>

827
00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:45.870
<v 7>Awesome baby.</v>

828
00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:54.600
<v 0>He's,
he's,
you know,
he's exciting.
Americans are very contained though.</v>

829
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:56.620
This says a Dick Vitale.
It goes crazy here.

830
00:58:57.250 --> 00:59:02.050
<v 7>Haley newspapers that cover this program.
Why</v>

831
00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.450
weird here?
He,

832
00:59:29.290 --> 00:59:30.123
that's good.

833
00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:33.500
<v 4>That's not no worries.</v>

834
00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:38.420
<v 7>Italian
Europeans really loved their soccer.</v>

835
00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:43.190
They go really nuts.
Everyone does.

836
00:59:46.350 --> 00:59:50.430
Arabs love it.
The a rams.

837
00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:55.250
The Latins
nameless.

838
00:59:58.850 --> 01:00:02.840
<v 4>Well anyways,
so that was exciting.
Got It.
Yeah,
he was fine.
You got it.</v>

839
01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:07.200
<v 5>Yeah.
Awesome baby.
That's him.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

840
01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:14.110
<v 4>this guy though,
cause there's also the,
uh,
the Spanish goal guy.</v>

841
01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:18.500
I liked that guy.
Yeah.

842
01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:23.230
Yeah.
Um,
but every guy has got to find their hook.
These announcers.
Right.

843
01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:28.120
You gotta Find Your special book.
Yeah.
Yours would be far,
far,
far,
far,

844
01:00:28.121 --> 01:00:30.520
far,
far apart,
baby.
That's not what I would do.

845
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:35.060
<v 5>Um,
let's see.
Uh,
let's see.
The Spanish.</v>

846
01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:40.440
<v 4>You don't fart into the mic anymore.
Like he used to.
I did.
Used to do that.</v>

847
01:00:40.650 --> 01:00:41.910
Actually.
I did it in a really,

848
01:00:41.911 --> 01:00:46.911
in a classic jeans episode cause we used to have handheld mics back in silver

849
01:00:47.581 --> 01:00:51.900
lake.
It's not like we're normal.
That one.

850
01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:54.150
I wanted to have one point.
Oh my God.

851
01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:57.510
I wanted to have one get picked up on the audio.
I can't believe you.

852
01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:02.870
Let me just describe,
Oh my God,
I'm a throw up faith.
That's awesome.
Oh,

853
01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:06.180
so fucking terrible.
It.
What does this smelly,
I'm going to throw up.

854
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:13.620
Oh,
Mike,
I'm going to throw up.
I'm going to throw up.
It smells like yoga.

855
01:01:13.650 --> 01:01:18.180
Like those Japanese dumplings we had baby.
That's Rad.
Oh,
oh.

856
01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.490
Oh,
I like that you,
you went like,
this is what marriage is.

857
01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:28.020
You're pushing it away with,
oh my God.
Did you shit today.

858
01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:32.550
That's so you.
And I was like,
who?
Savannah.
And they're like,

859
01:01:32.551 --> 01:01:35.610
she's one of the cohosts.
Oh my gosh.
I could go to a separate room.

860
01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:40.170
Oh my God.
Yeah.
I go into a separate room

861
01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:43.950
and I,
uh,

862
01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:47.250
he said it's me in the scroll in the scrolls are fucking absolute moron.

863
01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:51.500
Please try to ignore it.
That's the best part was he

864
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:57.740
will keep playing it.
But that's the clip.
That's not the whole thing.
No,
I know,

865
01:01:57.741 --> 01:02:00.200
but that's the clip.
I have it.
But that was a horrible,

866
01:02:00.201 --> 01:02:02.810
and then what happened was Burt,
you and I were podcasting,

867
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:08.120
you farted and then Bert kept telling the stupid Savannah story and I was like,

868
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:10.600
are you not going to address?
Which just happened?
Yeah,

869
01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:13.070
because we were in burgs man cave where you can taste it.

870
01:02:13.071 --> 01:02:17.390
It's like coming into my mouth.
We were in his man cave in,
you're fart.
Just,
yeah.

871
01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:20.040
It was a black cloud in that room and I had

872
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:24.230
<v 3>to get out there like she's one of the cohosts and so I go on my separate,</v>

873
01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:29.070
oh my God.
I go into a separate room.

874
01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.380
That one I remember the smell of.

875
01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:37.740
That's funny you bring this up because I remember that smell.

876
01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:41.420
I had to leave the room.
I walked out of that podcast,
remember?
Oh yeah,

877
01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:46.000
I believe that was one of those.
You were like,
because you smelled it.

878
01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:48.990
Unreal.
Your farts.

879
01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:53.670
I had a fart this morning when I was opening the dog crates and you are my God.

880
01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:56.760
You didn't even acknowledge it.

881
01:02:56.850 --> 01:03:01.590
I remember it was so long and loud.

882
01:03:01.591 --> 01:03:05.470
It was good.
You didn't acknowledge it though.
I was trying to sleep,

883
01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:10.140
I was trying to sleep,
but I acknowledge it.

884
01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.600
Can you do that now for me?
Can you give me what I deserve?

885
01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:20.130
Pretty Great.
Appreciate
you really dropped some weight on me.

886
01:03:20.570 --> 01:03:23.040
It just keeps telling the Savannah story

887
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:28.640
why he chose,
he chose to ignore you like a toddler.
Like Ah,

888
01:03:28.641 --> 01:03:30.210
I just ignore that bad behavior.

889
01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:37.770
Unreal.
Have you had any good public farts lately?

890
01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:43.630
I think good public parks it on the plane Lailey far whenever you played.

891
01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:46.460
I know you'd see I,
he's still,
you know,

892
01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:51.100
and sometimes I lift up the best kind is when you um,

893
01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.530
when you're trying to disguise it,
you know,
like you need to lift up.

894
01:03:54.531 --> 01:03:58.680
We don't want to go so,
so I'll be like,

895
01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:02.710
I'll be like,
I'll look in the seat back pocket

896
01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.790
part there,

897
01:04:07.850 --> 01:04:11.000
act like the straps are kind of fucked up.
Oh God.

898
01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:16.710
As I put it back together,
you know,
that's interesting.

899
01:04:16.711 --> 01:04:19.650
I just usually have a blanket over my lap so I just,

900
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:22.920
and shop that way and I feel like that kid who cross your legs

901
01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:30.060
pull the leg up.
But I usually lean against the window.

902
01:04:30.070 --> 01:04:32.150
I thought naturally up though,
right?

903
01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:37.350
I thought it would be the input higher flight here next to me,
the guy,

904
01:04:37.351 --> 01:04:40.260
it's a morning flight early morning.
That's first people are,

905
01:04:40.350 --> 01:04:45.210
it's not just far be,
it's also body fluid city.
Like it's everything.

906
01:04:45.211 --> 01:04:48.810
So the guy next to me,
every five minutes for a four hour flight went

907
01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:55.860
like clearing his sinuses and then behind the guy went

908
01:04:58.910 --> 01:05:00.060
and I was like,
wow.

909
01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:04.290
I just kept hearing you being like fucking disgusting.

910
01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:09.180
Well don't get on the plane aids monkey if you're going to spread it like that.

911
01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:13.050
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with y'all?
I mean don't,

912
01:05:13.051 --> 01:05:16.110
don't spread your disease peg.
I agree.
I agree.

913
01:05:16.350 --> 01:05:18.310
That's sucking in the snot thing really

914
01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:22.180
<v 4>gets me.
Yeah.
I that is my absolute least favorite.</v>

915
01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:25.180
I just hate human beings on airplanes and everything.

916
01:05:25.181 --> 01:05:29.530
Everyone does annoys the shit out of me.
No,
I know.
Hate everybody.

917
01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:33.970
It's been really nice not traveling as much with the baby jeans.
I,
you know,

918
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.380
I think it took that to,
to make me slow down.
Yeah.

919
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:42.390
I am so much happier now that I don't deal with humanity coming up this week.

920
01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:48.260
Oh Jeez.
Fart sparks Capone

921
01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:54.340
early flight.
It's going to hurt your stomach big time.

922
01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:57.460
Now did you fart next to Jill Scott?
No.
No.

923
01:05:57.490 --> 01:06:01.600
He had some respect for that shit on that flight though,
which I hated.
Really?

924
01:06:01.601 --> 01:06:02.470
Shitting on planes.

925
01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:06.430
It's the worst yet I had to now have you chose God doesn't like salmon.

926
01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:09.490
I'm sorry,
what?
Jill?
Scott doesn't like salmon.

927
01:06:09.970 --> 01:06:11.470
I don't think he said that word right.

928
01:06:11.471 --> 01:06:13.870
I don't know what you're talking to Salomon.
Yeah.
She wasn't like it.

929
01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:15.133
I discovered that.

930
01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:18.400
It's interesting was it was kind of how the conversation started and actually

931
01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:22.000
why you're ordering lunch.
Yeah.
And they said,
um,

932
01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:26.710
would you like something or salad with Salomon?
Well,
Hannah,
and she was like,

933
01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:31.060
ah.
Right.
And then it started,

934
01:06:31.290 --> 01:06:32.140
we just started talking.
Well,

935
01:06:32.141 --> 01:06:36.660
I wouldn't eat plain airplane Salmon Saulman to save my duck.
Right.

936
01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:41.260
It's disgusting.
What airline was this?
A Delta?
Yeah.

937
01:06:41.261 --> 01:06:43.750
Even they have g decent meals.
I wouldn't touch it.
What?

938
01:06:43.751 --> 01:06:48.751
I was encouraging her to go to a French restaurant and get traditional salmon

939
01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:53.500
French made where,
I'm sorry,
French Solomon Solomon.

940
01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:58.400
They have,
you know,
basically it's rich.
Medium rare,
but yes,
you know,

941
01:06:58.550 --> 01:07:02.980
they'll take you in the spoon on the piping hot butter and drizzle it so you

942
01:07:02.981 --> 01:07:07.981
have an outside that's kind of lightly fried basically with butter.

943
01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:13.390
But I would be careful with the rare Saulman because you had that in Vegas and

944
01:07:13.391 --> 01:07:14.530
it made you really ill.

945
01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:18.400
But I don't think it was rare Salomon as much as I just got,
I mean,

946
01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:22.900
I don't get rare Salomon.
Yeah,
just medium rare I think is the best way to have.

947
01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:27.850
I don't like that.
I get scared.
I get really nervous.
So it's too raw salmon.
Yeah,

948
01:07:27.851 --> 01:07:31.270
because you don't,
it's not Sushi grade,
it's just some pieces.
Wellman.

949
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:35.620
I wouldn't do that.
That's just,
you know,
Fridays.
Fridays I'm saying though,

950
01:07:35.621 --> 01:07:38.650
but if you go to like a high end place where it's quality stuff,

951
01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:43.690
I do it that way.
Yeah,
sure.
Okay.
Difference between you and me.

952
01:07:44.170 --> 01:07:46.840
Different strokes for the same folks.
Everyone's the same.

953
01:07:47.290 --> 01:07:51.010
I got another voicemail from the Persian lady.
You did.
We should play that.

954
01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.050
So it's just,
it just never ends.

955
01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:56.620
Just essentially the Salamay continues.

956
01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:59.410
That's a,

But I'm still upset about it.

976
01:09:36.461 --> 01:09:40.110
Either watch a show and then the next day you're fucking upset.
Wait,

977
01:09:40.111 --> 01:09:42.840

No,

983
01:10:00.901 --> 01:10:02.070
I mean,
it's a great show,
but I haven't,

984
01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:05.160
and we haven't watched blood farts because we're tied into this show.
Yeah.

985
01:10:05.161 --> 01:10:08.400
We got to emotionally wrap it up with the Americans before we can start on the

986
01:10:08.401 --> 01:10:13.200
other.
I'm excited.
I've heard amazing things about the new season of blood parts,

987
01:10:13.201 --> 01:10:17.010
so have I.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He knew they weren't going to fuck that up.
I felt like that,

988
01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:21.360
you know?
Yeah.
No,
I can't wait dude.
It's going to be great.
Yeah,
that'd be great.

989
01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:25.590
Um,
what else do I have for you?
I have something else here.
Oh,
you know,
we,

990
01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:28.950
we haven't done any,
no,
I'm saying the account in a while,
but we do have a,

991
01:10:28.951 --> 01:10:32.640
you feel me count the Cayman for designer.
You know who that is?

992
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:37.350
Um,
he's wrapper.
Ponder,
ponder upon it.
God Damn it's,

993
01:10:37.410 --> 01:10:42.180
so this is him in the interview on the radio that can check out his,

994
01:10:42.181 --> 01:10:47.180
you feel me?
Is Our [inaudible] okay.
They're on top of each other and grow.

995
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:51.210
It's really impressive.
Hmm.
So hmm.
Oh Carrie.

996
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:52.500
I think as far as you feel me,

997
01:10:52.501 --> 01:10:55.020
cause I know you always like to make the distinction between,
you know,

998
01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.470
you know what I'm saying?
You feel that there's different categories.
Yeah.

999
01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:01.440
So this one is definitely on.
You feel me?
It's,
it's,
it's really up there.
Okay.

1000
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:03.780
<v 21>We did it all start for you.
I mean music wise,</v>

1001
01:11:03.781 --> 01:11:07.080
I know I read on Wikipedia that you,

1002
01:11:07.081 --> 01:11:10.470
you and the church choir and stuff like that and the age 14 you started rhyming.

1003
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:11.690
That's correct.

1004
01:11:11.690 --> 01:11:14.340
<v 4>Oh the odd is it didn't say you put me at 14</v>

1005
01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:15.730
<v 22>you probably haven't really changed my life over.</v>

1006
01:11:15.731 --> 01:11:20.731
And you get all that street moved here when I got to her.

1007
01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:25.320
<v 4>What?
Yeah,
I didn't even understand what he said.
Well I could translate.
Yeah,</v>

1008
01:11:25.321 --> 01:11:29.790
there's so much going on there.
Well the guy is definitely an island guy here.

1009
01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:34.260
Oh yeah,
absolutely.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Could you do his accent please?

1010
01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:40.390
Stop fee.
I mean music wise,
I know I read on Wikipedia that you,

1011
01:11:40.410 --> 01:11:42.600
you were in the church choir.
Yup.

1012
01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:49.590
It's an easy one.
You can do this.
I read on the Wikipedia.

1013
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:52.680
Did you and the church choir?
I feel like he's a,

1014
01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:57.380
you didn't even try on that one.
I know I didn't try it again.
Hold on.
Coffee.

1015
01:11:57.410 --> 01:12:01.800
I mean music wise,
I know I read on Wikipedia that you,

1016
01:12:01.801 --> 01:12:06.801
you and the church choir a read on the Wikipedia is you and the church choir.

1017
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.940
I was good.
That was good.
So yeah,
I feel like he's like British island.
He though,

1018
01:12:11.970 --> 01:12:14.970
right?
Like he's island island.
That's an interesting one.
When I,

1019
01:12:14.971 --> 01:12:16.170
where the hell is designer from?

1020
01:12:16.171 --> 01:12:21.171
Cause his actions also I don't understand if we can get is fuck out.

1021
01:12:21.451 --> 01:12:24.420
This guy's from New York and he talks like this.

1053
01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:32.720
One thing I do have in common with designer is that he was hydrating and he had,

1054
01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:39.280
did you see that you are much closer to designer then you realize very,

1055
01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:48.340
very true.
What is that song about the panda?
Panda.

It's totally what it is.
Huh?
Wow.

1062

So that's what he's actually saying in that thing.

1063
01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:28.330
It's a car that he likes a BMW.

1064
01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:31.070
I got broads in Atlanta

1065
01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:36.350
credit cards and the scanners hit enough links in the band of black x six
fandom.

1066
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:38.020
White x six looks like a panda.

1067
01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:43.390
That's kind of fun going out like I'm on kind a hundred killers.

I see what all the kids are talking about and I like him.

1072
01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:05.000
They must have sent him a few of them after that.
They were like,

1073
01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:06.940
excellent song designer.

1074
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:12.980

Tommy Lamborghini's and stuff.
Yeah,

1075
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:16.630
you're right.
When you did your first 48 bit,

1076
01:16:16.631 --> 01:16:21.380
those people sent us a bunch of swag.
They were the coolest.
Okay.

1077
01:16:21.530 --> 01:16:25.570
Yeah.
That's cool.
Okay.

1079
01:16:31.630 --> 01:16:34.270
It's a weird like diction that he has for it though.
It's interesting.

1080
01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:39.010
Definitely a pot thought it's a potluck.

1082
01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:47.200

Should he listen to you right now?</v>

1090
01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:48.400
Tell you who I just got,

1091
01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:53.100
I got really into this weekend again.
Uh,

1092
01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:56.290
digital underground again.
That's okay.
Classics.
Yeah.

1093
01:17:56.291 --> 01:17:59.490
So I was really into humpty dance.
Yeah,
same song.

1094
01:17:59.491 --> 01:18:04.260
I played that a lot this weekend.
I know that town you do all around the,

1095
01:18:04.261 --> 01:18:08.460
well,
it's the same song.
It sounds just like him.
And he looked just like,

1096
01:18:08.730 --> 01:18:12.450
all right,
got the nose.
My name is [inaudible] Auntie,

1097
01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:16.560

Okay ladies,

1098
01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:19.110

1099
01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:25.590
July man.
That's it guys.
A good man.
I like that design.

1100
01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:28.920
You know,
I know that shit back when you on TV raps was on.

1101
01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:30.840
That's the kind of shit that's what they played.

1102
01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:33.780
That's the only reason I know that.
It's great to be wraps as good.
Yeah.

1103
01:18:34.530 --> 01:18:39.270
Good for you.
I'm really proud of you.
That sounds like good shit.
Yeah,
thanks man.

1104
01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:42.990
You got it.
Appreciate you man.
And I appreciate it.
I appreciate that.

1105
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:47.620
Uh,
cause he does not like that song.

1106
01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:54.180
The van,
the world saying that's a good number.

1107
01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:57.990
What happened to those guys and that thing,
stuff like that.

1108
01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:02.160
It's everything.
They don't have aids.
The digital underground,

1109
01:19:03.330 --> 01:19:04.530
they probably do actually.

1110
01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:08.940
They're all good banging people in the 80s was their whole thing.
Banging.

1111
01:19:09.170 --> 01:19:11.760
Banging was like their hook.
Yeah.
So it was two live crew.

1112
01:19:11.761 --> 01:19:14.520
Those guys all have these to the,

1113
01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:18.150
they were the west coast version of,
they were a little cleaner though.

1114
01:19:18.151 --> 01:19:22.000
Then the digital underground was way cleaner and then to live,

1115
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:26.520
my God check was just nasty,
nasty,
you know,
digital.

1116
01:19:26.530 --> 01:19:29.010
The ground was like whatever.
I get around.

1117
01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:32.910
Well you gotta know the looks like a pickle and you're like,
whoa,

1118
01:19:32.911 --> 01:19:35.870
that's crazy for three and a burger king.
Yeah.
It was all,

1119
01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:39.840
they didn't metaphors and stuff and two live crew was like face down ass.

1120
01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:44.530
That's the way I do to Brown.
Yeah,

1121
01:19:44.610 --> 01:19:48.990
yeah.
Yes.
That's a two live crew song.

1122
01:19:48.991 --> 01:19:53.550
Linkedin is helpful.
Um,
speaking of that,
I got this.

1123
01:19:53.551 --> 01:19:57.060
This is great.
What do you think's going on here?

<v 9>cruiser.</v>

1125
01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:19.300
<v 4>Most of you have ever heard he got it.
He just ran the paycheck today,
guys,</v>

1126
01:20:19.330 --> 01:20:22.300
just so you know,
it's not a joke.
This isn't a joke.

1127
01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:25.210
You're not supposed to have them.

1128
01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:30.240
Crows and Ravens are serious fucking pets and they can hurt you.

1129
01:20:30.971 --> 01:20:35.140
It's not a joke.
Not a fucking joke.
Okay?
It's not a joke.

1130
01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:40.610
So make sure these things are bucking beaks like a steak knife.

1131
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:58.270
That is the exact noise I make when I bite our son on his stomach every night

1132
01:20:58.310 --> 01:21:01.730
before his bath.
I bite his stomach and I,
I nibble on his,

1133
01:21:01.970 --> 01:21:03.490
on his stomach and I go,

1134
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:16.260
anyways,
ah man,
don't get a pet ravens,

1135
01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:19.240
Ravens,
crows give great knob.
Or

1136
01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:23.400
that's also true.
That's the term that's the trade off.

1137
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:27.030
Is that Crow Zilla we'll can hurt you are,

1138
01:21:27.031 --> 01:21:30.890
and they can also give you a nice neighbor.
So,
uh,

1139
01:21:31.010 --> 01:21:34.220
but there's a video of his,
I watched on gag.

1140
01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:38.190
Do you tube or he's like days dog trainers.

1141
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:42.310
They got pictures of children hugging golden retrievers.

1142
01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:47.280
Don't hug the dog.
The dog doesn't like to be hugged.
That's a human thing.

1143
01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:49.600
That's a new thing that I've been hearing a lot about.

1144
01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:53.280
There was a research that can a scientists there that dogs don't want to be

1145
01:21:53.281 --> 01:21:56.370
hugged.
No,
no,
of course not.
Yeah.
Good job.
Einstein

1146
01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:01.680
there.
It's like he's here with us.
Yeah.

1147
01:22:06.450 --> 01:22:07.620
Oh Man.

1148
01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:16.830
Don't say a fucking thing.
All right.
We're not,
we're done
anyways,

1149
01:22:16.831 --> 01:22:20.090
so mad at us all the time.
So fucking mad.
I only,
what are we doing?

1150
01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:22.950
We're not doing anything.
Well,
no,
fuck off.
You know

1151
01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:29.760
what about what he talks about massaging the puppy.
Yeah.

1152
01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:33.800
Do you have that one?
Of course I have that one.
No,
that.

1153
01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:39.773
<v 13>Okay.</v>

1154
01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:42.430
<v 4>That's what happened in pet raven is like,
oh yeah.</v>

1155
01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:48.010
<v 23>Serious videos.
Serious videos like massaging or puppies.
Fast Hole,</v>

1156
01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:51.880
talking about animal husbandry and put a laugh track in the background.
Like,
oh,

1157
01:22:51.881 --> 01:22:56.590
isn't that funny?
I'll fucking dog assholes
now.

1158
01:22:56.591 --> 01:23:01.100
This is my dog and hope.
Fuck the shit out of you.
Why?

1159
01:23:01.730 --> 01:23:05.560
Oh,
because I love bucking dogs.
I'm just going to take the dog.
Okay,

1160
01:23:09.850 --> 01:23:10.683
<v 4>so funny.</v>

1161
01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:15.850
It's so weird that he's has that stuff and then his videos are totally
different.

1162
01:23:15.851 --> 01:23:18.730
You know?
I know,
I know.
It's like a,
who's the real,

1163
01:23:18.731 --> 01:23:20.380
who's a real Peter know by the way,

1164
01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:25.740
just a reminder that that this second bonus episode that came out on Patrion is

1165
01:23:26.021 --> 01:23:28.180
hard fucking core.
It really is.

1166
01:23:28.690 --> 01:23:31.750
Literally there's milking German tip videos.

1167
01:23:33.230 --> 01:23:35.800
It's censored because,
but yeah.
Yeah.

1168
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:39.550
Well now you can sell your hopes up because it's still hard fucking core.

1169
01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:44.200
But it's like we had to Harv because of,
you know,
whatever.

1170
01:23:44.201 --> 01:23:47.710
But you could audio wise it's still super hard.
Really hard.
Yeah.

1171
01:23:47.711 --> 01:23:50.780
We went old school on it.
Yeah,
we did a what was it?
Uh,

1172
01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:54.910
come of my face videos afternoon.
I'm a come on my glasses.
Yeah.

1173
01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:57.100
Cause I started wearing glasses and people were like,

1174
01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:01.300
why don't you do one of those company?
I was when people come here.
Thanks man.

1175
01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:06.490
That's scary.
Um,
anyways,
I think that's it guys.
Let's,
um,

1176
01:24:06.970 --> 01:24:10.810
let's wrap this up.
Besides the dog's asshole.
You guys,

1177
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:15.970
we love you.
I'm not funny.
Today was a lot of fun.

1178
01:24:15.971 --> 01:24:19.920
We have a fun closing song called wise.
So fad,

1179
01:24:21.870 --> 01:24:26.710
endless.
This is by m see tight jeans.
Oh,
that's a good name.

1180
01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:29.800
So anything else?
Jeans?
Just a reminder,
guys,

1181
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:33.640
if you're forcing those double pipe classics,
uh,
you can't make it rain.

1182
01:24:33.641 --> 01:24:36.610
We learned that today.
It's not natural.
It's not natural from top dog.

1183
01:24:36.611 --> 01:24:38.740
He's got to let it happen.
I've tried to tell you,

1184
01:24:38.741 --> 01:24:40.180
but now hopefully you'll listen to the master.

1185
01:24:40.690 --> 01:24:42.430
And it hasn't happened in a couple of years.

1186
01:24:42.431 --> 01:24:46.540
So even the master hasn't had one in two years.
Can he can recall the last one?

1187
01:24:46.541 --> 01:24:50.980
Yeah.
Yeah.
So don't force them.
It was so amazing.
That was an exempt.

1188
01:24:50.981 --> 01:24:55.870
Makes this an all time classic episode for sure.
All right.
Thanks guys.

1189
01:24:56.570 --> 01:24:57.403
See you next week.

1190
01:25:05.890 --> 01:25:08.020
<v 19>Tom and Armenian friends.
Tommy</v>

1191
01:25:09.710 --> 01:25:12.820
made a sort of day Hashtag Wiseberg so

1192
01:25:18.050 --> 01:25:22.980
I got the joke.
He just has a normal way and it's been like three weeks.

1193
01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:28.673
So

1194
01:25:37.410 --> 01:25:41.960
I mean,
some social media,
Dan Burton,
Chrysler,

1195
01:25:42.150 --> 01:25:44.640
that's a nice shirt.
It was so tight.

1196
01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:49.720
Servers I to die.

1197
01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:52.500
If the spiral

1198
01:25:56.060 --> 01:26:00.930
you start showing the cuisine has changed.

1199
01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:05.270
Okay.
To find a way to say it.
It sounds

1200
01:26:10.450 --> 01:26:11.283
strange.

1201
01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:22.293
Shrink.

1202
01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:40.190
The thing is that nobody does
that.
Nobody.
