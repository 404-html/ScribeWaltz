1
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.290
Well,
welcome to your mom's house.

2
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.090
<v 0>Yeah,
I wouldn't do,
I wouldn't do that guys podcasts either.
Just to be clear.</v>

3
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.500
All right,
we're joined here.
I just wanna make sure I'm right thing right.

4
00:00:32.501 --> 00:00:36.170
Is it tome
well?
Yes,
yes.

5
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.800
Tome Tommy.
Do you ever get a,

6
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.360
by the way I on the phone sometimes it's super frustrating when,
I mean I could,

7
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:45.520
I'll say this,

8
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.240
I could tell sometimes it's English as a second language person has,

9
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.460
they'll be like your name and autonomy.
Like I'm sorry,
I'm like Tom.

10
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.660
And they're like,
could you spell it?
And they were like,

11
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.460
Tom,
like right.
Have you had heard this one yet?
Is this a new one?

12
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.940
Because like it should have been one of the ones you've heard a lot so far.

13
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.980
I do feel like it's super short.
Like it would be like a two syllable name,

14
00:01:08.981 --> 00:01:11.020
like you know at least.
Yeah,

15
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.460
right Christine now like people can like go with your time is like,
it's so flat,

16
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.490
but it is.
It is like,
and then you could hear people go,
John.
I'm like,
no,
no,
no,

17
00:01:18.491 --> 00:01:19.600
no.
I understand that.

18
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.620
What's more alarming or the amount of people who are so lazy that they've known

19
00:01:23.621 --> 00:01:26.050
us for a while and they'd be like,
how is Christine doing?
But I'm like,

20
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.140
I've known you for five years.
For five years.
You haven't gotten her name right.

21
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.650
Oh,
we have these good friends of ours.
We thought they were pretty good.

22
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.520
They're good friends,
but we haven't.
And so they're in their defense.

23
00:01:39.521 --> 00:01:41.740
We haven't seen him in like a couple of years.
They've been,

24
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.440
everyone's been traveling and says,
but it's been rough.
But you know,

25
00:01:44.441 --> 00:01:48.010
we were pretty hardcore vacations that the data together that's close.

26
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.050
And she said,
um,
so,
and what grade is your oldest in?

27
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.420
I was like,
Angie,
the oldest?
Yeah.
It was like,

28
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.830
Oh man,
I guess we were completely out out of your mind.

29
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.580
You don't think about us at all now we forgot.
I forgot.

30
00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:08.740
We forgot your child's name.

31
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.060
We hung out with and give Christmas presents to sometimes too.
You know,

32
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.530
it's like,
I'm kind of like defending us because we go and we,

33
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.720
we meet more people than most people do,
right?
Yes.
And you know,

34
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.220
there's,
there are clubs that everybody that you love and you walk into,
right.

35
00:02:27.221 --> 00:02:30.880
And you're like,
it's so good to be back.
And sometimes it'll be,
you know,

36
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.480
let's say six or seven people on that staff,
right.

37
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.990
And they all say something to you and then you're like,
what's up dude?

38
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.420
Everybody did.
Yeah,
it's James Bro.
And you're like,
no,

39
00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:47.110
I know.
And they're like,
they'll catch you.

40
00:02:47.111 --> 00:02:50.770
That's the worst I just did this weekend.
I'm such a shithead.

41
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.780
I was in Saint Louis tits and my feature act,
I go,
oh,
hi,
nice to meet you.
And,

42
00:02:55.781 --> 00:02:58.990
and like the first night went by and by the second night he goes,

43
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.820
know we've worked together before.
How long ago,
Bro?

44
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.260
He was like three years ago.
I'm such an asshole.
Sorry.

45
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.320
Out of you get a pass though,
I think,
you know,

46
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.740
headline or you get a pass.
It's going around.

47
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:19.240
You're meeting so many people working with so many people.
So popular,
so popular.

48
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.680
Yeah,

49
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.120
it's come on my favorite sometimes people go after the show,
they go,

50
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:29.110
you remember me?
An audience person.
They're like,

51
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.150
it's fucking San Francisco.
A couple of years ago,

52
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.280
I was the guy that yelled out pastrami sandwich and they're like,
yes,

53
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.130
you,
you,
you yelled that out.
A Pastrami Joan.

54
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.790
Like you're like,
and they're like,

55
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:46.280
and then you said the thing back and you're like,
I know.
I remember now I just,

56
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.640
I forgot for a second.
You just jostled it from my,
how about when you're,

57
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.750
when the same thing goes down.
Hey,
you remember me?
You were in San Francisco.

58
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.950
I remember me.
Yeah.
Hey,
yeah.
How's it going?
Good.

59
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.510
Pascack hills high school,
right?
You remember?
Oh right.

60
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.580
Like it's not even in that context of the club.
Right.

61
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.510
And it's something from your childhood or your cousin or something and they're

62
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:15.160
like,
oh,
I'm off all,
I guess I don't remember you at all.
Well,

63
00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:19.840
they say that forgetting names is means that you think more about yourself than

64
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:23.020
other people.
So you know what's wrong with that?

65
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.090
What about faces?
I,
I tend to remember people's faces,

66
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:31.690
but not always the name.
That means I'm half observant.

67
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:35.770
Maybe care a little bit,
but not enough,
but not enough.

68
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.420
And the truth is you remember the names of everyone that you want to remember,

69
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.520
right?
I mean,
right.
Christine,
Christine,
so unmemorable I must not be

70
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.470
floors.
I just got it today.
It was like,
I love your podcast Christine.
I'm like,

71
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.220
what?
How much you love it?
Not that much.
Yeah.
Yeah,

72
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.590
we get that too about it.
Like in the,
you know when you do like press radio,

73
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.000
I think it's like,
so it shows like a level of just,

74
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.850
it's again,
it's like laziness and just as zero regard when they go like,

75
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.780
and then we have you on the,
you know,

76
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:16.570
and so they have a computer and they're like,
you're here.

77
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.040
He's got a great podcast called the good go over to you see your mom.

78
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.600
I'm like,
you couldn't just like type that shit in and read it man.

79
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.960
Like Google my name.
And they're like,
what is it called again?
I'm like,

80
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:32.710
it's fucking,
you have a screen in front of you and you just don't care.
Yeah.

81
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:37.090
Screw you.
All right,
let's open the show.
Here we go.

82
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.510
Papa's here.
Let's have some fun.
Here we go.

83
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.383
<v 2>What's up?</v>

84
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.640
A couple of questions.
I'm sure all of you

85
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.190
people are dying to know.

86
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.740
<v 1>How do you wipe your butt with those long nails</v>

87
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.740
was Randy,
don't bring anyone in loving.
Well,

88
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.660
well we'll go to your mom's house.

89
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.890
We can tone.
So
Christina.

90
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.223
Okay.

91
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.750
You got to tell him you got it.
Got It.

92
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.990
<v 3>Good Times,
right?
Tom's good.
Okay.
Tom?
Skin tone.
Who's here?</v>

93
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.390
How much did you hear that growing up?
Yeah.

94
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:14.130
Was like a real,
yeah,
you're like,
yeah,
but then I owned it and I,
I took,
I took,

95
00:07:14.131 --> 00:07:18.390
I got a better joke with my name.
You did?
Yeah.
It was a,

96
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.570
cause there was like a lot of Mama,
Papa,
a lot of Poopa,
a lot of that.

97
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.730
And then I came up with Papa boner.
Oh yeah,
it was,

98
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.900
it was the mic drop in third grade.
Sure.
Awesome.
Though.

99
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:36.090
That's the best thing about it.
Figure out a way to own the reverse.

100
00:07:36.091 --> 00:07:38.260
The bullying.
They're like,
now you fucking love me.

101
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.940
If he could do that to his own name,
what could he do to mind?
Oh man,

102
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.620
that's so great.
Yeah.
Where did you grow up again?
New Jersey,
North Jersey,

103
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:50.880
North Jersey.
Is that like close to Philly?
No,
that's South Jersey.

104
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:56.160
North Jersey is like 30 minutes outside of New York.
Oh,
okay.
And um,
yeah,

105
00:07:56.161 --> 00:08:00.000
like a right on the border of like New York state.
Yeah,
it was a,

106
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:04.410
it was a cool spot to grow up.
Yeah.
Giants Stadium More Than Eagle Stadium.

107
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.910
A Meadowlands is that,
yes.
Okay.
Yes.
Are you still a big giants fan?

108
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.090
I am.
It's cool to have that.

109
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.940
Like that's the thing about sports that like,
you know,

110
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.220
I think is great.

111
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:22.410
The longer you know you're around is like having a little piece of home and

112
00:08:22.411 --> 00:08:26.320
having some emotional attachment to it.
Yeah,
that's what,

113
00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.580
that's the fun part of sports.
Like I never get when someone's like,
yeah,

114
00:08:29.581 --> 00:08:30.271
I love sports.

115
00:08:30.271 --> 00:08:32.910
I don't really care who when I'm like then you're not getting the thrill of it.

116
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.890
Thrill is that you're either really excited or super bummed out and angry.
Yeah.

117
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.620
That's the fun part.
So you're having like a pretty good time I guess right now.

118
00:08:40.621 --> 00:08:45.060
I mean it's up and down all the time,
but like giants are fun team.
The follow.

119
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.760
They stink this year though,
there's a lot of chaos,

120
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:51.180
but I'm also a Yankee fan and they just got in the playoffs and I come.

121
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:56.100
My whole house is girls who,
and nobody cares.
So I just like walk around

122
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.090
<v 0>the house.
Like y'all yesterday,
Yankees were in the playoffs,
let's hear it.</v>

123
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.300
And they're just like,
ah,
we don't know what that means,

124
00:09:03.301 --> 00:09:07.920
but we know we don't like it.
That's how I feel.
Yeah.
It was completely mad.

125
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.880
And I went through periods,
especially when I was first dating my wife,

126
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.060
where I was like,
yeah,
you know,
I'll watch a little baseball.

127
00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:18.750
But I was never like a all in sports guy,
like all the time.
Yeah.

128
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.980
But then like once we had kids and moved along and stuff,

129
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:27.420
I started watching more sports because it was just a way to shut down it.

130
00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:31.650
Just kind of tune them out.
Yeah.
Tune everything out.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
It's great.

131
00:09:31.651 --> 00:09:36.450
It's actually great disconnecting from your life.
Yeah.

132
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.890
Wife,
did you say why?
Yeah.
Yeah.
White.
Wait,
wait,

133
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.770
I can't hear you.
Yeah,
yeah,
I hear you.

134
00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.130
It's interesting because sport Tog is a shorthand for gentlemen.

135
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.570
Like if you'll notice every time we do have a guy guests,

136
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.460
which is mostly all our guests now,
it's like sports first.
Oh,

137
00:09:53.461 --> 00:09:55.110
we get it out of the way.
And then you're like,

138
00:09:55.111 --> 00:09:57.420
what's your team was doing all right.
Good.
And then you can go on.

139
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.660
It's everything else.
It's like your,
your butt's sniff.
Yes.
It really is.
Yeah.

140
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.690
It's strange.

141
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.390
And then when you meet someone who is not intuitive at all and uh,

142
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.650
it's the kind of unsettling in a way,
even if you're not really,
yeah.

143
00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:16.290
Weird saying.
Yeah,
actually.
Yeah.
I don't expect,
I don't expect girls to,
like,

144
00:10:16.291 --> 00:10:18.480
I don't follow baseball at all.

145
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.980
[inaudible] but sometimes I'll meet a guy and he'll be like,
whoa,
you know,

146
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.930
I don't like really I think about baseball and I'd be like,
yeah,
okay.

147
00:10:24.931 --> 00:10:27.870
But I get that like you right.
You like one of the things,
right?

148
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.430
You like something with a ball.
Yeah.

149
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.230
We don't have to be really smart to enjoy.

150
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:39.270
Now I hit up calm before the show and he was like,
I have a huge long nail.

151
00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:43.670
Fetish.
Do you have any
of that?
Right.
I love them.
Yeah.

152
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.100
I'm no longer the better.
This is an email from his fight guy.

153
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:51.180
Say One of my favorite files.
Crazy.
Um,
but anyways,
they asked this lady,

154
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.090
how should I actually would think that too,
right?

155
00:10:54.091 --> 00:10:58.620
If you saw these crazy long nail,
how do you do any number of things?

156
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.440
But why?
How did she wipe her binder?
She pick her nose.

157
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.990
How does she wipe her butt?
How does she work?
Shoes.

158
00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.300
<v 2>Ah,
ah,
all of it.</v>

159
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:11.830
Demonstration demonstration or are you going to take a shit?
Good.

160
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.060
Okay.
So we can finally put the

161
00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:19.530
central roll of paper like this.
That's like you got it on a paper towel

162
00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:25.320
and then I do like the,
I've got a smell

163
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:29.820
<v 0>nasty.
Oh wait.
Does she,</v>

164
00:11:29.821 --> 00:11:33.390
did you see the clip in the beginning and I don't want to direct you,

165
00:11:33.391 --> 00:11:36.960
but did you see when the glanced by her foot?
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's a lot too,
right?

166
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.180
Yeah.
Those are all two.
We're going to talk about that too.

167
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:43.200
I'm pretty sure this lady was on Tlc.
I think we shot,

168
00:11:43.201 --> 00:11:48.090
we saw like a super produced segment on her.
Oh my God.
Wait,

169
00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:48.924
but

170
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.770
<v 2>cause she want,
but look how much he's got to use so much paper.</v>

171
00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:55.510
This one we need to be day.
Yes.
Right.

172
00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.520
Okay.
And then I'll take it.
Oh

173
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.890
No,
this is just,
I'm on tender hooks right now.

174
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.943
There

175
00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.790
is a bike where she should only be,
yeah,

176
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:18.710
I'll take it and make sure you get all of it all up and see.

177
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:24.130
Oh,
she doesn't get that Sunday.
What about which is a real sloppy one?
No,

178
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:24.700
you really

179
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.960
<v 3>got a really wide,
no,
she needs a permanent but day the washlet.
Yeah,</v>

180
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:33.280
she needs a hose.
Yeah.
In a yard.
Yeah.
And a ma'am,

181
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.540
praise it in there.
Right.
It's somewhere with dead deadly accuracy.

182
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:43.970
This is just just a hands up against the fence and it's time to blast and you

183
00:12:44.861 --> 00:12:48.850
just like let her collected throughout the day and then it's six o'clock at

184
00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:51.800
night.
That's when your hose her off.
What are you,

185
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:57.550
what are you doing with your life?
You're not,
we're,
but I'm saying like,

186
00:12:57.551 --> 00:12:59.890
yeah,
why would you inconvenience yourself?
Just to be like,

187
00:12:59.891 --> 00:13:02.830
I'm the super gross long nails person.
That's her identity.

188
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:07.320
It's her mark as it is.
Right?
It's like I'm the parrot guy on the exotic pet guy.

189
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:11.950
The Boa guy.
Yeah.
I'm the Albino Boa.
Yeah.
It's funny.

190
00:13:11.951 --> 00:13:13.180
We watched the,

191
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:17.860
we watched the whole segment on this guy in Mexico with the world's biggest

192
00:13:17.861 --> 00:13:20.840
penis and it turns out that,
uh,

193
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.420
and it was absolutely enormous.
We're talking like down to the ankle.

194
00:13:25.421 --> 00:13:30.421
But what they discovered when they did these cat scans was that the penis

195
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.230
actually was under all this extra skin.
It was like,
ah,

196
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.430
so penis actually was let's say whatever,
seven inches.

197
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.010
And then he had overgrown skin texture,

198
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.430
trunk callus skin.
Yeah.
Like al Roker extra skin like that,
right.

199
00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:49.960
That had grown and,
and,

200
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:53.760
and give and give and give would give you the illusion if you're acting like

201
00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:57.310
that's all penis,
but it really is excess skin.

202
00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:01.540
So then they go and it,
Emily,
this guy can't go,
he can't walk.

203
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:05.890
It just flops against his legs and it's like [inaudible].

204
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.680
It's like an elephant trunk.
Right.
So then they go,

205
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:10.900
there's these doctors were like,
you,
you know,

206
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.180
you can't even enjoy life with this.

207
00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.360
They offered to do a surgery.
We were like,

208
00:14:16.361 --> 00:14:18.330
well we'll remove all this excess skin.

209
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.660
Still leave you with your above average penis.
Right.

210
00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.810
But let you kind of function instead of living this way.

211
00:14:25.811 --> 00:14:27.100
But which was like a horrible,

212
00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:29.980
they showed like his quality of life and he was like,
Nah,

213
00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:36.040
I like having this crazy huge penis and people being like,
Whoa,

214
00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:38.610
like looking at me like the fuck is that thing.
Yeah.

215
00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:42.970
Cause I'd rather have that right.
Then you get me back like a normal life.

216
00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:47.810
So yeah,
he wants to be special.
They take that away from him.

217
00:14:47.811 --> 00:14:51.070
He's got to come up.
He's got to develop a skill or a hobby or that's right.

218
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.030
He's got to sing.
He's got

219
00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:55.550
<v 0>to be something to be special.
That's true.
Now he's like,
here you go,
ladies,</v>

220
00:14:56.310 --> 00:15:01.280
rummage through this laundry basket and see if you can find it.
It's so bad.

221
00:15:01.281 --> 00:15:02.870
And he's like,
it just drips all day.

222
00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:08.240
So he's so complicated.
Yeah.
It's not even functional.

223
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.140
He can't have intercourse with people.
He can't.
No,

224
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:15.090
can't you just drape it over them like a,
like a parachute.

225
00:15:15.091 --> 00:15:17.120
It's wrapped up in like a gauze

226
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:24.900
unusable.
It's weird.
It's kind of treats it like a,

227
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:29.660
it's like asking a Siamese twin if they want to split.
Yeah.
Oh,

228
00:15:29.661 --> 00:15:33.280
here it is about your Siamese twin.
Can't talk.
Yeah,

229
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:39.320
so like here's how it hangs and there's just cloths like a horse and like

230
00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:43.550
wrapped.
There's stuff wrapped on it.
Yeah.
It'll just chafe.

231
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:48.020
Oh that's not for decoration but may views and like a Mexican parade or

232
00:15:48.021 --> 00:15:50.100
something.
That's opinion,

233
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:54.410
but see it's like a doorframe like okay,
this is from the lake,

234
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:56.030
that cat scan thing.

235
00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:01.510
It's like penis is here in the middle and you're saying that this is penis.

236
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:07.110
This is like skin outside and they're like access.

237
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:12.410
Your penis actually ends way before all this excess growth.

238
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.840
I'm so confused and it looks like they skinned a horse.

239
00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.150
I know this is just like a hi,

240
00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.260
whatever tography scan.
But Tom,

241
00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:25.010
you don't understand the medical.
Wow.

242
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:27.140
I'd say that is know.

243
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.950
What I like though is that whoever is searching for the penis guy is also

244
00:16:30.951 --> 00:16:33.610
interested in dinosaurs.
Here's Princess of Wales.

245
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:43.070
That's why he does it for that moment.
Yeah.
Right,
right.

246
00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:48.260
So walk where people go.
That Bay just for those faces.
Those faces.
Yeah.

247
00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:53.000
We want to look at his apartment.
What else does he got going on?
I know.
No,

248
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:56.170
this is it.
That's the truth is I look at the apart.
Yeah.
That's his whole life.

249
00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.190
Hey ladies,
I can make that work.
So why couldn't he have sex with that?

250
00:17:01.191 --> 00:17:05.720
It looks like he could.
Well I mean I think with a normal sized woman,

251
00:17:05.721 --> 00:17:08.930
but because it's all,
it's all like hardened skin,

252
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:13.460
the last inches of it or it's just calloused skin.
It's not even a penis.

253
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.850
It's like overgrowth of us.
You can still give kisses if you want.

254
00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.680
You want to do that.
You could hug.
Do you?
Could you hug it?
Yeah.

255
00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:24.050
Cause you caught all in it.
Totally shot with it.

256
00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.780
You can hide a little peanuts in the top of it and see if your dog or your

257
00:17:29.781 --> 00:17:33.100
squirrel can find
a,

258
00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:38.480
that is really creepy.
But she grew it like she's deliberate.

259
00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:44.450
What's worse though?
Do you think?
The hands or the feet?
That's the real question.

260
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:48.890
I mean,
the feet,
the feet seemed like a much bigger inconvenience.

261
00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.550
I mean like these are terrible.
Nothing the doors and handshakes,
but like those,

262
00:17:53.551 --> 00:17:56.630
you can't put shoes on those Tutsis.
Ah,

263
00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:01.680
I mean it's just,
if we could just remove it from the convenience for her.

264
00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:06.090
How about how disgusted we are?
I say the feed,

265
00:18:06.091 --> 00:18:08.490
I can't even,
I can't look at feet normally.

266
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.620
Now you got these big jabber claws coming off.
I um,

267
00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:17.790
AH,
real upset as I think I found,

268
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.440
I think this is her on the TLC show.
God See,

269
00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:24.230
<v 4>ah,</v>

270
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:27.560
<v 0>God,
that's so much worse.
So much worse.</v>

271
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.750
Toenails prevent her from getting exercise she needs,
he says,
I can't exercise

272
00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:40.400
beats that big toe.
Way Worse,
way worser

273
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:46.340
and worser.
Only way to normalize this is she found the dude who's like,
man,

274
00:18:46.341 --> 00:18:49.680
it's awesome.
I'd like,
you know,
like there's a guy who's like,
this is perfect.

275
00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.570
It's the guy who was like,
I'll take care of you.
I'll drive you everywhere.

276
00:18:53.571 --> 00:18:58.010
I'll put your sneakers on,
cut the toes off so that the nails can dangle.

277
00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:02.930
I'll paint them.
I'll make sure I punched anyone that gets a two yard.

278
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:08.230
His identity.
What are you looking at?
Sorry.

279
00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:12.700
She's just shopping.
Just like the rest of you.
What do you,
right?

280
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:14.300
He's that guy,
right?

281
00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:18.030
This job is to get offended at everyone else's normal reaction.
Right?

282
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.900
We never saw a foot before.
You never saw an elegant ladies foot.
Not

283
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.340
that big toe.

284
00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:36.500
So much worse than everything else on her toenails.
Oh,
this is a dance class

285
00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:49.490
and she's got the big scissor hands up around his back as the toes are coming in

286
00:19:49.491 --> 00:19:52.430
for her.
She ain't telling him like get a little too close.
Like that's your life.

287
00:19:52.431 --> 00:19:57.350
Your life is like,
watch out for these nails.
Don't touch my nails,
man.

288
00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:02.770
She can't work.
How does she text?
That's the most important thing.
You're right.

289
00:20:02.771 --> 00:20:06.900
Yeah.
How she swiping.
That is what's his,

290
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:07.850
what's his problem?

291
00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.820
He needs the enabling identity.
Maybe his,

292
00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:18.910
he feels special being next to someone that he's perceiving US special.

293
00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.240
You know?
That's the thing.
It's like this person is special right here,
man.

294
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:25.130
They got crazy nails when they befriended me.

295
00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.530
Like that isn't guardians to be,

296
00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.260
but what if he met her and she was just Kinda like regular nails?
No,

297
00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.490
they slowly started to grow.
Oh.
And then he's like,

298
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:36.470
so baby thinking you're thinking,

299
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.230
what are you thinking about to Roto spa this weekend?

300
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:41.690
I got you a gift certificate.

301
00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:46.890
They'll do both top and bottom because I don't even worry about it.
You pick,

302
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:51.190
he met her after it was big
for a while.

303
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.940
The thing is if you've ever had long toenails,
you know,

304
00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.380
you know when they're uncomfortable.

305
00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:58.690
Like when you put on your sneakers and you're like,
Ooh,

306
00:20:58.691 --> 00:21:01.830
this is time to cut that big towel.
I think it's time to go.
Yeah.

307
00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.540
Could you imagine like going past that?

308
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:09.990
I can't stand it for like a day she can lay in bed with someone now.

309
00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:14.140
Right?
I mean you mentioned like that cutting you,
you'd be like,
Nah,
fuck.

310
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.580
That would be like for real like a knife.
Like somebody kicking you in a knife.

311
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:20.950
It's nasty.
She is the worst

312
00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:26.830
back with their duty.
Definitely doesn't get off her shit.

313
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:34.690
Garbage,
garbage.
Is this Mexico City?

314
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.960
No,
the baby wipes.

315
00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.750
Everybody voted here
with a nasty,

316
00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.750
nasty or not.
She gets it.

317
00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:03.130
I like
baby wipe.

318
00:22:03.131 --> 00:22:07.690
Kind of just takes away any kind of bad feeling.
Well,
we have a baby.

319
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:11.320
Yeah.
That was not just regular paper you think were nasty now,
but look,

320
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.650
I got to think of any boys

321
00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:19.900
were nasty.
Do you think that like knock long nail crew like she's like,

322
00:22:19.901 --> 00:22:24.260
people think that people like us with these nails,
a collective

323
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:30.280
schnitzel Hayes long nails too,
and that's what this is all about.
Yeah.

324
00:22:30.281 --> 00:22:34.740
She's like,
move on.
This is disgusting.
Oh,

325
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:38.230
I have to tell you something that happened to me.
A TSA agent.

326
00:22:38.231 --> 00:22:40.450
I was flying to Saint Louis this weekend.

327
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.520
Comedy works sweatshirt and it said,

328
00:22:44.521 --> 00:22:49.521
you know comedy works Denver on the side and TSA agent looks at me and she goes,

329
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.030
yes it does.
Comedy does work.

330
00:22:55.770 --> 00:23:00.660
It's a good one.
All you got to laugh.
That's great.

331
00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:02.320
I never thought of those words that way.

332
00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.760
I guess if you didn't know it was a comedy club,
you'd think that too.
Like,
oh,

333
00:23:06.761 --> 00:23:09.130
what a positive lady that is wearing that sweatshirt.

334
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.690
You gotta tell the crew comedy.
He said that,
that's really comedy and prayer.

335
00:23:13.691 --> 00:23:14.524
They both

336
00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:20.880
two main things that get me through life and laughter and Guy Craze.

337
00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:28.170
Comedy.
Jesus.
Yeah,

338
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:33.310
it's a good one.
Yeah.
She was sweet.
Speaking of blind people,

339
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:34.470
somebody that we got,

340
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:37.510
we got a lot of questions about the deaf and the blind right

341
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:41.320
before you jump into that,
just off of blind people.

342
00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:45.130
It happened to me at a club this week.
A guy comes up with is blind

343
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.900
<v 3>and he goes,
can we,
hey,
can we get a picture?</v>

344
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:52.820
Dave's blind and he's got the stick and he,
you know,
it is clearly blind.
I say,

345
00:23:52.821 --> 00:23:57.050
yeah,
sure.
Of course.
Come on over here,
you know,
and uh,
his,
so it's me,

346
00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:58.550
the me,

347
00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:02.510
the blind guys in the middle and his friends on the other side and his friend

348
00:24:02.511 --> 00:24:06.470
has them turn the other way.
No.
So it's the back of his head.
And I'm like,

349
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:09.470
I said to the blind guy,
he's messing with you.
He was like,

350
00:24:09.471 --> 00:24:12.700
he does this every time.
Just let it go.
I'm never going to see it.

351
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:17.220
<v 5>That's great.</v>

352
00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:22.270
<v 0>I love that.
Have a blind friend you just messed with.
Yeah.
I love that.</v>

353
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:24.940
Um,
email says hello mommies.

354
00:24:24.941 --> 00:24:27.790
I have a totally blind neighbor that walks his dog around the neighborhood every

355
00:24:27.791 --> 00:24:31.720
day.
The other day coming home,
I see him picking up his small dogs poop.

356
00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.160
How do blind people will know their dog is pooping?
Oh,

357
00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:36.160
not just smelling something or taking a break.

358
00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.390
How do they find it and pick it up?
Keep them high and tight.
Big Fan.
Michael.

359
00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.240
See on the surface,
that seems like a stupid question,

360
00:24:43.241 --> 00:24:45.730
but now that I think about it,
yeah.
How would would,

361
00:24:45.731 --> 00:24:49.810
this goes back to degrees of blindness.
Awesome.
Because you know,

362
00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.070
somebody can be legally blind or you know,
medically they're,

363
00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:58.060
they're considered blind and disabled in that regard.

364
00:24:58.061 --> 00:25:01.510
But they might be,
have,
you know,
just see the can't drive,

365
00:25:01.511 --> 00:25:05.870
but they see shadows and shakes and then there's like black out total blindness.

366
00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:11.940
I think this is probably his neighbor is probably somebody that has some visual

367
00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:17.340
ability.
He's totally blind.
I think so,
yeah.
Just figuring it out.

368
00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:21.140
<v 3>Super Blind.
Really good.
Stick dog.
Yeah.</v>

369
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.520
He's out there with them.

370
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.060
And then you just wait for all of the grunting to start.
Yeah.

371
00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.550
I mean,
you guys don't have it cause your dog so small,
but give a big dog.
They,

372
00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:37.250
it's like a man like,
oh yeah,
no.
Yeah.
Are you being serious?

373
00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:42.380
Ah,
Ooh,
I was what doing to do that through my dog talks.

374
00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.330
Uh,
now there's no grunting,
but you,

375
00:25:44.331 --> 00:25:47.770
you know what it is the jingle Jangle of like they're walking,
walking,
right.

376
00:25:47.771 --> 00:25:50.540
And then they do that circle.
Yeah.
When they're getting ready as teaching,

377
00:25:50.541 --> 00:25:53.150
teaching,
teaching made me as a poop bell on him.

378
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.400
<v 0>Finding the specific place to grab though is kind of dicey.
Right.
I mean,</v>

379
00:25:58.401 --> 00:26:01.730
even with perfect vision,
you're like,
oh,
you,
you're real careful.

380
00:26:01.731 --> 00:26:05.600
Usually pick that up.
Yeah.
That's a good point.
Yeah.

381
00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:10.240
<v 3>Because I,
I don't see that great.
And um,</v>

382
00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:14.860
but I,
you know,
I can see,
and it's hard to find my dog's sometime.
Yeah.

383
00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.570
Especially when she just goes out in the backyard.

384
00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:18.300
<v 0>Well,
maybe,
so we've been getting a lot of feedback.</v>

385
00:26:18.301 --> 00:26:23.190
Maybe some blind people can can maybe back.
Maybe this blind person faking it.

386
00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:24.790
I've done that before too.

387
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:30.540
<v 5>No,
I liked it.
Like the Stena thanks.</v>

388
00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:32.590
<v 0>Uh Huh.</v>

389
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:37.360
<v 5>No baby by fake fake pickup.</v>

390
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:44.190
<v 0>Hey,
you ever fake fake
one of those people?</v>

391
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.220
I tell them like,
I can't,
I don't have the time for this.
And I put 10,

392
00:26:47.221 --> 00:26:51.360
like I'm picking it up.
I don't want just all,
it's terrible.
Terrible.
Yeah.

393
00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.990
I feel bad when I walked the dog and then I'm like,

394
00:26:54.991 --> 00:26:58.530
she goes or I forget a bag.
Yeah.

395
00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:00.150
And that's always when they,

396
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:03.510
when she goes to the bathroom in front of the neighbors are coming out of their

397
00:27:03.511 --> 00:27:06.420
door.
So maybe now I'll just,

398
00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:10.800
as we meet weekly,
go up the street,
I'll just yell.
I'm blind.

399
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:17.370
Gimme a break.
I'm blind.
I'm totally,
by the way,

400
00:27:17.371 --> 00:27:22.290
I have done the,
uh,
the Walkworth fuck,
I forgot the bag and you know,

401
00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:25.970
and I've done the like the fake fake,
fake,
fake

402
00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:32.040
stuff stinks.
It's true.

403
00:27:32.041 --> 00:27:33.030
Before I had a dog,

404
00:27:33.031 --> 00:27:36.960
I would always say that dog people are the worst because they would always find

405
00:27:36.961 --> 00:27:38.910
stuff like they never,
you know,

406
00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.490
and then once you have a dog you realize they're not just,

407
00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:46.000
they're not bad people.
They're just struggling.
There's some days you forget,

408
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:47.630
some days you forget,

409
00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:53.760
some days it's just dark out and went up our street and that right.

410
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:58.020
We'd take a ride on a big big dog,
shit flattened.

411
00:27:58.021 --> 00:27:59.100
So like some of the stuff on it.

412
00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:04.410
And then the next day I went the same route and there was a new one next to it.

413
00:28:04.411 --> 00:28:07.980
So like this dog is shitting on the sidewalk and the person walked.
It's like,

414
00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:10.020
yeah,
that's where you should be shooting here.

415
00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.930
It was a collection of these big dog shits.
They're

416
00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:18.250
nasty.
Super Nasty are tiny.
Yeah.

417
00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:23.050
They make like cat shits.
It's,
it's never like,
you know,
fucking cuts.

418
00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:26.220
Yeah,
there was,
we had a small dog.
I wanted a small dog.

419
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:30.750
Well as your dad say to you,
what did you say?
The reason we had small dog,

420
00:28:30.751 --> 00:28:35.520
he says,
because the big dog makes big shit.
Small dog mix.
Small Shit.

421
00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:39.690
Always get small dog.
He's a poet.

422
00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:42.480
He's right.

423
00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:47.070
He's totally right and like know the jumping up on people.

424
00:28:47.071 --> 00:28:49.800
They get excited and say hello.
It said your ankle is no big deal.

425
00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:54.930
My talks like a horse,
a lab.
Black lines are so cute.

426
00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.100
They are great dogs,
man.
I mean people come over,
she jumps up,

427
00:28:59.101 --> 00:29:03.120
she's just like same height as them and she does.
I mean she,

428
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:08.220
she shits like a man.
It's no joke.
It's no joke.

429
00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:14.110
She shed in your backyard.
Yeah,
she's ruined the yard were literate.

430
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:18.540
Right.
My wife right now is with a guy trying to figure out how to fix the art.

431
00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.350
We,
we uh,

432
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:24.350
we call dog shit just like fence off an area and you train them.

433
00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:29.880
It's not there.
I'll show you how to do it at our old house.

434
00:29:29.881 --> 00:29:33.870
I let them shit everywhere and then the whole line is ruined and it's like a

435
00:29:33.871 --> 00:29:38.520
mine field.
But if you tell them like this is your one area,
you just train them.

436
00:29:38.521 --> 00:29:42.100
Okay,
come on dog.
Shit Alley.
And then he only go there just

437
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.890
<v 3>for paying also.
No Brown,
Brown and yellow,</v>

438
00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:48.640
but the thing is it's going to mess up the grass there but it's rather than one

439
00:29:48.641 --> 00:29:52.140
area.
One spot.
Yeah.
It looks like a mom.

440
00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.930
I mean it's just all burned out.
The whole thing we're thinking about paving it.

441
00:29:56.300 --> 00:30:00.410
Ah.
I think it's about just putting like seriously like put making it into a

442
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.880
<v 0>patio.
Then</v>

443
00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:09.250
give it a whirl this morning.
Hi Guys.

444
00:30:09.251 --> 00:30:10.420
I'm new to the podcast.

445
00:30:10.421 --> 00:30:14.200
I've been thinking about this for years and I think you might have some insight

446
00:30:14.201 --> 00:30:17.040
to offer.
Do you retired people dream in retarded tennis,

447
00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:21.610
terrible or do they dream just like you and I are all the dream.

448
00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:24.940
Are All the people in their dreams retarded?
I really liked to know.
Thanks guys.

449
00:30:24.941 --> 00:30:27.910
Daniel,
that is a very insensitive question,

450
00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:30.610
but I have to say you have piqued my interest.

451
00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:34.510
I also would like to know from somebody if,

452
00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:40.480
no,
let me clarify the question.

453
00:30:40.481 --> 00:30:44.040
The question is do they,
are the themes of the dreams retarded?
No,

454
00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:49.940
no,
no.
What they're asking is they're not,

455
00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:51.730
you're not retarded themes.

456
00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.000
This is all right.
I am,
I am.

457
00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.070
There's absolutely shameless.

458
00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:05.080
They're saying is a retarded person because we've asked before,
like,

459
00:31:05.081 --> 00:31:07.320
does a retarded person know they're retarded.
Right.

460
00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:10.810
And we've had a lot of people weigh in and like the people that teach special
ed,

461
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:14.430
sorry,
so an appropriate approach.

462
00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:20.370
But this question is about dreams and whether or not the dreams are filled with

463
00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:27.480
people that are,
oh,
also retard.
Oh,
just the,
just the,
uh,

464
00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:31.800
just think that's not just what's going on.
Yeah,
I think so.

465
00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.550
I think I would like to you,

466
00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:37.580
they're not just really excited in the mall to see something.

467
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:40.960
It's not that kind of stuff.
It's like,
it's all chocolate.

468
00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:53.730
<v 3>I was,
did a show this weekend and there were,
um,
where were you people?</v>

469
00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:58.590
I was at a comics and Mohegan Sun.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.
And uh,

470
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.980
they said that,
um,
there were two special ed teachers are,

471
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.680
there was a lot of special ed teachers.
Actually,

472
00:32:04.681 --> 00:32:09.240
it was like two in one show and it was like a theme.
And um,
when I was a kid,

473
00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.380
we had special Ed.

474
00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:14.710
It was just for the kids who smoked pot and give the teacher the finger.
Right,

475
00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:19.410
right.
And they are like,
no,
these are like really special needs.
They're like,

476
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.940
you know,
they really,
yeah,
they really,
yeah.
Yeah.
It's a little harder.

477
00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:27.060
Genres evolved since we went to school is what you're saying?
Yeah.
Yeah.

478
00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:31.020
We had to do volunteer work or senior year of high school,

479
00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:33.660
so a friend of mine and I owe as seniors,

480
00:32:33.661 --> 00:32:38.370
we went to this special needs school and we would volunteer during our lunch

481
00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:39.980
hour there.
Right.
The one thing that blew

482
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.750
<v 0>my mind was the range of kids there were.
Yeah.</v>

483
00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:50.250
There were kids that had attitude problems right next to a kids that could not

484
00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:55.370
speak like chair and couldn't move limbs and,
and you know,

485
00:32:55.371 --> 00:33:00.210
like basically had zero ability to really participate.
Right.

486
00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:05.470
About the question again.
I was too,

487
00:33:05.471 --> 00:33:07.730
cause I was thinking about that kid and I was like,

488
00:33:07.731 --> 00:33:10.880
I wonder if he dreams if he's just like,
hello,
how are you?
Yeah.

489
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:12.050
You know what I mean?
Like,
Hey,

490
00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.560
he's in this shell where he can't get out and he's,
you know,

491
00:33:15.561 --> 00:33:16.850
people think he's retarded.

492
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:22.090
But then in his dream is he like a recurring character of like a really good

493
00:33:22.491 --> 00:33:24.210
looking businessman.
You know what I mean?

494
00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.240
That's actually really interesting though.

495
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:30.170
Is he like stacked as he like in the Holt is the worst thing would be waking up,

496
00:33:30.171 --> 00:33:33.620
man.
You'd like how you'd have these awesome dreams be like,
ah,

497
00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.940
you wake up and be like,
Huh,

498
00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:45.500
what a farmer.
Well I'd have to imagine to answer the question.

499
00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:46.760
I'm thinking about it.

500
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.080
I mean I can dream about retarded people even though I'm not retarded.

501
00:33:51.081 --> 00:33:55.570
So maybe the converse is true.
Have you ever drive different?

502
00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:59.560
Not that I'm aware of.
I mean not yet.
Maybe tonight.
Cause we're talking about it.

503
00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:01.810
You have very vivid dreams.
You remember your dreams alive.

504
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:04.810
I dreamed about pre judo this morning.
Close your eyes.
Ooh,
go ahead.
Retarded.

505
00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:07.880
Retired,
retired.
Just look at that picture up there

506
00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:14.150
of that guy.
Christina is more of a psycho high.

507
00:34:14.151 --> 00:34:17.060
Hitler's thanks.
I just listened to your most recent episode,

508
00:34:17.061 --> 00:34:20.840
had to ride in Christina's argument that she is less psycho and has a little

509
00:34:20.841 --> 00:34:22.860
thing called empathy is false.
Okay.

510
00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:25.670
Here is why we're Tom laughs at the pain of others.

511
00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:29.570
The pain is generally brought on through their own actions.
Christina,

512
00:34:29.571 --> 00:34:31.550
however laughs at mental illness all the time,

513
00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:33.410
which in many cases the person can't help.

514
00:34:33.411 --> 00:34:38.250
Clearly she is the main Hitler that's been culture.
Yeah,

515
00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:42.440
that's really good point.
Good point.
Do you want to defend it?

516
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:47.810
Painful.
You know,
experiences of others.
Like I feel like it's a defense.

517
00:34:47.811 --> 00:34:50.650
Can you please show just do we have the video?
They can pull it up.
Look,

518
00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:51.560
I'm going to show you a video.

519
00:34:51.561 --> 00:34:54.710
We're going to take a video and you just react to it.
However,

520
00:34:54.711 --> 00:34:57.650
I'm not going to set him up too much.
Just okay.
When I tell you what,

521
00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.690
how I naturally will know.
This is interesting that I,

522
00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:05.390
I'm laughing at stuff that's involuntary.
Let's say mental illnesses involuntary.

523
00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:09.680
Whereas this person is saying that those who harm themselves,
it's a voluntary.

524
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:14.980
Oh,
right.
Uh,
interesting.
So I understand.
Let's see the video.

525
00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:16.203
<v 2>All right.</v>

526
00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:23.160
<v 0>I mean,
it's just like,
first of all,</v>

527
00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:25.523
<v 2>okay.</v>

528
00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.470
<v 0>I don't know.
Everybody has a different reaction,
but I,
I've found that it's,</v>

529
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:30.930
let Tom Watch it please.
Okay.

530
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:35.360
<v 2>Yep.
And his tone,
by the way.</v>

531
00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:55.480
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

532
00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:06.400
<v 7>it's pretty funny.</v>

533
00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:13.360
<v 0>I don't know his level of interest.</v>

534
00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:20.020
That's the driver like,
well,
how'd that happen?
Why are you so loud?

535
00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:24.040
No drivers like you wrecked my car,
messed up the bumper,

536
00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:27.400
walks away to us and even as he obviously doesn't like him,

537
00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.950
doesn't give a fuck about that shit.

538
00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:35.770
I don't know if it's funny they got hit or he's funny.
The reaction is funny.

539
00:36:35.771 --> 00:36:38.080
There we go.
The reaction like the white,

540
00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:42.940
whatever the common word he uses for Holy Shit.
Yeah,
he's pretty funny.

541
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.540
And then Ben is,
look,
yeah,

542
00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.550
you don't think this is funny.
I,
because I,

543
00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.240
I sense that he's in a lot of pain.
I feel badly for him.
I don't really,

544
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:09.290
I don't like the fact that no one's helping him and stuff,
but that's just me.

545
00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:14.060
But if he,
if he reacted the way that you expect people in paint react like,

546
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:19.580
oh my God,
help me if I'd have the idea of empathy for him,

547
00:37:19.581 --> 00:37:24.581
but that he's just making this crazy face and screaming these funny duck noises.

548
00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:29.750
It's pretty much explanation overrides.
So this is the,
this is the whole thing.

549
00:37:29.751 --> 00:37:33.020
The reaction of Tom is talking about that.
It's a reaction.

550
00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:35.620
It's how he's reacting versus that.

551
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.330
<v 7>Right.</v>

552
00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.390
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

553
00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:52.780
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

554
00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:02.430
<v 0>part of
it is if it were at all in English it would be different.</v>

555
00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:06.090
Yes.
You fucking kill my shins.

556
00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:11.760
My niece is here.
Sounds like it's funny.

557
00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:15.650
Oh my wife
Mofo guy.

558
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:22.350
Real areas.
Wow.
Christina loses that.
Another one.

559
00:38:22.351 --> 00:38:26.370
That's a really interesting analysis though that,
that really,
now I understand

560
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:35.660
now I don't want to assume your,

561
00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:40.630
<v 3>you have children,
their pronouns.
Are you open to sharing them or no,</v>

562
00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:45.790
they day.
Okay.
They,
the end,
they use ams,

563
00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:50.940
<v 0>dams and those kids to those through them kids.</v>

564
00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:54.310
That's how they identify as them.

565
00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:58.840
<v 3>Do they do they what they identify as them.</v>

566
00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:03.520
They identify as those as those.
Okay.

567
00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:05.770
And were they born with,

568
00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:10.800
did you project your own Pronoun on them when they were born?

569
00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:16.520
What?
Did you label them as?
Um,
hermaphrodites you did?
Yes.
Wow.

570
00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:20.360
And they um,

571
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:24.140
disagreed and went to the,

572
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:26.500
to them those I believe he said,

573
00:39:26.501 --> 00:39:31.501
and then we decided that they should be girls.

574
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:37.420
Whoa.
Wow.
Bolt.
Now My,

575
00:39:37.421 --> 00:39:42.310
uh,
my wife is in school now.
She is going for her degree.

576
00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:47.320
Really?
Yeah.
And she is in a gender class.
Oh really?

577
00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:51.160
A whole semester of they in those and them's

578
00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:56.710
fascinating.
It's endless.
It's endless.

579
00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.300
And your wife and as a woman,

580
00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:02.680
my wife is a woman and we have two girls.

581
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:09.030
And the thing for my wife as a mother,
when she was in,

582
00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:12.920
in the class that you can't say that,
uh,

583
00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:17.200
there was one guy there said she,
she said he was obviously trying to get laid.

584
00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.470
Like he looked cool.
Yeah.
He was like talking about these guys,

585
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.120
all the light skin,

586
00:40:22.121 --> 00:40:26.320
black guy with the cool hair and the cool jewelry and just listen to the

587
00:40:26.321 --> 00:40:29.170
discussion and then raised his hand.
He's like,
I don't know.

588
00:40:29.171 --> 00:40:32.860
I'm just feeling really,
I'm just feeling really sad for those babies.

589
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:38.550
Those babies are split up into boys and girls and I don't know,

590
00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:43.810
it's hard not to cry when I think about those babies at my wife as a mother,

591
00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:47.120
you know,
in their forties in the end,
the back of the room like oh Jesus.

592
00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:54.900
<v 0>Yeah,
because every dude off topic,</v>

593
00:40:54.901 --> 00:40:58.380
but every dude picks a to get laid,
right?

594
00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:03.560
You guys are more overt with their choice and I play sports.

595
00:41:04.441 --> 00:41:08.220
I'm good at it.
Well fuck,
like that's their thing.
And some guys are like,

596
00:41:08.221 --> 00:41:11.000
I'm going to,
I'm going to show my emotions all the time,
right.

597
00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:14.660
I'm going to be real deliberate,
but I'll hide it and make it seem like,
yeah,

598
00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:18.570
I care.
It's all calculated.
My shoulder rubs and class

599
00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.760
shoulder rubs the right after a heated discussion.
Do you want to,

600
00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:28.110
you want to get coffee and talk about this?
I believe you said that.

601
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:33.920
That's the,
you look tense guy,
guy and that guy.

602
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:37.610
So,
you know,
now I have a kid to uh,
you,
you know,

603
00:41:37.611 --> 00:41:42.050
even if I were to label Elyssa girl,
I believe to Europe,
she,
it doesn't matter.

604
00:41:42.051 --> 00:41:45.350
I feel like that gender shit happens on its own.
You know what I'm saying?

605
00:41:45.351 --> 00:41:50.351
Like my boy likes dirt trucks and I've done nothing to really to influence that.

606
00:41:51.081 --> 00:41:55.340
Like I don't hang around them.
You know what I mean?
That stuff just happens.
Yeah.

607
00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:57.443
<v 3>Kids like we didn't,</v>

608
00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:02.280
we didn't know kids who obviously we didn't know if they've identified as a

609
00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:06.060
girl,
but you knew it was very feminine,
very feminine,

610
00:42:06.061 --> 00:42:10.470
attracted till girl type things.
But this is what's funny about my wife's class.

611
00:42:10.471 --> 00:42:14.340
If you just said that you're constantly on the lookout for how you're screwing

612
00:42:14.341 --> 00:42:17.060
up.
Right.
Oh boy.
So I just said,

613
00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:20.760
so in the very feminine doing girl things.
Well what do you mean the girl things?

614
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:23.930
Dollies babies.
Why is that?
It is

615
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:27.230
<v 0>cause it is because my son doesn't give a shit for those things.</v>

616
00:42:27.231 --> 00:42:30.590
That's what the whole class and she says she sits in class and all the people

617
00:42:30.591 --> 00:42:33.350
like within earshot around her are all like,
no,

618
00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.240
there's girl things and there's boy thank right.
Right,
right.

619
00:42:35.241 --> 00:42:38.420
Don't you tell the teacher no union,
no one.
Everyone feels it.
Everyone knows it,

620
00:42:38.421 --> 00:42:41.300
but no one wants to say it out loud cause it would get in trouble.
Yeah.

621
00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:42.450
It's hilarious.

622
00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:47.540
Toddlers a class last week and they brought out baby dolls and all the girls got

623
00:42:47.541 --> 00:42:49.670
excited.
Pull them out.
My son took one look.

624
00:42:49.671 --> 00:42:53.600
It was like fuck that and ran across it doesn't even want,
he's not interested.

625
00:42:53.601 --> 00:42:54.700
Yeah.
Yeah.

626
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:57.950
Then is it isn't the teacher being like he should play with this dog and the

627
00:42:57.951 --> 00:43:01.910
teacher told me that we,
he should excuse me,
play with that.
He,

628
00:43:01.911 --> 00:43:04.100
we should kind of force their shit on.
I go,
listen,

629
00:43:04.101 --> 00:43:06.200
I'm not trying to raise him to be a macho man.

630
00:43:06.201 --> 00:43:08.780
I teach them to be gentle with animals and with whatever,

631
00:43:08.781 --> 00:43:10.310
but if he doesn't want to play with a doll,

632
00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:12.060
he's not going to play with a doll today.
Sorry.
Yeah,

633
00:43:12.061 --> 00:43:16.070
I'm going to force him to do,
he's going to,
I have my kids may take it up.

634
00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:19.970
God Damn Bro.
Yeah,
don't worry about it.
I clean guns in front of them.
Yeah.

635
00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:22.610
This is what you're going to do.
Yeah.
It's still snakes,
rats.

636
00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:25.250
Whenever it gives you a private school,
you,
you know,
you punch him in the face,

637
00:43:25.251 --> 00:43:29.360
right.
We teach him that stuff at home,
just like healthy male behavior.
So wait,

638
00:43:29.361 --> 00:43:34.010
tell me more about the getting,
getting lay guy.
So it's the,
and how old is he?

639
00:43:34.011 --> 00:43:37.310
Waits till the next class.
I wouldn't be like,
you know,
I got a shoulder up today.

640
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:43.340
You know,
I was,
I was glad it was.
It was really upsetting.

641
00:43:43.341 --> 00:43:47.680
I brought up that thing about the babies and I got really mad.
But then,
uh,

642
00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:52.520
Carlos took me over to the side.
We went for coffee.

643
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:53.900
He's a lot deeper than I thought.

644
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:58.220
It's not just the jewelry may save sea turtles.

645
00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:06.230
And that's funny because a lot of girls seen and shared thousands of times on

646
00:44:06.231 --> 00:44:08.840
social media.
Take it on a South Glens falls,

647
00:44:08.841 --> 00:44:11.000
high school bus involving freshmen air.

648
00:44:11.001 --> 00:44:15.680
And Sweeter and friend Leo Washington who say the driver told students that

649
00:44:15.681 --> 00:44:19.220
girls and boys need to said a different sides of the bus.

650
00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:22.190
Do the couples in the past behaving inappropriately,

651
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:26.240
the pair identify as Trans nonbinary meeting.

652
00:44:26.241 --> 00:44:30.910
They don't see themselves as male or female,
but proceeded to sit on the boys.

653
00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:35.730
Then they say the driver got angry.
I try to explain to him the situation,

654
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:40.760
like our gender identity in situation and he was saying that he didn't care.

655
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:48.170
This is his bus and he's not starting the bus until he gets what he wants.

656
00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:53.420
He said that after I told him that I was comfortable and I'm going to sit where

657
00:44:53.911 --> 00:44:54.744
I'm comfortable,

658
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:59.610
the pair were then kicked off and waited for another bus to bring them home.

659
00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:03.570
Thursday morning sweetener says the school's principal and other faculty stood

660
00:45:03.571 --> 00:45:08.040
behind the to just be like,
Hey,
hi.
How are you?
What's your name?

661
00:45:08.041 --> 00:45:11.870
What's Your Pronoun?
So they got kicked off that bus drivers an idiot.

662
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:17.400
I'm an asshole.
But just for being like,
no,
we want to sit here.
And he was like,

663
00:45:17.401 --> 00:45:22.290
you're a boy or girl,
come on.
I gotta get my taxes are due,

664
00:45:22.291 --> 00:45:26.040
I got to get to the post office guy does not like philosophic

665
00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:32.100
driving it to do can't guy.

666
00:45:32.101 --> 00:45:36.420
Can you imagine?
That's like when we talk about like,
like when I told my,
when,

667
00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:41.480
when non-binary came into the lexicon and he was in was I called my parents and

668
00:45:42.241 --> 00:45:45.480
I recorded it and I was like,
do you know about non binaries?
And my mom was like,

669
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:47.760
you know,

670
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:52.760
people that are neither boy nor female and like you could hear literally wheels

671
00:45:53.941 --> 00:45:58.870
in their heads
like breaking apart and they were like,

672
00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.380
I,
my dad's like,
I don't

673
00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:05.280
a good bus drivers.
Totally.
That guy.

674
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:09.450
When my mother yesterday she asked what my wife,
how's school going?

675
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:12.250
I told her about the gender class and uh,

676
00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:16.170
she brought up the thing about the babies and my mother just blurts out no,

677
00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:21.150
as a parent it's your job to tell them what they are.
That's it.

678
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:26.100
It's like what does teaching them not exactly what they're saying not to do.

679
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:30.420
Now you tell them you're a boy,
dude,
get over it.
You're a boy.
Like boy things,

680
00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:35.880
Shit.
I mean,
you know,
our generation,
we're learning every day.
It's,
I mean,

681
00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:37.620
I mean we weren't talking about this last year.

682
00:46:37.621 --> 00:46:41.550
Like it's coming swiftly and you're trying to digest it and trying to do the

683
00:46:41.551 --> 00:46:44.220
right thing and trying to that generation.
It's like,

684
00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:49.190
I don't know why my blood pressure's so high.
Yeah,
I can't,
I,

685
00:46:49.191 --> 00:46:54.120
I can't sleep without paying five times.
What's your a Trans Hooey?

686
00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:55.560
Yeah.
I don't care.

687
00:46:55.561 --> 00:46:58.500
I also think about this sometimes even though I don't hear it really discussed

688
00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:02.310
is how this issue,
and I don't want to like,
you know,

689
00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:05.370
diminish the people that are going through their identity crisis,

690
00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:10.580
but it feels like it is a not an issue that would ever be covered in a place

691
00:47:11.491 --> 00:47:13.540
where they're lacking for food.
You know,

692
00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:17.850
or at war if you're in the Congo and they were like,
hold on a second though,

693
00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:20.760
why you keep telling me the lineup with the dudes I know.
Like wait,
what?

694
00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:24.480
Like I'm not buying it.
And they're like,
why are you bringing this up?

695
00:47:24.481 --> 00:47:27.510
There's a lion right there.
It's like,

696
00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:31.630
it's only where things are comfortable that things like this become,

697
00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:36.880
cause everyone's at me.
Yeah.
We're not in survival mode.
We're in luxury mode.

698
00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:39.250
Right.
Theoretically,

699
00:47:39.251 --> 00:47:41.860
the ability to make art as if you could be there and be like,

700
00:47:41.861 --> 00:47:43.310
I want to talk about my gender.
And they'd be like,

701
00:47:43.311 --> 00:47:46.900
you're going through a drought.
If you don't mind holding it until the spring.

702
00:47:46.901 --> 00:47:50.350
Maybe we could talk about it then.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that's to get all political.

703
00:47:50.351 --> 00:47:52.140
But it was like,
you know,

704
00:47:52.141 --> 00:47:56.740
the California and New York are kind of going through this and kind of

705
00:47:56.741 --> 00:47:58.750
intellectually getting their head around it.

706
00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:03.670
And then they tell people in areas where none of the fathers have jobs and

707
00:48:03.671 --> 00:48:05.530
they're all freaked out on opioids.
And then they're like,

708
00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:08.740
you've got to change your bathrooms.
And they're like,
dude,

709
00:48:08.741 --> 00:48:12.430
we're dealing with some other shit.
Yeah.
There's no jobs in this town.

710
00:48:12.431 --> 00:48:15.580
We grew up in.
And we're like,
yeah,
but you know,

711
00:48:15.581 --> 00:48:20.140
everybody's got a p word and the power not now.

712
00:48:20.141 --> 00:48:23.890
Right now.
I think that was,
I think that's what their reaction was.
It was like,

713
00:48:23.891 --> 00:48:26.200
you know what,
you're not in charge right now.
We have other stuff.

714
00:48:26.201 --> 00:48:30.220
We got to take care of her.
Sure.
To understandable though,
when you know,
yeah.

715
00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:31.780
Your priorities,
not that.

716
00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:35.610
<v 8>Oh,
of course.
Um,
sometimes,
you know,
I dunno.</v>

717
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:37.080
Sometimes you just need to make a change.

718
00:48:37.081 --> 00:48:40.830
And I think this is a really good example of a change as somebody who needs to

719
00:48:40.831 --> 00:48:43.050
make,
you know,
now at this age,

720
00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:46.710
Martina desperately wanted it to look like Pamela Anderson.

721
00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:49.890
So after 10 years in several cosmetic surgeries,

722
00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:54.060
Martina transformed her looks into this.
Wow.

723
00:48:54.061 --> 00:48:56.610
Those are pretty subtle touch.
She got done,

724
00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.610
but she wasn't done six months ago.

725
00:48:59.611 --> 00:49:04.560
Martina Med room wide headlines where they're most shocking transformation yet

726
00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.890
through chemical injections and body modification.

727
00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:11.910
Martina now considers herself a black woman,

728
00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:19.570
<v 0>are just the car and all the black people.</v>

729
00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:28.250
That should be our new screensaver.
It's so great.
That is dumbfounded,

730
00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.730
nauseous,
angry,
hilarious.

731
00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:33.643
Oh my God.

732
00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:38.770
That is no amazing about this is that Maury Povich has to treat this like it's a

733
00:49:38.781 --> 00:49:42.190
real treat.
That's the real trick of it.
He does.

734
00:49:42.191 --> 00:49:46.000
This is like the most baseline bullshit,

735
00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:50.970
like unethical on dignified and he's basically like this is 60 minutes.
Yes.

736
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:54.740
Reese's pieces.
And that's why he gets away with it.

737
00:49:54.741 --> 00:49:58.580
Cause they're like Morrie's respectable guy.
He's a fucking doing garbage to me.

738
00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:04.760
I know I eat the amount of CCS hand sanitizer in his dressing room after he

739
00:50:05.511 --> 00:50:09.430
talks to you.
He's not,
you know,

740
00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:13.960
like some artists,
you know,
hate their audience or their fans.
Yeah.

741
00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:18.550
Imagine the level of like that he hates everything.
Yes.

742
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:21.380
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
Oh my God.
Cause he's definitely,

743
00:50:21.381 --> 00:50:26.120
I'm sure a bit of an elitist Garvey and like to,
he is what he,

744
00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:29.390
I don't know,
I did a radio show once and he was on,

745
00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:34.780
we were both on his guests and he was talking about it and like he wasn't really

746
00:50:35.271 --> 00:50:38.410
shitting on it.
Like really?
Yeah.
He was like,
he isn't elitist.

747
00:50:38.411 --> 00:50:41.330
Like he's got these beautiful glasses and he's dressed,
you know,

748
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:44.440
like expensive clothes.
But he,

749
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:48.500
he doesn't either he's keeping some of the game really well or he really just

750
00:50:48.501 --> 00:50:51.350
believes like,
no,
this is just what I do.
It's just a crazy show.

751
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:56.360
He knows that he is blessed enough to find a lane like this.
This is,

752
00:50:56.450 --> 00:51:00.290
this is his lane and he's locked it in and he's made a great living.
Oh my God.

753
00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:04.070
Yeah.
You see a couple of those tribes probably like no more.

754
00:51:04.071 --> 00:51:08.990
Definitely going to keep doing.
Yeah.
Who is your father?
Yeah.
No.

755
00:51:08.991 --> 00:51:13.370
Who's your father and he has a house in the Hamptons.
Yes.
Yeah,

756
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:18.450
for sure.
Definitely.
I can look at stuff that's shot.
He's so great.

757
00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:23.640
Is the best.
He's confused and angry and upset.
Yeah.

758
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:25.640
<v 9>I want them to look like a Barbie.</v>

759
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:30.270
I want to create and what beautiful body like a Bobby was long,

760
00:51:30.271 --> 00:51:33.370
blonde hair and long necks.
Oh my God.
We got breasts.

761
00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:39.100
<v 0>Look at those dates.
I'm not,
I'm not black,</v>

762
00:51:39.101 --> 00:51:43.060
so the black part of her,
I couldn't if I wanted that part.

763
00:51:43.061 --> 00:51:46.840
I understand it's a cultural identity and it's really fucked up to just be like,

764
00:51:46.841 --> 00:51:51.250
I'm black now,
but the tickets are like,
that's good.
Yeah.

765
00:51:51.251 --> 00:51:55.060
Like it's not even good.
It has to hurt.
No one can wait.

766
00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:57.340
You're saying you're saying it's not good.

767
00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:03.560
It was like fucking sweet from where I'm sitting.
I mean maybe it's a girl,

768
00:52:03.561 --> 00:52:08.080
good girl guy thing,
but
it was,
it was a pretty good,

769
00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:10.850
perfect.
Let me get those for your wife.

770
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:15.890
<v 9>Stretchy.
Special butter.
Also,</v>

771
00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:20.560
I got a nose job and I also had the liposuction to get along.

772
00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:21.593
Bobby

773
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:26.870
<v 0>faces a completely different,
yeah,
she was Kinda cute here.
Yeah,
just her face.</v>

774
00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:30.350
This isn't,
see,
this isn't terrible.
I mean this is ridiculous,

775
00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:34.460
but it is a terrible,
yeah,
it's okay.
I mean those girls in her lane.

776
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:38.520
<v 9>Oh boy.
So change my skin color and now and the route,</v>

777
00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:40.700
awesome skin.

778
00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:47.630
She has changed her race and now identifies as a black woman.

779
00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:51.770
<v 0>Interview is going to go.</v>

780
00:52:55.520 --> 00:53:00.200
Wow.
That's pretty great.
That is so she knows the struggle now.
Yeah,

781
00:53:00.201 --> 00:53:03.290
of course.
I mean all you have to do is change your skin color.
Right.

782
00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:06.570
I called Shirley and I are boy,
we run in the industry now,

783
00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:14.880
<v 9>but I also liked to do photos.
What on the photos?</v>

784
00:53:14.881 --> 00:53:18.340
I should see if you have to cuffs off Pamela Anderson.
Yeah.

785
00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:21.350
Photos would be much more better.

786
00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:25.440
<v 0>Does she look at that picture of Pamela Anderson and think I did it</v>

787
00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:31.680
like I got her looking at her necklace.
It says Black Girls Rock,

788
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:35.130
black girls rock did Maury.
I,
it's something tells me more.

789
00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:38.220
He's production team gave that to her jewelry.
Jewelry,

790
00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:42.800
shit on you was going to look great on you.
Crazy.

791
00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:46.430
You cannot say we gave it to you.
Keep it.

792
00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:49.200
That was like,
oh,
okay.

793
00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:54.420
<v 9>I got this in one zap,</v>

794
00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:57.610
stretching and w where?

795
00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:01.450
When did you get injections to look darker?
This January.

796
00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:05.950
In middle of January I got three injections in the belly and it's after the

797
00:54:05.951 --> 00:54:10.120
first week.
You can see going down Daca and Daca,
but today is a pod.

798
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:12.220
<v 0>This is going to put tanning salons out of business.</v>

799
00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:16.600
Three shots in the tummy and you're good.
You're good man.
Yeah,
I,
I I,
it's true.

800
00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:19.830
Why would you even burn your skin?
You're a black person.
Yup.

801
00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:28.160
<v 9>I know you have to learn a lot.
Yeah.</v>

802
00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:32.430
<v 0>Oh,
well she's open iron man.</v>

803
00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:36.360
<v 9>No,
I feel a lot of this stuff.
I can feel it</v>

804
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:41.590
just because your skin is dark at

805
00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:45.670
beginning.
I only wanted to have more 10 yeah.

806
00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:50.610
When I got my this injections.
Yes.
And two for three months.
Yeah.

807
00:54:50.611 --> 00:54:54.910
I like the contrast of lung.
Okay.

808
00:54:54.911 --> 00:54:59.400
Now I,
yeah,
I call us also changing.

809
00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:03.200
<v 0>She's,

810
00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:08.330
yeah,
yeah.
She's really,
she's this range.
This is like a bus stop conversation.

811
00:55:09.830 --> 00:55:14.150
When are you going back to your planet?
So that's good.
That's good.
Good.

812
00:55:14.151 --> 00:55:17.690
And You keep looking right at to see where are you going to make a move and they

813
00:55:17.691 --> 00:55:22.100
attack you,
so.
Right.
And that's,

814
00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:27.050
that's more his gift is he legitimize is absolute insanity.

815
00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:30.410
Is this one.
Yeah,
because he's also a dancing,
he's dancing the line,

816
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:33.130
like of asking a sincere question one yet.

817
00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:36.650
Then he's also got a play to the crowd.
Right.
Knows it's bull shit.

818
00:55:36.651 --> 00:55:40.760
He's like rarely,
but not too much.
She feels like,
oh,
you're totally mocking me.

819
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:44.630
Right.
Yeah.
That is probably his 10th show he's done today.

820
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:49.910
The delicate dance he does.
He really,
there's no,
that's why it's called Mori.

821
00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:51.010
Yeah,
it's good.

822
00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:56.160
<v 9>Yeah.
I broke chaos as changing the wheat crowing Hess as it's a changing as all</v>

823
00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:58.870
right.
I can see my withdrawing house.

824
00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:02.350
So a fake sentence version.
Yes.

825
00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:06.630
<v 8>Your husband Michael is here,
isn't it?
Michael?
Nice to see you.</v>

826
00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:11.560
Oh Man,
I might as well ask you,
do you feel black?
I am Indian.

827
00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:13.250
I have got a doc,

828
00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:16.740
<v 0>Liam.
I'm a media guy.
He talks to dead people.</v>

829
00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:20.750
<v 8>You also said I am black.
That is my race.</v>

830
00:56:20.751 --> 00:56:23.410
I can't wait to go to Africa because I hear the food is,

831
00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:29.560
it's not,
it's not.

832
00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:32.410
<v 0>That's what I heard you saying it tonight.</v>

833
00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:35.123
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

834
00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:39.130
<v 0>You think anyone who is so good,
naturally black.</v>

835
00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:43.910
<v 9>No.
I know some,
uh,</v>

836
00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:49.650
uh,
tech,
but,
and it's not to my attention to somebody and it's not a test.

837
00:56:49.830 --> 00:56:52.210
It's not a media attention stuff.
Right.

838
00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:57.360
I feel like homeless have mental illness and talk to people who want to talk

839
00:56:57.361 --> 00:56:59.640
with me about it.
You know what I'm saying?

840
00:57:01.070 --> 00:57:01.903
<v 0>So</v>

841
00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:09.090
he just like walks like he's this like you won't be on TV.

842
00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:12.970
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

843
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.660
There was a guy who was going to Penn station the other day and he was a white

844
00:57:16.661 --> 00:57:20.680
guy,
like probably 28,
maybe no shirt on,

845
00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:24.310
just like sneakers and like a baggy shirt,
baggy,

846
00:57:24.311 --> 00:57:28.720
like running pants as an eating a sandwich and he's rolling on the ground.

847
00:57:28.721 --> 00:57:31.600
He's getting up like aggressive,
like he's in a mosh pit by himself.

848
00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:33.420
Like a ha ha ha.

849
00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:36.760
You want to come down and talk about this?

850
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:42.880
Would you like to be on TV?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I love TV.

851
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.060
<v 3>So we have,
um,
you know,
a lot of times we,</v>

852
00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:52.130
we feature dad boners on our show and a dad,

853
00:57:52.131 --> 00:57:54.170
Boehner is somebody is a,
it's a dad,

854
00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:58.970
somebody in our age range who gets very excited.
Um,
and we've,

855
00:57:59.090 --> 00:58:02.420
we've had to then break it down into two lanes.

856
00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:05.540
There's the UN,
like,

857
00:58:05.541 --> 00:58:09.830
the real thrill is when somebody gets super excited about something they

858
00:58:09.831 --> 00:58:12.900
shouldn't get excited about.
Like for instance,
um,

859
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:17.050
this guy excited about,
uh,
the,

860
00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:20.060
the highway in Canada.
It's like,
why are you,

861
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:23.000
why are you this excited about a highway,
you know?

862
00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:28.170
<v 5>Oh.
Oh,
okay.
Oh</v>

863
00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:31.093
Wow.

864
00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:39.640
The Trans Canada highway,
baby.

865
00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:47.600
Beautiful Sunday burdens,
Columbia.

866
00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:50.773
<v 0>It's pretty great.</v>

867
00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:57.283
<v 5>Oh,
I'm winded</v>

868
00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:02.490
story that this road towels,

869
00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:06.250
<v 0>he basically almost comes</v>

870
00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:11.980
<v 5>one more time down there.
Middle.
Oh,</v>

871
00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:17.480
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,

872
00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:23.020
oh,
oh,
oh,
this is a downhill sucks fortunately.

873
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:25.543
Whoa.

874
00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:30.403
That's like

875
00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:34.200
<v 3>really like peaked,
add boner.
Right.
Um,</v>

876
00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:38.980
then there's other ones where we feel like it's actually justify because it's

877
00:59:38.981 --> 00:59:41.080
something truly awesome.
Okay.
In other words,

878
00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:45.820
somebody will get excited about and it clips,
right?

879
00:59:45.821 --> 00:59:48.960
But then you're like,
well that's actually something to get excited about.

880
00:59:48.970 --> 00:59:51.040
But you guess,
right?
Yeah.

881
00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:56.230
So somebody here's a dad moment this week,
but we feel like as a justified one.

882
00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:58.860
Oh,
you can see why he showing.

883
01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:01.523
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

884
01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:10.420
It's always,
these guys are on a boat.
Jina Taylor,

885
01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:12.290
give me the file log.

886
01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:18.350
Oh wait.
Oh,
that one's over.

887
01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:32.240
Losing their mind.
Oh,
y'all.

888
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:36.530
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

889
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:39.800
<v 5>Get it.
I get that.
I mean how boring is fishing nor mine.</v>

890
01:00:39.830 --> 01:00:43.100
No sharks in the water.
I mean,
you've got more bay.

891
01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:49.900
I am.
I am.

892
01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:55.180
<v 0>Okay.</v>

893
01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:57.100
<v 5>I loved it.
It's great.</v>

894
01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:00.490
I mean that's why they're so stoked because it's been a born fucking bunch of

895
01:01:00.491 --> 01:01:03.300
bullshit.
That's like the one thing that happened.

896
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:09.770
<v 0>Yeah.
You want another beer?
We,
you always should we try over there by that rock?</v>

897
01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:13.700
Maybe we caught a fish or were there ones?
Yeah,
I know.

898
01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:14.803
<v 5>Oh my gosh.</v>

899
01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:20.650
<v 3>So crazy.
It's so crazy.
Yeah.
Usually you're just like,
it's hot.</v>

900
01:01:20.770 --> 01:01:23.380
Still hot out.
Sun's burning me.

901
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:27.970
<v 0>Hey,
how's work?
How's work going?
Sounds good.
Yeah,
she's still,
uh,</v>

902
01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:32.890
you still an hour commute both ways.
That's not so bad.

903
01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:36.580
Not so bad.
Yeah.
You know,
you listen to podcasts and stuff.

904
01:01:36.581 --> 01:01:41.260
It's really good.
It's good.
But to kill the time.
Yeah.
It is a books on tape.

905
01:01:41.970 --> 01:01:46.710
Yeah.
How's Christine?
Great.

906
01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.553
Don't even correct.

907
01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:51.410
<v 5>Correct.
Would be great.
She's great.</v>

908
01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:56.130
<v 3>Um,
somebody sent in this boring in the same words.</v>

909
01:01:56.270 --> 01:02:00.530
I worked on this a show one time for comedy central about this called,

910
01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:03.590
what's it called?
Like 30 minutes over Washington or something.

911
01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:07.000
It was basically where we were mocking,
uh,

912
01:02:07.070 --> 01:02:11.300
politicians ad campaigns.
And the way that there is one,

913
01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:14.180
this is in Virginia where they tried to,

914
01:02:14.570 --> 01:02:16.970
I guess use top gun,

915
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:20.070
but like this dude put out this

916
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:20.903
<v 0>ad,</v>

917
01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.850
<v 2>this is a real ad
for a congress man,</v>

918
01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:29.453
that guy is running for.

919
01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.440
<v 0>So like,
I'm like top gun,</v>

920
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.050
<v 2>it's got my vote.
No congresswoman Comstock.
And that's the,</v>

921
01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:41.480
isn't that top swimming Comstock back there at the bar?
Sure.

922
01:02:41.481 --> 01:02:43.850
Is that you can't get her to hold a town hall.

923
01:02:44.590 --> 01:02:48.420
<v 0>You know,
it's funny,
he has a little Tom Cruise to his face.
Yeah.</v>

924
01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:52.860
It's got a little bit like someone in high school said he looked like Tom
Cruise.

925
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:57.080
Yeah.
And this is the moment where he puts it all to it at all.
I mean,

926
01:02:57.130 --> 01:03:01.140
I know that his,
like his,
his campaign manager was like,
you're a vet,

927
01:03:01.170 --> 01:03:05.010
you're going to wear a shirt that says a vet in these ad.
Right.
And he's like,

928
01:03:05.011 --> 01:03:06.120
are you sure?
And he was like,
oh,

929
01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:11.130
100% like you're going to O'hare veteran so that when people are voting,

930
01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:16.860
they remember that part too.
Besides your awesome Tom Cruise commercial.

931
01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:20.420
<v 2>Can't get a town hall.
Do you one better than that?</v>

932
01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:26.090
We've lost that loving feeling.
No,
Dan.
Yeah.

933
01:03:26.610 --> 01:03:30.880
<v 0>Oh,
you ready?
Cringe or no,
it's so embarrassing.</v>

934
01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:32.810
Oh wait.
Can I put something over my head?

935
01:03:32.811 --> 01:03:35.230
Do you have something like a news my face with

936
01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:38.680
that extra his penis skin?
No.

937
01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:44.180
<v 10>Got her a whole town halls more with cans to chew.</v>

938
01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:46.380
<v 0>Oh boy.</v>

939
01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:50.280
<v 5>You're trying hard not to show.</v>

940
01:03:56.910 --> 01:04:01.500
<v 0>The only mistake he's made is that he picked the wrong Tom cruise movie.</v>

941
01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:06.070
Yeah,
this is out of the straight out of cocktail.
All right.
This is a cocktail.

942
01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:06.671
This cocktail.

943
01:04:06.671 --> 01:04:09.990
What he's looking at the bottles and stuff and the whole bar stops and listens

944
01:04:09.991 --> 01:04:12.390
to this is in top gun.

945
01:04:12.450 --> 01:04:16.560
Well he's combining elements of top gun with this.
Oh,

946
01:04:16.561 --> 01:04:20.610
you think that right?
No,
I think he's all top guns,
but he's made a mistake.

947
01:04:20.611 --> 01:04:25.160
He should know.
He should have done,
I see interest a little Kokomo.

948
01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:29.040
Yeah,
he should have been flipping bottles.

949
01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:33.350
The craziest thing about cocktail is it like the whole bar stops and like write

950
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:38.670
w like hundreds of people to stop and like turn as Tom Cruise said something

951
01:04:39.001 --> 01:04:40.110
about Tequila.
What's his,

952
01:04:40.350 --> 01:04:43.680
his ad could have been like our district going to shit is boring around here.

953
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.370
Just like four drinks and be like,
let's have some fucking fun again.

954
01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.310
But I I think,

955
01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:54.020
<v 2>oh boy,
boy,</v>

956
01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:02.950
<v 0>oh I bought this works for him now you think so there was a lot of dopes out</v>

957
01:05:02.951 --> 01:05:06.370
there that are like this is great
fun.

958
01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:11.430
Then the opposition walks out like she leaves.

959
01:05:11.471 --> 01:05:16.330
Right.
Nice Work Dan.
Nice work.
Thanks Maverick.

960
01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:19.500
Um,
damn.
Thanks Maverick.

961
01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:26.350
Dushawn Dan,
however I approve of town halls,
bad singing and this message,

962
01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:30.730
he's funny.
Good closing line.
Is Self aware?

963
01:05:30.731 --> 01:05:34.960
I mean at the end he's aware that it's kind of Corny but a veteran teacher with

964
01:05:34.961 --> 01:05:38.380
the army
case.
You're wondering what branch

965
01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:41.800
he's running for.

966
01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:47.320
He is a Democrat running for 10th district in Virginia.

967
01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.490
Dan Hilmar wish you the best.
Dan.

968
01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:54.280
I please keep making these really good.

969
01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:00.820
Ooh,
that's so uncomfortable,
isn't it?

970
01:06:00.821 --> 01:06:05.500
Like I'm sweating more uncomfortable than the nail lady.
The nail lady is like,

971
01:06:05.501 --> 01:06:09.700
Whoa,
this is like the seat.
Like what just made you sad?

972
01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:14.980
It's like,
it's like if someone tries to sing on those shows,

973
01:06:14.981 --> 01:06:19.420
like on those audition shows where you're like,
damn it,
stop singing.

974
01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:23.890
Like you can't do it.
No one told you I do.
We feel like,
why did it make us sad?

975
01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:26.080
Because I think you can register,

976
01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:29.040
especially if you're a performer when you're like,
this bad is,

977
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:31.930
this is a bad show you're doing.
You're not doing well right now.
Right.

978
01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:36.070
Makes you uncomfortable to see somebody like,
or even worse.

979
01:06:36.071 --> 01:06:39.640
It's when you're watching that person and they're killing.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

980
01:06:39.641 --> 01:06:42.880
And you know it's bad and other people are approving of it.
They have.
Yeah,

981
01:06:42.881 --> 01:06:47.390
that's true.
You're just like,
oh,
what do I,
am I that far from what that is?
Yeah.

982
01:06:47.590 --> 01:06:52.270
You know what I mean?
That like,
oh,
maybe we're all just hacky.
Yeah,

983
01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:55.030
it's true.
There's something that registers differently.

984
01:06:55.031 --> 01:06:59.860
I think if you perform when you watch a performance,
yeah.
You read,

985
01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:03.910
you read it differently completely.
Maybe that's what it is.
I'm going to go now.

986
01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:06.023
Are you depressed?

987
01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:10.330
I started think it was so out of his comfort zone,

988
01:07:10.350 --> 01:07:13.070
like it was painful to watch him.
That's a good point.

989
01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:16.300
Thanks Maverick.
We did it.

990
01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:19.960
And he's just staring at whoever he's talking to because he's terrified.

991
01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:24.700
No,
it's cause you know it's bad,
right?

992
01:07:24.730 --> 01:07:29.710
Like he's not comfortable cause he's really an experience and I feel nervous for

993
01:07:29.711 --> 01:07:33.130
him.
So I was like,
I'm so uncomfortable.

994
01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:38.080
I want to do an ad like this for your NEP.

995
01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:41.620
She has a Netflix special coming out on the 10th so it's about to come out.

996
01:07:41.650 --> 01:07:43.690
What if you did like a,
hey,

997
01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.660
why don't you watch my Netflix special and we like parody.

998
01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:51.290
Do you like something from legally blonde or something?
I love lol.

999
01:07:52.210 --> 01:07:56.140
Yeah,
for sure.
There's some good lines in there.
I object.

1000
01:07:57.930 --> 01:08:00.650
She's great.
It's a great way.
If you want to do it,
I love to do that.

1001
01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:07.750
And you can turn the camera be like,
I'm Christina P I approve of this message.

1002
01:08:07.810 --> 01:08:10.670
I like.
Totally.
And then,
yeah,
right.

1003
01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:15.680
Is there a better one?
Probably.

1004
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:19.010
<v 3>Probably.
Is there a better worst idea that you have for this?
Tom</v>

1005
01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:25.160
knows they're better movies with them legally blind like you would like to do.

1006
01:08:25.161 --> 01:08:27.890
Like is there another favorite Rocco,
that new documentary.

1007
01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:34.130
Have you watched rockers?
It's on Netflix.
If you went to the original rocky.

1008
01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:38.480
No,
no,
the Italian porn star Rocco.

1009
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:43.010
He does.
We're about to wrap up.
Oh,
speaking of being bombed.
Yeah,
you'll,

1010
01:08:43.011 --> 01:08:46.390
you'll feel sad and stairs.
A lot of sadness.
But it's uh,
it's pretty good.
Right?

1011
01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:50.180
Amazing Donkey.
It's not one to watch when the girls are around.

1012
01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:53.810
There's nothing to watch from the girls room.
Literally nothing to watch.

1013
01:08:53.811 --> 01:08:57.540
But I just finished season three and narcos thing.
Big thumbs up to that,

1014
01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:02.090
finish that.
Excellent.
We started Ozark.
Yeah,

1015
01:09:02.091 --> 01:09:06.410
I did two really good.
Deep into that.
It is good.

1016
01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:09.110
But that documentary,
it's,
it's,

1017
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:14.530
it's a wide range of them and this is a guy who's done really hardcore,

1018
01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:16.970
crazy porn for 30 years.

1019
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.720
That's the part that I think the most that we stood like that stood out was
like,

1020
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:24.080
you know,
if the guy was like 24,
you'd be like,
yeah,

1021
01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:26.110
I mean some people are going to go that way.
Right.

1022
01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:29.820
But like the fact that he's 50 something and he's like,

1023
01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:34.520
why if I have a couple of kids and then he's just like stepping on next and like

1024
01:09:34.521 --> 01:09:37.580
just hang and jasper hours,
you're like,

1025
01:09:38.570 --> 01:09:42.950
oh my God,
girls fast.
He's very revealing in it.

1026
01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:47.690
Like he can a deep dark thoughts.

1027
01:09:47.691 --> 01:09:50.300
Really interesting.
All right.
Yeah.
Maybe I'll watch it with the kids.

1028
01:09:52.350 --> 01:09:55.470
Uh,
Tom Papa,
where can people see you?
Um,

1029
01:09:55.690 --> 01:09:59.990
my podcast is called come to papa and um,

1030
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:04.910
we've been doing a lot of live shows with it.
It's adorable.

1031
01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:09.950
Um,
just go to the Tom papa.com you can find and there's hot cast,
my tour dates,

1032
01:10:09.951 --> 01:10:13.700
all that stuff.
I'm going to Eugene,
Oregon next week.
Awesome.
Portland.

1033
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:18.860
I did both this year.
Oh yeah.
Where are you doing Eugene?
Our Ri Alto and no,
no,

1034
01:10:18.861 --> 01:10:23.790
that's,
that's Denver or Loveland,
Colorado.
I don't know where I am together.

1035
01:10:24.490 --> 01:10:27.770
Eugene.
Some theater in Eugene,
the halts or the Holt's.
Okay.

1036
01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:30.050
And then one in Portland.

1037
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:33.200
Two great towns or love going up there.

1038
01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:36.080
And Tom Papa was an amazing comedian.

1039
01:10:36.081 --> 01:10:39.680
If you've never seen him go see him live,
he's really one of the best.

1040
01:10:39.681 --> 01:10:44.140
It's really true.
It's true.
He's really good.
He's really good.
As a great to um,

1041
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:46.720
normal person.
Christina P has a noose,

1042
01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:51.760
a special mother and warrior at premiering October 10th on Netflix.

1043
01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:56.390
You can cue it up wheat right next to your Rocco documentary,

1044
01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:57.500
watch them back to back.

1045
01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:02.450
And then I think I saw legally blonde parody about that special.
Yeah,

1046
01:11:02.451 --> 01:11:07.030
it's pretty good.
It's pretty good.
Um,
I have,
oh,
I put the,
uh,

1047
01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:11.990
the sign vinyls of completely normal or in the store if you wanted those.

1048
01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:14.280
And I also,
um,

1049
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:18.180
the leftover posters from the Denver taping,

1050
01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:21.810
those are in the store as well.
Just did that right.
I did that last weekend.

1051
01:11:21.850 --> 01:11:25.980
I had it go.
It was awesome,
man.
Yeah,
it was a lot of fun.
Awesome.
Super Cool.

1052
01:11:25.981 --> 01:11:28.650
It's going to be a great special sidewall.
I'm excited for.

1053
01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:31.650
It never comes out as good as you think.
I know.
I know.

1054
01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:34.170
And it's never as bad as you think.
It's,
it's exactly that.

1055
01:11:34.230 --> 01:11:36.250
It's just somewhere in the middle.
Somewhere in the middle.
Yeah.

1056
01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:39.990
But always great for the fans.

This is the best.
So good.

So find the dogs.

1061
01:11:55.051 --> 01:11:58.320
This is a nice place.
If your time,
I'm sorry about the street.
I couldn't help.

1062
01:11:58.321 --> 01:12:01.350
Am I going to be able to go home?
No,

Oh,
