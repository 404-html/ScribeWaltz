Um,
they didn't name no ask.

47
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.090
It's definitely,

48
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.500
but we have show business and show business is predominantly Jewish.

49
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.480
Persian Jews,
Russian Jews,
rally.
All kinds.
Yeah.
No,
I wouldn't,

50
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.450
I wouldn't like to do some reason too.

It's very exciting.

55
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.380
This is our first day back.
First Day back.

56
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:05.680
A lot of those shows were prerecorded.
This,

57
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.830
this is exciting due to being a movie star.

58
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:11.320
We had to put off a recording.

59
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:13.810
This one and I'm putting this one out on our regular schedule.

60
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.380
It's movies are lifestyle.
I'll get into it a little bit.
Oh,

61
00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:19.420
it did anything else happen in the break or just you did this movie?

62
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.630
Anything happened to me?
Maybe you're talking about this week,

63
00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:26.170
why this week is delayed.
Oh,
right.
No,
but I mean since we last recorded,

64
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.740
did anything happened maybe that know that this was straight to offer.

65
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:32.140
I didn't have to audition or anything.
Right.
No,
I know,

66
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:35.620
but I'm saying since our last episode I was,

67
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.970
I looked at front are like you got your hair done on Monday.
Right.

68
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.060
And then something else may have changed in our world.

69
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.990
Send did makeup and you got your hair done.
Yeah,

70
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.620

You're saying that the whether it got hotter and hotter,

71
00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:53.110
air conditioning broken that we're going to get into all that during the show.

72
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:57.010
I said that.
Okay,

Okay.

We're back.
We're going to talk about your hair.

77
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.760
We're going to talk about my movie.

78
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.570
Are the only things that have happened in the last month that have affected our

79
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:27.310
lives.
I got a new shirt out.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.070
You want a okay,

<v 4>Okay.

I've been polite.</v>

84
00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:44.530
I've been kind of been honest and sincere.

85
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.300
I like to have some on my lips.
I would like

86
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.580
to do is your roadmap.
Can you would like to have some sex.

87
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.820
<v 1>Randy,
don't bring anyone loving to this.</v>

88
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.600
Well,
go to your mom's house.

89
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.640
<v 3>It's funny.
I feel like a level of elation doing this again.
I know.
You know,</v>

90
00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:17.750
while it's really exciting,

91
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.590
especially because our lives have been so grown up in the last 10 days,
we just,

92
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:23.150
yeah,
you know what?

93
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.710
What should I let the cat out of the bag and was a big surprise?

94
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.930
What's the surprise?
Does anybody notice?

95
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:34.640
I'm a little smaller than the last time it was on the show.
Just a little.

96
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.020
I mean it's still a little poochy but,
but I farted,

97
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.010
I farted and I made a big shit.
I don't know.
Should Odo.
Boom.

98
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.570
We had a baby and a baby jeans.
Yeah.
And our lives had been a,

99
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.900
it's been 10 years.
What has been 10 days since I delivered little jeans.

100
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.790
Tiny jeans actually cause our first child is little jeans and the second child

101
00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:59.750
is tiny jeans.
Hi,
how are you?
What's your name?
What's Your Pronoun?
You know,

102
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.450
I was very offended because at the hospital we had to fill out a lot of

103
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:07.370
paperwork.
I requested non gender specific paperwork.

104
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.540
Right.
Let's give it a hard time.
It was very upsetting.
But God,

105
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.670
razzle dazzle.
What's the name of our child?
Slur.
Rosler.
Okay.
Raz,

106
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:18.110
Aka a Raz.

107
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.530
Razzle dazzle is going to live life not knowing that pink is for girls and blue

108
00:07:24.351 --> 00:07:26.270
is for boys and all that nonsense.

109
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.250
You know football only boys play football.
Bullshit.

110
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:36.200
Girls are really good football players too,
so,
oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

111
00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:39.140
I think you told her son that the other day you're like,
this is a man's sport.

112
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.100
Football.
You're already telling him.
Our eldest,
I got a,

113
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.510
gave him a little football and I said men play football and hockey.
Yeah.

114
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.340
Check play other women.
So that was nice.
He didn't say that.
No,
I didn't say that,

115
00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:55.750
but I was like,
you could be a man or you could,
uh,
not,
you know.

116
00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:00.080
Well I mean sports.
Do you like that whole gender stuff?
It's really,
it's so,

117
00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:02.090
it is so binary.
It really is.

118
00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:07.010
Like when I see my son picking up just handfuls of dirt and throwing it,

119
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:08.241
you know,
or,

120
00:08:08.241 --> 00:08:12.800
or just jumping uncontrollably off of furniture onto the beanbag chair,

121
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.260
you're like,
this is a boy.
There's,
there's no question about it.

122
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.180
And what if a girl did that?
What would you say then?

123
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:23.010
Uh,
you know,
so,
so yeah,

124
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:27.490
we had our little boy.
And do we want to reveal the name or,
sure.

125
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.860
Do you want to tell him you,
you came up with this one.
Okay.
Yeah.
Our first one.

126
00:08:30.861 --> 00:08:35.480
So you need a second one second child who is leaning?

127
00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:40.130
Boy?
Well we don't know.
We don't know yet.
No,
his name is Julian.
That's right.

128
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.960
Yeah.
His name is Julian Chilean and um,
he is ours.

129
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.860
I'm doing the paternity test.
Do you raising him as man did.
He looks,

130
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.840
both of our babies came out looking like at your Tommy's,
it's basically you,

131
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:57.900
but really,
really tiny.
Yeah.
Julian looks exactly like Elliston more or less.

132
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.860
Maybe his nose is a little different.
Uh,
they're blonde.
We don't,
you know,

133
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:03.940
we don't post pictures of our kids online.
I,

134
00:09:03.941 --> 00:09:07.200
I posted like a jokey picture of a baby with a beard saying that it was ours,

135
00:09:07.201 --> 00:09:09.300
but I don't,
I don't really publish

136
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:16.080
your baby's adorable on so nice.
People aren't really supportive,
but uh,

137
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:20.670
um,
they look like you.
It's so upsetting.
And then they eventually turn into me,

138
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:25.460
so that's okay.
But so we were waiting around.
Lj looks like you.
Oh yeah.

139
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.750
He's a Hungarian.
He's a hun all the way.
Uh,

140
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.520
so why do date was July 18th and Cardi B fucked everything up.

141
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.360
We're going to have a dual yeah.
Fucking thing.
Cardi yeah.

142
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.260
She had her baby like a week before me and so we were all waiting for him to

143
00:09:40.261 --> 00:09:40.711
show up.

144
00:09:40.711 --> 00:09:44.950
I had contractions every night for like four nights before and then finally they

145
00:09:44.951 --> 00:09:47.040
were like,
we have to induce you cause I'm old as fuck.

146
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:49.740
I'm 42 you are super old to have a baby.

147
00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:57.520
Just so everybody knows.
I get asked this a lot.
They're like,
Eh,
you know,

148
00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.350
people assume my gender.
They see my age and so offensive.

149
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:05.160
I'm 39 I don't even know the lifestyle you live.

150
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.930
I don't know what it's been over 40 has nothing to do with me.

151
00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:14.880
Nothing to do with you.
Enjoy your last year,
dude.
This is it.

152
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:20.370
This is it.
It's not,
that's not that long.
What are we gonna do for your birthday?

153
00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:25.260
Seeing how antisocial you are.
I don't think we should have a party like a party.

154
00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.680
I think it would really upset me.
I know.
No,
I know.
Your parents were like,

155
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.570
should we come out and have a surprise party for Tom?
No.
And I go,

156
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:37.260
do you even know your son?
That would probably be the worst thing to ever happen.

157
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.530
I don't like that.
I know.
I hate it too.
I fucking hate parties.

158
00:10:40.531 --> 00:10:44.670
It's more of a stress.
Um,
uh,
you know,
uh,

159
00:10:44.671 --> 00:10:49.620
dinner with like people that I choose.
No surprises.

160
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:54.810
No,
I'd like to have a nice dinner like five other people that we like,

161
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.990
not Bert because he'll eat up everything.
You got to be nothing to eat,

162
00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:01.710
nothing to drink.
Definitely not hurt.
No,
no.
Uh,
so anyways,

163
00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:04.280
let me just look back to the birthing story if you want it.
You know,

164
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.660
I think now people are curious because you had the baby.

165
00:11:06.661 --> 00:11:08.010
What else do you want to start here?

166
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.820
But I know a lot of people were curious cause I,

167
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:17.180
I posted out to the library of a logo and seeking his team to do is stand up now

168
00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.720
we're talking so stupid.

169
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.020
I posted a picture of a woman giving birth and a creek and I'm like,

170
00:11:22.021 --> 00:11:24.720
this is how I'm going to do it.
Obviously it's not.

171
00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:27.940
How many do you think is obvious to people online now?

172
00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:34.260
And I did travel with a Doula when I went to Las Vegas when I was eight months

173
00:11:34.261 --> 00:11:35.600
pregnant.
But that,
that was,
she's,

174
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.760
it's a fancy word for a baby nurse in case I were to go into labor,

175
00:11:38.761 --> 00:11:41.760
I'd have somebody with me cause you couldn't travel with me.
Uh,

176
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.690
that's why I had to do like not because I'm into natural birth,
I'm far from it.

177
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.330
So they induced me on uh,

178
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.360
the 18th in the evening and you spent the night with me.

179
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.570
He slept in the bed next to and then uh,

180
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.150
all night they give you some pill and it makes your cervix.

181
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.300
I watch porn jerked out a lot of times,

182
00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.200
like all my medical fantasies.
I got to kind of,
you know,

183
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.630
which nurse did you like the bat?
I kind of,

184
00:12:07.631 --> 00:12:12.631
I feel like I know which one I liked that you would have banked like of all,

185
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:17.080
you weren't sexually turned on by the birth at the birth?

186
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:21.690
No checking out nurses for sure.
I thought there,

187
00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.790
I'm being serious.
There was one nurse,
so I was like,
oh that's Tommy's type.

188
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.580
This is what goes through your head.
While you're about to have a baby.

189
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.730
I'm just trying to distract myself from what's about to happen.
Like I'm just,

190
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.800
I was just trying to entertain myself in the moment.

191
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:39.130
Like trying to disassociate a little bit cause it's kind of traumatic.
You know,

192
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.670
you're thinking about your husband's type of all the nurses walking.

193
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:46.090
There was one,
they were all really nice where we

194
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.770
know there was one blonde girl,
she was like a blonde hair,
blue eyed.

195
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.520
The skinny chick.
I didn't,
I didn't look at her tits situation like you like,

196
00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:58.840
but I was like,
oh I bet Tommy is probably a masturbating her right now.

197
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:02.030
She's in the delivery room.
God,

198
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.590
so I dilated all night or whatever and not dilated.
So which one was it?

199
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:10.120
I just told you she was the blonde one.
She's blonde hair blond ones.

200
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.590
She was like the skinny or one.
I'm trying,
I can't,
you know,
I don't know.
I can't,

201
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:16.760
I can't remember her name.
Okay.

202
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:22.090
So 9:00 AM the next morning.
Did you see me and her connected?

203
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:26.170
We have like chemistry,
surprisingly respectful at the birth.

204
00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:29.680
Like you weren't you flirty like you normally are?
Like what

205
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.300
do you know that husband,
there are husbands that do that,

206
00:13:34.301 --> 00:13:38.110
like that flair with the waitress in front of their wives.
It's so gross.

207
00:13:38.111 --> 00:13:41.440
My Dad would do that all the time in front of my step mom,

208
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.430
like flirt with the waitress.
So gross.
Okay,

209
00:13:45.431 --> 00:13:49.790
so 9:00 AM rolls around.
They bring us down to labor and delivery.
Uh,

210
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.210
and uh,

211
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:56.760
we at 9:00 AM I remember you and I hear this blood curdling Holy Spirit,

212
00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.770
that was really intense.

213
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.000
It was like the movies where you hear women giving birth,
you know how to like

214
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:21.970
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

215
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:32.260
<v 3>and then we heard a baby cry.
It was,
it was actually terrifying.</v>

216
00:14:32.261 --> 00:14:34.270
It was fucking horrible.

217
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:35.323
<v 2>Okay.</v>

218
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:40.660
<v 3>Like really intense.
And we walked by that room.
I was like,
yeah,</v>

219
00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.540
it was at that moment I go give me the epidural.

220
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.770
And I had had like a whisper of a contraction at that point.

221
00:14:47.771 --> 00:14:52.010
I had maybe two real contractions.
This thing with women about like,
Oh,

222
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.290
<v 5>you're not going to feel the pain.
Why do you guys do that?</v>

223
00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:58.150
<v 3>Oh,
I,
you know,
I don't know.
I asked this friend of mine who's like,</v>

224
00:14:58.151 --> 00:15:02.260
I want to do it naturally.
You know why?

225
00:15:02.261 --> 00:15:07.060
Because there's a badge of honor amongst women for the suffering and involved in

226
00:15:07.061 --> 00:15:09.870
motherhood.
Like how long did you breastfeed for?

227
00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:14.530
Or are you exclusively breastfeeding?
Right.
Um,
did you get the epidural?

228
00:15:14.531 --> 00:15:17.530
Did you suffer?
It's like a badge of [inaudible].
It's just,

229
00:15:17.531 --> 00:15:21.460
it's a stupid thing between us that like if you could go longer without the

230
00:15:21.461 --> 00:15:25.870
epidural,
you're somehow a better mother or you're,
you're stronger,
you know,

231
00:15:25.871 --> 00:15:30.100
you're more capable.
This is more silly.
White chicks are dumb.

232
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:33.450
I think you're right.
I'm actually going to Osi with you on this.
Yeah,

233
00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:37.540
I think it's preposterous when people opt out of an epidural,
first of all,

234
00:15:37.541 --> 00:15:39.760
it doesn't item,
as far as I know,
it doesn't hurt the baby.

235
00:15:39.761 --> 00:15:43.000
That's why they put it in your spinal column.
That doesn't fuck with the kid.

236
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.350
Secondly,
you wouldn't even get a cavity filled without anesthesia.

237
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:52.090
Why would you blast an eight and a half pound baby out of your coach and go

238
00:15:52.091 --> 00:15:55.480
through the contractions and stuff?
It's just silly.
To me.
It's silly.

239
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:59.890
So I had the epidural,
we,
you know,
they lay me on my side.

240
00:15:59.891 --> 00:16:02.170
They put a fucking beach ball between my legs,

241
00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:06.370
which is supposed to help the baby come to shoot,
shoot down the trail faster.

242
00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:10.630
You know you're eating your sandwiches and masturbating to porn as a,

243
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:14.320
we're waiting for the Lord when nurses,
Harris dilating,
dilating,

244
00:16:14.321 --> 00:16:19.030
dilating and then that's it.
They tell you to push and then an hour,

245
00:16:19.031 --> 00:16:20.730
an hour and 20 minutes of pushing

246
00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.480
<v 5>and then Julian blasted my badge.
Came right out of your snatch.</v>

247
00:16:25.481 --> 00:16:30.070
I watched it and did you did,
but you didn't look at my badge this time you said,

248
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:34.420
well here's the thing,
you're so,
it's funny.
You can be in,
it's funny,

249
00:16:34.421 --> 00:16:39.421
you can look at something and not notice something in the same eyeline because

250
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:45.400
I'm seeing him crown like basic size hair and style kind of.

251
00:16:45.401 --> 00:16:50.170
I see your purse just kind of going like expanding like somethings you're about

252
00:16:50.171 --> 00:16:53.980
to like take a real big shit out of your post or something.
Right.
And then no,

253
00:16:53.981 --> 00:16:56.740
it's a bit,
does that trip you out?
Are you like,
no,
because your shit,

254
00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.650
here's the thing is you're not like looking at like,
oh,
that's weird.
It's,

255
00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:03.340
it's your wife and your baby and you're going back and forth and the nurses say

256
00:17:03.341 --> 00:17:04.480
saying,
this is the doctor saying this.

257
00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.720
So you're just seeing it and it doesn't register,
you know?
Yeah.

258
00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:13.180
And then when he's actually coming out of you,
so crazy dude,

259
00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:16.900
when I see like his head hanging out of you,
yeah.

260
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.360
You're emotional and you're also like,
why you?

261
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.270
Why?
What are you emotional about?
I'm like,
what can I have sex again?

262
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.230
How long is it gonna is it gonna feel the same heart?
All those thoughts.
So,

263
00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:34.330
um,
no.
Um,
you know,
I'm seeing my,
my baby come in the world,

264
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:38.230
but it's a second one.
So it's like,
is it as fun as the firm is a no,

265
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:43.450
of course not.
Right.
But it's still a thing.
And,
and here's the thing,

266
00:17:43.451 --> 00:17:45.670
I'm seeing him and he's hanging out of you,

267
00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.040
but even though he's this far apart from you,
he's still in

268
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.940
<v 3>you.
I don't actually see your parts.</v>

269
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:57.420
It's all covered by baby.
Yeah.
No,
I'm just like looking at him.

270
00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:01.990
I'm not noticing three inches away.
Yeah,
I just don't notice it.

271
00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.560
I'll tell you why it's so,
it's so embarrassing when you,

272
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:08.090
when you labor cause like I can feel him like you know,
you don't,

273
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.950
you feel pressure.
You don't feel pain.
You can,

274
00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:14.970
if I can feel him like really fingering my badge really was I saw that.

275
00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.510
Yeah.
Like this.
Yeah.
I was like Bro,

276
00:18:18.511 --> 00:18:22.590
relax like this is that really necessary is really necessary bro.

277
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.320
You think that the doctor is doing unnecessary?

278
00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:31.060
I feel like he was pushing the vagina really
better,

279
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.660
doctor.
No,
he was fantastic.

280
00:18:33.661 --> 00:18:36.120
But you think he's doing things that are unnecessary?

281
00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.710
You know when people are doing stuff and that stuff doesn't need to be done.

282
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.460
I don't think it's that he's painting the roses red.
I was like,
dude,

283
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.410
don't worry about it.
I'll push this fucker out.

284
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:50.100
You don't need to like push my vagina lips back,
back,
back,

285
00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:52.080
back here more at this moment.
Then him,

286
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:58.680
if he listens to,
he'll never less and he's the best.
Yeah.
So fucking,

287
00:18:58.890 --> 00:18:59.221
you know what?

288
00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:03.030
I'll tell you something too that we haven't talked about off off air.

289
00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.380
When I was pushing,
I pushed with an epidural.
So it's a little numb.

290
00:19:07.381 --> 00:19:09.090
You don't really,
you can't feel the contraction.

291
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:14.510
I felt like the nurses and him were so disappointed in how I was pushing for the

292
00:19:14.941 --> 00:19:18.620
first,
you know what I mean?
Like they were,

293
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.710
I know it was so upsetting.
Yeah.

294
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:25.340
It's like I push as hard as I did that

295
00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.580
and I didn't know what to say either.
I'm like,

296
00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:34.070
Dude's then you did the pitocin.

297
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.900
They had to turn it up so that the contraction move the baby down.

298
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.880
Cause I wasn't naturally laboring.

299
00:19:38.881 --> 00:19:41.550
That was a manufacturer labor and the pitocin was too low.

300
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.840
So that the fucking cranking it up.
Great.
Let's go.

301
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.600
I'm all about that.
And medicated birth,
let's go.

302
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:53.640
So finally I took your big shit.
Shit.
No,

303
00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:58.140
I didn't see any shit.
I feel like I didn't,
I don't think I should know.

304
00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.250
Uh,
but then ever we had our Sassy nurse fuck.

305
00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.840
And this happened was last time too.
I don't know why.

306
00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:07.350
I think they do this on purpose.
These delivery nurses,

307
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:12.510
they'll put in one nurse who's like Mrs Personality and then she'll try to crack

308
00:20:12.511 --> 00:20:16.110
jokes when you're fucking pushing.
And I all,
I was this close to being like,

309
00:20:16.111 --> 00:20:19.020
can somebody get Shecky green out of the fucking delivery room?
Like the,

310
00:20:19.021 --> 00:20:22.080
you're the last fucking personality I need because believe it or not,

311
00:20:22.081 --> 00:20:26.700
Tom and I and real life moments,
we act like real people.

312
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:30.810
There's no joking.
It's like,
Hey,
this is pretty fucking serene.
Have a moment.

313
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.680
Of course asshole.
And she's like,
I can't even remember her stupid jokes.

314
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:38.370
It was a lot of stupid fucking hated her dumb fucking face so much.

315
00:20:38.371 --> 00:20:40.680
I wanted to kick her.
If I could have moved my legs,

316
00:20:40.681 --> 00:20:43.970
I would have kicked her writing her fucking dumb face.
I laughed and I laughed.

317
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.190
She got very upset.
Yeah,

318
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:52.210
<v 5>you guys had a little yeah,
tiff.
Tough,
tough,
tough buffalo.
No dummy.</v>

319
00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:55.640
That's not what I'm asking.
And she was like her,

320
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.490
her face dropped and she was,

321
00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:01.990
she looked at the other nurses and cause I asked her out at the nurse's station.

322
00:21:01.991 --> 00:21:04.500
So you asked her out?
Yeah.
After you,

323
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:10.050
I asked her just a question about,
um,
a visitor coming,
like,

324
00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:13.660
what time can they get in there whenever we can this visitor,

325
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:18.760
the visitor spend the night.
And she was like,
at your house?
And I go,
yeah,

326
00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:21.810
I'm asking you if somebody could spend the night at my house.
Yeah.

327
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:26.970
I figured I'd come to the hospital and ask the hospital staff who can spend the

328
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.330
night at my house.
Yeah.
You know,
I didn't say it like that.
I actually,

329
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.940
I laughed and I was like,
well no,
I know who can spend the night at my house.

330
00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:35.910
I'm asking you to come to spend the night here.
Right.

331
00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:40.810
And I laughed as I said it like,
you're fucking dumb.
And then she was like,

332
00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:45.780
you know,
it was like,
she was embarrassed that I,
you know,

333
00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:47.980
I didn't fully mocker I just kind of giggled.
Like,

334
00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:51.570
of course I'm not asking you that.
She got,
and she,

335
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:54.970
she gave me like two really smart ass answers and she looked at the rest of the

336
00:21:54.971 --> 00:21:59.950
girls and you could tell that they,
um,
you know,

337
00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.053
bow to her.

338
00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.120
<v 3>Well,
no,
because all turn out because here's why she was,</v>

339
00:22:04.121 --> 00:22:08.230
she was fucked up about that.
She's the person in the office who's the shaky,

340
00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:12.940
right?
She,
she's the the sarcastic,
funny one.
Right.
So when the professional,

341
00:22:12.941 --> 00:22:17.080
sarcastic,
funny one came to town,
she wasn't having any of it.
Of course.
Yeah.

342
00:22:17.081 --> 00:22:18.340
Yeah.
I swear to God.

343
00:22:18.341 --> 00:22:21.850
I know they put her in delivery rooms thinking that it puts the woman at ease,

344
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.590
but nothing makes me crazier than one.
Unfunny people try to be funny with us.

345
00:22:26.591 --> 00:22:27.790
I know.
It's like bitch,

346
00:22:27.791 --> 00:22:31.570
do you know that this is like we're professional fucking comedians do not come

347
00:22:31.571 --> 00:22:36.370
at me with your office humor with your case of the Mondays and with your fucking

348
00:22:36.371 --> 00:22:40.960
coffee here.
You know what I'm saying?
Like your coffee Mug joke.
Go Fuck Yourself.

349
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:42.880
I don't need it right now.
Yeah,
I know.

350
00:22:42.881 --> 00:22:46.820
I'm Matt Analyses How mad I am that they were mad at my pushes.
Like I,

351
00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:49.360
I'm fucking,
I'm so annoyed that they were like,

352
00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:53.350
and I had to like dig deep to find a positive mental space cause I felt like

353
00:22:53.351 --> 00:22:55.450
they were,
they were so angry.

354
00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.420
Like everyone is upset with me cause I didn't push the baby out in like one

355
00:22:58.421 --> 00:23:01.990
second.
No,
no fucking assholes now I'm all pissed.
Anyways,

356
00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:06.110
he came out,
he came out.
No he,
they,
they had to cut me again.
They got,

357
00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.100
I have another fucking a PCR autonomy,
which is horrendous.

358
00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.720
But he sewed it up really well.

359
00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:15.010
I have high hopes that my badge is going to bounce back cause I will tell you

360
00:23:15.011 --> 00:23:19.830
that this baby weighed a pound more than Lj,
more than a pound pound in it.

361
00:23:19.831 --> 00:23:24.670
And I was more,
this kid was eight,
eight,
eight pounds,
eight ounces.

362
00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:25.960
And let me tell you,

363
00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:30.580
I felt every pound of that thing come out me that is twice the size of my Ding

364
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:34.540
Dong.
Dude,
let me tell you something.

365
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:36.610
I've had my badge blasted before.

366
00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:42.090
This was like a fucking grenade went off and it didn't even look like my stuff

367
00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:46.880
and I,
I mean it was,
it was so crazy.

368
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:50.510
And They Make You pee right away cause you have a catheter in that's like the

369
00:23:50.511 --> 00:23:52.760
first thing.
What you,
you have a baby.
And uh,

370
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:57.170
the nicest nurse sits down with me and she's like,
okay,
you have to be no.

371
00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.920
And then she put on the water,
she's Filipino.
And then,
um,

372
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:05.410
she washed my vagina for me.
Yeah.
Like she took the squirt bottle,

373
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.600
lapped it right up.
She has like,

374
00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:13.420
there's some afterbirth tank clean like a puppy,
like a dog,
you know?

375
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:20.030
Yeah.
Just like a dog cleans up the puppies.
You're all clean now.

376
00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.850
I'll chemo and,

377
00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:26.750
and this woman was rinsing my vagina with the first though the water bottle.

378
00:24:26.751 --> 00:24:27.770
And then,
uh,
she,

379
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:32.830
she patted it dry and then she put the Tux medicated pads on the,

380
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:34.600
on the Max.

381
00:24:34.601 --> 00:24:38.480
That's disgusting Maxi pads that give you on these horrible hospital panties.

382
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.770
And she,
you know,
she sent me right up and I remember and I said to her,
I'm like,

383
00:24:42.771 --> 00:24:46.490
that was the most loving thing anyone's ever done for me.
I go,

384
00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:50.360
I've never had another woman lovingly washing my vagina.

385
00:24:50.361 --> 00:24:54.440
And the way you just did,
thank you so much.
It was,
it was wonderful.
She goes,
oh,

386
00:24:54.441 --> 00:24:58.810
thank you.
That's so nice.
Nice.
That's the daughter,

387
00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:03.340
the daughter of Kim.
And so then I had,
I forced pee out.

388
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:07.990
I was cool.
Um,
you know,
and then you're just broken up.
Do you have a baby?

389
00:25:07.991 --> 00:25:10.600
You feel like you got fucking hit by a truck for a few days.

390
00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.380
They dose you're full of Vicodin because you have contractions when your uterus

391
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:19.330
goes back and,
sure.
No,
we have a beautiful son,
a beautiful,
beautiful boy,

392
00:25:19.331 --> 00:25:23.290
healthy and he's great.
He's gaining weight.
He's,
he's a,
he's great.

393
00:25:23.291 --> 00:25:26.800
He's been home with us now for 10 days and it's been crazy.
It's been great.

394
00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:31.390
And your parents came and they are fucking useless.

395
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.540
But it's so fun to have.
Um,

396
00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:37.740
we had a good time with them on this thing because it all,

397
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:42.460
although they don't really,
you know,
do much but drink coke and,
and annoy us.

398
00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:47.350
They did entertain our toddler and gave him oodles of attention and he lapped
it.

399
00:25:47.351 --> 00:25:49.070
I'm just loved it.
That's fine.

400
00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:53.230
So that was great to have LJ to have him looked after by them,

401
00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.230
even though they managed to break all of our sleep training rules.

402
00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.730
I think he lived off of cake and ice cream exclusively for the time they were

403
00:26:00.731 --> 00:26:01.564
here.
Yeah.

404
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:07.230
I think he slept in their bed too because I followed up and no,

405
00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:10.840
really.
Then where did he get the idea of like nap in the bed?

406
00:26:10.841 --> 00:26:15.220
Like that's where Granddad was Natalie.
I think he's seen us more in beds.

407
00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:19.930
That's all.
That's what he did.
When your parents are oldest,
fuck kid,

408
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.070
your parents is lay down all day little they can do.

409
00:26:24.071 --> 00:26:28.270
I think that's what happened.
Yeah,
so there you go.
I'm back.

410
00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.900
I'm still deflating my stomach.
It's funny when you think you have a kid,

411
00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:36.340
when you have a baby that like your stomach just gets flat right away.
Not me.

412
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.190
It's,
you know,
it takes a couple of weeks.
I'm still kind of puffy.

413
00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.940
It's all kind of,
it's really neat to be on youtube though.

414
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:47.100
You're deflating so that everybody can comment on how fat I look or,

415
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.870
oh,
she's still pregnant.
Like that's cool.

416
00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.730
I was weighed.
You Gay.
You ate like a bunch of stuff,
Huh?
Yeah.

417
00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:59.640
That's kind of cool to be able to do this on the Internet.
You know,

418
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.960
the Internet's a nice place.

419
00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:04.260
That's the one thing I've learned about the Internet.
Yeah,

420
00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.690
it's full of Nice cause even Cardi B on her Instagram was like,
Nona,

421
00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.100
you motherfuckers are going to see my body until I do the snap back.

422
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.780
Like she's smart enough to not go on the Internet and show her body.

423
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:20.610
Me On the other hand,
not so much.
Yeah.
No,
she's a very smart lady.

424
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:25.620
She knows.
So yeah.
Anyway,
really disappointed that she um,
you know,

425
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:29.040
did it without us,
but it's very upsetting of course.

426
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:34.070
Why bother making a pact if you're going to break it and Cardi Bacardi,

427
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.990
Bacardi,
Bacardi was that stupid song,

428
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.450
body Bacardi caught and Gaudy.

429
00:27:39.451 --> 00:27:43.530
Dadi Dadi I had been flirting with nurses.

430
00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.620
But you have found yourself another man.

431
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:52.180
<v 4>No hair.
I've been polite.
A bank.
Kind of been honest and sincere.</v>

432
00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:55.540
Okay.
I like to have

433
00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:59.290
throw the fuck up.
I like,

434
00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:05.230
no,
I like to have some sex.

435
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:06.700
<v 3>Okay.
Okay.</v>

436
00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:10.150
How come it's never the hot guys that put the plea out there like this.

437
00:28:10.151 --> 00:28:12.760
Why is this guy,
what do you say about him?

438
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:18.580
I never see Brad Pitt being like,
I want the fucking titties.
He didn't have to.

439
00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:22.090
I think he would have got a big response if he did that.
I don't think so.

440
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:25.700
<v 4>I like to have a woman in my home and vomit.</v>

441
00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:30.230
I can make her laugh.
I'm going to throw,
he's so creepy.

442
00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:33.260
Little Boys.
Thank you.

443
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.800
<v 3>He's watching Rachel Maddow.
Yeah.
That's great.
Do you see that this class?</v>

444
00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:41.150
Yeah.
And check it out.
He'll make a promise to,

445
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:43.530
<v 4>Oh,
Mike,
you can throw,</v>

446
00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:49.600
throw up last lady 10 15 times before I even went.

447
00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.453
Beau marks.

448
00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:56.020
<v 3>Yeah,
Babe.
Nice.
He's so fucking gross.
I don't like him.</v>

449
00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.970
Now here's the thing I don't like,

450
00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:02.270
why is he wearing a shirt if he wants to be on their show?
Right.
Uh,

451
00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:07.210
but it is a really cool camera angles.
The shitty angle.
Check.
Uptight.

452
00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:11.740
It's underneath.
He's got on his tinted indoor glasses.

453
00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.920
Big creepy teeth.
Big Old,
creepy T.
I mean it's so close to the,
the,

454
00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:19.180
the camera has nothing but his face in frame.

455
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:23.380
But I can see that there's a shirt for sure.
It's disappointing.

456
00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:27.170
But the message is what?
I liked it here.

457
00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:32.210
<v 4>Thank you ladies.
I would like to pass her one day.
Have sex.
We got it bro.</v>

458
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:35.590
Hello.
Bye Bye.
I got it.

459
00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:40.380
<v 3>Okay.
But by now,
look at his choppers.
Those are bad.</v>

460
00:29:40.381 --> 00:29:43.970
Chompers he's got some fake keys so that's fine.
Um,

461
00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:48.430
the smile is no,
you're right about the up closeness.

462
00:29:48.431 --> 00:29:52.000
Like if you're not an attractive person,
don't give this close.
Yeah,

463
00:29:52.001 --> 00:29:56.440
go wide on the shot.
What woman do you think responds to this leaf?
It is a woman.

464
00:29:56.470 --> 00:30:00.820
I know.
I know.
I know you boys come down later for Musu.

465
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:07.530
Musu ladies desperate enough that this is the kind of dude she get down.

466
00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:09.820
Cause I ain't no regular dudes going to go for Moose.

467
00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.400
Do you think it's good back and forth

468
00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:27.550
like that
she would be looking for,
she's like,

469
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:32.440
she's flipping through guys.
Nice.
And then she sees this guy who's like,

470
00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:36.390
I want to Teddy's my face.
And she's like,
well,
because here's the thing.

471
00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.780
Most Soup Lady,
she lives on the river.
Yeah,

472
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:42.940
she usually deals with more blue collar dudes.

473
00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:47.890
So when this guy comes around,
she's like,
oh,
he's like a step up.
He's a good guy,

474
00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.970
blue collar guys or you know,
whatever.

475
00:30:51.971 --> 00:30:56.410
I'm just saying that he seems more maybe suave than like the river ds Slob.

476
00:30:56.411 --> 00:31:00.880
I love that he's Suave,
but don't you feel like,

477
00:31:00.881 --> 00:31:04.300
but he will make you come Tom.
Like don't you feel like he means it?

478
00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.070
I think you'll try to make you come.

479
00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:15.250
But didn't he say he got 15 he fucked 15 times.
True.
He really did.

480
00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:19.030
He said he fucked 15 times without an orgasm.
Is that what I said?
She,

481
00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:23.470
she had 16 she had 15 orgasms before he came.
That's what you said.

482
00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:27.100
Say No more.
So he's really,
he's down to lay it down.

483
00:31:27.101 --> 00:31:31.460
He's going to drop it in you.
Who would you rather be with?
Uh,

484
00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:33.040
this guy,
the teeth guy.

485
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:37.600
This guy or the guy who's like right now,
right now.
Right now.

486
00:31:37.601 --> 00:31:40.780
Right now I want to have the baby.
I want you to have that guy.
Oh my God,

487
00:31:40.781 --> 00:31:43.840
that guy's really fucking disturbed.

488
00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:48.940
This guy's just,
he's horny now.

489
00:31:48.941 --> 00:31:51.280
He's got a bad sense of what you do with that.

490
00:31:51.281 --> 00:31:54.220
Like what he should be doing with how bad he wants to have sex.

491
00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:59.290
So it make this video,
go see a prostitute man.
Just go.
Yeah,
go do that.

492
00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:02.290
What about the try it.
Okay.
What'd you do?
Try it out guy or this guy.

493
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:07.030
Oh this guy of course.
Do you have any idea how fucked up those guys are?

494
00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:10.990
Yeah,
I feel like I don't cause here's the thing,

495
00:32:10.991 --> 00:32:15.070
they all present as you would say in the therapy was guy's creepy.
Normal.

496
00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:19.060
Like here's the thing,
this guy is creepy.

497
00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:22.840
He presents just creepy and then I guarantee you we're going to get a follow up

498
00:32:22.841 --> 00:32:26.990
video for shits.
Way worser.
It could be way worser.
You know I could be,

499
00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:31.090
this is the,
this is the tip.
Cause normal dudes don't fucking do that.

500
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:35.140
Have you ever made a video?
Fuck No.
But if you have,

501
00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:39.980
if you have door number one,
door number two and donor

502
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.850
<v 0>and you're talking about right now,
right now.
Right now,
right?</v>

503
00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:45.590
That guy's an asshole.
Yeah.
And try it out guy.
And this guy,

504
00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:48.900
this is your best bet.
Not even close.
I'm going to go.

505
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.360
I'm still going to go and try it out.
Guy.
I'm going to go try it out.
Guy.

506
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:56.810
Here's why.
You're out of your God damn mind.

507
00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:03.680
I'm not a black guy who likes to fuck and fuck.
Good.
Yeah.
First of all,

508
00:33:03.681 --> 00:33:07.580
he would hate you.
I'm not as time,
but try it out.
Guys.

509
00:33:07.581 --> 00:33:11.510
Got some killer drugs.
We know that you're not into drugs.
I'm not into drugs,

510
00:33:11.511 --> 00:33:14.060
but I would have to be for this encounter.

511
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.570
I would just get high with him and then we'd forget about it.

512
00:33:17.571 --> 00:33:19.610
But that guy is going to follow through on his promise.

513
00:33:19.611 --> 00:33:22.880
He's going to make you calm 15 times.
Come again.

514
00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:27.270
You want to fucking do that shit again?
Yeah,
but I don't know.
I don't,

515
00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.900
I think you see this guy note like he's like,
I've been polite.

516
00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:34.670
I think he actually,
he knows kind of how to act a little bit.
You know?

517
00:33:34.671 --> 00:33:36.380
I don't think he's actually a,

518
00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:42.670
see this video for him is a different like throw of the bait.

519
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:49.120
So you like,
or what he did was he did videos where he's like,
I like,
I like,

520
00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:54.020
you know,
I like the poker.
I like watching baseball.

521
00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:57.200
He tried honey.
Yeah,
he tried it and since he didn't get any response,

522
00:33:57.201 --> 00:34:00.740
he was like,
I've been polite.
I'm really good at sex.
I like to have,

523
00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:03.500
he did that thinking that that will work.

524
00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:08.570
He's actually just sharing too much.
That's his problem.

525
00:34:08.571 --> 00:34:12.260
He doesn't know that this is not a good tactic.
Well yet he's,

526
00:34:12.261 --> 00:34:15.020
he's chumming the waters with different chump.

527
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:17.420
So this is another bucket and he's like,
is it,

528
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:19.950
is it sardines at the girls weren't right at worms.

529
00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:24.960
If it doesn't know that they don't want the Aumakua come that women are like,

530
00:34:25.311 --> 00:34:29.260
wait a minute,
this guy would make me go.
Like,
he doesn't know that,

531
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:32.090
but he thinks that that might work.
The thing is,

532
00:34:32.091 --> 00:34:35.840
is that he's motivated by mail motivations and he's assuming that women are

533
00:34:35.841 --> 00:34:40.760
motivated.
The similarly it's most men's mistake is when they go like,

534
00:34:40.761 --> 00:34:41.960
oh,
I don't get it.
You know,

535
00:34:41.961 --> 00:34:45.350
I just told her I'd fucking make her come for four strokes.

536
00:34:45.351 --> 00:34:48.000
And that came so hard,
like girls don't think that way.

537
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:53.840
If you not been around women ever
thinking that.

538
00:34:53.841 --> 00:34:57.740
Like I told her I'd fuck her hard.
I don't know what her problem is.

539
00:34:57.741 --> 00:34:59.770
Super hard and a pound the shit out of that plus,

540
00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:03.260
and then she'd come all over the place.
Yeah,
it's not,
it's not an ar.

541
00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:07.310
It's not number one on the list.
I'm not saying that women don't enjoy it.

542
00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:14.360
It's a guy thing,
like big decks.
I'd say that,
but I mean,

543
00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:18.720
not your brothers
with now and you're happy,

544
00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:23.450
but you're right.
It's maybe as a woman,
it's not number one on the list.

545
00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:28.540
Small dicks.
So we always told me
like,

546
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:32.530
I like the smaller,
the better.
I never would say this is smaller.

547
00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:36.950
You always told me you're like,
could you make it smaller?
Oh,
now I'm turned on.

548
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:38.300
He always said to me,
yeah,

549
00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:41.760
<v 3>just so just to let the guys listening now.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

550
00:35:41.761 --> 00:35:45.510
Generally if you're trying to to bait the women in,
okay.
Or you're online,

551
00:35:45.511 --> 00:35:49.260
you're trying to,
I'm going to come home and like you don't lead with,

552
00:35:49.261 --> 00:35:52.890
I got a big Dick.
That's not how you know you don't leave women.
Listen,

553
00:35:52.891 --> 00:35:56.520
women like to come women like penises of all sizes.
Yes.
Yeah,

554
00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:00.090
but you don't lead with that flood because most women don't want that as like

555
00:36:00.091 --> 00:36:02.970
the headline,
unless our total animals and they're on,

556
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:06.840
they're on a fuck thing like [inaudible] or whatever.
Yeah.

557
00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:09.450
Like at least she's putting out there like I want to come then.
Yeah,

558
00:36:09.451 --> 00:36:11.550
that's who you answered that with.
I tell you though,

559
00:36:11.551 --> 00:36:15.840
as somebody who obviously doesn't,
if somebody,
if a woman,
yeah,
hit me up,

560
00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:20.370
I'm saying,
let's say I'm single,
I'm on Tinder and this girl was like,

561
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.640
are you down to fuck?
Yeah.
My,
my thought,

562
00:36:23.641 --> 00:36:26.400
and maybe this is just my own insecurity,
I'd be like,
Oh,
this is,

563
00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:30.280
I'm getting cat fished right now.
Right horse.
And if she was like this,

564
00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:32.850
let me see how big that is.
I'd be like,
you gotta be kidding.

565
00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:37.440
Like how would I ever believe that that's sincere?

566
00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:42.560
Because it seems so out of left field to get from a woman that I'd be like,

567
00:36:42.961 --> 00:36:46.620
this is not normal.
This is not a,
this is another guy.

568
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:50.490
This is 100% who's going to a hundred jack off to my deck porch or just

569
00:36:50.491 --> 00:36:52.470
someone's fucking with me.
Like I'd be like,
this is not real.

570
00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:57.630
This is like a guy friend.
Well,
as somebody,
I have a friend who is on these,

571
00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:01.230
like who's on Tinder and on these fuck sites.
Yeah,
rest assured,

572
00:37:01.231 --> 00:37:06.231
there are women out there who really do just want to see your deck and get fuck.

573
00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:09.680
Now a lot of them are in relationships and they'll be like,
I'm,

574
00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:12.720
I'm married but I'm looking to swing or I've got a boyfriend.

575
00:37:12.721 --> 00:37:15.570
I'm looking at whatever.
There are animals out there,

576
00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:20.760
disgusting pigs that are willing to,
I know that they're out there.

577
00:37:20.761 --> 00:37:22.800
I'm saying the,
the,

578
00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:26.010
even the lady who's just putting it out there,

579
00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:29.460
she ain't no lady DM message of like,

580
00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:34.730
are you down to fuck 100% I'm not a real person or a bot or like a prostitute.

581
00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:40.020
How could you be?
I mean,
that's the thing is I would,
I don't know,

582
00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:43.230
I just wouldn't buy it.
I want to buy it either.
It's,
it's generally,

583
00:37:43.231 --> 00:37:46.350
it's out of the norm of feminine behavior.
That's what,
let's,

584
00:37:46.351 --> 00:37:49.460
let's leave it at that.
Like,
I think it's,
it's out of the norm.

585
00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:53.940
So here's what does work on women for the guy listening.
Okay.

586
00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:57.840
Lies,
here's what I mean.
Okay.
Yeah.
Tell us,
uh,

587
00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:02.400
emotional connection.
Women have to connect to you emotionally.

588
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:05.150
Generally not.
It's not,
you know,
it's a barrage in it.

589
00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:09.630
I'm just saying we have to feel something for you emotionally.

590
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:11.400
What's the lie that guys should be,

591
00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:16.050
that you're interested in looking for a relationship?
Unless she goes,

592
00:38:16.051 --> 00:38:19.140
I'm what,
but see,
it's,
it's more believable,
I think if a woman's like,

593
00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:21.150
I'm not looking for a relationship like that.

594
00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:25.020
Wordplay seems more believable that,
that what,
sorry.
That he's not,

595
00:38:25.021 --> 00:38:28.800
let's say the girl just wants to hook up her saying like,
no strings.

596
00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:30.660
I just want to hook up.
Oh,
right,
right,
right.

597
00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:35.410
That seems like that language seems more believable than like you got a big

598
00:38:35.411 --> 00:38:39.550
Dick.
Right,
right.
Yeah,
that's right.
So.
Okay,
very good point.

599
00:38:39.551 --> 00:38:41.410
So let's say you're the guy that wants to just hook up,

600
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:45.910
just do a no strings attached.
Yeah.
You but don't be like,
I got a big old Dick.

601
00:38:45.911 --> 00:38:50.470
It's gonna make your pussy Kinda hard.
Hard,
crazy.
Yeah.
We'll make it come.
Yeah.

602
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:53.960
This is another tactic tactic here.
Okay.

603
00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:01.190
<v 7>I just want to record you.
What is you saying?
Big,
big,
big,</v>

604
00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:06.110
big,
or for sale.
Oh,
I'm doing this.
I'm going to say about the way back.

605
00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:06.973
You know tomorrow.

606
00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:10.900
<v 3>So he is doing dick sale now.
Check it out.</v>

607
00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:15.410
<v 7>Yeah,
they're gonna eat for sale.
Oh,
$2,200 a pop baby.</v>

608
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:18.730
One other spot.
But I'll guarantee you gon be all right.
You're,

609
00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.360
I'm dead serious right now.

610
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:23.350
<v 3>This is like another version of the same guy.
Basically it,</v>

611
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:26.950
it's a different tactic.
He's,
he's like,
you pay me,
you pay me.

612
00:39:26.951 --> 00:39:31.030
He's on the visual tip.
Here's the thing,
most women don't need to pay for sex.

613
00:39:31.031 --> 00:39:35.620
We don't have to.
So this again,
this is another flawed tapping.
You getting any,

614
00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.380
any um,
takers?
Yeah,
negative.

615
00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:42.560
<v 7>There's a gimme one.
I guarantee you going to be all right.
You know,
tomorrow.
No,</v>

616
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:48.370
no woman wants to sail.
You don't want nick.
Why now I Gabi give me,

617
00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:52.430
give me $200 on there.
I'm going all night,
baby.

618
00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.800
$20 I'm going on not,

619
00:39:54.801 --> 00:39:58.460
you didn't Glean for sale niggling for sale.

620
00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:03.660
<v 3>Uh,
he might be a little fucked up,
right?
Oh,</v>

621
00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:08.640
he's got his $20 like how,
by the way,
she at $20.

622
00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:13.320
She didn't even say anything else.
He just looked at him probably like,

623
00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:18.240
okay,
okay.
Yeah.
20 and $20 that,
you know what?

624
00:40:18.241 --> 00:40:23.241
That was the fatal flaw of the TV show Gigolos that you and I loved for so long.

625
00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:30.600
I forgot.
Hey,
he was on that show.
Yeah,
but your,
your army.

626
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:35.750
The problem with Gigolos is that there's so few women out there who need to pay

627
00:40:36.031 --> 00:40:39.810
for sex.
Right.
Like we don't have to give you $200.

628
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:44.840
I think the only time it ever makes sense actually thinking about it when the

629
00:40:45.001 --> 00:40:45.834
woman does it,

630
00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:51.320
is the woman who doesn't know how to do the no strings attached hookup.

631
00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:56.910
Yes.
Because for some people that's it.
They don't know how to approach it.

632
00:40:56.970 --> 00:40:57.900
That makes sense to me.

633
00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:03.290
I would do it like if I were a single 35 year old professional woman and I was

634
00:41:03.331 --> 00:41:07.410
like,
you know,
I kind of want a good experience.
I'm lonely,
I'm horny.

635
00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:10.410
I don't want to go to a bar and find some of stage bag.

636
00:41:10.411 --> 00:41:14.940
Like let's get some guy who knows what he's doing.
I know what I'm getting into.

637
00:41:14.941 --> 00:41:18.550
And then,
you know,
I pay for it.
He's clean,
I'm clean,
whatever.
Yeah.

638
00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:22.700
It's got a big hollow donkey,
Dick and his legs and okay,
he's good,

639
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:26.040
but he's going to role play and he's going to plow the garden gardener.

640
00:41:26.041 --> 00:41:30.570
I'd be like,
ah,
I left the,
I left the bill.
I don't know if you paid me yet.

641
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:33.250
Oh,
how much should I go?
Oh yeah,
yeah.

642
00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:36.950
I got my leaf blower and then he pulls it out.
He was like,

643
00:41:36.951 --> 00:41:40.850
have you seen this leaf blower?
Yeah.
You're like,
oh,
make Gustava.

644
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:45.440
Oh my sprinklers broken.
I like it or not.
That means I,
um,
I,
yeah,

645
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:49.150
I don't know though.
Again,
I say that,
but I don't know that I'd actually have the

646
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:54.230
<v 5>courage a dig a dangling to do that message here it says,</v>

647
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.830
Geez,
I was listening to four 58 and you were discussing the idea of giving

648
00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:01.950
explanations of your body before the act occurs.
Yeah,

649
00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:06.570
got me thinking back to my college days and I was seeing a guy that was 12 years

650
00:42:06.571 --> 00:42:10.770
older after many meetings and make out sessions in the bars.

651
00:42:10.771 --> 00:42:12.000
He finally took me home.

652
00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:16.410
I was so stoked yoga instructor about to give me a free lesson.

653
00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:19.590
We get to his place.
He tells me he has to warm me,

654
00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.140
warn me about the size of his member.

655
00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:27.090
As you can imagine my mind races to so many different places with the dread of a

656
00:42:27.091 --> 00:42:31.920
small we we,
I try to remind myself of the saying,
it's not about the size,

657
00:42:31.921 --> 00:42:35.640
but how he uses it.
I let him explain with my excitement.

658
00:42:35.641 --> 00:42:40.641
He tells me it has some girth to it and I will more than likely bleed.

659
00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:45.030
What?
As I was a 21 year old college girl,

660
00:42:45.031 --> 00:42:49.920
I was up for the challenge.
We proceeded to get dressed and I was like,
Oh yes,

661
00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:50.641
definitely.

662
00:42:50.641 --> 00:42:55.470
Biggest one in my book after a few thrust groans in and throws I s I noticed

663
00:42:55.471 --> 00:43:00.360
it's a bit more wet than usual.
Unfortunately,

664
00:43:00.361 --> 00:43:05.280
the pain outweighed the alcohol and the bed looked like a murder scene.

665
00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:09.980
I was devastated and embarrassed.
He told me to hop in the shower after awhile.

666
00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:11.130
He joins me in the shower.

667
00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:15.030
It tells me that this isn't the first time that it's happened to not feel

668
00:43:15.031 --> 00:43:18.450
embarrassed.
We go back to the bedroom and to my disbelief,

669
00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:21.990
he had changed all the bedding and it looked like nothing had taken place.

670
00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:24.480
We'd lay there.
He tells me if I would like to.

671
00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:28.740
He would like for whatever the this was to continue and he promised to take it

672
00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:30.040
easy.
Oh,

673
00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:34.920
we saw each other for almost a year and thankfully it was never that bad.
Again,

674
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:38.580
thanks for reading my story.
Thank you for providing me with entertainment.

675
00:43:38.581 --> 00:43:42.540
Am I commute to work?
Would love to see you in the Midwest.
Number One,
Mommy,

676
00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:43.913
Jessica.

677
00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.790
<v 3>Jessica.
That's a lot of vaginal tearing,
I'm assuming.</v>

678
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:51.000
But it also sounds like she adapted.
They saw each other for a year.
Yeah.

679
00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:54.180
I think you should probably when you're drunk too,

680
00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:57.830
you may overestimate your ability to handle,
that's 100% yeah.

681
00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:01.920
Like if you use a lubricant,
I think it sounds like also,

682
00:44:01.921 --> 00:44:06.810
it was nice that he gave us the warning.
Really Nice.
Yeah.
I,
you know,

683
00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:10.320
I like you should,
why not give somebody that Henry Lee,

684
00:44:10.321 --> 00:44:14.040
he's done this to other people.
Like,
Hey,

685
00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:18.330
there's this thing that happens that's so us.
It's unreal.
It must be so painful.

686
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:19.510
Yes.

687
00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:24.610
<v 5>Somebody a hey Hitler.
Um,
I forgot that.</v>

688
00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:29.380
I'm fine with my,
I fight with my big stupid boyfriend all the time.

689
00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:34.500
Mostly because he's taking 10,
12 Jen Benadryl before we make it better fitness.

690
00:44:34.501 --> 00:44:38.310
And it comes after four strokes since every couple has fights.

691
00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:42.780
I was wondering if your jeans ever get too low and loose on recording day.
Oh,

692
00:44:42.781 --> 00:44:47.490
the mommy's have to put their lovers Paula side to record.
Why Mh feel me?
No,

693
00:44:47.491 --> 00:44:48.420
I mean what I'm saying,

694
00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:53.040
I just want to know if my mom's ever fight like a normal married couple or any

695
00:44:53.041 --> 00:44:57.210
advice on how to avoid or quickly and relationship fights.
Thanks.

696
00:44:57.211 --> 00:45:02.010
Jeans.
No,
we're perfect.
Sarah knee from tits Berg.
No.
Right Tommy,

697
00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:04.830
we totally perfect.
Don't know what you're talking about.
No,
of course we do.

698
00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:09.720
You know what the banks,
here's the best thing.
Um,
my advice,

699
00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:13.140
what we definitely have our fights like any normal couple of course.

700
00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:17.340
I think the best thing is we're actually pretty good at talking it out.
Yes,

701
00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:20.310
we were.
We're good at sensing it.
Like I know something's wrong.

702
00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:22.710
I know you're upset about something.
What is it?

703
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:27.950
And the thing that I've learned to do more as I got older with experience,

704
00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:32.880
um,
is after you make,
you know,
you need to get off your chest,

705
00:45:32.881 --> 00:45:35.730
the other person has to listen to you.
You have to listen to them.

706
00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:41.060
And as long as you try to see the other person's perspective and they try to see

707
00:45:42.541 --> 00:45:45.240
yours,
usually you can resolve things pretty quickly.

708
00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:49.770
That's what I try to do is like,
Hey,
I'm upset about this,
blah,
blah,
blah.

709
00:45:49.771 --> 00:45:52.410
Here's what it is and this is why I'm upset about it.

710
00:45:52.411 --> 00:45:56.310
Do you understand why I'm upset?
Yeah.
And when someone like goes like,
yeah,

711
00:45:56.311 --> 00:45:57.480
I do understand why you're upset.

712
00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:01.980
Well usually a lot of what's bothering you kind of goes away and then they say

713
00:46:01.981 --> 00:46:04.170
it to you.
Right?
If you're like,
okay,

714
00:46:04.171 --> 00:46:07.950
well at least I understand where you're coming from.
Kind of resolves it.

715
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:11.360
<v 3>But I have to admit when we,
when we do have our disagreements and stuff,</v>

716
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:15.710
it's so hard for me sometimes when I'm super angry to understand your side of
it.

717
00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:20.180
Like I have to calm myself down.
Of course everyone does so much to be like,
wait,

718
00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:22.670
what the fuck is he saying?
I know he's fucking retarded.

719
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:25.670
I know he's fucking wrong.
I know.
It was so stupid.

720
00:46:25.671 --> 00:46:27.770
I hate his fucking guys want to tear his face off.
Yeah.

721
00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:32.620
And then after I go through all that stuff,
yeah,
yeah.
Uh Huh.

722
00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:37.400
After I curse you and wish you were dead.
Yeah.
Then I go,

723
00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:40.190
maybe I should listen to him because then that's the only way we're going to

724
00:46:40.191 --> 00:46:43.220
stop this.
Find a nice way of describing the whole thing.

725
00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:47.300
You gotta be so retarded.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

726
00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:51.140
Cause cause I don't,
I hate the fighting too.

727
00:46:51.141 --> 00:46:53.240
Like if I just want it to stop,
you know,

728
00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:57.780
<v 5>somebody one time was like,
why don't you,
uh,
like airy or fights more?
No,</v>

729
00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.350
that's not the show.
Yeah.
Now

730
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:04.950
<v 3>Apropos your question about recording day.
Absolutely.</v>

731
00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:09.970
There have been times where we've been recording and had to stop and have a

732
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:15.470
little thing and then we go back to the show.
The reason,
I don't know,
we don't,

733
00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:16.380
I don't really,

734
00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:20.010
we don't include it cause it's kind of like sometimes it trickles into very

735
00:47:20.011 --> 00:47:23.340
personal things that are happening in the house.
Yeah.
I don't want to,

736
00:47:23.341 --> 00:47:27.360
I don't want everybody to know every,
every,
every view and when we share a lot,

737
00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:30.220
yeah.
But there's some shit that Tom and I should keep

738
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:33.460
<v 5>private too.
I feel there's,
there's that.
I also feel like this,</v>

739
00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:38.470
I mean our show is silly.
We like to have a fun time.
We do,

740
00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:42.730
we joke around,
we play crazy videos and drops and we have fun.

741
00:47:42.731 --> 00:47:46.720
So yeah,
if like I'm,
if I'm in an argument with you,

742
00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:50.440
to me,
I mean I understand the curiosity of someone being like,
oh,

743
00:47:50.441 --> 00:47:52.570
I'd like to hear the argument.
Yeah.
But it's like,

744
00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:57.580
to me it's not the vibe of what we do.
Wow.

745
00:47:57.710 --> 00:48:01.600
So some people are going to just disagree with that.
I'm fine with that.

746
00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:04.870
You can disagree with it and you can also start your own fucking podcast to do

747
00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:07.810
your own stupid shit.
Fuck you.
Dumb ass.

748
00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:11.570
<v 3>Also too,
I think it's a bummer,
uh,</v>

749
00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.620
for people to hear married couples argue.

750
00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:19.840
I don't like to hear other people's like,
you fucked this up.
Yeah.

751
00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.510
I don't like it.
Especially,
you know,

752
00:48:22.511 --> 00:48:25.510
you listen to the show to get away from that shit.
What do you want to hear?

753
00:48:25.511 --> 00:48:28.570
A fucking married couple arguing about the same shit.
You argue about it.

754
00:48:28.571 --> 00:48:32.560
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
I don't know what,
listen,
the point is a yes,

755
00:48:32.561 --> 00:48:35.410
Tom and I argue we do.
We try to be civil,
I think.

756
00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:40.150
I think the thing that sustained our relationship is that we hold our tongues in

757
00:48:40.151 --> 00:48:44.140
terms of saying really evil shit to each other.
At least like,
I'll think it,

758
00:48:44.141 --> 00:48:46.060
like I said,
I'll go through it in my head,
but I won't,

759
00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:50.860
I try not to say things that will like the cause irreparable damage.

760
00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:53.800
I think that that's,
yeah,
of course.
Yeah.
You try not to shout.

761
00:48:53.801 --> 00:48:56.830
We try not to be like,
you know,
if shooty try,

762
00:48:56.860 --> 00:49:00.280
if you say something during an argument that can cause irreparable damage,

763
00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:05.030
it will like you,
you have to kind of keep it.
Yeah.

764
00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:09.670
He was civilized dude.
Sure.
I know people that argue like that and you're like,

765
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:11.440
man,
of course we did.

766
00:49:11.441 --> 00:49:15.040
We were friends with the people that argue like that and it's explosive and

767
00:49:15.041 --> 00:49:18.610
volatile and some people love it because then they can fucking makeup after and

768
00:49:18.611 --> 00:49:23.500
it's that volatility cycle.
I personally,
I hate it.
I,
you know,

769
00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:26.350
I grew up fighting with my parents and my mother.
I fucking hate it.

770
00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:27.730
I hate that stuff,
man.

771
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.020
<v 5>Yeah.
It's no fun.
It's the worst.
Um,</v>

772
00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.300
here's really what I wanted to get into with you too.
It's like,
oh,
okay,

773
00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:36.100
why aren't we doing this?
Why

774
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:41.410
<v 8>are we in a normal family?
We have two kids order Domino's for dinner sometimes,</v>

775
00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:45.080
right?
I'm ready to go.
Our Kids Canaan's Zeiler RFA and a half years old,

776
00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:48.450
we're raising that and using Dave van,
they're gender neutral.

777
00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:54.520
They can decide for themselves when and how they want to identify as agender.

778
00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:02.670
<v 5>That was a kid that part,</v>

779
00:50:02.671 --> 00:50:06.060
how do they understand the concepts that at three years old meet,

780
00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:10.920
if we ask Ellis every day,
hey,
what's your pronoun?
He'd be like,
what?
I like cars.

781
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:15.480
I wish this thing into the more into the depths of like,

782
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:19.290
like I wish that follow them around and show them,
ah,
you're right.

783
00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:23.610
I think with just like a,
you know,
a nice old guy at a cafe,
he's like,

784
00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:28.100
oh hey boy or girl.
And they're like,
we're uh,
kind of using the bay.

785
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:32.090
<v 3>Then there,
and he's like,
what?
Like,
you know,</v>

786
00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:36.920
so that they choose their own gender.
The fuck is your problem and other gay.

787
00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.550
There should just be a show.
By the way.

788
00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:45.580
I feel like it'd be a number one hit where you just show old people things like

789
00:50:47.211 --> 00:50:50.090
this.
I just have them go like,

790
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:52.370
I don't understand what's happening.

791
00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:55.280
It's kind of like kids say the darndest things.
Remember what cause we did,

792
00:50:55.281 --> 00:50:58.960
but with old people.
Old people too.
That's a fucking great show.
We got a pension

793
00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:06.140
I think two,
nine times out of 10 these gender,
gender people,

794
00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:10.430
it's usually the parents that are having gender issues,
I'm guessing.

795
00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.710
Not The children.
Do you know what I'm saying?

796
00:51:12.711 --> 00:51:17.010
I think that the dad or whatever Mapo me pop my ma,

797
00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:21.360
he's the one questioning.
He's like,
yeah,
you're here.
Let's keep going early.

798
00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:23.600
Projecting this shit on.
Let's keep going.

799
00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:24.643
<v 9>Clearly</v>

800
00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.600
the section of the gender of your child is important to other people.

801
00:51:29.601 --> 00:51:33.050
Partially just because it's part of the social.
See there any different,

802
00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:38.600
no idea that some children are she and some children are hee to them.

803
00:51:38.601 --> 00:51:39.434
They're all children,

804
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:42.230
so like I was saying difference and the other kids that they're with.
Yeah.

805
00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:46.900
<v 3>That's not true.
That's definitely not my son.
Of course.
Yeah.</v>

806
00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:50.740
He plays with other boys cause they like to play trucks together and sometimes

807
00:51:50.741 --> 00:51:54.190
he plays a girl that he knows that like this girl is acting different than the

808
00:51:54.191 --> 00:51:57.070
boy playing dollies or whatever.

809
00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:02.930
<v 9>A lot of young girls when they grow up,
they're called,
you know,
don't get dirty.</v>

810
00:52:02.931 --> 00:52:05.510
Don't do that.
That's not saying all those kinds of things.

811
00:52:05.511 --> 00:52:08.660
Are Gay girls capable of doing all these things?

812
00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:11.540
<v 3>Okay,
well those are called lesbians.
The ones that get dirty</v>

813
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:15.830
<v 9>play softball swing.
Then the young boys are called,
Oh don't cry.
You're okay.</v>

814
00:52:15.831 --> 00:52:18.740
Be Strong,
and then they aren't comfortable having emotions,

815
00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:19.740
which can cause a lot.

816
00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:21.540
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

817
00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:24.750
There are ways of teaching your children this stuff without fucking up their

818
00:52:24.751 --> 00:52:28.710
gender identity.
You can be like,
hey,
boys can cry.
Girls could get dirty,

819
00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:30.720
girls can play football.

820
00:52:30.721 --> 00:52:35.200
Boys can play Dolly's without totally screwing up their gender and then they

821
00:52:35.201 --> 00:52:38.430
turn like eight and they're like,
hey,
I don't want to do that thing anymore.

822
00:52:38.431 --> 00:52:42.280
I've been doing this for the other sex.
I know.
Like,
yeah,
that's a good,

823
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:44.940
you just hit a certain age.
You figured that out.

824
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.840
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

825
00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:52.100
It was not something that we have discussed with either of them at all really or

826
00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:56.030
as nervous about that because you think maybe it's too rich of a concept for

827
00:52:56.031 --> 00:52:59.030
them.
They asked about it so we're waiting until that question comes up.

828
00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:02.620
<v 3>It's not good.
No,
but that's the thing I want to hear.</v>

829
00:53:02.621 --> 00:53:06.990
It's like when they go to like school or camp and they're like,
all right,

830
00:53:06.991 --> 00:53:09.990
in the camera,
he's like boys over here and girls over there and,

831
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:14.060
and then someone's like,
what are you?
And then the kids like,
ah,

832
00:53:14.061 --> 00:53:18.420
I think I'm a boy.
And then the mom's like,
why didn't you,

833
00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:22.940
what did you decide that?
And it's like,
no,
I am a boy right there.
Look,

834
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:25.650
what do you think you are?
But think of that that's going on.

835
00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:30.270
It's so much more tremendous traumatizing.
Then you know you,

836
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:33.420
you identify them as boy or girl and then they later go,
hey,

837
00:53:33.421 --> 00:53:35.430
I think I feel like a girl.
And then you go,
okay,

838
00:53:35.490 --> 00:53:38.130
then you were a girl problem solved.
Like,

839
00:53:38.131 --> 00:53:42.330
why are you fucking them up from the beginning?
Let them present later in,

840
00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:45.840
you know what I mean?
And then be cool with them presenting.
However,

841
00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:49.680
like if Ellis or Julian later,
like,
you know what?
I think I'm a girl.
I'm like,

842
00:53:49.681 --> 00:53:54.210
all right,
are you,
you know you can talk about it.
You feel it.

843
00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:58.200
I'm not going to let them fucking take hormones and grow tits when they're 12

844
00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:03.330
why you got wait and see or at least 18 before you screw up your biology.

845
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:06.690
It's crazy.
Sons was like a think I'm a girl.

846
00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:11.960
I'd be like throwing these gloves and tell me how you feel when I'm done with,

847
00:54:12.361 --> 00:54:16.360
you
know,

848
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:25.680
you are still breathing three minutes,
you can be a girl.
I agree.

849
00:54:25.681 --> 00:54:28.500
You know,
you grow up rejecting your parents' values so much.

850
00:54:28.501 --> 00:54:31.680
I did anyways and now that I am a parent,
I'm like,
you know what?

851
00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:35.190
Parents were right.
Everybody's on drugs,

852
00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:40.580
everybody's fucking retard and crazy and you just gotta anyone can be

853
00:54:40.741 --> 00:54:42.050
transgender.
I'm serious.

854
00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:46.850
I feel like that's completely obviously legit force,

855
00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:51.140
but to tell a little three year old,

856
00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:54.050
three year old be like,
I dunno,

857
00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:57.870
it doesn't know what's going on.
He doesn't even know.

858
00:54:57.871 --> 00:55:01.740
And to make an issue of it before,
it's an issue.
That's really what it is.

859
00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:05.400
It's like saying you don't have to,
if it's your boy,
you don't have to be like,

860
00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:09.990
it's just trucks and football.
Yeah.
Our son,

861
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:14.460
our son likes the color pink.

862
00:55:14.461 --> 00:55:18.090
I bought him a pair of pink sunglasses yesterday at buy buy baby and the story,

863
00:55:18.091 --> 00:55:22.110
he liked it.
I got it for him.
He turned around,

864
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:25.170
he played with it for a total of two minutes and it's gone.

865
00:55:25.171 --> 00:55:28.080
It's onto the next thing.
So it's not a big fucking deal.

866
00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:30.970
If he came to me and said,
I'm a woman.
Okay,
great,
let's,

867
00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:35.340
let's fucking talk about it.
Let's do some,
you know what I mean?
It's like making,

868
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:38.910
it's the same thing with sugar.
All kid can't have the sugar,
don't give the kid,

869
00:55:38.911 --> 00:55:40.350
and then you make a big deal out of it.

870
00:55:40.351 --> 00:55:44.280
And when the kid finally gets her hand on diabetic,
go crazy.

871
00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:48.530
Why are we making a big,
just don't make a fucking deal a little bit.

872
00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:54.910
These people making crazy gender fluid.

873
00:55:56.150 --> 00:56:01.150
People at penises identify as being boys [inaudible]

874
00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:07.900
vice versa.
She's got vocal fry.
Ash got serious vocal fry.
You know,

875
00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:12.420
listen,
not everybody has issue with their gender,

876
00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:16.110
not they.
These people do.
I don't,
I would say that I'm not,

877
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:21.790
I'm so sick of the like some people like most the overwhelming,

878
00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:24.010
the way,
that way that she should phrase

879
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:24.843
<v 5>that sentence.</v>

880
00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:30.060
The overwhelming majority of people with penises are men who identify as men and

881
00:56:32.471 --> 00:56:33.304
when I,

882
00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:38.970
and when we say that we're talking somewhere between probably mm 2.8 and 3.5

883
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:42.543
billion

884
00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:48.910
of the men on earth feel that way and then there's the 0.0,
zero,
zero,

885
00:56:48.911 --> 00:56:53.650
zero one 5% of the population.
Then identify the way you're describing.

886
00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:58.240
Yeah,
so there you go.
You're fucking weird.
Let's not make this.

887
00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:05.570
<v 9>There is research that shows when you Jesus Christ our language.</v>

888
00:57:06.691 --> 00:57:09.450
When we say good morning boys and girls are,
when we just say to our kids,

889
00:57:09.451 --> 00:57:14.040
come on girls or what a smart boy you are using gender to sort and categorize

890
00:57:14.041 --> 00:57:17.190
and label kids.
We do know that that increases

891
00:57:18.110 --> 00:57:22.490
<v 5>stereotypes.
There certainly feels that way.
Yeah they always are.</v>

892
00:57:22.491 --> 00:57:24.890
There always are fluid themselves.
And they also,

893
00:57:24.891 --> 00:57:28.190
they said there's research that shows they don't show the research though.

894
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:29.900
What did you do?

895
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:36.410
Did you pull five of years dams and then they told you that that's your

896
00:57:36.411 --> 00:57:37.970
research.
Okay.

897
00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:40.570
<v 9>There's alto pitches babies.</v>

898
00:57:40.571 --> 00:57:45.571
I'm hoping that they'll grow up and be supportive of other people and who they

899
00:57:46.451 --> 00:57:50.830
are and how they feel and really confident in who they are themselves.
Right.

900
00:57:50.831 --> 00:57:51.570
So just raise

901
00:57:51.570 --> 00:57:56.340
<v 5>compassionate children and don't put your gender shit on them cause it's clear</v>

902
00:57:56.341 --> 00:57:59.280
that the mom,
the mom and the dad or whatever they are,

903
00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:03.720
they're the ones with the gender issue.
Kids seem fine.

904
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:08.750
They seem pretty content doing what kids do at three there,
the one

905
00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:12.090
<v 9>one's labeling over labeling and over analyzing this whole</v>

906
00:58:12.210 --> 00:58:16.260
<v 5>or shit.
Here is a quick message we got.</v>

907
00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:18.270
Um,
regardless,

908
00:58:18.271 --> 00:58:23.100
as high belt King and Queen Queen,
I was watching your podcast,

909
00:58:23.101 --> 00:58:25.560
which I do sometimes order to see the videos you talk about.

910
00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:30.210
I'm glad I did for episode four 57 while Tom was deciding who to fuck between

911
00:58:30.211 --> 00:58:32.430
shit pig,
sissy of Fremont tried out guy.

912
00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:36.870
I noticed he adjusted what looks like to be his gland penis while deciding on

913
00:58:36.871 --> 00:58:40.710
shit pig.
Is this acting or was he just getting horn up by shit?

914
00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:45.720
Pixely you explained yourself Derek.
Well,
here's the moment right here.
Let's see.

915
00:58:45.721 --> 00:58:50.580
Okay,
let's let him fucking that guy.
You're fucking the teeth.
Yeah,
Dawg.
Shit.

916
00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:53.980
Oh yeah.
I'm like pissing on try it out.

917
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:59.240
Walk me through your logic here.
There.
Write them.

918
00:58:59.250 --> 00:59:03.810
They forgot their pronoun there.
Right?
Look at it.
Yeah,

919
00:59:04.290 --> 00:59:06.570
I'm jerking off right here and I'm getting my four strokes.

920
00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:11.670
If 50 times your time.
Yeah,
I mean what can I say?
You caught me.

921
00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:15.960
Okay.
You caught me.
Is it so bad that a shit pig turns me on?

922
00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:20.310
That guy was willing to do anything.
He was like pissing my shit in my mouth.
No,

923
00:59:20.311 --> 00:59:22.900
no,
no.
We're talking about the shit pig.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

924
00:59:23.010 --> 00:59:26.660
See me at the train station.
Oh,
that guy.
Yeah,
that so,
yeah.
Wow.

925
00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:31.430
Dirty shooting shit.
Jag in your deck.
Yeah,
I was so turned off by him.

926
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:36.440
Let me just,
that conversation got me worked up.
Get me worked up.
Yeah,

927
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:39.920
I confess.
It turned me on.
Um,
we are going to

928
00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:45.500
get our boy.
Yeah,
come back here.
You'll not notice that there's a break.

929
00:59:45.501 --> 00:59:48.470
I always feel weird talking about breaks,
but this is what we're going to do.

930
00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:53.750
And I got some chart with Tom Stuff to play.
You got some more clips and a well,

931
00:59:53.751 --> 00:59:57.890
yeah.
All right.
Give us a moment to get her life together.
He Fan.

932
00:59:57.891 --> 00:59:59.750
We're back and we have none.

933
00:59:59.751 --> 01:00:04.070
Your apathy is so hard and he came so thick.

934
01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:08.660
My brother,
I haven't thought about that guy and you know,

935
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:12.380
10 whole days now.
I'm glad he's back in my mind and my heart.
It's great.
Right?

936
01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:20.200
So,
so good to know that,
to get back into it now.

937
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:24.280
Happy that he's,
he's fine.
He's fine.

938
01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.410
So sorrows.

939
01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:29.060
We did a lot since we last talked to these people and they don't even know.

940
01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:32.330
Are you ready for it?
I didn't have a chance to edit it down.

941
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:34.850
I just have some conversation with Charles and Tom.

942
01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:38.660
I've been wanting to hear this for a while cause we had a lot of great talks

943
01:00:38.661 --> 01:00:43.280
while they were here.
A lot of stuff about hemorrhoids and cancer.

944
01:00:43.690 --> 01:00:47.330
Your Dad likes talking about death a lot.
There are a lot of death talk.
It was,

945
01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:51.740
that was fine.
He also,
um,
I had this thing going.
It's people heard it on the,

946
01:00:51.741 --> 01:00:53.000
I don't think you were here for this.

947
01:00:53.001 --> 01:00:57.230
You weren't cause my mom was here where I was like,
let's try to get,

948
01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:02.360
let's talk to dad about you smoking weed whacker out here.
You know,

949
01:01:02.361 --> 01:01:05.700
we have like a little bet going and everything he liked.
He likes,

950
01:01:05.701 --> 01:01:09.920
he's very pro weed.
Your Dad,
very liberal.
So anti.
We'd just so crazy.

951
01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:16.370
Anyways,
I brought that up like immediately with them.
So

952
01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:23.180
can we,
can mom just try a small dose without you getting really upset?
No.
Why?

953
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:27.880
What's the big deal?
It's a big deal.
Why is it a big deal?
It's,

954
01:01:27.881 --> 01:01:31.730
it's embedded in my character,
but it's not a big deal.

955
01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:36.710
It's legal in 10 states.
Yeah,
but it's not illegal.
It's not illegal in Alabama,

956
01:01:36.711 --> 01:01:41.300
Mississippi,
Tennessee.
We're not there.
I know.
It's,
it's,
it's not it.

957
01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:43.350
Let me,
let me tell you one thing.
You don't know where,

958
01:01:43.351 --> 01:01:44.870
but he really just on the whole deal,

959
01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:48.980
even the church has nothing to do with this,
so it's just your kit.

960
01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:52.100
She's playing along right there.
She's fun sometimes.

961
01:01:52.110 --> 01:01:54.560
Your mom is a master liar.

962
01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:57.770
She's a really good to see deceiver an actor.

963
01:01:57.830 --> 01:02:00.950
So what she's doing right then it's being like,
hey man,
like why not?

964
01:02:00.951 --> 01:02:03.170
Because she knows I pulled her aside.
She was like,

965
01:02:03.171 --> 01:02:06.230
it's going to break his heart like he would if I do this bit.
And I was like,

966
01:02:06.231 --> 01:02:08.690
come on,
just fucking do it.

967
01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:12.710
Because she knew that he wouldn't be able to take it.
Yeah.
But you know,

968
01:02:12.711 --> 01:02:15.200
it's an antiquated point of view on it for sure.

969
01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.890
Why don't you cue me from my inside?
They don't.

970
01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:21.030
What if the w what if that were true though?

971
01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:25.040
What's the Charro has a lot of anxiety for people with a don't know.
So it's,

972
01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:28.540
it's a good,
it's a really good lie.
Lots of neuropathy issues.
Yeah,

973
01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:31.770
but what if I said,
mom can take this cookie.

974
01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:34.800
It's very mild dose and it would chill her anxiety.
You'd still be like,

975
01:02:34.801 --> 01:02:37.380
I don't want it.
I don't care.
I'd rather live with the anxiety if she,

976
01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:41.470
if she really wanted to do it and she knows how I feel.
It would.

977
01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:44.890
If I'm asking you if you knew that it could cause us,

978
01:02:44.891 --> 01:02:49.080
can you do a budget deal with the anxiety,
you still would be like,
nope.

979
01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:51.900
I'd rather you take a pharmaceutical drug,

980
01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:56.460
not this drug to deal with the anxiety that I like.
Pharmaceutical drugs.
Okay.

981
01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:58.860
So what I'm saying,
what if it cured the anxiety?

982
01:02:58.910 --> 01:03:01.050
You still would be opposed to it.
Okay.
Well,

983
01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:05.040
I don't have to give that some thought.
It's so annoying to me.

984
01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:09.540
It's so annoying to me that line of thinking that it's okay.

985
01:03:09.541 --> 01:03:13.290
I know we're doing a bit.
Yeah.
But he's like,
yeah,
yeah,
it's okay.
Take this thing.

986
01:03:13.291 --> 01:03:14.124
Not that thing.

987
01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:18.960
<v 3>Well,
I guess because it's regulated by the FDA.
Is that,
is that,</v>

988
01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.360
is that her regulates drugs?
Sorry.
Yeah,
I'm retarded.
Yeah,
I think,
um,

989
01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:27.270
maybe because the government condones those drugs.
He,
he,
you know,

990
01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:31.830
I don't know.
You have to understand too.
He's a Vietnam era guy.

991
01:03:31.831 --> 01:03:35.670
He went to war and I know,
I know.
He doesn't like the hippies.
That didn't

992
01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:38.950
<v 5>do you missed,
you missed it on the last episode.
It's in the audio.</v>

993
01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:41.200
If you watch on youtube,

994
01:03:41.590 --> 01:03:45.730
you should go to the audio version of the previous episode.

995
01:03:46.330 --> 01:03:48.730
Right before Nikki Glaser comes on,

996
01:03:48.790 --> 01:03:53.790
I dropped in dental update with my parents and he told the story about in

997
01:03:54.671 --> 01:03:56.830
Vietnam when the guy tried to sell him weed,

998
01:03:56.831 --> 01:04:00.820
any put an m 16 in his mouth and had his platoon piss on the wheat.

999
01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:02.593
Okay.

1000
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:08.020
<v 3>Right.
See,
I think that marijuana,
Mao marijuana,
marijuana,
marijuana,
cigarette,</v>

1001
01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:12.230
I think that marijuana for him is a loaded social issue.

1002
01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:15.800
He drawings and he does marijuana.

1003
01:04:18.050 --> 01:04:20.770
That is from the deep vaults.
That was a deep cut right there.

1004
01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:25.190
That's from Stevie for those of you don't know.
So,
uh,
but I'm saying,

1005
01:04:25.191 --> 01:04:29.240
I think for him it's not even so much about getting high because he doesn't mind

1006
01:04:29.241 --> 01:04:32.150
when your mother drinks.
He doesn't mind when your mother takes pharmaceuticals.

1007
01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:37.490
It's a social issue.
It's a political issue for him.
Yeah.
And Marijuana.
Cigarette.

1008
01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:41.740
Yeah.
It's just,
it's,
it's Vietnam.
It's,
it's,

1009
01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:44.190
it's where you stand on America for him.

1010
01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:45.290
<v 5>I'm saying logically,</v>

1011
01:04:45.291 --> 01:04:48.920
when you have the conversation with someone and you're like,
this could help.

1012
01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:51.950
It's not that,
but it's this.
And they're like,
well,
can't be that.
Right.

1013
01:04:51.951 --> 01:04:53.120
It's gotta be this,
that helps.

1014
01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:56.960
<v 3>It is annoying.
But he's also of that generation that,
you know,</v>

1015
01:04:56.961 --> 01:05:00.470
reefer madness and that marijuana leads to heroin.

1016
01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:05.000
He's just a different era.
Why is there a buzz in this audio?
I don't know.

1017
01:05:05.001 --> 01:05:09.860
And it also sounds a little like on old mics,
but it's not,
it's,

1018
01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:11.300
uh,
it's not the evening.
Micah.

1019
01:05:11.610 --> 01:05:16.470
<v 5>No,
it's not the eve.
Micah.
Ah,
I'm the Evie.
Micah.
No,
it's good.</v>

1020
01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:17.773
It seems like a,

1021
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:22.900
<v 0>why don't we give out some sorts today and yes.
I don't want it.
The smell of it.</v>

1022
01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:26.590
There's no smell.
All right.

1023
01:05:26.591 --> 01:05:29.830
And we're talking about rolling it up if she wants to do that,
sir.
Business.
Okay.

1024
01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:33.250
And
you know what?
I have to,
how would you,

1025
01:05:33.251 --> 01:05:35.740
like if I tell you something that you want to do it.
I just,

1026
01:05:35.741 --> 01:05:39.850
part of my core character is what?
That I never wanted.

1027
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:44.020
I just ever have endorsed.
That's,
I still think it's a gateway drug.

1028
01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:46.460
<v 3>The buzzing.
It's making me crazy.</v>

1029
01:05:46.770 --> 01:05:50.870
You want to clean it up and then try to clean it up and then try to air it
later.

1030
01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:54.790
I can't do it with the bus.
It's too,
it's too much.
Okay.
Sounds terrible.
Well,

1031
01:05:54.791 --> 01:05:57.620
why don't we press pause.
Yeah,
let's press pause for a second.

1032
01:05:57.621 --> 01:06:01.250
Let me see if there's something I can do here just real quick.
All right.
We um,

1033
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:03.950
try to troubleshoot it a little bit and let's see if there's any better.

1034
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:06.810
<v 0>You wouldn't know.
You're not that kind of person.
You got your,
no,
you're not an,</v>

1035
01:06:07.110 --> 01:06:10.500
you're not an addictive kind of person.
Uh,

1036
01:06:10.530 --> 01:06:14.500
except to I'm addicted to you that day.
The AC,
that was gross.

1037
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.380
I'm addicted to you.
Daddy

1038
01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:21.400
<v 3>called him daddy.
So gross.
Gross.</v>

1039
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:24.370
Do you hear what he said though?
He said it's part of my core character.
Yes.

1040
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:28.150
I know you said it's a gateway drug,
so he still believes that.
Right?

1041
01:06:28.151 --> 01:06:31.270
So that's that generation of like marijuana leads to heroin.
Yeah.

1042
01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:35.410
And it's a character flaw for him.
Cause that's a,
it's a Vietnam thing.

1043
01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.200
Either you went to Vietnam or you smoke dope.
Right.

1044
01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:42.880
That's literally like the hippies and the,
he sees it as being UNAMERICAN.

1045
01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:46.160
It's tantamount to being a fucking dirty hippie.
Who,

1046
01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:51.130
who was a draft dodger and wish he knew how much has children have smoked weed.

1047
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:55.290
Oh he knows,
but no,
but he kind of puts it out of his head.
He knows Maria,

1048
01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:58.450
you know,
she's,
she tells him all the time I've taught.
It's like,

1049
01:06:58.451 --> 01:07:01.610
how can I not done?
Yeah.
Well he knows.
Yeah,
he knows.

1050
01:07:01.610 --> 01:07:05.020
Does he know that you smoked pot,
you think?
Oh yeah.
But I think he did.
He just,

1051
01:07:05.050 --> 01:07:08.140
it's not like an ongoing conversation,
you know,
I don't bring it up.

1052
01:07:08.141 --> 01:07:09.970
It's kind of like I'm,
and I'm by like,

1053
01:07:09.971 --> 01:07:13.390
I don't need to share it with them all the time.
It's thanksgiving.

1054
01:07:13.391 --> 01:07:17.200
But I haven't announced yet.
I gotta tell you,
I wrote a really good joke,

1055
01:07:17.201 --> 01:07:20.980
I think when I was high.
The other like I don't call him and tell him that,

1056
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:23.050
you know?
Yeah,
it's nobody's business.

1057
01:07:23.051 --> 01:07:25.510
I don't know why people needed tell everything to their parents.
I need,

1058
01:07:25.511 --> 01:07:27.190
you just don't,
you know what I find interesting,

1059
01:07:27.191 --> 01:07:31.780
and maybe it's just a flaw in my own family upbringing is like when I'm adult

1060
01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:36.130
children call their moms like on that show below deck when like the 26 year old

1061
01:07:36.131 --> 01:07:39.850
girls crying her mother about her Baba Bass proud.
Yeah.
I'm always like,
wait,

1062
01:07:39.851 --> 01:07:43.330
why are you telling your mom and your problems your fucking 30 they know.

1063
01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:47.890
It's weird.
I've never had a fraud like by Bob.
So dysfunctional.

1064
01:07:48.070 --> 01:07:50.380
Your mom's not your friend.
She's your mom.
You're right.

1065
01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:53.470
So it's about boss that she shouldn't be your best friend.
That's wrong.
Right.

1066
01:07:54.090 --> 01:07:57.150
<v 0>I really think you should try it.
I actually have a bunch in the house.</v>

1067
01:07:57.220 --> 01:08:01.920
I got no go against your firewall.
Okay,
let's see.
Good for a happy marriage.

1068
01:08:03.350 --> 01:08:05.340
Don't do Thompson.
They will upset you.

1069
01:08:05.341 --> 01:08:08.240
What if I put it in your coffee without you knowing that that's a decent idea.

1070
01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:12.240
Not
Taiwan Lloyd.
I don't know what you call it that,

1071
01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:14.720
but why you tell him you should do it?
Well,

1072
01:08:14.721 --> 01:08:19.320
telling him you're already telling him to do Samsung that he's against.
Okay.

1073
01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:23.930
That's another way to do it.
Well,
I really feel like it's a,

1074
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:29.000
it's an opportunity for you to maybe even my anxiety is so bad.

1075
01:08:29.001 --> 01:08:31.600
Limited you how bad it is.
I can't book a cruise.
Yeah.

1076
01:08:31.670 --> 01:08:36.030
And I have to ask at lady to try to get a table for two and I said if he,
uh,

1077
01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:40.070
if I don't get a table for two at dinner as I'm just going to have to go in the

1078
01:08:40.071 --> 01:08:43.820
food court because I suffered from anxiety so I cannot be around people.

1079
01:08:43.821 --> 01:08:47.990
I don't know.
I,
yes,
it's just me.
I know.
And she says,
I miss that.

1080
01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:51.710
I miss might be the solution to it,
but you're not going to,

1081
01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:56.940
I can't find out because of some antiquated builtin view on something.

1082
01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:02.030
You know what,
Tommy put it in his coffee.
No,
God forbid.

1083
01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:06.020
He doesn't know it.
That would be awful now,
but I won't put it in Dad's,

1084
01:09:06.021 --> 01:09:10.790
but it's so mild.
I'm not talking about,
I'm talking about like five milligrams.

1085
01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:15.320
No Smoking.
My eating wasn't there.
My Dad for you.

1086
01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:20.280
<v 5>I did tweet us speaking.
He's say</v>

1087
01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:25.700
<v 0>I do
what it is guessing.</v>

1088
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:29.640
Yeah.
And it candy.
You count.
How many of you here today?

1089
01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:33.260
I mean it just depends on the day.
Anyone everyday.

1090
01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:38.210
Not Everyday to like when we're here we give you inside it Saas,

1091
01:09:38.230 --> 01:09:42.780
marijuana.
You can't handle the foreign oil over.
There you go.
Okay.
Yeah,
exactly.

1092
01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:47.460
Don't worry.
We step much.
Okay,
so the fans,

1093
01:09:47.490 --> 01:09:51.030
I got to tell you last night that was one of the craziest farm.

1094
01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:54.260
<v 5>So I've ever heard and I don't know about us.
Me like that.
No,
no,
no.</v>

1095
01:09:54.261 --> 01:09:57.890
I think we're talking Dennis' book of world record.
Oh my God.

1096
01:09:57.891 --> 01:10:01.850
It was a 15 second far.
It was longer than that.
There's longer.

1097
01:10:02.650 --> 01:10:06.800
I mean I was in the kitchen with her.
Yeah.
So there's a website,

1098
01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:12.220
I think I've told you about this that's dedicated to encouraging you to farm in

1099
01:10:12.951 --> 01:10:16.010
a recording for people to hear and they can of hit me and million dollar.

1100
01:10:16.011 --> 01:10:20.160
Here it is.
No,
that weren't mistress.com.
Please encourage Tom's,

1101
01:10:20.161 --> 01:10:24.980
the girl's mom to become the fart mistress.
And then day,

1102
01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:29.530
I don't,
I don't get out of it.
Now this is the kind of stuff I like this.
Okay,

1103
01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:33.210
now I cannot do marijuana.
But you're going to borrow your word.

1104
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:37.580
Now we get into my day earlier.
Some of them do.
Your town's a girl's mom,

1105
01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:40.510
please become the fart mistress.
Um,

1106
01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:44.660
this message is for the saint that raised the water champion himself,

1107
01:10:44.661 --> 01:10:46.430
Mr Tom here.
So they're calling you a saint.

1108
01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:51.440
You'd only be doing yourself a disservice by not becoming what so many have

1109
01:10:51.441 --> 01:10:52.274
called for.

1110
01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:53.230
<v 0>Okay?</v>

1114

<v 0>Okay.</v>

1115
01:11:05.130 --> 01:11:08.910

My life's goal is to have a constant loop of Tom's mother farting,</v>

1116
01:11:08.911 --> 01:11:12.030
playing on my 70 inch television all day.
Oh my God.

1117
01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:14.130
I planned to mention about does the I want

1119
01:11:18.391 --> 01:11:22.290
100% are from Dan.
100% this is your true calling in life.
I promise.

1120
01:11:22.710 --> 01:11:26.110
I see his mic calling in life.
Truecar

1121
01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:34.440
depart.
Oh my God.
Um,
oh my God,

1122
01:11:34.441 --> 01:11:37.200
I can't believe this is for real.
Here we go.
I am gay,

1123
01:11:37.201 --> 01:11:41.910
transgender male hand that just wants a good old fashioned Latina woman fart and

1124
01:11:41.911 --> 01:11:45.570
where I can shower her with money because she just won't piss on me or beat on

1125
01:11:45.571 --> 01:11:47.420
me.
Go ahead and try it out.
That's from Zack.

1126
01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:53.550
Zack doesn't play that game.
Just got it together.

1127
01:11:56.470 --> 01:12:00.850
But I talking about this.
Yeah,
that Vietnam War on metering.

1128
01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:03.960
Your farts are incredible.
They are incredible.
I know that I didn't care,

1129
01:12:03.961 --> 01:12:06.810
but there's no something that you should be a bit of people fit in.

1130
01:12:06.811 --> 01:12:09.360
Madison told me people,
why did you hear last night?

1131
01:12:09.361 --> 01:12:14.220
Tell me what I heard last night is basically your life is indescribable and
it's,

1132
01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:18.780
it's to the point where I think people go like,
oh yeah,
you know,

1133
01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:22.020
it's a big fart.
I have big for it too.
And I'm like,
you don't understand.
No,

1134
01:12:22.170 --> 01:12:23.400
I mean it literally,

1135
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:27.390
it sounded like like Daytona 500 like engines,

1136
01:12:27.391 --> 01:12:32.290
we're starting different end gentlemen,
start your engines and then it wrapped

1137
01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:37.830
and then I was at least three times last night.

1138
01:12:38.490 --> 01:12:43.490
I thought it was done because you hear it go and it's like almost all back up at

1139
01:12:44.231 --> 01:12:46.460
it.
You know?
It's incredible.
I've done over a million,

1140
01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:49.680
done over a million parts in my life.
I kind of added it up,
you know?

1141
01:12:50.130 --> 01:12:54.360
And I've never had a single one would that kind of,

1142
01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:57.000
I've never had a fart like that either.
I've never had a one.

1143
01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:01.770
I don't think anybody does.
If it's a hurricane to be a category six.
Okay.
Yeah.

1144
01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:07.110
That's great.
When Christina switches,
I should,
getting American got talent.
Yeah.

1145
01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:12.310
And that would be my talent.
So they self esteem is in the field.
Why is your,

1146
01:13:12.450 --> 01:13:15.780
because they only seem to have good as far as any side.

1147
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:20.020
I like to kind of hang my hat on.
Oh,

1148
01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:24.800
this is a screwed up.
But here,

1149
01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:29.220
see if you can hear her.
I don't know what that buzzing is all about.

1150
01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:31.830
It's definitely coming from the recording.
It's sort of,

1151
01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:35.520
you think it's the recording?
Cause we're not hearing it.
No.

1152
01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:40.260
How many did you have?
How many mikes open?
303.
That's so weird.
I Dunno.

1153
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:43.320
Let's see if it dies.
Nope.

1154
01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:48.210
Oh my frigging audio is all screwed up.
See I'm talking about it here.

1155
01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:52.710
Oh,
what's that?
I don't know.

1156
01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:58.410
Is that correct?
Yeah,
that's for real.
Look at her nice looking girl.

1157
01:13:59.670 --> 01:14:03.100
She can burp like that.
It was pretty cool.
They can do that too.

1158
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:04.350
You can do the burps too.

1159
01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:08.730
You know he never burned before and that's what I went to a doctor and I said,

1160
01:14:08.930 --> 01:14:13.800
I am in my,
my belly in it,
but is he here at,
and I said,
baby,

1161
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:16.750
it's the truth.
And the doctor asked me,

1162
01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:21.790
what is the price I'm burning too much and I never bought before because there's

1163
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:25.390
a medical talk for as long as you want.

1164
01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:30.170
I really want to hear the story,
but you having to reach up and pull.
I know.

1165
01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:37.000
<v 5>Now here's the truth guys.</v>

1166
01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:41.500
The mommies is that we really have been sitting on this story,

1167
01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:46.130
so no,
I can't play it.
Oh,
he's not a loud sound.
I know.
I told him,

1168
01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:50.000
I asked him to tell a story and they wouldn't tell the story anyway.

1169
01:14:50.690 --> 01:14:54.550
Can we just say that?
Yeah.
Okay.
Well anyways,
yeah.
He was like,
I can't,

1170
01:14:54.610 --> 01:14:58.960
I can't tell it like she was so against him telling the story.
So

1171
01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:02.270
<v 0>No.
How much people want to hear a story like that?</v>

1172
01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:08.050
As low as you can.
Why would I put them as low?
As low as he gets?
No,
it does.

1173
01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:11.870
It does.
It I go on is mach five parts of marijuana.

1174
01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:19.640
I don't care what I end.
You don't get seen or they leave it.
Oh,
I deleted both.

1175
01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:23.750
Amateur wouldn't do that.
Why wait to discuss it?

1176
01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:27.400
Because it's the fact that she's even here as a victory.
Okay.
It's,
yes,

1177
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:31.340
it's made me sick.
It makes you sick.
Ah.

1178
01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:36.530
Oh God.
I'm going to get that story.
I do have to hear the stories.
Okay.

1179
01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:39.980
I haven't heard the story.
I'll tell you what,
not on the air.

1180
01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.230
Well then can I leave?
I mean,

1181
01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:48.480
I live and they just disgusting and stuff.
I don't want to go get my marijuana.

1182
01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:55.740
I fly in the air partner and talk about your discussing.

1183
01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:05.750
A lot of people have been asking me Christina,

1184
01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:10.010
to eat my scrum and I'm wondering,
did that ever come up in your relationship?

1185
01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:15.170
He Jewish gram,
like if dad was fully showered,

1186
01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:20.120
would you kiss his Boto Ah,
ah.
For me.

1187
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:25.460
How far are you willing discuss?
Oh my God.

1188
01:16:26.810 --> 01:16:29.950
Well,
what's your dad doing it?
This thing?
I've heard that they would do that.
No,

1189
01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.820
never.
Emmett Emmett,
Emmett.

1190
01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:35.090
But what if it was freshly washed and even he was 18 years old.

1191
01:16:35.150 --> 01:16:38.630
It's not just because it's too gross of an area.

1192
01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:42.390
Caca comes from there.
I know,
but it's clean.
Yeah.
I don't care.
Anyway,

1193
01:16:42.391 --> 01:16:43.580
what would I be kissing that?

1194
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.230
Because he wants you to areas in your life that were created for kissing,

1195
01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:52.610
for farthing and pooping.
You want to kiss a day?
That's your choice.

1196
01:16:53.690 --> 01:16:57.560
I wasn't creating would've dad was like,
Hey,
for my retirement party,

1197
01:16:57.561 --> 01:16:59.210
will you do that for me?
Not a chance.

1198
01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:08.220
What about,
he's like,
um,
you know,
it's our anniversary.
Uh,

1199
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:12.810
good for you.
Maybe he can reach his own bod and kiss it.

1200
01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:17.330
Christmas.
Not Creasman.
No retirement.
No anniversary.
No.

1201
01:17:17.331 --> 01:17:22.160
I am dying.
Please before I die.
Give me the no,
no answers.
No,
no,
no,
no,

1202
01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:23.810
no.
He did he ever ask you for it?

1203
01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:28.190
I don't see he will there because I can not there too as marijuana,

1204
01:17:28.191 --> 01:17:32.150
which is nothing disgusting.
Yeah.
Can you wait?
He asking me to kiss that area?

1205
01:17:32.210 --> 01:17:34.530
Well,
you get more into the mic,
so,

1206
01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:39.140
and he doesn't exactly clean very well.
Oh No.

1207
01:17:39.141 --> 01:17:43.650
I got this data here.
I do.
I got to hear the Tommy us at home.

1208
01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:48.170
I use it all the time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I really,

1209
01:17:48.190 --> 01:17:52.700
I think I have like the cleanness butthole on the neighborhood.
Wow.
Well,

1210
01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:57.020
maybe that's my own view.
Okay.
Christina?
She said no,
she won't do it.

1211
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:59.420
Why you're clean.
That's what I said.

1212
01:18:00.810 --> 01:18:05.350
You guys have the most discussing life.
Kiss my butt.

1213
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:10.000
I mean,
what is the point of that?
And I figured it probably,
you know,

1214
01:18:10.190 --> 01:18:14.660
probably it's fun or something.
You know,
if you,
if you have a big poop,

1215
01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:18.620
we do want to take a picture and yes,
put it on TV.
Maybe you'll go get an award.

1216
01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:20.330
I've taken pictures of my poop before.

1217
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:28.200
I've made videos of myself
and people watch it.

1218
01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:32.930
Yeah,
of course.
I've played it on the show for diarrhea,

1219
01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.193
diarrhea,

1220
01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:39.260
I swear I swear because it sounds really crazy.

1221
01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:43.550
What kind of people would like to hear that be sure.
I don't watch it though.

1222
01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:48.650
It wouldn't be fun for,
I think I have a clip of it.

1223
01:18:49.670 --> 01:18:51.680
I don't want to watch your thank you.
Thank you Sarah for that.

1224
01:18:51.681 --> 01:18:56.350
He loved such a fire such as on the Philippines.
You know,
we,

1225
01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:02.480
I told me I got it.
You told me I have to skin it.
Dammit.
I know.

1226
01:19:02.481 --> 01:19:03.710
He told me I can play it.

1227
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:05.223
<v 10>MMM.</v>

1228
01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:10.790
<v 5>Later.
Okay.
So I just have to,
I have to respect that they asked me,</v>

1229
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:15.230
so we'll see what I'm,
let me see where I can,

1230
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:18.710
I haven't probably won't play it pretty much.

1231
01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:20.653
<v 10>Oh Man.</v>

1232
01:19:22.150 --> 01:19:23.110
<v 0>He sits in a chair.</v>

1233
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.980
<v 5>You guys,
but I can't play it.
I know exactly.
Or a hammock.
Huh?</v>

1234
01:19:32.530 --> 01:19:36.040
Is that really what you're talking about?
It's sort of like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1235
01:19:37.450 --> 01:19:38.283
<v 0>Shit,</v>

1236
01:19:41.130 --> 01:19:44.130
<v 5>I have to,
I'm sorry.
I know people are going to be like,
come on,
you're a deck.</v>

1237
01:19:44.131 --> 01:19:46.200
It's like,
look,
I had them in here.

1238
01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:50.490
We talked and then they called me later and said,

1239
01:19:51.390 --> 01:19:55.140
don't play this portion of our conversation.
How can I,
I mean I can't be like,

1240
01:19:55.141 --> 01:19:59.400
well fuck you.
You,
you talk.
I'm telling.
I'm telling it now.

1241
01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:03.480
Shelby County,
Kentucky.
That was another one.

1242
01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:08.370
Ah,
man.

1243
01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:13.470
<v 0>Well,
on this until the jewels.
I was actually at that age.</v>

1244
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:15.783
<v 10>MMM.</v>

1245
01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:20.660
<v 0>They made me laugh so hard though.
I did.
I did.
He did tell me.</v>

1246
01:20:20.661 --> 01:20:22.940
I can play these at a later date.

1247
01:20:23.630 --> 01:20:26.570
These two little parts of it.

1248
01:20:26.571 --> 01:20:29.930
Let's make sure blue band edit some out or are you at at the mountain?
No,

1249
01:20:29.931 --> 01:20:34.160
I just scrolled past the promise to her audience yet later I'm saying,
Oh yeah,

1250
01:20:34.161 --> 01:20:34.911
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
no,

1251
01:20:34.911 --> 01:20:38.720
we have to do it and I'll tell blue band actually have a date that I can play it

1252
01:20:38.721 --> 01:20:43.310
on.
So yeah,
we'll just make a note of love to get you excited.
No,

1253
01:20:43.311 --> 01:20:45.050
nobody got excited with Dan.
It's gross

1254
01:20:48.170 --> 01:20:48.351
now.

1255
01:20:48.351 --> 01:20:53.351
You've never seen anything like that in person accessed hundreds of guys.

1256
01:20:53.991 --> 01:20:58.350
I'm trying to get her all Honda.
So guy,
but she's been hit on.
I have.

1257
01:20:58.630 --> 01:21:00.770
Oh wait a minute.
She didn't tell you this.

1258
01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:05.790
Told me she is down if the hard rock in and form moderate it with Jane Fart.

1259
01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:10.150
Lauterdale just in its theme plane.

1260
01:21:10.890 --> 01:21:12.310
Oh yeah.

1261
01:21:12.510 --> 01:21:16.580
The guy came up and hit me on her getting the what happened 30 years.
Her Junior.

1262
01:21:16.581 --> 01:21:19.220
I know,
I know that one till the day.
Not too long ago.
He gave her,

1263
01:21:19.221 --> 01:21:23.270
he gave her his number two months ago.
I was there.

1264
01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:26.270
I don't clock in the morning and quiet playing.

1265
01:21:26.271 --> 01:21:29.960
I'd always tried to find that long machine it Keith come.

1266
01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:35.090
He's tied by asking me,
can I borrow your lighter,
lighter,

1267
01:21:35.690 --> 01:21:38.850
lighter cigarette?
And he says,
did you mind if I sit next to your machine?

1268
01:21:40.030 --> 01:21:41.530
No machines have free.

1269
01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:46.730
So tell me Keith can be my son.
And he says,

1270
01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:51.810
I'm a Newbie here for a long time.
No,

1271
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:57.240
when did you move tomorrow
as well,
go home.

1272
01:21:57.730 --> 01:22:02.350
I said,
no,
I'm with my husband.
Of course,
if I was sleeping and I said,

1273
01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:05.020
where's your husband?
And says in one of the machines are on there.

1274
01:22:08.230 --> 01:22:12.640
I do happily married.
Same Alley.
And he says,

1275
01:22:13.210 --> 01:22:16.390
well
what is it?
I don't,
but I told her,

1276
01:22:16.391 --> 01:22:20.170
don't tell your husband he's a lucky man.

1277
01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:25.370
The he got a woman let you.
Oh my God.
I said my dad breathing again.
You hear it.

1278
01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:31.960
What if?
What if that guy was like,
I can make you calm like 15 times.

1279
01:22:32.050 --> 01:22:35.170
He may have been,
he might have been like right close to saying that.

1280
01:22:35.171 --> 01:22:37.780
We just will never know,
I guess.
Yeah,
I don't know.

1281
01:22:37.810 --> 01:22:41.410
I don't think she would respond well to that though.
Now I do.

1282
01:22:41.411 --> 01:22:45.100
It would that it can be not only your mind,
but maybe your grandmother.

1283
01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:49.020
And what he told me,
he says each doesn't count when it's a woman.

1284
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:52.360
So that was the nicest compliment.

1285
01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:55.720
She doesn't realize that guy wanted to just take her to pound town.

1286
01:22:56.300 --> 01:23:00.130
I don't get a romantic thing that he was like,

1287
01:23:00.131 --> 01:23:03.190
you're a quite a woman and gross.
He had his,
uh,

1288
01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:06.100
his guilt fantasies going and the guy is a pervert.

1289
01:23:06.490 --> 01:23:09.970
<v 5>Your mom's so sweet.
She doesn't realize that guys are perverts.
Yeah,
totally.</v>

1290
01:23:10.050 --> 01:23:13.890
And dirt bags.
Scum fucks.
That's right.
That's fetishes.

1291
01:23:13.891 --> 01:23:16.840
Like the Guy Shit teddies and my pain.

1292
01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:21.550
You know some old ladies at a machine.
Yeah.
She's not thinking about,
no,
no,
no.

1293
01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:24.360
She's telling you she's happily married and then you're going to,
you know,

1294
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:28.610
say some stuff like that.
Yeah,
come on now.
I wish you had a story like that.

1295
01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:33.110
Then he was like,
you were seeing it.
Big Devil known rap.

1296
01:23:34.290 --> 01:23:35.190
<v 11>And I said,
what do you mind?</v>

1297
01:23:35.191 --> 01:23:39.320
I have to go to you think about getting a separate room with him?
No,
I said,

1298
01:23:39.330 --> 01:23:42.480
do you might have to go with my husband.
Keep us looking for me to cough.

1299
01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:45.150
Scared to that.
You did it,
but he was a nice compliment.

1300
01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:50.700
Yup.
Oops,
so you can get them all up.

1301
01:23:50.810 --> 01:23:53.550
You've got some good ones and we've got some nice ones.
Yeah,

1302
01:23:53.970 --> 01:23:58.080
but it's nice when you have one role and somebody done got really old.

1303
01:23:58.470 --> 01:24:03.470
No one was 90 but 90 according to your fire.

1304
01:24:03.871 --> 01:24:07.740
The way she talks to me.
You gave me a g and a half less.
No,
I said,

1305
01:24:07.741 --> 01:24:11.310
please at least live another year and a half.
No,
no,
not the one and a half.

1306
01:24:11.311 --> 01:24:14.310
I don't care,
but you have to make it agenda.
Well,
I just have these,

1307
01:24:14.311 --> 01:24:18.870
these bits in my new hours hiking in six months.
Don't die in six months.

1308
01:24:18.871 --> 01:24:23.871
I don't screw everything up and then he realized that there are two

1309
01:24:23.911 --> 01:24:26.600
possibilities.
Anyway,
Jane would move and take care of him,

1310
01:24:27.290 --> 01:24:30.660
organize his life or he will move here because you want to leave him alone.

1311
01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:35.160
She's phase when it is.
That's right.
It was almost like,

1312
01:24:35.550 --> 01:24:40.300
what am I doing alone to,
oh,
he'll be so hilarious.
I'd want to see you dad.

1313
01:24:40.301 --> 01:24:43.950
But to see dad being like,
I got a date Sunday.

1314
01:24:45.570 --> 01:24:49.350
Yeah.
I,
she can wait for that in excel.
Oh,

1315
01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:54.600
she's mine is,
yes.
These are very a at in the Bates.
Wow.
But I don't see,

1316
01:24:54.601 --> 01:24:59.430
he would go in those pages.
No websites,
no date.
That damn I started at,
no,
no,

1317
01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:02.810
no.
What would he do?
She probably got to it.
I Dunno.

1318
01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:06.560
He walk around and he sees a woman.
He would try to type,

1319
01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:10.500
I think you got to try.
But he's a good flirt there.
Yeah.

1320
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.670
And I have no idea how to flirt.
Do you think he's a good floater?
No.

1321
01:25:14.671 --> 01:25:17.700
He's a horrible,
but he sees you as well,
right?
That's true.

1322
01:25:18.850 --> 01:25:22.500
<v 5>You remember,
uh,
the bank teller?
A bank teller and also,
yeah.</v>

1323
01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:23.930
Do you prefer sweet nurse?

1324
01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:31.650
Your Dad?
He did a seminar flirting on this show.

1325
01:25:31.651 --> 01:25:36.120
I wish I knew the episode number cause I'd like to bring it back.
Yeah,

1326
01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:39.960
right.
Got Him.
I was like,
so how did he,
he goes into the whole bag.

1327
01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:44.140
He brings up the bank teller here in a moment.
But he,
I said like what?

1328
01:25:44.190 --> 01:25:47.010
Some of these guys,
I got a lot of guys listened to our show and he was like,

1329
01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:52.290
you know when you're getting coffee,
just yes.
And do you prefer,

1330
01:25:55.900 --> 01:26:00.580
do you prefer a sweetener,
Wanda?
Yeah.

1331
01:26:00.690 --> 01:26:03.990
It was like what?
He's like,
yeah,
you

1332
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:05.900
<v 3>got to get the conversation going.
So</v>

1333
01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:11.480
that's your dad's big icebreaker.
SPLENDA.

1334
01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:19.400
I can't imagine your dad talking to women.
It's like the grossest,
most foreign.

1335
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:24.080
I've seen him do like Dad Boehner flirts before,
which is like,
you know,

1336
01:26:24.610 --> 01:26:28.820
it's harmless stuff.
Waitresses there again.
Hello?

1337
01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:35.210
No,
it does like a little bit cutesy comment where you're like,
okay,

1338
01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:41.030
you seem like everyone's dad.
Every dad does it.
It's a dads.

1339
01:26:41.031 --> 01:26:44.900
Do they just flirt with waitresses and stuff for sure.
But he's so,

1340
01:26:44.901 --> 01:26:49.430
he's just such a dad.
I can't see him.
Especially if it's a waitress.
They know.
Oh,

1341
01:26:49.490 --> 01:26:54.440
I know Carol.
I know she likes me second.

1342
01:26:54.441 --> 01:26:59.390
The lemon water.
Yeah.
I know.
You like your room and he's like,

1343
01:26:59.391 --> 01:27:03.500
you know a lot,
right?
He,
she has extra tip.
Yeah.

1344
01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:07.880
So gross.
I got to be,
I didn't,
I can't tell him what to tell the whole thing,

1345
01:27:07.881 --> 01:27:11.360
but in this movie that I was shooting,

1346
01:27:11.361 --> 01:27:16.040
the reason that this episode is delayed,
I got to be a real creep.

1347
01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:20.930
Yeah,
exactly.
You're casting.
What is up with that?
No,
it's not.

1348
01:27:21.290 --> 01:27:25.880
No.
I told you this a long time ago that you're going to start getting roles when

1349
01:27:25.881 --> 01:27:30.650
they're piece of shit guy roles and look at your big first movie with Mark

1350
01:27:30.650 --> 01:27:32.510
Wahlberg,
your big movie that's coming.
You saw the screening.

1351
01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:35.910
We didn't see the amazing,
it's so amazing.
I can't wait for it to come out.
Yeah,

1352
01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:37.870
it's a great movie.
It's so good Tom.
Um,

1353
01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:43.310
but that you're going to start getting stuff when you play a piece of shit and

1354
01:27:43.311 --> 01:27:47.810
Lo and behold,
your first huge role is a piece of shit.
Brother-In-Law character.

1355
01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:50.390
And then yesterday,
a piece of shit,

1356
01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:53.180
a real piece of shit scum bag who gets killed.

1357
01:27:53.450 --> 01:27:56.570
And I'm kind of a pos and Steve Burns movie too,
right?
There you go.

1358
01:27:56.571 --> 01:28:00.770
That's your casting.
Yeah.
It's interesting cause you're not a piece of shit.

1359
01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:04.800
No in real life.
But you like to play one on TV?
Yeah.

1360
01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:08.570
It's like your murder thing too.
It was just your alter ego.

1361
01:28:08.571 --> 01:28:12.050
I guess this one is a real piece of,
it's also because you're an,

1362
01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:15.620
you don't really have a good personality.
It's kind of like backed.

1363
01:28:15.621 --> 01:28:19.220
It's full circle the personality champ thing,
which I am.

1364
01:28:19.221 --> 01:28:22.280
And you're not because you're not,
you're not,

1365
01:28:22.281 --> 01:28:26.840
you don't put it out there like likable vibes.
No,
I'm serious.
Like look at that.

1366
01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:30.630
But you know,
your whole standup persona.
I was like,
I gotta be honest in,

1367
01:28:30.890 --> 01:28:35.310
in public.
I think you have a very standoffish person.

1368
01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:39.950
Yes.
Me,
you are always like,
I don't want to be bothered.

1369
01:28:39.951 --> 01:28:43.610
I don't want to be told this and not looking for talk about what the guy's

1370
01:28:43.611 --> 01:28:47.840
asking me that like you're very stand offish.
Yeah,
yeah.

1371
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:50.450
Seriously.
But then behind closed doors,

1372
01:28:50.451 --> 01:28:54.050
I'm warmer than you are behind closed doors.
You're warmer.

1373
01:28:54.230 --> 01:28:59.130
But to the general public,
I don't find you the picture.
I'm polite to uh,

1374
01:28:59.160 --> 01:28:59.570
you know,

1375
01:28:59.570 --> 01:29:04.570
restaurant people to Valet people and bringing you're that you're not friendly.

1376
01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:09.090
No,
I'm not looking to make friends out in the world,

1377
01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:13.650
but that's because I grew up in a big city where there's psychos on every

1378
01:29:13.651 --> 01:29:16.380
fucking corner and if you,
if you're nice to everybody,

1379
01:29:16.381 --> 01:29:19.080
then the next thing you know,
some nutbag is in your world.

1380
01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:23.970
It comes off that you have neuropathy problems.
How long have you,

1381
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:28.510
how many strokes does it take your dad?
He would answer if you asked them.

1382
01:29:29.410 --> 01:29:33.510
That's the weird thing.
Uh,
your dad really would date quickly,
I think if,

1383
01:29:33.570 --> 01:29:36.420
if she dies first,
let's hear what he has to say.
Yeah.

1384
01:29:36.550 --> 01:29:41.330
<v 11>If you're going to do it.
My coach here?
Yeah.</v>

1385
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:46.170
Gotcha.
You're a good floater.
I am.
My flirting consist and don't do anything.

1386
01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:50.380
Yeah.
She plays the game I have in my life.

1387
01:29:50.830 --> 01:29:55.480
There is no way who can ever say that I fled or tried to get him and then what I

1388
01:29:55.481 --> 01:29:59.170
liked him the most.
He's going to see my face.
How's that working out?

1389
01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:03.720
Oh boy did I get mad.
My,
my expertise was bank tellers.
Okay.

1390
01:30:03.730 --> 01:30:08.730
So I would fight with bank tellers and then I would take a deposit slip and ask

1391
01:30:09.461 --> 01:30:13.400
them if they want to go out to lunch.
Really.
They just love that you have a good,

1392
01:30:13.420 --> 01:30:18.070
he has a lunch and,
and uh,
you just write that on there.

1393
01:30:18.630 --> 01:30:21.970
Well,
I,
I would tie my deposit to get the right bank teller.
Okay.

1394
01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:26.040
This is when they used to have lots of bank tellers know a lot of,

1395
01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:31.000
it's like two months ago.
And so I would say,
I would say it's still does it,

1396
01:30:31.001 --> 01:30:32.480
you know,
talk to him,
this and that.

1397
01:30:32.481 --> 01:30:36.010
And then I said I can even wear that red dress anymore.
So when they,

1398
01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:38.320
when you come in on your next deposit day,

1399
01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:42.150
if they had the dress on that you asked about [inaudible] it's a good sight.

1400
01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:45.970
Bingo.
That means you're still using this tactic today.

1401
01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:52.120
Two banks.
It does.
He does.
She has like six different banks.

1402
01:30:52.170 --> 01:30:56.020
And then I would like,
maybe I'm going to a bank and then to either he does,

1403
01:30:56.021 --> 01:30:59.080
he just goes and flirts.
Yeah.
It's sort of works and keeps going.

1404
01:30:59.170 --> 01:31:01.970
And then what did they say?
Y'All have lunch,
he think he goes to lunch with him.

1405
01:31:02.050 --> 01:31:05.820
Of course.
I looked in the lunch with him and of course she goes down to them.

1406
01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:08.820
But I did when I was single,
excuse me.

1407
01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:13.510
He when he was married and married and remarried and we kids what dates with

1408
01:31:13.511 --> 01:31:17.220
bank tellers but I yes,
he went to lunches and drive to go further.

1409
01:31:17.230 --> 01:31:21.920
It didn't work out.
Yes.
All that,
all that,

1410
01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:26.730
all that he has ended this.
Oh shit almost.

1411
01:31:27.930 --> 01:31:28.763
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1412
01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:34.790
So he's telling you that he's timing his bank goings with the bank tellers but

1413
01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:38.730
you know what,
you stand in line and there's like let's say five bank tellers.

1414
01:31:39.090 --> 01:31:42.030
You can't really time that.
Like it's random shuffle.

1415
01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:47.700
I think he's also talking about though like 30 years ago were maybe you would,

1416
01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:49.850
I don't know,
it just seems like maybe,

1417
01:31:50.910 --> 01:31:54.080
maybe you line up for a specific tellering yeah.

1418
01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:56.370
Cause now a funnel you into one line.
Yeah.

1419
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:59.590
You can't control it unless you're like do go a front of me.

1420
01:31:59.591 --> 01:32:02.080
I want to get that chick.
He was doing that.
That's weird.

1421
01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:06.130
I love when she plays this.
Um,
this is like,
one of her persona is,
is like,

1422
01:32:06.190 --> 01:32:09.930
it's like a foe jealous wife.
Yeah.
Where she's like,
he does it today.

1423
01:32:09.931 --> 01:32:13.570
He takes you all the time then.
Yeah.
Well,
she sells it believable.

1424
01:32:13.690 --> 01:32:16.090
Remember you bought me a perfume ones that you smelled on,

1425
01:32:16.091 --> 01:32:17.980
some slight you worked with.
There it is.

1426
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.370
You know that I worked with her again.
No after that.
No.
Yeah,

1427
01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:28.150
but I told her the whole story.
Yeah.
She laughed.
She love it.
She can't,
I go,
uh,

1428
01:32:28.270 --> 01:32:32.350
I go,
I bought this.
And I go,
I said,
oh.
I said,
you know,

1429
01:32:32.890 --> 01:32:33.970
last time I saw you,

1430
01:32:34.210 --> 01:32:36.430
I asked you about that for a few and I bought it from my wife.
She loves it.

1431
01:32:36.630 --> 01:32:38.890
And she's like,
oh,
great.
And then I remembered it.
I go,
oh,

1432
01:32:39.930 --> 01:32:43.570
she asked me how I found it and I told her it was somebody I worked with and she

1433
01:32:43.571 --> 01:32:45.670
said,
uh,
oh,
some fucking whore.

1434
01:32:48.250 --> 01:32:51.160
You fucking slut whore that you have a crush on.
Yeah.
I have to tell you,

1435
01:32:51.161 --> 01:32:53.350
it is my favorite smell in the whole world.

1436
01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:57.520
And I'm so upset that you smelled it on some woman that you wanted to bang and

1437
01:32:57.521 --> 01:32:59.860
then you got it for me.
Soap setting.
She was pretty cute.

1438
01:33:00.190 --> 01:33:02.260
So let's see what else he says here.

1439
01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:07.020
<v 11>Um,
wait,
what about the baby?
No,
what about the baby?</v>

1440
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:10.580
We're cutting on chicken.
Christina.
Not sure baby's coming too late.

1441
01:33:12.150 --> 01:33:16.770
Maybe it's coming into the 800% babies come in tomorrow.
It's Today on a bet.

1442
01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:21.060
Yes.
Maybe he's coming today.
The baby times of day.

1443
01:33:21.061 --> 01:33:24.240
You can have your marijuana fingers really with the baby.

1444
01:33:24.241 --> 01:33:29.000
Come to witnesses after the baby comes today.
Okay.
Happiness.
No,

1445
01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:33.570
go ahead.
Yeah,
don't be like,
oh I'll,
I'll succeed.
I lost the bed.
Okay,
okay.

1446
01:33:34.050 --> 01:33:37.770
Okay.
And then you won't give her a hard time about it and be like,

1447
01:33:37.771 --> 01:33:39.480
oh I don't do that.
I don't do that.
I know.

1448
01:33:39.481 --> 01:33:42.270
I'm just making sure I want to make it real clear.
This is witnesses here.

1449
01:33:42.271 --> 01:33:45.620
You're not going to guilt trip it cause no one wants to enjoy something found by

1450
01:33:45.630 --> 01:33:49.860
a great no,
no.
Guilt trip.
I'm a mom would never do that.
Ever.
Never.
Yeah.

1451
01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:51.850
It's not new.
They don't know how to do that.
Yeah.

1452
01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:55.100
<v 3>Can I pause for a second?
You know,</v>

1453
01:33:55.101 --> 01:33:59.630
apropos our discussion earlier about fighting.
I think too,

1454
01:33:59.750 --> 01:34:04.670
a big part of keeping the peace in a marriage or a longterm relationship is once

1455
01:34:04.671 --> 01:34:07.850
you fight over something,
it's gone.
It's out.

1456
01:34:08.210 --> 01:34:12.020
And don't bring it up again and again,
like with my or that time.
You fucking,

1457
01:34:13.450 --> 01:34:17.960
yeah.
Like let it go and do not bring it up.
It was a good boy ever again.
It's,

1458
01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:21.270
it's done.
A lot of people don't do that.
A lot of people,
I mean,
yeah,
right.

1459
01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:24.050
Throw it,
throw it in the spouse's face.
Well,

1460
01:34:24.051 --> 01:34:28.610
I fucking time you came home at three in the morning and union.
Yeah.

1461
01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:30.080
You're over it just for,
if not,

1462
01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:33.770
it's like if you're with somebody that has to bring up the thing over and over,

1463
01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:36.080
you can't be with that person.
No,
that's a bummer.
Yeah.

1464
01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:39.410
I want to be reminded of their shortcomings all the time.
No,
it's no good.

1465
01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:44.010
<v 11>It's not my fault.
Yeah.
So yeah.
Oh my God.</v>

1466
01:34:44.011 --> 01:34:47.760
You got Hours,
11 hours and stuff.
He's of minutes

1467
01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:52.510
<v 3>bad.
I wanted her to win the bet.
No,
I knew it wasn't going to count.</v>

1468
01:34:52.511 --> 01:34:55.100
What was the date?
Do you remember when you recorded?
No,
I'm just,

1469
01:34:55.101 --> 01:34:58.180
I just knew that it was mid afternoon.
I was like,
it's not Kuwait.

1470
01:34:58.190 --> 01:35:02.150
July 19th I started being induced,
so then July 20th he was born.
Right,

1471
01:35:02.151 --> 01:35:06.530
so this must've been days.
Couple days before.
Yeah.

1472
01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:10.100
I know.
I should have spoken up and been like,
no,
no,
mom,
what's your bet?

1473
01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:14.330
It's what's your bet?
Yeah.
She was also like,
I know.
I know he's today.
Well,

1474
01:35:14.331 --> 01:35:18.350
I kept having contractions and then they'd stop.
Julian did not want to get out.

1475
01:35:19.210 --> 01:35:21.370
<v 11>Yeah.
All right.
Let's talk about these before we go.</v>

1476
01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:24.700
Retirement's around the corner.
Oh God.

1477
01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:28.060
What are you guys going to do when you were home all day?
Every day.

1478
01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:32.650
This is going to be scary.
He's Bitchez.

1479
01:35:33.250 --> 01:35:37.960
Oh my Chi with the chess games.
Because time to make more messes and yeah,

1480
01:35:38.210 --> 01:35:42.910
totally close around the flow.
Hey,
call on baby.
Open the IPAD.
No.

1481
01:35:42.911 --> 01:35:47.260
Actually what I discovered this is that,

1482
01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:52.600
you know,
when I go to work every day,
I would change my underwear,
change things.

1483
01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:55.510
Now,
if I'm not going to go to work,

1484
01:35:55.511 --> 01:35:59.200
I could wear like the same thing for four or five days in a row.

1485
01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:03.420
The same pants,
same shirt.
Yeah,
same.
I didn't know it seems I'm there under,

1486
01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:05.590
I just turn around,
just turn it,
turn it.

1487
01:36:06.010 --> 01:36:08.360
He went into cruise with one pair of sound.

1488
01:36:10.510 --> 01:36:14.710
Are you doing I accident turned me underwear around so you know,

1489
01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:19.900
I do as you can as a truth.
And you do the socks,
you do the inside out.

1490
01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:23.040
No,
no,
no.
It's,

1491
01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:26.560
I call it living deficiently.
No,

1492
01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:29.170
that's pretty gnarly discussing it.

1493
01:36:29.171 --> 01:36:30.970
But what are you gonna do with him and run the household day?

1494
01:36:31.180 --> 01:36:35.230
I realize right now that when I was shooting that scene,
rouse a creeper,

1495
01:36:35.650 --> 01:36:38.980
I basically did a,
an impression of my dad as the guy.

1496
01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:43.440
You know what I mean?
I came up behind the girl and I was like,
Whoa,

1497
01:36:44.850 --> 01:36:48.180
<v 3>the bank teller joyful,
she may get it.
Where that Red Dressy</v>

1498
01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:54.950
you prefer sweetened hers.
Oh God.
It's so great.
And,
and the,

1499
01:36:54.990 --> 01:36:58.500
the vag that like your mother says as the female

1500
01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:04.770
and the relationship,
you can kind of govern that kind of shit with your spouse.

1501
01:37:05.130 --> 01:37:05.581
Do you know what I mean?

1502
01:37:05.581 --> 01:37:09.540
Like if you were in the habit of turning your boxer shorts the other way around.

1503
01:37:09.630 --> 01:37:12.150
Yeah.
And I'd be like,
booboo,
please don't do that.

1504
01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:17.450
I think she knows it's that battle that she cannot win.
You know,

1505
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:20.010
all she has to do is provide the clean panties.

1506
01:37:20.011 --> 01:37:22.020
Like just make sure he's got a fresh supply.

1507
01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:24.870
Like I would make sure that your drawer was stocked,
that,

1508
01:37:24.871 --> 01:37:28.230
that that doesn't happen and it's so fucking,
yeah,

1509
01:37:28.750 --> 01:37:31.310
<v 11>you went to find it.
Hobby for him and it doesn't come out.</v>

1510
01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:36.890
I don't know where we're going to do what his dream is to drive around the

1511
01:37:36.891 --> 01:37:40.460
country.
I see places,
you said another one.
Oh my God.

1512
01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:45.520
My Dad pitch to my mom that in retirement hurts 74 year old ass could sit in the

1513
01:37:48.771 --> 01:37:52.490
car with him and drive across America.
And by the way,

1514
01:37:52.491 --> 01:37:56.010
it doesn't like driving more now that he's in his seventies,
like,
you

1515
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:57.120
<v 3>know,
four or five hours.</v>

1516
01:37:57.121 --> 01:38:02.121
So they would spend a few days getting out of the state and then every,

1517
01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:05.730
every few days they would still be in the same state.

1518
01:38:05.731 --> 01:38:08.820
Just sleeping at hotels or red roof inn.
Yeah.

1519
01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:13.890
Eating and diners and essentially being like a road comic,
like a feature acts.

1520
01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:18.060
I can't,
I can't,
it's horrible life.
I've done it before.
Yeah.

1521
01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:21.570
I mean imagine being 74.
It's not for them.

1522
01:38:22.030 --> 01:38:24.900
And I referred him and that's how much he doesn't know it.

1523
01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:28.710
Like he does not for him.
Gagging on the road.
Remember when I used them?
Yeah.

1524
01:38:28.750 --> 01:38:31.650
It shows and you're like,
I'm gigging.
I'm gigging and gigging,
Bro.
It's the same.

1525
01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:36.690
Triple can again,
fighting crime.
I used to Gig like that.
It was terrible.

1526
01:38:36.970 --> 01:38:39.950
Terrible.
I drove up and down Florida,
uh,
the,

1527
01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:44.910
the Pacific northwest fucking,
you know,
hey,
let's be honest,

1528
01:38:44.930 --> 01:38:45.810
the America,

1529
01:38:46.290 --> 01:38:50.640
there's a few nice things to see and also a lot of boring shit.

1530
01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:53.250
There's not a lot.
Yeah.
I mean,
I understand.

1531
01:38:53.251 --> 01:38:58.050
If you haven't seen the Pacific northwest.
Beautiful.
Yeah.

1532
01:38:58.051 --> 01:39:01.800
A couple of the,
you know,
national monuments.

1533
01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:07.110
That mean it's cool to see.
Dce is cool to see.

1534
01:39:07.650 --> 01:39:09.900
I like some parts of the south are beautiful.

1535
01:39:09.901 --> 01:39:13.650
Some parts of the northeast are beautiful to coast.
I mean,
but not,

1536
01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:16.260
there's a lot of in between that you're like,
the fuck are we seeing here?

1537
01:39:16.290 --> 01:39:18.420
That's what I'm saying a lot of just like,
okay,

1538
01:39:18.450 --> 01:39:22.040
there's a fucking east to west drive a few times.
Yeah.

1539
01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:25.710
The California most of his dog shit.
Dog Shit.
Yeah.
Well,

1540
01:39:25.711 --> 01:39:28.950
I mean you're driving through states where there's just,
there's nothing to see.

1541
01:39:28.951 --> 01:39:33.390
It's just,
it's highway.
Highway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And malls.

1542
01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:36.060
God Damn West Texas.

1543
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:40.440
I know I have 500 miles stretches and just,

1544
01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:45.860
you know,
a couple of gas stations.
Don't forget,
not even lights,
not freeways.

1545
01:39:45.861 --> 01:39:47.310
You just pitch,
pitch black.

1546
01:39:47.311 --> 01:39:50.370
Don't forget the firework stores and the antique stores.
That's it.

1547
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:54.600
And then like porno shops.
Yeah.
Well I guess there some cool stuff,

1548
01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:57.960
but a lot of bullshit.
No,
sounds terrible.

1549
01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.420
<v 11>Well,
I'm thinking I let him go and piss off and go on his own.
Yeah.</v>

1550
01:40:01.421 --> 01:40:04.770
So you stop at a bunch of banks and try to meet stopping every bank.

1551
01:40:05.820 --> 01:40:10.800
A lot of banks.
The trouble is with bank tellers is it's a process.
She,

1552
01:40:11.110 --> 01:40:15.340
you don't really get a date on the first deposit repeat.
Oh yeah.

1553
01:40:15.890 --> 01:40:18.780
And I mean he change banks if that one doesn't work.
Yeah.

1554
01:40:18.910 --> 01:40:20.000
I took my account from there.

1555
01:40:20.010 --> 01:40:25.010
He says I took a day 10 defending it comes 10 banks and he had to go to a bank

1556
01:40:25.301 --> 01:40:29.020
to put some money.
I had to go to a bank to the president.
The person for them,

1557
01:40:29.021 --> 01:40:30.730
it is floating assistant program.

1558
01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:34.090
But once you retire he's going to have plenty of times.
That is true.

1559
01:40:34.091 --> 01:40:35.680
You will have a son by then he woke up money.

1560
01:40:35.681 --> 01:40:36.710
So I don't know where they post them.

1561
01:40:36.710 --> 01:40:41.710
So the other thing is I'm not going to do is any form of manual labor around the

1562
01:40:42.521 --> 01:40:46.150
house.
Like people that do gardening and bakery.

1563
01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:50.740
I know that Amazon it anyway.
Well that's,
I'm not going to get into it.
Okay.

1564
01:40:51.110 --> 01:40:54.820
[inaudible] team.
I mean I'll do,
is anything you uh,

1565
01:40:55.180 --> 01:40:58.820
well I like shooting guns.
You know,

1566
01:40:59.350 --> 01:41:04.110
I think that I like,
uh,
Bob Clay,
patient shooting,
target shooting.

1567
01:41:04.490 --> 01:41:05.770
Um,

1568
01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:11.080
I don't have the patience for fishing because I throw the thing over and then

1569
01:41:11.081 --> 01:41:15.910
you have to wait for the fish question today.
Everybody throws it back,
you know?

1570
01:41:16.140 --> 01:41:20.950
Yeah.
As a kid we used to actually eat them,
but I,
I do it.
I,
I,

1571
01:41:20.970 --> 01:41:25.060
I'm not in,
so I'm not into fishing.
Um,
not,
uh,
not really.

1572
01:41:25.210 --> 01:41:28.210
My favorite thing is to take things back like it bed,

1573
01:41:28.211 --> 01:41:30.970
bath from the I and the places that they can find out where she likes,

1574
01:41:30.971 --> 01:41:33.610
she buys stuff and then she takes it back.
But,
uh,

1575
01:41:33.670 --> 01:41:37.250
any other interests besides guns?
I've heard you say guns like five times.
Yeah,

1576
01:41:37.930 --> 01:41:41.050
I liked cars.
I've always liked cars,
you know,

1577
01:41:41.051 --> 01:41:44.650
but the trouble is with cars is,
is as much as I liked cars,

1578
01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:50.440
there's so many limitations on where can I go?
140.
You know,

1579
01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:53.500
there's tracks so you can find a track.
Do I have to ask you a question?

1580
01:41:53.770 --> 01:41:57.490
Because I want witnesses in this question,
then it makes sense.
She has.

1581
01:41:57.491 --> 01:41:59.950
She's got to pick up maybe 10 minutes.

1582
01:41:59.951 --> 01:42:03.300
He remind me of Christina's guy that is going to go the value labels.

1583
01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:06.080
<v 3>Alright.
This is boring now.
Yeah.
All right.
I'm basically,</v>

1584
01:42:06.081 --> 01:42:09.590
your dad wants to go back to Vietnam.
He's like,

1585
01:42:09.591 --> 01:42:13.670
that's the only fun I had was shooting guns.
Shooting guns,
baby killing people.

1586
01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:16.880
Hiding in the jungle.
Wearing dirty underwear.
Yeah.

1587
01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:21.860
Wearing no socks with my boots so I don't get trench foot.
Pretty Nice,
Huh?
Yeah.

1588
01:42:21.861 --> 01:42:25.790
What uh,
what,
uh,
oh man.
What are we going to do?
One more of that age.

1589
01:42:26.150 --> 01:42:30.920
I don't know.
Yeah,
I kind of like it.
This sounds totally,
I dunno,

1590
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:32.810
depressing or whatever,

1591
01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:37.760
but I feel like I don't have many interests anymore.
Like I like five.

1592
01:42:37.761 --> 01:42:42.470
I like a few things.
I like my family.
I like comedy.
I like stupid TV shows.

1593
01:42:42.471 --> 01:42:46.370
Yeah.
Like it gets narrower the older you get.
Maybe you just does.
It also gets,

1594
01:42:46.371 --> 01:42:51.371
it's also narrower because you don't realize how much of a quote hobby having

1595
01:42:54.561 --> 01:42:57.590
children.
Seriously.
It's true.

1596
01:42:58.100 --> 01:42:59.980
It's such a time consumer.
Yeah.

1597
01:43:00.050 --> 01:43:04.710
That you're not thinking of because it's an automated kind of responsibilities.

1598
01:43:04.730 --> 01:43:07.330
Are sure that you're like,
oh,
what do I do with my free time thing?

1599
01:43:07.370 --> 01:43:11.210
You don't have enough free time.
Yeah.
So you have your work,
you know,

1600
01:43:11.211 --> 01:43:15.740
this is also your work,
but it's fun.
But it's your job getting on a stage.

1601
01:43:15.741 --> 01:43:20.330
That's your job.
Yeah.
Your family,
you have 26 minutes late.

1602
01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:24.390
That's true.
It's like you're just responsible all the time.
But think,

1603
01:43:24.410 --> 01:43:25.610
I think the older they get,

1604
01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.660
you probably get into more things you'd like when they're toddlers and stuff and

1605
01:43:29.661 --> 01:43:33.020
the infants.
Yeah.
It takes up every spare moment.
Yeah.
You know,

1606
01:43:33.021 --> 01:43:36.320
we have like that two hour window at night maybe that we can watch some

1607
01:43:36.321 --> 01:43:39.780
television together and that's about it.
Yeah,
that's true.
Well,

1608
01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:41.990
I'm the same way I was thinking of,
I mean,
I've said it like I,

1609
01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:46.220
I like going to these workouts.
I do like cars.
I've always liked cars.

1610
01:43:47.180 --> 01:43:49.970
Other than that,
I mean,
what would I have time for?
I know.

1611
01:43:49.971 --> 01:43:52.820
And here's the weird thing is when you and I didn't have children,

1612
01:43:53.420 --> 01:43:55.350
we didn't do a whole lot.
Yeah.

1613
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:58.640
We watched a lot more television actually around a lot more.

1614
01:43:59.870 --> 01:44:04.640
We didn't have hobbies then either we just watched more shit.
No,

1615
01:44:04.641 --> 01:44:08.180
it's like,
you know,
getting on stage.
I'm a movie star,
I do my podcasts,

1616
01:44:08.181 --> 01:44:12.530
I do all these things.
All the ones he mentioning that movie star part.

1617
01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:15.060
<v 5>Well speaking as a movie star,</v>

1618
01:44:15.061 --> 01:44:20.061
I'll tell you that it is a demanding lifestyle.

1619
01:44:21.450 --> 01:44:26.010
It is,
it is.
Learn your lines.
Stand here.

1620
01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:29.190
Say it again.
Sign this autograph,

1621
01:44:29.370 --> 01:44:34.310
do the press this blow job.
It just happens.

1622
01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:35.180
Go with it.

1623
01:44:35.180 --> 01:44:39.350
<v 3>The territory we were talking about it cause you did kind of like your own</v>

1624
01:44:39.351 --> 01:44:43.640
stunts for this film.
How rigorous that really is.

1625
01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:46.930
<v 5>So in this movie I can tell you I don't want to,
like I said,</v>

1626
01:44:46.931 --> 01:44:51.130
I don't want to give away any major plot points.
No,
I really don't like,

1627
01:44:51.131 --> 01:44:53.950
I mean I that's out of respect for the filmmaker and like,

1628
01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:58.510
but I can say that there's a fight sequence.

1629
01:44:58.690 --> 01:45:02.650
Holy Shit.
My appreciation for like when you,

1630
01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:07.930
if you've shot a scene like the one I did and then you watch,
you know,

1631
01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:12.610
one of the Bourne movies or John Wick or this new apparently or any of them.

1632
01:45:12.611 --> 01:45:14.440
But the new mission impossible I heard is great.

1633
01:45:14.441 --> 01:45:18.940
And you see what Tom Cruise does.
You really appreciate the physicality of it.

1634
01:45:18.970 --> 01:45:23.970
I mean I was fucking wrecked after filming a pretend fight scene.

1635
01:45:25.330 --> 01:45:28.570
<v 3>Right?
Cause you're doing it multiple times.
It's hot outside.</v>

1636
01:45:28.571 --> 01:45:33.250
You're up early or they're having a real struggle and a real,
you know,

1637
01:45:33.540 --> 01:45:36.670
fall.
It's dude,
it this exhaust.

1638
01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:41.460
It does not give you such an appreciation for like the Tom Cruise.
No,

1639
01:45:41.470 --> 01:45:44.500
but I'm saying like let's break it down.
Like how old does that fucker now

1640
01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:49.640
<v 5>that dude has to be,
and by the way they played a trailer,
um,
like,</v>

1641
01:45:49.641 --> 01:45:53.510
cause they're promoting the new one of what he did in this movie.

1642
01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:55.790
You would shit your pants.
Let me,

1643
01:45:56.190 --> 01:45:59.640
<v 3>it's like mission impossible 10 by now.
Like the fast and furious there.</v>

1644
01:45:59.641 --> 01:46:02.700
Just keep,
they keep making,
it's always the same shit.

1645
01:46:02.730 --> 01:46:05.000
It's the same shit different day.
I still love him though.
I'll watch the shit.

1646
01:46:05.010 --> 01:46:06.270
It's just supposed to be the best.

1647
01:46:06.330 --> 01:46:10.350
People are saying that this is the the best one.
I love them all.

1648
01:46:10.351 --> 01:46:15.020
I love those mission impossible movies.
I can well,
even hand,

1649
01:46:15.030 --> 01:46:18.510
I'm your best friend.
Mark Wahlberg.
I mean that guy role.
He just,

1650
01:46:18.511 --> 01:46:21.030
he did an action film before he did your movie.

1651
01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:24.900
So Mark Walberg has to stay in amazing shape and that guy is,

1652
01:46:24.930 --> 01:46:27.960
I see them on Instagram.
He's up at three 30 in the morning working out.

1653
01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:29.743
He looks at grace.

1654
01:46:29.850 --> 01:46:32.610
<v 5>Look at this from this new,
the new mission.
Impossible.</v>

1655
01:46:32.970 --> 01:46:35.430
Look at what Tom Cruise did.
Hold on.

1656
01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:39.910
Why is it not playing them Stan's

1657
01:46:39.930 --> 01:46:43.550
<v 3>ever.
It's not just one.
Look what he does.</v>

1658
01:46:43.610 --> 01:46:46.340
I didn't think he could have beat in the last student,
but he did

1659
01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:50.010
shit.
Long line

1660
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:53.400
<v 9>drop and Tom loved so crazy.
So you could do that on a green screen.</v>

1661
01:46:53.401 --> 01:46:56.290
But of course mission impossible fashion.
We flew in,
drop Tom Cruise,

1662
01:46:57.070 --> 01:47:00.090
helicopter real helio chapter.
My hands were numb.

1663
01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:04.380
I have to try to climb as fast as I can up that rope and then some free fall to

1664
01:47:04.381 --> 01:47:05.790
the bag.
That's crazy.

1665
01:47:05.850 --> 01:47:09.810
Refall to the bag from the rope Tom Dangling from this helicopter.

1666
01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:15.300
That's crazy.
Tom Bell.
I actually thought he fell there.
Have myself scream.

1667
01:47:15.570 --> 01:47:20.490
We heard on the radio.
I think we just lost Tom.
How you doing?

1668
01:47:23.190 --> 01:47:25.820
Well,
this is great promotion for the movie.
Look what else you do.

1669
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:28.260
Helicopter a helicopter.
Yeah.

1670
01:47:28.261 --> 01:47:30.980
Tom Did all the fight and I had a cocktail for real,
some fluid.

1671
01:47:30.990 --> 01:47:33.390
She was this crazy three six to downward spiral.

1672
01:47:33.630 --> 01:47:38.130
Most politics wouldn't attempt this spiral.
It looks like this by the crack.

1673
01:47:42.750 --> 01:47:44.480
See?
Awesome.
Paris was nerve wracking.

1674
01:47:45.230 --> 01:47:50.230
You did this crazy nut told was riding a motorbike helmet is traffic safety rate

1675
01:47:51.141 --> 01:47:54.440
for this one challenging shot.
That rig just didn't work.

1676
01:47:56.370 --> 01:48:00.900
And we looked to Tom and said,
what are we going to do?
And he said,
my friends,

1677
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:04.800
we gotta,
we gotta go,
we gotta shoot,
speak.
He got on his bike and yeah,
to

1678
01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:10.510
Tom Riding a motorcycle and catch traffic around the October.
Yeah.

1679
01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:13.800
I don't know if that's smart.
Okay.
All right,
well listen,

1680
01:48:13.801 --> 01:48:17.430
there's limitations here.
Talk,
chase.
No,
this thing,
it's crazy.

1681
01:48:17.431 --> 01:48:20.360
One building to another while with his boss.
Crazy.

1682
01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:23.760
He's the real shot with the Bra right there.

1683
01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:25.620
It's one of those things.

1684
01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:29.520
I'm supposed to have that level of impact hitting the wall.
I just put my foot.

1685
01:48:29.521 --> 01:48:32.910
How tried to soften the impact?
I knew instantly it was broken.

1686
01:48:33.860 --> 01:48:35.100
They kept it in the movie and look,

1687
01:48:35.690 --> 01:48:39.510
I have to finish this because we're not coming back and pulled himself up to get

1688
01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:43.970
the shot.
So wait,
do they don't have a safety net for him on those drugs?

1689
01:48:43.971 --> 01:48:48.710
I had a job for real.
I can do this.
I can watch the shit.
He did the solo opening.

1690
01:48:48.740 --> 01:48:49.410
Okay.
He

1691
01:48:49.410 --> 01:48:52.170
<v 3>did a solo parachute jump to,</v>

1692
01:48:52.230 --> 01:48:54.600
I mean like there's no need to do all of this.

1693
01:48:54.690 --> 01:48:56.580
I don't know why he feels compelled.

1694
01:48:56.610 --> 01:48:59.100
There's guys that are professionals that can do that.
Yeah,

1695
01:48:59.101 --> 01:49:02.130
but they're not Tom cruise man.
I get,
he has to do it all,

1696
01:49:02.210 --> 01:49:06.090
but he know why that 56 56 doing this shit.
I see.

1697
01:49:06.810 --> 01:49:09.270
I do pull out these twice a week.
I'm 42 I'm wrecked,

1698
01:49:09.810 --> 01:49:13.980
wrecked after an hour potties.
This Guy Tom Cruise loot dude,

1699
01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:18.030
I guess.
But then there's also like,
Bro,
do you really,
you got to break your foot.

1700
01:49:18.330 --> 01:49:21.530
You really going to find out you don't have candy.
All that Shit,
you know?

1701
01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:24.240
I'm not impressed.
I mean come on,
I'm,
I am impressed,

1702
01:49:24.241 --> 01:49:26.790
but I also think it's really stupid that he's doing that.

1703
01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:32.070
He wants to entertain you.
He's the ultimate entertainer.

1704
01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:35.250
I don't just mean you're not going to do that.
The stunt coordinator,

1705
01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:41.080
he's worked in movies for 40 years with everyone and uh,

1706
01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:43.890
he told me some stories I can't tell,
but he also told me,

1707
01:49:43.891 --> 01:49:47.980
he said he gets asked sometimes cause some of the actors,
you know,
do

1708
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:49.840
<v 5>certain stunts and not,
and I said,</v>

1709
01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:54.250
is there any actor who could definitely,
if it wasn't an actor,

1710
01:49:54.251 --> 01:49:57.640
just be a fulltime stunt guy.
And he was like,
definitely Tom Cruise.
Yeah,

1711
01:49:57.970 --> 01:50:01.000
he did great.
He did a couple with him and he's like,
yeah,
he's,
he's a real deal.

1712
01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:05.140
It's crazy.
That's Jackie Chan too.
Did he do it?
Yeah,
he does those,

1713
01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:08.690
<v 3>I think it's not his whole thing.
He started in,
I think he's wreck now.</v>

1714
01:50:08.691 --> 01:50:11.990
He can't walk or oh,
that's,
yeah,
it says it's not worth it guys.

1715
01:50:12.650 --> 01:50:15.950
Don't do your own stunts.
All right.
Anything else Jean?
No,

1716
01:50:15.951 --> 01:50:20.540
I'm just glad we're back in the action.
I'm back in this chair.
I missed the show.

1717
01:50:20.541 --> 01:50:21.650
I missed you guys.

1718
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:26.450
And I'm so happy to be back and not be enormously pregnant and out of breath all

1719
01:50:26.451 --> 01:50:30.170
the time and,
and grumpy all the time.
I was still a little grumpy but

1720
01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:36.030
<v 5>normal level.
Yeah.
You have a very few neuropathy issues and that's it.</v>

1721
01:50:36.670 --> 01:50:39.150
Um,
but I'm happy to be back doing the show.

1722
01:50:39.151 --> 01:50:43.190

It is.

1723

1737

Could you let me come to your home?
