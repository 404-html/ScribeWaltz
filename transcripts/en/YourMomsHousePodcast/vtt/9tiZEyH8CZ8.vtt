WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.560
Yeah.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.290
<v 1>Well,
well,
well go to your mom's house,</v>

3
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.383
Christina.

4
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.230
<v 0>All right,
Jean,
we're back.
Oh,
we're,</v>

5
00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:25.130
we're recording now.
We're recording.
Yeah.

6
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.470
It's exciting.
Yeah.
I like your shirt.
You're very fancy today.
Yeah.
Well you,

7
00:00:32.471 --> 00:00:36.190
you usually dress like a slob and so I'm dressed like a slob.

8
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.710
Hoping that you'd be dressed like a slob.
Why do you say that?

9
00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:39.310
I don't dress like us,

10
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.190
but you've got a nice shirt on it now I feel like I look like a dick.

11
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.300
Then you look all nice.
I feel like you always want your deck.
Me?
Yeah.
Really?

12
00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:50.470
But that's only because I'm trying to match your low level of attire.
That's the,

13
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.130
I really addressed that for.
Yeah.
I was just remembering one time you did,

14
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.970
we did this episode and you were wearing your underwear and we were recording

15
00:00:57.971 --> 00:01:02.110
video.
Yeah.
But you couldn't see it hotter.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I could see it.

16
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.990
I bet anchors do that.
You know,
on TV.
I think they do.

17
00:01:04.991 --> 00:01:07.870
I think I'm seeing something where a guy stood up and it was like denim wearing

18
00:01:07.871 --> 00:01:12.340
shorts or something.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No shoes.
No shoes.
Yeah.

19
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.150
Farts.
They don't care.
It's a desk show.
You're at the desk cares.

20
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.370
Are we going to do dates at the top?
We already did them,
Babe.
Oh we did?
Yeah.

21
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.880
Sorry.
Yeah.
I like when you get mad at me like God stupid.
No,

22
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.410
it's a stupid question,
right when I hear you.
We already did it,
Babe.
Like you,

23
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.610
I feel like you're going to hit me or Ah,

24
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.510
God gave me how much do you hate me and my fantasies?

25
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.760
How much do you hate me when I fucking fantasy?

26
00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:39.160
When I get something wrong like that?
What does it do to you?

27
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.380
It upsets me on a fucking,
just at my core.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why?

28
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.760
Cause it's such a dumb question
because it was,

29
00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:52.510
it was a silly question to ask.
Dumb.
Dumb.
Yeah.
Stupid.

30
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.070
And then in your head,
do you,

31
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.460
are you like so stupid bitch or is that just my,
you know,

32
00:01:58.461 --> 00:01:59.890
that's your internal dialogue.

33
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.610
You always kind of make up insults that aren't I do.

34
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.250
I always assume when I upset you that you were like,

35
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:09.190
you stupid fucking dumped that.
I never say that.
And you,
what do you say that,

36
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.500
but what do you say?
It has to be some variant of that guy's a still,

37
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.440
she's so stupid.
I was single.

38
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.090
Wish I was on Tinder.
Like dig.
Does it go there?
No,

39
00:02:22.091 --> 00:02:25.670
it's not.
It's not that,
it's not that.
It's just,
you know,
uh,

40
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.880
I wonder how much longer she'll live.
Stuff like that.
Yeah.

41
00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:32.740
Like do you fantasize about the psych at wife for just being single?
Second.

42
00:02:32.741 --> 00:02:37.030
Third,
yeah.
All of them.
Would you remarry?
No.
No.
Why?

43
00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:39.190
Why go through this again?
I don't want to do this again.

44
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.070
Would you have a second family?
That's the craziest part.
When people do that.

45
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.810
Yeah,
I would,
you have more babies with another woman in another state,

46
00:02:49.811 --> 00:02:53.290
so they don't like run into each other.
Yeah.
And then when you're on,
you're like,

47
00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:56.230
I'm doing no one of them.
Right.
Do you tell her?
I think I can tell no one.

48
00:02:56.231 --> 00:02:59.110
Because you're like,
I'm going to have no idea.
Right.
I'm going to Denver again.

49
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.860
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

50
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.210
You have to open up that second company in Denver and you're always in Denver

51
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.540
every other week,
every other weekend.
Or maybe you become a truck driver.

52
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.650
That's kind of the easiest way to do truck driver.
Yeah.

53
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.250
<v 2>Until that trucking company,
he's like,
you got a new route.</v>

54
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.640
You got to go every week to San Francisco,
and you're like,
oh,

55
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.160
but then you start a third family,
I guess.
Yeah.

56
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.300
You gotta be real tight with money.
Oh my gosh.

57
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.220
Two families to support or,
and then if you get up to three,
that's bananas.

58
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.630
Yeah.
That's too hard.
And they're always like,
damn.
Yeah,
you travel a lot.

59
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:35.290
And a guy I know.
Yeah.
Yup.
That's how it goes.

60
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.170
I know.
Well,
let's start the show.
Okay,
let's do it,
man.
Let's go.
Ready?
Yeah.

61
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.410
And Jake,
go

62
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.460
<v 3>touching on the water
in the water.</v>

63
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.610
This is the Orange County sheriff's department.
Be advised.

64
00:03:50.611 --> 00:03:54.050
State parks is asking us to make an announcement to let you know you were paddle

65
00:03:54.051 --> 00:03:57.780
boarding decks to approximately 15 great white sharks.

66
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.910
They're advising that you exit the water and a calm manner.

67
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.180
Sure.
The sharks are as close as the surf line.

68
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.230
Thank you for your cooperation.
Randy.

69
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.200
Don't bring anyone loving to this.

70
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.120
<v 1>Well,
welcome to your mom's house,</v>

71
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.163
Christina.

72
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.960
So ridiculous.
You're

73
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.750
<v 0>turning into such an angry dad.
What's so funny?</v>

74
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.490
Like this morning Ellis was splashing water outside of the sink because he plays

75
00:05:13.491 --> 00:05:16.730
in the sink and then he likes to do this thing where he splashes outside because

76
00:05:16.731 --> 00:05:20.290
then we get mad and then we pull them out.
Like it's a game we all play now.
Yeah.

77
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.460
And he spilled water like he does every time.
And you're like God damn and Ellis.

78
00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.100
Yeah.
Dammit.
What did I tell you about the water?
Leave subspecies scare him.

79
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.980
I was like,
oh,
that's such a dad mode.
Like you went to full dad mode on him.

80
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.430
Well yeah.
I mean he was spilling a lot of water.
Come a got,
damn it.

81
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.670
I have a feeling I'm going to be a lot of God damn it.
Oh,

82
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.680
the kids are going to hear that all the time.
Yeah.
Yeah.

83
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.260
That's what dads do though.
They just show their rage.
You gotta be angry.
Someone

84
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.260
where do you get a lot of pent up anger and then it comes out?
Yeah.

85
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.340
It's little things like this,
Huh?
Yeah.
It's all like for you,

86
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:03.720
but then it comes out to other things.
I figured,
I figured

87
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.740
like you don't want to,

88
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.680
we don't want to confront whatever annoys you in the moment.

89
00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:13.010
And then it stores it and stores that was doors up and then you get mad at the

90
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:17.550
kids filling water.
Right.
Or like Christina had forgot that we did the dates.

91
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.570
All righty.
Oh,
so angry.

92
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.290
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
this is terrifying.

93
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.640
We saw this clip and I,
I've swam in those waters.

94
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:36.080
I think I learned to surf longs waters.
Yeah.
And the crazy,

95
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.840
the Orange County sheriff's department.
Oh my God.

96
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.800
Imagine your paddle boarding out there.
No,
they fly over first.

97
00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:47.000
You notice them hovering over it.
Maybe somebody who's in trouble out here,

98
00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:49.700
and then they go,
hey,
you don't be alarmed.

99
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.920
There's this great white sharks calmly take yourself to the,

100
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.960
to the shore.
How did that guy even cut,

101
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.030
contain his emotions enough to be that calm?
The guy saying it.

102
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.600
He kind of laughed.
I thought at one point she's like,
ah,
I hear a little,

103
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.630
there's a little pitch change where he says calm manner and it sounds like he's

104
00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:15.560
almost laughing cause he knows,
oh my God,
look at the fucking size of that.

105
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.000
Keen of them dude

106
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.980
<v 3>asking us to make an announcement to let you know you were paddle boarding next</v>

107
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.620
to approximately 15 great white sharks.

108
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.780
They're advising that you exit the water right here.
Listen.
And a calm manner.

109
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:36.763
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

110
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:42.970
<v 3>Thank you for your cooperation,</v>

111
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:43.611
<v 0>man.</v>

112
00:07:43.611 --> 00:07:48.611
If I heard that shit and why is it a water be paddling fast as fuck?

113
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.110
<v 3>No,
it's heavily populated.</v>

114
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.960
Great White Sharks.

115
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.050
Please do not get to the water.
Fuck

116
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:05.683
<v 0>me.</v>

117
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:10.460
How about you guys drop a line down and pluck that person out of the water like

118
00:08:10.461 --> 00:08:11.810
you're in the fucking,
they do that.

119
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:15.040
That's how they rescue people drowning or far out you.

120
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:19.180
They just drop a line down and then the lifeguard jumps out and gets you out.

121
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.640
I'd say,
let's do that instead of the announcement over and over.

122
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:27.550
Let's take decisive action.
No,
I when I was on road rules,

123
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.550
nope.
No,
I trained when I trained,

124
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.760
I trained with the Australian Coast Guard.
I did,
um,
um,
uh,

125
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:38.540
Bondai beach and they taught us how to do that.
That was one of the missions.

126
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:42.410
How you,
you get lowered by the rope and then you pluck the person out.

127
00:08:42.411 --> 00:08:45.530
So what's your theory on why they didn't do that?
I don't know.
Laziness.

128
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.080
You think they're just being lazy?
Yeah.

129
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.810
I think they wanted a cool video to submit to youtube.
Get those hits.

130
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.000
I don't know.
You know,
that's not true.
Who knows?
You

131
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.690
<v 2>know,
it's not true.
It's not.
Yeah.
That would be terrifying though.
Oh my God.</v>

132
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.890
Great.
Why egg whites?
Whites right there too.
Yeah.

133
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:09.720
Fuck man.
Fuck.
It's nuts.
There's a lot of them.
God,

134
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.960
there's got to be nothing fucking scarier.
I mean,

135
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:17.940
I think if I heard that announcement like as soon as he fucking started that

136
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:19.740
announcement,
the first moment

137
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.630
<v 3>touching on the water,
the water,</v>

138
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.360
this is the Orange County sheriff's department be advised,

139
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.220
state parks is asking us to make an announcement to liquor paddleboarding next

140
00:09:31.221 --> 00:09:33.690
to approximately 15 great white shark,

141
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.960
great white sharks that you exit the water and a calm manner

142
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.060
<v 2>and then just pools of diarrhea coming out the back of my shorts.
No.</v>

143
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.610
Do you think that would attract the sharks to problem or repelled for panel?

144
00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.530
The show,
the shit.
There'd be a new,
it's just a new tastes.

145
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:54.300
New Smell to them and they don't fucking,
yeah.
Plus what you eat.

146
00:09:54.301 --> 00:09:56.910
It's all ground up in and out Burger and what?

147
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.240
Whatever trash you've been eating on the run late and trash.

148
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.030
Although I did have horrible meals and Eugene.
Yeah,

149
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:06.800
I heard that's what I'm saying.
Yeah.
Sickle cell and I went up to um,

150
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.640
Eugene and back to Portland,

151
00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:12.990
Oregon and Portland shows were really fun,
man.

152
00:10:12.991 --> 00:10:17.280
We could not get a good meal.
It's so weird.
I hate that we went to Eugene.

153
00:10:17.281 --> 00:10:19.440
We went,
I don't want to trash the places,
you know,

154
00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:24.441
because it's like they weren't like egregiously trying to ruin our time.

155
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.940
Yeah.
He just wasn't good.
We went to a place for lingerie,

156
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.440
like this is fucking dog shit.
What did you order?
Well,
he had,

157
00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:35.790
he had a shrimp cocktail and there was salad shrimp.
Ah,

158
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:40.260
the ones that are not,
I would say one quarter of one inch.

159
00:10:40.261 --> 00:10:44.460
You know those melons?
Yeah.
And then he ordered some oysters for us.

160
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:49.110
The Louise.
Hey,
where did you guys go with it?
And I want to say no.
It was a nice,

161
00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:51.870
it was there.
They were like,
it's a good restaurant and it was fucking terrible.

162
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.120
Okay.
Then we went to,
uh,

163
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.890
I forget another place after show.
It was all right.

164
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:03.550
And then we,
uh,
breakfast the next morning at the hotel.
I interject.

165
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:07.680
It was no fucking up.
Breakfast is hard.
It sucks.
Yeah.

166
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:11.250
Then we went to Portland and we did have something good.
You know,

167
00:11:11.251 --> 00:11:14.800
you can always get something good in Portland,
Oregon,
Portland,
amaze for eating.

168
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:18.960
Where do we go?
We've got it.
Meet.
Rattle.
Yeah.
Such good food.

169
00:11:18.961 --> 00:11:20.700
And meat rattled too.
Yeah.
We were like,
this is,

170
00:11:20.701 --> 00:11:24.600
this is our first good meal was in Portland.
It's terrible.

171
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:27.290
There's nothing worse than bad road food.

172
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.200
Cause then with the road food comes to road shifts.
Oh.

173
00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:34.990
So then you asshole hurts everything.
So hungry and miserable.
Tired as fuck.

174
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.200
But thanks everybody that came out.
That was crazy.

175
00:11:37.201 --> 00:11:41.730
I ended up doing four shows at revolution hall.
Right.
Yeah.
It's amazing.

176
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.400
Thank you everybody.
Yeah.
Lots of genes there.
Um,

177
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.310
I wanted to point out that um,

178
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.660
you and Ryan are both in a special category now.
Yeah.

179
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.120
You're both no longer regular people

180
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.990
<v 0>shoes.
No,
I uh,
since I had a child,
my back's messed up,</v>

181
00:11:58.991 --> 00:12:00.550
my feet messed up.

182
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:05.320
I have SCIATICA and I started to wear orthopedic shoes.

183
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.350
Yeah.
Now not all of them look good.

184
00:12:08.351 --> 00:12:12.820
There's a brand called Vionic that I've been into and they make really good

185
00:12:12.821 --> 00:12:17.350
looking orthopedic shoes.
And I said this is an unpaid sponsor.

186
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.910
Yeah,
it is.
Yeah.
Cause if you,
if you have Sciatica,

187
00:12:21.911 --> 00:12:24.940
give like spinal misalignments or whatever,

188
00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:27.460
I have one leg shorter than the other.
It's been that way my whole life.

189
00:12:27.461 --> 00:12:30.790
But for some reasons that I had a kid,
my hips got all messed up and everything.

190
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:34.740
So it's gotten bad.
Here's what a,
yeah,
that's sickle cell wore these,

191
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:39.750
I have the same ones but slip on the single dad or support sevens.

192
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.590
Those are good balance.
And he said they come in four colors only.
Yeah.

193
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:49.570
It's like these all maroon.
Yeah.
Uh,
I think beige and one other,

194
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:53.530
but he said they completely changed the way his,
his back and felt,

195
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:59.400
cause I'll get women's shoes are horribly unsupportive if not damaging to our

196
00:12:59.681 --> 00:13:04.270
feet.
The ballet flats or can't even do it.
Balances.
By the way.
I have those.

197
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:09.340
I have those exact except slip on from when I was preggers.
It's terrible.

198
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.440
I put these
new ones,
those look orthopedic too.

199
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.740
Some people really like them.
Some people fucking hated them.

200
00:13:17.741 --> 00:13:19.540
I couldn't believe how many people,
everyone's an asshole.

201
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.860
Why those for bicycling?
No,
no they're not.
It's for bicycling.

202
00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:28.330
They're not,
are they for running?
Are a specific sport?
No,
no.

203
00:13:28.331 --> 00:13:32.230
They're just total like a,
what do they call,
you know,
social shoes?

204
00:13:32.231 --> 00:13:36.080
Like they're just walking around shoes.
They're not the streetwear.
Yeah.

205
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:37.061
But a man,

206
00:13:37.061 --> 00:13:41.710
they got a lot of people like a look at this terrible,

207
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.620
um,
them shits is due to

208
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.020
someone called these dad shoes.
These are like,
yeah,

209
00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:54.850
this super exclusive undefeated Collabo with Adidas and they're like,

210
00:13:54.851 --> 00:13:56.170
dad,
she was like,
we talked about,

211
00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.880
can I tell you there's a fine line between cool sneakers and then too much going

212
00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:05.230
on to make them look supportive and then that's where it goes into a dad
sneaker.

213
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.360
Why,
why they're saying that?

214
00:14:07.361 --> 00:14:11.340
This is just my theory is when you've got a lot of different hooks and things

215
00:14:11.341 --> 00:14:15.140
and sure it when it starts to look like a hiking shoe.
I see what you're saying.

216
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:19.180
Bicycle shoe.
Yeah.
Been see it that way it loses,

217
00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.610
it's cool cause I still think there are,

218
00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:23.950
I think this is a bunch of nerds on my fucking Instagram.

219
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:28.300
I have no style whatsoever.
I don't know.
I kind of agree with,
I'm sorry.

220
00:14:28.301 --> 00:14:33.220
I think those are a little dad support.
Yeah,
really.
I Dunno.
I think,

221
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.160
yeah,
I think there's a bunch of tools.
A picture of my shoes,

222
00:14:36.161 --> 00:14:40.180
my new orthopedics and we'll see who like who they like better.

223
00:14:40.181 --> 00:14:44.570
I'm clearly the shoe champion if send it.
You did send in those uh,

224
00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.180
sent back those terrible ones,
right?

225
00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:51.260
Well cause I ordered them and I got four pairs and I try them on for you because

226
00:14:51.261 --> 00:14:54.560
look,
let's keep it real.
You're the one that looks at me all the time.

227
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:55.880
I'm going to want to look decent.
Yeah.

228
00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.560
So you okayed two of them and then two,
you were like,

229
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:05.270
no.
Did I have shut down too?
I thought I shut this.
Sorry.
You shut down one pair.

230
00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.290
The other one didn't.
They're too big.
They were hot pink.

231
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:15.290
Slip on sneaks with like a strap,
like a Mary Jane Strap on top.

232
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.090
And you did not like that.
Look,
what would,

233
00:15:17.091 --> 00:15:20.270
what about that shoe were you not interested in a photo of them so he could

234
00:15:20.271 --> 00:15:24.710
really break it down?
You can Google it and bionic slip ons.

235
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.950
Hot Pink,
v I.
O.
N.
I.

236
00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:32.900
C bionic slip on women's sneaker pink.
Hot Pink.
Try that one.

237
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:38.380
Okay.
Now they also make a cool ass live ons.

238
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:43.330
I got a gray pair,
like suede looking.
Those are dope.
And then I want to,
yeah,

239
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:48.290
those are,
yeah,
that's it.
See,
I just don't feel like they were that bad.

240
00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:54.080
These are like,
you know,
this reminds me of um,
uh,

241
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.430
um,
somewhere in Europe and then some,
a 78 year old,

242
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.940
a American woman who's on a,
it was with a tour group.
[inaudible].

243
00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.550
She's like,
I haven't been back here in 50 years.

244
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:10.730
And she walks around the corner wearing these and I'm like,
oh,

245
00:16:10.731 --> 00:16:14.750
that's nice old lady sneakers you got on.
Yeah,
because she's like,

246
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.870
if I didn't have him,
I'd just collapsed to the ground in pain.

247
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.550
Is She wearing khaki?
Cool.
Lots.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No,
these are terrible.

248
00:16:22.551 --> 00:16:24.950
I thought those were cute.
Now try the blue color.

249
00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:28.490
Do you like the blue ones better?
Is it not a color thing?
Oh,
it's not a color.

250
00:16:28.491 --> 00:16:32.480
It's the style.
Black as fuck old lady style.
Yeah.

251
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:35.980
But I need sneakers that are,
have art that have arch support.

252
00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:39.530
Tom's got a cube hunting,
but right now I have,
I have the new balance ones.
The,

253
00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.860
they're identical to what?
Sickle cell.
Where's,
I'm not even joking.

254
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.650
Those are terrible.
You should see them when he had jeans on.

255
00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:48.880
We gotta get him some bionics.
I know.

256
00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.670
And telling you it's all about that arch support.
Yeah.

257
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:57.580
Because my feet will hurt if I just wear regular flats.
Can't do it.
Yeah.

258
00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:02.240
Forget it.
It's crazy.
It's part of aging,
you know.
I know.
So your fetal hurt.

259
00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:07.010
My feet will hurt my back.
Sadeka it all flares up.
It's really bad.

260
00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.720
Yeah.
That's the fun of being 40.
Yeah.

261
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:15.850
So we also went on a mommy's night out at TMN total mom night.

262
00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:20.300
We spent the night in a hotel like we do once a month.
Yup.

263
00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:25.400
And we ate a lot of bad food.
Don't tell our trainer.
No,
don't tell her.

264
00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:30.800
And we also relax in bed.
We watched a shitty movie.

265
00:17:30.801 --> 00:17:34.850
Then we watch things stupid.
Yeah,
it was,
it started that,
um,
what's a great actor?

266
00:17:34.851 --> 00:17:39.470
He was on breaking bad.
The young kid on the,
I don't know his name,
Blake.

267
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.750
Blake lively.
Blake lively,

268
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:46.880
the guy from breaking bad and it was a cool premise,

269
00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:50.620
but it just went to shit.
So many movies just go to shit man.

270
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.960
They just shit the fucking bed.
And um,
this one did too.

271
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:58.470
The premise was that his girlfriend just disappeared.

272
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.930
Like they were together for four years and then one day she disappears.

273
00:18:00.931 --> 00:18:03.450
So what happens to her?
And then he starts looking for,

274
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.120
and you're not going to like all the answers you get,
that kind of thing.

275
00:18:06.121 --> 00:18:08.490
So you're start,
you get involved and you get invested,

276
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:13.890
but the reveals or are just stupid in the end was kind of lame,

277
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:18.750
super lame.
Super.
Then I also,
you know what disappointed is not,

278
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:21.960
I mean you can say that this is a sexist I guess,

279
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:26.790
but I don't buy her being what they said she was.

280
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.820
In other words,
it's not that I don't believe any woman could do that.

281
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.140
I don't believe that actress,
is that,
do you understand what I'm saying?

282
00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.840
I understand what you're saying.
Like she's not,
it's not believed.

283
00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.600
It wasn't tough enough.
In a weird,
she wasn't,
come on,

284
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:44.250
she was just like a cute blonde.
She wasn't like a tough,
tough blonde.
I mean,

285
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:46.620
yeah,
it's completely unbelievable.

286
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:53.070
What about a lady doctor?
Do you buy that?
It depends.
Where is she from?

287
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:58.500
Right.
What about like a lady scientist?
Is that totally ridiculous too?
Yeah.

288
00:18:58.501 --> 00:19:03.120
Like a not attractive one.
Sure.
Like Grey's anatomy with,
what's her name?

289
00:19:03.121 --> 00:19:04.680
The blonde actress?
I Dunno.

290
00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:09.540
Heigel Katherine Heigl scientists that she was a doctor.
No,

291
00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.040
of course not.
No.
No.

292
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:14.730
What should she be to 25 to two 40.

293
00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:17.910
Why large is that you're saying now?

294
00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:21.450
Why should she be occupation wise?

295
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:24.990
What Katherine Heigl that you would believe that she,

296
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:30.010
what she does for a living in a movie?
I'm saying,
Oh,
I'm drinker.
Yes.
Oh No,

297
00:19:30.011 --> 00:19:33.720
that's disgusting.
Real estate real estate secretary,

298
00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:37.570
secretary.
That's not for hot checks anymore.
Oh,

299
00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.500
it's not my 50 flight attendant.
Um,

300
00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:45.330
but gate agent,
gate agent at the airport?

301
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:50.010
No.
What could she be?
I mean,
I'm a,

302
00:19:50.011 --> 00:19:53.870
I'm of the school of thought that she could be a scientist,
a doctor or a lawyer.

303
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.030
No two attractive care.
Yeah.
Okay.

304
00:19:57.031 --> 00:20:01.740
So your theory is that attractive people don't go into professions either.

305
00:20:01.741 --> 00:20:03.240
Gender.
Really,
that's not true.

306
00:20:03.241 --> 00:20:07.650
We have attractive people that we professionally deal with.

307
00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.490
Don't get us into trouble now.
Okay.
No,
we don't.
Okay.

308
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:18.150
We have really good looking,
uh,
professionals that we deal with now.
Come on now.

309
00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:22.440
Okay.
You know,
that's not true.
I mean,
I'm not saying there's not any out there,

310
00:20:22.441 --> 00:20:25.230
but that's for the most part,
you know,
uglier.

311
00:20:25.231 --> 00:20:30.150
People have to strive to make a name for themselves.
They have to work in life.

312
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:34.950
So I feel like you usually see ugly looking people in.
Move on.

313
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:39.900
Let's go on to other topics,
but I'm totally right about that.
I don't know.

314
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.510
No,
I do know.
It's not like a,

315
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:47.100
it's not like you don't see supermodels at the hospital.
No.
You don't see many,

316
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.890
uh,
doctors.
That's true.
Now Watch,

317
00:20:50.891 --> 00:20:53.860
we're going to get a bunch of emails from people who are like,
I was a model of,

318
00:20:53.861 --> 00:20:58.000
no,
I'm a scientist feeling kind of damage to send pictures.
Right.

319
00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:02.980
I a borderline model,
Lachlan.
Marginally attractive.

320
00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.030
Our a plus size model pig.
Yeah,
yeah.

321
00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:10.590
With your big old dirty fucking ditch hanging down donkey tits went,
Oh,

322
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:11.740
speaking of movies.

323
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:18.630
So we also were trying to keep the family tradition going in our,

324
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:23.560
our night a away of ordering an adult film and the hotel,
well,

325
00:21:23.561 --> 00:21:26.650
let's just to say it's a tradition that started,

326
00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.110
we didn't start the fire,

327
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:33.520
but it started on us and the Dominican Republic when we stayed at a resort that

328
00:21:33.521 --> 00:21:37.990
played hardcore pornography on our television and it was like,

329
00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:42.790
wow,
does everybody get this in their room?
No,
no.
Cause we asked,

330
00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:47.820
it was just us and we watched a lot of hardcore stuff that week in Dr and then

331
00:21:49.871 --> 00:21:54.640
it got us to kind of getting used to that.
Now it's hard to go back.
It's true.

332
00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.550
It's like eating at five star restaurant and then you know,

333
00:21:57.551 --> 00:21:59.470
you can't go into Mcdonald's every day after that.

334
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.080
So now when we stay in a hotel or go into vacation,

335
00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.980
we like to order it on TV that Dr please.

336
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:08.500
It was around the clock nonstop.

337
00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:11.130
I was in a hotel in Europe went through,

338
00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.800
it was like that too and stand somewhere where it was like 24,

339
00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:19.060
seven you get hard core pornography.
Yeah.

340
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.690
And in this place it was obviously you order a movie,
right?

341
00:22:22.691 --> 00:22:27.310
Or you can order like the,
the four hour package and all that stuff or hours.

342
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:33.190
It's a thing about with Dr is that like your kid could just turn the channel and

343
00:22:33.311 --> 00:22:36.550
find that it wasn't on restricted times.
You know,
it was channel 69

344
00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:42.400
we just kinda cool cause then you can explain two things.
Your kid at once.
Sure.

345
00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:46.660
There's 69 and this is hardcore porn,

346
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:51.400
but this was a babies are made.
Yeah.
We uh,

347
00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:57.460
we looked through the titles.
That was not one of them.
Yeah.
No,

348
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:02.410
but we were trying to figure out like,
wow,
I said,
baffle,
snore.

349
00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:05.380
Geez.
I'm trying to figure out what's the,
uh,

350
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:09.540
what's the one we want to watch the theme for the night?
Could it be,
yeah.

351
00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:12.040
I mean a lot to choose from.

352
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:16.060
There's a lot of male stuff is very popular.
It's very popular.

353
00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:20.290
But we also found that a new genre,
not new,

354
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:25.320
but a genre has become the head multiple films prevalent and that was Harry.

355
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:33.740
Harry are seeing four or five titles in a hotel.
It's a trend.
Yeah,

356
00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:34.661
it's picked up.

357
00:23:34.661 --> 00:23:39.100
It was like my Harry teen and my wife's Harry Bush.

358
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:43.210
Every Carol's yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.
It's interesting.
I,

359
00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.530
my theory on the hairy stuff,
uh,

360
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:50.360
is that that place probably accommodates what's popular by the client for the

361
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:51.194
clientele.

362
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:54.920
So either it's like maybe they have a lot of Asian businessmen who were in a

363
00:23:54.921 --> 00:23:58.460
hairy stuff.
Maybe it's Europeans who come over and like hairy stuff.

364
00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:03.530
Do you categorize those to the Asians are very,
uh,

365
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.780
they're anti specific kinky stuff.
They like,
you know,

366
00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:11.480
there are vending machines that sell dirty panties in Japan school girl thing.

367
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:15.620
Yeah.
So they have particular kinks nationally.
I'm sure we do too.

368
00:24:15.621 --> 00:24:18.890
I just don't know them.
I don't know.
Like what do we like,

369
00:24:18.891 --> 00:24:21.980
I think we're obsessed with mothers milfs which is,

370
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:27.380
which is just code for over 30 like it's not,
it doesn't necessarily,
right.

371
00:24:27.381 --> 00:24:32.030
It doesn't mean you're a mom.
It just means your over teen?
Yeah.

372
00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:35.690
It's either teen or MILF.
It's super weird.
So I'm,

373
00:24:35.691 --> 00:24:40.691
I'm going to go with Asian because it's because they are generally hair less or

374
00:24:41.151 --> 00:24:45.890
less hairy than white people.
So I'm thinking they might be the new kink.

375
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.640
I don't know.
What do you,
what's your,
who's who's buying the hairy stuff?
I see.

376
00:24:49.641 --> 00:24:54.641
I think it's less specific to them specifically as much as it is.

377
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.780
Um,
just that's where the trend is period.

378
00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:01.533
<v 4>Wow.</v>

379
00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:03.200
<v 0>I think so.
Yeah.</v>

380
00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:06.440
So you're saying that that's just the genre or all over the world,

381
00:25:06.441 --> 00:25:10.040
so that people,
I mean maybe not all over the world,
but I'm saying that overall,

382
00:25:10.041 --> 00:25:13.220
I think that John was probably just popular at the moment.
Sure.

383
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:14.840
It's exciting news for me.

384
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:24.110
<v 4>This
is Christ,
this guy.</v>

385
00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:28.900
The
crazy

386
00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:35.880
luck here.

387
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:52.020
<v 0>Okay.
Would you rather and prompt you or would you rather feast on this guy's big</v>

388
00:25:52.021 --> 00:25:54.070
nips?
Oh,
oh.

389
00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:58.410
Or you're doing pup play with your new friends.

390
00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:01.200
It's not sexual.
You're just wearing the costumes.

391
00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:06.420
I think I'd have to wear a costume if Haley
eyes water.

392
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.920
Well,
part of that wouldn't be pleasant for you.

393
00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.780
I don't want like him talking about it all the time.
Oh my God.

394
00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:19.550
And I remember his big hang like thick.
Yeah.

395
00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:24.880
Like what does it like body dysmorphic nipples.
They're not,
you know.

396
00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:25.500
Yeah.

397
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:30.500
He clearly played with them a lot or stretched him like he fucked them up so

398
00:26:32.101 --> 00:26:33.180
they could make videos like this.

399
00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:41.810
What a noble cause to destroy your nipples so that you can make videos for other

400
00:26:41.911 --> 00:26:46.770
perverts to look at.
Oh God.
Yeah.
So,
okay.
So we had the titles.

401
00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:49.450
There was Harry,
but then there was,
yeah,

402
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.260
the one that really caught our attention really caught our attention.

403
00:26:52.261 --> 00:26:56.160
I'm really disappointed we didn't watch it though.
Can I say what?

404
00:26:56.190 --> 00:27:01.110
Can I tell him the title?
Sure.
It was fuck my triple d.
Slash.
Wife.

405
00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.440
Yeah,
right.
I was like,
perfect.
Silly.

406
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.850
I got one right here next to me.
Yeah.

407
00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:13.080
Well if you were doing movies behind my back.
Yeah.
Well,
you know,
of course,

408
00:27:13.081 --> 00:27:16.860
you know what I really like about that is that it incorporates two genres.

409
00:27:16.861 --> 00:27:18.930
There's the big boobs.
Yeah.

410
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:24.020
And also the cuckolding thing of like humiliate me by fucking my web and liquid.

411
00:27:24.961 --> 00:27:28.740
Triple the sweat.
Other popular genre.
Yeah,
that's a big one.
Yeah.
Yeah.

412
00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:30.590
<v 2>Well I just googled that,
um,</v>

413
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:35.840
that title and I found some other ones I found I let him fuck my slot wife.

414
00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:39.300
Please Bang.
My wife tripled the fuck me.
Yeah.

415
00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.120
My friend fucks my wife and comes in her.

416
00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:47.010
<v 0>What I like about these titles is there's no mystery.
There's no,
no,</v>

417
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:52.250
nope.
There's no veiling.
What?
What's happening here?
Yeah.
It's kind of Nice.

418
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.820
Your wife.
I just,
nothing man.
Is it maybe bang my,
I'm,

419
00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:02.030
I am.
I might be bang my triple d slot wide.
Really?
Yeah.
Okay.

420
00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:06.620
F might be too harsh.
It can I please turn the air up?
I'm freezing.
Oh,
it's fine.

421
00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:08.630
It's distracting.
My legs are freezing.

422
00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:13.480
My white wife is used by three black class.
No,
no.

423
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:17.810
What are you doing man?
I'm so cold.
You have a sweatshirt on.
I have my,

424
00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:19.550
I don't have socks on.

425
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:23.040
<v 2>Oh,
come on man.
You're ruined everything.</v>

426
00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:26.770
You ruined everything.
What are you raising it to?

427
00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:29.660
What'd you put it on?
75

428
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:35.720
<v 0>maybe we have heat lamps in here,
man.
I can't even think I'm so distracted.</v>

429
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.580
He's,
you seriously ruined this.
How did I ruin that?
You just did right now.

430
00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:44.240
That's fine.
You don't even feel it.
I wonder.
I'm going to lower it.

431
00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:48.440
If it gets too hot,
we'll just turn the air on.
That's all.
God dammit.

432
00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:52.080
You need your balls,
milk.
You're so aggressive to them.

433
00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.750
<v 2>So anyways,</v>

434
00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:00.980
we didn't order that film it because it also brought me back to the time we went

435
00:29:00.981 --> 00:29:04.490
on a cruise with my parents.
Yeah.
My whole family actually.

436
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.690
And we decided we want to order a movie then.
And we did.
Yeah.

437
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:13.780
And on this cruise you could order a film.
Yeah.

438
00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:17.930
And it was a soft core film.
Yeah.
It was so disappointed.
Ever seen that before?

439
00:29:17.931 --> 00:29:20.870
Like you'd pay to watch softcore so dumb.

440
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:24.890
So after we've fast forwarded through it and realize what it was,

441
00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.600
I called a guest relations and the Filipino guy was like,

442
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:34.160
yes.
I said,
I ordered this movie and,
and there's,

443
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:38.720
there's no penetration.
And he goes,
wow.
I said,

444
00:29:38.721 --> 00:29:42.430
I wanted hardcore.
I want to see it going and out.
And

445
00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.700
<v 0>so he
checked with his manager and he was like,</v>

446
00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:53.140
okay,
we will refund.
No,
we checked it.
We asked him,

447
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:57.460
are there any hardcore ones I don't want to see softcore it's a waste of my time

448
00:29:57.461 --> 00:29:58.230
and money.

449
00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:02.170
So then he put us on hold and he asked his manager if there are any hardcore

450
00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:03.123
films,

451
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:15.360
Bang,
my triple D's slept peg wipe.

452
00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:18.600
I have such a soft spot for that lady cause you know,
she's like,

453
00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:22.170
you know what we're here to do.
Just go.
Yeah.
She was like,
come on.

454
00:30:22.171 --> 00:30:27.090
It's like I gotta pick my kid up from school three quits abating.
Do Bro.

455
00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:32.010
Yeah.
I mean cause this fucking come on.
Yeah,
you can tell that she's just like,

456
00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:36.510
yeah,
it's horrible.
Let's pick up the pace a little bit.
It's horrible.
Um,

457
00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.540
back to your thing about attracted people.
I was thinking about it.

458
00:30:39.541 --> 00:30:42.990
You're right that a lot of them become like trainers,
personal trainers.

459
00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:47.190
I see him.
It's a,
it's an exercise in their own vanity.

460
00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:49.500
There's a trainer,

461
00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:53.820
my friend Mary Lynn showed me a picture on Instagram and I was like,

462
00:30:53.821 --> 00:30:55.080
this guy's like perfect.

463
00:30:55.081 --> 00:30:59.100
Like you ever see somebody who's so attractive,

464
00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:03.540
just perfect that your,
I can't even look at your,
it makes me uncomfortable.

465
00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:08.210
Instagram's the place to find them by the way.
They've found their,
uh,

466
00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:12.120
their place in this social media world.
Like this Instagram,

467
00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.400
you just like if you open your explore page,

468
00:31:14.401 --> 00:31:18.030
sometimes they're just beautiful people and you go there and it's like,

469
00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:23.160
it's not anyone of like any known,
uh,

470
00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:24.630
field or talent.
They're just like,

471
00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:28.410
I'm incredibly good looking and I'm sharing it with all of you.
A mess.

472
00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.810
That hole that's there for them.
Do they get paid?

473
00:31:30.811 --> 00:31:33.810
Do you think if you build up enough followers,

474
00:31:33.811 --> 00:31:36.390
you definitely can get paid just for being good looking?
Well,

475
00:31:36.391 --> 00:31:39.660
it's just like that Cameron Dallas boy that we watched the Netflix show about

476
00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.370
all those boys,
by the way.

477
00:31:41.371 --> 00:31:45.090
I loved their Instagram feeds because they're all really cute and that's all

478
00:31:45.091 --> 00:31:47.850
they do.
And then they do meet and greets and they make a ton of money.

479
00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:50.370
But here's the best part on Instagram.

480
00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:54.750
You see what they're spending their money on.
Oh,
and right now it's like,

481
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:58.890
here's my new Lamborghini with the doors that come up or whatever,

482
00:31:58.891 --> 00:32:01.050
like Delorean type.
Here's my,

483
00:32:01.051 --> 00:32:04.470
this place I'm renting right now in the Hollywood hills,
and you're like,
dude,

484
00:32:04.471 --> 00:32:06.630
you're renting like buy a house.

485
00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:12.000
They're renting these really expensive houses.
They're getting ridiculous cars.

486
00:32:12.001 --> 00:32:14.760
They're going on ridiculous vacations.
I'm like,
you're just burning through it.

487
00:32:14.761 --> 00:32:19.500
If I got a little amount of money at 16 what are you going to do so stupid and

488
00:32:19.501 --> 00:32:20.910
feel like I'm going to get this forever?

489
00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:24.780
You don't think that that would ever slow down.
Now I know.

490
00:32:24.781 --> 00:32:27.510
What are they going to do when they turn 30 it's like 30 Oh,

491
00:32:27.511 --> 00:32:30.420
how about when they turned 20 I was going to go away.

492
00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:34.410
Not going to be cute little kids anymore.
Oh my goodness.
What are we doing?

493
00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.940
I don't know.
Stuff like this.

494
00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:55.790
<v 5>Oh,
fuck me.
Fuck me.</v>

495
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.680
Oh yes,
sir.
Yes.
Ah,
yes.

496
00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.450
<v 0>There's $600</v>

497
00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:07.140
were those meet and greets you?

498
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:14.940
He's make 600,000 in a weekend is Christ.
Could you imagine how painful that is?

499
00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:18.150
That that is such a,
that's also very daunting clip because it's like,

500
00:33:18.151 --> 00:33:21.840
is he liking it or not?
Right down the middle.
Yeah.

501
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.640
There's moments of both feelings.

502
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:26.040
<v 6>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

503
00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:34.650
<v 0>Here's somebody who is horribly upsetting.
Yeah.
Uh,
God damn it.
This is like,</v>

504
00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:38.040
this pisses me off that this even exists.
This is real.

505
00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:43.460
<v 7>Traceability is the desire or need to move from being able to be disabled.</v>

506
00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:52.110
It's true choice stones.
Troy.

507
00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:56.720
<v 0>I got it.
Yeah.
So there is a fucking assholes out there.</v>

508
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:58.820
Yeah.
Then if you're like,
wait,
what do they want?

509
00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.940
<v 7>No,
just no bad.
Want some form of amputation.</v>

510
00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:08.040
Want Ida Ronan two legs or wanting to,
um,

511
00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:12.000
a number wants to be paralyzed.
Okay.

512
00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.290
They have a very specific point at which they want their building to be

513
00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.193
paralyzed.

514
00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:22.930
<v 0>I mean,
okay.
And here are,
you just beat the fuck out of it.
Right.
And do that.</v>

515
00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.550
And we're suppose,

516
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:26.910
here's the thing is that we're supposed to be super tolerant of everybody's

517
00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:31.230
needs and emotional states,
but at what point can we just be like,
you know what?

518
00:34:31.231 --> 00:34:32.980
You're fucking mentally ill.
Yeah.
Okay,

519
00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:36.930
you got problems and you need to go to a see a shrink because your head's fucked

520
00:34:36.931 --> 00:34:40.280
up.
Yeah,
you are.
You're fucking weird.
Why?

521
00:34:40.281 --> 00:34:44.340
Why can't we just call people weird anymore or abnormal?
Hey,
guess what?

522
00:34:44.341 --> 00:34:47.440
Your psychology,
it's abnormal.
You're not normal.
It was a,

523
00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:52.020
it's a pushback on people saying that too much for everything.

524
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:56.810
Like in other words,
people were told you are not normal if you're gay.
Right,

525
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.130
right,
right,
right,
right,
right,
right.

526
00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:02.250
So then that pushback is that anything,

527
00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:05.220
anything you want is embrace.
You want to,

528
00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:09.090
you want to amputate your arms to feel special and different.
Yeah,
go ahead.

529
00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:12.600
You are a fucking asshole.
A total asshole.
No,
I mean I really,

530
00:35:12.601 --> 00:35:16.680
it enrages me that somebody is going to sign up for that.

531
00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:20.220
Like fuck you know how lucky you are.
Well,
if you're going to amputate your arm,

532
00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:25.280
then donate it to a vet who just had his fucking arms blown off by an IED in

533
00:35:25.471 --> 00:35:26.304
Afghanistan.

534
00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:30.380
<v 7>Well,
personally spoken to,
looks like it wants to become blind.</v>

535
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.490
I like how empathetic this guy to move with his penis.

536
00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:38.010
<v 0>Go for it.
Good.
Please.
You don't reproduce.</v>

537
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:43.310
<v 7>I need to move away from pathologized and appreciating the,</v>

538
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:49.080
the,
the feeling wheel distress.
The next beer.
Okay.
What?

539
00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.730
Pretending they're not fake case,
but get over it.

540
00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:58.580
It's usually like a leg removed.

541
00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:02.830
<v 0>Yeah,
but we shouldn't help them know and we shouldn't feel badly for them.
No.</v>

542
00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:05.800
I think we should go back to re pathologizing people.

543
00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:09.700
You need to call them fucking Weirdos and an abnormal,
take him in a room.

544
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:14.750
You had a couple of fucking baseball bat and give them a real fucking beating

545
00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.370
and then afterwards be like,
you still want to lose those limbs.

546
00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:22.720
That's what you should do.
And see if they feel the same way.
Yeah.
Yeah.

547
00:36:22.721 --> 00:36:23.920
You know what?
I think the problem is,

548
00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:28.090
is that we don't institutionalize people anymore.
I think Reagan,

549
00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:32.020
the institutionalized,
a lot of the mentally ill in the 80s and since then,

550
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:36.910
the thought of putting somebody in a mental hospital is considered very taboo.

551
00:36:36.911 --> 00:36:37.840
But I think you should.

552
00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:40.750
I think there are people who need to be locked up mean what does this guy want

553
00:36:40.751 --> 00:36:43.860
to do?
Celebrate them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He wants to get some rights.

554
00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:46.030
Here's a whole group of dumb people out there.

555
00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:49.840
They want to do some dumb shit to themselves and we should all be there to help

556
00:36:49.841 --> 00:36:53.590
support and talking about why we have to support every stupid thing that exists.

557
00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:57.310
So fucking random shit.
You don't have to support some stuff is this is wrong.

558
00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:01.690
I mean imagine the person listening to this who was of who it went to fight for

559
00:37:01.691 --> 00:37:06.190
our country and it has her arms and legs blown off and a sitting in and

560
00:37:06.191 --> 00:37:07.750
listening to this fucking,
exactly.

561
00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:11.470
That's what I'm saying was like people who have been in accidents and wars

562
00:37:11.471 --> 00:37:13.060
stupid and they're like,
yeah,

563
00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:17.620
it's been a real thrill that this happened and you want this to happen.
Yeah,

564
00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.830
fuck you.
Fuck you.
And your stupid arm

565
00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:26.300
<v 7>and your dad cutting
barely very catholic.
The secret</v>

566
00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:35.630
prison.
Yeah.
So number amputation was the only way forward.

567
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:40.420
<v 0>Yeah.
I'm hearing though is that they want to do it.
He hasn't said that like,</v>

568
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:44.810
and then they did it.
You realize that good doctors going to voluntarily,
no,

569
00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:47.150
I want them to do it in their fucking backyards.
Like,

570
00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:49.820
I want to hear the story of that.
You know what?

571
00:37:49.821 --> 00:37:52.910
That's a great idea is if you get it,
do it.
You gotta do it.

572
00:37:52.911 --> 00:37:56.810
You got to get like a wooden,
yeah.
What is that?
Just like a cutoff tree.

573
00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.560
A stump in the backyard and the acts,
and if you can do it,
it's yours.

574
00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.070
You get to do it.
No,
and I want to make youtube videos that are like,
I want to,

575
00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:08.810
yeah.
Yeah.
You got to have to have a,
a horrible are hilarious segment CFF.

576
00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.750
We laughed.
All hilarious.
As far as I'm concerned for these assholes.

577
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:15.900
<v 7>Most people love the loop.
These feelings.
Well,</v>

578
00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:18.000
can't they just stay feelings though?

579
00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:25.280
Can we just hit the society needs to appreciate it too.
It does.

580
00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:29.600
However,
strange exam,
yes.
Yeah.

581
00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:35.420
Isn't beyond the Pale to allowing people to align with how they feel.

582
00:38:38.391 --> 00:38:38.610
Yeah.

583
00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:39.100
<v 0>No.</v>

584
00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:42.610
Can I say also the other problem with today's society is that just because you

585
00:38:42.611 --> 00:38:43.780
feel something,

586
00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:49.010
it doesn't mean you have a legitimate right to act on every fucking impulse.

587
00:38:49.141 --> 00:38:52.340
I know feelings.
A lot of feelings.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.

588
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.080
It's like these people really feel feeling,
I feel a lot of ways too.
I did too.

589
00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.660
You just fucking sit on those fields.
Right.

590
00:38:57.670 --> 00:39:01.800
Are you sublimate those feelings through healthier outlets?
Right.
So maybe,
okay.

591
00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:05.110
I want to be an MPC.
Well maybe how about not coming arm off,

592
00:39:05.111 --> 00:39:09.510
but maybe I do art work about a amputees where I work with people with the,

593
00:39:09.511 --> 00:39:12.490
you know,
why don't you,
uh,
Dan up for a Jujitsu school,

594
00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:17.440
see if they'll break your fucking arm.
Like,
just stay bad at it and then yeah,

595
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:21.310
it will happen as for the best guy every week and just be like,
arm me,
bro.

596
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:25.060
Just see if he can just keep cracking that shit.
Yeah.
Maybe that'll feel good.

597
00:39:25.061 --> 00:39:29.740
Go to a few Klan rallies.
Yeah.
Um,
did you go to the Klan Rally?
Well,

598
00:39:29.741 --> 00:39:33.310
I'm just saying like an La and get the shit be naughty or just wear like a Trump

599
00:39:33.311 --> 00:39:37.690
shirt in a la in la,
you know what I mean?
Do something stupid.
Okay.

600
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:43.330
Yeah.
Speaking of raging,
it is horrible.
Are hilarious.

601
00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:48.760
This is one that came in.
Oof.
I don't know if I can even handle this

602
00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:52.683
<v 8>one.</v>

603
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:04.170
<v 5>What just happened?
What just happened?
What was that?
What was that?</v>

604
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.980
What was that?
What is that?
What is that?
What?
I'm not looking,
I'm not real.

605
00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:15.810
When I came out,
when I came out,
oh my God.

606
00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:20.020
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Oh God.
Oh God.
Oh God.
Oh God.
I can't even look at that.

607
00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:20.650
I don't know.

608
00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:25.230
<v 0>This is not a good one.
It's not hilarious saying what happened.
Oh No,</v>

609
00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:26.173
I want to see it.

610
00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:28.740
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

611
00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:30.940
<v 0>He tied a rope to his balls and then jumped in.</v>

612
00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.000
I know what it is that what it was?
I don't know what he did.

613
00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.860
Everything that I don't like it.

614
00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:39.860
<v 5>Oh my God.
Oh God.
Oh God.
Oh my God.</v>

615
00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:40.923
Oh my God.

616
00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:47.670
<v 8>Dude is not came out this if you just fucking sick.
I'm leaving.</v>

617
00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.360
<v 0>Look at that guy.
He's like,
I'm leaving,
dude.
That's not cool.</v>

618
00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:57.420
<v 8>We have an incident,
uh,
at the heritage park and we're probably Virginia.</v>

619
00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:02.280
Uh,
my friend,
he,
he tied a rope.

620
00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:05.790
He tied a rope to himself and then he took off running off a tree.

621
00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.450
It was just like,
he was just like fooling around.

622
00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:09.880
Like a bunch of guys were around.

623
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:14.850
We were just goofing off and he ended up ripping his like his testicle.

624
00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.880
<v 0>Okay.
Well that's a horrible one.
Horrible one.</v>

625
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:27.050
Okay,
let's take it.
Let's take a breather.
Let's take phone so bad.

626
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:30.230
Well Great.

627
00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:35.000
That was a full fucking a stoppage.
You actually change clothes.

628
00:41:35.001 --> 00:41:38.990
You were so traumatized.
That blue band is here.

629
00:41:38.991 --> 00:41:42.140
He's adjusting the lighting cause we're having a guest come in soon.

630
00:41:42.141 --> 00:41:45.850
That's the thing that we wanted to announce that um,

631
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:50.210
we're actually having a guest in studio for the first time in,

632
00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:52.790
well first time here and also the first time and I don't know,

633
00:41:52.791 --> 00:41:56.840
it's gotta be like two years or something.
Yeah.
Cause once we move from the,

634
00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:01.310
from Redondo to house and then we were recording the show next to our son's

635
00:42:01.311 --> 00:42:02.060
nursery.

636
00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:06.920
So we didn't really want to have guests coming in and out of our babies room

637
00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.250
essentially.
So it's been awhile.
It's been awhile.

638
00:42:10.251 --> 00:42:14.480
But here we are and we're um,
you know,
we're a,

639
00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.450
we're set up for a guest,
but listen,
it turns out that guy,

640
00:42:17.451 --> 00:42:21.800
cause I didn't want to look again.
He tied a rope to his ball bag.
Stupid.

641
00:42:21.801 --> 00:42:26.510
Jumped with the other end,
tied to a tree.
So stupid.
Oh my God.
What happened?

642
00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:32.130
Yeah.
I thought I saw the rope and I was like,
dude,
he did not just,

643
00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:36.560
well the verdict is in horrible are hilarious.
It was fucking horrible.
Horrible.

644
00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:38.180
Wait.
So you didn't even find that.

645
00:42:38.181 --> 00:42:42.990
I thought it was funny in the beginning because I was like,
now what?

646
00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.050
What made it not funny for you?
Oh Dude,

647
00:42:45.051 --> 00:42:47.870
any ball related trauma is not funny to me.
I can't,

648
00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:51.350
I can't do it just cause it's a guy.
A guy hurting is nuts.
I can't do it.

649
00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:56.050
I just can't have empathy.
Is that what you're saying in those situations?

650
00:42:56.051 --> 00:42:56.820
You yes.

651
00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:01.460
You're able to put yourself in somebody else's shoes and feel that pain.

652
00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:05.790
Can I tie a rope around your balls?
No.
Just for five

653
00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.980
traumatic.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,

654
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.210
can I,
can I bring up another topic before we move along?
Sure.

655
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:19.970
I really want to get this in.
It's super important.

656
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:24.290
The other day you were calling me from Horrigan and you were on the,

657
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:26.120
I was on the phone here at home.

658
00:43:26.121 --> 00:43:30.530
You're on the phone and Horrigan and I was talking to you and I had to fess up

659
00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:34.170
and tell you the truth that I was actually sitting on a toilet and making it

660
00:43:34.171 --> 00:43:37.580
brown.
I go,
I'm sorry,
but I gotta go,
I'm taking a shit.

661
00:43:37.581 --> 00:43:41.660
And I realized I couldn't shit with you on the phone.
It didn't feel honest.

662
00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:46.340
And then you said,
I said,
you're never going to believe this.

663
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:51.710
I'm Browning too.
We were both browning at the same time.

664
00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:55.100
It's a synergy synergy.
Yeah.

665
00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:57.860
And I hit the mute button so that you didn't hear.

666
00:43:58.330 --> 00:44:01.160
Or like when you would start talking,
I would hit mute and then push.

667
00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:05.840
That was my problem with Browning with you is that I would have,

668
00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:07.900
I was afraid you were going to hear my sounds too.
Yeah.

669
00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.430
But that was really thoughtful of me.
You agreed on that.

670
00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:14.840
That was really nice and I wish I had thought of that strategy of muting.

671
00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:15.860
I didn't even think of it.

672
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:19.760
It was crazy to me because I thought I'd snuck in there.
Well,
I did.
We did.

673
00:44:19.761 --> 00:44:22.490
I did too.
We both it and then you're like,
I gotta tell you I'm Brian.
I was like,

674
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:26.990
oh my mouth dropped.
You believe it.
You were so excited.
You know,
you sell them.

675
00:44:26.991 --> 00:44:31.980
Show emotion or excitement.
I told you I was pregnant.
You're like,
stop

676
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:36.930
<v 2>it.
Yeah.
Uh,
somebody send us email.
Speaking of Brown,</v>

677
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.060
is it gross to Brown at a strip club?
No.

678
00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:43.500
I need the Sigora a was to settle.
The situation happened,

679
00:44:43.501 --> 00:44:45.240
I believe only Topdog and buns.
Oh,

680
00:44:45.241 --> 00:44:48.690
me and my dad can provide a balanced perspective on this.
On Friday,

681
00:44:48.691 --> 00:44:53.160
my bus fare and I went to a sleazy strip club to enjoy adult entertainment.

682
00:44:53.161 --> 00:44:56.100
My friend Dan had a couple of beers and he said,

683
00:44:56.430 --> 00:45:00.570
where's the pisser in this joint emotion to the hallway next to the DJ booth.

684
00:45:00.571 --> 00:45:04.050
I turned my attention back to the ladies grinding and they're removing their

685
00:45:04.051 --> 00:45:07.470
clothes.
25 minutes later,
Dan came out of the bathroom.

686
00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:11.820
Apparently Dan decided to take a shit in the bathroom at a strip club.

687
00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:13.800
The savage animal will shit anywhere.

688
00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:17.220
I feel like shitting in a server probably has never allowed.

689
00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:21.540
This is the most Fallon horrid place to relieve oneself.
Here's the question,

690
00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:25.800
is it reasonable to make brown?
I think it's reasonable.
I think so.

691
00:45:25.801 --> 00:45:30.240
And here's why.
Strip clubs are disgusting places to begin with.

692
00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:34.250
Cause that sounds like that's his logic for why not to do it.
And I think that's,

693
00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:37.530
that's odd.
I think if we're,
we're people shit,
uh,

694
00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:42.480
out at night at bars and stuff though,
you're at a bar and you're taking it shit.

695
00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:45.570
That's different.
I think it's weird that you got to shit at that hour.
You know,

696
00:45:45.571 --> 00:45:49.890
I had a friend that every time we go nightclubbing and high school and college,

697
00:45:49.891 --> 00:45:54.240
the minute we get to the club she'd have to,
Shit really does that nerves though,

698
00:45:54.241 --> 00:45:56.700
was that there was nurse and so she would be like,
oh,

699
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:58.770
taken if I have to go fucking shit at this club.

700
00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:02.010
I mean it's just uncomfortable to shit at a nightclub.

701
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:06.150
People are waiting in line I think anywhere where there's a long line of people

702
00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:09.570
and it's not really,
no,
I do get by the way,
I guess he's saying,
you know,

703
00:46:09.571 --> 00:46:14.571
there's so many gross dudes and they don't obviously don't care for the

704
00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.780
facilities.

705
00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:19.590
But I mean most bathrooms are pretty gross as what I'm saying at the Strip club.

706
00:46:19.591 --> 00:46:22.350
Like guys are obviously pissing and probably jerking off all over those

707
00:46:22.351 --> 00:46:26.160
bathrooms.
But I mean,
you know Shit,
you have to shit.
Yeah,

708
00:46:26.161 --> 00:46:29.280
he's guys gotta take a dump.
But I think anywhere,

709
00:46:29.281 --> 00:46:33.990
well here's an ideal place to shit when there's lots of stalls like a,

710
00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.700
you know,
a dodger game,
that's fine.

711
00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:39.350
Airports ideal for shitting cause there's a lot of traffic in and out.

712
00:46:39.351 --> 00:46:41.470
It's quick.
People make quick trips,
you know?
Yeah.

713
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:44.670
I got a message here that says three 95 audio trouble.

714
00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:48.760
There's trouble in three 95 really?
Let me see this.
Oh,

715
00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.100
there was an audio problem.

716
00:46:50.101 --> 00:46:54.960
The episode when Tom Plays an audio clip of Sarah Burns voicemail,

717
00:46:54.961 --> 00:46:58.730
there's a constant howling in my ear.
Stupid.

718
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.560
I know a lot of barking,
scratching,
sniffing,
stupid.

719
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:06.780
Actually every voicemail from Christina's friends.
I was like a pack of dogs.

720
00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:13.620
Let me know if it's district can be resolved.
Thanks Chris.
Wow.

721
00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:16.260
Now I know what he means.
I know what he means.

722
00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:19.590
Bitsy is in love with blue band.

723
00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:22.230
I don't know what you eat before you come over here,

724
00:47:22.231 --> 00:47:27.060
but this dog can't stop licking him.
Yeah,
his Jiu flavor.
She loves.
Wow.

725
00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:30.140
Two flavors.
What are you eating?
Could fell to fish

726
00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:36.280
<v 0>or your hands covered and locks before you come over.
How does she love you?</v>

727
00:47:36.281 --> 00:47:40.840
So she just loves him.
Just for a reference.
Uh,
here,

728
00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:42.640
let me see here is

729
00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:47.920
<v 6>why is this not working?
Why is this not working?</v>

730
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:51.740
<v 0>Can I talk about my experiment?
When you're looking for that,</v>

731
00:47:51.741 --> 00:47:55.370
then how did you find it?
So our sun,

732
00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:58.220
it turns out is lactose intolerant.

733
00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:03.610
And you and I did that 23 and me genetic testing a while back and it revealed

734
00:48:03.831 --> 00:48:06.110
that I was lactose intolerant,

735
00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:09.830
which really makes sense because I fucking hate milk.

736
00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:13.850
And every time I would have ice cream,
my stomach would just be wrecked.

737
00:48:13.851 --> 00:48:16.130
I would get gas bubbles like really painful.
Yeah,

738
00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:18.320
I can eat cheese pretty much just fine.

739
00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:23.510
But milk liquid is destroys me.
So my son has it now.

740
00:48:23.511 --> 00:48:27.610
We stopped feeding him regular milk,
he drinks lactose free milk.
And I thought,

741
00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:30.530
yeah,
he's totally fine now.
And I thought to myself,

742
00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:35.660
what if I just tried drinking some milk and just to see if I really have a thing

743
00:48:35.661 --> 00:48:39.740
that I know that's true.
Sometimes you have to verify it.
Yeah.

744
00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:43.430
And so I drank some milk and sure enough,

745
00:48:43.431 --> 00:48:48.200
I shit like three times after and it was really painful.
And so guess what?

746
00:48:48.201 --> 00:48:50.240
I'm lactose intolerant,
but just for milk.

747
00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:53.060
And you already knew this and I knew this,

748
00:48:53.061 --> 00:48:58.000
but I want it to retest the theory here is just to be clear.
Um,

749
00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:01.000
pulled up burns voicemail,
stop it,

750
00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:08.810
stop it.
So stupid.
She's a gorgeous,

751
00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:09.950
here's Mary Lynn.

752
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:16.370
I can see what he meant.
Maryland rice cub,

753
00:49:16.371 --> 00:49:21.371
also a star of 24 fantastically good looking shot of a,

754
00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:27.620
I want to say her last name and then,
yeah,
I mean,
she's very good looking too.

755
00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:28.580
All my friends are very,

756
00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:30.620
<v 6>and there you are talking.</v>

757
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.690
<v 0>Yeah.
I don't know what they,
I mean it sounds like it.
That was the issue,</v>

758
00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:40.380
but I mean it's,
I don't know.
I guess you're saying,
Oh,

759
00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.120
my friends are the dog pound.
What?

760
00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:44.970
What kind of lookers do you think you have in your bunch?

761
00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:50.090
Who's in your corner burger or breads or the fattest working comedian out there?

762
00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:56.710
Who's your hot friend collection?
Blue Band.

763
00:49:56.770 --> 00:50:01.630
Yup.
Come on.
Who else do you have now?
Your friends are lovely.
This is,

764
00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:06.460
you know,
we're just your friends or dogs.
Okay.
Okay.
Ah,
man,

765
00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:11.170
that was fun.
Good time.
But you're,
you're where the dudes,
that guy.

766
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:16.270
Yeah.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
No,
they're all on attractive.

767
00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:21.190
Your friends are lovely.
They are.
They are lovely.
They're good looking.

768
00:50:21.191 --> 00:50:23.340
Which one of them?
When did you marry up there?

769
00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:27.230
You're there all marriage material.
They are,
yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.

770
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.290
<v 2>They've all been married or are married.
Yeah.</v>

771
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:37.280
They're all marriage material.
Okay.
No,
I would,
I would put it in all of them.

772
00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:40.830
Stop it.
What?
I didn't say,
put it in.
I said Mary,

773
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:46.730
now I would,
I would finish.
And all of them stop it.
The problem with my friends,

774
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:51.620
they all got a hungry tits.
And you like sloppers oh no.

775
00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:55.760
Anger.
No,
of course not.

776
00:50:55.830 --> 00:50:58.340
I thought you were into big slops.
I liked his period.

777
00:50:58.341 --> 00:51:00.460
I don't care what size they are.
Yeah.
Yeah.

778
00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:05.090
But you like I'm hanging in mushy purple now or they can be hungry and starving.

779
00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:09.920
It doesn't matter.
I don't care.
Put them in.

780
00:51:09.921 --> 00:51:12.530
Put them,
put them everywhere.
Leave them out.

781
00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:17.210
I like him that you like blondes,
but still,
I mean,

782
00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:21.950
none of them are blind.
If she is the grass on the field.
Stupid.

783
00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:26.870
It's dumb,
Huh?
Cause you can,
it's all pink on the inside.

784
00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:31.910
God,
this.
So,
uh,
here's a dad boner.

785
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:33.500
This one's pretty fucking great.

786
00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:37.160
This Dad boner decides to go fishing with a drone.

787
00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.370
So it was like his own little experiment.

788
00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:43.310
Today we're gonna be doing something that's another internet first and totally

789
00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:46.260
outrageous.
We're going to go fishing.
I love this,

790
00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:49.330
but we're not using worms and we're not in the little Paul.

791
00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:54.540
We were on Lake Champlain and we are going to be trolling with a jitterbug.

792
00:51:55.370 --> 00:52:00.110
Cool.
Let's see how this goes.
So then the drone look,

793
00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:03.410
watch that.
It's fine.
I fish and you just see the fish.

794
00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:07.880
Just I got a fish.
Oh my gosh.

795
00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:10.850
Oh my gosh.
Oh my gosh.

796
00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:18.020
Holy crab apples.
I have apples.
Wait,
he that?

797
00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.220
That's just starting.

798
00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:20.730
<v 8>Oh my gosh.</v>

799
00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.580
Oh my gosh.

800
00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.280
<v 2>Crazy that.
That drone caught that though,
right?</v>

801
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:41.790
I wish you get this excited for me.
Like when you yell for me to come.

802
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:44.023
I love that.

803
00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:45.973
<v 8>Look.</v>

804
00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:54.570
It's a huge freaking bat.
Tell me the numbers on my Gopro.
Rolling.

805
00:52:58.350 --> 00:53:01.300
Got Your camera clicks quickly.
You got to hurry up.
I gotta put this down.

806
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:04.380
Quick,
quick,
quick

807
00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:08.790
<v 2>turn.
The site here,
the phone sideways.
Marianne's got a newborn in her arm.</v>

808
00:53:08.791 --> 00:53:13.791
Two other little ones and this asshole's excited about his fish is important

809
00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:14.820
that you're doing.
She's like,

810
00:53:14.821 --> 00:53:16.710
could you just fucking help me with these babies right now?

811
00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:22.950
He's stoked about it.
I'd be so mad at him.

812
00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:25.980
I like his Dad Boehner style that ATS is pretty good.
I do wish

813
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.540
<v 0>you good crab apples.</v>

814
00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:30.330
Cravable I wish you would get excited about anything like that.

815
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:33.840
I do get excited about what though?
Different things.

816
00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:38.310
Nothing in life is that exciting?
Nothing.
No.
Come on.

817
00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:42.900
I'm never seen you get that gig done.
Anything that's not true.
Never.

818
00:53:42.901 --> 00:53:43.734
Not Excitement.

819
00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:48.270
Excitement's not your thing like personality champs.

820
00:53:48.271 --> 00:53:51.270
Get excited about cabs.
Damn it.
You're just not,

821
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:56.820
not very excitable or fun or I'm pretty excitable.
No,

822
00:53:56.970 --> 00:53:59.700
never.
You can't think of one time.

823
00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:00.953
<v 6>Hmm?</v>

824
00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:06.350
<v 0>You never like jump up and down and like,
oh yeah.
That's so rad.</v>

825
00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:10.820
Yeah.
Watching sports.
Sometimes I get excited.
You.
Yeah.
Okay,
I'll take that back.

826
00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:15.350
Yeah.
Football,
football.
You like that?
It's exciting.
Murder.

827
00:54:15.351 --> 00:54:19.790
You've seen me jump and scream and clap.
Yeah.
Motherfucker.
Yeah.
Angry.

828
00:54:19.810 --> 00:54:22.770
It's like anger,
excitement.
Sometimes they get really excited.
You do?
Yeah.

829
00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:26.510
At that football through.
There you go.
That's a good one.
Okay,
come on.

830
00:54:26.570 --> 00:54:31.480
Don't be nonbinary.
I want to amputate one of my arms.

831
00:54:31.850 --> 00:54:35.000
Fucking assholes,
man.
You've got to respect people,
Tom,

832
00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:37.940
and everybody has a right to have their feelings.

833
00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:41.620
Everyone has right to act on their irrational feelings.
No.
Um,

834
00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:46.900
the other day you're in the kitchen and you pulled your legs up,

835
00:54:47.121 --> 00:54:47.990
you're in your boxer shorts,

836
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:52.820
you pull your legs up to your ears and then you farted at me.
Yeah.

837
00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:58.040
And I feel like this might be a turning point for us.

838
00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:02.990
And what's way just like in the way of like,

839
00:55:02.991 --> 00:55:06.360
is this it?
Like are we,
are we are brother and sister now?
Like is that,

840
00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:10.340
do you like,
do you even think of me as a woman?
I do.
Of course.

841
00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:16.240
Like somebody that you have sex with or you know that you see me as like an

842
00:55:16.641 --> 00:55:20.480
opposite sex person.
Yeah,
you're totally are.
Yeah.

843
00:55:21.350 --> 00:55:21.970
<v 6>Okay.</v>

844
00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:23.200
<v 0>I totally see you as that.</v>

845
00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:28.390
And so if we were recording 12 years ago,
like we just started dating,

846
00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:31.840
would you pull your legs up and Fart at me at the table then?

847
00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:35.500
Or 12 years in the game and you feel like it's in the game?
We're in the game.

848
00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:40.540
I mean,
I actually have I recorded your response when I farted there,
right?

849
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:42.590
Did I hit it on my phone?
Here you are.
Nope,

850
00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:53.200
I'm a big dog.
I like that.
There I am brother Brussels.
Yeah.

851
00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:57.370
Brussels bark.
So I'm a small dog.
Yeah,

852
00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:02.200
I thought a little Brussels feelings.
Yes.
True.
Yeah.
Yeah,

853
00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:04.760
that's me.
Oh Wow.

854
00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:10.540
So that's how I would bark at you.
Yeah.
I don't think we're over the line.

855
00:56:10.541 --> 00:56:14.500
You think were crossed?
That was it.
I think we may have overstepped seriously.

856
00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:19.530
We may have entered in a territory like officially in it for life.

857
00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:24.160
Double the double leg back pull.
Yeah.
In their underwear.

858
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:27.370
<v 2>Yeah.
I thought that was,
that may have,</v>

859
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.720
may have put us into weird territory.
We should get the house phone.

860
00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:36.820
It's a smart idea to know when can you run in there?
It's on the counter.

861
00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:39.193
<v 4>MMM.</v>

862
00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:43.540
<v 0>Do you think that that may have may have affected us?</v>

863
00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:45.970
I feel like I can't unsee it.
That's the problem.

864
00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:49.480
Like there's a reason you and I don't shit in front of each other.
Yeah.

865
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:51.260
Because I feel like that will,
but

866
00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:54.250
<v 2>that would put us into territory of like,
no,
going back.</v>

867
00:56:54.251 --> 00:56:56.760
We're brother and sister now.
Yeah,
I agree.
We don't do that.
We shouldn't,

868
00:56:56.770 --> 00:57:00.340
shouldn't try.
I mean,
I don't know if this has been the line crossing.

869
00:57:00.341 --> 00:57:04.060
Somebody sent in this evidence that you,

870
00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:09.550
you are the FARC champ says I am.
Let's see though.
Let's see what it says.

871
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:11.343
<v 4>MMM.</v>

872
00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:20.070
<v 2>I Dunno.
I like those dog barks.
I love dogs.
Evidence that Tina</v>

873
00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:26.690
is the FARC champ.
Uh,
2013 episode one,
45,

874
00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:31.580
13 gene with you and you have this horrible gas problem.
Uh,

875
00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:35.300
you just let them rip all day.
And I'm like,
I love her.
What am I supposed to do?

876
00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:39.950
And then you say you fire a lot more than me,
I think.
And I say no.

877
00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:45.500
And you say,
who do you think so far it's more,
and I say you.
So it's kind of,

878
00:57:45.501 --> 00:57:48.740
it's weird.
In this instance we're actually roll.

879
00:57:48.741 --> 00:57:51.430
You're declaring declining that you are right.

880
00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:54.840
I'm insisting that you are 2013.
Yeah.
Wow.

881
00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:57.570
My things have changed since then.
Yeah.

882
00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:01.520
<v 0>So you,
you insisted that I was the fart champion.</v>

883
00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:06.110
<v 2>This person says that.
Um,
in Fsos one,
two,</v>

884
00:58:06.111 --> 00:58:07.670
three 94,
yeah,

885
00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:11.960
there is clear irrefutable evidence episodes one with that.

886
00:58:11.961 --> 00:58:16.730
Tom Segura is the personality champ negative.
Yeah.
Begs on its countless hours.

887
00:58:16.731 --> 00:58:20.990
He's more charming,
more likable overall has a better personality,
Dylan.

888
00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:21.751
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

889
00:58:21.751 --> 00:58:25.560
How many people I meet when I do my shows that come up to me and they're like,

890
00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:27.450
you're the personality champ,
you're the best.

891
00:58:27.451 --> 00:58:29.120
And then I just get tweets all day long.

892
00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:31.170
It's like I can't even look at my Twitter feed,
you know,

893
00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:33.570
telling me how much personality I have.
I don't think so.

894
00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:37.310
I'm looking at you and you have this a horrible gas penis.
Yeah.

895
00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:43.130
<v 2>You just let them rap all day.
Oh yeah.
Me and I'm like,
I love her.</v>

896
00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:48.050
What am I supposed to do?
There you go.
You fart a lot more than me I think.

897
00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:52.910
No.
Who Do you think for it's more,
yeah.
Well Shit you,
no way.

898
00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:57.410
You let out a couple of monster ones.
Uh,
last night and or this morning?

899
00:58:58.100 --> 00:58:59.050
<v 0>This morning.
Yeah.
Well,</v>

900
00:58:59.051 --> 00:59:02.770
we ate a lot of pre Zuto and cheese last night for dinner.
Yeah.

901
00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:06.210
You as you are insisting that I was right.
And you were saying that you weren't,

902
00:59:07.890 --> 00:59:08.920
you were saying if you weren't,
you know what,

903
00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:13.320
sometimes we're not always ready for greatness.
Yeah.
It's like you,

904
00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:16.110
you become great.
That's what we're time.

905
00:59:16.111 --> 00:59:20.430
You're not always ready to accept the title.
So that's what this is all about.

906
00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:21.640
Podcast,

907
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:26.950
this podcast is about discovering oneself

908
00:59:28.570 --> 00:59:32.570
and you're kind of at that point,
it's the farts of that steep bro,

909
00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:37.550
bro is for yourself.
This is for farts.
Discovering.
Yeah.

910
00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:41.360
It's uh,
it's pretty,
pretty wild that,

911
00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:45.260
that we've gotten to this point where you're really finding out who's who and

912
00:59:45.261 --> 00:59:49.190
what's what,
you know.
Yeah.
Bang.
My triple d slot wife.
Whoa.

913
00:59:51.530 --> 00:59:54.740
Blue Band doesn't know about that.
You'll hear it.

914
00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:59.750
That's how we kept saying that title over and over to ourselves,
over and over.

915
00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.250
Stupid Bang.

916
01:00:01.251 --> 01:00:05.240
My triple d slash wife bring my tripled who slept wife.

917
01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:11.470
That's what it sounds like.
Yeah.
Bang.
My triple the slept wife.

918
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:14.690
Yeah.

919
01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:23.600
Yeah.
Bang.
My triple D's slot life.

920
01:00:23.601 --> 01:00:27.440
So any moment we should be joined by somebody,
it's going to be,

921
01:00:27.441 --> 01:00:30.860
I think we should leave it as a surprise until he gets here just to be sure.

922
01:00:30.861 --> 01:00:34.160
Yeah.
Yeah,
of course.
And it's not what you expect.

923
01:00:34.161 --> 01:00:37.040
It's not a comic and entertainer,

924
01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:40.920
but it is a field that is of great interest to both,

925
01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:47.210
to both of us.
I'm more of an efficient auto.
I don't think so.

926
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:51.320
As usual.
You're ruining a great moment.
But um,

927
01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:56.410
I think you guys will probably find this as interesting as I rolling.

928
01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:01.370
Those are all signs of divorce.
What about him?
Contempt for your spouse?

929
01:01:01.371 --> 01:01:06.320
That th that's the predictor of divorce and eye rolling is a huge predictor and

930
01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:09.920
well,
a lot both in this family.
But what about it?

931
01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:11.750
You constantly have contempt?

932
01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:18.720
I don't constantly have contempt.
No,
I don't know.

933
01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.970
Where is he?
She's here.
So

934
01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:28.550
somebody tweeted a,

935
01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:33.700
was it Sean Spicer to see if he had heard about the constraints and whether the

936
01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:38.690
White House had comment on it.
What does this administration,

937
01:01:38.691 --> 01:01:40.430
I think of the calm strike that's going on.

938
01:01:42.050 --> 01:01:46.850
The what for and foreign come strike now.

939
01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:51.590
I masturbated to everybody in my family.
It's so nuts.

940
01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:56.840
She's so fucking crazy.
Um,
can't even imagine.
Hey,

941
01:01:56.841 --> 01:02:01.070
so are fucking stupid dogs ran away last week.
I don't relive that.

942
01:02:01.071 --> 01:02:04.880
That was terrible.
It was terrifying.
It was terrible.
So I was in here recording.

943
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:09.350
That's deep bro.
And I,
it was dinnertime.
So I opened that.

944
01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:12.860
I usually keep them in here to record and then I let them into the house for

945
01:02:12.861 --> 01:02:14.880
dinner time thinking that,
you know,

946
01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:19.470
everybody would be there and I should have checked to make sure that the kitty

947
01:02:19.471 --> 01:02:22.830
door was shut.
We had like a childproof fence for some reason.

948
01:02:22.831 --> 01:02:26.940
I looked and I was like,
oh,
that's fine.
I didn't even like double check.
Um,

949
01:02:26.970 --> 01:02:30.390
come back in here to record you.
Come in here.
Like,
is it,

950
01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:32.310
are the dogs in here and the dogs in here?
I'm like,
no.

951
01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:36.390
<v 2>I'd say,
are the dogs in here?
I said,
is FIFA and FIFA Bach?</v>

952
01:02:36.810 --> 01:02:41.210
What was happening was I was upstairs,
I was on my computer.
The phone rings,

953
01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:46.400
there's somebody outside and he goes,
is your dog bitsy?
Oh my God.
I'm like,
yeah.

954
01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:51.200
He's like,
oh I have her outside.
So I run outside.
He's just standing.

955
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:54.800
This dude who I would not have guests would be the type of guy to do this.

956
01:02:54.801 --> 01:02:59.630
And he did not look like,
oh,
kind of homeless?
No,
he just looked kind of,
um,

957
01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:03.780
I don't know,
just kind of,
yeah,
he's kind of like a perv or something.
Yeah.

958
01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:07.900
So I take bitsy in and then I'm in,
by the way on,
I go downstairs,

959
01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:08.840
the front door's open,

960
01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:14.160
just the front door to our house is open mindedness and then I grab her.

961
01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:19.640
I'm terrified and I'm looking all around for,
I thought it features with you.

962
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.910
And then when he isn't like,
Oh shit.

963
01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:26.450
And we just go outside and we start looking for them or looking for fee cause

964
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:31.190
bits is back here,
man.
We drove all over this neighborhood

965
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:35.830
<v 0>yelling over the window,
asking anyone to see walking around.
Oh my God.</v>

966
01:03:35.831 --> 01:03:40.720
My favorite,
by the way,
is when we,
we fought,
there was one guy and I was like,

967
01:03:40.721 --> 01:03:44.980
have you seen a dog,
a small blonde dog?
And he goes,
yeah,
no,
no,
I haven't seen it.

968
01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:50.140
You should find it before the sun goes down.
All those coyotes come out and I go,

969
01:03:50.170 --> 01:03:54.640
thanks dude.
I hope.
Thank you.
I was like,
of course we're going to,

970
01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:57.850
we're not gonna stop looking for him.
Like my,
I guess the sun's down.

971
01:03:57.851 --> 01:04:01.510
We're going to stop looking for the dog that we've loved for the last six years,

972
01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.900
asshole.
Of course we're going to do to,
anyway,

973
01:04:04.901 --> 01:04:08.600
we finally did a phone call actually.
Uh,

974
01:04:09.130 --> 01:04:12.280
we saw the woman walking away from our house,
but she left me a voicemail.

975
01:04:12.281 --> 01:04:16.900
It didn't come through.
One of the neighbors found Fifo in her yard,

976
01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:21.700
three houses down or four houses down and called the sac.
There we had,
we walked.

977
01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:24.980
<v 2>So that area too,
but he,
he was,
you know,</v>

978
01:04:25.610 --> 01:04:27.590
he's only what you inches off the ground.

979
01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:33.920
<v 0>It's scary though.
It was really scary the whole time.
I kept thinking,</v>

980
01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:36.950
I won't be able to sleep tonight if we don't find Fifo.
I would,

981
01:04:37.470 --> 01:04:40.250
I would just be beside myself with grief.
Yeah.

982
01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:44.210
It was first born son and how many hours in labor I spent without guy.

983
01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:50.180
Anyways,
I bought a jeep dog gps for both of them.
They're both chipped,

984
01:04:50.330 --> 01:04:53.570
but that you know that microchips shit doesn't work unless somebody turns them

985
01:04:53.571 --> 01:04:56.570
into a vet or turns them into the shelter.

986
01:04:57.050 --> 01:05:01.480
So that chip is not gps is not the same thing.
Yeah.
And um,

987
01:05:01.790 --> 01:05:06.350
so I got them gps and I'm charging them now and then you put it on the color and

988
01:05:06.351 --> 01:05:09.740
you can see it on your cell phone where they are and there's an electric fence

989
01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:12.860
thing so that if they go out out of bounds it will notify you.

990
01:05:13.690 --> 01:05:18.070
<v 2>We got this email from a listener riding in hopes to shed light on this Dick</v>

991
01:05:18.071 --> 01:05:22.420
farting phenomenon so we can all know what's going on here.

992
01:05:22.421 --> 01:05:27.130
I was glancing over your recent podcasts and I thought this could be a fantastic

993
01:05:27.131 --> 01:05:29.230
learning experience for all involved.

994
01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:34.080
Crones is a chronic inflammatory condition with that inflammation,

995
01:05:34.090 --> 01:05:36.740
something called fistulas conform fistulas.

996
01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:40.660
Basically a little tube that connects to hollow organs.

997
01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:45.400
He's conformed between your bowel and blood vessels,
your skin and even yes,

998
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:46.263
your bladder.

999
01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:50.890
And the last sort of this Sheila forms called an end Toro vascular fistula.

1000
01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:54.880
Aaron water waste products can travel from the bowel into the bladder.

1001
01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:59.890
This causes amazing Dick farting phenomena that we have grown to love today.

1002
01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:03.940
I'm actually graduating from medical school in a week.
Oh,
I know what I'm saying.

1003
01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:08.680
Know what I'm saying?
Put some respect on my leg,
on my name.
I love you.

1004
01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:11.320
Signed the Dick farting expert.

1005
01:06:11.550 --> 01:06:16.210
<v 0>Hmm.
Really good.
All right,</v>

1006
01:06:16.211 --> 01:06:20.380
here it was the dick part.
That is it.
Take for it.
Do the Dick farts.
Yeah.

1007
01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:24.040
Does it Dick farts smell like farts?
You know,
no one touched on that.

1008
01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:27.220
No one touched on that.
I mean it's air so it could stink.

1009
01:06:27.490 --> 01:06:29.530
Well he says it comes from the bowel.
Good.

1010
01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:33.400
So I'm assuming that those Dick farts smell like real farts.
Man.

1011
01:06:33.401 --> 01:06:36.490
This too was pissing that as far as we're coming out of his dick.
Okay.

1012
01:06:36.491 --> 01:06:37.630
Would you rather,
do you think this,

1013
01:06:37.631 --> 01:06:40.630
our guests is going to know what the topics are before he gets here?

1014
01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:41.970
We can have him chime in.

1015
01:06:42.250 --> 01:06:46.660
Would you rather tie a string around your balls and jump off?

1016
01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:51.640
Nope.
Nothing as batch or have dick farts for the rest of your life?

1017
01:06:51.641 --> 01:06:54.040
A hundred thousand day far today.
I'd rather just,

1018
01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:56.680
every time I take it out just parts of song.
Okay.

1019
01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:00.310
Would you rather dick farts for the rest of your life?
Yup.

1020
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:05.200
Or one Drake from that guys nipples and you have to be like,

Um,

1023
01:07:13.721 --> 01:07:18.130
That's what you have to say.
Daddy,

I'm so thirsty.
God dammit.

1024
01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:20.320
I don't know where he is.
Oh,
he's here.

1025
01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:26.340
<v 4>Say it in German.
You should have a desk.</v>

1026
01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:31.810
I saw all the brands,
the

1027
01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:38.110
big map wash,
we dry,

1028
01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:43.450
<v 0>I think.
I think I would take one of those over a lifetime.
A Dick farts.</v>

1029
01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:47.620
Yeah.
Yeah,
because Dick farts.
There'll be a really bad though to do this.

1030
01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:51.880
This be a really bad,
he doesn't have milk in his breasts.
First of all,

1031
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:54.790
fucking vomit going on now.

1032
01:07:54.791 --> 01:07:58.330
Do men have milk ducts?
I think they do.

1033
01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:03.280
I think you could.
Can you a lactaid.
Oh Man.
I wonder,

1034
01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:08.200
can men listen?
Army man,
I don't know.
Our nipples are different.
So I don't,

1035
01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:13.060
I don't know.
Do you have milk?
Oh,
it's so gross.

1036
01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:16.100
It's so disgusting.
A medical Dr. Guy.

1037
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:19.850
<v 2>Can Men lactate?
Can men produce milk?</v>

1038
01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:24.470
I know that they must have similar equipment.
Look in Utero.

1039
01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:29.600
That's why men have stop it with the fucking bar.
You know,
I don't like it.

1040
01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:36.190
Don't laugh.
Blue Band.
It's legitimate phobia.
I have,
I fucking hate it dude.

1041
01:08:37.610 --> 01:08:42.140
It's not,
yeah,
it's real.
It's a fucking real mental problem.
I have,

1042
01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:47.500
I see a fucking shrink for it.
Please.
Dammit.

1043
01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:56.870
I love doing that to you.
I know you do.
That's what happens on this

1044
01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:01.030
content.
So let's,
uh,

1045
01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:05.240
let's break and hopefully in a few moments,

1046
01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:09.230
few minutes we'll return with a guest that we're very excited about.

1047
01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:14.270
Show me how those Dick farts smell.
Okay.
We'll be right back.
All right,

1048
01:09:14.271 --> 01:09:18.620
so we're back.
And uh,
you don't know that before you got here,

1049
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:21.620
this show had a lot of different topics.

1050
01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:26.890
Most of them were between our NC 17 and triple x and now it's a total change of

1051
01:09:27.891 --> 01:09:31.010
pace and we're very happy.
Happy to welcome,
by the way.

1052
01:09:31.190 --> 01:09:35.570
You are our first guest and not exaggerating here in a couple of years.

1053
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:37.400
Oh my gosh.
We used to have guests all the time.

1054
01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:42.800
We have the foremost water,

1055
01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:47.000
someone Yay in the United States and actually in the world.

1056
01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:50.720
Even the both know sometimes scary for me to get closer to that.
Sorry.

1057
01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:54.530
Sometimes it's scary for me that I'm that famous already.
And that you are,

1058
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:58.760
it's Martin Reese,
correct?
Yeah.
Actually it's like Porsche.
Porsche.

1059
01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:02.930
Does it annoy you?
How many people say Porsche wrong?
They should say Porsche,

1060
01:10:02.931 --> 01:10:07.490
right?
Um,
I'm brave.
Branch on you deal with it.

1061
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:12.170
We live with the snow that I want to give people the background to this.

1062
01:10:12.230 --> 01:10:16.640
So what happened was I actually saw a different,
one of your competitors,

1063
01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:19.130
a water,
someone a on CNN.

1064
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:23.990
There was a like a piece on him and he was in Asia.
Shanghai.

1065
01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:28.160
I will meet him in June.
Who is this guy?
Do you like him?
Do you hate him?
No,

1066
01:10:28.161 --> 01:10:31.850
we don't know.
I love everybody who drinks water.
Well,

1067
01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:36.900
so
I saw,

1068
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:39.890
I saw I'm wearing a water champ hat.
For those of you listening.

1069
01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:43.160
I saw this piece and I thought,
oh,
this is fascinating.

1070
01:10:43.161 --> 01:10:47.000
But then I saw it in Shanghai and I go,
ah,
well I guess that'll never happen.

1071
01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:52.600
Then I'm on Instagram and I see this 62nd piece on you and I'm watching it.

1072
01:10:53.631 --> 01:10:55.580
I'm like,
oh cool.
Another water,
someone gay.

1073
01:10:55.850 --> 01:11:00.410
And then I see in la immediately I go to your website,

1074
01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.870
it's Martin Hyphen Reese,

1075
01:11:04.150 --> 01:11:08.160
[inaudible] dot com and I email about uh,

1076
01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:13.300
a class you do like private or group clap and you hit me back and you said like,

1077
01:11:13.441 --> 01:11:17.690
you're the water champ.
How about we get together factually accurate Martin,

1078
01:11:17.730 --> 01:11:20.850
that is actually you.
You have no idea.

1079
01:11:20.890 --> 01:11:24.150
He did not write back to you and say you're the water.
Just exactly what he said.

1080
01:11:24.151 --> 01:11:28.980
I'll show you the email.
No.
Now here's the thing,
just to get people,

1081
01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:33.830
like most people know the word,
some Yay.
And that that always is,
you know,

1082
01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.350
high end restaurant.
They have a summer,

1083
01:11:35.351 --> 01:11:39.960
Yay to tell you about wines and their origin and how do you come about becoming

1084
01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:42.090
a water somewhere yet?

1085
01:11:42.190 --> 01:11:44.500
<v 9>So I have to say it started when I was a child,</v>

1086
01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:46.810
so on vacation time with my parents,

1087
01:11:46.811 --> 01:11:50.860
I tasted the different tech borders all around the world when it wasn't vacation

1088
01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:53.450
and my parents always thought like,
Hey,
what's wrong with our sandwich?

1089
01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:57.430
It's like wanting to the tap when we end the new city or something.
It's like,

1090
01:11:57.431 --> 01:12:00.600
what's what's up with him?
And for me it was like,
hey dude,

1091
01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:03.700
what do you think about the taste of the top board?
And she's like,
what?

1092
01:12:04.270 --> 01:12:07.690
It's like,
what's up?
It's like no it,
and for me as a child,

1093
01:12:07.691 --> 01:12:10.750
it was fascinating that everybody said,
yeah,
it's tap water.
And I felt like,

1094
01:12:10.751 --> 01:12:13.000
but there are so many different roles as in tap water even.

1095
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.930
Isn't it funny though,
right,

1096
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:18.680
<v 2>that this is something that basically we all,
I feel like everybody senses that,</v>

1097
01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:20.270
but you acted on it.
In other words,

1098
01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:24.530
we all tried to tap waters as a kid especially,
and you're like that,

1099
01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:27.320
but I feel like you're the one who was talking about it.

1100
01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:29.100
<v 9>I think the thing is with Kitson,</v>

1101
01:12:29.101 --> 01:12:31.450
I see it right now in my water tasting classes as well.

1102
01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:34.890
Kids love that because kits tastes pets,
uh,

1103
01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:36.810
still like super fresh.

1104
01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:39.780
They are not like completely ruined already because they didn't have too much

1105
01:12:39.781 --> 01:12:41.680
spicy food or drink or alcohol or something like this.

1106
01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:45.150
So they can really detect a lot of stuff in water.

1107
01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:50.120
<v 2>So you say that that can actually dial your palate is having spicy foods</v>

1108
01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:51.480
<v 9>drinking,
recording,</v>

1109
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:55.170
you get exposed to so many different like taste profiles and water,

1110
01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:58.770
very settling taste.
We're not talking about wine,
we're like different colors,

1111
01:12:58.771 --> 01:13:03.270
different grapes,
different vintages,
different barrel fermentations by water.

1112
01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:06.870
It's hopefully all it comes from nature and it's all about the middle content.

1113
01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:10.650
So as a child I realized what has taste and then in 2005,

1114
01:13:10.651 --> 01:13:13.230
I worked in a restaurant in Germany at the restaurant,

1115
01:13:13.231 --> 01:13:16.320
first floor and a customer came up to me and said,
hey Madden,

1116
01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:20.040
you have so many different wines but you're just serving one brand of wardrobe

1117
01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:23.550
and I don't like this particular brand.
Do you have something else for me?

1118
01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:26.950
And I was like looking at him and I thought I'd like to know what he's up seated

1119
01:13:26.951 --> 01:13:30.020
right in the restaurant business,
all about options.
You have different liquors,

1120
01:13:30.021 --> 01:13:33.150
you have different beers on tap,
you have different wines on the menu.

1121
01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:37.240
But when it comes to water the summer,
we'll ask you sparkling flood or tip,

1122
01:13:37.570 --> 01:13:41.800
what are your rights and sparkling or bottled never tap.

1123
01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:45.930
So I thought scas change it and I wanted to give options to my guests.

1124
01:13:45.931 --> 01:13:49.710
I created a water menu in 2005 so a lot of people always saying like,
oh,

1125
01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:52.050
only in la they're so gorgeous.
So many.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1126
01:13:52.051 --> 01:13:54.230
Actually I'm doing this since over 10 years now.

1127
01:13:55.410 --> 01:13:59.070
<v 2>Cool man.
And like all our water competitions aside,</v>

1128
01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:04.200
we are big fans of Wa like water in general.
Like we,
we all,

1129
01:14:04.201 --> 01:14:07.290
it started because,
you know,
we,
we were both drinking water and,

1130
01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:10.740
and had this banter back and forth about like who drinks more.

1131
01:14:10.741 --> 01:14:12.160
But the truth is I do

1132
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:15.720
<v 9>love trying out different waters and I feel like,
I dunno,</v>

1133
01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:17.140
I can't speak for the rest of the world,

1134
01:14:17.141 --> 01:14:21.580
but it's always a thing here in the United States that that argument about,

1135
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:26.170
you know,
if you go and you and you buy this water,
it's just,
that's just uh,

1136
01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:30.100
someone took their,
their,
their hose and the back and filled this thing up.
Right.

1137
01:14:30.101 --> 01:14:33.610
And you can be how many comments I had on my social media pages of all this.

1138
01:14:33.611 --> 01:14:36.270
Come on Matson,
you'll just have a big hole somewhere in your back yard.

1139
01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:37.510
You're putting all of the different,

1140
01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:40.690
different voltage shapes and then you putting all this water in the sink.
Yeah.

1141
01:14:40.691 --> 01:14:44.350
Right.
But there really is serious differences.
I mean,

1142
01:14:44.530 --> 01:14:47.800
I think the inexperienced person knows that,
that,
you know,

1143
01:14:47.801 --> 01:14:49.210
different waters taste differently,

1144
01:14:49.450 --> 01:14:54.280
but it's easiest form to explain the difference really comes down to mineral

1145
01:14:54.281 --> 01:14:58.810
content,
right?
Correct.
So it can measure by tds,
total dissolved solids.
Okay.

1146
01:14:58.811 --> 01:15:03.220
One question now,
because I grew up in La and never drink the tap water.
I mean,

1147
01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:05.830
I'm convinced it's just poison running through.

1148
01:15:05.831 --> 01:15:10.831
And so it's also like what do you buy as e what does the average person by to

1149
01:15:11.111 --> 01:15:13.720
have in their home?
So that's another thing I would ask you,

1150
01:15:13.721 --> 01:15:16.510
cause we did Sparklets for awhile and that was fine.

1151
01:15:16.511 --> 01:15:20.430
But now we have a water filtration system built into our house and that's,

1152
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:23.920
I don't know,
is it better?
So that too,
I would like to know from you.

1153
01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:26.360
So the thing is when it comes to vogue,

1154
01:15:26.361 --> 01:15:29.440
and I think the biggest important thing is that people need to understand where

1155
01:15:29.441 --> 01:15:33.730
their water's coming from.
And it is kind of sad that's here in America.

1156
01:15:33.731 --> 01:15:35.530
A lot of purified water companies,

1157
01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:39.550
I like the new hip thing and everybody thinks water should be pure.

1158
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:43.630
I'm always seeing water should not be pure because when it's completely pure,

1159
01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:47.590
you don't want to drink it because your body needs minerals all the time.

1160
01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:50.830
Like magnesium,
calcium,
potassium,
silica or this different minerals.

1161
01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:55.300
What your body cannot produce by himself.
So your body needs constantly minerals.

1162
01:15:55.330 --> 01:15:56.680
That's the reason you are hungry.

1163
01:15:56.780 --> 01:16:00.400
That's the reason you're thirsty because your body wants minerals.

1164
01:16:00.730 --> 01:16:05.730
So to have a water kind of like say a attempt water filled out everything out of

1165
01:16:06.221 --> 01:16:10.750
there and then it's like super pure water.
Pure,

1166
01:16:11.210 --> 01:16:11.560
um,

1167
01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:15.640
with zero tds is actually extremely harmful for your buddy because you have no

1168
01:16:15.641 --> 01:16:16.870
minerals,
no middle,
it's soul,

1169
01:16:16.871 --> 01:16:21.070
your body drinks that mother nature doesn't know the concept of completely pure

1170
01:16:21.071 --> 01:16:24.850
water.
It doesn't exist in mother nature.
Right?
So you're drinking that water,

1171
01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:27.970
the body things like what the hell is that?
It's like,

1172
01:16:27.971 --> 01:16:31.160
I don't even know what this element is,
not what I just drunk.
Um,

1173
01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:33.910
I need to put minerals in it to process it,
to get rid of it.

1174
01:16:34.210 --> 01:16:37.950
So you're actually dehydrating by drink distilled water.
Wow.

1175
01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:41.470
Can you and can I tell you,
because when I did drink tap water,

1176
01:16:41.471 --> 01:16:44.080
like on the emergency days when we'd run out of lit,

1177
01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:48.910
I swear I would feel thirsty or after drinking tap water.
It never,

1178
01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:53.450
but the fun thing,
and I don't want to radio your mind,
no.
Um,

1179
01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:57.670
la tap water is actually way more minerals than all the purified water
companies.

1180
01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:01.780
So when you want to stick to a mineral content drink la Tub.

1181
01:17:02.110 --> 01:17:07.000
So I think even when I would choose a bottle of like a purified water and you

1182
01:17:07.001 --> 01:17:09.920
can see it on the label,
purified water here,
what I brought,

1183
01:17:09.921 --> 01:17:12.680
it's all Springwater's and that's the only thing I always promote.

1184
01:17:12.681 --> 01:17:16.880
You have waters I've never heard of.
This is what I'm so excited about.

1185
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:21.290
I mean there's definitely,
I would say amongst,
I will call us the,

1186
01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:25.370
the regular civilians who are not in your,
uh,
your league of knowledge.

1187
01:17:25.610 --> 01:17:30.610
Everybody kind of kind of thinks that Fiji is the,

1188
01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:34.490
you know,
between,
uh,
Evian and feed you.
They're like,
those are,

1189
01:17:34.670 --> 01:17:39.110
that's high end water.
Usually you pay more for those two in a convenience store,

1190
01:17:39.111 --> 01:17:42.560
you know,
seven,
11.
And I,
I've,
in my own Palette,

1191
01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:47.620
I do feel like I taste Fiji as different than other bottled waters that are

1192
01:17:47.661 --> 01:17:50.870
around.
In other words,
the,
the whatever yellow spring,
I forget,

1193
01:17:50.871 --> 01:17:55.220
there's a Florida springs one and there's a Disani,

1194
01:17:55.430 --> 01:18:00.080
which I don't like to sing at all.
It's purified.

1195
01:18:00.081 --> 01:18:04.040
I don't like to watch them shipping everything out of there.

1196
01:18:04.041 --> 01:18:07.670
They're adding back some very small amount of minerals that amount and then

1197
01:18:07.671 --> 01:18:09.980
sending it flight price.
In my opinion,

1198
01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:12.230
the biggest scam on planet earth is Disani.
Yes,

1199
01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.930
in general for flood water companies.

1200
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:19.190
That's for me something what I drives me crazy and I came to the states in 2011

1201
01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:23.540
and I wanted to create a water menu right away and it was so hard to find real

1202
01:18:23.541 --> 01:18:24.740
Springwater's in America.

1203
01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:29.000
Of course mostly here the water's up per flight Walters and let's face it,
hey,

1204
01:18:29.001 --> 01:18:32.690
they all bind big companies and the big companies wants to make money and it's

1205
01:18:32.691 --> 01:18:33.800
quick.
I corner Denon,

1206
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:38.660
Nestle and Pepsi are the four biggest water producers in the world and they'll

1207
01:18:38.661 --> 01:18:42.410
all want to make money with us so therefore it's easier to use.

1208
01:18:42.411 --> 01:18:45.100
Just tap water filtering everything older,

1209
01:18:45.130 --> 01:18:47.540
they are adding back some minerals just for taste profile.

1210
01:18:47.541 --> 01:18:50.660
That's like the water's kind of okay and sending it for a price.

1211
01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:55.080
Therefore I'm sticking always to springwater and this is what I always recommend

1212
01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:58.220
when you're going to a grocery store.
Just check the labels.

1213
01:18:58.250 --> 01:19:02.690
Look for spring glacier or natural source mineral water and do not buy purified

1214
01:19:02.691 --> 01:19:04.550
water.
Purified water.

1215
01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:09.250
Essentially doing harm to yourself with,
I don't want to say hum,

1216
01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:10.970
but you will harm yourself.

1217
01:19:10.971 --> 01:19:15.971
Definitely buy distilled water when you're buying the gallons of distilled water

1218
01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:19.610
is created for like auto batteries.
It's for your irn.

1219
01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:24.620
It's not for consumption and in Germany they're big labels on this bottles what

1220
01:19:24.621 --> 01:19:28.370
you can buy a swan.
The grocery store do not drink.
Not for human consumption.

1221
01:19:28.670 --> 01:19:32.090
Really?
Why?
In America they are like,
yeah,
whatever.
They stood water.

1222
01:19:32.091 --> 01:19:33.110
That's so cool.
It's so pure.

1223
01:19:33.111 --> 01:19:38.111
So marketing plays a big role in private water companies is still people at the

1224
01:19:38.211 --> 01:19:41.930
gym where they get enough distilled water choking that down and then they're

1225
01:19:41.931 --> 01:19:44.800
wondering why they're suddenly like feeling not really good and why they're

1226
01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:47.290
always have headaches.
Yeah,
dehydrating the whole time.

1227
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:50.690
That's what I drank during that water cut when I was doing a a weight loss

1228
01:19:50.691 --> 01:19:54.620
contest.
You're trying to cut water.
The last few days,
the fighters,

1229
01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:59.600
they told me that the way you do it is you drink distilled water to flush your

1230
01:19:59.601 --> 01:20:02.900
toilet flushing every exactly,
but over a longer time.
Oh yeah.

1231
01:20:02.901 --> 01:20:04.370
Now it's World Health Organization.

1232
01:20:04.371 --> 01:20:09.030
Even saying it can be very harmful for your you on,
what about avi-on?

1233
01:20:09.031 --> 01:20:09.840
Is that a good one?

1234
01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:14.130
I feel like it tastes to me it just tastes so pure and good.

1235
01:20:14.131 --> 01:20:16.380
So that one's a good one.
It's so funny.
If y'all had a,

1236
01:20:16.381 --> 01:20:19.950
has a love and hate relationship to guests.
It's so funny.

1237
01:20:19.951 --> 01:20:21.650
Some people saying I love evo.

1238
01:20:21.670 --> 01:20:25.740
Some people saying I hate Avr and that is the reason why I have a water menu at

1239
01:20:25.741 --> 01:20:29.220
the restaurant is so wow.
It's actually so simple when you think about it.

1240
01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:31.080
That's actually a very simple concept.

1241
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:34.140
Can we tell the people what restaurant Patina restaurant at the Walt Disney

1242
01:20:34.141 --> 01:20:37.380
concert hall and that is a downtown Los Angeles.
Los Angeles.

1243
01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:42.170
I went to interview for a job.
Are there,
uh,
like 10 plus years ago?
Yeah.

1244
01:20:42.210 --> 01:20:44.760
My sister used to work for the Patina group that is funding.

1245
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:48.390
So she set me up and I went in for an interview and,
uh,
I didn't get the job.

1246
01:20:48.391 --> 01:20:52.500
Was it a big job fair or what was it?
No,
no,
like she like set me up for,

1247
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:57.180
I forget if it was hosting or,
um,
I dunno,
something like that.

1248
01:20:57.181 --> 01:21:00.780
I had zero restaurant experience,
but I went in and like I had on a suit and I,

1249
01:21:00.781 --> 01:21:01.351
it's so funny,

1250
01:21:01.351 --> 01:21:06.351
kind of try to say I love people who have zero experience because then I can

1251
01:21:06.391 --> 01:21:08.790
actually formed them.
That's way better for me.

1252
01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:10.740
I like people who are saying doing what Martin,

1253
01:21:11.190 --> 01:21:12.540
I never walked in the restroom before,

1254
01:21:12.541 --> 01:21:15.360
but I really are eager to do it and I'm a hot chicken guy.

1255
01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:18.480
That's for me thousand times better than people who were coming to me and say

1256
01:21:18.481 --> 01:21:21.790
like,
yeah,
I'm blocked and all this fancy places and I know way more than you.

1257
01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:25.150
That's true.
Yeah.
Right.
Oh,
this will be trouble already.
That's true.

1258
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:27.720
Laurie steakhouse downtown.

1259
01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:30.570
But then I failed the drug test cause I smoked pot the night before.

1260
01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:35.080
You did the night before she started to relax for the entire,
yeah,

1261
01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:41.250
no,
I'm excited to jump in and try some waters.
Another thing we did,

1262
01:21:41.290 --> 01:21:42.810
because we were talking about this even before you got here,

1263
01:21:42.811 --> 01:21:43.800
I definitely want to do this.

1264
01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:48.930
I have a glass of our filtered system water.
Can I give you

1265
01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:54.550
put too much in it but I wouldn't just want to see what really interesting me.

1266
01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:56.610
So the first,
the first thing,
what I'm doing,

1267
01:21:56.611 --> 01:21:59.700
and this is already when people saying like what the Hell is Martin doing?

1268
01:21:59.701 --> 01:22:01.140
Why is he looking at a glass of water?

1269
01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:05.100
And I can already see something like if there's any middle content,

1270
01:22:05.130 --> 01:22:07.540
if I can see something on the tds level,
it's,

1271
01:22:07.541 --> 01:22:10.290
but they asked like it looks pretty pure to me in this way.

1272
01:22:10.291 --> 01:22:11.700
There are some of the residuals right here,

1273
01:22:11.701 --> 01:22:15.420
but that's might be the class of Polish and Rick.
So let's see.
Smiling,

1274
01:22:15.421 --> 01:22:16.500
there's no chlorine smell.

1275
01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:20.070
So that's only a good sign because your filtration systems obviously in a good

1276
01:22:20.071 --> 01:22:24.150
shape because sometimes the problem with flotation system as well that people

1277
01:22:24.151 --> 01:22:25.860
buying themselves a filtration system,

1278
01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:29.670
but you never think about maybe changing the filters on top of it because it has

1279
01:22:29.671 --> 01:22:32.030
a light that tells me where,
okay good.
When it turns yellow,

1280
01:22:32.031 --> 01:22:35.340
why buy the filter in a lot of pictures of their filtration system in their

1281
01:22:35.341 --> 01:22:38.910
fridges and they think like,
oh,
I got my grade water from the fridge.

1282
01:22:38.911 --> 01:22:41.580
And they are like putting this for many,
many years out of the fridge.

1283
01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:43.860
Never changed their filter.
What that means.

1284
01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:47.130
The Philadelphia bucked up one at one point with all this stuff,

1285
01:22:47.131 --> 01:22:49.990
what you don't want to have in your water and then it's actually harmful right

1286
01:22:49.991 --> 01:22:52.900
by the shoulders.
So filled up that it actually poisons the water.

1287
01:22:52.930 --> 01:22:54.850
What's going on there.
So please guys,

1288
01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:59.400
when you're the filtration system at home to change your filters all the time.

1289
01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:04.450
Sure.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Going to see what we're doing here.

1290
01:23:10.150 --> 01:23:15.010
So the middle content is very low from convey this right away.
Fuck.
Um,

1291
01:23:15.730 --> 01:23:17.620
it's a,
it's a pleasant water I think to drink.

1292
01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:21.790
That's definitely the mineral content is low filtration system normal.

1293
01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:25.650
This is totally normal.
I think of if I have a filtration system at home as well,

1294
01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:29.710
so don't worry about it.
I'm using it like for showering,
for cooking,

1295
01:23:29.711 --> 01:23:30.730
for all this kinds of stuff.

1296
01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:34.600
But when it comes to adjust regular drinking on their daily basis,

1297
01:23:34.601 --> 01:23:36.970
I'm sticking to bottled water because I want to have,

1298
01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:40.690
I want to have for little the right yet swat and all of these that we're looking

1299
01:23:40.691 --> 01:23:45.270
at here,
these all are different to the pallet.
Every single one of these.
Yeah,

1300
01:23:45.550 --> 01:23:49.840
definitely.
And price wise,
like when we,
when we talk about,
um,
for instance,
wines,

1301
01:23:49.841 --> 01:23:51.340
right?
Wines,

1302
01:23:51.610 --> 01:23:55.750
people who don't buy wines a lot,
they just go,

1303
01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:58.180
that's really expensive.
Um,

1304
01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:03.360
it must be amazing and don't realize that a lot of the times what the price is

1305
01:24:03.671 --> 01:24:08.590
indicative of is the exclusivity of it.
In other words,
they make less of these,

1306
01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:11.340
therefore the price is much higher expected.
The same with volume.

1307
01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:15.820
So there's the more expensive ones are just less mass produced.

1308
01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:20.090
For example,
I brought several waters.
CN is skilled,
it's a good example for it.

1309
01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:22.790
Wine is skilled is way more expensive than maybe an if y'all,

1310
01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:26.290
what you can buy at the grocery store.
Great hoarders,
but it's skilled.

1311
01:24:26.291 --> 01:24:27.910
It produces a million bottles per year.

1312
01:24:27.970 --> 01:24:31.450
This is in the industry like nothing pillar.
Vena would laugh about that number.

1313
01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:33.760
I see.
They are pumping out a million bottles per week.

1314
01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:37.450
So for them it's just like,
what do they want it skilled.

1315
01:24:37.451 --> 01:24:41.770
It's a very small spring has been discovered by a retirement couple in 2003

1316
01:24:41.771 --> 01:24:42.100
record.

1317
01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:45.340
They wanted to build a small little vacation house in Denmark in a national

1318
01:24:45.341 --> 01:24:49.000
reservoir.
And the Danish government was saying,
yeah,
you can build your house.

1319
01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:51.880
They are,
but you cannot bring a water pipeline through our natural reservoir.

1320
01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:54.340
And they thought like,
okay,
back to the nature,
it's nice,

1321
01:24:54.341 --> 01:24:57.430
but like no water's a little bit too much for us in nature.

1322
01:24:57.910 --> 01:25:00.610
So they found a spring,
send it over to our lab and the lab said like,

1323
01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:03.400
well wait a minute,
what's up with the order?

1324
01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:07.660
There's something very unique about it.
And they thought like,
Oh shit.

1325
01:25:07.670 --> 01:25:09.790
Like maybe it's not good,
the water or something.

1326
01:25:09.791 --> 01:25:11.770
When the levers doing this whole fuss about it,

1327
01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:15.520
they found the most unique water ever been found in this bring is super,

1328
01:25:15.521 --> 01:25:20.410
super small and therefore I been to the spring for six years ago.

1329
01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:23.440
It's like the spring house is the size of this building here.

1330
01:25:23.770 --> 01:25:27.300
It's like super small and when you're thinking about this and you like,

1331
01:25:27.330 --> 01:25:29.620
you see seen this to people,
they're smiling at you and like,
yeah,

1332
01:25:29.621 --> 01:25:30.880
we found this cool watch and we've,

1333
01:25:31.050 --> 01:25:34.490
we wanted to share it with the world and now they're battling is skilled or
mean.

1334
01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:36.520
She actually ice spring and the Danish language,

1335
01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:41.820
I love this kind of stories and every water has a little story to it and I think

1336
01:25:42.581 --> 01:25:45.220
this is really cool to discover and then,
yeah,
sure you're paying like,

1337
01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:48.490
I think you can find it at Erewhon now for three or $4.

1338
01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:52.240
It's a little bit more expensive,
but it's cool.
It's a nice story to it.

1339
01:25:52.241 --> 01:25:55.540
And this is nothing what I would drink on a daily basis because hey,
I,

1340
01:25:56.170 --> 01:25:58.240
I need to watch my money as well,
like everybody else.

1341
01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:02.110
So therefore I have big gallons of arrowheads at my place.

1342
01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:04.550
That spot while I'm drinking on a daily basis or what?

1343
01:26:04.551 --> 01:26:06.200
I'm going to a grocery store like Fiji,

1344
01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:09.250
that's my go to a or arrowhead is what you're saying.

1345
01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:12.740
Spring when I'm going to a what?
A grocery store because I love Fiji water.

1346
01:26:12.741 --> 01:26:16.400
It has a very high silica content at city comics.
What?
Extremely smooth.

1347
01:26:17.010 --> 01:26:21.320
That's what it is.
C and I,
can I tell you something before this is confirmed,

1348
01:26:21.650 --> 01:26:26.650
I thought I was crazy when I would think about the idea that Fiji tasted smooth

1349
01:26:27.861 --> 01:26:31.220
to me cause that's it.
That would be the first word that I would describe it as.

1350
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:34.970
And I,
you know,
I didn't,
I didn't know any of this,

1351
01:26:34.971 --> 01:26:37.790
but it does to the Palette and your mind,
you're like this,

1352
01:26:37.791 --> 01:26:39.410
why does this taste like silky smooth?

1353
01:26:40.090 --> 01:26:44.180
This is the reason because this water has one of the highest silica content,

1354
01:26:44.181 --> 01:26:48.470
whatever been found in silicon.
Silicon.
Okay.
And that's a mineral.

1355
01:26:48.471 --> 01:26:51.260
It's a natural occurring mineral.
I love it.

1356
01:26:52.150 --> 01:26:56.780
How do you say that in German again?
Cheers.
Post,
post,
post,
post.

1357
01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:03.450
How do I do that thing you're doing?
So when,
uh,

1358
01:27:03.550 --> 01:27:07.250
when I compare it to your filtration system,
they are both on room temperature,

1359
01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:12.020
but it fuels that features more refreshing.
Yes.
It has more mental of content.

1360
01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:16.390
100%.
So the mineral content gives you that,
that feeling.

1361
01:27:16.510 --> 01:27:20.600
Do you think about a soup without salt?
Right,
right.
You'll,

1362
01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:25.550
this is like very bland and you want a little salt to kickoff the soup.

1363
01:27:25.770 --> 01:27:29.860
It's the same with water.
No water with no mineral content block.

1364
01:27:30.230 --> 01:27:35.230
It's like boom in your palate flat and it makes you thirstier like you just

1365
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:38.010
drank our house swell.
That was our house smelled

1366
01:27:40.690 --> 01:27:44.450
like apologizing.
Shitty water.
If you have to.
Totally different.

1367
01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:47.540
So you can measure,
you can measure the middle content by tds,

1368
01:27:47.541 --> 01:27:52.300
total dissolved solids.
And this water has a tds log of 222,
uh,

1369
01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:57.440
Elliot tap.
A lot of people will surprise slope between 200 and 400 tds,

1370
01:27:58.070 --> 01:28:03.070
purified water companies,
maximum of 40 tedious.
Oh,
did you see like,
oops,

1371
01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:06.080
like one of the waters,
uh,

1372
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:10.060
people think they're getting very smart when they're drinking that water.
Um,

1373
01:28:10.670 --> 01:28:14.670
by Jennifer Anderson.
Um,
uh,

1374
01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:16.130
it's actually owned by corporate corner.

1375
01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:20.090
People don't know that a lot of people drink that water but don't know it.

1376
01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:23.450
But they're putting on their labels,
edit electrolytes and everybody's like,
yeah,

1377
01:28:23.451 --> 01:28:26.510
cool.
Electrolytes,
electrolytes.
Yeah.

1378
01:28:26.620 --> 01:28:31.090
Elliot Test Pass has 10 times more electrolytes than wait.
Smart.

1379
01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:36.530
The smartwater smartwater.
Yup.
That's that nonsense.
You buy at trader Joe's.

1380
01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:39.500
So they add electrolytes,
smartwater,
heading electrolytes,

1381
01:28:39.501 --> 01:28:40.790
but in very small amounts.

1382
01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.030
And that is always the cool thing that people don't understand.
Like,
oh,

1383
01:28:44.031 --> 01:28:46.970
they edit electrolytes,
but they don't tell you how many.

1384
01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:51.970
So fishy water has way more electrolytes than smart board.
Wow.
No,

1385
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:56.270
anymore.
I mean,
Europe,
there's lots of natural springs everywhere.

1386
01:28:56.271 --> 01:28:59.360
I feel like that's a very euro thing.
Like I know my family,

1387
01:28:59.361 --> 01:29:02.940
we go to a place called Havius,
which is like on the border,
whereas in,

1388
01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:07.710
is it Austria?
And Hungary,
some natural spring,
like Europeans love their natural,

1389
01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:11.160
we swim in it,
you drink it,
you bay that to very euro.

1390
01:29:11.190 --> 01:29:14.300
I think this has something to do with the culture in Europe because like yeah,

1391
01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:18.150
just said bathing in it.
So spy areas are very famous all over Europe.

1392
01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:20.940
So people went to the spidery,
a speck in the days.

1393
01:29:20.941 --> 01:29:24.220
This one still doing it for health benefits and they want to make sure,
yes,

1394
01:29:24.221 --> 01:29:24.461
right,

1395
01:29:24.461 --> 01:29:29.100
but they want to treat themselves on water in bad thing or even by drinking.

1396
01:29:29.610 --> 01:29:33.150
Therefore they understood the concept that water is extremely important,

1397
01:29:33.330 --> 01:29:35.250
that it's actually the invention of buttered Raja.

1398
01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:39.300
The first invention was the first bottled water came from spy areas as

1399
01:29:39.301 --> 01:29:42.210
medication because medication was not prevented.

1400
01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:46.440
People went to the spider is to get healthy again or like to have a health

1401
01:29:46.441 --> 01:29:50.460
product because the waters has a lot of minerals in it like Hudson,
magnesium,

1402
01:29:50.461 --> 01:29:52.410
all this kind of minutes.
While it's extremely good for you.

1403
01:29:52.890 --> 01:29:57.420
When the people who were too sick to it,
this pub,
people started to bottle,

1404
01:29:57.421 --> 01:30:02.250
they've waters and sent them over to the sick people.
So medication was invented.

1405
01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:06.540
Bottled water.
Wasn't that amazing?
No.
These days a lot of bottled water.

1406
01:30:06.541 --> 01:30:10.440
It's more like hydration,
just hydration.
But back in the days,

1407
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:13.080
the history of bout buttered water's actually medication.

1408
01:30:13.110 --> 01:30:17.430
Do you have a number that you try to hit a as far as consumption per day?

1409
01:30:17.490 --> 01:30:21.000
Do you try to,
um,
it really depends what you're doing.

1410
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:23.220
It depends what kind of exercise you're doing.

1411
01:30:23.221 --> 01:30:27.330
So for me as a restaurant person who walks around the restaurant all the time,

1412
01:30:27.331 --> 01:30:31.260
I did the yesterday 25,000 steps on Mother's Day obviously.

1413
01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:36.360
What does that equal pay day or something like this?
Easy.

1414
01:30:36.860 --> 01:30:40.020
We were slightly busy.
Um,
I've drink a lot of water,

1415
01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:42.300
but I'm trying and this is the key as well.

1416
01:30:42.330 --> 01:30:45.800
Drink the whole time and not just think or I drink a gallon in the morning and

1417
01:30:45.801 --> 01:30:49.050
drink a gallon and you can,
that's pretty much it.
That doesn't work.

1418
01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:50.750
You need to hydrate yourself over.

1419
01:30:52.170 --> 01:30:55.440
That is the key about water and drinking water.

1420
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:58.170
Do not think you can hydrate yourself.

1421
01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:03.200
Thinks I know the water shimmers in the room as well and he was able to gallons

1422
01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:07.440
in six hours.
Yeah,
it's pretty crazy.
And I wanted to tell you a little story.

1423
01:31:07.441 --> 01:31:11.910
What has kind of like a sad story,
what happens here in California,

1424
01:31:11.970 --> 01:31:15.830
somebody had a big game and a radio show how much water you can drink at one

1425
01:31:15.890 --> 01:31:19.740
hour and that didn't work out well,
now someone died,
right?
Yep.

1426
01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:21.480
So this person,

1427
01:31:21.481 --> 01:31:26.160
we're able to drink I think 12 bottles of of leaders.

1428
01:31:26.190 --> 01:31:31.140
So 12 liters of water and one hour and the hole was,
the whole game was like,

1429
01:31:31.141 --> 01:31:33.720
hey,
try to drink so much water in this hour.

1430
01:31:33.721 --> 01:31:37.400
And then they don't pee when we,

1431
01:31:38.150 --> 01:31:39.660
we need 10 days,

1432
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:44.670
three hours later she died because you can something too much water until your

1433
01:31:44.671 --> 01:31:49.380
buddy,
your sales were like literally like over swept of it blowing up and she

1434
01:31:49.381 --> 01:31:53.610
completely drowned from inside and let us very sad.
So please guys,

1435
01:31:55.650 --> 01:31:59.100
I know,
don't overthink it.
Don't drink too much water as well.

1436
01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:02.170
That's really possibilities to obviously not drink enough.

1437
01:32:02.171 --> 01:32:05.080
Water is definitely my the other way.

1438
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:06.101
<v 0>No,</v>

1439
01:32:06.101 --> 01:32:11.020
I actually went to a urologist a few years ago and I asked him,

1440
01:32:11.230 --> 01:32:14.320
uh,
because I was like,
how much water should I be drinking?
And he goes,

1441
01:32:14.321 --> 01:32:18.140
however much you feel if you feel thirsty,
drink off.
Plus what you're saying,

1442
01:32:18.210 --> 01:32:19.043
it was like,

1443
01:32:19.150 --> 01:32:22.870
oh I thought there was this rule that I have to have eight ounces every two

1444
01:32:22.871 --> 01:32:25.660
hours or whatever bullshit.
Cause that was a thing I feel like

1445
01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:27.460
<v 9>a few years ago tried to tell you to drink so much.</v>

1446
01:32:27.670 --> 01:32:31.330
Have to have those managers per day or something like this tense when you're

1447
01:32:31.331 --> 01:32:33.190
sitting in an office and its stock,

1448
01:32:33.191 --> 01:32:36.760
you don't need so much water than people obviously worked on the street.
Right.

1449
01:32:36.761 --> 01:32:38.170
So it really depends what you're doing.

1450
01:32:38.171 --> 01:32:42.610
People who are exercise and extremely having like jobs like somewhere where they

1451
01:32:42.611 --> 01:32:45.220
like move the whole time.
It's way more water.
Yeah.

1452
01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:47.680
Then people were sitting the whole day.
Yes,
totally normal.

1453
01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:51.130
But the key is drink water.
That's the most important thing.

1454
01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:54.100
Do not start to drink sodas.
Even when you think ace,
what does this mean?

1455
01:32:54.310 --> 01:32:57.900
90% of water.
But let's face it,
all the calories here than when I read it.
Yeah.

1456
01:32:57.980 --> 01:33:00.650
<v 0>Question.
Now that brings us to our soda question.</v>

1457
01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:05.780
Loquat Lacroix liquid.
I don't know how you pronounce,
uh,
what's the,

1458
01:33:05.781 --> 01:33:07.250
is that water or is that time?

1459
01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:10.100
My husband seems to think it's more water than soda.

1460
01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:11.500
<v 9>Uh,</v>

1461
01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:14.610
there are some waters like vitamin water waters for the even claiming themselves

1462
01:33:14.650 --> 01:33:18.120
that this is water.
Let's face it.
The vitamin waters,
the soda,
sugar and sugar.

1463
01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:23.140
Wanting to know what about the zero calorie zero xe via the Cli?

1464
01:33:25.190 --> 01:33:29.050
Like are those water,
I mean they're obviously there's,
there's,

1465
01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:32.950
there's a carbonation in it.
Would you like me to get one,
couple nation to it?

1466
01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:34.990
Yeah.
So this didn't happen.
This is totally anonymous.

1467
01:33:35.010 --> 01:33:37.540
Some bottled water companies are doing this.
For example,

1468
01:33:37.541 --> 01:33:41.350
Mon Valley Springs are very good water from America.
I love that water.

1469
01:33:41.710 --> 01:33:43.750
It's a stills.
It's still spring.

1470
01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:46.660
And the adding combination too at the same actually was some Pellegrino.

1471
01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:49.360
Simply Rubino is a Stillwater.
Oh,

1472
01:33:49.361 --> 01:33:53.260
it is adding them and adding the combination to it.

1473
01:33:53.530 --> 01:33:57.370
You will not find a San Pellegrino as a still version on this planet because

1474
01:33:57.371 --> 01:34:01.350
they're marketing themselves as a sparkling water adding actually see two to
wow.

1475
01:34:01.390 --> 01:34:05.280
Wow.
Wow.
So that actually is your drinking water.
I mean that's what our water,

1476
01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:07.220
sure it's motto.
Yeah.

1477
01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:10.880
But I talk a little bit about it skilled and I think we shouldn't so excited.

1478
01:34:11.130 --> 01:34:11.680
Yeah.

1479
01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:14.350
And I said the cool story and maybe you couldn't hear it right when I'm opening

1480
01:34:14.351 --> 01:34:18.940
the bottle.
It's still,
yeah,
it's still water,

1481
01:34:18.941 --> 01:34:20.780
but still something happened right then.

1482
01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:24.270
<v 0>Now I may not use the same glasses I drank my Fijian cause that would be</v>

1483
01:34:24.271 --> 01:34:26.880
contaminating with water flavors.
Is that right?

1484
01:34:27.290 --> 01:34:31.940
<v 9>Well the minerals,
right?
They could be mineral,
mineral residue,
mix it,</v>

1485
01:34:31.941 --> 01:34:33.940
but suddenly you weren't getting something is happening.

1486
01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:38.360
And when you're looking at this class now versus the future glass before,

1487
01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:41.240
by the way,
this conversation,
I'd be like,
throw this shit out.
This is bad.

1488
01:34:41.790 --> 01:34:46.430
Like that's already something going on here.
Yeah.
And there's bubbles.

1489
01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:50.420
They love any,
but it's still a wardrobe.
So let's see what's happening.
What?

1490
01:34:50.421 --> 01:34:54.050
I'm shaking this bottle because it's a still water and I'm not just the only

1491
01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:58.250
water.
So many in America.
I'm actually the David Copperfield of waters.

1492
01:34:58.850 --> 01:35:02.940
I can do some magic with us as well.
Okay.
So I can turn this into a million.
Ah,

1493
01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:06.020
let's see.
Looks clear to you.
Yeah.
Everything is good.

1494
01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:08.640
<v 8>Here we go.</v>

1495
01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:12.900
<v 9>Right?
Wow.
That's a mineral bath dude.
No,</v>

1496
01:35:12.901 --> 01:35:16.420
I feel like I have seen.
That's crazy.
This is insane.

1497
01:35:16.421 --> 01:35:20.460
And then you see like really slowly right here.
Yeah,
it disappears.
Wow.

1498
01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:25.050
It's actually not the minerals.
What is it?
It's not Kevin of minutes.

1499
01:35:25.051 --> 01:35:29.670
What do you think guys come about?
Can it be,
nope.

1500
01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:35.190
Nope.
Air Efficiency.
Carcinogen.
Oxygen,

1501
01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:36.660
oxygen,
oxygen.

1502
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:40.740
This Walter has a high oxygen content than all waters ever been found in
Denmark.

1503
01:35:40.770 --> 01:35:43.860
That's the reason the lab was so off was this and said like what the Hell is

1504
01:35:43.861 --> 01:35:47.430
going on here?
And they found out is skilled at what I said.

1505
01:35:47.970 --> 01:35:51.120
I spring in the Danish language,
they found out that this is a very,

1506
01:35:51.121 --> 01:35:55.630
very old springwater around 7,500 year old,
but we have in this class.
Right.

1507
01:35:56.230 --> 01:36:01.000
And the cool thing about this is that cold water holds more oxygen than warm

1508
01:36:01.001 --> 01:36:02.310
water does.
That's the reason.

1509
01:36:02.311 --> 01:36:04.890
Sometimes New York in the winter time when you open the tap water,

1510
01:36:05.130 --> 01:36:07.380
it's sometimes cloudy as well.
And then that's what I'm thinking.

1511
01:36:07.390 --> 01:36:12.390
I've stayed in hotels where that type of thing happens and I go,

1512
01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:14.010
I'm not drinking this shit.

1513
01:36:15.850 --> 01:36:20.310
But that's my first thought types are exposed to extremely cold temperatures

1514
01:36:20.311 --> 01:36:24.900
outside.
Yeah.
And that's the reason this water turns into this very cloudy,

1515
01:36:25.470 --> 01:36:27.360
cloudy Brian,
uh,

1516
01:36:27.630 --> 01:36:31.950
tastewise any heads up on what we're going to experience as opposed to the,

1517
01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:34.790
I always say as Tom Mcgee would be a bad,
somebody,

1518
01:36:34.791 --> 01:36:37.350
one of you tell her you're right away,
right.
What you think,

1519
01:36:37.351 --> 01:36:38.660
what the taste would be.
Okay.

1520
01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:42.330
So I think you should discover if you'll see something at,
and be honest,

1521
01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:46.400
maybe you see like some people have a hard time to divine feature versus skilled

1522
01:36:46.410 --> 01:36:51.030
it.
So she has goes cheers.
Oh my God.
No,
totally different.

1523
01:36:52.910 --> 01:36:53.780
<v 8>Totally different.</v>

1524
01:36:56.710 --> 01:37:00.130
<v 9>Especially the after taste.
The aftertaste is very distinct.</v>

1525
01:37:01.450 --> 01:37:01.970
<v 8>Okay.</v>

1526
01:37:01.970 --> 01:37:06.740
<v 9>It smells like Europe is reminds me of of going to like a thermal bath or</v>

1527
01:37:06.741 --> 01:37:07.271
mineral bad,

1528
01:37:07.271 --> 01:37:12.140
whatever it with my parents that Fiji still has a much more like when I do it

1529
01:37:12.141 --> 01:37:13.910
right after,
especially a much,

1530
01:37:13.950 --> 01:37:17.120
the smoothness is still stands out as very different.

1531
01:37:17.330 --> 01:37:19.310
It does have like a 10 year or whatever.

1532
01:37:19.311 --> 01:37:22.210
I don't know how to describe it after taste.
Right.
You're like,
oh that's a,

1533
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:25.690
there's a minerals.
Yes,
definitely.
Yeah.
There's sodium contents we hired.

1534
01:37:25.730 --> 01:37:30.730
The tds is no 400 so it's almost a double of the mineral content or Fiji and

1535
01:37:31.850 --> 01:37:35.840
interesting.
What I think of especially about the aftertaste a of skilled,

1536
01:37:35.841 --> 01:37:37.700
it has like the slightly earthy notes to it.

1537
01:37:38.090 --> 01:37:40.970
Like think about a mushroom or something like this that's familiar.

1538
01:37:40.971 --> 01:37:45.140
There's things just taste a skilled that I've been in China last year and a big

1539
01:37:45.141 --> 01:37:49.440
water tastes and competition and I had to taste 80 different Walters blind.
Why?

1540
01:37:49.470 --> 01:37:54.380
Say they gave me just the glasses like this and then drink it and then I hit to

1541
01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:58.290
cavort like what I think about the water.
They gave me a skilled and I will,

1542
01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:01.890
I knew right away it's a skill you did.
Yup.
I had 100% right away.

1543
01:38:01.891 --> 01:38:05.220
I gave her 100% or a hundred points to it as skilled as well because for me it's

1544
01:38:05.221 --> 01:38:07.760
one of the best waters I ever tasted a.

1545
01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:10.170
For me it's just like there's so much characteristic in it.

1546
01:38:10.171 --> 01:38:14.040
I love the idea about the oxygen level as well that this water turns into like

1547
01:38:14.041 --> 01:38:17.730
the slightly milkiness to it.
It's just mind blowing water.

1548
01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:20.670
That's a me and then to be clear,
did you say this is,

1549
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.430
you can get it three or $4 Arrow
get that.

1550
01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:28.470
That is,
it's pretty cool.
I mean that's a really cool thing.

1551
01:38:28.471 --> 01:38:31.950
I think it's a very accessible price point for an experience.
In other words,

1552
01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:35.110
somebody wants to try this like it's three or four bucks.

1553
01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:36.001
We can definitely do it.

1554
01:38:36.001 --> 01:38:39.690
We're not talking about like the headwaters for over $75 already.

1555
01:38:39.710 --> 01:38:42.810
What the most expensive one I ever drank his hundred thousand dollars

1556
01:38:44.850 --> 01:38:49.400
I did this with Diplo and two Chainz
with Diplo and to change.
Yes,

1557
01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:53.540
you can see it for Gq magazine,
the most expensive shit or his digged it.

1558
01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:55.710
Did that come out of,
why is it a hundred grand?

1559
01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:59.670
You can see it almost 8 million clicks or any of the words.
It's hilarious.

1560
01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:01.050
Where's it from?
Yeah.

1561
01:39:01.170 --> 01:39:06.170
Then actually it's from California dog right away at all.

1562
01:39:08.010 --> 01:39:13.010
It's Beverly hills nine or each tool with 50 white diamonds on the cab is so

1563
01:39:16.290 --> 01:39:20.390
right.
The water itself is very good as well.
Um,

1564
01:39:20.610 --> 01:39:23.290
but obviously this is more like a funny,
cool idea.

1565
01:39:23.570 --> 01:39:26.990
Just create a very crazy priced diamond water.
Um,

1566
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.500
I don't know if you watch that reality show that,
can you,
can you infuse,

1567
01:39:31.530 --> 01:39:32.490
does it matter if you

1568
01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:37.080
see a boat when you believe in something?

1569
01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:41.270
That's a very diplomatic answer from Marta and I'm like,

1570
01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:43.560
it's all about minerals for me.
It's for me in the middle.

1571
01:39:43.561 --> 01:39:46.980
It's a scientific fact that water has middles dissolved.
Of course,

1572
01:39:46.981 --> 01:39:51.140
it comes from the disc rounds,
borders.
Tara.
Fascinating.
Um,

1573
01:39:51.330 --> 01:39:55.320
what's up with Hilden?
What's,
that's our next one.
Our next one.

1574
01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:58.830
So we need to save some glasses so I will see a little less guilty.
Okay.

1575
01:39:58.831 --> 01:40:03.240
How do you say water champion in German?
Durvasa champion.

1576
01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:06.900
Diversity champion.
Yeah.
So Hilton is a sparkling water

1577
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:13.860
and this is the official reward of the Queen.
She drinks this water all the time.

1578
01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:19.440
This is the queens,
the queens water.
And is it,
where's it from?
Uh,
from England.

1579
01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:20.273
A spot.

1580
01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:23.100
And you have to be a little careful because when you're drinking too much Hilton

1581
01:40:23.101 --> 01:40:26.450
water,
your arms have any,
we'll do like this or like this.
Yeah,

1582
01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:33.020
I do see a distinctive snow bubbles.
Bubbles.
And they're bigger.
They're,

1583
01:40:33.070 --> 01:40:37.890
they look like they're big bubbles.
Bubbles.
And again,
like in the beginning,

1584
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:41.040
everybody watched me looking at the glass and now you guys doing this as well.

1585
01:40:41.041 --> 01:40:43.020
But of course you can already see,
okay.

1586
01:40:43.110 --> 01:40:46.290
Obviously we're talking here about a carbonated water and the collage,

1587
01:40:46.291 --> 01:40:50.360
what I would say to it right now,
it's pretty big,
interesting fact about this.

1588
01:40:50.450 --> 01:40:53.290
Just that the carbonation levels actually very low,

1589
01:40:53.650 --> 01:40:58.330
but it's just like some big bubbles in Zoloft in that water.

1590
01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:02.350
But it's not like this progressive like maybe a girl or from Germany or some
pig.

1591
01:41:02.351 --> 01:41:05.650
We know what has like tons of bottles.
I hate hands bubbles.

1592
01:41:05.770 --> 01:41:09.940
This is like gently spark.
Well she's the queen man.
She is.
Cheers,
pops,

1593
01:41:10.150 --> 01:41:14.500
pops.
I love it.

1594
01:41:14.540 --> 01:41:18.340
See and to me this is so European to American bottled waters.

1595
01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:23.500
I mean the sparkling water is never taste the subtle and the court telling your

1596
01:41:23.621 --> 01:41:25.660
right away as well.
What's actually in here.

1597
01:41:26.170 --> 01:41:29.800
And this is kind of sad that low slowly the purified water companies,

1598
01:41:29.801 --> 01:41:32.290
especially again,
they don't tell you at all what they're adding.

1599
01:41:32.710 --> 01:41:36.610
He had says right away,
magnesium content,
1.7 cards,

1600
01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:41.620
Yom 97 sodium 7.7 chloride 60 and fluoride a to 12 degrees,

1601
01:41:41.831 --> 01:41:43.660
the 0.02.
So it's super low.

1602
01:41:44.050 --> 01:41:47.050
What it should be in water because fluoride is not really something what you'll

1603
01:41:47.370 --> 01:41:51.610
want to want to drink the whole time and totally self taught a 312 so they're

1604
01:41:51.611 --> 01:41:54.430
adding this right away.
Honestly,
I think the biggest eye opener,

1605
01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:58.300
at least for me and I think I imagine for people listening is the idea that

1606
01:41:58.450 --> 01:42:02.620
reading that there's things in your water doesn't an equal,
uh,

1607
01:42:02.770 --> 01:42:05.830
automatically or in any way necessarily bad thing.

1608
01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:09.550
Cause I think every one of us probably who doesn't know,
oh that's bad.

1609
01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:14.030
I want minerals.
Pure concept is crazy silliness.

1610
01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:19.320
I would drink a lot more sparkling water if it weren't for the saltiness,

1611
01:42:19.691 --> 01:42:23.740
the sodium content.
I find that a lot of them are very salty.

1612
01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:29.440
You can feel it will be tough for you guys cause those are salty waters.

1613
01:42:30.430 --> 01:42:31.330
So would you consider it,

1614
01:42:31.331 --> 01:42:36.331
so is this a nice option if you're going to go for a sparkling water,

1615
01:42:36.370 --> 01:42:39.620
would you say that I love Philip.

1616
01:42:39.990 --> 01:42:44.080
The sodium content is very low.
It's not that salty.
The bubbles are very tiny.

1617
01:42:44.350 --> 01:42:47.380
It's not like this progressive in your palate that spoken easily.

1618
01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:49.390
Chuffed on this bottle and it's not like that.

1619
01:42:49.391 --> 01:42:52.300
You're like feeling like blowing up right away.

1620
01:42:52.450 --> 01:42:56.500
Now can I ask you how you have a water menu that you offer?

1621
01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:01.360
I feel like we go to a lot of Nice restaurants and travel a lot and still,

1622
01:43:01.361 --> 01:43:05.560
even in high end restaurants,
I get the question tab still or sparkling.

1623
01:43:05.570 --> 01:43:07.330
In other words,
there's no other,

1624
01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:11.110
is the options thing going to be developing more you think in restaurants?

1625
01:43:11.410 --> 01:43:12.190
I really hope so.

1626
01:43:12.190 --> 01:43:16.190
And I think the first concept is that people need to understand that they should

1627
01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:19.610
drink more water.
And finally in America,
a bottled waters,

1628
01:43:19.630 --> 01:43:22.360
the most consumed product now and sorta not anymore.

1629
01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:26.420
So this is already amazing since 2016 bottled water is the number one consumer

1630
01:43:26.421 --> 01:43:28.900
product.
And I love this,
I love to hear this.

1631
01:43:28.901 --> 01:43:31.930
Or obviously the Americans understand that sorta this might be not the best

1632
01:43:31.931 --> 01:43:34.810
choice to drink antitrust yourself on it.
Yeah,
no.

1633
01:43:34.811 --> 01:43:38.740
The next step is to understand that water is not just water.
Yeah.

1634
01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:42.350
And that they are big water tea or at differences.
And again,
some water,

1635
01:43:42.351 --> 01:43:45.330
they're coming from an ethical source that's actually nothing other than UTEP

1636
01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:45.621
border.

1637
01:43:45.621 --> 01:43:49.990
So just drink tip and save the money or other water's coming from the different

1638
01:43:49.991 --> 01:43:53.600
regions of the world and therefore their tastes differently.
Wow.

1639
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:58.160
That's the whole coastline.
My mind.
This is blowing my mind.
Um,
so let's see.

1640
01:43:58.161 --> 01:44:00.470
This is,
is this a sparkling water or your best?
That's a sprocket.

1641
01:44:00.471 --> 01:44:04.160
Walter Vichy Catalan fishy colon is like the arrowhead have spent,

1642
01:44:04.190 --> 01:44:08.150
this is the number one consumed sparkling water and Spain.
Uh,

1643
01:44:08.151 --> 01:44:10.580
I've been on Conan O'brien as well for 12 years ago.

1644
01:44:11.510 --> 01:44:15.530
I did a water tasting with him and he spit out that water.
Really?
Yup.

1645
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:17.630
It was like,
what the hell is going on here?

1646
01:44:17.870 --> 01:44:21.980
It's like he didn't believe me that this is coming from nature.
Wow.

1647
01:44:22.740 --> 01:44:26.810
Did he really?
Yeah.
He thought I put like an aspirin.
And this is,
um,

1648
01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:28.570
this is,
uh,

1649
01:44:28.730 --> 01:44:32.780
produced in Spain are the words that hundred miles up north from Barcelona is

1650
01:44:32.781 --> 01:44:35.340
the spring located.
It's a spring.
It's a spring of water,

1651
01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:37.760
a hundred percent spring water.
Natural Queen comes,

1652
01:44:37.761 --> 01:44:41.150
raises up 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
What's a super hot spring?

1653
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:44.660
What writes up the water?
So we had a very cold spring is skilled versus nowhere.

1654
01:44:44.661 --> 01:44:46.270
Very hot spring.
Vichy Catalan up.

1655
01:44:47.010 --> 01:44:51.360
You'll see the buttons already have way more progressive than in the Hilton or

1656
01:44:51.361 --> 01:44:54.020
they look at Hilton right now.
There are almost no bubbles anymore.

1657
01:44:54.021 --> 01:44:55.730
It feels like there's really something going on.

1658
01:44:55.900 --> 01:44:57.980
<v 8>Okay,
awesome.</v>

1659
01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:07.260
<v 9>Oh my goodness dude.
That is like an explosion of saltiness.</v>

1660
01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:12.150
Oh yeah.
It's a very bitter at the end.
Very salty.
I also,

1661
01:45:12.151 --> 01:45:15.260
by the way,
what quality is it?
Cause now I can,
I can,

1662
01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:21.080
it takes me back now that I've had Stillwater in traveling that has some of that

1663
01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:27.290
taste.
Is that,
is that the sodium?
The sodium.
So yes,

1664
01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:29.870
the soldier was the first thing you can,
you can get it over with.

1665
01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:33.180
That's really strong.
And this is right away.

1666
01:45:33.181 --> 01:45:36.750
We talking about over a thousand milligrams of salt.
Salty.
It's crazy.

1667
01:45:36.780 --> 01:45:39.920
The tds level is mind blowing.
3050.
Why?

1668
01:45:40.270 --> 01:45:43.470
It has more electrolytes than a Gatorade.
It's going on with the Spaniards.
Sam,

1669
01:45:43.471 --> 01:45:45.660
where are they doing?
What's wrong with it?
The reason they're,
so I'd rate it.

1670
01:45:45.670 --> 01:45:48.180
Maybe.
Maybe it's facing the Spanish people.

1671
01:45:48.181 --> 01:45:51.000
That's the reason they love this water.
It's super hot outside in Spain,

1672
01:45:51.150 --> 01:45:52.950
like here in La.
Um,

1673
01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:55.980
so you're spending all the time and when you're sweating you're losing minerals.

1674
01:45:56.100 --> 01:45:58.550
Yeah,
that's pretty much because that's the reason you were spared a salty.

1675
01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:01.800
So when you compare a fissure colon and drink this all the time,

1676
01:46:01.950 --> 01:46:05.630
you're getting all your middle Spec.
Wow.
The thing is what you cannot do,

1677
01:46:05.730 --> 01:46:08.880
a lot of people always seem like,
oh just bottled water and then you'll be fine.

1678
01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:13.440
That doesn't work as well because we all know around two days it takes her to

1679
01:46:13.710 --> 01:46:17.310
dehydrate and then you will die after two or three days and after two or three

1680
01:46:17.311 --> 01:46:20.700
weeks you will die because you didn't hit any food.
So your body,

1681
01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:24.330
the most mineral,
it's what your body needs comes from food.
But growth and food,

1682
01:46:24.331 --> 01:46:27.730
there's way more minutes actually then bottled water,
right?
But bottled waters,

1683
01:46:27.750 --> 01:46:31.350
a core theme because the middle told where you dissolved s water.

1684
01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:34.560
So it's very easy to access is for your buddy.
The middles.

1685
01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:39.030
Cause you don't need really to process it.
And let's think about alkaline water.

1686
01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:42.950
Everybody talks about color.
So important align.
That's a very,

1687
01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:47.130
it's also very trendy right now.
Very Trendy head needs to be balanced.

1688
01:46:47.131 --> 01:46:48.930
And some people are saying,
I can land.

1689
01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:53.040
You can balance out your body with this because your body is acidic because

1690
01:46:53.041 --> 01:46:54.360
you're eating so much acidic food.

1691
01:46:54.630 --> 01:46:59.070
And with an iCloud you can balance Rgo your body Ph and then your healthy

1692
01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:04.880
completely bullshit goes and not to live in that literary crap because when you

1693
01:47:06.091 --> 01:47:08.520
drink water,
what we just did,
it goes into your stomach.

1694
01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:14.060
So your stomach is up with fluid and the seventh note is extremely acidic.

1695
01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:19.170
So water will turn like this acidic.
So that whole idea about,

1696
01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:23.150
or you can balance out something with a Ph level is completely nonsense.

1697
01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:28.140
Highly upset.
Your stomach is,
has a break down their food.
Therefore,

1698
01:47:28.141 --> 01:47:31.910
this whole idea about I can land water,
do not believe in this whole claims.

1699
01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:32.251
By the way,

1700
01:47:32.251 --> 01:47:35.820
I can't believe how we haven't put this together yet with Martin here.
Uh,

1701
01:47:35.850 --> 01:47:37.650
do you know this clip?

1702
01:47:48.190 --> 01:47:49.023
<v 4>The</v>

1703
01:47:54.580 --> 01:47:55.240
Dry?
It's

1704
01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:57.400
<v 9>a German man.
He also is there,</v>

1705
01:47:58.540 --> 01:48:00.580
but he's providing the seas first in a different way.

1706
01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:04.950
I wanted you to know what kind of show you were on it.
You're like,

1707
01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:07.730
we've misled on playboy radio.
Okay.

1708
01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:12.020
And when the bunnies had this water in their mouth,
they're also like,
oh,

1709
01:48:12.021 --> 01:48:15.130
it tastes like,
Oh really?
Like

1710
01:48:17.980 --> 01:48:21.390
10 times worse than that.
100 times we're going.

1711
01:48:21.391 --> 01:48:23.120
Then we have

1712
01:48:26.650 --> 01:48:31.490
crazy one that blew my mind.
No,
this start of a little taste.

1713
01:48:31.950 --> 01:48:36.400
Wow.
Let's go move on.
So your Palette,

1714
01:48:36.550 --> 01:48:38.950
I mean you have to keep it so sensitive.

1715
01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:43.690
How do you maintain your palate flavor?
You're,
I don't drink any hard liquor.

1716
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:47.200
No hard liquor.
Don't want chemo cocktails.
I cannot stand cocktail.

1717
01:48:47.230 --> 01:48:50.350
There's too much sugar.
That's the reason I don't like cocktails.

1718
01:48:51.070 --> 01:48:54.970
I don't drink hard liquor at all.
I love wine and sparkling wines.

1719
01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.630
This is like what I'm drinking when I've like to boost up.
How about coffee?

1720
01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:03.160
No coffee.
What is that for your palate for?
Just kind of like the taste.

1721
01:49:03.161 --> 01:49:06.910
It's too bitter for me.
Maybe every coffee I tasted so far is always just bitter.

1722
01:49:07.330 --> 01:49:08.410
And I think my palette,

1723
01:49:08.430 --> 01:49:12.700
it's just like involved over so many years not to drink so much water that my

1724
01:49:12.701 --> 01:49:15.040
palace extremely sensitive.
I want to ask someone,

1725
01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:19.480
will you grab from the fridge a z via and Alliqua?
Yep.
Thank you.

1726
01:49:19.810 --> 01:49:24.310
The cool thing as well is about drinking water.
And I hit this with the Sagat.

1727
01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:28.090
I had a video,
it's on youtube as well with a girl from Zagat and weird tasting,

1728
01:49:28.091 --> 01:49:31.720
different waters and she never drank so much water and you'll seeing the end of

1729
01:49:31.721 --> 01:49:36.370
the video,
she's,
she feels like wasted now.
She didn't have any Oklahoma,

1730
01:49:36.580 --> 01:49:39.450
but she fits like she started to a tickling and like,

1731
01:49:40.450 --> 01:49:43.570
and it's like I got drunk and she's like,
I don't know,

1732
01:49:43.571 --> 01:49:46.330
but I feel like a little tipsy tipsy.

1733
01:49:46.750 --> 01:49:50.920
And I think it was like she might be as a person who doesn't drink so much water

1734
01:49:50.921 --> 01:49:51.754
all the time.

1735
01:49:51.790 --> 01:49:56.200
Then I exposed her to so much water and too extremely high mineral content.

1736
01:49:56.201 --> 01:49:59.080
Water that's her body was like really reacting to it.

1737
01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:02.980
It feels like she was like on a stats.
Bizarre.
Crazy.

1738
01:50:03.020 --> 01:50:05.560
But as you can see it on youtube,
it's kind of,
it's kind of funny.

1739
01:50:06.010 --> 01:50:09.910
He really says like in the camera thing,
I feel really drunk.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1740
01:50:10.090 --> 01:50:13.810
And water has an impact on your buddies?
Absolutely is.
It's crazy and it's cool.

1741
01:50:14.110 --> 01:50:17.800
Um,
are we brought these in because this Christina made a good point.
Like what,

1742
01:50:18.430 --> 01:50:23.080
what is going on with these?
Um,
I know that La Quilla exist.

1743
01:50:23.110 --> 01:50:25.930
I have to say I never had it before.
It's so funny.

1744
01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:31.360
I know their big sodium free.
Yeah.
And the Z Veo one there,

1745
01:50:31.361 --> 01:50:34.720
the one that he just put on that table,
um,
it has,

1746
01:50:34.721 --> 01:50:36.310
it's the contents on it as well.

1747
01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:39.400
The funny thing is here they don't tell you where this water is extra coming

1748
01:50:39.401 --> 01:50:41.620
from.
That's always a red flag always for me.
Okay.

1749
01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:46.680
Cause ingredients cabin in the L'aquila natural brand is in Wisconsin and I

1750
01:50:47.801 --> 01:50:52.480
assume that they,
they make and bottle it and everything there.
Sure.

1751
01:50:52.810 --> 01:50:55.120
Are you sure it's from Wisconsin?
Yeah,
that's why.

1752
01:50:55.121 --> 01:50:58.180
That's the whole argument for why it's called the Detroit Blah,
blah blah.

1753
01:50:58.210 --> 01:51:02.320
Warren Michigan is here,
this distribution distribution.
Right.

1754
01:51:02.350 --> 01:51:04.980
But they don't tell you where the spring is located off of.
Let's see.

1755
01:51:04.990 --> 01:51:07.930
So we don't know if this is a spring water or a purified water.

1756
01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:13.420
So we have no clue.
Gosh,
now we like this beverage.

1757
01:51:13.421 --> 01:51:17.620
It's an alternative to soda.
We don't drink sugar.
So it always is not extreme.

1758
01:51:17.621 --> 01:51:21.730
Your Shield.
And the problem is when you're,
when you're shutting something down,

1759
01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:25.610
I know it's like refreshing,
but you can really taste anything anymore.

1760
01:51:25.700 --> 01:51:28.750
But of course when you are shooting down at beverage in general,

1761
01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:33.310
like even wines extremely,
the taste of aromas or like disappearing a little bit.

1762
01:51:33.311 --> 01:51:37.000
Yeah.
So let's see.
We should bring this on on a little temperature too.

1763
01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:39.930
So there's definitely a smell right away.
Yeah,

1764
01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:43.630
it's like it has like a blue berries,
fruity smell to it.

1765
01:51:44.190 --> 01:51:45.023
<v 8>Hmm.</v>

1766
01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:52.930
<v 9>Yeah.
It tastes extremely sweet.
[inaudible] extremely sweet though.</v>

1767
01:51:52.931 --> 01:51:54.070
It has very tiny bubbles.

1768
01:51:56.670 --> 01:52:01.650
You cannot taste water from this.
Right?
There's a artificials and this is for me,

1769
01:52:01.651 --> 01:52:06.090
artificial flavors.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You can see it a small home.
Like it's Cleo,

1770
01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:08.130
so it's water.
Yeah.

1771
01:52:08.670 --> 01:52:12.450
But obviously they are adding some artificial flavors and let's face it,

1772
01:52:12.451 --> 01:52:16.530
this is highly processed food.
This is nothing else.

1773
01:52:16.531 --> 01:52:17.580
Been highly processed food.

1774
01:52:18.010 --> 01:52:21.190
So this is stuff what you're like when you like the big muff from Mcdonald's.

1775
01:52:21.191 --> 01:52:25.590
That's might be the water to go.
Oh my God.
Oh,
look into took it there.

1776
01:52:25.591 --> 01:52:28.170
Look at their,
their website.
Where does the water originate?

1777
01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:33.680
American brand using water source from the U S it's pure fun days when they're

1778
01:52:34.250 --> 01:52:38.780
saying this,
that's means it's actually template.
Look at this.
Oh look,

1779
01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:43.620
I don't want to say using a triple filtration system.
Here we go.
Yup.

1780
01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:46.220
Yup.
It's crap.
Yeah.

1781
01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:51.460
<v 2>It's stripped of any mineral and this is what I thought.
Yeah.
Now try the Z.</v>

1782
01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:54.200
Cause my husband's convinced that he's drinking water when he's drinking.

1783
01:52:54.201 --> 01:52:56.960
Zbs going to be even sweeter.
Sorry if he thinks,

1784
01:52:57.720 --> 01:53:01.400
if he thinks the sweeteners,
no artificial sweeteners,

1785
01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:05.930
no water for sweetness,
but no atrophy of the flavors.
That doesn't,

1786
01:53:05.950 --> 01:53:10.260
that doesn't say that.
It doesn't say that
now.

1787
01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:15.050
I mean [inaudible] was sweet to him.
Oh No.
Very sweet.
This is another world.

1788
01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:18.180
Curious to see what happens.
You look at all the great oxygen,

1789
01:53:18.181 --> 01:53:19.210
it looks like I saw it already.

1790
01:53:20.490 --> 01:53:24.930
It looks like a soda when you're pouring this now.
Yeah.

1791
01:53:25.850 --> 01:53:28.020
It's naturally flavored as a soap in.

1792
01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:31.970
It makes you stronger and you're going to feel better.

1793
01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:40.070
It's not like Dr Pepper.
Uh,
that's like the smell.

1794
01:53:40.071 --> 01:53:44.300
It's like Doc Sherry,
I think of black cherry.
Yeah.
Lecturey it's natural.

1795
01:53:44.301 --> 01:53:49.100
It's all natural.
It's all they saying natural flavors.
No artificial stuff in it.

1796
01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:53.000
Right.
I apologize.
Yep.
Saying this on camera and radio,

1797
01:53:54.270 --> 01:53:55.103
<v 8>but</v>

1798
01:53:56.770 --> 01:54:00.270
<v 2>it's a good,
it's a good review.
So far he said,
oh Jesus.
Yeah.</v>

1799
01:54:03.010 --> 01:54:06.730
Oh,
I agree.
I agree.

1800
01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:09.460
Loves it will give you a case on the way

1801
01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:17.290
Pepsi Crystal.
There was a thing.

1802
01:54:18.570 --> 01:54:20.850
Whereas it's like,

1803
01:54:22.850 --> 01:54:26.290
I need to clean your power or something else.
Yeah,
we should.
I'm paying,

1804
01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:28.990
my husband considers this drinking water.

1805
01:54:28.991 --> 01:54:31.750
Do you know that when he drinks this he goes,
it's like drinking water.

1806
01:54:31.810 --> 01:54:35.560
This is nothing to do with Walter guys.
What is it?
What is it?
Moded I mean,

1807
01:54:35.561 --> 01:54:38.630
I know you don't know.
It's the same word.

1808
01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:42.100
I think Pepsi Crystal was crystal was a coke with no color.

1809
01:54:42.340 --> 01:54:46.990
This looks like a sorta with no color for me.
Here's why people are

1810
01:54:49.020 --> 01:54:53.560
the,
there's no artificial sweeteners,
no sugar,

1811
01:54:53.590 --> 01:54:55.690
so people are drinking.

1812
01:54:55.970 --> 01:55:00.010
It's become a popular beverage because it's like you're having a soda
experience,

1813
01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:04.690
but you're not getting that glucose spike in your sugar.
Disgusting.

1814
01:55:04.691 --> 01:55:08.330
Now I don't like them.
I don't drink them.
But always see there's like artificial,

1815
01:55:08.910 --> 01:55:13.300
no,
but obviously they need to do something with something to uh,
to put some,

1816
01:55:14.050 --> 01:55:14.741
I think it's religious,

1817
01:55:14.741 --> 01:55:17.950
like Jesus blesses it or something and then it has a fence.
Whatever.

1818
01:55:17.951 --> 01:55:21.850
It's in there.
But I know,
okay,
let's move it along.

1819
01:55:23.340 --> 01:55:27.580
That was hilarious.
So we should kind of learn.

1820
01:55:27.581 --> 01:55:32.500
It's like a beautiful mountain with no choice.
No,
I know.
So far there's one,

1821
01:55:32.501 --> 01:55:37.450
two,
three,
four,
five bottles that I'd never even heard of,
which is so cool.

1822
01:55:37.690 --> 01:55:41.880
And there's two more that we haven't yet.
So we have Roy as an fund form

1823
01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:44.430
from Slovenia

1824
01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:48.210
<v 9>now.
Yeah,
it's my cousin though.
Video.
Are these,</v>

1825
01:55:48.211 --> 01:55:53.211
by the way available at Patina or are these or some of them v She's available to

1826
01:55:54.381 --> 01:55:59.160
Hilton is available.
Features available and is skilled is available.
Um,
Roy,

1827
01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:03.120
you guys are the only people in the whole United States.
We have a bottle excess,

1828
01:56:03.121 --> 01:56:06.180
right?
What?
Nobody else has.
Roy.

1829
01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:09.650
This is so exciting when the guy who has access to this room,

1830
01:56:10.110 --> 01:56:13.350
I know the the the owner very well here,

1831
01:56:13.390 --> 01:56:18.000
also hotel in Slovenia and they found off this,
the spring is extremely old.

1832
01:56:18.001 --> 01:56:19.770
I have to be a little careful actually as well.

1833
01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:22.890
You should see it because it looks like all,
okay.
When I'm open this,

1834
01:56:22.891 --> 01:56:26.750
this really like something going on.
Oh yeah.
Collected at the bottom.

1835
01:56:26.751 --> 01:56:29.340
You can see and you know this thing stays like this.

1836
01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:34.470
So this is like how it's naturally,
this is natural.
It's wonderful.

1837
01:56:35.070 --> 01:56:36.720
You can actually see the flakes.

1838
01:56:37.230 --> 01:56:39.900
The men are also at the bottom and it looks like a Sorta as well when I'm

1839
01:56:39.901 --> 01:56:44.160
pouring it.
Whoa,

1840
01:56:44.190 --> 01:56:48.120
that's cool.
You can see like old residues snow right down here.

1841
01:56:48.570 --> 01:56:52.170
What does not happen?
So don't worry guys.
It's all good.
It's all natural.

1842
01:56:52.530 --> 01:56:55.800
Hundred percent of that.
Just like z can see like here the bottle,

1843
01:56:55.830 --> 01:56:59.200
like what's happening here?
It's crazy.
What is going on now?

1844
01:56:59.220 --> 01:57:03.930
Is it that the mineral level is so high that that's what the flakes are?

1845
01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:08.040
Yes,
but it's still safe to drink.
Yeah,
that's totally fine.
It's from a spring.

1846
01:57:08.420 --> 01:57:11.040
It just cheers.
Cheers.

1847
01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:16.440
Here we go.
Oh No.

1848
01:57:16.441 --> 01:57:19.800
It just as beautiful as German.
Oh my God.

1849
01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:24.090
Oh my goodness.
I love this.
You know,
when I go to Hungary,

1850
01:57:24.091 --> 01:57:27.360
I feel like this is the kind of stuff that when you ask for sparkling,

1851
01:57:27.361 --> 01:57:32.100
this is what you get.
You get actually,
yeah,
it does.
It is like distinctly the,

1852
01:57:32.101 --> 01:57:34.380
the high sodium feels to me European,

1853
01:57:34.730 --> 01:57:38.460
but there are something else in that water.
It's not just the sodium.

1854
01:57:39.870 --> 01:57:41.250
Very metallic taste to it.

1855
01:57:41.970 --> 01:57:45.060
And this water has the highest mechanism content,

1856
01:57:45.061 --> 01:57:48.160
whatever been found in a spring water.
Wow.
Um,

1857
01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:51.570
what do you think the tds level of softness,
let's recap a little bit.

1858
01:57:51.870 --> 01:57:56.640
Fishy 222 a tds is skilled.
It was fun or tds.
He doesn't,

1859
01:57:56.641 --> 01:58:01.641
we went back to a 312 Vishy 3050 3000 throwing 5,000 plus 5,000 the price is

1860
01:58:03.391 --> 01:58:06.720
right here.
You,
I would go even higher.
Seven because of,

1861
01:58:07.020 --> 01:58:09.990
I mean look how active that water is.
The European one,
Huh?
Yeah.

1862
01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:15.420
That's mind blowing.
That's just crazy.

1863
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:20.370
But this is again not flied ration anymore so Roy is a water and they're even

1864
01:58:20.371 --> 01:58:21.270
marking the like this.

1865
01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:25.530
It's not like a water you will drink on a daily basis because it's so loaded

1866
01:58:25.531 --> 01:58:28.260
with metals and this is so heavy in your palate as smile.

1867
01:58:28.261 --> 01:58:30.000
It's like you cannot drink media.
A lot of this.

1868
01:58:30.030 --> 01:58:32.940
I was going to say when it doesn't it don't.

1869
01:58:32.941 --> 01:58:35.430
These levels affect how you're tasting food.

1870
01:58:35.580 --> 01:58:39.840
The other words when you're drinking a Roy and you're try to taste like food

1871
01:58:39.841 --> 01:58:43.530
right next to it.
Forget it.
Yeah.
The food will be tasteless suddenly be called.

1872
01:58:43.531 --> 01:58:46.230
This water has sort of overwhelms you.
It is all of the MCO.

1873
01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:51.160
Cool thing about Reuters just put a little drops into our oyster and like the

1874
01:58:51.161 --> 01:58:54.740
isis really amazing and taste suddenly really it's totally changed and all this

1875
01:58:54.741 --> 01:58:56.920
stuff feeling so that's pretty cool.
That's amazing.

1876
01:58:56.921 --> 01:58:59.050
This is our water like for a dietary restriction.

1877
01:58:59.230 --> 01:59:03.160
That's like we calling it in Europe,
healthy waters in Germany.

1878
01:59:03.161 --> 01:59:05.920
They would have a medication label on it.
They would,
yes.

1879
01:59:06.670 --> 01:59:09.400
It's considered to be a health water.
Why?

1880
01:59:09.401 --> 01:59:12.850
We have different regulations in Germany and this is I think where the American

1881
01:59:12.851 --> 01:59:16.450
market really needs to step up their game a little bit when it comes to bottled

1882
01:59:16.451 --> 01:59:17.200
water.

1883
01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:20.770
There regulations are very strict when it comes to a bottled water in Germany

1884
01:59:21.070 --> 01:59:22.240
and the labeling as well.

1885
01:59:22.300 --> 01:59:26.220
Even in the government is saying like by some borders of,

1886
01:59:26.350 --> 01:59:29.980
there's a brand from core core that's called [inaudible] and [inaudible] spelled

1887
01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:32.930
in a regular basis.
Aquifer,
a cure UAA phone.

1888
01:59:33.550 --> 01:59:35.830
And they said like the German government,
no wait a minute.

1889
01:59:35.831 --> 01:59:38.050
That's like purified water up on our Cummins.
Good water.

1890
01:59:38.110 --> 01:59:40.180
You cannot label this fight.

1891
01:59:40.510 --> 01:59:45.510
So they misspelled for a Q a on purpose that they can label [inaudible].

1892
01:59:47.290 --> 01:59:51.630
Wow.
The regulations are very strict now,
but I think it's good.
I want to,

1893
01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:54.940
for the person listening or watching this,
how can they,

1894
01:59:55.540 --> 01:59:59.890
this is like an obviously intriguing topic.
Learn more like is it,

1895
01:59:59.891 --> 02:00:03.310
should they go to your site?
Like what do you recommend to go to my site?
You can,

1896
02:00:03.311 --> 02:00:06.400
you can come to Patina obviously.
Yeah.
So what it tells,

1897
02:00:06.401 --> 02:00:08.230
what happened is that Patina on a daily basis.

1898
02:00:08.231 --> 02:00:13.100
And we have this beautiful water menu.
What I brought a swollen
over here.

1899
02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:14.860
So this is the Patina water menu.

1900
02:00:14.861 --> 02:00:19.810
We have 20 different mineral waters and every water has like two pages and you

1901
02:00:19.811 --> 02:00:23.140
can literally like see a little taste profile off that water,

1902
02:00:23.141 --> 02:00:25.220
a story of the water,
the tds countries,

1903
02:00:25.340 --> 02:00:28.000
then actually what's in there and then a price.
So,

1904
02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:30.820
and this goes like to 20 different mineral waters.

1905
02:00:30.821 --> 02:00:32.860
What we are offering right now,
this is incredible.
Um,

1906
02:00:32.890 --> 02:00:37.120
Dana Lee's coming up in July.
We will have a water tasting based on our,

1907
02:00:37.540 --> 02:00:41.090
based on our,
uh,
Dyno Amen Menu at Swan.

1908
02:00:41.091 --> 02:00:43.510
So three different waters paired to your dishes.

1909
02:00:44.020 --> 02:00:48.100
Is the Roy the Slovenian?
Yeah,
this is the tricky part.
So Roy,

1910
02:00:48.130 --> 02:00:52.450
you kind of access in America,
but retail would be around $25.
Okay.

1911
02:00:54.460 --> 02:00:57.700
What is this last one here that we see from Hungary?

1912
02:01:01.210 --> 02:01:05.290
From Hungary.
So is there like hatred and contempt?

1913
02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:09.570
How do they put that in a bottle last?
That will be amazing.
And we shouldn't.

1914
02:01:09.571 --> 02:01:14.160
We should all get a new class.
This is,
this is a special line dancing.

1915
02:01:14.161 --> 02:01:19.090
Very special again,
thank you so much.
Thank you sir.
I like the Roy.

1916
02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:20.350
I really liked this.

1917
02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:24.430
Roy is actually pretty cool and I have this sometimes in water tastings as well.

1918
02:01:24.431 --> 02:01:27.850
What I do and people always stick to Roy.
They always like,

1919
02:01:27.851 --> 02:01:31.900
that's a really cool water.
I think it's so unique that they're saying like,

1920
02:01:31.930 --> 02:01:36.730
I really loved that water.
It's a,
it's like the level of the bubbliness.

1921
02:01:36.731 --> 02:01:41.650
I liked the sodium content.
I feel,
I don't know.
It's a got a lot of pizzazz.

1922
02:01:41.700 --> 02:01:46.400
Yeah.
The queen likes a dollar a sparkling water.
Interesting English.
Yeah.

1923
02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:50.660
Let's see.
The Hungarians is a still water again and again,

1924
02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:55.620
so we going but it has a little,
a little middle content.
You okay?

1925
02:01:55.650 --> 02:01:58.890
I see that's called mirror from Hungaria

1926
02:02:00.860 --> 02:02:03.710
and let's,
let's just,
let's taste this.

1927
02:02:03.860 --> 02:02:07.350
I get a shit about it then post it again.

1928
02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:09.710
Okay.
Let's see.

1929
02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:17.630
That is,
Whoa,
horrible.
That is terrible.

1930
02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:21.530
What is going on?
I even think that as well is it is a water water

1931
02:02:23.570 --> 02:02:26.210
that is garbage.
What is that terrible

1932
02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:32.920
little sulfur [inaudible] 7,500 milligrams of sulfur.

1933
02:02:34.820 --> 02:02:38.730
Let me see that.
Can I see the bottle?
This is their bottled water,
like ice tea,

1934
02:02:38.740 --> 02:02:42.280
DSL before you'll see the tds level GDS level.

1935
02:02:44.690 --> 02:02:48.060
It's got eight thousand eight thousand and higher.

1936
02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:52.670
10 I'll go 1616 tds.

1937
02:02:53.660 --> 02:02:56.270
But in Hungary we have Dev,
a lot of springs and mineral.

1938
02:02:56.290 --> 02:02:58.780
You want answered the meal?
A convenient store.

1939
02:02:58.790 --> 02:03:00.890
Like I want to get a bottle of water.
Like you're just visiting.

1940
02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:05.390
You grabbed that off the shelf and then you're getting a hot to take you buck.

1941
02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:08.690
So that's the reason they getting guys.
Walter,
it's not just water.

1942
02:03:08.691 --> 02:03:13.100
Water has taste and even here I know a lot of purified waters.
Again,

1943
02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:14.660
filling everything out of there.

1944
02:03:14.660 --> 02:03:18.290
They creating Shiming boys that everybody thinks it's all tastes the same.
Yeah,

1945
02:03:18.291 --> 02:03:22.040
they all taste the same.
You will see now here,
that's what my,
what I brought.

1946
02:03:22.041 --> 02:03:26.380
Suddenly you realize,
Holy Shit,
what does taste good advice.

1947
02:03:28.010 --> 02:03:32.780
I've never seen this one on the shelf.
It was disgusting.

1948
02:03:33.170 --> 02:03:37.040
I was not.
You're jr this is upsetting water.

1949
02:03:37.970 --> 02:03:39.800
But I mean and when I go to,

1950
02:03:39.801 --> 02:03:43.220
when I'm in Budapest I always order [inaudible] which is sparkling water and

1951
02:03:43.221 --> 02:03:45.440
they definitely don't bring that shit.
They bring their,

1952
02:03:45.530 --> 02:03:48.980
they bring stuff similar to,
I would say the Spanish one,
but

1953
02:03:51.110 --> 02:03:56.110
to recap table one of the things too like to basic like advance yourself in this

1954
02:03:56.751 --> 02:04:01.170
nasty ass for springwater glacier water or what?
Correct.

1955
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:04.580
Mineral Water,
mineral water will say it's on the bottle and it's this.

1956
02:04:04.581 --> 02:04:05.990
This is really the key guys.

1957
02:04:06.500 --> 02:04:08.990
Always when you're going to the grocery store and do it with your kids,

1958
02:04:08.991 --> 02:04:09.680
do it with your family.

1959
02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:14.680
It's kind of like buy several bottles of water but make sure they are all coming

1960
02:04:15.291 --> 02:04:19.790
from a natural resource could then they will taste differently and have them

1961
02:04:19.791 --> 02:04:21.170
side by side.
Do not slow them down,

1962
02:04:21.171 --> 02:04:24.470
have them side by side in different classes and really taste them through and

1963
02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:29.300
it's not able to realize holy shit,
water has taste does and it's from Earth.

1964
02:04:29.301 --> 02:04:31.460
I mean you think about it,
it's coming to mother earth.

1965
02:04:31.461 --> 02:04:34.850
We should be thankful that we can drink all this kind of cool different waters

1966
02:04:34.851 --> 02:04:37.470
that we have access to clean water.
We're going to get blue band some of that.

1967
02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:38.400
And let's face it as well.

1968
02:04:38.401 --> 02:04:40.890
There are millions of people who don't have x access to clean water.

1969
02:04:40.891 --> 02:04:43.880
This is a big topic for me as far as the water some again,
um,

1970
02:04:43.980 --> 02:04:47.610
because everybody knows I have like so many different cool Walters and some

1971
02:04:47.611 --> 02:04:49.830
people are saying I'm the most hydrated person on this planet,

1972
02:04:50.820 --> 02:04:54.390
but there's billions of people or millions of people who don't have access.

1973
02:04:54.390 --> 02:04:57.960
And I think we should all honored that we have access to clean water and we

1974
02:04:57.961 --> 02:05:01.350
should help people who don't have access or water.org for example,

1975
02:05:01.390 --> 02:05:05.040
I'm supporting the Matt Damon Foundation and I'm trying to raise money or the

1976
02:05:05.041 --> 02:05:09.350
time to,
to help other countries.
Is that him?
Is that his water.org?
Yes sir.

1977
02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:11.390
The Matt Damon,
I think.
Yeah,
cause he's big on that.
Right.

1978
02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:14.640
And I think it's a great thing what he's doing there and I'm supporting them.

1979
02:05:14.641 --> 02:05:15.361
Even on the home page,

1980
02:05:15.361 --> 02:05:18.960
there's a link that you can spend some money and I think it's a good thing to
do.

1981
02:05:19.050 --> 02:05:23.790
<v 2>This is quest.
Super Cool.
This was the most mind blowing thing I,
you know,</v>

1982
02:05:23.850 --> 02:05:26.760
you think of,
but you don't think about water.
I mean,
I mean I don't,

1983
02:05:26.761 --> 02:05:28.410
I just consume it.
Consume it.
Yeah.

1984
02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:32.190
<v 9>This was outstanding in California.
We had for the last five years a big drought.</v>

1985
02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:34.210
Finally,
we are out of the drought.
Right.

1986
02:05:34.260 --> 02:05:37.170
But I think that doesn't mean we can waste water again.
Right.

1987
02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:40.380
So this is the point of swell.
But I like to do with my water menu.

1988
02:05:40.410 --> 02:05:43.560
I want to give water a value that people understand.
Hey,

1989
02:05:43.830 --> 02:05:46.560
this a little bit more than,
than just water.
Yeah.

1990
02:05:46.740 --> 02:05:50.500
And maybe I could start to rethink my use of water as well.
Yeah.

1991
02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:53.730
And maybe when I'm washing my teeth don't have the tab open the whole time.

1992
02:05:53.940 --> 02:05:56.830
Just clause it.
Even California is not in a drought right now.
Yeah.

1993
02:05:56.880 --> 02:06:00.180
But still we need to save water because the summer is coming.

1994
02:06:00.181 --> 02:06:01.110
Trust me in two years.

1995
02:06:01.410 --> 02:06:04.950
We are back on throughout this very big drought problem again.

1996
02:06:05.130 --> 02:06:09.900
We have to save water for the future generations and therefore let's all drink

1997
02:06:09.901 --> 02:06:13.680
enough water.
That's the key guys do.
I don't drink sodas,
drinking of water,

1998
02:06:13.681 --> 02:06:16.860
but please be considered as well what you're doing with water.

1999
02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:21.700
<v 2>Yeah.
Very good.
Um,
Martin Reesie,
Risa,</v>

2000
02:06:22.110 --> 02:06:26.780
Risa,

2003
02:06:34.460 --> 02:06:37.500
[inaudible] dot com you can go to Patina,
uh,

2004
02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:42.050
in downtown Los Angeles and actually see Martin in the flesh and a experience

2005
02:06:42.051 --> 02:06:44.840
the water menu.
And I'm actually,
you know,

2006
02:06:44.841 --> 02:06:48.220
I think this is really cool to try out different waters and,
and,

2007
02:06:48.260 --> 02:06:52.460
and see if you guys can experience some of what we did here today.
It's a very,

2008
02:06:52.760 --> 02:06:55.700
very eyeopening thing.
You can take a class from Martin.
He can,

2009
02:06:55.730 --> 02:06:59.540
that's what I'm saying.
You can take classes.
Yeah,
