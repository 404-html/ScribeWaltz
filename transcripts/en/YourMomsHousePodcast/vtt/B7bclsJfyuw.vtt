Had to,

57
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.620

but that's that.
Oh Gee shirt.

58
00:04:01.621 --> 00:04:03.400
That's uh,

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.750
I squeeze like one then that really I did it to,
that one blew up,

60
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.320
That was a big shirt.
Limited edition.

61
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.910
This is the little bit,
that was so fun.

62
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.250
I keep thinking about what a charming gentleman he was.
Yeah,
it was great,
man.

63
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.130
It was so exciting to see you.
So stoked.

64
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:25.660
That's what everybody kept messaging me and they're like,

65
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:27.940
I've never seen you so happy.
I know.

66
00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:31.090
And it's funny because we stopped rolling and we were taking photos with him and

67
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.630
you are just ear to ear.
And I said to him,
I was like,
listen,

68
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.590
birth of the children didn't matter.
This was Tommy's prom.

It's going to be a lot of fun.

74
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.960
Why don't we go ahead and kick the park?
Oh boy,

75
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.530

78
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.310
<v 1>Oh,
I knew it.
I know,

79
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.040
[inaudible]

80
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.310
<v 4>yeah.
Hey man,</v>

81
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.370
how did I know?
I remember.
I was like,
what's the opening club?

82
00:06:14.371 --> 00:06:18.170
Is it going to be pussies?
Dick Fart.
And it was exactly what you weren't.

83
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.560
It was a super cool guy.
Uh,
can we see that again?

84
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.480
I want to see his very first clip.
I just told,
oh,
I don't like his voice.

85
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:29.543
<v 5>Um,</v>

86
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.720
that there's some woman are women out there

87
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.710
who've really like,
um,
having their pussies.

88
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.440
<v 4>That is a cool guy.
I think a lot of women like cool guy.</v>

89
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.700
I think a louder,
should that be louder?
Yes.
He says this.
Good.

90
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.750
Okay.
A lot of women like getting their policies.
Look,
it's really,

91
00:06:57.751 --> 00:06:59.600
you could raise it up a little bit.
Oh,
okay.

92
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.640
It's really matter of whose licking it.

93
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.260
Why can't I just indiscriminate liquors.
It's gotta be like,

94
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.080
I wasn't buddy.
You want to put their mouth on your style.

95
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.580
Does it matter who puts their mouth on you?
Does it not matter for you?
No,

96
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.490
of course not.
I go when,
when you're out on the road and you're cool.
Beaver bus,

97
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.420
the bang bus,

98
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.060
the bang bus allows anyone who's down to bang on it.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

99
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.320
Cool.
Yeah.
I don't have any,
there's no rules.
There's no rules on the bang.

100
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:35.010
I don't know.
Are you down?
Do you want to bang?
You got a mouse?

101
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.900
I can put stuff in.
I cannot believe that somebody has standards for a mouth.

102
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.230
I mean I understand.
Are you serious?
I understand the vagina.
Okay.

103
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.340
Like you know it's like,
yeah,
you're not just going to f whoever,

104
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.790
but if someone's like put your stuff on my mouth.
I don't care.

105
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.870
Put your stuff in my mouth.
Yeah,
there's no like standard for that.

106
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.300
What do you mean?
I'm sorry,
I don't understand what I'm saying.

107
00:07:56.301 --> 00:08:00.920
Like any woman who was like,
do you want to put your stuff in my mouth?

108
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.700
I'd be like,
okay,
but what about the woman with no teeth or letter?

109
00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:08.240
The moose soup lady probably like sores on her mouth.
It doesn't bother you.

110
00:08:08.241 --> 00:08:08.960
It doors.

111
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.690
I mean now you're starting to talk about something that you visually can see as

112
00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:15.770
a problem.
But like if somebody who's just like,
you know,

113
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.950
undesired unattractive,
I'd be like,
yeah,
you can still put it in her mouth.

114
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.410
I guess that's true.
Cause like lot lizards

115
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.330
people heard of though,
where you think we sleep on the row,

116
00:08:26.331 --> 00:08:31.190
we port render the bus lives in the lot.
Lot Lizards.

117
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:34.010
They're like nasty checks.
It's like decks,
right?
Yeah.

118
00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:38.540
They just hide in the bushes.
And we were like,
Eh,

119
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.600
no,
I get it.
A little sucky.
Done.
Yeah.

120
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.020
And how much do you have to pay the lot lizard.
No Lot losers live on it.

121
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:49.580
That's how they live.
If they live on coffee.
Yeah.
It's like a calm dog.
Uh,

122
00:08:49.581 --> 00:08:53.530
you know El Chapo?
I know,
I know him.
El Chapo,
they just,
so he's on it.

123
00:08:53.531 --> 00:08:57.870
He's an having a trial right now in Brooklyn for a,

124
00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.640
just a lot of crimes,

125
00:08:59.641 --> 00:09:03.270
let's say conspiracies and murder and trafficking.

126
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:08.550
And somebody testified that they would procure underage prostitutes for him.

127
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:09.450
Um,

128
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:14.450
and he was getting like young teens and that he said that they were that money

129
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.920
when he had sex with them,
that they were vitamins for life.

130
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:25.170
That's pretty out there.
I mean,

131
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.550
it's not that out there for him.
I feel like a lot of guys believe that.

132
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.890
Like my dad.
I think that

133
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.540
the guitar riff gets married,

134
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:45.750
but don't you think that there's a lot of older men gentlemen out there that

135
00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:49.170
feel like Young Pussy is a fountain of Youth?
Well yeah,
they're not wrong.

136
00:09:49.171 --> 00:09:54.020
I'm saying that,
but you get the vitamins in your painter.

137
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:59.540
I think able to being able to categorize it and describe it as vitamin.

138
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.050
It's very articulate and crayons and really out there and accurate too.

139
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:09.720
It is accurate but I just,
you know,
usually when you hear it spoken you go,

140
00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:14.040
oh wow.
Hearing it is different.
You're like,

141
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:18.660
I always knew it took place.
Yeah.
That description really sticks with you,

142
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:20.850
that description and also,

143
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:24.120
cause you and I are really ended the show love after a lockup.
Oh my God.

144
00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:29.690
So into it and there's a guy on there who's married to one girl.

145
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.390
They have one two year old and then they have another baby on the way.

146
00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:34.224
She's pregnant,

147
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.300
he's married to her and then now he's in love with another girl and he's going

148
00:10:38.301 --> 00:10:42.340
to propose to the other girl.
Women are both unaware of the other ones.

149
00:10:42.341 --> 00:10:44.850
It's pretty definitive.
It's just out of prison.
So he's on parole.

150
00:10:44.851 --> 00:10:46.050
Like the guy doesn't have a job,

151
00:10:46.051 --> 00:10:51.051
he has nothing lined up and he is thrill is to be a liar face to these two

152
00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:55.450
women's pretty scary actually.
It is probably the scariest guy.

153
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.190
They don't tell you what he,
what he was locked up for.

154
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.080
Well they say it's a parole violation,

155
00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.730
but you don't know what the original crime was.
But that,

156
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.070
that dude is the scariest by far of everybody.

157
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.300
He enjoys the attention of like,
baby,

158
00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:14.060
I got to go now and that girl's crying.
Stop,
stop,
stop crying,

159
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:18.060
crying.
He is dead.
And He um,
he toys with them.

160
00:11:18.061 --> 00:11:22.360
He's like real master manipulator.
Narcissi scary.
Yeah,
he's kind of,
Ooh,

161
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:26.130
that's so scary.
I know,
but the show is unbelievable.
Here's some advice.

162
00:11:26.131 --> 00:11:29.610
By the way,
this is what I got from watching that show.
Uh,

163
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.540
don't reach out to convicts.
They're terrible people.

164
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.160
Not all of them don't start dating while in prison.

165
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.360
That's what the show,

166
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.190
that's the lesson of the show or don't try to marry them and try to get them to

167
00:11:44.191 --> 00:11:48.300
be normal people.
Well,
it happens.
Everybody is like,
they're all the same.

168
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.920
The ones who reach out like they want love,
you can tell that they're like,

169
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:56.800
they want love,
right.
That's what they want are the ones who are,

170
00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.690
who are reaching out to the,
to the prisoners.

171
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:04.030
They go on these sites and then they find somebody who's like confined to a

172
00:12:04.031 --> 00:12:08.110
space and you go like,
well that's this person can't hurt me.
It's ideal.

173
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.050
It's ideal.
They can't leave me,
they can't cheat on me.
They can't do these,

174
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:14.770
you know,
and they,
and they also rely on me for my affection to my attention.

175
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.400
You see it,
you see it all,
it's a good dynamic.

176
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:23.210
And then like they build the relationship under those,
you know,
uh,

177
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:27.100
parameters.
The scales are so imbalanced.
Like one is completely,

178
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:31.480
it's like having a child is dependent on the other [inaudible] they're doing

179
00:12:31.481 --> 00:12:32.830
that for a couple of years,
two,

180
00:12:32.831 --> 00:12:37.720
three years that I've been communicating with you.
But you've been in this,

181
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:41.620
you know,
essentially like a submarine,
you know,
you can't go anywhere in it.

182
00:12:41.621 --> 00:12:42.454
It's like,

183
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:46.120
and then it comes up to the surface and you finally get out and they're like,

184
00:12:46.121 --> 00:12:47.470
well,
I want the dynamic to stay.

185
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:52.470
The same does finally free and they can't be controlled and they're horrible,

186
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:54.900
horrible people.

187
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:59.290
So now the horrible person starts doing the horrible things.

188
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:03.370
Either it's there,
there are drug addicts,
they're liars,

189
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.530
they're closeted,
gay or bisexual.

190
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:10.270
And then they or they use the outside person for money on the inside.

191
00:13:10.271 --> 00:13:11.500
This one check is like,

192
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.950
I got $800,000 from tricks on the side and the closeted gay think what she's,

193
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:22.210
what she's referring to is basically punchy mansplain me.
Well,
how dare,

194
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:25.120
cause it sounds like you're saying like there's a problem with,
with the gays.

195
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:26.920
Yeah.
Well,
you know,
I mean they're all,

196
00:13:26.921 --> 00:13:31.921
what you're referring to is somebody who basically didn't tell the person who,

197
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.930
uh,
they had been dating on the outside,

198
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.670
that they in fact are gay or bi.
So now the person on the outside,
it's like,

199
00:13:39.671 --> 00:13:43.030
wait a minute.
You like,
you know women too.

200
00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:48.220
I didn't know that.
And he's like,
oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

201
00:13:48.221 --> 00:13:51.600
I forgot to tell you that
a lot of lying,
there's,

202
00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:56.100
there's just like a lot convicts lie a lot.
Just like,

203
00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.860
like,
Yay.
Yeah.
Well,

204
00:13:59.861 --> 00:14:02.370
so what is this cool guy want?
He wants to,
Oh yeah.

205
00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.340
Can we go back to this awesome guy?
He seemed really,
really cool.

206
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.580
It seemed like he just,
he's just a sad,

207
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:10.543
<v 5>just hope</v>

208
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.860
that there's some woman or women out there plural,
um,

209
00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:21.650
who really like,
um,
having their push.
Yeah.
That's,

210
00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:26.450
that's all I really want,
you know?
Um,
to be truthful,

211
00:14:26.451 --> 00:14:30.380
that's all I keep asking God for.
I just,
honest to God,

212
00:14:30.381 --> 00:14:33.800
just want to lick pussy.
That's,
that's where my heart said,

213
00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.880
that's where my mind's at.
Hey guys,

214
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:40.850
if you're out there and you're interested in me and your friend on this site of

215
00:14:40.851 --> 00:14:45.630
mine and you really want to have that done,
okay.
Now the same.

216
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:47.480
Seriously interested in doing that.

217
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.200
<v 4>Yeah.
It seems,
I mean,
it doesn't seem unreasonable.
Well,</v>

218
00:14:51.201 --> 00:14:53.600
when you're including it to your prayers to God,

219
00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:01.070
he means it.
Dear God,
cure my cancer.
Take care of my grandma.

220
00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.760
I want to lick pussy.
Little lot of it.
Yeah.
Man,

221
00:15:04.761 --> 00:15:09.590
I think I'd get that prayer a lot.
I think.
Um,
I dunno.

222
00:15:09.591 --> 00:15:12.320
I think putting it out there though is a cool thing.

223
00:15:12.321 --> 00:15:15.500
I think God probably does get that prayer a lot.
I really do.

224
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.130
I think God does.
I think there's a lot of people out there who was like,

225
00:15:19.131 --> 00:15:20.200
please let me get my dick sucked.

226
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:26.090
What do you think God gets asked for the most money.
Definitely money.

227
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:28.490
Health and then pussy licks.
Yeah.

228
00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.830
I mean I think a lot of people probably ask God for Love,
love,
just kind of Nice.

229
00:15:32.831 --> 00:15:34.940
But I think,
I think there's definitely,

230
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:38.540
he probably gets more sexual prayers from men.

231
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:44.410
It's mostly the guys that are like,
please let me get my dates.
I please let me.

232
00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.060
I think we actually,
um,
it's,

233
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.920
it's probably fair to assume that God has his own,
um,

234
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.380
anthem in his head that goes,

235
00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:01.370
like every time that prayer comes in he's like,
here we go,
here we go again.

236
00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:04.990
He's fucking cool guys.
Guy Wanting to get his pussy licked.

237
00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.880
His man pussy.
Like,
I mean,

238
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:12.290
that guy is not the most attractive for those listening.
No,

239
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.180
but he's done at summit.
There's a woman out there who would let it happen.

240
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.473
I said,
look,

241
00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:21.140
if there's one lesson we've learned from love after lockup is that there's

242
00:16:21.141 --> 00:16:23.000
somebody for everybody.
Yeah,

243
00:16:23.001 --> 00:16:28.001
that's true with the Internet now you can find anybody through some of those

244
00:16:28.431 --> 00:16:32.670
losers that I'm are reaching out to the uh,

245
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.970
to the prisoners like they can get completely hosed.

246
00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.490
There's still like,
I love her so much.

247
00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:44.840
She's so dark and if such poor self esteem,

248
00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.830
that's really the other key ingredient to dating an inmate is that you have

249
00:16:48.831 --> 00:16:49.850
really bad self esteem.

250
00:16:49.851 --> 00:16:53.780
And that's why I dug experiences cause they're also always like right.

251
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:58.040
There's always the,
well the last person broke up with me or dumped me.

252
00:16:58.041 --> 00:17:02.230
You're doing this to me so now,
now I'm going to play it safe data.

253
00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:05.870
And then they always put that person in debt.

254
00:17:05.871 --> 00:17:08.870
The prisoner and inmate finds a way to siphon the money out of them.

255
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:14.300
They're all in debt because of the breast.
It's great.
Really a good one.

256
00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:20.360
I find it real quick because people asked us this and we wanted to make a,

257
00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:24.440
so last week of course the great big daddy Kane was on,
which was awesome.

258
00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:25.663
Really Fun.

259
00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:31.070
A lot of people mentioned or sent messages that there was something wrong with

260
00:17:31.071 --> 00:17:34.880
the video quality on Youtube and that it was a,

261
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.330
the highest resolution was three 60 p and they were like,
what is up with that?

262
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.110
And you know,
I started talking to blue band about it.

263
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.670
You said that you didn't know and then you reached out to youtube what they say

264
00:17:46.671 --> 00:17:49.800
to you,
right?
Yeah,
I reached out to our youtube contact and

265
00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.640
<v 6>it seems like it's a bug.
Uh,
it is now being escalated.</v>

266
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.300
So they are currently working on trying to bring,
but it's a youtube glitch.
Yeah,

267
00:17:57.301 --> 00:18:00.820
it's a,
yeah,
it's just nothing that we did.
Oh yeah.

268
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.170
This is the first time it's happened to us.
Not sure why it happened.

269
00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.690
<v 0>Okay.
So that was the main thing though.</v>

270
00:18:04.691 --> 00:18:07.540
It wasn't like we decided to record it and upload it differently.

271
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:11.350
It's something internal on their part.
Right.
All right.

272
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.780
Um,
can I bring up something very quickly?
Yeah.
Before,
yeah.

273
00:18:16.781 --> 00:18:19.740
Before we have to,
yeah.
We have to make it.
Yeah.
Now let,

274
00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:21.250
before we bum everyone out.

275
00:18:21.251 --> 00:18:25.240
I just want to say that I had such a wonderful time watching you with your hero,

276
00:18:25.241 --> 00:18:29.650
big Daddy Kane.
And like I said,
you don't really get joyful about much.

277
00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:30.820
Um,

278
00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:35.820
but it was great seeing you just ear to ear with him and it inspired me to reach

279
00:18:36.011 --> 00:18:41.011
out to my heroes and I'm currently on a campaign to get Kim and Kelly deal here

280
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.420
of the breeders.
Kim Jill formally the basis for the pixies.

281
00:18:46.421 --> 00:18:48.460
I'm a huge fan of your huge might know this.

282
00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:52.330
I got to meet him once on the street and I practically,
I always with you,
shit,

283
00:18:52.331 --> 00:18:56.740
my pants were on Hyperion silver lake and I don't care about celebrities,

284
00:18:56.741 --> 00:19:00.880
but I do love the deal sister.
I think we were walking by say cheese and uh,

285
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:05.200
itchies and uh,
yeah.
Say Geez,
it's a cheese shop.

286
00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:09.700
And he told me to talk to her and I did and I was so scared.
But guys listen.

287
00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.630
So Kelley deal.
I've,
I've reached out.
Kim is not on Twitter,
but Kelly is,

288
00:19:13.631 --> 00:19:17.020
and I've reached out on Twitter and she's so far retweeted my tweet.

289
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.610
She's like the tweet.
Oh,

290
00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:23.410
I need your guys' help to get Kevin Kelly's on her hand show.
So here we go guys.

291
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:26.620
Let's get mommy power on it.
It is at Kelly,

292
00:19:26.621 --> 00:19:31.510
d l k e l l e y.
D.
E.
A.

Uh,

293
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:35.610
Uh Huh.
Okay.
Uh,
and let her know that I would love to have Shane,

294
00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:39.640
her sister on your mom's house to plug any upcoming maybe concert dates.

295
00:19:39.641 --> 00:19:43.000
I know they tour is the breeders.
Anyways,
there you go.

296
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.150
I'm putting it out there in the universe.
That would be my big daddy Kane,

297
00:19:46.151 --> 00:19:49.930
so to speak.
And is this,
this isn't your confession though,
is it?
Or is it,
no,

298
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:52.930
I'm so embarrassed.
What is it?
I'm really,

299
00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:56.590
this is something I have not revealed to you.
I kept it from me today.

300
00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:01.820
I kept it from everybody.
This is a scaring,
isn't exclusive.
It's,
this is,
uh,

301
00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:07.080
you'll notice that I haven't reached for the Fart Mike today and it's because

302
00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:12.720
this morning in the kitchen I was making myself a smoothie and,

303
00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:20.950
and I farted and then a little wet

304
00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:28.210
and,
and I wasn't wearing any underwear under my pajamas.

305
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:39.260
<v 7>I know I don't wear any underwear in my pajamas.</v>

306
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:44.470
<v 0>And I was standing in the kitchen and I just farted,
I feel like wet down my leg.</v>

307
00:20:44.471 --> 00:20:48.240
And I was like,
I don't know where,
where that,
it's Friday.

308
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:53.020
<v 4>And I went upstairs and newer in the memory you were upstairs and I was like,</v>

309
00:20:53.021 --> 00:20:57.430
oh I gotta think I gotta take a dump.
You didn't know at that point.

310
00:20:57.431 --> 00:21:01.140
He did though.
I figured it out.
I kid,

311
00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.660
cause I didn't know if it was a shard or kind of come out of another room,

312
00:21:04.661 --> 00:21:08.490
throw those patients away.
Did you throw them away?
They're in the trash.

313
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.740
It's just a little bit of Shit.
We behave.

314
00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:15.250
I just want to know how much was it.
So here's the deal,
man.

315
00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:17.470
Last night we had pizza,

316
00:21:17.471 --> 00:21:20.050
the cauliflower crust pizza with all those meat toppings.

317
00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:24.970
And so I sat down and do Brown and it was like liquid came out of me.

318
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:29.460
So I sharted.
And the reason I sharted cause it was like liquids deal man,

319
00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.550
but it was liquid brown.
It didn't hurt like diarrhea.

320
00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.100
It was just all liquid it is that what it's short is,

321
00:21:39.101 --> 00:21:40.720
it's like it's not necessarily,

322
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:45.240
I mean a sharp doesn't have to be exclusively liquid.
No,
cause I had one,

323
00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:47.860
I remember we were flying to Africa.
That was my first shot ever.

324
00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:53.610
2011 we were at the international Everman Atlanta airport at Hartsfield Jackson

325
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:59.500
ready to board a 16 hour flight to Johannesburg.
And Christina was like,

326
00:21:59.501 --> 00:22:01.780
I'm going to get some tacos.
He wants some.
I was like,
I'm good.

327
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:06.430
And then three talks right away and that's why she's like shorter.

328
00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:11.590
But that shot was different because it was like a Hershey kiss mashed into the

329
00:22:11.591 --> 00:22:15.760
thing and do Appannie.
But this one was liquid baby.
It was like,

330
00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.810
it was a liquid fart.
Have you ever had that?
Yeah.
You know what?

331
00:22:19.811 --> 00:22:24.610
I had it when we lived in Redondo.
I remember.
I know.
Exactly.
Glad we're on this.

332
00:22:24.611 --> 00:22:26.710
We're trying this juicing thing.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

333
00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:28.720
And there was something called like something green,

334
00:22:28.721 --> 00:22:33.070
like all the green you need or some shit.
And it was a scoop of this powder.

335
00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:37.840
So I was standing also in the kitchen.
Yeah,
I remember.
And I forward,

336
00:22:37.841 --> 00:22:42.070
it was just liquid,
but it was,
I mean it was big.
I was like,
oh.

337
00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:47.640
And then just water,
water works and that's what happened.

338
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:52.410
And then the next day I did it again.
You,
you ate the same thing.

339
00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.260
I didn't know for sure.
I thought maybe all something was up with my stomach.

340
00:22:56.261 --> 00:23:01.240
This morning I did the green powder again,
farted,

341
00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:06.390
all water,
and then I dump the fucking powder down the sink.
I was like,
I said,

342
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.300
this is how you'll lose weight on this.
Collaroy yeah.

343
00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:15.160
Well it made me think about are you kept that secret?
I kept it.
I kept,

344
00:23:15.161 --> 00:23:18.270
I was a little ashamed because by the time I'd figured it out because I thought

345
00:23:18.271 --> 00:23:19.630
it,
you know,
I don't know what this is.

346
00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:23.800
And I sat down and by the time I'd figured it out,
I was shitting already.

347
00:23:23.801 --> 00:23:25.780
And I don't want to call you in and tell you.
And then I was like,

348
00:23:25.781 --> 00:23:28.180
I should save it for the show because this is kind of a big deal.

349
00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:33.660
But it made me think about the very important question,
which is do far,

350
00:23:33.661 --> 00:23:37.570
it's pushed to shit out.
And I have to say in the case of a shark,
yes they do.

351
00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:42.000
Yes they do push.
It was the pizza.
It was,

352
00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:45.110
cause that's really all I ate yesterday and ate a lot of it and it was that

353
00:23:45.111 --> 00:23:49.700
cauliflower crust.
It gives me farts and mad dumps every time.
God.

354
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:50.930
Unbelievable man.

355
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:55.730
I can't believe I shot 42 years old and I had my first like liquid sharp.

356
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:59.450
Oh boy.
Isn't that exciting.
It's really exciting.
It's really something.

357
00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.780
So now we're,
we forget onto the batch.

358
00:24:02.781 --> 00:24:05.500
Are we talking about or the year before that?

we're going to keep recording them so we're going to keep going.

367

370
00:24:46.891 --> 00:24:51.270
I mean he's just such a great talent in house,
but like greater conversation.

371
00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:55.530
He breaks down clips.
He really gets under the hood with you on different things.

372
00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.650
I really enjoy it.
No.
Yeah,

Here's the big uh,

383
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.920
update before we move on to some,
some clips here.
Uh,

384
00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.650
it is over between us and Morton's.

385
00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.390
I can't believe it.
I'm,

386
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.880
it's almost like one firing.

387
00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:46.870
<v 4>Okay.
That was devastating.
Yeah.</v>

388
00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:51.970
To firings from sponsors is kind of crazy this year.
Morton's fired us.

389
00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:52.430
Yeah.

390
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:57.360
<v 2>Um,
over the weekend and they said we just don't fit their brand objective right</v>

391
00:25:57.361 --> 00:25:59.310
now.
Um,

392
00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.140
<v 4>they don't fit our brand.
They were upset that we,</v>

393
00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.490
you did bring up the dry and the wet aged beef,
but you didn't elaborate,

394
00:26:06.491 --> 00:26:09.500
I guess was the place that I wasn't as familiar with certain products.

395
00:26:09.501 --> 00:26:12.580
You weren't knowledgeable enough about it.
I was just there last week,

396
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:17.100
<v 2>by the way.
Yeah.
And they treated me like I was a celebrity.</v>

397
00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:21.550
<v 4>That's always what they do before they fire you,
they pump you up.
Yeah.</v>

398
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.610
When I got fired from Chelsea lately,
same thing guy.

399
00:26:23.611 --> 00:26:26.630
You're doing a great job here.
And then they fired me the next day.
It's crazy.

400
00:26:26.631 --> 00:26:30.280
But yeah,
so they fired us again.
I had to give a couple grand back

401
00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.420
<v 2>to the uh,
the,
you know,</v>

402
00:26:32.421 --> 00:26:37.200
the people that initially gave it to us for the paint job here.
Yeah.
Um,

403
00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:42.320
anyways,
so we're not with them,
but we still have steakhouse vibes.
So,
uh,

404
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:45.780
just putting a call out to any steak house that wants to be affiliated with this

405
00:26:45.781 --> 00:26:46.350
show.

406
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:50.100
<v 4>Well I think you would just be easier cause we've already got the set painted</v>

407
00:26:50.101 --> 00:26:53.900
like a steakhouse that if we could actually have a steak house sponsors would

408
00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:55.080
just be more convenient.

409
00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:59.010
<v 2>Get a steak house or are you run one or own one?
And you know,</v>

410
00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.090
you want to be affiliated with your mom's house just to send us an email,

411
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:07.980
your mom's podcast@gmail.com and make sure you put steak house in the subject

412
00:27:07.981 --> 00:27:11.640
line.
And this way there's no,

413
00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.180
<v 4>no misunderstanding.</v>

414
00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.740
And also you may want to watch the show before you sign up to be our sponsor.

415
00:27:17.741 --> 00:27:20.500
Yeah.
Do it.
Do a Google search for uncle Terry.

416
00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.830
Why mh before you pull the trigger.
Because you know what,

417
00:27:23.831 --> 00:27:27.010
we're not going to stop doing what we do on this show.
No,
of course.

418
00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:31.810
For a GED sponsor Tom,
no,
no,
we're,
no we're not.
We're not.
We have integrity.

419
00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.380
That's right.

420
00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:36.280
When you were going to do the show the way we want it and we lost millions of

421
00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:40.180
dollars because we did kind of show we do.
But you know what?

422
00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:43.000
Forget it.
The fans are more important to me.

423
00:27:43.001 --> 00:27:46.900
Keeping this show with integrity and doing what we like is more important to me

424
00:27:46.901 --> 00:27:50.350
than any kind of sponsorship.
I agree.
Just so you know guys.
I agree.

425
00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:51.370
We're going to keep it real.

426
00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:54.400
<v 2>So something else happened and my end,
look,</v>

427
00:27:54.401 --> 00:27:56.800
we appreciate the time we were with with,
with Morton's too.

428
00:27:56.801 --> 00:28:00.820
So we just tell them that a couple grand and I'll still say they make a great,

429
00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:03.310
uh,
steak.
Yeah,

430
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:05.440
<v 4>it does.
Are you,
will you still eat it more in tweeter?</v>

431
00:28:05.441 --> 00:28:07.740
We banned from Morton's or we allowed,
I don't think we're a band

432
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:09.650
<v 2>because all eyes,
all I saw,
I mean,</v>

433
00:28:09.651 --> 00:28:13.970
unless there's a followup coming was just that the relationship with the show is

434
00:28:13.971 --> 00:28:15.820
over.
Gotcha.
But we're still allowed on the prison.

435
00:28:15.821 --> 00:28:18.070
I like Mcdonald's where we're not even allowed in southern cal.

436
00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:18.630
<v 4>Well,</v>

437
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:22.620
I had a hankering for a cheeseburger the other day and I had to second like give

438
00:28:22.621 --> 00:28:25.380
it a second thought before I tried going through the drive through because I

439
00:28:25.381 --> 00:28:30.180
don't want to get banned.
Recognize with my children.
Yeah.
You know how that goes.

440
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:34.620
Um,
so something magical happening.
I know you're,

441
00:28:34.621 --> 00:28:38.730
you've been itching to talk about this guy.
This is really cool.

442
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:42.840
So,
wow.
Do you know that like

443
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:44.890
<v 2>Halley's comet?
Yup.</v>

444
00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:52.770
Yeah.
Like once every,
I don't know,
75 something like that.
Sure,
sure,
sure.

445
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:58.100
There comes a time in one's life where one can see something or someone that

446
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:07.310
gives a dose of like natural adrenaline.

447
00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.350
There's an excitement.
It's,
you know what it's like.
Yeah.

448
00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.990
It's like when you're watched back in the day,

449
00:29:12.991 --> 00:29:17.991
American idol and then everybody at it shows all the people who can't hit the

450
00:29:18.471 --> 00:29:21.150
notes.
And then someone comes in like,
I don't know,

451
00:29:21.151 --> 00:29:25.110
Kelly Clarkson or somebody and you're like,
Whoa,
star of the show you,

452
00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:29.580
it's like you recognize the star quality or you see that someone's special.

453
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:34.130
<v 4>It's like the first time I saw GG Allen.
Yes.
And you're like,
this guy's a star.</v>

454
00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:38.480
Yeah.
They have that charisma.
They have something unique.
It's very rare

455
00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:42.490
<v 2>here.
I mean,
you know,
we've been in comedy for a long time now and you know,</v>

456
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.330
rarely do you see someone hit the stage where you're like,
wow.
Right.

457
00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:50.830
That's special.
So this young man hit the,

458
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:54.870
<v 4>I can't even look.
He's so,
his star quality is so bright.
Yeah.</v>

459
00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.530
Look directly.
It's like there's a new

460
00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:01.330
<v 2>social media star.
Yeah.
And for,
for whatever reason,</v>

461
00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:04.250
he was discovered,
I would say,
even though he's been around,

462
00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:08.080
it was discovered over the weekend.
People found his posts,

463
00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:13.240
his videos,
and I was like,
is this real?
And there's,

464
00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:16.970
there's just so much going on with him.
Um,

465
00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.720
I don't even know if I can set it up correctly other than like,

466
00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:24.130
why don't you just dip your toe in the water and see what's what's what here

467
00:30:24.131 --> 00:30:24.800
with this guy?

468
00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:28.580
<v 4>I can tell you visually.
Visually already I am</v>

469
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:33.620
<v 2>blown away.
Yeah,
no,
he's got it.
He's got his own unique style.
I mean like sure.</v>

470
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:38.930
This beard is,
is like,
like no other beard I've ever seen.

471
00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:44.180
<v 4>He's got,
he's got the thin line that was the Puerto Rican pencil,</v>

472
00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:48.640
but that's just in the goatee.
But then he's got a beard separate from it and is,

473
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:53.270
it has its own designs and then he's got the shaved head,

474
00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:56.480
diamond earrings,
beards on beards on beards on me.
Yeah,
go ahead.

475
00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:01.520
<v 8>It's been awhile,
hasn't it?
I decided to make a video.
Okay.</v>

476
00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:06.320
Since I'm stuck on the four oh five.
Oh on a lot of way to Santa Monica.

477
00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:10.310
I think the topic of this video will be something a little more personal.

478
00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:12.760
Let's talk about why bad ass.

479
00:31:12.761 --> 00:31:16.340
Good looking rich guys don't have girlfriends like me.

480
00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:21.950
Why is it that girls will date a guy that has half my wallet?

481
00:31:21.951 --> 00:31:25.580
Half my Dick,
half my car,
half my bank,

482
00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:30.470
half my personality,
half my looks half my wardrobe,

483
00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:33.740
half my sexual prowess.

484
00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.590
But they'll pass up a guy like me who's Fon,

485
00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.780
good booking,
interesting,
edgy,

486
00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:47.060
educated and wants to be a dad.
No,
let's talk about that.

487
00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:51.910
<v 4>Let's talk about it.
I like it.
Great.
Beautiful Tea.
Oh,
the dude is like,</v>

488
00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:55.890
I mean,
it looks great.
Great.
Do you look at those eyelashes?
Look at the browser,

489
00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:59.560
a fleet,
the fuck out you.
Yeah,
man.
He's got like,
let's tell,
it looks like,
uh,

490
00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:01.840
this is one of his vehicles.
Uh,

491
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:05.590
lots of stickers on the stickers on it and they tell you I'm an individual.

492
00:32:05.591 --> 00:32:08.500
I like things other people don't like it.
It's like a pickup truck.

493
00:32:08.501 --> 00:32:09.730
But you could tell he's got like,

494
00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:14.350
<v 2>um,
you know,
like he's got modified exhaust on it.
There's just,</v>

495
00:32:14.351 --> 00:32:17.860
there's a lot going on at night.
This is an interesting premise.

496
00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:21.850
I want to know before he's going to give the answer.
Why do you think

497
00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:26.740
<v 4>some women,
no flags?
I don't know what the problem is.
Like,</v>

498
00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:30.900
why do some women not want to date a guy who's got the money?
Right.

499
00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:34.390
Did the Brown,
the car that wants to be at like,

500
00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:39.740
you know what it is Tom?
Some people star shines too brightly for it.
True.
Yeah.

501
00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:43.070
A lot of people can't handle this stuff.
A lot of people can't handle it.

502
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:46.130
I mean it,
some people can't,
can't handle being around success.

503
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:49.110
That absolutely true.
Intimidator called haters.
Yeah.

504
00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:53.900
And I think a lot of women out there maybe aren't seeing this guy's potential

505
00:32:53.901 --> 00:32:58.060
and maybe he needs to convince you and maybe it needs to explain it to people.

506
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:59.440
You might be honest,
I'm here.
Let's,

507
00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.080
<v 8>as you get older you understand.
It's actually a compliment.</v>

508
00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.940
Why a guy like me is single and then I look around and guys that have big ass

509
00:33:07.941 --> 00:33:12.941
bellies or you know by all their shoes at Kmart have girlfriends.

510
00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:16.130
Why do they have girlfriends?
I'll,
why don't I,

511
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:20.700
if you look too good and you got to go on and on.
Women,

512
00:33:20.701 --> 00:33:24.000
our mother fucking Hayden Cots,

513
00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:27.030
they don't like to see you ball.
Yeah.

514
00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.890
<v 4>See my my theory.
Exactly.
Yup.</v>

515
00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:35.080
<v 8>They don't like to see you ball.
They don't like to see you succeed.</v>

516
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:37.690
They don't like you looking better than that.

517
00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:42.840
They don't want you being desirable because that's gonna make them vulnerable to

518
00:33:45.191 --> 00:33:47.050
you leaving their bitch ass.

519
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:48.583
<v 4>Yup.</v>

520
00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:50.440
<v 8>You hit the gym,</v>

521
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:55.710
you ball in some Badass Nike's or Jordans and dress cool and you ain't got a

522
00:33:56.531 --> 00:34:00.340
girl homey.
It's a compliment to you.

523
00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:04.240
That means these bitches can't step up to your level.

524
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:08.700
<v 4>Yeah.
This dude,
truth knowledge was kind of insight,
you know?</v>

525
00:34:08.701 --> 00:34:09.460
That's what I'm looking for.

526
00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:13.240
<v 8>Women are mother fucking Hayden cots.</v>

527
00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:18.650
<v 4>Yup.
Yeah.
So stupid.
Huh?
It's true.
Fucking dumb.</v>

528
00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:22.080
It's true.
What do you think is true?
What he's saying?
That the,

529
00:34:22.081 --> 00:34:25.310
they're not smart enough to see what he's got to offer.
I think that,

530
00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.770
I think he's onto something with,
um,

531
00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:30.560
with the fact that there's definitely some haters out there.

532
00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:35.090
When men or women see somebody who's really got it going on,

533
00:34:35.091 --> 00:34:37.790
like this guy that there'll be like,

534
00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:45.040
Shamal what bro?
Fuck,
I'm fading,

535
00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:48.230
homie.
I mean,
it's true though,
right?
Absolutely.

536
00:34:48.231 --> 00:34:53.150
I just seen that intimidated sometimes and you know,

537
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:58.700
we have to see,
we have to,
and they're intimidated.
What does he have to offer?

538
00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.120
Well,
I mean the,
in this case,
it's who's got a lot to offer?

539
00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:06.850
<v 8>I don't take it personally.
Look,
I still fuck a lot,
but</v>

540
00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:11.590
those girls that fuck me,
they're afraid to be with me,

541
00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:15.490
but they'll run back and be with a little boy who doesn't even have a car and

542
00:35:15.491 --> 00:35:19.180
lives with his grandma.
Now.
Does that make sense?
And I'm,
like I said,

543
00:35:19.181 --> 00:35:23.650
women are internally very jealous creatures.
They're very insecure.

544
00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:28.800
They constantly measure themselves and they're even competing with you as their

545
00:35:28.811 --> 00:35:32.410
boyfriend,
as their husband has there.
Man,
that's basically what's up.

546
00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.640
So you guys out there,
it was a pleasure,
man.
Until next time.
Bye Bye.

547
00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.190
<v 4>So,
so he's saying</v>

548
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:42.930
<v 2>it's the competitive nature in women that that's why he can't have a</v>

549
00:35:42.931 --> 00:35:45.940
relationship?
I think so.
He's making an interesting point,
right?

550
00:35:45.941 --> 00:35:49.300
I think you're right.
I think he's also saying that,
you know,
in most,
let's say,

551
00:35:49.301 --> 00:35:52.520
traditional relationships,
um,

552
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:57.190
you find that in a lot of cases,
in the traditional relationship,

553
00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:01.460
the man goes,
concedes that the woman is the star,
so to speak.

554
00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:06.550
She's the looker.
She's,
you know,
put the attention on her.
He's saying,

555
00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:09.770
I got a little too much going on.
Oh,

556
00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.240
be the one that shines.
You can shine too,

557
00:36:13.241 --> 00:36:14.520
but don't think you're going to out shine

558
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:17.640
<v 4>me.
Right.
And he,
he,
but he's also saying,
yeah,</v>

559
00:36:17.641 --> 00:36:21.130
that the woman is competitive and,
and,

560
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:24.390
and wants to take that star from him.

561
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:29.540
<v 2>Yeah,
exactly.
I mean,
you,
you know,
I don't want there to be any confusion.</v>

562
00:36:29.541 --> 00:36:33.920
This is not the cool guy club.
Oh,
this is not the cool guy in class.

563
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:37.790
This is the,
a different,
what club is this?
I think this is the rich guy club.

564
00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:41.890
<v 4>Ah,
the bar or club.
You're genuinely,</v>

565
00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:46.120
this guy's a superstar.
Yeah.
I mean,
there's more,
that's what I like to hear.

566
00:36:46.121 --> 00:36:49.360
What he has to say.
I mean,
look,
I hope there's someone out there worthy of him.

567
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:52.070
<v 2>Yeah.
There's,
there's definitely more stuff.
Um,</v>

568
00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:56.160
he put out,
um,
let's see.
Oh,

569
00:36:56.161 --> 00:36:58.890
he did an Instagram live.
So just so you know,

570
00:36:58.891 --> 00:37:03.810
he puts a lot of his stuff on Instagram.
Okay.
Oh boy.
And he has,

571
00:37:03.811 --> 00:37:06.660
um,
he has like,

572
00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:09.450
<v 4>he's got a lot going on a coordinator.
So Graham,</v>

573
00:37:09.451 --> 00:37:14.280
because he's got such a look happen.
You've got a lot going on.

574
00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:18.300
So let me tell you,
first of all,
a lot of money.
Anyway,

575
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:23.490
he's going into houses and he's told us I got a lot of money.

576
00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:26.880
I got a lot of houses.
I got a lot of cars.
I got a private chef.

577
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:32.520
You have millions of dollars in the bank,
right?
Uh,
I do.
I hear,

578
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:37.500
I don't mean to look.
He is fabulous.
Yeah.
I'm,
I like the,

579
00:37:37.501 --> 00:37:40.830
and we're going to watch another clip of him.
He's toned down the facial hair,

580
00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:41.340
right?
Cause

581
00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.620
<v 2>that is from a few years ago.
Oh,
okay.</v>

582
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.560
So this is more update and he got a new hat.

583
00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:51.420
He's got some jewelry,
which I honestly,

584
00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:55.650
it made me regret canceling my jewelry order.
Really.

585
00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:59.820
Remember I bought that.
Um,
I ordered that chain.
Right.

586
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:03.650
And I think it was Pete Holmes made me feel very insecure about the order.

587
00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:07.170
<v 4>Well,
it's,
it cannot,
it's not a great investment piece.
Yeah.</v>

588
00:38:07.171 --> 00:38:11.970
But it's about shining.
It's about,
you know,
the resale is not very good on yeah,

589
00:38:11.971 --> 00:38:14.550
but I'm not going to sell.
It's about letting people know what time it is.

590
00:38:14.551 --> 00:38:18.550
I let them know.
And so anyways,
this guy has definitely,

591
00:38:18.551 --> 00:38:20.310
then people know that this guy's a peacock.

592
00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:22.200
He's definitely a peacock or you know,

593
00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:27.150
letting everybody see is plumage and not everybody's worthy.
Yeah.

594
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:31.880
Okay.
Let's hear what he has to say.
It's pretty cool.
And we got in here,

595
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:35.040
not even 400 man,
the artwork,

596
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:40.180
<v 9>there wasn't $30 but thank you.
This is one piece of artwork.
I mean,</v>

597
00:38:40.181 --> 00:38:44.410
y'all don't want to comment on the fact that I'm sitting in $1,000 custom movie

598
00:38:44.411 --> 00:38:49.120
theater chair and I have five of them.
I mean retarded man,
this law,

599
00:38:49.121 --> 00:38:53.860
all these people under 35 what's wrong with you guys?
Why are you so angry?

600
00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:58.120
Bitter?
Was it nine 11 you guys felt robbed of your youth?

601
00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.380
Was it Columbine?

602
00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:03.370
Was it all these mass shootings that you guys got terrorists struck in you from

603
00:39:03.371 --> 00:39:06.670
your media and mom and dad?
What the fuck?

604
00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:08.930
<v 0>Yeah.
I was happy.
Conscious too.</v>

605
00:39:08.931 --> 00:39:13.640
I liked that he's aware of these social issues contributing to the today's.

606
00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:19.000
That's true.
But he didn't use the r word and I don't appreciate that.
Yeah,

607
00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:20.600
that's a very offensive,

608
00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:23.770
<v 9>yeah.
I was happy when people got rich.</v>

609
00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:29.230
I'm still happy when people get rich on a game show or from one in the lottery

610
00:39:29.231 --> 00:39:34.231
or from winning American idol or from success or a comeback like mock God.

611
00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:40.370
This is just the retardation of your generation.

612
00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:42.370
How long the

613
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:47.260
<v 0>somebody just,
you know,
this is from a live thing he did on Instagram.
Yeah.</v>

614
00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:50.320
And just,
you have to watch this guy on youtube.
By the way,

615
00:39:50.321 --> 00:39:53.410
if you're not watching this on youtube,
he's amazing.

616
00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:58.170
Somebody just wrote your fat.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,

617
00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:00.820
do you get microbladed browse?
Somebody wrote,

618
00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:06.360
<v 9>I'm fake flex.
Huh?
That's all you got to say.
I'm fake flexion.
I'm a fraud.</v>

619
00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:10.020
Right.
If I was a fraud,
where's my goal for me?
Page?

620
00:40:10.021 --> 00:40:13.740
Like all of y'all have acting like you have cancer or trying to get money for

621
00:40:13.741 --> 00:40:14.574
your mom.

622
00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:19.610
<v 0>Yeah.
I mean,
but look at those chains though.
Lots of chains.
You don't like those?</v>

623
00:40:19.611 --> 00:40:23.050
He have no,
those are beautiful chains.
And we look at that outside.
Why?

624
00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:26.430
But outside?
Sure.
Yeah,
the Cuban one there.
It's a very nice,
uh,

625
00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:30.770
you know what I like most is he's got a bedazzled hat on.
You see?

626
00:40:30.771 --> 00:40:32.600
It's like a cheetah pattern or whatever.

627
00:40:32.601 --> 00:40:36.440
And then he's got some sparkle and there's stones that look real gems in there.

628
00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.920
Yeah.
Yeah.
I saw a separate post where he talked about it.
Oh,
okay.

629
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:43.730
He spares no expense.
Oh,
this guide.
I mean,
money just falls out of his pocket.

630
00:40:43.731 --> 00:40:47.360
Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean he just,
dude,

631
00:40:47.361 --> 00:40:51.830
he goes like private chefs.
Yeah.
Probably private planes.

632
00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:56.840
Definitely homes,
multiple homes,
tons of cars,

633
00:40:56.841 --> 00:41:01.590
jewelry,
bedazzled hats.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah.

634
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:04.970
Let's,
what else is he's talking about?
Uh,
let's see.
Is there,
is there any other,

635
00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:08.700
<v 6>that's it for this?
Uh,
that's it for this live stream that we read,</v>

636
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.510
but we have another 20 minutes that we will have prepped for next week.
Great.

637
00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:16.070
Good.
That I think only we might have access to.
Yeah,

638
00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:18.070
but we also have some screenshots in another video.

639
00:41:18.071 --> 00:41:20.080
I don't know if you want to save it for later and go through some of that.
Oh,

640
00:41:20.081 --> 00:41:20.750
let's go.
Let's,

641
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:25.580
<v 0>Oh yeah,
no,
I want to,
I'm,
I'm in Thomas and thrills.
Please show me.</v>

642
00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:28.320
This is all we've been talking about in her home.
What's this guy's name?

643
00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:31.970
Hardrock.
Nick hardrock neck.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

644
00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:34.130
Every now and then just the diamond comes

645
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:38.330
<v 4>along.
Yeah.
There's like,
here's just to give you more insight.
Okay,</v>

646
00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:42.980
so why don't you read,
read the captain.
This is his caption.

647
00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:45.080
If I can get past the image,

648
00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:50.000
I know it's a lovely a Selfie as a son.
Do you see you see the chain?

649
00:41:50.001 --> 00:41:54.830
I want to see the chains,
Tom.
I see the multiple chain,
by the way,
by the way,

650
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:56.870
since we're putting it out there and we're discussing,
we're looking,

651
00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:01.510
40th birthday is coming up.
Yeah,
chains.
He's got,

652
00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:06.170
he's got outside one.
The thick ones.
I will.
You turn 40 once.

653
00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:10.400
Gotcha.
How many,
how much money do you think that is?
I mean for him,

654
00:42:10.401 --> 00:42:14.840
I'm sure it's nothing.
I'm assuming that's,
I don't know.

655
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:18.410
If we get another steakhouse sponsor,
the answer is yes.
Then I can get the chain.

656
00:42:18.411 --> 00:42:22.160
You can get the chain.
Ah,
that'd be awesome.
He's got the,
he's got an eye.

657
00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:25.360
His eyebrows are very fleet.
He looks like a genie,
doesn't eat.

658
00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:28.850
His eyebrows are amazing.
He looks like a,
and his lips are kind of,

659
00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.300
he's doing duck lips for the water.
I think that's natural.

660
00:42:32.301 --> 00:42:33.134
I don't think he's doing it.

661
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:38.180
<v 0>Oh,
okay.
He doesn't need fillers.
Can you please read this caption?
Okay.</v>

662
00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:41.300
This is what he writes.
Once you've dated me,

663
00:42:41.301 --> 00:42:45.500
it's mathematically impossible to do better than me in selecting another mate.

664
00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:47.510
After breakups,

665
00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:52.250
my exes have endured the likes of terminal brain cancer,

666
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:57.170
and in parentheses,
he writes no bullshit suicide by lethal injection.

667
00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.210
Decades of psychotherapy,

668
00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:04.480
present time or in other milder examples had become gay or settled for men who

669
00:43:05.421 --> 00:43:09.440
in some way or another reminded said,
x of me,

670
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:14.150
you will never do better than me.
Hashtag I said never.
Wow.

671
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:19.450
<v 4>Yeah.
22 likes on this one.
Hardrock neck.
Oof.</v>

672
00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:23.100
So women go crazy after they break up with him.
It sounds,

673
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:28.570
where he drives them to suicide.
What?
You know how when you do comedy?

674
00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:32.680
Yeah.
Especially when you start,
you write a bio.

675
00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:38.080
That's bullshit.
But I mean you have to kind of summarize your story.

676
00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:41.860
Yeah.
This caption summarizes his,
why don't you go ahead and give it a read.

677
00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:46.930
<v 0>So this is his bio.
Born in Las Vegas,
Nevada.
Grew up in Manhattan beach,</v>

678
00:43:46.931 --> 00:43:47.764
California,

679
00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:52.750
graduated from UC Berkeley on my 12th Mercedes Benz.

680
00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:56.810
Okay.
That's just thrown in stats.
Here's his other sets.

681
00:43:56.890 --> 00:44:01.480
Houses and Irvine cove,
del Mar,
San Francisco,
West Hollywood,

682
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:06.130

00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:09.120
It's gotta be the haters.
This guy is great.
This guy has everything.

727
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:13.320
I got to set him up with my step sister.

It looks a little like in and out,

732
00:47:29.831 --> 00:47:32.920
but I'm sure it's not in and out.
No.
That's a protein style.

733
00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:37.450
Actually having a private chef name.
No,

736
00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:48.670
I thought he had a 350 million.
No,
I that was his net worth.
Oh,

737
00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.560
maybe you don't understand numbers.
I don't,

738
00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:57.340
<v 2>but that's the value of what he's worth and this is cash value.

752
00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:49.760
like looking in the mirror.

753
00:48:49.761 --> 00:48:54.761
She does her makeup and she has quite a rear end and hard rock.

754
00:48:55.401 --> 00:48:56.570
Nick posted ladies,

755
00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:00.860
if you have an ass like this and are a pure white American,

756
00:49:00.861 --> 00:49:03.170

758
00:49:09.921 --> 00:49:11.780
we'll let me put my face in it.

759
00:49:11.781 --> 00:49:15.380
Every time you bend over the sink to do your makeup,
get at me.

760
00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:21.070
<v 0>That's quite an offer.
Wow.
You know you kind of fit a line.</v>

761
00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:26.400
I'm thinking,
I mean if he's into Adam might be too for it.

762
00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:28.710
Definitely too old.
Fuck.
Do you think you are?

763
00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.410
You think you're worthy of that shit?

764
00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:36.450
I'm definitely not worthy of hardrock Nag this though.
Okay,
here we go guys.

765
00:49:36.451 --> 00:49:39.510
He posted,
but if anybody listening is interested in dating this guy,

766
00:49:39.511 --> 00:49:44.250
he's got 10 turnoffs in a woman in order 10 turn offs in a woman in order of

767
00:49:44.251 --> 00:49:47.130

So guys are women.

768
00:49:47.131 --> 00:49:48.720
If you're listening and you're into hard rock.
Nick,

769
00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:52.890
here's the 10 things he does not like.
Number one.
Oh my God,

770
00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:58.140
why don't we start with 10 uh,
10.
Okay.

771
00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:03.860
Won't shop slash ee slash do yoga anywhere unless she has a coupon slash Groupon

772
00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:08.940
magazine clipping for it.
Lol.
He doesn't want you to be cheap.
Cheap.

773
00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:13.760
Number nine has a child from a previous man.
Oh there it goes around already.

774
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:19.380
Eight has visible facial hair.
Even peach fuzz with three exclamation marks.

775
00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:23.550
Better get that shit lasered off laser and he likes some hairless number seven,

776
00:50:23.551 --> 00:50:27.710
prudish sexually.
Number six never says you.

777
00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.650
I understand that one.
I get it.
He has a lot to offer.

778
00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:35.300
Number five wears perfume from Walmart or Tj Maxx,
et cetera.

779
00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:38.750
Okay for wears too much makeup.
Okay,

780
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:43.880
turn off three vegetarian.
Okay,
well he's very health conscious.

781
00:50:43.881 --> 00:50:46.670
If you look at him and his diet,
he's,

782
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:50.900
he keeps it lean and he keeps it carries it carries it.

783
00:50:50.901 --> 00:50:53.600
Like he's two 10 smoker of any kind is number two.

784
00:50:53.601 --> 00:50:57.340
And number one non Caucasian is his big turnoff.

785
00:50:57.610 --> 00:50:59.830
The most turned off he can go

786
00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:04.140
and non Caucasian.

787
00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:07.270
So I know there's a lot of tears streaming down.

788
00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:12.530
People listening,
people watching and being like,
what?
Well,

789
00:51:12.531 --> 00:51:16.250
no wonder you can't find love.
This is quite a tight list.
I mean we kind of,

790
00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:19.160
I don't want to be the type of person that would assume they can give hardrock

791
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:23.020
nick,
any advice?
But we did watch a lot of millionaire matchmakers.
Yeah.

792
00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:26.290
She was always against the people with lists.
She said,

793
00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:30.140
I can't go into love that way.
I agree.
And he's talking about being single,

794
00:51:30.141 --> 00:51:31.220
but he's got these lists,

795
00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:36.260
but at least he knows what makes his Peter Heart starts with white,

796
00:51:36.261 --> 00:51:40.070
white,
white power.
Yeah.
Wow.

797
00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:43.430
I don't know if he's white though.
I don't think he can.
I don't think he is.

798
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:49.130
I don't think he can claim like he,
he's wanting pure p well,
whatever.

799
00:51:49.131 --> 00:51:52.560
Yeah.
Like I don't think he himself is pure Caucasian.
You're my,

800
00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:55.610
if I'm a betting lady,
I would go native.

801
00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:57.950
Do you think even maybe your tribe or Persia?

802
00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:00.540
Here's a back and I watched the live stream.

803
00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:05.860
He said very aggressively that he is neither Persian or Jewish bull shit.

804
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:09.920
Well,
he's from La,
right?
He's an la native.

805
00:52:09.921 --> 00:52:13.700
I'm going to go Persian on.
I Dunno.
Hell yeah.

806
00:52:13.701 --> 00:52:18.600
He's making a point to say no dude.
Armenian,
Armenian man.

807
00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:21.940
You realize if he's not what you're doing right now.
What am I doing?

808
00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:28.060
Really?
Armenian.
Actually.
I don't think so.
Yeah,

809
00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:32.900
I don't think so.
I just,
I know this type dude.
This is,
this is definitely la guy.

810
00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:37.910
Um,

Happy Friday.

811
00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:42.970
Hashtag that cock bulge though.

813
00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:46.680
<v 2>Uh,

814
00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:51.780
This is a photo of some things he picked up at the grocery store.

815
00:52:51.810 --> 00:52:56.730
I'm done.

He got,

816
00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:01.560
uh,
he got mouthwash.
She got gain and glade and he said,

817
00:53:01.561 --> 00:53:04.650
I,
truth is,
I put those glade cones in my walk in closet.

818
00:53:04.651 --> 00:53:09.120
The mouthwash is for my guest bathrooms.
Hashtag Thicke bitches only.

819
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:12.750
Okay.
I mean,
it really is a gift that never,

820
00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:14.960
<v 0>it hasn't stopped.
He's really amazing.</v>

821
00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:18.530
<v 2>I really hope he picks up the posts because his followers are picking up.</v>

822
00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:24.020
Oh my gosh,
this is a,
a,
a bottle of balsamic vinegar.

823
00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:25.291
And he said,

824
00:53:25.291 --> 00:53:28.500
I told my private chef that I want to price their salad for dinner night.

825
00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:31.740
You told me to pick up some expensive balsamic vinegar,

826
00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:35.970
which I just did exclamation mark.
Personally.
I would have the chef pick it up.

827
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:39.870
I get it.
I would too.
Or instacart.
Like if you're that rich instacart died.
Yeah.

828
00:53:39.871 --> 00:53:43.520
But he probably wants to look at it.
Hold it.
You know,
nobody's getting sure.
Hi.

829
00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:48.270
Hey.
Yeah.
Oh Shit.
Uh,
I love fresh,

830
00:53:48.271 --> 00:53:52.170
horrible egg sprinkle with salt and pepper for a high protein snack before my

831
00:53:52.171 --> 00:53:55.620
chef makes dinner.
All right.
That's really cool man.

832
00:53:57.210 --> 00:54:01.770
<v 4>There's a lot more.
I kind of want to save some of hard rock near.
Yeah.</v>

833
00:54:01.771 --> 00:54:02.700
He's special.

834
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.420
<v 2>Watch one of these videos with one of our guests.</v>

835
00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:08.670
So I'm going to save it for just a little bit later.
Um,

836
00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:13.470
in a moment we're going to have,
uh,

837
00:54:13.471 --> 00:54:16.640
our friend come in here and talk to us.
Oh yeah.

838
00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:20.990
About a couple of things because we need it.
We need to sit down with him.

839
00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:24.200
You know,
you better check your weight.
Privilege,
Tom.
I will check my weight.

840
00:54:24.201 --> 00:54:27.410
Privilege.
Have you heard that?
That's the latest form of privilege.
Yes.

841
00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:30.230
I sign on Twitter.
There's white privilege.

842
00:54:30.231 --> 00:54:33.920
Now I know because of fat people like Bert.
But anyways,

843
00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:39.930
<v 4>we'll be back to talking about photos and Dick's after this quick break</v>

844
00:54:41.410 --> 00:54:42.730
<v 2>and we're back.</v>

845
00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:47.410
We are back in studio with a dear friend,

846
00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:49.760
a great comedian.
Uh,

847
00:54:49.810 --> 00:54:53.950
somebody who greatly helps out this show does a lot of producing for us.

848
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.650
So direct

849
00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:57.920
<v 4>director,
choreographer.
It's Josh Potter.
Everybody.</v>

850
00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:05.240
Hey,
hey.
Hey
ladies.

851
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:08.240
Lemon.
Yeah.
So this weekend I make,

852
00:55:08.241 --> 00:55:10.710
I'm all wet face

853
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:17.270
all those tears streaming down.
Um,
we had a good time.
That was fun this weekend.

854
00:55:17.271 --> 00:55:22.040
It was a fun weekend.
Uh,
boss life,
baby life tour,
bus champ.
Her mother,

855
00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:26.800
Gangbang Boston guys,
man,
just play so many crime chicks.

856
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:30.410
They're just,
believe me,
there's Dna all over that thing.
Josh,

857
00:55:30.411 --> 00:55:34.430
are you scoring checks on the bang bus or what?
All Day?
Make that rock

858
00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:40.490
all damn day for sure.
Buying them up by the pump.
They got 'em stack.

859
00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:44.210
That's right.
You got shit bunks for different hose.
Yeah.
Um,

860
00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:49.070
did you expect I did not expect,
I have not.
I've lived in La a long time now.

861
00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:54.280
Long Beach was the shit that was so dope.
Yeah.
It doesn't even seem like La.

862
00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:57.860
So like it seems far away.
Yeah.
But it's not,
it's right there.

863
00:55:57.890 --> 00:56:00.740
It was unbelievable.
A lot of sluts there.

864
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:04.810
There was just a lot of everything and the crowd was fucking bonkers.
Yeah.

865
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:06.850
There's a reason.
Warren G's.
Yeah.

866
00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:11.450
Ellen and the elements of seen snoop Dogg snoop Dogg's.
Yeah.
Yeah.

867
00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:14.960
Uh,
but more importantly,
Josh,
we were talking about you this weekend.

868
00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:19.320
You're finding you're lovable.
We adore you.
Uh,

869
00:56:19.550 --> 00:56:22.310
but we don't know how you stay alive.

870
00:56:23.730 --> 00:56:28.290
And Tom and I have come to the conclusion that you might be a human cockroach.
I,

871
00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:35.450
well,
let's go through,
let's run through our list of,
Oh yeah,

872
00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:39.360
we spend a lot of time with me this weekend and I've spent over the years.

873
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:42.530
Of course,
human doesn't,

874
00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:46.880
Human Cochran's doesn't really eat.
Never.
You're like getting your life.

875
00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:51.910
I've taken you out to these nice restaurants and you'll sometimes be like,
oh,

876
00:56:51.911 --> 00:56:53.410
I'll have the,
and I'll be like,

877
00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:56.080
and he's going to have an appetizer and he's going to like,

878
00:56:56.170 --> 00:56:57.550
I'll make you order things,

879
00:56:58.150 --> 00:57:02.680
order lunch here and last week everyone's ordering full meals and he's like,

880
00:57:02.681 --> 00:57:05.590
I'll have a cup of soup.
Sounds like when I ordered today,

881
00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:10.030
I got the soup of the day.
That's it.
That's it.
Yeah.

882
00:57:10.031 --> 00:57:13.910
You know you got bog myself down with some food.
Yeah.

883
00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:19.700
What have you eaten so far today?
Nothing.
Okay.
That'll be my first noon.
Yeah,

884
00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:23.880
it's Earl cockroach,
cockroach and then approach eating.
Okay.
The full game.

885
00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:27.160
Incapable of regulating his body temperature.

886
00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:30.310
He has like a near

887
00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:34.030
psychotic persons body.

888
00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:37.630
I think the only guy I've ever met who is this far off.

889
00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:41.980
I mean most guys are like,
you know,
I prefer guys will be like,

890
00:57:41.981 --> 00:57:45.340
I like a little cooler.
You don't really get bothered by the cold,

891
00:57:45.370 --> 00:57:48.730
but you will wear a jacket if it's cold outside.
Oh yeah.
This guy.

892
00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:51.610
I'll tell you some psycho.
I've never met anybody like him.

893
00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:56.560
It'll be like 37 that's fine.
He'll be like,
he's like,

894
00:57:56.670 --> 00:58:00.170
ah,
Kinda hot.
And I'm like,
what are you talking about?
He's like,
he's like,

895
00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:02.830
you're not hot.
I'm like,
no,
no one's hot here.

896
00:58:03.210 --> 00:58:07.710
The airport's dripping off his layers walking on in a tee shirt on the Jessica

897
00:58:07.711 --> 00:58:11.830
crazy person,
total crazy pursued.
Those airports are fucked.

898
00:58:12.010 --> 00:58:14.170
We were at a gig where they were,

899
00:58:14.171 --> 00:58:18.310
it was like downstairs cavernous old theater and the guy,

900
00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:23.270
the guy was wearing a parka that you would go like to hike Mount Everest and he

901
00:58:23.271 --> 00:58:26.860
was like,
sorry,
they didn't turn the heat on and,
and Josh was like,

902
00:58:26.861 --> 00:58:29.920
it feels great.
It doesn't feel great.
That t shirt on.

903
00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:34.860
But how are you burning off any energy because you're not eating,
you're not.

904
00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:39.360
You just have a high metabolism.
It feels,
I guess I I,

905
00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:42.670
I don't think I was from Waterloo,
don't that?
That's true.
I'm from the cold.

906
00:58:42.671 --> 00:58:46.450
I was born in the cold.
Okay,
wait,
tell her I didn't even tell her this.

907
00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:51.640
Tell her the shower thing.
The shower thing you told me.
Oh,
I take cold showers.

908
00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:52.653
What?

909
00:58:55.600 --> 00:59:00.600
I end every shower by cranking the heat off and just letting the cold water.

910
00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:04.210
That's my nightmare.
That is fine.
And how long do you do it for?

911
00:59:04.211 --> 00:59:07.030
How will you tell me?
As long as I can tell you about it.
Why?

912
00:59:07.031 --> 00:59:09.160
Why are you punishing yourself?
It's not a punishment.

913
00:59:09.161 --> 00:59:12.820
It's like an invigoration thing.
It's time to close the shower down.

914
00:59:12.821 --> 00:59:16.660
So let's crank up the cold water and just,
Oh my God,
it's my nightmare.

915
00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:19.750
That is my fucking nightmare.
Your shower with Josh fighter,

916
00:59:19.770 --> 00:59:22.310
we've determined that like if we did the road together,

917
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:26.340
<v 0>I will murder you hot all the time.
Oh my God,</v>

918
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:29.700
he wouldn't be able to tolerate our bedroom.
Oh my God.
I couldn't imagine.

919
00:59:29.701 --> 00:59:34.000
Dream on top of sheets,
right?
I mean,
but you're,

920
00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:36.920
the bed would just be a pool of blood.
Okay,
well let's go.
Let's get back.

921
00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:42.080
Let's get back to Josh pattern.
The smoking of cigarettes smokes all the time.

922
00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:47.060
How many cigarettes are we on now?
This week?
I mean this week per day to only,

923
00:59:47.061 --> 00:59:50.930
I mean,
I don't smoke that much.
All that.
If I could smoke weed perpetually,

924
00:59:50.931 --> 00:59:53.730
I would just do that.
Okay.
They're just a supplement,
you know,

925
00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:57.170
supplement for weed.
Yeah,
pretty much the smoking,

926
00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:59.320
I'm sorry to started the red bull.
I always see you suck.

927
00:59:59.321 --> 01:00:03.230
And Don Don the red ball.
That's how many of those thing keeps me focused.

928
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:04.251
It keeps you focused.

929
01:00:04.251 --> 01:00:08.990
So that's sugar and caffeine and the sugar free sugar free and then s and then

930
01:00:08.991 --> 01:00:13.350
sleep.
I don't know what you're doing for that.
I don't either.
Okay.
I don't,

931
01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:18.170
that's,
I mean I,
I'm bad at it.
Yeah.
I don't get a lot of it.
Right.

932
01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:23.210
So you're a cockroach.
So sleep,
let's walk me through the night.

933
01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:27.200
It depends on the night.
Uh,
during the,
the road.
Yeah.
I uh,

934
01:00:27.201 --> 01:00:32.060
I got a couple hours on the bus,
you know,
but the buses that people say,

935
01:00:32.061 --> 01:00:36.140
it's like the best sleep you ever have.
Cause it's rocking.
And I guess,

936
01:00:36.141 --> 01:00:39.320
I don't know,
but it's still a moving car.
Yeah.
But what about,

937
01:00:39.321 --> 01:00:43.790
we forgot about the last one.
He can't count.
Oh,
well,
yeah,
no,
he's a cockroach.

938
01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.100
Maybe that all,
all those ingredients

939
01:00:46.170 --> 01:00:47.003
<v 7>together,</v>

940
01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:54.213
maybe

941
01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:56.070
<v 0>all these things combined.
You're right key.</v>

942
01:00:56.110 --> 01:00:58.780
It may be contributing to your sexual problems.

943
01:00:58.810 --> 01:01:02.530
We thought with the body temperature thing that the heat is just keeping my

944
01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.860
common.
My body could be so maybe that's it.

945
01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:09.580
I am a hairy guy.
Probably more hairy than time.

946
01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:13.900
You think the hair keeps you warm?
Yes.
Okay,
and my blood is thick.

947
01:01:14.410 --> 01:01:18.970
Okay.
And I just like being cold.
You like being called?
Yes.

948
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:22.600
More than being hot by a mile.
Really?
That's my nephew.
That's my nightmare.

949
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:25.090
[inaudible] you and I are complete opposites like being cold.
Yes.

950
01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:29.770
It feels good to be cold as opposed to being hot.
Of course.
Now hottest sweating.

951
01:01:29.771 --> 01:01:34.330
I like,
I feel better.
But you spoke with doctor drew.
I've never heard somebody.

952
01:01:34.350 --> 01:01:35.183
Okay.

953
01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:43.990
I get hot.
I really get like I want to jump out of my fucking skin.
Yeah,

954
01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:47.690
it really bothers you.
Yeah.
That's how I feel cold.
I get angry.

955
01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:49.100
I'm upset that I have the,

956
01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:52.190
I'm suffering the indignity of being called when there's other options for me.

957
01:01:52.191 --> 01:01:54.740
I don't need to feel this way right now.
I just little why when you're hot,

958
01:01:54.741 --> 01:01:58.160
you don't feel alive.
I don't know.
You feel like,
I hate that.

959
01:01:59.030 --> 01:02:00.890
I hate feeling hot.
Um,

960
01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:05.660
but when you talked to doctor drew about your ejaculations thanks.

961
01:02:05.661 --> 01:02:09.530
So for those of us that aren't familiar,
walk us through your problem.
Uh,

962
01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:14.560
well I can function sexually except for the punctuation point,

963
01:02:15.081 --> 01:02:19.980
which is finishing without the aid of myself.
So you're

964
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.960
<v 4>saying you have to hand manipulate.
Yes.</v>

965
01:02:21.961 --> 01:02:26.100
And for those who are saying that I might be gay,
I wish it was that fucking,

966
01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:31.380
I wish that was the answer.
It was just a guy that if it was just that I was gay,

967
01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:34.560
I would just be like,
yeah,
I'm gay.
And I would just fuck dudes.

968
01:02:34.561 --> 01:02:38.550
And I would probably come all the time and maybe you should try it.
I mean,

969
01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:43.890
if I could get a boner from a dude,
I would definitely go down with these girls.

970
01:02:43.891 --> 01:02:47.550
Just so people know you,
you're,
you know,
you like women,
you're,
you're,

971
01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:51.290
you're getting with women and then the,
you just can't finish.
Right.

972
01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:54.930
You need to finish.
But maybe manually we need,
so you go,

973
01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.420
you go watch this and then you put on a show for them?
Yes.

974
01:02:57.570 --> 01:03:00.510
It depends how they want to get involved,
you know,
sometimes they're like,
here,

975
01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:05.070
here,
wait a minute.
Is this a kink?
No.

976
01:03:05.310 --> 01:03:10.310
I would prefer to just jazz inside or what a doctor just feels about it.
Uh,

977
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:11.910
he has,
you know,

978
01:03:11.911 --> 01:03:16.440
it's gonna take a little bit of communicating more and things like that.
Uh,

979
01:03:16.441 --> 01:03:18.550
I think we determined that,
uh,

980
01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:23.370
a nice prescription for a smoke show is in order just to test it out.

981
01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:27.950
A fucking hottie.
Real pigs,
is that the,

982
01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:31.950
sometimes you know here and there,
but let's call them open.

983
01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:34.800
There's a lot of white privilege.
There's a lot of,

984
01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:39.540
there's a lot of listeners out there and viewers.
Let's put the call out,

985
01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.000
help Josh come.

986
01:03:42.590 --> 01:03:47.130
He needs your help and if you need,
we'll come sponsor telethon.

987
01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:51.480
Yeah.
Nice guy.
All right.
He doesn't sleep much.

988
01:03:51.481 --> 01:03:52.500
Takes showers.

989
01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:58.130
He's going to take it and you'll take them out.
You'll show them.
Yeah.

990
01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:02.550
So let's get a little like just a really,

991
01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:07.380
if you're willing and able reach out,
this is a boy that just needs your help.

992
01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:11.420
Yes.
Yeah.
Help him out.
Let them try.
Just need us smoke

993
01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:14.430
now.
Would you,

994
01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:17.910
you'd be willing to date somebody in the entertainment adult entertainment

995
01:04:17.911 --> 01:04:20.430
industry.
You find clothes or hey,

996
01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:25.290
I actually would prefer to date a girl who's done porn.
I mean prefer,
I mean,

997
01:04:25.291 --> 01:04:28.710
sure.
I guess I can go that way.
Prefer for,
I've never done it,

998
01:04:28.711 --> 01:04:31.150
so I don't know what you're curious.
I am saying,

999
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:35.490
I think I could handle it for just froze for just four strokes a day.

1000
01:04:35.491 --> 01:04:40.260
You can help.
It's something that,

1001
01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:43.710
uh,
you know,
we want this to happen.
Yes,
for sure.

1002
01:04:43.711 --> 01:04:47.760
I want it to happen for my whole life.
So,
I mean,
if this doesn't work,

1003
01:04:47.761 --> 01:04:52.560
then you know,
we might have to consider other medical options,
but really,

1004
01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:55.110
maybe,
I mean,
if this doesn't work,
I don't know.

1005
01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:56.950
We'll have to take it to the next level.

1006
01:04:56.951 --> 01:05:00.360
We'll have to ask doctor drew with that is okay.
You know,
I hope,

1007
01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.930
I really do hope a really hot woman reaches out and she was like,

1008
01:05:03.931 --> 01:05:06.960
I'll go out with them and then we can test this theory.
Yeah.

1009
01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:11.670
It takes someone who's a Gamer and he just wants to come on as a comic fight

1010
01:05:11.671 --> 01:05:16.250
through it.
Oh,
before we forget,
let's talk about,
um,
what's your,
what's your,
uh,

1011
01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:20.860
show coming up?
March 22nd Improv lab here in Hollywood.
Uh,

1012
01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:25.390
tickets in my bio on my Instagram and on my Twitter if you want to scoop them
up.

1013
01:05:25.690 --> 01:05:29.710
And what's the,
uh,
what's your,
what's the handle for your,
oh,

1014
01:05:29.711 --> 01:05:34.711
at j underscore potter is my Twitter and Josh underscore potter is my Instagram

1015
01:05:34.961 --> 01:05:38.200
because some asshole fucking took the other one.
There you go.
And listen,

1016
01:05:38.201 --> 01:05:41.370
he's hilarious.
There's a reason I've taken him,
uh,

1017
01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:45.130
on the road everywhere we learned another reason I think.
Well,

1018
01:05:45.131 --> 01:05:49.180
now that I'm an employee,
yeah.
What do you think my value is?

1019
01:05:49.181 --> 01:05:53.080
Like let's say if I died on the road.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
What do you think?

1020
01:05:53.081 --> 01:05:55.860
Like you could get for me,
like life.
I don't know if that

1021
01:05:57.990 --> 01:06:01.170
expense,
you know,
we discussed a thing going,

1022
01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:06.180
remember that Tracy Morgan was in this horrific bus accident and he lost,

1023
01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:12.210
he lost his friend and he was injured and Walmart settled for just extraordinary

1024
01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:18.880
because of its potential earnings.
So I was fantasizing about that.
Yeah,

1025
01:06:18.881 --> 01:06:22.840
like a,
we were going through a snowy pass to get to Rhea and I said,
hey man,

1026
01:06:22.841 --> 01:06:26.660
we might get some that Tracy Morgan and you guys were thinking like,

1027
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:29.170
how much does Josh Potter World?
I'd be the one that dies.

1028
01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.490
He of course has to die.
But what I,
uh,

1029
01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:35.590
what I was thinking was like is that it would be kind of like money if we were

1030
01:06:35.591 --> 01:06:39.430
in this bus accident and that he's just a little hurt.
Like he's like,
ah,

1031
01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:43.870
my arm,
I think it might have broken my arm and that.
Then I'm like,
well,

1032
01:06:43.930 --> 01:06:47.200
I gotta get this money.
So then I,
I take a crowbar and I just started,

1033
01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:52.830
<v 7>he was like,
it's just like laying there under a piece of,</v>

1034
01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.600
you know,
part of the bus falls on me and I'm like,
Tom

1035
01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:02.170
and Tom's like,
it's too far.

1036
01:07:02.171 --> 01:07:05.800
You're too hurt is broken.

1037
01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:10.820
Then like shut up matches my style and he's on the phone with you or something.

1038
01:07:11.711 --> 01:07:15.700
He's like,
I'm fine,
Christina.
Joshua's to heart,
he's mortally injured.

1039
01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:19.170
I have to finish him up.
I'd be like,
Chris.

1040
01:07:21.310 --> 01:07:26.230
And then the cops show up and they're like,
what happened?
And I'm like,
well,

1041
01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:28.410
I,
he went flying like,

1042
01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:32.340
well it looks like he has like blunt force trauma to the head.
Like yeah,

1043
01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:33.490
all this shit was fun.

1044
01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:38.860
Crowbar when flying your bounce off his head six times and you know,

1045
01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:43.840
it was weird.
It was a lie.
All a blur.
You got to run this past your therapist.

1046
01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:48.670
And then they're like,
Tom,
Tom deserves a big check.

1047
01:07:48.671 --> 01:07:51.290
He had to go through this,
his own horrible experience.

1048
01:07:52.770 --> 01:07:56.510
Give them $100 million and I'll be like,
Ooh,
I miss job.

1049
01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:00.040
Got To

1050
01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:07.690
get some money from it too.
And they're like,

1051
01:08:07.930 --> 01:08:10.300
why is his but his skulls bashed.

1052
01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:15.410
That's really consistent with some foul play here.
Yeah,
man.

1053
01:08:15.411 --> 01:08:17.810
You know how the snow is.
I check with the driver.
Yeah.

1054
01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:24.220
My no more how you guys really had a good time on this trip pod talking about

1055
01:08:24.351 --> 01:08:29.350
ways to kill Josh Potter
next.

1056
01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:35.240
That was a lot of fun,
man.
Thanks for having me.

1057
01:08:35.241 --> 01:08:38.850
I'm going to have some soup.
I'm pretty pumped about it.
Jesus.
Yeah,
let's go get,

1058
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:41.000
let's go get our lunch and we'll be back.

1059
01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:46.580
We'll be right
and we're back

1060
01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:49.030
<v 10>and this is a real treat.
People did not know.</v>

1061
01:08:49.031 --> 01:08:51.640
We didn't tease this and let people know secrets.

1062
01:08:51.670 --> 01:08:55.420
We are joined by Detroit's own.
Danny Brown.

1063
01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:59.410
Hey Man,
thank you guys for having me.
Dude.

1064
01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:04.440
This was like a such a trip when I first you not a DM to while ago.

1065
01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:09.720
I think it was that somebody tipped me off that I think you had mentioned our

1066
01:09:10.270 --> 01:09:10.961
podcast,

1067
01:09:10.961 --> 01:09:15.961
maybe an interview or something when it's like you're a big podcast fan I guess

1068
01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:20.110
in like the last few years.
I guess when you make so much music,

1069
01:09:20.111 --> 01:09:24.390
the last thing you want to do is listen to music.
Yeah,
some sense of like,
okay,

1070
01:09:24.391 --> 01:09:27.970
that makes sense.
When podcast like a big deal for it though,

1071
01:09:27.971 --> 01:09:31.600
you know like it's something I could just put on long flights.

1072
01:09:31.601 --> 01:09:34.720
I think that was the big deal for sure.
Like boom,
here's the deal man.

1073
01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:38.680
<v 7>Long flight</v>

1074
01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:43.250
<v 10>for sure.
You could definitely knock out a few episodes and you know,</v>

1075
01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:45.250
you know your home.

1076
01:09:45.251 --> 01:09:49.450
So that's how it has definitely a big deal for me on long flights.
Yeah,

1077
01:09:49.470 --> 01:09:50.770
it's a game changer.
Right?

1078
01:09:50.771 --> 01:09:53.680
Especially you either get in like a really cool conversation.

1079
01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:56.230
I said one time I was listening to one,
like some war shit.

1080
01:09:56.290 --> 01:09:57.730
I don't know how I even got up on that shit,

1081
01:09:57.731 --> 01:10:00.910
but I listened to a war podcast and they were talking about the nuclear wars and

1082
01:10:00.911 --> 01:10:02.850
all that type of shit and that type of shit you don't listen to

1083
01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:07.380
<v 7>if you eat an edible before a flight</v>

1084
01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:09.850
<v 10>[inaudible] or something like that,
you're like,
aw man,</v>

1085
01:10:09.851 --> 01:10:12.250
my anxiety's going through the roof edibles.

1086
01:10:12.251 --> 01:10:14.200
But I learned that I can't take them on flights.

1087
01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:18.310
Last time it took an attaboy almost pushed the button.
Really?
I don't know why.

1088
01:10:18.311 --> 01:10:19.110
I just kept looking at them,

1089
01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:21.020
<v 7>but I didn't want to push this.</v>

1090
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.200
I don't know what's going to happen,
but my heart's beating fast.

1091
01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:30.050
We sweat to push.
The last flight

1092
01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:34.650
<v 10>took it on was was a flight to Australia and that's our fucking long flight.</v>

1093
01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:38.520
You have the anxiety and then you're like,
you're like,
I'm going to come down.

1094
01:10:38.850 --> 01:10:41.130
I just will be all right,
and then they're like,
ah,
there's 11 more hours.

1095
01:10:41.131 --> 01:10:43.700
You're like,
oh shit.
Like it just,
it just fucks.

1096
01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:47.920
<v 7>Yeah.
Why would you do that to yourself?
I can't even take drugs in public.</v>

1097
01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.940
It gets too fucked up for me.
Like I have to just be alone.

1098
01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:53.740
I know you're not supposed to do drugs alone,
but that's probably it.

1099
01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:54.863
That's time doing

1100
01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:59.900
<v 10>embarrass myself in front of people.
I like doing like long flights like that.</v>

1101
01:10:59.901 --> 01:11:01.910
I try to break them up.
Like if I go to Australia,

1102
01:11:01.911 --> 01:11:05.240
I tried to come here for a few days.
They ain't go to Hawaii for a few days.

1103
01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:08.930
Didn't go to Australia,
but oh,
that's the way to do it then just break it up.

1104
01:11:09.170 --> 01:11:11.150
But the um,
I mean Xanax.

1105
01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:13.900
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1106
01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:20.310
Wake up.
Are you there?
Are you on any time you want any time?
Be like,
shit,

1107
01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.473
that's a good plan.

1108
01:11:23.770 --> 01:11:26.130
You don't know those that you're a big mommy

1109
01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:32.550
try.
That's right.
You came in talking about butt plug because

1110
01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:36.310
the new guy into the cool guy club,

1111
01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.270
uncle Terry,
his butt plug,
because

1112
01:11:52.090 --> 01:11:53.680
he is nasty.

1113
01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:03.640
[inaudible] have to pick anything.

1114
01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:08.070
You know,
in this day and age,
you know,
it's hard to be yourself.

1115
01:12:11.150 --> 01:12:15.740
You know what I'm saying?
[inaudible] out there now.

1116
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:19.500
Have you seen him?
Do you watch our show?
I seen him like in real life.

1117
01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:30.540
I hadn't really seen last time you guys had like a,
a retro one.

1118
01:12:30.541 --> 01:12:35.541
Like there's multiple [inaudible] life is like real job.

1119
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:45.930
I start to wonder what his personal life about that.

1120
01:12:45.931 --> 01:12:49.680
You would do this on that.
You could just do this like no one,

1121
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:52.290
no one ever finds out.
Do you tell people what you like?
What do you do?

1122
01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:57.830
I wonder that all the clubs when you go did somebody at the bank today,

1123
01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:00.693
Terri

1124
01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:08.030
[inaudible] you got some problems too.
You get what I'm saying?
But

1125
01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:14.230
Zilla
by the way,

1126
01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:16.260
we didn't even,
I didn't even tell you this.

1127
01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:19.890
I wish I got head from throws Zillow.

1128
01:13:20.370 --> 01:13:23.340
Zillow came to my Dallas show and I just saw it on Twitter.
She was like,

1129
01:13:23.341 --> 01:13:26.130
I'm finally here.
And she took a picture and post it and I was like,

1130
01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:30.810
hi throat Zillow.
But she didn't,
you know,
I didn't get the show on a bummer.

1131
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:35.760
Yeah.
Throw Zillow,
follow her on snapchat.
Yeah.

1132
01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:37.800
That's a good follower.

1133
01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:44.430
[inaudible] has great content,

1134
01:13:44.970 --> 01:13:48.920
man.
I always loved the,
uh,

1135
01:13:49.170 --> 01:13:53.430
the juxtaposition of her,
her skills.
And then she was like,

1136
01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:54.630
I'm going to get gas.

1137
01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:59.660
[inaudible] she'd take the whole family to the buffet.

1138
01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:07.530
Zilla as again,
somebody very comfortable with herself.

1139
01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:12.190
I a recent,
when you guys

1140
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:14.260
<v 11>and knew it had left me in tears,</v>

1141
01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:19.300
the one this motherfucking and brought a damn rat called God.

1142
01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:24.940
That shit had me crying,
man.
Yeah,
that shit was crazy.

1143
01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:29.460
We don't like to talk about McDaniels.
That motherfucker had a Derecho

1144
01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:35.650
and it was San Francisco,
which was the most intriguing part of it.

1145
01:14:36.450 --> 01:14:37.840
That would have thought that would've been like,

1146
01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:43.753
<v 7>yeah,</v>

1147
01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:48.520
be like an intro for my next album was

1148
01:14:50.830 --> 01:14:51.663
fucking me.

1149
01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:09.680
<v 11>Yeah,
definitely have an uncle with dead laying dialect right there.</v>

1150
01:15:09.710 --> 01:15:10.543
Yeah,
for sure.

1151
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:15.530
And then there's also some psycho who's bringing in fucking Ted raccoons.
I mean,

1152
01:15:15.531 --> 01:15:16.364
yeah,

1153
01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:21.740
we equal and every Thanksgiving really like of the Midwest.
Yeah.
No

1154
01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:31.580
wait.
Are you for real?
I don't know.
My aunt does it,
but it's cool

1155
01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:37.340
off.
Still be in his mouth.

1156
01:15:39.150 --> 01:15:44.150
[inaudible]

1157
01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:52.220
I guess it's,
it's,
it's a hood delicacy,

1158
01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:15.260
coon hunting.
Shine a light.
Cause they kind of

1159
01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:21.790
just affect the way the motherfucker be on the table though.

1160
01:16:35.070 --> 01:16:38.920
You definitely live my dream and that you fucking made it as a rapper.

1161
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:42.020
I think that's the coolest thing ever.
It took a long time.

1162
01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:47.870
I never learned how to rap.
Yeah.
You always say that that was,
yeah,

1163
01:16:47.871 --> 01:16:49.310
it was the weirdest shit.
What?
I mean,

1164
01:16:49.311 --> 01:16:51.080
I tell her if write the story probably a thousand times,

1165
01:16:51.081 --> 01:16:55.070
but the first time ever rap was kindergarten.
I said kindergarten,

1166
01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:59.210
I was in kindergarten,
we was showing tale,

1167
01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:01.910
but I didn't know and I didn't have nothing to show or pill,

1168
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:05.330
so I just like fuck it.
And I just had a little rap in front of the class.

1169
01:17:05.331 --> 01:17:06.590
And then once I finished the class,

1170
01:17:06.591 --> 01:17:10.810
like Kraft and stood up and did the teacher was all like,
you know,
she,

1171
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:12.280
she really encouraged it a lot.

1172
01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:15.560
Anytime we would have like some type of school play or some shit like rap,

1173
01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:17.900
rap always putting me in shit to make me rap.

1174
01:17:17.901 --> 01:17:19.910
So I guess that they started with that.

1175
01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:23.600
And then I remember after that getting the confidence from the school I rat from

1176
01:17:23.601 --> 01:17:25.010
my cousin was like an older cousin,
you know,

1177
01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:26.690
he lists a lot of rap music and shit.

1178
01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:30.120
So I wrapped the him and then the look on his face after I was finished,

1179
01:17:30.121 --> 01:17:34.010
she was like,
you didn't write that.
Like he just had a weird,
oh this,

1180
01:17:34.370 --> 01:17:38.710
I got some here.
So
Brian,
like what,
what,

1181
01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:42.140
what was your kindergarten?
Yeah.
But it was always,
you know,
oh,

1182
01:17:42.170 --> 01:17:44.150
you got to think that's like the 80 so it was that hope.

1183
01:17:44.151 --> 01:17:48.190
My name is dede place to be so fresh is lead,

1184
01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:53.570
let's say close to what I say every day like that,
you know,

1185
01:17:53.571 --> 01:17:56.210
it wasn't like no real lyrical miracle Shit.
You know?

1186
01:17:56.270 --> 01:18:01.250
That's how I would right now I bought a book,
I bought a book

1187
01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:06.440
<v 2>when I was in like fifth grade,
maybe fourth grade.
And it was like,</v>

1188
01:18:06.810 --> 01:18:08.990
uh,
explain hip hop.

1189
01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:11.440
<v 11>Oh wait,
one of those.
Yeah.
And it was like,</v>

1190
01:18:11.441 --> 01:18:15.620
it had like run DMC on it and it was like death means,
you know,

1191
01:18:15.650 --> 01:18:18.220
it's like all the slayer.
Oh yeah.
And I was like,
oh.

1192
01:18:18.530 --> 01:18:20.890
And I would like sit with it and be like,
you don't even know what that means.

1193
01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.940
And that's a weird,
because every place,
like in America,

1194
01:18:24.941 --> 01:18:26.440
like everybody has like slang,

1195
01:18:26.441 --> 01:18:28.750
but it could be like words that mean different shit.

1196
01:18:28.751 --> 01:18:32.170
But it's the same word in different places to him.
Yeah.
So that's pretty weird.

1197
01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:37.930
What's the,
what's the latest Detroit Slang?
I mean,
to be honest with you,

1198
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:39.190
I live in Detroit my whole life,

1199
01:18:39.191 --> 01:18:42.390
but I've been in the suburbs probably like the last 10 years.
I'm sorry.

1200
01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:44.540
I don't know what the fuck is going on in Detroit.

1201
01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:47.980
Every time I pop up it's like a new big ass under Armour store somewhere like

1202
01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:51.060
going down.
Yeah.

1203
01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:56.480
[inaudible] kind of blowing up though.

1204
01:18:58.790 --> 01:19:01.600
I go down there,
I go downtown,
I'd go down to the city and it was like,

1205
01:19:01.601 --> 01:19:02.620
what the fuck is going on?

1206
01:19:02.621 --> 01:19:06.010
Cause I have a studio still in the city so I have to go work.

1207
01:19:06.011 --> 01:19:09.140
Y'all going in June.
I hope you're right.
I shouldn't be all right.

1208
01:19:09.190 --> 01:19:12.580
But I definitely will be starting to work,
but I should be home.

1209
01:19:12.810 --> 01:19:16.450
<v 2>Um,
yeah,
last time I was there.
Oh,
so I was there like a year ago.</v>

1210
01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:21.210
They were like all these different,
uh,
pro like,
you know,
building a new stadium.

1211
01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:24.410
<v 11>A lot of nights as hotels now,
which is weird.</v>

1212
01:19:24.411 --> 01:19:26.010
Like I'm talking about a place they used to be like,

1213
01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:29.940
crank didn't heavens are no hotels.
No,
it's weird,
right?

1214
01:19:29.941 --> 01:19:33.580
Like with fucking free breakfast and shit and hipsters with fucking car hardhats

1215
01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:35.490
on and look at worst,

1216
01:19:37.050 --> 01:19:39.240
the biggest trip choice airport.

1217
01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:45.420
<v 2>Well only because like especially let's say 10 like within the last 10 years</v>

1218
01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:50.410
people were always talking about like the economic downturn of Detroit,
right.

1219
01:19:50.411 --> 01:19:53.770
Things like falling apart and houses abandoned all this stuff and you're like

1220
01:19:53.771 --> 01:19:57.580
Detroit's in rough shape.
And then it would be,
it's a big uh,

1221
01:19:57.610 --> 01:20:02.450
Delta connection point.
Yeah.
So you'd land there and you'd be like,
I don't know,

1222
01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:04.720
you'd expect like for some reason in your head like,

1223
01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:06.730
oh it's going to be like Fallujah in here or something like that.

1224
01:20:06.730 --> 01:20:07.810
Like the Cleveland Air Force

1225
01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:11.220
<v 7>and then you go in and there's like that psychedelic</v>

1226
01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:16.620
and then there's like a,
a lady on the,
on the speakers going like,

1227
01:20:16.650 --> 01:20:20.930
what's going on in the day?
You're like,
oh shit,

1228
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.050
this is kind of cool.

1229
01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:25.800
It would be like the coolest airport experience and that he's a comic.

1230
01:20:25.801 --> 01:20:27.700
That's all you do airport.

1231
01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:32.570
So I remember I have been a two nights I spent in Detroit airport or just amping

1232
01:20:32.610 --> 01:20:33.091
stranded.

1233
01:20:33.091 --> 01:20:35.290
There are a couple of times because of weather and then they shuttle you out to

1234
01:20:35.291 --> 01:20:38.490
that fucking sad ass hotel like a mile.
Yeah.
You're like,

1235
01:20:38.491 --> 01:20:41.070
this is fucking terrible.
But the right there,

1236
01:20:41.071 --> 01:20:44.070
Paul was there a big party and I had some good food there.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1237
01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:46.530
There's like a total resurgence now.
I know I have to go see it.

1238
01:20:46.531 --> 01:20:48.400
I haven't heard so long and really change it

1239
01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:52.910
<v 10>as much as you know.
Uh,
have I lived there my whole life,</v>

1240
01:20:52.911 --> 01:20:55.730
but the past 10 years I can say I don't really know what the fuck

1241
01:20:57.580 --> 01:20:59.660
<v 7>I stay in the suburbs.
I stay in my house.</v>

1242
01:21:00.130 --> 01:21:03.520
<v 10>I don't really go to CD that much,
but when I do I always see some shit.</v>

1243
01:21:03.521 --> 01:21:05.830
Like what the fuck?
You ain't got avocado toast.

1244
01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:09.740
<v 7>He's kind of resent it though in a way.</v>

1245
01:21:10.010 --> 01:21:13.420
<v 10>When something like that's coming through,
we've been fucked up for so long.</v>

1246
01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:16.850
I'm just happy to see like basically put a future on the kids and shit.

1247
01:21:16.851 --> 01:21:18.890
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
It would be,
you know,

1248
01:21:18.891 --> 01:21:20.750
like Detroit was always a big city,

1249
01:21:20.751 --> 01:21:23.720
but we would never treat it like one in that sense.
You know what I mean?

1250
01:21:23.721 --> 01:21:25.730
Like it's not like a tourist location.
Motherfucker.

1251
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:27.290
<v 7>I'm going to go to Detroit right</v>

1252
01:21:31.670 --> 01:21:35.520
<v 10>there and do some cool shit.
That's cool.
So is it like you're happy for it?
Yeah.</v>

1253
01:21:35.521 --> 01:21:38.430
Yeah.
That's cool.
That's cool.
Um,
so yeah,

1254
01:21:38.431 --> 01:21:42.300
we were talking right before you came on that like your videos are so dope.
Huh?

1255
01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:45.000
Thank you.
I like I say,
I can't really take too much credit for that.

1256
01:21:45.001 --> 01:21:46.240
I don't know man.
You're,

1257
01:21:46.410 --> 01:21:50.560
you're definitely greenlighting Asian and like,

1258
01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:55.700
so are you a big as part of the come from the fact like that you're a movie

1259
01:21:56.161 --> 01:21:58.790
cinema fan or something or no,
no,
no.
I don't,

1260
01:21:58.830 --> 01:22:02.930
I don't even have the attention span to watch movies and shit.
Really Real.
What?

1261
01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:03.990
I play a lot of video games.

1262
01:22:04.230 --> 01:22:08.040
What is like the video process like for like when you have a song and you're

1263
01:22:08.041 --> 01:22:09.870
like,
all right,
we need to make a video.

1264
01:22:09.871 --> 01:22:14.871
Do people start pitching you really like I make music and music and I never

1265
01:22:15.241 --> 01:22:18.810
really think of what to make a video for anything like that.

1266
01:22:18.811 --> 01:22:22.030
So you leave my managers that might be like this one,
this one,
this one really.

1267
01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:27.150
And then when I decide what song will do and then we'll just get a whole bunch

1268
01:22:27.151 --> 01:22:29.000
of treatments in,
you know,

1269
01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:32.760
and then you just go over to treatments and figure out which one is cool and

1270
01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:33.673
usually work like that.

1271
01:22:33.810 --> 01:22:37.470
<v 7>How the fuck do you become a rapper?
Like people are like,</v>

1272
01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:39.360
how do you become a comedian?
And we go,
okay,

1273
01:22:39.361 --> 01:22:43.760
you just go to the comedy club and looking at the same shit.
I feel like it's,

1274
01:22:43.770 --> 01:22:45.530
I feel like it's more special.
Crazy

1275
01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:51.450
<v 10>career I would say.
I mean what,
what it was like,
cause I was,</v>

1276
01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:55.690
I came in that era,
you know,
hip hop was like this.
Dang.

1277
01:22:55.691 --> 01:22:58.780
Have you had to have an image?
She had to have a look like I've,

1278
01:22:58.781 --> 01:23:01.930
I've been in so many,
like labeled me this early and it was like,

1279
01:23:01.931 --> 01:23:02.591
the music is dope,

1280
01:23:02.591 --> 01:23:07.580
but you don't have to look what the fuck dumb dirty motherfucker from Detroit

1281
01:23:08.050 --> 01:23:09.910
braids and a missing tooth.
And they was like,

1282
01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:12.690
this is the day like 50 cent and everybody had muscles.

1283
01:23:13.650 --> 01:23:17.260
Is that 50 cent story true?
Yeah.
I live with Tony Y'all for like a year.

1284
01:23:17.770 --> 01:23:20.530
You live with Tony.
So many stories with that

1285
01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:27.070
in New York and La.
Got It.
Hold on.
So for people that don't know,

1286
01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:29.350
I know that,
uh,
I guess,

1287
01:23:29.351 --> 01:23:33.250
did that come from like g unit was we're signing you,

1288
01:23:33.670 --> 01:23:37.930
is that from living with Tony?
It's a long story.
Like I said in the beginning,

1289
01:23:37.931 --> 01:23:38.764
what I would do,
I would,

1290
01:23:38.770 --> 01:23:42.170
I would just literally I had a connection at Rockafella records.
Hey,

1291
01:23:42.171 --> 01:23:43.300
on rd or that like my music.

1292
01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:46.180
So I would take these 12 hour greyhound trips to New York,

1293
01:23:46.810 --> 01:23:49.930
way before cell phones,
all that shit,
calling on pay phones and this and that.

1294
01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:53.680
How surfing [inaudible] stay with and go out and you know,

1295
01:23:53.710 --> 01:23:55.030
and I will record these mix tapes.

1296
01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:59.860
You are a comedian was making mix tapes in the weekend and go back home and then

1297
01:23:59.861 --> 01:24:01.840
I will make,
I had so many mixed tapes from doing that,

1298
01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:05.140
but then I ended up going to jail and when I was locked up for that year,

1299
01:24:05.170 --> 01:24:06.820
I was locked up for like a year when I was locked up,

1300
01:24:06.821 --> 01:24:08.470
my brother would put my music on the Internet.

1301
01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:11.710
And what happened was by the time I got out of jail,

1302
01:24:11.711 --> 01:24:13.510
I already had like a name on blogs and shit.

1303
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:15.670
Like hip hop blogs were like post my music and shit.

1304
01:24:15.671 --> 01:24:18.220
So when I got to jail like Oh,
that's what I'm gonna do now.

1305
01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:21.100
Isn't that a trip in and of itself that you get out of jail and you're like,

1306
01:24:21.130 --> 01:24:23.630
oh shit.
People like,
yeah,
but it still wasn't like a,

1307
01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:26.710
like it wasn't gonna get me a record deal.
Tension.
Okay.
So,
like I say,

1308
01:24:26.711 --> 01:24:27.780
I had to take it back to it,

1309
01:24:27.781 --> 01:24:31.900
some standup comedian type shit and I would go to open mics to sign your name on

1310
01:24:31.901 --> 01:24:34.510
the list and you know,
type shit.
You know what I'm saying?
So,

1311
01:24:34.630 --> 01:24:35.740
and then I started to make,

1312
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:39.580
because I knew it didn't matter for me to have my music all over these blogs and

1313
01:24:39.581 --> 01:24:41.200
no one in my city knew who the fuck I was.

1314
01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:45.250
So it had to go around and go east Oakland mice and get my name known in the

1315
01:24:45.251 --> 01:24:46.660
city because at the end of the day,

1316
01:24:46.661 --> 01:24:49.520
like at a record company reached back up like who's cracking in the city or

1317
01:24:49.521 --> 01:24:52.480
what's,
you know,
even though I got my music around on these blogs and shit,

1318
01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:54.730
nobody knew who the fuck I am.
It's not going to add up.

1319
01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:59.910
So I got my name out and then I ended up meeting the manager and for meeting

1320
01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:01.930
that manager,
you know,
stuff just started rolling,

1321
01:25:01.931 --> 01:25:05.350
snowballing from there of Shit Dude.
Okay.
So where,

1322
01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:09.800
where does a not at 28 off situation fit in that is that I used to go record in

1323
01:25:09.801 --> 01:25:14.200
the studio in New York,
in Queens,
which was um,
but this is all on your own?

1324
01:25:14.201 --> 01:25:16.240
Like trying to put it,
like I say,
the ANR that I met,

1325
01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:21.250
he would take me to the studio,
I make my mixed tapes and that was in Queens.

1326
01:25:21.310 --> 01:25:24.790
And when that studio,
when I was,
I guess I was in jail or whatever password,

1327
01:25:24.970 --> 01:25:26.320
when that studio shut down,

1328
01:25:26.321 --> 01:25:30.280
the engineer from there I started working for [inaudible] and then one day they

1329
01:25:30.281 --> 01:25:33.610
came to Detroit and the engineer just was calling me like the week,

1330
01:25:33.611 --> 01:25:35.850
like you were in the deed,
whatever.
But then when you get some weed and we yell,

1331
01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:36.430
Y'all Blah Blah Blah,

1332
01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:39.190
I read it even we pray and talk to each other in years type shit.

1333
01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:41.440
And then I just showed up to the hotel room,
you know,

1334
01:25:41.630 --> 01:25:44.830
brought him weed or whatever.
And then he was like,
oh,
you got some,
you know,

1335
01:25:44.831 --> 01:25:47.020
he knew me from making music,
so he's like,
you got some new shit.

1336
01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:48.610
You know what I'm saying?
I'm like,
Oh shit.
Yeah I do.

1337
01:25:48.611 --> 01:25:52.210
I just put a video out and I show my video and he just,

1338
01:25:52.450 --> 01:25:54.550
he didn't let me leave after that shit.
Really believe

1339
01:25:56.070 --> 01:25:57.280
he won't even let me go pack clothes.

1340
01:25:57.281 --> 01:25:58.620
So I'm going to go grab some clothes like no,

1341
01:25:58.630 --> 01:26:01.480
you with me and threw me out the next day and I was with him for like a year.

1342
01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:04.040
No Shit.
Okay then what

1343
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:08.990
<v 11>happens?
Cause I've heard this and I purposely didn't want to uh,</v>

1344
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:10.580
look up details.

1345
01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:15.620
What I heard was that like you're going to sign with g unit and then 50 cent.

1346
01:26:15.621 --> 01:26:18.380
It's back to what you were saying was like,
oh,
but your,
your looks not right.

1347
01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:22.440
Yeah.
Back in those days I wear like super tight.
Ask any juries.
Yeah,

1348
01:26:24.730 --> 01:26:27.550
well call them tiny pants.
Shout out the bass.
God,
you know what I'm saying?

1349
01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:31.660
Skinny jeans I can even pull up.
So they'll just be like,
way down here.

1350
01:26:31.661 --> 01:26:36.040
I'm a hoe ass is hanging out,
colorful draws and shit.
But,

1351
01:26:36.041 --> 01:26:36.874
uh,

1352
01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:41.200
I remember we did a show in Connecticut somewhere like that,

1353
01:26:41.201 --> 01:26:43.290
but they had a show and then I just worried,

1354
01:26:43.291 --> 01:26:46.240
he's like super tight white and skinny jeans

1355
01:26:47.850 --> 01:26:52.240
and he got all these gangsters around.
But before that he'd been told me like,

1356
01:26:52.241 --> 01:26:55.270
you know,
you need to look more threatening

1357
01:26:57.050 --> 01:27:01.470
these jeans that had like dollar signs on the back pockets.

1358
01:27:01.730 --> 01:27:05.620
They were huge.
Yeah,
just look terrible.
I remember,

1359
01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:09.310
I remember when I was wearing skinny jeans and shit,

1360
01:27:09.311 --> 01:27:12.850
I was getting girls and stuff,
you know,
like I'll go to the shows now,

1361
01:27:12.851 --> 01:27:13.690
can meet girls and shit.

1362
01:27:13.691 --> 01:27:18.691
But then he gave me his big ass jeans wearing the with like vans or like chucks

1363
01:27:19.301 --> 01:27:22.120
and shit.
I just looked like a gangbanger.
I just looked like I was up to no good.

1364
01:27:22.121 --> 01:27:23.710
I will get no girls.
Then it's like fuck that.

1365
01:27:23.711 --> 01:27:27.060
I'm going to have to what I know and like this,

1366
01:27:27.070 --> 01:27:31.700
but does the look thing is that does 50 actually it'd be like,
look man,

1367
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:35.620
you ain't got the look.
He loved the music.
He loved a lot of my music.

1368
01:27:35.621 --> 01:27:38.140
But then like I say,
he told me to chill out.
Just you know,

1369
01:27:38.170 --> 01:27:41.200
you're gonna get your turn,
just,
you know.
But then eventually I was like,

1370
01:27:41.201 --> 01:27:44.220
fuck that shit.
I'm doing what I want to do.
End of the day.
I still,

1371
01:27:44.610 --> 01:27:46.310
I'm 37 years old.
Yeah I could,

1372
01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:49.780
I had to be like late twenties at that time I was already,

1373
01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:54.310
I was already battered and bruised at that time already touched,

1374
01:27:54.311 --> 01:27:57.900
he could press about none of the shit.
Right.

1375
01:27:58.730 --> 01:28:00.970
So he's so hilarious on Instagram.

1376
01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:04.420
Is Instagram actually who he is as a person.

1377
01:28:06.670 --> 01:28:07.780
That's actually how it used though.

1378
01:28:07.781 --> 01:28:11.050
So I remember we had a show and then I had these tight white pants and then he

1379
01:28:11.051 --> 01:28:13.360
just,
I don't know,
he just freaked out and was like,

1380
01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:15.190
you got this motherfucker around me.

1381
01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:20.200
Motherfuckers gonna think we gained [inaudible] about to get beat up man.

1382
01:28:27.170 --> 01:28:30.460
It got like that where if I was like fuck.
So then after that was over,

1383
01:28:30.461 --> 01:28:32.410
I knew in my head it was over like I got to go home.

1384
01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:36.280
So I think I lied to you and told him I had to show us up like yeah,

1385
01:28:36.281 --> 01:28:41.040
show in California,
which I did like at a fat beats for like $20 or some shit.

1386
01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:47.160
But it all worked out man.
It all worked out.
Yeah,
no,
the videos I,
we were just,

1387
01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:51.710
we were watching some videos like,
but yeah,
I guess the video thing,
um,

1388
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:55.260
because I remember,
I remember when I'm in a funny,
came out and like,
Joe didn't,

1389
01:28:55.261 --> 01:28:58.560
Jonah Hill's right.
It's such a,
like,
it's always shit like that.

1390
01:28:58.561 --> 01:29:00.420
That's pretty lucky for me and I'll take,
you know,

1391
01:29:00.421 --> 01:29:02.130
I'm really blessed stuff like that.
He just

1392
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:04.620
<v 10>really liked the song and reached out to do a video for it.
Sounds amazing.</v>

1393
01:29:04.621 --> 01:29:05.970
And he wanted to really,

1394
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.110
it was before he shot the movie that he just did it his way of like tests and

1395
01:29:10.111 --> 01:29:14.040
the cameras and like that was a way to practice before he started shooting the

1396
01:29:14.041 --> 01:29:17.550
movie.
It's a great,
it's a great view of what the songs really 19 thank you man.

1397
01:29:17.551 --> 01:29:20.480
Yeah.
Um,
is that,
do you go into songwriting?

1398
01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:25.320
Like it's your style to like think of,
you know,
do you just write down like a,

1399
01:29:25.321 --> 01:29:28.230
and like all this is a title or did you just like label whatever it comes out
of?

1400
01:29:28.231 --> 01:29:32.880
You mean for so long I went with the strategy of whatever kind of my head.

1401
01:29:32.881 --> 01:29:35.460
I write it down and type shit,
like how we're wrapping my head all the time.

1402
01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:37.910
So like,
I'm pretty sure like you guys think of a joke,
he's like,

1403
01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:40.650
when we go write it down like you and your fucking bit and you bought the

1404
01:29:40.651 --> 01:29:44.930
fucking calls always hallway in a punchline.
Pop up in my fucking head.
Yeah.

1405
01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:47.630
<v 7>Uh,
or the shower.
I've other ride on a fucking shower</v>

1406
01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:52.700
and I'll tell him,
I said,
if I'm remember it like fuck.
I mean you never will.

1407
01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:57.750
<v 10>So I did that for so long that I think I'm kind of like blessed to be able to</v>

1408
01:29:57.751 --> 01:30:00.780
just write punchlines and shit on the spot.
Yup.
Types it.

1409
01:30:00.781 --> 01:30:04.890
So did you hear that beat first?
The Aina funny beat is crazy.
See,

1410
01:30:04.891 --> 01:30:06.510
that's the thing.
My producer Paul White,

1411
01:30:06.570 --> 01:30:09.780
he sends me so many fucking beats that hour.

1412
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:13.560
I'm probably write a song right now if a beat that was me four years ago.

1413
01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:17.490
It's no telling how long I had that beat before I even started writing to it,

1414
01:30:17.491 --> 01:30:21.540
which is a good thing because you get so many ideas to listen to a piece of

1415
01:30:21.541 --> 01:30:25.860
music for so long and then a lot of times I have so many beats from a mill stuff

1416
01:30:25.861 --> 01:30:26.790
I just put beets on.

1417
01:30:26.791 --> 01:30:31.140
I listened to him and I will let stuff just happen on his own more so than be

1418
01:30:31.141 --> 01:30:32.700
like,
I'm going to sit here and write a rap.
I'm like,

1419
01:30:32.701 --> 01:30:35.010
I'm a write her song or yeah,
we'll come up with this concept.
No,

1420
01:30:35.011 --> 01:30:38.020
I would just be like put beats on and every now and then I might have a couple

1421
01:30:38.021 --> 01:30:40.210
of bars for this beat.
I might come up with a hook for this,

1422
01:30:40.211 --> 01:30:44.500
but I might come up and eventually it just starts painting it's own picture for

1423
01:30:44.501 --> 01:30:47.970
yourself.
I don't really go into the try to force it no more.
However,

1424
01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:49.240
I just wanted to ask about like this.

1425
01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:51.570
They'll give us such a distinct performing voice.

1426
01:30:51.930 --> 01:30:55.830
Did you always perform with that,
like,
you know,
no.

1427
01:30:55.831 --> 01:30:59.050
It took a long time for me to actually find a boys to find that voice.
Yeah.

1428
01:30:59.430 --> 01:31:02.460
I probably do like three mix tapes before I even started rapping like that.

1429
01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:04.770
Really?
Yeah.
I think Adderall,

1430
01:31:08.490 --> 01:31:09.400
<v 7>you get a lot of credit.</v>

1431
01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:13.670
I really like the beginning stages of Adderall and he'd be like,
fuck.

1432
01:31:13.671 --> 01:31:17.360
I feel like a super human.
Like I'm really like,
like I can see farther.

1433
01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:18.440
I can hear her laugh.

1434
01:31:18.690 --> 01:31:21.770
Like I really thought like I would really bought into the whole thing of like

1435
01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:25.580
I'm a better person with type shit.
Yeah.
It makes me work better.

1436
01:31:25.581 --> 01:31:28.230
It's big like that,
but he has,
it's a downfall to that.

1437
01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:31.460
Children don't get me wrong,
it makes you a fucking cycle

1438
01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:38.270
a lot.
I like bipolar patients because Adderall.
Oh really?
Yeah.

1439
01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:39.333
You just have these like

1440
01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:41.560
<v 10>mood swing when you take it for so long.
Yeah.</v>

1441
01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:43.200
You had these crazy like mood swings,

1442
01:31:43.201 --> 01:31:46.410
which I can't really like is like you'd be like,
something's fucked up,

1443
01:31:46.411 --> 01:31:49.350
but you know what I'm saying?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
No,
I've never done it.

1444
01:31:49.351 --> 01:31:50.184
You do every day?

1445
01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:55.510
<v 7>No,
I uh,
no,
no.
I liked downers.
I like,</v>

1446
01:31:55.511 --> 01:32:00.010
I don't like me.
I like downers.
Like I want to do Xanax hot.
That brings me

1447
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:00.843
<v 8>down</v>

1448
01:32:01.730 --> 01:32:04.580
<v 2>Downer soon
after uppers.</v>

1449
01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:06.073
<v 7>Great.</v>

1450
01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:10.620
<v 2>That's a real party man right there.
If you're like yeah,
after the other shit.</v>

1451
01:32:10.690 --> 01:32:14.780
Yeah.
Um,
all right,
so there's,
this guy was trying to give you a heads up yet.

1452
01:32:15.150 --> 01:32:16.170
This guy is,

1453
01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:20.640
I mean he's too cool for the cool guy club so we have to put them in his own

1454
01:32:20.641 --> 01:32:21.474
club.

1455
01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:27.180
He's his own cloud light just to give you like a little like test or what we do.

1456
01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:29.540
<v 7>Oh
God.</v>

1457
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:35.380
<v 2>So this is hard rock nick and um,
smoked like a magician.</v>

1458
01:32:35.770 --> 01:32:40.630
<v 7>Yes.
I just know he know some magic trick</v>

1459
01:32:42.530 --> 01:32:47.400
or we were thinking,
Geez,
this mother fucker though.

1460
01:32:53.050 --> 01:32:54.300
Just the photo day.

1461
01:32:54.890 --> 01:32:59.330
<v 8>Do some shit.
Something's going to disappear in a second.
It's been a while,</v>

1462
01:32:59.331 --> 01:33:00.164
hasn't it?
Alright.

1463
01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:05.780
I decided to make a video since I'm stuck on the four oh five on my way to Santa

1464
01:33:07.730 --> 01:33:11.720
Monica.
I think the topic of this video will be something a little more personal.

1465
01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:14.210
Let's talk about why bad ass.

1466
01:33:14.211 --> 01:33:17.750
Good looking rich guys don't have girlfriends like me.

1467
01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:22.670
Why is it that girls will date a guy that has half of my wallet?

1468
01:33:22.671 --> 01:33:26.300
Half my Dick,
half my car,
half my bank,

1469
01:33:26.630 --> 01:33:31.190
half my personality,
half my looks half my wardrobe,

1470
01:33:31.610 --> 01:33:34.460
half my sexual prowess.

1471
01:33:34.610 --> 01:33:39.280
But they'll pass up a guy like me who's Fon.

1472
01:33:39.290 --> 01:33:43.880
Good looking,
interesting,
edgy,
educated.

1473
01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:45.990
<v 7>And once again I'll ask you to do</v>

1474
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:52.860
eyelashes and eyebrows.
Yeah,
he's a bad bitch right here.

1475
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:59.180
He's just a bad,
bad,
bad,
bad.

1476
01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:04.320
Oh,
got jewelry.

1477
01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:05.740
I love the hearing

1478
01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:11.150
<v 8>is a Babin.
Let's talk about that.
As you get older,
you understand,</v>

1479
01:34:11.151 --> 01:34:12.470
it's actually a compliment.

1480
01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:17.300
Why a guy like me is single and then I looked around and guys that have big ass

1481
01:34:17.301 --> 01:34:21.910
bellies or you know by all their shoes at Kmart,

1482
01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:25.490
girlfriends.
So why don't we have no friends or why don't I

1483
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:28.110
<v 7>what I'm saying,
man,
this is,
this is,</v>

1484
01:34:29.150 --> 01:34:30.860
I bet you this motherfucker know how to fight to

1485
01:34:33.730 --> 01:34:38.600
fucking jail.
Sit next to that.
Make me never commit crimes again.

1486
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:42.570
You run into in the county jail and shit like that.
Yeah.

1487
01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:45.850
Talking all kinds of crazy talking about bitches and shit,
motherfucker.

1488
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.250
I know you're a bad bitch.
I know you ain't.
Come on man.

1489
01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:53.510
<v 8>If you look too good and you got it going on,</v>

1490
01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:56.630
women are mother fuck in Hayden.

1491
01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:02.640
They all like to see you ball.
They don't like to see you ball.

1492
01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:07.940
They don't like to see you succeed.
They don't like you looking better than that.

1493
01:35:08.090 --> 01:35:13.090
They don't want you being desirable because that's gonna make them vulnerable to

1494
01:35:15.441 --> 01:35:17.270
you leaving their bitch ass.

1495
01:35:17.930 --> 01:35:21.980
<v 4>I would think he has a fucking room.
One of those who cock ring.</v>

1496
01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:27.500
<v 7>Yeah,
I would.
You are</v>

1497
01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:35.173
my biggest period,

1498
01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:40.840
but I can fight and I could do magic too because he was a bad bitch.

1499
01:35:43.570 --> 01:35:45.960
Yeah,
just old code following.

1500
01:35:46.370 --> 01:35:51.370
Absolutely book and I bet you can belly dance like do that shit.

1501
01:35:53.310 --> 01:35:53.981
<v 4>No.
What though?</v>

1502
01:35:53.981 --> 01:35:57.370
You've got a point here because he's got that appeal that prince had.

1503
01:35:57.371 --> 01:36:02.020
Let's be honest,
when you break it down,
it was a small motherfucker.
He was short.

1504
01:36:02.021 --> 01:36:04.540
He wore heels and it was a bad on that weird,

1505
01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:09.070
weird beard shit to write weird fucking beards.
They just loved him.

1506
01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:14.010
Loved him.
Yup.
I mean and they probably have the same net worth.
Yes.
Easily.
Yeah,

1507
01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:15.700
I know cause he just to,

1508
01:36:15.730 --> 01:36:18.610
he too much of the bad bitch like bitch don't want to be around.
That's right.

1509
01:36:18.670 --> 01:36:21.680
Another bad day.
How much time?
I hear it in the,

1510
01:36:21.690 --> 01:36:24.550
how much do you think this guy's worth?
Just eyeballing the jewelry.

1511
01:36:24.551 --> 01:36:27.640
The like look at his style.
What would you guess?

1512
01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:31.630
I don't think he worked at like office depot or some shit.

1513
01:36:34.090 --> 01:36:37.600
Well guess again,
he is worth $350 million.

1514
01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:39.273
That's what he says.

1515
01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:41.050
<v 7>Not with that Polo shirt.</v>

1516
01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:46.030
Like I don't think this is a real polo polo shirt,

1517
01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:48.580
but this what might be fake.

1518
01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:52.300
<v 4>That's a big pole.
You're right.
That's a big fucking Colorado motherfucker.</v>

1519
01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:56.850
He definitely went through this shirt a few times.
Yes,
you're right.

1520
01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:01.530
You could add a bar fight and as we hang up a good point.

1521
01:37:01.531 --> 01:37:05.300
This logo,
the Polo logo,
this is about,
I've been times normally small,

1522
01:37:05.790 --> 01:37:07.240
big ones like that.
They do.

1523
01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:11.370
Oh motherfuck the horse and the men are like morphing into one thing,

1524
01:37:11.550 --> 01:37:15.930
<v 7>right?
Well,
no separation between horse and man.</v>

1525
01:37:16.350 --> 01:37:17.183
Don't forget that.

1526
01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:21.600
<v 4>Would you like nick probably has access to stuff that they don't release it.
Oh,</v>

1527
01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:26.750
I'm sorry.
You're right.
It's probably like a special pickup truck.
Yes.

1528
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:28.590
I mean that's one of his,
he has like

1529
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.310
<v 7>bid slash scary mother fucker all in one.
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?</v>

1530
01:37:34.450 --> 01:37:38.560
<v 4>He goes to Gold's gym to got six houses,
12 cars.</v>

1531
01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:41.170
He just got personal chef.
He goes smack his lips.

1532
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:46.250
<v 7>I ain't got a job,
but no man doing all this deal.</v>

1533
01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:49.780
What would on my hands like?
Well,
so yeah,
we haven't,
we haven't

1534
01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:50.451
<v 4>watched this one.
Yeah.</v>

1535
01:37:50.451 --> 01:37:53.340
Why don't you go ahead and show us this video with just one shot.

1536
01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:56.100
I get this question a,
okay.
Okay.

1537
01:37:56.970 --> 01:38:00.270
<v 12>What do I wear?
Pink.
Okay,
so much.</v>

1538
01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:04.860
I wear pink because I like pink pussies.
Oh,
you know,

1539
01:38:04.861 --> 01:38:09.510
like inside.
I like to actually spread the Pussy Lips.

1540
01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:12.750
All Ben while I'm cocking missionary.
Yeah,
that.

1541
01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:18.500
And the other reason I like pink or wear pink is because if you look at all the

1542
01:38:18.571 --> 01:38:22.170
richest men in the world,
which I'm one of,
I have 20 million in the bank.

1543
01:38:22.171 --> 01:38:26.650
No bullshit.
Suck on my fucking testes.
Um,

1544
01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:31.560
all the richest men in the world where paint.
Yeah.

True.
True.

1545
01:38:31.650 --> 01:38:36.000
Wears pink.
Tom Cruise.
Where's pain?
All right,
Simon.

1546
01:38:36.001 --> 01:38:39.350
Rex fucking where?
St Contracts.

1547
01:38:39.930 --> 01:38:44.250
So that's what it is,
man.
20 million in the bank and fucking growing.

1548
01:38:44.610 --> 01:38:47.600
I hate over it.
Um,
you don't need to hear it when you're this good looking baby.

1549
01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:53.020
<v 7>Yeah.
There you go.
Now to be on his bad bits team,
but Nah,</v>

1550
01:38:53.021 --> 01:38:55.650
hell no.
I come because I know this is a mother fucker.

1551
01:38:55.651 --> 01:38:58.650
You don't want to run into on the streets,
but part to the story.

1552
01:38:58.651 --> 01:39:00.130
What does motherfucking like five.
Oh

1553
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:06.850
yeah.
Do you think you bring up his,
uh,

1554
01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:11.090
<v 4>bio,
his bio that he wrote because it kind of will inform it,</v>

1555
01:39:11.091 --> 01:39:14.440
but he liked over six feet.
I'm terrified.
Yeah.
Now hold on.

1556
01:39:14.441 --> 01:39:18.960
He said he's worth 20 million,
but before he said 75 million didn't.
Oh my God.

1557
01:39:18.961 --> 01:39:23.680
They cleared there.
Uh,
you just had it,
the sheet.
Oh yeah,
there he is.

1558
01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:28.600
He wrote his own bio.
So born in Vegas,
grew up in men wholesale.

1559
01:39:28.630 --> 01:39:30.910
How are you though?
And he grabbed him.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1560
01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:32.470
It's kind of hard to see that one.

1561
01:39:32.471 --> 01:39:34.330
I mean he has some selfies we might be able to see,
but see,

1562
01:39:34.331 --> 01:39:38.380
look worth a good 350 million,
three 59 account in the house I live in.

1563
01:39:38.530 --> 01:39:42.520
I prefer eating pussy from the back almost 300 pounds,
Danny.

1564
01:39:42.610 --> 01:39:45.460
But I carry it like I'm to 10 all right.
Damn.

1565
01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:49.960
But he also shops at Bristol Farms Gelson's or whole foods market.
You can,

1566
01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:53.560
you should consider rewriting your bio and everyone in the poor business that he

1567
01:39:53.561 --> 01:39:54.180
wanted to.

1568
01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:55.940
<v 7>Yup,
that's right.</v>

1569
01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:04.340
Yeah.
That is the resume.
The resume right there is in Brentwood too.

1570
01:40:04.341 --> 01:40:08.020
He puts the location.
I tried to be on the same man,

1571
01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:12.800
but the more and more I look at his ass when I left eyebrow Combo may want to

1572
01:40:12.801 --> 01:40:15.360
put the shit out of him,
but I don't think I can take them.
Say,

1573
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:16.640
I don't think I can take

1574
01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:21.430
<v 4>you don't want none man.
Definitely don't.
Oh No,

I hate him.</v>

1575
01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:23.350
I rock nick man.
Well that's probably,

1576
01:40:23.351 --> 01:40:25.780
that's about it was taking one of his six houses.
Yeah.

1577
01:40:26.230 --> 01:40:29.020
So you're saying if you were in jail at this guy.
Oh Man,

1578
01:40:29.021 --> 01:40:31.110
I should keep my mouth closed.
Keep it shut.
Yeah.

1579
01:40:31.150 --> 01:40:34.180
<v 7>Yeah.
Cause you don't know what he's capable of.
No.</v>

1580
01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:37.580
You know what he capable of being in this motherfucker.
I know he did some shit.

1581
01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:42.890
You to put in some work.

1582
01:40:45.290 --> 01:40:46.123
No prob.

1583
01:40:46.690 --> 01:40:49.960
<v 4>Oh my God.
That is,
oh go check it out.</v>

1584
01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:54.160
You see that like Cuban link chain on the outside?
I want so 40th is coming up

1585
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:55.420

1586
01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:58.360
Will you please tell my wife that I should get one of those for my 40th?

1587
01:40:58.510 --> 01:40:59.343
It's not an ethical

1588
01:41:00.350 --> 01:41:04.340
<v 7>did not yet.
How to not get a chance.</v>

1589
01:41:05.930 --> 01:41:08.650
<v 11>No,
you don't.
You don't need it.
Stop it.
Yeah.</v>

1590
01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:13.120
I'm no team like I don't have jewelry.
I'm not dead.
I have um,

1591
01:41:13.150 --> 01:41:16.160
you have France.
I did until I got my teeth fixed.

1592
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:21.500
Amazing teeth look great.
Amazing.
I'm now,
what did you do?

1593
01:41:21.710 --> 01:41:26.090
30 $30,000 in a year off work.

1594
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:29.360
Wait,
but uh,
it looks great.
What happened to the front?
Oh,

1595
01:41:29.361 --> 01:41:31.790
I can't fit 'em no more.
Really?
Yeah.
So I've got,

1596
01:41:31.791 --> 01:41:35.540
I'm either going to take the diamonds out and do something else with them or I

1597
01:41:35.541 --> 01:41:36.770
don't know how much we're front.

1598
01:41:36.771 --> 01:41:41.771
Can you tell us that I spent 10,000 on one and it's been maybe 7,500 on another

1599
01:41:43.911 --> 01:41:46.190
one.
So you're looking at about a hundred grand in your mouth.

1600
01:41:46.191 --> 01:41:49.580
Was it then I had another one that's been like 15000.0 shit.
Yeah.

1601
01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:53.750
My last one I spent the most of.
So should I get those you think?
Yeah,
my 40th.

1602
01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:57.330
Yeah,
but so you what having with me,
you know,
trying to be so cool an excel,

1603
01:41:57.380 --> 01:42:00.650
my teeth was already fucked up anyway,
but me wearing the grills,

1604
01:42:00.651 --> 01:42:01.490
it accelerated it.

1605
01:42:01.491 --> 01:42:06.140
And what it was was me wearing the grills on like flights and shit and I will

1606
01:42:06.141 --> 01:42:10.610
fall asleep in the saliva would just give,
you know,
get caught up in there.

1607
01:42:10.611 --> 01:42:13.010
And I saying that's pretty much like acid for your feet.
Oh,

1608
01:42:13.610 --> 01:42:17.390
I was really like a few steps away from dentures.
Really.
My Shit was,

1609
01:42:17.391 --> 01:42:19.640
I had to get bone graft and audit.
No Way.

1610
01:42:19.730 --> 01:42:22.790
That's why I had to take so much time off really to get all of that fixed.

1611
01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:25.180
I did not know that.
Yeah.
So this,

1612
01:42:25.610 --> 01:42:29.840
that's actually a better case for buying the chain,
I guess.

1613
01:42:30.170 --> 01:42:33.290
But people see you with me.
I'm from the hood.

1614
01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:35.480
So cannibis snatch a grill.

1615
01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:40.730
I know was robbing you fucking a fucking,
that's just disgusting.
Yeah,
that's,

1616
01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:43.870
you want me to pull my shit out of my mouth like this shit.
Like

1617
01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:48.880
Shane will get snapped Nash that well,
what I understand like,
all right,

1618
01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:52.480
why don't we set a like a sailing,
a price limit to that.

1619
01:42:52.481 --> 01:42:56.390
What's a reasonable amount I should spend on his chain for his 40th birthday?

1620
01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:02.360
I mean,
what I know for a good chain.
And you want a piece too.
I know.

1621
01:43:02.361 --> 01:43:04.670
I just do the chest,
the chain and just to change

1622
01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:09.890
at least by his 40th birthday.
So let's go special.
Safe.

1623
01:43:11.570 --> 01:43:14.180
Feel Cuban link to,
they're expensive and you want something heavy.

1624
01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:17.090
You don't want no hollow as bullish.
That's right.

1625
01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:19.970
He's got like 15 k,

1626
01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:24.400
<v 7>15 years when we got to get a new sponsor,
you know?</v>

1627
01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:32.130
<v 11>Good.
Good up for like five,
5,000 yeah.
Okay.
Calluses.</v>

1628
01:43:32.230 --> 01:43:37.160
Listen,
I'm moon.
I would say,
um,
I wouldn't say it all on my Eric.

1629
01:43:37.190 --> 01:43:40.570
Okay.
But often.
All right.
All right.
I ain't got it.
They got it.

1630
01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:41.820
They got show me some love.

1631
01:43:43.570 --> 01:43:44.403
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1632
01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:48.290
<v 11>All right,
well that's okay.
Fine for a shitty man.</v>

1633
01:43:48.291 --> 01:43:50.330
I swear they treat you like shit.
Well,
you know what?

1634
01:43:50.331 --> 01:43:54.470
The big thing about that fucks with everybody is that unless you're really in

1635
01:43:54.471 --> 01:43:57.470
the know,
you can get hustled so easily.
What will you tell him

1636
01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:06.230
now?
I know it's like
I never really got ripped off because I'm just so,

1637
01:44:06.290 --> 01:44:09.710
so cheap and some sense that I'm going to check this shit soon as I buy it from

1638
01:44:09.711 --> 01:44:11.550
you and if it's fucked up,
I'm coming to highlight you.

1639
01:44:13.250 --> 01:44:17.420
Every time I bought jewelry,
I'm pretty much went about it the sensible way,

1640
01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:20.510
which is the dominant way,
to be honest.
It's going to and be like,
look,

1641
01:44:20.511 --> 01:44:23.690
that's how much I got.
What are you going to do?
Fine.
It never let her,

1642
01:44:23.691 --> 01:44:26.000
cause then they always go,
oh that's right.

1643
01:44:26.690 --> 01:44:30.130
You never going to get what you really pay for it.
Not saying that's right.
Yeah.

1644
01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:33.080
Jewelry's just,
I dunno,
but if you don't do that,

1645
01:44:33.081 --> 01:44:34.220
it's almost like they're going to,

1646
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:38.000
you can come to that motherfucker with the intention of spending a couple of

1647
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.180
dollars and next thing you know you're like fuck you get your receipt.
Like fuck,

1648
01:44:40.190 --> 01:44:44.590
I just spent 20,000 [inaudible] yeah.

1649
01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:47.150
Well it's also like,
you know,
you,

1650
01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:50.630
you start looking at stuff and there's no mystery to it.

1651
01:44:50.690 --> 01:44:52.880
People just show you the baddest shit and people would be like,

1652
01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:54.770
that's what I really want.
They're like,
oh,

1653
01:44:54.771 --> 01:44:57.170
that's this month and then start telling you deals and shit.

1654
01:44:57.171 --> 01:44:59.190
Like it's really 50,000.
I'm gonna give it to you for that answer.

1655
01:44:59.191 --> 01:45:01.540
She really had an idea.
You're taking me out,
you know?

1656
01:45:01.541 --> 01:45:05.150
[inaudible]

1657
01:45:05.150 --> 01:45:07.950
you think you getting over type Shit,
you know,
mother fuckers.
Got You.

1658
01:45:07.951 --> 01:45:12.230
So it's a dirty game and jewelry.
I just don't,
you know,
you don't have to do,

1659
01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:15.980
I'm a hit up nick.
I'm no,
I'm asking.
That's nick

1660
01:45:18.350 --> 01:45:22.580
watches.
Like just wear like vintage watches.

1661
01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:26.930
That's cool.
This is my new,
I got a Domino's pizza Rolex.

1662
01:45:29.890 --> 01:45:33.990
You know people that have like a lipstick tickets,
people Domino's pizza,

1663
01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:37.560
Domino's pizza and you sell enough pizzas in the year.

1664
01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:41.290
The owner of dominoes get you a Rolex.
Somebody just,

1665
01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:45.980
you know some [inaudible].

1666
01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:47.573
Wow.

1667
01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:52.100
There's really a Domino's pizza.

1668
01:45:53.970 --> 01:45:58.270
That's awesome.
But you can't resell it because

1669
01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:07.660
every restaurant like Arby's is the most expensive one.

1670
01:46:07.930 --> 01:46:10.970
If you can find the Arby's Arby's cheaper than 50,000

1671
01:46:12.990 --> 01:46:16.810
like the resale value on numerous crazy 50 grand.

1672
01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:21.410
But here's what I actually from the nineties
Domino's pizza,

1673
01:46:21.411 --> 01:46:23.270
somebody sold a fuck load of pizzas.

1674
01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:29.420
They just gave it away to the trophy like that too.
My dumb ass

1675
01:46:32.110 --> 01:46:35.690
children,
I got so many dumb watches.
It don't make no sense.

1676
01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:38.190
Can inherit another one.
I love this.

1677
01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:43.340
I got on like the 90 Rolexes Lexus like biggie and Tupac would word and shit

1678
01:46:43.341 --> 01:46:44.390
like that.
Yeah.
That's cool.

1679
01:46:44.410 --> 01:46:48.320
Then I have like the Rolex Jay z rapped about on imaginary player with the real

1680
01:46:48.321 --> 01:46:51.280
Rolex diamonds and shit.
Like you got some nice watch and again,

1681
01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:53.250
like the old nineties Jacobs and stuff,

1682
01:46:53.251 --> 01:46:55.230
the early 2000 [inaudible] Jacob watches and stuff.

1683
01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:59.150
You have a car collector and that's it.
Uh,
what's like the,
alright,

1684
01:46:59.250 --> 01:47:02.430
cause what's the dumbest Shit you've bought?
Oh,

1685
01:47:02.431 --> 01:47:07.180
I have a lot of that shit close.
Really close was to like,
uh,
uh,

1686
01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:11.070
which I've stopped like I guess at this so long I'm just collecting shit and

1687
01:47:11.071 --> 01:47:14.580
buying stuff.
But I bought,
um,
so many dumb,

1688
01:47:14.581 --> 01:47:18.810
like one time I was in London as Selfridge and I bought this dumb ass,

1689
01:47:18.811 --> 01:47:22.300
like a Rick Owens,
like sleeping back Kate type of thing.

1690
01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:27.240
I can't even explain what it is.
It's a picture of it somewhere.
And um,

1691
01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:31.100
it's just a cake.
It looks like a sleeping bag with a stream.

1692
01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:34.470
The stream around your neck and it just grapes over you.

1693
01:47:34.471 --> 01:47:36.700
How much it was like $3,000

1694
01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:44.070
did motherfucker in my closet looking stupid.

1695
01:47:44.610 --> 01:47:45.960
What the fuck?
So yeah,

1696
01:47:45.961 --> 01:47:49.140
I don't like buying expensive clothes is definitely the dummies.

1697
01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:51.360
I think clubs is kind of even crazier in a way.

1698
01:47:51.361 --> 01:47:54.540
Cause I bought some expensive clothes.
Donald's money,

1699
01:47:54.541 --> 01:47:56.880
you went a little crazy and you had to return some of the,

1700
01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:01.980
it's almost crazier than jewelry in a way cause close,
close.

1701
01:48:01.981 --> 01:48:05.170
You get like a few whatever wearing.

1702
01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:08.690
If it's a picture on Instagram and it

1703
01:48:13.230 --> 01:48:16.340
can be timeless,
like a good jacket.
That's true.
Jack

1704
01:48:21.180 --> 01:48:24.290
definitely wasted a lot of money on high end,
like high as

1705
01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:29.730
I could find a picture of it.
I'll show you what he's making.
By the way.

1706
01:48:29.731 --> 01:48:33.570
There's this whole thing going on now about like some of the high end fashion

1707
01:48:33.571 --> 01:48:36.220
lines being accused of like blackface stuff.

1708
01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:39.930
Braces at Montclair this week

1709
01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:43.800
been like that man at the end of the day.
Have they been,

1710
01:48:43.801 --> 01:48:45.600
have they been doing stuff like that a long time?
I don't know.

1711
01:48:45.601 --> 01:48:49.020
I'm just not even familiar.
I just saw the stories.
I know debt in fashion world,

1712
01:48:49.021 --> 01:48:53.310
a lot of a lot of brands field at once.
It's popping in like urban communities.

1713
01:48:53.311 --> 01:48:57.810
That's the decline that they line so I can see what Gucci to me,

1714
01:48:57.811 --> 01:49:02.580
I think it was a planned situation after they did the dapper Dan thing.

1715
01:49:02.581 --> 01:49:06.960
They did the most Nigga shit they can do and they did some Nigga Shit,

1716
01:49:06.961 --> 01:49:11.470
you're going to just attack.
They already got the money from.

1717
01:49:11.490 --> 01:49:16.320
It's like Gucci has been revived so many times like it pops it then they fall

1718
01:49:16.321 --> 01:49:17.040
off in the project.

1719
01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:20.610
This was a way of saying y'all Nigga stop buying this shit right now so we can

1720
01:49:21.090 --> 01:49:23.490
get back to being,
you know,
cool.
And our audience,

1721
01:49:23.860 --> 01:49:25.380
because right now it's like an urban brand.

1722
01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:30.150
So you think though there is like some like almost conspiracy in a way.
Right?

1723
01:49:31.210 --> 01:49:33.870
I think that was,
I think that was purpose.
They did that.
I'm pretty,

1724
01:49:33.871 --> 01:49:35.970
I don't want black people to wear the clothes right now.
No Shit.

1725
01:49:36.110 --> 01:49:38.840
They had a nice five year run with us and now they're like hotel,

1726
01:49:38.850 --> 01:49:43.080
let us get back to being high in and then when we need y'all motherfuckers
again,

1727
01:49:43.081 --> 01:49:46.320
we will make some fucking all over print shit logos on it.

1728
01:49:48.490 --> 01:49:49.690
No fucking way.

1729
01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:53.620
Like the one thing that gets me out as like when you see these stories and

1730
01:49:53.621 --> 01:49:58.140
there'll be images,
uh,
with like something resembling,
you know,

1731
01:49:58.230 --> 01:50:03.220
black face,
there's no way,
but when they're like,
oh,
we just made that,

1732
01:50:03.550 --> 01:50:04.690
we're even thinking like that.
Like,

1733
01:50:04.691 --> 01:50:09.691
because a fashion house like that to approve of something I

1734
01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:18.910
really wanted,
that was the whole way of like,
chill out.
Y'All got Gucci Cause uh,

1735
01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:21.260
uh,
tip found the,
I guess he,

1736
01:50:21.450 --> 01:50:26.250
it was an older Montclair jacket and you're like,
is this real?
And it,

1737
01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:29.770
it definitely didn't know about this job.
And I know the Gucci,
it was a sweater,

1738
01:50:29.771 --> 01:50:34.200
right?
I'm going to,
Montclair really had like real,
like blackface,

1739
01:50:34.330 --> 01:50:38.050
but it was actually a designer in the 90s that was a black designer from Paris.

1740
01:50:38.051 --> 01:50:40.840
I can't think of his name right now,
but he actually used to do that too though.

1741
01:50:40.841 --> 01:50:42.280
So I in some sense,

1742
01:50:42.281 --> 01:50:46.810
I thought they was trying to like do a take on what he used to do in some sense,

1743
01:50:46.811 --> 01:50:49.360
but I don't know.
That's so crazy.

1744
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:52.690
I mean Claire Jacket,

1745
01:50:53.730 --> 01:50:57.010
but then you guys can't see it,
but then swipe.

1746
01:51:00.630 --> 01:51:03.670
Yeah,
this is bad.
What is that?
And they're like,

1747
01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:09.070
it's just a do slides.
Literally.
That's what I feel like.
That's just,

1748
01:51:09.610 --> 01:51:13.030
that's his campaign.
Quite literally his pattern,

1749
01:51:14.020 --> 01:51:16.330
he says show the camera,
then they'll bring it up.

1750
01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:20.200
And then the jacket is the,
is this black?

1751
01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:24.910
It's like old timey Sutter and it looks like it looks like a minstrel shows,

1752
01:51:25.450 --> 01:51:30.280
minstrel show stuff that's so that it's very you to walk around and be like,

1753
01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:31.240
oh,
it's just my,

1754
01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:36.370
I'm a big fan of like early 19 hundreds night racist movies.

1755
01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:39.470
Yeah.
It's my favorite thing.
Yeah.

1756
01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:42.660
But and stuff and stuff like that don't really age will either.

1757
01:51:42.710 --> 01:51:45.970
So like motherfuckers [inaudible] it's just like,
it's so trendy for now.

1758
01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:49.360
You can't wear that jacket in five years.
You look stupid.
No,
of course not.

1759
01:51:49.530 --> 01:51:53.050
Where are you gonna wear that jacket right now?
So that's my thing.

1760
01:51:53.080 --> 01:51:56.560
I tried to now buy clothes with the,

1761
01:51:57.460 --> 01:52:00.450
with the thought of timelessness almost.
Yeah.

1762
01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:05.410
Yeah.
Now Shit from Amazon.

1763
01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:10.270
Like I used to high end shit.

1764
01:52:10.271 --> 01:52:14.260
I would like go to Bergdorf's and you know self rich or really is all about

1765
01:52:14.261 --> 01:52:18.100

What about it?

1771
01:52:40.470 --> 01:52:45.470
Well we've been watching that show love hate Hayden cards.

1772
01:52:46.670 --> 01:52:50.870
<v 7>Did you ever get on an inmate dating site?
Oh Man,</v>

1773
01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:52.340
I was in a dating site.

1774
01:52:56.330 --> 01:52:58.070
Tell us everything you're dying to know.

1775
01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:04.520
<v 10>A lucky motherfucker to get the opportunity to work registry and registry in</v>

1776
01:53:04.521 --> 01:53:07.640
jail is like the best job you could possibly get.
What is it?

1777
01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:11.210
Registry is when people come in to get registered because only two people could

1778
01:53:11.211 --> 01:53:15.830
work the job.
So I got lucky.
I ended up getting a job through some rap shit too.

1779
01:53:15.831 --> 01:53:18.980
That's just a long story,
whatever really.
But I got the job working registry.

1780
01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:22.010
And what that means is when people come in to get registered,
you just,

1781
01:53:22.011 --> 01:53:24.830
the person down there helping the police,
you know,
if they tell you,

1782
01:53:25.190 --> 01:53:27.160
give them some Greens,
go get him something,
you know,

1783
01:53:27.190 --> 01:53:29.960
so that the kind of mother fucker that passed off to sandwiches and shit,

1784
01:53:30.050 --> 01:53:32.750
that police have to obviously be like this is a somebody who's not a problem.

1785
01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:36.110
So yeah.
So like any other inmate,
you know,

1786
01:53:36.111 --> 01:53:39.230
I would get letters from girls or whatever on the outside and stuff,

1787
01:53:39.231 --> 01:53:41.540
but it got to when I was like fuck this shit.

1788
01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:42.613
<v 7>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1789
01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:47.320
And what I would do is I would pass up the sale just to the female inmates to,

1790
01:53:47.710 --> 01:53:50.860
so I see one come in,
you can see are broken and battered.

1791
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:53.590
You don't know what she going through.
You know what I'm saying?

1792
01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:58.660
Get the inmate number.

1793
01:53:58.661 --> 01:54:02.140
I will look on a slip and I would get the inmate number and then I'll write them

1794
01:54:02.141 --> 01:54:04.750
like,
yeah,
I was the guy passed you sandwiches.
You know what I'm saying?

1795
01:54:04.751 --> 01:54:06.640
I see your case.
I know what you're going through baby.

1796
01:54:07.830 --> 01:54:12.070
After like six months of this,
I was never getting mail on the outside.

1797
01:54:12.071 --> 01:54:15.880
I was only getting mail from other perfect,

1798
01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:20.530
a little freaky shit like shit.
I know her court date.

1799
01:54:20.531 --> 01:54:22.720
She come down and show me your titties or something through the bar.

1800
01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:25.430
I'd be going back to my steel like the best day of my life.

1801
01:54:26.350 --> 01:54:29.410
I don't know what the fuck is going on right now.
You know what I'm saying?

1802
01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:31.210
But a titty flash when you're

1803
01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:36.970
like fuck I'm watching girlfriends and shit everyday get horny up.
That shit.

1804
01:54:36.971 --> 01:54:40.160
That was like the real deal.
Like

1805
01:54:43.570 --> 01:54:48.570
I stopped [inaudible] go straight.

1806
01:54:49.050 --> 01:54:53.460
That is you would find out when her court date was.

1807
01:54:54.660 --> 01:54:55.570
You get to see her though.

1808
01:54:56.530 --> 01:55:00.940
She know when she coming down or you might get lost in to register it.

1809
01:55:01.370 --> 01:55:04.840
<v 10>Come on.
You got to go down to the register area to go to court.</v>

1810
01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:07.060
Most of the people in the county jail,
the people fighting cases,

1811
01:55:07.090 --> 01:55:08.530
they ain't really got the time yet.

1812
01:55:08.531 --> 01:55:13.390
So they do to go through the process basically held before you go on and let you

1813
01:55:13.450 --> 01:55:15.070
already got time and you're doing time there.

1814
01:55:15.071 --> 01:55:18.520
You can't do more than a year in the county jail so.
So yeah,

1815
01:55:18.521 --> 01:55:21.970
a couple of girls got time where they was in the county then you wouldn't see

1816
01:55:21.971 --> 01:55:23.290
them no more because they are not coming back down.

1817
01:55:23.700 --> 01:55:25.930
But we'll be writing each other a little freaky letters and shit.

1818
01:55:27.260 --> 01:55:32.220
<v 7>It was a terrifying or was it like manageable?
Of course it's terrifying.</v>

1819
01:55:33.150 --> 01:55:36.000
But once you get to jail and once you get used to this shit and I ain't gonna

1820
01:55:36.001 --> 01:55:38.200
lie man,
it's price.
Some of the funniest guy

1821
01:55:40.970 --> 01:55:44.100
you meet the funniest motherfuckers in the world.
The jail.
Hate to say it man.

1822
01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:46.200
Yeah it's been a good big

1823
01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:51.210
<v 10>job with my personality.
I can't take it.
I can't,</v>

1824
01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:53.460
I can't think the world would that experience.
You know what I'm saying?

1825
01:55:53.910 --> 01:55:56.610
What's the best part?
What did you like most about jail?

1826
01:55:56.940 --> 01:56:01.080
I ain't saying I liked anything about jail cause I would never want to go back.

1827
01:56:01.140 --> 01:56:03.570
Right.
But um,
it just was fun.

1828
01:56:03.571 --> 01:56:08.370
Motherfuck cause you gotta think at the end of the day you a grown as man but

1829
01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:12.300
you get in reduced back to a child level cause the motherfucking telling you

1830
01:56:12.301 --> 01:56:14.010
witness lead motherfucker tell him when to eat.

1831
01:56:14.011 --> 01:56:15.960
So all you do is act like a kid at that time.

1832
01:56:15.961 --> 01:56:18.720
You put it around acting like just silly as fuck.

1833
01:56:18.721 --> 01:56:20.610
Cause no like you're not getting high.
You're not.

1834
01:56:20.850 --> 01:56:24.410
But there's another thing too with me working registry,

1835
01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:25.950
you get access to the cigarettes.

1836
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:29.220
So I was like the guy that sold the cigarettes in jail,

1837
01:56:29.221 --> 01:56:31.410
even though I didn't sell any cigarettes,
I shut that shit down.

1838
01:56:31.411 --> 01:56:33.270
I just smoked them.
Oh yes.

1839
01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:36.600
So I will use my cigarettes will give me leverage to do shit.

1840
01:56:37.110 --> 01:56:39.270
You know what I'm saying?
Like you have to sneak where you could smoke them to.

1841
01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:43.320
Is it like a demo because it was no cigarettes of and county.
I mean we're just,

1842
01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:47.370
you smoke after down like after 10:00 PM when they've cut all the lights on the

1843
01:56:47.371 --> 01:56:49.520
shit.
Everybody's smoking in the room.
Yeah.

1844
01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:52.040
<v 0>And breed you have,
oh is it,
is it ventilated</v>

1845
01:56:52.770 --> 01:56:55.310
<v 10>once they lock you down?
No,
motherfuckers leaving out the bubble.</v>

1846
01:56:55.311 --> 01:56:57.200
They ain't paying y'all no attention.
No Mode A.

1847
01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:00.360
Every now and then we get ready and get caught in.
What you do is it's,

1848
01:57:00.361 --> 01:57:00.951
it's terrible.

1849
01:57:00.951 --> 01:57:04.520
You take 'em baby powder and put it in the sock and you just beat the walls and

1850
01:57:04.521 --> 01:57:07.220
everywhere and you wake up in the morning and looking like a fucking cocaine

1851
01:57:07.230 --> 01:57:11.330
castle
boot up.
Yeah.

1852
01:57:11.331 --> 01:57:14.960
And Are you spray bleach and it gets rid of the lesion in baby powder.

1853
01:57:14.961 --> 01:57:18.090
So that was our air fresheners.
But so yeah,
so me,
I would have the cigarette,

1854
01:57:18.091 --> 01:57:20.220
so I'll just use cigarettes.
Like I could be wanting to take a nap,

1855
01:57:20.221 --> 01:57:22.640
but motherfuckers out there yelling too loud,
playing space.
I'm like,

1856
01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:24.710
I'll get y'all motherfuckers a cigarette to shut the fuck up.

1857
01:57:25.290 --> 01:57:27.230
You know what I'm saying?
Give him a cigarette.
They shit fuck up.

1858
01:57:27.470 --> 01:57:31.310
So I was like running shit because the cigarettes,

<v 0>So it's 10 o'clock lights out.</v>

1860
01:57:33.630 --> 01:57:36.590
The guards aren't around like is that one in the party?

1861
01:57:36.990 --> 01:57:41.100
<v 10>Yeah.

That's all.</v>

1862
01:57:41.101 --> 01:57:42.910

02:00:08.541 --> 02:00:11.670
you got you got you.
Okay.
And what kind of snacks did you have?
I know

1909
02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:16.690
<v 10>I was the king of like,
yeah,
what,
what,
what's the high value snacks with me?</v>

1910
02:00:16.691 --> 02:00:19.120
I'm not really a sugar motherfucker like that anyway.

1911
02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:23.530
So with me when commissary you only can spend $100 like a week or some shit.

1912
02:00:23.950 --> 02:00:27.900
So I was more so to the sox draws tee shirt by mother fucker.

1913
02:00:28.110 --> 02:00:31.500
Damn near kill your whole hundred dollars or some shit.
Yeah,
sure.

1914
02:00:31.750 --> 02:00:33.610
So I always just bought new sites cause I didn't,

1915
02:00:33.670 --> 02:00:35.890
I'm not a motherfucking hair wash and tee shirts and shit.
Yeah.

1916
02:00:35.891 --> 02:00:37.930
You know that should just blame.
Yeah.
And I don't know.

1917
02:00:37.931 --> 02:00:42.660
So I just always stay new stock fresh.
So I was more so on that way.

1918
02:00:42.910 --> 02:00:45.070
May fresh stocks still feel good,

1919
02:00:47.530 --> 02:00:48.400
always kept.

1920
02:00:48.610 --> 02:00:51.460
And it's to the point where I would stack up so many like dirty socks and tee

1921
02:00:51.461 --> 02:00:53.410
shirts and draws.
Motherfuckers are taken from it.

1922
02:00:53.420 --> 02:00:56.040
I'd take them and wash them and wear them their selves.
It's it

1923
02:00:58.240 --> 02:01:01.470
<v 0>disgusted,
but what were the big snacks there?</v>

1924
02:01:01.810 --> 02:01:06.070
<v 10>Oh motherfuckers like making,
oh well me,
I had a cool guy from southwest.</v>

1925
02:01:06.090 --> 02:01:09.280
They may own burritos.
He would take it home.

1926
02:01:09.550 --> 02:01:13.930
That's when you take a bag of Doritos and shit and you crunch them up real fine

1927
02:01:13.931 --> 02:01:18.190
and you take like a plastic bag and you lay that out.
Then you put like the,

1928
02:01:18.300 --> 02:01:20.080
the the crust Doritos.

1929
02:01:20.110 --> 02:01:25.110
Then you chop up like slim jims and beef steaks and cheese sticks and at you and

1930
02:01:25.901 --> 02:01:27.760
you put it together and you roll it up like a Burrito.

1931
02:01:27.761 --> 02:01:30.670
Do you put it under the hot water?
You just let the house

1932
02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:35.270
<v 0>water rather than it didn't close it all together so no shit was kind of
firearm.</v>

1933
02:01:35.410 --> 02:01:36.270
That's kind of good.

1934
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:45.050
<v 11>Yeah.
I like,
is it Nacho cheese?
Doritos.
Cool ranch.
Okay,
that's good.</v>

1935
02:01:45.100 --> 02:01:50.060
That's
another thing that God put me up on was what got me through a lot too.

1936
02:01:50.061 --> 02:01:54.650
You take a bag of like barbecue chips,
crunchy crunching up chips,
I don't know.

1937
02:01:56.090 --> 02:01:59.750
So they crunch up barbecue chips and you put boiled eggs in there and you shake

1938
02:01:59.751 --> 02:02:04.070
them up,
you shake them up.
It's like happy Easter.

1939
02:02:12.830 --> 02:02:17.830
[inaudible]

1940
02:02:23.390 --> 02:02:25.950
did you guys,
do you have access to booze when people sneak

1941
02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:32.480
county jail to do weird shit.

1942
02:02:33.230 --> 02:02:38.230
Toilet wine and I think the banana peels right or some shit.

1943
02:02:41.770 --> 02:02:43.690
Shit,
I had cigarettes.
I was cool.

1944
02:02:45.700 --> 02:02:48.490
You obviously know this is the home of the Cool Guy Club.
We found

1945
02:02:51.080 --> 02:02:53.660
you might appreciate this.
This is another voicemail.

1946
02:02:54.340 --> 02:02:57.950
Young lady posted that.
She was like,

1947
02:02:57.951 --> 02:03:01.820
I don't know why I gave my number to this guy,
but he,
he,

1948
02:03:01.940 --> 02:03:04.310
he gave her a call and left a voicemail.

1949
02:03:04.430 --> 02:03:08.960
This is the day after she gave him the number.
Gotcha.

1950
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:11.480
Go ahead.
What's a

1951

She never responded back.
Um,</v>

1952
02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:19.700

1953
02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:22.713
<v 11>Dominguez Hill,</v>

1954
02:03:25.170 --> 02:03:29.050

Minimum wage job at Marshall.

1956
02:03:32.620 --> 02:03:36.690
Thank you to bomb and avian a firecracker wearing wigs like you use some 90 year

1957
02:03:36.691 --> 02:03:38.340
old lady with no hair.

1958
02:03:38.670 --> 02:03:41.780
Whoa mean.

1959
02:03:41.790 --> 02:03:46.350
I thought she had a nice face and body,
but beyond that,

1960
02:03:46.351 --> 02:03:49.110
there's so many chicks in San Diego with that and I got plenty of them.

1961
02:03:50.570 --> 02:03:51.470
<v 11>San Diego</v>

1962
02:03:52.430 --> 02:03:54.430
<v 13>about to be chasing you around.
I mean,</v>

1963
02:03:54.431 --> 02:03:56.500
unless you're mentally retarded or something.

1964
02:03:56.501 --> 02:04:00.160
Normally you want somebody calls or texted you that you gave your number to

1965
02:04:00.161 --> 02:04:04.260
respond back.
I guess you too retarded to realize that.

1966
02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:06.520
I'm going to just go ahead and delete your number.

1967
02:04:10.780 --> 02:04:14.880
<v 11>Yeah,
go for it.
Dude.
I love when people tell you I'm going to delete your number.</v>

1968
02:04:14.890 --> 02:04:18.830
I just do it
as

1969
02:04:22.420 --> 02:04:26.730
women say,
men are trash.
By the way.

1970
02:04:26.780 --> 02:04:31.260
This kind of lift that after I texted you yesterday,
that's it.
This is the call.

1971
02:04:33.780 --> 02:04:38.160
You texted her.
All right.
She didn't respond back and then you leave that.
Well,

1972

there's a cool guy.
He's very cool.

1974
02:04:47.730 --> 02:04:49.420
But there's guys like that,
uh,

1975
02:04:49.421 --> 02:04:51.560
they keep calling and calling and they don't get the picture.

1976
02:04:51.561 --> 02:04:53.550
They don't get the message that you're not interested.
Yeah.

1977
02:04:53.551 --> 02:04:57.200
I think this is what's so cool about this guy is that I think this is called

1978
02:04:57.201 --> 02:04:57.990
number one.

1979
02:04:57.990 --> 02:05:01.430
<v 7>Yeah,

He just gave up.
He gave up.</v>

He debt Marshall sounds like he's at least 30,</v>

1982
02:05:07.260 --> 02:05:10.330

Close animal wage jobs where you shot bid.
Yeah.

1988
02:05:31.960 --> 02:05:33.850
Yeah.
That's a good point.

1991
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:47.000

but I wanted to play it.

1992
02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:50.190
Oh Shit.

I liked her because it was Tinier in the pussy hole.</v>

1994

If told me it was like tiny as a quitter.
So when I,

1995

2018
02:07:40.340 --> 02:07:44.560
I'm guessing you're not.
Do you shower up before?

2019

Why am I just go for it?</v>

2033
02:08:35.910 --> 02:08:40.710
You shouldn't do it.
No,

Alright.
ODB was into it.

2034
02:08:40.740 --> 02:08:44.150
No,

He's special.
He's more talented.
Crazy man.

2035
02:08:44.151 --> 02:08:46.590
He is crazy shit.

2040
02:09:02.431 --> 02:09:06.630
It was just like when MTV used to do like MTV news reports and they said like

2041
02:09:06.631 --> 02:09:11.631
this fucking nerd and he went in a limousine yet pick pickup is boost up.

2042
02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:18.150
Yeah.
And he was like,
Hey,
he was drinking and it was hilarious cause white,

2043
02:09:18.151 --> 02:09:20.670
but whatever.
That's free money.
Right.

2044
02:09:20.671 --> 02:09:24.840
Did what parts I go turn down free money.

2045
02:09:25.950 --> 02:09:30.420
Damn ODB.
And he left the welfare office in a limo and he was,
yes,

2046
02:09:30.540 --> 02:09:33.990
go crazy.
Best Black.
Excellent.

2047
02:09:33.991 --> 02:09:37.870
Ed is fine for me as a kid.
See it.

2048
02:09:37.871 --> 02:09:39.780
That looks like that is what I went to aspire to that.

2049
02:09:42.090 --> 02:09:45.780
That's my hero.
That is black.
Excellent is fine.

2050
02:09:46.660 --> 02:09:51.350
<v 11>Oh,
DB was one of a kind man.
Yeah.
One of a kind.
Um,
big baby.
Jesus.</v>

2051
02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:52.533
<v 14>Probably my phone</v>

2052
02:09:55.840 --> 02:09:59.620
every day.
Every day.
Like my probably three times a day.

2053
02:10:00.130 --> 02:10:05.000
I drank so much that the prisoners was actually training old,
dirty cello.

2054
02:10:06.870 --> 02:10:07.703
<v 7>Huh?</v>

2055
02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:13.280
Shit

2056
02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:17.710
<v 11>man.
This mother fucker was crazy man.
Yeah.
It was a fucking genius though.</v>

2057
02:10:17.740 --> 02:10:19.060
That was the thing about it.
Anybody.

2058
02:10:19.061 --> 02:10:22.280
I think everybody that's so talented in something,
right.
Dave just lead,

2059
02:10:22.330 --> 02:10:26.110
lose other shifts in the process of becoming at time and Dick because he

2060
02:10:26.111 --> 02:10:27.760
definitely was a crazy motherfucker,
man.

2061
02:10:27.910 --> 02:10:30.760
He's got a lot of people used to try to compare me to old dirty bastard and shit

2062
02:10:30.910 --> 02:10:33.530
a lot and stuff and I just be like,
y'all crazy Maca.
Never compare it.

2063
02:10:33.531 --> 02:10:34.070
No Shit like

2064
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:37.250
<v 10>that.
Well he was also like,
um,
I don't think,
like you said,</v>

2065
02:10:37.251 --> 02:10:39.710
you never learned wrap me.
He would just,

2066
02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:42.170
I mean I'm from the interviews and things I've seen,

2067
02:10:42.290 --> 02:10:46.520
they would just take him in the studio,
but yeah,

2068
02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:50.760
I remembered risen Jesus,
his cousins.
Right.
So those are,
he was the little cove.

2069
02:10:50.761 --> 02:10:54.610
So those are your big,
yeah.
So even just looking up to him,

2070
02:10:54.611 --> 02:10:58.190
like he would say they owe raps and most of his songs like just oh reps,

2071
02:10:58.191 --> 02:11:01.970
they wrote his kids and shit.
A lot of his reps was like just old wraps.

2072
02:11:01.971 --> 02:11:04.250
He was just randomly saying shit.
Are you,
were you,
uh,

2073
02:11:04.251 --> 02:11:07.340
is there any producer that you are like,
ah man,

2074
02:11:07.341 --> 02:11:09.240
I would love to do a record with someone.

2075
02:11:09.980 --> 02:11:14.570
I think most of them I've worked with already some sense,
but I guess,

2076
02:11:14.710 --> 02:11:18.140
no,
I don't,
I want to say cause I'm kind of,

2077
02:11:18.460 --> 02:11:22.070
well I can't really talk about it all right of shit.
But yeah,

2078
02:11:22.130 --> 02:11:26.150
I guess I would probably,
I would love to work with Reza.

2079
02:11:27.410 --> 02:11:30.320
I want you to do something with Suede.
The remix.
God,
swear to,
I love it.

2080
02:11:30.350 --> 02:11:34.010
I love him.
I love city.
I love it.
Shit.

2081
02:11:34.370 --> 02:11:36.830
I don't know why I feel like you guys would vibe.
No,
I definitely,
I could,

2082
02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:41.840
I can get on some of his shit.
But I think um,
me and music is starting to,

2083
02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:45.500
music is starting to be,
so I'm kind of the best way.

2084
02:11:45.501 --> 02:11:48.290
Like it's starting to be so computerized.
I know how to say it.

2085
02:11:48.291 --> 02:11:51.770
Like it seems just so easy to make type shit.

2086
02:11:52.100 --> 02:11:57.100
So I'm trying to do a more traditional back to making 30 fucking 40 year old rap

2087
02:11:58.461 --> 02:12:01.030
now.
You know what I'm saying?
I can't make this shit.
The kids make no more.
Yeah,

2088
02:12:01.031 --> 02:12:04.370
yeah,
yeah.
I'm starting to go back and take a more traditional approach.

2089
02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:05.540
Even with recording it.

2090
02:12:05.570 --> 02:12:08.600
Like I don't even really want to record in protools and shit.

2091
02:12:08.601 --> 02:12:12.170
The more I want to still have that old Warren tape sound and shit like that.

2092
02:12:12.170 --> 02:12:14.330
So just doing everything that I grew up listening to,

2093
02:12:14.331 --> 02:12:16.910
which is like Wu Tang knives and stuff like that.

2094
02:12:16.911 --> 02:12:20.390
So trying to make music like they made music,
my deep stuff like that.

2095
02:12:20.391 --> 02:12:22.930
So I'm going back to doing stuff like that.
No,
I was just,

2096
02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:26.030
I was just learning the eye cause I remember when,
you know,

2097
02:12:26.031 --> 02:12:28.040
sometimes you remember the moment,

2098
02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:31.250
but you don't realize the historical impact of it.

2099
02:12:31.620 --> 02:12:33.290
I remember when illmatic came out,

2100
02:12:33.710 --> 02:12:36.110
but then watching that there was like this documentary about it.

2101
02:12:36.140 --> 02:12:41.140
I didn't realize how crazy that album was because he just don't eat 19.

2102
02:12:42.590 --> 02:12:45.620
That's why.
Um,
and also who,
who decided to like,

2103
02:12:46.110 --> 02:12:48.470
cause you forget like I just remember buying the album,
listening to it,

2104
02:12:48.650 --> 02:12:51.570
but you forget that at the time he's,

2105
02:12:51.650 --> 02:12:54.470
it's being produced by like every top producer in the game.

2106
02:12:54.471 --> 02:12:56.840
And that was the first time that happened.
Nobody really,

2107
02:12:56.841 --> 02:12:58.550
most of the time you'll get a budget.

2108
02:12:58.551 --> 02:13:03.200
You will just have one producer or you know,
but like Q tip,
but all got premier,

2109
02:13:03.230 --> 02:13:07.340
all the top people and they've Seeked him out.
Put Him.
That's crazy.

2110
02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:12.370
But yeah,
I fucking prodigy man,
like 19 years old and saying this shit,

2111
02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:16.100
he's saying,
that's why I don't never give any excuse when people talk about,

2112
02:13:16.101 --> 02:13:17.270
but he's young.
He's a kid.

2113
02:13:17.271 --> 02:13:19.850
Like especially in this day and age are making music where,
you know,

2114
02:13:19.851 --> 02:13:22.450
rappers probably dominated by teenagers right now.
Sure.

2115
02:13:22.550 --> 02:13:27.000
But now it's just 19 motherfucker ain't no excuse now.
No excuse.

2116
02:13:27.010 --> 02:13:27.980
I'm making dope music.

2117
02:13:27.981 --> 02:13:31.100
So just cause you're young don't mean you have the right to mix bullshit.

2118
02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:32.020
So young

2119
02:13:32.020 --> 02:13:36.360
<v 11>man.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

2120
02:13:36.420 --> 02:13:40.830
what's going on with,
with,
with uh,
this pronoun thing.
What does this,

2121
02:13:40.831 --> 02:13:44.880
is this another wait,
what?
Oh,
the Starbucks stuff?
Yeah.
Oh,
that's,

2122
02:13:44.881 --> 02:13:48.980
that's something that Christina,
this is a while.
Oh.
Oh yeah.
It put it up.

2123
02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:53.370
There's these pins now.
Uh,
I believe the employees,

2124
02:13:54.510 --> 02:13:57.300
the hey,
uh,
oh,
they were their program.
You can wear your,

2125
02:13:57.330 --> 02:14:00.790
do you know about this one,
Danny?
That's a little bit too much,
man.
See Jesse,

2126
02:14:00.850 --> 02:14:05.690
you see this?
That's only American man.
We take shit too serious.
Hey,

2127
02:14:05.691 --> 02:14:10.380
um,
what's your name?
What's your preferred pronouns?
They,
them,
theirs.
He,
him,

2128
02:14:10.381 --> 02:14:14.440
his,
she,
her,
hers.
Like little yesterday

2129
02:14:14.970 --> 02:14:19.160
<v 7>I was watching a motherfucker uhmm a dog jumping contest.
Y'All seen his shit.</v>

2130
02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:21.810
And I thought to myself like,

2131
02:14:21.811 --> 02:14:25.860
who cares if your dog jump hired and his mother fuckers to this shit?

2132
02:14:25.861 --> 02:14:27.960
So it was a dog agility contest.
I know.

2133
02:14:27.961 --> 02:14:31.230
I'm an only motherfucker that shit yesterday.
And I'm in my hotel room.
Like,

2134
02:14:31.231 --> 02:14:34.800
what the fuck is only in America?
Where am I going to cook?
I'll be like,

2135
02:14:34.801 --> 02:14:38.720
my dog can jump higher than yours.
Let's see,
I need a motherfuckers.

2136
02:14:38.750 --> 02:14:40.350
Did it and then they televise.

2137
02:14:40.351 --> 02:14:43.390
It is a fucking connotation where everybody bringing their dogs out.

2138
02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:45.070
Like my dog jumped higher.
No,
no dog.

2139
02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:50.410
<v 11>Yeah.
This is definitely a symptom.</v>

2140
02:14:50.411 --> 02:14:54.760
That's what you shared about when life is too easy,
so high,

2141
02:14:54.761 --> 02:14:56.260
these dogs can jump and then it's like,

2142
02:14:56.261 --> 02:14:58.870
I felt so bad for the dog because I'm looking at,
you can see the owners.

2143
02:14:58.871 --> 02:15:02.500
They got these real stern and phases.
They take initiative serious like,
God damn,

2144
02:15:02.501 --> 02:15:06.090
man,
I ain't doing fucking obstacle courses and shit.
Come on,
man.
Yeah,

2145
02:15:06.460 --> 02:15:09.910
we're having technical difficulty.
What's Your Pronoun?
Press pause.

2146
02:15:09.911 --> 02:15:13.570
We were just blacked out.
Oh,
did we get here?
It was okay.

2147
02:15:13.690 --> 02:15:17.830
Our computers went down for him.
It.
Oh,
oh,
we're,
yeah,
we're back.
All right.

2148
02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:21.100
That was easy.
Yeah,
it does seem like a privileged fucking problem.

2149
02:15:21.101 --> 02:15:25.310
I was just reading on Twitter about weight.
Privilege.
What's that?
It's a mouth

2150
02:15:26.830 --> 02:15:29.480
feel shitty or need to check your weight.
Check your white privilege.

2151
02:15:29.500 --> 02:15:34.240
Did you know that because you're a quote normal weighted that it's a privilege

2152
02:15:34.270 --> 02:15:37.630
and you need to check it now you chose.
If you're not overweight,

2153
02:15:37.631 --> 02:15:39.850
people that are overweight,

2154
02:15:40.090 --> 02:15:44.260
like don't have the same advantages that you take for granted.

2155
02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:48.070
Oh Wow.
You know,
and check your privilege under 600.

2156
02:15:48.270 --> 02:15:52.580
You're this asshole walking around.
Yeah.
That's only in America.

2157
02:15:54.430 --> 02:15:56.550
Nobody in Jeremy thinks about shit like that.
Nah,

2158
02:15:56.890 --> 02:15:58.430
they just eat these sausages in prayers.

2159
02:15:58.790 --> 02:16:02.170
Pull apart the date it is Americans bring,
uh,

2160
02:16:02.230 --> 02:16:07.230
like we have a really interesting way of making things like that are not issues

2161
02:16:07.570 --> 02:16:11.200
issues.
I got in front of me at West so we'll kind of cool to be fed.
Yes.

2162
02:16:11.201 --> 02:16:14.400
And like a certain place like Texas as cool to be fair.
Yeah.
I love this place.

2163
02:16:14.410 --> 02:16:16.560
It's good.
I think that's where I want to retire.
Like Texas,

2164
02:16:16.570 --> 02:16:18.670
like they'd like fat motherfucker.
Yeah.

2165
02:16:18.710 --> 02:16:20.830
See I'm in the Strip club in lemon pepper wings.

2166
02:16:21.610 --> 02:16:25.640
<v 7>No,
it's like throwing a bone pitches.
Just come to him.</v>

2167
02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:29.980
He'd be skinny.
They like to fuck around with you.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Yes.

2168
02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:33.760
<v 11>Hang with this.
And they think you pour.
If you skinny,</v>

2169
02:16:34.780 --> 02:16:39.070
I was going to ask you to,
in the Midwest,
do you guys have this pronoun stuff or

2170
02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:42.100
they don't?
That's not a thing.

2171
02:16:42.150 --> 02:16:44.560
This is just a West Cape beat up for being gay in Michigan.

2172
02:16:55.410 --> 02:16:59.530
We are very close.
That's why I can't go nowhere else.
That's why I love it,
man.

2173
02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:06.550
And keep you in check.
Yeah.
You feel like it's more,

2174
02:17:06.910 --> 02:17:09.010
it's more indicative of the rest of the country.

2175
02:17:09.011 --> 02:17:11.500
Like this is kind of how normal people are in the Midwest.

2176
02:17:11.501 --> 02:17:16.501
Not How la is definitely ain't on no fucking Kito Diet.

2177
02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:20.500
Eat Kale and being gluten free and shit.

2178
02:17:20.501 --> 02:17:22.720
Motherfuckers ordering Domino's and shit.

2179
02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:28.510
We get lost in a bubble out here in New York.

2180
02:17:31.540 --> 02:17:34.190
It's just too expensive.
I live like a king where I'm from.

2181
02:17:37.530 --> 02:17:40.640
I know.
That's the way to do it,
man.
So fuck it.
No.

2182
02:17:49.140 --> 02:17:50.770
Okay,
so you take a plastic bag,

2183
02:17:51.310 --> 02:17:54.160
can't take some Doritos

2184
02:17:56.900 --> 02:17:57.733
plastic,

2185
02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:03.160
chop up some cheese with beef and cheese sticks until it,
that's the key.

2186
02:18:03.161 --> 02:18:07.840
The beef and the cheese,
put it under some hot water.

2187
02:18:07.870 --> 02:18:12.670
It's good for a minute.
You got to make it the authentic way to,

2188
02:18:12.671 --> 02:18:16.300
I'm not letting you skip it.
My mother fucking Michael,

2189
02:18:17.500 --> 02:18:19.830
I just pretty much knew what was in it.

2190
02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:27.370
He used to kill it to kill cigarette in the Burrito for big shit.

2191
02:18:27.371 --> 02:18:28.780
You living your best life.
So he would,

2192
02:18:29.680 --> 02:18:34.150
but he would get something in a trade for that
shit.

2193
02:18:34.151 --> 02:18:38.320
He was pretty much like steps.
That's a big deal.

2194
02:18:38.321 --> 02:18:39.610
Stamps and letter envelopes.

2195
02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:45.610
So there's gotta be dudes in jail who are just,

2196
02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:50.790
you know,
not savvy,
not with it.
And then all of nothing.
But I mean like,

2197
02:18:51.080 --> 02:18:54.400
like never like they're the ones who are like,
I need stamps,
I need socks,

2198
02:18:54.670 --> 02:18:56.800
I need shirts,
but they don't got shit.

2199
02:18:56.801 --> 02:18:59.910
I ain't got shit and they don't get shit if they don't get shit

2200
02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:06.070
a lot.
That makes you just more and more fucking,
I guess bummed out.

2201
02:19:06.500 --> 02:19:10.240
You be the one fucking mopping my floor for a cigarette and shit.
Like

2202
02:19:13.060 --> 02:19:14.260
how are these people,

2203
02:19:14.261 --> 02:19:18.610
these inmates dating people on the motherfuckers in prison

2204
02:19:20.470 --> 02:19:21.580
for a long time.

2205
02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:26.470
That's when you can buy a TV and a CD players and shit like that where I'm at in

2206
02:19:26.471 --> 02:19:28.180
county jail.
You Ain't getting shit.
Yeah,

2207
02:19:28.210 --> 02:19:31.910
<v 2>right.
Yeah.
What'd you only do it for a year?
So that's Kinda,
I did eight months.</v>

2208
02:19:32.240 --> 02:19:33.070
That's still,
that's long.

2209
02:19:33.070 --> 02:19:33.903
<v 3>No,</v>

2210
02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:39.940

He did two weeks at the towers,</v>

2211
02:19:39.941 --> 02:19:44.800
twin towers downtown,
which is horrible because they forgot about him.

2212
02:19:44.890 --> 02:19:49.360
Oh yeah.
No.
To have a loss of a system monitor.
Five had my DJ.
We did.
We had went,

2213
02:19:49.361 --> 02:19:54.250
he had some old like warrants or some shit and we went to China for a day,

2214
02:19:54.310 --> 02:19:57.530
like a dummy like I am.
We went to China for a day and came right back home.

2215
02:19:57.550 --> 02:19:59.520
When we landed in New York,
the police locked his ass.

2216
02:19:59.640 --> 02:20:03.010
Didn't record for like a month.
Whoa.
It got lost in the system to have,

2217
02:20:03.011 --> 02:20:06.880
I didn't have my managers and shit on it and they got him out.
Whoa.
Yeah.

2218
02:20:06.881 --> 02:20:09.100
That's what he did when he got lost in the system though.
That's horrible.

2219
02:20:09.220 --> 02:20:13.330
It is horrible.
Um,
yeah,
it looks so,
one of my favorite types of videos up,

2220
02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:16.180
we played them before.
I don't know if you like,
these are not,

2221
02:20:16.210 --> 02:20:20.560
this is when somebody is still under the effects of like an anesthesia.

2222
02:20:21.410 --> 02:20:22.780
They're coming out of it,
you know,

2223
02:20:22.781 --> 02:20:25.150
but they're saying crazy shit that they normally don't say.

2224
02:20:25.600 --> 02:20:27.370
And this patient was like when I drink.

2225

but I hate that shit too.
Like,

but be conscious.
Okay.

2259
02:23:06.780 --> 02:23:08.820
It's not cool at all.
Dot.

2260
02:23:10.560 --> 02:23:14.070
I have a blackout in a long time and then motherfuckers been telling me he was

2263
02:23:22.540 --> 02:23:26.580
I woke up in my hotel room in his blood.
Everywhere is glass.

2264
02:23:26.581 --> 02:23:30.400
Everywhere is throw up everywhere and I don't know what the fuck just happened.

2265
02:23:30.420 --> 02:23:31.560
You know what I'm saying is when you wake up,

2266

2268
02:23:41.390 --> 02:23:42.870
I mean,

2269
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:45.300
Like why don't you come down from his moment?

2270
02:23:45.301 --> 02:23:47.070
You got to realize what fucked up shit you did.

So I'm just trying to keep it going.
Yeah.
What did I say last night?

2272
02:23:49.831 --> 02:23:50.820
Did I do anything?
That's the

2273
02:23:51.290 --> 02:23:54.200
<v 2>moment then when you go like such a parent,
I man,
I remember like,</v>

2274
02:23:54.220 --> 02:23:57.530
well the one of the last ones that I did was like years ago,
but I was,

2275
02:23:57.620 --> 02:24:00.290
I had this job out here in la and uh,

2276
02:24:00.500 --> 02:24:03.030
everybody from the office got together at this ball.

2277
02:24:03.840 --> 02:24:06.190
<v 3>I remember it there.
And Yeah,

Was this your birthday?
No,

2279
02:24:08.581 --> 02:24:10.010
When you jumped rope and the on that,

2280
02:24:11.830 --> 02:24:12.680
<v 7>that was different times.</v>

2281
02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:15.730
<v 2>So before we were dating we started dating.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But similar,</v>

2282
02:24:15.830 --> 02:24:18.220
the guy for me here,
before that,
before we started dating,

2283
02:24:18.520 --> 02:24:22.690
I was at working at this job at an entertainment company and we went out and I

2284
02:24:22.691 --> 02:24:26.980
just,
all I remember was,
well,
I remember nothing.
I remember like the,

2285
02:24:26.981 --> 02:24:30.190
before the blackout.
So then I,
my friend was like,
man,

2286
02:24:30.910 --> 02:24:32.920
buddy was gathered around,

2287
02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:37.690
everyone was gathered around and you were holding court,

2288
02:24:37.870 --> 02:24:41.290
like telling the story and people were laughing and you were just like almost

2289
02:24:41.291 --> 02:24:44.620
performing to them.
Right.
And he goes and you were super fucked up.

2290
02:24:45.420 --> 02:24:48.090
It goes in the middle of the story.
You just projecting,

2291
02:24:48.130 --> 02:24:51.870
<v 7>tell vomit,
hey goes,
they,
you know,</v>

2292
02:24:51.920 --> 02:24:55.150
after you spit your like,
like try to get it out,

2293
02:24:55.151 --> 02:24:59.290
you go spit and then you kind of lean stood back up and you kept telling your

2294
02:24:59.291 --> 02:25:04.060
story and everybody was like,
we're out of here man.

2295
02:25:04.940 --> 02:25:06.220
I was like mortified.

2296
02:25:06.930 --> 02:25:09.270
<v 2>It was friends,
but it was also people from work.
We weren't good.</v>

2297
02:25:09.330 --> 02:25:12.090
So that was Saturday night.
So then Monday morning you go,

2298
02:25:12.091 --> 02:25:14.220
I would go in to work was like you are.

2299
02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:18.450
<v 7>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

2300
02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:21.610
<v 3>Well we can only be comedians and rappers.
I mean you just,</v>

2301
02:25:22.360 --> 02:25:24.270
what the fuck are you going to do?
You kind of get a pass

2302
02:25:24.270 --> 02:25:27.130
<v 7>for it.
People take your piece.
Definitely.
If you're,</v>

2303
02:25:27.980 --> 02:25:30.070
if you're performing doing that shit,
everyone's like,
that's cool.

2304
02:25:30.071 --> 02:25:30.904
It's like another story.

2305
02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:33.930
<v 10>Yeah.
Yeah.
Cause I can't really,
I don't know.</v>

2306
02:25:33.931 --> 02:25:37.260
I can't really have to like have a little something to go on stage.

2307
02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:41.460
Like I get worried about a whole bunch of people just staring at me type shit.

2308
02:25:41.490 --> 02:25:44.070
Sure.
So I'd like to have a few drinks before going on stage,

2309
02:25:44.071 --> 02:25:46.350
but a few drinks into turning to me being drunk as hell.

2310
02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:50.820
And I do always worry when I wake up the next day of saying crazy shit cause

2311
02:25:50.821 --> 02:25:55.821
I've done it so many times where like I definitely a habitual line stepper but I

2312
02:25:57.520 --> 02:26:00.450
get drunk.
I was getting a kick out of like pushing people buttons and Shit.
Yeah.

2313
02:26:00.451 --> 02:26:01.850
That's the fun part of it.
Yeah.

2314
02:26:02.100 --> 02:26:05.040
And as doing shit that you wouldn't be doing sober type shit.

2315
02:26:05.041 --> 02:26:07.710
So and I don't like that because that's like you're turned into another person.

2316
02:26:07.980 --> 02:26:09.960
Yeah.
What are you drinking?
I drink tequila

2317
02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:11.130
<v 7>that she makes sure</v>

2318
02:26:13.230 --> 02:26:14.150
<v 10>because I'd use it,</v>

2319
02:26:14.151 --> 02:26:18.390
drink a lot of Hennessy coming up and they'll just give you so much heartburn

2320
02:26:18.730 --> 02:26:23.610
and the browns the next day,
the browns,
some next level shit.

2321
02:26:23.640 --> 02:26:24.750
You know what I'm saying?
So

2322
02:26:26.220 --> 02:26:30.100
<v 7>it's hot,
but Tequila doesn't give you hot browns.
Yeah.</v>

2323
02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:31.320
You just dripping mud

2324
02:26:38.140 --> 02:26:39.360
<v 1>frown.
Todd.</v>

2325
02:26:42.030 --> 02:26:46.630
Can I tell you this morning I had my

2326
02:26:46.780 --> 02:26:50.470
<v 7>first official short of 2019.</v>

2327
02:26:51.430 --> 02:26:55.870
I can see,
here's the deal man.
I had men as shit.
We flew to Africa.

2328
02:26:55.871 --> 02:26:59.260
I sharted on the way,
but that's because I had three tacos.

2329
02:27:00.340 --> 02:27:05.200
That's stupid idea.
But it was a,
it wasn't liquid.
Sharpe this morning was liquid.

2330
02:27:05.230 --> 02:27:08.890
Like I farted and like liquid came out of my flat hall.
Yeah.

2331
02:27:08.891 --> 02:27:10.600
And then I had diarrhea.
Is that what happened?

2332
02:27:14.750 --> 02:27:16.510
Is that what you had with your Hennessy?

2333
02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:18.920
<v 10>There you go.
Some more of a morning.</v>

2334
02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:22.370
I had the worst is Molly if people didn't know if you take,

2335
02:27:22.880 --> 02:27:25.490
that's why when you go to those festival tolerates you go to the porter potties.

2336
02:27:25.491 --> 02:27:29.070
Yeah.
Do motherfuckers is just,
they just spraying compost.

2337
02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:33.980
It just makes you go instantly.
And I remember,
um,
I had a show,

2338
02:27:33.981 --> 02:27:38.670
I opened up a,
a childish Gambino at Central Park.
Wow.
I did a little more,
oh,

2339
02:27:38.690 --> 02:27:39.530
that's crazy,
man.

2340
02:27:42.220 --> 02:27:45.440
<v 7>What's it like?
Remember dude,
what's it like to do in that though?
Central Park.</v>

2341
02:27:45.670 --> 02:27:48.440
That's crazy.
But that's on the resume.
Took Molly.

2342
02:27:51.320 --> 02:27:54.710
I just remember being on stage and just having an hour long conversation with

2343
02:27:54.711 --> 02:27:59.570
myself like you're about to shit on yourself.
I was saying to myself like,

2344
02:27:59.630 --> 02:28:01.100
all right,
this is going to happen.

2345
02:28:01.130 --> 02:28:03.950
Cause he just started like I still got 45 minutes of this shit.

2346
02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:07.780
He Pekin you know what I'm saying?
He looking out the curtains,

2347
02:28:07.790 --> 02:28:08.623
you know what I'm saying?

2348
02:28:11.320 --> 02:28:14.350
<v 10>I let his plate and start thinking about like maybe Donald got some shorts or</v>

2349
02:28:14.351 --> 02:28:18.580
something funny like how maybe I can shit,
but all right.
Oh my sax is white.

2350
02:28:19.690 --> 02:28:22.040
I don't like these long shorts,
but I thought

2351
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:25.010
<v 11>I could maybe beat the case man shit.
And he's shorts.</v>

2352
02:28:25.220 --> 02:28:27.680
But I may make a long story short.

2353
02:28:27.770 --> 02:28:32.330
I'll be able to very agonizing.
Terrible set for me.

2354
02:28:32.331 --> 02:28:36.190
But I think I,
I think it was a good step for the crowd.
Yeah,
they're no good.

2355
02:28:36.191 --> 02:28:38.550
I'll walk you right.
That dude needs to shift everything.

2356
02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:42.980
You're under adversity like you play your best shells like when I'm sick or when

2357
02:28:42.981 --> 02:28:46.760
I really don't even feel like doing it.
That's when I always had my best sets.

2358
02:28:46.940 --> 02:28:47.110
Yeah.

2359
02:28:47.110 --> 02:28:51.350
But I remember Springton from the mother fucking stage to the Porta potty and

2360
02:28:51.351 --> 02:28:53.980
when I got sick and I wasn't a nurse,
somebody sprayed that mother fucker up.

2361
02:28:54.050 --> 02:28:58.070
All you're looking for.
But after that it was a party.

2362
02:28:58.100 --> 02:29:02.270
You're gonna say man,
cause you find that one,

2363
02:29:02.330 --> 02:29:03.790
<v 4>you're sick or you have diarrhea.</v>

2364
02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:07.210
Doesn't your body kind of shut it down when you perform?
Like you're,

2365
02:29:07.240 --> 02:29:09.520
the adrenaline kicks in and like your body knows like,

2366
02:29:09.521 --> 02:29:10.510
oh we can't shit right now.

2367
02:29:10.970 --> 02:29:12.170
<v 11>Real sick in Europe.</v>

2368
02:29:12.500 --> 02:29:16.580
I don't know novices and I've had like maybe three weeks of shows left.

2369
02:29:16.750 --> 02:29:18.560
Oh I had to perform like every other night.

2370
02:29:18.561 --> 02:29:19.850
I'm talking about where to be a day of me.

2371
02:29:19.851 --> 02:29:23.720
Just like any bid rep and for some reason man and you're a man,

2372
02:29:23.721 --> 02:29:25.640
they don't got the heat.
Right.
Like you know what I'm saying?

2373
02:29:25.641 --> 02:29:28.020
It's always cold as fuck in a hotel rooms.
Oh yeah.

2374
02:29:28.130 --> 02:29:31.040
No matter how high you could do to try wonder why they all be drinking tea in

2375
02:29:31.041 --> 02:29:33.360
London and shit cause you motherfuckers don't,
Ya.
He'd know

2376
02:29:37.140 --> 02:29:40.220
more of yourself in that bid.
So I couldn't get healthy for shit.

2377
02:29:40.850 --> 02:29:42.350
I should've probably went to a hospital.

2378
02:29:42.351 --> 02:29:43.880
But you know when you're black you're like fuck that shit.

2379
02:29:43.910 --> 02:29:45.630
I ain't got no insurance basically.

2380
02:29:45.820 --> 02:29:48.980
I ain't going no motherfucker fucking how's Goodwin?
Helsinki?

2381
02:29:48.981 --> 02:29:50.380
I don't know what the fuck going on in Finland.

2382
02:29:52.070 --> 02:29:56.120
So I rode it out like a gene and got myself back home.
You know what I'm saying?

2383
02:29:56.121 --> 02:30:00.650
But yeah,
pick sick on stage such as or here's the worst.

2384
02:30:00.740 --> 02:30:03.260
I was sick as fuck and playing one of my shows.

2385
02:30:03.261 --> 02:30:04.730
Somebody just having too much fun,

2386
02:30:04.731 --> 02:30:09.050
just doused me with like a full glass of water.
Normal Shit,

2387
02:30:09.070 --> 02:30:12.440
like ramp shows,
you know the water on each other.
But mother Fucker,

2388
02:30:12.441 --> 02:30:15.410
I'm damn and got pneumonia.
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?
So yeah,

2389
02:30:15.560 --> 02:30:16.393
I cut that show.

2390
02:30:18.230 --> 02:30:21.400
<v 4>I think it's because they have old heating hold shit dude.</v>

2391
02:30:21.470 --> 02:30:25.210
Fucking old dumb vents in the floor or maybe the stupid,
you know?
Yeah.

2392
02:30:25.250 --> 02:30:29.120
The whining looks like Europe stope except for that,
that kind of shit.

2393
02:30:29.121 --> 02:30:32.930
And then like the oil,
we also get spoiled for space.

2394
02:30:32.931 --> 02:30:35.300
Like you go to someone's apartment,
you're like,
the fuck you live here,

2395
02:30:35.370 --> 02:30:37.480
<v 11>Tony.
The smartest thing for me was the ice situation.</v>

2396
02:30:38.350 --> 02:30:40.330
Anytime you order to get you four ice cubes,

2397
02:30:40.331 --> 02:30:43.480
like mother fucker filled his mother fucking cup.
I was,

2398
02:30:45.320 --> 02:30:48.490
I went,
I was at a place and I still remember in Italy where I was like,

2399
02:30:48.520 --> 02:30:53.050
I ordered like a coke.
I was like ice.
And the guy's like,
hey.
Then

2400
02:30:54.910 --> 02:30:56.440
he told another guy,
he was like,
just do once.

2401
02:30:57.820 --> 02:31:01.270
And then that guy left and they're like,
and then fuck with this shit.

2402
02:31:01.680 --> 02:31:04.140
<v 4>Minutes later.
I'm like,
hey man.
They're like,
he's going to get it.
I'm like,</v>

2403
02:31:04.141 --> 02:31:06.330
he's going to get it from you in the next door in a restaurant.

2404
02:31:06.331 --> 02:31:09.520
And then you know,
20 minutes later the Duke came back.
He was like,
we have,

2405
02:31:09.521 --> 02:31:12.390
we couldn't find any ice.
No Nero's don't like guys.

2406
02:31:12.540 --> 02:31:15.240
And also everything has a fucking door,
right?

2407
02:31:15.241 --> 02:31:17.460
They have 500 doors inside of the house.

2408
02:31:17.490 --> 02:31:20.130
You got to put two doors on the matter and then a door here and the door

2409
02:31:20.130 --> 02:31:22.320
<v 11>door,
door,
door.
It's terrible.
Yeah,
I love it out there.</v>

2410
02:31:22.321 --> 02:31:24.690
But you had the limousine business are not American

2411
02:31:27.890 --> 02:31:29.970
like I like when those,
what does that show?
When they would,

2412
02:31:30.360 --> 02:31:31.650
they would move member,

2413
02:31:33.100 --> 02:31:36.870
not house hunters international and they were like,

2414
02:31:37.050 --> 02:31:42.050
we live in Nashville and a 7,000 square foot and we're moving our six kids to

2415
02:31:42.541 --> 02:31:46.140
Belgium and then they'd be like,
here's the apartment is 350 square feet.

2416
02:31:46.530 --> 02:31:49.440
Good luck.
And the kitchen is in the toilet.

2417
02:31:50.350 --> 02:31:51.960
You have to cook your shit in the toilet cook here.

2418
02:31:51.961 --> 02:31:56.100
You can also iron right next to the fridge has an iron on it.
They're like,
no,

2419
02:31:56.490 --> 02:31:59.630
I can't take it.
I want to be Fed Little Cup

2420
02:31:59.650 --> 02:32:00.483
<v 7>of ice</v>

2421
02:32:02.590 --> 02:32:05.110
[inaudible] 78

2422
02:32:11.200 --> 02:32:13.640
<v 11>I'll like be be honest here in a hotel room</v>

2423
02:32:17.480 --> 02:32:21.250
to be hot chicken.
So we always cold.
So where am I met?

2424
02:32:21.270 --> 02:32:24.020
I want to think I'm at a warm climate.
You know that fucking psycho.

2425
02:32:24.021 --> 02:32:25.910
You met in the hall.
We can tee shirt on.

2426
02:32:26.570 --> 02:32:31.570
That dude literally will turn heat off in the winter and just live in the cold.

2427
02:32:33.400 --> 02:32:37.170
That's white people.
Shit.
You know who else it is though?

2428
02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:39.890
It's not just white people shit.
It's serial killer shit.

2429
02:32:43.360 --> 02:32:45.590
Motherfucking muffling Arctic Arctic blast.

2430
02:32:46.170 --> 02:32:47.490
And these motherfuckers was still out.

2431
02:32:48.470 --> 02:32:49.303
<v 7>Shit.</v>

2432
02:32:50.820 --> 02:32:54.310
Like one day you'll see somebody like that

2433
02:32:54.380 --> 02:32:56.750
<v 11>Michigan game,
like you know,
shirtless</v>

2434
02:32:58.360 --> 02:32:59.440
out of your fucking mind.

2435
02:32:59.530 --> 02:33:03.760
<v 7>I feel the same way when I see maniacs jogging and it's pouring rain here in la.</v>

2436
02:33:03.761 --> 02:33:08.290
I'm like really like a Douche bag asshole.
You know what I'm saying?
Motherfucker.

2437
02:33:08.380 --> 02:33:10.690
He knows I'm up.
I'm going to want to work out anyway.

2438
02:33:11.020 --> 02:33:13.890
Are you trying to tell me it's 20 degrees below zero.
You just go and run.

2439
02:33:16.110 --> 02:33:19.030
I'm doing my thing.
Can you think that bad mother

2440
02:33:19.150 --> 02:33:21.910
<v 11>fucker we opened with you think he's a out there doing that shit.</v>

2441
02:33:22.120 --> 02:33:23.550
You know what the cool facial hair?

2442
02:33:23.800 --> 02:33:26.420
<v 7>No.
Hell no man.
Mother fucker.</v>

2443
02:33:26.500 --> 02:33:29.930
He wanted them mother fuckers that bought one of those.
Um,

2444
02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:37.140
and then he goes have a cadaver.

2445
02:33:44.650 --> 02:33:49.000
<v 11>You're jerking off.
Oh Danny.
Whereas any,</v>

2446
02:33:49.001 --> 02:33:53.050
any big show,
any showed you want to plug anything?
I got a lot of stuff going on.

2447
02:33:53.051 --> 02:33:57.570
I mean I just really finished my new album stuff.
Just I've done so much,

2448
02:33:57.571 --> 02:34:00.690
it's still so fresh.
I can't really talk about stuff.
Which kinda sucks.

2449
02:34:00.691 --> 02:34:03.330
