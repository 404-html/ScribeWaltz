00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.080
I think he isn't he a designer or are you thinking,
oh no,
inherited this money.

144
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:00.520
Yeah,

145
00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.780
<v 0>I don't,
I,
I googled him and it said like,</v>

146
00:11:04.781 --> 00:11:09.400
he's a lifestyle guy.
Like I don't know what that's supposed to be.

147
00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:14.670
Doesn't that mean a swinger?
Basically style.
Okay.

148
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.720
Sounds like a lifestyler Luca.

149
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:22.390
Jesus Christ has taken the world by storm since dancing his way onto the scene

150
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.100
in a now viral video with his wife,
Georgia.
Gabriella,

151
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.650
shut up.
What do we know about him?
Well,

152
00:11:29.651 --> 00:11:32.440
aside from the fact that he's friends with Zac Efron yeah,

153
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:37.550
the handsome Italian tycoon heads up the manufacturing company and he a,

154
00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:41.230
um,
but he's also a big fan of Instagram.

155
00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:46.090
He uses to showcase everything from all his,
you know,
activities to pajamas.

156
00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.780
So here's everything you need to know.
Well,
it says that he's,

157
00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.280
he's really good friends with Ron.
That's really funny.
Um,

158
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:58.930
they enjoyed shirtless horseback rides,
um,
back in the day.
Okay.

159
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:04.510
Here's a video of him riding a moped underwater.
Remember that?
Yeah.

160
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.690
And he's like,
this is a throwback from 2000 to 13,

161
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.430
and there is a lot of posts of him and Zach Efron.
Really?
Yeah.

162
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:16.780
They had to go deeper on this guy.
I mean,
I could only handle so much.

163
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.530
I felt the vomit rising about few scrolls down.

164
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:26.770
Get your life him.
Um,

165
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:31.240
I dunno.
It's so funny.
He's diving off a yachts.

166
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.680
Here's him and Zach again.

167
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.970
<v 6>Oh
God damn it.</v>

168
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:41.883
Oh No.

169
00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.980
<v 0>Can I go over and over?
He's a lifestyle group.
I don't know what that means.</v>

170
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:49.880
I don't know either.
When you branded your lifestyle,
you're onto something,
right?

171
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:54.210
I don't know.
I guess it's like the way he presents himself.
Yeah.

172
00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:58.400
And then that's it.
His,
his quote brand,
this is,
is this Douche bag image,

173
00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:02.390
but all he's doing is like,
to me when you say I have my lifestyle is,

174
00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:06.680
is like over the top luxury and decadence.
It's not really,
like,

175
00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.060
that's not,
I don't know if that's something to say.

176
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.570
You're just saying I have a ton of money.
Yeah.

177
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.750
<v 3>You mean a show off?
Yeah.
It's showing,
you know,</v>

178
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.080
and can I tell you what really bothers me about people like this is like,
okay,

179
00:13:17.081 --> 00:13:20.460
I get it.
You're,
you're having fun every day.
Every day's a party.
Yeah.

180
00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.520
And then he'll put a post of like,
you haters can,
hey,

181
00:13:24.521 --> 00:13:26.290
but I'm loving my life.
It's like,

182
00:13:26.291 --> 00:13:28.810
well you're kind of baiting people cause you're like nanny,

183
00:13:28.811 --> 00:13:30.610
nanny poopoo look how great my life is.

184
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.690
And then when people shit on you for being a douchebag,

185
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.670
you're like all don't be a hater.
You're baiting.

186
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.430
You always have the defense of you're just hating.
Right.

187
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.710
Which of course we are if you're shitting on him,

188
00:13:41.711 --> 00:13:43.810
but you're baiting it cause you're telling me,

189
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:45.920
<v 0>yeah,
sure.
You know,</v>

190
00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:49.810
I mean there's something really tacky about showing how much money you have.

191
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.740
It's totally tacky.
It's,
yeah.
Yeah.

192
00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.260
I mean you see it a lot like Floyd Mayweather does that,
you know,

193
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:59.410
he's a slow clap.
Look Glasgow's money,
actual money.

194
00:13:59.411 --> 00:14:01.330
That's money I got man,

195
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.350
like videos and like it just stacks and stacks and he's like,

196
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.970
I'm just counting money today.
It's Saturday.
Okay.
I mean that's kind of boring,

197
00:14:09.971 --> 00:14:14.740
right?
Yeah.
This isn't boring.
No.
Is He for real?

198
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:15.940
This dude is

199
00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.390
<v 6>Danny on a motorcycle.
Oh my God.</v>

200
00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.390
Really?
Wow Man.

201
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.420
So sorry.

202
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:33.490
<v 0>Standing on a motorbike for those youth.
He can dance
dancer.</v>

203
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.450
We know the dance part.
Um,
uh,
dancing again.

204
00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.070
Yeah.
I still,

205
00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.580
I mean I guess he runs that company that I don't know what that company is.
Yeah.

206
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:44.620
But um,

207
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:50.590
it's kind of interesting that somebody is that well known,

208
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.190
got so many followers

209
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:55.040
<v 3>and you really don't know what he really,
what he does.
Yeah.</v>

210
00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:57.320
I know he's all over the top.
You know who I like.

211
00:14:57.321 --> 00:14:59.780
Who did it cool was like Richard Branson.

212
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:03.860
He would kind of be over the top but in a cool way.

213
00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:07.900
Like there was a photograph of him,
um,
what's that called?

214
00:15:07.901 --> 00:15:12.740
Waterskiing with like a naked model strapped to him.
That's eccentric,

215
00:15:12.741 --> 00:15:15.410
but interesting.
Like,
oh wow.
That's really bizarre.
Well,

216
00:15:15.411 --> 00:15:18.980
I think the other thing of its kind of annoying about this dude is that this

217
00:15:18.981 --> 00:15:22.790
stuff seems very calculated.
Yeah.
That's really,
yeah.

218
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:26.000
Maybe that's like not very authentic.
Yeah.
He's just like,
look at me.

219
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:31.830
Very set up.
Yeah.
You know,
this is a move from a Danson.

220
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:37.560
Okay,
well enough of him.
Let's get back to this lady now.

221
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.520
I feel like this is the lady that did the coffee.
Yes.

222
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:44.600
This is the coffee enema lady heard her hair's a little longer.
Yeah,
but she's,

223
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:47.840
she's given us the new business here.
Yeah.
Man,

224
00:15:47.841 --> 00:15:51.120
this is a really exciting stuff.
Um,

225
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:56.900
let's see.
We,
we,
we haven't had her in a while.
Let's see what she says here.

226
00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:02.760
<v 7>Hello.
Everybody Ran Florence.
Welcome to my channel.
Well,</v>

227
00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:05.780
today is all about gargling with urine.

228
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:10.840
<v 3>Okay.
All right.
What's happening?
This kind of Shit,
you know,</v>

229
00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.450
I feel like I could see you going down this path.
I know.
Yeah,

230
00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:17.270
I can see you being like,
you gotta try it bad.
I am.
I am.

231
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:22.500
<v 7>One lot of people have read one dog away.
Am I still practicing?</v>

232
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.520
You're in therapy therapy?
No,
I'm not.

233
00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:28.770
I plan to start again.

234
00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:32.760
I can just start again because I have a cold.

235
00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:37.770
<v 3>Oh,
okay.
Okay.</v>

236
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.480
She calls a year in therapy that her whole,
her,
she needs hosting classes.

237
00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:46.860
Right.
The whole introduction to that.
Like have I been doing this?
No.

238
00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:51.900
But will lie.
I am plan to because I have a cold.

239
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:55.190
Like what the fuck is wrong with you?
You're so natural.
Yeah.

240
00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:59.930
And she's also very sickly.
She needs to drink a little more urine because yeah.

241
00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.670
Or a little more than urine I think.
Right?
Yeah.

242
00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.300
How come they are Vbl that advocate?
All these wacky things.

243
00:17:06.301 --> 00:17:10.560
They always look like you're dying.
Yeah.
Well
it's not good.

244
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.670
Not a lot of not good going on with that coffee enemas and the p drinking.

245
00:17:14.671 --> 00:17:19.380
I don't know why people have to sign up for,
for doing,

246
00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.870
for drinking urine as if there's,
you know,

247
00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.450
there's a lot of other things you can do.
You can detox,

248
00:17:24.451 --> 00:17:28.740
you can do kind of fast and you can do all kinds of shit and you got to you to

249
00:17:28.741 --> 00:17:30.930
go like,
you know,
I'm gonna drink my own pissed.
Like,

250
00:17:30.931 --> 00:17:33.360
why you have to take it there.
Well,
I'll tell you this,

251
00:17:33.361 --> 00:17:37.280
I do know that you're in therapy works for cancer patients,
but that,

252
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.280
but there is no medical evidence to show that.
No,
no medical.
Of course not.

253
00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:44.910
But uh,
but just to make it clear,
people have,

254
00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.010
have done it who have cancer.

255
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.810
The medical world does not support it as a treatment.
I'm sure.
Yeah,
I know.

256
00:17:51.811 --> 00:17:54.480
But do you do feel like I'm one step away from that right.

257
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.450
Hundred for 10 years I'm going to be like Tom,

258
00:17:57.451 --> 00:18:01.420
we have to do the urine colonic.
I'll,

259
00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:05.160
it'll be something like I'll have like a sinus infection and then you'll be
like,

260
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:05.821
you know,

261
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:10.630
I don't have one and I kind of really wish you would give it a try.

262
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.700
It's really changed things for me and I'll go like,
I don't want to drink,

263
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.340
I don't want to drink any piss.
And you'll be like,

264
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.890
well it's not as bad as you think it would like that.

265
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.720
Well cause I'm into meditation.

266
00:18:21.721 --> 00:18:26.721
We know that in the new house they plan on building a meditation hut for me a

267
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.210
year.
But that's really where it stops.

268
00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:34.110
I drink my smoothies in the morning with Kale and spinach and carrots.

269
00:18:34.111 --> 00:18:38.600
That's fine.
Uh,
but I feel like that's the boundary right now.
As of now.
Yeah.

270
00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:42.600
I have some new age crystals that were given to me.
I don't buy them.

271
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:46.290
Let's see where else this goes.
But I could,
can I have some your coffee?

272
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:50.180
I got so much water here.
I usually don't have coffee,
but May.

273
00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.850
May I borrow some of your dirty brown liquid to drink?
God dammit.

274
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:58.080
Why is this not going over?
I guess because I'm a dad.

275
00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:04.140
<v 7>You're in has
toxic,
right?
Basically,</v>

276
00:19:04.141 --> 00:19:06.150
whatever's going on in your body.

277
00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:13.810
So your body does have antibodies that can fight off this illness.

278
00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.080
And if you take a little swig,

279
00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:24.080
<v 3>no,
you're a liar.
What if it,
if,</v>

280
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:26.980
if what's on your PP is the bad stuff,

281
00:19:26.981 --> 00:19:30.610
the ammonia and the toxins that your body has flushed out,

282
00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:35.630
then isn't it logical?
You shouldn't be reintroducing that back in nearby.

283
00:19:35.631 --> 00:19:38.740
If you're close minded,
fucking 18th century person.
Yeah,

284
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:43.890
but if you're welcome the
loser,

285
00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:45.860
drink your pants already

286
00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:49.263
<v 7>first time.</v>

287
00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:56.550
<v 3>Oh God.
That made me fucking gag in my mouth.</v>

288
00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.640
I don't know what her fucking problem is.

289
00:19:59.641 --> 00:20:03.310
And also can we do a little different audio set up for her?
Well,
look,

290
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.830
as we all know,
these youtube audio quality's Piss poor at the background.

291
00:20:07.831 --> 00:20:09.870
She's against a mirror and then a dirty room.

292
00:20:09.871 --> 00:20:13.950
It's like the sheets on her floor and you heard all this background noise.

293
00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:18.630
We need a tutorial for these youtubers to make decent videos.

294
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.570
Sound quality.
The music usually bad.

295
00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:25.960
Why doesn't this go over when I click it?
Why is this thing here?

296
00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.190
Okay.
All right.

297
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:34.490
<v 7>There you go.
So this is</v>

298
00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:40.630
what I do is I sleep in the 10 at night.
And so what

299
00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:43.973
I hear,

300
00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:47.830
<v 3>okay,
what I is,</v>

301
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:52.860
I sleep in a tent at night and so there are mosquitoes here and so I urinate in

302
00:20:54.281 --> 00:20:57.410
a container like this overnight.

303
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:05.680
I don't know why she sleeps in a tent when there's a bed behind her.

304
00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:08.110
I know she has a cold.
She was like,

305
00:21:08.111 --> 00:21:11.620
I'm going to take it outside while the sheets are ripped off.

306
00:21:11.621 --> 00:21:13.450
They're down here in a pile.
Oh,

307
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:19.080
what the fuck is wrong with sleeping her team and not only she outdoors in her

308
00:21:19.781 --> 00:21:23.370
tent but that throughout the night.
This is overnight.

309
00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:27.960
It's not like I'm going to pee real quick to do this.

310
00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.940
This is what I pissed last night.

311
00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:35.280
Like I wouldn't even drink water that's been sitting out overnight cause it's

312
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:40.730
right.
You guys are.
Why
wait?
I like French.
She goes babe,
she goes,

313
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:46.270
I peed in this 10 like even she can't believe it on some level I've been paying

314
00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:50.790
and the mud from my tent.

315
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.820
There are mosquitoes here.

316
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:03.850
She can't even point to it.
Yeah,
she's going to drink it.

317
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.060
You have to let it separate.
I've read about this though.
The year end drinking.

318
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:13.470
You have to let,
only if you take a normal sip,

319
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.480
don't show boat and Chug it.
Cause this is my water supply for this entire,

320
00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:22.350
this is my water supply for the entire show and I'm going to mark it.
Don't,

321
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:27.810
don't be a jerk.
There's an ant in here.
All right,
I'll drink the fucking head.

322
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:32.220
Please don't show boat and pretend you are a big showboater.

323
00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:33.923
<v 6>Okay,</v>

324
00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:40.390
<v 3>that's a sip.
Oh Bullshit.
That's a sip for my Yorkie sips.</v>

325
00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:44.410
I'm a,
I'm a marathon drinker.
We did drink the aunt.

326
00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.113
<v 6>I pee</v>

327
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:56.510
<v 3>in the t and
m in the Tan.</v>

328
00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:01.700
What the fuck
you remember?
Um,

329
00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:06.430
do you ever go to Europe and they would have the pots next to the bed.
The p,

330
00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:10.100
the piss pots.
My,
I used to do it.
Why not know?

331
00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.930
Even when she come to visit us and America would pes and like,
uh,

332
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:16.850
what's it called?
A night pan.
What?
Yeah,

333
00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.610
what do you mean she would piss enough fucking night?

334
00:23:19.611 --> 00:23:21.830
They're called night pans and we keep them by the bed.

335
00:23:21.831 --> 00:23:26.200
It's European styles and you piss in the pan.
And then I swore to God,

336
00:23:26.201 --> 00:23:28.850
did you go to the bathroom because she's fucking old country.

337
00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:33.650
You guys from Hungary?
Of course we would.
My father was like,
what are you doing?

338
00:23:33.651 --> 00:23:37.820
This is totally fucked up.
And she would just still,
I like it this way,

339
00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:41.060
but she would also wear a wet bathing suit and sit in the kitchen.

340
00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:44.510
And in the summertime,
disgusting story.
Of course.

341
00:23:44.511 --> 00:23:47.770
I don't know if did a number two in the night bucket,

342
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:51.740
but she wouldn't piss in it,
but wouldn't it five feet from the toilet.
I mean,

343
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:53.780
we lived in doors with indoor plumbing.

344
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.430
There was a turtle that right next to her,

345
00:23:55.431 --> 00:23:57.920
but she preferred the piss in the rooms.
Just sleep in a tent.

346
00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:03.230
She did actually and the summertime we had a tent and she was living in the

347
00:24:03.231 --> 00:24:07.130
backyard.
My none.
I did provide for the tent.
Why?
Because it was cool.

348
00:24:07.131 --> 00:24:11.840
It's cooler outside.
In the summertime you're not as fucking,
she's dead.

349
00:24:11.841 --> 00:24:15.050
But when my father was too cheap to run the air conditioning at night,

350
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.080
so my Nana would sleep in the backyard in a attend and Canoga Park.

351
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:23.900
I know.
I know.
Fuck man.
This is what we talked about this on the,

352
00:24:23.901 --> 00:24:28.550
I believe the Patriot episode is how running the AC as a sign of having money

353
00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:32.720
when you're like,
I didn't get false,
but $100 a month one air conditioning.

354
00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.930
That's true.
Now my dad,
he got the swamp cooler,

355
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:41.270
so the whole place was damp.
Agree.
This way it's kind of warm.

356
00:24:41.271 --> 00:24:46.270
Is it would be like one degree down.
He'd be like,
dude,
I mean,

357
00:24:46.271 --> 00:24:50.410
so we're open and close the door.
All right.
There's to drain out,
right?

358
00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:54.380
You don't pay this bill.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
My parents the same way I closed the door,

359
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:59.180
the air conditioning is on.
Well,
I mean,
some of it's going to leak,
bro.

360
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.600
I know if I can relax,
but at no,
at nighttime,

361
00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:06.320
my dad would just make us sweat in the valley.
Dude.

362
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:08.600
Fucking hot as balls Canoga Park.

363
00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:13.070
And as the same time that the night stalker was going around climate into kids'

364
00:25:13.071 --> 00:25:14.540
rooms and stealing them and shit.

365
00:25:14.541 --> 00:25:19.541
So I was all scared of that except our windows open when fucking night stalker

366
00:25:20.001 --> 00:25:23.510
was out.
Really?
Hell yeah.
I'm scared of that.
And my dad was so cheap.

367
00:25:23.511 --> 00:25:25.820
He would rather me get stolen by the night Stalker Dolan.

368
00:25:25.821 --> 00:25:29.510
You've been killed right then he wasn't into stealing.

369
00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:36.890
Yeah.
Yeah.
He was like,
well,
I'm a big deal that's on the,
yeah,

370
00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.440
that's okay.
No big deal.
I'll find it like you love it.

371
00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:45.110
There's hot nights men hot as balls and he was just run a fan.
No,

372
00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:49.160
we didn't even have fans in this house.
What?
Why not?
You mean overhead now?

373
00:25:49.161 --> 00:25:52.890
My father had like some kind of stand up bullshit like you sleep with a,

374
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:53.833
but that was it.

375
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:58.190
And we'd have to just like sweat it out until he married my stepmom who was
like,

376
00:25:58.191 --> 00:26:00.020
if I don't,
you'll have air conditioning.

377
00:26:00.021 --> 00:26:03.980
And then he got the swamp cooler and then the swamp cooler made everything down.

378
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:07.460
So you wake up,
it's the morning and it was just damp.
The carpet was all dark,

379
00:26:07.461 --> 00:26:09.890
like wet and cold.
And then she was like,

380
00:26:09.891 --> 00:26:11.750
how about we get some real air conditioning?
Nope.

381
00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:13.190
She just settled on the swamp cooler.

382
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.710
That was as far as she could push him because he was cheap.

383
00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:20.150
And then eventually the next house,
the house he lives in now has ac.

384
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:23.900
That was the first house that had ac for him when I went to college.

385
00:26:23.901 --> 00:26:27.370
He moved into that Nice House.
So that was like,
so he was 50 when he got Eric.

386
00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:31.700
What the fuck?
Yeah,
that's real crazy.
That's fucking old school.

387
00:26:31.701 --> 00:26:34.370
Hungarian kidding me.
There was a kid,

388
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:38.570
the only thing that I could take it further than that was in high school,

389
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:42.860
I went to this,
a buddy of mine,
we went to this other kid's place,

390
00:26:42.861 --> 00:26:44.130
the lived in Melbourne,
which

391
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.140
<v 0>is,
uh,
in,
in Florida,</v>

392
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:51.300
like little north of where I was in school and he was summers,
you know,

393
00:26:51.301 --> 00:26:55.110
it's so humid in Florida,
right?
And like swamp man,

394
00:26:55.111 --> 00:26:59.970
it's like at night it's full.
100% humidity.
So you're just dying.

395
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:03.570
And we get in this kid's house and you know,
it's like a Saturday night.

396
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:07.730
So we're just hanging out drinking and we're going to crash there.
Well,

397
00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.820
I'll walk in and I'm like,
dude is fucking brutal in here.

398
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.850
Why is it so hot?
Well,

399
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:19.620
he's half is half Vietnamese moms,
Vietnamese,
Dad's American.
He goes,

400
00:27:19.621 --> 00:27:23.580
my dad just likes it to be more like Vietnam.

401
00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:29.670
I go
and he goes,
he just,
he loves Vietnam.

402
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.550
He loves everything about it,
the culture and everything.

403
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:38.030
So he doesn't like to run any AC.
And I'm like,
oh my God,
I just turned them off.

404
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.790
I go,
I think,
I don't think I can crash here.
And I mean,
I was like,

405
00:27:41.791 --> 00:27:45.130
this is fucking it first and only time I've ever,
anybody likes,

406
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:49.830
I went into trailer parks where you go in the trailer and they have 60 degree ac

407
00:27:49.831 --> 00:27:53.610
in there and I go,
do we,
I don't think I can crash here.
And he goes,
well we have,

408
00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:57.690
we do have a unit in the um,
like the guests.

409
00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.420
There's like a guest house thing here.
You could stay there and go,
yeah,

410
00:28:00.421 --> 00:28:03.990
that's where I'm standing.
And I go in there and I'm,

411
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:08.690
I guess the fan on and I'm just like,
it's a ceiling fan.
And I,

412
00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.430
I pass out,
I just pass out and I wake up,

413
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.250
the ceiling fan broke,

414
00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:19.560
you'll the night pieces of it everywhere and the kid turned on the heat instead

415
00:28:20.791 --> 00:28:24.420
of the AC.
So I accidentally had the heat cranked.
What a dope.

416
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:29.480
So it was 105 and broken pieces of a ceiling fan on me.

417
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.870
Oh my God.
That was dangerous.
I know.
Yeah.

418
00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:36.150
My Mother didn't run the AC open the windows.

419
00:28:36.151 --> 00:28:39.630
We lived in an apartment complex and so you could hear everybody like this drunk

420
00:28:39.631 --> 00:28:43.920
woman and cry,
just open,

421
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:47.940
open the window and I have to sweat it out on the sheets on top of the sheet has

422
00:28:47.941 --> 00:28:52.380
kids too.
We're back.
So it was in $1,000 on this whole thing like,

423
00:28:52.381 --> 00:28:53.870
is that why we're not doing this?

424
00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:59.160
When you and I got together and we lived on Carondelet and he would run the AC

425
00:28:59.161 --> 00:29:03.180
all summer.
I thought it was the most extravagant thing I had ever seen.

426
00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:08.400
Yeah,
you go just fucking let it run all day and all night.
And I was like,
wait,

427
00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:12.370
what?
Yeah,
Tom,
that's going to cost us a fortune.
And

428
00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:18.770
I was like,
never turned it off.
Just let it always did.

429
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.870
And like the freon leaked and we had to get it replaced or whatever.

430
00:29:21.871 --> 00:29:24.840
But that's the only thing that sucks about living in like a poor.
Oh,

431
00:29:24.841 --> 00:29:25.674
there's a lot of things.

432
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.590
But one of the things that sucks about living in a Shitty,

433
00:29:28.591 --> 00:29:33.240
poor building is when the freon ran out.

434
00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:34.051
Right?

435
00:29:34.051 --> 00:29:37.900
So all of a sudden one day the air's running and there's warm air coming out.

436
00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.800
You're like,
oh,
and we call that guy down.

437
00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:48.640
<v 3>He's like,
it's not so cool air coming out.
That's why I fucking called you down.</v>

438
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:55.210
That's why you're here.
And he's like,
yeah,

439
00:29:55.211 --> 00:29:59.470
it's not going to be cool at all.
Right?
It's like,
so you need,

440
00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:04.210
you need free on it and make it cooler.
Gary and I go,
okay,

441
00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:09.370
this is like Saturday,
let's say.
He's like,
yeah.
He goes,

442
00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:14.710
all right,
well,
okay.
I had the guy come out Wednesday.
I go,
no,
no,
no.

443
00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:20.020
It's uh,
it's,
you know,
it's too long.
We got it.
We got to have him come out today,

444
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:24.460
tomorrow.
And he goes,
no,
he comes on Wednesdays and that was it.

445
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:28.270
He was like,
okay,
you call another guy.
Nah,
this is the guy.

446
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:33.040
And that was it.
There was no negotiation.
We were stuck there for five days.

447
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:37.390
Like this
downtown La Cooking.
Cooking man.

448
00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:42.130
Yeah.
That was a weird apartment.
And then sometimes one time we went for a trip.

449
00:30:42.131 --> 00:30:45.970
We came back,
the shower was just running full blast hot.

450
00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:49.740
It had been running for days.
Just hot foam last water.
Right.

451
00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:53.200
I know I didn't leave this shit on the turnout in itself.
No.

452
00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.510
Plumbing's wacky and it turn itself.

453
00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:01.150
If someone came in there to fix it and left it running.
Yeah.

454
00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:03.910
Hi there.
A common thread.

455
00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:09.490
That was the other thing is when the sink was clogged up.
Yeah,
no it was the,

456
00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.400
it was the,
the tub.
So you're spending and take a shower,

457
00:31:12.401 --> 00:31:14.490
you know you're standing in like three inches of water.

458
00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:18.370
You're like this is disgusting.
So after awhile we call him,
he goes yeah,

459
00:31:18.371 --> 00:31:22.070
it's all backed up.
And that's why the water is not going down.
No,

460
00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:26.050
he came over because the sink,
it was the sink.
No,
I thought it was the tub.

461
00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:28.380
So maybe you weren't there that time cause he,

462
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.970
that's the first time I noticed that Jose wasn't,

463
00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:34.960
there was a couple of screws loose cause he kept saying like the elementary,

464
00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:40.390
you see what happened here is the clogs still does champion.

465
00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:47.860
That's Obama is the president here now.
He made this announcement.

466
00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:51.250
He was talking about Trump this week and he was like,

467
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:55.790
somebody asked him and then he just goes,
you know champion.
Yeah,

468
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:57.430
I knew I loved Obama.

469
00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:02.770
It's so weird he didn't mention that he's,
he made that for me.

470
00:32:02.771 --> 00:32:04.330
That's really nice.
Thank you president.
What?

471
00:32:04.331 --> 00:32:08.440
You just said it in a press conference.
Wow.
Whoa,

472
00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.760
Whoa,
whoa.
Wait a minute.
I don't know about that.

473
00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:14.010
You must have heard you say that.

474
00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:20.980
I repeated it cause it was part of the show.
He just wanted to say that one day

475
00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:27.120
the preacher said that and I thought it was absurd.
That wasn't the matcher.
No,

476
00:32:27.121 --> 00:32:30.660
it was a half ounce or half ounce.
Yeah.

477
00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:36.000
God does not say that word.
God does not drop any bombs.

478
00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:39.270
Yeah.
Yeah.
God bless Nigga.

479
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.070
So dumb.
Yeah.
God blesses a naked.

480
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:53.150
Yeah.
I'm drawing big tits on drafting.

481
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:59.090
God is real.
God blesses a Nigga.
Oh my God.
I mean,
it's right here.

482
00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:02.270
I said that like years ago and there's still punishing me from,

483
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:07.370
oh here's by the way,
I couldn't fucking find this last week.
God dammit.

484
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:17.083
God dammit.

485
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.430
I'm licking your balls or your penis or anus or something.
Go ahead.

486
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:27.380
Go ahead.
I love the beacon for shyness.
Okay.

487
00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:31.730
Anyways,
go back to what you were saying.

488
00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:36.110
So that's the first time I noticed Jose wasn't that bright because he kept

489
00:33:36.111 --> 00:33:36.820
explaining.
He goes,

490
00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:41.820
zoo will happen is it will drain is clogged and the water won't go down.

491
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:46.700
Yeah,
that's what he said about the tub.
It's clogged up.
And I was like,
yeah,

492
00:33:46.701 --> 00:33:48.770
I did.
Yeah,
yeah bro.

493
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:53.860
I'm going to have to put a snake in the pull everything out so then the water

494
00:33:55.311 --> 00:33:59.830
will go down.
Thanks.
Could you get on that?
Because I'm like,
yeah,

495
00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:03.140
cause I'm standing in it.
I'm always standing in it and he's like,
yeah,

496
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:06.710
it's because it's backed up more drain.
Yup.

497
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:11.390
And that it's not going to go down until I do this.

498
00:34:11.391 --> 00:34:15.920
So I know now he,
he and his wife Linda Sweet people,

499
00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:18.390
Linda was,
she had,

500
00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.590
I love it.

501
00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:24.860
And she'd come over and I'd had just made spanakopita from trader's Joe.
Yeah.

502
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:28.580
And she would eat half the tray.
She would,
she was a tiny woman.
So I let her,

503
00:34:28.581 --> 00:34:30.120
I'm like,
gosh,
she needs to eat more than I do.

504
00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:34.550
But I went to their apartment one time on the first floor and it was an exact

505
00:34:34.551 --> 00:34:37.940
replica of ours.
The layout,
except they were clean,

506
00:34:37.941 --> 00:34:41.720
super clean and they had trails like liner trails,

507
00:34:41.721 --> 00:34:45.560
like plastic.
I oles you know what I'm talking about?

508
00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:49.430
That's a real immigrant thing too,
to have like a pathway of plastic.

509
00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:54.190
I put Hosanna horse deck on him.
Yes,
I bet he did.
I bet he did.
Yes,

510
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:59.200
we should call Mary.
Oh,
she's like,
yeah,
Mario and I get married.

511
00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:01.430
He goes,
it's a pet name if I,
his cat,

512
00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:07.520
he had a long order break cause he has a Puerto Rican guy and he had a long

513
00:35:07.521 --> 00:35:11.090
ponytail.
My really long real for him.
I remember one time he goes,

514
00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.300
hey Tom got a ball you so bad.

515
00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:20.630
I go,
what the fuck is that?
It's a bag full of soup.

516
00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:24.860
And I go,
Oh yeah.
I was like,
I'm having to tell him what that's called.

517
00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:30.470
Did you know what is that called?
The garment bag.
But I mean,
I was like,

518
00:35:30.471 --> 00:35:35.180
what's a suit bag?
At first I thought he was saying soup bag,
right?
And I just,

519
00:35:35.181 --> 00:35:37.100
I was like,
I don't think I have that man.

520
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:40.750
I asked him like had he had to say it five times?
Yeah.
Well,

521
00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:44.630
so I really liked them though and I will say once,
once Hosanna,

522
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.360
Linda left the building went down,
then these fucking dirt bag,

523
00:35:48.361 --> 00:35:50.880
Russians brought it,
fucking bought it.

524
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:54.970
The scumbag brewskies came and then the building went down and that's when we of

525
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:55.833
the about this.

526
00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:59.910
Some people will know if you live in cities and you've moved from a Shitty

527
00:35:59.911 --> 00:36:01.500
neighborhood to just a better one.

528
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.920
The first phone call you get that you don't expect is a for car insurance.

529
00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.820
Your car insurance goes way down.
Way down.

530
00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:16.800
We moved to a good neighborhood from a bad neighborhood and I had thought about

531
00:36:16.801 --> 00:36:20.760
it.
I,
I was talking to our insurance one day after we moved and they were like,

532
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:25.740
Oh yeah,
your payment is now half and you're getting a refund.

533
00:36:25.741 --> 00:36:28.770
Because I didn't tell him we'd move.
You're going to get like a $600 I was like,

534
00:36:28.771 --> 00:36:33.600
what?
Why?
And they're like,
well you moved from like a horrible neighborhood.
Uh,

535
00:36:33.601 --> 00:36:37.470
where a car jacking sacrifice all the time to a decent neighborhood.
I was like,

536
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:41.220
oh this is great.
We just kind of scream.
Of course if you think of it,

537
00:36:41.221 --> 00:36:43.200
cause if you're poor or more poor,

538
00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:48.180
you are not going to get the insurance sucks.
Uh,

539
00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.870
wha what are Carter,

having to go to a hospital and be hooked up to an IME.

543
00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:14.510
<v 3>It sounds pretty sanitary.

Sure.</v>

544
00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:16.800

545
00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:19.490

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:34.680

She's drinking it.

549
00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:39.210
Oh my fuck.

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:42.500

551
00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:46.410
I think I threw up a little bit.

552
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:52.660
<v 3>No it doesn't boob.
She almost vomited</v>

553
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:56.820

<v 7>salient good</v>

555
00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:02.680

<v 3>Yes.</v>

557
00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:12.330
<v 7>See how it does for my cough a couple more times.</v>

558
00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:15.590
Please don't go out there so that

559
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:20.810
if you're struggling with allergies.

560
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:23.980
<v 3>Okay.
All right.
I don't want to see,</v>

561
00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:27.830
there's this stuff called Robitussin to you can just go to the rite aid and pick

562
00:38:27.831 --> 00:38:31.070
that up.
It doesn't taste like urine.
Tastes like Cherry.
It's good.

563
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:37.930
Did you see her almost who?
Yeah.
She was like,
was it good?

564
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.461
<v 8>Listen man,</v>

565
00:38:39.461 --> 00:38:44.050
I had to make this video because too many niggas is talking against the beauty

566
00:38:44.051 --> 00:38:49.051
of e and s with all these dumb ass arguments about your shit in there.

567
00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:53.210
It isn't that man.
I think if you could eat pussy,
Yuki,

568
00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:57.610
e s e n asses right around the corner like right around the corner from me.

569
00:38:57.611 --> 00:39:01.360
So later.
Yeah,
you can go one place.
You could go to the next door neighbor.

570
00:39:01.361 --> 00:39:02.500
It's not that hard.

571
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:05.140
<v 3>Good point.
Yeah.
Actually,
let's see.
I was going to,
this is more for you.</v>

572
00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:09.200
I think that you're right down there.
Yeah.
Wait me.
Yeah,

573
00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.610
Yeah Babe.
No,
it's the same argument in different parts,

574
00:39:12.611 --> 00:39:16.180
but it's the same argument.
Babies,
am I eating pussy?
Is that timeout second deck.

575
00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:20.230
But I'm,
but I'm saying you could interchange that.
Absolutely not.
Absolutely not.

576
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:23.770
Why that my anatomy is significantly different than yours.

577
00:39:23.771 --> 00:39:25.060
I don't know if you know that what I'm saying.

578
00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:27.690
It's the same thing as the district.
Do you think it's right around the corner?

579
00:39:27.691 --> 00:39:31.660
No.
No it is not.
Your Dick is far,
far,

580
00:39:31.661 --> 00:39:33.790
far from your butthole.
No,
it's not a ball.

581
00:39:33.791 --> 00:39:38.680
Separate the Dick from the bottle for a reason because my mouth wasn't supposed

582
00:39:38.681 --> 00:39:41.740
to go there.
Thank you.
Yeah.
That's a case.
Horrible argument.
Come on.

583
00:39:41.741 --> 00:39:44.710
The balls are the buffer so that I don't like your butthole.

584
00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.310
<v 8>I personally think like in um,</v>

585
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:51.170
biology and anatomy of God.
Yeah.
We're like,

586
00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:55.400
who's clearly mess rusty ass.
That's why I asked is fat.
You got the cushion,

587
00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:56.790
you got to look at the cushion.

588
00:39:56.791 --> 00:39:59.060
So when you put your head in there like you'd be safe.

589
00:39:59.061 --> 00:40:02.870
Like no harm could come your way while you eat and ask cause you'd be safe in

590
00:40:02.871 --> 00:40:03.710
the cheeks for me.

591
00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:07.230
<v 3>Yeah.
Cause they seem like a nice guy.
Yeah.
Like a sweet guy.</v>

592
00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:12.260
<v 0>We also got this email today as um,
um,
uh,</v>

593
00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:16.650
typing this.
We,
we,
we got this today.
I'm a huge new found fan of yours.

594
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:20.790
I heard Christina snort when she giggled and burped and thought to myself,

595
00:40:20.791 --> 00:40:25.170
this is the type of woman I want to be listening to.
Wow.
She's just so real.
Wow.

596
00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:28.290
Then,
uh,
your mom's house or who she met,
your mom says,

597
00:40:28.291 --> 00:40:32.450
I've been hooked to both your uh,
that's deep bro.
Ever since.
Um,

598
00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:35.380
<v 3>yeah.
Listen to that.
See pro guys.
Shit.
Thank you.</v>

599
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:37.290
<v 0>She,
so anyways,
lots of,</v>

600
00:40:37.291 --> 00:40:40.530
she said that I'm coming to see it to come on your comedy club next month.

601
00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:44.880
My boyfriend surprised me with tickets on my smurf day.
Uh,

602
00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:48.750
can you say he got some gray fruit and ass eating action for that?
Anyways,

603
00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:51.150
fantastic show.
Oh,
and Tom,

604
00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.910
I always heard how enjoyable ass eating is for you guys.

605
00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:58.290
I've offered it to my boyfriend many times and he keeps saying no.

606
00:40:58.291 --> 00:41:01.260
How do I convince them to say yes?
Jessica?

607
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:07.110
<v 3>First of all,
you and I were on the same page.
Yes.
Until that last,
yeah.</v>

608
00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:10.970
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure anymore.
I Dunno.
Maybe a little wife swap because uh,

609
00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.590
I mean how,

610
00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:18.870
how could this son of a bitch turn that down?
What is wrong with him?

611
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:19.690
What's you,

612
00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:23.160
what's wrong with you was what's all with all this ass stuff you want lately?

613
00:41:23.161 --> 00:41:26.460
What's going on?
What I just want,
you are like six guys.

614
00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:32.330
Uh,
I dunno man.
I Dunno.
I've just trying to get,

615
00:41:32.331 --> 00:41:36.470
can we just with a finger calling on?
Yeah.
Yeah,
let's do that.

616
00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.660
Can get you need to be patient with me.

617
00:41:38.661 --> 00:41:42.830
I feel like you always rushed me and scare me.

618
00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.280
You don't let me take my time with stuff.
That's a deal.
It's a deal.

619
00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:51.060
You got to let me get,
cause it's awfully hot around there.
Okay.

620
00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:54.980
I get scared cause it's hot.
First of all,
and smelly.

621
00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:58.880
I'm totally onboard.
When's your colonoscopy?

622
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:01.123
October.
No,

623
00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:06.520
October and the date I do because I want everyone listening to hold you to this

624
00:42:06.951 --> 00:42:09.350
one because now that we've rescheduled it so that you,

625
00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.770
the reason we rescheduled you just everybody knows he's not a chicken.

626
00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:16.100
Because I had some listeners come up to me at the comedy store and go,

627
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:18.200
all the buns isn't going to get a colonoscopy.

628
00:42:18.201 --> 00:42:22.520
He's a chicken and airy Shaffer texted you,
you know,
but look,
look,
look chicken.

629
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:25.970
It's not because of that.
It's because Tom had some tour things scheduled.

630
00:42:25.971 --> 00:42:29.750
It would and it would kind of fuck up the colonoscopy because you need time to

631
00:42:29.751 --> 00:42:32.250
do that.
It's October 27th okay.

632
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:36.990
30 am that's close to when we moved to genes.
Boy,

633
00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:41.720
you're gonna.
You have to take that drink the night before.
So 5:00 PM on,

634
00:42:41.721 --> 00:42:43.970
you're going to be shitting your brains out the night before.

635
00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:47.150
We'd postpone it because it was going to interfere with the live podcast.

636
00:42:47.151 --> 00:42:50.970
We just did.
We,
it would be today that you would have had that colonoscopy.
Yeah,

637
00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:55.070
but not only just canceling,
but it would have screwed up probably last night.

638
00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:57.950
Yeah,
so October 27th guys,

639
00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:02.360
everybody lock buttons and to this one there's no getting out.

640
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:06.680
Old me to it was,
let's help this lady out.
How did she convince?
Don't ask me.

641
00:43:06.681 --> 00:43:08.840
I don't fucking know what I would do.

642
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:12.830
I would actually use some of what Christina just said.
Baby steps,

643
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:15.050
baby steps.
If he's resistant,

644
00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:20.050
maybe you kind of ease back there some taint plague,
get some,
you know,

645
00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:24.350
kind of creep on,
creep,
creep little bit,

646
00:43:24.351 --> 00:43:28.370
little bit at a time.
Then maybe some,
you know,

647
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:33.400
just a little finger licked and kind of edge around the outside and then all of

648
00:43:35.091 --> 00:43:36.350
a sudden he's like,
oh,
he's into it.

649
00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:40.520
And then you hock a luxury in there and then you know he's,

650
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:43.790
he's so turned on by then you just bury your face in.
There you go.
Crazy.

651
00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:48.310
I disagree.
Okay.
I think that's,
this is the right way to do it.
Okay.
Tell him,

652
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:53.000
put him in on all fours.
First of all,
you put some alcohol on it.
Yeah.
Fucked up.

653
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:57.500
But that to be fucked up.
Ripped.
Just buzzed.

654
00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.060
Have a little wine,

655
00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:02.540
have some candle so that he's not embarrassed by what it looks like.

656
00:44:02.541 --> 00:44:07.040
Cause I'm sure his ass holes not as pretty as Tom.
Put Him in the dog.

657
00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:11.750
Yeah.
And to shove your face in there,
but that's not how you do that.

658
00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.760
Put him on his,
on his belly and be like,
oh,

659
00:44:13.761 --> 00:44:18.761
and I give you a massage and then put him but his knees up and then I guess do

660
00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:24.560
it that way.
Give him a rusty trombone.
Oh,
I think,

661
00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:28.310
I think you gotta slowly get into it,
but tenants a massage,
a back rub,

662
00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:32.040
and then then just shove your face in there,
I guess.
True.
Sure.

663
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:35.460
See that's what you kind of do with me.
You've always done the surprise attack.

664
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:40.390
Yeah.
You sneak attack me constantly and I'm not comfortable doing that.
Yeah.

665
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:42.620
And then you'll be like,
boom.
Yeah.

666
00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:47.300
And that's how you've tricked me into many a thing that I wasn't ready for.
Um,

667
00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:48.230
so this is the one that's right.

668
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:51.750
You're not going to address it and you just going to act like they didn't say

669
00:44:51.751 --> 00:44:55.100
any of that.
I forgot about this sneak attack.
You said,
I sneaky fag here.

670
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.980
You've sneak attack to me every time.
I'm like,
I'm not comfortable doing that.

671
00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:03.080
Then you just force it on me anyways.
That's rude.
It's true.

672
00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:08.100
That's not true.
It's true.
You sneak attack it and then I'm like,
Whoa,
what?
Yeah.

673
00:45:08.101 --> 00:45:10.170
And then afterwards you're like,
that was pretty cool.
Yeah.

674
00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:15.603
<v 4>Okay.</v>

675
00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.940
<v 3>You're never,
no,
that's the thing is you,</v>

676
00:45:19.941 --> 00:45:22.950
you can always read me and you kind of know how far to push my boundaries and

677
00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:26.600
hope.
Yeah.
You had to push the guys boundary a little bit.
Yeah,
that's what,

678
00:45:26.601 --> 00:45:29.080
that's what I was telling her.
He's on back there.
Yeah.

679
00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:33.750
These on bag jiggle the twins for a minute.
Right.

680
00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:38.760
And then kind of read back Jayla twins in with your thumb like that.

681
00:45:39.881 --> 00:45:42.400
Maybe that's reverse grip.
Oh,

682
00:45:42.401 --> 00:45:46.270
that's interesting because she's checking the oil that way.
But see,

683
00:45:46.271 --> 00:45:49.510
I think that we could end everything.
I know.
Yeah.

684
00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:53.710
But that's when she shaves her face in there quick before he has a chance.
Yeah.

685
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:55.420
That's a risky,
yeah.
You're,

686
00:45:55.421 --> 00:45:59.260
you're kind of playing the high risk reward game right there.
That's all I know.

687
00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:03.080
Yeah.
Yeah.
So let me show you this serial killer lineup.
So this guy,

688
00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:06.730
Arthur Shawcross was there.
I heard of him.
Yeah.

689
00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:11.530
Will you and I have watched a program about him?
Is this that funny,

690
00:46:11.531 --> 00:46:14.770
funny thing where his mom molest him?
Yeah.
But

691
00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:20.170
I say that was funny.
He brought this up at the live show yesterday and yeah.

692
00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:23.350
The audience didn't seem to think that part was funny.
Oh yeah,

693
00:46:23.351 --> 00:46:28.270
I remember this asshole.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's a real fucking pos.
This guy.
Oh yeah,
man,

694
00:46:28.271 --> 00:46:29.410
this is on Netflix now,

695
00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:32.430
<v 6>dad.
Oh,</v>

696
00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:38.170
just do
links a lot.
Yeah.
To take,

697
00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:39.820
it's called guilt.
Yeah.

698
00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:44.980
More or less after they just relax your body.
Relax.
It doesn't fight,

699
00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:49.180
so he knows they're dead.
I don't take it both for a minutes.

700
00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.840
Problem not interested in got these eyes.
No thanks.

701
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:54.740
Don't feed it on my lunch.

702
00:46:57.530 --> 00:47:01.010
<v 3>Yeah.
Anyways,
sorry.
Why did you show that to the audience and to me?</v>

703
00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:04.340
Well,
there was part of our comedy show.

704
00:47:04.341 --> 00:47:07.470
Was that appropriately the suit as we were talking,
what were we talking about?

705
00:47:07.471 --> 00:47:10.790
And I brought it up.
I brought it up and you wanted to bring it up.

706
00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:14.990
You forced that on me queued up.
Yeah,
you did.
Right.

707
00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:20.420
<v 6>Oh,
for fuck's she talking to the killer?
Yeah,
man.
Yeah.</v>

708
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:22.730
Yeah.

709
00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:26.050
You want to get to the subsequently found out that he did hang out at a Dunkin

710
00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:30.010
donut.
Oh boy.
You want to do the no,
no,
no,
I'm

711
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:34.630
<v 0>good.
I got it.
Like a bunch of playing cards here.
We took the stack and like,</v>

712
00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:35.910
oh,
is that right?

713
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:38.190
<v 7>Do they come and we're able to verify was</v>

714
00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:41.180
<v 0>put 'em under a hypnosis.
Um,</v>

715
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:45.080
the shrink did after he was caught and then she starts,
you know,

716
00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:46.550
getting into all his history.

717
00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:51.690
<v 7>The fact that he was a horribly mistreated sexually as a child part is funny for</v>

718
00:47:55.091 --> 00:47:57.390
the,
in the course of the interviews,
he,

719
00:47:57.450 --> 00:48:00.780
we lived with some of that experience,

720
00:48:00.781 --> 00:48:04.560
which was out of his conscious awareness.
Dr. Lewis,
let's sure

721
00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:08.860
<v 3>cross your series of interviews,
some conducted under a form of hypnosis.</v>

722
00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:12.333
<v 9>What are you doing</v>

723
00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:16.620
while you're moaning and peanut?

724
00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:22.660
What happened?
Wow,

725
00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:28.660
<v 3>great.
Can I not see this ever?
I don't want this.
Okay.
Okay.
Look,</v>

726
00:48:28.661 --> 00:48:32.260
we gotta move on.
I'm going to throw up.
I hate this kind of shit.
I got a son.

727
00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:38.460
So one listener wrote in saying that they agreed with you that the last episode

728
00:48:38.711 --> 00:48:41.500
we watched where a man got his legs crushed,
violently

729
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:45.710
thought of it makes you happy.

730
00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:49.240
A one person wrote in saying that they agree with you.
Actually I won't,

731
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:51.220
I won't exaggerate exactly.

732
00:48:51.221 --> 00:48:55.690
Three people email the show saying that you are right.

733
00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:56.740
But that was funny.

734
00:48:56.741 --> 00:49:01.741
And then they submitted some horribly violent videos that we can watch and,

735
00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:04.840
and judge for ourselves as it funny or just horrible.

736
00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:09.820
<v 0>Yeah.
Well,
um,
hold on a second.
It's at the bottom of the cheat sheet.</v>

737
00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:10.990
No,
I know.
I know where it is.

738
00:49:10.991 --> 00:49:14.080
I wanted to first say that you're not telling the truth.

739
00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:18.430
I have the emails that came in.
Hold on.
I was talking about his podcast,

740
00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:22.930
jl.com posted this on,
uh,
what's it called?

741
00:49:22.931 --> 00:49:27.160
On Facebook.
I posted the video of the guy getting crushed by the car.

742
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:32.980
I asked everybody to watch it on the page and I said,
check 'em out.

743
00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:38.110
Here's what I want to know.
Do you laugh at this a lot?
A little or not at all?

744
00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:43.500
The posts reached 50,000.
Um,

745
00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:48.280
there's hundreds of comments.
Uh Huh.
All of them being like,

746
00:49:48.281 --> 00:49:51.640
you're mentally ill.
No.
Here's the first comment.
As an Asian,

747
00:49:51.641 --> 00:49:56.290
I must say this is the most aes and Shit I've ever seen from the bad driving to

748
00:49:56.291 --> 00:49:59.130
the yell to the cold gays or the man staring at the director,

749
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:04.570
Brian Yang posted that they've lost Asian Shit.
Yeah.
You see,
that's funny.

750
00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.840
He wrote,
it's this weird Asian mentality.
If you get some,

751
00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:12.880
if you get hurt somehow it's your own fault.
I bet everyone in the shop was like,

752
00:50:12.881 --> 00:50:16.210
why the hell was he standing back there anyway?
It's right.
Um,

753
00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:20.410
and then finding right underneath that a woman Sheena rights as another Asian I

754
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:21.303
secondness

755
00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:25.130
<v 3>so it's an Asian thing.</v>

756
00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:29.420
<v 0>Yeah,
that's what they said.
Um,
so let's see.</v>

757
00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.060
I laughed a lot.
There's the next comment from Russell,

758
00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:34.460
mostly at the dis disinterested asshole.

759
00:50:34.461 --> 00:50:37.590
Glancing down at the dude's fucked up legs.
Um,

760
00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:43.050
<v 3>well see that's the thing is that's different than the guys pain.</v>

761
00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:46.710
Are you laughing at the sound of the man's pain?

762
00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:51.680
<v 0>Okay,
well,
there's a lot that I'm laughing at.
I mean,
the,
his expression,</v>

763
00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:56.390
the sound of the sound of his pain.
There's like a way you can break it up,

764
00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:01.280
detach yourself from the real pain to find it funny,

765
00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:01.630
you know.

766
00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:04.720
<v 3>See that maybe that's my problem is I have what's called empathy.
No.</v>

767
00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:07.960
And so when I see other humans being heard or animals,

768
00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:09.520
I don't feel like it's fun.
Yeah.

769
00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:13.880
<v 0>I don't find it ever wait for him for animals to get hurt.
Um,
and I,</v>

770
00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:18.150
I don't like if you told me like someone's,
you know,
like a really,
I don't know,

771
00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:21.440
like one time this guy told me this bathtub got dropped on his neck and it

772
00:51:21.441 --> 00:51:24.110
shattered it.
I laughed so hard,
but it's not in his faith.

773
00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:28.730
I laughed in his face.
I couldn't even control myself.
And he was like,

774
00:51:28.731 --> 00:51:31.740
I know you love this shit.
He used to come to work.
It'd be like,
Oh,

775
00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:34.160
I'll tell you that.
He was able to be like,
Tom,
I know you'll love this.

776
00:51:34.310 --> 00:51:39.260
About this time I was working at a site in this ladder,
fell and broke my leg.
Um,

777
00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:44.170
and then I was just laughing,
laugh.
So yeah,
I'd say,
I don't,
did you get here?

778
00:51:44.171 --> 00:51:48.530
He's due July.
Dan Hughes wrote.
It's definitely funny.
I'm like Ben,

779
00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:52.700
I laughed almost as much as I did from the lady falling off the grape stomping

780
00:51:52.701 --> 00:51:54.860
back.
That was different.
That was funny.
But he said,

781
00:51:54.861 --> 00:51:59.720
he's saying he's saying that he left because her al is like,
oh,
I like,

782
00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:03.680
it was a funny sound.
Yeah,
well the guy said I laughed.
It was little.
Daniel says,

783
00:52:03.681 --> 00:52:07.670
I laughed a lot.
The sound he's making sounds like he's mocking someone in pain.

784
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.270
Couldn't help it.
Um,
Tyler road.

785
00:52:11.271 --> 00:52:14.900
I'm still trying to find my balls because I laughed them off vigorously watching

786
00:52:14.901 --> 00:52:17.330
this.
Chelsea writes a lot.

787
00:52:17.331 --> 00:52:20.510
I showed a few friends who laughed but didn't find that as funny as I did.
Oh,

788
00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:24.200
that's interesting.
Well,
Bryon Byron Brian writes,

789
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:28.880
it would be funnier in person.
Uh,
Jose,
I couldn't stop laughing.

790
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:30.583
Um,

791
00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:35.030
<v 3>like all these people are just trying to suck up to you.
I don't think so.
No,</v>

792
00:52:35.031 --> 00:52:39.920
because a few people told me this isn't funny.
Okay.
Can we watch the video again,

793
00:52:39.921 --> 00:52:40.480
please?

794
00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:43.670
And then I'd like to see the other videos that were presented to us and we can

795
00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:49.540
watch for ourselves and see if it's funny or just a sad,

796
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:50.780
okay.
Okay.
Right.

797
00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:54.830
<v 0>Okay.
Why a little taste of loud?
I'm like,
God,
I love the taste of Alaska.</v>

798
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:56.980
I hate when those four commercial is that form.

799
00:52:57.110 --> 00:53:01.080
I didn't want to give him [inaudible] blog.
So upsetting.
And I know.

800
00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:04.740
Um,
let's see here.

801
00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:09.990
There you have to wait for the fucking dad to stop.
Alright,
so here we go.

802
00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:14.230
<v 10>One that started at all.</v>

803
00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:21.020
All right,
so the guys back in India,
the garage,

804
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:25.050
is it back at a newer employee forward,
I guess is pulling forward into it,
right?

805
00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:26.800
You'd have a dash cam in the front of your car.

806
00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:47.170
<v 2>Isn't
a lot of pain right now.</v>

807
00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:54.570
You think it's really funny.
I don't

808
00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:57.850
<v 10>violent baby and he's</v>

809
00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:02.170
suffering is not helping at all.

810
00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:08.290
This guy's just like,
why are you making so much noise?
Yeah,
hold on.

811
00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:13.340
Here's the best part.
This guy like whatever,
whatever.
Right.

812
00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:18.010
Didn't give a shit.
Look down not to fuck with that man's life coming back.

813
00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:20.620
He's texting somebody feel bad.

814
00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:22.330
<v 2>It looks at the car</v>

815
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:29.950
<v 10>fucked up right there on the car.
And that man still hasn't stood up yet.
Jeans?</v>

816
00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:31.830
No.
He's riding in.

817
00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:34.360
<v 2>Hey.
And you're laughing.</v>

818
00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:38.380
<v 10>Okay.
And this is walks over him.
This is terrible.</v>

819
00:54:38.381 --> 00:54:42.460
This is the saddest thing I've ever seen in my life.
Right?

820
00:54:42.461 --> 00:54:45.250
This is terrible.
Yeah.
No,
that's not good.
It's not good.

821
00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:48.323
<v 2>Damn man</v>

822
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:54.980
<v 3>bad.
You don't know what to anymore.
That's the real killer interview.
Nope.
Okay.</v>

823
00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:58.600
Guide
with you.

824
00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:02.830
It's kind of interesting and I don't,
I'm not into it right now,
man.
I,
you know,

825
00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:06.020
the older I get,
the more sensitive I am.
The shit like this can work.

826
00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:08.223
<v 4>Uh,</v>

827
00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:12.120
<v 3>what was sent in and this is an NR show file.
I haven't seen any of it yet.</v>

828
00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:16.500
It's called funny or horrific.
Okay.
So we're supposed to watch these and decide.

829
00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:20.160
Okay.
And you're allowed to laugh if you think it's funny and I will.
Okay.

830
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:23.310
And I will,
trust me.
There's lots,
this is Tanner,
right?

831
00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:25.380
It makes explosive targets.

832
00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:29.590
You mix it together and then use a high power bullet to explode it all.

833
00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:33.060
It's normally safe.
If used correctly,
it wasn't this time.

834
00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:35.660
This is what's left of a broken down writing

835
00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:36.573
<v 2>lawn mower.</v>

836
00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:41.830
23 year old David Presley pack with three pounds of Tannerite then shot it with

837
00:55:41.831 --> 00:55:44.290
a rifle.
They weren't terribly bad from there

838
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:50.220
flying piece of the lawnmowers.
Severed prestige.

839
00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:57.300
<v 3>Very dangerous.
It's not a toy.
Well you know why that's funny.</v>

840
00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:59.720
More than a firecracker,
whatever.

841
00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:04.470
You know what I'm calling the kettle black now.
You know why that's funny.

842
00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:07.200
He's a fucking idiot redneck.
And he,

843
00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:12.010
he got himself into that by Tannerite or whatever.
She's shooting that Hannah.

844
00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:15.000
Right?
Why is his asshole shooting up something that's highly explosive?

845
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:17.970
Genuinely laugh.
Well cause he's a fucking hillbillies.
He's an idiot.

846
00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:23.150
He deserved that.
He severed his leg but he's a dumb dumb.

847
00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:27.100
Are you shooting a highly explosive?
Yeah.
But what happened to empathy?
No,

848
00:56:27.210 --> 00:56:31.890
he that was self inflicted.
Dumb.
Dumb.
That was his own fault.

849
00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:33.470
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

850
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:36.320
<v 3>I cannot believe you're laughing at that.
Well,
he's a dope.
Wow.</v>

851
00:56:36.321 --> 00:56:37.730
You're so mean about it too.

852
00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:40.580
Well cause like the woman's like it's highly explosive.

853
00:56:41.090 --> 00:56:45.170
Tannerite so why would you do that?
It's too close.
He shooting too close.

854
00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:51.340
Why do you have to shoot anything and the fucking backyard?
You know what I mean?

855
00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:52.693
God.

856
00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:53.420
<v 2>Okay.</v>

857
00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:58.070
<v 3>I did not pan right then.
Shot it with a rifle.
Why would you buy it from there?</v>

858
00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:01.750
<v 2>A flying piece of the lawnmowers</v>

859
00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:07.393
move on his lap.

860
00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:10.230
<v 3>Dangerous.
It's not a colon.
Yeah,
he's a dope.</v>

861
00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:15.840
Greg Bloom.
Lego dumbed down.

862
00:57:15.850 --> 00:57:19.650
I'm not with you guys on that one.
Are you serious?
You empathize.

863
00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:23.370
I don't think it's funny you empathize with the tannerite shooting.
Retard.

864
00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:25.650
He shoots his own shit off.
Oh yeah.

865
00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:30.010
<v 0>Oh my God.
Yeah,
that was,
that was dumb.
Okay,</v>

866
00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:32.020
thank your dumb.
Okay,

867
00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:44.193
<v 2>whoa.</v>

868
00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:02.910
Yes.
Sorry.

869
00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:08.080
<v 0>People that don't know.
Yeah,
we did a horrible job of saying it.</v>

870
00:58:08.081 --> 00:58:11.250
This guy did he jump in is it looks like he,

871
00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:14.620
they're sitting on the wall and they're sitting on the wall of a,

872
00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:18.130
this is kind of a bullshit level.
Bull fighting.

873
00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:23.350
It's not professional rank.
Yeah.
I mean like it's,
you know,
it's small town stuff,

874
00:58:23.351 --> 00:58:23.730
right?

875
00:58:23.730 --> 00:58:28.730
This is a small town and this dude jumps in and he starts running and the bulge,

876
00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:33.960
it's a small bull charges him and Oh locks him under the Chin and knocks this

877
00:58:37.451 --> 00:58:41.740
dude out cold.
I mean really knocks and Malcolm,
it looks like,
uh,

878
00:58:42.550 --> 00:58:47.290
like in football of full speed,
like the planner was,

879
00:58:47.350 --> 00:58:52.210
was going to fair catch from the ball and somebody just lays him the fuck out.

880
00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:55.540
<v 3>God,
it's so funny.
Is that for you?
I don't know.
I don't know</v>

881
00:58:58.670 --> 00:58:59.503
<v 2>more like,</v>

882
00:58:59.930 --> 00:59:02.690
<v 0>oh my God,
but that's just kind of does that to me.</v>

883
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:05.750
That doesn't tickle your taste,
Huh?
Yeah.

884
00:59:05.751 --> 00:59:08.180
I still totally disturbed that you thought it was funny.

885
00:59:08.181 --> 00:59:09.410
That guy's leg was severed.

886
00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:14.040
<v 3>Just the way he went.
Like,
well,
what did you think was going to happen?
Ding Dong,</v>

887
00:59:14.041 --> 00:59:18.990
you shot a,
the highly explosive thing with a rifle at pretty close range.

888
00:59:18.991 --> 00:59:22.220
If you look,
he's not far enough.
I can see his,
so yeah,

889
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:27.250
he should have kind of look when people shoot explosive things and the in their

890
00:59:27.591 --> 00:59:31.090
own backyard.
You're like,
what are you doing bro?
Like it's not a smart set up.
No,

891
00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:35.060
I know.
You know.
And and getting an attack by an animal is different story.

892
00:59:35.061 --> 00:59:39.370
Getting accidentally crushed by a car is a different story.
That's a funny,
right?

893
00:59:39.550 --> 00:59:41.360
It's a funny,
funny your premise then.
Yeah.

894
00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:46.120
<v 0>The bull.
Big Ass bonfire.
Take one out guys.</v>

895
00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:49.030
Don't try this out.
That's a big bonfire.

896
00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:55.890
Lot paper guys.
Five gallons.
Right?
Why people haven't done this.

897
00:59:56.310 --> 01:00:00.270
Let's do this shitting on a mountain of stuff.
Yeah,
I kinda like this.

898
01:00:00.271 --> 01:00:04.160
Ward three.
Okay.
They're going to light this.

899
01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:05.610
Oh my God.

900
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:10.380
<v 6>Oh.
Oh,
you don't?
Okay.</v>

901
01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:14.820
You okay?
Holy Fuck man at fire.

902
01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:20.270
All right.
And you don't even see what,
it's just a flash bang.

903
01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:25.260
I mean that turned into a bond.
You're not laughing.

904
01:00:27.350 --> 01:00:29.400
<v 0>You're laughing at this funny,
funny video.</v>

905
01:00:29.401 --> 01:00:32.960
And these aren't as funny as the ones I,
the accidental leg crushing.

906
01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:36.110
That was funny.
Okay.
It's not that his leg got crushed.

907
01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:40.630
It was the how the guy reacted to it.
That was funny.
The indifferent.
Oh,

908
01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:46.820
that part.
And then on top of that,
yeah,
a guy comes back,
it doesn't care.

909
01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:50.850
Then it comes back a second time.
A checks out the bumper.
Yeah.
And text messages.

910
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:54.980
Someone.
Yeah.
That was way fun.
Here it's like I'm going to be late for this guy.

911
01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:59.150
He lit that from,
how would you be that dumb to light that that close.

912
01:00:59.210 --> 01:01:03.490
That's what I'm saying.
Why hillbillies,
Bam.
Yeah.
Not Bright.

913
01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:09.160
Yeah.
No,
they're not smart.
It should tell all of you guys that if you ever,

914
01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:14.300
if you ever,
you know,
now it's just,
cause I,
I moved this year.

915
01:01:14.301 --> 01:01:18.530
I'll stop for a second.
If you ever decide to

916
01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:25.280
do a bonfire or set off a bomb of some type,

917
01:01:25.550 --> 01:01:27.800
get really far away from it,
you know?
Yeah.

918
01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:33.200
Or just don't do it or get really far away.
Yeah.
This one's so careless.
This,

919
01:01:33.201 --> 01:01:35.690
which is like a pile.
It was a pile of wood,

920
01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:40.720
all kinds of bullshit before five gallons of gasoline on it and then he lit it

921
01:01:41.241 --> 01:01:46.220
from 16 inches away.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.

922
01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:49.430
It's pretty bad.
Yeah.
That's really bad.
They didn't do it for me.

923
01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:52.010
That one I thought for sure.
That would make you giggle.

924
01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:01.030
<v 6>Yeah.
Right.
Okay.
You okay?</v>

925
01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:06.630
Fine.
All right.

926
01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:09.290
Holy Fuck.

927
01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.490
A bunch of retired,
right?

928
01:02:17.050 --> 01:02:20.670
<v 0>Yeah,
I did.
Um,
when I was in,
in middle school,</v>

929
01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.610
I went to was Lake Michigan.

930
01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:28.640
There was like a part you could go to the lake by our house and it was pretty

931
01:02:29.041 --> 01:02:31.170
isolated.
And I put together,

932
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:36.060
made a little bonfire and I took spray paint cans and I put them in the fire.

933
01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.560
But then I backed,

934
01:02:37.561 --> 01:02:41.940
I mean I ran back up this hill after it got to a certain temperature,

935
01:02:41.941 --> 01:02:46.890
they exploded and the color of that spray paint would go up in the air.
Yeah.

936
01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.960
But I got really far away from it and,

937
01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:54.160
<v 3>oh,
that's number one.
If you're going to do Tom foolery like this.
Yeah.</v>

938
01:02:54.290 --> 01:02:56.750
Get the fuck away,
dude.
Yeah.
Don't stick around.

939
01:02:56.990 --> 01:03:00.340
Did you know that my dad blew up a bridge when he was a teenager?
Yeah.

940
01:03:00.350 --> 01:03:04.290
You told me that in Louisville.
Small.
Yeah.
Damn.
Yeah.

941
01:03:04.330 --> 01:03:09.230
Like one of those not,
not a bridge,
like a major,
that commuting bridge.

942
01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:13.790
It was one of these wooden email,
like when he was in denning or something.
No,
no,

943
01:03:13.791 --> 01:03:17.930
no.
He did that later.
It was like 13.
He went and uh,

944
01:03:18.290 --> 01:03:20.470
there was like a little wooden tea for a little,

945
01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:22.970
a small crossing the pond kind of thing,
you know?
Yeah.

946
01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:24.800
And he put a stick of dynamite in there

947
01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:26.620
<v 0>and uh,</v>

948
01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:31.110
blew it up and then this is how old's call that shit was,

949
01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.530
I forget,
I think the sheriff found out,

950
01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:39.360
came to the House and talked to his dad and he was like,

951
01:03:39.361 --> 01:03:41.190
well I'll give him a talking.
I'll talk to them.

952
01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:44.250
<v 3>That was it.
Yeah.
And they were all like,
you can't do that,</v>

953
01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:47.220
don't you go blown up bridge no more.
Yeah.
He was like,
I'm tired.

954
01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:52.410
Cause like now if he did that,
what happens?
You get sent to jail or oh my God.

955
01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:55.110
Well we are 13 what happens?
You get at,
first of all,

956
01:03:55.111 --> 01:03:58.110
I forget the story of how he got his hands on dynamite,

957
01:03:58.111 --> 01:04:01.520
but that would be the story.
Like how'd you get dynamite,
right.

958
01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:05.430
Well they sold it on the side of the road back then.
Yeah.
Really crazy man.

959
01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:08.130
Really crazy.
Well it's true though.
Isn't that weird?

960
01:04:08.131 --> 01:04:12.870
How he did kind of grow up and then blew up a bunch of bridges in Vietnam.

961
01:04:12.871 --> 01:04:17.610
Like he found his life's calling early in life.
It's neat when you do that.

962
01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:19.760
<v 0>It is neat.
Um,</v>

963
01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.070
<v 3>I know many people.
Do you think your dad's killed?

Because I'm letting you know.

1038
01:09:14.091 --> 01:09:17.360
This is from the last step to this up.

unbelievable outrage from seemingly harmless attempts at comedy makes the viewer

1097
01:13:11.761 --> 01:13:13.070
say,
Whoa,
Hey Hitler.

1098
01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:15.380
<v 3>It's so</v>

1099
01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:18.500
<v 0>convenient to be able to stream the dock now through Amazon because I wonder</v>

1100
01:13:18.501 --> 01:13:21.710
what rewatch a few scenes that made me tighten up my,

1101
01:13:21.711 --> 01:13:25.850
how you say rectum if you are on the fence,
do I hesitate?

1102
01:13:25.851 --> 01:13:30.410
It's a great doc.
The only thing it left me thinking was why is Bert so fat?

1103
01:13:31.690 --> 01:13:33.190
<v 3>That's great.
See on the one hand,</v>

1104
01:13:33.191 --> 01:13:38.191
I'm sure the producers of can we take a joker stoke that people are watching it

1105
01:13:38.201 --> 01:13:43.080
and revealing it.
On the other hand,
they're all crazy reviews is another review.

1106
01:13:43.081 --> 01:13:46.400
It's all our fans from red miss 89 sky punches for the wind.

1107
01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:50.980
What an amazing documentary.
My jeans are now higher and tight.

1108
01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:53.430
You know what I'm saying?
The film dives

1109
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:57.210
<v 0>into the Pacific struggles of comedians having to apologize for jokes.</v>

1110
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:59.490
The insights from the all star cast.

1111
01:13:59.491 --> 01:14:02.190
We'll give you a better understanding of what a joke actually is.

1112
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:05.460
Some say friends are the worst,
but after watching this,

1113
01:14:05.461 --> 01:14:10.170
you will realize the political rec correctness is just as bad as why burnt

1114
01:14:10.171 --> 01:14:11.320
Chrysler is so fat.

1115
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.900
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
That was fine.
Great.
Yeah.
Very funny.
I started,
uh,</v>

1116
01:14:16.901 --> 01:14:21.070
acknowledge the,
you're right listeners.
Mommy's rejoice.
There's a lot.
Yeah.

1117
01:14:21.071 --> 01:14:24.720
There's a lot here.
It's funny.
Like I said,
I don't think the,

1118
01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:28.720
the producers of the film have not reached out to thank me for all the reviews.

1119
01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:33.490
Yeah.
But still very fun.
It's so funny that this is now immortalized on,

1120
01:14:33.730 --> 01:14:36.280
on this movie,
I think is fun.
Uh,
we could try.

1121
01:14:36.281 --> 01:14:39.350
If you want to call top dog real quick,
I'd love to,
yeah.
You want to try it?

1122
01:14:39.351 --> 01:14:44.200
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Let's see if,
um,
if I can make that happen.
Okay.

1123
01:14:44.850 --> 01:14:45.750
<v 2>Here we go.</v>

1124
01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:49.960
<v 3>I never remember that house number,
but I'll give it a shot.</v>

1125
01:14:54.810 --> 01:14:59.290
Okay,
here we go.
Let's see if he'll answer.

1126
01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:02.770
<v 13>Yeah,</v>

1127
01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:03.603
<v 2>too late.</v>

1128
01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.030
<v 3>They're so bad about answering the phone.</v>

1129
01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:07.213
<v 13>Fuck his time,</v>

1130
01:15:08.730 --> 01:15:10.140
<v 3>sir.
So upsetting.</v>

1131
01:15:12.050 --> 01:15:13.760
<v 13>And then a lot.
I was like,
where were you?</v>

1132
01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:19.310
<v 14>Hello?
Chara yes.
Hi.
It's your son.</v>

1133
01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:27.840
<v 15>The funniest thing [inaudible] I want to blow up that cost.</v>

1134
01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:29.133
Let me answer

1135
01:15:31.810 --> 01:15:35.840
because it's up to 1% six.
I looked cero familiar.

1136
01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:36.890
Almost block you.

1137
01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:41.240
<v 14>Oh,
cause they had
told me,
you was telling me,
hey,</v>

1138
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:43.340
can you turn down that TV for a second?

1139
01:15:43.650 --> 01:15:44.940
<v 15>Sorry.
Can you turn on your TV?</v>

1140
01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:50.670
<v 14>Hey,
I need to ask dad something real quick and can you pass them down?</v>

1141
01:15:50.710 --> 01:15:55.390
Do you mind?
Okay.
On.
Okay,
thanks so loud.
Why is it so loud?
Hey Buddy.

1142
01:15:55.630 --> 01:15:56.620
Hey,
what's up dad?

1143
01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:59.470
<v 15>Oh,
just sitting her watching the Olympics.</v>

1144
01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:01.130
<v 14>Yeah.
Good time and fun.</v>

1145
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:04.150
<v 15>Oh yeah.
It's amazing how,
um,</v>

1146
01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:07.770
how great the Americans are doing in a poorly,

1147
01:16:07.771 --> 01:16:12.210
the Chinese are doing relative to their,
yeah.

1148
01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:13.940
Well,
but yeah,
they did print,

1149
01:16:13.941 --> 01:16:16.740
the Chinese did really well and then when they had the Olympics there,

1150
01:16:16.741 --> 01:16:21.150
but you know,
I haven't seen my theaters.
Is that what you're saying?
Right.

1151
01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:24.450
Well,
you know,
I think the,
the,
the,

1152
01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:28.980
the cheaters really turned out to be,
uh,
the Russians,
you know,

1153
01:16:28.981 --> 01:16:32.340
they a band a hundred and some odd Russians.
Yeah.

1154
01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:36.420
The entire weight lifting team and all,
but I think,

1155
01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:40.710
uh,
water to track and field people.

1156
01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:43.710
<v 3>Wow.
Huh.
That's pretty significant.
Hey,
um,</v>

1157
01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:45.940
how many people you think you killed overall?

1158
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:53.860
<v 15>Well,
uh,
rolls into it.
You know,
I'm not really sure.
I mean that was</v>

1159
01:16:55.670 --> 01:16:58.220
<v 14>not really sure.
Do you have a guest,
like a rough estimate?</v>

1160
01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:03.790
<v 15>Oh,
probably three.</v>

1161
01:17:04.650 --> 01:17:08.550
<v 14>Really?
What really be,
that's maybe why not more?</v>

1162
01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:15.130
<v 15>Well,
officers do most of the,
um,
you know,
you,
you,
you,</v>

1163
01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:17.980
you basically can,
you control the artillery and stuff.

1164
01:17:17.981 --> 01:17:21.100
And so sometimes you know,

1165
01:17:21.130 --> 01:17:23.230
and that your troops do most of the shooting.

1166
01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:26.530
<v 14>But when you've talked about,
you said it's like a euphoric feeling,</v>

1167
01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:30.370
like the best thing is killing the enemy.
You experienced that firsthand.

1168
01:17:31.890 --> 01:17:36.730
<v 15>Well,
you know,
I don't like to,
yeah,</v>

1169
01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:40.950
that's not something that,
that I really would ever want to talk about publicly.

1170
01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:45.170
<v 14>Okay.
Well let me ask you this.
You like jokes,
right?</v>

1171
01:17:45.530 --> 01:17:47.300
I love jokes.
Okay.

1172
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:52.390
So I wanted to read some jokes to you and talk and you tell me what you think of

1173
01:17:52.971 --> 01:17:54.860
these jokes.
Okay.

1174
01:17:56.330 --> 01:17:59.240
How can you tell when a blonde sends you a fax?

1175
01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:03.070
<v 16>Uh,</v>

1176
01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:06.730
<v 14>I love blonde jokes by the way.
I don't know.</v>

1177
01:18:07.210 --> 01:18:08.320
It has a stamp on it.

1178
01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:18.660
<v 16>Love those jokes.</v>

1179
01:18:21.210 --> 01:18:25.140
<v 14>Okay.
How can you tell if a blonde has been using your computer?</v>

1180
01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:29.990
I don't know.
There's whiteout all over the Monitor.

1181
01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:38.070
I got one for you too.
Okay,
go.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

1182
01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:44.030
<v 15>Okay.
This line is sitting at a bar in Chicago watching the,
yeah.</v>

1183
01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:48.090
The one of these bars where they had to TV buying the bar and uh,

1184
01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:52.350
there's some guy up on the ledge getting ready to jump.
So this,
this guy sits,

1185
01:18:52.351 --> 01:18:55.270
sat next to her and he says,
sure,

1186
01:18:56.090 --> 01:19:00.770
this is the six o'clock news.
And,
and uh,
he says,
uh,

1187
01:19:00.771 --> 01:19:05.690
I bet you he jumps and a blonde says,
I bet you a drink.

1188
01:19:05.691 --> 01:19:08.810
He doesn't.
And all of a sudden

1189
01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:14.330
the guy jumps.
And so the,
the guys at the blonde says,

1190
01:19:14.331 --> 01:19:17.000
I guess you owe you $20.
And he said,
no,

1191
01:19:17.001 --> 01:19:20.870
I really can't take the money cause I saw it on the five o'clock news and the

1192
01:19:20.871 --> 01:19:23.960
blonde says,
so did I.
But I thought he might change his mind.

1193
01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:33.360
<v 16>I think that</v>

1194
01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.780
<v 14>that's hilarious.
Oh my God.</v>

1195
01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:46.790
That's so funny.
You imagine,
man,

1196
01:19:46.791 --> 01:19:50.430
that's funny.
How do you draw on it?

1197
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:54.833
<v 16>Uh,</v>

1198
01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:58.650
<v 15>you know,
have her stand in the shower for a long time.</v>

1199
01:20:00.030 --> 01:20:00.670
<v 16>Okay.</v>

1200
01:20:00.670 --> 01:20:03.390
<v 14>No,
I dunno.
I'm just guessing.
I don't know.
Okay.</v>

1201
01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:11.250
Uh,
you put a scratch and sniff sticker at the bottom of the pool.

1202
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:17.240
<v 16>That's funny.
That's funny.</v>

1203
01:20:21.610 --> 01:20:26.110
<v 14>What did the blonde say when she saw the sign in front of the Ymcas?</v>

1204
01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:27.553
Okay.

1205
01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:28.943
<v 15>I don't know.</v>

1206
01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:31.050
<v 14>Look,
they spelled Macy's wrong.</v>

1207
01:20:37.210 --> 01:20:41.050
<v 16>Yeah,
I got one more blind jokes.
Yeah,
yeah,</v>

1208
01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:42.230
please keep it coming.

1209
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:47.810
She was going to go from New York to Europe.

1210
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:50.020
<v 15>Got London.
Yeah,</v>

1211
01:20:50.230 --> 01:20:54.760
so she's just climbed on board and she sat in first class without a first class

1212
01:20:54.761 --> 01:20:59.470
ticket
and the story says,
I'm sorry miss,

1213
01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:04.060
but you're not allowed.
You have to go back and coach.
She says,
I'm blonde,

1214
01:21:04.090 --> 01:21:07.010
I'm beautiful and I'm going to London in First Class.

1215
01:21:07.730 --> 01:21:09.730
The stewardess never had anybody talk to her like that.

1216
01:21:09.731 --> 01:21:14.260
So she went to get to the copilot.
Copilot came out and said,
miss,

1217
01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:16.660
he got to go to the back of the couch with everybody else.

1218
01:21:16.661 --> 01:21:19.960
You don't have first class ticket.
She goes,
I'm blonde,

1219
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:22.540
I'm beautiful and very busty as you can see,

1220
01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:27.430
I'm going to London in First Class.
Well we call it pilot.

1221
01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:32.770
He didn't know what to do.
So he goes up and tells the captain,
the captain does,

1222
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:37.360
don't worry.
I speak blonde.
Captain goes back,

1223
01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:38.830
whisper some interior.

1224
01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:44.040
She pops up and runs back into coach and the other said,

1225
01:21:44.141 --> 01:21:47.890
what did you say to her?
I told her that only coach is going to London.

1226
01:21:56.210 --> 01:22:00.580
<v 16>I think that's hilarious.
Dumb broad.
Can you imagine?</v>

1227
01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:04.693
Stoop,

1228
01:22:07.890 --> 01:22:11.950
thank their plate,
you know,
to divide this up here.

1229
01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:13.860
I mean had dumb GED yet.

1230
01:22:17.050 --> 01:22:19.750
Really funny.
Actually.
I love that joke.

1231
01:22:20.490 --> 01:22:24.610
I just sometimes I just tell jokes to myself to make myself laugh.

1232
01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:31.450
Oh yeah.

Seriously.

Who Does?
Yeah,

Right.</v>

1237
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:46.310
These two Paul locks are driving down from Cincinnati,

Yeah.
So the time we got to Miami,

1240
01:22:55.721 --> 01:22:56.980
they claimed 150.

1241
01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:07.240

01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:55.100
<v 16>That's really funny.
Oof.</v>

<v 15>Pretty good man.
Yeah.
You know,

this is good stuff here buddy.

1256
01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:13.900
I love you.
You know,
I'm kind of trying to think of some other blonde jokes.

1257
01:24:13.901 --> 01:24:17.330
You caught me off guard here,
but I remember one time I just,

1258
01:24:17.331 --> 01:24:19.880
I googled blonde jokes.
It work.

1259

I must do 20th 30th.

1260
01:24:23.930 --> 01:24:26.560
<v 14>So you think I should do these,
you guys to start doing these onstage?</v>

1261
01:24:26.930 --> 01:24:31.580
<v 15>No,
I actually,
I think you're much better at doing what you do.
Really?</v>

1262
01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:35.740
Oh yeah.
Because you tell a story,
you captivate.
Okay.

1263
01:24:35.930 --> 01:24:40.930
You know the trouble with a blog with a short joke is jokes over excellent.

1264
01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:46.670
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know,
when you do the stories like you do it,

1265
01:24:47.150 --> 01:24:50.420
the sense of anticipation,
you know,

1266
01:24:50.421 --> 01:24:53.150
it's like jumping out of an airplane with no parachute.

1267
01:24:53.250 --> 01:24:57.090
<v 14>Let me tell you some of some other ones I've been thinking up.
Um,
okay.</v>

1268
01:24:57.540 --> 01:24:59.580
How do you sync a Polis battleship?

1269
01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:03.113
<v 16>Uh,</v>

1270
01:25:03.410 --> 01:25:06.230
<v 14>you could just say how,
you don't have to actually try to answer that.</v>

1271
01:25:06.231 --> 01:25:10.760
It's just a joke.
I have no idea.
Yeah,

1272
01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:15.030
<v 15>You know what,

1273
01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:20.640
you know what,
you know what they used to pull it and he's two.

1274
01:25:20.650 --> 01:25:25.650
Paul [inaudible] decided to marry their father at sea and they both drowned.

1275
01:25:26.371 --> 01:25:27.204
He hit his grave.

1276
01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:32.870
<v 14>That's good.
That's good.
Why did the,
why did the poll out cross the road?</v>

1277
01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:35.770
<v 15>Cause he wanted to get to the other side.</v>

1278
01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:39.180
<v 14>No,
he couldn't get his dick out of the chicken.</v>

1279
01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:50.860
Wow.
I'm glad you really enjoyed it.

1280
01:25:50.861 --> 01:25:53.570
And now I know how to cheer you up if you're ever in a bad mood.
Jesus.

1281
01:25:54.450 --> 01:25:59.150
<v 15>All I have to do,
I'm never really in a bad mood.
That's true.
That is true.</v>

1282
01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:03.800
I just,
you know,
all I have to do to entertain myself actually

1283
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:07.760
<v 16>is thinking about all your childhood experiences with me.</v>

1284

<v 3>Dad,

Bri,
I got you one more here.</v>

1285
01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:14.760
How do you know if you're in front of a Polish firing squad?

1286
01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:20.790
<v 16>I think that's true.
Uh,
the guns are faced at the,
uh,</v>

1287
01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:21.950
the Dad Guy,

1288
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:26.490
<v 14>Dad,
Dad,
dad.
Do you not understand how these folks work?</v>

1289
01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:30.510
You're not supposed to actually try to answer them.
It's,
that's,

1290
01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:33.910
it's just set up punching him.
Okay.

1291
01:26:39.390 --> 01:26:40.260
Okay.

you're standing in front of a bullet fires,
but they are standing in a circle.</v>

1293
01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:45.283
Yeah,

1294
01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:53.220
<v 16>I heard that one before.
Yeah,
that's a funny one actually.
Yeah.
That's a funny,</v>

1295
01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:57.760
yeah.
That is funny.
Yeah.

1296
01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:02.780
<v 3>Ooh.
How do you get a poll lock out of a bathtub?</v>

1297
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:04.760
<v 16>I don't know.</v>

1298
01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:05.790
<v 3>Throw in a bar of soap.</v>

1299
01:27:10.670 --> 01:27:11.180
<v 16>Okay.</v>

<v 3>Doughnut seeds.
Doughnut seeds.</v>

1304
01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:28.990
<v 16>Oh my God.
I love it.
Trying to think of,

1305
01:27:29.230 --> 01:27:31.820
<v 3>Oh,
I got a good one for you.
It's an Olympic thing,
right?</v>

1306
01:27:32.470 --> 01:27:35.410
What do poll ox do with all their gold medals?

1307
01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:38.640
<v 16>They don't have any.
No.</v>

1308
01:27:40.630 --> 01:27:44.030
<v 14>Again,

Okay.
They go home and get them bronze.

1310
01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:58.790
<v 16>That's funny.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.</v>

1311
01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:00.900
<v 14>This is one of the best conversations in my life.</v>

1312
01:28:03.210 --> 01:28:04.990
<v 16>Ah.
I love just laughing,
Tommy.</v>

1313
01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:09.770
<v 14>I know dad

Um,</v>

1314
01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:12.670
all right.
I'll give you a call here in a little bit.
Okay.
I got to run for Nokia,

1315
01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:14.330
buddy,
buddy.
Let me get my,
okay.

1316
01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:19.920
<v 3>Wow.
That was possibly one of the funniest calls I've ever had with him.</v>

1317
01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:23.560
That was unbelievable.
Definitely didn't want to get into killing people.
No,

1318
01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:27.210
that was,
I felt bad for me to like,
oh,
should we not have asked that?

1319
01:28:27.211 --> 01:28:29.190
But he brought,
but he's talked about it before.

1320
01:28:29.191 --> 01:28:34.050
That's why we talked about it on our show.
No.
Why Charo was there.
No,

1321
01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:37.560
no.
Charo was there and maybe that's why he didn't want to.
Oh.
Oh,

1322
01:28:38.610 --> 01:28:41.760
I see what you mean.
Mean we've,
we get,
um,
without her in the room.
Yeah.

1323
01:28:41.761 --> 01:28:45.860
I could of,
I felt bad.
I felt bad too.
Yeah.

1324
01:28:46.710 --> 01:28:50.730
But I do like the blonde jokes.
He was really,
really,
really amused by them.

1325
01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:53.460
And I love the Polack jokes.
I think Poland jokes to the best.

1326
01:28:53.610 --> 01:28:57.270
I don't think I've ever heard him laugh like that in my life.
No.

1327
01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:01.980
It's funny cause he knew like the long blonde jokes.
Yeah.
He was like,

1328
01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:05.930
what do they sit down at the bar usually stammers through them,
by the way.
Yeah.

1329
01:29:06.150 --> 01:29:08.100
So he was focused energy.
Yeah,
he was.

1330
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:12.080
And I know that he got that punchline a little raw.
Yes,

1331
01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:16.800
but he got it kind of,
would you like how he tries to answer?
I'm like,
dude,

1332
01:29:16.801 --> 01:29:20.250
just justice.
Just knock knock.
Who's there?
That's it.

1333
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:22.860
You don't try to answer those.
The bear,

1334
01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:27.690
the barrels of the guns are playing back.
What are you talking about?

1335
01:29:28.450 --> 01:29:31.620
Jesus that punch on it.
Have you ever laughed that hard at anything?
No.

1336
01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:36.720
Now the other thing is,
uh,
with your pops,
enjoy these,
some of the blonde stuff.

1337
01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:41.490
Yeah.
Yeah.
He likes it,
but he likes a more racist stuff.

1338
01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:44.070
Yeah.
He likes the old school truly tasteless.

1339
01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:47.010
Like if you were to open up one of those black jokes,

1340
01:29:47.011 --> 01:29:51.480
Jew jokes loves the blonde jokes.
Loves Pole.
My Dad loves those Polack jokes.

1341
01:29:51.481 --> 01:29:53.070
I had heard all of them cause my father,

1342
01:29:53.370 --> 01:29:56.850
but in Hungary they would tell them about the Russians.
Oh,
snap poll ox.

1343
01:29:56.851 --> 01:29:58.470
It's the Russians,
how stupid Russians are.

1344
01:29:58.770 --> 01:30:01.610
So I grew up hearing dumb Russian jokes,
which is what

1345
01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:07.000
<v 0>origin of why a Polish joke is it,
you know what I mean?
Is it,</v>

1346
01:30:07.001 --> 01:30:08.050
why is that a stupid?

1347
01:30:08.090 --> 01:30:11.820
<v 3>Personally,
I think it does come from their military being bad.</v>

1348
01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:13.920
I remember I asked my dad this question when I was a kid.

1349
01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:17.810
I think it's because they're military was so bad that that's what it's,

1350
01:30:17.870 --> 01:30:20.850
it started like,
they like an emasculating thing,
right?
Yeah.

1351
01:30:20.851 --> 01:30:24.720
Like you notice that one of the jokes was about the Polish military.
Yeah.

1352
01:30:24.721 --> 01:30:26.870
A few of them were.
Yeah.
It's because they're,

1353
01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:31.290
they're notoriously bad at knowledge.
I,
that's what I heard.
Not sure.

1354
01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:34.710
Why are they getting poked and prodded by everybody?
You know?
It's just,
you know,

1355
01:30:34.770 --> 01:30:37.460
everyone gets chosen for something.
Yeah.
And that was that.

1356
01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:38.730
That's their thing being dumb.

1357
01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:43.500
<v 0>Yeah.
I remember the first time hearing those and I was like,</v>

1358
01:30:44.050 --> 01:30:45.220
hm,
I don't know.

1359
01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:47.500
<v 3>Yeah.
People are going after.
Does that make sense?
Well,</v>

1360
01:30:47.501 --> 01:30:50.590
at least they got some Hungarians don't even have anything.
Yeah.

1361
01:30:50.650 --> 01:30:54.700
We don't even have a stereotype that's a shitty,
or like a tree is,

1362
01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:59.290
by the way,
did we read this email of the guy who agreed with me?

1363
01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:03.970

I must agree with Tom in regards to the man getting crushed by a car.

1367
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:19.130
There was something wrong with you.
If that doesn't make you laugh.

1368
01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:23.660
It's those who can't see the humor in those things that are the real serial

1369
01:31:23.661 --> 01:31:28.350
killers.
Not sure if you have seen,

Must see will.
