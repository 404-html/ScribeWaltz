Should be very fun.
Yeah,

Alison Rosen.
Rosen's coming in.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.690
She's my new best friend.
She's everybody's.
She's my real life best friend.

9
00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:46.170
I love what I love Allison.
She's great.
Yeah,
no,

10
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:47.550
I'm very excited that she's joining us.

11
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:50.550
It's been a long time since I've seen Alison.
Yeah.
We had her on a,

12
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.540
my God maybe back in the Redondo days that long ago.
Yeah.
Well,
you know,

13
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:57.930
we didn't,
we took a hiatus from guests as we two years with no guests.

14
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.660
That's pretty nutty,
dude.
I have some people come up to me back then and go,
um,

15
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.250
so I just,
I guess I just,
I'm not allowed on your show.
You don't want to have me.

16
00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:10.920
And I'm a,
we haven't had someone in a couple of years and then they got,
yeah,

17
00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:13.710
okay.
Yeah.
Comedians are getting very offended and we're like,
no,

18
00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:16.380
it's just we don't have the space for years within.
Even now,

19
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.720
some people will be like,
Hey,
um,
I tweeted you about doing your show.

20
00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:24.600
I'm like,
what are you fucking 14 I know like dude,

21
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.410
send me a text or email me and not booking you from a fucking tweet.

22
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.020
Like you know me in real life we have phone numbers,
asshole or email.
Yeah.

23
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.730
Or people like Idm due.
I'm like,
on what?
I don't care.
I'm not,

24
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.950
I don't fucking look at my apps.
No.
And look at those messages or try Facebook.

25
00:01:40.951 --> 00:01:44.070
Do you?
So,
so does every other lunatic.
I know.

26
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.090
So we are not looking at Facebook messages.
Get your life.
Yeah,

27
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.350
I guess some people and also if you,
if you have something to send to the show,

28
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.300
don't fucking Facebook it.
Not so good.
More like,
oh,
I sent you a link.

29
00:01:56.301 --> 00:01:59.010
You never played it.
I'm like,
where did you send it?
I send it to you on Facebook.

30
00:01:59.011 --> 00:02:01.620
I'm like,
dude,
I've said it a hundred times on this show.
Yeah,

31
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.770
send it to the g male.
We don't go off of Facebook.
No,

32
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.930
I don't play stuff from tweets.
It's just the email account.
That's it.
Yeah.

33
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.830
There's a mom's podcasts,
right at Gmail.

34
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.400
There's a central place for a fucking reason,
man.
Yeah.

35
00:02:13.401 --> 00:02:18.130
There was no house in the email address.
Your mom's potash.
CAS as email,

36
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.120
send it there.
If you have a link,
if you have an instrumental,

37
00:02:21.121 --> 00:02:22.860
if you have a song you made,
that's where we,

38
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.800
that's what we check all the other shit.
I don't,
I don't check it.

39
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.520
I don't fucks with Lincoln debt.
I don't fucks with Lincoln.
Didn't,

40
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.900
no way not happening.
Oh my God.
I just,

41
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.680
I feel like I'm still burping up by a barbecue.
Oh,
let's tell them the story.
Oh,

42
00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:39.420
my phone.
Yeah.
Here's the,
uh,
ah,
I wasn't ready to die.

43
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.260
All right,
here we go.
Here's the open.
No,
so this one,
Ooh.
Almost fucked that up.

44
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.880
All right.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Here we go.

45
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:48.743
Here we go.

46
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.130
<v 2>So there is a trend line here,</v>

47
00:02:51.131 --> 00:02:55.990
which means that richer countries tend to have lower rates of open defecation

48
00:02:55.991 --> 00:03:00.490
then third countries.
But India then,
Huh?
Really

49
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.670
<v 0>far from that trend line outlier.</v>

50
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.760
<v 1>It looks different.
It's not centered.</v>

51
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.240
<v 0>What's going on?
You want me to send her at Harlan?
Boy,
that looks really weird.</v>

52
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.263
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

53
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.260
<v 0>All right.
Better?
I think so.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
That looks funny to me.</v>

54
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.650
I Dunno.
We can never get these fucking things locked off.
Right

55
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.280
work.
Yes,
I know,
but I'm saying we got the next week it'll be like,

56
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.900
I know we need to get these cameras mounted on the walls.
A blue man.

57
00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:56.400
That's your next project,
dude.
We talked about it.
We thought we would discuss it.

58
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.001
Um,

59
00:03:57.001 --> 00:04:00.840
I think this might be my favorite intro clip of all time because you were going

60
00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:03.420
to love it.
Well,
it incorporates some of my favorite elements.

61
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.790
There's the intelligence of the Tedx talk,

62
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.850
the seriousness with which she's talking about it.
Yeah.

63
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.380
And then shitting in public,
uh,
brought this up.
So,

64
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.120
oh my God.
I was listening to episode four 37 and choosers talking about India.

65
00:04:18.121 --> 00:04:21.150
And I remembered a youtube hole I fell into last week.

66
00:04:21.151 --> 00:04:25.630
There's a Ted talk about the awareness of shitting in public course.

67
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.710
I had to watch and 32 would enjoy and love the podcasts,

68
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.370
constantly laugh out loud and get strange looks at home from the wife Ben Bad

69
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.530
Ben.
Yeah,
because we were talking about public defecation.

70
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.630
That's a really big problem in India.

71
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.400
And you ever talk about that with your Stepdad?
Is that how this came up?
Well,
no,

72
00:04:44.401 --> 00:04:46.290
not about that.
But when he came to the states,

73
00:04:46.291 --> 00:04:48.480
he didn't know that you could sit down on western toilets.

74
00:04:48.481 --> 00:04:49.770
You thought you stood on them,
right?
Yeah.

75
00:04:49.771 --> 00:04:53.070
So he would be squatting and his roommate walked in on him once and was like,

76
00:04:53.071 --> 00:04:56.130
what are you doing bro?
And he didn't know that you could just sit directly down.

77
00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.990
Uh,
but no,
he wasn't.
He didn't shit in public or anything.
No,
but I remember we,

78
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.900
I remember we were talking about public shitting.
Yeah.

79
00:05:03.901 --> 00:05:06.390
And it's a problem in India.
It really is.
Cause they,
they,

80
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.440
they're trying to curb it right now and people are upset about it apparently.

81
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.910
And they don't know.
They don't want to be,

82
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.430
they don't want to be told not to do that.
Yeah.
I mean,

83
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.390
imagine you're used to it and then someone's like keep,
it's like a toddler.

84
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.570
Like you can't do that because it's,

85
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.000
it's great that anytime you have the urge to shit,

86
00:05:21.001 --> 00:05:23.980
you would just drop trial and just go.
Yeah.

87
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.460
It's crazy.
It's crazy.
Yeah.
It's crazy.
Like aren't you,
I mean,

88
00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:33.480
it's directly related to poverty.
I don't know if it's,
you know,

89
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.930
the funniest thing we've ever talked about this.

90
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.040
I don't know why a man that makes me laugh.
I've seen a guy shit in an alley.

91
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.160
We were,
we were thinking about living.
I saw a guy,
shit downtown.

92
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.730
I'm just going to talk about,
it's a time we were looking at lofts.

93
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.640
We were considering this.
The same guy.
Yeah.
America.
Yes.
And the alley and memory.

94
00:05:52.641 --> 00:05:55.530
And he was,
he was standing,
he was barely squatting.
That was,

95
00:05:55.531 --> 00:05:59.200
that's what I remember most about it.
He would just,
he would,

96
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.930
he was bent at the waist like he was,

97
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.210
he was leaning over a just try to see something,
you know,

98
00:06:04.211 --> 00:06:06.980
it's almost like look down there and you just lean.
That's how he was shitting.

99
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.580
I remember him vividly.
It's so funny you have the same memory of that.

100
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.080
I think he had mental problems so,
no,
I think so.
Oh,

101
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.840
stop it.
I would guess you don't wait.

102
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:21.800
You don't think he was like a banker or a lawyer?
I don't think so.

103
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.280
I think it was also because he was barefoot that gave that away.

104
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.450
I mean maybe it was Saturday.
Was his day off?

105
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.240
If you don't recall the weather that day,

106
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.050
it was a hot summer day downtown.

107
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.430
Almost moved it downtown.
How nasty would that have been?
It's,

108
00:06:39.431 --> 00:06:41.750
it's popping right now.
Places that's where it's at,

109
00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:46.751
but it's not our lifestyle now cause we like the country club and suburbia.

110
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.120
Yeah,
that's urban living,
man.
Could you imagine?

111
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.390
Here's a problem with downtown La is they're like,
well,
okay,

112
00:06:53.391 --> 00:06:57.470
the rent is like five grand.
It's crazy.
Oh,
did,
did you want to park?
Okay.

113
00:06:57.471 --> 00:07:00.620
That's another thousand dollars and that's five blocks from here.

114
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:02.360
And then you've got to walk in the middle of the night.

115
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.630
They're literally the price people out it down.

116
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.920
Do you guys don't know if you don't know la well,

117
00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:11.150
but they used to be such an undesirable place to live and not even a long time

118
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:13.370
ago.
Wasteland.
Yeah.
I mean,

119
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:16.940
we're talking in the last decade downtown has completely changed.

120
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.530
It literally was a place where they just pushed all the homeless into those

121
00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:25.250
Igloo houses.
It was just a place for homeless people and crack heads.

122
00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:29.390
All the homeless were mostly,
you'd see them the most in the toy district,

123
00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:32.830
which was,
I always thought that was so ironic.
You know the terrifying coin.

124
00:07:32.831 --> 00:07:37.831
We make toys for little kids and you see like guys walking naked across the

125
00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:39.430
street and you still,

126
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.920
and that's the thing is then it's not a hundred percent cleaned up.

127
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:47.150
So you'll go toilet strike once that sun goes down,
all the zombies come out.

128
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.120
And it is tariff.
What's south?
West?

129
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.910
Downtown is really nice.

130
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:58.130
Restaurants and art galleries and it's very hopping.

131
00:07:58.131 --> 00:08:02.180
It's very nice.
And if you're young and you're cool,
like that's the place to be.

132
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:06.380
You don't want your fucking kid looking at guys taking shits.
Maybe you do.

133
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:11.660
Um,
yeah.
So it's a real issue here.
You know,

134
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:17.720
<v 2>many households in rural India don't prioritize having a latrine.</v>

135
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.530
So let's compare India to some other countries in the world.

136
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.840
On the vertical axis of this graph,

137
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.690
we have the rate of open desiccation in the country.

138
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:31.310
<v 0>I mean this is an actual talk.
That's the crazy,</v>

139
00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:37.430
I know.
This is like,
you're a good serious,
she's smarter.

140
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.090
She's such a strong performer.
She's so smart.
No,

141
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.360
I know this girl smarter than both of us
and that's what she's spending her time.

142
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.240
<v 2>So there's a trend line here,</v>

143
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:51.950
which means that richer countries tend to have lower rates of open defecation.

144
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.210
But India is really far from me.

145
00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:03.140
<v 0>He met as an outlier
outlier used for that night.</v>

146
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.670
Neither of in,
in that way.

147
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.840
Usually it's for exceptional people and things.
What if,
what if the talk here

148
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:13.940
and that's what I want to address.

149
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.220
Nobody shits like we do and she dropped her pants and she takes a shit on stage.

150
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:28.220
My family comes from the line of high strong performing public desiccators.

151
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:33.693
Lot of shifts

152
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.440
<v 2>better poor than India on this graph,</v>

153
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.720
46 of them have a lower rate of open.

154
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.490
<v 0>I just love open defecation.
I've never even heard open devotees.</v>

155
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.190
Equine diarrhea.
It's one of those catchy phrase,
open defecation,

156
00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.860
equine diarrhea,
equine diarrhea,
diarrhea,
diarrhea,

157
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.480
open defecation.
Oh Man,

158
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:07.830
I've never heard those two words.

159
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.090
Open defecation.
Oh Man.
Have you ever shit outside?

160
00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:20.340
Never Shit outside.
No.
I don't think I have.
Not once.

161
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.750
Not once.
I peed outside a bunch,

162
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:29.340
but never,
never having been really shit my pants lately in a long time.

163
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.930
Although I gotta say yesterday could have happened damn.

164
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.470
Who were lounging and we were about to order.

165
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:42.180
It was like around lunchtime.
Like let's get some lunch.
What should we get?

166
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.550
And um,
you know,
you said,

167
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:48.230
I really feel like getting some Thai food and I just go,
okay,
I want it.
Flavors.

168
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.060
Yeah,
I down for it and let's do it.
Thai food.

169
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.070
And you say the place that you like,
the quality spot is closed.
They're not,

170
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.710
they're not.
Okay.
So then

171
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.610
all the other places give you open defecation,
use it.

172
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:07.430
Open defecation was coming up.
We had ordered so we can work from somewhere else.

173
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.760
Now they're dirty.

174
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.270
There's some nasty places around here like you don't want to even know about.

175
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:19.710
Yeah.
So,
so then the next move was,
um,
I go,
all right,

176
00:11:19.711 --> 00:11:22.840
what do I want?
And I was like,
I want something.
I want meat.

177
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:27.330
I had a steak,
you know,
the night before.
And probably two nights,

178
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.730
I just want something different.
Like,
oh,
let's do some barbecue.

179
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.390
And I bring up are different.
It's very different.

180
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.400
So I bring up one spot and you're like,
Nah,
I places open defecation.

181
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.620
So then we settle on another place and I'm doing it through,

182
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:49.230
I'm doing it through the APP and I got to watch the rest of the talk.

183
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:53.650
We're to know I'm going through the APP and I'm just Kinda,
you know,
I'm tired.

184
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.490
I just kind of,
I'm not really paying attention.
Like it's like,
what do you want?

185
00:11:57.491 --> 00:12:01.570
And you're like ribs cool.
Full rack.
Yeah.
Another one.
Yeah,
of course.
Full rack.

186
00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:05.910
Yes.
And then I'm hitting yes to like the signs and just Bup,
bup up,
bup,
bup.

187
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.660
You know I do the whole order in 20 seconds.

188
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:13.540
That guy drops it off at the house and when I saw a lot,
this is like a big bag

189
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:19.840
to see how many other people is a party in the back room or something.

190
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:24.280
So I start unloading the bag on the table and you're like,
Whoa,

191
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.700
this really is,
because you're pulling out like these metal bins,

192
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:35.800
like picnic style or people are like ripping lids off and it's like an 11 by 18

193
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:41.080
you're like,
what is this shit?
A lot.
It's a lot.
What did we do?

194
00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:46.570
We start unloading.
It is way too much food.
I mean there's way too much.

195
00:12:46.571 --> 00:12:51.010
So much.
Well we ordered okay.
A half slab of their onion rings.

196
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.940
Yeah,
but half order it was,
it's been enormous.

197
00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:59.230
Nobody can eat all of this.
Then you've got a baby back ribs and the beef ribs,

198
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.440
it looked like dinosaur ribs.

199
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:06.690
They were so enormous and they had candied get outta here but finish on them.

200
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:11.260
It sounds good.
But then I want to vomit.
I know it's too rich.

201
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.630
It was just overwhelming.
And it was also,

202
00:13:13.631 --> 00:13:15.520
I think it was good but it was too sweet.

203
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.470
And I burped it up until like 10 o'clock last night.
And like,
here's the thing,

204
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:25.390
we took shifts,
the shits smelled like barbecue.
The burps,

205
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.650
every bark I peed last night and my piece smelled like barbecue.

206
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:35.370
I don't know.
Infiltrated every orifice and,
and,
and system in my body.
Well,

207
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.220
cause I took it down.

208
00:13:36.221 --> 00:13:39.880
I took two shits this morning and I went in after you took your dumb and it

209
00:13:39.881 --> 00:13:43.730
smelled like barbecue.
My piss smelled like barbecue last night.
Crazy.

210
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.200
And then we see this is the thing,

211
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.790
you order these things called burnt ends.
And then I'm like,

212
00:13:51.791 --> 00:13:56.500
well what are they?
The ends of their dick tips.
What they do is they,
they,

213
00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:01.390
cause they use the whole cow or,
or wild.
They make this and they,

214
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.313
they,
uh,

215
00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:07.090
saute the dicks and then cut off the tips and the burnt ends.
That's what it did.

216
00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.380
That
the funny farm movie when he's eating the yeah,

217
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.790
the balls.
Yeah.
And they called them like rocky mountain oysters or something.

218
00:14:15.791 --> 00:14:19.090
Rocky Mountain Oysters.
Yeah.
These are just dick tips.

219
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:24.170
Just the tips and they're nice and Bert.
Really good.
Yeah.

220
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:26.740
Oh my God.
Piece of Bacon.
Oh my God.

221
00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:31.240
And the onion rings and then the and what else?
Oh,
corn.

222
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.960
We had corn on the cob.
It was too much.
Well anyways,

223
00:14:34.961 --> 00:14:37.060
we had fucking so many leftovers.

224
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:42.820
Tried to offer them up to people and I was trying to give them the neighbors and

225
00:14:42.821 --> 00:14:46.920
they were like,
no thanks.
No thanks.
Yeah,
that was bad.
You know,

226
00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:50.260
we haven't gone out like that in a while.
I tell you what,

227
00:14:50.261 --> 00:14:52.160
I've been reigning it in the second

228
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.530
<v 4>trimester.
I haven't,
I haven't really blown it up with my eating and that,</v>

229
00:14:56.531 --> 00:15:01.410
that was a,
we just went,
we went crazy.
I went for,
um,
for a walk after that.
Yeah.

230
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.610
After that meal,
just to like,
I felt like I owed it to myself.

231
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.980
I went for a lay down.
I had to lay down the rest of the day.

232
00:15:06.981 --> 00:15:11.840
I was so fucked up from it.
It was,
it was pretty wild.
No,
no good.
No good.

233
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:12.560
No good.

234
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.130
<v 0>I know there's,
there's some meals like that where you go,
I'm going to have the,</v>

235
00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.290
I had that and I'm good now for,

236
00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:23.250
<v 4>I don't like it.
I could have,
I can't,
I know I could not even eat last night.</v>

237
00:15:23.251 --> 00:15:25.560
And then this morning I didn't want to eat and like I'm pregnant.

238
00:15:25.561 --> 00:15:28.350
I have to eat like I was lighting,
excuse me,

239
00:15:28.351 --> 00:15:31.530
light headed this morning cause I'm like,
I physically don't want to eat anymore.

240
00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:36.060
Yeah.
What I have to anyways,
so you and I also,

241
00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:40.350
we don't normally watch these,
um,
you know,
Oscar movies.

242
00:15:40.351 --> 00:15:43.960
I think you and I kind of the outliers of the,
uh,

243
00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:47.460
that world where we don't give it,
I don't,
I generally don't give a shit.

244
00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:50.040
I don't care what wins awards and I don't want to see bomber.

245
00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.460
We don't like white bomber cancer.

246
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.530
The guy with one leg and I don't fucking know,
she still loves him anyway.

247
00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.870
I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to hear it.

248
00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:05.820
But we watched the shape of water.
Now you are away shooting your,
your movie.

249
00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:08.550
I watched it on the flight to shoot

250
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.290
<v 0>the very first flight there.
Okay.
Because I have,
the way that the,</v>

251
00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:16.970
the movie is set up is it's a a drop.
I'm,
I'm on a drop pickup schedule,

252
00:16:16.971 --> 00:16:21.020
it's called where they,
I shoot for a week and then I have a few days off,

253
00:16:21.021 --> 00:16:23.330
then I go back and I shoot and then I have a few days off.

254
00:16:23.331 --> 00:16:26.090
So it's back to reload your loads.
Right.
For the scenes.

255
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.050
So cause they literally take every ounce out of me.
Right?

256
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.760
Yeah.
Anyways,
I,
I have time off so,
but back and forth.
So anyways,

257
00:16:34.761 --> 00:16:38.150
on my flight there,
Octavia Spencer,

258
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.940
who's in shape of water is in this movie.

259
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.670
<v 4>She is,
yeah,
I didn't know that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I met her the other day.
You're kidding.</v>

260
00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:46.880
I didn't,
she's fantastic.
She's,
you know,

261
00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:50.780
I heard a story about her and my acting class that she was one of those people

262
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.880
that didn't hit it until much later.

263
00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.860
And she got turned down for Grey's anatomy and was like beside herself.

264
00:16:57.861 --> 00:17:00.410
Like she was one of the final people and casting to make it.

265
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:03.170
It's between her and this other chick and she didn't get it.

266
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.900
And she was like depressed for a year.
Well,

267
00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:08.670
what do you know the help comes around that movie.
Yeah.

268
00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.480
And because she didn't do Grey's anatomy.
Yeah.
Guess what?

269
00:17:11.481 --> 00:17:13.250
She's free to do the help and now,

270
00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.950
so it's like one of those wonderful stories and Showbiz.

271
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:19.130
I made a joke after that that her to the producers of the film,

272
00:17:19.131 --> 00:17:21.100
because it will sit in like a little video village.
Yeah.

273
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:24.650
And they laughed a little too hard.
I was like a,
I got,
oh,

274
00:17:24.651 --> 00:17:26.750
I was talking to Octavia.
She asked me if you could,
uh,

275
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:30.670
come by later for like some acting tips.
And they were like,
ah,

276
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.390
like laughing.
I'm,
they're like,
can I imagine you are teaching her how to act?

277
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:39.180
<v 0>I was like,
Huh.
They're like,
they're like wiping their eyes.</v>

278
00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:44.030
<v 4>I was like,
all right,
come on clown.
I was like,
okay,
go deliver your funny part.</v>

279
00:17:44.031 --> 00:17:44.820
Yeah.

280
00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:48.120
<v 0>She was very sweet though.
Very sweet.
Um,
but in that movie,</v>

281
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:52.790
the Michael Shannon Plays Richard the,
uh,

282
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.240
<v 4>my God in the shape of water.
No.
What else has he been in?</v>

283
00:17:56.241 --> 00:17:58.940
So people who haven't seen it,
Michael Shannon,
he's got,

284
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.990
he's one of those guys that you recognize immediately,
but I don't know that guy.

285
00:18:02.991 --> 00:18:06.760
He's such a good dead pan.
He's such a good,
miserable Dick.

286
00:18:06.761 --> 00:18:11.180
Like he's a great actor.
He's not,
he's so fantastic.

287
00:18:11.181 --> 00:18:14.420
He's got a great face.
He looks like it eats rocks.
Yeah.
This guy.

288
00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:20.390
<v 0>Oh,
I just love him.
He was,
um,
let's see.</v>

289
00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:25.040
Oh,
he did at home with Amy Sedaris.
How funny.
I love that show too.
It's so silly.

290
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:29.380
Yeah.
It was like,
he does 10 boardwalk empire.
He,

291
00:18:29.381 --> 00:18:32.330
I remember him when he played that,
uh,
that killer.
Um,

292
00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:37.890
of course Richard person remember that.
Okay.
Who's that movie?
The iceman seat.

293
00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.780
Yeah.
I ain't got to Tom's favorite.
A member that one mud.

294
00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.240
That's similarly,
we named our son after.

295
00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.800
He's somebody you've seen a hundred times.
He's always the creeper.
Yeah.

296
00:18:48.801 --> 00:18:53.270
He's a good creeper.
God Damn,
you've got a real,
he's got a real serious creeper.

297
00:18:53.271 --> 00:18:57.560
Look to him like his eyes look like,
you know?
Yeah.

298
00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:58.993
He looks like he's,

299
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
he means fucking was going to fucking rape.

300
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.060
Yeah.
Yeah.

301
00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:08.100
<v 4>He's very serious actors.
So you were watching the shape of water?</v>

302
00:19:08.101 --> 00:19:11.270
I actually wanted to see it because I saw a trailer for it and I,

303
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:15.030
and I liked that.
Guillermo,
what's his name?
I like,

304
00:19:15.031 --> 00:19:19.120
I like Latin filmmakers.
I like whatever he's,
yeah.

305
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:23.040
So I wanted to see it and I knew you watched it and I was bummed that you'd

306
00:19:23.041 --> 00:19:26.670
watched it.
So sometimes we watch movies when you're away,

307
00:19:26.671 --> 00:19:29.400
we watch them together and then we'll kind of recap together.

308
00:19:29.401 --> 00:19:30.900
It's like we watched it together kind of thing.

309
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:36.090
Now Richard is a character he plays,
I don't want to give away too much,

310
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:42.170
but in our estimation,
this guy has the comedic relief of the home

311
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.460
<v 0>movie.
Absolutely.
By far,</v>

312
00:19:44.461 --> 00:19:48.390
the funniest guy in the movie is Richard Michael Show.
Holy Shit.

313
00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.870
He has the best lines.
Funniest guy.

314
00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:55.380
And then I was watching the movie and I was,
I was definitely laughing.
I'm again,

315
00:19:55.381 --> 00:19:58.530
I'm on the flight watching it and I'm laughing at some of the stuff,

316
00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:02.460
but then there's a part in the movie,
so I call you.
I tell you,
I saw the movie,

317
00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:06.600
I tell you it's a good movie.
And I go,
I lost my shit.

318
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.370
Like I really laughed hysterically like member last week or a few weeks ago
when,

319
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:16.620
when a blue band made me laugh so hard with labeling the file.
Yeah.

320
00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:20.270
<v 4>That's by the way,
sidebar,
my favorite titles,</v>

321
00:20:20.271 --> 00:20:23.420
forever clips have been guy who's as long infection,

322
00:20:23.421 --> 00:20:27.440
his instrument and homeless man gets raped by gay goes.
Yes,
go ahead.

323
00:20:27.441 --> 00:20:28.610
I had to say before I forgot it.

324
00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:29.570
<v 0>Yeah,
but so go.</v>

325
00:20:29.571 --> 00:20:34.571
So I'm sitting there laughing so hard and I tell you this and you go,

326
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:36.220
oh,

327
00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:41.220
I'm going to watch it and I bet you I can guess what is the,

328
00:20:41.351 --> 00:20:44.560
uh,
what you laughed at.
And I was like,
oh,
this is a great game.

329
00:20:44.561 --> 00:20:48.210
This is by the way,
homeless man.

330
00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.353
Um,

331
00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.690
one of the original,
uh,

332
00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:00.490
we should play this for doctor drew when he comes to homeless is going on there.

333
00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:03.790
Put that on the list were Dr drew anyway.

334
00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:08.570
And then it was so fun because I would wake up and I would be,
you know,
to,

335
00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:12.570
to shoot a movie,
you get up,
you fucking call times like seven 30 in the West,

336
00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:16.840
have to be there.
And then the cruise there at four.
Oh,
it's crazy.
Crazy.

337
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.780
It is long hours.
But it's been,
I've had the best time on this,

338
00:21:19.781 --> 00:21:23.500
but the fun thing is I would wake up and because we're three hours apart,

339
00:21:23.501 --> 00:21:26.560
I would wake up and you,
and it'd be all your guests.
You'd be like,
oh.

340
00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:29.230
So I would wake up,
I check my phone and you'd be like,
it wasn't this or that.

341
00:21:29.231 --> 00:21:32.550
And then you'd be sleeping.
So I'd write back like great guest.

342
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.570
I did laugh at that,
but that's not the moment.

343
00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:39.430
And then I'd get off of the work and you'd have new guesses in there.

344
00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:44.490
It was a fun game and it's fun because I feel like every time Richard opens his

345
00:21:44.501 --> 00:21:48.970
mouth,
it could have been a moment because it takes place in the 60s so it's very

346
00:21:48.971 --> 00:21:51.970
inappropriate,
very sexist,
very racist time.

347
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.440
And that's the best part is that Richard is like totally indicative of that era.

348
00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:59.230
Oh,
he's a piece of shit and it makes me laugh.

349
00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:03.620
I love that stuff that makes me laugh so hard.
The inappropriateness.
Sure.

350
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.640
And he had so many great moments and I,

351
00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.930
I'm not going to give away too much,

352
00:22:10.931 --> 00:22:13.810
but it definitely wasn't ultra violent part and I hadn't,

353
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:16.470
I was off by a moment like I feel like,
right.

354
00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:21.170
And the moment that you cited was like funny did it,

355
00:22:21.171 --> 00:22:23.860
did you giggle?
I feel like the moment that you,

356
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:28.580
that you thought it was actually made me go like,
oh,
okay,

357
00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:33.580
oh my God.
Oh,
okay.
And then like a hint of joy,

358
00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:38.830
but in an Oh my God way,
you know,
like,
Oh shit.

359
00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:42.460
But the part that actually what I told you made me laugh.
Fuck that.

360
00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:43.990
I laugh so hard.

361
00:22:43.991 --> 00:22:48.820
And of course what made me laugh the hardest was a,

362
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.270
the act of what I was witnessing and like that,
that it was happening,

363
00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:57.130
but also the other actors in the scene being there,

364
00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:02.200
same as like that Henry a thing.
It wasn't so much that he did it.

365
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:05.770
It's that the other accurate people are there going like,
Holy Shit,

366
00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.450
just for the people that have seen this movie,

367
00:23:07.451 --> 00:23:11.860
I know how annoying this conversation,
so I won't give anything away.

368
00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:16.860
I'll say the scene that I thought it was a Tom would find the funniest,

369
00:23:17.411 --> 00:23:22.390
let's just say there's a gunshot and an extraordinary place and the way Richard

370
00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.170
handles it handles the man literally bananas.

371
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.730
So I thought for sure that was number one.
Yeah.

372
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:31.030
There's a part where he gets romantic with his wife.

373
00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:34.000
That doesn't make me laugh too.
That's definitely on the lawyer was,
yeah,

374
00:23:34.001 --> 00:23:36.940
that was,
that was very funny when he was,
when he made love to his wife.

375
00:23:36.941 --> 00:23:38.050
Hilarious.
Yes.

376
00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:43.740
But the moment that won that I wasn't aware of is it has to do with his fingers.

377
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:45.980
Yeah.
Which is a constant

378
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.550
<v 4>theme of Casa theme,
but uh,
their demise or how that,</v>

379
00:23:50.551 --> 00:23:54.620
how way,
how they,
uh,
how that storyline kind of finishes.

380
00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.970
Let's put it there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now,
when I told you,
what did you think,

381
00:23:58.971 --> 00:24:02.660
did you go back to remembering that scene?
I did.
And I,

382
00:24:02.661 --> 00:24:07.160
and I thought like that makes sense because a,
it's really inappropriate.
Yeah.
Be,

383
00:24:07.161 --> 00:24:10.510
it's extremely painful and vulgar.
Yeah.

384
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:13.640
And you're enough of a derelict,

385
00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:16.910
a degenerate to find that funny,
that moment.

386
00:24:16.911 --> 00:24:20.510
Because that moment by definition for me was,
it wasn't funny.
What did,

387
00:24:20.511 --> 00:24:23.510
what were you going through during the scene?
That one was more like,
oh,

388
00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:26.030
that was an interesting choice for him.
Like I literally,

389
00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:27.800
I didn't get grossed out.
I was like,
cause I could,

390
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:30.950
I knew that was going to happen eventually cause that's kind of guy he is.

391
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:32.263
And I was like,

392
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:37.310
oh that would suck to pick two to clean up is what my thought was for her,

393
00:24:37.311 --> 00:24:41.450
for Octavia Spencer being like,
Oh dude,
yeah,
she's got to clean that up.

394
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:45.470
This poor woman cleans for a living and now she's got to clean this fucking

395
00:24:45.471 --> 00:24:49.970
thing,
you know?
Yeah.
But I didn't,
I didn't think that that was the funniest.
No,

396
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:53.960
no.
Yeah.
So you know,

397
00:24:53.961 --> 00:24:58.850
you think you know your spouse and then,
yeah,
I'm very funny.
All right.

398
00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:02.620
Jesus.
Everything okay.
Yeah.
I'm just going to check on stuff here,

399
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.980
making sure everything's okay.
Well,
some other interesting things going on.

400
00:25:06.981 --> 00:25:09.280
You mentioned to me that,
uh,

401
00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:12.000
you have some changes in your own family dynamics.

402
00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:20.390
You know,
I,
I don't know,
man.
I got it.
I got it.
Yeah.
Okay.

403
00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:22.320
I just wonder sometimes,
like,

404
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:27.350
am I related to anybody who's remotely fucking functional and normal?

405
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:31.550
Like what do you think?
You've know,
you know,
all my relatives,
uh,

406
00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:35.630
is there anybody that is just a fucking normal and,

407
00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.390
and I know people,
what is normal?
Okay,
here's,
here's what is normal.

408
00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:44.070
No personality disorder,
uh,
no alcoholism or drug addiction.

409
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:48.930
No severe depression that cripples you or prevents you from doing things in

410
00:25:48.931 --> 00:25:53.730
life.
Yeah.
A functioning,
you know what I'm saying?
Like,
that's what I'm saying.

411
00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:57.190
Okay.
Yeah.
So let's,
let's,
let's do that.
So,
uh,

412
00:25:57.191 --> 00:26:00.930
I haven't talked to my father in a while for various reasons.
I won't go into,

413
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:04.860
but let's just say we,
you know,
we're not,
we're not speaking right now,
but,

414
00:26:04.861 --> 00:26:09.450
so I heard through the grape vine through,
uh,
my cousin,
uh,

415
00:26:09.451 --> 00:26:14.280
that celebration,
a celebration is in order that I,

416
00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:19.130
I apparently have a new stepmom.
Really?
Yeah.

417
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:22.400
You sent me this image.
Does this right?

418
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:30.390
I think she's a little older and then what I'm talking about.
Okay.

419
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.500
So apparently my dad married a Vietnamese woman.

420
00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:39.340
He met online and uh,

421
00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.660
she's 34

422
00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.190
<v 5>now.
Make sure you end gang.</v>

423
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.370
<v 4>There's my,
there's my new mom guys,
don't you dare make fun of my new motto.</v>

424
00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:56.460
Right.
So,
and we've been watching age gap love,

425
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:59.700
and it turns out I have a real age gap.
Love in my life.

426
00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:03.080
<v 0>You do page.
Got Glove is fantastic.</v>

427
00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:05.660
I'm so hooked on that show.

428
00:27:05.661 --> 00:27:09.800
I've never been so into a show on Netflix.

429
00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.950
And it basically just features people from all over the world,

430
00:27:12.951 --> 00:27:16.070
which is also one of my favorite parts of it.
It's not just in one area.

431
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:18.230
There's a lot in the UK,
but they're also,

432
00:27:18.231 --> 00:27:21.110
they go through other parts of Europe here in the United States.

433
00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:24.620
They've been just featuring all these different couples,

434
00:27:24.621 --> 00:27:27.770
men and women where sometimes the man is much older than the woman,

435
00:27:27.771 --> 00:27:28.760
sometimes vice versa,

436
00:27:28.761 --> 00:27:33.200
which is even more interesting I think when you see the older woman and the

437
00:27:33.201 --> 00:27:33.770
younger.

438
00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:38.770
And then yesterday that episode featured an older woman who's married for the

439
00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.390
ninth time,

440
00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:48.280
ninth time and she married a guy.

441
00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:54.550
Her knife marriage definitely has some developmental problems.

442
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:59.390
Oh,
he's touched.
Yeah,
I mean he was mouth breathing.
It was weird.
He was,

443
00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:01.240
it was very weird.

444
00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:05.260
<v 4>Um,
but what do you think's happening in like my dad's situation?</v>

445
00:28:05.261 --> 00:28:07.960
Like she's 30 I don't know anything about it.
I don't know anything about it,

446
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:12.970
but I'm just saying like,
I mean it,
it sounds like true love.
It's all I'm saying.

447
00:28:12.971 --> 00:28:17.971
Like you come from a poverty stricken place and you meet like a nice 71 year old

448
00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:23.380
guy.
Like I'm sure it's just,
yeah.
You know what I mean?

449
00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:25.570
<v 0>Yeah,
I know what you mean.</v>

450
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.880
<v 5>Yeah,
go ahead.</v>

451
00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:36.530
<v 4>This,
the voicemail that she left you,
could you imagine?</v>

452
00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:41.090
We have to have her over for like thanksgiving.
Oh my God.

453
00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:44.390
It's a good thing we're not speaking right now because I can't handle that shit.

454
00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.590
What?
Just the language,

455
00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:50.290
the language and then having to pretend like it's normal.
Oh,

456
00:28:50.291 --> 00:28:53.930
that they got married and everything.
Like,
oh my mom is my new mom.

457
00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:58.880
My third mom is like younger than me and what?

458
00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:00.560
It's fucking crazy.

459
00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:05.630
<v 0>But I don't know anything that's going on.
I mean,
I don't know.
It's,
it's uh,</v>

460
00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.500
it's curious to say the least.
I know.

461
00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:13.760
I knew he liked to party online and meet people.
He's very social.

462
00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:18.050
He would take a lot of trips left if she's like,
you want to fuck with mine.

463
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:21.590
Could be,
I'd be like,
damn,
you're that girl.
What if that was her?

464
00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:26.330
That I can be exciting if she was at check.
Yeah.
She's like,

465
00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.040
you gotta Get to Jab.

466
00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:37.883
<v 5>Okay.</v>

467
00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:42.030
<v 4>I don't know what's up with my parents and like the remarriage to the,</v>

468
00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:44.050
the like the Third World honeys they bought,

469
00:29:44.051 --> 00:29:49.051
my mother liked Indian guys and then my dad's marrying open defecation too.

470
00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:53.160
You're a,
your pops had a girl for a while.

471
00:29:53.161 --> 00:29:55.720
It's called the marriage would have been to her.
I know you,

472
00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.030
it's always a wild card with my family.

473
00:29:58.031 --> 00:30:01.930
Just when you think they're gonna do the normal thing,
nope.
Change leads,

474
00:30:01.931 --> 00:30:05.170
then you're going to check in to find out what's going on at all.
You know why?

475
00:30:05.171 --> 00:30:09.100
You know,
I had to put down a boundary and a,
I have to hold,

476
00:30:09.101 --> 00:30:13.930
I have to maintain.
I think it's only right.
But you know,
I,
I,
uh,

477
00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:18.760
good luck and uh,
wow.
What an interesting turn of events.

478
00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:23.320
It's a nice way of putting it.
Yeah,
that is some,
do you think that Vietnam,

479
00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:34.180
do you think Vietnam is an open defecation country?
I mean,
and in rural parts?

480
00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:37.810
Yeah,
but I think know in the big cities,
no,
I don't think so.

481
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:46.150
Do you think he really rubs her?
Grabs him?

482
00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:53.020
Jesus.
What?
I think what?

483
00:30:53.021 --> 00:30:57.040
Don't make fun of my mom's accent.
That's how my mommy talks guys.

484
00:30:57.041 --> 00:30:58.600
I have a new Vietnamese mom.

485
00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:04.080
Kimmy has way too old that would never work.

486
00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:09.130
Imagine what she could put on your dad though with her experience.
Kim.
Man,

487
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:13.900
that'd be a match made in heaven.
Oh my God.
What if she's like,

488
00:31:13.901 --> 00:31:16.340
you better respect me.
I'm your Mama

489
00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:19.683
older.

490
00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:29.560
What would you do if your dad,
your mom dies and like,
that's,

491
00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:33.190
that's your replacement mom,
your new mom.
I can't wrap my head around it.

492
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:38.170
It's so different.
I mean,
because of their different lives.

493
00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:42.070
My parents in yours.
Yeah.

494
00:31:42.071 --> 00:31:46.450
It's always weird when your step mom's like the younger younger model and you're

495
00:31:46.451 --> 00:31:48.760
like,
ah,
that's creating this so weird.
Well,
yeah,

496
00:31:48.761 --> 00:31:52.930
because everyone's natural thought would be like,
oh,

497
00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:57.820
like you're just trying to get something from,
no,
no.

498
00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:04.060
Wait a minute.
Don't you believe in love?
I love love.
How dare you.

499
00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:08.890
I believe in love.
I can't believe you'd intimate such a thing.
No,
it's all,

500
00:32:08.891 --> 00:32:11.270
it's all,
it's all on the up and up.
Yeah.

501
00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.880
Happy thanksgiving.
My mom,

502
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:24.780
he make fiber.
You can make funny
first to me.

503
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:30.880
This is my third mom.
Gosh,

504
00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:37.510
so crazy.
Yeah.
Well we'll see how it goes.

505
00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:40.340
You know,
third time's a charm.
It could be

506
00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:46.340
when,
uh,
when I die.
Who are you going to marry?
This is an interesting one.

507
00:32:46.341 --> 00:32:50.030
We've had this talk a bunch.
You're,
you seem to be like,

508
00:32:50.031 --> 00:32:53.150
sometimes we'll go down like a jokey path and then you're like,
oh,

509
00:32:53.151 --> 00:32:56.300
it's gotta be a comic.
You got to be married to a comic.
I'm sure.
Well,

510
00:32:56.301 --> 00:33:00.020
because I think you'd be bored with someone who's normal.

511
00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:05.540
I Dunno.
I would just someone that doesn't have a warped sense of reality,

512
00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:08.000
I think you get bored real quick.

513
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:12.270
I would get bored if somebody didn't have a depraved kind of sense of humor or

514
00:33:12.271 --> 00:33:15.530
at least at least would not.
I'm willing to play ball with mine

515
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.960
last night on age gap love.
There's one that was a total four corners,

516
00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:26.060
like she's 50 years old and she was such a fun,
like no fun.

517
00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:29.550
Yeah.
Yeah.
I couldn't be married to that.
You're right.
No,

518
00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:34.160
no,
no.
You died.
I don't know.

519
00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:37.040
I could do a comic again cause just cause you're the only one that makes me

520
00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:41.930
laugh.
Really?
Oh,
come on.
Somebody else can make you laugh.
No,

521
00:33:41.931 --> 00:33:42.770
not like you.

522
00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:47.440
Like we know each other so well and he had to get used to another person's

523
00:33:47.441 --> 00:33:51.800
smells and another person's whole thing.
It'd be such an effort to get remarried,

524
00:33:51.801 --> 00:33:56.210
don't you think?
Yes.
Can you ask for a text?

525
00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:00.320
Yeah.
And this might be the groceries though.
Let me stop.
All right.

526
00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.240
We took our little break.
We're back.

527
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:06.350
<v 6>Oh.
And I'm so excited because the fan of field is fabulous.
I'm just,</v>

528
00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:11.410
I was going to say fantastic and I wanted to say fabulous,
fabulous.

529
00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:15.820
Phen Fad.
Okay.
Then Allison,
a Rosen's here.

530
00:34:15.821 --> 00:34:20.390
Yay so much for having me.
I love being here.
I love you guys.

531
00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:24.440
You Christina have given me so much advice in my life.
No,

532
00:34:24.441 --> 00:34:27.560
it's all been good.
It's been,
I feel like when you and I met,

533
00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.280
we had a sort of like peer to peer relationship and then somehow it's turned

534
00:34:31.281 --> 00:34:33.420
into me just reaching out when I'm like,

535
00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:37.160
I have like looked at Instagram too much and I feel terrible and then you give

536
00:34:37.161 --> 00:34:41.060
me perspective.
No,
are you kidding me?
You're,
you're an inspiration to me.

537
00:34:41.061 --> 00:34:44.660
And you've written a book,
which is crazy.
What's the book?

538
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:48.350
It's called tropical attire encouraged and other phrases that scare me and it's

539
00:34:48.351 --> 00:34:49.730
a collection of essays.

540
00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:54.380
And my husband did the illustrations inside and tropical attire encouraged.

541
00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.710
Uh,
I was invited to a party,

542
00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:01.970
a bunch of skinny blonde woman invited me to a party and the invite said

543
00:35:01.971 --> 00:35:06.590
tropical attire.
I didn't go because I didn't have Tiki clothing.

544
00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.790
And that does what pulled you out of it?
Just the,
that phrase.
Just that phrase.

545
00:35:10.791 --> 00:35:11.960
Yeah.
Cause I'm like,
I can't go,

546
00:35:11.961 --> 00:35:15.290
I can't wear a sweater and jeans even though I want to,

547
00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:18.590
so I'm just going to write about it and stuff.
So true though,

548
00:35:18.591 --> 00:35:21.500
that something like that can just turn you off from doing something.

549
00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:25.460
But who are the people who see that and they're like,
yes,
I know.

550
00:35:25.461 --> 00:35:28.400
That's kind of what that,
that particular essay is about.

551
00:35:28.401 --> 00:35:31.280
Just like who are the people who are looking for another opportunity to peel it

552
00:35:31.281 --> 00:35:34.280
all off.
Tell me about how to have the idea of,

553
00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:38.340
did that lead to you get like saying I want to write a book?
Well No,

554
00:35:38.341 --> 00:35:41.970
so I had a syndicated column is actually a fun backstory to this book.

555
00:35:41.971 --> 00:35:44.490
I had a syndicated column and uh,

556
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:48.780
my husband took all the columns from the first year I was syndicated.
He's very,

557
00:35:48.781 --> 00:35:52.080
very creative and like he'll decide he wants to make something and then he'll

558
00:35:52.081 --> 00:35:53.250
look up how to do it online.

559
00:35:53.251 --> 00:35:57.420
And he presented me for my birthday that year with a hand bound book that he

560
00:35:57.421 --> 00:36:02.160
made himself and he had illustrated each column and he did it cause I had been

561
00:36:02.161 --> 00:36:05.340
wanting to do a book for a long time and I think he did it to show me,
look,

562
00:36:05.341 --> 00:36:06.270
you've already written a book.

563
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:11.250
And also to show me up in terms of giving gifts because I am terrible at giving

564
00:36:11.251 --> 00:36:15.840
gifts.
He's a really good,
and I feel like that year he's like,
I finally won.
Yeah.

565
00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.210
Well,
we've already know Alison Rosen.

566
00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:23.210
She has a wildly successful podcast called Alison Rosen is your new best friend.

567
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:26.460
She's been at your mom's house.
How many times you've been on our show leak?

568
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:30.270
Just one.
Just one.
It back backward.
I wasn't on that steep bro.
And that's deep,

569
00:36:30.271 --> 00:36:34.080
Bro.
Who Played Tom or black?

570
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:40.710
Jesus.
Must be like four or five years.
It was a long time ago.

571
00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:43.080
That's a long time ago.
Anyway,
this is,

572
00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:47.370
you know what I love about Allison's voice and her whole perspective,
um,

573
00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:52.140
I went to Hooters is the title of one of the chapters.
Goodbye underpants.

574
00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:57.480
No chips,
no nuts.
I feel like you are the Inter,
I do not enjoy dancing.

575
00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.810
Like you're the inner voice of every human being,

576
00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:05.730
but it's the stuff that people are afraid to admit to.
Thank you.
So Nice.

577
00:37:05.731 --> 00:37:10.350
I just captured that stuff so well that you're so vulnerable and it's so much

578
00:37:10.351 --> 00:37:15.000
fun and I love it.
Thank you.
Yeah.
So the,
the Hooters thing,
that was weird.

579
00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:19.200
Um,
I was on the [inaudible] show for years and you know,

580
00:37:19.201 --> 00:37:21.880
we all had access to the calendar so we could see who the guests were,

581
00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:23.820
what live shows where you know everything.

582
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:28.470
And all of a sudden one day like Hooters pops up and we had a live podcast

583
00:37:28.471 --> 00:37:31.230
scheduled at Hooters and I had never been to Hooters and I don't think of myself

584
00:37:31.231 --> 00:37:35.310
as a prude and yet I was very uncomfortable knowing that we were going to be

585
00:37:35.311 --> 00:37:38.250
doing a show at Hooters.
Even having not been there before.

586
00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:43.290
I think because I hadn't been there before and I do,
it wasn't,
it wasn't about,

587
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.690
I don't want to be in a Hooters environment.

588
00:37:45.691 --> 00:37:49.320
I think it was that I don't want to be standing next to Hooters women because I

589
00:37:49.321 --> 00:37:51.690
feel like I'm going to be objectified in a negative way.

590
00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:54.180
Like I'm not going to measure up.
You think that the,

591
00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:58.020
the gentlemen there are going to be comparing you to the waitresses and being

592
00:37:58.021 --> 00:38:02.410
like,
that chick's not a Hooters girl.
Right,

593
00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:07.530
exactly.
I guess that's,
I guess that's what I was worried about.
Um,

594
00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:10.620
and then people reassured me like it's really just a,

595
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:14.800
a wings place with women in,
it's so much taller than that,
Alison.
Well,

596
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.680
I mean it's that so much more than that.

597
00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:22.560
It's a place where dads can go and feel like girls like them again.

598
00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:25.920
That's true.
That's the job.
That's the job.
And then they're like,
hey,

599
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:27.270
my name's Mandy.

600
00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:31.320
And then they write their name on the tablecloths smoke yet I see.
You know,

601
00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:32.820
that's funny.
You really know the whole drill.

602
00:38:32.821 --> 00:38:36.040
Don't fight at all men because my husband is the one who reassured

603
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.220
<v 0>me and I was like,
oh,
I didn't know you had been to Hooters this anytime.
No,</v>

604
00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.290
it's embarrassing as a guy,
I'm not going to.

605
00:38:41.291 --> 00:38:45.670
Hooters is when you end up at Hooters with a group you,

606
00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:50.290
this is how my mind works.
You want the server to know that you're not like them.

607
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:53.320
So you're like,
oh,
you're like the cool guy.
Yeah.

608
00:38:53.321 --> 00:38:56.950
That you're not like trying to drop dad jokes on them or like being like,

609
00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:01.240
oh do they make those shorts any shorter?
They're like one of those guys.

610
00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:04.120
So like what I do is I completely shut down.

611
00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:07.360
Whereas some of the guys turn it on,

612
00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.780
I shut it down so that in my mind at least I'm going,

613
00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:15.280
you're not being that guy.
So I'll like avert eye contact.

614
00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:17.170
I'll just be like,
yeah,
I'm no,
no thanks.

615
00:39:17.171 --> 00:39:18.850
And when they do like their smiley thing,

616
00:39:18.851 --> 00:39:22.610
especially because that's when the dads really light up,
when she's loving,

617
00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:27.130
she's like,
what?
Extra shrimp sauce with that?
And they're like,
I do.

618
00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:30.730
I'll just be like,
no,
I'm fine.
Like that's your game,
Tom.

619
00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:35.290
Mandy,
Mitzi to fall in love with it.
Cause she's like,

620
00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.530
he's not like the other dads.
I feel like he's nagging me.

621
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:42.210
Oh we learned that from mystery or whatever.
Yeah.

622
00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:46.120
But I'm doing it out of not to get her,
I'm doing it because I'm so embarrassed.

623
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:53.550
I'm embarrassed to be amongst the people who are acting that way and I don't

624
00:39:53.771 --> 00:39:57.260
want to be thrown in with them.
So you're saying that when you're at Hooters,

625
00:39:57.261 --> 00:39:58.420
do you try to act like,

626
00:39:58.421 --> 00:40:00.760
I'm not like these guys who are my friends that I'm here with,

627
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:03.540
but are they doing the same thing?
Well look,

628
00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:06.190
I haven't been to a Hooters in quite some time,

629
00:40:06.191 --> 00:40:09.880
but I feel like the last time I went it wasn't like me and my friends were
going,

630
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.020
let's go to Hooters.

631
00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:15.250
It was probably when I was working in a office like production job.

632
00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:20.150
And so you're going with people who you're actually not your friends coworkers.

633
00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:21.520
Right.
So it has like that.

634
00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:23.860
It's a different vibe than we're going out with friends.

635
00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:26.920
And oftentimes when you go somewhere with coworkers,

636
00:40:26.921 --> 00:40:29.690
that's when you discovered the kind of people they are.
That's true.
Oh,

637
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:32.260
you guys aren't who you're part of the hoot club.

638
00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:38.380
Isn't there a credit card you can have if you're like a dad member of the

639
00:40:38.381 --> 00:40:43.240
Hooters club or whatever?
It is
so stupid.

640
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:47.070
It's horrible.
Now I,
I had uh,
one of my friends,
this was like the saddest.

641
00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:47.950
This is like who I would,

642
00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:52.030
this is what would drive you from going to the Hooters is one of my friend's

643
00:40:52.031 --> 00:40:55.840
roommates was going like five days a week.

644
00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:01.240
So he was a regular and he was talking about,
he was like,
man,

645
00:41:01.241 --> 00:41:02.074
that's so funny.

646
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:07.420
She always never has the Napkins you need.
And you're like,

647
00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:10.140
oh my God,
Tiffany.
Yeah.

648
00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:15.220
And they're leaving 50% tips and stuff and you're like,
oh.
He's like,
oh,

649
00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:18.490
they're like,
we're close.
Like we're friends,
you know,
friends.

650
00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:21.450
Like do you hang out outside of Hooters?
No.
But you know,

651
00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:25.330
like the stripper or the likes you same guy also.

652
00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:29.990
The Strip stripper likes them.
Yeah.
I always thought it was interesting.

653
00:41:29.991 --> 00:41:34.160
The Hooters uniform,
the nude nylons with

654
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.890
<v 4>the white sox and then the orange short shorts,</v>

655
00:41:36.891 --> 00:41:40.810
but the nude and islands was always like really?
Like,
that's just,
I dunno,

656
00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:44.840
it Kinda took me out of the fantasy of clarinet for your purpose.
What is that,

657
00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.220
why they need that?

658
00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:51.210
<v 0>Why is that?
I don't know.
It's,
I think it's a really dated um,</v>

659
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:55.040
concept of making the legs look nice because when I see,

660
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:57.740
I see.
I think so.

661
00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:01.730
I think cause it would take out any blemish that you might have the butteries I

662
00:42:01.731 --> 00:42:05.600
see it.
I see.
Like I'm like,
Oh are you from the 1950 [inaudible] or something?

663
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:08.270
Like why are you wearing that?
I remember,
um,

664
00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:12.690
you remember undercover bosses episodes?
That was an amazing episode.

665
00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:18.300
Undercover boss did an episode with Hooters open?
Yeah,
I think so.

666
00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:22.310
I believe so.
And the episode they did with Hooters,

667
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:26.360
man,
it was,
they had,
so you know,

668
00:42:26.361 --> 00:42:30.410
like that's like where the president or CEO acts like he's trying to get a job

669
00:42:30.411 --> 00:42:35.000
there.
So either have them like washing dishes and the,

670
00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:38.300
the actual guy that running the day to day operations of this one,

671
00:42:38.301 --> 00:42:43.250
Hooters has no clue.
And he was like hamming it up for the camera and he's like,

672
00:42:43.251 --> 00:42:45.920
hey.
He was like,
all right.
He was like,
I don't know.
Now we can just like,

673
00:42:45.921 --> 00:42:48.260
these girls think they're hot shit.
So,
you know,

674
00:42:48.261 --> 00:42:51.170
you've got to kind of put them in their place a lot so they don't get a big head

675
00:42:51.171 --> 00:42:55.320
about it.
And he was,
he was,
he was a tope pig in everywhere.

676
00:42:55.321 --> 00:42:59.990
He looked like a pig.
His attitude was pig,
like,
and then he's like,

677
00:42:59.991 --> 00:43:01.520
so I do this pretty regularly.

678
00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:05.690
And he had paper plates and he poured beans on them and he's like,

679
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:09.650
now we're going to hold them out in front of these girls and they have whoever

680
00:43:09.651 --> 00:43:14.480
can eat the pit,
the beans off the plate,
uh,
the fastest,
no hands.

681
00:43:14.481 --> 00:43:17.270
So they have to hold their hands behind their back.
Uh,
he's like,
you know,

682
00:43:17.271 --> 00:43:22.040
just like pigs,
you know.
And then she,
he was like,
he,
yeah,

683
00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:24.980
he was,
he was such an animal.
And so,

684
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:28.710
and he was talking shit about the whole time and the man,
then the,
you know,

685
00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:31.850
the end of the episode is where they,
they confront the people.

686
00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:36.620
And then this guy just turned white.
And I couldn't believe he didn't fire him.

687
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:40.940
I Dunno why he didn't give him another chance.
Like really,
dude,

688
00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.980
I mean like these Hooters girls still deserve respect.

689
00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.430
Well,
they do.
I mean they're just,
they're just trying to sling some wings,

690
00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:53.630
bucks or are they good at eating the beans?
Couple of,

691
00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:55.630
a couple of my thing.

692
00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:02.440
<v 4>Hello?
Scarfed it down and I think they actually,</v>

693
00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:10.050
it's really demeaning when Scott make this eat the plate of beans to add.

694
00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:12.480
We asked for time off.
No,

695
00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:16.150
like it now.
Yeah.

696
00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:18.160
I've been to a strip club once.

697
00:44:18.161 --> 00:44:22.140
It's part of like a coworker outing when I worked at a company that sold a

698
00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:25.540
airtime,
like media air time,
I remember that was uncomfortable.

699
00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:28.540
I was like in my early twenties what was it?
I've never been to a strip club.

700
00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:32.010
It's always sad,
like I think in theory I would always get stoked

701
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:36.180
<v 6>on it.
Like,
yeah,
let's go to Cheetah's and like,
yeah,
the clown room or whatever.</v>

702
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:40.680
And then every time I go I'm inevitably bummed out because you're like,
I mean,

703
00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:44.820
I'm glad he's women make a living and not everybody's doing it for sad reasons,

704
00:44:44.821 --> 00:44:48.180
but I,
it just always made me sad.
Like,
Oh yeah,

705
00:44:48.181 --> 00:44:50.010
I think there was a point at which thank you.

706
00:44:50.011 --> 00:44:54.480
I think there was a point at which I thought it's an empowered thing to do.
Um,

707
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:57.930
and if you have listeners who do that and feel that it is an empowered thing to

708
00:44:57.931 --> 00:45:01.650
do more power to them,
it's fine.
But I think the older I get,

709
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.770
the more I see it as potentially exploitative and

710
00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:10.140
well I look what's went,
hold on.
It's one thing to make your money.

711
00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:15.120
That's another thing to have to stand and pick up the dollars that are thrown at

712
00:45:15.121 --> 00:45:19.500
you.
Like okay,
at least give it an a.
That's the part that always made me sad.

713
00:45:19.501 --> 00:45:21.540
Like just fucking Hannity or like a person.

714
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:25.320
She just gave you a nice show and the beans into her mouth.

715
00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:29.610
You fucking asshole.
Like that bothers me.

716
00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:32.400
I think it's a,
it's a place where it's like,

717
00:45:32.401 --> 00:45:34.650
you know when you go out and you see what people are really like,

718
00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:37.950
you got a strip club with people.
Yeah.
Yes.

719
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.420
And you can see the dudes that hate women.
Yeah.

720
00:45:42.421 --> 00:45:45.120
That's what bothers me is that their,
their,

721
00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:49.140
their attitude towards them is like you fucking bitch.
Of course.
Instead of like,

722
00:45:49.141 --> 00:45:52.740
Hey,
thanks for giving me the teddy show.
[inaudible] Nice Lady.

723
00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:56.970
They see the power dynamic shifts at the Strip club where I have the money and

724
00:45:56.971 --> 00:45:58.440
therefore own you and they,

725
00:45:58.441 --> 00:46:02.700
and all their rage kind of comes up because that girl never looks at him when

726
00:46:02.701 --> 00:46:05.050
he's not in the Strip club and that's it.
And that's why that,

727
00:46:05.051 --> 00:46:08.550
that's the dynamic I must feel when I go in there and it makes me sad because I

728
00:46:08.551 --> 00:46:09.900
want it to be sex positive.

729
00:46:09.901 --> 00:46:14.901
I want it to be like a tinny environments of strip clubs where it's like that

730
00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:18.210
what the problem is,
you're not going to know Phil clubs

731
00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:21.150
sample sizes too small.

732
00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.940
Do you think I should start going now six months pregnant?

733
00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:29.100
She start getting into it like as a couple our thing six yes.

734
00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:31.980
Nothing wrong with it.
Nothing wrong with that.

735
00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:35.010
So now you're going to say that we actually,

736
00:46:35.011 --> 00:46:39.840
that was one of the first times we hung out before we started dating is we went

737
00:46:39.841 --> 00:46:44.220
to a strip club.
Yeah.
Now what happened was I was dating a lawyer at the time,

738
00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:45.233
a guy who had,

739
00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:48.420
he just finished law school and we were out celebrating that he had completed

740
00:46:48.421 --> 00:46:51.930
law school and it was a,
it was near a Tangier,

741
00:46:51.931 --> 00:46:56.520
the comedy room that I used to run.
And so Tommy Ryan Sickler,

742
00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:59.970
Matt Full Shrine.
Well hello also say other comics.
I don't even remember.

743
00:46:59.971 --> 00:47:03.590
Maybe like Jay Larson.
I go,
come on,
we're all going to,
I'm going to get my,
uh,

744
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:06.840
boyfriend lap dances because he just graduated law school,

745
00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:11.900
which just goes to show how invested I was in that relationship and going to

746
00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.240
touch you.
It's not going to be me.
So

747
00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:19.170
I think I had one foot out the door on that one.
Never offers me that shit.

748
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:23.130
No fuck no father and my children.
No,
you don't get any of that.

749
00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:25.080
So anyway,
we go to the Strip club.

750
00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:27.870
I don't know what stripper to pick to give him a lap dance.

751
00:47:27.871 --> 00:47:30.190
I'm not that everybody.
All

752
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:34.510
<v 0>the other comics go ask Sigora asks Aghora Hell know which girl?</v>

753
00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:39.490
Hell No.
And I was like,
really?
Tom knows over to me.
She came over to me.

754
00:47:39.491 --> 00:47:41.730
I still remember that.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I remember,

755
00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:44.710
I forget the girl you just said like,
Hey,

756
00:47:44.711 --> 00:47:49.470
everyone said you're the guy to ask like who should I get to?
Cause you,

757
00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:53.080
you knew their roster so well no,
I didn't know.
I'd never been there.

758
00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:55.480
But they all were just like,

759
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:59.020
if anyone knows what to look for in a stripper,
it's him.

760
00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:03.310
And that's what she came over and told me.
And did it turn out to be true?

761
00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.350
I don't know.
I just,
I think I was just like,
oh.

762
00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:09.320
And I just looked around the room and I was like,
she looks like she's stinks.
Go,

763
00:48:09.321 --> 00:48:13.840
go.
Ask Her.
How would you,
I mean,
what would,
what would you look for?
Like,

764
00:48:13.841 --> 00:48:18.610
I don't know how to pick good fruit.
You know the question you would,

765
00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.490
you would see who like,
you don't want the stripper.

766
00:48:21.491 --> 00:48:24.490
I think who thinks too highly of themselves,

767
00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:30.040
too much self esteem as a bad thing.
Oh,
in a stripper for sure.
Yeah.
Unbelievable.

768
00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:33.160
Yeah.
We were just talking about a power dynamic.
Bums us out.

769
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.360
She can't have that self esteem.
Yeah,
no,
no,
no.
You just want,

770
00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:42.540
you want someone who's,
who's game like who's who's down for the show dog

771
00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:48.400
and you know what the rescue dog,
all they want is treats and

772
00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:53.320
you just want one,
one,
one,
one,
one,
one,
one,
one.

773
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:57.190
He'd give her those ones and you get to show.
So you,

774
00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:01.150
cause there's also the game amongst men where you're picking the lap dance for

775
00:49:01.151 --> 00:49:03.210
your buddy,
but you have to pick the broken.

776
00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:06.040
That's what I did when I went to my friend reds,

777
00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:10.150
a Bachelor Party 15 years ago.

778
00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:15.450
We went to this run down Strip club outside of Charlotte and the lady that

779
00:49:15.851 --> 00:49:19.600
looked like life had just handed or nothing but,

780
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:24.630
but broken fucking dreams but rip dollars.
Oh you gave her,
she was fine.

781
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:28.150
She looked like she looked like she had had maybe six,
seven kids.

782
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:33.310
Everything was kind of hanging.
And she,
ah,
you know,
nobody was looking at her.

783
00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:35.800
I went up to her,
I gave her like a hundred bucks and I was just like,

784
00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:39.370
just sit on them and just keep dancing.
It was like,
okay.

785
00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:45.180
So that was fun to send your sense in a way that suites,

786
00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:49.750
which shows her and no one was looking at her like the way you portrayed it was

787
00:49:49.770 --> 00:49:54.100
very sweet.
However,
isn't the game,
Hey,
look at this fugly lady.
Of course,

788
00:49:54.101 --> 00:49:58.630
you know,
it was done to mock her and him.
Yeah,
it's weird that it sounded sweet.

789
00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:02.800
Artificial husband's good at,
we were all,
the sweet part was that we all,

790
00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:06.460
we all looked at each other with joy.
Like all the friends were like,

791
00:50:06.461 --> 00:50:11.170
look how horrendous this person is that we're sending to our friend.
So that was,

792
00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:15.070
that's all she wants.
And you know what?

793
00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:18.760
That woman's still thinks she's Kinda hot.
That's the kind of better,

794
00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:22.210
I mean that's the only way she could keep doing that.
If she was like,

795
00:50:22.211 --> 00:50:25.810
I'm not good enough for this,
she wouldn't be there.
So in her mind,

796
00:50:25.811 --> 00:50:27.160
that's the amazing thing about

797
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:31.040
<v 6>that type of stripper is that she actually thinks that she's got it going on</v>

798
00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:33.980
still to a degree.
So you're not ruining that for her.

799
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:38.360
I would be the laziest stripper.
Lazy stripper.

800
00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:42.620
Christina lie the way.
How do you feel about ball kicking?

801
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:46.790
Like kicking a guy in the balls as a dom.
You think you could do that?

802
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:51.560
Some guys like here's,
here's 500 bucks.
Just keep kicking me in the balls.

803
00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:55.490
Yes I do.
But I think it would,
I think I would do it,

804
00:50:55.491 --> 00:50:59.360
but I think that it would be sort of like where you like going to hammer a nail

805
00:50:59.361 --> 00:51:01.990
in and you're like,
oh,
take it easy.

806
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:06.740
I feel like I'd like wind up.
Well actually I was always terrible at soccer.

807
00:51:06.741 --> 00:51:09.830
So first of all I would kick I,
I'd miss the balls,

808
00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:12.260
but I would try to like really wind up.

809
00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:15.680
I'd probably throw my back out and I probably just graze them.
But I would,

810
00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:18.260
I would in my heart,
I would want to be kicking them.

811
00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.520
Drop lied or Bruce.
So you actually don't,
you don't,

812
00:51:22.521 --> 00:51:25.790
you're not enjoying the element of it that I enjoy.
Which is the,

813
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:27.860
is it sadistic when you heard somebody else?

814
00:51:27.861 --> 00:51:30.650
I can ever remember the sadistic element of like,
Hey,

815
00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:33.530
this guy wants me to hurt him.
I've got lots of anger.

816
00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:38.510
Were a match made in heaven.
Oh really?
So you're,
oh,
I did.
You could be into this.

817
00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:42.260
I could do ball kicking a fart videos is another one.

818
00:51:42.261 --> 00:51:47.240
I feel like I'm already doing them.
Why not profit?
Easy peasy.

819
00:51:47.241 --> 00:51:51.020
Easy money.
I actually,
yes,

820
00:51:51.021 --> 00:51:53.220
I think I could do it because to me,

821
00:51:53.221 --> 00:51:57.830
kicking balls is not like not a,
you're not really hurting someone.

822
00:51:57.831 --> 00:52:01.580
But I think actual,
you really are.
You got to see.
So yeah,
you're really,

823
00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:04.880
then we have any videos for her lunch.
I mean,

824
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:07.730
the way I would keep showing you to anyway,
the way I'm envisioning it,

825
00:52:07.731 --> 00:52:12.320
it's not really about full windup.
You kick him,
he doubles over.

826
00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:16.190
Oh No,
I cannot inflict pain.
But he loves it.
He loves the thing.

827
00:52:16.191 --> 00:52:20.780
He wants to keep doing it.
And then he's like,
I'm bleeding,
I'm pissing blood.

828
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:24.080
You know?
And I think I could handle that.
Right,
Christina?
Your end of that.

829
00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:28.430
I'm not into it.
We don't practice it in our personal life.

830
00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:31.360
But if some guy where like,
oh I'll pay you this is,

831
00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:34.880
this is by the way a fantasy that exists outside of me being a wife and a mother

832
00:52:34.881 --> 00:52:37.710
and being who I am to make that clear.

833
00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:42.950
Not now case anyone's writing any offers.
Right?
Like,
but yeah,

834
00:52:42.951 --> 00:52:47.120
I have some dude was like,
I got this amount of scratch.
I don't like five grand,

835
00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:50.350
five grand.
The Hey,
it's a lot of money monitoring.

836
00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:54.170
I'm not your fucking broken down stripper.
Five grand.

837
00:52:55.330 --> 00:53:00.110
No,
I think you're worth five grand cue balls and enjoyed them being kicked.

838
00:53:00.111 --> 00:53:02.510
I would guess five grants you're going to get with me.

839
00:53:02.511 --> 00:53:05.360
You're going to get pure rage.
I'm going to dress up nice.

840
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:07.130
I'm going to really put my heart into it.

841
00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:11.810
Like I'm going to come prepared guy just like sitting there like yes.

842
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:16.460
Yeah,
I know I could cause I know it brings her joy.
No,
no,

843
00:53:16.461 --> 00:53:21.310
it's no.
I think it's cause I have a graph.
I,
when I took a,
you know,

844
00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:23.930
Kung Fu in the park and stuff.
I like punching.

845
00:53:23.931 --> 00:53:28.210
I'm very angry inside and I like to get it out and the,

846
00:53:28.211 --> 00:53:30.480
and that's an arctic release for you?
It's a win win.

847
00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:33.630
He wants it and I want to give it,
you know what I mean?

848
00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:36.180
I wanna I want to get the rage out of me.
Okay.

849
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:39.150
Where do you normally get the rage out or don't therapy?

850
00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:44.850
I do pull out now comedy standup comedy going to works.

851
00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:47.880
Yes,
it does prayer too.

852
00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:52.130
<v 0>Well,
you know,
speaking of all these offers,
men and women and everything,</v>

853
00:53:52.131 --> 00:53:55.550
here's an offer that a man put out there,
uh,
on the subway,

854
00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:56.960
just to everybody on the train.

855
00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:00.650
And I'm wondering if you two ladies would respond to this,
maybe,

856
00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:03.890
maybe in your single days,
maybe now,
I don't know.
Let's see.

857
00:54:05.770 --> 00:54:06.603
<v 3>Hey,</v>

858
00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:14.430
<v 0>here's $20.</v>

859
00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:19.420
<v 3>Could we
go,
hey,</v>

860
00:54:19.690 --> 00:54:23.530
she goes to work,
right?
So I'm trying to get it in.

861
00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:27.960
<v 0>He stays with his mother,
but she goes to work so that the place will be</v>

862
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:32.700
<v 3>right.
Maybe try to make it look $20 out of smoking.</v>

863
00:54:33.450 --> 00:54:35.910
It's trick when you

864
00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:41.680
go no,
no flowers.
No,

865
00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:44.600
it's your night.

866
00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:45.960
<v 0>What do you think?</v>

867
00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:50.010
Did it seem no floss and no stocking and then you hear the floss part?

868
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:54.420
No.
So he's not gonna.
He's not gonna.
Okay.
Yeah.
He's just like,
here's the offer,

869
00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:57.560
right?
It's like a,
it's a clean offer.

870
00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:02.850
I have $20 you get to keep,
I have weed.
You get to smoke.
I have alcohol.

871
00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:06.570
You get to drink and you get to have sex with me and my mom's not going to be

872
00:55:06.571 --> 00:55:09.660
there and he lives at his mom's place,
so it's probably,
it's clean.
Okay.

873
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:10.583
That's really nice.

874
00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:13.850
<v 3>Tonight's the think about getting your book</v>

875
00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:23.500
<v 0>then to take that offer.
What do you think?</v>

876
00:55:24.250 --> 00:55:27.520
<v 6>I personally am going to pass.
I'm good.
I mean,</v>

877
00:55:27.521 --> 00:55:30.340
I appreciate his patch.

878
00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:34.420
I love a sales pitch and I got to say it's kind of sexist,

879
00:55:34.421 --> 00:55:38.680
an unfair in our society that,
you know,
gay men can throw this pitch out.

880
00:55:38.681 --> 00:55:41.740
We have another famous clip we play where this guy is like,
hey man,

881
00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:44.770
you want to come over here?
You want to Piss on me being me?
Try it out.

882
00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:48.550
You want a free rent?
Like he just throws it out there and it works for gay guys.

883
00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:51.820
Why can't I work for straight guys?
It's a really good point.

884
00:55:51.821 --> 00:55:55.570
I feel like this is a new era.
Maybe.
Maybe he has some takers.

885
00:55:56.230 --> 00:56:00.220
I mean we only saw him from the back.
Whoever filmed this.
Yeah.

886
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:02.260
Well they were trying to discreetly,
right?
Yeah.

887
00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:04.860
But maybe if I saw him from the front and I was like,
yeah,
I,

888
00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:06.700
I want us to sit on that.

889
00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:09.880
Do you think there's an age where you may have taken them up on the offer or at

890
00:56:09.881 --> 00:56:12.570
night?
There's probably been at night.
Yeah.

891
00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:16.270
I mean a long time ago cause I used to drink pretty heavily.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

892
00:56:16.271 --> 00:56:20.850
Lee.
I would drink real heavily and I would,
if I,

893
00:56:20.890 --> 00:56:24.280
whoever I was dating,
like it was very vital me that they

894
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:27.040
<v 0>come home with me or I go home with them cause I was like,
sorry,</v>

895
00:56:27.041 --> 00:56:27.730
it's going to get really,

896
00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:30.280
it's going to get real just like that guy because I'm like,
I don't want to,

897
00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:32.440
I don't want to feel anything tonight.

898
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:35.230
What I want to feel these feelings and if I go home I'm going to feel these

899
00:56:35.231 --> 00:56:36.790
feelings.
So I'm trying to delay.

900
00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:41.850
I'm trying to put more time in between now and when I have to like have my

901
00:56:43.031 --> 00:56:46.540
moment of reckoning of like who did I talk to and what did I say and how much

902
00:56:46.541 --> 00:56:49.790
did I drink and this guy,
this guy to help you forget for sure.
Yeah.

903
00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.350
So there would have been a time

904
00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:58.090
you keep jumping over the 20 bucks.
I know.
I'm forgetting about them.

905
00:56:58.091 --> 00:57:02.720
Forgetting about for you
now.
Why?

906
00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:04.600
Why wouldn't you just go to a prostitute?

907
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:07.860
One wonders because I don't know 20 bucks.
Maybe.

908
00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:11.830
I'm not aware of how much they charge.
How much do they charge?
Yeah,

909
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:14.540
tell you're the expert.
I feel like,
uh,

910
00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:18.040
at least $30 I think is the opening bid.
I Dunno.

911
00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:22.510
I feel like 20 is probably well known to not be the amount they charge.

912
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:27.890
Like a blow job made or you watched that?
I'm that lady gave her pitch.
Yeah,

913
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:32.200
on the streets.
It wasn't good.

914
00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:34.750
It wasn't a good pitch.
Like depressing.

915
00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:38.380
It's a wrap where she puts her price list out there and what you get for the

916
00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:40.150
money and it was like that's it.

917
00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:45.070
Just as Christ has like 20 bucks for the blow job and the hand job.
You're like,

918
00:57:45.071 --> 00:57:46.060
Geez man,

919
00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:50.190
it's gotta work for somebody.

920
00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:55.260
<v 7>Must've works.
He's doing it.
Why I like the asthma.</v>

921
00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:56.190
The balls for Becky.

922
00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:06.220
<v 0>Yup.
Scrum.
It's scrumptious.
Yeah.
That was the only like,
yeah,</v>

923
00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:10.740
<v 7>I got that deep bro.
Scrumptious</v>

924
00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:16.240
choke on it.

925
00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:23.010
How many shorter street?

926
00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:27.350
<v 0>Oh 20 that's right.
Well let's look them up,</v>

927
00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:32.370
but this is also I think a level of of prostitute.

928
00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:35.800
Maybe not for

929
00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:42.530
$20 but how excited would she be for that free weed.
Free alcohol.

930
00:58:42.531 --> 00:58:44.960
Her evenings made.
Yeah,
and a nice place to do it.

931
00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:49.760
Now my guess is that she is below that man's standards though.

932
00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:53.010
That's how full of himself he is and it's so,

933
00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:55.940
it has to have work for him at some point where he just throws it out there and

934
00:58:55.941 --> 00:58:57.740
some and then what woman is going to be like?

935
00:58:57.741 --> 00:59:01.550
I like to in front of everybody else,
like a lot of women.

936
00:59:01.551 --> 00:59:05.740
I don't think you know many women,
lot of women
guys are.

937
00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:09.790
I like to fuck you guys actually would go for it.
God says love to fuck.

938
00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:10.693
Fuck good.

939
00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:16.450
If you're a hot black guy and you want to fuck me at 2195 if you want to move

940
00:59:16.641 --> 00:59:20.850
in,
you come move here,
but you got to fuck the fuck a lot,
man.

941
00:59:21.330 --> 00:59:24.890
It riff free food free.
Right?
You got me,
man.
He has somebody.
Oh Man.
You know,

942
00:59:24.891 --> 00:59:26.780
we've watched this pip probably 40 times.

943
00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:32.000
Somebody pointed out to me that there's a whole lot of shoulder movement in

944
00:59:32.001 --> 00:59:34.970
this.
We never really realized he's actually probably tugging his meet this whole

945
00:59:34.971 --> 00:59:37.850
time.
Yeah,
there's a lot of shoulder movement.

946
00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:43.340
Black Guy like want to fuck 22 what's that?

947
00:59:43.341 --> 00:59:45.890
Shoulder new and then you come home,
you gonna fuck the

948
00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:52.670
men from jail,
homeless.
Look,
thoughts still moving

949
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:59.800
that shoulder.
Don't Reggie Guild.
He's in a cake.
Fuck me.
I think it's because

950
01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.950
I think that video just made a Alison sad.

951
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:10.850
That's Ron.
Jeremy,
right?
I didn't know that.
Ron.

952
01:00:10.851 --> 01:00:15.700
Jeremy.
It likes.
Oh yeah.
But yeah,
it's,
I don't know.

953
01:00:15.701 --> 01:00:18.400
I think you guys should open up your attitude's a little bit.

954
01:00:18.970 --> 01:00:23.380
I guess where I looked.
Close minded squares.
Couple of squares.

955
01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:24.790
Fucking nerds.
We are

956
01:00:26.830 --> 01:00:30.760
of course a while ago we were introduced to ball hawks.
Hi,

957
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.190
I'm Sierra Sen

958
01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:37.120
and ever since we introduced people to ball hogs they'd been making their own

959
01:00:37.121 --> 01:00:40.020
ball hog videos and sending them into us house.

960
01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:45.040
Really stepped into a unique episode.
Cochon ball heavy.

961
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:46.090
Oh I actually have a,

962
01:00:46.091 --> 01:00:49.930
I have a sex question based on something that was discussed on your last
episode.

963
01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:52.990
You were talking about double pen.
Where are triple Penn?

964
01:00:52.991 --> 01:00:56.440
Where two guys or three guys are in the same hall.
Is that real?

965
01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.080
I was just talking about this with Tom yesterday.

966
01:00:59.850 --> 01:01:04.690
How did like puzzle pieces,
how do they position themselves?

967
01:01:04.830 --> 01:01:09.570
It's a good question.
Generally speaking.
Yeah,
it works.

968
01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:13.430
It works.
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?
Yeah,

969
01:01:14.050 --> 01:01:17.540
and the same hall.
Well how to three dicks get in one.
She's right.

970
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:22.950
How three first of all,
you got to have the right attitude.
You got gotta.

971
01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.510
You got want it.
Yeah.
Life is full of obstacles and you got to just,

972
01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:31.830
if there's something you want to do,
you got to,
you got to push for it.
I mean,

973
01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:35.700
what my husband says he'll sometimes do,

974
01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:40.520
if his team at work is putting resistance,
which is,
which is be like,

975
01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:45.870
but let's say we could make this work.
How would we do it?
Oh,
that's smart.
Right?

976
01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:50.440
You could use Cameron Hanes philosophy,
the ultra distance runner.
Yeah.

977
01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:55.500
Keep hammering,
hammering,
keep going.
Yeah.

978
01:01:55.740 --> 01:02:00.030
You miss 100% of the dicks.
You don't try to stuff in here.

979
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:04.920
Oh,
there you go.
Send the episode was wisdom,
right?
Their knowledge.

980
01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:07.470
That will be 100% isolated for this show.
Just

981
01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:13.380
you're our new drop.
That is,
it's so true though.

982
01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:16.620
But here's what usually happens I think is that,
so there's a guy sitting down,

983
01:02:16.770 --> 01:02:20.650
I'm,
are we really gonna understand,
right?

984
01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.240
There's a guy sitting on the chair behind you.

985
01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:27.720
A woman is seated facing him with one in her.

986
01:02:27.970 --> 01:02:30.460
Okay.
Then another guy comes up behind her.

987
01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:34.990
<v 6>Oh yeah,
there's two in,
there's number two,
two and you know,</v>

988
01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:39.460
and worst number three number.
That's like doing a real that inside you.

989
01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:42.880
Yeah,
that's,
that doesn't sound comfortable.
I don't think it's

990
01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.080
<v 0>ever comfortable.
Right.</v>

991
01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:49.180
But people want to push the boundaries and the levels of what they,

992
01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.113
what's possible.

993
01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:53.840
<v 6>Well,
if it can come out of there,
I mean it can accommodate a lot.</v>

994
01:02:53.890 --> 01:02:57.580
It can accommodate a lot.
You're right.
That's a really good shoulders and God,

995
01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:01.940
God,
that is nuts that that comes out.
Right.
You saw it happen.
Yeah.

996
01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:04.880
Human being comes out.
What was your reaction to seeing it?
Tom?

997
01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:10.980
<v 0>You're so removed from the physical part of what's going on.</v>

998
01:03:11.831 --> 01:03:16.360
It's just that like you're seeing a baby,
your,
your baby born,

999
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:21.040
that you're just,
you're just in,
you're not thinking about,
oh,

1000
01:03:21.041 --> 01:03:23.760
that baby came out of your puss puss.
It's like,

1001
01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:28.900
it's just that like baby is born and you're just totally in awe.
Right?
Yeah.

1002
01:03:28.901 --> 01:03:32.380
I mean,
somebody could have just tapped me and I would've probably fought,

1003
01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:33.910
fell over,
you know?
I mean,
yeah.

1004
01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:39.100
<v 6>And then that nice moment you said when the ego and then I looked down,</v>

1005
01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:41.060
all this shit just came out of you,
y'all.

1006
01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:46.040
This shit fell out the after birth or the actual shit?

1007
01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:50.960
No Shit.
No,
it was a the placenta fluid.

1008
01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:56.050
Yeah.
Just look like a,
like,
like a sewage valve had been opened and just

1009
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:59.740
like,
was it purples and reds and

1010
01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:04.120
<v 0>it just,
it looked like,
I dunno.
Ocean water.
It was just like,
it was like,
yeah.</v>

1011
01:04:04.350 --> 01:04:08.570
Yeah.
It's just,
did you see the placenta?
I don't even remember.

1012
01:04:08.571 --> 01:04:12.440
I was so focused on him.
I didn't know.
It was like,
uh Huh.
And,

1013
01:04:12.890 --> 01:04:15.040
and then I was like,
is he a ginger?
Cause that,
yeah,

1014
01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:17.453
<v 6>we had a,</v>

1015
01:04:17.550 --> 01:04:20.430
<v 0>I had a real bad moment where we thought we were got to give him up.</v>

1016
01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:23.360
She looked like he might have red hair,
but then it,
you know,

1017
01:04:23.361 --> 01:04:25.920
everything got better.
But that was a really rough,

1018
01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:29.380
<v 6>well,
he's blonde now.
Yeah.
He kind of has reddish hair though,
doesn't he?</v>

1019
01:04:30.290 --> 01:04:35.210
<v 0>No.
Hmm.
I don't think so.
Think so.
It's more looks like Christina's.</v>

1020
01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:36.890
Okay.
Yeah,
yeah,

1021
01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:41.000
<v 6>yeah.
That was a magical moment.
You go there when he recaps to me,
he's like,</v>

1022
01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:45.920
I saw the head come out and then the body and then a bunch of shit just came out

1023
01:04:45.921 --> 01:04:50.010
of you.
It's like how romantic times like a pool that was really like you,

1024
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:55.100
a lot of stuff.
Now did a Daniel Watch you?
Yes.
Yes.
And He,

1025
01:04:55.850 --> 01:05:00.500
his comment was he just couldn't believe how huge my vagina had gotten.

1026
01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:03.830
Yeah,
I imagine.
Did you know you didn't notice that part

1027
01:05:04.310 --> 01:05:07.580
<v 0>or it was like,
no,
because even like when you're like when you're,</v>

1028
01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:11.050
I think maybe if it was a stranger or something you,

1029
01:05:11.090 --> 01:05:15.320
you start to objectify the x's and o's of the whole thing,

1030
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.010
but when it's yours you really like

1031
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:19.570
<v 6>thinking about your monitoring,</v>

1032
01:05:19.571 --> 01:05:23.290
the heart rate monitor and you're looking at her and then you know when,

1033
01:05:23.350 --> 01:05:27.280
when the head starts to crown you really like,
Holy Shit,
this is about to happen.

1034
01:05:27.281 --> 01:05:31.360
So your mind isn't really going there because you're so in the moment.

1035
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:33.310
Was it pretty fast for you?

1036
01:05:33.311 --> 01:05:37.360
Once the head crown and then he was out because it was real slow on my end.

1037
01:05:37.361 --> 01:05:40.140
I'm just going to give him ample time to notice the size of the head for it

1038
01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:45.250
wasn't fast for me.
It wasn't fast for me there cause I think he,

1039
01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:48.640
I couldn't push him out enough.
That was a problem.
They're like,
keep pushing.

1040
01:05:48.641 --> 01:05:52.690
I'm like bitch,
I am.
And then she's like,
do you want a mirror?
I was like,
fuck no.

1041
01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:56.070
I turned down the mirror to get him out,
man.

1042
01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.970
The mirror would have made me like clench everything up.

1043
01:05:57.970 --> 01:06:00.130
That's what I thought too.
Once I saw what was happening,

1044
01:06:00.131 --> 01:06:01.270
I think it would get in my head.

1045
01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:04.810
So then I just kept pushing and pushing and that's when the scissors came out

1046
01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:07.210
and that's when Tom goes,
he goes,

1047
01:06:07.211 --> 01:06:11.020
I saw those desserts come out and I looked away right away of the scissors went

1048
01:06:11.021 --> 01:06:11.854
down.

1049
01:06:11.890 --> 01:06:15.820
It was one of those like I just didn't want to because I knew that it would be

1050
01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:20.590
stamped in my head.
So he's going,
if I can just miss that moment,

1051
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:24.370
turn back as a second later,
then I won't notice it.

1052
01:06:24.371 --> 01:06:27.870
And that's what I said is blood everywhere.
No,
I mean it was,
it was,

1053
01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:31.570
it wasn't bloodier.
It just was one of those things where I go,
I just don't want,

1054
01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:36.520
it's like watching some violent youtube thing and you're just like,

1055
01:06:36.521 --> 01:06:39.100
well that's in my head forever and they can't get it out.

1056
01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:42.910
So that's what I was trying to avoid that smart and you didn't feel bad at all

1057
01:06:42.911 --> 01:06:44.860
right now.
And she's like,

1058
01:06:44.861 --> 01:06:48.370
I'm s when she was sewing me up and talking to me afterwards and then she's
like,

1059
01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:51.640
Hey,
I'm going to put my finger in your rectum to make sure there's two holes.

1060
01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.220
And I was like,
yeah,
I don't give a shit.
Put your arm in there.

1061
01:06:54.221 --> 01:06:59.080
I don't feel anything right now.
I swear because I did feel a lot of stuff.

1062
01:06:59.110 --> 01:07:02.390
I swear my ob put her finger in my butt.
Yeah,
they did.

1063
01:07:02.410 --> 01:07:06.760
And make sure that they sewed you up.
Right?
I feel like it was while he,

1064
01:07:06.761 --> 01:07:08.740
while I was still delivering him though.

1065
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:12.490
Oh and I can't get up the nerve to ask her.

1066
01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:15.640
I saw her recently and I was like,
just ask her,
just ask her,
just ask her.

1067
01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:19.270
That's my new thing in life because I really don't like that feeling of regret

1068
01:07:19.330 --> 01:07:23.740
of light,
you know,
like the staircase
anyway.
It's in French,

1069
01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:27.190
that thing afterwards.
So I'm like just say it in the moment,
but I couldn't,

1070
01:07:27.330 --> 01:07:30.840
I couldn't do it.
I couldn't say,
did you put your finger in my butt?
Um,

1071
01:07:30.970 --> 01:07:34.480
and then I've read that it could just be a sensation of like the baby's head

1072
01:07:34.481 --> 01:07:34.981
pushing off it,

1073
01:07:34.981 --> 01:07:38.320
but I'm pretty sure her fingers in my butt or maybe you just shit a little,

1074
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:42.100
they told me I didn't and I don't know if they're lying to me.
I had a salad,

1075
01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:45.580
a salad a couple of days before I got to do,

1076
01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:49.810
they really wanted to know.
Not that I noticed,

1077
01:07:49.811 --> 01:07:53.260
but I'm saying if you a lot of,
come on,

1078
01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:56.350
I don't understand how I could have not,
I was really pushing.

1079
01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:58.420
Did you shit when you were in labor?

1080
01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:01.600
Cause I remember when I first started going in labor,
like that's what happens.

1081
01:08:01.601 --> 01:08:02.950
Everything just comes out of you because your,

1082
01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:06.190
it's like your body's way of clean edge and if you do this every day and there's

1083
01:08:06.191 --> 01:08:10.000
multiple deliveries,
I've seen people,
oh my God,

1084
01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:13.900
get embarrassed that they did.
A lot of them,
their auto response is like,

1085
01:08:13.901 --> 01:08:17.300
no you didn't.
You know I don't like that dishonesty because I asked,

1086
01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:22.060
I asked like right away,
did I shit?
Everyone said no.
Maybe.

1087
01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:25.450
Maybe weird how important it is to me to know the truth.
All right.
I have,

1088
01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:26.960
speaking of shit and pregnancy,

1089
01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:30.890
I experienced a double pipe classic while pregnant.

1090
01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:34.220
Oh Wow.
Now I know.

1091
01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:37.910
That's why I bring it up because someone is it,

1092
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:42.310
is it your listeners who think that it's,
that doesn't count.
Yes.
Yes.

1093
01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:46.010
And I say don't take this away from me.
Yeah.
However,

1094
01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:50.510
then I listened a little longer and now I'm afraid that maybe my double pipe

1095
01:08:50.511 --> 01:08:54.080
plot classic is invalidated because it happened while I was sitting on the

1096
01:08:54.081 --> 01:08:59.060
toilet.
It wasn't,
it wasn't a pure like one,
two,
three.

1097
01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:04.850
Right.
Which I feel like is the like that's the platonic ideal of double pipe.

1098
01:09:05.230 --> 01:09:06.063
I think you're right.

1099
01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:10.280
It was more like I was on the toilet farting and then I burped and I went,
oh,

1100
01:09:10.281 --> 01:09:12.430
that felt really weird.
Oh my God.
It was a double pipe class.

1101
01:09:12.431 --> 01:09:16.520
I don't think that that doesn't count though.
It wasn't,
it wasn't just,

1102
01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:19.370
it wasn't like nonstop farting.
It was.

1103
01:09:19.670 --> 01:09:22.190
It really was like a fart and then I burped in the midst,

1104
01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:25.720
so I feel like that should count.
I think it counts.
I think so too.
Yeah.

1105
01:09:25.850 --> 01:09:26.720
I think that's still count,

1106
01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:30.380
but it wasn't as pure as if I was just like going about my day shopping or

1107
01:09:30.381 --> 01:09:32.090
something.
Yeah.
But you also weren't like,

1108
01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:35.750
does it sound like you were trying to manufacturer?
No,
I 100% was not.

1109
01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:40.250
I was very innocent.
Congratulations.
Certified.

1110
01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:46.640
<v 0>That's good.
I do think you have a good point,
Tommy.</v>

1111
01:09:46.641 --> 01:09:48.830
It's the organic happening.

1112
01:09:48.890 --> 01:09:51.710
It's like you're not trying to make it happen and then you're surprised when it

1113
01:09:51.711 --> 01:09:55.340
does.
That's the true essence of the double pipe.
That's true.
Yeah.

1114
01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:58.880
So I would say that Alison earned hers and we'll have that shirt shipped to you.

1115
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:03.820
I can't wait.
No,
here's the ball hog thing I was trying to fill.
Yeah,

Everybody really gravitated to her name.
So why would you not?

1141
01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:59.430
Yeah,
it's like a comedy club.
Yeah,

1142
01:11:59.431 --> 01:12:03.260

Tom,

1144
01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:12.750

Yeah,
I can't believe Arie did it.
I know.
Um,
I have

1145
01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:19.260
a voicemail,
Paul law firm from our friend Joey Diaz.
Okay.
He left me,

1146
01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:23.260
he told me he's a,
he was taking this,
um,

1147
01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:28.440
natural laxative as a weight loss supplement basically.

1148
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:31.300
Sure.
And um,
I dunno,
he's in,

1149
01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:36.240
he's been encouraging me to try it.
And this is,
I guess his report.

1150
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:41.160
Boy.
How it's gone for him.
Stop.
Maybe our audience would enjoy it.

1151
01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:46.430
<v 10>You want me to call me back?
You know,
I always try to help you out.</v>

1152
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:49.590
Well,

Chris,

1153

1154
01:12:54.591 --> 01:12:59.570
day.
Let me tell you something.
Took shit yesterday.
Had to be 62 63 inches.

1155
01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:04.070
Weight,
different colors,
bubblegum in the 80s willing,

1156
01:13:04.071 --> 01:13:08.390
they shaved their hair,
so I ain't ask.
I should have fucking head wall.

1157
01:13:08.391 --> 01:13:10.370
I was like a Werewolf and the fucking twice.

1158
01:13:11.090 --> 01:13:15.200
I thought it was a baby fucking possible in the fucking forward with Chris,

1159
01:13:15.201 --> 01:13:16.280
you want it for two weeks,

1160
01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:21.140
you lose 10 pounds and it makes your body feel like when you were a kid,

1161
01:13:21.141 --> 01:13:23.100
it takes all the tops.
It's out of your body,

1162
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:27.960
your shit to come out and different fucking collars,
bubblegum,
bones.

1163
01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:32.390
I mean it's fucking this.
I was like,
I should've taken a picture.

1164
01:13:32.410 --> 01:13:36.590
That shit yesterday.
It looked like a fucking cane.
I couldn't believe it.

1165
01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:40.150
Anyway,
figure about your stay black.
You have the white fog.

1166
01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:45.240
<v 0>There you go.
He's thinking about you.
Yeah.
That's sweet.
That's sweet.
Yeah.</v>

1167
01:13:45.290 --> 01:13:49.580
It's a very sweet message.
It's called Swiss Kriss.
Swiss Kriss.
Yeah.

1168
01:13:49.630 --> 01:13:54.340
Eight different colors.
I'm kind of into that.
I don't know.
I ordered it.
You did?

1169
01:13:54.370 --> 01:13:56.080
Yeah.
The Amazon or something.

1170
01:13:56.081 --> 01:13:59.950
It's just a like a natural link says lax.

1171
01:13:59.951 --> 01:14:02.260
It's like a detoxification and things are useless.

1172
01:14:02.290 --> 01:14:07.290
Just take a few pills a night for like a week and I'm going to get worse as you

1173
01:14:07.631 --> 01:14:12.130
imagine.
What's exciting?
What do you think is inside of him?
He said pubic hair,

1174
01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:16.420
bubblegum.
Everything.
Awesome.

1175
01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:20.950
Damp.
Yeah.
Pretty good stuff though.
Is Christ?

1176
01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:24.880
Nothing like a voicemail from him.
Not Special.
Very special.

1177
01:14:24.970 --> 01:14:27.650
I don't fuck with link cause you know that.
Um,
you know the piss on me guy.

1178
01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:31.930
The come over and fuck me people.
Someone's made his him a Tinder profile.

1179
01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.130
We've got this swipe right.

1180
01:14:36.131 --> 01:14:39.010
If you're a hot black guy and you want to fuck me and it has it,
the whole thing.

1181
01:14:39.011 --> 01:14:40.900
Men from jail,
homeless.
If you're thug,

1182
01:14:40.901 --> 01:14:43.960
you want to move in your frank and moving to man free rent.

1183
01:14:43.961 --> 01:14:48.310
You get at least in a key,
fuck me.
Piss on me.
Beat me.
Jesus.
See me.

1184
01:14:48.311 --> 01:14:50.350
I want to come over today and try it out.
Try it out,
man.

1185
01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:55.070
That's just Tinder profile from Canada.
It says less than a kilometer.
Yep.

1186
01:14:55.810 --> 01:14:59.350
But anyways.
Wow.
I wonder if he's getting any traction on that.

1187
01:15:00.010 --> 01:15:01.530
I'm sure somebody would.
You know,

1188
01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:06.010
I have a single friend who's on these apps and he sends me screen grabs of these

1189
01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:10.120
complete animals and it's like a lot of swingers.
A lot of women.
They're like,

1190
01:15:10.121 --> 01:15:13.870
my husband and I want to play that.
I'm like,
that sounds real dicey man.

1191
01:15:13.870 --> 01:15:16.930
To show up some,
some lady you don't know.

1192
01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:20.060
You don't know if the husband's really on board or not or like he's,

1193
01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:25.060
he gonna beat the Shit Outta you.
Um,
I mean,
have you tried something like that?

1194
01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:30.120
What?
Craig's list meeting people online?
Yeah.

1195
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:33.790
How'd it go for you?
Great.
I almost got married.

1196
01:15:35.170 --> 01:15:38.550
Craigslist is the bottom of the barrel,
right?
For that kind of hookup?
Yeah.

1197
01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:43.270
I think you should stick to the apps.
Well that's when you were saying though,

1198
01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:45.010
what your friend is found on the APPS.

1199
01:15:45.011 --> 01:15:47.530
I was thinking it's weird that we all agree that Craig's list,

1200
01:15:47.531 --> 01:15:51.790
oh that's super dicey.
But these apps are okay to just meet a stranger I guess.

1201
01:15:51.791 --> 01:15:56.440
But the thing is with Apps,
I mean people sign up with a,
you know,

1202
01:15:56.441 --> 01:15:59.110
like there's like an agreement to the terms and right.

1203
01:15:59.111 --> 01:16:04.111
You're using your photo and like what's the one where the women women have to

1204
01:16:04.751 --> 01:16:08.390
initiate?
So that's another level of member's daughter farmer's daughter.

1205
01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:14.320
I know that's a bar farmer.
There's something for farmers.
There's farmers only.

1206
01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:18.180
I heard a bit about it.
That's how I know.
Um,

1207
01:16:18.190 --> 01:16:21.770
that's in like a lot of rural places where but,
but you know,

1208
01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:25.760
letting the woman initiate.
I was at bumble.
I think it,
I think so.

1209
01:16:25.770 --> 01:16:29.860
And then there's one that's just for celebrities.
Cod,
Riaa my ass.

1210
01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:34.780
You have to be,
you have to apply.
It's like getting into the Soho House.

1211
01:16:34.781 --> 01:16:38.620
You have to apply and then I don't know how they approve you.
Oh,

1212
01:16:39.070 --> 01:16:42.920
it doesn't it make you want to know if you would be accepted.
Of course.

1213
01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:48.790
Want to know?
I will know.
Let us know.
Yeah,
I remember Ashley Madison.

1214
01:16:48.791 --> 01:16:52.810
Is that still around?
I think so.
Yeah.
That is scandalous.
Know what they got.

1215
01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:56.350
They got hacked.
I know.
And then Mitt ruined a lot of people killed themselves.

1216
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:57.500
Yeah.
Yeah.

1217
01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:02.950
Have you heard ads for Madison Reid?

1218
01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:06.750
Harry Reid,

1219
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:09.890
my dog named after my daughter.
She's the worst.

1220
01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:13.610
It sounds just like Leah Remini though to know that we'll Miss Tara.

1221
01:17:13.611 --> 01:17:16.800
So there's this commercial.
They play on serious for Matt.

1222
01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:21.990
I met Amy from Madison Reed.
She's got like they Chicago accident sound color.

1223
01:17:22.130 --> 01:17:27.130
I can't believe it's not Leah Remini or else I hate her.

1224
01:17:27.321 --> 01:17:29.790
I just heard listened to today.
I was a hair thing.
Yeah.

1225
01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:33.340
Get home home hair dye kit for women.
It's nice and even,

1226
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:37.640
it sounds like a hookup site,
Madison to me,
but it is the hair dye.

1227
01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:41.570
We've talked about this before,
but so many just wrote in about it,

1228
01:17:41.571 --> 01:17:45.800
so I'd like to get your take on that.
Okay.
Somebody writes,
Hey,

1229
01:17:45.801 --> 01:17:47.270
mommy's longtime listener.

1230
01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:51.290
My girlfriend and I recently had a debate that we'd love for you at your mom's

1231
01:17:51.291 --> 01:17:52.910
house to settle.
Earlier today,

1232
01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:57.200
my lady and I were enjoying a nice shower together and all of a sudden a woman

1233
01:17:57.201 --> 01:18:01.970
thought it was disgusting that I used our shared bar of soap to clean my ass.

1234
01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:02.931
Bear in mind,

1235
01:18:02.931 --> 01:18:06.560
I only ran it along the crack of my ass so I wouldn't come back with shit on it

1236
01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:09.890
regardless.
She insisted that it was nasty as hell.

1237
01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:14.780
Then I used r that I use are bear bar of soap without the Loofa to clean my ass

1238
01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:18.140
and she still needed to wash her face.
I said,
it's a bar soap.

1239
01:18:18.141 --> 01:18:20.630
Unless there's a brown streak on it,
it's always going to be clean,

1240
01:18:20.890 --> 01:18:24.680
kind of Barv so it'd be dirty.
Perhaps a question for the philosophers,

1241
01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:29.240
which is why we decided to email you our favorite jeans and mind the wrong for

1242
01:18:29.241 --> 01:18:33.140
using the Barb soap to clean my crack and balls and does the bar of soap get

1243
01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:34.940
dirty if I directly cleaned my ass with it.

1244
01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:38.060
Thanks for letting us your ears and settling the dispute.

1245
01:18:38.061 --> 01:18:42.050
Sincerely Soule and Emily and we are ball hogs.

1246
01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:46.580
That is not okay.
No,
I don't think that's okay.

1247
01:18:46.730 --> 01:18:51.020
I know that probably nothing can live on a bar of soap.
Nothing.
However,

1248
01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:52.820
were they taking a shower together?
As I said,

1249
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.380
so he just took the bar soap and then probably put it down.
You just,

1250
01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:00.500
you should never do that in front of her I think.

1251
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:03.860
I think here's the technicality.
Wow.

1252
01:19:04.010 --> 01:19:06.440
Am I really nice zigging when you guys are zagging.

1253
01:19:06.441 --> 01:19:09.200
You gotta fucking take a shower with his ball hog.
Oh,

1254
01:19:09.201 --> 01:19:12.800
you want to take a shower real quick?
Die.
If he saw what I got from my own soap.

1255
01:19:12.801 --> 01:19:17.150
Go ahead.
Sorry.
So I think that probably it is.
Okay.

1256
01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:21.290
Cleanliness wise.
Since soap kills germs theoretically,

1257
01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:25.340
but it's just a statically super disgusting.

1258
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:26.720
Do not do that in front of someone.

1259
01:19:26.721 --> 01:19:29.570
What about just lathering up in your hands and then using your hands?

1260
01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:33.320
Is that what do you,
I know many people,
many people,

1261
01:19:33.321 --> 01:19:36.030
many people just use washcloths and that I just use my hands don't.

1262
01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:43.940
Of course they opened desiccators use wash washcloths not for us.

1263
01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:48.790
We're not a washcloth family.
She's your fucking hand be a grown up.
I Dunno.

1264
01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:53.800
I'll shove the entire bar's open my ass and sit down and expect it to be though

1265
01:19:55.710 --> 01:20:00.320
when I live with,
I mean why?
I mean why not just blather,

1266
01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:03.200
lather up your hands and then you do that too.
I did that to you can,

1267
01:20:03.230 --> 01:20:05.900
you can really get in the nooks and crannies.
No,
that's true.

1268
01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:08.010
I sometimes what I do,
I'll take the

1269
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:08.551
<v 6>soap bar,</v>

1270
01:20:08.551 --> 01:20:13.551
let's say start rubbing it over myself then then put it down and then get some

1271
01:20:16.231 --> 01:20:18.850
more lather from the bar.
But I'll put the,
the,

1272
01:20:18.851 --> 01:20:23.340
the bar anywhere he puts the bar up is as and as,
as on his chest,

1273
01:20:23.341 --> 01:20:26.760
on his face,
on my face,
on my mouth.
I keep,
doesn't care.

1274
01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:31.110
I listen.
I stopped key,

1275
01:20:31.111 --> 01:20:36.111
broke me down 14 years ago I had been so broken down by this man.

1276
01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:41.520
First of all,
he'll blow snot rockets in the shower with me,

1277
01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:45.570
full snot rockets.
He'll piss on me and he'll,

1278
01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:47.430
he'll drink coffee right before.

1279
01:20:47.431 --> 01:20:51.000
So it's like someone dumped a crap of coffee in the shower.

1280
01:20:51.570 --> 01:20:54.060
I mean what you do art,
he fucking,

1281
01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:59.310
he practically takes a shit in the shadow.
Spread the spread the cheeks.

1282
01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:05.460
Come on man,
dad.
I do man.
You got to spread the cheeks,
right?

1283
01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:08.910
Of course.
Well what do you do with the sub,
Christina?

1284
01:21:08.970 --> 01:21:12.660
I don't put this bar in my ass because I don't see the under no need.
Yeah,

1285
01:21:12.661 --> 01:21:16.680
I put it on my hand and then I use my hand.
That's enough for me.

1286
01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:19.410
But I don't have hair.
Excuse me.
Like you do,

1287
01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:23.160
you got mashed stuff in there and I guess if you do,

1288
01:21:23.161 --> 01:21:27.300
if you apply the bar directly then you're getting more soap in there.
I guess.

1289
01:21:27.301 --> 01:21:30.240
I never really thought about it and like I always thought that like,
yeah,

1290
01:21:30.241 --> 01:21:34.860
the bar's clean.
It's a bar soap.
There's always like armpit hair on it from him.

1291
01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:40.530
God,
it's nasty.
It's nasty.
You're nasties.
Yeah.
I'm just so useful.

1292
01:21:40.531 --> 01:21:44.580
It does Daniel not do anything horrendous like this to you?
No.
No.

1293
01:21:44.581 --> 01:21:46.500
I'm trying to think of like the gross.
Oh really?

1294
01:21:46.501 --> 01:21:51.220
How long have you guys been together?
Um,
we've been married for,
we,

1295
01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:54.330
we just had our four year anniversary and we have band.

1296
01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:57.390
We went together for like two to three years before that.
Oh,
that's good.

1297
01:21:59.630 --> 01:22:04.410
I think I'm actually the mark the grocer one between,
no,
no,

1298
01:22:04.411 --> 01:22:09.270
probably not.
He's more,
I'm more into open doors.
He's more into closed doors.

1299
01:22:09.450 --> 01:22:11.820
That's the one barrier I haven't crossed.

1300
01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:15.960
It means that if he's going to go take like a big all meaty shit,

1301
01:22:16.530 --> 01:22:20.540
he would like the door closed and he doesn't want me to know about it.
Oh yeah.

1302
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:24.420
You want him to know?
Well,
for the longest time I said I did,

1303
01:22:24.421 --> 01:22:27.910
but I think it's more like I resented him wanting privacy.
Sure.

1304
01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:32.580
But then I think Cathy,
I think
that's good.
Awesome.

1305
01:22:33.450 --> 01:22:36.620
How dare you erect a boundary.
Um,

1306
01:22:36.930 --> 01:22:40.410
there have been a couple of times where the door is actually open and then he'll

1307
01:22:40.411 --> 01:22:42.870
like sort of walk towards the bathroom and I'll be like,

1308
01:22:42.871 --> 01:22:45.840
can you close the door please?
And I realized I actually don't want,
I don't want,

1309
01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:47.580
but you left it open.
Yeah,

1310
01:22:47.581 --> 01:22:51.510
I did because I thought he was in the other end of that house when it really

1311
01:22:51.511 --> 01:22:53.940
comes down to it.
I don't want him to watch me Shit.
Yeah.

1312
01:22:53.941 --> 01:22:56.790
And that's the one thing I don't want Tom to know.
He thought I did.

1313
01:22:57.210 --> 01:22:58.530
I was wrong just because,

1314
01:22:58.670 --> 01:23:02.670
but you thought you did not because you enjoy that per se so much as you're like

1315
01:23:02.671 --> 01:23:05.230
why is there a privacy boundaries?
Yes.
I wanted the,

1316
01:23:05.231 --> 01:23:07.830
I had this idea that there should be like 100% x.

1317
01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:11.770
I was actually just listening to an episode of,
of your mom's house.

1318
01:23:11.790 --> 01:23:14.180
It's like two episodes ago.
Um,

1319
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:17.650
when they hear the surprise of that time when we'll be off.
But Tom,

1320
01:23:17.651 --> 01:23:21.310
you were saying that nothing Christina does could ever gross you out.

1321
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:26.110
She could shit on you and you'd be totally fine with.
Yeah.
That was so romantic.

1322
01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:29.530
Well,
it's true actually.
That was very sweet.
He's never smelled.
Oh my God,

1323
01:23:29.531 --> 01:23:32.380
that's not true.
You don't smell me enough.
I smell you all the time.

1324
01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:33.813
He's never had be,
oh,

1325
01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:36.940
not even during pregnancy because there's some funk that happens.

1326
01:23:36.941 --> 01:23:40.240
That's what I'm telling him.
I'm like,
I just smelled different when I'm pregnant.

1327
01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:43.870
My everything smells different on me.
Real Musky.
Yeah.
No,

1328
01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:47.340
he doesn't even notice it.
You don't smell it.

1329
01:23:47.341 --> 01:23:51.920
You don't have any bio so sweet.
Yeah,
but that,

1330
01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:53.171
but Allison,
it's not,

1331
01:23:53.171 --> 01:23:57.160
I don't know if it's so much a function of sweetness or that he such as checked

1332
01:23:57.161 --> 01:23:58.990
out a pig.
No,
not checked out,

1333
01:23:58.991 --> 01:24:03.991
but he's so at home with himself and the horror king and the blowing snot

1334
01:24:05.051 --> 01:24:08.440
rockets and the spreads spreads that to him.

1335
01:24:08.441 --> 01:24:13.441
The bar is so low in terms of what grosses him out or high rather the bar is

1336
01:24:14.741 --> 01:24:18.640
high.
Yeah.
So like nothing can phase you because you're not phased by you.

1337
01:24:18.670 --> 01:24:22.480
Do you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
You're pretty open.
That's pretty good though.

1338
01:24:22.481 --> 01:24:23.920
No.
If it's romance but,

1339
01:24:26.050 --> 01:24:27.490
but we don't share with the door open.

1340
01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:31.750
That is the one boundary and you don't like it when I talked to you through the

1341
01:24:31.751 --> 01:24:36.180
door,
I feel like you don't,
you want your alone time,
like shitting in peace.

1342
01:24:36.230 --> 01:24:39.910
The less is more because that's my time is your time.
Yeah.
I like to just,

1343
01:24:39.911 --> 01:24:44.200
you know,
not talk during that.
Yeah,
I understand.
Yeah.

1344
01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:47.200
And I don't,
I don't want you to see me shit either.
I don't like it.

1345
01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:51.580
I don't think you ever go through a phase where you did.
No.
Okay.
No,
it's just me.

1346
01:24:51.581 --> 01:24:54.910
This is my own thing.
Then I guess.
No,
a lot of couples are very,
I know,

1347
01:24:54.911 --> 01:24:57.040
I know people that are are fine with it.

1348
01:24:57.130 --> 01:24:59.560
We knew a couple that one would be taking a dump on,

1349
01:24:59.561 --> 01:25:03.590
the other one would be eating her morning Bagel.
And that's too much to me.

1350
01:25:03.610 --> 01:25:04.443
And talking to him,

1351
01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:09.210
<v 0>he's sitting there plopping and she's just like,
yeah,
so,</v>

1352
01:25:09.211 --> 01:25:12.220
and I would see them and I'm like,
cause I knew him real well and I'm like,

1353
01:25:12.690 --> 01:25:14.180
you just got to eat that in front of them when they,

1354
01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:18.360
and they were like looking at us like,
what?
Like how did you know who told you?

1355
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:22.170
Who revealed that this is what they do or how do I saw I saw it because he was a

1356
01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:27.180
close roommate of mine.
Oh Shit.
All the time.
But when they were dating,

1357
01:25:27.181 --> 01:25:27.511
I'm like,

1358
01:25:27.511 --> 01:25:31.440
you're just gonna stand there and eat that while he shits and she need the

1359
01:25:31.441 --> 01:25:36.180
registered as the men frequently shit in front of each other.
Um,
no,

1360
01:25:36.181 --> 01:25:40.140
but you know,
there's a thing where like if you're like really good,
good friends,

1361
01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:44.790
you don't want it to happen.
But it's like you don't go like,
oh my God,

1362
01:25:44.791 --> 01:25:48.540
I'm so sorry.
Like you do it would with like a stranger or somebody.
So it's like,

1363
01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:52.800
I dunno,
you just kind of,
I dunno.

1364
01:25:53.670 --> 01:25:57.540
It's like a bonding thing.
It's more like a ball busting thing.

1365
01:25:58.040 --> 01:25:59.250
Like you're taking a shit.
Yeah.

1366
01:25:59.251 --> 01:26:02.040
And sometimes you have conversations and then come in here,

1367
01:26:02.041 --> 01:26:02.910
I've got to tell you something.

1368
01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:08.780
Like you want them to run into the part of it.
Yeah.

1369
01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:13.160
That makes sense.
Yeah.
That's bothers me about the eating of the Bagel.

1370
01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:15.860
It's just that you're eating in a room.
Excuse me.

1371
01:26:15.861 --> 01:26:18.770
Where there's shit flex everywhere and the air.
Yeah.

1372
01:26:19.010 --> 01:26:23.070
It's not a sanitary eating conditions.
Nasty for sure.
Yeah.

1373
01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:26.240
I'm not sure I agree with that.
Helen asked you for doing that.
Yeah.

1374
01:26:26.241 --> 01:26:29.050
I don't have many like weird things about pooping.
It's up,

1375
01:26:29.051 --> 01:26:33.650
but that to eat a Bagel and cream cheese is out and all the guys shit,

1376
01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:38.200
shit flex or in the air,
the germs.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

1377
01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:40.460
That's not right.
We think of this.

1378
01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:45.430
<v 11>Hi,
my name's Becca.
Hi,
I'm Amy.
How are you?
Good.
How are you?</v>

1379
01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:50.470
Oh,
I'm bored already.
Your personal philosophy.

1380
01:26:51.970 --> 01:26:53.850
My personal philosophy of rehabilitation.

1381
01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:06.310
<v 0>Isn't that what is that is her laugh?
Isn't that just yes.</v>

1382
01:27:06.510 --> 01:27:11.010
Yeah.
I thought that was like something falling over or her fart or something.
No,

1383
01:27:11.150 --> 01:27:15.410
that's her left.
Audio is great by the way.

1384
01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:19.460
The quality is,
you can tell in the kitchen there.
It's very nice.

1385
01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:23.370
<v 11>Yeah,
so my personal philosophy of rehabilitation.</v>

1386
01:27:29.530 --> 01:27:32.950
<v 0>No,
that's not her.
That is her laugh.
Yes,
it is.</v>

1387
01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:35.770
Well,
it's her left.

1388
01:27:37.230 --> 01:27:38.470
<v 12>Oh,
right here.</v>

1389
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:47.200
<v 0>Girl uses lung infection for,</v>

1390
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:54.500
oh my God.
Yeah.
By the way,
this is too much personal info,

1391
01:27:54.501 --> 01:27:57.260
but Christina,
you know who you asked how the home search is going,

1392
01:27:57.410 --> 01:28:01.880
the way that kitchen looks.
I feel like we've seen a lot of houses.
We saw

1393
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:11.270
it's an infection.
She needs to go to the doctor.
Yes,

1394
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:17.520
that's a bad cough.
She has pneumonia.

1395
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:21.540
What if there was someone who sounded like that at your show?
Oh my goodness.

1396
01:28:21.890 --> 01:28:24.140
I've had a few times.
Yeah.

1397
01:28:25.110 --> 01:28:29.250
The funny thing is most of the time the better rule is to completely ignore it,

1398
01:28:29.251 --> 01:28:33.060
even if nobody else is,
because it becomes such a distraction for the show.

1399
01:28:33.450 --> 01:28:37.290
But I've had a few times where I had to address it.
It was so crazy.
You know,

1400
01:28:37.291 --> 01:28:41.940
one time a guy was sitting the front row,
he was actually loving the show,

1401
01:28:41.970 --> 01:28:46.830
like the kind of person you want at your show.
He was beating the table.

1402
01:28:46.831 --> 01:28:47.510
Okay.

1403
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:52.510
And laughing so hard at even minor things that Andy and his laugh was,

1404
01:28:54.570 --> 01:28:57.810
it wasn't like this,
but it was a,
it was a different sounding lab.

1405
01:28:57.811 --> 01:29:02.280
It sounded like he was in a struggle for his life because laughed,
you know?
So

1406
01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:04.410
<v 6>at a certain point I was just like,
dude.</v>

1407
01:29:04.730 --> 01:29:07.530
And I thought that cause what happens is when you address somebody about their

1408
01:29:07.531 --> 01:29:08.190
laugh,

1409
01:29:08.190 --> 01:29:12.090
sometimes you kind of ruin the show for them and they start to feel really.
Yeah.

1410
01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:14.640
But he went right into it.
He didn't care like so it was fine.

1411
01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:17.830
One time I had this weird sound,
it was like

1412
01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:23.880
like a Darth Vader sound and I was like,
this is so weird,
man.

1413
01:29:23.881 --> 01:29:28.010
I didn't want to address it.
And Lo and behold,
some poor person was on lake

1414
01:29:29.970 --> 01:29:33.440
and I was like,
you know there's laws and the,
and you'd hear

1415
01:29:37.410 --> 01:29:42.410
[inaudible] she sounds definitely sick.

1416
01:29:46.671 --> 01:29:47.880
She used to go to doctors die.

1417
01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:54.220
He died with some penicillin [inaudible] selling.

1418
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:59.100
You know what it is?
She was on her way out of like a bronchial infection.

1419
01:29:59.630 --> 01:30:03.720
Like she,
she had been really sick and now she's able to go to work.

1420
01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:05.670
But it's still,
the remnants are still there.

1421
01:30:06.050 --> 01:30:10.980
Gross sounds like FIFA when he chokes himself when,
yeah,
that's right.
Oh,

1422
01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:13.760
your house,
your house shopping.
Is that what I picked up on?

1423
01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:17.880
We have been for a long,
long,
long time.
Oh really?
Yeah.

1424
01:30:17.881 --> 01:30:21.690
We sort of were like were into it and then we stop and then we go get back to
it.

1425
01:30:21.691 --> 01:30:26.430
And now we're very serious again.
But um,
it's just hard to find anything that,
uh,

1426
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.850
you're going to compromise in one place and we don't want to compromise,

1427
01:30:29.851 --> 01:30:31.890
so therefore we won't ever own a house.

1428
01:30:33.690 --> 01:30:38.540
Now you'll find it.
I think we will.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1429
01:30:39.090 --> 01:30:42.480
Now we saw a lot of houses like that too,
with the kitchen.
We were,

1430
01:30:42.510 --> 01:30:45.960
it was when Lj was a baby.
We go house searching.
I remember went house,

1431
01:30:45.961 --> 01:30:50.010
we went into it.
It was so sad looking and Ella started crying right away.

1432
01:30:50.010 --> 01:30:53.700
We're like,
we got it.
Go.
It can be real depressing.
It really is.

1433
01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:59.250
Really is as I imagine other just big cities are,
fuck man,
this is what I'm,

1434
01:30:59.610 --> 01:31:04.030
this is my level,
right?
Well,
we will,
right.
And our level has crept,

1435
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:07.530
like the price that we wanted to pay when we started.

1436
01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:10.770
It's gone up so much just because it's like,
oh,

1437
01:31:10.830 --> 01:31:13.060
there's nothing you can get at that.
You know?
I mean,

1438
01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:15.990
luckily it's gone up a little bit.
What we're able to afford it,

1439
01:31:15.991 --> 01:31:19.560
but just what was our comp?
It's not even about our comfort zone.

1440
01:31:19.561 --> 01:31:22.650
It's just like we're going to pay everything we possibly can.
Um,

1441
01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:25.950
and when we were still helping to find,
I don't know,
you know,
it's just,

1442
01:31:26.370 --> 01:31:29.520
there's a lot of Nice places that are very small and we want space and that's

1443
01:31:29.521 --> 01:31:33.960
the challenge.
That's always a challenge.
La La.
Um,

1444
01:31:34.050 --> 01:31:37.860
before we leave the book,
yes,

1445
01:31:37.861 --> 01:31:40.920
tropical attire and,
and other phrases that scare me.

1446
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:43.440
Is it available everywhere where books are available will be available

1447
01:31:43.441 --> 01:31:44.340

all right.

1458
01:32:22.121 --> 01:32:26.980
This a closing song is psycho ball hog by Dj Bill Cosby.

1459
01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:31.870
I have not heard it.
I don't know.
Uh,
I can imagine what it's about.
Anything else,

1460
01:32:31.871 --> 01:32:35.940
Jean?
I'm just so impressed with anybody that writes a book.

[inaudible] to secure a serial killer.

1464
01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:09.020
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1465
01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:40.050
I just want to smash your

1466
01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:45.013
out.

1467
01:33:56.110 --> 01:33:57.110
My husband is a psycho.

1468
01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:03.970
That's the serial killer tone.

1469
01:34:05.170 --> 01:34:10.170
Complete lack of emotion every time was this fucking Sera Caroline.

1470
01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:14.050
Most of my brain is saying,
I got to get away.

1471
01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:17.950
He's going to fucking hit me over the head with a hammer.

1472
01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:23.320
I can't control myself.

1473
01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:38.520
[inaudible]

1474
01:34:46.630 --> 01:34:47.860
it's broken.
