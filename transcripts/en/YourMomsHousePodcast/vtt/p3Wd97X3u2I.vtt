70
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.550
let's get into it.
Let's do it.

71
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.270
A little tiny picker.
Got that shirt.

72

but it's your car.
You can't get it up.

73
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.983
<v 2>Christina,</v>

74
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.280
<v 0>do you know like 25 times this weekend?</v>

75
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:11.030
I listened to that young Patriot on ob tone.
I know.
It's really good.

76
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.240
It's really good.
I mean,
it's

77
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.060
a young patriot.

78
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:21.320
Put It on Spotify so people have to type in to find it.

79
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.580
I think young is y,

80
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:27.560
U N G and then Patrion ta te Reo ends called Cool Guy Club,

81
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.630
so look up young patriarch,
Cool Guy Club.
It's on there.
It's tremendous.

82
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:37.280
It really is.
They really know.
I'll be ones on that one.
He made the,

83
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:40.590
he produced this unbeatable team.
Those two guys.
Yeah.

84
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.320
That's such a good song.
So many revelations you guys.

85
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:48.950
But first of all,
that opening clip.
Oh yeah.

86
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.980
I mean why does shit always happen at the home depot?

87
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.670
Home Depot has a lot of shit going on and most of it's in the parking lot.

88
00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.710
I know it kind of is.
Yeah.
I avoid going to it for that reason because a,

89
00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:05.360
the home depot so enormous,
they're just so big and cavernous.
You always lost.

90
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.740
The great irony is that the worst is that like they have everything and like no

91
00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:11.960
one can help.
No help.
You're just on your own.

92
00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:14.960
I went there one time looking for something,
I think,
I dunno,

93
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:17.390
a tool or something and I ran in this guy.
I was like,

94
00:07:17.391 --> 00:07:22.250
I'm looking for this and he like,
ah,
I work in plants.
I was like,
plants.

95
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.130
I was like,
yeah,
there's a whole now Terry and whatever it's called.

96
00:07:26.131 --> 00:07:30.640
And he's like,
you need a like a Bush or a tree or say,
Oh man,
I want,

97
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.800
I want like a hammer.
And he's like,
that's not my department.

98
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.550
And then you just look,
it looks like an airport hangar behind.
It's tremendous.

99
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.770
Or even like one time I tried to buy paint and I just,
I just started crying.

100
00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:45.140
I'm like,
there's just too many things to choose from.

101
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.250
God forbid you want somebody to mix the color for it's,
it's just,

102
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.630
that's why you're like you really hopeless.
That's why you really appreciate,
uh,

103
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:58.670
awesome.
Um,
customer service people.
Cause they're not everywhere.

104
00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:59.870
They change your life.
Yeah.

105
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.750
I think that's why people go crazy in the parking lot because they've been in

106
00:08:02.751 --> 00:08:07.490
the home depot for an hour.
They feel lost.
They feel alone.
They feel confused.

107
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.300
I just had a,
I had an almost meltdown the other day.

108
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.580
And the Home Depot?
No,
with Fedex.
No,
I have a FedEx account.

109
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.370
I'm a huge fan of,
no,
I am,
but here's what happened.
So you know,

110
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.310
I'm home,
I press,
I'm home here now.

111
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.680
I've press two labels.
I print two labels.
Yeah,

112
00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.930
but I'm in a separate room than the printer.
So when I go to the printer,

113
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:38.060
there's nothing there and I realize,
oh,
we have a new printer so I have to,

114
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.760
you know,
align it with,
right.
With the Wifi and the computers.

115
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:43.580
Sprinters are another,

116
00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.520
how do you think they can just ever just make a printer that you just need,

117
00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:50.380
just turn it on and it just fucking prince.
They're like,
all right,

118
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.850
you have the latest software upgrades.
You're like,
I dunno.

119
00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.670
No paper to go through it.
So,
so annoying.

120
00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.800
When I go back to my laptop,
the last thing that I have printed,

121
00:08:59.801 --> 00:09:03.690
the last label still there after I connect them and I'm able to reprint it,

122
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.270
I print it.
I'm like,
okay,
what about the previous one?
The one that I closed,

123
00:09:09.271 --> 00:09:13.980
I printed two labels,
so I'm at the Fedex site and I'm like,

124
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:14.550
okay,

125
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:18.480
there's gotta be a way that you can see what you printed and then reprint it,

126
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:23.490
right.
I go,
I'm like,
I'll go through the shipping stuff.

127
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.020
I go to the uh,
tracking.
I'm like,
oh,

128
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.300
it probably be in the tracking.
And then you could pull up the label.

129
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.000
I'm not kidding you.
I spent half an hour,

130
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:38.660
I then Google I youtube how to reprint the format that's in the youtube video is

131
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:42.960
not the current format.
So I'm losing my fucking mind.

132
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.790
I go to Fedex with the,
you know,
the label that I have,
I want,
here you go.

133
00:09:47.791 --> 00:09:51.450
And I tell the guy,
he goes,
we can't do that.
You can't do what?

134
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.660
We can't pull up your account.
I have it.
I go,

135
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.860
I'm explaining to you my issue.
He goes,
yeah,
yeah,

136
00:09:58.861 --> 00:10:03.560
we can't pull up any of your stuff and we can't do whatever you did on your,

137
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.350
we have no access to any of it.
Like that's what he leads with.
I'm like,

138
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:12.900
so what if I were to log into my head,
cause you can't do this here.
You can't,

139
00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.610
nothing,
nothing you want to do,
I could help you with.
And I'm like,
all right man,

140
00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:19.440
it's the worst.
And then I'm like,

141
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:23.580
so there's just no way when I'm explaining is is accessible or possible,

142
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:28.740
I can have you talked to our manager.
I'm like,
all right.
Then I see.
I'm like,

143
00:10:28.741 --> 00:10:31.230
where's the,
and then he looks right.
He's like,
I don't know,

144
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:35.820
but she's an assistant manager.
I'm like,
all right.
So I go up to her and I,

145
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:41.130
I'm,
of course,
I tell her I'm just super frustrated,
but I tell her calmly,
I go,

146
00:10:41.131 --> 00:10:43.140
you know,
I just went through this whole thing.
I tell her,

147
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.060
I tell her the whole thing that I just told you,

148
00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.070
but I go and I just don't know what she goes,

149
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.490
do you know you can you log into your account here?
And I go,
yeah.

150
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:53.040
So I log in and sh,

151
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:57.060
and the secret is that the reprint is in,

152
00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.890
is under create a shipment.

153
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:03.690
So like if you were to start a new shipment,
you'd go create a shipment.

154
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.940
You click that.
Then the reprint thing is in there.
So she's like,

155
00:11:08.941 --> 00:11:12.480
it's kind of like counterintuitive,
but she's super nice about it and I go,

156
00:11:12.481 --> 00:11:17.130
you're just like,
you know,
relieve my whole stress and,
and thank you so much.

157
00:11:17.131 --> 00:11:20.760
You know,
she was very nice.
She actually was like a,

158
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.910
she goes by the way she had finished.
She goes,
I love your stuff.
I'm like,
oh,

159
00:11:23.911 --> 00:11:27.870
thanks a lot.
And then as I'm walking out,
another guy goes,
hey man,

160
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:32.190
um,
you're,
you're the comedian.
I go,
yeah.
He goes,
you've really gotten better.

161
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:36.780
And I go,
thanks.
And he goes,
yeah,
you just kind of way more polished now.

162
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.840
I used to listen to you all the time.
I was like,
okay,

163
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:44.600
thanks Pam for the critique at the Fed and that's wonderful.

164
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:49.420
But how fucking stupid is it to have a reprint of something standard create.

165
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.010
Even hearing you say it,
it makes me,
it gives me

166
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.340
<v 1>anxiety and it makes me mad that I'm wasting time in my life.</v>

167
00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:02.120
Even fucking thinking about stuff like that.
It's pretty bad.
It's terrible.
Um,

168
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.940
anyways,
can I,
this woman's amazing.
She's clearly mentally ill,

169
00:12:06.941 --> 00:12:10.210
right?
Yeah.
Are we going to go for mental illness or drugs on this one?

170
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.830
<v 0>Definitely not on drugs.
She's a,</v>

171
00:12:12.831 --> 00:12:16.490
and also she's completely unreasonable for people listening or even watching.

172
00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.420
She's upset at the car parked next to her saying it's too close.

173
00:12:20.421 --> 00:12:25.070
And she's the one that parked out of line.
All of the words she parked off of,

174
00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.810
out of the two lines.
Yeah.
And she's mad at the guy who parked correctly,

175
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:33.200
who's now too close to her because of how she parked.
Yeah.
Yeah.

176
00:12:33.201 --> 00:12:36.770
She's definitely just start.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Is there any more of her there is,
right?

177
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.800
Yeah.
I mean she's,
yeah.
She's like,
you should go to your car.

178
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.030
<v 4>My daughter has to get in.</v>

179
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.350
<v 1>No,
you did dummy.</v>

180
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.283
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

181
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:57.800
<v 0>Well let me,
let me tell you something about this too.
She parties,
I can close.</v>

182
00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:02.830
This is the difference because this woman really needs to get checked.

183
00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:06.200
Okay.
And if she were a guy,

184
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.040
she would already have had her ass kicked in her life a number of times with

185
00:13:10.041 --> 00:13:11.150
this attitude.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep.

186
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:16.870
This is where at least another woman needs to put her in a choke hold or shower

187
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:22.430
rods.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Because she's,
she's so,

188
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:27.840
she's so entitled and,
and,
and throws this fucking attitude of the wound and,

189
00:13:27.841 --> 00:13:32.450
and people allow it.
There's some guys would be like,
all right,
I'll move my car.

190
00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.990
And she really just needs a woman.
Yeah,

191
00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:38.350
<v 1>yeah,
yeah.
To throw an elbow.
Her man,
you and I discussed this yesterday,</v>

192
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:43.380
is that that's how boys and men resolve conflicts is physically women just don't

193
00:13:43.631 --> 00:13:47.020
resolve conflict that way.
Well,
when you've been checked as a guy,

194
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.830
you don't go,
so what would you do if this were you?

195
00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:53.330
You wouldn't even say anything.
He'd be like,
all right,
well

196
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:57.700
<v 0>if you're,
if I was this woman,
first of all,
it's,
you know,</v>

197
00:13:57.701 --> 00:14:02.500
it takes a fraction of a second to realize that she's Adeline with how she

198
00:14:02.501 --> 00:14:06.940
parked.
Yeah.
And then to make unreasonable demands on top of that.
I mean,

199
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:12.340
as a guy,
I don't know,
I'm just,
I'm not insane.
So I would just be like,

200
00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:15.280
I know I'd be out at like I maybe I don't want to move my car.

201
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.770
Maybe it's humiliating to have to move my car.

202
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:22.480
But knowing if there's another guy there who's like,
I didn't do anything wrong.

203
00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:23.920
Part of your,
your,

204
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:29.040
your DNA wiring as a guy starts to just automatically size up who's telling you.

205
00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:33.490
Of course you don't have the right like a guy fucking is like,

206
00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:38.170
hey dude,
your,
your brain just goes like,
can this guy fuck me up?

207
00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.880
<v 1>Yeah.
But that's cause you,</v>

208
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:44.540
cause you guys are apes and you resolve conflict by hitting each other.

209
00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.910
That's true.
So I'm saying there's a value in that.

210
00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:51.230
There is a value in that physical violence there is there.
I agree with you.
No,

211
00:14:51.231 --> 00:14:52.340
I agree with you.
Yeah.

212
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.520
Because you don't start bullshit like this and parking lots because you know

213
00:14:55.521 --> 00:14:57.990
some guys going to beat your ass so there's no,
exactly.

214
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:02.660
And then Shari around shit mark if she's fucking 70 [inaudible] around for a

215
00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:04.910
whole fucking money now.
And that's what I want to be clear.

216
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:08.150
I didn't say a guy should do anything to her.
He shouldn't a woman,

217
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.240
she'd kick her ass.
I wish women are,

218
00:15:10.241 --> 00:15:13.610
you say you're advocating that women should start violence with each other?

219
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.730
I think sometimes I think it's good.
Yeah.
You know,

220
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:22.460
kind of makes you had it kind of makes you second guessed saying stupid shit.

221
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.190
That's what,
that's what it does.
It does.
I'll tell you something,

222
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:29.890
cause I don't do this in public for a reason because I've been in fights with,

223
00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:33.370
I shouldn't say right loosely that I've been beaten up.
Yeah.

224
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.110
I have not successfully won a fight.

225
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.660
So I know not to flip shit to strangers.

226
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:43.340
Even almost getting your ass kicked makes you aware of the physical danger of,

227
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.310
of watching your stupid fucking mouth.
Yeah.
You know?

228
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.690
Well she just never been hit.

229
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:51.790
So you're saying is this bench needs to get hit a couple of times?
Yeah.

230
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.290
By a lady.
I should hit her.
Yeah.

231
00:15:55.390 --> 00:16:00.250
<v 4>Does she do this a lot?
Is She okay?
No,
she's fine.
She's not fine.
You're not fine.</v>

232
00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:03.370
Do you see your tire?
Let's give serious.
Yeah.
Look,
it gets serious.

233
00:16:03.371 --> 00:16:06.610
You see the line that separates these tires.
Now come over here.
Come over here.

234
00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.630
Come on.
This is just for fun.
And then look at this.
I mean,

235
00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:12.130
<v 1>she's out of her fucking mind.
Yeah,
she's wrong.</v>

236
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:16.700
<v 4>Oh,
for tire is right on that one.
You need to stay within the lines,</v>

237
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.330
but look,
look,
I'm perfectly the line.

238
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.530
I'm actually hugging this side a little too much.

239
00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:31.580
<v 1>And then her,
she was not helping is her daughter with her little panda backpack.</v>

240
00:16:31.581 --> 00:16:33.120
A grown ass woman.
I know.

241
00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:37.050
Fucking child's backpack is siding with her mom.

242
00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:42.270
What happened to Tom the half to know if your mom was doing this nonsense?

243
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:44.250
I'd be like,
mom,
no,
I've done shit.

244
00:16:44.251 --> 00:16:48.060
My mom has done shit like this pops off at the mouth all the time.

245
00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.980
You should have gotten her ass years ago.
But I,
we've all,
my mom's kids,

246
00:16:52.981 --> 00:16:56.500
we've all been like,
mom,
the fuck are you talking about?
Can you know?
And like,

247
00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:00.990
that's usually how this picture is that the logical person goes,

248
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:05.920
mom,
fuck you dad should have hit your mom a little bit more.
No,
no,

249
00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:07.080
that's not what I was saying.

250
00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:12.190
<v 4>[inaudible] loca back you.
Oh Mary,
go</v>

251
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:19.020
crazy fucker.
You crazy.
It's my mom right there.
100%.
No,

252
00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:24.010
it was shit.
You're fucking,
oh bitch,
you,
I'm in a car like that asshole.

253
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:28.050
You're not happy,
man.
Oh,
sorry.
I am.
Yeah.

254
00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:33.060
To be driving a car like that.
I'm in disbelief.
This is something,

255
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:37.840
a little tiny picker.
This is the need that that is.
Your Dick isn't yet.

256
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.490
You proud of your own fucking Dick,

257
00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:43.630
but it's your car that you can't get it up by.
I got my ass.

258
00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:48.280
You get him off by them in a woman.
No,
I'm not fighting.

259
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:49.620
I'm fighting with a woman.
You

260
00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:55.330
<v 1>Eh,
you stupid shit.
So insane.
It gives me anxiety.
Northern California.
Yeah,</v>

261
00:17:55.331 --> 00:17:58.120
it looks like it.
I'm only saying this because she's Asian.

262
00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:04.500
I would say.
Yeah,
like Morin County.
And what are you,
what's your,

263
00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:09.160
why are you saying he's Asian?
I agree.
It's not la.

264
00:18:09.161 --> 00:18:11.560
I don't feel like it's Alhambra.
Only because,

265
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.210
or Monterey Park Asians

266
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.053
<v 4>are</v>

267
00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.230
<v 1>it a Chinese guy for 40 year.
Everywhere there was.
It was like,
yeah,</v>

268
00:18:18.231 --> 00:18:22.190
but that's where you go for good Chinese because that's where they are now.

269
00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:26.510
Because then she'd have an accent.
This could be fucking Dallas anywhere,

270
00:18:26.511 --> 00:18:31.130
but I just,
my my Asian instinct.
It is right.

271
00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.393
It's Chino.

272
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:38.350
<v 4>Oh,
I'm not finding it all.
Sounds good.</v>

273
00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:43.140
<v 1>So that's why I guess northern California,
because he sounds homosexual.
What?</v>

274
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.990
He sounds like a gay guy.
He sounds like a guy like a gay guys.
Sound good to you?

275
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:48.600
Of course.
Listen

276
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:55.310
to this guy would beat you up.
This guy 100% no,
no.

277
00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.153
Cause

278
00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.673
<v 4>yeah,</v>

279
00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:06.040
<v 1>he's not even aggressive man.
No,
he's not aggressive.
Like,</v>

280
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:07.210
I can't take this anymore.

281
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:16.170
<v 4>I'll take you down.
You set up a pitch that's threatening,
but it's not,</v>

282
00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:21.660
<v 1>but it's not.
He sounds like the [inaudible] guy.
He could be.</v>

283
00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:22.560
You know what I would do though,

284
00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:25.710
because this bitch is about to walk into home depot is just park a little bit

285
00:19:25.711 --> 00:19:30.000
closer to her car.
Credible inches,

286
00:19:30.001 --> 00:19:35.001
closer difference between Tom and me is that I do not encourage unnecessary

287
00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:40.320
conflict.
Unnecessary.
You love it.
You love the Instagram fights.

288
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.800
I posted something very controversial,

289
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:49.070
my account at the Christina p on Instagram and you went after bitches like crazy

290
00:19:51.211 --> 00:19:54.580
and I was like,
I'm out.
I'm just here to enjoy the ride it fun.

291
00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.960
It's fun.
That's why we're married.

292
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:04.500
I kept having fantasies about knowing that someone that we're breaking down

293
00:20:04.501 --> 00:20:09.150
mentally
got about them crying at home.

294
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:13.740
Yeah.
Okay.
Listen,
fucking armpit hair.
All right.
All right.
Listen,

295
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.040
I have been dying to share this with you.

296
00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:23.010
You got to pay attention and he full attention.
Phones down.
As you know,

297
00:20:23.011 --> 00:20:26.760
I did this last weekend at the Acme Comedy Club in Minneapolis tits and just so

298
00:20:26.761 --> 00:20:27.211
people know,

299
00:20:27.211 --> 00:20:31.560
the reason that things are sometimes there's an intro separated the touring,

300
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.680
he's kind of wild and we don't ever want to miss a week,

301
00:20:34.681 --> 00:20:38.250
so we have to record things separately from win.
Right.

302
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:42.240
And tomorrow where it's a lot.
Yeah,
it's a lot.
Oh,
something's coming out here.

303
00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:44.640
Okay.
Anyways,

304
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:50.470
I did this weekend and mini apple tits and I had this wonderful opener named

305
00:20:50.471 --> 00:20:55.150
Ahmed Colloff.
Okay.
Okay.
He goes by Somalian,

306
00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.640
s o m o l l y.
A N on Instagram.

307
00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:02.660
Give him a shout out because he's a black guy and he said,

308
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:08.920
I,
we were talking about though,
tried out guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And he goes,

309
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:12.910
it's homey on now.
I got it.
It's not homey on out.
We've done this before.
He goes,

310
00:21:12.911 --> 00:21:13.720
it's only an hour.

311
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:18.720
And listened to me because he is talking to black guys who liked to fuck and

312
00:21:20.141 --> 00:21:23.680
fuck good.
The audience he's addressing,

313
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:28.540
they are black guys and black guys would say,
homie on out,

314
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.820
hello man out.
I mean,
hello,
does not blow your mind right now.

315
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:37.810
<v 0>Well,
no,
I mean I,
I thought that was always one of the theories on,
on it.</v>

316
00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:41.990
<v 1>I never thought of it that way.
That who he's speaking to their black men.</v>

317
00:21:41.991 --> 00:21:45.140
So therefore the phrasing he would use would be like,
uh,
you know,

318
00:21:45.141 --> 00:21:49.750
black men all Minnow Holla man out.
He's,

319
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.470
he's,
he's street.
You know what I mean?
You're trying to like

320
00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.560
Holly Holm man out.

321
00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:01.760
<v 0>I know,
I know.
It's,
it's,
look,
it's,
I mean,
it's the fucking Zapruder film,
man.</v>

322
00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:05.700
It's study it for generations.
The only,

323
00:22:05.701 --> 00:22:10.000
there was some way to confirm what he was saying.
I know,

324
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.560
I know this mystery man.
But anyway,
I was blown away,

325
00:22:13.561 --> 00:22:16.700
but I thought it was pretty interesting.
I thought I would,
you know,
it's a great,

326
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:17.060
it's a,

327
00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:22.060
it is a great contribution to the analysis of what is said there.

328
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:27.270
I've always been most leaning into either home here,

329
00:22:27.271 --> 00:22:31.320
now we're home,
Ya know,
it's either how I think it's not,

330
00:22:31.321 --> 00:22:34.980
it's how a man out on minnow or I'm,
I'm home here now.

331
00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:36.660
Now the reason being he's addressing black guys,

332
00:22:36.661 --> 00:22:40.440
but he's also referring to his address and when he's clearly saying like,

333
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.460
this is the address,
come over,
do these things to me.

334
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.470
I'm home here now.
Make sense?
I'm just saying it could be,
you know,

335
00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.380
I know the debates go on.
I get message all the time.

336
00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:56.110
Sometimes when people sign up and they'll go,
by the way,
it's,
it's homey on it.

337
00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.040
You know what I mean?
Like,
yeah,
it'll be their sign off to a message about,

338
00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.880
it's one of the world's greatest mysteries,
mysteries and what,

339
00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:07.350
we may never know the truth,
but for now I'm going to have fun speculating.

340
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:10.830
I like it.
I like it.
Um,
by the way,
before we go any further,

341
00:23:10.831 --> 00:23:15.210
I want to make it clear that we are thrilled to be,

342
00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:16.323
um,

343
00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:21.440
doing this podcast here and in the new space in our studio so to speak.

344
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.520
And uh,

345
00:23:23.521 --> 00:23:27.630
I want to encourage you if you have not to check out the two other podcasts,

That audio comes out on Thursdays and the video is up on Fridays on this youtube

354
00:23:58.011 --> 00:24:01.550
channel.
The why mh youtube channel.
That show has been exploding.

355
00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:06.020
I'm wildly popular out of the gate and thank you very much for supporting it.

356
00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.251
I loved drew.

357
00:24:07.251 --> 00:24:12.190
I love that his show is doing so well with sickle cell too.
Wonderful.

358
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.700
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well that was just,
just getting started.
It's going to,

359
00:24:15.701 --> 00:24:18.010
it's going to get bigger and bigger.
Um,

360
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:22.550
I just did a hot ones,
truth or DAB,

361
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:27.470
which is their spinoff show.
Cool.
Think it is about if,

362
00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:31.970
if it's,
uh,
based on the schedule talking to them,

363
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:33.440
um,
as,

364
00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:38.620
as this podcast comes out that might be hitting youtube right then or maybe it's

365
00:24:39.171 --> 00:24:43.810
the week after I did it with Bertrand.
Um,

366
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:47.210
and the concept,
man,
it is rough.
That one really fucked me up.

367
00:24:47.211 --> 00:24:48.410
So when you do hot ones,

368
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:54.020
you do progressively hotter wings.
So he start with one and then,

369
00:24:54.021 --> 00:24:55.160
you know what I mean?
It's mild,

370
00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.280
it gets a little bit spicier and then you build up truth.

371
00:24:58.281 --> 00:25:02.150
Or Dav is like truth or dare.
But if you don't want to tell the truth,

372
00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:06.080
the only thing,
the only option is you eat a wing with the spiciest.

373
00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:09.800
So you start at a 10.
My God,
that's great.

374
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:15.140
I was crying and sweat.
And it sounds like you took a lot of dabs.
Oh yeah,
man.

375
00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:18.510
I mean he was asking you things,
you're like,
I can't fucking answer this shit.

376
00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.310
I was on the phone with you yesterday or whenever it was you finished felony.

377
00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.770
I was on the road and you're like,
I got shit,
I got it.

378
00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:29.810
Go Sean's new show and I have to go take a dump.
Dude.

379
00:25:29.811 --> 00:25:33.230
I had a couple of shifts in me.
Um,
it's cool because they do a,

380
00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:38.480
you do do owes.
So,
um,
uh,

381
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:42.920
they had,
uh,
Tiffany Haddish love Kevin Hart,

382
00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:46.670
Burt and I think there's another one and we're talking about like,

383
00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.710
be good for like other comedy Duos to go into,
you know,
like,

384
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.790
I dunno shop,
I probably do it.
Oh,
he'd be great.
Yeah.

385
00:25:55.791 --> 00:26:00.350
But like it's like you do it with like Callin or he's got that other a show with

386
00:26:00.351 --> 00:26:03.350
the mouse guy and then there's like,
um,

387
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:07.910
I don't know if like maybe my favorite murder that's two hosts,
you know,

388
00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.730
Karen and Georgia I think is her name.

389
00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.730
So there's all these like combos.
But it's like,

390
00:26:13.731 --> 00:26:18.731
it's a hilarious concept because when you're eating that you actually get into a

391
00:26:19.431 --> 00:26:21.740
delirium.
It's like doing shots.

392
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.980
So the further along the show gets,

393
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.970
you're so uncomfortable that he asks you something and he might just spit

394
00:26:28.971 --> 00:26:33.020
something out.
I'm glad I'm not doing,
I mean spit out like a thought.

395
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:36.920
Oh yeah.
Cause you're like,
you're so uncomfortable and you're like,

396
00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:42.290
what a great show.
Thank you Sean.
It's really funny.
It's really fun.

397
00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:43.710
Yeah.
People love it.

398
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:49.200
<v 1>Anyways,
so we went to a Laker game last night.
Yup.</v>

399
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:54.030
And I could not stop licking my chops.
It was really,

400
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:58.000
really awful.
Was at school that hadn't takes like that.

401
00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:03.660
You were really,
I was really licking my chops.
Um,

402
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:06.840
now here's the deal.
Oh,
here's your Instagram account.
Yeah.

403
00:27:06.841 --> 00:27:11.250
You posted a few videos of us yesterday at the game.
That's what the,
uh,

404
00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.810
you want to show it.
This is what the,
well,

yeah,

405
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:15.653

Just licking her lips.</v>

409
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.800

410
00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:39.900
Just look looking at,

411
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:43.050
And then there you are with your ridiculous,
listen,

412
00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:47.430
my friend Dion [inaudible] fresh [inaudible] tell you that my ancestors,

413
00:27:47.431 --> 00:27:51.730
my relatives would be so stoked on your top.
The Nice top Tommy.

414
00:27:51.731 --> 00:27:56.040
This is a good jacket.
Very nice.
Very expensive looking jacket.

415
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.440
This is,
you're making every eastern blocker proud homie.
Yeah.
I love this book.

416
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.370
I love it.
Hey Man,
I'm so excited that you're filing number.

417
00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:08.970
We ran into that dude.
Did you buy that?
Hey,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

418
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:14.190
Very nice jacket.
Very expensive.
Looks very nice to me.
Good work.
Yeah,

419
00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:18.960
color is very expensive.
Nice patterns.
Nice pattern.
A very good,

420
00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.420
you need the gold chain.
That's what everybody says.

421
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:24.360
Any and everybody said the gold chain is what's missing man.
Yeah.

422
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:27.360
So we went to the Laker game.
It's Super Fun.

423
00:28:27.361 --> 00:28:31.580
I was very disappointed though because Lebron was not playing last night.
Yeah,

424
00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:36.260
yeah.
He's got some injury and I had same cause he's not going to,

425
00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:40.980
well first of all,
as we all know,
I Lebron's amazing to watch.
So I like that.

426
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.190
And I feel like he has one of the biggest hogs on the team.

427
00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:49.110
Compression shorts or not.
I feel like I see it moving,
swinging,
working.
What?

428
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:49.650
Yeah.

429
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:53.880
And I was kind of disappointed in how many white guys there were on the court.

430
00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.550
It was the Utah Jazz.
Yeah.

431
00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.380
Lotta honkies by law they have to have like seven white guys.

432
00:28:58.381 --> 00:29:02.040
What are you talking about in,
uh,
in Utah?
That's a,
it's actual law.

433
00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:06.960
Why?
Because of the population demographics and they feel like there's a

434
00:29:06.961 --> 00:29:11.010
disproportionate number of white guys on the team that they have to have more

435
00:29:11.011 --> 00:29:13.560
white guys in their sports racist.
It's a little,

436
00:29:13.561 --> 00:29:15.740
it's a pretty controversial thing.
Should be,

437
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:19.230
that's stupid be who's ever the best know.
They don't care.
They're like,
no,

438
00:29:19.231 --> 00:29:22.120
it's gotta be some more white guys.
Same thing.
You know,

439
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:26.010
if you look at their college teams,
Byu,
they have like a lot of white guys.

440
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:29.310
Oh that's terrible.
It's terrible.
And it's terrible for the fans.

441
00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:32.010
It's also a completely made up.
It's not true.
So

442
00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.730
he got it.
But,

443
00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.790
but there were a lot of white guys playing with these discount tickets.

444
00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:40.960
Didn't like it at all.
Yeah.

445
00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:43.960
Cause you know they're not carrying shit in their pants.

446
00:29:43.961 --> 00:29:48.190
That's not why we watch basketball.
It's not why you watch basketball.

447
00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:51.850
Just care about the dicks.
That's horse.
Why do you think I liked them?
Box seats.

448
00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:54.200
I want to get the floor seats.
No,
no.

449
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:58.420
I got to keep you off the floor or at least take a Lola like a sauce pan.

450
00:29:58.421 --> 00:30:02.350
Hold under your mouth for all the drool you're going to be at.

451
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.660
I loved it.

452
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:15.310
You can't really see junk though.
You can't win when Lebron run.
No,
you can.

453
00:30:15.311 --> 00:30:20.310
I can.
I got my binoculars.
I looked down on their bringing in a suit.

454
00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:23.200
You can see why I liked to look.
Dude,

455
00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:27.490
he was wearing his suit but he had those big old clown shoes on.

456
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:28.990
Did you see that?

457
00:30:28.991 --> 00:30:33.730
He was wearing nice sneakers but they look like fucking clown shoes cause of how

458
00:30:33.731 --> 00:30:35.950
big his feed our.
Hey,
what do you think?

459
00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:42.100
I think they're probably a pretty big L.
My God.
Hell Yeah Dude.

460
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.450
Those fools out that big.
His penis.
Jesus Christ.

461
00:30:46.451 --> 00:30:49.270
You know what I love so much at the Laker Games,
it's my favorite thing.

462
00:30:49.271 --> 00:30:53.470
When they put the people in the audience on the big jumbo tron thing and they

463
00:30:53.471 --> 00:30:57.850
get to see themselves.
I could watch that all day.
So I was 15 lily that foot.

464
00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:02.290
Well,
yeah,
I mean Uber from a basketball player.
Mangled.

465
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:07.240
Oof.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's the price.
That's the cost for being the boss.

466
00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:13.020
Damn homie.
Cool.
How much to put those totes?
He's in your mouth talking,

467
00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:21.940
speaking to Tutsis next to some nice.
You gotta bring that a blue band.

468
00:31:21.941 --> 00:31:25.570
You're going to die again.
It's on my Instagram account.

469
00:31:25.571 --> 00:31:29.830
The Christina p look at it.
You're going to die.
So I get on first class.

470
00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:34.450
Ah,
I'm going to Barf.
I'm in a fucking vomit again.

471
00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:38.890
It's sat next to you,
dude.
I was sitting next to this guy.
This is in first class.

472
00:31:38.891 --> 00:31:43.150
He s he comes in all lumbering that you really let people know because people

473
00:31:43.151 --> 00:31:45.880
were like,
oh,
that's what you get for being in coach.
I'm like,
bitch,

474
00:31:45.881 --> 00:31:47.830
I don't fly coach.
And then

475
00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:53.650
he came in and wheezing and he had a huge fucking pot belly,

476
00:31:53.651 --> 00:31:55.270
like a booze bag belly and he was like,

477
00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.020
and then he sits down next to me and I see this.

478
00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:04.200
So he's wearing a flip flop and it looks like half a compression sock and his

479
00:32:04.481 --> 00:32:06.910
feet are just all different colors.

480
00:32:06.911 --> 00:32:11.140
The toes are different colors and then the big toenail is rotting off.

481
00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:15.850
It's got a green gang.
It looks like gang green.
How much,

482
00:32:15.851 --> 00:32:19.900
how much to put them in your mouth,
how much Lebron's or his foot?

483
00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.670
Lebron's all day.
Why?

484
00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:25.660
Because there was no fungus or like on the bronze.

485
00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:28.660
It didn't look like it really looked pretty jacked.
Well,

486
00:32:28.661 --> 00:32:32.740
who's fault would you put in your mouth?
This guy or Lebron's yellow Brown

487
00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.950
anyways,
and then he wreaks of booze.
It's the morning,

488
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.190
of course he orders more alcohol and then he tells me he's a missionary and he

489
00:32:43.191 --> 00:32:48.140
goes,
I'm going.
I just came from the Philippines and no,
I'm flying into Uganda.

490
00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:53.600
I'm like,
I wouldn't with those open sores on your feet,
you nasty as hell.

491
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.090
He should wear some closed toe shoes to Uganda.
Don't you think?

492
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.580
Can you believe this fool got on a plane like this,
bro?
People are fucking crazy.

493
00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:03.850
Open ceilings.
Worse

494
00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:09.980
that tank tops.
That's disgusting.
Armpits out,

495
00:33:09.981 --> 00:33:14.540
chest out,
Chin armpit flakes everywhere.

496
00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:18.520
Crazy people are so disrespectful.
I mean,

497
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:21.200
I think even a guy tell you as a city dweller,

498
00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:25.520
I think wearing flip flops in the street is inappropriate to begin with.

499
00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:29.420
If you live in a major city,
dude,
you could step on needles,
cockroaches,

500
00:33:29.421 --> 00:33:33.200
vomit dog shit.
But to get on a plane with your feet out,
it's just,

501
00:33:33.201 --> 00:33:36.800
it's not hygienic.
It's not cool.
It's not cool to other people,
right?

502
00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.420
It's just disrespectful.

503
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:43.130
I know people are going to be like big risky and you need people who flip flops.

504
00:33:43.131 --> 00:33:47.300
I don't fucking care.
It's gross.
It's nasty,
nasty,
bro.

505
00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:50.030
That's airborne.
All that nasty shit.
I'm sitting right now and I'm like,

506
00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:54.290
oh my God,
and he wants to talk to me.
Oh,
it's so fucking gross.
I hate everybody.

507
00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.900
Don't you just hate everybody?
Well,
this is what makes commercial travel.

508
00:33:56.901 --> 00:34:00.070
Air travel in America is just,
it's God disgust.

509
00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:04.040
It's like a greyhound bus and know,
you know,
he's got it together.
The Asians,

510
00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:08.450
they deal,
they fly more respectful.
I'm serious.
I was in the,

511
00:34:08.451 --> 00:34:11.810
I was in Hong Kong,
Singapore.

512
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:15.770
It's just like a different culture of like nobody boards would like,

513
00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:20.930
there's got to stink.
That's God just pissed on myself,

514
00:34:20.931 --> 00:34:24.470
but I got a flood.
No one's like that.
Well let's,

515
00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:29.210
they treat you like really nice in economy,
like a flu,

516
00:34:29.211 --> 00:34:33.170
a Cathay Pacific,
which is like the,
the big airline,
uh,

517
00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:36.560
think it's Hong Kong's airline.
Yeah.
And you know,

518
00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:39.860
the flight attendants treat you.
We flew economy,

519
00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:44.150
like civilized people and really nice and they served you meals in economy.

520
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:46.790
It's nice.
Really,
really nice.
Very good.

521
00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:50.510
So there was that,
um,
oh,

522
00:34:50.511 --> 00:34:53.960
I have a submission for you.
Um,

523
00:34:53.961 --> 00:34:57.650
this is from a guy on Instagram.
He DMD me.

524
00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:01.450
It goes by Jibo hone.
J Ibba.

525
00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:02.930
H.
O.
E.
H.
N.

526
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:07.930
He suggested a name for women who have sex with comedians.

527
00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:12.920
Oh,
what is it?
Ready?
Yeah,
a joker poker.

528
00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:17.940
That's pretty good.
That's pretty good.
That's um,
so also kind of g-rated.
It's it,

529
00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:23.060
it's not as disgusting as a giggle.
Gash.
Like Josh Potter propels the good one.

530
00:35:23.061 --> 00:35:27.560
Google gosh is good.
That's not good.
It is good.
It's nasty.
Um,

531
00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:28.453
by the way,

532
00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:33.080
[inaudible] all a bottle of La Blah blah blah.

533
00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:37.680

Thank you for supporting it because the water champ thing is so big.

537
00:35:51.781 --> 00:35:56.280
People like it so much.

538
00:35:56.330 --> 00:36:00.540
So that we've been doing these socks for about a year.
Different logos.

539
00:36:00.541 --> 00:36:03.810
There's like bikes,

Dad Mouth Piss on me,

So those are in the store.

541

mommies,

547
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.860
you think you're a die hard mommy of the show.

548
00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:40.050
You think you love your mom's house.

549
00:36:40.051 --> 00:36:44.940
I met a couple this weekend and this is insane.
And Mama Soda,
I've never heard,

550
00:36:44.941 --> 00:36:47.970
I could not believe this is real.
I know in many apple tits.

551
00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:52.530
I'm Assan and Isabella [inaudible].
Is there a last name?

552
00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.030
There are a married couple.

553
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:59.150
And they had their legal middle names changed to be jeans.

554
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.250
And I'm not even kidding.
And I said,

555
00:37:02.251 --> 00:37:04.140
could you please send me a copy of your ID card?

556
00:37:04.141 --> 00:37:08.610
And I looked at it and I even asked to be verified that this is a real id card

557
00:37:08.611 --> 00:37:13.230
by the,
um,
whatever the security guy there isn't yet believe these two,

558
00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:17.610
diehard mommy's had their middle names legally changed to genes.

559
00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:21.750
Isn't that bananas?
Yeah,
we've got a,
we've got to get in touch with them.

560
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:25.320
I know they,
they email me,
so I have their email.
Okay.
Yeah,
I mean,

561
00:37:25.321 --> 00:37:29.970
I feel like we have to send them a swag bag.
Oh,
at the least.
If you,
uh,

562
00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:35.210
change your name legally to an inside joke from this podcast,

563
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:41.640
you're getting a shirt bra.
That's wild.

564
00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.900
Tell me what a hassle it is to change your name.
Yeah,

565
00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:47.950
and it takes a lot of social security office.
DMZ motion.

566
00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:52.650
Thank you very much.
Yes,
I'm Isabella and Exxon.
Exxon,

567
00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:57.320
Exxon,
Exxon.
Thank you.
So cute.
Yeah,
I couldn't believe that.

568
00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.360
That's a first.
I've never seen that one.
I knew mom's house.
Oh,

569
00:38:00.361 --> 00:38:02.070
you know who that lady was about to fight.

570
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:05.700
Do you have that other group fight that we were going to have you seen this

571
00:38:05.701 --> 00:38:09.930
fight?
This shit was crazy,
man.
This was like a,

572
00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:14.100
I think it's in a parking garage and there's all this where,
I don't know why.

573
00:38:14.101 --> 00:38:17.490
Fights always happened in parking.
Yeah.
Parking areas.

574
00:38:17.491 --> 00:38:22.260
I pretty sure this is a garage.
Well,
it's infuriating to park and drive.
Ay.

575
00:38:22.261 --> 00:38:26.730
Yay.
Yay.
Right.
It was the George Perez.
Oh,
you mean shotgun?

576
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:37.083
<v 5>God.</v>

577
00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:53.920
Oh my God.
What is that?

578
00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:00.860
<v 6>She's,
she's using it as a weapon guys.
She's using it as,</v>

579
00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:07.770
oh my,
how dare you put this in our file.

580
00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:12.270
Take this off.
You did it.
I didn't do it.
I guess it did you ask him to no idea.

581
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:17.640
I swear I do worst.
Turn it off.
Turn it off.

582
00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:23.100
<v 1>God Tom,
I really didn't do that.
I swear I didn't ask him.</v>

583
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:27.280
Ask Him.
He just asked him to pull up the footage.
You showed it to me.
Yeah.

584
00:39:27.281 --> 00:39:30.000
So you knew that there was barf.
I thought that there might be

585
00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:35.760
no,
I was the one that,
that prepped everything.
Christina,

586
00:39:35.761 --> 00:39:38.580
I'm not listening to you talk.
You're now a trader.
Blue Man.

587
00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:43.500
It's over baby.
It's not.
And I know you guys tricked me.

588
00:39:43.501 --> 00:39:44.640
There's to be another one.

589
00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:49.200
I'm going to put my ear buds and it's more barfs going to happen.
No,
it's not.
No,

590
00:39:49.201 --> 00:39:52.740
it's not.
It's fine.
You swear.
Yes.

591
00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:55.640
I promise I won't touch your painter for like a month if you like

592
00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.220
<v 6>promise.
Okay,</v>

593
00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:04.470
<v 0>go ahead.
Okay.
What's with the genes?
All right.
Um,</v>

594
00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:06.110
and by the way,
um,

595
00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:10.940
few weeks ago we introduced the idea of we have the sponsor manscape that has

596
00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:12.680
all this great stuff.
Yes.

597
00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:17.660
Ball trimmers and ball wipes and it has like bodywash all this stuff.
Anyways,

598
00:40:17.661 --> 00:40:21.090
they sent me a second kit.
They sent two of them.
No.

599
00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:25.040
So I discussed with you guys that we would have a little contest amongst the

600
00:40:25.041 --> 00:40:27.680
staff here about who gets the second one.

601
00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.380
But do you guys have an idea for how to do it?

602
00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:35.080
<v 1>I mean we've been thinking,
uh,
you know,
whoever has uh,</v>

603
00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:39.960
the longest strand of hair that needs manscaping was probably a good way to

604
00:40:39.961 --> 00:40:43.740
decide who needs it.
I like it.
That is the grossest thing I've ever heard.

605
00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:50.070
Are you not embarrassed to show like me or longest pure?
What was that like?

606
00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:52.680
Cause I know I'm going to lose.
No,
I'm not going to get it.

607
00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.590
<v 0>So are you going to do,
are we going to do photos of your pubic area</v>

608
00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:00.500
<v 1>photos,
photos of her pubic area?
I mean,
I thought we were just yet.</v>

609
00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:05.870
God a strand.
Oh,
Tom.

610
00:41:05.871 --> 00:41:09.680
As the judge has to take a measuring tape to it.
Oh.

611
00:41:09.681 --> 00:41:13.930
And then make sure I know it will be double placebo so you won't know whose is

612
00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:17.590
who.
Ah,
are you sure you want to do this?
Oh,

613
00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:20.390
it's really disgusting.
I think we'll know.
Whose is whose,

614
00:41:20.391 --> 00:41:24.050
I mean one of you is a red hair Jewish guy.
Do your,

615
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:27.620

It does.
Yeah.

616
00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:29.900
He's very curly.
Okay.

617
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:36.260
And then is there is a,
is everyone gonna participate?
Um,
I think it's good

618
00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:40.710
<v 7>here in this room.
It's going to be either me,
Chris or,
or potter.</v>

619
00:41:40.711 --> 00:41:44.760
And I mean my money's on pot.
I mean,
here's the thing.
When can we get our sea?

620
00:41:44.761 --> 00:41:46.970
Those pubes ban we're really trying to do,

621
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:50.550
we can do it in the break if you want and we can announce next week.
Wow.

622
00:41:50.551 --> 00:41:53.280
That'd be really great.
I can't wait to do it on the show though.

623
00:41:53.281 --> 00:41:55.710
Looking at the pubes and you deciding,
well,

624
00:41:55.711 --> 00:41:57.780
I mean right now that we'd have to like stop.

625
00:41:58.180 --> 00:41:59.890
You're going to pull your pubes at break.
Yeah.

626
00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:03.720
And then you're going to bring the pubes and like between this week and next

627
00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:04.560
week.
Next week,
yeah.
Yeah.

628
00:42:04.561 --> 00:42:07.490
We will have a pubes that Tom will have personally measured him.

629
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:12.950
<v 1>Ah,
you got to do it on the show.
You have to measure them on.
Oh yeah,
of course.</v>

630
00:42:12.951 --> 00:42:14.910
I mean the audience wants to be,
I want them.

631
00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:18.480
I went to pubes taped to a piece of

632
00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:22.700
<v 7>paper and a ruler.
Yeah.
It'll be put a number of tape over it.
Yeah.</v>

633
00:42:22.701 --> 00:42:26.350
It'll be like person a person B person c will have no idea who's a zoo.

634
00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.300
And you see how he didn't gender it?
Yeah,
I love that.
Well,

635
00:42:29.301 --> 00:42:30.500
there's three persons in there,
right?

636
00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:34.800
<v 1>You know,
nice persons.
Um,

637
00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:36.190
And you guys are so nasty.

638
00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:39.820
You're going to have to measure their dirty pubes Tommy,

639
00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:45.080
I have a long tongue.
Who's pubes are you most afraid of?
Why?
Wait,

640
00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:48.910
Josh is asking why you think they're all dirty.
Do Cause you guys are all nasty.

641
00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:53.320
You guys are all nasty.

644
00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:07.310

let's go buy hygiene.
I'm just going on hygiene.

645
00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:11.020
I'm not going to go on anything else other than like my perceived what?

646
00:43:11.021 --> 00:43:15.370
Hygiene level.
Right.
I'm going to go third place.

you guys are so disgusting.

649
00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.490
Josh just said that he shampoos his dick and it's very effective.

650
00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:29.940
Very offended that you think is the 30th I Bet Josh Watch that.

651
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:33.380
Well cause he gets,
he actually gets me sticking it in everywhere.
Yeah,

652
00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:36.280
but that doesn't mean anything sometimes.
Okay.
So number two,

653
00:43:36.281 --> 00:43:40.420
I'm going to go with the blue band.
Okay.
And then first place is Chris.

654
00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:43.990
He's the cleanest.
I think Chris is the cleaner.
He's real happy about that.

655
00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:48.210
I've caught whiffs of him and he smells nice.
Really?
I haven't smelled a youtube.

656
00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:49.570
I'm not smelled you too,
so I don't know.

657
00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:52.660
Well they're both smoke machines tell that's what it,
yeah.

658
00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:56.410
Josh schmucks way more than me though.
So he definitely smells worse.
Yeah,
no,

659
00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:01.540
I'll agree on that.
The cigarettes make you smell.
Yeah.
You said,

660
00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:06.280
what was my Dick?
Has he come yet?

661
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:10.960
That's Josh come yet Josh had become yet.
No,
he says,
no,
God,

662
00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:14.930
nothing has helped at all.
If you guys want an update,
should he be yeah.

663
00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:19.990
Do you guys sure.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.
Well,
because last time we spoke,

664
00:44:19.991 --> 00:44:24.910
Josh had mentioned like a trauma and that he remembered what?
Yeah.

665
00:44:24.911 --> 00:44:28.000
And I,
we need some more clarification,
Josh memory,

666
00:44:28.001 --> 00:44:32.190
you mentioned a trauma thing.
Yeah.
No,

667
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:35.190
<v 7>I,
uh,
had a revelation with doctor drew.</v>

668
00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:37.930
This just happened in that conversation with him.
Yeah.
He came up,

669
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:41.690
he made me realize something.
What's that?
Uh,

670
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.500
since I was born premature,

671
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:48.630
I was left in an incubator for a long time and apparently I have abandonment

672
00:44:48.631 --> 00:44:53.150
issues stemming from that.
From that,
yeah.
I don't remember it.

673
00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:58.080
But he said that's the worst kind of abandonment issues is,
is being a premature.

674
00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:02.360
No.
Is that,
I don't remember it or oh,
really?
Put me on this trajectory of,

675
00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:06.360
but can anyone remember?
And he also said that,
uh,
my,
uh,

676
00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:11.310
propensity to do opioids in my early days might've stunted,

677
00:45:11.311 --> 00:45:16.020
might come forever
not to spoil the episode.

678
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:18.800
Wait a minute though.
Can I ask you something?
Yeah.
What opioids,

679
00:45:18.801 --> 00:45:22.560
where were you into a percosets you were doing them a lot.
Yeah.

680
00:45:22.561 --> 00:45:25.440
When I had eye surgery I got pretty into those.
Yeah.

681
00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:29.130
And that can ruin the function.
Yeah.
Cause it just a,

682
00:45:29.131 --> 00:45:33.390
you don't have that satisfaction ever again.

683
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:37.710
Dulls everything.
And what about it has,
it has the real uplifting stuff.

684
00:45:37.711 --> 00:45:42.570
He told me,
made me hopeful.
What about the,
um,
you know,

685
00:45:42.571 --> 00:45:46.890
the goal,
the,
the theory that we were kind of,
oh,
he,
uh,

686
00:45:46.891 --> 00:45:48.990
he did prescribe me weird sex.

687
00:45:48.991 --> 00:45:53.750
He said I have to have as much and more weird sex.
Really?
Yeah.

688
00:45:53.751 --> 00:45:57.000
So that was the best thing I've ever heard from a doctor.
How,
what do you mean?

689
00:45:57.001 --> 00:45:59.520
He's like,
he's like,
that might be the key to this whole,
yeah.

690
00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:02.580
Like stop your standard missionary shit.
Yeah.
He's like,

691
00:46:02.581 --> 00:46:06.210
why waste time with that kind of like,
you know,
vaginal shit.
Right.

692
00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.600
Let's get into some,
no,
he didn't say the specifics.

693
00:46:09.601 --> 00:46:14.100
He just said try some weirder shit,
which I'm completely onboard with by the way.

694
00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:16.670
It's got to be plenty of hose out there that are on board with it too.
I mean,

695
00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:21.760
I would hope so.
Coming in.
They're still coming here and there.
You know,
I uh,

696
00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:26.140
I'm putting pins on the map for the make Josh come to her 2020 are we,

697
00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:28.920
are we going to sign?
We're going to set that thing up.
We got stu dude.

698
00:46:28.921 --> 00:46:32.000
I mean the mill road.
Shad.
He's D is getting,
yeah.

699
00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:35.040
Itchy over here and it was written right.
You,
the Melrose show was great.

700
00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.620
It was fun.
Thank you for coming.
By the way,
if you came to that,

701
00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:42.870
that was a lot of fun.
Yeah.
We need just to make jobs come to her.
Has the,
the,

702
00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:47.490
the theory that the smoke show,
which is the key to it all,

703
00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:51.850
I think.
Are we leaning into that?
Yeah,
of course.
I mean it couldn't hurt.
Yeah.

704
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:55.140
You know,
it's not like roll is the remedy.
I mean,
you know what I'm saying?

705
00:46:55.141 --> 00:46:59.970
Like Dr drew definitely didn't say that shit.
Let me ask you a question,
Josh.

706
00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:04.740
When a doctor gives you medicine,
what does he do?

707
00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:08.580
He blank medicine.
He prescribes,

708
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:12.670
prescribes,
prescribes.
Is that wrong?
What prescribes what?

709
00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:16.860
He said Perce crabs.
You.
He,
he what?
Say it again.

710
00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:22.690
Oh.
Perscribed is this one wrong too?
Yeah,
it's wrong.
What is it?

711
00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:23.820
It was prescribed.

712
00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:30.160
Prescribed.
Prescribed.
Yeah.

713
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:34.630
<v 1>Prescribed.
Yes.
He doesn't turn scribe?
No.
It not prescribed.
Prescribed.</v>

714
00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:38.270
No,
no,
no.

715
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:48.430
Is that wrong?
Well,
let's element Interi it's not prescribed.

716
00:47:48.431 --> 00:47:49.450
It's elementary school.

717
00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:57.650
That's not that.
Yeah.
It's pretty prescribed.

718
00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:02.360
Prescribed even when it sucks.
Yeah.
Okay.

719
00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:08.590
Um,
okay,
so now you have to just bang a bunch of slides.
Yeah.
Try some stuff out.

720
00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:13.180
Try.
Yeah.
So,
uh,
I'm down for more reps,
more experimentation.

721
00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:17.770
I'm up for it all.
Okay.
So 2020,

722
00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:23.260
I'm coming to your town and hopefully I'm coming in your town.
Elementary.

723
00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:28.660
It is elementary.
Um,
all right,
let's set up this episode.

724
00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:31.100
<v 0>So this was pretty awesome.
Yeah,</v>

725
00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:36.990
this is Rhett and link.
There's so sweet.
If you guys don't know,

726
00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:42.110
these guys have a youtube channel that they have multiple youtube channels.

727
00:48:43.411 --> 00:48:47.070
Actually.
They like downplayed how many youtube channels.
They were like,
Hey,

728
00:48:47.071 --> 00:48:52.071
we've got a couple and a one of them has 15 million subscribers and other one is

729
00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:57.420
like,
oh,
just like five and a few more.
These are like,

730
00:48:57.450 --> 00:49:01.440
Oh gee,
youtube guys who could not be nicer.
Um,
we've,

731
00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.000
I've found out in the,

732
00:49:03.001 --> 00:49:07.080
during this interview that even some of the content that they created,

733
00:49:07.081 --> 00:49:12.081
we actually played on this show as funny content maybe 10 years ago,

734
00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:17.560
very early days cause of like how funny the,
the stuff was there.
Anyway,

735
00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:19.410
they're super funny.
They're super talented,

736
00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:23.880
they're super successful and they are very open and accessible.

737
00:49:23.881 --> 00:49:24.870
And I think it's a fascinating,

738
00:49:24.871 --> 00:49:29.871
like I'm always fascinated by successful people and what they do.

739
00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:35.060
And I love the business of it all and learning and these guys were so open to,

740
00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:36.930
you know,
telling the story of it.

741
00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:40.560
I just thought it was a fascinating talk with you're a great interview.

742
00:49:40.561 --> 00:49:45.150
And I also liked that we kinda got to see a little hidden dynamic between Oh

743
00:49:45.151 --> 00:49:48.360
yeah.
And link.
So if you pay attention guys,
uh,

744
00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:51.540
we got to see a little marital spat and fine.

745
00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:54.820
Let's just say that one of them is a little more ride or die than the other.

746
00:49:56.670 --> 00:50:00.440
Enjoy retinally your mom's house.
We'll be right back.

747
00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:03.090
If you love hardcore porn,
our next guest don't need any of that.

748
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:06.740
<v 1>Uh,
uh,</v>

749
00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:10.710
<v 0>no.
The um,
the founders of Youtube,
Rhett link linker here.</v>

750
00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:15.750
<v 1>Okay.
Yeah.
Swing.
I know where to go with it.
I like how you guys have built,</v>

751
00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:16.830
I'm okay.

752
00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:17.581
<v 0>Like endlessly.</v>

753
00:50:17.581 --> 00:50:21.960
I think we all are endlessly fascinated by non traditional,

754
00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:26.790
um,
like explosive careers in entertainment that aren't like,

755
00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:28.070
I'm on a TV show,

756
00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:28.490
<v 7>right?</v>

757
00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:33.230
I'm in a movie and you guys have built this unbelievable youtube following.

758
00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:37.370
He's still an empire and it's like,
it's,
I mean it's fascinating.

759
00:50:37.371 --> 00:50:41.150
I just want to know,
I mean first of all,
you guys are North Carolinians,
right?

760
00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:45.590
And you know,
born and raised,
I went to school in North Carolina,
Hickory,
Hickory,

761
00:50:45.591 --> 00:50:49.430
North Carolina,
North Carolina is North Carolina gets,
I mean it really is.

762
00:50:49.431 --> 00:50:51.380
Do you want furniture?
Cause we,
we're the furniture capital.

763
00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:54.320
I love some good furniture.
The big chair is,

764
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:56.360
I don't know if know the picture is not there,

765
00:50:56.361 --> 00:50:58.970
but they used to swing that furniture capital thing around.

766
00:50:58.971 --> 00:51:01.670
Like they would not let you forget it when you were there.
You're like,

767
00:51:01.671 --> 00:51:05.900
this place sucks.
And they're like the furniture capital.
You'll get that.

768
00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:09.570
So have you gotten over furniture since you've left or not me.
I'm addicted

769
00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:15.770
around it but would love it.
I love it man.

770
00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:20.850
Is that Hickory?
This is not hickory.
North Carolina.

771
00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:25.550
A little town called buoys creek.
What is a little town people?

772
00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:30.230
Oh my God.
Thousand people.
When school's not in session.
Campbell University,

773
00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:34.490
another small school.
Where's buoys creek?
Uh,
in between Raleigh and fable.

774
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:39.930
Okay,
good.
My uh,
one of my good friends is from a Randleman and Randall Randall.

775
00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:44.210
Randall County.
That's towards the mountains too,
right?
Right.

776
00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:48.530
Well random means a out near out towards Raleigh.
It's where,
uh,
what's his name?

777
00:51:48.531 --> 00:51:52.250
The king is from,
uh,
what's the,
uh,
uh,
petty,
petty,

778
00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:56.920
petty.
He's your mind when North Carolina was that Casey said

779
00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:02.120
you guys are from the same place.
Right?
Cause when you grow up together,

780
00:52:02.121 --> 00:52:04.320
since first grade you've been best friends.
Yeah,

781
00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:09.170
I was born and raised there and rep moved there for first grade.
Wow.
That's,

782
00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:14.150
that's when this started.
And this is where this is,
this is a circle.

783
00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:16.430
It's clearly on a decline that you're here,
but I'm saying,

784
00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:22.590
but like you guys,
so you guys were just buds like in school and yeah.

785
00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:27.000
Yeah.
Like you know,
doing the whole biking around town.
Hey listen,

786
00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:30.620
we lived on opposite sides of town,
which wasn't that far.
So it was like,

787
00:52:30.621 --> 00:52:30.891
all right,

788
00:52:30.891 --> 00:52:35.330
we would meet at the cemetery in the middle of our bike routes and then we would

789
00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:39.200
pick a way to go depending on after desecrating some grapes.

790
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:41.960
You guys have to know some scandalous shit about each other.

791
00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:47.140
Yeah,

792
00:52:47.141 --> 00:52:50.420
they definitely do.
I see.
I knew you were going to rip us apart.

793
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:56.780
You know where he buried the bodies,
right?
Yeah,
no.
Yeah,
for sure.
No,

794
00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.480
we didn't actually desecrate anybody's,

795
00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:02.720
you don't have to desecrate it to bury it.
That's true.

796
00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:04.580
I just want to clarify that.
That's true.
Well,

797
00:53:04.581 --> 00:53:07.930
we men knows what to do with a dead body.
Jump over a,

798
00:53:07.931 --> 00:53:12.931
a a dead cow that had died in the midst of childbirth.

799
00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:16.460
Oh,
sort of bring it down.

800
00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:21.320
We would frequent a cow pasture.
Yeah.
And just,

801
00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.140
I don't know who's who were the farmer was or anything,

802
00:53:24.141 --> 00:53:28.020
but we would go there and we would chase the cows like on foot.

803
00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:33.680
It's a very exhilarating feeling to have cows scatter out in front of you.

804
00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:37.970
I don't know if you know if you've said he's doing no,

805
00:53:37.971 --> 00:53:41.790
I've never even melt a cow.
I mean I grew up in San Fernando Valley.

806
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:47.670
You should definitely do it regularly.
It's about it really for real.

807
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:52.560
It feels right
when you're doing it,
you're like,

808
00:53:52.561 --> 00:53:56.940
this is definitely what I should be doing.
It's warm,
it's warm.

809
00:53:56.941 --> 00:54:01.941
It's not pasteurized and homogenized tastes like milk is different.

810
00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:07.670
The score,
it is so small.
It's just,
it.

811
00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:12.420
You can't really get more than a mouthful.
Does it feel wholesome or Kinky?

812
00:54:12.421 --> 00:54:15.360
Cause it kind of,
I don't know,
a little both.
It feels like we're wholesome meats.

813
00:54:15.361 --> 00:54:19.560
Kinky.
Yeah.
Lips on the outer.
That's the,

814
00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:22.500
well I didn't put my lips on it.

815
00:54:23.110 --> 00:54:27.210
It was more of a video for your lips up to it and you're like,
yeah,

816
00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:31.460
I mean as far as video,
you know,
it wasn't like,
oh,
it was for a video.

817
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:37.370
Like,
so I go to sleep,
man,
I didn't go out to the barn.
If you want to clarify.

818
00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:41.190
Yeah.
When we were chasing cut Cal's,
we weren't doing it in order to then mill.

819
00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:46.200
That was,
he did a different catch as adults.

820
00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:50.900
You guys been friends for forever,
like your entire life basically.

821
00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:55.130
You ever had the kind of fights where you don't talk for like months it can go?

822
00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:58.910
No,
you've never done it.
We fight mean we fight all the time.
Do you?
Oh yeah.

823
00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:02.670
What do you guys fight if you fight about like content or just we definitely,

824
00:55:02.671 --> 00:55:07.100
yeah,
we have,
we have like the way we approach things creatively,
um,

825
00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:11.220
is kind of our strength and weakness in our relationship.
So,

826
00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:15.360
uh,
in that I kind of try to move things forward.

827
00:55:15.361 --> 00:55:17.820
He tries to finish them and so that's kind of,

828
00:55:17.821 --> 00:55:22.290
we've kind of constantly battling with that.
But,

829
00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:23.400
and then we just,

830
00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:27.240
I mean it's more like an old married couple or brothers in that,

831
00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:33.590
just all the things that a normal person might find endearing about link.

832
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.570
I find it annoying if vice versa.

833
00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:43.380
Emphasize the vice versa.
Like get lost.

834
00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:48.540
I mean we also fight about,
I mean I'm the one,
I get my feelings get hurt,

835
00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:52.530
so I'm the feelings get hurt guy.
Well maybe my feelings get hurt and I just,

836
00:55:52.531 --> 00:55:55.860
you know,
I don't show it well the eye.
Oh,
interesting.

837
00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.750
But I would just say that's a gracious way of May.

838
00:55:57.751 --> 00:55:59.460
I don't wear my emotions on my sleeve.

839
00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:03.690
You're the asshole who hurts my feelings guy.
Okay,
here's how I'm really,

840
00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:09.560
is what I'm really trying to totally starting to figure out that when he's hurt,

841
00:56:09.811 --> 00:56:14.370
even though he doesn't have to say it.
No.
You know,

842
00:56:14.371 --> 00:56:17.760
when he's hurt,
I think it's that big of a problem.
Yeah.

843
00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:22.770
For a problem to express emotion and yeah.
Therapy.

844
00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:26.800
Yeah.
So are we aggressive?
Go ahead.
Yeah,
I love it.
Yeah.
Because it,

845
00:56:26.810 --> 00:56:31.210
cause I think that being able to,
you first you have to be able to do fee.

846
00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.100
Like my therapist asked me things like,

847
00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:38.470
so what do you feel?
And I'm like,
hmm.
Feel.

848
00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:42.160
Yeah.
What is that?
Then what do I feel?
And then he's like,
but where,

849
00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:46.070
where do you feel it?
And I'm like,
this is getting weird.
Yeah.

850
00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:50.000
I feel it right here.
Yeah.
You know?
And so,
yeah.

851
00:56:50.001 --> 00:56:52.720
So I could see how it would be difficult if you were interacting with me to know

852
00:56:52.721 --> 00:56:55.450
that I was having an issue.
Sure.
Without me saying it.

853
00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:59.140
But isn't that a big deal that you're actually kind of addressing it and talking

854
00:56:59.141 --> 00:57:01.130
about,
well,
according to my wife,
it's a really big picture.

855
00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:05.530
She's super stoked about that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No,
it's good.
It's good.

856
00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:10.540
And I do think it's,
I mean we've talked about,
well you guys understand this.

857
00:57:10.541 --> 00:57:14.890
We,
we've talked about anytime we start thinking about it was something we were

858
00:57:14.891 --> 00:57:18.370
going to do,
a compensation we're going to have even recently talking about,

859
00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:23.400
let's do something where we see a,
um,
like a,
uh,

860
00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:27.580
a couple's therapist.
But for our friendship,
not that there's,
it's falling apart,

861
00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:31.730
but that because we actually said wouldn't this be a great podcast?
Yeah.

862
00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:35.470
Cause you had this tendency to want to monetize every yeah.
Every conversation.

863
00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:40.090
Sure,
sure.
Yeah.
Again,
that was,
that was my idea.
Well that's what I said.

864
00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:43.090
Then you were like,
ah,
no,
I'm not trying to take credit for the idea.

865
00:57:43.091 --> 00:57:46.180
I'm just saying that we ended up deciding it wasn't a good idea.

866
00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:48.290
Well I don't know what it actually is.
I've come out,

867
00:57:48.291 --> 00:57:52.370
it could be a good idea at some point,
but you know,
once,
you know,

868
00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:55.270
I have to kind of have to learn what body part is feeling.
What before?

869
00:57:55.530 --> 00:57:58.830
<v 8>How'd that kind of,
I don't know.</v>

870
00:57:59.810 --> 00:58:02.380
<v 7>I don't know if I would know how to answer that.
Like what,</v>

871
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:07.310
what body parts you need to be in therapy.
Do you have a therapy?

872
00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:10.970
Would you go?
Oh yeah,
it definitely independently.
Yeah.

873
00:58:10.971 --> 00:58:15.330
I don't want to go to the same therapist.
No.
Yeah,
no.
Yeah,
of course.

874
00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:17.840
So I'm not going to do that cause I've already turned him against you.

875
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:22.770
<v 8>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
exactly.</v>

876
00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:24.540
I've got to have somebody on my side,

877
00:58:24.790 --> 00:58:26.380
<v 7>we're going to eat,
we're going to have like,</v>

878
00:58:26.381 --> 00:58:29.620
can you have a therapy battle where you're like,
you bring your three

879
00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:32.650
<v 8>therapist shut.
You guys have to get out there.</v>

880
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:35.470
That's a video I would click a few times.
While

881
00:58:37.090 --> 00:58:40.860
you have your thick written right.
Therapists are like your guys a deck.

882
00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:45.870
That was a good idea.
Yeah,
this is good.
I would watch that.
I want,

883
00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:49.880
I want in on this action,
right?
Yeah.
So anyway,
the cow,
I was pregnant

884
00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:51.650
<v 7>and so,
um,</v>

885
00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:55.850
it was bloated and then the calf had made it halfway out.

886
00:58:57.130 --> 00:59:00.540
I didn't want to not go back to them.
I don't want to hear it.
Oh No.
Terrible.

887
00:59:00.541 --> 00:59:04.520
We went up to it and we just like stood there and looked at it.

888
00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:09.910
He was like,
it's one of the most memorable moments of our childhood.
Yeah.

889
00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:10.620
Oh is that right?

890
00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:15.530
Cause we just like stood there and then there we go.

891
00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:19.160
I'm sorry.
We were like,
we got the feeling I'm a mouth.

892
00:59:19.161 --> 00:59:20.270
When you encounter something like that,

893
00:59:20.271 --> 00:59:24.770
you feel that need to say meaningful things.
Yeah.
So I don't remember.

894
00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:25.820
I don't remember what we said,

895
00:59:25.821 --> 00:59:29.180
but we said some things that were meaningful to 12 year olds or however all we

896
00:59:29.181 --> 00:59:29.710
were.

897
00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:31.900
<v 9>And then one of us said,</v>

898
00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:37.740
<v 7>you think we can jump over it?
Such a boy,
little boy.
We started jumping over.</v>

899
00:59:37.741 --> 00:59:39.020
It gets awesome.
Yeah.

900
00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:44.070
<v 9>Risk.
You know,
if you,
if you can't,
it's,
that's a big mess.
Yeah.</v>

901
00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:49.240
It looked like it was explosive.
It was,
it was ready to go at any moment.

902
00:59:49.241 --> 00:59:53.290
Do you folks still go back to Carolina?
All the families.
They're everywhere.

903
00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:57.790
Everywhere.
Maybe once.
It's almost,
it's just once a year now though.

904
00:59:57.791 --> 01:00:00.840
Like sometimes twice.
Usually just once.

905
01:00:00.841 --> 01:00:05.650
It's kind of blow like a holiday thing at this point.
It is.
Yeah.
And um,

906
01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:07.270
so when you guys,
did you guys,

907
01:00:07.271 --> 01:00:12.150
you went to high school together too in college and college roommates?
What?

908
01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:17.440
Yeah,
Wolf Pack.
Yeah.
Awesome.
I've never lived alone because,

909
01:00:17.890 --> 01:00:18.970
um,
you know,

910
01:00:18.971 --> 01:00:22.960
I moved out of the house into the college dorm with him and then,

911
01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:26.770
uh,
got engaged and married right out of college.

912
01:00:26.771 --> 01:00:31.150
So I moved out of our apartment into holy shit,
like a house with my wife.

913
01:00:31.151 --> 01:00:35.050
So it's like I never had,
I've never experienced that living by myself.

914
01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:38.820
<v 7>It's great.
I mean,
I didn't either,</v>

915
01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:42.720
weren't only child though.
Oh,
you mean my mom.

916
01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:49.440
She was gone a lot though.
Your mom latchkey kid.
A little bit.

917
01:00:49.450 --> 01:00:50.880
Yeah.
Only child.

918
01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:54.320
<v 9>Physically a latch.
What is a,
what is</v>

919
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:59.610
<v 7>it means you have a key to your own home and then at your school you just let</v>

920
01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:04.320
yourself,
and my mom came in like a cellar
latch.

921
01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:08.950
Latchkey kids are often like that are there prisoners can go.

922
01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:15.000
I could go ahead and come as I pleased.
Yeah.
That's Kinda cool.
Yeah,
it was.

923
01:01:15.090 --> 01:01:18.450
It was.
All right.
Tell me about,
so when you guys graduate,

924
01:01:18.570 --> 01:01:21.900
do you have the aspirations,
the goals of,

925
01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:25.140
of what you do now or not at all?
There was no point of reference for it.

926
01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.480
So rewinding a little bit,
in high school

927
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:32.820
<v 9>we,
we both had this idea that we wanted to go to film school,
Right.
And so</v>

928
01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:36.380
<v 7>we kind of just did things in it.
We weren't going to,</v>

929
01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:39.620
we were going to make a decision together.
There's a great one in Carolina,

930
01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.280
Carolina School of the arts.
But like we didn't have,

931
01:01:43.310 --> 01:01:45.850
we didn't even know about that.
Like we just didn't,
you know,

932
01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:46.790
is this a different time?

933
01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:48.860
<v 9>Well,
we were those guys with the video camera,</v>

934
01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:52.320
like doing the school pride shirt and like stuff,

935
01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:57.060
<v 7>it's kind of like,
when is the Internet?
Sorry,
this was,</v>

936
01:01:57.061 --> 01:01:59.910
we graduated from high school in [inaudible] 96 so this would have,
you know,

937
01:01:59.911 --> 01:02:04.820
early nineties,
97 cents a young guy ever.

938
01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.040
Anyways.
And so I told my dad,
I was like,

939
01:02:08.041 --> 01:02:10.500
we're thinking about going to film school.
And he was like,
well,

940
01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:15.570
I'm not going to pay for that Jay,
because he had no point of reference either.

941
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:20.070
He's all,
our parents were like super supportive this point.
And

942
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:23.490
<v 10>my dad would have been a stand up if he wasn't a law professor.
I mean,</v>

943
01:02:23.491 --> 01:02:28.410
he's hit his audience at this point,
but he,

944
01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:32.130
uh,
he was,
he just expected just to do something normal.

945
01:02:32.131 --> 01:02:36.150
So we both were good at math and so,
and some friends were going to NC state.

946
01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:38.910
You could go to NC state,
you do engineering if you're good at math.

947
01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:43.100
So we both got engineering.
What,
what?

948
01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.560
And then get that because that's so you left when you graduated,

949
01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:50.880
you went got engineering jobs.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

950
01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:54.240
And uh,
I was,
I was a civil engineer.

951
01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:59.690
I designed like a drainage systems for power plants.

952
01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:06.150
<v 8>I have a degree in philosophy.
What'd you say?</v>

953
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:11.320
I feel better about your success knowing how smart,
yeah,

954
01:03:12.010 --> 01:03:15.210
it's crazy.
I'll be talking about,
it makes me feel worse.

955
01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:20.390
Like if four years of calculus,
but you know what I need to make?

956
01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:24.180
How many have engineers,
engineers out there want a murder you,

957
01:03:25.850 --> 01:03:26.670
they're like,

958
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:30.840
I studied all this shit and here I am fucking figuring out Janet sisterly doing

959
01:03:30.841 --> 01:03:35.130
it.
These two dicks make video.
They're so upset.

960
01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:40.680
I don't even know what calculus is.

961
01:03:43.850 --> 01:03:47.940
Not Serious.
I'm not kidding.
I got to,
I moved my freshman year of high school,

962
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:50.640
we moved down to Florida,
Vero beach,
and I went to,

963
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:55.860
they threw me into whatever it was,
Algebra one failed like f,
f,
F,

964
01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:58.350
this is,
you're the worst student.

965
01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:02.520
Then they next year I took geometry and I actually got a B and I was like,

966
01:04:02.521 --> 01:04:06.600
maybe I'm good at math.
Yeah.
And then junior year they're like,

967
01:04:06.601 --> 01:04:09.570
well you failed Algebra one,
you got to take it again.

968
01:04:09.690 --> 01:04:13.830
I took Algebra one twice as well and I was failing straight up and we're in the

969
01:04:13.831 --> 01:04:16.950
math teacher was also an assistant football coach and was like,

970
01:04:16.951 --> 01:04:20.540
I'll give you a D,
I'll hook you up with a d.

971
01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:25.850
And then a freshman year in college,
they had like a Rameet,
like the other gift,

972
01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:29.100
you take one math class for this track.
I failed it.

973
01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:32.820
And then senior year of college,
they're like,

974
01:04:32.821 --> 01:04:37.470
the only way you can graduate college from Lenore Ryan is to take that remedial

975
01:04:37.471 --> 01:04:40.470
math class again.
So I was a senior with all freshmen.
Oh Wow.

976
01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:44.130
And the guy was like,
you're so bad.
You're the worst student I've ever had.

977
01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:49.260
And I saw he had a magazine about boats on his desk.
I was like,

978
01:04:49.261 --> 01:04:52.110
I'm going boats.
And he was like,
Oh really?
And I started talking about,

979
01:04:52.590 --> 01:04:55.830
I made a boat connection.
I started reading about boats,
talking about bows.

980
01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:57.083
He gave me a c

981
01:04:58.790 --> 01:05:01.350
but I would stay after class and be like,

982
01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:05.940
you see that new a 20 foot super that came out,
like just talk to him about.

983
01:05:05.941 --> 01:05:08.880
But he was like,
yeah.
Was pretty cool.
Just connected on that.
And that's,

984
01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:15.300
you're not talking about like sail boats area,
just motor.
But yeah,

985
01:05:15.301 --> 01:05:16.134
you can not like,

986
01:05:16.890 --> 01:05:21.700
what do they call the inboard and like motorboats but that's a good life skill.

987
01:05:21.701 --> 01:05:23.920
Like that's the kind of stuff I want to teach our children.

988
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:26.530
Be Dumb but not at a talk.
That's what's sad.
Yeah.

989
01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:28.870
Because that's all that's better in life.
Right.

990
01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:31.720
That's shit that you're going to fill skill.
Yeah.
That,

991
01:05:31.721 --> 01:05:33.430
and I encourage little bit of lying.

992
01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:36.160
You should lie in your teen years as well to your parents.

993
01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:39.050
I'm going to a movie when you're really making out with your boyfriend,
right?

994
01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:43.390
That kind of,
you gotta lie to your boss.
Yes.
A little things.
Not Big things.

995
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:47.920
It's not to the IRS and stuff like that,
but a little,
you know.
Yeah,

996
01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:49.960
sure.
No,
it's true.

997
01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:54.340
There's a lot of loopholes and what you did kind of manipulated to your teacher.

998
01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:57.870
No,
I totally,
yeah,
cause also because I had no out cause I was like,
I've,

999
01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:01.240
I don't do this.
Look good.
I'm going to not graduate.
And now you do.

1000
01:06:01.241 --> 01:06:04.570
You know about boats.
That's true.
Well true.
A very important skill.

1001
01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:05.200
More than that.

1002
01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:09.510
You were like hanging out on the weekends on that dude on the phone and we're

1003
01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:14.440
like going kneeboarding or that's right.
No know.
Oh that dude he was,

1004
01:06:14.441 --> 01:06:16.540
he was Kinda of weird.
He was,

1005
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:18.690
did you guys sleep in the same bed as you show your bed?

1006
01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:21.500
I had all kinds of teachers that just liked me.
Yeah.

1007
01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:26.290
Like they genuinely liked me and only in the subjects that I was horrible in

1008
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:30.730
chemistry,
the guy,
I was like,
God,
do you really not get this?

1009
01:06:33.890 --> 01:06:36.630
But you're nice and yeah,
that's what he was just like into it.
Yeah.

1010
01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:39.810
You are attractive.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He was like,
you are pretty cute though.
Yeah.

1011
01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:44.470
How about a mouth?
Can I kissed him
before I forget.

1012
01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:45.810
You guys and I,
we're

1013
01:06:45.810 --> 01:06:49.950
<v 7>both a date were a day apart.
We're doing the Nashville comedy festival.
Yeah,</v>

1014
01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.350
that's right.
You guys are April 9th.
I'm April 10th.

1015
01:06:52.351 --> 01:06:57.120
We're both at the Ryman and there are no tickets available.
Oh,
you fucked up.

1016
01:06:57.510 --> 01:07:00.420
Have you done anything in the Ryman?
We've have not.
I've never,

1017
01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.950
I've never done it.
I heard it's a beautiful space and uh,
people,

1018
01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:05.590
a lot of friends who have done,
uh,

1019
01:07:05.610 --> 01:07:09.570
played there and they said it's like an awesome,
awesome venue.

1020
01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:14.010
And what do you guys do in your live show,
by the way?
It's a comedy music.
Oh,

1021
01:07:14.011 --> 01:07:17.340
okay.
Two stools,
a guitar,
lots of songs.
I mean,

1022
01:07:17.341 --> 01:07:21.750
that's the first thing we did on youtube where we put the funny songs that we've

1023
01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.180
written over the previous years.
When you're doing this,

1024
01:07:24.181 --> 01:07:28.530
like putting those on youtube,
you're,
that it existed,
but your engine,

1025
01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:30.900
you're working as engineers during the day.
Yeah,

1026
01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:35.490
we would get together like once a week,
um,
one night,

1027
01:07:35.491 --> 01:07:40.170
a week and light right together.
And then we were,
we were in college,
we would,

1028
01:07:40.171 --> 01:07:43.950
you know,
yeah,
we did the video thing,
but then we also did the,
hey,

1029
01:07:43.951 --> 01:07:46.650
we wrote a funny song,
guys,
let it sit on the couch.

1030
01:07:46.651 --> 01:07:49.530
We're going to play a four year kind of thing.
So it's like,
it's a hobby.

1031
01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:51.760
It's like,
oh,
this is fun.
Right?
Yeah.
And then,

1032
01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:56.840
and so we started doing some like a small college stuff and like performing.

1033
01:07:57.710 --> 01:08:02.010
Yeah.
Okay.
And so then we created our website.

1034
01:08:02.490 --> 01:08:07.320
This is like oh three so we were like,
oh,
we need to create,

1035
01:08:07.321 --> 01:08:11.840
create a website so that we may choose like,
oh five right?
Am I wrong?
Yeah.

1036
01:08:11.841 --> 01:08:15.070
And we got to know six is like very few people got into a fight.

1037
01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.100
That's when it like started

1038
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:19.360
<v 10>like in the summer oh five.
But we were,
we like,</v>

1039
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:21.260
we're putting these music videos on our website.

1040
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:25.700
So people who saw us live could see the videos.

1041
01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:27.380
But then people started taking like,

1042
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:29.840
so we did that for a couple of years and not really going anywhere.

1043
01:08:30.290 --> 01:08:33.080
And then people started taking those videos and download from the website

1044
01:08:33.081 --> 01:08:35.300
because it was back in the day,
he had to like host your own video,

1045
01:08:35.301 --> 01:08:39.200
like using server.
People had quick time pro,

1046
01:08:39.201 --> 01:08:42.560
they could just right click on the video,
upload it to them,

1047
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:45.530
and they were taking it,
downloading it,
and then uploading it to youtube.

1048
01:08:45.531 --> 01:08:48.890
And we were at,
is that helping in a way because it's sharing it,
right?
Yeah.

1049
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:53.950
Because hundreds of people had seen our videos on our website and then somebody

1050
01:08:54.681 --> 01:08:57.950
uploaded a,
we did this.
Our,
our kids were really young.

1051
01:08:58.310 --> 01:09:00.960
Like my son was a couple months old probably.
And,
and,

1052
01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:04.820
and his daughter was like a year we did a parody of MPVs pimp,

1053
01:09:04.821 --> 01:09:08.570
my ride penalize stroller basically completely tricked out this stroller.

1054
01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:13.130
And somebody took that and upload it to youtube and it got like a thousand views

1055
01:09:13.131 --> 01:09:17.840
in a week or something.
And you guys were like,
Whoa,
whoa,
this is crazy.

1056
01:09:17.841 --> 01:09:22.120
That's way bigger than any plates we've ever relayed.
Um,

1057
01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:25.820
and so we started doing it intentionally,
you know,
six and then in oh seven,

1058
01:09:26.270 --> 01:09:29.240
we started it as a business.
Wow.

1059
01:09:29.570 --> 01:09:34.340
Is that when you realize,
is that when you stop working engineering jobs?
Yeah.

1060
01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:38.180
So,
oh seven you're ready to,
to like make the leap?
Yeah,
we,
yeah.

1061
01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:43.700
I can't remember the first with the first paying Gig was,

1062
01:09:43.701 --> 01:09:46.430
but we essentially started making,
we were,

1063
01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:48.990
this is before you can make money off of Youtube,
but the ads,

1064
01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.630
because when it started there were no ads

1065
01:09:52.330 --> 01:09:53.720
and before Google bought it and everything.

1066
01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:56.510
So what we would do is we would make phone calls,

1067
01:09:56.511 --> 01:10:00.810
but we wrote a song about the game corn hole in the Midwest,
you know?
No,

1068
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:05.510
of course.
So we wrote like this sort of country song about corn hole and uh,

1069
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:10.820
we were like surely some corn hole company out there with spots or this thing.

1070
01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.200
So we,
like we would call,

1071
01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:16.070
we would go on a website that sold corn hole equipment and like call the number.

1072
01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:19.940
And like one was like this mom who was like running the business out of her

1073
01:10:19.941 --> 01:10:24.160
garage.
And she was like,
I just don't have any money.
And then we liked,

1074
01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:27.410
but then we were like,
really?
You still Cornell equipment on the Internet?

1075
01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:29.270
But we found these other guys,

1076
01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:32.660
these other guys who are like three guys about our age who are starting this new

1077
01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:35.810
business and like Ohio and they were really excited about it.

1078
01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:39.890
They love the idea of like doing some kind of like viral marketing.

1079
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:44.180
And so like we,
with the help of my dad,
I like wrote up this contract.

1080
01:10:44.181 --> 01:10:47.540
We had no idea.
Like we were like,
maybe we should just say we get paid.

1081
01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:52.580
I think what we said was we're like,
we want $2,000 to make the video.

1082
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:58.390
And then if you could give us $20 for every thousand views after that.

1083
01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:01.430
Yeah.
For two years.

1084
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:07.190
And the thing and were getting like two or 3 million views,
we hadn't,
you know,

1085
01:11:07.191 --> 01:11:08.930
we had no idea what we were sued them right.

1086
01:11:11.250 --> 01:11:14.220
As Troy their lives.
Like,
you've signed that fucking shit.

1087
01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:19.110
<v 7>I mean,
they paid us,
they paid us.
They did.</v>

1088
01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:23.850
Wow.
I'm assuming it,
it also benefited them in a great,
oh yeah.

1089
01:11:23.851 --> 01:11:27.750
They were like,
they made corn hole.
We ended up doing it.
[inaudible] JJ cornhole.

1090
01:11:27.751 --> 01:11:30.550
They're still paying.
If we did a,
which camera do I look at?

1091
01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:36.480
That website?
Ignorant.
I dunno what corn haul.
I mean,

1092
01:11:36.481 --> 01:11:38.650
I know what corn hole and right

1093
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:42.000
<v 10>you,
but you've seen the game with the big,</v>

1094
01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:45.360
it's like a Tilton board and you throw the beanbag.

1095
01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:50.130
<v 7>Oh yeah.
Haha.
Another name for it.
Okay.
All right.
I think it was a real,
oh,</v>

1096
01:11:50.131 --> 01:11:54.940
ogs.
I think beanbag tosses botox.
It's not a,
it's got corn in the bag.
Yeah,

1097
01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:59.610
and that gives it that,
that righteous,
right.
It's the board.

1098
01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:04.230
It makes you want to take another swig of your beer because it isn't what we

1099
01:12:04.231 --> 01:12:07.860
believed at the time to be the next Olympic sport and the only one where you

1100
01:12:07.861 --> 01:12:11.880
could drink beer because we didn't know about the Shimmy Shimmy game.

1101
01:12:11.881 --> 01:12:16.430
What's that?
Oh yeah.
Full board shuffleboard.
No,
the Olympic,
no,
the curling.

1102
01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:20.490
Curling.
Yeah.
I think you can drink a beer while doing that too.
Oh,
for sure.

1103
01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:25.590
When you make that corn whole video and it starts to take off or you like a
word,

1104
01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:29.090
this is it that we did the right,
like this is what we should be doing.
Yeah,
yeah,

1105
01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:33.480
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I mean like we started doing,
we started doing that with other,

1106
01:12:33.481 --> 01:12:37.110
other products we would just call and you just randomly just cold call people.

1107
01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.600
Yeah.
And now you have some reference and be like,
check these out.

1108
01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:44.620
<v 10>Right,
right.
Yeah.
Uh,
and then in Oh eight,
uh,</v>

1109
01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:49.710
this advertising advertising agency called and they wanted to his Alka Seltzer,

1110
01:12:49.711 --> 01:12:52.320
they represented Alka Seltzer and they wanted us to do like a bunch of food

1111
01:12:52.321 --> 01:12:53.250
theme videos.
And they had,

1112
01:12:53.251 --> 01:12:57.940
originally they had talked to the Sklar brothers about doing this and um,

1113
01:12:58.140 --> 01:12:59.490
I think they probably,

1114
01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:05.280
they were probably smart enough to like charge money for it.
Um,

1115
01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:09.590
we were desperate and we were like,
but it ended up,
I mean it was a l w I don't,

1116
01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:12.000
again,
I don't remember what the price was,

1117
01:13:12.001 --> 01:13:16.110
but it was not a lot to make 21 videos over the course of the summer.

1118
01:13:16.111 --> 01:13:19.310
And they were going to like take us in this RV around the u s and we were gonna

1119
01:13:19.330 --> 01:13:24.030
like show up at a place and create something.
Yeah.

1120
01:13:24.330 --> 01:13:26.040
Um,
and so

1121
01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:29.800
<v 7>I remember the first day of the guys under Cusick Lars.
Yeah.</v>

1122
01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:33.740
Well we met him after that and that they didn't seem to care,

1123
01:13:33.970 --> 01:13:37.260
but they didn't get that job.
They were cool with it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh,

1124
01:13:37.450 --> 01:13:38.050
but I remember that,
or the

1125
01:13:38.050 --> 01:13:40.720
<v 9>first day when we showed up on location and they're like,
all right,</v>

1126
01:13:40.721 --> 01:13:44.050
here's your RV.
And I'm like,
Damn,
they got a nice RV.
Right?

1127
01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:48.370
And it's like the whole team is lined up out there and there's like Canadian

1128
01:13:48.371 --> 01:13:53.371
writers that they flew in and it was probably eight or nine people lined up and

1129
01:13:53.711 --> 01:13:57.610
they're like,
all right,
here's the RV.
And we're like,
okay,
let's go.

1130
01:13:57.611 --> 01:14:00.610
And we start getting on the RV and we turn around and they're like standing

1131
01:14:00.611 --> 01:14:05.560
there and we're like,
okay,
we're ready.

1132
01:14:05.890 --> 01:14:07.270
And they're like,
yeah,
go.

1133
01:14:07.390 --> 01:14:12.070
And they had just given us the RV and then they all got in like a passenger van

1134
01:14:12.071 --> 01:14:16.630
and followed us around the country.
Really.
And we've felt horrible.
I mean,

1135
01:14:16.631 --> 01:14:19.210
now I'd be like,
yeah,
he can't get it.
My RFP,

1136
01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:24.730
that was like naive and you know all the money that they didn't spend on us,

1137
01:14:24.731 --> 01:14:29.480
they spend on like that's awesome.
And Coors light,
they kept giving us cores.

1138
01:14:29.490 --> 01:14:32.740
Like you can't drink Coors light to this day because it just,

1139
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:36.520
when you're in the back of an RSV Harvey no good.

1140
01:14:36.690 --> 01:14:40.240
Like they would open the door to the RV and we wouldn't know where we were.

1141
01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:42.790
I mean,
we didn't drink that much quarter's light,
but I mean,

1142
01:14:42.791 --> 01:14:46.690
you'd get disoriented.
It's kind of like probably like just,
you know,
traveling,

1143
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:49.990
you know,
doing your gigs or whatever.
At some point you're like,

1144
01:14:50.230 --> 01:14:54.400
I don't exactly know where I'm at.
Yeah.
They'd open the door and be like,
well,

1145
01:14:55.230 --> 01:15:00.130
uh,
we're in Maine.
You got six hours and make a video God.

1146
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:02.980
And then they would shut the door and they'd open it again.

1147
01:15:02.981 --> 01:15:07.840
This is what it feels like now in retrospect was like we were in somewhere in

1148
01:15:07.841 --> 01:15:12.280
the Midwest and I was like,
you're at a board game convention.
We've got,

1149
01:15:12.281 --> 01:15:14.700
you asked to go in there and make a video.
It was like a,

1150
01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:17.770
like a role playing role playing games.

1151
01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:21.980
<v 10>So would you guys just brainstorm the whole way to the next place and come on</v>

1152
01:15:21.981 --> 01:15:26.630
with something?
We would like,
we would work something out like for that it was,

1153
01:15:26.631 --> 01:15:30.010
we're going to go and they've given us like a space on the floor and we're going

1154
01:15:30.011 --> 01:15:34.460
to say that we've got a new role playing game and that we need the test
audience.

1155
01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:38.750
And so it was called intergalactic food smugglers.

1156
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:41.950
<v 9>Yeah.
Cause it had to be about food because of Alka Seltzer.
Oh,
right.</v>

1157
01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.030
It makes sense.

1158
01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:47.020
At a certain point you've got to start popping those Alka Seltzer.
Since then,

1159
01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:50.030
<v 10>have you done a lot of food?
You know,
like,
yeah.</v>

1160
01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:54.620
No it wasn't because that was oh eight and then we didn't start GMM.

1161
01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:59.830
Good mythical morning until 2012 and we didn't start eating stuff on GMM until a

1162
01:15:59.870 --> 01:16:04.100
couple of years until 2014 to give people who don't know that are listening or

1163
01:16:04.101 --> 01:16:06.890
watching.
Uh,
how many youtube channels do you guys have?

1164
01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:13.260
<v 9>I've Damn fiveish five ish.
He's kind of our loose,</v>

1165
01:16:13.670 --> 01:16:17.780
I mean we've got good mythical morning is a show and then every morning,

1166
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:21.710
yeah that show continues.
So there's like 10 more minutes that's good.

1167
01:16:21.711 --> 01:16:25.510
Mythical more where it's like more laid back like behind the scenes another

1168
01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:28.880
channel but hanging out more of the same show.
And then we have our podcasts,

1169
01:16:28.881 --> 01:16:32.120
ear biscuits that we do every week and that's another channel.

1170
01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:37.100
And that's basically we have the [inaudible] have our main charity,
original

1171
01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:39.450
<v 10>Rhett and link channels.
What I'm saying,
which we like,</v>

1172
01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:42.330
it's basically just an archive at this point because we don't have a,

1173
01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:45.600
we're not uploading anything to it just because you're focusing on the other

1174
01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:46.830
places.
Yeah cause everything,

1175
01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:50.700
any whatever we're doing that's like narrative scripted stuff that we're

1176
01:16:50.701 --> 01:16:54.150
developing is more traditional route right now.

1177
01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:58.380
So instead of trying to do that on youtube.
Oh going traditional as in TV.
Yeah.

1178
01:16:58.450 --> 01:17:00.480
Yoga.
Yeah.
So I mean we did,

1179
01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:05.430
we had like a youtube red I guess youtube premium now show like a half hour

1180
01:17:05.431 --> 01:17:09.980
comedy for two seasons on that.
But again,
that was we,
we,

1181
01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:13.160
and I think we put that on the GMM channel because it has this point that

1182
01:17:13.161 --> 01:17:17.030
channel has like 15 million subscribers versus being the original channels got

1183
01:17:17.031 --> 01:17:21.830
like four or five bullshit.
Yeah.
Because it's just the,
because the daily,

1184
01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:24.680
the GMM was just a,
a side project.

1185
01:17:24.681 --> 01:17:29.681
So the reason we moved to La is so if you fast forward from those Alka Seltzer

1186
01:17:30.230 --> 01:17:31.730
days,
you get to,

1187
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.000
we just started like we were making our money through just brand integrations.

1188
01:17:37.251 --> 01:17:37.790
Right.

1189
01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:41.780
Then eventually we turned off like we got into the youtube partner programs

1190
01:17:41.781 --> 01:17:44.270
where they caught it at the time where,
you know,

1191
01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:45.950
the ad sends money started coming in.

1192
01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:48.430
So we kind of supplemented our income doing that.

1193
01:17:48.490 --> 01:17:52.990
<v 9>Yes.
So they share like 55% with the creators.</v>

1194
01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:54.010
It's like a standard.

1195
01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:58.670
<v 10>Right.
And,
but we are continuing to do that.
Uh,</v>

1196
01:17:58.671 --> 01:18:00.650
and then we were trying all kinds of stuff.

1197
01:18:00.651 --> 01:18:05.000
This is all back in North Carolina like we would,
we music videos,

1198
01:18:05.001 --> 01:18:09.860
sketch.
Um,
and then one of the things that's really started hitting and like,

1199
01:18:09.861 --> 01:18:12.110
oh eight oh nine was we started making local commercials.

1200
01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:15.030
<v 9>Yes.
I've seen a few of them.
We did,</v>

1201
01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:17.750
we did one for a furniture place.

1202
01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:20.250
<v 7>No Red House furniture,
wherever the white people and white people</v>

1203
01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:25.000
love that one.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1204
01:18:25.001 --> 01:18:30.001
I think years ago we just audio only we played that on their show.

1205
01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:33.310
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1206
01:18:34.290 --> 01:18:38.390
We're in the ad,
you know,
singing that part.
Oh my gosh.
That's you guys.
Yeah.

1207
01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:39.760
So we started doing that.
Right.

1208
01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:42.930
<v 9>Black people,
white people is still allowed to buy furniture there only block,</v>

1209
01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:45.670
<v 10>no,
no.</v>

1210
01:18:45.690 --> 01:18:49.280
All people or as the guy at the end of the things as an Hispanic people to

1211
01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:53.050
expand it.
Yeah.
Um,
so,
but we,

1212
01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:57.820
so we did that and then that was like the first time we started getting interest

1213
01:18:57.821 --> 01:19:01.960
from La.
We,
all these production companies started calling and saying,

1214
01:19:01.961 --> 01:19:05.060
we'd love to turn this into some kind of show.
Um,

1215
01:19:05.890 --> 01:19:07.990
we ended up selling a season of the show to IFC.

1216
01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:12.870
That was when we packed everybody up and move to the loss.

1217
01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:15.980
<v 9>So that show was only one season,
but we made,</v>

1218
01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:21.560
we made one commercial for a taxidermist in Ohi called Chuck Testa.

1219
01:19:21.561 --> 01:19:24.920
So there was like a meme that was,
nope,
chuck Testa.
Was that,

1220
01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:28.540
is that like doing that?
That was that also just off a cold call.
Do you just,

1221
01:19:28.541 --> 01:19:31.370
well I'll place at that.
No,
at that point,
you know,

1222
01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.070
through the production company they said,
all right,

1223
01:19:34.071 --> 01:19:37.490
we're going to do the casting.
Thanks.
So then people would send in tapes.
Oh,

1224
01:19:37.491 --> 01:19:38.960
I got you.
So there was like a once,

1225
01:19:38.961 --> 01:19:43.961
it was like an audition tape where it was like Chuck's son was filming him skin

1226
01:19:44.331 --> 01:19:46.130
something and to dude's barefoot.

1227
01:19:46.131 --> 01:19:50.750
And he talks like this and he's very deadpan and we're like,
this guy's great.

1228
01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:53.150
So we came up with,
nope,
chuck Testa,

1229
01:19:53.151 --> 01:19:56.360
like just watching the audition tape and we're like,

1230
01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:59.150
I bet you we can talk this guy into doing anything.

1231
01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:04.430
And it was like a really good sport.
Any like,
he says it like,

1232
01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:08.010
it changed my life for maybe a year.
I don't know.
He's,
he's still a friend of

1233
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:09.150
<v 7>you.
Do you,
uh,</v>

1234
01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:12.840
you guys had or have you done or are interested in doing features at all or no?

1235
01:20:13.230 --> 01:20:17.310
Yeah,
I mean,
we,
10 years ago,
well,

1236
01:20:17.311 --> 01:20:18.620
more than 10 years ago now,
we,

1237
01:20:18.850 --> 01:20:22.140
we did it like a documentary feature that was us trying to find our first grade

1238
01:20:22.141 --> 01:20:26.570
teacher.
Oh,
I saw that.
Spoiler alert.
Founder.
Yeah.
Look at you and miss lot.

1239
01:20:26.571 --> 01:20:29.610
You're watched it or you saw that it existed.
I saw that it exists,

1240
01:20:31.630 --> 01:20:32.240
but

1241
01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:35.540
<v 11>what'd you still going to spoil it?
I know you said on your video</v>

1242
01:20:36.170 --> 01:20:38.510
<v 7>set it and we read it is yeah.
But yeah,
no,
we want it.</v>

1243
01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:43.100
We don't have nothing in the works right now.
Uh Huh.
Uh,
but yeah.

1244
01:20:43.190 --> 01:20:47.780
Are you ever like,
do you ever stop?
Like,
are you ever astounded at like that?

1245
01:20:47.781 --> 01:20:51.410
Not like 15 million.
It's crazy.
It's crazy,
right?

1246
01:20:51.490 --> 01:20:56.030
Because when we started touring and like the,
you know,
like the Gig at the Ryman,

1247
01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:58.430
I mean,
just to be able to say,
oh,
we're playing at the Ryman,

1248
01:20:58.431 --> 01:21:01.910
less wild country music fans.
That's,
that's pretty amazing.
Yeah.
And then,

1249
01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:02.240
you know,

1250
01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:05.090
we get went to Australia and like people are buying tickets and showing up.

1251
01:21:05.091 --> 01:21:09.620
It's just weird man.
It's crazy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And again,
like I think it's even like,

1252
01:21:10.010 --> 01:21:13.600
you know,
we come from standup so you think of it like it's a,
you know,

1253
01:21:13.670 --> 01:21:15.410
more traditional path.
Right.

1254
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:20.220
But like you basically built this path like there that didn't really exist for

1255
01:21:20.221 --> 01:21:24.650
you.
Yeah,
we are.
We've just kind of stumbled into the next thing.

1256
01:21:24.710 --> 01:21:28.970
Twilio,
it's,
it's we an hour at this place where,

1257
01:21:28.971 --> 01:21:33.971
because of the popularity of this one show we can show,

1258
01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:37.370
we wouldn't have to necessarily be funny.

1259
01:21:38.090 --> 01:21:41.060
Like we would still probably have people show up,

1260
01:21:41.061 --> 01:21:45.500
which I think is probably happening with youtubers who are doing live shows.

1261
01:21:45.501 --> 01:21:50.150
I'm not going to name any names,
but I the,
we have this,

1262
01:21:50.210 --> 01:21:52.460
this way that we can have an idea.

1263
01:21:52.461 --> 01:21:56.390
Like we just were finishing a novel right now that's coming out in the fall that

1264
01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:59.820
is,
uh,
you know,
it's all it kind of based in,

1265
01:21:59.821 --> 01:22:03.860
and the two boys who are freshmen in high school kind of encountering some weird

1266
01:22:03.861 --> 01:22:07.700
stuff in their town.
And the fact that people,

1267
01:22:07.730 --> 01:22:10.610
we've got a built in audience who's going to read that hopefully beyond the

1268
01:22:10.611 --> 01:22:13.170
audience will read it as well.
Sure.
But it just gives you the A,

1269
01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:15.460
you can kind of play around with Tabatha Presale,
manic.

1270
01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:20.390
I got an order order that thing.
Do you mean,
so look,
since you guys are such,

1271
01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:21.800
um,
you know,
uh,

1272
01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:26.480
so into and knows the youtube audience so well and how it works.
I mean,

1273
01:22:26.570 --> 01:22:29.150
can you give us some guidance?
Like we have a Fart Mike,
right?

1274
01:22:29.151 --> 01:22:33.920
So anybody doing to up our game one?
Anything?

1275
01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:38.720
Any advice?
Hmm.
Well,
let me see what you got.
Hit me on the Fart,
Mike.
Yeah,

1276
01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:43.010
I have nothing right now.
Empty.
Do you guys have any farts?

1277
01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:46.280
Uh,
no.

1278
01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:50.690
I just thought maybe I did,
but I was,
I really wanted to think about it for you.

1279
01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:52.640
Yeah.
Glad you did.
Well,
he has,

1280
01:22:52.670 --> 01:22:57.350
you have farted on you farted on firearms on the podcast one time.

1281
01:22:58.210 --> 01:22:59.180
Right into the mic though.

1282
01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:06.010
<v 11>So we each fund and Mike was here,
but I mean it was hard.</v>

1283
01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:10.370
<v 8>Gmn You'd hear it.
Oh,
GMM.
We've each farted,
uh,</v>

1284
01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:15.040
unintentionally and it was caught on camera and left.
We found that quite funny.

1285
01:23:15.850 --> 01:23:20.560
Hey,
do we have that clip of their food?
The thing,
let me load it up.

1286
01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:25.490
Yeah.
The,
there's um,
just to kind of inform the audience,
like here's a,
yeah,

1287
01:23:25.810 --> 01:23:28.960
you guys,
I felt like I disappointed you cause I didn't fart.
And Dear Mike,

1288
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:30.490
I'll let you know if one comes out.

1289
01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:33.160
Here's a written link food tasting video that we found.

1290
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.230
<v 12>2010.
This is when you had a beard.</v>

1291
01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:44.020
Look at that belly

1292
01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:50.820
cause I'm a fucking glutton done.
Low Angle is great

1293
01:23:54.090 --> 01:23:56.760
baby.
It's fucking man and

1294
01:24:02.610 --> 01:24:03.443
people legs.

1295
01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:09.190
<v 8>Oh
No,
never seen this guy.</v>

1296
01:24:11.010 --> 01:24:13.840
<v 12>It's fucking lag off its first fucking leg.</v>

1297
01:24:13.930 --> 01:24:18.390
<v 8>Well he'd switched up so he,
that's king ass ripper.
And uh,</v>

1298
01:24:18.670 --> 01:24:22.930
he used to just exclusively do fart videos under the handle.

1299
01:24:22.931 --> 01:24:27.190
I fart in your face and he would get kicked off of youtube and he'd go to live

1300
01:24:27.191 --> 01:24:29.670
leak and then lively could get kicked off.

1301
01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:34.390
We're were torn and tattered.

1302
01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:40.320
Well No,
there was a little seeks.
So he would look kind of at,

1303
01:24:40.330 --> 01:24:43.930
you'd see a color change and he would do things like

1304
01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:49.780
they were really like,
they looked worse than that shirt that's on,

1305
01:24:50.050 --> 01:24:50.531
you know what I mean?

1306
01:24:50.531 --> 01:24:54.580
He's a guy where did and he would just like walk up the stairs,
turn around,

1307
01:24:54.610 --> 01:24:57.970
look at you fart.
Or I'd lay on the couch two thumbs up.

1308
01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:01.960
But see I don't mean to,
but he went down the glutton angle now.

1309
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:06.880
So now he's all about,
and
personally I like his earlier work.

1310
01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:10.630
I'm in the car.
It's a little more on your payroll cause I'm about to,

1311
01:25:10.730 --> 01:25:15.370
I go a new one.
No,
no,
no.
Please ask for a new one.

1312
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:18.790
I don't like this guy because he's,
you know,

1313
01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:21.490
please tell us he could be real,

1314
01:25:21.491 --> 01:25:24.460
but he's not like the Internet's the Internet can,

1315
01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:28.480
it can contain the real version of it.
You don't like the bit,

1316
01:25:28.570 --> 01:25:30.280
I think this is a bit virgin.
There was a,

1317
01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:33.310
I mean there's a guy who was on Instagram who was a,

1318
01:25:33.850 --> 01:25:36.190
he was a security guard.
It's like,

1319
01:25:39.230 --> 01:25:42.730
that guy's great.
Yeah,
that's an artist.
It's a good work.
He,
I mean,

1320
01:25:42.731 --> 01:25:47.650
he got fired for fun.
I mean,
you've talked to him.
No,
we,
no.
Yeah,
no.

1321
01:25:47.651 --> 01:25:48.700
Yeah,
he's bringing him out.

1322
01:25:51.890 --> 01:25:56.200
It's just like that about this guy.
The Kang here.

1323
01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:57.850
He won't,
he won't respond.

1324
01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:02.890
We've tried calling him dedicated to video Tufts once dedicated to your mom's

1325
01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:04.040
house,
but

1326
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:08.400
<v 7>he,
he won't actually,
he scared dairy co coy.
No,
wait,
so what you're saying,</v>

1327
01:26:08.410 --> 01:26:10.280
I'm saying he's not a good character.

1328
01:26:10.281 --> 01:26:14.040
I'm just saying once you seen the real thing,
you know,
they,

1329
01:26:14.041 --> 01:26:17.630
that kind of exist and this is just frustrates you knowing that you're not

1330
01:26:17.631 --> 01:26:21.140
seeing it.
You're saying that you don't feel the authenticity from this guy.

1331
01:26:21.141 --> 01:26:24.070
He feel like this is a show and this is not who he is.

1332
01:26:24.130 --> 01:26:26.680
Is that what you're telling me?
Wow.
I've never see.

1333
01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:31.630
You want it to read more genuine or grounded grounded performance at this is,

1334
01:26:31.670 --> 01:26:34.750
this is a performance he's playing.
A character will see that.

1335
01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:38.060
I think that like my favorite thing about,
there's nothing wrong with that.
No,

1336
01:26:38.061 --> 01:26:41.420
I get it.
But just when you've seen the real thing,
the commercials you made,

1337
01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:45.410
you know,
those like the great thing about those commercials,

1338
01:26:45.411 --> 01:26:47.390
I mean it's I guess a subjective,

1339
01:26:47.391 --> 01:26:52.010
depends on your sense of humor was when you feel like this is real,

1340
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:54.950
you know what I mean?
Like Dad,
you know,
the first one we ever made,

1341
01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:58.220
we made it for furniture,
another furniture place,

1342
01:26:58.221 --> 01:27:01.310
Bobby Denny furniture in somewhere in North Carolina.

1343
01:27:01.311 --> 01:27:04.880
High point and a high points real close.
No,
no,
not hide.

1344
01:27:04.881 --> 01:27:08.540
It wasn't high point though.
It was free.
It was down in Mount Olive Anyway,

1345
01:27:08.570 --> 01:27:12.680
but we made the commercial for them and they had this like tradition and making

1346
01:27:12.681 --> 01:27:16.470
really,
you know,
funny commercials,
unintentionally funny commercials.
Uh,

1347
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:21.910
and we acted like we were two of the family members and we kind of like where

1348
01:27:23.061 --> 01:27:26.480
the leads and the commercial and we got that to be a part of it.

1349
01:27:26.770 --> 01:27:31.370
But we watched it back.
We were like,
well,
we put it out.
We did it.
I was like,

1350
01:27:31.371 --> 01:27:33.460
this is not great.
Uh,

1351
01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:36.860
but at the same time we made the red house and then the Cuban gynocologist

1352
01:27:36.861 --> 01:27:38.480
because that guy,
that guy was in high point.

1353
01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:41.900
So that's the guy who was a used car salesman from Cuba who had been a

1354
01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:46.810
gynocologist Cuba.
And so we kind of leaned into that and it was like,

1355
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:48.470
I didn't give him a stethoscope.

1356
01:27:48.471 --> 01:27:53.360
He had it in his drawer sales desk and that's why I was in,

1357
01:27:53.490 --> 01:27:56.360
and that's the switch we made was we don't,
why,

1358
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:59.120
why do we have to play characters with these real people?

1359
01:27:59.570 --> 01:28:02.070
Basically writing this for us.
I mean,
that's what we like.

1360
01:28:02.090 --> 01:28:05.600
We've always found the stuff that we make that we're not in to be,

1361
01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:09.140
that's our favorite stuff is stuff that,
and when it's real,
it's like,

1362
01:28:09.141 --> 01:28:12.500
is this is based on this guy's story is one of those commercials maybe as the

1363
01:28:12.501 --> 01:28:16.310
furniture one or maybe it's another one where you had the mother,

1364
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:20.720
somebody who was like,
try to say a line like 40 times.
Um,

1365
01:28:21.530 --> 01:28:24.890
we got scooters.
Yeah.
Was it?
We got scooters that was,

1366
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:28.730
that was an outtake from the one that he's talking about where we played the two

1367
01:28:28.731 --> 01:28:32.930
brothers.
Yes.
And then we realized that was so much funny.
That was hilarious.

1368
01:28:32.931 --> 01:28:37.000
That's when it clicked it.
And she's scooters.
She could like,

1369
01:28:37.370 --> 01:28:41.870
she would even like screw up.
We got scooters,
right.
There's 10 different ways.

1370
01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:44.390
And she frustrated or,
so we got her to market.

1371
01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:49.490
We said you can market a scooter to people who've had DUIs.
So we're like,

1372
01:28:49.670 --> 01:28:54.260
oh,
that's right.
You got a Dwi,
get a scooter.
And she couldn't say Dwi.

1373
01:28:54.450 --> 01:28:57.240
Right.
That's what it was.
That was,
that was yours.
Yeah.

1374
01:28:57.260 --> 01:28:59.870
That should've been the ad.
Right.
That was just an outfit.
That's it.

1375
01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:01.980
That should be your only

1376
01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:07.080
<v 8>thing that got DWI.
He scooter.
That's hilarious.</v>

1377
01:29:07.110 --> 01:29:09.520
Yeah.
Um,
so you guys were,

1378
01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:13.290
one of the things we discussed sometimes on this show is,
you know,
we're married.

1379
01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:16.320
You guys are basically a married couple,
by the way.
Very good looking guys.

1380
01:29:16.321 --> 01:29:20.820
I can see why you have a successful channel.
So God,
they're good looking.

1381
01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:21.851
<v 1>They are.</v>

1382
01:29:21.851 --> 01:29:25.720
There is so much cuter than youtubers are generally cuter than comedians.
Oh,

1383
01:29:25.721 --> 01:29:29.230
for sure.
Yeah.
You guys have a look.
I can see why.
You know,

1384
01:29:29.470 --> 01:29:32.830
the more we spend a lot of time on her hair.
Yeah.
He has great hair.

1385
01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.850
You get outfits,
you're very fit.

1386
01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:37.600
<v 8>That's when I can tell you guys when Hollywood with that hair.
But anyway.
Yeah,</v>

1387
01:29:37.610 --> 01:29:41.430
right.
Yeah.
That's not North Carolina hair.
Right.
So anyway,

1388
01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:43.490
we discussed with,
yeah,
you're nice.

1389
01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:47.510
Chanel's we discussed whether or not you know how ride or die.
Um,

1390
01:29:47.630 --> 01:29:50.690
one of the scenarios that came up once was like,
I go to Starbucks,

1391
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:54.140
it's like an addiction every day.
And I have a very specific order.

1392
01:29:54.141 --> 01:29:57.650
It's not that complicated,
but I like a splash of milk.

1393
01:29:57.651 --> 01:30:01.550
A lot of times I'll watch them just dump milk,
like get upset.
And I told her,

1394
01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:02.481
you know what,

1395
01:30:02.481 --> 01:30:07.481
if I were to wait outside one of these locations and I target the Barista who

1396
01:30:09.351 --> 01:30:13.850
made it wrong,
I killed them in a fit of rage.
And then I come home and I'm like,

1397
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:17.570
I gotta tell you something.
I killed somebody today.
Oh,
okay.

1398
01:30:17.630 --> 01:30:22.400
Would you turn me in?
So let's flip the scenario and mean you guys,

1399
01:30:23.410 --> 01:30:27.170
your partner here is like,
hey man,
I know we're about to record.
Uh,

1400
01:30:27.171 --> 01:30:28.370
I gotta tell you something real quick.

1401
01:30:28.371 --> 01:30:30.680
I know we're going to try out these hot dogs,

1402
01:30:30.681 --> 01:30:34.880
but let me tell you something real quick.
Ah,
ah,
I kill somebody today.
Anyways,

1403
01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:38.590
you got to understand I'm not good with hypothetical situations.

1404
01:30:38.591 --> 01:30:41.900
So when you pitch a hypothetical,
I start to internalize it as real.

1405
01:30:41.901 --> 01:30:44.830
So like I'm an emotional guy.

1406
01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:48.780
I feel like you're going to fucking break here.
Yeah,
that's fine.

1407
01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:53.960
I think this is a pretty clear thing.
Yeah.
I would have my answer.

1408
01:30:54.010 --> 01:30:58.820
I would try to find a way to help him evade the situation.

1409
01:30:58.821 --> 01:31:02.030
This is my man was sitting,
by the way,
it turned me in and

1410
01:31:04.490 --> 01:31:06.930
you and I have a similar conversation with our therapist.

1411
01:31:08.150 --> 01:31:12.070
My therapist is also like,
you are living in a narrow bandwidth of emotions

1412
01:31:15.650 --> 01:31:16.610
and then she's like,

1413
01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:21.730
<v 1>call immediately.
Immediately.
Yeah.
Well,
here's my thinking.</v>

1414
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:26.720
Okay.
Because he's the father of my small children and if here's,
here's the deal,

1415
01:31:26.721 --> 01:31:28.730
man,
if it were alike,

1416
01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:33.200
he kills a pedophile or he kills a somebody that hurts our family.

1417
01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:37.310
Dude,
on the first one to get a shovel,
I'm going to help him get rid of the body.

1418
01:31:37.370 --> 01:31:38.240
Right?
Okay.
Now,

1419
01:31:38.241 --> 01:31:42.530
if it's just a Barista at Starbucks who gets his drink order over and over
wrong,

1420
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:48.260
it means that something's wrong,
right?
Something screw screwy up here,
right?

1421
01:31:48.290 --> 01:31:50.390
Who knows what's he's going to snap on next.

1422
01:31:50.391 --> 01:31:54.580
That's not a reason to kill a man or a woman said to me,

1423
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:58.010
<v 8>I tell her this one time,
she's like,
oh,</v>

1424
01:31:58.320 --> 01:31:59.940
what if you're going to kill me in the kids?
Yes.

1425
01:32:00.810 --> 01:32:03.990
<v 11>Take it slow because he's capable,
but why?
Why wouldn't I take it</v>

1426
01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:06.970
<v 8>there?
He is capable of murdering a Barista over an incorrect drink order.</v>

1427
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.630
Who would say he's not going to turn that rage on myself where the children,

1428
01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:11.800
I got to protect my kids.

1429
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:16.090
Do you do stuff for him like splashing milk and the things for them all the time

1430
01:32:16.091 --> 01:32:17.290
just to prevent the range?

1431
01:32:17.370 --> 01:32:19.410
<v 11>Yeah.
That's no way to live</v>

1432
01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:24.600
nervously splashing milk.
This does.
Oh I do.

1433
01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:27.340
I do think he gets in the car.
You're running out later.

1434
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:30.140
See you and I are similar emotionally when I have to

1435
01:32:30.210 --> 01:32:31.770
<v 8>get his Starbucks order.</v>

1436
01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:36.180
There is that anxiety and be like I better get this right.
I this right.

1437
01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:38.130
Take a measuring spoon.

1438
01:32:38.730 --> 01:32:43.730
Oh you know some people bring their own cups mugs and bring your own little

1439
01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:49.200
thing and be like this is what you need to put the milk.

1440
01:32:49.201 --> 01:32:52.330
You know what I've started to do?
Great idea.
It feels like a,

1441
01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:56.270
would you please validate this idea?
No,
no.
I said quite started to address it.

1442
01:32:56.580 --> 01:33:01.580
I started to say a black nothing in it and then like when their start making

1443
01:33:02.071 --> 01:33:05.970
that I go,
oh,
can I get on the side a little bit of milk that's smart.

1444
01:33:05.971 --> 01:33:07.710
And then there'll be like,
do you want room?
And I go,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1445
01:33:07.711 --> 01:33:10.850
Cause I don't want them to be like,
well here we'll leave this much.
They just,

1446
01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:15.720
what drinking?
What's your drink?
So easy.
Okay.
It is.

1447
01:33:16.450 --> 01:33:21.000
It's of this event,
a large iced coffee,
extra ice.

1448
01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:25.260
Okay.
No sweetener.
All sweetener.
That's it.

1449
01:33:25.290 --> 01:33:28.260
That's how it does.
And then you say,
and then I go,

1450
01:33:28.261 --> 01:33:32.460
can I get a side Cup before that?
Before I did that,
yeah.
I would say a splash.

1451
01:33:32.461 --> 01:33:33.030
A whole milk.

1452
01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:38.030
You say a splash and I would watch these dudes and ladies just go like do two,

1453
01:33:38.641 --> 01:33:43.030
two,
two,
two,
two,
two,
two,
two sides.
I'm like,
come on man.
Splashes section.

1454
01:33:43.130 --> 01:33:48.050
Not as precise term.
And he's an engineer.
It is a precise term.

1455
01:33:48.170 --> 01:33:51.360
But then I would say I would start when I would get frustrated about that,

1456
01:33:51.361 --> 01:33:54.990
I would say,
can I get a very small splash?

1457
01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:57.210
We're a very small amount.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1458
01:33:57.211 --> 01:33:59.430
I would still get like just half a glass of milk.

1459
01:33:59.431 --> 01:34:01.710
So then I used to go nigga black.
Got It.

1460
01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:05.610
But it's in precise and the engineers these to the brains here are like,

1461
01:34:05.611 --> 01:34:07.840
you're being in precise,
but you would help him,
Barry,

1462
01:34:07.850 --> 01:34:11.310
you would help him bury the body.
No,
no.
Let's revisit hearing my argument.

1463
01:34:12.030 --> 01:34:15.420
Go ahead.
He's a sociopath.

1464
01:34:15.450 --> 01:34:19.410
Clearly he's a psychopath.
So you're seeing Rhett did what you,

1465
01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:23.230
he has a Barista.
I'm saying in that scenario,
but,

1466
01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:27.330
but ret also see if you did something,
just like if she came to me,

1467
01:34:27.331 --> 01:34:30.240
if she was at came to me and she was like,
oh,
dropping off the kids at school.

1468
01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:32.670
That's a mailman man.
I killed him.
I'd be like,
Oh really?

1469
01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:36.810
Let's figure out how to get like hide this and I'm going to help you get out of

1470
01:34:36.811 --> 01:34:39.850
this session.
That would be my first thought.
How do I help you get away with,

1471
01:34:39.890 --> 01:34:42.480
yeah,
I can provoke.
That would be,

1472
01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:46.110
I think my first thought would be unprovoked murder.
Did you hear that?

1473
01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:52.590
We both go to prison.
Who's raising the kids?
That's another true.
Yeah.

1474
01:34:53.250 --> 01:34:55.920
Okay.
Well first thought we got to get away with it.

1475
01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:58.280
I think my thought would be,

1476
01:34:58.790 --> 01:35:03.550
<v 7>I bet.
I bet we don't have to tell anybody.
I bet we can.
Yeah.
Oh,
bullshit.</v>

1477
01:35:03.970 --> 01:35:07.460
I think that would,
but then there'd be a second thought right after it.

1478
01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:11.630
Like immediately right after it.
It's like there's no way that I can succeed.

1479
01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:15.030
I'm pretty good at keeping secrets,
but I'm not good at like a body.

1480
01:35:15.070 --> 01:35:18.200
You would be like,
this is what I think.
I think you'd be like,
all right man,

1481
01:35:18.770 --> 01:35:20.270
we're definitely,
we're just not going to say anything.

1482
01:35:20.271 --> 01:35:22.680
And then he would go to lunch and come back.
He'd be like,
FBI has come.

1483
01:35:27.670 --> 01:35:28.440
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

1484
01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:31.570
<v 7>Cave in a minute.
I feel like he doesn't have the constitution.</v>

1485
01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:37.150
You said you feel your emotions,
right?
You Express when your feelings are hurt.

1486
01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:40.960
It would be overwhelming.
Yes.
It's a natural thing to do.
Well,

1487
01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:44.260
I didn't know the Barista.
I don't know.
My feelings will be hurt.
Well,

1488
01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:48.910
maybe you'd be like,
God,
how often are you doing?
I said,
well,

1489
01:35:48.911 --> 01:35:52.330
here's the,
here's the mitigating factor,
uh,
that I,

1490
01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:55.630
I think you're right that I would just say,
hey,
you're going down man,

1491
01:35:55.631 --> 01:35:59.410
and I'm not going with you.
Uh,
because is there a closet in our,

1492
01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:04.120
in our insurance,
like we've got probably at a certain point we got,

1493
01:36:04.150 --> 01:36:07.030
we got insurance.
Yeah.
Can we talk about it?

1494
01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:10.450
Is talking about the insurance make it where if you kill somebody,

1495
01:36:10.451 --> 01:36:14.140
I can't get it.
Does it,
does it include like moral failure?

1496
01:36:14.970 --> 01:36:17.230
Probably morality,
moral failure.

1497
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:20.980
We need checking it out and if you're morally disabled,
oh wow,

1498
01:36:21.930 --> 01:36:26.930
that's a great way to say you're in prison then I am going,

1499
01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:32.170
I gotta get,
I gotta get that income that is gone by you not being there,

1500
01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:35.230
which is going to be low,
like 95%.

1501
01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:39.520
You're going to be like that 5% contribution that you make.

1502
01:36:40.150 --> 01:36:42.550
You know,
I want to get that.
I want to get that quantified.

1503
01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:48.610
I think if you put this in,
because I,
I,
I think what I would be trying to do is,

1504
01:36:48.611 --> 01:36:51.310
I think,
by the way,
I think I'm much more likely to kill somebody,

1505
01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:53.860
but I would accidentally,
it will be an accident.

1506
01:36:53.950 --> 01:36:57.190
We don't allow him to touch arts sharp objects on the show because he's,

1507
01:36:57.550 --> 01:37:01.720
you know,
is a danger to self and others.
I'm impulsive.

1508
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:06.160
I don't think I'm,
but I'm clumsy and I'm impulsive.

1509
01:37:06.161 --> 01:37:09.140
Minimizing the damage though because um,

1510
01:37:09.670 --> 01:37:14.560
if it a more realistic situation,
like a,
like a hit and run or something,

1511
01:37:14.650 --> 01:37:16.590
something like that.
Like,
you know,
I was,
I was,

1512
01:37:16.591 --> 01:37:18.190
I don't think you should make this more real.

1513
01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:21.710
<v 11>No,
I only hypothetical cause I was watching</v>

1514
01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:24.810
<v 7>is incriminating.
If it's like I was watching,</v>

1515
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:29.510
<v 10>um,
I guess probably some reddit thread and there was this,
uh,</v>

1516
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:34.590
hidden camera or like surveillance footage of somebody pulling out in front of

1517
01:37:35.710 --> 01:37:40.710
this car and the car swerves and the guy like flips and hits assigned.

1518
01:37:42.311 --> 01:37:43.990
Turns out the guy that I ended up in critical condition,

1519
01:37:44.410 --> 01:37:49.410
the person who caused him to do this just like quickly turns around and goes

1520
01:37:49.931 --> 01:37:52.150
away right now.
I,
first of all,

1521
01:37:52.151 --> 01:37:55.440
I don't think I would do that cause it's like you're always going to get in

1522
01:37:55.441 --> 01:37:56.250
those situations.

1523
01:37:56.250 --> 01:37:56.520
<v 7>Right?</v>

1524
01:37:56.520 --> 01:38:01.080
It's e n n I think it'd be too much to deal with if you did get away with it,

1525
01:38:01.230 --> 01:38:04.830
but if you made the mistake,
is that what?
No,
I've seen it.

1526
01:38:04.831 --> 01:38:07.620
So if you made that mistake,
yeah.
You came home and you tell me,
he's like,
dude,

1527
01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:08.513
I just,

1528
01:38:09.230 --> 01:38:09.680
<v 13>okay,</v>

1529
01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:13.050
<v 7>I just caused this guy to rec and then,
but you know,</v>

1530
01:38:13.070 --> 01:38:17.230
my car wasn't hit and I'm here now and I think you've got hurt.
What,

1531
01:38:17.231 --> 01:38:20.600
what should I do?
I panicked.
I didn't intentionally flea.
I just,

1532
01:38:21.820 --> 01:38:22.130
<v 13>okay.</v>

1533
01:38:22.130 --> 01:38:24.620
<v 7>I fled in a panic.
I think in that situation,</v>

1534
01:38:24.650 --> 01:38:29.510
my goal would be to minimize the repercussions in your life.
Right.

1535
01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:34.330
And so I think in that situation,
I'd be like,
you gotta go,

1536
01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:35.980
you gotta turn yourself in right now,

1537
01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:40.480
because that's the most logical thing to do to maximize the situation.
Right?

1538
01:38:40.510 --> 01:38:43.660
Yeah.
But if it was a little bit different and it was like

1539
01:38:46.250 --> 01:38:47.690
you could get away with this,

1540
01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:51.830
I would be the one that would be most likely to find that way and to,

1541
01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:55.010
and to help you.
And he's like,
okay.
He's like,
I was in Boone,

1542
01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:58.610
I was on a hike and I just didn't like the way I guy looked at me.

1543
01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:04.200
<v 8>I cut them up.
He's like,
come on man,
help me out.
You're like,</v>

1544
01:39:04.201 --> 01:39:08.940
all right,
here's what we got to cut him off.
He'll be,
your friend is crazy.

1545
01:39:08.950 --> 01:39:13.950
Like he hears me a just a slip up slip up where you chop up a man.

1546
01:39:15.870 --> 01:39:19.950
No,
you'd have to think that somebody,
something snapped and drained them.

1547
01:39:19.951 --> 01:39:23.740
There's no look at him laughing just like you.

1548
01:39:23.741 --> 01:39:28.420
You guys are the Sickos together.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1549
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:31.920
But somethings does.
Yeah.
Something's wrong.
Can you be like this guys?

1550
01:39:32.150 --> 01:39:35.750
<v 7>Lots of shit right now.
He's,
what if he's,
what if he said,</v>

1551
01:39:35.930 --> 01:39:40.930
all I need you to do is say that we were having lunch in Peoria.

1552
01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:47.180
Can you swing that for me?
I mean,
I,
I'm actually,
I would,

1553
01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:49.520
I'm a little scared at how good I would be at doing it.

1554
01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:54.030
<v 8>Same with him.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You guys are kind of looking forward to that call.</v>

1555
01:39:58.770 --> 01:39:59.950
I mean,
I always laugh.

1556
01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:03.550
<v 7>People like us,
man,
when I get to make the world go round.
Yeah.</v>

1557
01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:06.760
I always look guilty when I didn't do something right.
Yeah.

1558
01:40:06.790 --> 01:40:11.110
But I like to think that when I am guilty,
I'm pretty cool about it.
Like,

1559
01:40:11.111 --> 01:40:11.770
I don't know.
I,

1560
01:40:11.770 --> 01:40:16.080
it's like I have this like investment diversion mentality that it's like I ain't

1561
01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:17.530
guilty about everything.

1562
01:40:17.670 --> 01:40:20.670
<v 8>Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.
This is my guilty voice.</v>

1563
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:22.870
I think we have a

1564
01:40:23.150 --> 01:40:27.850
<v 7>great scenario for a feature or an animated show.
You,
you know,</v>

1565
01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:32.720
an animated murder cover up.
That's what he carving them out.
Yes.
Dude.

1566
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:36.340
Yeah.
I mean this,
it feels like this is had to have been done.
Right.
What,

1567
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:40.980
what was the feeling it would make it a pet.
What's the movie where he's the,
the,

1568
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:43.910
the uh,
the product that's worse in some ways.
Yes.

1569
01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:46.130
The prostitute dies in the very beginning.

1570
01:40:47.310 --> 01:40:51.850
<v 8>Christian Slater was just later.
Oh,
the best movie ever.
American psycho.
No,
no,</v>

1571
01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:54.850
I'm sorry.
No,
it's a bad,

1572
01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:58.770
it's called like bad day or bad.
I don't know.

1573
01:40:58.771 --> 01:41:02.430
It's a very bad thing.
Very bad people or something like that.

1574
01:41:05.130 --> 01:41:07.030
What's up bitch?
Sorry.
Texture.

1575
01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:11.150
What was your last week he gave us this bitch button to shore.
It was,

1576
01:41:11.151 --> 01:41:15.500
I'm about dead prostitutes.
Gotcha.
Yeah,
I was right there,
man.

1577
01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:17.450
I thought you were doing that for you.
That's pretty awesome.

1578
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:20.810
I thought you were doing that thing,
which as a seasoned podcast host,

1579
01:41:20.811 --> 01:41:21.380
you're like,

1580
01:41:21.380 --> 01:41:24.050
we're having that conversation where we're all trying to remember the name of a

1581
01:41:24.051 --> 01:41:28.780
movie that everybody knows.
Oh,
right.
When a bitch to this moment.
No,

1582
01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:33.480
no,
no.
I wish it were very bad thing.
Sorry about that.

1583
01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:34.400
I know you said that.

1584
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:39.080
That's like a group of friends trying to cover as well.

1585
01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:41.870
Let me ask you this,
but you can go there again.
We have,

1586
01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:45.380
<v 0>uh,
the segment,
we do call it a horrible,
are hilarious a lot.</v>

1587
01:41:45.620 --> 01:41:50.480
We show a video and we just get your reaction to this is funny or is it

1588
01:41:50.481 --> 01:41:51.314
terrible?

1589
01:41:51.450 --> 01:41:56.450
One of them actually is a incredibly interesting because of the fact that

1590
01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:00.650
there's like his two buddies involved in something.

1591
01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:05.680
And I'm wondering if you guys would be the hardcore support and friend that the

1592
01:42:09.711 --> 01:42:14.140
one person needs.
Okay.
So this is out in,
uh,

1593
01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:15.600
the,
uh,

1594
01:42:15.601 --> 01:42:19.610
why nature right out in as a stream of water,

1595
01:42:19.611 --> 01:42:22.760
I guess you would call it.
Um,
and these guys are,

1596
01:42:23.060 --> 01:42:27.830
I think they're actually out there trying to,
uh,
get,

1597
01:42:28.670 --> 01:42:29.500
what is it?

1598
01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:31.620
<v 8>Fish?
Yeah.
Yeah.
This is a great</v>

1599
01:42:34.210 --> 01:42:38.680
lobsters.
Crabs to know that nature.
Oh,
right.
Yeah.
So they're,

1600
01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:40.360
they're crabbing there.
Crabbing

1601
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:45.500
<v 0>guest,
but it does,
it's,
it's,
it's not,
uh,
I don't know.
It's not,
it doesn't,</v>

1602
01:42:45.770 --> 01:42:48.860
I always thought of crabbing as like the throwing in

1603
01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:53.990
<v 8>the traps.
Yeah.
These guys are like out there with their hands.
Yeah.
This shit.</v>

1604
01:42:54.290 --> 01:42:58.090
So are they noodling?
Oh No,

1605
01:42:58.730 --> 01:43:03.140
this isn't another part of the kind of noodling.
Okay.
Okay.
Here we go.

1606
01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:09.320
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

1607
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:20.200
<v 8>so he's got it.
He's got a crab on his ding.
Ding.</v>

1608
01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:25.730
But then,
okay.
Okay.
Look,
Rhett comes over,

1609
01:43:29.930 --> 01:43:34.780
handles it first bra.
Oh,
well sure.

1610
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:38.190
It's still there.
It's still there.
Yeah.
Anyways,

1611
01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:44.420
you guys seem deeply troubled.
I am so suspicious of this.

1612
01:43:45.170 --> 01:43:49.630
Does it feel contrived?
Yes.
You got a third person with the camera,
right?

1613
01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:53.060
You all right.
So what was it?

1614
01:43:53.090 --> 01:43:55.970
I was in Bora Bora and I was like,
Hey,
you guys,

1615
01:43:59.380 --> 01:44:03.360
did you hook your friend up like that?
Oh God,

1616
01:44:03.380 --> 01:44:06.920
the crab on a misdemeanor.
Oh,
why didn't he use his own hands?

1617
01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:10.830
That's what I would want.
But that's the main thing.
You got to lands.

1618
01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:14.600
They're right there next to the crotch scream and like,
yeah,
he's freaked out.

1619
01:44:14.601 --> 01:44:18.770
Right.
So freaked out.
Yeah,
but it's,
this is where the video starts.

1620
01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:22.650
It's already,
it's already at this point.
Yeah.

1621
01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:29.333
<v 3>Oh,
right.</v>

1622
01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:34.240
<v 8>He's a good screamer.
Yeah.
He knows that to scream and the,</v>

1623
01:44:34.241 --> 01:44:36.450
and the double screen and the other ones.
The other ones.

1624
01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:39.013
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1625
01:44:40.170 --> 01:44:44.450
<v 7>But if that did it authentically happen to you?
Yeah.
No problem,
man.
No,</v>

1626
01:44:44.451 --> 01:44:45.480
you weren't.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1627
01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:48.000
I don't think I've ever taken anything off of your penis before,

1628
01:44:48.001 --> 01:44:51.870
but when he faces the camera.
Wow.
That's interesting.
Like,
well,
hold on.
Crab.

1629
01:44:51.871 --> 01:44:55.820
And he's like,
here,
look at it.
When I moved out.
Oh,
you,

1630
01:44:55.821 --> 01:44:59.970
you had that other roommate who moved in and I thought,

1631
01:44:59.971 --> 01:45:04.740
I heard the story that you removed a tick from the

1632
01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:11.010
Glens of his penis.
Wow.
Whoa.

1633
01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:12.870
<v 8>This is an exclusive,</v>

1634
01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:17.070
I feel like I would remind me which exclusive I'm talking about.

1635
01:45:17.100 --> 01:45:20.230
Josh says Oyen h x solution.

1636
01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:23.813
Sorry.
Sorry.

1637
01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:26.590
<v 7>Hold on.
Is that your voice?
Hold on.</v>

1638
01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:33.220
I don't think I removed it,
but I do think that he let you watch.

1639
01:45:33.310 --> 01:45:34.600
No,
I think he came,

1640
01:45:34.601 --> 01:45:39.090
I think he came home from like a camping trip or something and it was when I was

1641
01:45:39.190 --> 01:45:42.880
so after link moved out,
um,
and got married,

1642
01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:44.410
I,

1643
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:50.270
I had actually bought this really shady apartment in Raleigh

1644
01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:55.450
and then got like six roommates.

1645
01:45:55.810 --> 01:45:58.660
I slept on the floor and charge them all rent.
Whoa.

1646
01:46:00.210 --> 01:46:05.210
So I just had a distant Lotta guys is coming in and out of there.

1647
01:46:05.390 --> 01:46:10.360
As long as they were willing to pay like $200 a month for some portion of a room

1648
01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:12.640
they could stay.
Sounds disgusting.
And uh,

1649
01:46:12.700 --> 01:46:14.980
there was a guy who when you hear about this guy,

1650
01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:18.400
he came home from something and yeah,
he had a,

1651
01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:22.300
I think he had a tick on his nuts.
Hmm.

1652
01:46:22.930 --> 01:46:27.430
I distinctly remember it being on the wiener on that,
on the tip.
Hmm.

1653
01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:32.500
That's how I remember it.
Like tick,
tick,
tick,
tick,
tick,
tick.

1654
01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:35.860
I've never heard of a tip tech.
I've never heard of that either.
And they get mad.

1655
01:46:35.861 --> 01:46:37.880
I feel like I must have blocked this out cause I definitely did.

1656
01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:39.070
I don't remember.

1657
01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:43.960
I do have this vague recollection of him showing everyone.
He showed it to,

1658
01:46:43.961 --> 01:46:47.590
everyone showed everybody and then he's like,
can you help me out?

1659
01:46:47.710 --> 01:46:52.090
And then I think I was like,
my two hands are holding.
Yeah,

1660
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:54.850
definitely.
I would remember if I helped him.
I didn't.

1661
01:46:54.851 --> 01:46:58.220
I think he showed it to us and then he went to the bathroom and took care of it

1662
01:46:58.221 --> 01:47:01.440
himself.
Jeez.
How do you take care of that?
You just light a flame to it.

1663
01:47:01.441 --> 01:47:04.380
How do you do that?
Yeah.
Don't have to burn off the tick or whatever.

1664
01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:08.430
Burn the tick after you remove it from your,
from your Pecker,

1665
01:47:09.150 --> 01:47:14.040
you burn it onto you.
What you gotta do is you've got to get the pincers out.

1666
01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:15.480
So like with tweezers,

1667
01:47:15.481 --> 01:47:19.050
you've got to get in there and get it and this is small enough you can paint

1668
01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:23.040
nail Polish over a tick and it will,
it will begin to suffocate years,
man.
It,

1669
01:47:23.041 --> 01:47:27.520
it'll let loose on the sugars.
You paint red bugs.
Would you,

1670
01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:31.900
did you ever get chiggers now?
So they definitely are not out here.
No,

1671
01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:33.480
they're in the Midwest,

1672
01:47:33.481 --> 01:47:37.200
but they're all over the southeast and you for some reason only get them when

1673
01:47:37.201 --> 01:47:37.651
your kids,

1674
01:47:37.651 --> 01:47:41.160
but you'll go out and play and then you come back and then you'll have these red

1675
01:47:41.161 --> 01:47:44.790
bumps all in your crotch,
like on the upper thighs.

1676
01:47:45.090 --> 01:47:49.020
And then your mom takes a nail Polish remover

1677
01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:51.061
are clear.

1678
01:47:51.061 --> 01:47:55.610
No clear nail Polish and paint over them and it and it,

1679
01:47:55.740 --> 01:47:58.380
cause they have like a little breathing tube that they've stuck out of your skin

1680
01:47:58.381 --> 01:48:02.640
and they suffocate and die and go away.
Oh my God,
that sounds horrible.

1681
01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:06.650
Racist.
Yeah,
it does.
Yeah,
it does.
There's probably,

1682
01:48:06.810 --> 01:48:10.980
there's probably a new name for them.
That's why I kept saying red bugs.

1683
01:48:11.550 --> 01:48:16.050
Red Bugs.
Yeah.
Geez.
Yeah.
Is there another,

1684
01:48:16.051 --> 01:48:20.670
a horrible,
hilarious to show them.
So yeah,
so we're saying,
ah,
that was hilarious.

1685
01:48:21.540 --> 01:48:25.840
Yeah.
Super Great.
This is not contrived.
This is not okay though.

1686
01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:34.200
<v 6>Oh
yeah.</v>

1687
01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:38.093
That was a ball

1688
01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:43.920
<v 7>goes laughing.
Look at,</v>

1689
01:48:44.510 --> 01:48:49.370
I thought it was a gorilla that was secret back legs on that bullet.

1690
01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:54.180
Looks like,
my God,
that's two men in a suit,
man.
You're like,
there's a Batman.

1691
01:48:54.220 --> 01:48:57.980
That is exactly,
it goes first frame.
Totally shut up.
No,
that's a real bull.

1692
01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:02.150
But my question is the bull went back into the shadows and like crushed this

1693
01:49:02.151 --> 01:49:03.880
woman and then nobody.
Yeah,

1694
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:09.010
<v 6>Po and the gun.
Oh yeah.
It comes out.</v>

1695
01:49:10.710 --> 01:49:12.610
Well this guy's like,
all right man.
All right,
enough of this.

1696
01:49:12.940 --> 01:49:15.500
Get out of here buddy.
Okay.
Dairy comes.

1697
01:49:18.090 --> 01:49:21.900
<v 7>This is terrible.
I just got a cigarette.
Is that the guy,
the bowls owner?</v>

1698
01:49:22.410 --> 01:49:25.410
I don't know.
He seems real calm about it.
I mean,
look at that.
He's just smoking.

1699
01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:30.090
Is Smoking the smoking guys the best part?
That's the funniest part of the video.

1700
01:49:30.091 --> 01:49:33.420
Like he's just the screen.
The woman's,
I don't like the screen.

1701
01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:37.620
I like this guy's nonchalant cigarettes.
She's definitely overreacting.

1702
01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:39.970
Okeydokey guys.
She is.

1703
01:49:41.490 --> 01:49:45.080
She knows there's a camera on the ceiling and she was like,
oh,

1704
01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:48.160
they'll do it up for the camera.
Yeah,
I where does it,
how does she

1705
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:51.400
<v 8>end up guys?
She's in the shadow back there.
They don't care.
Yeah.</v>

1706
01:49:51.401 --> 01:49:55.170
They don't care what the thing I,
my experience in that guy doesn't carry either.

1707
01:49:55.180 --> 01:49:59.530
By the way.
[inaudible] with bullets that doesn't give a fuck.
And I went,
oh,

1708
01:49:59.590 --> 01:50:00.423
videos.

1709
01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:05.450
<v 7>Rarely.
People don't get hurt that bad.
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.</v>

1710
01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:10.440
You got like you watched 10 bull videos,

1711
01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:13.170
people getting hit.
Nine times out of 10 they walk.

1712
01:50:13.410 --> 01:50:15.180
<v 8>Yeah.
This lady could still breathe on her own.</v>

1713
01:50:15.181 --> 01:50:18.660
That's cause you're watching the Rodeo.
You're not watching like,

1714
01:50:19.140 --> 01:50:22.710
you know like Spanish bull running.
Yeah.

1715
01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:24.473
<v 15>Get gored.</v>

1716
01:50:26.090 --> 01:50:31.090
<v 8>She still seems to be her to her lungs are intact and screaming.</v>

1717
01:50:31.131 --> 01:50:35.630
She is fun.
Okay,
look who's laughing now.
So I go late joining you guys.

1718
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:41.470
That was unexpected.
I was like,
Oh that was 2019 we don't have is a brace.

1719
01:50:41.471 --> 01:50:44.710
It's pretty rare.
We don't even to know.
These guys both voted hilarious.
Oh Gosh.

1720
01:50:44.711 --> 01:50:47.150
He's not even fully recovered yet,
guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1721
01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:51.950
I'm going to go horrible on the go.
Okay.
Not Interested.
All right.

1722
01:50:52.070 --> 01:50:55.970
Wait a bum everybody out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Can we see another one?

1723
01:50:55.971 --> 01:51:00.200
This is another one of the bummer.
Definitely.
Let's see what she is.

1724
01:51:00.201 --> 01:51:01.130
This one aisle?

1725
01:51:01.460 --> 01:51:02.293
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1726
01:51:10.510 --> 01:51:11.343
Hey,

1727
01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:17.440
<v 8>this is like,
this is like the winemaking lady.</v>

1728
01:51:18.750 --> 01:51:20.650
It was a fun one.
Here's the thing,

1729
01:51:20.690 --> 01:51:24.910
he got the wind knocked out of getting that when knocked out noise.

1730
01:51:24.911 --> 01:51:29.500
Here's my theory.
It's,
it's when you don't see anything grow tea.

1731
01:51:29.590 --> 01:51:33.320
In other words,
someone got hurt,
but you're not seeing like actual,
yeah.

1732
01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:36.370
You know the,
the injury,
right?
Yeah.
And then a noise,

1733
01:51:36.970 --> 01:51:41.660
like a grunt or a scream.
The scream.
Fun as the funny guy.
The screams.
Yeah.

1734
01:51:41.670 --> 01:51:45.940
There was a delay.
You can't see that his knee is torn to shreds.
Right.

1735
01:51:46.530 --> 01:51:51.100
He has no exposed bone.
Yeah.

1736
01:51:52.930 --> 01:51:56.230
Is this another angle?
This is a different one.
Video.
Different guy.
Different guy.

1737
01:51:56.231 --> 01:51:57.110
Yeah.
Oh No.

1738
01:51:59.860 --> 01:52:00.693
<v 16>Oh,</v>

1739
01:52:07.970 --> 01:52:12.330
<v 7>he's dead.
He died.
The reason I have Travis hilarious,</v>

1740
01:52:12.350 --> 01:52:16.340
his second one.
Horrible.
I have trouble.
Nothing.
Just Blah.

1741
01:52:16.820 --> 01:52:20.900
Anytime.
I Dunno.
I like,
I'm tall,
I got back problems.

1742
01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:24.550
I'm constantly thinking about not getting hurt.
Yeah.

1743
01:52:24.620 --> 01:52:29.180
I think 80% of my mental energy at this point in my life is devoted to not

1744
01:52:29.181 --> 01:52:31.850
getting hurt.
Moving.
Well moving.
Yeah.

1745
01:52:32.210 --> 01:52:36.230
And so when I see that situation and the ice and the snow,

1746
01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:37.753
I'm just a,

1747
01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:42.100
it's difficult for me to watch about what I w w how I would react.
Yeah.

1748
01:52:42.230 --> 01:52:46.250
You know why I like that video.
I don't like people that wear shorts

1749
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:51.140
<v 8>in the snow.
They dessert.
Yes.
God's punishing them for,</v>

1750
01:52:51.141 --> 01:52:56.090
um,
the psycho.
Okay.
I agree with your pants.

1751
01:52:56.091 --> 01:52:59.030
It's freezing outside.
What's wrong with pants snowing?

1752
01:52:59.031 --> 01:53:00.650
This is the video that started at all

1753
01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:04.170
<v 6>this one.
Oh No.
Oh,
no.</v>

1754
01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:06.633
Dope.

1755
01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:14.653
Okay.

1756
01:53:19.870 --> 01:53:24.360
Ah,
okay.

1757
01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:36.670
Yeah.
Oh,

1758
01:53:44.150 --> 01:53:44.983
Oh God

1759
01:53:45.530 --> 01:53:49.970
<v 8>lost both at the knees amputated at the knees.
Oh God,
no,
he's fine.
He's fine.</v>

1760
01:53:50.030 --> 01:53:52.970
He really is.
They followed it up.
It was a big story in Taiwan.
Yeah.
See,

1761
01:53:52.971 --> 01:53:56.240
here's the deal.
He's okay.
Was he driving that thing remotely?

1762
01:53:56.300 --> 01:54:01.190
It looked like he was,
he had a remote control.
Oh,
that's interesting.

1763
01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:02.240
That's the first thing that I thought

1764
01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:09.540
if I was watching that live,
I would react differently.

1765
01:54:09.541 --> 01:54:12.050
There's something about the fact that it's been captured and packaged.

1766
01:54:12.110 --> 01:54:16.280
That's true.
It makes me think that whatever,
no lie,
this Guy Rick Out,

1767
01:54:16.340 --> 01:54:18.980
you would freak it.
Yeah.
Right.
Of course.
Yeah.
I mean,
you laugh,

1768
01:54:18.981 --> 01:54:20.360
but then you'd be like,
I got to help them out.
You know,

1769
01:54:20.510 --> 01:54:23.900
I would probably just walk over very slowly and then kind of stare down at him,

1770
01:54:24.530 --> 01:54:26.210
not unlike that guy.
Right.
Yeah.

1771
01:54:26.630 --> 01:54:31.160
That was a crazy reaction rate that just like a slow,
and again,

1772
01:54:31.170 --> 01:54:34.930
even moseyed over.
It's like a guy with the cigarettes brothers,
right?
Yeah.

1773
01:54:34.990 --> 01:54:36.790
I would have these,
what I would have walked over to the driver,

1774
01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:38.060
put my armor like,
you gotta get the fuck out.

1775
01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:41.150
<v 6>The guy on the ground.</v>

1776
01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:50.150
<v 8>This screams just didn't stop enough for a lot to allow me to laugh.
There was,</v>

1777
01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:52.170
yeah,
there was no punchline.

1778
01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:56.920
Now the lack of the value of human life is interesting.
Like,
what do you mean?

1779
01:54:56.921 --> 01:55:01.340
The guy who walks around and he's like hair.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Stone faced.
Hmm.
Yeah.

1780
01:55:01.730 --> 01:55:05.100
That was crazy scene.
Where was that?
Where was that?
Um,

1781
01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:09.710
bump on the road like,
yeah,
I was a person.
Oh,
there's my ranch.

1782
01:55:09.711 --> 01:55:14.030
Who doesn't care?
Cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh,

1783
01:55:14.031 --> 01:55:15.220
now they're showing us another one.

1784
01:55:16.890 --> 01:55:19.200
<v 6>Better do
something.</v>

1785
01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:27.050
What?
Oh Gosh.
Ah,

1786
01:55:30.990 --> 01:55:34.270
fuck it.
I got her to,

1787
01:55:35.210 --> 01:55:37.760
Oh God.
The military is wow.

1788
01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:44.850
<v 8>Oh Gosh.
Well you're the psycho laugh.
I better do something.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1789
01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:49.790
Link was affected by that one.
I mean he knew he was coming down too fast.
Yeah.

1790
01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:52.000
Yeah.
I think he knew something was wrong with the pair of shoes.

1791
01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:56.220
The better do something.
I can't,
I never pinpointed what the something was.

1792
01:55:56.280 --> 01:55:58.060
I Dunno what you could do.
I think think he does hit,

1793
01:55:58.170 --> 01:55:59.700
<v 7>I think right before you hit the ground you'd jump</v>

1794
01:56:03.570 --> 01:56:05.740
like an appalling elevator.
Ah,

1795
01:56:06.270 --> 01:56:11.270
you're supposed to lay flat right in a fallen elevator following fall falling.

1796
01:56:11.851 --> 01:56:14.880
You spread yourself as wide as you can.

1797
01:56:14.881 --> 01:56:19.230
Laying down on the ground to distribute the load.
Oh you don't stand,

1798
01:56:19.530 --> 01:56:22.870
you definitely don't jump cause I don't want to start going to work stand cause

1799
01:56:22.871 --> 01:56:24.030
it'll compress your spine.

1800
01:56:25.290 --> 01:56:29.790
You get on your back and you spread out.
You're probably going to die anyway.

1801
01:56:30.330 --> 01:56:31.790
It's done.
This is the,

1802
01:56:32.730 --> 01:56:37.710
I mean if you want to make sure that you're going to die then just do a

1803
01:56:37.711 --> 01:56:38.544
handstand.

1804
01:56:41.300 --> 01:56:42.770
<v 8>Does this mean that you,
like,</v>

1805
01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:47.900
do you go on Reddit and look at all the twisted twisted stuff?
No,
no,
not at all.

1806
01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:51.620
Okay.
So you have a line.
Oh yeah.
I don't,
I don't search for any of this.

1807
01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:56.330
So there was a laugh at it when it's presented to you?
I think the,

1808
01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:57.590
the,
the,

1809
01:56:58.370 --> 01:57:02.630
the points that I pointed out are what I've discovered.
I can,

1810
01:57:02.631 --> 01:57:04.940
like if I see someone and you're like,

1811
01:57:04.970 --> 01:57:09.020
check this out and this dude's head cracks open like funny to me that that's not

1812
01:57:09.021 --> 01:57:12.780
good.
I do think there's something about not seeing any gore.
Yeah.

1813
01:57:12.950 --> 01:57:15.860
And hearing yells that does

1814
01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:19.990
<v 7>bring that Tom Likes the screaming sounds Assaf frame.</v>

1815
01:57:23.570 --> 01:57:28.380
I get it.
I'm telling you,
cause there's that 50,
50,

1816
01:57:28.410 --> 01:57:33.090
a reddit thread where it's like,
I don't go on any of that shit.
Is this a,

1817
01:57:33.660 --> 01:57:37.830
you know,
a kid eating an ice cream or is it,
you know,

1818
01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:43.210
uh,
a monkey getting run over like,
oh yeah.
And I,

1819
01:57:43.250 --> 01:57:46.770
and I don't do,
I don't play that game.
How do you even know about it?

1820
01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:51.780
Because are the GMM crew made us play,
uh,
like a much,
Oh,

1821
01:57:51.781 --> 01:57:53.520
a tame version of that on the show,

1822
01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:56.760
but that sort of like a reddit thread and he's either going to be something

1823
01:57:56.761 --> 01:57:58.200
really pleasant or really

1824
01:57:58.860 --> 01:58:03.630
<v 8>I've discovered that as,
as much as I laugh at some of this stuff I don't have,</v>

1825
01:58:03.690 --> 01:58:08.690
I don't have it in me to watch actual real physical violence or really go,

1826
01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:13.370
I can't,
I can't,
I don't like it.
Right.
But I,
I,

1827
01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:18.520
I actually feel like I understand that this realm that,

1828
01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:23.340
that we're operating in here,
there's like,
um,
to me I think there's both.

1829
01:58:23.370 --> 01:58:25.260
It's not,
you can,
I can be,

1830
01:58:25.261 --> 01:58:29.100
I can find parts of it funny and I get the pump parts of it horrendous.

1831
01:58:29.101 --> 01:58:31.010
So I think that's the track,
you know,
it's like,
well,

1832
01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:34.380
it's supposed to be on the line,
most of it,
you know,
and that's,

1833
01:58:34.410 --> 01:58:38.790
that's what I think a lot of people,
they're like this day and age,

1834
01:58:38.791 --> 01:58:41.650
you can't find things funny.
You have to,
you have to make a decision.

1835
01:58:41.651 --> 01:58:42.070
You're either

1836
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:44.020
<v 9>going to find something funny or you're going to,</v>

1837
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:47.750
or you're going to be outraged about something.
And it's like,
I,
I,

1838
01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:49.990
I think both can be true.

1839
01:58:49.991 --> 01:58:52.720
And then you just got to figure out who you trust and let them know that you

1840
01:58:52.721 --> 01:58:53.554
find you're funny.

1841
01:58:53.650 --> 01:58:56.140
<v 8>That's right.
That's true.
That's a big part.
I mean,</v>

1842
01:58:56.200 --> 01:59:00.550
someone's not the one that talked to,
but yeah,
I tend to just,

1843
01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:01.750
just about the violence

1844
01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:05.160
<v 9>videos,
whatever.
Now when it comes to violence,</v>

1845
01:59:05.161 --> 01:59:09.090
but when it comes to certain types of comedy,
I don't have a specific example,

1846
01:59:09.091 --> 01:59:13.440
but like,
I just think you can be,
again,

1847
01:59:13.441 --> 01:59:15.180
you can find something funny and then you can,

1848
01:59:16.510 --> 01:59:19.600
<v 0>do you ever go on?
He fucked?
No.
What is that?
Oh No,</v>

1849
01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:25.930
it's a website or what's that?
E F you,
Katie.

1850
01:59:26.060 --> 01:59:30.140
<v 8>Hi.
You guys stepped into the devil's layer.
What is,
okay,</v>

1851
01:59:30.141 --> 01:59:31.360
so it's a guy

1852
01:59:31.460 --> 01:59:36.410
<v 0>who,
he is a curator of types that he's actually a talented editor.</v>

1853
01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:41.030
I'll give him that.
Okay.
So heal,
it'll heal.
It stays.
It's a lot of adult,

1854
01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:45.050
um,
like x rated stuff.
Okay.
But it'll either,
it's,

1855
01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:48.440
it falls into different categories within that umbrella.

1856
01:59:48.770 --> 01:59:51.870
So some of it will be like big tent.
This is absurd.
Big Tank.

1857
01:59:51.871 --> 01:59:56.240
Some of it will be like actual,
um,
you know,

1858
01:59:56.570 --> 01:59:58.520
some girl being like,
oh my,
my,

1859
01:59:58.940 --> 02:00:03.940
my anal prolapse keeps giving me problems when I'm shooting scenes and it's like

1860
02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:06.840
a ridiculous thing like that.

1861
02:00:06.841 --> 02:00:10.430
And like I'm an lol genre and then there's like blooper stuff.

1862
02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:13.500
Then there's horrendous and stuff like stuff where

1863
02:00:13.890 --> 02:00:17.450
<v 8>don't say it.
It's hard.
Yeah.
It's hard to watch.
Don't say it hard to watch.</v>

1864
02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:19.940
You guys aren't into that stuff.
No,
no,
no.
You know what I'm saying?

1865
02:00:19.941 --> 02:00:24.820
You should check it out.
I mean,
just
to see what time.

1866
02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:27.530
Sometimes some,
some videos or just people crying.

1867
02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:32.030
Guys,
what's it like to be normal?

1868
02:00:32.090 --> 02:00:37.090
What's it like to not talk about farts all day or should hang out later?

1869
02:00:37.221 --> 02:00:41.960
I just have,
do you ever just need to call me?
Oh wait.
Do you have any,
so you've,

1870
02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:44.930
you've been here on the show now,
like do you have any,

1871
02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:48.260
like you guys are the youtube gods.
What's your advice for us?
I mean,

1872
02:00:48.261 --> 02:00:50.300
do we keep the Fart Mike?
Yeah,

1873
02:00:50.301 --> 02:00:53.870
you definitely should keep the farm like any other,
like any advice for us,

1874
02:00:57.590 --> 02:01:02.120
<v 0>don't I,
you know,
don't try any harder than you currently are.
Okay.
We don't,</v>

1875
02:01:02.420 --> 02:01:06.500
we don't need any competition.
There's,
there's a lot of,
uh,
um,

1876
02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:11.300
you know,
how hard do you perceive that they're trying?
How many,

1877
02:01:11.810 --> 02:01:12.850
how many,
um,

1878
02:01:12.980 --> 02:01:16.970
hours of video are uploaded every second or something and it's increasing every

1879
02:01:16.971 --> 02:01:20.510
single day.
Damn.
You can do it.
You're doing your,
uh,
your show every day.

1880
02:01:21.020 --> 02:01:22.680
Is it five days a week is five days a week?

1881
02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:26.600
Friday we have like a recap show on and how long does that show?

1882
02:01:26.660 --> 02:01:31.190
The Monday through Friday.
10 to 15 minutes.
Oh,
okay.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1883
02:01:31.830 --> 02:01:32.410
Um,

1884
02:01:32.410 --> 02:01:34.210
<v 9>and we just eat a lot of stuff.
I mean,
it's like,</v>

1885
02:01:34.900 --> 02:01:38.050
that's not what the show is intended to be.

1886
02:01:38.051 --> 02:01:40.460
It's supposed to be like a creative expression of our,

1887
02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:43.760
the conversational nature of our friendship.
But yeah,

1888
02:01:43.761 --> 02:01:47.570
we just eat a lot of variously prepared animal testing.

1889
02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:51.530
<v 7>All right.
In a lot of us know what happened.
We got to step into this space.</v>

1890
02:01:51.550 --> 02:01:56.140
I don't know what happened.
That's my advice.
Unilock about balls.

1891
02:01:56.200 --> 02:02:00.460
Oh yeah.
Do you talk about browning?
You guys eat,
but what about

1892
02:02:02.260 --> 02:02:05.020
all the chocolate that comes out of the backside?
Oh,
well yeah,

1893
02:02:05.021 --> 02:02:09.430
let's talk about that.
Does it,
does eating crazy food make crazy browns?
No.

1894
02:02:09.850 --> 02:02:12.910
Only if only when you do like the hottest pepper in the world,

1895
02:02:12.911 --> 02:02:16.500
which we've done it two different times when it was the hardest times.
Well,

1896
02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:20.410
when keep releasing new ones,
we're not doing the latest one,

1897
02:02:20.411 --> 02:02:24.400
which is like pepper x or sledding.
How horrible is that experience?
Well,

1898
02:02:24.430 --> 02:02:29.020
interestingly,
the second hottest pepper in the top five,
I don't know what it is.

1899
02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:34.300
Not like we said,
we did a straight up,
uh,
uh,

1900
02:02:35.140 --> 02:02:36.760
ghost pepper when it was the hottest one.

1901
02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:39.250
Horrible experience while it was happening.

1902
02:02:39.340 --> 02:02:43.510
Horrible experience for like the next 12 hours or so,
12 hours link link.

1903
02:02:43.511 --> 02:02:47.620
He was like,
really?
Like 12 hours later he was like still at ended up and reaper.

1904
02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:52.200
<v 9>So the second one we did the Carolina reaper was the world's hottest pepper.</v>

1905
02:02:52.201 --> 02:02:56.640
And we said,
okay,
we're going to set a timer.
I mean all this is on camera.

1906
02:02:56.641 --> 02:02:59.940
So we wanted to make sure that the whole experience was captured.

1907
02:02:59.941 --> 02:03:01.170
So we didn't add anything out.
And we said,

1908
02:03:01.171 --> 02:03:02.460
we're going to set a timer for 10 minutes,

1909
02:03:02.461 --> 02:03:07.461
we're going to eat the whole pepper and then we're not going to consume

1910
02:03:07.531 --> 02:03:08.221
anything.
No,

1911
02:03:08.221 --> 02:03:11.790
I going to drink or eat anything else and we're just going to ride it out.

1912
02:03:12.540 --> 02:03:14.370
And so,
uh,

1913
02:03:14.580 --> 02:03:17.550
Rhett had this impulse to start destroying the set,

1914
02:03:17.610 --> 02:03:22.410
like just became physically violent.
It was very funny.
And um,
it was,

1915
02:03:23.730 --> 02:03:27.590
you can see the fear in our eyes at sir.
At a certain point we,

1916
02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:31.050
I mean we took the precautions like we had gloves and you know,

1917
02:03:31.051 --> 02:03:33.060
cause you don't want to touch your eyes or anything like that.

1918
02:03:33.060 --> 02:03:38.060
But we were still crying and I haven't watched it back cause I just don't.

1919
02:03:38.340 --> 02:03:42.270
And you were miserable clips of it for 12 hours.
Well on and off,

1920
02:03:42.271 --> 02:03:46.020
it's like something shifts and hours,
you know.

1921
02:03:46.090 --> 02:03:49.710
Did you eat before you had experience goes away?
Well I,

1922
02:03:49.860 --> 02:03:53.160
so I was a little better prepared.
I had a bunch of bananas and like some bread,

1923
02:03:53.730 --> 02:03:55.980
but I don't love,
but man,
he didn't go as far.

1924
02:03:56.040 --> 02:03:59.220
So what happens on the way out though?
Is it that all miserable again?

1925
02:03:59.740 --> 02:04:03.730
The thing is at least twice.
Yeah,
11 o'clock that we,
we've filmed that morning,

1926
02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:08.040
11 o'clock that night we were filming something else and in between takes I

1927
02:04:08.041 --> 02:04:11.070
would lay down in the fetal position and it,
you know,

1928
02:04:11.460 --> 02:04:16.460
I think the way my stomach works is that it does like a major turn every,

1929
02:04:17.460 --> 02:04:18.360
it's not constant,

1930
02:04:18.361 --> 02:04:22.590
but like I could tell that something happened to every 10 or 15 minutes.

1931
02:04:22.620 --> 02:04:26.670
That will be like everything got turned over and it exposed all this heat to

1932
02:04:26.671 --> 02:04:30.120
Moses [inaudible] your system that was getting exposed to the oil that pepper

1933
02:04:30.121 --> 02:04:34.520
oil is very,
it was very bad.
Terrible.
And um,
know,
and then when it,

1934
02:04:34.740 --> 02:04:37.490
I mean all the way out,
it's like it's hot,
hot

1935
02:04:38.430 --> 02:04:40.650
<v 7>and then it,
and then it starts,</v>

1936
02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:42.900
it's the same thing that happens when it's going down.
It's like,

1937
02:04:44.250 --> 02:04:45.480
am I going to be able to take this?

1938
02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:49.920
And you start questioning if you're getting like the worst part when it was

1939
02:04:49.921 --> 02:04:54.070
going down was my throat and I thought it could kill you.
Probably.
Am I going to,

1940
02:04:54.540 --> 02:04:56.910
am I going to have to tap out?
Are we going to have to like call somebody?

1941
02:04:56.911 --> 02:04:59.670
Cause we didn't,
this is before we had like a medic.
We have a medic.

1942
02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:03.510
Well what we don't,
we,
we currently don't have a medic.
What happened to them?

1943
02:05:03.550 --> 02:05:07.560
We had a medic medic for a while.
We should realize we do have one all the time.

1944
02:05:07.590 --> 02:05:11.070
Oh.
But now we've got a lot of,
a lot of our employees are like a CPR training.

1945
02:05:11.071 --> 02:05:15.000
You had a medic for whatever you were doing.
We had,
she had a medic for the show.

1946
02:05:15.060 --> 02:05:15.893
Yeah.

1947
02:05:16.070 --> 02:05:21.070
Youtube funded our show a few seasons back and we made it even longer.

1948
02:05:21.511 --> 02:05:25.350
So instead of 15 minutes,
it was a half hour every day.
We did that for a stint.

1949
02:05:25.351 --> 02:05:30.260
And because as part of their funding of it,
there was a medic on set.
Right.

1950
02:05:30.270 --> 02:05:33.890
And then when that funny funding went away,
we went back to 15 minutes.
Uh,

1951
02:05:34.150 --> 02:05:36.000
the medic also went away.
That's true.

1952
02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:40.860
And now we're realizing now that the question you have is like,

1953
02:05:41.250 --> 02:05:43.210
am I going to be one of those people that has the,

1954
02:05:43.211 --> 02:05:44.580
has to go to the hospital because of this?

1955
02:05:45.810 --> 02:05:49.170
And then it kind of feels the same way on the way out,

1956
02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:53.220
but not like I'm going to have to go to the hospital but like can I,

1957
02:05:53.221 --> 02:05:55.350
can I do this?
And it happened and then it happened for me.

1958
02:05:55.350 --> 02:05:56.520
It usually happens twice.

1959
02:05:56.850 --> 02:05:59.970
It was just funny because we were really depends on your anal prolapse or

1960
02:05:59.971 --> 02:06:02.370
whatever though.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll send you the link to that.
Well again,

1961
02:06:02.430 --> 02:06:05.950
you got to see that way.
We ate the world's,
how does curry,

1962
02:06:06.970 --> 02:06:11.160
so what are you guys doing?
So Sean Evans,
the hot ones,

1963
02:06:11.490 --> 02:06:14.810
we use your last week.
So we,
the first time we were on,

1964
02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:16.500
we were on hot ones like last year,

1965
02:06:16.501 --> 02:06:19.050
but the year before that we went to New York and they were doing,

1966
02:06:19.051 --> 02:06:20.070
they were on break for the season.

1967
02:06:20.071 --> 02:06:23.490
So he's doing these like little one off videos and we went to,
he's the best man.

1968
02:06:23.590 --> 02:06:27.300
It's good guy,
a brick lane,
I think curry in New York,

1969
02:06:27.301 --> 02:06:30.240
which is named after brick lane in London,
which has got like the ball,

1970
02:06:30.241 --> 02:06:34.620
the curry places.
Anyway,
the guys who make the curry there wear gas masks,

1971
02:06:34.621 --> 02:06:35.190
water making.

1972
02:06:35.190 --> 02:06:39.000
This one a lot is curry in the world and we played a game where you got it
wrong.

1973
02:06:39.001 --> 02:06:42.840
He had to take a bite of this curry.
That was bad.
I got to two wrong.

1974
02:06:43.020 --> 02:06:44.840
You got four wrong.
Yeah,
but for some reason,

1975
02:06:44.841 --> 02:06:48.390
so we were out to dinner with our wives that night,

1976
02:06:48.870 --> 02:06:51.110
maybe four hours later.
And uh,

1977
02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:56.700
I ended up Rhett left to table giving the table and he never,

1978
02:06:56.760 --> 02:07:00.330
and I was like,
I realize it's like,
oh,
now we're eating dessert and stuff.

1979
02:07:00.331 --> 02:07:01.960
And he never came back.
And it was like,

1980
02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:06.590
and then he comes back to the table and he was like,
he looked,

1981
02:07:06.630 --> 02:07:09.840
he looked hard when he's walking funny.
Yeah.
And he was like,

1982
02:07:10.710 --> 02:07:13.740
he looked at me and he just said,
you're going to have a rough night.

1983
02:07:14.610 --> 02:07:15.990
He knew it just hadn't hit me yet.

1984
02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:20.040
I'm assuming it's not solid at that point either.
Right?

1985
02:07:21.450 --> 02:07:23.760
You want it to just write out,
but it doesn't,

1986
02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:27.480
we don't do that anymore.

1987
02:07:28.090 --> 02:07:30.630
So we've kind of gotten to the place where it's like eat.

1988
02:07:30.631 --> 02:07:35.100
Cause the last time we did a hot thing,
it was a charity thing and uh,

1989
02:07:35.110 --> 02:07:36.130
I eat a Trinidad

1990
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:39.640
<v 10>Scorpion pepper and it was one of the,
I got,</v>

1991
02:07:39.670 --> 02:07:42.520
it got so bad that I was no longer entertaining.
You know,

1992
02:07:42.521 --> 02:07:43.800
it's like a place where I was just,

1993
02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:47.380
I was mad that we had made the decision to do it.
And at that point I was like,

1994
02:07:47.710 --> 02:07:50.980
I can't,
there's no bit here.
I can't find a way to make this funny.

1995
02:07:51.370 --> 02:07:54.430
And it wasn't hurting me.
Is,
is bad.
I mean,
you get a different pepper.

1996
02:07:54.431 --> 02:07:57.250
You never know.
It was horrible.
So we did,
I saw,
I was like,

1997
02:07:57.260 --> 02:08:00.880
I like to think that I was still entertaining.
But you were,
you were very angry,

1998
02:08:01.210 --> 02:08:02.980
which was funny.
And the uh,

1999
02:08:03.130 --> 02:08:06.850
the hottest one in the world before the a Carolina reaper,
Carolina reapers,

2000
02:08:06.851 --> 02:08:10.120
like 2 million Scoville units.
The pepper acts was same guy.

2001
02:08:10.121 --> 02:08:14.380
There's some guy in North Carolina,
ed,
something crazy ed or something like that.

2002
02:08:14.381 --> 02:08:16.870
And he,
man,
he breeds crossbreeds these peppers.

2003
02:08:16.890 --> 02:08:17.940
<v 1>Where is he?
He's like in the mountains.</v>

2004
02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:21.830
What the hub is actually eating these well these pepper head people,
right?

2005
02:08:21.890 --> 02:08:22.723
I guess.

2006
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:23.730
<v 10>And He,</v>

2007
02:08:23.750 --> 02:08:28.340
this new one pepper eggs is like 3 million Scoville units in it that come on
man.

2008
02:08:28.490 --> 02:08:32.500
No,
that's like,
that's like taking like bear spray and like spraying it.

2009
02:08:32.850 --> 02:08:35.700
<v 1>Yeah,
that's what I mean.
Like who's eating these with their dinner?</v>

2010
02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:40.100
I mean is that,
it's just all,
so are you guys in a day?

2011
02:08:40.180 --> 02:08:44.610
Are you okay?
You got the books coming out,
the novel,
you're touring,

2012
02:08:44.700 --> 02:08:48.690
doing live shows were both two in Nashville.
Yeah.
You,
uh,
you have the,

2013
02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:52.530
the show five days a week and you're also developing,

2014
02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:55.260
do you also continually,
uh,

2015
02:08:55.470 --> 02:08:59.280
write and shoot like just a sketch type videos too?

2016
02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:01.110
<v 10>We're,
so we're taking all those,</v>

2017
02:09:01.710 --> 02:09:06.710
that whole part of our like creative brain is just into development right now.

2018
02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:09.930
There's no way.
We just got too many things going on.

2019
02:09:09.931 --> 02:09:14.610
We can't try that on youtube and also try to make it happen elsewhere.

2020
02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:17.040
So cause this already too,
too much.

2021
02:09:17.140 --> 02:09:20.670
<v 1>Yeah,
that's a lot as it is.
Speaking of Browns,
I have a,</v>

2022
02:09:20.671 --> 02:09:22.260
would you rather for you guys,

2023
02:09:22.290 --> 02:09:26.340
it's kind of a game we like to play on the show being that you're foodies and

2024
02:09:26.341 --> 02:09:27.870
brownies.
Here we go.

2025
02:09:28.770 --> 02:09:33.770
Would you rather for one year all you can eat is taco bell.

2026
02:09:35.100 --> 02:09:37.260
Now by this I mean three meals a day,

2027
02:09:37.530 --> 02:09:40.500
any items on the menu you can mix and match.

2028
02:09:40.501 --> 02:09:44.900
You can take tacos apart and make them in the Omelet.
Whatever the heck right.

2029
02:09:44.930 --> 02:09:46.920
For one year.
Well,
you don't have eggs,

2030
02:09:46.921 --> 02:09:51.320
you can't make it enough breakfast items now at breakfast.
Um,

2031
02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:56.210
okay.
Josh Potter I believe eats there.
Breakfast.
Alright.
Alright.
Um,

2032
02:09:56.640 --> 02:10:00.870
you,
like I said,
you can mix and match,
but it's three meals a day at Taco bell.

2033
02:10:01.290 --> 02:10:05.580
Hmm.
Any of easy browns.
I'm talking fours and fives.

2034
02:10:05.581 --> 02:10:09.780
Gliders.
Easy.
Like you're healthy.
You're,
they're healthy rounds.

2035
02:10:10.470 --> 02:10:12.290
I didn't know what you meant when you said sevens,

2036
02:10:12.300 --> 02:10:16.230
but you have a really sloppy is the Bristol stool chart.
Medical Chart.

2037
02:10:16.231 --> 02:10:19.880
Medical Chart.
So a one is like a rock and a sevens.

2038
02:10:19.890 --> 02:10:24.270
Just water like the valleys,
threes and fours.
Oh,
so it's a scale of one to seven.

2039
02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:28.730
How much?
Fours and fives I am I five again,
kind of loose.
Yeah,

2040
02:10:28.770 --> 02:10:32.040
you're five.
Easy peasy,
right?

2041
02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:34.410
So you're healthy form.

2042
02:10:34.730 --> 02:10:38.060
<v 7>You may eat anything you want for an entire year,</v>

2043
02:10:38.750 --> 02:10:42.650
but every brown,
it's a disaster.
It's like your pepper Brown.

2044
02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:46.520
It's like what you had the day of the curry.
That's every day.

2045
02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:50.630
That's what you're doing.
But you can,
you want,

2046
02:10:51.500 --> 02:10:55.730
you know the,
the bell has the reputation of,
of just tearing you up.

2047
02:10:56.270 --> 02:10:58.790
That's what makes it a great.
Now would you rather,

2048
02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:06.170
but it seems obvious if you,
if you love Taco Bell,
I mean it's all,

2049
02:11:07.670 --> 02:11:10.820
you would choose that for a year.
You said you,

2050
02:11:10.821 --> 02:11:14.630
are you saying that that's who you are?
No,
I don't.

2051
02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:19.620
I don't hate Taco Bell,
which oftentimes I preferred it.

2052
02:11:19.730 --> 02:11:24.410
I refer to Taco Bell is potential spots or Taco bell.
And then I'm like,

2053
02:11:24.411 --> 02:11:27.920
that's true.
So I don't,
I don't hate it,
but I don't love it yet.

2054
02:11:27.921 --> 02:11:31.880
But I mean the needle could be moved in either direction.
Well,

2055
02:11:31.881 --> 02:11:34.370
just be careful if you choose a corporate sponsorship.

2056
02:11:34.490 --> 02:11:37.600
We had Mcdonald's sponsored this show and they gave,

2057
02:11:37.620 --> 02:11:42.620
they took their money back but plug cause but plug cause oh yeah.

2058
02:11:43.850 --> 02:11:47.810
It's a long story.
But um,
I would take the second scenario,

2059
02:11:47.811 --> 02:11:50.840
eat anything I want,
but den messy.
Brown's here's why.

2060
02:11:51.070 --> 02:11:52.790
Because I have a day at my house,

2061
02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:58.360
so do we the toto wash letter a proper be day.

2062
02:11:58.391 --> 02:12:01.580
Mine is not.
No,
cause you,
you've got the Todo,
you go.
No,

2063
02:12:01.581 --> 02:12:04.720
I was just the one that I just,
my,
my wife got expanders,
put it off.

2064
02:12:04.730 --> 02:12:09.640
It's not the whole toilet,
you know,
it's just the,
it's a washlet basically.
So,

2065
02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:11.890
and it's,
I don't know what brand it is,
but uh,

2066
02:12:12.230 --> 02:12:16.490
it's revolutionary as you already know.
And I would just be like,

2067
02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:18.680
I got to get one at work.
I got it.

2068
02:12:18.710 --> 02:12:21.940
I got to know if I feel like a real savage without it.
There's probably,

2069
02:12:22.220 --> 02:12:24.650
there should be like an APP.
Where's the nearest big day?

2070
02:12:25.940 --> 02:12:27.320
As long as I could wash it,

2071
02:12:27.470 --> 02:12:31.950
I would be willing to go through the hell that would be those.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,

2072
02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:36.830
how,
how,
this is a stupid question.
Gross.
Do you guys get on this show?

2073
02:12:39.570 --> 02:12:43.250
Like I haven't already figured that out.
I think,

2074
02:12:43.251 --> 02:12:46.640
I think you have figured it out and it's a lot grosser than this.

2075
02:12:47.550 --> 02:12:52.370
We've been taking it easy.
I need
to ask him private,

2076
02:12:52.371 --> 02:12:56.770
but I was asking it to you guys.
Um,
she doesn't eat my scrum.
Is that,

2077
02:12:58.600 --> 02:13:00.880
no,
it's about the,
it's about the be day.
So yeah.

2078
02:13:00.970 --> 02:13:05.630
I got the fancy schmancy new toilet that like,
y'all walk up to it and it,
it,

2079
02:13:05.870 --> 02:13:10.010
it opens,
beckons.
He doesn't speak,
but I mean,

2080
02:13:10.020 --> 02:13:12.110
it changes color.

2081
02:13:14.390 --> 02:13:18.330
It's not a Todo,
it's the,
it's an American standard,
but it's like,
okay,

2082
02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:22.780
maybe it's not as,
it's got all of that stuff,
but with the,

2083
02:13:22.890 --> 02:13:25.250
with the day stream,
there's like a,

2084
02:13:25.260 --> 02:13:28.590
there's an aggressive stream and then there's an aggressive Washington,

2085
02:13:28.610 --> 02:13:31.900
there's like a normal wash.
And then if you hit the button,
yeah,
yes,

2086
02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:36.840
<v 8>it'll,
it'll do like a one of these like oh,
massage pattern.</v>

2087
02:13:38.730 --> 02:13:43.340
A water wiping pattern.
Yup.
Wow.
But if you don't,
if you hit it,

2088
02:13:43.410 --> 02:13:46.110
if you hit the strong stream once,
it's going to just really hard.

2089
02:13:46.670 --> 02:13:49.950
It's going to really rock it.
I like to ride that and ride that.

2090
02:13:50.730 --> 02:13:55.290
You build up a tolerance.
You really will.
I'm at that point is if you,

2091
02:13:55.291 --> 02:13:59.220
if you line everything up properly,
it's an enema.
Oh Wow.

2092
02:13:59.250 --> 02:14:01.550
You can really let it,
it,

2093
02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:05.940
the water would have to be visually it looks like the top of red's head right

2094
02:14:05.941 --> 02:14:10.020
there.
Gnarly.
It's just hair.
It's just hair.
It's got a lot of work.

2095
02:14:10.670 --> 02:14:12.090
I'm just fucking fire hose that.

2096
02:14:12.140 --> 02:14:16.290
I'll let him run a full cycle goes off on its own and I think,
yeah,

2097
02:14:16.710 --> 02:14:18.870
I don't even check what's there.
I'm just saying I know it's a mess.

2098
02:14:18.871 --> 02:14:21.460
Just go the dryer.

2099
02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:25.560
But what am I trying to get to ask my question?
My question is,

2100
02:14:27.030 --> 02:14:30.450
okay,
you kind of answered it,
but can you,
you,
you can use it basically to like

2101
02:14:31.750 --> 02:14:36.730
get it in there.
I go in there,
it can go in there and like,
like an Enema,

2102
02:14:37.190 --> 02:14:40.780
I sometimes you won't show.
Now here's the thing,
you're,

2103
02:14:40.781 --> 02:14:45.630
you're be whole is a very theoretically tight hole.
Right?

2104
02:14:45.670 --> 02:14:47.500
You can loosen it.
You sure can,

2105
02:14:50.500 --> 02:14:52.960
do you,
but when you're fire hosing your bum,

2106
02:14:52.961 --> 02:14:57.130
do you find that the water goes inside your time at home?
Sometimes,
but you know,

2107
02:14:57.131 --> 02:15:00.190
you can,
you can,
you know,
you can maneuver and positioning yourself.

2108
02:15:00.370 --> 02:15:04.830
You can relax.
Yeah,
you can.
You can edge it all.
Colleen.

2109
02:15:04.990 --> 02:15:07.750
That's advanced.
That's right.
I don't do any of that.

2110
02:15:07.751 --> 02:15:09.040
That's like six to eight months in

2111
02:15:10.650 --> 02:15:13.890
advance then because I don't use the dryer that much though.
Like you know,

2112
02:15:13.900 --> 02:15:17.350
I don't drive.
No,
no.
So what are you saying?
What's your technique?

2113
02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:19.753
<v 6>You just</v>

2114
02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:20.790
<v 8>breath,</v>

2115
02:15:20.790 --> 02:15:25.790
relax and read and aim and just position yourself in the dental.

2116
02:15:26.580 --> 02:15:28.440
You get in kind of an internal,

2117
02:15:28.830 --> 02:15:33.540
an internal Raasch thorough in there for real.
You like to get in.

2118
02:15:33.570 --> 02:15:37.890
But do you do a double tap tap?
So it's one,
it's one.

2119
02:15:38.070 --> 02:15:43.020
Ours is the other way.
Double Tangle.
Is that light stream double up?

2120
02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:47.190
Powerstream no,
I've got four settings guys.
I've got two buttons.

2121
02:15:47.450 --> 02:15:50.460
Oh One is light.
One heavy,
and then if I hit the heavy one twice,

2122
02:15:50.461 --> 02:15:52.280
it's gonna like it's going to undulate.

2123
02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:56.380
We have an oscillating that's an oscillating feature.
I don't know.

2124
02:15:56.400 --> 02:15:59.210
There are different kinds of isolate it.
You know what I mean?
A it,

2125
02:15:59.230 --> 02:16:03.550
the stream has been goes like this.
The stream can't waggle what about the light?

2126
02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:07.370
The staccato string.
Oh,
you mean where he goes like two to,
I don't like that.

2127
02:16:07.630 --> 02:16:10.050
It doesn't move,
so nothing.

2128
02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:13.110
The stream bed pressure actually changes on it.
Right?

2129
02:16:13.290 --> 02:16:17.580
It goes on off on off like that.
Pulsating is the right word.

2130
02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:20.640
Pulsating.
No,
mine doesn't do that.
You need to step it up.

2131
02:16:20.641 --> 02:16:25.260
I've seen the subscriber list.
You need to step in right
now.

2132
02:16:25.261 --> 02:16:27.690
It's a warm still have a beside each other.
Yeah.

2133
02:16:27.691 --> 02:16:30.220
I'm not going to get rid of mine.
I'm just going to add

2134
02:16:30.260 --> 02:16:31.830
<v 9>and that's bawling,
right?
They got,</v>

2135
02:16:31.831 --> 02:16:35.770
I got two different companies and I will use them both at once.

2136
02:16:35.980 --> 02:16:38.220
I don't know how yet,
but you love it.

2137
02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:43.210
You don't do cold water always follows the same time.

2138
02:16:43.750 --> 02:16:46.510
I mean,
I think that's why I'm choosing Taco Bell.

2139
02:16:46.511 --> 02:16:51.340
Because even with all this apparat tie,
wow.

2140
02:16:51.910 --> 02:16:54.850
You don't want,
I mean you don't want to have,
you don't want to,

2141
02:16:54.910 --> 02:16:59.800
if you're constantly decimated down there,
then that's a,
that affects everything.

2142
02:17:00.820 --> 02:17:05.050
Just washing it off,
not going to make it better.
You're going to have diagnosable

2143
02:17:05.180 --> 02:17:10.100
<v 1>prop and well,
but if you're at the zoo or something like that too,
you know,</v>

2144
02:17:12.780 --> 02:17:16.550
that'd be trouble.
He,
you're saying the public dumps would be problematic.

2145
02:17:16.551 --> 02:17:18.460
You have to plan your day is,
I mean that's,

2146
02:17:18.540 --> 02:17:23.440
it affects you once you had the big day and then you're,

2147
02:17:23.500 --> 02:17:27.620
you're at a restaurant.
Yeah.
You know,
and you're like,
they don't,
they don't,

2148
02:17:27.690 --> 02:17:31.480
it's like an animal.
Like you can't,
you can't shut like an animal anymore.
Look,

2149
02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:32.540
consider this though.

2150
02:17:32.630 --> 02:17:36.590
As much as I love Taco Bell nutritionally,

2151
02:17:36.591 --> 02:17:41.591
you might be deprived after one year of eating it three times a day.

2152
02:17:42.260 --> 02:17:45.440
I don't know.
I think you'd probably get,
you know,
I think you'd probably get it.

2153
02:17:45.441 --> 02:17:49.160
I mean there's so many nutrients,
so many.
I mean,

2154
02:17:49.161 --> 02:17:51.770
it all tastes the same eventually,
essentially,

2155
02:17:51.771 --> 02:17:54.290
because it's just kind of rearranged in different ways.

2156
