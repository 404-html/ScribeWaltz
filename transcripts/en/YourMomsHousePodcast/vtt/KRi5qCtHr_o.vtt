1
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.290
Well.
Well,

2
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.383
Christina.

3
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.310
<v 2>Jean.
Really big episode today.
A lot to get into.</v>

4
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.480
I'm just overwhelmed with excitement that,

5
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.200
that it's about to go down.
You know what I mean?
Hmm.
You know what I'm saying?

6
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.360
You feel me?
You know I'm talking about.
All right,
let's get into this right here.

7
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.330
It's the Lambo episode.
It's going to be a good one guys.

8
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.560
Let's get into it,
right?

9
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.370
<v 0>Fuck them.
Fuck.
Good luck.
Okay.
That's,</v>

10
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.380
you're a hot black guy and you want to fuck me at 2195 if you want to move in,

11
00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:59.350
you come move here,
but you've got to fuck the money.
I need to be fought a lot,

12
00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:03.550
man.
Get rid free food.
Free ranch and everything else,

He has a deal,
man.

13
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.060
<v 2>Oh,

Don't loving.</v>

14
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.853
<v 1>Well,
we'll go.</v>

15
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.610
We'll go to your mom's house with Tone Circle Christina.

16
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.120
<v 2>Oh Man.
Good stuff.
Right?</v>

17
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.440
Men are the absolute piggy rest of the pigs.
It's really crazy.

18
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.570
The world is full of this and it's the guys only criterion.
Is that the,

19
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.610
the the guy be black?
Yeah.
Like not even like [inaudible] fuck me.
Yeah,

20
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.360
there you go.
But he'd like,
he'd be a psycho.
Yeah.

21
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.060
You could have all kinds of diseases.
He's like,
I don't care.

22
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.650
As long as you ain't gotta fuck me.
Yup.
Yeah.

23
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.680
Be Black and you gotta be willing to,
to fuck me.

24
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.310
I mean,
you'd think there'd be more of a filter on it.

25
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.993
That's it.

26
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.120
<v 0>What?
God's love the fuck and fuck.
Good.
Yeah.
If you're a hot black guy,</v>

27
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.780
you want to fuck me at 2195.
Jesus Christ.

28
00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:52.370
You got to fuck the irony.
I need to be fought a lot,
man.
You can get free food,

29
00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:54.830
free rent and everything else,
man.
He has a deal man.

30
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.860
<v 2>Part of it though,
does part of it as a woman make you realize just how,</v>

31
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.260
how much uh,

32
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.270
the men's sexual drive can just hold them hostage in some ways.

33
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.340
This is just like,
I see this as a guy,
I'm like,
ah,
no worries at right now.

34
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.470
Yeah.
And I know where he's at right now.
I don't fathom it.
Like,
I don't,

35
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:20.350
I personally,
and I'm sure there are women out there just in a bad place.

36
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:23.950
He shouldn't have posted this.
You know,
just conversation.
I just push through.

37
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.000
Yeah,
just released the demons get through it,
man.
I just don't,
I don't know.

38
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:32.180
I've never been here as a woman like this,
desperate for,
for that,
you know,

39
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.040
most,

40
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.300
most of the time I don't think we see a lot of women with these types of videos

41
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.020
and then from jail,
homeless or,

42
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.500
or thug want to comp then true man,

43
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.550
you frank and moving to fuck me.
Piss.
Somebody beat me home.

44
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:52.180
You know he's seen me when I come over today and try it out.
Try it out,
man.

45
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.040
Just try it out and he gave out his address.
Yeah.
He's like,
come find me.

46
00:03:57.041 --> 00:03:58.690
He said homeless Jesus.

47
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.580
But as long as you're black and homeless and out of prison and you can bring

48
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:10.750
your friend,
your friend can watch if you want to try it out today.

49
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.380
Right.
It's like,
it's like a free trial.
What's the Promo Code?

50
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.660
Cheese and tried out and I fuck a piss.
Let me try it out.
She might only as fuck,

51
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:27.220
man.
I'm looking at the hardcore guys want to do it and I want to deliver it.

52
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.880
I'm a hot salt.
My trash come down plus fuck wow.

53
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.850
Where is he?
Where is he?
Like where is that?
I mean blue band cut out the address.

54
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:41.000
He was very thoughtful.
Email,
homeless.

55
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.600
That's really crazy.
I mean emotionally.
Whereas this guy,
oh yeah,

56
00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:53.430
he's worse off than I thought and actually I think this is a,

57
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.790
this is dipping into drugs territory.
I don't think he's just backed up.

58
00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.810
I think he's a,

59
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.390
I think he's fueled by some Benadryl.
Yes.

60
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:10.070
Ap might be on the Benadryl,
like 10 20 Benadryl.

61
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.340
Jesus Christ,
that guy,
you want to get horny,
God smoke weed,

62
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:16.530
but you got to take away Benadryl.

63
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.030
Maybe this guy took too many Benadryl and there's no one,

64
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.590
no one to help him want to move in.

65
00:05:21.591 --> 00:05:25.900
You can move it a fuck the how much is that by the way?

66
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:27.610
There's a lot of people.
I think it would take this guy.

67
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.390
I think it's a good deal actually.
It's a great deal.

68
00:05:30.391 --> 00:05:33.370
If you are homeless and black,
it's a really good deal.

69
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.140
If you meet those two criteria,
that's yeah,
that's all he's asking.

70
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.840
He didn't even say like big dicks and that added jail.

71
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.460
His standards are incredibly low,
but he didn't even say,
you know,

72
00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:49.070
drug free disease,
free both Dick and ready to fuck.
Just a lack.

73
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.120
But here's the thing,
you can't just be black.

74
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.020
You also gotta be done a fuck this guy a lot.
A lot.

75
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.780
What is a lot do you think that's the thing?
That's a subjective term,

76
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.610
but I think he means it.
I don't think a lot.
Somebody really a lot,
you know,

77
00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:08.720
today.
Tomorrow I was like,
no,
no,
no.
I think this guy means like breakfast,

78
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:12.860
lunch and dinner or wants his rent.
He wants his food.
Damn.
How's the thing?

79
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:15.020
He'd get tired of you though.
I think he's,
you know,

80
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.780
he's the kind of guy that needs a new piece.
I think so.

81
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.440
What do you think his apartments like ty or super nice.
Huh?

82
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.710
Why do you think is so nice?
I mean,

83
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:27.050
he seems like he takes care of himself and he's like,

84
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.090
it takes care of that mustache.
That's what I'm saying.

85
00:06:29.091 --> 00:06:33.320
Like he likes his look to be fresh food or something on the outside of his
mouth.

86
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.960
You know something I'm looking for hard core guys.

87
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.770
That mustache is insane too.

88
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.580
God [inaudible] me.
Yeah,

89
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.880
there's definitely a different place than I thought he was.
I mean,
I understood,

90
00:06:46.881 --> 00:06:48.530
you know,
I mean,
I was telling her that exists too,

91
00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:52.510
but I thought he was just like,
I'm fucking fired up.
He's just like,
oh,

92
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.070
whatever age on me.
If you want
Jesus,

93
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.000
he wants to be abused.

94
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:03.350
This guy try it all out my bills and trot out and we're fucking pissed on me.

95
00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:05.840
Try it out.
It's applied only as fuck,
man.

96
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.160
I'm looking for hardcore guys want to do it and I want him to deliver it.

97
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.220
I'm a hot so my trash come down plus fuck.

98
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.110
Who is he posting this?
But I don't know.
Is this a craigslist video ad?

99
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.720
Those eyes.
Dot.
All the i's are terrifying.

100
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.080
I feel as though too,
you know,

101
00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:26.480
if you're putting an offer like that out into the world,

102
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.320
you might want to record yourself in a more flattering light.

103
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.350
Maybe turn the light on,
maybe sit up.

104
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.900
He's laying back camera over him.
Yeah,

105
00:07:38.901 --> 00:07:42.200
like maybe make yourself look more attractive.
Yeah,

106
00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:45.860
like some people will know how to look attractive on camera.

107
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:47.540
You know what I mean?
It's like lighting

108
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:55.930
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

109
00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.210
<v 2>not the dog.</v>

110
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.180
Can't ask rapper party on his dog.

111
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.970
Now the thing,
this is either animal abuse or the dog loves it.
That's the thing.

112
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.110
That's what I wanted to discuss.
We don't know.
We don't know.
First of all,

113
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:19.830
the dog doesn't know that his dad is a celebrity.

114
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.070
So Q star,
huge star talent.

115
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.050
I will say that he kept a healthy distance,
you know?

116
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.130
Hey receiving keep bands smother him too.
Like he wasn't like sitting on them.

117
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.830
Right.
It wasn't abusive and he gave him a nice pet at the end.

118
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.900
That's the king.
Right.
Then this falls into nasty or not.
It's exactly right.

119
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.570
Do you think it's an STD or not?
I mean,

120
00:08:42.571 --> 00:08:46.890
it depends on the dock because we've got two dogs.
One dog loves the farts.

121
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:52.200
One dog,
one dog.
You fart and his area and he gets up and he walks away.

122
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.010
Yeah,
that's easily.
Yeah,

123
00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.880
so make another song.

124
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.150
One dog's heaven is another dog's hell.
Now if you're kicking ass rubbers,

125
00:09:06.151 --> 00:09:06.780
dog,

126
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:11.280
you got to find this to be heaven because he farts 24 seven and there's a guy

127
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:15.870
that can fly
and the diag doesn't seem bothered by the Fart,

128
00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:20.070
so I'm going to go with and not nasty.
This ain't,
this ain't that nasty.

129
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.130
I don't think it's too nasty.
Now is this an old video?

130
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:24.780
Because he looks thinner here.

131
00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:30.180
I'm thinking this might be before he got the large.
He really blew up recently.

132
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:32.610
What else?
It says there's something else here.
Let's see.

133
00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:40.143
<v 4>Doug moved away.</v>

134
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:50.000
<v 2>The dog didn't move,
but he did turn his head slightly away.
What's Nastier?</v>

135
00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:54.640
When King asked rubber farts on his food and then eats it or how many farts on

136
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:59.600
near this dog?
It's the food.
The food is really gross.
It's nasty.
This is,

137
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:03.090
this is only nasty if you think farts are nasty,
but he's not like a,

138
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.680
I don't think he's abusing the dog and the dog's comfortable dog just moved to

139
00:10:06.681 --> 00:10:11.100
Ted and he didn't like,
you know like sit on.

140
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.220
He was farting in his area.
I think it's fine.

141
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:20.170
This incorporates two of my favorite things.
Doggies and king ass rapper.
Yeah.

142
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:25.070
This is like the most perfect video ever made.
Yes I am.

143
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:31.550
Yeah.
That's like what our dog,
that's what faith does.

144
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.640
He was going to say that if the dog doesn't like it,

145
00:10:34.641 --> 00:10:39.080
he will get up and leave and this would have a different feeling if he was like

146
00:10:39.081 --> 00:10:41.730
holding the dog there and like yeah,

147
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.770
he's just farting near the dog and the dog made a choice to leave when it was

148
00:10:45.771 --> 00:10:47.270
okay.
I'm okay with it.

149
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.350
Or didn't insist that the dog stay for the card so it wasn't,

150
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.700
<v 4>it means a few feet above its head.</v>

151
00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:06.230
<v 2>The animal activists or just all lit up right now.
Oh,
I know about him.</v>

152
00:11:06.231 --> 00:11:09.590
I probably get some emails.
How dare you find that dogs?

153
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:14.280
We're going to skip all over him.
Just see
on a dog.

154
00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:15.603
Yeah.

155
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.600
On both of our dogs had several times for it on their heads to in bed.

156
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.560
They lay right there.
What can we do?
How,
where is this by the way?

157
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.530
Why is fighting on a dog?
It's so funny to me.
I don't know.

158
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.350
That's one of my life's joys,
you know,

159
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.920
you know how I was talking about the difference between relief and joy.

160
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.700
I would say farting on a dog's head qualifies as joy.

161
00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.700
That's one of the few things that really lifts me up out of the doldrums.

162
00:11:43.701 --> 00:11:48.260
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
40 just farting is just great in general.
Oh,

163
00:11:48.261 --> 00:11:51.980
so this is now,
so I want to talk about the Lambo Prank.

164
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.943
She's so fun

165
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.970
<v 5>and the actual,
the video's gone.
They must have taken it down,
but so,
well,</v>

166
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.390
just one of these things I'll,
I'll,
I'll explain.
So for people that don't know,

167
00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:05.140
I mean most of you know that are fans of our show that yeah,
we've been doing,

168
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:07.960
I'm sober October and um,

169
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:13.090
talk to a birch with a heart of t the hard t and it included a being sober for

170
00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:17.130
the month,
not drinking or taking drugs,
smoking weed.

171
00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.700
<v 6>And for you that's really not a challenge.</v>

172
00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.960
<v 5>Not that big of a challenge,
a big deal.
Um,</v>

173
00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:26.580
and also 1590 minute hot yoga classes.

174
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.640
Have you farted in any of those classes?
No,

175
00:12:28.641 --> 00:12:32.070
but the closest I came was today by far.

176
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:37.770
So today I finished number 15.
Congratulations.
You're done with sober October.

177
00:12:37.771 --> 00:12:41.240
How do you feel recording this on the 26th?
So I still have a few days a spirit.

178
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.920
I feel like it's,
you know,
I'm glad to be done.

179
00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:49.470
It was an interesting test in discipline,
which I'm a fan of.
I like challenges.

180
00:12:49.471 --> 00:12:51.620
I like being challenged to do things.
Um,

181
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:56.310
I responded well to the weight loss challenge.
I like being challenged here.

182
00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:57.690
It's fun.
It's fun to,

183
00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:03.090
I think it's healthy for people in general to hear something like,
Hey,

184
00:13:03.091 --> 00:13:06.860
I'm like just to test your discipline every once in a while.
In other words.
Sure.

185
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.440
24,
seven all the time.
No,
I mean it's not for me,

186
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.980
but I think if you have,
um,

187
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.560
the opportunity to just test yourself,

188
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:19.140
I think you learn things about yourself and you learn,

189
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.170
one of the things you learn is that you're capable,

190
00:13:22.171 --> 00:13:26.460
probably have more than you think,
you know?
Yeah.
Um,
which is a,

191
00:13:26.461 --> 00:13:28.590
it's a good thing to,
to,
to learn about,
right?

192
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.520
<v 6>Yeah.
Can I tell you I,
cause I was today I thought about you saying that,</v>

193
00:13:31.521 --> 00:13:35.600
cause you said that to me earlier in the week and I was thinking about it and I

194
00:13:35.601 --> 00:13:40.250
was like,
I feel like everyday life is,
is that challenge for me.

195
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.270
Like I,
I'm,
I'm so anxious and so,
um,
I'm just,

196
00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:49.190
every day is a battle to just,
to just be normal.
Does that,

197
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:53.270
I know what I mean.
I feel like every day is an exercise in discipline.

198
00:13:53.271 --> 00:13:57.390
Is that normal?
Is that how no,
no,
no,
no.

199
00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.020
And maybe that's why I don't like challenges.
Maybe.

200
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.430
<v 5>I Dunno.
I mean,
I think what I mean though,
I know what you're,</v>

201
00:14:03.431 --> 00:14:05.140
how you're saying it,
I know exactly what you mean.

202
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.540
But what I'm talking about is more in terms of somebody like when it's like,

203
00:14:10.541 --> 00:14:14.650
hey,
this is hard.
I don't want to do that thing.
You know,
like yeah,

204
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:17.650
go on a run.
Let's say if you're a runner,
you're a runner,

205
00:14:17.651 --> 00:14:22.270
but let's say you're not in,
somebody says,
can you go run a mile?
And you're like,

206
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.810
ah,
I hate doing that.
But I mean like I'm physically capable of doing,

207
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:27.610
I just hate doing it.
Right.
And it's like,

208
00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:32.140
get up and do that five times this week.
Ah,
fuck.
I don't want to do it.

209
00:14:32.141 --> 00:14:35.290
And you think of all the reasons that it sucks,
but then you go,

210
00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:39.010
I'm going to do that thing.
I know the thing that I'm capable of doing,

211
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:43.750
but it's difficult to do and I'm going to do it the whole time.

212
00:14:43.751 --> 00:14:48.220
Whatever the plan is that kind of stick to it.
Yeah,
that kind of challenge.

213
00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:51.980
Exercise and discipline.
Yeah.
It can.
Something that says I have to

214
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.360
<v 2>be physical.
It could be like writing.
If you're like sit down at a computer,</v>

215
00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:59.360
right.
Hour a day or whatever.
I feel like I don't want to do that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

216
00:14:59.361 --> 00:15:00.680
I know you don't want to do it,
but can you do it?

217
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.010
I think at the end of that challenge of let's say if it was right and you'd be,

218
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.680
oh wow,
this was greatly beneficial cause he,

219
00:15:06.681 --> 00:15:11.000
he forced yourself to do something and then the rewards from that are pretty

220
00:15:11.001 --> 00:15:13.410
good.
Well,
yeah,
I guess you could say [inaudible] and,

221
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:17.390
and dieting for me was my discipline thing.
Absolutely.

222
00:15:17.391 --> 00:15:20.690
That actually really turned my life around mentally.
Cause then you go,
oh,

223
00:15:20.691 --> 00:15:23.270
I can do this.
Like I'm not some schmuck that's just

224
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:29.930
a slave to their,
their whims,
you know?
Yeah.
I have no,
yeah,

225
00:15:29.931 --> 00:15:33.770
I guess so.
I guess self-disciplined.
That's a good thing.
Well this is,
um,

226
00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.830
so we've been doing this challenge and we poke fun at each other,

227
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.530
especially Ari burden.
I,

228
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:44.120
we used to little jabs at each other when we make videos.
Yeah.
Every Schaffer

229
00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:46.980
<v 5>burnt crystals and myself.
Um,</v>

230
00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.440
and we take a little jabs at each other and it's just,
you know,

231
00:15:49.441 --> 00:15:54.010
we just have fun her crystals.
Yeah.
Cause it's the three of us and Joe,
um,

232
00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:57.980
but you know,
we,
we,
we have fun doing these videos.

233
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.510
Like let's put Instagram posts up and we'll just say like,

234
00:16:00.511 --> 00:16:04.350
I finished the class so the other day,
uh,

235
00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.180
should fear.
And Burt went to a class together and as they left,

236
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.910
they had the yoga instructor talk and they were like,

237
00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:15.010
they were like making fun of me and Joe,
I forget what the,

238
00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:18.120
one of the things they said,
they're like,
oh,
you're seeing toe Tom.

239
00:16:18.121 --> 00:16:20.010
And then the guy was like,
oh that little short guy,

240
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.020
because that's pointed like Ari's jokes is that I'm short.

241
00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:27.000
And then he's like in the Blue Porsche and the,
and they're like,

242
00:16:27.001 --> 00:16:30.390
yeah.
He's like,
yeah.
And then I saw a bird and,

243
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:35.250
and are so ridiculous,
like such ridiculous car.
And like he said,

244
00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:39.780
cheesy,
you're driving his blue car.
And I,
and I saw that and I was like,

245
00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:45.060
first of all,
it's not ridiculous.
And I go,
if you want to see,
ridiculous.

246
00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:50.670
And you want to see cheesy,
we can step this thing up to a whole other level,

247
00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:53.250
you know?
And I think like there's huge,

248
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:57.270
many layers to the car thing for me,

249
00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:02.520
and particularly this car in particular that I decided to rent and take to this.

250
00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:07.470
First of all,
I'm a car nut.
Like I'm a fanatic.
I love cars.

251
00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:09.960
<v 2>Yeah.
If somebody magazines,
yeah,</v>

252
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:15.260
I sure I'm still hasn't changed since I was a kid.
I used to play

253
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:18.270
<v 5>little toy cars,
you know,
um,</v>

254
00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.490
read every car magazine and I still buy them all the time.
I've always,

255
00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:25.430
I've gone to car shows.
I love it.
I just love cars.

256
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:30.590
When you love cars there,
they usually fall into different categories for you.

257
00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.440
You're like,
you know,
that shit sucks.

258
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:38.540
I wish I could get those.
Like these are the cars I love.

259
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.960
And then there's a category of car that you're like,

260
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:45.230
I get that someone's into that,
but it does nothing for me.

261
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:49.920
It's an absurd thing.
It just doesn't,
there's no,

262
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:53.670
it's like if you want to relate it to like human beings,
like someone's saying,

263
00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.180
isn't that person attractive?
And you're like,
doesn't do anything for me.
Right.

264
00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.150
I understand that you might think that person's attractive,

265
00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:05.460
but he don't want to fuck that guy.
Right.
For Free Room and board.
Right.

266
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.380
There's a homeless guy out there that wants that.

267
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:11.010
Who wants to fuck that guy and pissing and and beat on him.
Just try it.

268
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.570
So something for everybody.
There's some for everyone.
For me,

269
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.820
Lamborghinis fall into that category.
They just do nothing for me.

270
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:24.330
I see them as comical,
ridiculous cars.

271
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:29.570
I see a Lamborghini the same way I see somebody with a pet tiger or like a mink

272
00:18:31.051 --> 00:18:35.550
coat or like if somebody said like,
hey,
you like shoes.
And I'd be like,
yeah,

273
00:18:35.551 --> 00:18:39.230
like she was like,
I got to shoes,
made a diamonds.
Do you want to wear them?
And I,

274
00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.600
no,
I don't want to wear it.
That's ridiculous.
It doesn't do it.

275
00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:46.900
<v 6>It does nothing because it's so outrageous.
Outrageous.
A Lamborghini,</v>

276
00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:48.920
because we've been joking about that sort of thing.

277
00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:51.960
<v 5>Your joke,
it's longer than that.</v>

278
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.310
This is a joke where even though maybe not 15 but like,
yeah,
you're right,

279
00:18:56.311 --> 00:19:00.990
10 to 12 years old,
like it's always been just like a punchline to us.

280
00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.110
<v 6>Lamborghini,
who in their right mind like,
like a,
you were saying because it's so,</v>

281
00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.930
it's so flashy and garish.

282
00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:11.800
It's like the sultan of Brunei has a Lamberg.
Exactly.

283
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.900
Only people who really want a tea,

284
00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:17.380
like a lot of autonomy or just have so much money,

285
00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:23.530
they don't know what to do.
And the Lamborghini,
the,
the efficiency,

286
00:19:23.531 --> 00:19:26.650
there's no efficiency.
Number one,
there's no cup holders and a Lamborghini,

287
00:19:26.651 --> 00:19:29.620
you can't even bring like your cup and put it in there.

288
00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:33.160
You can't recline the seats because it's all and everything's made of Suede and

289
00:19:33.161 --> 00:19:37.540
leather.
So you can't even spill or put a crumb in it.
It's such an absurd,

290
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:42.730
it's an absurd.
And the ones with the,
the,
the doors that go up like the wings.

291
00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:45.700
So what you're gonna take your Lamborghini to the grocery store.

292
00:19:45.701 --> 00:19:47.440
Where are you going to park it?
One of my favorite,

293
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.820
<v 5>see you've told us before,
but it's been years favorite things we ever did.</v>

294
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:57.590
Like as an ongoing joke of the Lamborghini Lamborghini,

295
00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.380
so ridiculous.
Ridiculous.

296
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:05.530
I remember years ago we were living and the Rampart division,

297
00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:10.270
yeah.
Did Not have a lot of money doing that.
I mean,
like,
you know,

298
00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:14.710
we're trying to make rent and I called my dad and I go,

299
00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:20.230
hey,
um,
we're going to,
I'm going to lease a Lamborghini.
And he goes,
what?

300
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:24.190
And I go,
I'm going at Lamborghini.
I said,
you know,
it's in La,

301
00:20:24.191 --> 00:20:27.460
it's very important that you are perceived a certain way.

302
00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.140
And so I'm going to figure it out.
Like we were to save some money,

303
00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:38.450
<v 6>this whole thing.
And it was like,
Dad,
you know,</v>

304
00:20:38.451 --> 00:20:41.720
when you pull up to like the club,
the comedy store,
the laugh factory,

305
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:43.490
you got to look like you're a big deal.

306
00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:46.980
You can't just pull it up in like a Honda.
No.
You have to have a labor.

307
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.120
People need to think that you're really successful.
Yeah.

308
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.820
<v 5>And he was like,
okay.
He goes,
I understand that.
And I said,
so,
you know,</v>

309
00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:54.900
like we're really gonna have to put some money together,

310
00:20:54.901 --> 00:20:59.130
but I'm an Elise this thing and it's,
you know,
it's going to be like,
no.

311
00:20:59.131 --> 00:21:02.800
But he used to,
you used to tell him the math.
Yeah,
I broke it down.
I said like,

312
00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:06.900
we're,
we're putting like 30,000 days what we could get together.

313
00:21:06.901 --> 00:21:08.940
I'm borrowing money from people,
all our,

314
00:21:08.941 --> 00:21:12.060
all our savings and that kind of like drive at $100 a hundred miles a month,

315
00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:16.390
something like that.
Like something so stupid.
And he's like,
well,
you know,

316
00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:21.810
I support you.
It was so sweet.
He was so sweet and support.
Like he wasn't like,

317
00:21:21.811 --> 00:21:25.200
that's the stupidest fucking thing ever.
He was like,
he was like,
okay,

318
00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:30.000
like I get it.
I get it.
Yeah.
You got to look like you belong.
And I was like,

319
00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:33.690
oh,
he's like,
you're in show business.
You got,
yeah.
Look like you're successful.

320
00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:38.520
Yeah.
So that one like that did not get the reaction,

321
00:21:38.521 --> 00:21:41.280
but I,
you know,
when I told him,
I was like,
no.
I even told him one time,

322
00:21:41.281 --> 00:21:43.500
I was like,
I'm going to grow my hair out.

323
00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:47.620
I'm gonna start combing it back and I'm going to grease it back and I'm,

324
00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.910
I'm getting an earring but like it'll grow up.
And he was like,
yeah,

325
00:21:50.911 --> 00:21:53.280
you got to stand out and look different.
Like totally

326
00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:58.200
<v 6>so wonderful because in la,
by the way,</v>

327
00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:03.230
the only time I've ever seen a Lamborghini is parked in front of like the

328
00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:07.550
Beverly Hills Hotel.
Like some,
some Weirdo foreigner has rented one.

329
00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.430
<v 5>That philosophy that we're talking about of like the standing out,</v>

330
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:14.020
there were so many people in this city who believed that they do go.

331
00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:17.450
Like I'm going to grow the hair out and where the weird thing,

332
00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.590
the leather sleeveless vest because I want to look like I'm different and

333
00:22:21.591 --> 00:22:22.550
everyone's like,
no,
you're good.

334
00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:23.533
<v 6>Sure our,</v>

335
00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:28.430
because it is a certain type of personality that wants that Lamborghini level

336
00:22:28.431 --> 00:22:29.264
attention.
Yeah.

337
00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.730
I'm the guy that parks in front of the hotel so that everybody sees the car.

338
00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:36.200
It felt horrible.

339
00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:40.350
<v 5>Let me tell you the full,
the full details of this.
So</v>

340
00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:46.280
I fucking go down there.
I go to this place to rent it.

341
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:49.820
I look online again,
we always talk about this.
By the way,

342
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:55.100
the first place that I emailed and called never even got back to me about it was

343
00:22:55.101 --> 00:22:58.160
like one of the top rated exotic rental places.
I'm always,

344
00:22:58.161 --> 00:23:02.980
I'm always just blown away by the place that doesn't reply to the person who's

345
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:06.050
like,
here's my email,
my phone number,
here's everything.

346
00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.570
I want to rent a Lamborghini tomorrow.
And they'll,

347
00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.950
and they're like advertising that that's what they do.
It's crazy.

348
00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:17.570
So this place actually replies,
you know,
um,
they tell me,

349
00:23:17.571 --> 00:23:21.260
here's what cars we have a,
it's called seven,

350
00:23:21.261 --> 00:23:25.850
seven seven exotics.com.
And they were very,
you know,

351
00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:31.250
very nice.
So I go down there and then the plan is,

352
00:23:31.251 --> 00:23:35.560
what I'm going to do is go to hot yoga and I have these water bottles that

353
00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:39.350
somebody gave to us.
So the plan is I'll rent this,
I'll get the Lamborghini,

354
00:23:39.351 --> 00:23:42.050
he'll park it.
And then when I give them their water bottles,

355
00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.370
they'll see you lower them out to the car with the walls.

356
00:23:45.371 --> 00:23:46.040
Cause that was the thing I was

357
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.270
<v 2>going to ask you is,
well,</v>

358
00:23:47.271 --> 00:23:51.200
how are you going to get the guys out to the parking lot after the class and

359
00:23:51.201 --> 00:23:56.120
everyone can see the stupid car.
And the truth is I really just wanted,

360
00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:00.800
the truth is that I would have just done this just for Bert.
Like that was,

361
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:04.920
he was the mark,
you know,
like,
uh,

362
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:09.740
Joe and Ari are like collateral damage like it sure.
It's a vert prank.

363
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:14.930
So I get down there and I'm like,
which one should I get?
And they're like,

364
00:24:14.931 --> 00:24:19.460
how about this Orange Lamborghini?
And I go,
that's perfect.

365
00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.290
That's crazy.
This is perfect.
It's so ridiculous.
Um,

366
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:25.280
I,

367
00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:30.280
I leave the engine does this kind of funky thing when I'm a few miles away in

368
00:24:31.521 --> 00:24:33.080
the orange lemon and the orange one,

369
00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.450
I could not feel like a bigger dick by the way.

370
00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:39.770
Everyone's looking at me horrible.
You know,
like I actually lay low,

371
00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.230
like I'm not like check me out,
you know,

372
00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:46.220
so everyone's staring people at stoplights.
You know,

373
00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:47.900
I saw,

374
00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:52.220
I pulled out of a driveway and I saw a lady go like her,

375
00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:55.840
her mouth dropped and she was like,
but it looked horrified.
Yeah.

376
00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:59.510
I rolled down the window.
I go,
don't get one.
It's stupid.
And she was like,
oh,

377
00:24:59.511 --> 00:25:00.650
like she caught herself.

378
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:06.320
That would be the person where when I'm with LJ I go,
sweetie,
that's a douchebag.

379
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:10.760
Yeah,
yeah.
Can you say,
oh my God,
that's a douchebag.
So anyways,

380
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:14.300
the engine did this crazy thing on its own and it's like a spaceship in there.

381
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:18.080
I mean everything's,
they have to tell you like,
here's how you park,
here's,

382
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.690
here's how you,
you know,
turn this,

383
00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.450
here's how the turn signal where there's none of,
it's intuitive.

384
00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:26.960
So did you put your insurance policy?

385
00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:30.350
Do you have to take out an additional thing?
Cause it's such an expensive car.

386
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:33.680
I used my own,
it was a risk,
but like I could have bought,
there is,
I didn't,

387
00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:37.790
I use my own,
but yeah,
it was a calculated risk.
I was like,

388
00:25:37.791 --> 00:25:39.680
I'm not going to take us a lot of places.
I think,

389
00:25:39.681 --> 00:25:44.030
I think I'll be at home and then I yell gun back.
It's still a risk.
But I mean,

390
00:25:44.031 --> 00:25:46.670
you know,
it was a gamble,
but it's anyways,

391
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.150
the engine does some crazy thing that I'm like,
what is it doing right now?

392
00:25:50.151 --> 00:25:52.430
It was like on its own revving.
So I just,

393
00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:56.360
I was like a couple of miles away and I called them and they're like,

394
00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:00.380
well let us check it out.
Um,
how about uh,

395
00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.980
just stay where you are and I'll bring you the convertible,

396
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:07.100
the white convertible.
And I go,
okay,
great.
I mean,

397
00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.040
and for a second I was disappointed.
I was like,
oh no,
I don't have the,

398
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.330
the orange absurd car.

399
00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:16.490
But what I realized as they pulled up and I got in the white one was that the

400
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:21.320
white one was more believable as something that I would get because the orange

401
00:26:21.321 --> 00:26:25.430
line a little too crazy.
It's too much of a,
ha ha.
On those joke,

402
00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:25.881
they would be like,

403
00:26:25.881 --> 00:26:29.270
you didn't get an allowance when you told me that you got the white one.
I go,
oh,

404
00:26:29.271 --> 00:26:30.310
that's even better.
Yeah.

405
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:34.310
Now Burt's really going to think that's what I put together after I was cause I

406
00:26:34.311 --> 00:26:37.250
was driving.
I was like,
this is actually believable.

407
00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:42.170
And it was a beautiful a lever.
Eda.
Yeah,
no,
it's like a stunning,

408
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.550
stunning like Red Suede.

409
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:49.290
<v 5>Yeah.
Interior.
I mean it was black accents.
Yeah.
I mean it's nuts.</v>

410
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:53.010
Do you think drives unlike anything I've ever been in.

411
00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:57.570
And I would tell you I'm jumping ahead.
When I returned it,
the guy goes,
uh,

412
00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.080
do you want to go for a quick ride?
In the event the door,
which is the,

413
00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:03.990
the step up Lamborghini with a wick,

414
00:27:03.991 --> 00:27:07.200
the doors that slide up but also has a much crazier engine.

415
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:08.490
And I remember thinking like,

416
00:27:08.491 --> 00:27:12.900
how much crazier could this drive than the one that I've had for a day?

417
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:17.340
The hood icon,
the way who would icon,
what does that mean?
Hurricane?

418
00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:21.210
Oh
shit bag.

419
00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.310
So I get in the event the door and I'm like,
at first it starts and I'm like,

420
00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:29.390
well that already feels different.
Like the old car,
it was like Blah Blah Blah.

421
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:34.530
The button to,
to start a Lamborghini is actually like a launchpad button.

422
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.320
It's like,
you know when you see in the movies,
you lift the lever.
Yeah.

423
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:40.770
It's like a flip a switch for the missile.
I mean it's an experience.

424
00:27:40.771 --> 00:27:43.260
Here's the thing,
that whole,
the whole thing is a fun experience.

425
00:27:43.261 --> 00:27:47.490
I totally recommend renting these cars.
Yeah.
Hundred percent.

426
00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:51.570
So anyways,
he took me a couple blocks in the event,
the door,
and I was like,

427
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.230
this is 10 times crazier than the one I rented.
He was like,

428
00:27:55.231 --> 00:28:00.210
I know this one's really fucking nuts and costs a few hundred thousand dollars

429
00:28:00.211 --> 00:28:03.660
more cheese.
So anyways,
dialing it back now.
So the,

430
00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:07.980
so that night,
the night that I get it,
I,
I ran it,

431
00:28:07.981 --> 00:28:12.210
I take it home and I have a show at the comedy store and I go,

432
00:28:12.211 --> 00:28:17.211
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to take it to the store tonight and just,

433
00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:21.200
you know,
Park like it's normal,
no big deal.
Yeah.

434
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.960
And then go do my spot and then go home.
Because a lot of famous comedians,

435
00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:29.700
truth and most people wouldn't know this,
but a lot of really famous successful,

436
00:28:29.701 --> 00:28:31.680
rich comedians do that.
Well they'll,

437
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:36.000
they'll roll up in a crazy car and then all the door guys will be like,

438
00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:39.480
who's fucking car is that?
And then it's the talk of the comedy store comics.

439
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:42.210
Everybody has to exactly who pulled up in the Ferrari.

440
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:47.840
Now what I was hoping was that none of the guys were at the store that night and

441
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:49.590
this way,
like,

442
00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:54.030
like rumors would start leaking cause that would be like a perfect ploy into it.

443
00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.810
But what happened was he got added to the show I was doing and I saw a tweak or

444
00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.900
like,
oh we just added already to the show.
And I'm like,
Ooh.

445
00:29:00.901 --> 00:29:01.920
Then I was debating like,

446
00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:07.200
it's going to blow the wad of having it at hot yoga because otherwise then it's

447
00:29:07.201 --> 00:29:11.670
just like a comedy store parking lot.
Then then Burke hall,
he's like,

448
00:29:11.671 --> 00:29:14.310
you're going to store tonight?
And I go,
yeah.
He goes,
oh,
I'll see you there.

449
00:29:14.311 --> 00:29:17.520
And then I go,
I'm not bringing it because I want to save it for hot yoga.

450
00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.400
It's better.
It's better than the day time.
And absolutely.

451
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:23.420
And also just the four of us are not like the scene of the story,

452
00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.080
not to explain it to all the comics.

453
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:28.620
So I go to the store and I wasn't gonna say anything to anybody,

454
00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:32.040
but as I'm leaving the store,
Joe was also there.

455
00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.400
He walks up to me and he was just,
whatever,

456
00:29:35.401 --> 00:29:39.480
just bullshitting and I'm too excited.
I just get,
you know what I mean?

457
00:29:39.481 --> 00:29:42.060
When you're like excited.
It's like when you're excited,
a joke.
Yeah.
You're

458
00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:46.180
<v 2>like,
I got this joke.
So I go out,
I tell you what I'm doing.
And he goes,
uh,</v>

459
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:49.630
he goes,
what?
I said,
you know,
these guys made this video and they were like,

460
00:29:49.631 --> 00:29:53.620
oh that Porsche.
So ridiculous.
Of course he's like,
how's that ridiculous.

461
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.250
I love portion.
I mean I know,
I know.
I go,
well,
so what I'm going to do is,

462
00:29:57.251 --> 00:30:02.251
and I tell him I rent a Lamborghini to hot yet tomorrow he starts laughing like

463
00:30:03.141 --> 00:30:07.390
really bad and I go and I'm just going to play it notch.
And he goes,
Oh yeah,

464
00:30:07.391 --> 00:30:10.540
I go,
you got to help me sell.
He goes 100%.
I'll tell him you're doing great.

465
00:30:10.541 --> 00:30:12.970
What's a good day?
He uh,

466
00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:18.040
he 100% deserves all that stuff,
all that stuff.

467
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:21.790
Why not enjoy life?
Like what are you gonna do is save all your money.

468
00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:25.120
So it was like,
it is perfectly lined up.

469
00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:31.030
Then the next move is I get,
um,
you know,

470
00:30:31.031 --> 00:30:32.850
the next day I'm just like,
wait,

471
00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:36.910
cause you came home and then you told me that Joe was in on it yet I'm here to

472
00:30:36.911 --> 00:30:41.911
here because I think it's more powerful if Joe does now because he and you can

473
00:30:42.821 --> 00:30:46.300
kind of gang up on Bert and Ari and convince them that no,

474
00:30:46.301 --> 00:30:50.350
this is a really good idea.
This is what successful men do.
What's wrong with you?

475
00:30:50.351 --> 00:30:54.040
Like you're the asshole.
Exactly.
How much our Lamborghini's just so that,

476
00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:58.030
all right.
So for people that don't know the one that I was driving,

477
00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:01.960
some people online,
I have to say,
uh,
guests,

478
00:31:01.961 --> 00:31:04.390
it was a 2005 or six.

479
00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:08.470
It is a 2017 bro.
Like it's brand new.

480
00:31:08.471 --> 00:31:10.660
It had 3,800 miles on it,

481
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:14.960
so it's out of the spray from the factory man.
Uh,

482
00:31:14.961 --> 00:31:16.690
that one was 350,000.

483
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:22.660
That Aventador the one that he took me for a ride and afterward it was 500,000.

484
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:27.520
Crazy.
Yeah,
it's a lot.
But this was three 50.

485
00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:31.660
That's crazy.
It's real nuts.
It's really fucking nuts.

486
00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:36.040
It's silly unless you're a billionaire.
It's just silly.
It is.
It's the silliest,

487
00:31:36.041 --> 00:31:40.500
which is the most fun to pretend like to me the amusement in this,
like the,

488
00:31:40.501 --> 00:31:44.770
the joy in this would be to pretend like what's the big deal.

489
00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:46.810
But I mean like to really sell it.

490
00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:50.780
And that's what I kept imagining is that bird's gonna Freak out and I'm just

491
00:31:50.781 --> 00:31:55.070
going to go like what?
I make a lot of money or just,
or just be like,
but what?

492
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:58.730
Like what am I going to save for my kid's college tuition scholarships.

493
00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:01.550
Just not a big deal,
but also like that's not that much.
Yeah,

494
00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:07.510
it's Sharon 50 times.
No big deal.
So,
oh God.

495
00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:12.040
So of course I'm just,
I'm just,
I'm like,
I'm so antsy to go to class.

496
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:16.440
I want to make sure that I'm early cause I didn't want to blow the um,

497
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:20.680
like the show of it before class for some reason that we're sure not going to be

498
00:32:20.681 --> 00:32:24.760
as fun.
Right.
So I showed up like half an hour early.

499
00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:29.110
And funny enough,
as I'm pulling into hot yoga,
my phone rings,

500
00:32:29.111 --> 00:32:32.380
I'm like pulling in the parking lot and it's Joe and I answer.
He goes,

501
00:32:32.381 --> 00:32:36.230
you've got a white one.
And I go,
how?
You know?
He goes,
I'm right behind you guys.

502
00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:41.120
I just saw a Lamborghini and I'd go,
that's gotta be
so I go,
yeah.

503
00:32:41.121 --> 00:32:42.800
He was like,
he's like,
that's fucking crazy.

504
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:47.720
So we park like away from where I normally park.

505
00:32:47.721 --> 00:32:50.630
So it wasn't like,
you know,
normally I park in one section of the parking lot,

506
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:54.200
I parked away from it and I go,
so after class I go,

507
00:32:54.201 --> 00:32:58.040
I'll tell you an ra got your water bottles from this guy that sent them to us.

508
00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.300
We'll walk over here.
And he's like,
all right,
cool.
So we go to class,
wait.

509
00:33:02.301 --> 00:33:02.981
And that by the way,

510
00:33:02.981 --> 00:33:07.070
is my favorite part of the story of like lowering them to the car and being like

511
00:33:07.071 --> 00:33:10.460
at your water bottles right here in the trunk,
which is in the front of this car.

512
00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.410
And then you're like,
oh,
what's the big deal?

513
00:33:12.411 --> 00:33:15.890
It's my Lamborghini and I'm getting water bottle.
That such a great moment,

514
00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.580
you know,
so like I really wanted to sell this hard.

515
00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:23.660
So the way to sell it,
I thought it was to be very nonchalant.
Oh yeah.

516
00:33:23.661 --> 00:33:27.380
You have to be like whatever.
What else?
This is what I did.
What's the big deal?

517
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:28.640
We finished class,

518
00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:33.670
<v 5>we're walking back and we're just talking about like at the time we had
finished,</v>

519
00:33:33.671 --> 00:33:36.220
you know,
I think,
uh,

520
00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:40.780
Ari and I had finished number 14,
Joe and Bert had just finished number 13.

521
00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:45.490
So we're talking this and that and he's like,
oh,
what are you doing tomorrow?

522
00:33:45.491 --> 00:33:48.010
What are you doing the next day?
Blah,
blah,
blah.
And we started walking,

523
00:33:48.011 --> 00:33:52.060
Ari and Joe or Aryan Bert had a road together.

524
00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:56.350
So they're walking this way and I go,
I got your water bottle.
He's like,
Oh yeah,

525
00:33:56.351 --> 00:33:58.540
cause our,
he really wanted that.
He goes like,
yeah,
I want that water bottle.

526
00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:01.600
It's like a come here.
And we start walking and you know,

527
00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:03.910
you're starting to see there's less cars that could be mine.

528
00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:07.720
So it's like we're walking and I hear Burger.

529
00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:09.520
So we got a Lamborghini over

530
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:15.620
<v 2>and as he says that I reached in my pocket and I press unlock and the lights go</v>

531
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.770
and he goes,
yeah,

532
00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:17.603
<v 7>sure.</v>

533
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:23.960
<v 2>And you know,
some people would ask,</v>

534
00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.960
like I told my cousin Brian about it and he's like,
you got to record.

535
00:34:26.961 --> 00:34:31.890
And I was like,
if I just pull out my phone immediately too obvious.
So it was,

536
00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:34.340
I think it was important to try to like

537
00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:39.480
<v 5>dial it back a little bit.
Yeah.
So I go home,
I go,
you want that water bottle,</v>

538
00:34:39.481 --> 00:34:41.880
right.
And I can,
I didn't even address,
I opened there,
I kiss,

539
00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.420
keep hearing burgling sure

540
00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:45.803
<v 7>go.</v>

541
00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:53.060
<v 5>So I opened the front hood,
which you can put a fucking laptop in,</v>

542
00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:57.010
in a Lamborghini and I pull out the,
I go,
I thought you wanted your water bottle.

543
00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:01.110
I give it to Joe.
Joe Is of course.
He's like,

544
00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:05.390
<v 2>balling.
Totally supportive.</v>

545
00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:10.220
It's supportive.
He's lad.
How you bald man.
Fuck yeah.
He's like,
wait,

546
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:14.310
where'd it go Tommy?
He's like six [inaudible] sick man.

547
00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:16.340
And Ari is like,

548
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:21.210
<v 5>oh,
like not really saying much he's doing is already thing.
Yeah,</v>

549
00:35:21.211 --> 00:35:25.860
he's doing his already thing.
Burt immediately goes,
W you rented this?

550
00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:27.120
And I go,
no,
I think it was.

551
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:31.390
And he's looking at me like he's ignoring Joe and Ari talking.
He's like,

552
00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:36.750
like really eyeball me,
you know,
cause he knows me.
He's like,
did you,
are you?

553
00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:42.360
And I go,
yeah,
I go,
is that crazy?
He's like,
you bought a Lamborghini?

554
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:48.140
Yeah,
that's a great year.
That's great here.
He's like,
sure.

555
00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:53.580
Yeah.
And then no teeth,
no angel,
no one Netflix,
you rented this.

556
00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:57.690
And I go,
no.
And the thing is,
since it's a new car,
it has that,
uh,

557
00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.990
the vin number,
vin sticker registration.

558
00:36:00.991 --> 00:36:05.520
I go check my registration and it's still on there and right then our goes check

559
00:36:05.521 --> 00:36:09.360
his registration and as he says that,
and I go,
oh,

560
00:36:09.361 --> 00:36:12.660
I think they're actually going to go try to look at the registration.
Um,

561
00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:15.600
Joe like says something else and it distracts them.

562
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:17.910
So they go back to the conversation.

563
00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:23.670
Then we start like the things are there,
like what the fuck?
And I go,

564
00:36:23.671 --> 00:36:28.140
I got a great deal.
I go,
the owner drove it for like three weeks,

565
00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:29.790
so I've got like 40 grand off.

566
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:34.140
I only paid like 300,000 and they're like so much money.

567
00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:39.270
I mean I go,
I thought that was a good deal.
It's a good deal.
Yeah.

568
00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.630
And I'm just like,
totally like not giving in.
I'm like,
yeah,

569
00:36:42.631 --> 00:36:45.270
it's awesome and you should see how this works.
So I start like,
oh,

570
00:36:45.271 --> 00:36:48.690
you want me to turn it on and turn the car on?
I'm bird.

571
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:53.030

572
00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:57.660

573
00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:02.670

Let's see if this place on Instagram.
Oh,

574
00:37:02.671 --> 00:37:03.504
how funny.

575
00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:09.300
<v 8>The one thing I like to say about me and my friends is that fame hasn't changed</v>

576
00:37:09.301 --> 00:37:13.170
in any of us.
You hang out with Joe.
He's bow hunting is Jujitsu.

577
00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:14.940
It's fucking marijuana.

578
00:37:14.941 --> 00:37:18.930
Ari Shaffir that package to Asia by himself.

579
00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:21.290
He could go backpack right now if you want it to.

580
00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:26.650
Tommy's Mamma I Miss Sarah by is with the fucking brains blown out.

581
00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.570
Like we're friends with Mace and puff Daddy.

582
00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.010
Holy fucking shit.

583
00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:43.220
So Funny Idiots,

584
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:48.720
<v 5>but I could see,
you know,
I could see Burt's still,</v>

585
00:37:48.721 --> 00:37:52.920
like we would have a moment like that,
like for a video and then people kind of,

586
00:37:52.921 --> 00:37:55.800
you know,
you start to regroup Lego and he would just look over.

587
00:37:55.801 --> 00:37:59.400
I see him being like,
what the fuck he's in.
His in his mind is doing the math.

588
00:37:59.401 --> 00:38:02.650
I could see the man,
he's like,
how many tickets is he like?
He was

589
00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.140
the pog.
How much?
How did you get your podcasts?
Be me.

590
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.460
Even when we said like when we said bye to each other.
Yeah.

591
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:14.130
We all got in our car.
I got my car and I started to back up.

592
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:18.180
I turn and he's just looking,
he was like,
he just shook his head.
He was like,

593
00:38:18.181 --> 00:38:21.060
Chinos,
can you crazy?

594
00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:26.880
Could you imagine him going home to Leanne and be like,
oh,
I could push.

595
00:38:26.881 --> 00:38:28.800
It's gotta be so mad.
Oh my God.

596
00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:36.070
Oh my God.
And I started to think about too,
how much fun it would be

597
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:37.293
<v 2>if,
uh,</v>

598
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:43.550
like the whole fun was the idea of him spiraling to the point of buying

599
00:38:45.551 --> 00:38:49.390
something.
Like the dream would be that he was like,
Tom got a Lamborghini,

600
00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:54.550
I'm going to get a corvette like something and then have him show up.

601
00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:58.410
Like pulling the store.
Like,
oh my God.
I'm like,
oh,
I just had,

602
00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:03.010
I just rented that thing.
And you're like,
well,
cause also last night when you,

603
00:39:03.011 --> 00:39:06.130
when you got home,
um,
I was like,
well,

604
00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:10.000
wouldn't it be great if we're thinking of ways to fuck with Burt further if you

605
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:13.280
and Joe Could Kinda team up and be like,
you know,
there,

606
00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:16.640
there had that bad to get into a new one for like,

607
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.760
I texted him last night,
I texted them,
I go,
oh,

608
00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:25.480
it's so fun.
It's not that unreasonable.
Bert,

609
00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:30.130
you're making a lot of money this year.
Yeah.
I texted him last night,

want me to put you in touch with my guy?

611
00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:37.780
He can get you into one for under 200,000
and he didn't reply.

612
00:39:37.781 --> 00:39:42.550
Yeah.
Birds.
Um,
I started to get so many texts.

my husband got a fucking Lamborghini and I am furious.

618
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:03.430
I'm furious.
You need to call him right now.

619
00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:07.060
And convinced him to return it because I am beside myself with anger.

620
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:08.710
And he goes,
okay,
I'm on it.

621
00:40:08.711 --> 00:40:12.640
And then he calls you and then to which you told them the truth,

622
00:40:12.641 --> 00:40:17.470
I told him after he goes,
uh,
he goes,
uh,
hey,
uh,
Tom,
hey,
it's me.

623
00:40:17.471 --> 00:40:19.750
I'm from your local Lamborghini dealership.

624
00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.870
Make sure everything's working all right.
And I go,
Oh yeah,

625
00:40:22.871 --> 00:40:26.020
I'm real happy with him then.
And you know,
then he kinda like dropped character.

626
00:40:26.021 --> 00:40:30.730
He goes,
so wow,

627
00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:34.150
And I go,
yeah.
And he's like,

628
00:40:34.151 --> 00:40:39.130
Christina said she wasn't too thrilled about it.
And I go,
yeah.
He goes,
ah.

629
00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:43.510
He goes,
I really don't want to say congratulations.
And I go,
thanks.

630
00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:47.170
I could tell that he was like,
he's like,
you're crazy.
I,
I tell him,

631
00:40:47.171 --> 00:40:49.030
he started to laugh really hard and I go,

632
00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:53.130
did you think I was totally unstable for a second?
He was,
absolutely.
Yeah,
it was.

633
00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:58.060
I really was like,
wow,
this guy,
I thought I knew him a little bit.
Adam,

634
00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:01.420
Adam from the store or they texted me,
I texted me.

635
00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:04.450
He goes,
he goes,

636
00:41:04.451 --> 00:41:09.130
I was going to text you yesterday to see if you'd lost your fucking
bill.

637
00:41:09.131 --> 00:41:13.990
Burr texted me last night.
That thing really made the rounds.
He wrote like,

638
00:41:13.991 --> 00:41:17.710
please take,
uh,
you know,
pictures.
He goes,
congrats on your new ride.

639
00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.630
And it felt like kind of sincere,
you know?
So I feel I go,
I didn't get one.

640
00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:27.010
I just rented one to mess with Bert.
Ha Ha.
And he wrote,
I love it.

641
00:41:27.011 --> 00:41:31.420
All capital letters.
Hilarious.
Um,
so it was,

642
00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.220
so then,
anyways,
and I had made this video

643
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:39.530
<v 5>when I was,
um,
when I dropped it off and then I posted it a few hours ago,</v>

644
00:41:39.531 --> 00:41:41.420
just after I had talked to Burt this morning.

645
00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:45.410
I talked to Burt this morning and we had a conversation that went,
you know,

646
00:41:45.411 --> 00:41:48.230
left and right.
It wasn't like about it and at the end I was like,
yeah,
I know.

647
00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.330
I said the main thing is like,

648
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:53.740
I definitely don't want things with us to ever change it.

649
00:41:53.741 --> 00:41:57.500
Cause like I have a Lamborghini or like will you still be friends birthday?

650
00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:01.370
And he was like,
no,
it's fucking,
it's,
it's look amazing.

651
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:03.140
There were still like,

652
00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:08.030
he was real sensitive about it and as soon as I hung up,
I wrote,
you'll Burt,

653
00:42:08.031 --> 00:42:08.864
have you seen this?

654
00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:14.570
<v 9>I posted this on guys,
the Jig is up.
I didn't buy a Lamborghini</v>

655
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:20.630
back then.
I did.
I did.

656
00:42:20.631 --> 00:42:21.980
I went to seven,
seven,

657
00:42:21.981 --> 00:42:26.981
seven exotic.cup.com this is not a paid sponsorship.

658
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:32.930
I paid,
I rented it.
You can too.
I highly recommend doing that as opposed to,

659
00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:36.580
I basically exist.
Said,
you know,
at the end of this I go,
I got you

660
00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:37.640
<v 5>Burt.
Like that.
Yeah.</v>

661
00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:41.700
Cause it was really just to see Bert and then he called me,

662
00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:45.950
<v 8>you fucking Dick.
You fucking,
yeah,</v>

663
00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:50.310
you had the whole time.

664
00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:52.670
I was so blown away.
I was like,

665
00:42:52.671 --> 00:42:55.550
there's no way he's got fucking stupid this federal,

666
00:42:56.890 --> 00:43:01.230
let's say 40 grand on it.
I don't give a shit.
By the way,
if you didn't have,

667
00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:04.200
I was being real in the moment and I know Joe was in on it.

668
00:43:04.201 --> 00:43:08.100
He had to be in on it.
Good a penis,
work on news.
He's not that good of an actor.

669
00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:14.020
Joe Is the whole time.
I was like,
look man,

670
00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:18.480
you know she's a baller a off God.
Dammit.

671
00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:24.210
Oh.
Ari was like,
I was in the car the whole time at all.
They're like,

672
00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:27.420
dude,
there's no way you'd be.
I go,
Tom Thought that stupid.
He's not,

673
00:43:27.421 --> 00:43:30.980
doesn't always look good.
It's important.
So I try,

674
00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:35.760
so that's what they're doing
and I was like,
dude,
I'm from board.

675
00:43:35.761 --> 00:43:40.350
He was like going a different coach.
I'm telling you man,
I can't.

676
00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:46.650
Going through and looking at motorcycles all my last night because I was having

677
00:43:46.651 --> 00:43:50.130
a feeling of being left out,
spending money on it.

678
00:43:50.131 --> 00:43:52.030
That's exactly what we're talking about here.
Motorcycles,

679
00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:55.210
all my account for dependent can grant.
I can,

680
00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:59.620
I don't even want to spend five grand on a hot grill buyer.

681
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:03.710
Bullshit fixer upper motorcycle for fucking 10 grand.

682
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:07.050
I'm going to kill me and I started a go fund.
Me.

683
00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:10.710
You and Joe are fucking assholes.

684
00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:16.840
<v 5>Hilarious.
See what I tell you.
I knew that Bert,
I'm pausing.
Oh,
I want it to go.</v>

685
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:21.040
The dogs need to eat and stuff.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's pause there after birds,

686
00:44:21.041 --> 00:44:24.560
voicemails.
So I know a Risa and I want us all right.
We're back.
Uh,

687
00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.580
there was a quick break.
Um,

688
00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:30.700
I think the best is my favorite part of this whole thing.
First of all,

689
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:34.020
that was some of the best money I ever spent was renting that car.

690
00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:39.360
And I would say again,
for car enthusiasts is really fun to rent a car there.

691
00:44:39.361 --> 00:44:44.280
You're not committing to buying.
Yeah.
Even ones that aren't that expensive.

692
00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:48.270
Renting a fun car to drive is a fun thing to do.
I totally get that.

693
00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:51.140
My favorite thing though is that I,
you know,

694
00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:54.750
I talked to bird after this and he was like,
he was,
I knew it.

695
00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:57.450
I just knew that you weren't that stupid.
Like I knew you would do that,

696
00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:00.000
but that Ari was like,
he's definitely dumb enough.

697
00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:02.750
<v 2>Hi.
Yeah,
right.
Ari was like,</v>

698
00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:08.200
Ari called me bite trash and then I was from Florida and that Florida people are

699
00:45:08.331 --> 00:45:11.810
stupid and that we would definitely buy that guy's so damn rude.

700
00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:14.430
Dare you Arie Aries.

701
00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:17.430
<v 5>That's how he is,
you know.
Um,
so anyways,</v>

702
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.730
that was the lamp Lambo Prank.
I think that's,
you know,
uh,
no,
I don't know.

703
00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:27.720
Was maybe Lambo Prank.
Um,
100% worth it.

704
00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:32.190
So fun to see birds face.
So fun to get him to,
to spiral.

705
00:45:32.191 --> 00:45:34.470
He was searching for motorcycles last night online.

706
00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:38.530
<v 2>I knew he would react that way.
I know.
I call it,
I go,</v>

707
00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:42.400
there's no way he is right now in his mind,

708
00:45:42.401 --> 00:45:43.750
counting how much you're making.

709
00:45:43.751 --> 00:45:47.750
And then he's going to find a way to match what you're doing.
God's work.

710
00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:49.260
He's got to participate in some way.

711
00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:54.650
W I bet Leanne last night was just like,
oh my God,

712
00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:59.470
what has Tom done with it?
What if he as go fund me,

713
00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:04.500
change with them?
Yes.
Bros.

714
00:46:04.501 --> 00:46:08.260
So I know you guys are itching or some machines within remixes.

715
00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:12.820
They keep coming in.
So it's my favorite thing.
Right.
And it's so fantastic.

716
00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:19.743
<v 10>Yeah,</v>

717
00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:28.950
sure.
Is Miss Ease within by Michael Hodgdon?

718
00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:32.510
Yeah.
Yeah.
He turned it off

719
00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:35.163
to Germany.

720
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:41.333
Yeah.

721
00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.830
Yeah.
This is how I hear it.
I heard it in my head.

722
00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:57.500
I heard it so much to say.

723
00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:06.260
Yeah.
Great.
By the way,

724
00:47:06.261 --> 00:47:10.430
this Halloween season two perfect.
Morocco.

725
00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:17.640
It's a good song.
I love it.
Yeah,
that's it.

726
00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:20.243
We're going on a ride.

727
00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:27.560
<v 2>We're ground the flow working on my flows of all the haters,</v>

728
00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:33.100
haters here is,
um,
of all the haters,

729
00:47:33.101 --> 00:47:36.070
rage against the machines within,
oh my God.

730
00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:41.020
Why didn't we think of that by Pete from one and a quarter.
Okay.

731
00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.700
That's who made this one here

732
00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:43.643
<v 10>piece.</v>

733
00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.680
Yeah,
I liked that.
Terminator.
Gange

734
00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:01.750
that's it.
Good.
It's really good.
Yeah.

735
00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.770
Juice,
juice,
juice.

736
00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:33.860
It's pretty good,
right?
It's really good,

737
00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:36.070
<v 2>by the way.
Um,
I think I already said this,</v>

738
00:48:36.071 --> 00:48:40.930
but I don't know if I said it only to you off camera and not on the show,

739
00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:46.110
but the other really crazy thing that surprised me going back to the Lambo thing

740
00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:50.050
was how many people were like,
the Internet always kicks you in the balls.

741
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:54.940
I got like hundreds and hundreds of people being like so happy for you.

742
00:48:55.400 --> 00:49:00.310
I know.
It was like some people were like,
oh,
you're rich.
Fuck you.
Which was like,

743
00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:03.730
all right man.
Like that was their take on it.
Like I like,

744
00:49:03.731 --> 00:49:07.600
I used to like you so crazy.
It's such a crazy reaction.
Yeah.

745
00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:12.340
But the majority of people were like so happy for you man.
Yeah,
we're adulation.

746
00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:16.480
I will say that are our fans are genuinely,
that was very nice,

747
00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:19.240
sweet and supportive of of stuff.
And that's,

748
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:23.920
it is so refreshing on the Internet,
which is a wasteland of hatred.
Yeah,

749
00:49:23.921 --> 00:49:26.950
that's what I'm saying.
I know.
So it's nice that I just,

750
00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:30.850
that was just a real quick,
does it make a nice comment on Twitter or anywhere?

751
00:49:30.851 --> 00:49:35.350
It blows me away when people don't kind.
You're like,
what?
I thought,
you know,

752
00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:39.160
I'm in this douche mobile and it's a $300,000.

753
00:49:39.490 --> 00:49:42.280
Like people are just going to be like,
ah.
And there was a few,

754
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:47.500
but if you read through the comments on my Instagram,
it's mostly people going,

755
00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:51.670
you earned it.
Congratulations with it man.
Machines within.
Yeah.

756
00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:55.240
I did see a bunch of machines with him,
but anyways,

757
00:49:55.241 --> 00:49:57.670
I thought that was actually very surprising.
Yes.

758
00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:02.050
Machines within also came in with video and music submissions.

759
00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:04.690
Get the fuck Outta here of a few of these o m g

781
00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:55.103
<v 13>Nate from India.</v>

782
00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:08.340

Let them know.

Wow.</v>

789
00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:20.100
That's a Nate from Indy.
Incredible.
So many.
I mean,
I feel like I'm serious.

790
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:24.420
There's so many incredibly musically inclined.
People who listen to this show,

791
00:53:24.421 --> 00:53:27.000
I'm,
I'm,
he knew such talented people.

792
00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:29.160
I thought it was all just derelicts like us that listen,

793
00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:30.810
I know there's really talented people.

794
00:53:30.811 --> 00:53:33.030
I'm a little disappointed that we didn't get a song.
You know,

795
00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:39.040
she's retarded song,
but you can only get so much.
She's retarded.

796
00:53:39.041 --> 00:53:43.620
So let me see.
Do I see you?
I don't,
I don't see one.
No.
I was thinking that the,

797
00:53:43.621 --> 00:53:46.770
she's retarded.
That could be a fun prank for spouses.

798
00:53:46.771 --> 00:53:50.820
You could say that about your wife or husband in public when they act up,

799
00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:54.030
we think this email.
Oh,
it's interesting.
Right?

800
00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:58.110
Design means twins,
conjoined twins.
If they get a job,

801
00:53:58.111 --> 00:54:02.600
do they get one salary or to dammit machines within f the haters navy.

802
00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.260
That is an excellent question.

803
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:10.200
I hope that machines will then f the haters for places.
Hey Hitler.
Yeah,

804
00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:13.850
me too.
Believe me,
especially as you're,

805
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.440
you're touring starts to pick up now and you hear it as many times as I did this

806
00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:23.670
year,
walking to the stage as you get on stage and as the applause dies,
you know,

807
00:54:23.671 --> 00:54:27.030
and they settled in for you to talk and you're like,
hello.
And then they go,

808
00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:29.310
Hey Hitler like that.
And you're like,
Huh.

809
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:34.190
Well I was at Twitter yesterday doing the Twitter Q and a Santa Monica.

810
00:54:34.610 --> 00:54:38.730
It's Super Fun.
Is that,
it's not official HQ,
right?
Cause that's up north,

811
00:54:38.731 --> 00:54:43.590
but it's like Twitter,
la.
So there's offices in Denver,
San Francisco,

812
00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:46.820
all these million places.
And um,
you know,

813
00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:51.570
a lot of it's Mommy's asking questions.
And most of them were like,
Hey Hitler,

814
00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:54.060
just wondering blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And the girls were like,

815
00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:56.760
why is everybody saying,
Hey Hitler,

816
00:54:58.990 --> 00:55:02.800
it's a joke.
My joke book at um,

817
00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:08.240
at Yoga,
I didn't know it and our,
she drove this

818
00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:13.580
and I go,
no,
he goes,
was not your notebook.
I'm like,
well,
I'm like,

819
00:55:13.581 --> 00:55:17.280
this is my notebook.
And he opened it and at the top it says,
Hey,
Hitler.
And I go,

820
00:55:17.281 --> 00:55:21.930
no,
that is mine.
It was like,
this was Hitler and it was yours.

821
00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:26.160
I'm like,
yeah,
that's mine.
Because it was like,

822
00:55:26.161 --> 00:55:30.240
it was a reminder to tell that story to somebody who knows what goes on my set

823
00:55:30.241 --> 00:55:34.170
list.
A hot dump question.
Hey Mommy's,
you know,

824
00:55:34.171 --> 00:55:37.710
they say if you drink milk with spicy foods,
it takes away some of the slicey.

825
00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:40.980
I'm wondering if you were to pour milk on how you say asshole,

826
00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:45.060
would it ease the pain of hot dumps?
Think love you at Gabe.

827
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:50.130
What a real thought provoking.
Another really good question.
Gosh,
I mean,

828
00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:55.400
I don't see why it wouldn't if it works on your mouth with spices.
Yeah.

829
00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:59.630
You know what else cools your Heinie is a total washlet three 50 he just

830
00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:01.940
splashing some water on your Heinie.
Yes,

831
00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:07.240
so I'd argue that any liquid really helps keeps your asshole.

832
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:13.920
Oh
crap,
we're out.

833
00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:16.860
It's a good question.

834
00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:21.780
I'm really interested if there's any employers who have hired or been around a

835
00:56:21.781 --> 00:56:25.840
conjoined twin to see if they two salaries because they have separate rights.

836
00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:28.830
They have their own individual rights to separate people.
Yeah.

837
00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:30.610
They have different minds.
So how could you be like,

838
00:56:30.611 --> 00:56:35.170
well we're just going to pay you this one thing.
They are two separate entities.

839
00:56:35.171 --> 00:56:37.840
They are two separate people with different social security number.

840
00:56:37.841 --> 00:56:41.330
Fascinating question,
right?
Yeah,
they have,
I'm sure they have,
you know,

841
00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:46.120
license not dry or I don't think it can.
They drive.
Who's the driver?

842
00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:50.800
I Dunno.
How do you wipe if you have no arms that came in?
Damn it.

843
00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:51.380
Oh second.

844
00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:54.640
Such a good dump today began thinking about people who are unable to have such a

845
00:56:54.641 --> 00:56:58.300
time when the toilet,
my pondering of poop brought me to this question.

846
00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:01.180
How do people without arms wipe their ass?
I'm really at a loss here.

847
00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:06.400
I what I'm really at a loss at is not how they wipe at all.

848
00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:08.530
How do you wipe outside of the home?

849
00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:11.020
Because I'm sure there's a system you would set up at home.

850
00:57:11.050 --> 00:57:12.590
You know there would be something like,

851
00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:15.890
even though I don't want to rag on it something,
I don't know off the top of my,

852
00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:19.150
but yeah,
I can imagine that there is something you would set up,
right?

853
00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:21.400
Like a day in a,
in uh,

854
00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:25.540
some device pushed the button for the big day.
It's a great question.

855
00:57:25.541 --> 00:57:27.160
I mean these are,
you know,
I'm saying that,

856
00:57:27.161 --> 00:57:31.180
but there's something if the no arm people out there are going to find us and

857
00:57:31.181 --> 00:57:35.230
let us know there's some system but it's more interesting to me is like what

858
00:57:35.231 --> 00:57:38.230
about an emergency dump out on the town?

859
00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:40.660
That's really curious.

860
00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:43.760
<v 6>I mean,
I'm guessing alone if your arm less,</v>

861
00:57:43.761 --> 00:57:47.880
you might have a helper with you at all times.
No.

862
00:57:47.881 --> 00:57:52.450
And then how do you,
how do you get it wrong?
Oh No,

863
00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:56.060
I guess you can take an Uber now or most people don't have helpers.

864
00:57:56.790 --> 00:58:00.080
I'd have a helper if I were aren't sure,

865
00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:03.740
can't reach anything.
How are you going to,

866
00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:06.920
how are you going to get your iPhone out and hit Uber?

867
00:58:07.310 --> 00:58:11.060
Come get ya know arms.
Why is that a ridiculous question?

868
00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:14.650
<v 2>They don't have helpers if like a prosthetic and they,
you know,
if they don't,</v>

869
00:58:14.651 --> 00:58:15.820
they still can.
You can.

870
00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:19.600
You can walk around and do what you need to do without an arm.
No arm,

871
00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:23.800
two arms missing.
I don't have a helper.
This person did not mention prosthetics.

872
00:58:23.801 --> 00:58:26.710
I'm literally imagining somebody with no arms right now.

873
00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:28.510
They still don't be like,
I don't have arms.

874
00:58:28.511 --> 00:58:32.560
I need a full time caregiver is not how that works because they would still,

875
00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:36.250
they make do without their arms.
What's interesting is how they do it.

876
00:58:36.251 --> 00:58:40.180
It's not a helper,
not a helper.
I don't know much about the armless Kim.

877
00:58:40.181 --> 00:58:43.030
I'm just saying it's a fascinating question.
It is a fascinating question.

878
00:58:43.031 --> 00:58:46.720
If you're black and you want to rent free lifestyle,
fuck me,

879
00:58:46.721 --> 00:58:50.290
come over here and fuck me right now.
Piss on me.
Slap me,

880
00:58:50.291 --> 00:58:51.820
hit me in my eyes.

881
00:58:51.821 --> 00:58:55.960
He went to try it out and try it out and let's look a piss on me.
Try it out.

882
00:58:56.160 --> 00:59:00.580
It's just going to as fuck,
man.
I'm looking for hardcore guys.
We know you are.

883
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:05.320
I want him to deliver it.
I'm a hot salt by trash.
Come down for this.
Fuck

884
00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:09.970
his teeth.
Don't look good either and nothing's going on good.

885
00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:14.950
God's love the fuck.
Fuck.
Look,
if you're a hot black,

886
00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:19.850
<v 6>got it.
Who Do you think is creepy?
Okay.
Would you rather,</v>

887
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:22.430
would you rather

888
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:27.290
<v 2>your a hot black guy?
Would you rather bang ugly?
Ron,
Jeremy?</v>

889
00:59:27.310 --> 00:59:31.660
Yeah,
and Ron.
Jeremy.
So good.
This is his retarded brother.
Yeah.

890
00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:32.961
Dawn,
Jeremy.

891
00:59:32.961 --> 00:59:37.961
So would you either bang this Guy Don Jeremy or the 2016 Benadryl Guy?

892
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:43.730
Oh my God,
he's,
they're both super horny.
Okay.
It's a filler of sealer shut.

893
00:59:44.110 --> 00:59:47.710
Here's the thing,
Taylor up.
Are you doing the 16 Benadryl guy or this general?

894
00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:51.810
As always,
I applaud you and your impromptu filler ups and would you,

895
00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:53.020
you're really gifted at this.

896
00:59:53.330 --> 00:59:56.330
This is what I would take for the networks to pitch.
If I were you,

897
00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.040
if you were pitching ideas,
you know,

898
00:59:58.041 --> 01:00:02.840
I am looking to pitch show a dog dog deck afternoon.

899
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:06.830
Yeah.
Thanks.
Yeah,
right.

900
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:07.881
Wait a minute.

901
01:00:07.881 --> 01:00:11.900
What about I'm gum gum gum with the chewables with the man love in the middle,

902
01:00:11.901 --> 01:00:16.760
right?
Good idea.
Liking,
farting on dogs' heads is another TV show so far.

903
01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:21.590
I mean,
I could see NBC,
ABC,
Fox,
CBS.
Where else are you going to take this thing?

904
01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:25.970
The only,
the big ones are not a k.
These are broadcast network shows.

905
01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:31.490
Yeah.
Okay.
So who are you going to bang?
Is it the 16 Benadryl?

906
01:00:31.491 --> 01:00:35.600
Here's why it's interesting to me.
Um,
that's super hardy.

907
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:38.390
Here's the good news.
They're both enthusiastic lovers.

908
01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:42.500
They're both definitely not.
Not horny.
You're right.
Um,

909
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.110
so for charge,
just to remind people who you're talking about,

910
01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:52.650
<v 8>just the people
who don't</v>

911
01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:56.880
want to be horny for two or three hours,

912
01:00:56.881 --> 01:01:00.870
like you've never been in your life and you have access to marijuana too.

913
01:01:01.770 --> 01:01:05.490
Good.
We'd listen to me.
Okay,
true.

914
01:01:05.491 --> 01:01:09.480
We'd alone can get you really hornier than normal,
but it's been on drill.

915
01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:11.420
Take about 10 12 minutes.

916
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:14.820
Girl before you want to have your sexual fun with your partner or whatever you

917
01:01:14.821 --> 01:01:16.570
do or masturbate.
All right.
Yeah.

918
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.360
<v 2>So true.
So this guy have a heart attack.</v>

919
01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:26.410
Go to the hospital at this hundred yard stare that's permanently in the eyes.
Um,

920
01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:31.470
there's definitely plans and plots on the wall behind him of people that take

921
01:01:31.471 --> 01:01:35.490
out,
um,
him and his manager elements weak.
And that's closet though.

922
01:01:35.491 --> 01:01:40.270
He does have a nice closet behind it.
He's,
he's followed fucking gas for above.

923
01:01:40.271 --> 01:01:43.260
Allude led a laughing gas or whatever it,
so it's him.

924
01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:47.880
Do I want to fuck him or

925
01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:51.630
<v 0>lady the laying down,
you know,</v>

926
01:01:51.631 --> 01:01:54.910
homeless or rum or thug on the calm.

927
01:01:55.290 --> 01:02:00.160
[inaudible] it's frank along with your man free range.
You can fuck me.
Piss.

928
01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:04.080
Somebody beat me.
Oh Man.
Now I see me when I come up with today and try it out.

929
01:02:04.081 --> 01:02:04.914
Try it out,
man.

930
01:02:05.530 --> 01:02:07.870
<v 2>Yeah,
I mean,
there two great.
You know,</v>

931
01:02:07.871 --> 01:02:10.600
we got to do a style to different styles.

932
01:02:10.601 --> 01:02:14.650
You know what I wish we could do is like a dating game where we can match the

933
01:02:14.651 --> 01:02:19.000
perfect homeless person with either of these gentlemen.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No,
that's good.

934
01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:22.640
And they answer questions,
but you know,
this is silly fun.

935
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:28.650
Where,
I mean,
we could add a third.
How about the fuck me in my ass?
No,

936
01:02:28.651 --> 01:02:31.830
let's keep it to the homeless guy gets raped by gay ghosts.
No,

937
01:02:32.330 --> 01:02:37.330
I think it's good to keep it to the two guys that can string sentences together.

938
01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:43.710
But
who are you going forward?
It's a good,

939
01:02:43.711 --> 01:02:48.420
it's really good because they're both alarming individuals and terrifying in

940
01:02:48.421 --> 01:02:51.990
different ways.
See,
I think a lot of people

941
01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:56.880
terrifying in different ways is an excellent frame.
Yeah.
Yeah.

942
01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.810
A lot of people would in this situation would be like,
I'm staying away from the,

943
01:03:00.811 --> 01:03:04.620
fuck me for free rent.
Black eyes.
Oof.
Why is that?
Well,
it's just,

944
01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:07.320
it seems so direct and aggressive.
Sure.

945
01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:12.000
And the aggression can be off putting to some people.
You say you go,
you go,
oh,

946
01:03:12.001 --> 01:03:15.420
the Benadryl guy.
He's pretty chill.
He's just sitting on the couch.

947
01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:17.130
He's just like,
smoke some weed.

948
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:21.150
But that guy has some really,

949
01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:26.300
really scary things going on that you didn't necessarily see in that video.

950
01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:32.040
Luckily for us,
we have more than one video of him.

951
01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:37.041
Do you think he's making a suit out of lady skin and he's got a girl in a,

952
01:03:38.101 --> 01:03:38.580
well,

953
01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:42.990
I think the Benadryl guy's scary or actually I think there's a lot below the

954
01:03:42.991 --> 01:03:44.890
surface.
That's what I'm saying.
The Ben Underground,
he,

955
01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:48.060
he's got a girl that he's starving to make a lady's dress out of fun.

956
01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:52.320
<v 8>I would never see,
my family tried to get me to watch regular porn.</v>

957
01:03:52.321 --> 01:03:55.400
They call it fuck you in your porn and your,

958
01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:59.190
the way you make out and your stupid boring fucking bullshit.

959
01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:05.020
<v 2>Okay.
This guy in a cabin with the [inaudible] that only he has the key to.</v>

960
01:04:05.370 --> 01:04:07.330
Is this the end of your life?
For sure,

961
01:04:08.410 --> 01:04:11.530
but wait in the free rent guys like beat the piss out of me.

962
01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:15.610
But that's what he's saying too.
He's like,
I don't like regular.
No,
no worries.

963
01:04:15.611 --> 01:04:18.010
I like wild stuff and what's wrong with you?

964
01:04:18.011 --> 01:04:20.740
But the other guy likes wild stuff too.
You wanted to be adventurous.

965
01:04:20.741 --> 01:04:25.450
You like that.
The other guys direct in that he wants basically to be submissive.

966
01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:29.350
He wants you to be a very dominant and aggressive.

967
01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:34.540
This guy,
you like that now you like taking the lead.
I don't know.

968
01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:37.110
That's your thing.
You're always,
when I,

969
01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:39.350
I'm thinking the only thing that's going to,

970
01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:41.470
I'm going to prom with the other guys.
I'm not black.

971
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:45.850
That's going to piss him off.
Well,
okay,
let's,
let's lift that.
No Lamborghini.

972
01:04:46.410 --> 01:04:49.060
Amy,
let's left that requirement for this.

973
01:04:49.061 --> 01:04:52.540
For the sake of this fellow reps sealer shut.
Yeah.
Um,

974
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:56.560
and now this guy's a serial killer.
You like serial killer?
No.
No.

975
01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:00.740
I like watching shows about them.
I don't like them.
You like them creepy?
No,

976
01:05:00.790 --> 01:05:02.760
the two of you could talk about kilometers.

977
01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:07.620
<v 8>All of your own by your woman.
You're all a bunch of fucking pieces of shit.</v>

978
01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:10.860
God doesn't love those many of you anymore.

979
01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:16.480
Here I am on the planet with your mother fucker.
Hmm.

980
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:20.020
<v 6>Have a good day,
mother fucker.</v>

981
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:22.770
<v 2>Oh,
that's how my mom used to end her letters to me.
Huh?</v>

982
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:27.920
The pupils are wild.
It is in the eyes with this guy.

983
01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:32.240
He's severely mentally ill or just whacked out on the drugs.

984
01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.540
The drugs aren't helping the mental decline,
let's put it that way.

985
01:05:35.570 --> 01:05:40.040
I think I'd have to fuck the guy that wants to get pissed off for food and good

986
01:05:40.041 --> 01:05:44.060
news.
Free Rent.
Bring that part.
I got a mortgage.
Jesus,

987
01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:49.520
you're saving cash with that guy.
The mustache guy.
Uh,
you're having a good time.

988
01:05:49.521 --> 01:05:52.220
Everyone.
It's a win win.
You pick up my lambo payments.

989
01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:55.170
<v 6>I don't know if he's capable of that.
Yeah,</v>

990
01:05:55.650 --> 01:06:00.330
but I mean he is giving you something too,
which is nice.

991
01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.640
Free Rent.
You Andy.
You can bring a friend

992
01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:10.040
least in a kid.
Fuck me.
You get a lease in a key.
Yeah.

993
01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:10.993
Wow.

994
01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:14.450
<v 2>Now and you can also bring a buddy along.
So which buddy are you bringing along?</v>

995
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:18.290
Oh,
that's interesting.
I'd be either bringing along bird or

996
01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:23.570
sickle cell or Ari,
you know,
any,

997
01:06:23.571 --> 01:06:27.170
any of those dudes would be down.
I mean Ari's kind of homeless all the time.

998
01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:30.200
Yeah.
He kind of has like a homeless guy.
Vibes.
Yeah,
he does.

999
01:06:30.201 --> 01:06:34.840
He looks how much this guy,
sorry.
Yeah.
Oh for sure.
On the block.

1000
01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:38.420
He'd be like,
yeah,
but you look dirty and you look like you.

1001
01:06:38.421 --> 01:06:42.500
You know you live on the street and he's like,
you come in here,
piss on me.

1002
01:06:42.501 --> 01:06:44.700
Fuck me for rent.
I'll do.

1003
01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:48.290
Is this an airbnb over or I'll do it.
I'll do it.

1004
01:06:48.590 --> 01:06:52.340
<v 6>Yeah.
Now see I,
oh man.
If I were a guy,</v>

1005
01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:53.950
I guess in order to fill up concealer shut,

1006
01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.610
I would have to be a guy in this scenario

1007
01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:02.030
<v 2>to go with you on this one because I am afraid that the Benadryl guy,</v>

1008
01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:07.400
you cut you up so you would,
you would piss on and beat the other guy.

1009
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:08.960
Sure.
And put a strap on and on.

1010
01:07:08.961 --> 01:07:12.890
It's free rent antibody gets to come along and he once he wants to be nailed.

1011
01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:18.140
<v 6>Sure.
You do the strap on
big powerful strap on.</v>

1012
01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:19.640
No prob.
Yeah.
Nope.

1013
01:07:19.641 --> 01:07:24.480
I'll practice before I go in on the levers here in front of me.
I don't know.

1014
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:29.570
We went,
let me practice on,
you know,
bay.
We're talking lambo payments.
He said,

1015
01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.370
I don't think he could take over those payments.

1016
01:07:32.370 --> 01:07:35.460
What's your other payments payment?
Let's talk about the payments.

1017
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:37.850
Payments on a Lamborghini,
you're doing it all wrong.

1018
01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:42.500
If it's three 2150 that's ridiculous.

1019
01:07:43.310 --> 01:07:48.310
You put 10,000 down and then your mother please only like 20 grand.

1020
01:07:49.070 --> 01:07:49.903
Let's do the math.

1021
01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:56.450
It's preposterous if you can't,
if you're not a multimillionaire,

1022
01:07:56.451 --> 01:08:00.020
your car loan calculator.
Okay,

1023
01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.230
a hundred and fifth she's retarded.

1024
01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:06.920
<v 2>Yeah.
$350,000 Yamble let's say how many months?</v>

1025
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:12.850
Because they tell you it's really stupid to do longer than like 36 let's do the

1026
01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:16.070
financial advisors telling you like,
you know,
pay

1027
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:18.550
<v 5>it off within two to three years.
So let's say three years,</v>

1028
01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:21.740
three year Lamborghini,
because otherwise you're paying way too much in interest.

1029
01:08:21.741 --> 01:08:26.030
So sure,
let's do 36 we're all about the value with this,
you know,

1030
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:26.923
3% interest.

1031
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.390
<v 6>Sure.
All right.
Let's see.</v>

1032
01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:32.613
All right,

1033
01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:37.790
<v 5>so it's a pretty good deal.
I mean,
that's a low interest rate.
Yeah.
36 months.</v>

1034
01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:42.940
They're loaning you $350,000 so your monthly payments are only $10,178 a month

1035
01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:48.410
<v 6>for your car,
for your car.
Makes Sense.
Yeah.</v>

1036
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:50.750
And then you're talking great mileage on the gas.

1037
01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:53.080
<v 5>I know I drove it.</v>

1038
01:08:53.230 --> 01:08:57.070
I think I drove at 60 miles and I took down a little over a quarter of a tank.

1039
01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:59.250
So yeah.
I mean you're filling up pretty often.

1040
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:05.680
<v 6>You're filling it up like every day.
Yeah,
like pretty much every day.</v>

1041
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:10.640
Every other day you're filling up your tank.
How it like $60 a pop?

1042
01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:13.790
I don't know.
Fill up.
Yeah,
it's good.

1043
01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:18.810
You can only take a one person that on the 10 grand a your mind loan.

1044
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:20.300
What about insurance too?

1045
01:09:20.301 --> 01:09:24.470
It's going to be not a joke to ensure if you're insuring a house,

1046
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:29.720
it's crazy.
How expensive?
$10,000 a month for a car.

1047
01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.460
That is bananas.
Yeah,

1048
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.110
that is.
That is a huge mortgage payment.
It's pretty well,
thank goodness

1049
01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:45.590
we can do that.
That's crazy.
Yeah,
man.
Okay,

1050
01:09:45.591 --> 01:09:48.290
let's see this,
but I will say that Lamborghini,

1051
01:09:48.291 --> 01:09:51.950
that that is just for the pleasure of it.
There is no utility in a Lamborghini.

1052
01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:56.960
It is all just for fun
is all pleasure and joy,

1053
01:09:56.961 --> 01:09:59.990
which well,
you know,
I don't,
I don't know anything about that.

1054
01:10:01.190 --> 01:10:02.023
What are you looking at now?

1055
01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:06.600
<v 5>Trying to figure out the um,
what the insurance would be,
but yeah,</v>

1056
01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:08.290
<v 6>too much information assurance,</v>

1057
01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:11.840
especially in California where there's so many uninsured motorists cause that's

1058
01:10:11.841 --> 01:10:14.720
what you're paying for is the people that don't have insurance.

1059
01:10:15.230 --> 01:10:16.041
Could you imagine,

1060
01:10:16.041 --> 01:10:20.750
could you imagine getting hit in that car and then you got to replace the

1061
01:10:20.751 --> 01:10:22.540
fucking the door that goes right.

1062
01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:25.630
<v 5>I go cause I was telling him,
I was like,</v>

1063
01:10:25.631 --> 01:10:30.631
it's so crazy to get into this business you have of buying exotic cars and then

1064
01:10:31.271 --> 01:10:36.160
renting them cause your overhead like to get into the business is like $5

1065
01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:38.290
million,
right?
Because yeah he has like Rolls Royce,

1066
01:10:38.291 --> 01:10:41.440
Bentley's Ferrari's Maserati's you know,
like all these exotic cars.

1067
01:10:41.441 --> 01:10:45.010
And he was like,
yeah,
it's crazy.
And I was like,
it's just so much fun.
He goes,

1068
01:10:45.011 --> 01:10:49.150
oh yeah,
when the transmission uh,
blue on one of these land bows,

1069
01:10:49.210 --> 01:10:52.630
it was a $45,000 to fix the transmission.

1070
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:56.220
That's like a service on these things is no joke.
It

1071
01:10:56.220 --> 01:11:01.220
<v 6>does make me think how many people in la are doing that exact thing that they</v>

1072
01:11:01.231 --> 01:11:05.770
are just renting these fancy cars now that I think it's a lot.
It's a lot.
Yeah.

1073
01:11:05.771 --> 01:11:08.130
And now that I'm like,
oh,
what's that guy doing with a Ferrari?

1074
01:11:08.131 --> 01:11:12.120
Like these people are probably renting.
There's a lot of renters.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1075
01:11:12.121 --> 01:11:14.250
He told me how like the business

1076
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:17.700
<v 5>does.
Well,
yeah.
Especially in Beverly Hills and you know,</v>

1077
01:11:17.701 --> 01:11:22.040
people want to look like,
you know,
where it's more obvious when you,
if you,
uh,

1078
01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:24.930
want to pay attention to how it's going.

1079
01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:30.740
If you see a Lamborghini or Ferrari on a residential street that's probably

1080
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:36.390
owned when you see them parked or up and down road day.

1081
01:11:36.410 --> 01:11:40.500
Oh.
And that whole thing,
that's a renter.
That's somebody who got it for a trip,

1082
01:11:40.501 --> 01:11:43.020
which is,
I understand that.
Like I came to La,

1083
01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:46.350
I'm going to drive up rich people boulevard and I'm going to get this crazy,

1084
01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:51.330
crazy car.
Yeah.
Let's go shopping at the,

This is super exciting.

1087
01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:02.670
We've been working on this for a minute and it's finally here.

1088
01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:04.620
We've talked about it for a while.

1089
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:08.820
We have a holiday collection of,
uh,

1090
01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:13.110
your mom's house related products coming out.

1091
01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:17.220
They're out now.
A couple of them are on sale,
a couple of presale.

1092
01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:20.700
So this first one was the big one.

1093
01:12:20.701 --> 01:12:25.701
This is our first ever Christmas sweater and it is uh,

1094
01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:32.400
amazing.
It is one of the best things I have ever seen.

1095
01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:36.150
It's a,
it's a Christmas,

1096
01:12:36.151 --> 01:12:41.151

1097
01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:45.820
and he's wearing his jeans.
And here's what's really cool about this.
Um,

1098
01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:50.900
100% of the profit that comes from the Santa Claus wears jeans.

1099
01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:56.540
Christmas sweater will go to the children's Hospital of Los Angeles.

1100
01:12:56.850 --> 01:12:59.760
We're going to donate to their toy program,

1101
01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:03.570
wonder kids that are in the hospital and we'll document it.

1102
01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:08.080
So it's not just like you have just believe it.
We're going to,
uh,

1103
01:13:08.610 --> 01:13:13.610

1104
01:13:14.521 --> 01:13:16.740

There's no better cause.

1105
01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:19.800
No better cause I'm so please check it out.

1106
01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:24.860
Go to Tom segura.com and click on my store or go to Merck method.com/

1107
01:13:26.250 --> 01:13:30.300
[inaudible] we also have,
um,
a couple other,

1108
01:13:30.301 --> 01:13:33.170
this red Christmas sweater.
The Santa Claus wears jeans,

1109
01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:36.580
it's red and it's got the white stitching of like snowflakes and it's got a

1110
01:13:36.581 --> 01:13:41.040
college.
So cool.
And it's a,
it's a real Christmas sweater.

1111
01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:44.850
You're going to wear it.
You're actually going to wear the hat,

1112
01:13:44.851 --> 01:13:48.850
the winter hat with the little ball on top with snowflakes.

1113
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:52.890
And it says Santa Claus wears jeans.
Course.
That's,
um,
very fun.

1114
01:13:52.891 --> 01:13:55.260
And then this is something that like I've held onto,

1115
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:57.930
I wanted to do this for years and I finally did it.

1116
01:13:58.170 --> 01:14:02.790
We're doing Christmas sweatshirts as well in different colors,
white,

1117
01:14:02.850 --> 01:14:03.780
green,
and red.

1118
01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:08.520
And who are you to tell me what Santa Claus looks like?
Is My,

1119
01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:13.910
so now we have Santa is black Hashtag IMH right?

1120
01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:17.980
You don't know my pronoun?
Yeah,
don't assume it.
Um,

1121
01:14:18.190 --> 01:14:23.120
we have Santa Claus is Asian.
No.

1122
01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:26.050
Yes,
I love it.
He is.

1123
01:14:26.610 --> 01:14:30.920
<v 6>Oh,
that's great.
Santa Claus is Asian.
Santa Claus is black.
I love it.
Yeah.</v>

1124
01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:35.390
<v 5>And we also have,
for me at my nose,</v>

1125
01:14:35.790 --> 01:14:40.790
we have Santa Claus is Latino and a green and he's wearing a sombrero and

1126
01:14:42.481 --> 01:14:45.570
hashtag ways anyways,
so it's awesome.
Like I said,

1127
01:14:45.571 --> 01:14:49.110
some of these our presale and they'll ship and like,
uh,

1128
01:14:49.230 --> 01:14:52.470
about three and a half weeks.
Some of these are on sale,

1129
01:14:52.471 --> 01:14:56.500
meaning they'll ship and less time,
maybe two weeks.
So that's our whole,

1130
01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:59.190
<v 6>get them.
Now what's you're saying is get them now before the,</v>

1131
01:14:59.210 --> 01:15:02.260
it gets really cold and before the holidays really,
you're can't get your

1132
01:15:02.410 --> 01:15:06.250
<v 5>Christmas stuff now.
Um,

Uh,
you know,
uh,</v>

1133
01:15:06.670 --> 01:15:11.670
Christmas present if your significant other is a podcast fan or you just want to

1134
01:15:11.711 --> 01:15:16.000
have like a more unique holiday sweater or sweatshirt.
Uh,
the hat is awesome.

1135
01:15:16.001 --> 01:15:16.930
I have the hat,
they should,

1136
01:15:16.931 --> 01:15:20.140
they shipped it to us and I tell you the quality of all of these items,

1137
01:15:20.170 --> 01:15:23.240
Primo quality is impeccable.
But I have the hat,
yeah.
In the,

1138
01:15:23.241 --> 01:15:26.620
in our bedroom and it's fantastic.
And again,
what was the sweater?

1139
01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:31.300
All of them were great.
Santa Claus wears jeans.
The,
uh,
the sweater is incredible.

1140
01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:36.250
All going to a children's charity.
That's awesome too.
Right?
Yeah.
Very cool.

1141
01:15:36.370 --> 01:15:38.450
So very proud of that charity.
Um,

1142
01:15:39.130 --> 01:15:44.130
now to one of the more exciting things that we have come across in some time

1143
01:15:44.591 --> 01:15:49.510
here on this show,
I'm very happy to bring to your attention.

1144
01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:56.140
Nope.
That did not go as planned gene.
Hmm.

1145
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:59.710
Here it is.
Try it again.
Uh,
I screwed it up.
I muted it for a second.

1146
01:15:59.711 --> 01:16:00.544
You know what happened?
Yeah.

1147
01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:04.210
<v 14>I other shoe dropping in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein's sexual harassment</v>

1148
01:16:04.211 --> 01:16:08.110
scandal and Golfing Hollywood,
new accusations against action stars.

1149
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.870
No Daily Mail TV brings to light an audio tape and which the gal reveals his

1150
01:16:13.871 --> 01:16:17.320
outrageously profane attitude towards female journalists.

1151
01:16:18.270 --> 01:16:21.010
<v 5>Uh
Huh.</v>

1152
01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:24.920
<v 15>Uh,
had a hard time.
That was</v>

1153
01:16:26.490 --> 01:16:30.390
somebody who on a promotional tour,
he's there to talk about it,

1154
01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:32.880
fortunately about who you were.

1155
01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:39.340
Do you know who his wife for 10 years ago or they should go into pornography or

1156
01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:43.050
journalism if they want to hear that.

1157
01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:49.280
<v 5>So unfortunately the,
the bleeps were unavoidable.
Sure.</v>

1158
01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:54.140
I hate playing censored stuff on this podcast.
But,
um,

1159
01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:56.780
that's,
that's the only version that exists right now.

1160
01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:00.950
<v 15>Some of the women aren't there.</v>

1161
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:04.480
Why do you think because of the subject matter most women don't like,

1162
01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:10.210
I won't even do it telling you what I think is good.
Um,
dumb.

1163
01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:13.003
Uh,

1164
01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:17.640
there's a buyer and wanted it to be taken off flavors here again,

1165
01:17:17.670 --> 01:17:20.090
October 3rd place.
I think he belongs in to do

1166
01:17:20.770 --> 01:17:23.410
<v 2>so.
What this is,
this is all related to a story that broke,
you know,</v>

1167
01:17:23.411 --> 01:17:27.320
it's like everyone's being taken down right now for sexual harassment.
Yeah.

1168
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:28.263
You know,
all these things.

1169
01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:33.700
So there's a story that came that a woman who auditioned for one,
uh,
when,
when,

1170
01:17:33.701 --> 01:17:38.370
when he was like,
you know,
making big $100 million,
whatever it makes or not.
Now,

1171
01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:40.210
yeah,
now they're like thousand dollar budgets.

1172
01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:44.020
But when he is doing those about 20 years ago,
um,

1173
01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:47.770
a woman claims that she was got the call,
like,
oh,

1174
01:17:48.190 --> 01:17:51.370
so called considering you for the lead,
you need to go to his house.

1175
01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:55.000
And she had the wherewithal to bring the casting director with her.

1176
01:17:55.570 --> 01:17:59.920
And he answered in like a silk robe and he just sat in a chair and watched her

1177
01:18:00.010 --> 01:18:04.390
audition.
And then when she left she got the call that like,

1178
01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:05.800
oh Stephen thought you did great.

1179
01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:10.420
He needs you to come back to do a private rehearsal.
Oh yeah.

1180
01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:13.960
All the private rehearsal in the row.
Any stolen his robe for it.

1181
01:18:14.170 --> 01:18:18.070
Well she turned it down.
Okay.
And so he gave her like a one line part.

1182
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:19.690
Wow.

1183
01:18:19.690 --> 01:18:23.470
This story came out a couple of weeks ago and this stuff is in relation to those

1184
01:18:23.471 --> 01:18:26.990
stories.
Like the wow him telling somebody else about that.
Yeah.

1185
01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:34.770
<v 15>And
you and all this and that</v>

1186
01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:38.200
gentleman and you know,
I don't believe,

1187
01:18:38.670 --> 01:18:42.750
how can you come back the way you come at it,
not ever doing interview again.

1188
01:18:46.410 --> 01:18:51.360
<v 2>Damn.
He's so mad at her for for this.
Yeah.
Cause this,</v>

1189
01:18:51.361 --> 01:18:52.980
you know this bad press man,

1190
01:18:52.981 --> 01:18:57.680
there's no sure and Stevens used to a very high standard of good press.
Yeah.

1191
01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:02.310
Being a Russian recent citizen and,
and uh,
you know,

1192
01:19:02.690 --> 01:19:05.280
a of sorts and you know,

1193
01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:09.390
he's a talented guy and I am the king of in province for,
for you mind saying,

1194
01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:14.700
Geez,
hang of Improv,
you know?
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.
Wow.

1195
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:19.680
Who Knew?
Man?
I,
I really hope he does more.
He was like this.
I do too.

1196
01:19:19.681 --> 01:19:20.820
I was just looking at the,

1197
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:25.870
his photo there without the jet black mustache and the jet black.

1198
01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:30.250
I think he might look better if he shaved that off.
Just cut it all off.
Right.

1199
01:19:30.450 --> 01:19:34.460
But keep the,
the um,
the gun range.
Yellow sunglasses.
No.
Right.

1200
01:19:34.650 --> 01:19:37.320
He stopped wearing those.
He has little ones now.

1201
01:19:37.410 --> 01:19:40.890
He went to the John Lennon's yeah,
the tiny spectacles.
Those are good.

1202
01:19:40.891 --> 01:19:42.840
Look much better.
And the,

1203
01:19:43.150 --> 01:19:47.370
the hair piece is darker and more full than it was.
I liked that too.

1204
01:19:48.810 --> 01:19:50.730
I mean,
I,
you know,
Ryan Sickler,

1205
01:19:50.731 --> 01:19:55.731
our good friend had a goatee for 15 years and he just shaved it off about a year

1206
01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:59.220
ago.
Yeah.
He looks 10 years younger.
I just saw him,

1207
01:19:59.221 --> 01:20:01.320
I did the crab feast of weeks ago.

1208
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:04.710
And I mean it's like a different man.
Yeah.

1209
01:20:04.770 --> 01:20:08.040
I think there is an age where you should take off the,
yeah.

1210
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:12.600
<v 6>Yeah.
Well,
I mean he's just staging him.
It's not good.
Yeah.
Just be fat.</v>

1211
01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:16.570
I mean at this point it might look better just to have a fat face.
Right.

1212
01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:21.090
And the way that the Harris cut,
it's actually making his cheeks look puffier.

1213
01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:26.440
He needs to either grow,
expand the width of that.
A beard.
Oh my God.

1214
01:20:26.650 --> 01:20:31.230
Her just cut it off or lose weight.
I could do that.
Oh my God.

1215
01:20:31.231 --> 01:20:35.820
He looks great.
We've,
yeah.
Oh that's bad.
It's so dark.

1216
01:20:36.510 --> 01:20:40.650
It's so,
so dark.
Who's his plugs aren't,
aren't,
aren't good.
Oh my God.

1217
01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:42.660
He's wearing his guid and meat poutine.

1218
01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:44.510
<v 5>Yeah.
Vladimir Putin.</v>

1219
01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:49.160
He's wearing a fucking g to the Kremlin or whatever it is.

1220
01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:53.750
He's eating a carrot.
Sure.
Such a weird,
and he looks so weird.

1221
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:56.420
Such a weird look that he's got going.
Yeah.

1222
01:20:56.450 --> 01:20:58.380
Those tiny glasses that he would look at him back then.

1223
01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:03.740
Look how much thinner he was here.
Yeah,
that's him.
That's him in his heyday.

1224
01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:08.060
That's not Yani.
No nuts.
Does Steven ago.
You gotta be kidding me.

1225
01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:11.150
It's back in the days when it was attractive.
Well,
your eyes,

1226
01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:15.860
he was fucking superstar,
man.
He looks terrible.

1227
01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:19.400
But that one,
that one interview he did,
uh,

1228
01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:21.800
he had those crazy,

1229
01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:27.130
crazy glasses on that whereas here it is.
There's one is right?

1230
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:31.950
<v 6>Yeah.
It looks like a cartoon character.
Look good.
Look here.
This isn't,</v>

1231
01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:36.240
how long ago was that?
That's old.
Because he was handsome.
Yeah,
of course.
Yeah.

1232
01:21:36.241 --> 01:21:38.520
Take this,
take the facial hair off.

1233
01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:41.220
How are you going to act like you didn't know he was handsome.
I didn't really,

1234
01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:44.350
I did not know
the guy.

1235
01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:48.710
You see what that makes them look 10 times crazier.
You know,
it's not,

1236
01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:53.570
it's not helping him to wear the Geeky and the glasses in public.
It's just,

1237
01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:56.700
this is not that.
You're just look crazy.
No.

1238
01:21:56.701 --> 01:21:59.580
You need to normalize the look a little.
Yeah,
I agree.

1239
01:21:59.910 --> 01:22:02.370
I don't even feel like he just needs to look more normal.

1240
01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:05.680
<v 5>Yeah.
You know,
when you start,</v>

1241
01:22:05.681 --> 01:22:10.360
you start to do crazier other things to distract from your body,
going to shit.

1242
01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:14.810
What happens is like he's just gained so much weight that he's like,
you know,

1243
01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:16.660
grow this.
Put some sunglasses look.

1244
01:22:16.670 --> 01:22:21.500
Cause you're trying to distract from from things going to shit,
you know?
Yeah.

1245
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:23.080
Yeah.
I mean

1246
01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:27.630
<v 6>it's just so,
you know,</v>

1247
01:22:27.631 --> 01:22:30.690
we were talking about it today as we were driving around the neighborhood and we

1248
01:22:30.691 --> 01:22:35.691
saw a man wearing like those Kava Ricci pants from the 90s and then he had a

1249
01:22:36.541 --> 01:22:39.930
belt and then the shirt tucked in to the,
the,

1250
01:22:40.030 --> 01:22:44.640
the terrible nineties pants,
the hammer pants.
And it's because nobody loves him,

1251
01:22:44.641 --> 01:22:45.474
but he loves them.

1252
01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:50.520
And I think the problem was Steven Seagal is that he doesn't have a woman in his

1253
01:22:50.521 --> 01:22:54.960
life who tells him he looks ridiculous or who loves them,
who loves him.

1254
01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:58.200
She looked at any woman in his life is like,
you're that movie star.
Yeah.

1255
01:22:58.380 --> 01:22:59.910
You're the action star.
Go.
You know what you,

1256
01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:04.260
you're handsome without the jet black widow's peak and the jet black goatee.

1257
01:23:04.290 --> 01:23:05.890
You look terrible with that.
Yeah,

1258
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:09.340
<v 2>that's a good point.
It's stupid.
I don't let you out of the House with even,</v>

1259
01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:11.350
you've corrected me.
Silly your time.

1260
01:23:12.230 --> 01:23:15.820
You almost went out of the house the other day to a pitch meeting wearing a

1261
01:23:15.821 --> 01:23:19.330
denim button down shirt and the denim pants.
But I mean I'm your,

1262
01:23:19.331 --> 01:23:21.670
I'm why a mate for life?
Hello?
Yeah,

1263
01:23:21.671 --> 01:23:25.030
but not not to that meaning I didn't let you out of the house.
Cause why?

1264
01:23:26.050 --> 01:23:28.150
Cause why?
Cause you love me.
Yes,
that's right.

1265
01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:32.320
Thank you Jean Haler I haven't a in Los a question that came in.

1266
01:23:32.650 --> 01:23:35.850
I have an in law that is quite heavy handed with the,
you know what I mean?
Oh,

1267
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:38.290
am I supposed to answer?
Yes,
I know what you mean.

1268
01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:41.050
Every time I'm asked to follow along with the dumb story,

1269
01:23:41.410 --> 01:23:44.800
at what point am I supposed to stop applying?
What's the etiquette?

1270
01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:48.760
We're taking this kind of blasting.
I mean,
thanks for the giggles,
Roger.

1271
01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:51.400
You know what I'm saying now is that a,
you know what I mean?

1272
01:23:51.401 --> 01:23:55.240
Or you know what I'm saying?
This person says,
you know what I mean?
Fuck.

1273
01:23:55.241 --> 01:24:00.130
You know what I mean?
You know what I mean?
Yeah,

1274
01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:08.320
yeah.
You know what I mean?
You know what I mean?
You know what I mean?
You know,

1275
01:24:08.321 --> 01:24:10.520
and I need to check it out.
You know what I'm saying?
It's a fear,

1276
01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:14.170
you know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
Yo Shit.

1277
01:24:16.030 --> 01:24:20.790
I'm like shit.
You know what I'm saying?
You know I have a job there.

1278
01:24:20.810 --> 01:24:25.330
My life,
I never had a job,
um,
in that jail.

1279
01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:29.290
You know what I'm saying?
I don't know.
I'm like,
you know what I'm saying?

1280
01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:33.330
I feel like,
I feel like you got a,

1281
01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:36.930
you got to kind of leave the,
you know what I means alone.

1282
01:24:36.970 --> 01:24:37.670
You can't really stop it,

1283
01:24:37.670 --> 01:24:42.500
<v 16>man shows at the what,
Mitch?
Yeah,
yeah.
You know what I'm saying?</v>

1284
01:24:42.501 --> 01:24:46.100
We need your home.
Good motherfucker right there.
You know what I'm saying?
So,

1285
01:24:46.250 --> 01:24:47.400
you know what I'm saying?
He's like,
Oh fuck.

1286
01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:51.080
<v 2>It's a ridiculous,
well,
here's the thing.</v>

1287
01:24:51.710 --> 01:24:56.710
One time I was watching a mom discipline her kid who kept saying like,

1288
01:24:58.750 --> 01:25:02.990
um,
this little boy was learning to speak,
right?
What?
Four years old,
so different.

1289
01:25:02.991 --> 01:25:07.820
And he kept going and like,
um,
and like,
um,
and like,
um,
and the mom goes,

1290
01:25:07.821 --> 01:25:12.650
don't stop saying like,
um,
do you don't say like,
um,
and at the time I thought,

1291
01:25:12.651 --> 01:25:14.810
gosh,
it's kind of cruel.
It kind of,

1292
01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:18.030
then it puts this thing in that kid's head like self consciousness.
Yeah.

1293
01:25:18.710 --> 01:25:19.610
Then again,

1294
01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:24.380
it is a verbal tick and until somebody points it out to you,

1295
01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:28.520
you need to become cognizant of it so bad.
Yeah.

1296
01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:32.930
Maybe if he answered him with the same amounts of,
is it,
you know,

1297
01:25:32.990 --> 01:25:35.090
you know what I'm saying?
Or you know,
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

1298
01:25:35.091 --> 01:25:36.750
Maybe if it was like,
well,
you know what I mean?
You know what I mean?

1299
01:25:36.751 --> 01:25:38.510
You know what I mean?
Like as a joke,
I think it would,

1300
01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:41.810
what would be funny is what he's proposing is to go,
yes,
you mean I know,

1301
01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:44.540
I know what you mean.
I know what you mean.
I know what you mean.

1302
01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:48.760
I know what you mean.
I know what you mean.
She's retarded.
Yeah.

1303
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:54.200
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
I was like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

1304
01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:57.260
yes.
I know what you mean.
That's true if he did do that.
Yeah.

1305
01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:58.730
You know what I'm saying?

1306
01:25:58.750 --> 01:26:01.790
Cause there was a time in high school when my BFF Shauna and I,

1307
01:26:01.791 --> 01:26:04.250
we said like a lot cause we're valley girls.

1308
01:26:04.290 --> 01:26:09.020
Yeah there was a point where she and I had to correct each other and we had to,

1309
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:09.890
we had to be like,

1310
01:26:09.890 --> 01:26:13.130
like hey we're saying like way too much and you were calling each other out.

1311
01:26:13.130 --> 01:26:17.360
We were calling each other out because we realized that it had like at like had

1312
01:26:17.361 --> 01:26:21.470
gotten like too far like,
like too far.
And how did,
did it help?

1313
01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:24.140
Cause Shauna,
Shauna brought it up.
I remember she goes,

1314
01:26:24.170 --> 01:26:28.940
I think we're saying like too much bro.
And I was like what?
Like like what?

1315
01:26:29.530 --> 01:26:33.920
Like what bro?
Yeah cause she's like,
she's like we're saying like too much.

1316
01:26:33.921 --> 01:26:34.431
She's like,
she goes,

1317
01:26:34.431 --> 01:26:37.430
oh because I heard my brother on the phone and I think he was saying it,

1318
01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:41.120
you know like,
like,
like,
and then you go,
wait a minute.

1319
01:26:41.121 --> 01:26:44.060
Am I saying that stuff too?
I say like too much now.

1320
01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:48.700
Of course we both were in California.
It's the land of like,
like,
like,

1321
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:52.120
like,
like,
like Bro,
like,
like,
like,
like

1322
01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:54.610
<v 17>no,
we leave,</v>

1323
01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:59.770
we're leaving for the camping trip on the 20th oh boy.

1324
01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:04.690
Any Fain,
mommy,
Daddy,
Nikki

1325
01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:09.020
<v 2>grammatically incorrect.
Me,
Faye,
Danny.</v>

1326
01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:13.010
<v 17>We have a bunch of us going and you and pop are supposed to come.</v>

1327
01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:16.820
What am I going to pay?
Shit,

1328
01:27:17.690 --> 01:27:22.010
they give us all buckets with our names on it for what does that mean?

1329
01:27:22.490 --> 01:27:26.120
Well you can't go in my pocket and I can't go in New York so he don't get germs

1330
01:27:26.130 --> 01:27:28.400
spreading germs spread.

1331
01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:33.460
But where do I put my age on the pocket of my name on it.

1332
01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:38.900
I think you played with just salt.
Why would you say that to me?

1333
01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:44.270
How could I probably go to shit?
The pocket

1334
01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:49.480
and then at the end,
where do you call the shit though?

1335
01:27:53.090 --> 01:27:55.910
Like a tree.
A tree.

1336
01:27:58.140 --> 01:27:58.980
<v 2>Sweet Old Lady.</v>

1337
01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:01.830
It was being told that she's going to have to shit in a bucket if she goes on

1338
01:28:01.831 --> 01:28:05.610
this trip,
man,
you can't ask them old lady to shit in a bucket.
I mean,

1339
01:28:05.611 --> 01:28:09.560
she probably shits in a pan right now,
but not in a bucket you,

1340
01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:14.600
George Hw Bush does to the former president who's been accused of sexual

1341
01:28:15.961 --> 01:28:18.330
harassment.
Poor guy.
Poor guy.

1342
01:28:19.710 --> 01:28:24.450
Why is he the poor guy?
He's old.
What does that supposed to mean?
I mean,

1343
01:28:24.451 --> 01:28:28.730
he can't,
you know,
it can't be held accountable for us for grabbing high knees.

1344
01:28:29.250 --> 01:28:33.120
Are you saying that he should get a free pass because he's old?
Yes.

1345
01:28:33.810 --> 01:28:38.280
I think it's even grosser when it's an old guy.
It's definitely more upsetting.

1346
01:28:39.090 --> 01:28:39.923
Let's see.

1347
01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:45.660
This lady said she saw the president's getting together.

1348
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:52.320
She got a chance to meet him four years ago.
Okay.
He's 93,

1349
01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:56.550
so he was 89 spry 89,

1350
01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:01.020
89 years old.
Um,
he sexually assaulted me.

1351
01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:06.150
Didn't shake him.
He touched me from behind,
from his wheelchair with his wife,

1352
01:29:06.151 --> 01:29:10.980
Barbara by his side.
He told me a dirty joke all the while being photographed.

1353
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.950
Touch me again.
Oh my God.
Um,
yeah,

1354
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:20.100
it's wrong.
Just because it's so gross to be touched by that dude.

1355
01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:24.000
How creepy is that?
Um,
well,

1356
01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:29.370
would you want to get your butts squeeze by him?
Would I,
I wouldn't mind.

1357
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:34.180
I really wouldn't mind.
And I wouldn't mind if an 89 year old woman,
like she,

1358
01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:38.080
she was at through intelligent as a picture and I go sure.

1359
01:29:38.081 --> 01:29:42.320
And I stood by her wheelchair and she went and she squeezed my heinie and she

1360
01:29:42.321 --> 01:29:46.470
was like a buzzy has to Kaka and you know,
I'd be like,
yeah,
okay.

1361
01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:48.720
I would be like,
that was crazy.

1362
01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:53.780
This old lady in a wheelchair just squeezed my ass and said something dirty to

1363
01:29:54.211 --> 01:29:55.790
me.
Port.

1364
01:29:56.060 --> 01:30:01.060
I think it's even more appalling when last fall a little people are gross and

1365
01:30:01.201 --> 01:30:04.890
creepy,
like old,
old,
like a scared of death.

1366
01:30:04.891 --> 01:30:07.410
I'm scared of catching her death.
Honest.
No,
I get that.

1367
01:30:07.411 --> 01:30:09.480
That's the uncomfortable feeling of being around the old.

1368
01:30:09.481 --> 01:30:13.560
But I'm sure for somebody doing something like let's say,
let's say,

1369
01:30:14.190 --> 01:30:17.940
let's just say what this scenario can happen to you.

1370
01:30:18.030 --> 01:30:22.380
A guy can go like,
hey,
uh,
uh,
so you brought the whole,

1371
01:30:23.190 --> 01:30:26.820
brought the milk machine with you today?
No,
I brought my coffee.

1372
01:30:26.821 --> 01:30:29.580
I see you brought the milk and then he,
and then he puts his cup,

1373
01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:32.070
he puts his cup in front of your tits and he's like,

1374
01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:35.760
can I get half and half from this one and skim from that one.
And he's like,

1375
01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:38.370
like that.
So is it,

1376
01:30:38.610 --> 01:30:43.610
is it worse than a 40 year old man does that 60 year old man or a 90 year old

1377
01:30:44.641 --> 01:30:45.450
men?

1378
01:30:45.450 --> 01:30:49.950
I think it's worse at the 90 year old because they're supposed to be sweet and

1379
01:30:49.951 --> 01:30:54.480
old and asexual.
When you're 90 it's supposed to kind of whittle away,

1380
01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:58.710
but isn't it less threatening?
I don't know.
I know that it's gross.

1381
01:30:58.711 --> 01:31:03.300
It's gross or the older they are,
it's gross.
But I mean Granddad,
but the,
the,

1382
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:08.510
the 40 or 50 or 60 year old guy can actually like do something.

1383
01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:11.910
In other words,
like this guy's in a wheelchair.
He's like,

1384
01:31:12.030 --> 01:31:16.300
I remember when I saw it's like that.
And He,
you know,
he can barely,

1385
01:31:16.530 --> 01:31:20.180
but that's why it's even creepier and grosser cause he's like,
hey,

1386
01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:24.840
so you would feel worse about that really?
About the old guy.
Yeah.

1387
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:27.390
It's interesting.
I'm asking.
I would honestly,

1388
01:31:27.391 --> 01:31:31.230
because you don't expect it as much from the older guy,
the younger guy,

1389
01:31:31.231 --> 01:31:34.170
you expect them to be creeps.
So you were like,
I saw that one coming.

1390
01:31:35.370 --> 01:31:37.070
The older person,
it's really,

1391
01:31:37.071 --> 01:31:39.060
it really catches you off guard when they're creepy.

1392
01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:43.830
Do you want to hear the statement?
Outgoing?
It's kind of funny.
Okay.
Okay.

1393
01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:44.940
So they issued a statement.

1394
01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:47.880
I spokesman President Bush would never under any circumstance,

1395
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:50.720
intentionally caused distress to anyone he should.

1396
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:55.470
He had sincerely apologizes if his attempt at humor offended this person.

1397
01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:58.290
And then the,
this is what the next statement said.

1398
01:31:58.291 --> 01:32:03.291
At age 93 President Bush has been confined to a wheelchair for roughly five

1399
01:32:03.491 --> 01:32:04.270
years.

1400
01:32:04.270 --> 01:32:09.190
His arm falls on the lower waste of people with whom he takes pictures to try to

1401
01:32:09.191 --> 01:32:10.390
put people at ease.

1402
01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:15.070
The president routinely tells the same joke and on occasion he has padded

1403
01:32:15.071 --> 01:32:18.430
women's rears and what he intended to be a good natured manner.

1404
01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:23.410
Some have seen as innocent,
others clearly viewed as inappropriate to anyone.

1405
01:32:23.411 --> 01:32:26.650
He has offended.
The president sincerely apologize.

1406
01:32:26.910 --> 01:32:31.050
<v 6>Oh,
so his,
he can't control his,
his arm.</v>

1407
01:32:31.290 --> 01:32:32.070
That's what so then,

1408
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:35.820
then don't fucking take pictures of people on that side of you,
but he can't,

1409
01:32:35.821 --> 01:32:38.820
he can't.
He's saying that his arm,
he can't control it.

1410
01:32:38.821 --> 01:32:43.821
So then he comes up with a stock line and arms God life as long like my cock

1411
01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:48.500
<v 2>or something.
Then I think this might even be the picture.
Hilarious.</v>

1412
01:32:48.501 --> 01:32:53.480
So like his left arm is probably like around her ass right now or near it.

1413
01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:58.580
You know what I mean?
And he's like,
I'll run up.

1414
01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:01.540
Fuck you.
Or I don't know what he's saying,
but he's,

1415
01:33:01.541 --> 01:33:05.900
he's probably like wipe all the way you might have out of the way to the top.

1416
01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:10.850
You Wipe Front to back.
You think so?

1417
01:33:10.970 --> 01:33:14.690
I don't think so.
Do you wipe down?
I'm sorry.

1418
01:33:15.290 --> 01:33:18.790
Always bothers me about gross old dudes and especially in wheelchairs.

1419
01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:23.210
I always look at their crutches.
Yeah.
And how mushy his big,
big,

1420
01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:26.540
big does your dick of balls do they do,

1421
01:33:26.541 --> 01:33:30.140
they spread the older you get.
Yeah,
and everything.
Everything's hanging.

1422
01:33:30.141 --> 01:33:31.550
Don't forget.
They're like everything,

1423
01:33:31.670 --> 01:33:34.630
every bit of skin [inaudible] everything is,
he has,

1424
01:33:34.631 --> 01:33:37.460
his face is drooping and we look at her shoulders.

1425
01:33:37.461 --> 01:33:41.330
Her tits are flat because you know your body's decaying.
Yeah.

1426
01:33:41.331 --> 01:33:44.450
Like I think when Fitzsimmons it was like you don't know if his Dick's big or

1427
01:33:44.451 --> 01:33:49.440
that's just like again,
just fallen over skin.
All right.

1428
01:33:49.850 --> 01:33:53.470
All right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I um,
you know,
I bet hurt,

1429
01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:56.750
hurt a nightmare to grow old.
Her box can be in good shape either.

1430
01:33:56.940 --> 01:33:57.540
<v 6>Oh,
I've seen it.</v>

1431
01:33:57.540 --> 01:34:00.960
I told you I had to change a hundred year old lady for her birthday party and

1432
01:34:00.961 --> 01:34:05.010
her,
I hung out,
hung outside of her underwear.

1433
01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:09.290
I saw her labia hanging out and her tits were drooping out of her bra too.

1434
01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:10.213
Should I feel like it?

1435
01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:13.870
<v 2>90 year old man said something like that to me.
I'd be like,</v>

1436
01:34:13.871 --> 01:34:14.980
this guy's about to die

1437
01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:20.800
<v 6>rather do the 90 year old guy you don't have to do.</v>

1438
01:34:20.801 --> 01:34:24.560
And when we were talking about him saying something,
but that's not what I'm,

1439
01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:26.510
what'd you rather do?

1440
01:34:26.540 --> 01:34:31.540
The 90 year old guy or 16 Benadryls 16 Benadryl.

1441
01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.940
So I have to have sex with him either or.

1442
01:34:35.710 --> 01:34:37.790
It's 90 year old George

1443
01:34:39.410 --> 01:34:43.830
or Benadryl.
There's a chance that I'd killed the guy.
Yeah,
that's,

1444
01:34:44.750 --> 01:34:47.510
that's part of the would you rather?
That's part of the thing.

1445
01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:52.040
You're either risking your life for the Aluna tech to kill you or you're going

1446
01:34:52.041 --> 01:34:53.270
to break his hips.
Bye.

1447
01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:58.790
<v 2>But fucking but sex and my dad would do you,
but sex George.</v>

1448
01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:02.080
Hilarious.
That Benadryl guys.
Terrifying.

1449
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:05.810
I'm watching mind hunter on Netflix right now.
Yeah.

1450
01:35:05.811 --> 01:35:10.020
He's in a manager or someone like him is in there.
Yeah.

1451
01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:13.700
Slices a girl's tits off.
I am not interested in that shit.

1452
01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:16.550
I forget who I'm talking to you.
I was like,

1453
01:35:16.551 --> 01:35:20.900
I am not interested in any of these kinds of shows.
Get women getting their kid,

1454
01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:23.660
their tits cut off and murderers and shit.

1455
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:25.790
I don't want to watch hospitals stories.

1456
01:35:25.791 --> 01:35:27.590
I don't want to watch people dying of cancer.

1457
01:35:27.591 --> 01:35:29.780
I don't want to watch no fucking white bummer movies.

1458
01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:33.470
I don't want to watch black bomber movies and I don't want to watch any fucking

1459
01:35:33.471 --> 01:35:36.410
bummers.
Dude,
fuck that shit.

1460
01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:41.180
What's that movie now on the iTunes movie?
It's got the,
everyone loves it.

1461
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:44.650
It's a black and the cover with like the light.
What's that shit called?

1462
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:48.260
Moonlight.
Moonlight is not a buffer to black.

1463
01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:53.030
I'm not interested in in the black aids.
Bummer.
I don't.
I'm sure it's fantastic.

1464
01:35:54.230 --> 01:35:58.070
I just don't,
I can't.
I don't have the emotional bandwidth.
I cry at everything.

1465
01:35:58.950 --> 01:36:03.860
Oh,
I'm too sensitive.
I know.
I know.
I know.
Oh Man.

1466
01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:06.710
I feel too bad for people.
I too empathetic.

1467
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:12.460
<v 17>Fuck that shit all day.</v>

1468
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.420
It shouldn't.
The bucket handle.
Yeah.

1469
01:36:17.421 --> 01:36:22.280
We keep putting in carrying because when we walk to go see the,

1470
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:27.050
you know the flowers or the flower with fission young,
if that to shit.

1471
01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:27.893
I can't

1472
01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:34.820
get the fuck outta here.
I love this one.
I like that idea.

1473
01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:40.160
You're shit and smell that.
Yeah.
She's got the right here.

1474
01:36:40.490 --> 01:36:42.050
It's part of the experience,

1475
01:36:42.250 --> 01:36:46.420
the experience part of the wet experienced grandma,

1476
01:36:46.610 --> 01:36:51.610
the experience experience and what I experienced a lot on my own.

1477
01:36:53.781 --> 01:36:58.490
Shit won't go camping.
I don't like that.

1478
01:37:01.390 --> 01:37:04.480
<v 2>I love the lady that made this too.
She knew exactly what she was doing.</v>

1479
01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:07.720
It was beautifully done.
What are we going to do?
One more.

1480
01:37:07.721 --> 01:37:11.620
That old baby going to die.
Well,
I mean who's going to take care of us?

1481
01:37:11.621 --> 01:37:13.750
Do we just check ourselves?
Anyone old folks home together?

1482
01:37:15.010 --> 01:37:18.730
Can we go to the same old folks home?
They'll keep it will keep us together,

1483
01:37:18.731 --> 01:37:21.520
right?
Oh yeah,
definitely.
I can't live without you.

1484
01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:25.120
You're going to die before me though.
Cause men always do shit.

1485
01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:29.260
What the fuck am I going to do?
And I'm older than you,
babe.

1486
01:37:29.261 --> 01:37:33.600
Do I have permission to get a boyfriend in the retirement home?
Um,

1487
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:37.110
yeah,
of course.
Of course.
You can get it.
You can get a,

1488
01:37:39.490 --> 01:37:43.520
you can get a boyfriend.
There's no closing song in my closing song file.
Aw.

1489
01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:47.500
Wa Fitzy has a song for you.
Come here,
Schnitzel.
