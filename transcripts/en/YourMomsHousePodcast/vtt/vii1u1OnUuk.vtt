00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.750
trying to say something.
I think so.

I heard the club closing the laughing derby.

10
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.440
Apparently they lost their liquor license.
Well that's really important for it.

What was the one you said Jarell again,

74
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.520
you put the emphasis on the different syllable,
Rogan,

75
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.340
Joe Rogan and uh,
we're ready to start the show.

76
00:05:19.341 --> 00:05:23.210
And don't forget if you are one of those people that are like,
wow,

77
00:05:23.211 --> 00:05:28.000
that's a lot of ads.
Don't forget to bite the tip of Your Dad's Dick off and uh,

82
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.220

Get Him.

83
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.260

Also treat Bert.

84
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.380

And then he'll be like,

85
00:05:54.381 --> 00:05:57.810
what the fuck is that?
We feel the ads.

86
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.370
<v 0>I mean,
your mom's house is free.
Why don't have to listen to commercials.</v>

87
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.250
Boom was really going to be a pub.

Yeah.

93
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.223
MMM.

94
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.210
<v 0>That wasn't even going to be our,
our opening club.
He saw it and it was,</v>

95
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.330
this kid's adorable.
So I love it.
It says,

96
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.800
why are you so fat bird baby?
It is like we've gotten the foreign,

97
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.150
we have so many additions.

98
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.553
<v 3>Okay.</v>

99
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:36.170
<v 0>Uh,

See Alicia,
you have an adorable,</v>

100
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.280
adorable kid and we should say this.
I want to say this.
You know,
you guys,

101
00:07:40.281 --> 00:07:42.770
some of you know,
so we don't burn press.
Sorry.

102
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.180
Bart is one of my closest friends,
closest fattest friends.

103
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.040
And um,

104
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:54.130
his new show time special comes out this weekend.

105
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.730
I'm really excited.
Site,
right?
Yeah.

106
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.860
So it's airing at Friday,
November 11th at 11.

107
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:06.620
At 10:00 PM he sent him yes.
It's on demand the next day.
Um,

108
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:11.690
it's,
you know,
it's,
I just,
I'm so happy for him.
He's a,
you know,

109
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.490
he's a great guy.
We,
he's a fattest,
funniest guy working today.

110
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.300
There's nobody like nobody.
Nobody's fat first shot from this special,

111
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.130
which he did shirtless,
but he did shortlist,

112
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.570
which I'm hoping not only just kind of gives a,

113
00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:28.580
another jumpstart to the bird is fat movement,

114
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.900
but also to the bird is fat shirts are that are available right now

115
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.190
in our store.
Um,
but yeah,
this is a looks good.
Burger.

116
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:43.090
Oh my life.
Oh Jesus.
Credit a whole special,
like I know,

117
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.690
which is actually smarter for him because he sweats a lot and it's easier than

118
00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:51.140
sweating through multiple shirts.
Sure.
And you know,

119
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.830
it doesn't distract the audit.
Like no one's gonna want to look at this.

120
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:59.820
So maybe I'll focus more on the material.
Right,
right.
Yeah.
So,
well he,

121
00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:03.020
he has been going shirtless in the clubs for a while.

122
00:09:03.021 --> 00:09:07.380
So this was a natural progression.
Yeah.
I think it's,
I think it's a good move.

123
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.770
Yeah.
The thing is though,
once that becomes his hook,

124
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.600
then he's going to have to do once it becomes,
or when it became you talking.

125
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:16.700
Right.

126
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:21.600
Cause now it's like doing the tonight show shirtless is that we commit to being

127
00:09:21.601 --> 00:09:25.920
shirtless now.
Signed deal.
Yeah.
Can I tell you that?
We have a new bet going?

128
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.850
What's that?
It was established today.
Oh Great.
He was,
um,
he was all,

129
00:09:30.851 --> 00:09:34.080
he was doing Ari Arie,
Arie Shaffer.

130
00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:39.081
And then we're doing a podcast and I was talking to them and because I already

131
00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:45.300
had texted me like,
what do you way?
And I was like,
oh,
he's going to answer.

132
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:50.490
I did.
I answered honestly.
Yeah.
I weighed myself this morning.
So,
um,

133
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.920
at first he texted me that Burt was two 57 and I lit up.
I was like,
what?

134
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.170
Because that's so much for,

135
00:09:58.171 --> 00:10:03.171
especially for bird cause I have no sense of what fat is for men gets to me as a

136
00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:07.770
woman that would be morbidly obese.
Like well it is two bills.

137
00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:13.320
So what's normal for a boy?
It kind of depends man.
It depends like height,

138
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.030
six foot tall.
That's where we are.
We're both six feet.

139
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.280
And what should you way we should wait?

140
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:24.420
Well should way or like what would be a better way desirable.

141
00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.790
Better wait for us would be in the two 15 to two 20 range.

142
00:10:29.791 --> 00:10:32.560
That would be like a healthier one.
Do the math here.
Yeah.

143
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:35.850
And then like what would be like,
uh,
you know,
if somebody was like,

144
00:10:35.851 --> 00:10:38.650
here's definitely where you should be,
they would definitely say that's true.

145
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:42.540
Then you should be.
Of course,
of course we are.

146
00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:49.200
I didn't know how much fat or if we were like really healthy.
We,

147
00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:50.430
but we'd weigh like one 90

148
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.830
but he doesn't make you 57 Oh,

149
00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:01.440
I have mine on airplane mode.
I swear.
Every time that happens,

150
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.370
you look at me like you're going to beat,
you can't beat me up.

151
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:11.130
And I'd call the cops.
No,
it's on airplane.
Okay.
I'm sorry sweetie.
I'm sorry.

152
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.250
I'm sorry.
Oh God.

153
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.740
So like Turner,

154
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.600
Turner iteration.
Fuck Bitch.
So anyways,

155
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.010
he's two 40 he says,
no way.
It's what he said.

156
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.450
I weighed myself this morning,
two 42 so we're two pounds apart.

157
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.800
We have a kind of a bad time.
We have a bad cold.
I know.
Who knows?

158
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.490
But we have a back.
Okay.
January 1st,

159
00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:41.190
second and third you have to weigh yourself three days in a row.

160
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.610
So that doesn't count.
It's a real way.

161
00:11:42.611 --> 00:11:46.290
So it's not like you sweat it out and then push it out.
Yeah,
right.

162
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:52.020
Whoever is lower three days consistently.
Right?
Right.

163
00:11:52.021 --> 00:11:54.220
After the new year,
we'll

164
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:55.743
<v 4>win the bet.</v>

165
00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.780
So whoever's lower and then the loser has to take like let's burn is going to

166
00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:02.770
lose.

167
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:07.510
Third has to take me and Ari to a,

168
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.270
an event of some kind of desirable event,

169
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:14.100
so it could be like a sporting event,
a concert.
That's fine.

170
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.540
Some type of show,
whatever.

171
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:21.440
<v 2>Like a Rihanna,
Rihanna comes to town and Ari and I were like,</v>

172
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:25.220
oh my God,
Omg I,
she's yellow.
Brown diamonds are in the air.

173
00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.490
Then Brant has to take the two of us,

174
00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:33.660
first of all burnt is going to take you and secondly to forties a lie.

175
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:37.230
There's no,
I don't think it was two 40 yeah,
he's way above that.
Yeah.

176
00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.113
The other thing is

177
00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.800
<v 4>I fully recognize that Bart could write,</v>

178
00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:45.160
sly could win this thing easily because he,

179
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:50.400
he just has the body type that responds to doing this.

180
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.280
You know that cutting something out really well,
but he won't do it.

181
00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.190
<v 2>You mean alcohol?
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

182
00:12:56.191 --> 00:12:58.860
What you need to not being an alcoholic and I have the,

183
00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.890
I have the advantage of it being after new years.

184
00:13:01.891 --> 00:13:04.320
Imagine what he does on new years.
Oh,
he's going to blow it out.

185
00:13:04.321 --> 00:13:08.040
He's probably got a week's worth of shows is somewhere in the country and he's

186
00:13:08.041 --> 00:13:11.130
going to be every night it's going to be like,
Ooh,
partying and then,

187
00:13:11.131 --> 00:13:16.040
and then the food after right around two 30 in the morning.
Yeah,
he's foolish.

188
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.800
I'm looking at the calendar for what?
Yeah.
Let's see what's at the staple center.

189
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.210
I don't want some like top row shit.
I want like floor seats.
I'm going to make,

190
00:13:24.211 --> 00:13:25.290
I'm going to make them cough it up.

191
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.970
Is there a football happening while we were talking about the rose bowl,

192
00:13:28.971 --> 00:13:32.490
but that would be like right then and there,
but maybe,
you know,
I dunno.

193
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:37.140
Maybe it's airy.
Like football.
I think he likes it enough and it likes it enough.

194
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:41.550
Yeah,
it's a free ticket.
So this,
it's just for the hang.
Well let's think of it.

195
00:13:41.551 --> 00:13:42.990
Let's plan your event now.

196
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:47.370
Cause God knows that Bart will be buying you guys tickets.
Yeah,

197
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:51.150
there's no way.
It's two 40 is there any way to verify that?
Wait,

198
00:13:51.151 --> 00:13:53.400
I feel like she's lying.
I don't know.
I think,

199
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:57.840
I think airy saw him way himself or something.
So I think that one might be,

200
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:03.180
let's see,
what is the,
um,
uh,
we need an objective scale.

201
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:04.283
I know,

202
00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:07.103
<v 4>let's see.</v>

203
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:11.760
What are you looking for looking for the bowl games for 2017.

204
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.370
<v 2>Here you go.
Near you go.
You are your perfect smile.</v>

205
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:21.080
Big Games.
Okay.
Oh my God.

206
00:14:21.081 --> 00:14:25.440
Just for the championship game is and Burt's hometown in Tampa Tampon.

207
00:14:25.441 --> 00:14:28.370
So does he have to fly you guys out?
I think that'd be a lot to ask,

208
00:14:28.371 --> 00:14:32.810
but I think I'm going to,
the game would be really fun.
The Fun,
let's see.

209
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:37.340
It is the Roosevelt January 2nd.
So that'd be right in the middle of it.

210
00:14:37.341 --> 00:14:40.250
That'd be the easiest to go to.
Yeah.
Maybe we should talk,

211
00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:44.030
maybe we should get them and just see who has to make whoever has,
yeah,

212
00:14:44.031 --> 00:14:47.240
that's a good idea.
You can see,
uh,
the,
the,

213
00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:49.840
the big game is in Tampa in January 9th.

214
00:14:49.841 --> 00:14:52.670
So you and I have been on a similar diet.

215
00:14:52.671 --> 00:14:57.671
I started seeing a personal trainer finally after 40 years of being out of shape

216
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:03.110
and she put me on what's known as the primal diet,
which sounds similar.

217
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:07.940
Is this with Joe Rogan does.
He does Kido,
which is what you do.
Yeah,
but he did.

218
00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:10.310
I think he's done primal.
I think so.

219
00:15:10.311 --> 00:15:12.800
What's the difference between what I'm doing and what you guys do?

220
00:15:12.801 --> 00:15:14.690
Cause it sounds very similar,

221
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.130
<v 4>I think.
Well,
mine is supposed to be high fat,</v>

222
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:24.290
moderate protein.
Oh,
net carbs only from veggies.
All right.
Yeah,

223
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:25.880
that's it.
That's pretty simple.

224
00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.140
<v 2>I can have more carbs in you,
I believe,</v>

225
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:32.840
and I can have dairy in moderation.
Yeah.
Uh,

226
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:37.710
but it's high fat and protein and veggies.
Yeah,
it's pretty,
I don't know.

227
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:41.880
It's pretty gnarly.
I've been shitting so much.
Yeah,
but you're good at that.

228
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.290
I'm so good at it.

229
00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:48.130
It's like I take primal dumps and then the thought of eating like what I can eat

230
00:15:48.131 --> 00:15:53.010
is not very exciting.
Yeah.
So I just,
I just don't eat as much as I used to.

231
00:15:53.011 --> 00:15:55.650
And then denial,
lose weight.
So it was pretty great.
So far.

232
00:15:55.651 --> 00:15:59.320
I've lost a couple pounds mostly from shitting,
but hmm.

233
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:02.670
<v 4>I'm down 25 pounds.
It's amaze.
Yeah.</v>

234
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.520
And how long have you been doing this for what it feels like I'm getting until

235
00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:09.090
I'm hitting like around two months.
Ah,
it's great.
You look great.

236
00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.910
I've had a couple,
you know,
you fall off the wagon a couple of times,

237
00:16:11.911 --> 00:16:14.720
but basically it's there.
Yeah.
Um,

238
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.970
<v 2>yeah.
I've,
I've been good without alcohol.</v>

239
00:16:16.971 --> 00:16:21.500
Even just not drinking wine I think is then the wine makes me hungrier.
Yeah.

240
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.850
Cause then it sugar in your belly

241
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:27.190
<v 4>sugar and your belly sugar in your belly.
Um,
check this out.</v>

242
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.640
I got something to play for you.
Are you ready?

243
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.220
<v 5>We haven't done this in awhile.
It's big news.</v>

244
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.440
Chips in a bowl.
Then it's chips in a bowl.
News.

245
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:46.760
<v 2>Wow.
Sorry.
Just to get ready for the announcement and hold on,
wait a minute.</v>

246
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.290
I found my flask.
It was missing and then,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Don't pretend.

247
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:56.690
Mm.
Yeah.
I'm drinking out of my,

248
00:16:56.691 --> 00:17:00.740
if you haven't my personal main mommy water champ flask.
Yeah,

249
00:17:00.741 --> 00:17:05.150
but he made a Christmas purchase.
They want

250
00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:11.550
<v 4>to get the brand new water champion tee shirt.
Um,</v>

251
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:15.090
go to Tom segura.com.
Click on the store and it'll,

252
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:19.100
it will route you to our store.
Um,
it looks great.

253
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:22.250
Merge method is our,
our new store.
But anyways,

254
00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:26.270
it's the brand new water champion shirt.
I love 'em.
I think it's really,
really,

255
00:17:26.271 --> 00:17:30.200
really good.
Here's the thing,
you can rock it.
You can be the old water,

256
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.680
the water champion in your house.
You,
you can buy it for somebody else.

257
00:17:33.681 --> 00:17:36.830
If you differ.
For instance,
like Christina does and she acknowledges it,

258
00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:42.430
you could then give it to your,
um,
let me mute you real quick and then,
uh,

259
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.120
you could buy it.
You would have it too.

260
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.890
You could give it to 'em that's ready to ship to the champion in your life.
But

261
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:51.150
<v 2>we'll see.</v>

262
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:55.110
You know what I'm going to do when I get mine is I'm going to have my initials,

263
00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.800
my monogram put on there and we're very proud of the water challenge that it

264
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:04.400
hasn't ended people.
Every time I hit the stage,
they're like,
drink up.
Fuck.

265
00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.590
Have they ask you to drink water?
I was funny.

266
00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:11.280
That's because you're not auto right already drinking.
When I pound a bottle,

267
00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:15.410
they cheer like chugging beer.
Yeah.

268
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.320
Well you know what I do is I had a special dress custom made that con that I can

269
00:18:21.721 --> 00:18:25.500
hold two water containers in an I do per custom made.
I did,

270
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:29.280
I had a tailor so in two pockets and I put a bottle water and eat.

271
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:31.350
I'm not lying or ask my audience.

272
00:18:31.351 --> 00:18:36.351
It's come to see my audience and I drink both bottles while onstage.

273
00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:40.860
A self help guru would ask my audience.
They are,
they are my guru.

274
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.840
How come this got way,
way louder.
It's did you turn me up a little bit there?
Did,

275
00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:49.110
I mean Amemiya yeah,
that's better now.

276
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:51.690
Water Champ.
Sure.
It very good.

277
00:18:51.691 --> 00:18:55.860
Christmas item also and genes.

278
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.110
We're moving next week.

279
00:18:58.111 --> 00:19:01.110
Do you know that we've done nothing.

280
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.380
We've moved three times.
Three times.
Yeah.

281
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:08.610
Because of various um,
annoying reasons,

282
00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:13.140
but now we're just sticking to it.
Now.
We're just going,
we're just fucking going.

283
00:19:13.141 --> 00:19:16.800
But we've done nothing so far and we impacted nothing.
We have thrown away.

284
00:19:16.801 --> 00:19:17.634
Nothing.

285
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:23.010
But number one on my priority list is ordering total wash.

286
00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:27.360
Let's now what's interesting is I went into the,

287
00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.450
I'll show you what I discovered.
I went into the total store.

288
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.870
They don't sell them at the toto store.
It's like a showroom.

289
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:37.230
The Guy told me that there's a newer model,

290
00:19:37.231 --> 00:19:39.880
like basically we have the dinosaur of the total washlet.

291
00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.030
Let me see if I can find it.
Here we go.

292
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:47.190
The model we need to get is a three 50 he cannot wait.
Now it's,

293
00:19:47.191 --> 00:19:50.540
they said it's significantly less on Amazon.
That's what I want to do with their,

294
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:51.730
this is what I want to do to eat.

295
00:19:51.731 --> 00:19:56.080
You can get it for half the price basically on Amazon.
Sounds good.
Uh,

296
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.240
using our banner.
Oh yeah.

297
00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.790
We're going to buy our toto through our banner.
Of course.

298
00:20:02.791 --> 00:20:06.040
I encourage you guys,
if you want to buy a total wash,

299
00:20:06.041 --> 00:20:10.800
let or anything on Amazon this Christmas season,
Christmas is coming very fast.

300
00:20:10.801 --> 00:20:14.280
Please use our banner,
your mom's House podcasts like,
Huh?
Well,

301
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.970
the banner on the homepage,
by the way,
we had,

302
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.100
we had a very,

303
00:20:20.101 --> 00:20:25.050
very exciting conversation with one Dan Pena.
Oh my God.

304
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.240
Oh my God.
So exciting.

305
00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:32.620
We don't have it for you today because it was extensive and we have to basically

306
00:20:32.671 --> 00:20:37.380
have it cut down so that it's appropriate to share with you.

307
00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:38.131
But we'll also,

308
00:20:38.131 --> 00:20:41.180
I think we should also just put up the full conversation as a separate video.

309
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:44.010
They should really hear him because he's so amazing.

310
00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:48.190
But when we were on rogue and there's this whole story because we were on Rogan

311
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.070
<v 4>and we were thinking about,
you know,
what is the,</v>

312
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:56.020
some of the exciting things we've played on the show since the last time we saw

313
00:20:56.021 --> 00:21:00.480
Joe and you know,
the one with two times before we,

314
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:03.250
we introduced them to king ass river and um,

315
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.620
<v 2>which catapulted him into the limelight.</v>

316
00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:06.210
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

317
00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:11.210
And then with Pena we brought him up but Joe wasn't sure if he was going to get

318
00:21:12.421 --> 00:21:16.890
taken down because of people you know and their,
their usage rights paying.

319
00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:19.240
It doesn't give a shit.
But Joe didn't know that

320
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:23.280
<v 2>well cause Dan gives everything away for free.
That's his whole thing.</v>

321
00:21:23.281 --> 00:21:25.220
But we didn't,
I didn't know that.
We know.

322
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:29.700
We didn't want to assume that for Dan the $50 billion man,
that guy.
Yes.

323
00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.640
He doesn't give a shit though.
Yeah,
that's what he's almost dead.

324
00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:34.680
I don't think we can play stuff without getting sued.
Jamie.

325
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:37.870
<v 6>Hello Joe.
My name is Dan Pena.</v>

326
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:43.140
I'm still a far more for us at six one two 25 and if you think that I'm almost

327
00:21:43.481 --> 00:21:45.640
dead and I'm not going to be alive anymore.

328
00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:48.850
Asked his bear that I killed with a fucking knife not too long ago.

329
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.920
It's still a very tough fucking guy at 71 I take no bullshit in person or on the

330
00:21:53.921 --> 00:21:54.760
fucking youtube.

331
00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.570
I'm not yet and I'm funny alive and I don't give a fuck what anybody says about

332
00:21:58.571 --> 00:21:58.720
me.

333
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.560
I rip people's head off and shit down their neck for one tough ride or another

334
00:22:02.561 --> 00:22:07.090
tough guy.
Don't be afraid.
Don't be scared to use my stuff on your podcast.

335
00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.570
It's all fucking free.
You asked me,
why do you give it away free,
Dan?

336
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.900
I give it away for you to take the last fucking excuse boy from the,
sorry,

337
00:22:13.901 --> 00:22:17.620
because why they can't fulfill their dream.
I'm calling you out,
Joe.

338
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:22.000
You think you're a tough guy.
You haven't met me on the $50 billion man.

339
00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:25.800
And this is my lair.
Yeah.

340
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.380
<v 2>Guy's the fucking best guy,
man.
Look at Penney's castle,

341
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:36.420
Isn't that nuts?
Yeah.

You know,

342
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.450

Right.
You're fucking suit.

343
00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:44.820
What are you wearing your fucking jeans?
I can't.
I was so excited.

344
00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:48.270
We had a great conversation today.
We spoke to Dan pain yet cause he's,

345
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:51.570
he's gracious enough to accommodate because he's in England.

346
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.840
So we had to go back and forth for a couple of weeks here.
Took a minute to,

347
00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:58.680
to find the time that worked for both of us and he's also,

348
00:22:58.681 --> 00:23:03.680
he just finished up doing another Qla seminar and his castle and jeans.

349
00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:05.850
I was,
I don't think I've ever been that,

350
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.160
that excited to talk like we've spoken with Gloria.
Stefan,

351
00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:13.900
no brace from Gigolos.
I love our list.
It's amazing joy.

352
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:18.950
I remember Jules Ventura tour has been in the studio and I was of major get for

353

I mean I was sweating with excitement to talk to him was,

354
00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:31.350
He was great.
He's a fantastic speaker and an end,
a great guest.

355
00:23:31.351 --> 00:23:34.380
And I can't wait for you guys to hear the interview we had with them.

356
00:23:34.381 --> 00:23:38.150
So hopefully we'll get it in order.
Yeah,

you know,

357
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:41.040
will it cause yeah,
it'd be like we've done that before by the way.

358
00:23:41.041 --> 00:23:43.080
Where you like you just play some the whole thing yet.

359
00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.430
But we will put it up for what they want to hear,
the whole thing.

360
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.700
I read people's head off and shit down their neck.
Yeah,

361
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:55.910
I love it.
Really talks like that too.
And he does casual conversation.
He does.

362
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:56.803
Um,

363
00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:01.960
so I was involved meet this weekend where Raul Rob Ball meet Rob North Carolina.

364
00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:06.820
And which club is that?

365
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.620

366
00:24:09.621 --> 00:24:13.550
a big seam in whole fan.
Yeah.
Florida state.
Yeah.
Thursday was playing there.

367
00:24:13.551 --> 00:24:17.840
I couldn't go to the game.
I was six at the same time as my shows,
but um,

368
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.170
I got to meet up with,
you know,

369
00:24:19.171 --> 00:24:24.020
I'm such a big fan and I've been Twitter friends with some of the columnists and

370
00:24:24.021 --> 00:24:27.950
writers,
you know,
cover them.
So I met up with one after the show.
It's really fun.

371
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.490
That's exciting.
So you,
it's like a pen pal.
It is just like a pen pal that I met.

372
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:35.270
Yeah.
And did you guys jerk off in each other's mouths?
The halls?
Yup.
Yup.

373
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.830
That's exactly what we did together.
And take your dogs out and go,
hey,

374
00:24:39.831 --> 00:24:42.710
that's pretty good.
Yeah,
that's a really neat story.

375
00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.850
How'd you can tell our son your version of the story one day?

376
00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:49.290
<v 7>Oh,</v>

377
00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.920
<v 2>this is border.
Not even borderline.
You just basically,
yeah.</v>

378
00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:57.103
<v 7>Ooh,</v>

379
00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:01.280
<v 2>okay.
I'm done with you now.
Thank you.
Those are big words.</v>

380
00:25:01.281 --> 00:25:05.360
That's the way you did that.
It was very big word of you

381
00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:08.840
making fun of the song you're making.

382
00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.300
To me it felt like you were making fun of native Americans.

383
00:25:11.301 --> 00:25:13.590
So I didn't like it made me uncomfortable.

384
00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:19.190
Big words that was not racist.

385
00:25:19.191 --> 00:25:23.540
And Lola blamed the semen holes for Marcelo profanity.

386
00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.073
I felt like it.

387
00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:29.240
Why don't you blame the semen holes for having a racist mascot and sought a

388
00:25:29.241 --> 00:25:31.790
racist mascot?
Absolutely.
First of all,

389
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.560
the Seminole nation supports the,
uh,

390
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:39.830
the university using Seminoles as a,
the spot on the team,
right?

391
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:42.950
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

392
00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.850
So then how has my paying homage to their music?

393
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.750
It was disrespectful the way you did it.
It was disrespectful.

394
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.530
<v 7>Ooh.</v>

395
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:58.390
<v 2>Ooh,
God.</v>

396
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.100
And then you do the Tomahawk Chop.

397
00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:04.150
I know all this cause I've been watching you do it for 50 years.
Yeah.

398
00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:09.460
50 years now.
Before your flight.
Yeah.
Before your flight.

399
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:14.490
<v 5>Did you go there?
This is my song.</v>

400
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:35.630
Did you guys
see they're saying how you did it?

401
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:45.090
Come on boy.
Yeah,
school.
It's cool.
I do like that.

402
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:47.220
We're stopping the yard.

403
00:26:55.980 --> 00:27:00.480
What's that playing there?
That's my Tallahassee date.
Oh,
okay.

404
00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.650
I'm doing the school.
Oh,
that's fun.
That,
yeah,

405
00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.760
<v 2>where he goes,
what are they doing?
They're stopping the car.
Remember that?</v>

406
00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:10.180
I think that stomp the yard,

407
00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:17.650
but don't you quote that a lot?
Yeah.
He's so dumb.
We'll say it.

408
00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:22.520
Say it the way he's stopping the young man boobs.

409
00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.290
That's what he,
he,
I think he,
man,
they stomp in the yard.

410
00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.320
So does Chris Brown.
Right?

411
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:33.750
And that he beat the shit out of.
Oh,
Rihanna.

412
00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.920
<v 8>I forgot about that.
Yeah.
What's going on with it when this company?
Yeah,</v>

413
00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:43.550
I think that man,
they stop and that means just to dance right there dancing.

414
00:27:43.551 --> 00:27:47.180
Like you're still doing it.
Like they're dying.
They're going bird.

415
00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.430
It's cold in here.
Yeah.
There must be some clovers in that.

416
00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:54.920
<v 2>Uh,
most fear.
I'll said birds coding,</v>

417
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.060
I just to bring it on.

418
00:27:57.061 --> 00:28:01.520
So that's why it's in my mind is cold in here then I must,

419
00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:09.880
<v 5>oh,

420
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:19.303
Ooh,

421
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:23.920
<v 2>got serious.
So we got in a fight,
they got hurt.
Somebody stumped</v>

422
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:27.390
<v 5>space.
And I like supposed to be this</v>

423
00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.220
real serious,
sit down here at act like I want to be here.

424
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:33.940
You're the only thing your mom has got nothing.

425
00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:37.773
<v 9>Oh dear.</v>

426
00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.740
Hell of a door open.
He gone.

427
00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:51.560
<v 5>Well,
we got lucky.
That's in the trailer.
Ice Cream.
Elevate dorm.</v>

428
00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:56.280
<v 9>Elevate door was still open.
He got</v>

429
00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.240
<v 2>tell,
he says like,
you dumb bitch.</v>

430
00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.910
You don't know what that stuff's called stupid to hell.

431
00:29:01.911 --> 00:29:06.620
Or they just stop in the yard,
man.
Yeah,
I wouldn't know what that's called.

432
00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.230
Of course they're doing their dance routines.

433
00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:16.160
They're working on their raps.
Yeah,
they're wrapping up.
Yeah.
Gosh,

434
00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:20.160
<v 5>guys are dancing and into your mom was great.
Anthony.
Same with content.</v>

435
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:22.190
Then we'll come right.

436
00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:30.860
<v 9>The hell of they doing?
Where are you from?</v>

437
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:32.880
<v 2>Right?
Where are you from,
dummy.</v>

438
00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:37.220
You idiot people don't stomp the yard in the cafeteria where you're from.

439
00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.510
That's the first time I ever saw that freshman here.

440
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:43.360
You don't even know this thought.
The yard.
Well,
part of the world.

441
00:29:43.361 --> 00:29:45.730
Are they like in the south somewhere?
I Dunno where that's,

442
00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.610
it looks like a an Hbcu,
but I don't know where it is.
Hmm.

443
00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:53.290
Just stop in the yard,
dummy.
Don't you know that

444
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:59.600
Ali woke up?
Lj?
Maybe.
Probably from staff in the arts allows,
dumped the,
yeah.

445
00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:04.210
Yeah.
Uh,
what was the point of this discussion?
Oh,
I was going to say,

446
00:30:04.211 --> 00:30:07.970
so you left really early for your flight.
You're like,
uh,

447
00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:12.460
an 11:00 AM fly,
but you loved the house lake six in the morning.

448
00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:17.770
And I was like,
are you going to the Strip club before you get on your flight?

449
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:20.380
And then I texted you that that's where I was.

450
00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:25.740
I left so early just cause there was a strip club by lax.

451
00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:34.210
Good plastic Ziploc bag.

452
00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:38.920
I wouldn't say she has eaten some Ziploc bag.
God,

453
00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:41.620
what a dummy.
How are you alive?

454
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.290
She's definitely not stomping the yard.
So

455
00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:52.480
could you imagine the people do that?
Of course they do that.
That's why.
Sure.

456
00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:53.383
Clubs look,

457
00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:57.160
they're everywhere and people go at all different times for different reasons,

458
00:30:57.161 --> 00:31:00.550
which I understand.
I don't,
I don't think going to strip clubs is weird.

459
00:31:00.551 --> 00:31:05.551
But you brought to my attention this specific location and stories about it that

460
00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:07.540
were very amusing,
I think.

461
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:11.890
Well we started joking around the house now that every time you go to the

462
00:31:11.891 --> 00:31:16.010
airport,
wow.
That was loud.
Yeah.

463
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:20.350
Imagine if we had the Fart Mike.
I know it would have been a lot better.
I know,

464
00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:24.760
but,
uh,
my father had his best friend who's now dead,

465
00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.070
but they would,

466
00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:31.110
they went to Costa Rica trip once and they want extra early to the airport so

467
00:31:32.201 --> 00:31:35.590
that my dad's friend could go to the Strip club.

468
00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:39.220
So his wife dropped him off at the airport and I'm like,
see you later sweetie.

469
00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:43.330
And then they got into a cab and went to the Nudey bar.
Yeah.

470
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.630
And then go back to you go back to the airport,
get on the flight.

471
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:51.070
So he's getting ramped up for the trip.
That's all.
I mean,
it makes sense.

472
00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.790
I don't think it's that weird.
I just think it's funny that,

473
00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:58.780
that you know someone so closely.
Yeah.
It's funny.
Yeah.

474
00:31:58.781 --> 00:32:00.020
It's funny.
It's silly.

475
00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:05.440
It's silly that you like your wife drops you off and then you leave the airport

476
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:08.020
titty bar because that was the flight.

477
00:32:08.021 --> 00:32:12.400
And then what I would have to do to go is I would have to do with like four

478
00:32:12.401 --> 00:32:16.240
hours early.
That's the part that's funny is that you're going to like,
oh my God,

479
00:32:16.241 --> 00:32:17.290
I'm gonna get up at 4:00 AM

480
00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:24.210
10:00 AM flight and like why not just land at the destination and then find a

481
00:32:24.611 --> 00:32:28.900
nudey bar?
Like you have to go before the flight in the morning.

482
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:32.140
You got to really love it or you can just need breakfast.

483
00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:38.260
That's something I didn't know about until I was much older was that there's a

484
00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:43.280
big strip clubs that serve food and that some people are like,
hey,

485
00:32:43.281 --> 00:32:46.520
the food is really good.
Yeah,

486
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:52.040
it can't be really good,
but it's buffet,
right?
Like it's crappy.

487
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:57.000
I've never had it.
Um,
I did have steak.
There's,

488
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:59.120
there's one,
like in Florida,

489
00:32:59.121 --> 00:33:03.470
there's a chain of a steakhouse that's also a topless bar,

490
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.940
but it's known to be a good steakhouse.

491
00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:10.670
I'd look it up and then I had to set there plus steakhouse or maybe it's,

492
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:14.870
you know,
it's like,
let me see.
I think you're saying stick.
Let people go.

493
00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.360
People are like,
this is like,
it is good steak topless.

494
00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:20.060
It's like Hooters house where you're like,
no,
no,
no.

495
00:33:20.061 --> 00:33:24.560
I'm going to Hooters for the chicken wings.
Is it Rachel steakhouse?

496
00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:27.690
Yes.
She's chewing.
That's supposed to be good.
I mean,

497
00:33:27.691 --> 00:33:30.650
and I remember I went there years and years ago.
Where is that?

498
00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:35.180
What part of Florida?
Uh,
it looks like there's one in Tampa and uh,

499
00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:38.840
let's see.
Orlando.
Yeah,
it seemed like some of the big cities.

500
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:43.800
Now Betsy is chewing on.
It's memorable.
It's not like I go,
no,

501
00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:50.510
it wasn't like I go,
man,
that's the best steak of my life.
But it's like,

502
00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:55.310
it's good.
It's good for a titty bar,
I imagine.
Right.
But what I wouldn't do,

503
00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:59.540
and what I've heard of people doing is breakfast.
It's like scrambled eggs,

504
00:33:59.541 --> 00:34:01.580
buffet at the Strip club.
I'm not into that,

505
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:07.780
especially by the airport.
Like I understand if you're in Vegas and you just,

506
00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:12.110
you know,
you just blew it out all night and you're hung over and just go the,

507
00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:16.190
it's funny.
It's fun.
Sure.
But just for a flight,
like for a flight,

508
00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.910
get commitment.
It seems like you really want it.
You really need it.

509
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:25.310
You really need it
to be,
we got to make a pit stop.

510
00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:27.110
You really need to come in your payments.

511
00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:30.920
The thing is like you also are for a flight.

512
00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:34.190
Any inconvenience is magnified.

513
00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:38.840
You really inconveniencing yourself already shitty to wake up and go to the

514
00:34:38.841 --> 00:34:42.200
fucking airport.
You go through security,
you want extra early

515
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.370
leaving the airport,
getting into a cats,
a lot,

516
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.450
getting hammered and then coming back.
Yeah.
It just seems like a lot for a more,

517
00:34:50.451 --> 00:34:54.080
but I guess it makes,
you know,
it makes,
I understand it more that they went on.

518
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:59.110
They did it before there.
There Bro.
Trip Bro Down 50th Birthday.
Yeah,

519
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.700
but maybe you don't know,

520
00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.020
but it sounds like that dude from what I've heard about him,

521
00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.310
he might have done that on any flight.
His routine.
Yeah.

522
00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:10.070
I don't think it's because this was the special birthday tram me ask you this.

523
00:35:10.071 --> 00:35:14.960
If you ever drop your daughter off at the airport.
I'm trying to,
yeah,

524
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:17.900
come to think of it.
I drop him off like six hours early all the time.

525
00:35:17.901 --> 00:35:22.580
It's interesting here.
I hate being late.
I hate,
sure.
Yeah.

526
00:35:22.581 --> 00:35:26.990
It's interesting.
Yeah.
It's so funny when you realize your parents are like,

527
00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:31.820
you know people,
they are,
wait a minute.
And it's funny because my dad be like,

528
00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:35.840
yeah,
my best friends and all this stuff.
That's always a good one,
not me.

529
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:38.190
I don't know if you're the best friend

530
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:40.800
<v 0>probably in the same stuff.
They're into one thing.
We know a guy,</v>

531
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:43.350
but when is your best friend and you're like,
yeah,
we always hang out,

532
00:35:43.351 --> 00:35:48.180
but he only,
he does stuff.
Yeah.
Right.
Okay.
Yeah.
That's pretty funny.
Yeah.

533
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:53.010
Oh yeah.
He does a good friend though.
Nobody has a good friend.

534
00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:57.540
My Dad is a good friend.
Yeah.
A friend.
Yeah.
Yeah,
for sure.
Yeah,
of course.

535
00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:02.300
It seems like a,
is it bro?
He keeps it to fucking sell 100 dude.
Yeah,

536
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:06.540
go to the Strip club.
Um,
this guy reminded me,
a lot of you,

537
00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:11.460
so I wanted to bring this clip up,
see if this reminds you of yourself.

Baby Jane Love.
You know what I'm saying?</v>

539
00:36:13.481 --> 00:36:15.910

543
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:31.880
that's a white guy that we're listening to.
Yeah.
Um,
I don't do it.

544
00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:35.020
It sounds like you,
I think a lot of people will be like,
oh my God,

545
00:36:35.021 --> 00:36:35.880
I thought that was Christina.

546
00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:41.140
This dude is apparently a big producer in the mix tape game.

547
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:45.820
[inaudible] he put out one of nozzles,
mix tapes and he put out,

548
00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:50.820
uh,
he worked on a ghost face killer.
Kool g rap mix tape.
Hmm.

549
00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:54.970
Let me see.

Um,
but apparently he really,
he's real comfortable with the big words.

551
00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.520
Sounds like it.
Especially for,

They're like bandwagon,</v>

553
00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:06.241

554
00:37:06.241 --> 00:37:09.240
Like let's say one niggers want shop play one following,

555
00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:12.430
you know what I'm saying?
He's just scared to take chances.

556
00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.130
Scared to play records.
You know what I'm saying?

557
00:37:14.131 --> 00:37:16.950
It's like everybody got an always,

559
00:37:18.901 --> 00:37:21.090

560
00:37:21.091 --> 00:37:22.280

You know what I'm saying?

567
00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:50.680
<v 0>Yeah.
I hate,
he's also really good to know sayings.
It's kind of doing both.</v>

568
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:55.100
He's doing that.
Yeah.
And you know what's neat too about this video is the beard,

569
00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:58.600
the poor lighting,
the beard center for the Audio.
The audio

570
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.440
throughout Jesus eating his homeboy would have just flicked on any light.

571
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:08.590
Yeah.
Jay Love Man.
Jay Love.

572

<v 10>So Dj is Debbie Quinn.</v>

573
00:38:11.681 --> 00:38:16.681
Like cds were like baby songs or 15 seconds put out a CD every three days just

574
00:38:18.591 --> 00:38:20.810
like,
Yo,
you're cold bull son.
You know what I'm saying?

575
00:38:20.811 --> 00:38:25.150
But that's because nick has only sell 203 on it.
So please,

576
00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:28.430
please,
please,
please take it for free.
You know,

577
00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:34.250
<v 0>can I,
and I'm wondering the sincerely,
like what point as a white person,</v>

578
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:38.710
it sounds like there's a black guy in the room with him if I'm not mistaken.

579
00:38:38.711 --> 00:38:39.740
It does sound like that.
Yeah.

580
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.420
Like how does that happen where you're given the past?

581
00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:46.430
I think it's a good question.
I think the answer is over time.

582
00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:52.920
This dude is so deep in hip hop and specifically with,

583
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.060
seems like with New York guys,

584
00:38:55.540 --> 00:39:00.540
which means that he's hanging out with like real street dudes and he probably,

585
00:39:00.821 --> 00:39:02.110
you know what it probably is what I think it is.

586
00:39:02.111 --> 00:39:05.190
If you're a New York guy like him,
you're hanging out.
Yeah.

587
00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.130
With a lot of black guys.

588
00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:09.990
But then you hang out with a lot of light Puerto Rican guys who are like,

589
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.020
some of them technically not black and they talk like this.
So then you're like,

590
00:39:14.021 --> 00:39:17.320
that's not a black guy.
He talks like this.
He gets away with it.

591
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:21.250
Then if you have success with,
um,
you know,

592
00:39:21.251 --> 00:39:25.630
he's worked on a nas mix tape.
It looks like he's worked on a rock Kim mix tape.

593
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:30.550
He's worked on mob deep Dmx,
Lord Finesse Craig g Masta Ace,

594
00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:34.450
like all these guys.
And if they're talking to him like that and they start,

595
00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:39.340
you know,
making him feel like that's,
you know,
okay,

596
00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:42.960
whatever they get there.
That's what I think it's just,
it's just over,

597
00:39:42.961 --> 00:39:47.440
over time that first time,
like where he drops it,
you know?
And it's a risk.

598
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:52.190
Yeah.
Okay.
I guess I can keep going.

599
00:39:52.191 --> 00:39:55.090
He's probably said to him,
it's spoken so heavily around him.

600
00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:59.470
It's like becoming fluent in a language,
you know,
fits your culture and yeah.

601
00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:03.400
But yeah,
I guess you're just,
you're in the culture now is interesting.
And it is,

602
00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:08.080
I think it like,
yeah,
when you're like really,
um,
you know,

603
00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.750
when you're learning language,
really learning it,

604
00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:15.930
you go to that country and you live there and after a while it starts to come

605
00:40:16.061 --> 00:40:18.720
out of you naturally.
Right.
So he's hanging out with brothers.

606
00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:23.950
This is like an in studio street talk exactly like this.

607
00:40:23.951 --> 00:40:28.390
Like he's actually sounding exactly cadence wise.

608
00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:31.930
Like,
like a hip Hop New York black dude

609
00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:39.640
told bull son calling on me.
Yeah.
That's how,
like that's like a,

610
00:40:39.641 --> 00:40:44.641
how a guy who's probably at this point 40 or older talks about like you,

611
00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:51.750
I mean like a Dj who's 45 would be like,
Yo,
you will call them both.

612
00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:54.160
So he just picked up on all that.

613
00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:56.540
It's what's what he was all he knows is what he's surrounded.

614
00:40:56.541 --> 00:41:01.510
Just I wish I could see black people's faces when he,
you know what I mean?

615
00:41:01.511 --> 00:41:03.600
Like they could send us pictures of it as they were like,

616
00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:08.470
you guys want to go ahead and send us a picture of your face as you're heard

617
00:41:08.471 --> 00:41:12.340
this or is like,
there's probably people right now who are like,

618
00:41:12.341 --> 00:41:16.880
there's no way this guy's white and he's super white too.
Irish pasty.
Yeah,

619
00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.750
he's white.
Yeah.
He's,

620
00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:24.250
we had this conversation when I did,
um,
I did Jim and Sam.

621
00:41:24.251 --> 00:41:28.570
I did them this week when they were in la,
but two weeks ago in New York and um,

622
00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:32.420
Jim was out,
but Sam was,
was hosting,
we had the,
a,

623
00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:37.940
a little bit of the n word because there was a Fox News contributor,

624
00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:38.640
uh,
who,

625
00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:43.640
who's black in studio and about like white people being able to use it.

626
00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:49.550
Oh,
her position,
her position was like,
and no negative,
negative.
Negative.

627
00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:54.650
Yeah.
Well maybe you know,
my position was if you're in your car alone,
how bad it,

628
00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.490
I've always thought that the song thing is absurd.

629
00:41:58.491 --> 00:42:00.590
Like to be like you can't say it when you're singing a song.

630
00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:04.100
You can say it if you're saying in the song,
but use common sense.
Right?

631
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:08.000
Like it's in a song,
I'm sorry a white person can't say it if it's like,

632
00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:11.660
well give that Jay z song,
but I'm saying is in Paris when you request.
Right.

633
00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:17.000
But my point is that you're an asshole and you know what you're doing.
Right.

634
00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:20.360
If you're saying it out loud and like looking at a black guy,

635
00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:24.990
like don't be stupid.
That's obviously like that's,
you know,

636
00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:27.170
that to me is just common sense,
right?

637
00:42:27.171 --> 00:42:30.020
You gotta be selective when you're saying then where does what you're saying?

638
00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:33.200
Well,
I'm saying like,
you know,
it's in a song so you have,

639
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:35.450
you can repeat a song like no one's gonna tell you.
Right,
right.

640
00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:39.190
But like is there is also just stupidity,
like,
yeah.

641
00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:40.830
If you're trying to do it to,

642
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:44.510
to test whether or not you're going to get in trouble,
that's dumb.
That's dumb.

643
00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.990
Yeah.
You can,
you sing your song really driving in your car,

644
00:42:47.991 --> 00:42:50.630
obviously you're going to sing it then.
You know what I mean?

645
00:42:50.631 --> 00:42:53.070
Like you're not going to get a sense of yourself in the car.
Yeah.

646
00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:55.910
Like it's silly to,
yeah.
Anyways,

647
00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:59.310
<v 10>it's declining.
It's Dick Rod and all the cross man swag.</v>

648
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.350
Whoever's the hardest thing to get to China.
Wow.

649
00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:06.450
But it flowers same biggie.
You know what I'm saying?
They use it.
It'll Nigga,

650
00:43:06.451 --> 00:43:10.430
because you started that commercial shit.
Shit.

651
00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:15.630
<v 0>This dude really is deep in his,
yeah,
it's his,
it's his world.
But this is like a,</v>

652
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:20.430
like a Truman show experiment.
There's something,
you know,
like he's really deep.

653
00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:24.820
Deep in.
Yeah.
It's like becoming a,

654
00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:28.170
a hip hop DJ,

655
00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:33.200
but also 100% of the way of black.
They would do it.
Yeah.
She's sharing that.

656
00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:37.170
Yeah.
We gotta get,
we gotta get her out of there then.
Hey.
Hey schnitzel dude.

657
00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:41.710

I know.
Come on man.
I don't know.</v>

658
00:43:41.711 --> 00:43:42.490
I don't want to kick her out

659
00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:44.350
<v 0>cause then they're just going to bark.
We got to get that out of her,</v>

660
00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.250
<v 11>out of her hands,
Babe.
Okay.
Schnitzel.</v>

661
00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:54.450
Oh my God was she just kind of picks on all stuff on the ground,

662
00:43:54.451 --> 00:43:58.320

Okay.
I can't.
Okay.
It's just like a nut.

663
00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:03.060
It's just a constant thing with her.
Maybe I should just create them.

664
00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:08.520
I Dunno.
She did so come.
You're dumb dumb.

Can you pick that stuff up?
I can't.

667
00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:22.380
I can't reach it until I have to take off everything.
Okay.

668
00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:25.140
She just going to go get it.
There's a million other thing on the floor,

669
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:27.970

They're like band wagon Niggas,

674
00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.900

675
00:44:42.901 --> 00:44:44.680
you know what I'm saying?
I'm the same way.
You don't see,

you know what I'm saying?

683

Niggas ain't trying to be both the lab and in the streets,

They can know what I'm saying.

686

The big word founding from the have to super cuts.

You don't know what I'm saying.

696
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:37.980

Then when I don't know.</v>

700
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:49.410
You know what I'm saying?
I don't know.

701
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:54.810
Why doesn't my fucking caffeine thing work?
I don't know Booboo,

702
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:59.280
why I fucking downloaded it.
I've activated it.
Why the fuck doesn't it work?

703
00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:03.040
<v 11>I don't know.
Anti blue.
Bam.
Look at it.
God dammit,</v>

704
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:05.140
mother fucker.

705
00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:09.770
<v 2>His facial hair was horrendous.
Yeah,
it was bad.
It was really bad.
God,</v>

706
00:46:09.771 --> 00:46:14.720
that was more distracting than the the [inaudible].
That's terrible.
Look good.

707
00:46:14.721 --> 00:46:18.950
Look.
That is not good for him.
Especially when you've got two chins.

708
00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:23.360
You gotta be real careful.
Yeah,
you do.
But you know he's doing his thing.

709
00:46:23.361 --> 00:46:25.490
You know what I'm saying?
It's,
you know what I'm saying?
It's all about the,

710
00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:29.240
the cut of the beer.
Yeah.
You know,
like that you have a thicker beard,

711
00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:30.050
a thicker beard.

712
00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:34.880
Like I'm below deck that the captain who shaves it like it's right here,

713
00:46:34.881 --> 00:46:37.490
bro,
on the Jawline,
right on the jawline and you can't do that.

714
00:46:37.491 --> 00:46:42.140
You got to build yourself a job.
Like how you do it is great.

715
00:46:42.141 --> 00:46:46.460
Burt's got a great beard too.
You got to do it that way.
Yeah.
Yeah.

716
00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.950
If you're a big guy,
he's an even live here or not.

717
00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:53.810
I just think that beard cut is a horrendous to do it right on the,
uh,
the chin.

718
00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:56.140
<v 11>No Good God dammit.</v>

I'd like to meet crazy looks at my San Jose show.
Are you sure you ready now?

749
00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:30.690
I think I'm ready,
but I think I started training.
I know I'll keep pushing,

750
00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:33.240
you know,
if I win that Burt bet,
I'll be that much better at this.

751
00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:37.260
So get ready Kate [inaudible] am a trainee.

756
00:49:55.590 --> 00:50:00.150

really horrified.

757
00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:03.170
Ready?
Here we go.
Hmm.

758
00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:07.700
<v 10>I don't like these down.
Yes.</v>

759
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:10.560
I want to go home and smoke a fucking huge fucking,

760
00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:15.480
oh fuck dude.
Oh my God.

761
00:50:15.481 --> 00:50:19.320
I hit the shit out of a fucking bear.
Are you here?

762
00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:23.880
Oh my God.
That's not cool.

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:29.000
I got to get off the phone.

Um,

764
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:31.920
<v 2>hilarious.

No,
it was like,</v>

765
00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:36.650
it looked like it was a bummer.
I don't know who was laugh at that one.

766
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:38.180
Hitting an innocent bear.

767
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:42.670
<v 0>I think that's the point.
Jesus man,</v>

768
00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:47.550
<v 2>and it was a bummer.
I hope that the bear seemed to be okay.
They like walk</v>

769
00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:51.210
<v 0>did off.
Yeah,
he did.
God,
I was terrible.</v>

770
00:50:52.530 --> 00:50:56.440
Imagine how resilient they are,
how big they are,

771
00:50:56.870 --> 00:51:01.290
I think weighs how much as much as the car at least I don't know about that,

772
00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:05.400
but that's a big fucker and he went rolling and then got up and just walk in the

773
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:10.350
woods.
I was terrible.
All right.

774
00:51:10.351 --> 00:51:15.120
Well definitely horrible.
Thanks.
Thank you for sending that in and horrifying us.

775
00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:19.980
That really,
God,
I don't want to see that shift to take care of the Schnitz.

776
00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:25.350
She's chilling again.
Vamp for a minute.
You want to just talk?
Okay.
Yeah,
go ahead.

777
00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:30.960
Come on guys.
Fucking Schnitz.

778
00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:40.590
Oh my God,
that was so,
so bad.

779
00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:48.050
Please never send me an animal getting a hit by a car hit send me people getting

780
00:51:48.051 --> 00:51:52.550
hit by a car.
That's the shit I find funny.
Um,
and not hit,

781
00:51:52.551 --> 00:51:53.300
you know what I mean?

782
00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:56.900
I don't want to see someone killed just something with a funny reaction.

783
00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:02.100
He didn't see a reaction when an animal gets hit.
It's just sad.
God dammit.

784
00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:04.950
All right.
Um,

785
00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:11.640
I've been to the Ali Museum.
What am I going to do and fucking Lewisville.

786
00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:17.540
I gotta find something to do on a Saturday.

787
00:52:19.110 --> 00:52:22.620
Yeah.
Any Friday.
Oh good.

788
00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:28.230
You talk about what happened about yeah.
No,

789
00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:32.790
you want to tell him shit,
go ahead.
So

790
00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:38.720
<v 2>last night you came home from the road and I made some vegetables,</v>

791
00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:43.940
Sunday dinner and some chicken.
I was standing,
I let the dogs out.

792
00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:45.113
Yeah.

793
00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:50.150
And I burped and farted at the same time and I go,
oh my God,
who am I?

794
00:52:50.151 --> 00:52:54.750
God had double pipe.
Classic.
Yeah.
And you went,
I only heard the burp.
The you,

795
00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:58.230
you didn't even acknowledge my hard work.
Yeah.

796
00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:01.580
It's kind of upsetting when someone doesn't hear it,

797
00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:05.390
but that's my second double pipe.
Classic.
This year,

798
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:08.390
5:01 PM last night.

799
00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:14.160
<v 0>I didn't hear the Fart and that's why I didn't say much.</v>

800
00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:19.570
<v 2>No,
I didn't panties late.</v>

801
00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:26.490
Um,
but what's interesting is that I forced the burp out,

802
00:53:26.491 --> 00:53:30.330
but I didn't know the Fart was coming.
Well,
that's usually how it happens.

803
00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:34.590
It doesn't really happen organically is what you're saying.

804
00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:38.490
Like usually you're pushing one,
right.

805
00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:41.880
Other ones the surprise.
You're right.
Yeah.
Oh my God,
you're right.

806
00:53:41.881 --> 00:53:42.860
Because you're pushing

807
00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:45.420
<v 4>cause like it,
it'll be like you,
let's say you lean up to Fart,</v>

808
00:53:45.830 --> 00:53:49.950
but there happens to be a gas bubble you don't recognize in your chest.

809
00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:52.980
<v 2>Right.
So you got foreign,
but Barb comes out,
you're so right.</v>

810
00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:58.830
The push of burp out fart sneaks out.
Either way.
It's awesome.
I mean,

811
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:05.460
it goes great.
Do you realize what a revelation that is,
what you just said,

812
00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:10.140
like you figured out the essence of the double pipe.
Yeah.
And you're really,

813
00:54:10.141 --> 00:54:12.740
what you're doing is helping people listening.
Yeah.

814
00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:15.870
You're helping them get theirs.
Yeah.
Because we didn't really,

815
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:18.720
we didn't really put that together that

816
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:25.980
you kind of are pushing and that's why that happened.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh Wow.

817
00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:30.450
What a neat revelation.
Oh yeah.

818
00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:34.620
What a neat revelation.
Wow,
that's pretty cool.

819
00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:40.380
And we're celebrating something major tomorrow.
Yeah.
Big Time.

820
00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:43.290
We're going to go away for the one for one night.

821
00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:47.250
Stay at a hotel that we stayed at how many years ago

822
00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:50.820
<v 4>we stayed at this hotel.
Um,</v>

823
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:54.210
I wanna say somewhere between 10 and 12 years ago.

824
00:54:54.370 --> 00:54:57.530
<v 2>Isn't that crazy?
Yeah.
And we were just dating.
Yeah.</v>

825
00:54:57.680 --> 00:54:59.680
Cause it's our Banis Murphy.
Yeah.

826
00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:00.820
<v 4>So better,
smarter for knee.</v>

827
00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:06.450
And also we're going to the hotel that is the baddest Murphy,

828
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:08.740
any of our first raw dog.

829
00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:13.290
<v 2>Right.
You,
and it's funny because you bring that up.</v>

830
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:17.200
<v 4>I talked about it on stage this weekend about,
I asked the guy,</v>

831
00:55:17.201 --> 00:55:19.150
the couple in the front row,
I was like,

832
00:55:19.151 --> 00:55:23.140
do you remember the first time she told you you don't have to wear a condom?

833
00:55:23.141 --> 00:55:27.910
And he goes,
yes.
I go see it's,
it's burned into our memory is like a,

834
00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:32.000
yeah,
like a significant date.
And the animals.
Yeah,
like a,

835
00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:37.090
but it's like an important,
and it is,
it's like for a guy,

836
00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:38.081
I mean there's some,

837
00:55:38.081 --> 00:55:41.270
obviously everyone's been with some sketchy chicks who are like,
go ahead.
Right.

838
00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:45.130
Just you know,
but like I'm saying,
when your girl you're dating,

839
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:50.530
you're covered up and she's like,
you don't need that anymore.
That's like,

840
00:55:50.531 --> 00:55:51.290
Whoa,

841
00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:52.120
<v 2>that's it's,</v>

842
00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:57.120
it's a mark of intimacy course because it means I trust that you're not banging

843
00:55:57.861 --> 00:55:58.694
around right.

844
00:55:58.730 --> 00:56:03.730
That you're the only one that's gonna the GOC [inaudible] in around this area.

845
00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:08.090
That's a big deal.
It is a big deal.

846
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:11.180
It means your exclusive when you take that rubber off and we haven't put a

847
00:56:11.181 --> 00:56:14.000
rubber on since.
No,
no,
not really.

848
00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:19.550
Mostly not.
I'm really excited.
Our band a smurf knee

849
00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:23.450
<v 4>are mass,
but most importantly,
the raw dog,
the first,</v>

850
00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:29.700
<v 2>the most important,
and we're going to tell our son about it.
I remember,</v>

851
00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:33.670
I remember you remember the first thing when we,
I was like,
well,
if we go there,

852
00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:37.690
that's the raw dog place.
Oh,
you knew that that was going to happen.
No,
no.

853
00:56:37.691 --> 00:56:42.560
I'm saying that's what I remember about that place too.
Saying like,

854
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:46.150
you don't have to wear that.
And I was like,
I remember also if you're a guy,

855
00:56:46.151 --> 00:56:49.250
just enough girl ever says like,
you don't need to wear one.
Right.

856
00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:52.420
Don't say anything,
just shut up again.
Except the gift.

857
00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:54.360
That's exactly what I was getting was like,

858
00:56:55.790 --> 00:57:00.720
but you know what I remember from that first.
That was our first getaway.
Yeah.

859
00:57:01.210 --> 00:57:04.140
And we went away for like two nights,
two nights.
You're that you were good.

860
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:05.620
Just plowed so hard.

861
00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:10.090
And I didn't make a brown for too old because we weren't shit in front of each

862
00:57:10.091 --> 00:57:11.530
other yet.
We hadn't started that.

863
00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:16.890
And I had to hold it and Brown for two fucking days because I didn't go to the

864
00:57:16.961 --> 00:57:21.040
lobby and make it.
So what happened was,
is I eventually was like,
oh,

865
00:57:21.041 --> 00:57:22.690
I'm going to go for a walk.
And then I,

866
00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:26.170
but then I was afraid of being away for too long and that you pick up on it that

867
00:57:26.171 --> 00:57:30.690
I was browning.
I tried going at a restaurant we went to like,
yeah,

868
00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:36.370
well I couldn't shit cause here's why that the hotel room was set up such that

869
00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:40.270
whatever's happening in the bathroom,
the other person can hear it smell.

870
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:43.360
It wasn't,
it's not like a closed door.
It was like the um,

871
00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:46.450
I wonder if you'll offer the same level of

872
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:51.270
courtesy on this trip.
Yeah.
Doors are

873
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:56.670
going to go see if the news right.
No Dude,

874
00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.650
but I tried to,
shit,
we went out for dinner.

875
00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:02.620
I'd like this Mediterranean restaurant and I'll never forget that I tried to

876
00:58:02.621 --> 00:58:04.450
shit during dinner during dinner,

877
00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:10.030
but I was so nervous and backed up that I didn't Brown.
I wonder,

878
00:58:10.050 --> 00:58:13.890
uh,
by the way,
I have audio of that,

879
00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:16.120
that hotel when we were there 10 years ago,

880
00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:28.140
<v 12>[inaudible]</v>

881
00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:40.010
<v 2>kind of wish you would've said something.</v>

882
00:58:40.011 --> 00:58:43.820
I didn't know I was being a nice present and bring it up all these years later.

883
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:46.850
How long have we been together total?

884
00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:50.750
I always forget blood block it out a little.
I Dunno.

885
00:58:51.350 --> 00:58:53.300
No serious altogether.

886
00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:57.320
It's probably oh five we started right,

887
00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:02.690
so almost 12 years.
So crazy.
But we've been married for,

888
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:06.980
this will be our eighth wow.
Yup.
All those farts.

889
00:59:06.981 --> 00:59:11.900
Can you imagine our eighth anniversary?
I count your tits in the morning.

890
00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:15.500
I count your farts.

891
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:21.530
You've got dog tits shut up like you nurse puppies and then they grew to you.

892
00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:25.730
You have tests where it looks like you have a couple of pairs of Ted's tied

893
00:59:25.731 --> 00:59:29.510
together.
And then if you,
if you pull them apart,
there'd be tits inside of them.

894
00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:31.340
You know what?

895
00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:35.060
We used to play this game before I had Ellis where we'd squeeze each other's

896
00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:37.970
bellies.
Yeah,
but we do,

897
00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:42.650
it's not fair anymore because I grew a person in mind and minds extra stretched

898
00:59:42.651 --> 00:59:46.670
out and my tits are extra loose and low now.
It's not fair.

899
00:59:46.671 --> 00:59:51.660
You can't grab my stomach meet anymore.
I sure can.
It's not fair.
Well,
it's life.

900
00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:55.340
You have an unfair advantage because I made her son,
here's you from last.

901
00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:56.553
<v 5>Oh,</v>

902
01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:06.330
<v 2>I like it when he goes.
Oh No,
I think he's winded from the far.</v>

903
01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:13.830
<v 5>Oh Damn.
Oh Damn.</v>

904
01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:19.640
I like that one too.
It's good.
Yeah.
Oh my gosh.

905
01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:26.860
<v 2>So that's neat.
We're going to check into the hotel tomorrow.</v>

906
01:00:26.861 --> 01:00:31.540
We're staying for one night.
Yeah.
And we're going to raw dog it again,
dog.

907
01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:35.270
Yeah.
If we don't pass out by 8:00 PM cause we're so tired,

908
01:00:35.290 --> 01:00:37.960
I know it's probably going to happen.
Right.
We're going to be like,

909
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:41.190
well I haven't had alcohol now and two weeks.

910
01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:44.740
I'm really excited to have a glass of wine.
Yeah.

911
01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:49.750
And I'll probably eat a lot of proof judo and cheese and pickles and I'll

912
01:00:49.751 --> 01:00:53.980
probably be asleep by eight o'clock.
Hmm.
For sure.
So you better get it in.
Right.

913
01:00:53.981 --> 01:00:55.870
And we check in if you know what I'm saying.
Oh yeah.

914
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:59.740
Oh my gosh.

915
01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:06.820
So dammit.
And what's wrong?
Jeans.

916
01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:10.280
I wanted to play something.
Genes.
Genes are Ronin jeans,

917
01:01:10.290 --> 01:01:14.710
jeans are moaning and get everybody that um,
submitted,

918
01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:20.050
uh,
what's it called for the master?

919
01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:24.400
What is it that you submit?
Patriot.
Patriot.
Put that shit down.

920
01:01:25.090 --> 01:01:26.560
Yeah.
Uh,

921
01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:30.130
that was a really fun episode we just recorded at Patriot and put that down.

922
01:01:33.370 --> 01:01:35.040
That was cool man.
Put that shit down.

923
01:01:35.050 --> 01:01:37.900
Just looking at my notes because I had something written down then I forgot.

924
01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:42.790
That was really fun.
So make sure you check it out.
Um,
here we go.

925
01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:45.880
Oh,
what did you guys need to play?

926
01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.850
<v 13>Um,
yeah,
but you go ahead.
Go ahead.</v>

927
01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:52.530
<v 2>No,
we can play your shit.
Play Shit.</v>

928
01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:55.800
<v 13>Uh,
here's the thing I wanted to play.</v>

929
01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:02.390
<v 5>Ladies and gentlemen.
Tom Said,</v>

930
01:02:03.730 --> 01:02:05.720
master of vaccines.

931
01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:11.380
<v 2>Um hmm.
Well,</v>

932
01:02:11.381 --> 01:02:16.381
the reason I wanted to play for you is we have such an amazing accent and I

933
01:02:16.631 --> 01:02:19.860
don't know where this person is from.
I don't know if he could maybe help me

934
01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:24.360
<v 0>try to guess their nationality.
Are you ready?
Here we go.</v>

935
01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:32.780
<v 12>[inaudible] hours.</v>

936
01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:06.650
<v 0>Lindsay Lohan.
What the fuck is going on with her?
It's exactly that.</v>

937
01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:07.650
What you should be saying.

938
01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:12.000
What in the fuck is going on and what should we do you know who used to do

939
01:03:12.001 --> 01:03:14.760
something like this?
A version of this,
Donna?
Yes,

940
01:03:14.761 --> 01:03:18.150
but I'm talking about not as well known top dog.

941
01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:23.550
When I would have so many Peruvian relatives stay,

942
01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:27.360
he would start to talk to them in English,

943
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:32.640
the way they spoke English because he thinks that they would understand that.

944
01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:34.230
Like he would go

945
01:03:35.890 --> 01:03:40.890
when Neato so today you saw the zoo,

946
01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:46.260
it was nice and we're the people,
they're nice to you.

947
01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:50.250
Can I be like,
why are you talking to him?

948
01:03:50.251 --> 01:03:53.030
The way he speaks English and they won't help,
you know,

949
01:03:53.031 --> 01:03:54.480
he would talk to them like that.
Yeah.

950
01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:59.580
So I think what happened is that she's been hanging out with these great people.

951
01:03:59.581 --> 01:04:04.581
Obviously it sounds to me like an Irish Guatemalan and Irish Guatemala,

952
01:04:05.330 --> 01:04:08.790
a hybrid between Guatemalan and Irish.
The Irish thing there.

953
01:04:08.791 --> 01:04:10.980
But then it sounded to me,
the more I listened to it,

954
01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:15.180
it sounded to me like it was,

955
01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:16.380
uh,

956
01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:22.820
maybe a lot of time with the Greeks and that the Greeks who speak English have

957
01:04:23.521 --> 01:04:26.610
that application.
I'm trying to think of what the Greek accent,

958
01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:28.590
because I've been there with sound like Latin,

959
01:04:28.650 --> 01:04:33.480
but I'm saying like it's her diffused version of that weird.
So weird.

960
01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:35.420
<v 12>So people are scared of</v>

961
01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:43.660
[inaudible].

962
01:04:53.850 --> 01:04:58.700
<v 0>Yes,
she,
it sounds Irish kind of,
but then purpose I think.</v>

963
01:04:58.710 --> 01:05:02.910
But she also is speaking in broken English,

964
01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.850
which is like if,
if she hung out with,
let's say,

965
01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.410
like she's hanging out with some,

966
01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:12.890
at some exotic like high society Greek lady who doesn't speak around 100%

967
01:05:13.051 --> 01:05:16.380
English is like,
I hung out and you know,
with my,
uh,

968
01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:18.220
<v 12>I will say</v>

969
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:21.970
<v 2>there's something important that people don't recognize that we're on a good</v>

970
01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:26.520
nightlife.
I cannot find tonight.
But tomorrow when you,
if you go

971
01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:32.740
between Germany,
all of the UN nations,
the five,
the Bible Bibles,

972
01:05:32.890 --> 01:05:36.220
English is bigger than weird.
She's speaking with like,

973
01:05:36.221 --> 01:05:37.610
she doesn't really speak fucking English.

974
01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:40.070
It's like the foreign accent syndrome people.

975
01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:44.730
They would also lose the ability to speak grammatically correct English.

976
01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:46.220
This is so bizarre.

977
01:05:46.221 --> 01:05:51.170
She's gotta be hanging out with some old Greek millionaire.

978
01:05:51.171 --> 01:05:52.520
Yes.
Or whatever.
I think so.

979
01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:56.920
<v 12>Doesn't speed grease.
Welcome so many refugees from Syria.</v>

980
01:05:57.810 --> 01:06:02.690
<v 2>She's fucking weird,
man.
She is a member.
When Madonna did that,
when she was,</v>

981
01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:05.660
when she first moved to England and she was really bad.

982
01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:10.780
It wasn't sufferable and moving to England and we'd leg it looks like,

983
01:06:11.131 --> 01:06:15.500
you know,
like shut up.
You're from Michigan,
like Michigan.

984
01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:20.340
She's not from fucking London town arb,
five lads.

985
01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:24.810
This is a Madonna evolution of her accident.

986
01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:27.470
<v 12>Oh,
for your the witch's hat.
Where's my stuff?</v>

987
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:32.240
<v 2>Say it's not as dramatic as I remember it being.
She was a little,
she was worse.</v>

988
01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.400
Yeah.
Why works?
I don't think these clips are that.

989
01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:38.630
I don't think they're indicative of how far she went into being English.
Yeah.

990
01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:42.560
Um,
but I totally think you can pick that up.
Like,
you know,

991
01:06:43.070 --> 01:06:44.900
when I lived in England,
when I came back,

992
01:06:44.901 --> 01:06:48.430
I picked up some stuff just because if all you're hearing is that stuff.
Yeah.

993
01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:51.510
And then you come back and you're like,
speaking of accents,

994
01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:53.510
you remember this from last week,
right?

995
01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:57.160
<v 5>We got out,
he was the gas we bought.
And look at the truck at the moment.</v>

996
01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.073
This is why

997
01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:04.060
we've been slapping marriage battle.

998
01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:07.730
Who's my Hong Kong fucking along here?

999
01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:13.110
Just glass and glass all of a sudden,
clearly I didn't even know.

1000
01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:14.900
I didn't even put my head on.
I'm like,
God,

1001
01:07:14.901 --> 01:07:19.230
we're just glassing these big huge bedrooms.
Love Him.
Um,

1002
01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:23.930
glass.
Just glad.
Awesome Bro.
We're just glass.
Just glue.

1003
01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:25.460
We were out there,

1004
01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.780
glass and the murder.
He's so good.

1005
01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:32.090
<v 2>Doug.
I just,</v>

1006
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:37.530
I just want to be excited about anything in my life as it goes,
as this guy,

1007
01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:41.130
right?
Yeah.
Wouldn't you just give anything to be this excited?

1008
01:07:41.790 --> 01:07:45.900
Oh my God.
Yeah.
That any at his age as an adult.
Yeah.

1009
01:07:45.901 --> 01:07:50.790
It's pretty cool.
Or the glass.
And um,
so there was this thing said last week.

1010
01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:53.940
I'm just glad you,
you were,

1011
01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:59.100
I said he was Canadian.
Oh fuck off.
What is he?
He's from Colorado.

1012
01:07:59.430 --> 01:08:01.440
It's the same.
It's very similar.

1013
01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:06.810
<v 5>Been slumping along here.
Glass,
glass and glass.</v>

1014
01:08:06.811 --> 01:08:11.760
And we're just glad.
Glad.
Well,
it's glass on glass door.
I'm like,
no,

1015
01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:16.110
just glass.
And how surprised that you said,
I would say,
wow,

1016
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:20.030
<v 14>how do we know that?
Wait a minute.
How do you know he's from Denver?</v>

1017
01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:24.620
<v 2>Because they found who he was.
His name is like Todd.
Okay.
He's known.</v>

1018
01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:28.640
He's known a hundred guys.
So some of the listeners found him.

1019
01:08:29.690 --> 01:08:34.690
Maybe he spent time in Canadia Madonna or anything.

1020
01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:39.470
The Canadian about his accident though.
Sounds sounds good to me guys.

1021
01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:43.560
Look,
I know you're the master,
but I'm the mistress of accents and I,

1022
01:08:43.710 --> 01:08:48.530
I hear Canadian.
Well,
this person says,
dear Mommy P and water champ.
Towson.

1023
01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:50.550
I was stunned when Molly's,

1024
01:08:50.551 --> 01:08:55.551
he had the audacity to disagree with the main mommy slash master of accents.

1025
01:08:56.121 --> 01:08:56.954
Tommy,

1026
01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:02.260
I lived north of the wall in Canada for two years and have a Canadian baby

1027
01:09:02.571 --> 01:09:05.930
jeans,
the adjust glass and guys clearly not Canadian.

1028
01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.750
His vows aren't nearly far back enough in his mouth.

1029
01:09:09.290 --> 01:09:12.620
He sounds exactly like Joe Rogan's friend Cameron Hanes who was from Oregon.

1030
01:09:12.770 --> 01:09:16.640
It turns out this guy from Colorado.
Okay.
Anyways,
love you both.

1031
01:09:17.210 --> 01:09:20.750
Thank you Josh.
Just glisten guys.
Great.

1032
01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:26.560
Um,
anyways,
um,
I think you guys are wrong and I'm,

1033
01:09:26.561 --> 01:09:28.890
I'm looking forward to finding out that that guy's from Canadian.

1034
01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:33.060
He's not from Canadian as a Windsor native,
a proud as amazing.

1035
01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:38.270
You should know more.
I was born in Windsor,

1036
01:09:38.270 --> 01:09:42.170
Ontario and then I moved to La when I was four guys because people have been

1037
01:09:42.171 --> 01:09:45.210
like,
oh,
you're from the valley or are you from kin?

1038
01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:49.100
What was boring winter so you guys can suck on those nuts.
Okay.

1039
01:09:49.690 --> 01:09:53.150
Proud Windsor Native Ontario Cross from de Trois.

1040
01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:57.720
It's been a while since you've been home though,
right?
Classy as a guest.
Yeah.

1041
01:09:57.721 --> 01:10:01.340
I've,
I've only,
I've never even seen it since we left.
I don't know it.

1042
01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:05.750
You don't know Windsor at all?
You should go.
I should go.
Yeah,
let's go.

1043
01:10:05.751 --> 01:10:10.100
Let's make a trip.
A pilgrimage
Ontario trip.

1044
01:10:10.670 --> 01:10:14.540
Uh,
yeah.
My Dad showed me a picture of the apartment complex we lived in.

1045
01:10:14.541 --> 01:10:17.420
It looks real nice.
Well,

1046
01:10:17.421 --> 01:10:22.010
my poor immigrant parents escape from communist Hungary with like $10.

1047
01:10:22.011 --> 01:10:25.250
Windsor took them in the loving arms of Canada,
which is really nice.

1048
01:10:25.251 --> 01:10:28.910
How rough was the complex?
It didn't look like fancy,

1049
01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:34.790
sad,
faster when the answer's no.
It was a hard knocks.

1050
01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:40.250
Hard.
Cox.
Um,
but look how far we've come.
Moved on up,
man.

1051
01:10:40.251 --> 01:10:44.470
Like the Jeffersons.
Yeah,
man.
Thanks to Canadia.
Thank you to Canada Canadian.

1052
01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:47.190
Taking my family and dude,
hold on.

1053
01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:55.580
Did you hear it?
No.
Oh,
I had to pee at the same time.
You're about to Shit,

1054
01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:57.733
Huh?

1055
01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:01.340
<v 14>What does it mean you better get your life?
I don't know what this,</v>

1056
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:03.223
I have no idea.

1057
01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:12.030
When you do your show and somebody who's just like really out of pocket.
Okay.

1058
01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:14.760
Okay.
Nobody believes this story.

1059
01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:23.220
We'll cow's milk cause
this is not the business.

1060
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:29.250
<v 2>I love it.
She said out of pocket.
That's a new one to somebody out of pocket.</v>

1061
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:33.420
It sounds like.
I've never heard that.
I have for about 25 years.

1062
01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:34.600
You're kidding.
No.

1063
01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:39.620
Where have I been in white America cries square I think.

1064
01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:44.100
I think it's funny that she was trying to explain this square,

1065
01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:47.280
get your life and then she was with someone was out of pocket.

1066
01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:53.550
I've had a few guests that were out of pocket.

1067
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:57.870
That's how I would've reacted though.
Of course.
You know what I'm saying?
You,

1068
01:11:58.450 --> 01:12:02.220
I'm such a bull
shit.

1069
01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:07.110
Like 80 tracks,
10 seconds.
He's the only move like two,
300

1070
01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:11.960
we do have a gift for you.

1071
01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:16.700
<v 14>Oh,</v>

1072
01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:23.870
<v 2>is pregnant again.
Wow.</v>

1073
01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:27.120
I thought she was adamant that she was never going to do that again because you

1074
01:12:27.121 --> 01:12:32.010
got a baby coming.
I know.
Wasn't she big time about like never again.

1075
01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:34.800
She did not like being pregnant.
I think she had a rough pregnancy.

1076
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:38.460
That's awesome.
I don't think she liked any aspect of it.
Didn't she?

1077
01:12:38.461 --> 01:12:41.190
Not like newborn mass spec.
None of it.

1078
01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:45.060
I think she had a tough time transitioning into becoming a mommy.
But

1079
01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.330
no,
I had no idea.

1080
01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:55.100
Here I'll use the Google machine.
Tamar Google machine.
Yeah.

1081
01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:00.450
Only there was a way to figure these things out.
Pay More.
Braxton.

1082
01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:02.390
We are the Braxton

1083
01:13:06.010 --> 01:13:07.340
family.
Tom,

1084
01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:21.490
<v 15>you,
Ooh,</v>

1085
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:24.810
<v 2>same are pregnant with number two.</v>

1086
01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:28.000
I think she is a cat.
It's hard to tell this.

1087
01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:31.460
Apparently she lashed out at somebody.
Let's see.
That's weird.

1088
01:13:31.461 --> 01:13:32.580
It's not like Tamar.
I know.

1089
01:13:32.581 --> 01:13:37.581
She lashed out at somebody who made fun of the way her son speaks.

1090
01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:42.720
Oh,
that's not cool.
Yeah.
Good for her.
I would do though.
She was saying that,
um,

1091
01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:47.760
somebody said he could use speech therapy.
Oh fuck them.

1092
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.650
Don't say shit about people's kids.

1093
01:13:52.330 --> 01:13:55.590
Crazy.
So,
um,

1094
01:13:56.070 --> 01:14:00.900
we watched a movie last night.
We seldom get through films at this house.

1095
01:14:01.050 --> 01:14:05.850
Yeah.
But we watched a movie chark by Shark Bites.

1096
01:14:06.210 --> 01:14:08.730
Yeah.
It wasn't really,

1097
01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:14.680
it wasn't really called the shark bites.
It was called the shallows,

1098
01:14:14.830 --> 01:14:19.390
shallow hallows.
Shallow Halos.
I remember when it was out because I was at,

1099
01:14:19.391 --> 01:14:22.900
um,
I was on the road.
Sometimes people don't know,

1100
01:14:22.901 --> 01:14:24.670
but all we do is kill time throughout the day.

1101
01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:27.460
You went to the nerdy bar and I went to the titty bar and it was like seeing

1102
01:14:27.461 --> 01:14:32.040
enough tits for the day.
Well,
for flight.
I've seen enough tits.
Preflight,

1103
01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:35.140
sorry,
what now?
No,
but I remember the,
um,

1104
01:14:35.410 --> 01:14:39.220
the kid at a theatre box office kid was like trying to sell me on it.

1105
01:14:39.221 --> 01:14:43.510
He was like,
no,
I saw it.
It's really good.
Um,
I'll say this.

1106
01:14:43.630 --> 01:14:46.690
It was entertaining.
I loved it.
I mean,
look,

1107
01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.730
I wouldn't say you loved it cause I sat next to you and he were very critical.

1108
01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:56.440
You're like,
wow,
you are so critical in that mood behavior.
Because I was like,

1109
01:14:56.740 --> 01:15:00.840
number one,
you don't surf alone.
Everyone knows that.
Number two.
It's critical.

1110
01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:05.110
You were like,
that was the premise of the film though,
man.
You were like,

1111
01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:09.610
you were like a Tamar or at the movies.
You're like,
oh girl,
no.

1112
01:15:09.670 --> 01:15:13.360
I was like Jesus.
And you're like,
oh yeah.
Like that would happen.
Oh yeah,

1113
01:15:13.361 --> 01:15:16.120
like that shark would do that.
That's what that was due last night.

1114
01:15:16.121 --> 01:15:21.070
You don't even realize it.
I look for truth,
Tom.
We were real truth seeker.

1115
01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:29.920
Blake Blake lively,
that's her name.

1116
01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:32.890
And she's just hideous troll.

1117
01:15:32.891 --> 01:15:35.350
Have a blonde girl and her tits were in the movie too.

1118
01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:41.050
We really gross body gross face.
I mean,
what a bummer though.

1119
01:15:41.051 --> 01:15:44.560
The whole movie,
she's on a rock with her leg cut open.

1120
01:15:44.710 --> 01:15:49.120
Could you imagine filming that fucking nightmare of a movie or wet and cold all

1121
01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:51.000
day.
Every day.
What a nightmare for,

1122
01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:54.460
but she did a great job and the shark bites the shark.

1123
01:15:54.461 --> 01:15:57.230
Took a bite out of her and then she had to figure out how do I escape shark

1124
01:15:57.231 --> 01:16:01.660
bites.
Yeah,
it was scary.
That's right.
It was,
um,
it was real scary.

1125
01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:06.700
And she was in Mexico too.
So she,
you know,
another country.

1126
01:16:06.701 --> 01:16:09.790
There's shark bites.
There.
It is.
Yeah.
There it is.
She got her,

1127
01:16:09.791 --> 01:16:13.240
I think she got her titties that there really was,

1128
01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:17.410
there was some gross shit.
Um,
some of the shots were like,

1129
01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:21.920
oh my fucking pretty gnarly.
Yeah.
Um,
but yeah,

1130
01:16:21.921 --> 01:16:26.880
her body's terrible.
You know,
her lips got real chapter cause she was in the sun,

1131
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:31.570
she stopped being attractive.
One of the few scenes was like,
well I'll turn off,

1132
01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:35.170
but then I feel like she found some chapstick in that buoy because then her lips

1133
01:16:35.171 --> 01:16:39.190
got smoothed out.
Smoothed out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The Shark was real hungry.

1134
01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:43.870
He never satisfied.
Never.
He hung out for like two days with her dude.
But it was,

1135
01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:48.370
it was a fun movie.
I mean,
for,
there's Times I've killed me,
you know,
time,

1136
01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:51.640
90 minutes,
two hours,
and you're like,
this fucking sucked.

1137
01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:55.420
And it wasn't like that.
It wasn't a great movie,
but it was entertaining.

1138
01:16:56.130 --> 01:16:58.240
Think there's only so much shit this is going to happen.
You know,

1139
01:16:58.241 --> 01:17:01.020
the shark gets her or it doesn't,
and a story,
you know?
Yeah.

1140
01:17:01.570 --> 01:17:06.100
And it's an entertaining film.
We found one flaw in the film.

1141
01:17:06.190 --> 01:17:10.070
Oh yeah.
And this bothers me because I've,
I pointed it out

1142
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:14.630
<v 0>to you in other films,
primarily the Matt Damon,
the Martian,</v>

1143
01:17:14.631 --> 01:17:19.250
the Martian movie where he's there for long time.
So he or she is,

1144
01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:23.300
um,
and the premise of the film,
I mean,
I think it's in the trailer.
Okay.

1145
01:17:23.301 --> 01:17:25.580
It's that she gets stuck at sea.

1146
01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:30.020
There's a shark looking for shark bites and anyways,

1147
01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:34.400
she's stuck on this rock first.
The whole day goes,

1148
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:39.200
she gets bitten you and that's the price.
Yeah.
The whole day fucking goes by.

1149
01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:44.930
She doesn't masturbate once.
Right.
Then Day two comes,

1150
01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:50.350
she's cold,
she's bored,
she's tired,
she's bleeding,

1151
01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:54.140
she's in pain.
It doesn't masturbate again.
That's so true.

1152
01:17:54.650 --> 01:17:57.230
And then you're like,
I'm basically

1153
01:17:59.030 --> 01:18:01.820
saying that the hole is too big in this film.

1154
01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:06.470
It's a major premise flaw,
major premise flow.

1155
01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:11.180
She doesn't have any pornography to look at.
And she's not like,
oh,

1156
01:18:11.181 --> 01:18:14.360
I want to make myself feel like if I was ever there,
I want to feel good.

1157
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:17.840
And I was basically about to dismiss this entire film.

1158
01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:21.200
And I don't mean to be a spoiler here,

1159
01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:27.170
but look at the end of the film when she gets on land,

1160
01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.200
she masturbates when she gets to land

1161
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:36.020
the big gang bang scene where the guy's like,
hey,

1162
01:18:36.150 --> 01:18:41.150
you had a week laid down but open your mouth and then my son and I are going to

1163
01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:46.970
make sex with you.
Right.
I thought right after that they were like,
and she goes,

1164
01:18:46.971 --> 01:18:51.530
I didn't get off and they're like,
I don't care.
And then she masturbated.
Oh,

1165
01:18:51.531 --> 01:18:53.030
I missed that because the Martian,

1166
01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:58.060
I tried to have Tom Papa ask because he's friends with Matt Damon about whether

1167
01:18:59.001 --> 01:19:02.120
or not that was a conversation he didn't get back to.
He didn't know.

1168
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:07.990
That did bother me about the Martian to lie to me about this one is it was two

1169
01:19:08.451 --> 01:19:10.370
full days and she didn't make a bowel movement.

1170
01:19:10.730 --> 01:19:14.480
Whereas the CEO doesn't shit off the rock.
Show me there's a masturbate.

1171
01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:18.290
Neither one really adds up.
Those are the holes I've seen.
The film,

1172
01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:22.910
the Martian is like,
you can't even defend that.
They're like,

1173
01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:26.800
they're either like texting him via satellites.

1174
01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:29.510
Like is there anything we can send you there?
Anything you want?

1175
01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:33.290
Like he wouldn't be like,
send me a picture of your tits are like,
I'm so hard.

1176
01:19:33.291 --> 01:19:35.060
I'm so backed up,
like never comes up.

1177
01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:40.160
And he was on the eye on the planet for a long time.
Really long time.

1178
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:43.490
And he figured out how to grow food but he couldn't figure out how to download

1179
01:19:43.491 --> 01:19:48.230
porn.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Doesn't make sense.
Right.
Big Flaw.

1180
01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:52.910
Like you wouldn't be like,
oh my God,
cause he figured out food.

1181
01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:56.780
So once he knows he's got food and he's got life,
he knows he's going to live,

1182
01:19:56.781 --> 01:19:59.460
you'd be like,
oh you're,
you're basic needs are covered.
Right.

1183
01:19:59.510 --> 01:20:02.240
You're basic needs are water,

1184
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:06.140
food and masturbation and like she's on that rock.
She's not going to like,

1185
01:20:06.141 --> 01:20:10.510
she knows like I'm on the Rock,
he's not going to get me.
I'm cold.
Yeah.

1186
01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:13.060
I wish I felt good.
What could make me feel good right now?
Right.

1187
01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:15.710
Oh can you just flick my been for a few minutes or water?

1188
01:20:16.170 --> 01:20:19.740
Probably masturbating before a water.
Yeah,
it was a priority.

1189
01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:21.330
Like if you were on that rock,

1190
01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:26.760
your priority list would probably be one masturbate too.

1191
01:20:27.930 --> 01:20:32.000
I'd probably,
you'd probably want to shave and zoom it three liters

1192
01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:34.130
<v 2>mass in your own mouth.
Is that what you're saying?
Yeah,</v>

1193
01:20:34.131 --> 01:20:39.110
because you'd be hungry too.
So you have protein.
Uh,
uh,

1194
01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:42.220
they should have showed that on the Martian.

1195
01:20:42.650 --> 01:20:45.390
They should have shown that on the marsh versions.
So gross then

1196
01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:50.960
what's the proper way she doesn't have a cup?
Yeah.
Wait a minute.

1197
01:20:50.961 --> 01:20:55.070
She wouldn't have a semen.
That's Matt Damon,
right?
That's what I'm talking about.

1198
01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:55.730
Yeah.

1199
01:20:55.730 --> 01:20:58.940
So he should have just come into his own mouth is what you're saying you should

1200
01:20:58.941 --> 01:21:02.420
have.
Yeah,
of course.
He should have come down a lot of,

1201
01:21:04.570 --> 01:21:09.310
um,
Eh,
um,

1202
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:13.070
I've really been sorry,
go ahead.
No,
I was just saying that I've been,

1203
01:21:13.071 --> 01:21:18.071
I'm really enjoying your photograph of you wearing your perfect smile.

1204
01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:22.760
Yeah.
If an area's,
a lot of people are,
this is a really fun,

1205
01:21:23.210 --> 01:21:26.630
but you look really good in them.
I don't know what the secret is,

1206
01:21:26.631 --> 01:21:30.410
but they really,
they really fit in your mouth.

1207
01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:34.460
I feel like the perfect smile doesn't entirely fit my mouth.

1208
01:21:34.461 --> 01:21:39.300
But for you it was like tailor made.
Yeah.
Why do you think the secret is he's it?

1209
01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.000
Cause your gum color matches

1210
01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:45.070
<v 0>the red of the perfect smile.
Um,</v>

1211
01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:48.370
I don't know why.
Um,
but I uh,

1212
01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:51.790
I feel like he look at that.
That does look perfect.

1213
01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:55.810
That perfect smile is perfect.
I feel like it's just mouth size.

1214
01:21:55.811 --> 01:21:59.280
It's just real nice for me.
You look so third world with yours.

1215
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:02.410
I just looked like a guy with a cool smile.

1216
01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:04.313
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1217
01:22:07.190 --> 01:22:08.023
<v 2>That's the thing.</v>

1218
01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:10.960
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1219
01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:15.790
<v 2>You actually do it looks okay
with your look that.</v>

1220
01:22:15.791 --> 01:22:18.190
Huh?
What a cadaver.
You know who you look like?

1221
01:22:18.430 --> 01:22:20.590
The old man and Poulter guys too would sing.

1222
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:25.950
God is in his holy Damn Paula or just any old person cause they always have fake

1223
01:22:26.111 --> 01:22:29.500
teeth.
Wait.
Okay.
Can I do it?

1224
01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:34.110
<v 0>Yeah.
Don't put it in your mouth that you always do that wrong.
No,
no.</v>

1225
01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:37.990
You just put it in your lips.
You always go too far in.
Yeah.

1226
01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:42.750
There you go.
Now it looks like it's your teeth.

1227
01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:46.940
<v 2>I can do that laughing when I look at you though.
So,</v>

1228
01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:50.240
so I can't have the perfect smile with even my life.
Um,
you

1229
01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:51.350
<v 0>know,
there was huge news.</v>

1230
01:22:51.351 --> 01:22:56.060
I probably got teed up by this for this like 100,000 times last week.
Heat up.

1231
01:22:56.090 --> 01:22:59.570
Yeah.
Like people reached out to me so much last week.

1232
01:23:00.650 --> 01:23:03.320
Oh my God.
I know too that

1233
01:23:05.050 --> 01:23:09.700
I've been living in Russia for like 50.
Steven Seagal is now a citizen of Russia.

1234
01:23:09.730 --> 01:23:11.140
Fucking defector.

1235
01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:16.200
Vladimir Putin himself named him a citizen and Seagal has been a really big

1236
01:23:18.491 --> 01:23:23.350
proponent of better relations with Russia.
Um,
for years now,

1237
01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:28.380
<v 16>the last time I asked the CIA to provide me with people and answers,</v>

1238
01:23:28.381 --> 01:23:33.381
they gave me people in answers that answered my questions the way they wanted it

1239
01:23:33.481 --> 01:23:36.840
to be answered,
meaning the CIA.
And the same with the State Department.

1240
01:23:37.170 --> 01:23:42.030
Dana knew that I knew the right people in Russia and he knew that I would get

1241
01:23:42.031 --> 01:23:43.800
them to tell him the truth.

1242
01:23:44.190 --> 01:23:49.190
And we all feel Dana and I feel that Russia and America have never fought each

1243
01:23:49.411 --> 01:23:50.244
other in a war.

1244
01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:55.290
We believe that Russia and America should be best friends.

1245
01:23:57.490 --> 01:24:02.470
<v 0>Yeah.
But he also believes that I,
yeah.
Anyways,
go enjoy it.</v>

1246
01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:06.780
Enjoy Russia.
Comrade,
comrade Seagal.

1247
01:24:07.290 --> 01:24:11.020
No official.
Go ahead.
If you love it,
so much fucking stay there.

1248
01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:13.000
Know I've been drinking.
Don't come back.

1249
01:24:13.001 --> 01:24:16.850
Do you a drink a vodka for that 63 years and uh,

1250
01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:22.520
I've been of an Eden Russian for rogies haven't even bro.

1251
01:24:23.301 --> 01:24:27.670
He's
74 years now.
Yeah.
Enjoy it.

1252
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:32.410
Enjoy your,
your,
your Russian.
A winter and a well,

1253
01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:37.240
speaking of the Bird Chrysler of action films,
um,

1254
01:24:37.870 --> 01:24:41.560
nothing.
I got a uh,
another treat for you.

1255
01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:43.000
A new,

1256
01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:47.673
<v 5>you gotta be kidding.</v>

1257
01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:53.400
<v 0>CIA trained.
This is the new Seagal trailer.
If you don't know,</v>

1258
01:24:53.790 --> 01:24:58.790
there is nothing better than of the 12 or so films that Seagal releases a year

1259
01:25:00.810 --> 01:25:04.680
that,
uh,
are in the eight to $12,000 budget range.

1260
01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:09.690
The trailers are even better if it can be imagined.
Then the film,

1261
01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:15.160
<v 5>it's a two minute trailer.
Wow.
That looks so real.</v>

1262
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:18.150
238 and to some people on board,

1263
01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:26.030
so I guess you're back
Islamic extremist.

1264
01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:28.370
These guys are attempting to form a of your life.

1265
01:25:28.630 --> 01:25:29.463
<v 0>Here's the deal.</v>

1266
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:34.830
I get to wear my orange shades and I get to show up at any way I choose.

1267
01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:39.790
Okay.
And my Kimono,
what is he wearing?
His Geek.

1268
01:25:39.970 --> 01:25:43.030
And you got to spend at least 10 grand on this movie.
All right?
All right.

1269
01:25:43.031 --> 01:25:43.790
All right.
All right.

1270
01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:47.730
<v 5>Cartels has got to be active as it.
Nobody knows nobody.</v>

1271
01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:51.340
There's someone to be reckoned with,
a covert mission.

1272
01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:55.430
<v 0>And my cousins got to do the narration on the trailer.</v>

1273
01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:56.930
<v 5>I want mine.</v>

1274
01:25:58.050 --> 01:25:59.730
<v 0>Never even seen a film like this.</v>

1275
01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:05.270
<v 5>An elite team.
You're most pick John Harmon might have a job propose</v>

1276
01:26:07.290 --> 01:26:11.870
we like,
can we give him a box of chocolate?
We don't really count

1277
01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:15.860
<v 2>whispering all of his lines in this film or you don't know.</v>

1278
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:22.400
<v 0>Steve has been doing for awhile now.
You didn't know that.</v>

1279
01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:25.490
<v 2>He's so lazy.
He's whispering.
Is that his dialogue now?</v>

1280
01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.530
<v 0>Yeah,
he's been,
um,
it's,</v>

1281
01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:31.350
it's sort of like the school he comes from,
you know,

1282
01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:35.760
uh,
acting the whisper school with preschool,

1283
01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:39.500
the squint school.
I mean,
there's things about it and lot of people don't.

1284
01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:42.760
<v 5>When I am the king of in province for,
for you.</v>

1285
01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:46.580
<v 0>I am.
I am.</v>

1286
01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:51.190
I mean I think people would go wow if will Ferrell said that.
Yeah.

1287
01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:55.940
But Steven said it.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1288
01:27:00.630 --> 01:27:03.330
<v 5>It's my job stopped
it</v>

1289
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:11.070
don't pay to six on my count.
Three,
two,

1290
01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:15.000
one game on a global threat.

1291
01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:18.480
There's a yellow card.
Now

1292
01:27:23.710 --> 01:27:25.870
the chill come into it.

1293
01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:28.940
<v 0>No,
it's,
you don't see a lot of body shots.
Right.</v>

1294
01:27:30.750 --> 01:27:32.970
<v 2>And it's dark like shoulders.
Yeah.</v>

1295
01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:38.190
Especially I'm saying the whole film is shot by candlelight cause he looks,

1296
01:27:38.250 --> 01:27:40.170
he gotta be two 85 to 99 lease.

1297
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:44.290
<v 5>Yeah.
No,
that's too much.</v>

1298
01:27:46.540 --> 01:27:48.050
I don't understand what the fuck is.

1299
01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:52.500
<v 0>Do you understand what's happening?
No.
I mean,
yes.
Uh,</v>

1300
01:27:53.370 --> 01:27:55.340
if there was your back and he goes,

1301
01:27:55.341 --> 01:27:59.800
I need my own team and my own gear and then there's just shit.

1302
01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:01.913
<v 5>Hello?</v>

1303
01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:05.780
<v 0>So they went with that new,
uh,
hey,</v>

1304
01:28:05.781 --> 01:28:08.060
this guy used to be where they will know and he's back

1305
01:28:09.090 --> 01:28:09.923
<v 5>switch to play.</v>

1306
01:28:11.790 --> 01:28:14.950
They don't think a decimeter USC seconds.
Okay.

1307
01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:18.310
<v 0>You think that director ever says,
could you emote something?
Can you,
could you,</v>

1308
01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:19.570
you know what's so funny?
I was,

1309
01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:24.390
he got to the face of this and he also does anything.
They basically,

1310
01:28:24.910 --> 01:28:27.090
he doesn't really say that I with me.
Right.

1311
01:28:27.710 --> 01:28:31.880
<v 2>Well what I was just thinking to myself is what does he bring to the table</v>

1312
01:28:31.881 --> 01:28:35.480
because he's not active anymore.
He's not kinky punching.

1313
01:28:35.710 --> 01:28:37.940
He's certainly is phoning in the acting.

1314
01:28:38.250 --> 01:28:41.070
<v 0>I think they know there's enough of a market,</v>

1315
01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:46.400
like he's a big enough name where someone like there's enough people out there

1316
01:28:46.561 --> 01:28:50.910
that are willing to pay something to see these films for dollars.
Not the um,

1317
01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:52.740
your,
your,
you know,

1318
01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:57.730
your movie goer of today or somebody who's like this.

1319
01:28:57.750 --> 01:29:02.040
Probably a lot of people here who are,
you know,
a few that like old action.
But

1320
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:06.100
<v 2>then in other countries where he's still a big deal,
right.
My,</v>

1321
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:11.060
my step Dad,
my Indian step dad liked his movie course.
My stepdad probably would,

1322
01:29:11.190 --> 01:29:14.460
would watch this.
Your Dad came to the country a few years later,

1323
01:29:14.490 --> 01:29:19.200
he would have made his name Steven.
Right?
It's true.
Yeah.
True.
True.

1324
01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:21.480
Cause they had the same hair.
They're the same.
They did.

1325
01:29:22.050 --> 01:29:26.430
That's how my Stepdad and new to dye his hair nice and easy black because this

1326
01:29:26.431 --> 01:29:29.340
is a real nice and easy,
just was such a nice and easy job.
Yeah.

1327
01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:40.813
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1328
01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:44.223
<v 1>Did you punch him?</v>

1329
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:45.730
<v 2>We just saw the budget right there.</v>

1330
01:29:45.731 --> 01:29:49.870
That was a whole budget say besides a little more budget than the,
um,
well,

1331
01:29:49.950 --> 01:29:54.540
I mean that has a little kicky punching,
but yeah,
a lot of editing.
Okay.

1332
01:29:54.970 --> 01:29:59.390
Well he's no longer American to me,
so this is a cute movie.

1333
01:29:59.391 --> 01:30:04.200
Accepted Russian citizenship.
It's so,
it's so gross.

1334
01:30:06.610 --> 01:30:07.443
<v 5>Um,</v>

1335
01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:12.860
<v 2>go live there.
Go live with it really is like his six film of the year,</v>

1336
01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:17.420
which is incredible.
Yeah.
He's like the Woody Allen of the action world.

1337
01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:21.230
Yeah.
Perfect smile.

1338
01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:26.300
Perfect smile.
Um,

1339
01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:27.590
yeah,
he's a

1340
01:30:28.670 --> 01:30:29.320
<v 5>okay.</v>

1341
01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:34.120
<v 2>He's really,
he's really a fucking,
not a cool guy.
But anyways,</v>

1342
01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:39.790
I'm just not a fan.
Um,
let me give you moved to North Korea.
I don't show

1343
01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:44.260
the commies.
Check this out.

1344
01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:49.630
<v 12>America is a PSA,
isn't it?
Kid?</v>

1345
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:53.930
Bundles of energy,
but they need the right snacks to keep them going.

1346
01:30:54.350 --> 01:30:57.400
That's why I give my kids pretty bad.

1347
01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:06.860
<v 1>Saw that one.</v>

1348
01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:10.700
<v 17>Venting trips around your home can be as easy as tidying up toys.</v>

1349
01:31:17.450 --> 01:31:21.140
<v 2>That was pretty good.
That was pretty funny.
That was horrifying</v>

1350
01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:26.840
part.
Yeah.
I don't like that bit.

1351
01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:30.393
<v 5>Okay,</v>

1352
01:31:32.590 --> 01:31:33.423
<v 2>nice.</v>

1353
01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:38.220
<v 1>I don't want to see it again.</v>

1354
01:31:42.150 --> 01:31:47.150
<v 17>Those horrible preventing trips around your home is easy as tidying up toys.</v>

1355
01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:48.920
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1356
01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:53.210
<v 2>This is a good one for us.
No Shit.
Our whole world is,
yeah,
toy city.</v>

1357
01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:56.210
Great.
Well thanks for sending that in.

1358
01:31:56.800 --> 01:32:00.020
A couple of big reminders before we leave you.

1360
01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:07.660
oh,
let's remind people.
Yeah.

1361
01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:12.900
Bert Kreischer the machine pro premiers November 11th at 10:00 PM on showtime on

1364
