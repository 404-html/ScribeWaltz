00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:05.290
Well.
Well,
well go to your mom's house,

2
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.423
Christina.

3
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.660
<v 1>Alright,
here we go.
I'm going over the new bridge,</v>

4
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.800
the three years.

5
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.713
<v 4>Oh,</v>

6
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.260
<v 1>there we go.</v>

7
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.430
<v 4>We
go.</v>

8
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.310
<v 1>Oh,
oh,
oh,</v>

9
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.820
oh my God.

10
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.073
Oh my God.

11
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.350
We're going to be like 20 like 20 Oh

12
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.540
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

13
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.330
<v 0>you split up.
That was so funny.
I can't believe it.</v>

14
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.020
I spit my water out.
I don't want to turn the wrong earphones or you know,

15
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.760
live it at me,
dude.
There's,
there's snow up.
I can't hear my song.

16
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.860
You can hear yourself.
No.
And Mike,
is my mic on?
Yeah,
it's on no gene.

17
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.480
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello,
hello.
Oh,
there it is.
Okay.
Twist in the wrong line.

18
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.080
You want to know something yesterday what?
I had top dog and Charo in here.

19
00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:38.010
We'll get to that obviously a little bit later.
Yeah,

20
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.060
30 minutes into talking to them.

21
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.290
I play something for them to watch and my dad goes,
I can't hear it.

22
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.020
And I go,
you can't hear it.
And he goes,
no.
I go,
well,
can you hear me right now?

23
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:54.090
And he goes,
no,
he never played them in.

24
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.580
Now they were just sat with headphones on.
I'm unplugged.

25
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.640
Not even like didn't it to you that there was no sound coming through?
No.

26
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.610
It's so funny because they're so accustomed to whatever is happening.

27
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.330
Like they just,
you know,
it's kind of like how busy is they give you,

28
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:12.550
put like a towel on her head.
She just lets it stay there.

29
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.810
I wanna I wanna give credit for that song.
Oh my God.
River by Matt Mercer.

30
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.480
That was so funny.
The way he spit out.

31
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.730
I took a sip of water and then I had to spit it back into the Fiji bottle.

32
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.700
That was so funny.
That was great.
The,

33
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.920
the composition of the Dad Boehner was outstanding.

34
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.800
His enthusiasm is just ridiculous.
Yeah.

35
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.020
Look at the river.
Decided about driving on a fucking bridge.

36
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.570
Somebody sent in an anti dad.
Boehner supposed to play that little,
oh goodness.

37
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.590
There's a lot to talk about.
I mean,
we had my parents here for five days.

38
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.420
It was a world wind,
a situation,
a whirlwind weekend.

39
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.860
Not a whirlwind.
It's a world when there was a blessing in disguise.
Wow.

40
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.290
It was a,
it was artistic.
It was,

41
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.170
it was voluptuous.
Um,
yeah.

42
00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:08.650
Listen over listening to say welcome to all our new listeners.

43
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:12.250
Welcome to your mom's house.
And um,

44
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.300
there's a lot to go over today.
Oh my God.

45
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.910
Last few weeks have been big weeks on this show because we had Martin Resa,
uh,

46
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.060
the water sound.
Yay.
Is it Vasa?
Somewhere year,

47
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.020
that episode got a lot of traction.
A lot of people,
uh,
really interested in,

48
00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:30.460
in Ah,
and what he had to say.
I haven't touched our tap water since,

49
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:34.570
I mean urban or whatever.
Buying water differently since that,

50
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.020
since that day I've been buying Fiji water for us.
I know,

51
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:41.230
but also even when in restaurants I'll say,
what type of water?
And the guy,

52
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.980
even yesterday he goes,
we have triple purified,
blah,
blah,
blah.

53
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.560
Or we have this spring water.
I go,
bring me the spring water.
Yeah.

54
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:48.990
I have been ordering it too.

55
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.770
There was a life changing experience and then a Mr Joe Rogan came last week and

56
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.400
that was a fun time.
That was,
that was a really fun,
yeah,

57
00:04:57.401 --> 00:05:01.180
we got him to drink the Hungarian water.
Yeah.
He liked it.
I'm pretty,

58
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:05.830
pretty good stuff.
That was super fun.
Um,
okay.
Well,
uh,
why don't we,
uh,

59
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.670
why don't we start the show and uh,
we'll go from there.
Yeah.
Okay.
Jane,
let's,

60
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.030
let's,
let's do our opening clip and get good.
Yes.
It's Monday.

61
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.940
Look at the river.

62
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.770
<v 6>Sophie Tanner just celebrated her second wedding anniversary two years ago.</v>

63
00:05:22.771 --> 00:05:27.090
Her poor dad walked her down the aisle in public and gave his daughter away to

64
00:05:27.091 --> 00:05:32.040
herself in what's called Scilog me Sophie Tanner married herself.

65
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.940
<v 0>Oh,
is Randy.
Don't bring it in one.
Loving to live.</v>

66
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.190
<v 2>Well,
co Co go to your mom's house with tone.</v>

67
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.000
Civil war.
Christina.

68
00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:58.443
Yeah.

69
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.933
<v 7>There you go.</v>

70
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.370
A whole new world just opened up marrying yourself.

71
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.910
Why are more women choosing to marry themselves?
Boy.
Bad personalities.

72
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.980
Yeah.
I'm thinking,
I'm thinking there.
I could think of a few reasons.
Sad,

73
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.360
lonely.

74
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.520
Because you need to look in the mirror and change things in inside and out.

75
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.670
What do you mean?
Why are they choosing the Marriott?

76
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.910
If someone's not chosen to marry you,
then you know,
here's the thing,

77
00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:02.690
I just got a problem with you.
You just say single,
right?
If you're like,
Hey,

78
00:07:02.691 --> 00:07:04.730
I'm not in a marriage,
which is totally valid.

79
00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:09.200
They want to celebrate being single.
Oh,
like I'm,
you know what that's like,
um,

80
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.440
that's like a,
that's like the girls who are like,

81
00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:16.070
I'm happy being saying I'm proud man.
Like,
no,
you're not.
And if you're happy,

82
00:07:16.071 --> 00:07:20.840
you just,
you just start are,
you don't have to tell people,
right?
Yeah,
no,
yeah.

83
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.750
They want it to be there saying like,
these societal norms are unfair and,

84
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.790
or just,
you know,
not recognizing that that's something to celebrate.

85
00:07:28.791 --> 00:07:31.250
In other words,
they celebrate you being with somebody else,

86
00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:34.160
but what about celebrating me not being with somebody else?

87
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.390
<v 6>She said everyone celebrates getting together with someone and becoming married,</v>

88
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:43.010
but there's no milestone in society that celebrates escaping something awful or

89
00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:45.450
returning to your own happiness.
Oh,
10 minutes.

90
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.790
<v 7>Ouch.
Yeah.
Escaping something awful.
That,</v>

91
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.680
is that what she thinks marriage is like,

92
00:07:50.681 --> 00:07:54.760
I wonder what the movie she escaped a bad relationship
then.

93
00:07:54.761 --> 00:07:57.780
That's a different story.
That should be a different party altogether.

94
00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.570
Don't want a wedding.
Salami.

95
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:05.210
<v 6>Erica Anderson,
who of course lives in Brooklyn also bury herself.</v>

96
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.840
I think it's hard not to adopt whatever societies messages are.

97
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.800
And I certainly think that one of the messages is you are not enough if you are

98
00:08:12.801 --> 00:08:14.320
not with someone else.
Okay.

99
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.440
<v 7>Yeah.
Or You could just ignore societal messages and not have to something.</v>

100
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:25.150
She seemed cute enough.
Right?
I'm sure she's fine.
Yeah.

101
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.780
It just must be.
Why don't you talk to her?
You're like,
Oh God,
she's a nightmare.

102
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.420
She fucking marry yourself.
And then she goes,
I will.
Yeah.

103
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:37.750
I don't know man.
I Dunno about you acting like this is a good thing.

104
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.170
I don't know.
I think that,
again,
I don't care.
They don't give a shit.

105
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.310
The thing is,
I think they want the,
um,

106
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.480
the celebration of a wedding and they want to wear the dress and stuff.

107
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.270
I totally get that.
In which case,

108
00:08:49.271 --> 00:08:52.450
isn't that kind of like a Quinceanera or like a coming out party?

109
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.970
We call it something else.
Like marrying yourself.
It's kind of sad.
Right?

110
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.950
So would you rather marry yourself or you ever date your mom?

111
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.630
Oh my God.
I had married myself.

112
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.450
I'd stay alone and sad my whole life.
My mom.
It's just like the gays.

113
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:14.430
What would you do?
Uh,
of course I would marry myself over dating my mom.

114
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.130
Of course.
That's so crazy.
I don't know.

115
00:09:19.131 --> 00:09:23.400
I mean I feel like I've made fun of so many of these people and then you get to

116
00:09:23.401 --> 00:09:26.340
know why and then you're always like,
oh okay,

117
00:09:26.341 --> 00:09:29.850
well she was abused or whatever,
but just don't do this.

118
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.910
That's what I would say too.
I think this is probably a nice lady.

119
00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:34.980
Have you talked to her?
You'd be like,
I understand,

120
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:36.790
but also could you just not do this?

121
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.570
Do you have to divorce yourself?
Like does she have to make this league right?

122
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:47.040
Cause this isn't legal to begin with.
Right?
Recognize you can't walk in and go,

123
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:51.210
are you single or married guy?
I'm married,
I'm married to me dance.
It's stupid.

124
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.130
But you know what someone will say to you,
stop fucking around.

125
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.550
Stop being mentally ill.
Stop being crazy and crazy.
Like in France,

126
00:09:56.551 --> 00:09:58.380
they let you marry dead people.

127
00:09:59.060 --> 00:09:59.660
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

128
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.860
<v 7>Which is like not,
it's also still no point.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

129
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:06.860
Of My dad's lonely in a relationship that's not functioning.

130
00:10:06.861 --> 00:10:08.360
Measure just being on your own.

131
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.900
And a lot of people don't realize that you can waste your life waiting for the

132
00:10:11.901 --> 00:10:16.580
one when you are the one yourself.
Oh boy.
Yeah.
I mean,

133
00:10:16.581 --> 00:10:19.940
these are just these people.
They need to find therapists.

134
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:24.820
You need to find your therapist.
You're not fooling anyone.
First of all.
You know,

135
00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:30.050
I'm,
I'm too strong.
I'm strong woman.
That's why.
That's why men can't handle me.

136
00:10:30.051 --> 00:10:33.470
I'm a strong woman now.
You're just,
you're annoying.
Nobody likes you.

137
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.910
There's always a thing.
I do feel like it comes from women almost exclusively.

138
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.800
You know,
not to be unfair.
Um,

139
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.420
the can't handle me mentality guys.

140
00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:47.420
I never hear guys say she couldn't handle me bro.

141
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:51.050
Like you guys never say that to women.
A lot of women who are crazy,

142
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.400
we'll say stuff like,

143
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:57.560
he just can't handle my success or like my personality or I'm too successful.

144
00:10:57.561 --> 00:10:59.690
I'm too big.
I was like,
no,
that's not why.

145
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:03.730
I have too much this like he's successful if you know,
I think he needs a girl.

146
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:08.420
I'm a woman.
That's all code for you need,
you need help.

147
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:09.763
I remember I went out

148
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:14.930
<v 0>girl a couple of times in college and then I blew her off and then months later,</v>

149
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:23.100
you know,
I ran into her and she had this really snappy like she was,

150
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.920
she acted like everything was cool.
And then she was like,
uh,

151
00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:27.690
have you found a girl?
Uh,

152
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:32.250
cause I know you like girls like that at the young girls and not women.

153
00:11:32.251 --> 00:11:36.540
And I just wanted to be like,
look,
you're built like a fucking line backer.

154
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.760
Like that's,
that's why we didn't go out again.
Yeah.

155
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.260
I just wasn't attracted to it.
It was a physical.
Yeah.

156
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:43.711
<v 7>So he,</v>

157
00:11:43.711 --> 00:11:46.640
so he thought maybe it could work and then you got to look at her and you were

158
00:11:46.641 --> 00:11:47.474
like,
Nah,

159
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:52.230
<v 0>I just know I went out,
we had dinner and we had drinks.
Right.
And you go like,</v>

160
00:11:52.231 --> 00:11:54.070
this is a person and everything,

161
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.530
<v 7>but I'm not attracted to you what he's supposed to do.
You can't force,</v>

162
00:11:56.531 --> 00:11:57.550
you can't force me to track.

163
00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:00.760
That's a part of that sucks about dating is that you can't just tell somebody

164
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.130
the truth like,
hey dude,
you know what?
I'm just not feeling.
There's no key.
Yeah.

165
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.270
Yeah.
I am like,

166
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:09.910
I could have conversations with her because she was really intelligent.

167
00:12:09.911 --> 00:12:14.470
It was fun to talk to her.
I enjoyed it,
but like I'm not into you in that way.

168
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.700
What was their tits situation?
It was like a small medium situation.

169
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:22.930
So they weren't hungry.
They weren't more hungry.
No fall.
They were enough.
Yeah,

170
00:12:22.931 --> 00:12:25.150
but like I just,
you know what?
I'm fat and sloppy.

171
00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:31.600
See Bay slops like milk drops,
big g cups.

172
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.770
I want to hang out.
I want to put a a bucket under those tits.

173
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:40.990
I'm just dripping all night stupid.
I've had that too.
Like,

174
00:12:40.991 --> 00:12:45.160
um,
when I was dating people back before Friendster was around you and I started

175
00:12:45.161 --> 00:12:48.610
dating and I always found it hard to tell somebody that like,

176
00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:50.830
you know what bro is just not like,
I can't say that.

177
00:12:50.831 --> 00:12:53.890
I don't feel it's a horrible conversation to have.
I can't have that.

178
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.070
Well because they'll always interpreted it as like,
I'm not enough,

179
00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.800
which of course it's a normal reaction and be like,

180
00:12:59.801 --> 00:13:02.200
am I not enough and we're not cool enough for this person?

181
00:13:02.201 --> 00:13:05.080
I might not attractive and my to this to that.
And you're like,
no dude,

182
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:06.460
they could be a fucking loser.

183
00:13:06.461 --> 00:13:09.420
And they just did you a huge favor by resource course,

184
00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:14.860
but marrying yourself.
Isn't that like a public declaration of sadness?

185
00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:19.810
Like here's the saddest person?
No,
this is another level.
This is another level.

186
00:13:19.811 --> 00:13:24.460
And also this lease sort of a dead ringer for you to fuck.
I'm serious.

187
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:25.780
I hate you.
I'm serious.

188
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:30.430
<v 8>I love her outfit though.</v>

189
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:35.460
[inaudible]

190
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.400
<v 7>you hear what she said?
She's marrying a train.
A train depot,
a train depot.</v>

191
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:41.720
The train station essentially.

192
00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:46.020
But I noticed that her gear is a lot like what you would wear her.

193
00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:51.350
She has,
I love her.
Fanny looks like a onesy.
Hell Yeah Dude.

194
00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.600
She has a similar cans,
right?
Yep.

195
00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.870
Do you think that she's wearing a good bra or no?
Check,
check,
check,
check.
No,
no.

196
00:13:56.871 --> 00:13:59.180
She needs to come with me to Nordstrom and get fed and get fitted.

197
00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:02.540
But I like her style.
I like where she's going in life.
Yeah.

198
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:07.350
I almost have more respect for her marrying the train station.
Yeah.

199
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.730
Just because it's something outside of yourself.
It's a little,

200
00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:15.920
it's very narcissistic and solipsistic to be like,
I love me,
me,
me,
me.

201
00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:18.470
Then your urine.
If you're,
if you're all about you your whole life,

202
00:14:18.471 --> 00:14:19.340
you're going to be miserable.

203
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.130
At least she's into the train station mean for our listeners.

204
00:14:22.131 --> 00:14:25.880
Could you describe her?
Emphasize saying you with dark hair.

205
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.950
Can you,
can you,
yeah,
totally.
Me as she's mean,

206
00:14:30.951 --> 00:14:33.410
she's my twin Brunette.
She's okay.

207
00:14:33.411 --> 00:14:37.990
She's a little bit of what you would call dumpy.
That's a dumpy look.
Uh,

208
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:42.680
like it's like a mechanics outfit,
but pink,
she's not wearing a bra at all,

209
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:47.150
so they're really low and hanging and then she's got like an awesome fanny pack

210
00:14:47.151 --> 00:14:51.140
is black just kind of,
she looks like droopy dog a little bit.

211
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.730
Yeah.
But whatever did.
She's happy cliff's tits man

212
00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.560
<v 8>as the Santa Fe train,</v>

213
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.400
and I know her.

214
00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.290
She's lesbian partner.

215
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.010
Debra Santa Fe

216
00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:14.260
<v 7>daydream gave her name but she has to share her wife with all these people.</v>

217
00:15:14.261 --> 00:15:17.590
Does that upset her?
It doesn't seem like she was that upset.
Look,

218
00:15:17.591 --> 00:15:19.120
this thing has a water bottle in it.

219
00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:23.890
I know that they should be like up around this area.
Right.

220
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:28.930
So I could just hire and that's all that is is a lack of a bra the right size.

221
00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.670
I mean she has something on it.
I see it here.
It could be,
no,

222
00:15:33.671 --> 00:15:35.680
I think it might be the wire.
Oh right.

223
00:15:35.681 --> 00:15:39.280
That they had a lot on just sitting right now.
Wow.

224
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.370
I mean wouldn't that be better for her back to where a good one.

225
00:15:42.371 --> 00:15:43.450
Better for everybody.

226
00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.630
It's actually better for all of society if she does cause we don't want to look

227
00:15:46.631 --> 00:15:50.120
at it.
It's like that woman we saw at the restaurant.
Yeah.

228
00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.290
There is a lady that walked into the restaurant we were dining at who had

229
00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:57.210
hangers just like they were lower though.
They were down here near the waist.

230
00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:01.150
She has all buttons,
the whole,
it's all bad.

231
00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.450
And that lady was wearing like a like or top and the restaurant.

232
00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.140
So the fabric is very unforgiving.
It shows your flaws.

233
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.130
The tits had picked up momentum.
Like you know when they hit each other,

234
00:16:12.131 --> 00:16:16.090
they go in circles and they hit each other and then she sat down and then we all

235
00:16:16.091 --> 00:16:19.540
took turns getting up to go to the bathroom.
But they were under the table

236
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.060
under the table.

237
00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:27.240
Imagine that you're at a table and some ladies tits are sitting underneath the

238
00:16:28.421 --> 00:16:31.600
table.
That's where they were.
And can I tell you as somebody who,

239
00:16:31.601 --> 00:16:35.440
when I take my bra off,
this is what my tits look like now more or less.

240
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.800
But I wear bras dude,
cause I don't want to present myself like this.

241
00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.840
Like a crazy person.

242
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:42.630
<v 8>Oh boy.</v>

243
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:47.630
[inaudible]

244
00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:00.590
<v 7>I really could see you wearing that.</v>

245
00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.910
I feel like you've worn versions of that.
Probably.

246
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.760
I actually pointed out an output to your mother yesterday.

247
00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:12.650
Identical to that at Nordstrom.
I did.
Um,
you think she's mentally ill?

248
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:17.240
Severely,
but at least,
again,
this is an externalization of,

249
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.520
of one's stuff,
you know what I mean?

250
00:17:19.521 --> 00:17:24.130
Like at least give your love to something or someone a building,
an external.

251
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:29.660
<v 8>She's kissing,
touching the walls.</v>

252
00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:31.910
I like how

253
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.020
<v 7>might and will you pick up the audio?
Only from the camera.</v>

254
00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:40.400
Really good job guys.

255
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:45.640
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

256
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:50.240
<v 7>oh,</v>

257
00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.310
<v 0>oh,
so her in the building watch buildings.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She's not doing so well.</v>

258
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:59.700
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

259
00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:06.593
<v 0>no good luck.</v>

260
00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:14.080
There should be mutual respect for it I guess so I guess that poses the ultimate

261
00:18:14.831 --> 00:18:19.000
question.
Mary herself.
Mary a building near your mom.

262
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.970
I fuck.
I'd have to choose that.

263
00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:29.080
Fuck God.
Last time I choose a building really.

264
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:33.130
Cause he can be like we at least you're technically married to something.

265
00:18:33.131 --> 00:18:36.250
If it's a really beautiful,
there are beautiful buildings and then,

266
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:38.530
and the environment's fun to go to.

267
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:40.790
I would say married to a building for a little while,

268
00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.000
like the empire state building.
Super Cool.
Yeah.

269
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:47.320
That's a good building where they let you marry it.
Who Cares?
So many suitors.

270
00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.700
Notredame oh yeah,
that'd be cool.

271
00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:57.610
I remember asking where the notes Notredame was to a local policemen.
Yeah.

272
00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:01.070
I got off the subway and I was like,
I learned that.
I think it was like,
Ooh,

273
00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:04.740
the North Sudan Asca.
I went to

274
00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:11.050
what she boss.
I said,
and I was like,
oh,

275
00:19:11.051 --> 00:19:14.980
you just nod at the whole time and at the end he was like,
man,
there you go.

276
00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:20.030
Thank you sir.
Go and ask.
MERCI.
MERCI.
Buckets.
Merisee buckets,
man.
Uh,

277
00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:24.870
what would you do you burn building or would you marry yourself?
Nah,

278
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.410
I'd marry building for a while.
Like I said,

279
00:19:26.411 --> 00:19:30.580
if it was a really nice building and I liked the area cause I can go to the same

280
00:19:30.581 --> 00:19:35.170
place for a while.
What if we just married this house?
That'd be way easy.
Yeah.

281
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.430
Yeah.
Dude.
You don't have to go anywhere.
Hang out with your spouse all the time.

282
00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.410
What about this level?

283
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:46.120
<v 9>21 year old soccer Bruno have a Sako,</v>

284
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:49.650
works in a supermarket and sings in a j pop band.

285
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.420
His girlfriend's name is Manaca,

286
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:56.640
she's 16 there are love plus couple here.

287
00:19:56.641 --> 00:20:00.960
Saku slips into the role of a schoolboy and meets the virtual Manaca while

288
00:20:00.961 --> 00:20:01.980
playing the game.

289
00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:07.930
<v 0>So it's a simulation dating like that movie.</v>

290
00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.130
Right?
Or I've seen that.
Yeah,
it was good movie.
It was given to me.

291
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.130
Is that hawking,
I forget everything.

292
00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.230
<v 9>I just signed it to check out the tennis team.</v>

293
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:27.380
Manaca she was tending the grounds and we had a chat how our relationship

294
00:20:27.491 --> 00:20:30.490
started.
Since then we've become closer and closer.

295
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:33.160
<v 0>Well what's your fucking pro down is,</v>

296
00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:38.240
it doesn't seem to be the one I thought it was.
What Pronoun is is they,

297
00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:42.470
they uh,
you know teeth.
What's Your Pronoun?

298
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:48.010
They got teeth pronoun like and those two pieces
really,

299
00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:50.160
<v 7>really kind of toeing that line.
Okay.</v>

300
00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:54.150
<v 9>Pronouns.
Soco Bruno spends about three hours a day,
which is virtually,</v>

301
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:59.820
she's always with him because a lot plus runs on a Nintendo ds,

302
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:04.120
a mobile emulator,
soccer.
We once had a real girlfriend too,

303
00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:08.130
but not for long.
Now he's devoted to Monaca alone.
Yep.

304
00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.410
<v 7>Voted.
I love when they say shit like that,</v>

305
00:21:10.411 --> 00:21:14.490
like someone was devoted to their car that they are having sex with or video

306
00:21:14.491 --> 00:21:18.390
games.
He is though.
I know that's it.
But the problem with that,
is this healthy?

307
00:21:18.391 --> 00:21:19.680
No,
it's not because it's,

308
00:21:19.681 --> 00:21:24.200
it's just going to further his isolation as he come on it.
I'm sure he,
yeah,

309
00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:27.830
loads.
He makes her do stuff.
Do you think so?
All the time,
just,

310
00:21:27.831 --> 00:21:31.620
just as on the screen?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That thing's covered.
You think so coated,

311
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:36.330
you gotta do it somewhere.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's disgusting.
That's the real question.

312
00:21:36.331 --> 00:21:41.100
Where are you getting that nut?
I mean,
I can get it on a building,
but right.

313
00:21:41.101 --> 00:21:42.870
Cover your keys.
You could get a real problem.

314
00:21:42.871 --> 00:21:46.150
It can seep into all those little nuances,
you know?
Well,

315
00:21:46.151 --> 00:21:49.920
one would wonder about people's i-phones is now everyone's watching their porn

316
00:21:49.921 --> 00:21:52.770
anyways.
Oh yeah.
But do people which is on their IFE.
I mean,

317
00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:55.920
some people I'm sure is on your hand and then you touch your eye.
Fallen.

318
00:21:55.921 --> 00:21:58.720
Now there's just on your iPhone.
Oh,
come on.
Yeah.

319
00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.770
It's on your hand that you don't know.

320
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:06.930
Where does it go when your stomach or on your shirts or something?
Hello?

321
00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.330
Sure.
Yeah.
I'll lay out your clothes and just on that

322
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.850
when you're going,
oh,
I don't care.
It's not mine.

323
00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:21.990
Oh,
glass all over it.
Oh yeah,

324
00:22:21.991 --> 00:22:26.580
it feels good,
man.
This is sad,
but man,
yeah,

325
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.481
I mean it bums me out,

326
00:22:27.481 --> 00:22:30.840
but then I know how lonely some people are and this is like their only outlet.

327
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.320
I know.
No.
Then you're like,
oh fuck.

328
00:22:34.321 --> 00:22:36.760
Just meet a person.
Yeah.

329
00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:41.580
Can you swipe right on someone on Tinder or something?
I don't fucking know.

330
00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.610
You should.
I have come all over my face,

331
00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:50.050
<v 10>barely the other earlier games separated reality and virtuality,</v>

332
00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:54.640
but when you play love plus real life and the game meld with one another,

333
00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.790
it hasn't been anything like that in the gaming world before.
Yeah.

334
00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:01.940
<v 7>Yeah.
I Dunno man.
I mean,</v>

335
00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:05.390
it seems like it really is for the loneliest of the day.

336
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.370
It's like those sex robots,
like they're,

337
00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:11.430
they're constantly trying to make a woman that's a robot so you can fuck it and

338
00:23:11.431 --> 00:23:15.200
not have to talk or a problem.
Is that just,
it helps you continue to be lonely.

339
00:23:15.201 --> 00:23:19.250
That's a problem.
Yeah.
You have to get out of your comfort zone to meet people.

340
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:23.930
Yeah.
And that's,
that's tough.
Hey,
hey,
what's going on?
He's rolling and cut.

341
00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:29.510
Yeah.
I mean,
it's like a,
you just get your super,
your super lonely.

342
00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:34.270
You're dating,
you're fucking Nintendo.
Yeah.
And then you're,
you're planning,
um,

343
00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:38.240
you know,
fucking trenchcoat hit on somebody.
That's a problem.
Yeah.

344
00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:42.830
Is it at further isolates?
Look,
human beings are meant to be social creatures.

345
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:46.070
Yeah.
You can't stay in isolation and we can't foster

346
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.930
<v 0>it.
Yeah.
Don't,
don't marry yourself.</v>

347
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:50.810
Don't marry your fucking Nintendo and don't marry buildings.
Go,

348
00:23:50.811 --> 00:23:54.130
go find some other freaks.
It's like you and that's it.
And find him.

349
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.400
<v 1>That's right.
Times.
Real emotional relationships can only develop,</v>

350
00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.570
at least in particular for us to box.
He's kissing it now.

351
00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.380
Trust is the most important thing in a relationship.

352
00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:05.720
I think braces are as a partner.
I can trust.

353
00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:07.830
She never cheated on me when they get in there.

354
00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:10.130
That's why I prefer her to a real girlfriend.

355
00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:12.340
<v 0>Yeah.
Well you go,</v>

356
00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:17.650
I love how people get hurt one time by that one issue and now it's forever.

357
00:24:17.651 --> 00:24:20.230
That thing,
like,
everyone's going to cheat on me.
I can't,

358
00:24:20.231 --> 00:24:24.380
I can't ever trust again.
Like,
dude,
no,
there's other girls weren't yours.

359
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:29.110
I trust it.
I trust my building was my building,

360
00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.260
but even though the people are walking in and out of her every day,

361
00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:37.150
I know there's other pigs on her.
I feel like she would never break my heart.

362
00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:44.020
Well,
that was a nasty.
Um,
how's your butthole today?
That's pretty good.
Yeah.

363
00:24:44.021 --> 00:24:48.820
I had a really rough week.
You back on back on normal Dr. Brown.

364
00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.060
That was really bad.
He said,
you're going to name your next album.

365
00:24:52.061 --> 00:24:55.030
No more diarrhea.
Yeah,
no more diarrhea.

366
00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.870
Like Mary j Blige is no more drama.
I had really bad diarrhea.

367
00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:02.140
I had an upper respiratory infection and I got an antibiotic.

368
00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:06.700
I had never had this happen where I had the worse side effects of this

369
00:25:06.701 --> 00:25:10.950
antibiotic,
which were,
which was intense diarrhea.
Yeah,
pretty bad.

370
00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.580
It took me down for a couple days,
so just terrible.
Yeah.

371
00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:19.960
Um,
all right.
A couple of emails we should get into.

372
00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:25.740
Looks at Sci High Hitler's right after finishing up episode three 96 I knew I

373
00:25:25.931 --> 00:25:29.620
had to email you with my observations that may give some more insight onto the

374
00:25:29.621 --> 00:25:33.730
big mystery.
Who is the real water champ,
even though it really isn't a mystery.

375
00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.020
The Tom is the champ.

376
00:25:35.021 --> 00:25:39.340
But seeing it just on a mere listen from your conversation with Martin,

377
00:25:39.341 --> 00:25:41.320
the Toms knowledge about the contents,

378
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:44.710
what was in each type of water was vastly superior to mommy.

379
00:25:44.711 --> 00:25:48.940
Tina's okay at times as though as if Tom actually knew what was in the water

380
00:25:48.941 --> 00:25:52.900
before Martin even said anything about the water,
even where it was from.

381
00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:56.440
This may stem from Tom Superiority with accents.
When Mommy,

382
00:25:56.441 --> 00:25:58.030
Tina Yorkie sipped her water,

383
00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:02.380
she was clearly dumbfounded and what she was even tasting when she would have

384
00:26:02.381 --> 00:26:03.610
thoughts about what she tasted,

385
00:26:03.611 --> 00:26:07.650
it reminded me only of Helen Keller's excited cries of what,
uh,

386
00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:09.640
when she discovered how to speak.

387
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:14.110
I hope I was of some help to add on the mountain of evidence for pro Tom.

388
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:19.330
So water champ.
Thanks and see you in breast balls.
Beach.
Michael.
Well,

389
00:26:19.331 --> 00:26:19.691
Michael,

390
00:26:19.691 --> 00:26:23.560
I hope to see you in west balls beach so I can hit you and your dumb face

391
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:27.880
because that's stupid.
How to spot a psychopath or damn.
Oh,

392
00:26:27.881 --> 00:26:31.570
I like this one.
Hi Mommy.
I'm living.
I'm an American living in Singapore.

393
00:26:31.571 --> 00:26:35.530
I'm sure I spotted a complete psychopath on the public bus yesterday.

394
00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.740
It was high and tight,
cisgendered businessman in a suit,

395
00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:43.990
but something was his terribly wrong.
I noticed he was wearing his watch over the

396
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:48.300
<v 7>sleeve of his shirt.
How?
Boy,
what an obviously psychotic fashion choice.</v>

397
00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:53.500
Any reason I can think of to wear your watch over your sleeve is the detonate,

398
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:57.000
some type of remote bomb.
I would rather wear orthopedic shoes.

399
00:26:57.001 --> 00:27:01.960
His ear muffs weigh in on this.
Thanks Jean.
Jake.
Jake,
you're completely right.

400
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:06.720
I've seen it a couple times.
He was a crazy look.
It is really bizarre.

401
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:10.750
They did it in third grade and then I realized how lame.
Yeah,
and you're like,

402
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:13.680
I can't wear my swatch over my sleep.
I also,
by the way,

403
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:16.170
I've seen it more so I know some people,
more people do it.

404
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:20.100
I think it's bananas when people wear their watch on the inside of the wrist.

405
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:25.080
That's terrible.
You know inside that goofier than Shit.

406
00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.590
It doesn't look like a bracelet,
bro.
Like everyone knows it's a watch.

407
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:32.400
You're watching the outside like a watch.
Yeah.
You fucking asshole.

408
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:34.060
Everyone hates you now to now,

409
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:38.520
I resent people that wear their watch on the right.
Oh,
you supposed to be alive,

410
00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:43.170
dude.
Always on the left.
Well,
why is it on the left?
I Dunno because I think they,

411
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.760
the whole thing was that more people are,

412
00:27:44.761 --> 00:27:47.640
I think they said that right handed people put on their left and more people are

413
00:27:47.641 --> 00:27:49.230
right handed.
Maybe that's it,

414
00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:52.050
but then why wouldn't you put it on your dominant hand so that you're always

415
00:27:52.051 --> 00:27:53.040
looking at that hand?

416
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:58.070
Because then the dominant hand is free to do what you need to do with the

417
00:27:58.361 --> 00:28:03.180
hindrance of the watch.
Got It.
But that that is a psychopathic over look.

418
00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:04.043
That's crazy.

419
00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:07.230
What I feel is another psychopathic look and I know I'm going to get some

420
00:28:07.231 --> 00:28:10.860
pushback on that.
Very,
very racy,
but the sandals,

421
00:28:10.861 --> 00:28:13.410
like the ones I showed you today on the Vionic website,

422
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:18.860
those ugly sandals like strappy straps as are crazy dad sandals with socks.

423
00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:21.630
Of course.
That's not cool.
Why would you get pushback back?

424
00:28:21.631 --> 00:28:24.360
Because I know there's people are going to email me like I wear it that way

425
00:28:24.361 --> 00:28:28.410
because I go,
hi.
Oh my God,
that's terrible.

426
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.660
It's inexcusable.
It's you.

427
00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:34.260
There's no excuse to wear those period with or without socks.

428
00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:38.730
It was a horrendous,
there's other options out there.

429
00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:43.210
You don't talk about those strap on Gopros sandals.
Show them because I,

430
00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:46.440
I feel like there's Birkenstocks.
We're not talking about Birkenstocks.

431
00:28:46.441 --> 00:28:48.000
Birkenstocks are ugly too,
by the way.

432
00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:53.410
These are the fully functional dad sandals or mom's sandals there.
Bingo.

433
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:56.760
Either way.
Yeah.
It's usually the mom sandal.
Actually.

434
00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:01.020
It's the woman who's totally given up.
Oh my God.
I gave up on everything.

435
00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.890
Worst,
the terrible Oh beach basics.

436
00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:10.690
Oh,
these are terrible.
There's no excuse.
There's really no excuse.

437
00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:13.020
Like go back to the strap.
All do better.

438
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:20.460
The terrible.
Absolutely.
Oh my God.
Those are like,
look,

439
00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:24.690
I were orthopedic.
You see like fungus,
nails,

440
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:29.700
nasty ash on the back here.
Those are like a shacks.

441
00:29:29.701 --> 00:29:33.350
Feet go in there,
but look,
let me show you.
So I'm wearing orthopedics right now,

442
00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:37.410
but they're like,
look,
these are orthopedic for people watching.

443
00:29:37.411 --> 00:29:40.770
I'm lifting into the camera.
You can see they're like ballet flats.
They're nice.

444
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:45.310
You wouldn't even know.
That's like I give up.
Everything is shut down.

445
00:29:45.311 --> 00:29:47.650
My genital or closed.
Yeah.
Those are terrible man.

446
00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.800
You shouldn't sell your vagina's shot.
Yeah.

447
00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:54.010
And I see a lot more dudes in it then I see.
Well I'm like,
Gosh,

448
00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.580
I see women with a dude haircuts wearing those.
Yeah,
of course.

449
00:29:57.581 --> 00:30:02.560
That's when you get up off the hair there.
They stopped coloring it.

450
00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:05.230
Yup.
And then they put those on there like,
Hey,

451
00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:09.190
I gotta get kind of getting what I got to get when I'm out there taking care of

452
00:30:09.191 --> 00:30:10.960
life.
Yeah,
it's not.

453
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:16.780
It's usually couples who were those together and they're like sixties they start

454
00:30:16.781 --> 00:30:19.490
to shut it down sexually.
You'll see some in Denver,
by the way.

455
00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:23.140
Those are total Denver shoes.
I know I didn't want to say that,
but yes,

456
00:30:23.141 --> 00:30:27.830
they are Denver shoes.
Yeah,
of course.
Cause they hire great outdoors.
Patagonia.

457
00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:33.700
I was just like being outside and these are just comfortable and you know the

458
00:30:33.701 --> 00:30:37.090
get the job done.
No,
they don't.
No,
they're terrible dude.

459
00:30:37.091 --> 00:30:40.300
There's nothing in this world that can make me wear those gene.
No,

460
00:30:40.301 --> 00:30:43.900
I promise you as your wife,
I will never wear those.
I will never wear,

461
00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:52.660
those are sandals with a heel.
Those are terrible.
All terrible.

462
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:57.450
All these are terrible.
Damn it.
I also asked,
I see whenever I see Birkenstocks,

463
00:30:57.451 --> 00:31:00.130
so I always go like,
I just feel like they stink.
Well,

464
00:31:00.131 --> 00:31:03.790
I feel like they do too because the,
they usually are black.

465
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.880
Like if you look at the under the foot of the person,

466
00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:08.740
they're always black because they're worn down.

467
00:31:08.741 --> 00:31:11.920
You sweat in them and that the leather gets some type of right.

468
00:31:11.921 --> 00:31:15.070
The texture of the black.
Usually it's gross.
They look funky.
Yeah.

469
00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.930
They looked like they smelled beggars.
They're comfortable.
Right.

470
00:31:16.931 --> 00:31:18.070
Cause a lot of people love him.

471
00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:21.940
People love their birds and I guarantee we're going to get a lot of pushback on

472
00:31:21.941 --> 00:31:25.870
the Berks.
I lived in San Francisco.
A lot of people were,
they're terrible.

473
00:31:25.871 --> 00:31:28.600
Speaking of feet small,
this came in,

474
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:32.290
my girlfriend and I were having this discussion today.
She said,

475
00:31:32.291 --> 00:31:36.610
the only time I ever washed my feet is when you're in the shower with me and you

476
00:31:36.611 --> 00:31:37.444
make me.

477
00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:42.160
The rest of the time they get washed from the soapy water and down my body.

478
00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:45.640
I on the other hand,
I'm a firm believer in washing of the feet.

479
00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:49.540
Can the Mommy's discussed this James?
Well James,
I'm with your girlfriend.

480
00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:51.280
Great topic.
I don't wash my feet.

481
00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:55.450
You just pee.
Are you soap?

482
00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:59.260
And then it just peace sterile it sterilizes come on,

483
00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:03.310
fuck gotta be so fucking nasty is calling reality.

484
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:05.351
But I'll tell you what.

485
00:32:05.351 --> 00:32:10.351
I had an ex boyfriend who was very type a very meticulous,

486
00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:14.860
full,
you know,
folded his shirts with the folding board.
Yes.
We didn't last,

487
00:32:14.861 --> 00:32:18.280
obviously I know you didn't last.
I'm a total animal,

488
00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:23.200
but he would insist on washing his feet in the shower.
Really?

489
00:32:23.201 --> 00:32:26.650
And I remember being blown away and I had to pretend like I did that too

490
00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:30.160
regularly.
Like,
Oh yeah,
when you're with him.
I tell the shower too.

491
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:33.940
I totally wash my feet.
I don't know why.

492
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:37.630
I mean I get pedicures and then they scrub them like they get in there.
No,

493
00:32:37.631 --> 00:32:40.070
I'd never do well for,
I mean,

494
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.640
<v 0>unless there's something like there's like I step on tar or something,
you know,</v>

495
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:45.800
but that's it.
Yeah.
I mean I'm in the pool.

496
00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:48.950
I feel like that washes it and the feet are clean.
I don't have,

497
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:52.510
I don't have that problem at all.
I never smelled your feet.
Yeah,

498
00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:55.820
I've never like been,
you know,
Ooh kicked out.

499
00:32:55.821 --> 00:32:58.550
Some people do have just naturally funkier feet,

500
00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:01.970
so maybe they need to know my feet are sweaty,

501
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.200
but I feel like they get washed in the shower.
Will you bring up shacks foot?

502
00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:11.030
Oh,
can you want to,
well,
I keep thinking about it.

503
00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:16.280
There was a,
during playoff coverage,
nasty a few days ago,

504
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:17.361
I think on t.
And.

505
00:33:17.361 --> 00:33:22.361
T they were doing whatever they were doing a remote shot and a or they're at the

506
00:33:22.671 --> 00:33:27.671
game and Shaq took his shoe off and a sock off and showed his size 22 foot.

507
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:32.270
What kind of dog do you think is on that guy?
I don't know.

508
00:33:32.271 --> 00:33:36.620
It's always been a big point of a discussion about whether it's,
yeah,

509
00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.860
it measures up to his enormity cause people,

510
00:33:39.861 --> 00:33:41.840
I think the rumor is that it doesn't,
in other words,

511
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:44.240
not that it's like teeny tiny,

512
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:47.290
it's just that it's not in proportion to his size dibs.

513
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:50.300
This one and no one had sex with Shaquille O'Neal.

514
00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:53.120
Can you let us know now the big question is,

515
00:33:53.121 --> 00:33:56.450
which we've debated hotly on this show is whether or not those things are

516
00:33:56.451 --> 00:33:57.284
correlated,

517
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:02.500
whether or not hand size is correlated to penile size or an indicator of penile

518
00:34:03.471 --> 00:34:06.050
size.
The foot size.
Um

519
00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:14.360
Oh,
oh.
The big toe is,

520
00:34:14.361 --> 00:34:17.960
look at this thing morphed.
Oof.
Poor guy.

521
00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.660
Oh Nasty.

522
00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:26.360
The big toe is what troubles me.
It's just,
it's mashed to the right.

523
00:34:26.361 --> 00:34:31.190
I remember the man wearing shoes that fit when he plays.
No,

524
00:34:31.191 --> 00:34:33.590
no.
It's like a lot of athletes,

525
00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:38.060
particularly in basketball because you are stopping all the time jumping,

526
00:34:38.061 --> 00:34:42.170
running,
and they play these,
you know,
their seasons are 82 games,

527
00:34:42.171 --> 00:34:44.780
seasons and then you practice every day.

528
00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:46.520
A lot of them have really fucked up feet.

529
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:50.330
It's hard to maintain design shoes to help that.

530
00:34:50.331 --> 00:34:53.930
I don't think it's that the shoe is a problem.
It's just the level of activity.

531
00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.980
It's,
it's so much more than,
you know,
you're,

532
00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:00.860
you're constantly pivoting,
jumping,
running,

533
00:35:00.861 --> 00:35:02.870
someone stomping and then,

534
00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.990
and then you play a game the next day and the next day and the next day and the

535
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:08.630
next day.
I remember Jordan's feet were super fucked up.

536
00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:13.480
I saw a photo once he bring it up.
Yeah.
Okay.

537
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:18.560
I mean,
if you want to see it,
yeah.
I kind of do the really fucked up dude.

538
00:35:18.561 --> 00:35:20.120
It's so important to wear good shoes.

539
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:23.930
Especially the older I get now that I'm into orthopedics.
I really,

540
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:29.840
I can't,
I can't even wear flats like regular ballet flats.
They really hurt.
Yeah.

541
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:32.150
I can't do it too.
Since I had a kid,

542
00:35:32.151 --> 00:35:37.040
I just fucked up my whole alignment.
Everything backs all fucked up.

543
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:37.920
Hips are all messed up.

544
00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:39.570
<v 7>I remember it was</v>

545
00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:43.830
<v 0>book,
it was like I had a book.
Uh,
I had a book of it,</v>

546
00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.300
of none of his feet,
but of him and they,
he was on the trainer's table.

547
00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:50.880
And I remember the comment from his wife was like,

548
00:35:50.881 --> 00:35:54.690
I can't believe you let them take a picture of that because she didn't,

549
00:35:54.691 --> 00:35:58.260
she was kind of like trying to protect him,
you know?
But I don't see it.

550
00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:02.490
Um,
oh well.
But yeah,
they're there.

551
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:07.470
It's really common for these athletes have super fun that,
I don't know.

552
00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:11.830
<v 7>Chicago Bulls,
Michael Jordan.
Well they're all taped up.</v>

553
00:36:11.831 --> 00:36:14.330
You can see that and you can tell there's something resting.

554
00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.500
His nails are all jacked up.
Yeah.

555
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:21.440
<v 0>They're all fucked up.
I fucked up.
But it's just from,
from being crazy athletes,</v>

556
00:36:21.441 --> 00:36:23.810
you know?
Sure is.
I know what that's like,
unless you sure do.

557
00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.610
<v 7>I had the best thing ever happened to me on the flight home from New York.</v>

558
00:36:27.611 --> 00:36:32.020
From g Dork titties.
Yeah.
I was wearing the gene sweatshirt.

559
00:36:32.021 --> 00:36:35.380
It's like my favorite thing now.
I wear it all the time.
And uh,

560
00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.950
the stewardess was,
I'm sorry,
flight attendant.
I got,
sorry.
I'm sorry.

561
00:36:38.951 --> 00:36:41.140
I was such a cisgendered comment.
Yeah,
it was terrible.

562
00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:46.360
She comes up to me and she goes,
oh,
is it Jean or John?

563
00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:50.200
I'm from Montreal.
And I was like,
it's just Jean.

564
00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:55.240
You shouldn't say Sean's Jean.
I couldn't lie to her.
I should have said John,

565
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:58.240
why couldn't you lie to her?
I just didn't think of it on the spot.
I'm so like,

566
00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:02.920
I'm so earnest.
Yeah.
Real life.
I can't,
I can't be,
I can't lie.
This nice people.

567
00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:07.930
Um,
Jean Jacques Jean,
I really liked that.
I wish I had it recorded.

568
00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.030
They're calling this guy the Anti Dad boner.
Okay.

569
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:15.240
<v 0>So you know the dad boners obviously really lose their mind and they celebrate</v>

570
00:37:15.241 --> 00:37:19.530
things.
Yeah.
Um,
they just are,
you know,

571
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:23.430
you can't,
you can't bring a dad Boehner down.
Right.
They just,

572
00:37:23.431 --> 00:37:27.690
they get excited about,
uh,
anything really.

573
00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:30.900
Uh,
oh is this,
this is muted.
Sorry.

574
00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:36.250
<v 11>Oh my God.
It sounds like an Alco now.
They get excited.
Oh,</v>

575
00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:37.220
so that's it.

576
00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:40.790
<v 0>Dad boner.
If you're new,
that is a dab on it.</v>

577
00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:44.630
This guy is upset about things.
It's different.
Grumpy Dad.

578
00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:48.710
<v 12>I been churching farther.
Portholes Oh,</v>

579
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:55.020
he's on this.
Look at this shit.
You got to ride in the middle of the fucking road

580
00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:59.840
fucking zone.
It's fucking,
oh my

581
00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:03.190
God.
Fuck.

582
00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:06.170
<v 7>Look how bad that road is.
Terrible.</v>

583
00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:07.733
<v 12>Okay.
Shit.</v>

584
00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:11.680
<v 11>Yeah.
Oh my God.
What to do here?
What do I do?
Do I stop?</v>

585
00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:15.580
Do I get it over on your car?
Okay,
my carpet moving.
What the fuck,
dude?
Oh my God.

586
00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:19.060
Fuck a fucking head.
It's like miles.

587
00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:25.010
I feel like I put on,
it's just fucking listen.
Fuck.
Oh fuck.
I'm good.

588
00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:29.320
This is the kind of dad I grew up with.
Yeah,
we'll step.
Dad was more like this.

589
00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:34.090
He was fired up.
That shit.
That shit.

590
00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.153
<v 4>Okay.</v>

591
00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:45.450
<v 11>Kicking the dirt like a dog.
Oh,
that's terrible.</v>

592
00:38:45.451 --> 00:38:48.580
That'll fuck your tires up.
Som,
you know.
Oh my God.

593
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:53.930
This is ridiculous.
He's right.
It is.
It's not cool going.

594
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:57.840
That's why he prays hair.
That road is just completely battered,
man.
No,

595
00:38:57.850 --> 00:38:59.430
that's no good.
Potholes in my,

596
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.753
<v 4>okay.</v>

597
00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:13.470
<v 11>Worth fucking hauled them away.
I'm going to worry is I don't know.</v>

598
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:18.080
In America.
Piece of shit,
motherfucker.
Yeah.

599
00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:20.900
He's just yelling at the road though.
Yeah.

600
00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:24.090
You don't want even comes out of this fucking road.
They know better.

601
00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:28.800
I've driven on road.
It is unnerving to drive on this didn't fucking war zone.

602
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.720
What the fuck pocket.
That's how I blew out our tire gene.
Really

603
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.660
<v 7>on the our car.
That's how it happened.</v>

604
00:39:34.661 --> 00:39:38.410
I was on a pothole on sunset up towards the four oh five.
Yeah.

605
00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:42.460
And I took one too fast and the guy says,
look,
I can tell it was a pothole.

606
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:44.110
They did this to your car.
He told me he showed me.

607
00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:49.120
<v 11>Yeah.
So I'm going to go slow.
Very cautious.</v>

608
00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:50.480
And it is like an IEP.
Yes.

609
00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:56.470
<v 4>Fucking terrible
shit.
That's how you're going to be.</v>

610
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:57.970
I mean it's fucking town hall

611
00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.320
probably to be larger at that.

612
00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:07.520
Wow.

613
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:13.480
Look at that.
That is unbelievable.
The Shit.

614
00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:18.850
This shit
kidding.
It's pretty bad.

615
00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:23.580
My tax paying fucking dollars doing that.
Fuck.

616
00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:24.483
Are they doing,

617
00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:29.520
<v 0>yeah.
You mentioned you're walking by and seeing that guy making that.
No.
Um,</v>

618
00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:34.220
all right,
so we've got to get to this.
Yeah.
If you're a new listener to the show.

619
00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.713
One of our

620
00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:42.160
all time great regulars on this show has been a my father and sometimes my

621
00:40:45.651 --> 00:40:46.484
mother.

622
00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:51.910
And yesterday I had them in here for a little sit down where I got to just talk

623
00:40:52.851 --> 00:40:56.060
to them in general and also catch up on some,
uh,

624
00:40:57.050 --> 00:41:00.910
some show topics and even play some games with them.

625
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:04.430
<v 7>Uh,
I can't,
I mean when we are prepping the games,
I was so excited.</v>

626
00:41:04.431 --> 00:41:05.630
I want to sit in here to listen.

627
00:41:05.631 --> 00:41:08.390
But then I thought I'd probably better if I wait until we play it back.

628
00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:10.880
But we also spent the last week with them.

629
00:41:10.881 --> 00:41:14.780
We haven't even gone over that and we got to hear so many wonderful stories from

630
00:41:14.781 --> 00:41:15.690
them about your mom,

631
00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:20.130
<v 0>Donna.
I can't pronounce words.
He always says</v>

632
00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:24.490
<v 7>my favorite moment by far.
It was when we were looking for a movie to watch.</v>

633
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:27.910
And Your Dad's reading off the actors and what does he say,
Tom?

634
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:33.390
<v 0>He's like Chris Pratt and Emma Stone and Vincent,</v>

635
00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:40.940
no,
on a free on
shit.
So he goes,
Vince it,

636
00:41:40.941 --> 00:41:44.440
Donna Freon and they near peanut right away.
And I said,

637
00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:47.000
and I don't know what I enjoy him anymore.

638
00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:51.320
He has it care is when he talks and he says something wacky or when you repeat

639
00:41:51.321 --> 00:41:53.750
it perfectly because you do a really good impression of him.

640
00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.520
It's like hearing him in Stereo.
He also,

641
00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:01.160
he mispronounces words that I don't like for years.
Right.

642
00:42:01.161 --> 00:42:05.570
He would say a pdf file,
pdf file.
And I would go,
every time you said it,

643
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:08.480
I would knew what he was trying to say,
but I would go,
what's that?

644
00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:13.100
And he would turn to me like the guy that fucks kids.
Right.
And I would say,

645
00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:16.580
so you mean pedophile?
Oh yeah.
And then you just move on.
And I go,

646
00:42:16.581 --> 00:42:20.720
why do you keep saying it wrong?
I'm like,
what are like,

647
00:42:20.721 --> 00:42:24.860
we're both news junkies,
right?
We both read news watching it.
He'll be like,

648
00:42:24.861 --> 00:42:28.970
did you get here?
This,
uh,
Steve Bannon is doing,
I go,
it's Bannon.

649
00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:31.640
I bet you hear it a hundred times a day.

650
00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:37.310
It's the same guy we put,
it's not a new guy that they mentioned.

651
00:42:37.311 --> 00:42:39.440
Once he sees the word,

652
00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:43.040
he hears it pronounced and then he mispronounces it over and over.

653
00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:48.070
But I think it's because he doesn't have an ear for like music or language.

654
00:42:48.081 --> 00:42:50.030
You have to have an easy ride.
Right.
That's a good point.

655
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:53.840
You have to be tuned into it and he's just not tuned in.

656
00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:59.010
See they were saying this Gerrard Kushi has gotten like Gerad Jared Kushner.

657
00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:05.480
Yeah.
I'm like,
why do you,
why are you saying Gerad right.
He's getting it.

658
00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:10.220
He's confused with Carmichael.
Yeah.
He's a big Carmichael fan.
Yeah.
Yeah.

659
00:43:10.221 --> 00:43:13.640
It's so bizarre to me.
So,
um,
I think you'll really enjoy,

660
00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:17.960
I'm going to mute our mix just to hear how this starts.
It's audio only.

661
00:43:17.961 --> 00:43:22.250
People will always inevitably go,
why isn't there a video of them?
They're old.

662
00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:23.960
They don't want to be video.
You know,

663
00:43:23.961 --> 00:43:27.320
it's just like when you bust out a camera with mom will be like,
go away.

664
00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:31.910
They could picture what she doesn't want to be on camera.
So,
uh,
it's,
believe me,

665
00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:36.230
the audio is more than sufficient.
Just for a moment,

666
00:43:36.231 --> 00:43:38.030
I'm going to mute us just so you can hear this.

667
00:43:38.031 --> 00:43:42.260
Only because I want you to my dad.
My Dad is a legendary,

668
00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:45.770
a heavy breather too.
So here you go.

669
00:43:56.410 --> 00:44:01.120
<v 13>MMM,
definitely hear you breathing.</v>

670
00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:03.640
That's for sure.
Can you,
uh,

671
00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:09.880
can you just talk into the microphone mom?
No,
go.
Can you hear me too?

672
00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.600
Okay.
There you are.
Let's see.

673
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.930
Holy Shit.
What is up with that?
Just the way of rice.

674
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.020
I mean,
I cannot not do this.
If you're going to go,

675
00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:44.880
that's how he,
okay.

676
00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:51.520
I don't have to,
don't feel bad for him.

677
00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:00.810
I could have a fart.
Why we do this show?
No,
please don't.
I can't help it.

678
00:45:00.811 --> 00:45:03.060
Then you got to leave with,
you have to do that.
Just leave.

679
00:45:03.061 --> 00:45:06.210
You're going to get in a tight space.
Don't do that.
Just get up and leave.

680
00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:10.300
Do it outside.
Seriously.
Seriously.
It'll really ruin this.

681
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:15.180
Really ruined this.
They'll be able to do it.
Does it smell that bad?

682
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:17.850
How can you act like you don't know if it smells that bad?

683
00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:21.990
<v 0>So we had a moments earlier.
You don't know what happened.</v>

684
00:45:21.991 --> 00:45:25.710
I think you forget what you did.
I think it was both the kid down.
Yeah.

685
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:32.270
I had walked into the Ed just entered the living room like I'm the,

686
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:37.200
I'm like hitting you.
It smelled like a sewage canal.
And I go,

687
00:45:37.201 --> 00:45:41.760
what the fuck is that?
And he goes,
I just had a little one.
I was like,

688
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:45.210
and my mom,
I go,
cause she'll think that,
you know,
I go,

689
00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:48.990
just walk towards the living room.
Yeah.
She turned around.
She was like,
oh my God.

690
00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:52.170
Oh yeah.
And I go,
it smells like a sick person.
Yeah.
Like it doesn't,

691
00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:53.363
it doesn't smell right.

692
00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:54.490
<v 7>I was like,
diarrhea.</v>

693
00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:59.170
Well he farted in the car when we were on the way to the country club and I

694
00:45:59.171 --> 00:46:03.090
smelled it.
I pretend I didn't want to talk about it,
but it was really Ranson.
Oh,

695
00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:07.600
that's like worse napalm.
This was worse.
Yeah.
So I was just telling him,
right,
I,

696
00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:11.770
if you fart here,
this is over.
Well,
this is a small studio and no,
you can't fart.

697
00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:14.590
Yeah.
It's,
it's not like other people's farts.
People don't understand.

698
00:46:14.591 --> 00:46:17.860
It's really not.
Oh my God.
Remember when they farted in front of our nanny,

699
00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:23.110
<v 0>farted loudly because we were watching a movie and there would be like a scene</v>

700
00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:27.400
where,
you know,
it's like the scene fades out and my mom went

701
00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:33.180
far and I turn and walking past the living room and I was like,

702
00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.110
his mouth dropped.
Then I saw her head turn

703
00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:41.660
<v 7>cause she's like a nice Guatemalan lady.
She hasn't,
she doesn't do that.
No,</v>

704
00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.460
there's no way.
No,
no,
no.
Like there's no way.

705
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:45.290
Oh my mom was mortified when I told her

706
00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:50.710
<v 13>she heard you fuckers.
Yeah.
To me it smells.
No,
no,
no,</v>

707
00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:54.920
no.
And actually when you catch an infection,
it actually was like a,

708
00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:58.980
like,
it was actually scary how bad that smelled.
Really.
I did.

709
00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:01.910
That had been anybody else.
I mean even as you,

710
00:47:01.911 --> 00:47:04.100
I would tell somebody that you didn't immediately go to a doctor.

711
00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:07.160
I think I'm just,
I'm not even joking.
No,
it's true.
It's funny.
It's funny,

712
00:47:07.161 --> 00:47:10.340
but I told you last night.
Always smell like that.
No,

713
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:15.590
we all have our own fingerprint in the intestines.
Okay.

714
00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:20.440
Nothing about that.
Smells even remotely normal.
It smells like it.

715
00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:23.780
Smells were really,
really different.
It doesn't snow a normal.
Okay.

716
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:28.030
I think that would infection.
How do you know you don't have one?

717
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:32.490
Because I had that normal smell for years.
I live next to you.

718
00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:38.530
Please open the sheets.
I couldn't base.
Do you have a,
Hey,

719
00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:41.910
I'm not picking on where you are.
I think we have a second.

720
00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.360
<v 7>Oh yeah.
Cause you had questions for me because I wanted to,</v>

721
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:47.160
I wanted to add more ideas.
Yeah.

722
00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:52.670
<v 13>Okay.
Yeah.
I wonder if,
uh,
no,</v>

723
00:47:52.671 --> 00:47:57.360
you can't hear it.
Does it?
Sometimes you can hear what's going okay.
But I think,

724
00:47:57.361 --> 00:48:00.820
I think we were,
we let we led right into that,
right?
Yeah.
All right.

725
00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:06.500
Christina asked me to ask you how you like your new Bra.
I Dunno.

726
00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:11.340
About what was the experience like?
Oh my God.
I feel like a normal human being.

727
00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:12.510
Can you hear me breathing?

728
00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:17.080
<v 7>Yes.
It's alarming now,
just so the listeners know your mother,
uh,</v>

729
00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:20.580
I don't know how to put this delicately delicately.
She's big.
Sloppers like me.

730
00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:25.410
Yeah.
But she's been wearing the wrong size bra for her whole life for Sunday.

731
00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:26.460
You knew this already yet.

732
00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:31.050
Cause I bought cars from one big tip monster to another.
I look and I go,

733
00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:32.070
you need to go to Nordstrom.

734
00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.790
You need to have a girl measure you because they're trained.
And I,

735
00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:38.340
we got her the right fit and it changed everything.
She looked amazing.

736
00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:43.250
<v 13>Thank tits up.
I feel like I have actually.
Eh,
how about just sit back,</v>

737
00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:47.840
sit back?
Yeah.
I have him slip and lift it up.
Boom for the booklet.

738
00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:52.580
Really jump up and down.
I am sexy.
Yeah.

739
00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:57.880
I can't even think I'm sexy because what happened was Christina took you and you

740
00:48:58.671 --> 00:49:03.350
were wearing a bra that they all be measured.
You I was wearing all my life.

741
00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:08.240
It's any foreseen.
Yeah.
And I think to be [inaudible] g

742
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:13.070
um,
first I told the lady,
I said make any sense,

743
00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:18.510
but the truth is it fits me like a glove to me.
Look at this.
Yeah,
we're good.

744
00:49:18.511 --> 00:49:19.070
This,
yeah,

745
00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:23.720
you'll finally got upset because the boobs had employees and passing on Friday.

746
00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:26.030
It looks like a perfect fit to me.
They said perfect fit,

747
00:49:26.031 --> 00:49:28.760
but what it bothers him is that because they fit me,

748
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:31.970
they're not flying all over and jumping up and down the way he would like.

749
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:36.470
Is that true?
It is.
I think if you have g yeah,
boobs,

750
00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:41.210
g boobs,
or are really gigantic.
I mean if you go to,

751
00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:46.640
if you Google g boobs,
you'll find,
or you'll find some big books.

752
00:49:46.641 --> 00:49:48.490
Okay.
Yeah.
I think what the,

753
00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:52.790
I thought we got the explanation that that was just the size.
I didn't,

754
00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:57.820
I didn't see that.
Okay,
so Sony did I put B?

755
00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:02.240
Okay,
well I didn't,
I didn't persist.

756
00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:07.220
I have to go go European Bra sizes versus American.

757
00:50:07.221 --> 00:50:11.540
Okay.
Okay,
so what he got up there,

758
00:50:11.541 --> 00:50:16.310
and these are numbers,
so 28 let's go to cup size.
Screw the numbers.
Okay.
Okay.

759
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:19.980
We're talking cops.
Really not bursar or Garth.

760
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:24.290
You want to get into the real tests?
You got to go there.
The Cup size.
Okay.

761
00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:29.780
Let's see what this says here.
I love it.
Excited.
Those are just pictures.

762
00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:34.550
Is there a ted pictures and look for the conversion.
Okay.

763
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:39.080
Cupsoles Bra.
I was kind of brought her,
maybe this will be it.

764
00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:44.250
Try and make sense to him,
you know.
Hey,
can you pause for a second?
Yeah.
Yeah.

765
00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:48.860
<v 0>I think he was upset because he felt jipped right.</v>

766
00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:53.720
Cause we came home and I texted her mother,
Hey,
what a top dog.

767
00:50:53.721 --> 00:50:57.710
Think about your new boobs.
Yeah.
And she texted me back.
He's upset.

768
00:50:57.711 --> 00:51:00.350
He's disappointed.
Yeah.
And then you said,

769
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:06.120
I said it's because he wants them spelling out.
Right.
So the,

770
00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:06.770
the,

771
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:11.770
the bra that's an ill fitting is exciting to him because tests are falling out

772
00:51:11.841 --> 00:51:16.730
of it.
So he feels gypped.
Like he feels like we,
we snuck in.
Yeah.
And ruined his,

773
00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:20.840
his tip pleasure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
True.
Interesting.

774
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:25.640
<v 13>Okay.
If I am at three,
so g here.
Yeah.</v>

775
00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:30.050
It was tripled the USA say,
mom,

776
00:51:30.051 --> 00:51:34.730
can you show me how those big tits,
Raj,
how the deep big debts far.

777
00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:39.920
Yeah.
That's unfair.
Tommy,
can you,
can you make them?

778
00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:45.710
Yeah.
What is you talking about?

779
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:50.230
People want it.
People want to know if you can show them how those big tits fart.

780
00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:55.600
Okay.
I would think in this serious,
yeah.
Okay.

781
00:51:55.601 --> 00:52:00.250
Let's go to
you went to far?
Yeah.
Oh,

782
00:52:00.251 --> 00:52:03.490
he's in the song.
He was going to be hell or what?
Yeah.
Um,

783
00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:06.760
<v 0>this was a song that we sing all the time.
Yeah.</v>

784
00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:09.590
We saw you get in the car and then she came up with her version.
Yeah.

785
00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:14.540
<v 13>Uh,
can you,
oh,
d one to five.</v>

786
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.450
We talking real far.
Far,
far,
far as a,
as this far right.

787
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:25.543
Really

788
00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:31.000
because the original song is do you run a park?
Can you really?

789
00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:36.210
Can you really fuck
do you one to five.

790
00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:40.550
One to five.
One to five.
Five,
five.
Oh

791
00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:49.750
Wow.

792
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:52.080
<v 0>Really good.</v>

793
00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:57.080
I really hope that at least maybe one of our genius musical listeners can do

794
00:52:58.081 --> 00:53:02.100
something with that.
Create a real tune out of that.
I think it's already working.

795
00:53:02.101 --> 00:53:03.420
It's already happening.

796
00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:09.530
<v 13>Oh No.
That was the one you add this morning in the bathroom.
You also,</v>

797
00:53:09.531 --> 00:53:11.240
both of you forward in front of our nanny.

798
00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:16.430
That would be less embarrassing to talk about that you did,
but hers,
hers,

799
00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:22.190
any dust,
I suppose,
higher than mine.
That was a really sad,

800
00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:25.710
I got to study this,
this cup size chart.
What did you see?

801
00:53:25.711 --> 00:53:29.810
Did you do it says right here,
Europe,
g triple D

802
00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:36.180
or e or actually if they are UK.
Yeah,
if it was UK,
Gee,
it'd be an f.

803
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:41.250
But that makes sense.
So you're,
I am at three.
Paul D.
Yeah.

804
00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:44.280
So that makes sense.
That makes total sense.
Better.

805
00:53:44.281 --> 00:53:48.260
We were doing everything wrong because I was using city for

806
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:54.060
30 yeah.
And then you drove me to 30 was a little tight and that was good.

807
00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:56.790
It stretches a little bit.
So what is it,

808
00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:58.830
what is your disappointment in these bars?

809
00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:02.930
Because he's just kind of flattened everything out.
No cleavage sweats.

810
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.130
I like lay beach.
I like how each and Bush was the first time he's a Bush,

811
00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:11.340
but cleavage cleavage.
I've always,
I was raised on Clay Beach.
Okay.
Yeah.

812
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:16.790
When I was,
when I was,
you know,
a good little Catholic boy going to move.

813
00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:21.480
You didn't have all,
you have habits clean each.
Yeah.
Most.
Okay.
So

814
00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:26.200
that's not,
that's not pushed together cleavage.
That's,

815
00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:28.710
<v 7>see,
so that's what it was.
Yeah.</v>

816
00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:34.550
The comfort provided by the good fitting Bra and dominates what he likes us

817
00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:37.380
clover.
Yeah.
Well here's your,
here's the deal.

818
00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:40.530
You can also buy a bra that fits and that creates cleavage.

819
00:54:40.531 --> 00:54:44.400
But your mother was insistent upon not buying a bra that was too sexy.

820
00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:47.010
So we got our eyebrows that were in a comfort zone,

821
00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:51.300
but she didn't want like the Sassy ones is one.
I'm trying to say.
I tried,

822
00:54:51.301 --> 00:54:54.420
believe me,
I wanted to,
I wanted to do this for your dad more than anybody.

823
00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:58.260
Like I wanted your mom to come back with a little Sassy,
tattooed.

824
00:54:58.350 --> 00:55:00.870
She was the first person to ever say tits don't fart.

825
00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:05.920
She answered right?
She was like,
do you still buy?
They still fine.

826
00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:08.310
Most people don't push back on that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

827
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:10.730
<v 13>Interesting.
Do you want me to get him a smaller,</v>

828
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:16.030
so the thing pops out a little bit smaller and kind of little claim each.

829
00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:19.630
I like to run on,
you pay for the boob lift so you don't need a boob lift.

830
00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:22.830
You've got great boobs.
No.
Okay.
You just have the wrong bra.
Yes.

831
00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:26.440
All that they have,
they make pushup bras.

832
00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:29.990
They make bras to put them together.
So this one just flattened everything out.

833
00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:35.240
It seems like he's making his case.
I you gotta respect the case.

834
00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:38.330
That's the most stupid case I ever hear.
Hello.
Look at this.

835
00:55:38.331 --> 00:55:41.970
I can jump up and down and nothing move.
Well,

836
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.060
I guess you've got to look at it from your point of view.

837
00:55:44.061 --> 00:55:47.060
If you really look at it.
Perfect.
I know,
I know,
but if you're comfortable,

838
00:55:47.330 --> 00:55:52.210
but it's still likely beach,
you need to find a different woman that,
oh,

839
00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:57.560
how's the trip been for you so far?
The best.
It's been fantastic.
Honestly,

840
00:55:57.590 --> 00:56:00.020
the best repair ever in every sense.

841
00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:04.670
Thrown the minute that we got in the playing and that is spoiling little bed

842
00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:09.270
that yeah,
I am talking or no,
is it my turn?

843
00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:14.720
<v 7>There's,
there's uh,
this Mike come right here.
Right?
Mute his mic.
Really?
Yeah.</v>

844
00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:18.300
The breathing is overwhelming to me.
I,
I feel like he has to go to the doc.

845
00:56:18.301 --> 00:56:20.090
This is what makes every phone call is like,

846
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:26.343
<v 14>yeah.</v>

847
00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:31.320
<v 15>And getting more because I'll be down there.
It is.
Yeah.
Yes,
I did.</v>

848
00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:36.060
Well then we come here.
I got aliases.
Absolutely.

849
00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:40.860
To die for it's ratios.
Perfect.
Beautiful boy.

850
00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:44.070
However,
if I am doing,
I will take a DNA test.

851
00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:48.060
I know doing like that too.
Is it starting to look so much like his mind?

852
00:56:48.061 --> 00:56:50.800
I don't see he really is a perfect kid

853
00:56:52.530 --> 00:56:56.840
and so intelligent.
He observed the sense we have to bring up colon.

854
00:56:56.850 --> 00:56:58.100
I'm muted your mic and see our dead.

855
00:56:58.170 --> 00:57:03.170
We have to bring up one point that that Alex gave me a lot of kisses and I think

856
00:57:05.461 --> 00:57:08.250
you got your head like grandparent battles.
Who could?

857
00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:12.600
Ellis would give him the most kisses
first kiss.

858
00:57:12.601 --> 00:57:14.880
Was it yesterday or today?
I can't remember now.

859
00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:20.610
I'm about 25 kisses to your two or three right now.

860
00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:24.230
Know that that's fact.
I mean,
we've done it with facts,
not carrots.

861
00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:26.490
I have to admit,
you know,
and,
and I think that,

862
00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:29.700
I don't know why to me I'm convinced is because I think it's confidence.

863
00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:34.240
I told you I've got my theory on it.
I think he confuses your five.
We're doing,

864
00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:37.740
he looks at I like and he says,
no,
no,
no Tom,
he has a beard.

865
00:57:38.130 --> 00:57:42.540
It doesn't cause opinion.
I'm clean shaven every day of my life.
Um,

866
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:47.640
and that's true.
It's true.
So it's,
it's really,
I think it's the,

867
00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:51.540
the vibes vibes.
Maybe eight that I soak hot.
Yeah.

868
00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:57.800
<v 7>Just occurred to me is that your dad was wearing the same outfit the whole week.</v>

869
00:57:57.950 --> 00:58:00.330
Yeah.
Like he didn't change.
He came over,

870
00:58:00.331 --> 00:58:04.670
he was wearing Khakis that were too big for him.
He's lost weight once.
Right.

871
00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:09.450
But I'm saying he were oversized Khakis with a belt and then the Khakis will

872
00:58:09.451 --> 00:58:13.770
come up over the belt because it was too,
too big.
But he didn't want,

873
00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:15.600
he didn't want to buy pants of fit.
No.

874
00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:19.360
He went where the big pants and then he laid on the couch.
Murray,

875
00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:23.370
he was laying there watching that movie and two buttons came on done.

876
00:58:23.371 --> 00:58:26.650
And then his who,
she was hanging out,
his stomach was hanging out.
Yeah.

877
00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:30.540
It's so funny.
He hates being comfortable.
He was comfortable.

878
00:58:30.541 --> 00:58:34.140
You've got that wrong.
He says he's comfortable.
I am comfortable.

879
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:41.100
He came over,
it was like a chill day and just laid in Khakis and a button down.

880
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:44.430
And that was his comfort.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
A belt.

881
00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:45.780
<v 14>Yeah,</v>

882
00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:47.950
<v 7>I'd loafers.
That's his comfort.</v>

883
00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:51.920
It makes me so uncomfortable watching t shirt and sweatpants.
Yeah.
Yeah.

884
00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:55.410
I can't do it.
I get home.
I don't have to take everything off right away.
Me

885
00:58:55.410 --> 00:59:00.140
<v 15>Too.
I'm the same way.
I walk around in my boxers right in front of the nanny too.</v>

886
00:59:00.930 --> 00:59:05.920
What else gets fuck out of here?
Tommy's right.
You go in with,

887
00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:10.300
you hesitate when you go in.
You're almost looking for protection.
I am trying.
No,

888
00:59:10.301 --> 00:59:13.000
I go in with full confidence.
I'm going to get it.
Yes.
Yeah,
that's true.

889
00:59:13.810 --> 00:59:18.640
Let me ask you this.
Recently,
you called me from the Orlando Airport.

890
00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:22.160
Do you remember this?
Oh yeah.
That was really,

891
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.320
I know people would want to hear about this.

892
00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:29.270
You called me from the Orlando Airport from the same restroom stall

893
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:34.280
about,
you know,
it was probably almost,

894
00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:37.190
almost 20 years ago when I had,

895
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:42.160
I did the little little accident in the my pants and they were aligned to

896
00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:46.670
airport and I had to leave my underwear in the stall.
Well,

897
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:50.440
what I did was the other day,
a little time,
I went back and revisited.

898
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:54.680
Wow.
The location took a picture of the stall.
You really,
I did.

899
00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:59.780
I haven't timed it.
And you know,
they've,
they've made some modifications.
The,

900
00:59:59.781 --> 01:00:01.400
the uh,
they all make,

901
01:00:01.401 --> 01:00:05.090
all the places have bigger handicap stalls now it's the law,
you know,

902
01:00:05.091 --> 01:00:09.880
but that spot is still there and uh,
went in and you know,

903
01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:12.770
it's just kind of relived that moment,
you know,

904
01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:17.120
some people message me that they're at the Orlando airport and they want to know

905
01:00:17.121 --> 01:00:20.280
what stall it happening so they can go visit.
It now needs

906
01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.680
to be terminal side.
It's on the,
it's on,
be on here.

907
01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:28.040
If you come up out of be baggage claim,
maybe they want to know what it is.

908
01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:33.041
So they come up out of baggage claim B and go to the right before you,

909
01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:36.830
there it is.
He,

910
01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:43.100
through his underwear there had to leave the underwear and even had shit on his

911
01:00:43.101 --> 01:00:47.860
pants.
But guess what?
He just happened to him again and his office.
What?

912
01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:50.110
Why don't you tell them?
Oh,

913
01:00:50.110 --> 01:00:55.110
I told you about that when I had a little fumble in the office recently.

914
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:59.300
Yeah.
What happened?
I couldn't get,
I was,
I was heading in there.

915
01:00:59.301 --> 01:01:02.000
I thought I had perfect timing,
but I had,
you know,

916
01:01:02.001 --> 01:01:04.740
at some suits they had that other book.
Yeah.

917
01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:09.880
And I had trouble getting that undone and before I could make the turn and

918
01:01:10.071 --> 01:01:14.210
dropped the drawers,
I had a little foam ball.
How much?
Not a lot,

919
01:01:14.211 --> 01:01:18.470
but enough to go in the wrong places where I had to actually.

920
01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:19.820
Did you go home now?

921
01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:24.850
What I did was I just threw the underwear where I cleaned up in there and a,

922
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:29.120
I just wear my suit pants.
No underwear,
no underwear.

923
01:01:29.570 --> 01:01:33.230
Was it on your legs and stuff too?
No,
it was a little bit on the leg,

924
01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:37.060
but I got that off
mostly on cheeks.

925
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:39.043
This is,

926
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:45.850
and it was a stinker too.
I mean,
yeah,

927
01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:50.000
if that's any indication of what comes out,
I'm sure it was a stinker,

928
01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:52.580
but uh,
you know,

929
01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:55.760
I thought about going home man and change it,

930
01:01:55.761 --> 01:01:59.330
but I figured pretty much got everything done with that one.

931
01:01:59.331 --> 01:02:03.320
But I think he's been out of talking to the mic.
No,
no,
I'm paying,
I'm in battles.

932
01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.840
Why are you embarrassed?
Because this is disgusting.

933
01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:12.590
It's just part of life.
I'm kind of flights reality.
I needed Ponson yet floating.

934
01:02:13.350 --> 01:02:17.010
I said,
what do you do when you're done the way I left it in my office.
Oh No,

935
01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:22.010
not in the lunch room.
I said to in the bench where you throw your hook.
He said,

936
01:02:22.011 --> 01:02:22.801
so why are they killing?

937
01:02:22.801 --> 01:02:25.050
People are coming in as a so you want where you have your hand towel.

938
01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:27.520
So I just throw it in there and people put ant dials and adopt.

939
01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:30.900
Nobody's going to see it.
I mean,
paper towels,
paper towels.

940
01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:40.080
I felt good though after I did that though.
Let me know.
Yeah.

941
01:02:41.310 --> 01:02:45.970
Yeah,
but it doesn't,
it doesn't.
He live on the air.

942
01:02:46.090 --> 01:02:50.520
His office a good sound.
Yeah.
Far.
You know that um,
there's this couple,

943
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.470
a mother and son that they got married.
Yeah.

944
01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:59.970
Can you imagine marrying your one of your children?
No.
That's a joke.
No,
no,
no.

945
01:03:00.350 --> 01:03:04.530
[inaudible] I know they just got arrested.
Waiting.
What part?

946
01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.030
Um,
I forget.

947
01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:12.400
<v 16>I'm your mom and you're my son and I if falling in love with him,
he said,</v>

948
01:03:12.490 --> 01:03:14.920
are you really?
I said,
yes,
I am.
He's thinking,
you know what?

949
01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:17.740
I was scared to let you know too.
I am too.

950
01:03:17.830 --> 01:03:21.680
<v 17>They're both consenting adults.
If,
if it comes down to it,
you know,</v>

951
01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:23.960
it's just like the gays.
They're there,
you know,

952
01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:27.230
as long as they're over 18 everything's fine.

953
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:32.300
<v 15>What?
Yeah.
Well they want to do jail time for 18 months.</v>

954
01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:36.310
So I guess,
you know,
I have never heard a story like this in my life.
I know.

955
01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.700
<v 16>Will you ever date your mom?
And he said,
well,
you did your son.
And I said,
y'all,</v>

956
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:41.080
it's truth.
Yes,
I would.

957
01:03:41.590 --> 01:03:45.220
Because 19 years you're the best thing that ever happened to me and I really

958
01:03:45.221 --> 01:03:46.054
want to be with you.
Right.

959
01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:50.370
<v 15>God
grow.
So these hit no girl to this.
This is,</v>

960
01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:54.090
it's unconceivable.
Yeah,
that's pretty bad.
Yeah.

961
01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:58.870
What is sick minds?
Yeah.
We used to be scared of the teacher with the student.

962
01:03:58.930 --> 01:04:01.540
I know now as a mother with a son,
mother,
and the son.

963
01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:05.610
<v 17>The first approach was actually me and I'm like,
what happened?</v>

964
01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:10.570
We were hanging out and you know,
just talking.
And I was just loud.

965
01:04:11.370 --> 01:04:16.260
I looked at her and she looked at me and I just,
I kissed her.
Was a real kiss.

966
01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:21.230
<v 15>Did he knew what his mother?
Of course,
of course you notes it's just mother.
Yeah,</v>

967
01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:26.090
I was a real kiss.
Oh,
let me know.
See it.
I know.

968
01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:29.600
I'm gonna know.
It's got to be a joke.
I know.
It's real.
They got arrested.

969
01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:32.810
There was an,
then we followed up on the story.
They got arrested.

970
01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:36.260
I can not believe this is true.
Would you marry your grandson?

971
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:43.070
I
want is going more than crazy now.
Yeah.

972
01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:48.140
No,
I'm not kidding you.
This is to,
yes,
we're getting too extreme craziness.

973
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:53.140
Yeah.
You'll know.
Tomorrow you're going to find out your fire.
Really exciting.

974
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:56.480
Isis.
Oh really?
Dad?
Yeah,
you're an isis.

975
01:04:57.530 --> 01:05:02.420
Tell him that's one organization.
I would never even joke being apart.

976
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:07.850
Um,
the,
uh,
a lot of the listeners want to hear,

977
01:05:07.851 --> 01:05:09.320
what'd you rather it's with you guys.
Okay.

978
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:14.930
They want to hear what would you rather,
okay.
Okay.
Let's see.
Oh,

979
01:05:14.931 --> 01:05:17.690
wrong button.
Not Related Farther.

980
01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:22.560
My now here,
the breathing.
Yeah,
it's a lot.

981
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:24.130
<v 4>I had to park.</v>

982
01:05:27.730 --> 01:05:28.970
<v 15>You hear that?
Yeah.</v>

983
01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:37.550
<v 4>Drink
the top layer.</v>

984
01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:43.133
Chunky

985
01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:49.750
urine homeless men.
There's times by my buttons

986
01:05:51.630 --> 01:05:53.570
or sex with your sister.

987
01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:58.880
Grandmother walks in on you masturbating.

988
01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:01.490
Never have another orgasm.

989
01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.070
It's trying to play.
Would you rather?

990
01:06:10.330 --> 01:06:12.580
<v 15>Okay.
I'm assuming you've never played this before.</v>

991
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.030
So what happens is I present two scenarios

992
01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.400
<v 4>right down.</v>

993
01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:27.590
<v 15>Is that coming from your recording?
It's coming from,
um,
anyways,</v>

994
01:06:28.550 --> 01:06:32.000
what,
what happens is I present to you two scenarios.
Okay?

995
01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:36.170
And you have to pick one.
In other words,

996
01:06:36.171 --> 01:06:40.850
it's two things that are undesirable.
So have to pick one.
Yeah,
that's the game.

997
01:06:40.851 --> 01:06:44.930
It's just like,
it's just a logic game.
And then you explain why.

998
01:06:44.931 --> 01:06:49.040
So in other words,
what I said,
uh,
would you rather,
you know,

999
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:50.860
eat nothing but uh,

1000
01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:54.710
marshmallows or only get to sleep 30 minutes at a time?

1001
01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:57.440
Those are both things you don't want to do,
but you go,

1002
01:06:57.441 --> 01:07:01.280
I would take the marshmallows because I,
I could deal with eating that.

1003
01:07:01.281 --> 01:07:04.400
I have to get like you have to explain why you chose one or the other.
Okay.

1004
01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:09.020
So the first one that came in for you was Charo.

1005
01:07:09.350 --> 01:07:14.350
Would you rather eat nothing but vegetables and you can visit casinos as much as

1006
01:07:15.261 --> 01:07:18.380
you want or no casinos,

1007
01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:23.030
but you can eat what you really need to finish
that question.

1008
01:07:23.090 --> 01:07:28.090
Really eat only vegetables that visit casinos as much as I really 100% that's

1009
01:07:29.091 --> 01:07:33.530
how much that means to you is that I have no doubts,
no doubts.

1010
01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:38.090
That's what she would say.
Yeah,
absolutely.
That would mean breakfast,

1011
01:07:38.091 --> 01:07:40.130
lunch and dinner.
Nothing but the vegetables.

1012
01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:43.980
You would do it 100% I cannot believe this.
[inaudible] see,

1013
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I think that you're saying that,
but the reality would be too hard.

1014
01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:51.540
Not really nothing.
That's how much you love casino.
My Gosh.

1015
01:07:51.541 --> 01:07:54.950
I'm so they could do a stupid machines.
And you're so good at it.
Yeah,

1016
01:07:55.010 --> 01:07:59.780
I leave it on.
No,
no.
Nobody knows what it ain't even about,

1017
01:07:59.781 --> 01:08:04.190
about how good she is at taking these casinos to the cleaners.
Oh my gosh.

1018
01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:08.060
He does.
She cleans the,
uh,
she cleans them all right.
Yeah,
I cleaned,

1019
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:12.380
I cleaned my,
I cleaned my,
what she does is she's empty as I'm out.

1020
01:08:13.070 --> 01:08:16.280
Actually she fills them up with so much money,
they to be taken

1021
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:20.530
<v 0>out and a one,
what was that?</v>

1022
01:08:21.610 --> 01:08:26.610
<v 7>But the fact is your mother won't eat anything that is grown from the ground.</v>

1023
01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:31.450
And that includes,
I made strawberry shortcake for dinner last night for dessert.

1024
01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:33.430
She wouldn't even eat a strawberry.

1025
01:08:33.670 --> 01:08:37.360
Like your mother won't even touch a Brussel sprout even if it's covered in a

1026
01:08:37.361 --> 01:08:42.130
delicious sauce.
And she's super petite.
Tiny.
It's like 105 pounds.

1027
01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:45.190
Oh my gosh.
But all she eats is cookies,
sweets,

1028
01:08:46.150 --> 01:08:49.300
bread with butter.
It's unbelievable.

1029
01:08:49.301 --> 01:08:54.040
She's alive and like flying colors.
Yeah,
that's bananas.

1030
01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:58.780
But that's why I thought that was really crazy to ask her cause she loves,

1031
01:08:59.150 --> 01:09:01.250
<v 0>I know I thought to cause that's what I'm saying though,
the reality,</v>

1032
01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:03.020
I don't think she's facing the reality on that one.

1033
01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:06.290
It's just that she really does love casinos.
Right.
My mom,
by the way,

1034
01:09:06.291 --> 01:09:10.130
if you're thinking poker player,
just slots,
men,

1035
01:09:10.190 --> 01:09:14.590
just penny slots changing pennies.

1036
01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:18.340
Okay.
So God is,
what is the thrill though?
Cause hearing,
Ding,
Ding,
Ding,
Ding,
Ding.

1037
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:20.630
When you see a wind a little bit,

1038
01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:24.410
not because I never went a little bit of weight.
So when,
where's the payoff?

1039
01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:28.220
Number one,
I see machines that have been based on this is going to be,

1040
01:09:28.221 --> 01:09:30.110
do you ever get a payout?
Yes.

1041
01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:34.410
Well she gave me $1,000 to came back to the Rhombus thousand dollars.

1042
01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:38.610
When was that?
Could a year or so ago.

1043
01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:42.970
When was she goes a lot.
One was Clinton president.
Let me see.

1044
01:09:44.350 --> 01:09:48.760
It wasn't most excited seeing the office and it was at 1,001 payout.
Yes.

1045
01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:51.890
That's exciting.
How much were you betting on that?

1046
01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.620
Because my problem with you as somebody that doesn't do it a lot,

1047
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:57.780
cause I always think you bet too little.
No,
I have race my bed.

1048
01:09:59.810 --> 01:10:03.620
He says you used to last a dollars night.
I was working some casinos.

1049
01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:07.010
I think I told you.
And as I'm walking to my,
to the showroom,

1050
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:09.770
I walked by the high dollar slots.

1051
01:10:10.190 --> 01:10:15.050
So He's putting in a $20 thing and he'd spin spin spin and two out of the three

1052
01:10:15.051 --> 01:10:17.750
times I did that,
I won first time,

1053
01:10:17.751 --> 01:10:22.610
$300 the next time $700 and then the will the nice time I lost,

1054
01:10:22.611 --> 01:10:26.710
but so yeah.
Then where to sell $7 yeah,

1055
01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:31.910
I spent 60 but again,
after I did that,
I just my eye,
in other words,

1056
01:10:31.911 --> 01:10:35.990
I played for 30 seconds.
Do you guys want to go put some money to save?
You went,

1057
01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:39.000
yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
For me it's my new,
yeah.
Yeah.
I get a rash.

1058
01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:42.500
I'd have to have my own juice,
my,
my cigarette,

1059
01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:47.290
nice slot machine that is going to pay me.
I don't like people around,
by the way,

1060
01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:50.910
on this trip.
Okay.
I don't understand that.
She has not spoken.

1061
01:10:50.911 --> 01:10:52.180
Not There's no casinos in here,

1062
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:56.120
but usually I thought you'd like your evening cigarette and not when she's out

1063
01:10:56.121 --> 01:10:58.160
of town,
but at home.
Don't you have an evening?

1064
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:02.570
I haven't even,
I haven't even been thinking about it,

1065
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:05.030
but the interesting to me is we are no dad.

1066
01:11:05.031 --> 01:11:08.840
Would you rather go on all the cruises you want,

1067
01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:13.960
but it's only to Vietnam or you have to wear tight jeans and loose tee shirts

1068
01:11:15.991 --> 01:11:19.770
every day or you cruise wherever you want to.
People that don't know,

1069
01:11:19.771 --> 01:11:24.480
you have to understand a couple of things.
He's a Vietnam vet.
Uh,

1070
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:30.480
he hates everything,
like Asian cuisine,
all that.

1071
01:11:30.481 --> 01:11:31.770
And it's the whole world,

1072
01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:36.800
I think as a byproduct of being more there and also hates informal where only,

1073
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:44.570
yeah.
Hates him.
Hates them.
He hates wearing a shirt that's not collared.
Yeah.

1074
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:47.703
<v 15>Uh,</v>

1075
01:11:49.690 --> 01:11:52.840
tight jeans and loose tee shirts and cruise wherever I want.
Really?

1076
01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:57.900
You wear jeans every day?
Cruise or whatever I want.
Yeah.

1077
01:11:58.330 --> 01:12:02.950
Versus going to Vietnam.
I get that.
Get old pretty fast.
But he let me tell you.

1078
01:12:03.010 --> 01:12:06.640
I bet.
Yeah.
No,
I'll take the tight jeans and that.
Really?
Yeah.

1079
01:12:06.730 --> 01:12:09.940
You never wear jeans?
I know.
I don't wear jeans.

1080
01:12:09.941 --> 01:12:14.740
I do have my Khakis on right now.
I assistance they gave me,
uh,

1081
01:12:15.070 --> 01:12:20.050
genes for Christmas as a joke.
No,
they thought I ordered them for me.

1082
01:12:20.110 --> 01:12:24.790
Really Nice ones.
Really?
Yeah,
of course are nice.
Yeah,
they're very,

1083
01:12:24.791 --> 01:12:25.660
I'm saying like there's,

1084
01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:30.580
I think there's nice designer jeans that actually fit these had like,
like,

1085
01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:33.700
no,
I mean if I,
if I go,

1086
01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:39.370
if I go shooting next time I go clay pigeon shooting and I might wear them like,

1087
01:12:39.371 --> 01:12:40.430
really?
Yeah.

1088
01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:46.210
I saw you in a pair of jeans and black sneakers and I thought I looked really

1089
01:12:46.211 --> 01:12:49.440
good actually.
He looks great in that.
That's what I'm saying.

1090
01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:53.310
They look good on you.
Yeah,
but that's an easy,
that's an easy one for me really.

1091
01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:58.950
I think you would get so annoyed every day I go to cruise anywhere.

1092
01:12:59.171 --> 01:13:02.400
I want to
love

1093
01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:08.020
you have to wear it.
I know I can cruise wherever I want.

1094
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.600
Yeah.
And get tight jeans.

1095
01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:16.000
I don't know what that boxers and you'd have to ask me to help you pull up the

1096
01:13:16.001 --> 01:13:18.940
zipper.
That's true.
Yeah.
Charles,

1097
01:13:19.630 --> 01:13:24.100
would you rather be retarded or you have to drive on the freeway.

1098
01:13:28.810 --> 01:13:29.643
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1099
01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:34.680
<v 15>Tito sinking.
Really?
I can't,</v>

1100
01:13:34.690 --> 01:13:36.910
I can't,
I can't

1101
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:41.340
that people would feel sorry for me.

1102
01:13:41.341 --> 01:13:43.900
He's convinced that every car in the freeway,
first of all,

1103
01:13:45.190 --> 01:13:49.550
this happened one time.
We're coming back from the Jacksonville's.

1104
01:13:49.630 --> 01:13:54.250
We had the male clinic thing.
I,
I am.
I am.

1105
01:13:54.370 --> 01:13:58.390
I was.
I did.
I got frustrated.
So she's going to follow.

1106
01:13:58.630 --> 01:14:02.650
I'm following you following me.
Okay.
Oh boy.
She gets behind.

1107
01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:07.990
She gets by a truck and this is on 95 going south on a truck,

1108
01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.220
getting behind the truck.

1109
01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:14.010
It's 45 and a seven I think.
Safe.

1110
01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:17.050
She felt so he did.
I want to tell you what he did.

1111
01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:21.490
He pulled out his card.
So I said,
oh my God,
something happened to your father.

1112
01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:25.020
So I needed to,
when they get out and say,
well,
what happened at,
he

1113
01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:29.460
told me,
he made me shake.
I am here.

1114
01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:32.200
I'm in this breezeway for first time it scared to death.
Jesus.

1115
01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:33.710
I wanted a divorce rate right?

1116
01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:38.620
That moment I couldn't because I was in this breezeway.
Here we are 45 and a 70.

1117
01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:43.090
I said,
well then,
then Tom,
get in front of me and I have 4,500 follow you

1118
01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:49.300
to what?
How did you make this drive?
Uh,
he had to drive.

1119
01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.280
It's lower than I have to spend a little bit.

1120
01:14:51.281 --> 01:14:55.930
And how slow did you drive from Jacksonville?
All we were under weight.
We got,

1121
01:14:56.110 --> 01:14:58.960
I don't know how many thousand cars are on the expressway that day.

1122
01:14:59.590 --> 01:15:03.280
We got passed by every one of them.
Stayed in the right lane,

1123
01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:06.810
stay in the right lane,
and he went after me,
went up to 50 excuse me,

1124
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:09.130
drove 50 are you being serious?

1125
01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:13.330
It took you seven hours to get back and took us a long time.

1126
01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:15.160
You realize how slow that is.

1127
01:15:15.850 --> 01:15:20.850
<v 7>Your mother has a crippling fear of the freeway and you know that.</v>

1128
01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:25.600
She was like,
we were driving around our neighborhoods and and she's like,
Oh,

1129
01:15:25.601 --> 01:15:29.770
I'd love to live in California except that I can't take the freeway for those

1130
01:15:29.771 --> 01:15:34.150
outside of California,
a substitute highway for a freeway.

1131
01:15:34.890 --> 01:15:37.920
People think that's a,
I know.
You're like,
what is that same thing?

1132
01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:41.230
They call it a freeway out here.
Yeah,
but your mother was like,

1133
01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:44.200
this is an ideal place.
Everything's great.
Everything's perfect,

1134
01:15:44.230 --> 01:15:46.510
but I have to take a freeway.
I'm like,
well,

1135
01:15:46.511 --> 01:15:48.970
you can get over that rather be retarded.

1136
01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:55.060
<v 15>I saw every make and model of car,</v>

1137
01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:59.710
every truck and I asked him to ask me to forgive him when we got to now don't

1138
01:15:59.711 --> 01:16:01.910
you feel that's a little ridiculous that you should,

1139
01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:04.040
you should because it's such a,

1140
01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:08.380
a fear of this I cannot describe to you really don't mean it's horrendous.

1141
01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:12.740
You just scared when you're out there.
Really.
Your

1142
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:18.790
so different thought.
Well,
okay,
you're going to be retarded then.
That's fine.

1143
01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:24.600
Would you rather be retarded or you can only eat Asian food.

1144
01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:32.050
You're not retarded.
He wouldn't need a good one.
How do you define Asian food

1145
01:16:33.610 --> 01:16:38.170
worlds?
Like food from
China,

1146
01:16:39.070 --> 01:16:43.900
Cambodia,
Vietnam,
Singapore,
Korea.

1147
01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:46.060
Just you know,
the Asian world.

1148
01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:51.430
That's a tough one because there's some things in Asia that I could eat.

1149
01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:55.720
Like duck.
Yeah,
noodles,
right?

1150
01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:00.460
Sure.
So if I could have a selection of the menu,
yeah,

1151
01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:03.670
I would do the Asian food.
Okay.
And if,
if,

1152
01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:08.400
if you have to dictate what Asian food it is,
if somebody says you have GE,

1153
01:17:08.410 --> 01:17:12.950
whatever we're going to give you.
Yeah,
I'd go the retarded.
Really?
Really?

1154
01:17:13.190 --> 01:17:16.630
You'd be mentally retarded because I wouldn't want it.
No.
On.

1155
01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:22.270
I'm not going to eat dog.
Okay.
I'm not eating dog and Duck Ma.

1156
01:17:22.290 --> 01:17:25.340
That's another Vietnamese thing.
I'm not going to eat that.
Okay.

1157
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:29.570
There's some things that I just would never eat.
So you choose.

1158
01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:33.440
So if I have a choice of Asian food?
Yeah,

1159
01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:38.330
like nobody's going to give you a choice.
The question I asked.

1160
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:41.510
Okay,
so let's say there's no choice.
It's just whatever Asian food is given to,

1161
01:17:41.511 --> 01:17:46.130
you know,
I'd go retarded.
No,

1162
01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:49.190
I'm not eating dogs.
I love dogs too much.
Okay,
okay.

1163
01:17:52.230 --> 01:17:53.390
I mean in Korea,
yes.

1164
01:17:53.391 --> 01:17:56.210
One time I was there they said the street meat was dog eat it.

1165
01:17:56.211 --> 01:17:59.980
But it's not like he thinks it's on like it's a great,
nice run.
Yeah.
Okay.

1166
01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:03.890
That's cool.
Yeah.
I mean it's not like all Asian cultures eat dogs.
Yeah.

1167
01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:07.490
A lot of them do.
Okay.
I mean it's really prevalent in China.

1168
01:18:07.491 --> 01:18:11.330
Only parts of China he wants,
he has to make a selection on his foot.

1169
01:18:11.331 --> 01:18:13.600
Can you imagine what kind of punishment is that?

1170
01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:14.870
I got another good one for your mom.

1171
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:19.940
Would you rather sleep in a cold cold room?

1172
01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:24.820
Ac is on like 65 oh my gosh.
Are you can,

1173
01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:30.100
you can have all the sweets you want or you never have any sweets again,

1174
01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:34.670
but you can sleep in any temperature you like.
I like,
I know that's a good one.

1175
01:18:34.671 --> 01:18:36.290
This is from Christina.
Christina,

1176
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:40.790
she's good at this shit to be not that extreme.

1177
01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:43.010
Extremes are the fun when it's when it's good,

1178
01:18:43.130 --> 01:18:47.150
so it's like I never can you switch with something so you'd know suites,

1179
01:18:47.210 --> 01:18:50.720
you take temperature?
No,
you just be,

1180
01:18:50.721 --> 01:18:55.000
you just have to bundle up a lot in bed sweaters and blankets and the

1181
01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:58.910
temperature is 65 and I can put all the blankets I want.
I mean,
yeah,

1182
01:18:58.911 --> 01:19:01.020
you can put blankets on.
Yeah,
of course.
Okay.

1183
01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:05.460
If I can wrap up myself in 50 blankets I used to,
I keep that and give my switch,

1184
01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:08.750
but every time you walk in the room it's freezing.
That's fine.

1185
01:19:08.751 --> 01:19:10.350
But I am going to be prepared to yes.

1186
01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:15.360
Be in boots and socks and a blanket and a jacket and holy and good one for you.

1187
01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:19.970
Okay.
Would you rather dad,

1188
01:19:20.210 --> 01:19:23.720
you work in a gay bar as a server topless,

1189
01:19:23.721 --> 01:19:27.260
so you wear pants but no shirt and the guys come up to you and they're allowed

1190
01:19:27.261 --> 01:19:28.450
to sexually harass you.
Like they,

1191
01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:33.110
they pinch your nipples every time they walked by and they scratch your chest or

1192
01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:35.900
you're married to Nancy Pelosi for a year.

1193
01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:41.750
I'll take the gape gay bar thing.
Uh,
no problem.

1194
01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:44.960
Really.
Absolutely.
That's how much you can't stand her.

1195
01:19:46.890 --> 01:19:51.890
I just,
you know,
don't get me going on that path.
Okay.
The gay and gay,

1196
01:19:53.450 --> 01:19:54.970
I mean,
they're nice,
okay guys,

1197
01:19:59.530 --> 01:20:03.780
but every time they walk by
I could handle that.

1198
01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:09.210
I can handle that actually.
I think he's excited.
What it is.
Excellent too.

1199
01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:10.770
I don't know if I could a lot of attention.

1200
01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:14.880
I don't think I can handle the Nancy Polosi politics for a year.
For a year now.

1201
01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:21.200
What if the ratio is one month of Nancy Pelosi or a year in the gay bar?

1202
01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:26.610
I could do one month of Betsy below.
You could do that as a wife.

1203
01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:30.330
You have to wake up next to her.
You have to have breakfast.

1204
01:20:30.370 --> 01:20:33.240
Whether you have to have dinner with or you don't have to have a lunch with her,

1205
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:36.100
you have to have sex with her.
Okay.
Mom twice.

1206
01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:40.870
I can't imagine myself having sex.
She does have very,
you are,

1207
01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:47.620
she's been,
she does have,
she's got a nice set of lungs.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1208
01:20:47.670 --> 01:20:50.490
And she's had multiple face lifts and she's had some work done.

1209
01:20:50.610 --> 01:20:55.560
She's had some work done.
Uh,
I could prop back again.

1210
01:20:55.561 --> 01:20:58.440
I can try to win,
but win her over to my arguments,

1211
01:20:58.441 --> 01:21:00.270
which would be fruitless course.

1212
01:21:00.271 --> 01:21:03.700
Since I never went in the arguments with your mother,
let's say,

1213
01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:08.010
don't you take a mouse with ted?
I can probably handle a month when Nancy Pelosi,

1214
01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:11.350
that's going to cost him his marriage right now.
Yeah.

1215
01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:16.220
Do you know Nancy Polosi is?
Yes.
Do you think that's not the point,
right.

1216
01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:18.880
He will take care of that.
Huge.
She sounds it should

1217
01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:20.910
<v 7>B,
I wouldn't take any woman older than your mother,</v>

1218
01:21:20.911 --> 01:21:25.380
no matter what the answer is within the game.
As part of the game.
Yeah.
Well,

1219
01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:28.500
in the game,
what does he go with the gays?
They were so nice.
And the,

1220
01:21:28.501 --> 01:21:29.470
he loved to be pinching it.

1221
01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:31.200
<v 15>It's on horizon</v>

1222
01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:37.930
<v 7>one more for you.
Okay.
Would you rather have four penises on your forehead?</v>

1223
01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:42.670
Ah,
for 10 nipples for fingers.

1224
01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:46.670
I Don.
I cannot pick either one.
Yeah,

1225
01:21:46.730 --> 01:21:51.220
you have to for penis in my four zero little penises are hanging from your,

1226
01:21:51.330 --> 01:21:53.830
that has no possibility in four of them.
No.

1227
01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:58.450
All it is is is a little like I am a woman.
I know,

1228
01:21:58.451 --> 01:22:01.410
but they're just hanging from your forehead.
High boredom or what it meets.

1229
01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:04.090
One of your fingers is a nipple.
Every finger.

1230
01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:07.540
I mean your fire would be really excited to have 10 nipple fingertips.

1231
01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:10.960
Think about how hard it would be to do everyday things cause you don't have

1232
01:22:10.961 --> 01:22:13.620
fingers.
You have nipples.
Oh he stood the fingers.
Yeah.

1233
01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:17.800
You have used nipples on your hands.
Kind of cute.
It's kind of cute.

1234
01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:23.380
I kept the nipples.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1235
01:22:23.381 --> 01:22:26.200
I would do dicks dickheads right on my forehead.
Yeah.

1236
01:22:26.230 --> 01:22:28.180
I wear a hat like you got on right now and cover them.

1237
01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:31.240
Well I don't know if you're allowed to cover him in stipulate that.
I know,

1238
01:22:31.241 --> 01:22:34.030
but it comes up.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah,
that's a good point.

1239
01:22:34.930 --> 01:22:38.350
I think I would just keep it for a little decks on my forehead.
Ah,
yeah.

1240
01:22:38.351 --> 01:22:42.400
I would do dicks.
It'd be,
it'd be funny because I have to use my hands.
My point.

1241
01:22:42.430 --> 01:22:46.220
Yeah.
The hands are really important.
You took care of,
you need hands,
right?
Yeah.

1242
01:22:46.450 --> 01:22:50.740
Plus I just like make a living being like the the dick head girl on Instagram.

1243
01:22:50.770 --> 01:22:54.010
Yeah.
And I get like a million followers and maybe when you get really angry they

1244
01:22:54.011 --> 01:22:55.570
stand up or something.
Cool.
Yeah.

1245
01:22:56.420 --> 01:23:01.330
Tell your little seed faith with for penis hanging on my forehead.

1246
01:23:01.630 --> 01:23:05.920
That's not that bad.
It's a good conversation starter or you out of your mind.

1247
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:08.200
<v 15>Oh,
people would be like,
what's going on there?
And you have nothing.</v>

1248
01:23:08.201 --> 01:23:12.400
I have a penis on my forehead when I can do the same thing with my little things

1249
01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:17.490
and I have the same interest in conversation.
Definitely the,
the,

1250
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:21.400
the nipples in it was really,
yeah,
it kind of killed.
They might.

1251
01:23:21.401 --> 01:23:25.900
What would you choose?
Oh,
the nipples really well,
sure.
How come?

1252
01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:32.400
The thing is I see it as the nipples as fingers actually make doing so many

1253
01:23:34.931 --> 01:23:38.410
tasks,
almost impossible.
Whereas the penis on your forehead,

1254
01:23:38.530 --> 01:23:42.970
it doesn't keep you from doing anything.
It's just aesthetically awkward.
Right.

1255
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.721
In other words,

1256
01:23:43.721 --> 01:23:47.100
you still have your full range of everything you can do with your hand.

1257
01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:51.910
Hod that covers the Naples,
uh,
the peanuts.
That's a good question.

1258
01:23:52.650 --> 01:23:56.990
No,
I think they have to be out,
but they're just aesthetically weird.
No,

1259
01:23:57.100 --> 01:24:01.990
aesthetically monster.
Nowhere.
Why would you choose the nipples?
I think for pain.

1260
01:24:01.991 --> 01:24:04.360
This is from your forehead.
Just,

1261
01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:09.460
it's so an comprehensible that you wouldn't feel like going out in society to

1262
01:24:09.461 --> 01:24:12.650
begin with.
I only wouldn't care what you could do.
You Really,
oh,

1263
01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:16.240
cause you think people would be,
you'd be that much of an outcast and you match.

1264
01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:19.340
I think you would be filling your mind that you would,

1265
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:24.130
you would make the cover of ad magazine.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I do.

1266
01:24:24.490 --> 01:24:28.180
The only good thing I do will have your own TV show.
Yeah,
that's true.

1267
01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:31.210
Do you think they would discriminate against you?
Oh No.

1268
01:24:31.211 --> 01:24:33.280
They wouldn't discriminate against me.
They did.

1269
01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:37.840
You know they would and then you know what happens if some of them work and some

1270
01:24:37.841 --> 01:24:41.530
of them don't.
Okay.
Then you got a reel that's called the ups and downs.
Okay.

1271
01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:46.630
Close that down to anything.
But what if some of them go up and saw them?

1272
01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:49.420
Neither one works.
Yeah.
How do you know that?

1273
01:24:49.421 --> 01:24:54.400
Because he says that the same country and they're true.
He got so excited

1274
01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:57.620
<v 7>about his job,
the ups and the downs.
Okay.</v>

1275
01:24:59.730 --> 01:25:03.360
What'd they pee?
The DEX.
Could you pee out of your forehead decks?
No,

1276
01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:05.020
I don't think so.
Not In my mind.

1277
01:25:05.050 --> 01:25:06.960
Could you jerk off your forehead decks and picture?

1278
01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:10.230
I used to picture them like a growth almost,
you know?
Yes,
I did.

1279
01:25:10.450 --> 01:25:13.570
I didn't picture then is functional pieces,
but that's a,

1280
01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:15.250
that's a whole other level if it now,

1281
01:25:15.251 --> 01:25:20.100
cause I might choose finger nipples if they were Dixit peed and Jack Ejaculate,

1282
01:25:20.890 --> 01:25:21.370
you know,

1283
01:25:21.370 --> 01:25:24.770
because that's a way more debilitating than you'd have come in your eyes and pee

1284
01:25:24.771 --> 01:25:28.480
on her forehead.
And it's true.
It's a good point.
And what are their balls?

1285
01:25:28.510 --> 01:25:29.360
Tailwater sticks.

1286
01:25:29.410 --> 01:25:32.920
I really wish my parents had thought like you do right now and asked you about

1287
01:25:32.921 --> 01:25:36.940
that.
What about the balls so seriously?
There's no balls.
Oh,
okay.

1288
01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:41.200
<v 15>It's just too it.
You don't have a penis.</v>

1289
01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:45.170
Barely one during that time,

1290
01:25:45.550 --> 01:25:49.610
barely won some jokes for you.
Good luck jokes.

1291
01:25:52.090 --> 01:25:56.340
Revisiting the infamous a blonde jokes.
Oh my God.

1292
01:25:56.380 --> 01:25:59.140
I found a new page of them.
I think they've taken this one or two repeats,

1293
01:25:59.141 --> 01:26:03.650
but mostly knew this blew me away.
I knew how he would react.

1294
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:07.760
I was surprised at her reaction.
Really?
Yes.
I'm excited to hear these.

1295
01:26:08.190 --> 01:26:12.550
You do it for blonde throws a grenade at you?
Uh,
I don't know.

1296
01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:14.510
Pull the pin and throw it back.

1297
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:24.320
What do you call it when a blonde dyes their hair brunette.
I Dunno.

1298
01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:29.630
Artificial intelligence.
That's a good one.

1299
01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:34.430
Why did the blonde get fired from the banana plantation?

1300
01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:37.670
I give up because she threw out all the bent ones.

1301
01:26:39.710 --> 01:26:44.480
That's a good one.
I tell you one.
Sure.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.

1302
01:26:44.710 --> 01:26:47.530
<v 7>He's so excited.
They love these stupid jokes.</v>

1303
01:26:47.650 --> 01:26:50.050
Do you think that they're just simple people?
Why?

1304
01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:54.940
I know why your mother mother's laughing because I'm sure as a non native

1305
01:26:54.941 --> 01:26:58.390
English speaker like you can put two and two together and you can understand

1306
01:26:58.391 --> 01:27:01.570
those jokes.
Yeah,
it's a very elementary,
you know,

1307
01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:06.580
for a non native speaker for your dad,
it's just,
that's just as jam dude.
He just,

1308
01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:10.830
he loves stupid people jokes,
you know.
So this blog is sitting in it

1309
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:11.810
<v 15>bar in Chicago.</v>

1310
01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:16.520
I bet you Chicago is immaterial to the joke.
What do you think?

1311
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:20.710
Well he's told me this,
Joe Eddie told it on our show already.
Oh No.

1312
01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:25.770
Watching the five o'clock news and the guy sits down next to her.

1313
01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:27.140
I remember this.
Yeah.

1314
01:27:27.390 --> 01:27:32.010
Oh God says looking up to TV and there's a guy on the ledge of a building

1315
01:27:32.610 --> 01:27:36.240
getting ready to jog emails and the guy says to the woman,

1316
01:27:36.510 --> 01:27:40.650
I bet you he jumps.
And the woman says,
you're on.

1317
01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:41.970
I bet you he doesn't.

1318
01:27:42.930 --> 01:27:47.700
Well the guy jumped and the woman says,
well I guess I owe you a drink.

1319
01:27:48.270 --> 01:27:49.000
And he says,
sorry,

1320
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.710
I really can't take your money cause I saw it on the four o'clock news that he

1321
01:27:52.711 --> 01:27:55.880
jumped.
She says I saw it too,
but I thought he changed his mind.

1322
01:27:58.930 --> 01:28:02.200
That's pretty funny.
Can you tell me that one before?
Yeah,
I got another one.

1323
01:28:02.201 --> 01:28:05.980
If you want it.
Is it going to be one I've heard before?
Of course.

1324
01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:08.070
About the woman in the airplane going to London.
Yeah.

1325
01:28:08.071 --> 01:28:11.080
I mean you've already told me this at least 25 times.
Okay.

1326
01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:15.550
You have to find the middle then.
What do you call a smart blonde?

1327
01:28:17.170 --> 01:28:19.030
I give up a golden retriever.

1328
01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:24.760
I love,
I like,
how are you get I give up.
Yeah.

1329
01:28:25.530 --> 01:28:29.790
<v 7>Yeah,
that you just play.
You go along for the ride.
Yeah.
What?
What I do?
I give up.</v>

1330
01:28:29.791 --> 01:28:33.000
I don't know.
Searching.
He's like,
yeah,
you don't need to,
it's not a guessing.

1331
01:28:33.210 --> 01:28:37.860
<v 15>I think he tries on one of these.
The joke about the the Poli Sci captain?</v>

1332
01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:43.020
Yes.
Okay.
Yeah.
You probably want me to come up with some new jokes eventually.

1333
01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:46.740
It would be nice.
I'll work on that.
Um,

1334
01:28:47.550 --> 01:28:51.990
how do you make a blonde laugh on Saturday?
I give up.

1335
01:28:52.170 --> 01:28:56.910
Tell her a joke on Wednesday.
Yeah.
Like I tell you,
she gets to go.
How?

1336
01:28:57.780 --> 01:29:01.670
How you make,
how play along.
I give up.
Okay.

1337
01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:06.810
It's funny.
I have to like that one.
You liked that one?
Like that one.

1338
01:29:08.970 --> 01:29:10.440
I don't think we need to do

1339
01:29:10.460 --> 01:29:13.660
<v 0>play that.
Would you rather?
I think they already decided and they are retarded.</v>

1340
01:29:13.690 --> 01:29:14.920
That's what I get from this.

1341
01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:21.700
<v 15>That's fine.
You know what?
That is funny.
That is,</v>

1342
01:29:21.701 --> 01:29:23.650
why can't blondes count until 70?

1343
01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:29.660
I can't think of a reason because 69 is a bit of a mouthful.
Yeah.

1344
01:29:31.890 --> 01:29:34.910
You stay.
Mom wasn't getting no.
Your mom does it and I liked that one.

1345
01:29:35.170 --> 01:29:38.810
<v 7>Your mom has no idea what that no idea.
Like,
I don't know.</v>

1346
01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:42.670
No idea.
I got to high numbers.
Yeah.

1347
01:29:44.110 --> 01:29:45.850
<v 14>Um,
let's see.</v>

1348
01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:48.130
<v 0>I didn't,</v>

1349
01:29:48.130 --> 01:29:52.910
why did the blind stare at a frozen orange juice can for two hours?

1350
01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:54.450
<v 14>Yeah.</v>

1351
01:29:54.450 --> 01:29:57.630
<v 15>You know,
I,
I couldn't come up with an answer for that in a million years</v>

1352
01:29:59.130 --> 01:30:03.460
because it said concentrate.
Oh,

1353
01:30:03.461 --> 01:30:08.100
that's great.
Oh my God,
Arius.

1354
01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:15.000
That's actually funny.
That's really funny.

1355
01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:19.630
I like to use,

1356
01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:24.170
<v 7>I would laugh at that joke like I don't,
I don't know.
I didn't have full after.</v>

1357
01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:27.040
I can't imagine laughing out loud at that.

1358
01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:30.113
<v 14>Okay.</v>

1359
01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:31.110
<v 7>I mean,
seriously.</v>

1360
01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:34.530
I didn't think there were people who thought this shit was really fun to
setting.

1361
01:30:34.531 --> 01:30:39.360
To me.
Somebody would laugh out loud.
I know it's an lol for some people,

1362
01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:42.570
but some people like dad boner jokes do like this is just,

1363
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:48.480
this is like so silly jokes you would read on the back of a bubble gum for most

1364
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:49.383
it's worthless.

1365
01:30:49.770 --> 01:30:52.480
<v 0>Yeah.
You Go,
you kind of smirk at it like,
oh,</v>

1366
01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:54.620
<v 7>that's clever.
The concentrate joke about,</v>

1367
01:30:54.621 --> 01:30:59.390
that's a solid joke to laugh out loud that hard at it.
Yeah.

1368
01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:01.100
It's frustrating.
And then you think,

1369
01:31:01.101 --> 01:31:04.700
doesn't it make you wonder like when they come watch you perform,
like what?

1370
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:08.870
What are,
they never left this heart.
They've never left the card at anything,

1371
01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:13.130
but what are they thinking of your act if they think this shit's hilarious.
Yeah.

1372
01:31:13.210 --> 01:31:16.960
<v 0>Well they don't have at it.
They go,
what happens is I've,
I've learned about him.</v>

1373
01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:20.470
He gauges all,
he cares about his audience response.

1374
01:31:20.650 --> 01:31:23.770
He has no connection to what I'm doing.
Oh boy.
He just goes,

1375
01:31:23.771 --> 01:31:26.890
they really liked that are like,
wow,
you really had them going right.

1376
01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:31.600
He's entertained by the audience being in agreement.
He doesn't,
uh,
yeah,
I got it.

1377
01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:33.490
Wow.
Wow.
It's astounding.

1378
01:31:33.730 --> 01:31:38.290
And I think it's also very telling that his absolute favorite,
favorite,

1379
01:31:38.291 --> 01:31:43.090
favorite by far think of mine is my most undeveloped,

1380
01:31:43.091 --> 01:31:46.530
my elementary level stand up if you will.
Should I first thing right?

1381
01:31:46.590 --> 01:31:51.370
<v 7>Your first year.
First job.
First jokes.
Oh,
more?
Yeah.
Like you said please.</v>

1382
01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:56.440
<v 0>Yeah.
Uh,
I'm,
I'm basically a,
you know,
a new comic and um,</v>

1383
01:31:56.900 --> 01:32:01.840
every night I'm trying to make this stuff work.
It's very kind of laid out,
joke,

1384
01:32:01.841 --> 01:32:06.670
joke.
He's like,
that's,
that's my favorite.
I didn't have anything past that.

1385
01:32:06.671 --> 01:32:10.060
He's like,
yeah,
but you know,
on that first one,
that's all he ever talks about.

1386
01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:12.620
<v 7>Isn't it amazing?
Do you think that,</v>

1387
01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:17.660
do you think that we'll ever see Ellis who he is?
Do you know what I mean?
Like,

1388
01:32:17.661 --> 01:32:21.590
do you think that every,
every generation supposably yeah.

1389
01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:26.480
Gets better at this kind of stuff?
Emotions.
Oh,
right.
Acknowledging people,

1390
01:32:26.481 --> 01:32:31.430
but we'll have our faults.
But do you think that we'll be able to see our child,

1391
01:32:31.431 --> 01:32:36.100
like truly see and hear and much more than we were seeing then our parents?
Yeah.

1392
01:32:36.780 --> 01:32:39.950
Isn't that amazing?
It is,
but you wonder what do they think of you?

1393
01:32:39.951 --> 01:32:43.460
Like what did they think of us?
What do they think of anything?
It actually,

1394
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:48.500
I feel it inside of me when he's still brings that up.
That first album.

1395
01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:50.420
Yeah.
Like I'm still like,

1396
01:32:50.810 --> 01:32:54.420
because he doesn't appreciate the fact that you've evolved as a comic.
You're,

1397
01:32:54.421 --> 01:32:58.670
you're more complex now.
Remember lies.
He'll go,
you remember when on?
I'm like,

1398
01:32:58.671 --> 01:32:59.504
Dude,

1399
01:32:59.590 --> 01:33:03.250
<v 0>stop bringing that up.
All right.
Stop saying that when it was really funny.</v>

1400
01:33:03.970 --> 01:33:06.160
He says it like it,
like talking about one of these jokes,

1401
01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:11.590
the right side of that guy.
You,
you're really good dad.
I'm like,
okay.

1402
01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:16.030
Anyways,
yeah.
I just never changes.

1403
01:33:16.750 --> 01:33:19.150
And the other thing is that it's repeated.
In other words,

1404
01:33:19.930 --> 01:33:23.800
he'll point the same thing out to me a hundred times about that.
Yeah.

1405
01:33:25.150 --> 01:33:30.040
The next week he might go,
where are you going?
I'm going to a Tucson.
Hi.

1406
01:33:30.090 --> 01:33:34.390
Yeah,
good.
Yeah,
we're on that.
A Minnesota thing.
He did.

1407
01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:39.640
Or You said to the guy,
what's your name like?
Yeah.
You keep telling me that.

1408
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:42.370
<v 7>You keep saying that to me.
He's just like,</v>

1409
01:33:42.371 --> 01:33:45.280
he's living his own moments over and over.
You know?

1410
01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:47.810
Like he's only in his reality.
Like he can't,
that's what I'm saying.

1411
01:33:47.811 --> 01:33:51.740
He can't even see what's happening and changing.
It's so fun.

1412
01:33:51.741 --> 01:33:56.740
It's so fascinating.
Humans are so fascinating to me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Walk.
Yeah,

1413
01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:00.260
I love it.
That was best one surprise.

1414
01:34:00.270 --> 01:34:02.690
Blondes have Tgi F on their shoes.

1415
01:34:04.270 --> 01:34:08.540
<v 15>Yeah.
Yeah.
I didn't even know what to say.
EGF on their shoes.</v>

1416
01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:11.790
<v 0>Toes go in first.</v>

1417
01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:18.960
<v 15>Oh,
I love law jokes.</v>

1418
01:34:19.290 --> 01:34:22.110
What's the difference between a blonde and a mosquito?

1419
01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:24.153
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1420
01:34:25.050 --> 01:34:28.500
<v 15>I have no idea.
My mosquito stop sucking when you smack it.</v>

1421
01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:33.550
Your mom doesn't know what that means.
No clue.
None.
Oh,

1422
01:34:33.570 --> 01:34:35.820
these are ones I haven't heard.
I like all these.
Yeah,

1423
01:34:35.821 --> 01:34:38.850
I could see the joy in your face.
Oh,
this is,
this is really,

1424
01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:40.350
this has been a great trip going out here.

1425
01:34:41.410 --> 01:34:44.700
Just highlight of the highlight of the trip.
I know.

1426
01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:49.050
I've never seen somebody enjoy street jokes as much as you.
He loves him.
I know.

1427
01:34:49.051 --> 01:34:53.880
It's crazy.
Jokes.
Blonde jokes,
street jokes,
three jokes.
Yeah,
I do.
He loves them.

1428
01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:58.020
Yeah.
And then once he learned them,
he repeat them.
Repeat at repair and

1429
01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:05.310
another one and another one.
Um,
you know,
I'm offended by it.

1430
01:35:05.311 --> 01:35:09.530
Why does a blonde wear a tight skirt?
I don't know.

1431
01:35:09.710 --> 01:35:14.030
To keep her legs closed.
She got down.

1432
01:35:14.031 --> 01:35:17.570
She heard about the two blondes that driving down I 75.
Oh my God.

1433
01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:21.860
He's telling me that 100 times.
What's the punchline?

1434
01:35:23.050 --> 01:35:24.660
I'll just let it,
he's gonna say it anyways.

1435
01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:28.620
<v 7>I'm offended.
This is a very blonde phobic.
How offended are you?</v>

1436
01:35:29.070 --> 01:35:32.880
Very deeply.
I wish you guys would respect my hair color.
Yeah,

1437
01:35:33.790 --> 01:35:37.860
because you're thinking about filing suit.
I like to,
Oh,
how about blogging?

1438
01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:40.650
I like to block my feelings.
I like to tweet about it.

1439
01:35:40.651 --> 01:35:44.520
I like to demand that your dad get fired from his job for laughing at these

1440
01:35:44.521 --> 01:35:48.870
offensive jokes.
I'm very affinity.
That's very progressive of dare you.

1441
01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:54.020
How dare you not agree with me and my point of view and stereotype is blonds

1442
01:35:54.631 --> 01:35:56.150
like that Dario

1443
01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:01.710
<v 15>and they saw a sign that said clean restrooms head but time they got to Miami.</v>

1444
01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:03.000
They clean hundred and 50.

1445
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:07.863
<v 11>Yeah,</v>

1446
01:36:10.370 --> 01:36:12.100
<v 15>I will put,
um,</v>

1447
01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:17.430
what does it call when a blonde blows breaking is another blonde here.

1448
01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:21.630
<v 11>I give up wind tunnel.</v>

1449
01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:26.420
<v 15>I'm not supposed to say that.
I know.
I don't know.
See how you he goes,</v>

1450
01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:28.210
I'm not supposed to say that.
I know.
I don't know.

1451
01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:30.400
<v 7>Why would that be a joke?</v>

1452
01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:34.330
What's it called when the blonde blows into their blends here?
Wind tunnel.
Yup.

1453
01:36:34.450 --> 01:36:38.650
That's the punchline.
You don't ask for the punch.
We'll also,

1454
01:36:38.710 --> 01:36:39.790
where's the punchline there?

1455
01:36:41.290 --> 01:36:45.940
Now it's an anchoring me cause like I keep picturing my dad.

1456
01:36:45.941 --> 01:36:46.840
Those were my dad.
I'd be,

1457
01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:51.040
I'd be infuriated too because they hear that you're a comedian.
Data transfer.

1458
01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:54.073
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1459
01:36:58.030 --> 01:37:01.300
<v 15>Oh my gosh.
I love these jokes.
I know.
You really do.</v>

1460
01:37:04.690 --> 01:37:06.970
Why is it good to have a blonde passenger in your car?

1461
01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:13.680
I have no idea.
You can park in the handicap.
The mind doesn't get it.

1462
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.850
I haven't heard these blinds.
All six foot grass.
I know.
I Google them.

1463
01:37:17.851 --> 01:37:19.350
Some things are all good stuff.

1464
01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:25.050
What are the worst six years and a blondes life?
I don't know.

1465
01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:26.033
Third Grade.

1466
01:37:31.690 --> 01:37:36.630
I'm exhausted.
I'm tired.
He's never laugh at anything.

1467
01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:38.440
Any comedian like

1468
01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:47.340
blondes not be given coffee breaks.
I give up.
It takes too long to retrain them.

1469
01:37:49.610 --> 01:37:52.750
I like that one.
Right.
Good job

1470
01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:58.860
making your five names.
I can't believe this one.

1471
01:37:59.470 --> 01:38:04.230
Is this kind of stuff go on forever and know it's the reaction so bad.

1472
01:38:04.231 --> 01:38:07.710
You get a blonde to marry you.
I don't know.
I'm tell her she's pregnant,

1473
01:38:12.410 --> 01:38:16.110
boy.
All right.
I think that's enough,
right?
I said No.
That's a good amount

1474
01:38:18.010 --> 01:38:19.980
I wanted to tell you about.
Those are good job.

1475
01:38:20.010 --> 01:38:21.900
I wanted to tell you about this tape.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1476
01:38:22.590 --> 01:38:26.730
He has been the best study we had done.
We had a lot of fun with you guys.

1477
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:32.030
You guys went overboard and loft,
generosity,
kindness.

1478
01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:34.230
It was a German

1479
01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:39.150
<v 0>of the visit is when we went to get coffee with them at the country club and</v>

1480
01:38:39.151 --> 01:38:42.600
then um,
we get the people that don't know the country called means the mall.

1481
01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:43.810
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,

1482
01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:49.160
and then your mom went into lengthy detail about her urethra opening surgery.

1483
01:38:51.810 --> 01:38:52.740
That was terrible.

1484
01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:57.810
Last time it was malpractice medical malpractice suits and deaths randomly.

1485
01:38:57.811 --> 01:39:02.580
They would just drop them on you this time.
It was,
she had 20 years,

1486
01:39:02.581 --> 01:39:06.900
30 years or 40 years ago.
She was like cheating a lot and then they're like,

1487
01:39:06.901 --> 01:39:08.520
we're just going to open your urethra more.

1488
01:39:09.930 --> 01:39:12.030
And the doctor scheduled it without examining.

1489
01:39:12.630 --> 01:39:16.590
It's like such a gross long story.

1490
01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:18.180
You don't mind thing that was funny was that,

1491
01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:22.620
see to me it's very normal that somebody does what she's doing now,

1492
01:39:22.621 --> 01:39:26.590
which is telling you their feelings about how much they appreciate it and you're

1493
01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:31.120
like so uncomfortable.
She texted us last night like I want to,
I cracked.

1494
01:39:31.170 --> 01:39:33.270
I can't even repeat the text back to you because I couldn't read it.

1495
01:39:33.630 --> 01:39:38.460
Whenever somebody expresses their feelings to me,
I get so uncomfortable.

1496
01:39:38.490 --> 01:39:42.390
It's just not in my family.
If you,
if you express your feelings,

1497
01:39:42.391 --> 01:39:45.240
it's a sign of weakness and you will be ridiculed.
So funny to me.

1498
01:39:45.241 --> 01:39:48.450
So nobody would say like,
thanks for taking care of us.
It was a blast.

1499
01:39:48.810 --> 01:39:53.340
Are you crazy?
Latin culture,
it's about over selling that you don't just go,

1500
01:39:53.670 --> 01:39:58.380
thanks for showing me a good time.
You have to go into the detail about,
you know,

1501
01:39:58.470 --> 01:39:58.861
all,

1502
01:39:58.861 --> 01:40:02.500
like you remember the things and like how that made you feel and I don't know.

1503
01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:07.770
In our house it's,
thank you.
Okay,
thanks.
Okay.
I gotta go like you don't,

1504
01:40:07.771 --> 01:40:10.020
you just say thank you once and then that's it.
Or You,

1505
01:40:10.021 --> 01:40:14.070
maybe you send a card so that you don't have to actually say it.
But for me,

1506
01:40:14.071 --> 01:40:15.720
the expression of her feelings,

1507
01:40:15.721 --> 01:40:18.710
like what she say goodbye to me last night and she was telling me all this stuff

1508
01:40:18.711 --> 01:40:23.100
like I couldn't,
I couldn't get away fast so far.
I can't get away fast enough.

1509
01:40:23.190 --> 01:40:24.870
Last night when they left,
Oh my God,

1510
01:40:24.871 --> 01:40:29.700
I got a big speech about their gratitude,
about what a great trip.

1511
01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:35.360
Then they both called from the hotel like an hour later to say it again.

1512
01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:38.360
Oh boy.
Then attacks.

1513
01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:42.000
Then I woke up to a new text message and then they called me again this morning

1514
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:45.660
in addition to just saying it to like,
yeah,
it's just,

1515
01:40:45.930 --> 01:40:48.480
that would never happen in my family.
Never.
But the thing is,

1516
01:40:48.481 --> 01:40:52.140
if somebody doesn't say that it's supposed to mean that they really didn't have

1517
01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:56.410
a good time.
So in your family,
if they don't go over the overboard,

1518
01:40:56.411 --> 01:40:59.240
it means it was just like an okay trip flavor.

1519
01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:04.540
Oh yeah.
That's a lot.
It's a lot of pressure sending about food.

1520
01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:08.590
Like if yes,
if they try it and they go and you go,
how is it?
And somebody goes,

1521
01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:11.320
it's good.
That means this isn't good.

1522
01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:15.210
Because if it's really good,
you would go on and on.
You know,

1523
01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:17.710
like they did about the restaurant.

1524
01:41:17.730 --> 01:41:19.180
You remember how many times they talked about their leg.

1525
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:22.030
So your dad didn't like the dinner I made last night.
He did like it.

1526
01:41:22.090 --> 01:41:25.600
He did like it.
He didn't go overboard,

1527
01:41:25.601 --> 01:41:29.150
but he did like it because he talked about it.
Um,
even when we were,
well,

1528
01:41:29.151 --> 01:41:32.980
I hate it.
That's all I care about it.
He must've been hungry.
Yeah.

1529
01:41:34.290 --> 01:41:38.380
It's not as favorite though.
He likes like steak.
I Made Shrimp Pasta.

1530
01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:42.280
That was good.
I liked it a lot.
I liked it.
It's one of our favorites.
But yeah,

1531
01:41:42.281 --> 01:41:46.150
the feelings.
I can't,
I don't like it.
Like I liked doing nice things for people,

1532
01:41:46.151 --> 01:41:49.750
but I don't like to hear the thank you.
It's,
I don't like it'd be a bit much.

1533
01:41:50.290 --> 01:41:51.940
It makes me very uncomfortable

1534
01:41:52.590 --> 01:41:57.260
<v 15>dairy.
Yeah.
I absolutely can find words to thank you for these moments.</v>

1535
01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.890
And Ellis,
is it that the only,

1536
01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:05.770
the only sadness that I cannot make him love me?
Yeah.

1537
01:42:06.020 --> 01:42:09.800
I want him to kiss me to heartbeat,
you know?
Oh,
just takes time though.
Yeah.

1538
01:42:09.801 --> 01:42:14.330
But it was here for six days.
What I really enjoy was all the kisses I got.

1539
01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:16.210
You guys went overboard.
Yeah.

1540
01:42:16.580 --> 01:42:20.570
All the kisses and hugs and love I got from Ellis was really,

1541
01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:22.730
really nice that I was version of

1542
01:42:22.850 --> 01:42:25.790
<v 0>being like the underwater Champsi he was trying to jab,
Jabber with it.</v>

1543
01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:29.770
You're saying that you and I repeat the same patterns that your parents saying

1544
01:42:29.771 --> 01:42:33.890
like,
Oh,
let's get me a lot of hugs and kisses.
Oh my God.
So funny.

1545
01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:39.400
Last time you were here we talked about how there's a whole segment of the of

1546
01:42:41.061 --> 01:42:45.740
the population is non-binary.
Do you remember that?
That is not what non binary.

1547
01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:49.610
I think we should revisit this later.
Let's take a break.

1548
01:42:50.570 --> 01:42:54.920
I love it though.
I love listening to them.
I laughed at them all week.

1549
01:42:54.921 --> 01:42:59.320
They were here.
I was finding they're so funny.
Uh,
Vincent Donoff,

1550
01:42:59.330 --> 01:43:04.220
Rio Batman,
shit like that.
Freeze.
Good guy.

1551
01:43:05.390 --> 01:43:08.420
Um,
yeah,
this is a here,
let me do this.

1552
01:43:08.450 --> 01:43:13.100
This is something that maybe will cleanse the palate and then we can wrap up the

1553
01:43:13.101 --> 01:43:17.900
show.
Okay.
Fuck my triple d slot wife.
There you go.
Of course,
if we can.

1554
01:43:17.901 --> 01:43:22.790
I forgot that.
Sorry.
I get the old trumpet out today.
Oh boy.

1555
01:43:29.370 --> 01:43:33.630
This guy can play the trumpet like you wouldn't believe.

1556
01:43:41.770 --> 01:43:44.970
Oh my goodness.
He's farting into his trumpet.

1557
01:43:45.630 --> 01:43:49.740
That's incredible.
Have we found the new king asked for it?
I don't know.

1558
01:43:49.741 --> 01:43:52.780
But this guy,
I mean,
he's got a cool,
can't trying to tell you something when I,

1559
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:57.230
I know when you discover something big on your mom's house,
you feel it.
Yeah.

1560
01:43:57.470 --> 01:44:00.290
Like when we discovered king ass rapper,
that was a big fine.

1561
01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:05.060
There's been a few of those.
Yeah.
This feels special.
It does.

1562
01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:05.841
I mean,

1563
01:44:05.841 --> 01:44:09.890
I like that he's wearing a lab coat and a wig and he needs to get rid of it.

1564
01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:13.610
To me,
he doesn't need those theatrically.
Oh.
I think it dresses it up.

1565
01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:19.040
It becomes more of a performance because he's,
he's just ted,
you know,
when he's,

1566
01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:21.380
when he's wearing his regular clothes and now he's this,

1567
01:44:21.381 --> 01:44:25.100
but trumpet master doctor,
Dr. Trump.
Anyway.
Yeah.
That's pretty neat.

1568
01:44:31.340 --> 01:44:32.173
<v 19>Wow.</v>

1569
01:44:39.100 --> 01:44:39.820
<v 0>Focus.</v>

1570
01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:40.653
<v 19>Yeah.</v>

1571
01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:48.180
<v 0>You really got to put that up on there.
Tight.
Yeah.
Even just to do your mouth,</v>

1572
01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:50.880
it's very hard to blow a trumpet,
actually.
Yeah.
That's a really,

1573
01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:52.800
that's a real talent.
This guy.

1574
01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:56.040
I hope there are more hope we get to see more from doctor,

1575
01:44:56.041 --> 01:45:00.090
but trumpet Dr. But trumpet.
Right.
Um,
how,

1576
01:45:00.091 --> 01:45:05.070
what a talent that's a gene.
Um,
anything else?

1577
01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:10.530
No,
I,
uh,
no,
no.
We've already done our dates.
Yeah.
So that's,
that's in the past.

1578
01:45:11.340 --> 01:45:13.320
There you go.
Thank you guys for listening.

1579
01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:20.010
I love you John.
See Gene.
Uh,
we'll see you next week.
Bye guys.

1580
01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:23.633
<v 1>This is</v>

1581
01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:02.833
<v 4>jazz.</v>

1582
01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:08.370
I can't imagine what the enthusiasm was about.

1583
01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:33.840
[inaudible]

1584
01:48:26.490 --> 01:48:27.323
<v 14>ew.</v>

1585
01:48:54.650 --> 01:48:58.880
<v 4>Yeah.
That's</v>

1586
01:49:01.610 --> 01:49:06.540
the most disturbing dad.
Yeah.
