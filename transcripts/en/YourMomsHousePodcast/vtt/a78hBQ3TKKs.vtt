<v 0>mother fucking on master.</v>

6
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.340
I got some,
a huge announcements.
Really?
Yeah.
For the tour.

7
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.500
First of all,
everybody who has come out so far,
we did two weekends so far.

8
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.570
San Francisco,
San Diego and they were bananas.
Amazing crowds.

9
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.480
I mean to call it the Paulien by tour.
Well not the next one.
That'll probably be,

10
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.130
I mean this year I'm announcing that I'm poly.

11
00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:11.710
I think next year I'll announce it.
I'm also bisexual.
Um,

12
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.450
yeah.
But people have been just unbelievable.

13
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.250
So I just want to say thank you everybody that came out to those shows and let

14
00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:21.920
you know.
Here is where we're adding,

15
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.480
we're doing a second show at the John Lyman Center for the Performing Arts in

16
00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:29.110
new haven,
Connecticut,

17
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.640

We are adding a fourth show at the Moore Theater in Seattle,
Washington.

20
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.960
And here is the big one that I,
I can't believe this came together.

21
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.260
So the Chicago theater sold out two shows in April and we couldn't add any more

22
00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:54.560
that weekend because of the other shows around it.

23
00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.310
So I'm coming back to Chicago June 2nd to do a third show at the Chicago

24
00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:05.720
theater.

Wow.
And there it is.
Jean,

76
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.120
what's going to happen?
We got our business out of the way.

77
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.470
It's going to be show time.
Are you ready to get into this?

78
00:05:34.471 --> 00:05:35.580
Are you ready to do this show?

79
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.090
I'm a little nervous because you've already told me that you're fond of one of

80
00:05:39.091 --> 00:05:43.890
the gentlemen.
Oh,
this isn't that good to know.
This is really good,
but yes,

81
00:05:43.891 --> 00:05:46.560
there's a lot of good stuff today.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm scared.

82
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.930
Let's get this party started.
Sure.

83
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.970
<v 4>Bible.
But I wanted to make this video.</v>

84
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.510
I want to confess drawn to domestic violence and the seriousness of it.

85
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.390
I've been with my wife for 19 years.

86
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.920
I believe in beating women.
I believe him.

87
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.200
I have beat my wife in the past several times and I'm serious.
I'm very serious.

88
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.210
<v 5>Oh,
hi Auntie.
Don't bring anyone loving to them.</v>

89
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.190
<v 1>Well,
welcome.
Welcome to your mom's house</v>

90
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.160
and
Christina.

91
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:49.583
Hmm.

92
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.570
<v 6>What do you think you see a trend forming in our clip choices?
What kind of guy?</v>

93
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.860
What kind of guy would you describe him as?
Just cool guys.
Guys who love women.

94
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.720
Yeah.
Pro Ladies.
This is,
he's so sincere.

95
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.250
Yeah,
he is.
I actually think he's a pretty nice guy.
Yeah,
that's the thing.

96
00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:29.180
It's confusing cause he does come off as a really swell guy and then he dropped

97
00:07:29.181 --> 00:07:32.450
that bomb and he just,
he just has a different angle,
you know?

98
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.740
I don't understand why everyone was a fucking stupid idiot.
You know what I mean?

99
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.320
Yeah.
So really descended into a cool lane,
but you know what's,
what's,

100
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:46.170
what is scarier?
The guy who's yelling stuff like that guy.
Yeah.

101
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:51.430
Or a cool,
calm and collected guy who was like,
you've got a beat.
A woman I have.

102
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:55.770
Right,
right,
right.
I see your point.
Which one's more serial?

103
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.250
Serial killery.
I mean definitely the cool,

104
00:07:58.251 --> 00:08:01.640
calm guy they call this is more terrifying because he didn't pass for a regular

105
00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:04.790
human.
I mean he's got,
let's see what else.

106
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.230
I think he's got some other things to say.

107
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:11.250
<v 4>Sitting in my backyard.
I'm reading my Bible,
but I want it to make this video.</v>

108
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.720
I want to confess regarding domestic violence of the seriousness of it.

109
00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.700
I've been with my wife for 19 years,

110
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.200
I believe in beating women.
Yeah.
I believe in,

111
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:30.480
I have beat my wife for the past several times and I'm serious.
I'm very serious.

112
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:31.530
Um,

113
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:36.390
I believe there comes a time when you have to just beat her,

114
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:41.130
especially when she hits you and cusses you out and get out of place.

115
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.820
This is how we had in the past.

116
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.460
We used to drink and club back in the day when we wasn't,

117
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.140
so we may get into a physical altercation.
Right.
When she hit me,

118
00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.650
she was about one 35 then that was about two 50.

119
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.680
I would just sit there and crack up at it

120
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.840
and laugh and just said,
what are you doing?
Well,

121
00:09:03.841 --> 00:09:07.560
women are not scared of us because they are,
they were came from us.

122
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.180
They're not scared of us.
So they five,
three woman was challenges six,
seven,

123
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:16.650
a man because of the man that's in her.
But,
um,
the way I beat her,

124
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:21.510
I literally would just ignore her.
The fuck no her,
she'll jump on my back.

125
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:22.650
I just laugh.

126
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.710
<v 3>Okay.
Wow.
It sounds like these two are a volatile couple to begin with.
Yeah.</v>

127
00:09:27.711 --> 00:09:31.060
And he's all,
I mean he's,
he's going over the Bible right now.
It's in,

128
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:34.310
it is in the Bible.
He doesn't usually,
what prompts me,
it gets me in the mood,

129
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:38.540
you know,
it was,
um,
to me,
whenever I go,

130
00:09:38.541 --> 00:09:41.840
like I'm going to read the Bible,
I'll think about when I beat women to write,

131
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.080
he'd,
they do have all kinds of crazy shit like that in the Bible though.

132
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.260
The Bible does have wild shit.
Yeah.
So this guy is just reading.

133
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:53.180
He's just doing what he's told.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's doing what he's told.
Um,

134
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.890
how much does he weigh?
He said two 50 and she was one one 35.
Yeah.

135
00:09:57.891 --> 00:10:02.600
That's not a fair fight.
Yeah.
But now he said,
he said like,
oh,

136
00:10:02.601 --> 00:10:06.680
what I do is I will laugh at her and I'll ignore her and that's how I beat her.

137
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.580
Oh,
sure.
Yeah.
I think he was trying to make a point.

138
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:14.360
Like you can beat someone emotionally.
Yeah.

139
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:17.210
You can emotionally abuse somebody in when,
which is fun too,

140
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.980
which is really all key ingredients to a great marriage.

141
00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:26.300
<v 4>Awesome.
What are you getting out of punching a woman in the face?
Right.</v>

142
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.310
It's more,

143
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:32.980
it's more of a victory when you beat her the right way.

144
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.540
God still wants to come after you hard and once a fight too.
This is what you do.

145
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.410
Get method.
I'm talking to men and women.

146
00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.650
If you're in the heat of battle,
if you want to beat her,

147
00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:49.470
both of you just get Mecca because if you get naked Mecca,

148
00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:53.460
you can't stay mad that long.
Looking at your wife and man's beauty,

149
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:57.520
there's a way to beat your wife.
And I'm not talking about physically,

150
00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.140
I'm talking about psychologically,

151
00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.860
<v 3>uh,</v>

152
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:06.620
a how often and be honest.
Yeah.
Do you want to hit me?

153
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:10.940
Not Often.
No.
No.
Come on.
There are times I really make you mad.

154
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:16.080
No.
Nine when you really don't like me.
Uh,
never.
No,
no.
Women are stupid.
Yeah.

155
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:21.000
Yeah.
Thanks for introducing that.
Mean that whole thing.
Because now,
uh,

156
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.460
in my comments and all my Twitter and stuff,
it'll be like a great show.

157
00:11:25.461 --> 00:11:30.300
Christine,
you dumb bitch come in to see in Denver you stupid cotton like,

158
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.760
oh.
Oh Lisa,

159
00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.220
<v 4>it's so hard to meet a girl just to fucking fuck bro.</v>

160
00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.450
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
Christine,
you stupid bitch.
Yeah.</v>

161
00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.750
That's a fun new lane.
Okay.

162
00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.360
<v 4>A lot of women out there fully fucking full of shit and it's stupid.</v>

163
00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:49.150
<v 3>Yeah.
Says Einstein.
Do you like that this guy's done his research?</v>

164
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:54.130
I think that pastor actually has good intentions,
but he,
uh,
he uses

165
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:58.900
<v 0>phrases like there's a way to beat your woman.
Right?
So he meant to say like,</v>

166
00:11:58.901 --> 00:12:02.950
there's a way to deal with anger.
Correct.
Don't be physical,

167
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.480
like keep composed and maybe,
you know,
walk away.

168
00:12:07.481 --> 00:12:09.820
But he said there's a way to beat your woman.

169
00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.420
<v 3>Yeah.
Right.</v>

170
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.960
I see you're saying he's saying beat her as in when the argument still sounds

171
00:12:14.961 --> 00:12:17.680
really aggressive,
but he still wants to hurt her,
which is nice.

172
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:22.010
Which is like the point and your spouse want her to emotionally fall apart.

173
00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:22.873
And that's how you it.

174
00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.680
Because that's really the key to a good marriage is when you want to destroy

175
00:12:27.681 --> 00:12:30.830
that other person.
Right.
Of course you're fighting or just

176
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:34.550
<v 0>shaming them.
And that's how we do.
Yes.</v>

177
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:38.370
<v 3>That's how you and I am staying for advice.
You know,
you don't like it.
Delete me.</v>

178
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:42.120
Bang.
I don't give a fuck.
There you go.
That my boyfriend like your boyfriend Ted.

179
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.110
Cause you've been getting a lot of those.
Oh my God.
It's just uh,
it's,
it's fun.

180
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.190
It is.
Hey Hitler,
that's a neat one.
Obviously always,
always.

181
00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:54.160
And now being called the dumb bitch is really special.
Hitler,

182
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.470
when you walk on stage,
it's still a really cool thing to hear.
There's a Hitler.

183
00:12:58.471 --> 00:13:01.530
I'm like,
cool,
because there's still people that don't know.

184
00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.760
Of course you're the comedy store to Tuesday night packed main room.

185
00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:11.700
Yeah.
And then somebody just as the applause dies goes,
Hey Hitler,
dude,

186
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:16.410
what are you doing?
Well now I'm going to get Christine,
you dumb bitch.
I Dunno.

187
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.270
Make me dinner.
You stupid bitch.

188
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:25.230
<v 0>We have to get into it.
Yeah.
Look,
we have to get into it.
First of all.
Um,</v>

189
00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:27.600
I love it here and I just wanted to say that,

190
00:13:27.601 --> 00:13:29.220
but I wanted to point something out.

191
00:13:29.221 --> 00:13:32.940
It's not just that I love it here and you love it here.
The fans love it here.

192
00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.370
I have never seen anything like this.

193
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:40.970
We literally got 100% positive feedback on the new set.

194
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:46.290
That was something that I didn't expect.
Um,
so yeah,

195
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.760
I'm glad that everybody feels like it's a home run.
Yup.
And that everybody wants

196
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.100
<v 3>everything to stay the same and people love change.</v>

197
00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:58.120
If it's one thing we know about humans as they adapt really well to new things.

198
00:13:58.121 --> 00:14:01.330
Yes.
I'm just so surprised to how much love we been getting on the set.

199
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:06.360
<v 0>Absolutely.
Yeah.
People really,
you know,
yeah.
They,
they,</v>

200
00:14:06.361 --> 00:14:08.880
they,
they're just thrilled with what we've done.

201
00:14:08.881 --> 00:14:12.270
So I'm happy that they're happy and,
um,

202
00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:18.290
I want to point out a couple things though.
One thing,
uh,

203
00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.620
as somebody pointed out was that,
uh,
they thought I didn't control the,

204
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.950
the sound anymore.
That's false.
Got that wrong.

205
00:14:25.951 --> 00:14:30.090
I have a scooter to my right that you might not be able to see.
Yeah.

206
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:34.710
But I still play all the sound drops,
uh,
myself,

207
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:39.480
they're all right here.
So yeah.
Secondly,
yeah,

208
00:14:39.481 --> 00:14:43.680
there are some things that have changed and,
um,

209
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:47.940
that's just the way it goes.
You know,
one of the,
uh,

210
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.070
one of the things that happened was that people were sending in comments and I

211
00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:57.071
asked our great production staff here to pool with some of the,

212
00:14:57.411 --> 00:14:59.420
um,
comments about the new set.

213
00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:01.540
<v 3>Great.
I'd love to hear like,
you know,</v>

214
00:15:01.541 --> 00:15:06.280
I feel good because it just reinforces that we've made good decisions and that

215
00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.870
the audience is on our side.

216
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.750
<v 0>Oh,
it feels good to read.
Well,
here's some of the ones you want to hear.</v>

217
00:15:10.751 --> 00:15:12.170
Some of them love to hear it.
All right.

218
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:17.180
My reaction to this new studio is the same as the decapitated German shepherds

219
00:15:17.181 --> 00:15:21.510
reaction.
Okay.
Positive.
Yeah,
he smiles.
Yeah,

220
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:22.603
go ahead.

221
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:27.440
This set is somewhat both a Mcdonald's and a 1980s finished basement.

222
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.943
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

223
00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.810
<v 0>It looks like a Chinese Communist Party boardroom.</v>

224
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:37.280
[inaudible] studio looks like a court room.
A Mcdonald's.

225
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.140
That's good.
Okay.

226
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.100
The new studio looks like a library that sells VHS tapes.

227
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:49.010
I think you mean lie berry?
Definitely a green screen behind Tom.

228
00:15:49.011 --> 00:15:50.990
This step might actually be a joke.
I hope it is.

229
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.780
I also got a lot of green screen messages.

230
00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.640
Why are you in front of a green screen?
Why is that?

231
00:15:55.641 --> 00:15:57.710
They don't believe the dog is real,
but I dunno.
I Dunno.

232
00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:01.550
I think it was like the lack of shadows or something.
It's not a green screen,

233
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.970
but here.
All right,
let's,
let's just go straight down.
Tell,

234
00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:09.200
tell people clean what happened.
Oh yeah.
So we're going to come over here.

235
00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:12.020
We're going to build this set.
And um,
you know,

236
00:16:12.021 --> 00:16:13.910
all of our agents and stuff know about it.

237
00:16:13.911 --> 00:16:18.890
So I get this call a few months ago and one of my agents goes,

238
00:16:18.891 --> 00:16:23.480
hey,
how do you feel about working with Mcdonald's?

239
00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.900
And I said like,
I don't feel one way or the other about it.
Honestly,

240
00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.530
I love Mcdonald's pride.
I mean,
it's great,
but I mean,
at the time I'm like,

241
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.850
what do you mean?
He's like,
well,
you know,
someone over there,
they,

242
00:16:33.851 --> 00:16:38.420
they liked the show there fans,
um,
would you consider having them,
uh,

243
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:43.250
how help decorate the new set and they'll give you $100,000.

244
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.390
And I said,
dude,
like I have integrity,
right?

245
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:52.310
I'm not just going to let Mcdonald's through $100,000 at me and just go like,
oh,

246
00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:56.600
now they,
they pick the color scheme.
You know,
he's like,
fair enough.
I,
I,
you know,

247
00:16:56.601 --> 00:16:59.340
that's fair.
And I figured that's that.

248
00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:00.320
<v 3>And also keep in mind,</v>

249
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:05.090
Mcdonald's has discovered that the way to really advertise and reach people is

250
00:17:05.091 --> 00:17:08.570
to do it more embedded.
Like remember we covered that thing,

251
00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:12.200
that story where the Asian kid took a picture of he and his friends and he put

252
00:17:12.201 --> 00:17:15.980
it in the Mcdonald's corporate kind of realize the way to sell now to the

253
00:17:15.981 --> 00:17:20.360
millennials is to make it more embedded and more organic.

254
00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:24.990
<v 0>So that was,
that was the pitch to part of the intention that they had.
Well,</v>

255
00:17:24.991 --> 00:17:27.600
he calls me back a week later,
unprompted.

256
00:17:27.601 --> 00:17:29.700
We haven't any comedy or conversations about it.
He said,
hey,

257
00:17:29.701 --> 00:17:33.960
Mcdonald's wants to know,
I thought we,
I thought we already talked about this.

258
00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:39.360
You said a,
they'll give you $250,000.
And I go,
dude,
I'm not like,

259
00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.410
I'm not doing that,
you know?
Right.

260
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:46.670
So I don't hear from him for,
uh,

261
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.670
this time,
like,
I dunno,

262
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.710
three or four weeks more and this side and now like the,

263
00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.200
the layout has is picked and there's already a design coming.

264
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.120
He calls me up and he goes,
hey,

265
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.910
I know this sounds crazy,
but you know,

266
00:18:05.911 --> 00:18:09.630
Mcdonald's and I go again with the Mcdonald's.
He goes,

267
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.950
how does two point $3 million sound?
Okay.

268
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:18.103
<v 3>Okay.</v>

269
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:23.690
<v 0>Yeah.
And what do they want to do?</v>

270
00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:25.341
He's like,

271
00:18:25.341 --> 00:18:29.930
they want to design the set and then you guys get like free Mcdonald's all the

272
00:18:29.931 --> 00:18:34.490
time.
And I go,
do they dictate like,
uh,

273
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:39.200
you know,
are they going to pick out what we can talk about and stuff?

274
00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:43.180
And he's like,
no,
he's like,
go hardcore.
You know,

275
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:49.070
just let Mcdonald's have a little fucking stay.
Yeah.
Yeah.

276
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:53.360
<v 3>And I'm a huge fan of their products already.
This is kind of a no brainer.
Easy.</v>

277
00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.870
I tell you,
I can't remember the last time I had a filet of fish,

278
00:18:56.871 --> 00:19:00.470
but it's fantastic if you had this and drinks are amazing.
Amazing.

279
00:19:00.471 --> 00:19:04.490
The coke is always so sweet and bubbly.
It's just an the nuggets.

280
00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.320
I love the nuggets.
Which one's your favorite?

281
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:11.720
<v 0>But yeah,
I really like keep it simple.
Cheeseburgers,
fries,
chicken nuggets.</v>

282
00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:15.770
Yeah.
Especially if you're drunk.
They asked us not to say that,
but

283
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.790
if you're drunk it's even better.
Oh fuck yeah.

284
00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:24.370
<v 3>We also picked up our happy meals on the way in banks,
Mcdonald's,
Hank,
you,</v>

285
00:19:24.371 --> 00:19:27.850
Mcdonald's.
The neatest part is that,

286
00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.790
I mean we're trying to get them to Redo this policy,

287
00:19:30.791 --> 00:19:34.090
but they did ask as the happy meal for a boy or a girl.
Yeah.
What's up with that?

288
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:35.770
I want you to pick your own pronouns.

289
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.940
We're going to have to educate them on the non binary stuff.
But other than that,

290
00:19:39.941 --> 00:19:43.240
what toy did you get?
And your happy meal.
Oh,
let's see.
What do I did?

291
00:19:43.241 --> 00:19:45.010
I guess I got the boys one.
This is a truck.

292
00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.560
<v 0>I got a bread truck.
No,
it's gay.
Oh,</v>

293
00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:55.600
I got a cat with a girl.
Oh,
what did they put fruit in here now?

294
00:19:55.810 --> 00:20:00.190
Oh No.
Oh boy.
Oh,
I like these fries though.
It's delicious.

295
00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.990
Thank you.
Mcdonald's.
You know,
so many people message me about Mcdonald's.

296
00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.870
Um,
some variants,
halting ways.

297
00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.190
One in such a way that I didn't even feel comfortable repeating it.

298
00:20:12.191 --> 00:20:16.680
So I had it recorded.
This is what somebody messaged me about art.

299
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.980
<v 3>You got to Mcdonald's nigger.
Huh?
I Dunno.</v>

300
00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:24.780
What's tone that is,
is that complimentary?
Oh,

301
00:20:24.781 --> 00:20:27.810
you're saying that we got that as a,
as a common comment.

302
00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:30.750
And then you had somebody maybe read it out loud.
Out Loud.
Yeah.

303
00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.540
Can we hear it again?
Well that was,
you got to Mcdonald's nigger.

304
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:37.050
That's what he's like.
He's a little dismayed by it or something.
Sure.

305
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:42.090
You got a Mcdonald's liquor and that celebrate,
right?
You did this good for you.

306
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:47.220
So the answer is yeah,
yeah,
it did.
And a loving.

307
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:48.663
So

308
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.400
<v 0>there's a lot to celebrate and I hope that everybody's,
uh,</v>

309
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:59.230
as happy as we are with um,
the corporate sponsorship.
We have the Burgers,

310
00:20:59.231 --> 00:21:03.640
we have filet of fish,
many,
many French fries,

311
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:07.660
all that we want.
Oh good.
It's so good.

312
00:21:07.661 --> 00:21:11.380
I know there really is a big map that's,
it's been a long time,

313
00:21:11.381 --> 00:21:15.020
but now I feel like it's going to be a regular part of my diet with a,

314
00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.270
their involvement.
So,

315
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:19.510
well you can't make it Paleo if you just don't need the bunk.

316
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:23.470
Let me just tell some other address.
One other thing about the new setup here.

317
00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:28.270
So people were really flipping out about,
you know,

318
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:32.470
how everything's working.
Just give it a second man.
Things will change.
You know,

319
00:21:32.471 --> 00:21:35.860
like you just got to get some people flipped out.
It's like dude,

320
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.530
we're trying things out.
Like today for instance,
you know,

321
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:42.730
we have tech things going on today.
If you're watching the show,

322
00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.570
you won't see us picture in picture can we have some type of glitch?

323
00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:50.860
So you're going to see the videos full frame.
I Dunno,

324
00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.180
you might end up liking that.
Maybe we'll end up doing it.
I who knows.
Well,

325
00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:58.210
another difference you might notice is that the set lighting is darker.

326
00:21:58.211 --> 00:22:02.010
It's darker.
Mcdonald's gave us the,
okay.
Yeah.
We had to ask them.

327
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.450
We said we turned down the lights and they were like,
yeah,
okay.

328
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.200
We did feel it was a little bright for steak house.
And I was like,

329
00:22:08.201 --> 00:22:12.010
you have to get back any money.
And they were like,
no,
but you know,
don't,

330
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:13.630
don't make it be darker.
No.

331
00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:18.860
When people don't know that you're still at our restaurant.
So.

332
00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:20.323
Right.

333
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.760
Well the neat thing about Mcdonald's is a sponsor is that they don't censor us.

334
00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:28.180
They don't,
they let us do what you want,
what they want.
And like,
you know,

335
00:22:28.181 --> 00:22:29.710
we might even do some things where like,
well,

336
00:22:29.711 --> 00:22:33.220
we'll take some of you guys out to Mcdonald's,
you know.
Well that's cool.
Yeah.

337
00:22:33.221 --> 00:22:37.720
It could be like a cool,
maybe like we'll do a,
a road alive,

338
00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:41.400
your mom's house and then we'll take everyone and McDonald's awesome.

339
00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:44.600
Or we'll have it catered.
You know,
that's the kind of life we live here.

340
00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.420
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

341
00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:50.410
<v 0>Fucking do so</v>

342
00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.360
well.
Anyway.
That's what happened.
And that's what happened.

343
00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:05.350
Speaking of awesome sponsors.
Yeah.
Um,
the wonderful people at Saatva,

344
00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:08.590
if you listened last week,
um,

345
00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:13.650
were kind enough to allow us to do a type of contest gene and the contest is

346
00:23:15.431 --> 00:23:19.030
that we can,
um,

347
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:24.180
we put out a call to the listeners and we asked you guys to tell us why you

348
00:23:26.981 --> 00:23:31.120
deserved a free Saatva mattress.

349
00:23:31.121 --> 00:23:32.830
They're letting us give away a couple of them.

350
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:38.120
We're going to do a luxury mattress and illumine leaf memory foam mattress.

351
00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:44.010
And you have to tell us why you bombarded the email account with so many

352
00:23:44.561 --> 00:23:46.130
submissions.
These guys

353
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:50.600
<v 6>had to filter through,
I don't know,
more than a hundred or 200 you said.</v>

354
00:23:50.601 --> 00:23:54.870
And um,
yeah,
a lot.
Yeah.
So,
uh,

355
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:59.270
these are your selects of some of the best ones.
Yeah,
we narrowed it down.

356
00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:00.463
Um,

357
00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:05.470
there was hundreds that got submitted and me and Josh went through them and

358
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:08.240
picked our favorites.
Okay.
Um,
I guess we can,

359
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:11.480
should we just watch them in succession?
Let them rip?
Yeah,

360
00:24:11.481 --> 00:24:14.890
we picked our top eight.
Okay.
We think it's a good representative of everyone.

361
00:24:14.891 --> 00:24:19.820
We stop after each one.
Sure.
Okay.
All right.
Let's,
let's,
let's go.
Ready Gene?

362
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:23.690
<v 10>Good Morning Sandra.
It's me.
Trains.
Just wanted to say hi.</v>

363
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:27.140
What's your a great day and telling you that you're giving away a free mattress

364
00:24:27.141 --> 00:24:30.200
to a mommy.
Need this one of the greatest opportunity to do so.
My life,

365
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:32.930
since I finished putting myself through college,

366
00:24:32.931 --> 00:24:36.410
I had to move out of state for work and haven't been able to afford furniture.

367
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:40.070
Should have been sleeping on the floor before.
Crown Molding.

368
00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:43.820
Please help me erase that from my memory of this mattress.

369
00:24:43.821 --> 00:24:45.500
Like it's never been loved before.

370
00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.590
I could really see my cell phone asleep on you,
so let's make it happen.

371
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:49.783
Ciao baby.

372
00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.320
<v 6>Very cool.
Well done.
And also tugged at the heartstrings a little bit.</v>

373
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:58.200
Definitely expresses a clear need here for a match.
He does.
He does.

374
00:24:58.201 --> 00:25:00.930
Trey have sleeping like I did on a dog bed.
No.

375
00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:05.070
You at least had a mattress portray.
Yeah.
So far so good.
I mean,

376
00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:06.450
I would say the tray

377
00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.770
<v 11>go morning.
Saatva me,</v>

378
00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.310
Joe here about you extend the way mattresses the other day.

379
00:25:12.311 --> 00:25:16.140
I couldn't stop thinking about you.
As you can see my mattress,
he,

380
00:25:16.141 --> 00:25:18.550
it's old and may time I have a guest over,

381
00:25:18.551 --> 00:25:21.070
they say that they're scared or uncomfortable.

382
00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.700
They just want to go back home to the old mattress.
So,
uh,

383
00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:26.440
I hope this message doesn't scare you,

384
00:25:26.441 --> 00:25:28.510
but I promise if you send me another mattress,

385
00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.410
I won't ever go back to my old mattress.

386
00:25:30.411 --> 00:25:33.550
Somebody even know who my ex masters was,
but that's all you're getting for now.

387
00:25:33.551 --> 00:25:35.830
Saatva shall baby.

388
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.890
<v 6>Wow.
For those of you just listening to the show,</v>

389
00:25:39.891 --> 00:25:44.180
he had a woman tied to his existing mattress in the background,

390
00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.750
had ankles,
wrists and a,
a bag or something over her head.

391
00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:52.990
So it was terrifying and very well,
uh,
very creative.
Very well orchestrated.

392
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.260
I will say for this gentleman,
yes.
What I do like is his shirtlessness.

393
00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:01.490
He really got some points there.
Yeah,
that was,
yeah.

394
00:26:01.491 --> 00:26:05.150
Steve and Sarah.
Sure.
Big points.
We're going shirtless.

395
00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:08.900
And that's one of the your mom's house hallmark.
Yeah.
Have a good video.

396
00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.940
Shirtlessness poor lighting homies.
Oh,

397
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.940
I think I should get the mattress because I have never had a new mattress.

398
00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:19.910
I'm currently sleeping on the one my grandmother.
Yeah,

399
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:29.580
winner,
winner chicken dinner.
I think they found that was pretty great.
Yup.

400
00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.610
I like that.
What's

401
00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:34.120
<v 12>the deal man?
Broke college student.
He skipped fucked a lot.
Man.</v>

402
00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:40.740
Black guys has on me when I'm sleeping on an inflatable mattress.

403
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.130
Oh,

404
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:49.050
<v 3>stop.
Uh,

Give me a real mattress.</v>

405
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.820
The home here now waiting for delivery.
I love it.

406
00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:57.460
He gets my vote for sure.
For sure.
She's getting one like,

407
00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:01.260
you know what I like is that she chose reason and logic.
That was a,

408
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.620
a reasonable argument.
Is this person a pre law?

409
00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:08.440
She knows her audience.

410
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:16.700
<v 13>Even though a real handy guy,</v>

411
00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.093
cause I'm looking

412
00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:30.200
at a lease in a key and even bring your friends,
man,
I,
here's the deal man,

413
00:27:30.201 --> 00:27:32.900
but I can't do this on this piece of crap,
so I need your help.

414
00:27:32.901 --> 00:27:37.010
Mommy's helped me get a new mask,
hot white come dump and I need

415
00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:43.040
<v 3>wow.
Wow.
I mean,
look,
she's got the lighting down,</v>

416
00:27:43.041 --> 00:27:47.630
she's got different themes from your mom's house.
She's got the acting chops.
Yup.

417
00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:51.340
Wow.
She nailed it to fuck.
That's so,

418
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:54.040
and Christine,

419
00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:58.130
I think I should get the mattress because I don't have a fucking mattress.

420
00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:03.470
Oh,
sweet.
And to the point.
Very direct.
Ooh.

421
00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:09.120
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

422
00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:36.140
<v 3>strokes.
Very creative.</v>

423
00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:40.820
Wow.
Very talented people out there.
30 seconds is not a lot of time.

424
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:45.170
I know to be funny and informative.
So was good.
We kept it to that though.

425
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:46.063
For sure.

426
00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:47.820
<v 5>Mommy,
mommy,</v>

427
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.400
Christina coming at you from your favorite camera angle.

428
00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.990
Some my mattress situation.

429
00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:01.930
The springs are gone.
Full mattress.
So I have to lay a towel on top.

430
00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:14.890
<v 3>That one was oh my life.
God.
I mean,
how are we supposed to choose?</v>

431
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:19.900
I don't know man.
I Dunno.
That was really good though.
No.
And again,

432
00:29:19.901 --> 00:29:23.800
like when the,
when he shows you the,
uh,
horrific mattress,

433
00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:25.330
you're going to want to just give you a,

434
00:29:25.331 --> 00:29:27.880
but then there are people that don't even have a mattress.

435
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.880
And then there are people's grandmas died on their mattresses.

436
00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:34.090
And then there are girls,
I wanna fuck black guys on their match.
Right.

437
00:29:34.091 --> 00:29:38.260
Do you think that all right.
So,
um,

438
00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:41.450
I can't decide right now.
Are we supposed to decide right now?
Uh,

439
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:43.630
we probably should.
Yeah.
I'm like,
who's your favorite?

440
00:29:43.631 --> 00:29:45.250
Which ones can we go to the most?

441
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:49.610
I like the girl who mashed together the different videos and at the end finished

442
00:29:49.611 --> 00:29:51.880
in the dark as the tryout guy.

443
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.650
I mean I have stability for the last guy and the grandma one,
those three,

444
00:29:56.651 --> 00:30:01.210
I feel like tugged at my heart,
my heart strings.
I liked those as well.

445
00:30:01.211 --> 00:30:06.040
I was going to vote for the last guy and then the first girl with the bike in

446
00:30:06.041 --> 00:30:11.040
her living room with the air mattress.
Oh,
smash.
You know,
she's trying to get,

447
00:30:11.041 --> 00:30:11.980
get with the black dudes.

448
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.860
So you're saying we should get a black guy and then the girl who wants a

449
00:30:14.861 --> 00:30:19.520
mattress to fuck the black guys on.
Okay.
Can you might not ruin,
oh,

450
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:24.880
sorry.
Earning at that had died that Jesus,

451
00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:29.640
God,
I'm loving it.

452
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:35.020
So,
um,
here's what I'm going to,
I dunno.
Um,

453
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:39.260
yeah,
I vote for.
So who do you vote for?
Yeah,
I mean,

454
00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:43.360
I personally,
I vote,
I vote for Ray.
The last guy.
I mean,

455
00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.580
he seems like he's most in need of a mattress.

456
00:30:45.581 --> 00:30:49.060
He's got a like a metal spring poking him in the back and he's got to lit towel

457
00:30:49.061 --> 00:30:50.530
down for,
Gosh,

458
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:54.610
do we all agree that there's one given that level of suffering?
Yeah.

459
00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:58.390
And sometimes sleeping on the floors better than sleeping on a mat on that kind

460
00:30:58.391 --> 00:31:01.780
of,
okay.
So there's one,
oh my God.
Okay,
go ahead.
What about,
what's your,

461
00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:04.720
what's your next favorite one?
A next favorite one?

462
00:31:04.721 --> 00:31:08.530
I'd probably say the girl that runs through all the different why made stuff?

463
00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:11.980
Yeah,
that's the girl that I liked.
That one at the end.

464
00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:16.690
Okay.
That guy,
uh,
that has the girl tied up in the bed.

465
00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:21.120
That's my points for that.
There's points for that.
True.
Well,

466
00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:25.810
it sounds like you both voted for that girl then,
right?
Yeah.
All right.

467
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:29.590
There it is.
There's two people they want.
Hey,
those are our winners.

468
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:31.720
Congratulations.
Uh,

469
00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:36.520
for the two people is the girl and a and the guy with the metal spring.
Pocono.

470
00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.100
Yes.
Okay.
Yeah.

471
00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:42.150
<v 14>Alright.
[inaudible]</v>

472
00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:46.950
<v 3>congratulations guys.
Yeah.
Enjoy your new site for mattress.</v>

473
00:31:46.951 --> 00:31:51.750
We've been sleeping on ours for a long time and thank you for participating.

474
00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.710
Um,
in that,
that fun giveaway.
How was fun?

475
00:31:56.060 --> 00:32:00.520
It was Tommy.
Yeah.
You had some explosive Brown's today.
Oh,

476
00:32:00.521 --> 00:32:02.520
it was really bad.
I don't know what happened to me,

477
00:32:02.521 --> 00:32:07.521
but I have a theory all morning long for bad and I'm upset because we couldn't

478
00:32:08.791 --> 00:32:11.640
come here fast enough.
And you couldn't use a fart mic.
Oh,
it's empty.

479
00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:15.270
There's nothing in the chamber.
Yeah,
I mean,
I got to say,

480
00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:19.250
if I had had what I had,
um,

481
00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:24.540
last week or like this morning last week,

482
00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:28.110
it would've been so epic.
Right.
I was actually,

483
00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:33.180
I will say,
and I give you full credit.
Okay.
I'm not trying to share the credit.

484
00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.890
I give you full credit.

485
00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:40.580
A lot of people were celebrating as they were knocking the studio design.

486
00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:45.090
Sure.
They were saying,
well,
the one saving grace is that Fart,
Mike.
Right.

487
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.740
Which is your credit.
Um,
I honestly,
if I could go back,

488
00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:53.770
I wouldn't have even farted in it the first time because it was such a minuscule

489
00:32:54.111 --> 00:32:54.944
fart.

490
00:32:55.250 --> 00:33:00.250
It was so insignificant and to me the Fart Mike should be reserved for huge

491
00:33:02.061 --> 00:33:05.480
impact.
Far It's only,
wait,
what are you telling me?

492
00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:10.370
You're telling me that you're a fart supremacist and you only want the biggest

493
00:33:10.371 --> 00:33:14.180
farts.
Yes.
That fart last week was so like,

494
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.800
it was like Tom,
all farts matter.
No,
I don't think so.

495
00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:22.400
I'm not going to grab this thing every time I have to farm.
You've got to do it.

496
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:26.060
That's your obligation to the listeners.
That's what the Fart Mike is for.

497
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:29.810
When you heard what I did in the at home today,

498
00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:34.700
in the morning when that was like,
that was amazing.
That's amazing.

499
00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.170
That's something that I would share it,

500
00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:40.190
but what kind of attitude is this that that not all the farts are going to make

501
00:33:40.191 --> 00:33:43.490
it to Fart,
Mike.
Some are good and some are better.
That's just how life is.

502
00:33:43.491 --> 00:33:48.110
You can't bat,
you can't bat a perfect score.
Whatever they say in baseball.
Right.

503
00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:51.930
I'm so empty right now.
There's nothing left in me.

504
00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:56.220
Why don't you eat some more McDonald's?
Oh,
we'll talk to the sponsor of weights.

505
00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:56.541
A number.

506
00:33:56.541 --> 00:33:59.420
You're being serious here that you're going to be kind of lazy about the FARC.

507
00:33:59.421 --> 00:34:01.790
Mike is what I'm hearing.
I'm going to be selective.

508
00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:06.050
I wouldn't say it's lazy at all.
I'm going to say I'm going to grab that FARC,

509
00:34:06.051 --> 00:34:07.790
Mike,
when I feel like,
Ooh,
this is,

510
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.030
this is something that I'm not just going to do it for.

511
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:15.980
Like I broke the mold here,
I Chris,
but it was with a,
it was a lame fart.

512
00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:19.310
Do you feel that people judge the Fart?
That it wasn't big enough?

513
00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:22.190
I know that I'm more critical of myself than other people are.

514
00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:26.270
I'm a perfectionist.
I want it to be a certain level.
Right?
So yeah,

515
00:34:26.271 --> 00:34:29.420
I'm sure people out there were like,
what?
What is that?
That wasn't even a fart.

516
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:31.550
That's what you heard.
That's what I heard.
You know?
I think,

517
00:34:31.551 --> 00:34:34.940
I think you should bring this up in therapy because I think you're just hearing

518
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:38.240
your own negative talk.
That's negative self talk.
That's true.

519
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:40.280
I think that part was great.
No,

520
00:34:40.281 --> 00:34:44.900
you need to give yourself more credit for your work as a r t I don't think so.

521
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:47.210
You need to give yourself some credit.
That's very nice to you.

522
00:34:47.211 --> 00:34:51.230
But I don't feel that way.
Okay.
Sorry.
I can only you know,
you,
you,

523
00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:55.640
you hear what you want to hear.
Yeah,
just didn't,
I don't,
I don't,

524
00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:58.460
I didn't feel like it today.
Well then just for the audience listening,

525
00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:00.950
I'm going to get continued to give you all my farts.

526
00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.490
All I have and you decide which ones you like.

527
00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:06.213
<v 15>Yeah.</v>

528
00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:11.650
<v 3>That's just
on a side note.
I just wanted to give you a surprise.</v>

529
00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:15.730
Um,
there's something,
I've been working on a with an a dog here.

530
00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:18.970
What for a minute.
Um,

531
00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:20.250
<v 15>okay.</v>

532
00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:24.360
<v 3>Well I'm a dog.
We know we've been a discussion about who drinks the most water.</v>

533
00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:28.470
Oh,
for fucks.
And we just put a little compilation.
How many episodes is this

534
00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:29.710
<v 16>dot.</v>

535
00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:33.670
So this is a span of the last four episodes and something that I've been doing

536
00:35:33.671 --> 00:35:37.440
for the last six months is whenever someone's taking a clear sip of water,

537
00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:40.140
I cut to them for the duration of the sip.

538
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:44.010
So I've compiled a little bit of stuff to show you guys a,

539
00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.490
Christina's got a lot of footage of

540
00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:48.970
<v 3>the last episode.
Go ahead.
Roll it.
Let's see it.</v>

541
00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:51.323
<v 8>Oh really?</v>

542
00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:53.240
<v 6>Last week,</v>

543
00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.690
one of my favorite moments when we had done a gun was when you and I just looked

544
00:35:56.691 --> 00:36:01.100
at each other.
Yeah.
Good.
Now hands,

545
00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:06.480
Garry.
Garry Oak is first baby.

546
00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.330
That doesn't really say that,
but I'll tell you this.

547
00:36:10.331 --> 00:36:14.540
And I thought this the other day at cleaned my room.
What's up?

548
00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.480
Like so and like I have never,

549
00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:23.230
it's the best thing I've ever heard it so long.

550
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:28.370
So she's like,
when he was feeding people,

551
00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:32.960
<v 16>alright,
it's very long.
We're maybe halfway.
Oh my God.</v>

552
00:36:32.961 --> 00:36:35.400
You're going to you that for the audience I was to.

553
00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:37.830
But you know what would made a judgement call?
Uh,
let's,
uh,

554
00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:38.683
take a look at Thompson.

555
00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.220
<v 0>Oh for fuck sake.</v>

556
00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.590
<v 8>Alright,
here's Tom.</v>

557
00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:52.030
<v 3>Well,
I can tell you</v>

558
00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:56.770
<v 0>something that will probably blow your mind.</v>

559
00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:01.390
And that is that I was actually told to dial back my way.

560
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:06.750
<v 3>Yeah,
true.
Stop it.
It's true.
What are you going to stop with the excuses?</v>

561
00:37:06.751 --> 00:37:09.930
It's not an excuse.
It's very true.
You're such a liar face.
Yeah.

562
00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:14.760
<v 0>That was over at,
uh,
that diagnostics like blood and they were like,</v>

563
00:37:14.761 --> 00:37:17.490
you need,
you're hydrating too much.
Uh Huh.

564
00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.510
So what I've been doing is I just pick up a little window of time window
hydrate.

565
00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:25.300
<v 3>You're such a liar.
Not,
I can't believe.
Now you're spitting this,</v>

566
00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:28.360
that it's a medical necessity for you to drink less water.

567
00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:31.930
There's no doctor's going to tell you to drink a last one.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah,

568
00:37:31.931 --> 00:37:36.760
there are good ones.
Well,
oh my God,
I can't believe you're such a liar.
Well,

569
00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:40.870
are you finally going to admit that I'm the true water champ now the evidence?

570
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:43.150
<v 0>No,
I'm not.</v>

571
00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:49.160
<v 3>I mean the evidence was there,
that video,
we had to stop watching it.</v>

572
00:37:49.161 --> 00:37:52.220
It was a minute long of montage of just me drinking

573
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:54.780
<v 7>it.
Look</v>

574
00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.110
<v 0>what you did in that video while sure.
It looks,</v>

575
00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:03.090
it looks like it's impressive.
If you're talking about a camera rolling all day,

576
00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:06.720
I would be like in an ocean.
Okay.
You're doing it.
You're like,
oh,

577
00:38:06.721 --> 00:38:10.800
there's a camera on.
Unbelievable.
Hold on.
Believable.
We'll show.

578
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:15.730
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable is right.
I can't believe Yana will.
I'll,
uh,

579
00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:19.050
<v 3>the audience to decide.
You guys,
you decide,
I mean,</v>

580
00:38:19.051 --> 00:38:21.960
you've been watching me drink and hydrate and he doesn't,

581
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:24.480
it's clear that I'm the champion.
Thank you.
How's that nugget?

582
00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:26.730
What's your favorite dipping sauce?

583
00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:30.150
<v 0>I like the barbecue.</v>

584
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:35.270
I want to thank Steve Nice and my golf for setting it up today.

585
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:41.200
<v 6>Yeah,
it's good.
I like the MC rib.
It's a seasonal item.</v>

586
00:38:41.201 --> 00:38:44.290
Did you know that it's not there all year?
Did you know that there's a,

587
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:47.020
there's pickles on the [inaudible] to,
yeah,
of course.

588
00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:51.540
Some people didn't know that.
That's fantastic.
Yeah.
Great.
American food.

589
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:52.893
American food.

590
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:54.543
<v 17>MMM.</v>

591
00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:59.100
<v 6>This is rare,
but I drink so much water that that's take a pee break.
Oh,
stop it.</v>

592
00:38:59.101 --> 00:39:03.360
Oh,
let's do a quick pee break and we'll be right back.
Oh Man,

593
00:39:03.361 --> 00:39:07.230
those are good pee break.
I know.
I just ain't that big Mac.
I feel so sick now,

594
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:12.300
dude.
Oh,
I feel nourished.

595
00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:16.800
Amy Sponsor crying out loud.
Women are stupid.

596
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:22.400
<v 17>Uh,
yeah.</v>

597
00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:23.711
<v 6>Anyways,</v>

598
00:39:23.711 --> 00:39:28.711
I feel so nourished and I feel healthy and happy now that I ate some Mcdonald's.

599
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:34.150
Um,
you know,
pause for another bathroom break.
We,
um,

600
00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:39.480
we went like a month ago to a Laker game,

601
00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:43.540
which was a thrill.
I've always loved sports.

602
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:48.340
I always felt like you were kind of on the edge with it.
Like we were like,

603
00:39:48.341 --> 00:39:52.590
well take it or leave it or whatever.
Not really care.
But you had,
um,

604
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.650
the best time I did.
I really enjoyed it.
You really,

605
00:39:57.190 --> 00:40:01.190
really loved,
uh,
going to the game.
But I want us to go back to Morgan.

606
00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:08.020
I Dunno what you loved about it.
I had a different ideas,
but um,

607
00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:12.070
you,
you mentioned that you were having a great time.

608
00:40:12.071 --> 00:40:16.720
It got me excited to want to go to more basketball games and there's this,
um,

609
00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:21.460
young lady here who is also a fan of basketball.

610
00:40:21.461 --> 00:40:24.820
You might relate to her in a lot of ways.
Oh,
okay,
cool.

611
00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:29.050
<v 18>My favorite basketball team is whatever NBA player.
I'm fucking,</v>

612
00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.060
I love watching basketball.

613
00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:35.280
It's just way more interesting when there's someone on the team like that I'm

614
00:40:35.281 --> 00:40:37.870
linked to,
but I don't have a favorite one.
Just players

615
00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:44.230
<v 6>I think was real too.
I believe it.
She's really cute.
She's cute.</v>

616
00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:48.670
NBA s l u t t is,
and look at it.
What sheet and our pasta,

617
00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:52.510
making videos about it too,
in a way.
You know what this really is.

618
00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:57.370
It's like this video is like a bat signal.
Yeah.
Gay players.

619
00:40:57.371 --> 00:41:00.670
Yes.
So she talks about it in a general sense,
but then if you're a player,

620
00:41:00.671 --> 00:41:05.440
you're like,
Hey,
what's up?
What are you like,
Hey,
what's up?
I'm going to be in.

621
00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:09.760
You got to meet Thursday.
Yeah.
Though there's a,

622
00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:14.200
there's definitely,
I mean,
she knows,
she knows what she's doing to,
I believe it.

623
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:15.910
Well,
I believe,
I think you're right.

624
00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:19.860
It's kind of like that chick that called herself superhead.
Yeah,
I remember.

625
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:22.290
And she's like,
I didn't the best head.
And then before,
you know,

626
00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:26.380
there's a line of guys around the block.
Oh yeah,
right,
Tom?
Oh yeah.
Tom Goes,

627
00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:30.540
oh yeah,
oh boy.
At school that hadn't takes like that.

628
00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:34.070
Yeah.
Good

629
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.610
<v 3>for her.
I will say,
you know,</v>

630
00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:40.160
in my youth I was so stupid because I was like,
I would just give it out,

631
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:44.890
give it out,
but for a free hot dog or whatever,
yeah.

632
00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:47.870
At least she's getting her money.
You think she's getting her money?

633
00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.890
She's eating good pasta.
That's the,
I don't know.
I don't know.

634
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:55.580
I'm hoping that she's getting something or for it or just getting like handbags

635
00:41:55.581 --> 00:42:00.530
and stuff,
you know?
Sure.
No,
me like I was like,
I love people I have.
Yeah,

636
00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.500
I bet.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I believe in love and stuff like that.

637
00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:09.120
<v 18>First thing often doubt is the doubt because I love sucking Dick,</v>

638
00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:14.550
but
here's the thing,
there's a lot of guys that have been with that.

639
00:42:14.551 --> 00:42:17.400
I never sucked your day or if we were intimate,
it wasn't a focal point,

640
00:42:17.401 --> 00:42:18.720
so I don't know.

641
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:23.490
<v 3>Now that's one of your favorite things is when girls talking about how they law.</v>

642
00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:27.630
Yeah.
I always think that's a little fishy when a girl leaves with that,

643
00:42:27.631 --> 00:42:29.740
like I just love index.

644
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:33.880
I also believe that she's good at it cause she puts it out there.
Yeah.

645
00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:36.960
But that's like the same guy who wears a thumb ring and he's like,

646
00:42:36.961 --> 00:42:41.250
I'm a feminist.
It's the same.
It's the same bait of like,

647
00:42:41.251 --> 00:42:43.170
look how cool I am.
I do the thing every,

648
00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:45.690
everybody wants me to do of the opposite sex.

649
00:42:45.691 --> 00:42:50.190
But do you feel like all you gotta do is basically,

650
00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:54.660
I don't know,
put it out there.
Like if you say it then,

651
00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.930
then people will believe it.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
You're just defining yourself.

652
00:42:57.931 --> 00:42:59.460
Like I'm the world's greatest comedian.

653
00:42:59.461 --> 00:43:02.170
You keep saying that long enough and the right people believe you.

654
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:04.780
You know what's interesting sidebar,
um,

655
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:10.200
is that this new craze with the,
the eyelashes,
have you noticed this?
Yeah.

656
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:13.650
The girls have just outrageously large eyelashes.

657
00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:18.330
They're big and fake and they,
it,
they look so matted together.

658
00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:19.860
It doesn't look good.

659
00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:24.210
Anything that seems like an extreme starts to look cartoonish.
Yeah.
You,
no,

660
00:43:24.211 --> 00:43:28.350
you look like a cartoon.
I like her message though.
It's sort of the same message,

661
00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.730
uh,
that,
um,
dairy.

662
00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:34.500
You remember how you got that?
Our friend last week.

663
00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:39.150
That guys good.
Thank you.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
No thanks.

664
00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:46.020
I don't want to hear,
I don't want to visit it again.
It's great.
All done.
Oh,
Yo.

665
00:43:46.021 --> 00:43:50.580
Beautiful women.
No.
Yeah,
he's the guy,
right?
No thanks.
He's,

666
00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:54.330
he's so good at,
okay.

667
00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:57.510
All right.
I don't know.

668
00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:01.290
Do you think she's a good SLU ut?
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

669
00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:06.120
You've always said that,
that you can tell who's a slot and who's not.

670
00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:10.260
Right.
But I feel like your criteria is kind of our,
I would have pegged her.

671
00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:14.040
I would've,
I would've known.
How do you know she's a slot?
Okay.

672
00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:16.800
Let's just say like she,
you don't hear her talking about second decks and stuff.

673
00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:21.570
Yeah.
Tell me what the giveaway is.
I mean,
look,
it's a combination of things.

674
00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.690
It's the way that it's definitely the way,
you know,

675
00:44:24.691 --> 00:44:27.960
they look the way they look at you.
You know,
the eye contact,

676
00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:31.670
the way someone's stressed that hair,
eye contacts.
Yeah,
of course.
Well,

677
00:44:31.671 --> 00:44:34.970
I'm looking at you right now.
Like what?
What do you mean it's a special icon?

678
00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:39.990
There's a slut.
I energy.
Yeah,
I slept I energy.

679
00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.150
Can you show me your sled?
I energy

680
00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:46.410
<v 19>but I energy.
Hold on.</v>

681
00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:50.790
<v 3>You can't tell by looking at this whole that she's a hoe?
No,</v>

682
00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.910
because when the video started I was like,
Oh,
who's this nice.

683
00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:57.170
You're nice young lady.
She say anything else like this that,
uh,

684
00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:58.880
makes us believe that she's,

685
00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:03.050
<v 18>I'm just honest.
I don't fear anyone or anything,</v>

686
00:45:03.051 --> 00:45:07.850
so I never find it necessary to lie.
You asked me,

687
00:45:07.851 --> 00:45:11.870
did you come babe?
Nope.
Try again next time.

688
00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:15.170
Okay,
last question.
Two bits of advice.

689
00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:18.590
I allow myself to feel if I don't allow myself to feel the emotions get trapped,

690
00:45:18.591 --> 00:45:21.290
therefore I'm suppressing and then when I suppressed,
I become,

691
00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:24.680
when you allow yourself to feel it goes.
Number two was,
I don't judge myself.

692
00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:27.110
I allow myself however much time I need to take it off for it.

693
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:31.350
<v 3>And actually,
can I tell you something?
You had real insight there.
Sure.</v>

694
00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:35.180
She really did.
She's been in therapy for 10 years too.
Yeah.

695
00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:37.950
I'm putting it out there so much.
Oh,
that's what it is,

696
00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:42.360
you think because so many guys have run a train on her.
So much calm.

697
00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:46.830
Yeah.
Clippers Christ.
Yeah,
for sure.

698
00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:50.810
Is she a cheerleader?
She could have been because I always think those,
uh,

699
00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:52.460
like when we saw the lake or is I'm like,
oh,

700
00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:56.910
I wonder if all those true leaders are banging all the players.
They are right.

701
00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:58.890
I think back in the day,
I don't think anymore.

702
00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:03.620
I don't think anymore because there's no money in cheerleading.
No.
Thank you.

703
00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:08.720
So,
so this is what I've been so excited.
Thank you.

704
00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:11.790
By the way.
I want to say a couple of things about that girl.

705
00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:16.260
I think she's actually highly intelligent.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think she's bright.

706
00:46:16.261 --> 00:46:20.520
She had also had a hoe nails.
There's another giveaway.
Nails were hoe ish.

707
00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:24.870
She had the car.
I didn't see it in the first thing,
but the,
the half top thing,

708
00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:29.220
that's a slight lean.
You're leaning into your home.
Um,

709
00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:33.720
and yeah,
I think she's bright,
but she's putting it out there and that's fine.

710
00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:39.050
Hold on.
I'm happy for her.
Can we bring up now?
I like her.
Thank you.

711
00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:44.150
You're married.
Two children.
Two dogs show to get fair.

712
00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:49.470
Do you think you can identify gimme some other slut markers?

713
00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:53.910
Oh,
I mean leggings,
um,
shoes,

714
00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:58.050
certain shoes or giveaways or the shoes and the leggings.
There's just,

715
00:46:58.051 --> 00:46:58.884
there's certain,

716
00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:03.540
there's certain like there's certain heels that are for Ho oh absolutely.

717
00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:08.850
Certain boots that uggs or slept shoes sometimes just depends.

718
00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:12.330
Let's see who's this hole right here?
So funny.
You're always saying that to me.

719
00:47:12.331 --> 00:47:17.280
Cause if I see like her whole gear,
it,
this isn't the whole outfit.
The,

720
00:47:17.281 --> 00:47:22.260
this is where like the,
so she's not a slut.
Is this girl a slut?
She fucks.

721
00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:24.030
I mean,
I wouldn't call her a slut,

722
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:28.620
but I mean it's not like it's impossible to fuck her.
She's,
but she's not as,

723
00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:30.010
she's easier,
but she's

724
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:33.370
<v 6>not a full slide.
Uh,
yeah.
I mean,
yeah,</v>

725
00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:37.130
cause I wear that helmet.
That girl is that girl slept?
No,

726
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:40.680
no,
we talked about it.
Let me,

727
00:47:40.681 --> 00:47:44.320
she goes a sculpting class with that pattern on there and,
okay.
Okay.

728
00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:48.490
That's me by the way.
How about that lady?
I mean,
she fucks,
you could tell,

729
00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:54.340
you know,
it's like she,
she definitely fucks hard now.

730
00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:58.360
I wear leggings with Ugg boots and every time I do at the house,
you're like,

731
00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:02.200
like such a slut.
Mm.
Um,
yeah.

732
00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:07.150
I mean that's j Lo,
is she a slut?
No,
I mean that's like,

733
00:48:07.151 --> 00:48:10.540
you know,
in the outfit,
again,
it's,
it's the,
the,
Ugh,

734
00:48:10.541 --> 00:48:15.040
it can be an accessory of hotem or it can be like a,

735
00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:19.180
obviously something that provides comfort and me here,

736
00:48:19.181 --> 00:48:20.410
she's obviously on set.

737
00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:23.920
She's probably wearing heels or something during the scene.

738
00:48:23.921 --> 00:48:25.750
And that's just downtime.
I mean,
I get it.

739
00:48:25.751 --> 00:48:29.770
I don't think that that in this situation defines her as a whole.

740
00:48:29.771 --> 00:48:34.360
But I mean there's definitely la hoes at the Wareham,
those ugg boots though.

741
00:48:34.361 --> 00:48:38.680
They're made with dog fur on the inside.
Yeah.
Oh Man.
They stink to high heaven.

742
00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:43.670
Oh,
hugs.
Oh my God,
they're called that because they stink there.
Is it dog for,

743
00:48:43.671 --> 00:48:48.330
for real kind of furs in there.
It's not Doug for a,

744
00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:52.130
so here's the,
okay,
this is what I've been so excited.
No thanks.

745
00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:55.540
You know,
no pulled on.
You know how,

746
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:59.950
you know how you had to get my shrink dial?

747
00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:05.410
Any like has featured some of the coolest guys.

748
00:49:05.490 --> 00:49:09.340
I have botox can't scowl,
but I want to scour through the botox.

749
00:49:09.341 --> 00:49:13.540
You know how some of the coolest guys ever have appeared on this show?

750
00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:14.950
Well,
yeah,

751
00:49:14.951 --> 00:49:19.450
there's something cool there is they they,

752
00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:24.690
there's no end to how many cool guys are out there.
That's it.

753
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:25.730
Yeah.
Yeah

754
00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:31.790
<v 20>guys.
Shit again and I'm here to do a little video.
No,</v>

755
00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:35.710
you can use this but by greening toy that I bought this new one and I thought

756
00:49:35.711 --> 00:49:37.960
I'd try that again.
And then I also wanted to try this.

757
00:49:37.961 --> 00:49:42.961
Step one did fuck sleep that has these like massive but oh gosh did the chorus

758
00:49:43.961 --> 00:49:47.200
and then I went to,
they didn't send any better.

759
00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.360
I don't want it stop video.

760
00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:55.380
I cannot park but that but toy vibrates so I'm sure that's got to get me off.

761
00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:02.360
It's got this cool.
I'm going to vomit.
I'm going to,

762
00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:03.650
mom is cool.

763
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:08.670
I saw a friend of mine and he fucks it with his boyfriend and so I really want

764
00:50:10.241 --> 00:50:13.480
to try this because I like fucking stuff at first.

765
00:50:13.481 --> 00:50:17.220
I'm going to try and get this in my butt and then turn it out and it's here.

766
00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:19.890
Got this cool little,
it's pretty welcome.

767
00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:26.890
It's got a nice texture to it.
I think it'll

768
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:29.940
<v 8>easy to go in.
I don't know.</v>

769
00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:37.160
Can we pause this please?
Can we pause?

770
00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:44.660
I need a minute.
Watch this.
We're maybe halfway through all the clips.
Yeah,

771
00:50:44.661 --> 00:50:48.230
I know.
I can we just pause.
I'm going to throw up.
I made some Mcdonald's,

772
00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:52.990
<v 6>but I got to take a minute here.
I got it.
I got it.</v>

773
00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:57.420
I think I'm blind.
I don't like it.
Hey,

774
00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:01.280
what the fuck is happening?
Is this going to with this shit?

775
00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:06.340
<v 8>Where is it doing this?
He's putting something in his head.</v>

776
00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:16.930
<v 6>I don't like any of this.
I don't know.
This cool guy,
ed</v>

777
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:21.590
made this video.

778
00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:25.850
He did not post it on youtube.

779
00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:31.830
This was on a hardcore sex.
Sorry,

780
00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:37.850
I was just Josh potters thing.
Oh Shit.
No,
no.
I was given the,

781
00:51:37.851 --> 00:51:38.390
uh,

782
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:43.390
the great benefit of having this email to me and somebody wrote,

783
00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:48.890
I'd love to give them credit.
They wrote 'em Hey,
I saw this video.

784
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:52.190
It seems awesome and perfect for your show.
And I was like,
all right,

785
00:51:52.191 --> 00:51:53.001
I'll see what this is.

786
00:51:53.001 --> 00:51:58.001
I started to laugh so hard that I forwarded it and then a dob told me,

787
00:51:59.781 --> 00:52:02.480
he's like,
I spent a lot of time a cropping cause he's,

788
00:52:02.481 --> 00:52:04.840
he's got a hard on the whole time and he's straight

789
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:09.450
<v 8>jerking off.
Grab the entire video.
Today when I was looking over the clips,</v>

790
00:52:09.451 --> 00:52:12.360
I noticed that there were some spots that I missed so I had to go back.

791
00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:14.430
You'll see it.
Yeah,
I thought so.

792
00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:16.960
<v 6>Cause his other hand is doing something the whole time.</v>

793
00:52:16.961 --> 00:52:19.090
Then he starts doing something.
Yeah.
And I'm like,

794
00:52:19.091 --> 00:52:21.700
what is this animal doing though right now though?

795
00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:26.980
Freeze framed here in studio with his uh,
legs coming back.

796
00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:29.380
I got it.
I got it.

797
00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:32.410
That's why I had to stop and take a minute because my lunch is coming up.

798
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:37.810
There's nothing more disgusting to me than an a man at this angle.

799
00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:42.660
Do you know what I'm saying?
With his leg up and his foot in the frame.
Yeah.

800
00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:43.930
It's so disgusting.

801
00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:50.930
It's cool though that he provides this service to the community.

802
00:52:51.341 --> 00:52:54.340
Then I got these toys.
I've got to review them for you.

803
00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:58.930
Nobody going how they work.
Nobody needs him to do any of this.
By the way though.

804
00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:02.200
Let's start with you regularly.
Cause he's so comfortable.
He's like,
hey guys,

805
00:53:02.201 --> 00:53:06.490
I'm back.
You know,
it's like,
like those guys that opened like a,
you know,

806
00:53:06.491 --> 00:53:10.120
like I got the new Samsung Galaxy.
Like check it out.
Yeah.

807
00:53:10.121 --> 00:53:14.560
So he's doing his review.
Well,
he's nude.
He's shirtless.
He's completely naked.

808
00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:16.300
He's got a crazy tan.

809
00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:20.290
Like you could tell he goes a tan tanning beds and wears like his little speedos

810
00:53:20.291 --> 00:53:24.210
in there.
Um,
but let's see how this stuff works.

811
00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:25.980
Background is hideous too.
He's got like

812
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:26.813
<v 3>an ass</v>

813
00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:28.700
<v 20>I'm going to throw up.
I can't.</v>

814
00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:32.450
It does have kind of a good size head.

815
00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:38.200
So it may take me a minute.
Okay.
Take your time.

816
00:53:40.570 --> 00:53:45.010
But
since my last uh,
but toy video.

817
00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:49.780
Oh,
okay.
So you do do this a lot.
Oof.

818
00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:51.790
Take it in.
Oh yeah.

819
00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:57.520
I've said this before with [inaudible].
If you're new to it,
we got to go slow.

820
00:53:57.970 --> 00:54:02.140
Don't try and rush it.
Yeah.
They'll try and go too fast.
Yeah.

821
00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:05.580
I said a little hurt.
Trust me

822
00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:09.280
once.
Uh,
once you get used to it,

823
00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:15.780
you learn how to breathe and relax yourself.
Yeah.
Play can be a lot of fun.

824
00:54:15.790 --> 00:54:17.930
Sure.
Okay.

825
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:23.530
I can't take this pretty comfortable in there.

826
00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:28.070
Okie doke.
Thanks.
Okay.

827
00:54:31.690 --> 00:54:34.630
Oh,
nice.
That's a nice feel to it.

828
00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:41.530
<v 3>Stop.
Oh,
please.
No,
please.
I'm going to die up.
Dying.
I'm dead.</v>

829
00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:45.550
Weight Kik.
Why do they call it?
He's always like,
they're always like,

830
00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:49.420
but play and then I'm like,
Ooh,
this hurts.
Like what?

831
00:54:49.421 --> 00:54:53.210
Part of that play implies fun and pleasure and they're always like,
oh,

832
00:54:53.211 --> 00:54:56.680
it hurts going in play,
but play.

833
00:54:57.030 --> 00:55:01.450
It's not play playground play implies probably,
but it is.
It's fun.

834
00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:06.530
There's just a little discomfort at first.
This heads pretty big.
Yeah.
Ah,

835
00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:10.600
ah.
I haven't had this feeling since the last,
but plug video.

836
00:55:10.601 --> 00:55:14.980
I made a man.
He's a UHF.
He's really,

837
00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:16.940
yeah.
Yeah.

838
00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:22.060
How do you get to this point in your life?
Like what's happened up until now?

839
00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:25.420
Obviously this guy is like,
this is a good idea for me to do on the Internet,

840
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:30.160
and he's got to get positive feedback about it.
Tons.
Yeah.
I mean,

841
00:55:30.161 --> 00:55:34.030
people are like,
Hey,
what do you,
Hey Jimmy,
what do you make it another bit?
Terry,

842
00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:38.350
he's a Terry.
I feel like Terri Terri make another video this week or what?

843
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:43.210
But how do you get this comfortable with it?
You know,
I imagine the first one,

844
00:55:43.211 --> 00:55:46.990
he's a little timid doing it a lot.
That's the thing,

845
00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:49.420
like with practice practice,
it's like he was saying,

846
00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:52.480
you don't shove a deck in there the first time he's into it.
Okay,
cool.

847
00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:56.530
So now he's making videos all the time.
I got to say decent camera.

848
00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:03.940
The angles not flattering or not flattering that I like lighting.

849
00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:08.590
Not Great.
Yeah,
background,
not great.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's got his teeth,

850
00:56:08.591 --> 00:56:12.700
which is disappointing.
Yes.
Go ahead and let's watch the end of this.
Yeah.

851
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:17.230
<v 20>Oh yeah.
Try and turn it on the remote.
Does it seem to work,</v>

852
00:56:17.231 --> 00:56:19.490
at least when I first tried it with turning down,

853
00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:23.390
it just cycles through the steps,
so,
oh,

854
00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.280
that's just a constant,

855
00:56:31.350 --> 00:56:35.770
that's even higher.
Yeah,
that's like a throbbing,

856
00:56:40.890 --> 00:56:44.420
I'm going to try out the sleep now and like I said,

857
00:56:44.421 --> 00:56:46.870
I'm really kind of disappointed that this won't be vibrating too,

858
00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:49.830
but I think this thing going off in my book do you like?
Yeah,

859
00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:54.670
it's going to be okay.
And this has some really weird knobbies.

860
00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:59.490
I mean inside there.
Okay.
All loving place.

861
00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:00.963
Awesome.

862
00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:03.493
<v 21>Okay.</v>

863
00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:05.420
<v 22>Really upset.</v>

864
00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:10.280
How much shit is he going to put on him and it his bought and in his deck.

865
00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:11.203
I mean,

866
00:57:11.370 --> 00:57:14.360
I keep waiting for it to end like how much shit are you going to put up your

867
00:57:14.361 --> 00:57:16.790
butt and around your deck and on Your Business?

868
00:57:16.791 --> 00:57:21.260
The last clip on your balls like really nicely.
No thanks.
I'm done.

869
00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:25.950
Well,
we gotta wait.
Hello?
I'm going to,
I can't take it.
My brain's overloading.

870
00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:26.320
Yeah.

871
00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:30.490
<v 20>Yeah.
I can't,
I'm out.
Whoa,
whoa.
Wow.
It's pretty tight.</v>

872
00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:34.990
I wasn't expecting that.
Oh,
that's cool.
Cool feature.

873
00:57:38.010 --> 00:57:43.000
Okay.
Dammit.
Oh,
oh fuck.
Oh fuck.
Fuck,

874
00:57:43.350 --> 00:57:46.710
fuck,
fuck,
fuck.
Ah,
ah,
ah

875
00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:49.390
damn.
It

876
00:57:56.830 --> 00:57:57.663
dammit.

877
00:57:57.890 --> 00:58:02.890
So I think that's what you call it ruined orgasm because I look at this cat and

878
00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:06.680
it felt really good and that thing was in my boat,

879
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:09.230
just set me off that wasn't expecting it.

880
00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:14.470
So I want to try this again with the vibrators.
Um,
the bullets.
Cool.

881
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:18.490
And then of course,
having a buddy to do it with me Sunday would be nice.

882
00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:21.500
Really fucking awesome.
Yeah.
Take care of you guys.
I hope you enjoyed that.

883
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:25.130
<v 22>We definitely enjoyed that.
Terry.
I don't know.
Fucking killed it,
Brian.</v>

884
00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:26.640
I think he needs a mattress too.

885
00:58:26.641 --> 00:58:31.641
It doesn't look like not in that apartment because he had me eat you the cat.

886
00:58:32.610 --> 00:58:36.270
Every,
everything is so fucked up,
baby.
Huh?
I really think

887
00:58:37.790 --> 00:58:41.980
God that,
I mean we've seen so much on the show.
Where does that right?

888
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.730
That was right over the limit,
but I think I'm,
that was
like,

889
00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:51.030
I think I've tapped out of the show.
What was the worst part?
Oh,

890
00:58:51.031 --> 00:58:55.410
all of it.
Like just watching him blow his load,
he was like,
oh,

891
00:58:55.411 --> 00:58:58.080
this is so great.
I'm like,
I'm going to call it God damn it.

892
00:58:59.850 --> 00:59:03.620
Why didn't you show me that?
Cause I thought I would do that.

893
00:59:05.850 --> 00:59:09.450
Don't you love me anymore?
Yeah,
of course you love me.
Yes,
of course.

894
00:59:09.451 --> 00:59:11.640
Why would you do this to me?
Because it was funny.

895
00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:15.780
It was funny to watch him and it was funny.
Or to watch you watch him.

896
00:59:16.350 --> 00:59:20.300
You're the worst.
I know how to make myself laugh.
Oh my God.

897
00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:21.980
That

898
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:26.120
<v 6>really,
that really for me,
hands down easily.
The highlight of 29</v>

899
00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:30.020
<v 3>yeah.
I feel like I need a nap.
Like I'm emotionally exhausted.
Me Too.</v>

900
00:59:30.021 --> 00:59:34.790
I haven't laughed that hard in a fucking wild.
Oh my God,
this is terrible.

901
00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:36.980
I wasn't gonna say we should show our guests,

902
00:59:36.981 --> 00:59:38.420
but I'm not sure she needs to see it.

903
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:43.510
<v 6>I think she would have loved to think we need to share it with another woman.</v>

904
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:48.170
She likes cool guys.
I think she likes to cool guys.

905
00:59:49.090 --> 00:59:52.460
Oh God.
Oh my God.
That was so cool.

906
00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:54.820
<v 3>The cat,
the cat was the best.</v>

907
00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:59.150
<v 6>The cat at the end.
Who doesn't know what the fuck is going on?</v>

908
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.983
What does that,

909
01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:10.370
what do you think that room smells like?
That room definitely has a funk to it.

910
01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:13.610
He's got a butt plug.
It smells,
you know what smells like?

911
01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:16.010
It smells like bleach in there cause he's probably always like,

912
01:00:16.570 --> 01:00:20.780
that guy probably had aids.
I don't know.
I'm going to clean this up for sure.

913
01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:24.320
There's problems in that room,
but he's also an outdoorsman.

914
01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.500
You actually need an emotional break.

915
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:32.980
Wow.
Wow.
I've never seen this

916
01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:33.863
<v 3>before.</v>

917
01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:38.210
Like something really trauma reaction.

918
01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:45.330
Like
when he changes on die,
die,
he pulled his legs up.

919
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:48.030
There is no worse position on a human man.

920
01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:49.030
<v 6>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

921
01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:53.300
<v 3>I think we've done it as a joke where you pull your legs back and I just pretend</v>

922
01:00:53.301 --> 01:00:55.760
to change it.
They get home is as a joke and it's so horrible.

923
01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:59.910
<v 6>I took a lot of battery.
It took a lot out of it.
I feel like we're like,</v>

924
01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:02.880
our work here is done.
And that was the Lord's work here in your mom's house?

925
01:01:02.970 --> 01:01:07.890
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh,
okay.
Oh yeah.
What a nightmare.

926
01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:11.640
Yeah,
it was really something,
man.
Oh God.

927
01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:17.910
I'm scarred and thanks Tommy.
And that was neat.
I've been wanting to,

928
01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.270
<v 3>you got your prostate exam coming up.</v>

929
01:01:20.271 --> 01:01:21.950
Do you think this was good preparation for that?

930
01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:27.710
<v 6>So,
yeah.
You know,
he really like,
we can't say his name.
No,
but,</v>

931
01:01:27.711 --> 01:01:30.890
um,
it's our doctor.
Yeah,
he really does.

932
01:01:30.891 --> 01:01:35.330
I've talked about them in my act before and specials Dr Deck.
Yeah,
he really is.

933
01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:39.920
And he really does do that.
He really did that last year to me,
the he,
he goes,

934
01:01:39.921 --> 01:01:44.510
um,
take a deep breath and I was like,
okay.
And you're,
the thing is,

935
01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:48.590
when that's happening to you,
it's never been done before.
Right.
So,

936
01:01:49.310 --> 01:01:54.110
um,
we mean your first time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The first process.
I've never had that.
Sure.

937
01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.630
You're,
you're really,
I mean,
you're naked,

938
01:01:56.990 --> 01:02:01.400
you're in the fetal position and you have this
almost,

939
01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:04.650
I wouldn't say you have shame,
but you're,
you know,
you're,

940
01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:08.960
it's almost like you're embarrassed a little bit and your,
um,
you just want,

941
01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:14.400
you want it to be over.
I know.
And you wish that,
um,

942
01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:19.550
every woman listening is like,
we go through this,
I get it.
The speculum pursuit.

943
01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:20.040
And then

944
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.970
<v 3>if you have children,
it's so demeaning.
That's it.
It feels kinds of meanings.</v>

945
01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:28.630
<v 0>I'm just staring at the wall and,
uh,
he's like,</v>

946
01:02:28.631 --> 01:02:32.920
I'm all right and take a deep breath.
I'm like,
okay.
And he's like,

947
01:02:32.921 --> 01:02:35.500
there's plenty of lube here.
I go,
okay.
And he goes,

948
01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:38.410
and you're just gonna feel slight pressure.

949
01:02:38.411 --> 01:02:43.330
That is my cock my finger too.
And I just start laughing.
I'm laughing.
Yeah.

950
01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:46.400
<v 3>As I'm his fingers clamping.
Yeah.</v>

951
01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:52.130
<v 0>And then he's like,
and when I,
when I,
what he's done,
he,</v>

952
01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:56.440
uh,
I still laughing.
I turned around to look at him and he goes,
uh,

953
01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.900
like he pretends that he's,
he switched hands.
He's like,
ah,

954
01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:05.830
<v 3>ridiculous.
So I'm sure he's really a fantastic doctor though.</v>

955
01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:10.850
<v 0>Yeah,
I know.
Um,
he is,
he has the best doc.
He's so thorough.</v>

956
01:03:11.530 --> 01:03:15.430
<v 3>Yeah.
No,
he really is.
I trust him more than I press it.
Any other doc?</v>

957
01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:20.400
<v 0>Yeah,
we've had,
but,
uh,
that,
that's very rude of him.
He's incredibly,</v>

958
01:03:20.550 --> 01:03:24.120
that's incredibly,
he has said the wildest shit to me.
I mean,

959
01:03:24.121 --> 01:03:26.340
things that I haven't said in my act,
you know,

960
01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:31.730
one time I saw him when I had a sinus infection and I still remember I was going

961
01:03:33.091 --> 01:03:36.840
to India,
I was going to play crackers in Indy and I get on,

962
01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:40.830
I get in his office and I'm like,
he checked me out.
He's like,
Oh yeah,
it's bad.

963
01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:43.950
You know,
you're,
you're,
you're sick.
And I go,

964
01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.480
that was that time where you're like,

965
01:03:45.481 --> 01:03:49.110
you put your little shows ahead of your health.
Yeah,
of course.
That was like,

966
01:03:49.111 --> 01:03:52.740
I have to get on this plane.
He was like,
you definitely shouldn't fly.
And I go,

967
01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:53.993
I'm flying.

968
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:59.610
Is there anything I can do to improve my chances?
And he goes,
yeah,

969
01:03:59.611 --> 01:04:03.990
yeah,
sit at a window seat and you'll sit on a window seat.
And he goes,
yeah,

970
01:04:03.991 --> 01:04:08.070
left window.
Excuse me.
I go,
why?

971
01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:13.290
He said,
well,
you have an infection in your left ear,

972
01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:17.950
so if you sit on your left window when your eardrum ruptures,

973
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:22.620
it will splatter all over the window.
And he just looks at me.
I'm like,

974
01:04:22.621 --> 01:04:23.454
what the fuck?

975
01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:28.100
<v 3>It's like,
well,
that's what you could do.
Yeah,
I go,
okay,
thanks.
Shit like that.</v>

976
01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:30.560
Yeah,
he's bright.
He's blunt cause he's right.
He's right.

977
01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:34.550
Of course he was right and that was one of the worst decisions I made to fly to

978
01:04:34.551 --> 01:04:39.340
fly or do those show.
Oh my God,
I know.
I know.
So,
so your,

979
01:04:39.350 --> 01:04:43.190
your drum did not rupture.
It did not rupture,
but I got really sick.
I know.

980
01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:45.320
It's terrible.
One time I got on a plane,

981
01:04:45.350 --> 01:04:48.680
I got the phone call that I had my urine tested and they're like,

982
01:04:48.681 --> 01:04:50.480
there's blood in your urine.
And I was like,
what?

983
01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:53.390
I got to get on this flight to San Francisco and I gotten that.

984
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:57.080
I did shows pes and blood and like,
what are we thinking?

985
01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:01.770
Like just to become comedians.
It's just,
you're terrified.
You're terrified.

986
01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:06.050
That $300 I get to get on this plane.
Yeah.
You're just so scared.

987
01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:11.120
But you're going to see him.
When is that?
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
Yeah.

988
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:15.140
What time is your exam?
All right.
Be Thinking about you.
Thanks.

989
01:05:15.141 --> 01:05:17.380
I have to get fat fingered.
Uh,

990
01:05:18.290 --> 01:05:20.620
<v 6>no.
You better eat your Mcdonald's now I'm going to here.</v>

991
01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:25.330
I'm going to have like six servings of Mcdonald's before I go to bed,
you know,

992
01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:29.440
so that I'm nice and stuff for my physical

993
01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:34.450
like that.
Uh,

994
01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:37.420
he's going to like hearing that you're on a Mcdonald's diet and be like,

995
01:05:37.421 --> 01:05:40.330
I don't really have a choice man.
It's Mcdonald's time,
you know,

996
01:05:41.610 --> 01:05:45.940
so it's the new sponsor,
the new sponsor,

997
01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:50.560
and we couldn't be more thrilled.
Um,
oh,
worthy.

998
01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:52.750
A homeowner's nation.
Sorry.
No,
go ahead.
Go ahead.

999
01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:55.330
I was going to tell you that over the holiday,

1000
01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:56.071
<v 3>you know,</v>

1001
01:05:56.071 --> 01:06:01.050
in La we have what's called the Rose Parade and we were hanging out at the

1002
01:06:01.051 --> 01:06:04.350
house.
We didn't do much this Christmas holiday.
We've got two little children,

1003
01:06:04.351 --> 01:06:06.200
so we just stayed home and farted around.

1004
01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:07.870
<v 6>But uh,
you know,</v>

1005
01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:11.530
<v 3>I,
I,
we were in the house and I jokingly was like,
Oh,
you know,</v>

1006
01:06:11.531 --> 01:06:13.870
we haven't done today's watch,
the Rose Parade,

1007
01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:18.160
because that is one of the most fucking boring things.
It's like,

1008
01:06:18.161 --> 01:06:23.161
it takes place in Pasadena every year and people line up and spend the night,

1009
01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:28.980
like nights on end to see the fucking floats go by.

1010
01:06:29.021 --> 01:06:32.860
And I've seen the floats on close.
They're really nice like it is.
I understand.

1011
01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:35.260
Unbelievable.
If they choose to do that,

1012
01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:38.860
well that's what she's slapping cause you're like,
oh my God,

1013
01:06:38.861 --> 01:06:43.270
that sounds like the worst thing ever.
Hands down the thing.

1014
01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:47.080
I think if I were to make a list of things that I find the dumbest,

1015
01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:51.430
least appealing to me,
this would be in the top three too.
Yeah.

1016
01:06:51.610 --> 01:06:56.440
I would rather go to like Lala Palooza.
Yeah.
Fucking Coachella at burning man.

1017
01:06:56.441 --> 01:06:56.640
Yeah.

1018
01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:00.660
<v 6>All those things.
There was a village I saw of a Coachella show,</v>

1019
01:07:00.661 --> 01:07:05.640
I think it was last year that had upwards of 250,000 people.

1020
01:07:05.641 --> 01:07:08.040
That one of the shows.
I'm like,
oh that's,
that seems cool.

1021
01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.510
Like to have a quarter million people around you.

1022
01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:15.610
<v 3>Well how do you take a piss and they're all drinking beer piss right there.</v>

1023
01:07:15.611 --> 01:07:18.670
What do you mean?
How do you know for sure they do it just piss right.

1024
01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:22.540
You know how much piss and shit is probably on the grounds of those things.

1025
01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:25.750
Well at burning man more dignified.
Little bit,
but then,

1026
01:07:25.810 --> 01:07:30.100
but where do they pissing and shitting in the dye dyes that were Dido's look at

1027
01:07:30.101 --> 01:07:33.580
this lunatic,
these psychos.
And I'm not,
I'm sorry to say it.
God,

1028
01:07:33.581 --> 01:07:34.230
I hope you don't mind.

1029
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:36.210
<v 6>You're not upset,
but there's a,</v>

1030
01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:39.260
there's a lot of chicks out there that lead the way,
right?

1031
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:41.670
<v 3>Cues are really are.
No,
no,
no.
Really.</v>

1032
01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:46.380
I don't understand why everyone wants a fucking stupid.
Okay.
Can we not start?

1033
01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:52.020
That's the last thing we need.
Yeah,
no,
no.
This is,
this is,
this is universal.

1034
01:07:52.021 --> 01:07:56.490
These are idiots everywhere.
Men and women know they are to see floats.
I mean,

1035
01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:58.080
I couldn't think of anything worse.

1036
01:07:58.390 --> 01:08:02.040
Three days and in the cold they're doing this shit over Christmas.

1037
01:08:02.041 --> 01:08:02.930
It gets cold at night

1038
01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:07.070
<v 6>there.
Yeah,
very,
very cold.
I mean,
it's,
um,
yeah,</v>

1039
01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:10.900
<v 3>I can't think of anything I care about that much to spend the night for,</v>

1040
01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:13.330
you know,
even people that do that for black Friday sales,

1041
01:08:13.331 --> 01:08:17.330
they sleep out on the sidewalk for like nights before.
It's crazy.

1042
01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:18.770
It's totally crazy.

1043
01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:23.860
Is there anything in this world you get 10% off more if you sleep outside

1044
01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:27.750
tonight?
Yeah.
Like,

1045
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:33.370
but thinking about how memorable broke by the way roque wanting things and just

1046
01:08:34.461 --> 01:08:36.650
been like,
I guess it's not for me

1047
01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:39.830
and now the people are like,

1048
01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:43.100
oh all I had to do sleep outside on the sidewalk overnight.

1049
01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:47.870
Oh you get 20% off.
Yeah.
Okay.

1050
01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:51.890
Thinking about the misery of sitting outside in the dark and the cold.

1051
01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:54.500
There's nothing on this planet.
Like if someone said,
look,

1052
01:08:54.501 --> 01:08:57.080
your children's lives depend on that and be like,
yeah,
absolutely.

1053
01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:59.210
But short of that and they don't,

1054
01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:03.020
there's nothing in the world that can make me do and that parade shit.

1055
01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:06.890
Like what do you get out of that?
The what?
Will you sleep when you sleep outside?

1056
01:09:06.891 --> 01:09:07.930
Correct.
No,

1057
01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:12.960
I got front row as the people walk by and people will wave at us and then we get

1058
01:09:15.681 --> 01:09:20.630
to see the float and then you ever watch channel seven news,

1059
01:09:21.690 --> 01:09:25.040
the guy and the girl to do that.
They'll be right there too.

1060
01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:30.080
What the fuck is wrong with you nailed it.
That's exactly what they want.

1061
01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:32.470
It's like then and then waving,

1062
01:09:33.230 --> 01:09:37.640
then they wave and you can wave.
Last year,
you know,
uh,

1063
01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:41.960
Cheryl for channel five,
she waved.
She waved right at me.
Okay.

1064
01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:46.970
Is that a good time?
And it's like you've got television,
you can see it on TV.

1065
01:09:46.971 --> 01:09:47.511
You don't have to,

1066
01:09:47.511 --> 01:09:52.040
you mean like in a high def and with cutaways and you sit on your couch and you

1067
01:09:52.041 --> 01:09:56.990
drink a fucking hot cocoa.
Have a hot dog or the newer house,

1068
01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:00.830
Macy's Thanksgiving parade.
People stand for that shit too.

1069
01:10:00.831 --> 01:10:03.200
I can't imagine anything.
We'll talk about those pieces of shit.

1070
01:10:03.201 --> 01:10:06.440
They go to times square for New Year's.
Fuck.
You know,

1071
01:10:06.710 --> 01:10:11.510
the absolute and how regs of humanity,
if we have a plague,

1072
01:10:11.511 --> 01:10:15.740
we should drop it in Times Square and wipe those people first.

1073
01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:19.400
That's who dies first.
Yeah.
Well,
and especially because in June,
Dork titties,

1074
01:10:19.401 --> 01:10:24.330
it's so cold.
I mean,
could you imagine a worse place in the country to be out at

1075
01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:30.630
midnight on New Year's Eve?
You out of your fucking mind.
It's really crazy.

1076
01:10:30.631 --> 01:10:34.400
You to be out of your fucking mind.
You know when I was there I saw,

1077
01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:37.210
yeah,
that's right.

1078
01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:44.300
True.
It is true.
When I was in judo titties at the beginning of December,

1079
01:10:44.301 --> 01:10:49.301
they had the stupid thing where it's like a Santa's pub crawl and I saw all

1080
01:10:49.371 --> 01:10:52.510
these idiot frat boys dressed up as Santa says,

1081
01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:56.930
and the girls dressed up as Elvis and they just go bar hopping or whatever and

1082
01:10:56.931 --> 01:11:00.010
they're all in the middle of the fucking day.
How fucking stupid is that one too?

1083
01:11:00.150 --> 01:11:00.920
I mean,

1084
01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:05.920
I met a kill my way that people like the creativity that people would need as an

1085
01:11:05.961 --> 01:11:09.050
excuse to drink.
Oh,
I know.
It's down to,
it's like,
just have a fucking drink.

1086
01:11:09.051 --> 01:11:13.980
You could do it any day dog part of the festival.
It's a,
it's a 10 K and you

1087
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:17.920
<v 6>got to drink it like,
dude,
just,
just drink to get drunk.
You know,</v>

1088
01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:22.080
you're an adult and you can get hammered at all times or times.
You should,

1089
01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:26.120
if that's,
if that's what you're thinking about you,
you should,
yeah,

1090
01:11:26.130 --> 01:11:29.220
you should go to times square.
You should fucking live there.
And I get drunk.

1091
01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:32.730
Well you think Bert ever asks himself,
do I deserve this beer now?

1092
01:11:32.731 --> 01:11:37.320
He just drinks and all the time,
all day,
all day,
every day.
There's never a no.

1093
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:41.640
It was never,
there's never the thought I shouldn't drink.
Is there a big Mac?

1094
01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:46.470
Absolutely.
All the time.
Of course.
You need them whenever I want.
Yeah,
of course,

1095
01:11:46.471 --> 01:11:49.740
man.
You got it.
Thanks to our sponsor,
our great,

1096
01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:52.030
great sponsor.
Mcdonald's.

1097
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:59.690
Yes.
Okay.
What'd you rather and I'm being serious.
Yeah,

1098
01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:04.230
it's burning man or,

1099
01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:10.410
or New Year's Eve in Times Square.
Which of the two?
Okay.
Fuck.

1100
01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.650
I think I,
I hate the heat more than the cold,

1101
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:19.200
but I think that would have to take new years.
Serious.
I think so.
Yeah.
I think,

1102
01:12:19.230 --> 01:12:21.150
I think so.
I'm trying to,
I mean,

1103
01:12:21.151 --> 01:12:26.150
I like music more than I like a fucking crystal ball dropping boring.

1104
01:12:26.151 --> 01:12:30.480
But the idea of being with those people,
music festival really,
really?

1105
01:12:31.450 --> 01:12:34.340
Now I know somebody who goes,
I know a couple people that go to these cylons.

1106
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:38.940
Yeah.
Like regular,
like art and Arrigo.
Arie likes those kinds of things.

1107
01:12:38.970 --> 01:12:42.510
He goes to a,
what's the Tennessee one?
Bonnaroo.
Yeah.

1108
01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:44.880
Another horrible nightmare is when they're like,
you know,

1109
01:12:44.881 --> 01:12:46.880
they have a comedy tent and you can,

1110
01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:49.920
you can get booked and you can go to all the shows for free.

1111
01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:54.180
And I'm like [inaudible].
You could also just inject heroin into my asshole.

1112
01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:56.370
I could just pass out where I'm sitting right now.

1113
01:12:56.890 --> 01:13:01.830
Especially when you hear things like the comedy tent comedy should never be done

1114
01:13:01.831 --> 01:13:04.500
in a tent.
I've done it a few times.
I don't like it outdoors.
Nope,

1115
01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:08.770
I don't like it intense and I don't like it on a music festival.
No.

1116
01:13:09.090 --> 01:13:11.310
Matter of fact,
I don't even like it at a comedy festival.

1117
01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:15.810
I like shows and then I like to leave.
I hate,
you know,

1118
01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:20.580
my fucking what I hate the most about a comedy festival when they go,
uh,

1119
01:13:20.581 --> 01:13:24.210
it's a great hang though.
I'm like a great hang and they're like,
yeah,
you like,

1120
01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:28.470
you can hang out with all the other comics.
I'm like,
yeah,

1121
01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:31.020
I could do that whenever I want.
I'm actually like,

1122
01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:33.810
I can pick the ones I want to hang out with.
I have this phone,

1123
01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:37.800
I can text like people I like,
like,
oh yeah,

1124
01:13:37.801 --> 01:13:40.900
you go to the festival and you could hang out with everyone.
Right.

1125
01:13:41.490 --> 01:13:44.940
Here's the deal man though about your choice now.
New Year's Eve.
Yeah.

1126
01:13:44.941 --> 01:13:49.500
It's one night with drunk idiots essentially.
Yeah.
Burning man.

1127
01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:53.340
It's over the stretch.
Let's say a week at burning man.
Yes,
it's hot,

1128
01:13:54.570 --> 01:13:57.480
but there's like burning man.
That's okay.

1129
01:13:57.481 --> 01:14:00.030
I thought it was talking about it compared to a music that's not a music

1130
01:14:00.031 --> 01:14:02.490
festival.
No burning man.
It's like dirty hippies.

1131
01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:05.220
And then you're saying that versus,

1132
01:14:05.850 --> 01:14:09.540
it's like a bunch of computer nerds who once a year they go to burning man.

1133
01:14:09.541 --> 01:14:12.340
They do a bunch of drugs and then they make floats

1134
01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:15.160
<v 3>and they ride bicycles half and they're like,</v>

1135
01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:19.840
have an orgasm contest and then like nasty people eat each other out in the
dirt.

1136
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:21.010
It's on Applia.

1137
01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:25.960
So the sand is very sticky and it's unhygienic and there's,
you know,

1138
01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:28.980
you have to use Porta potties to shit and piss and,
okay.
Right.

1139
01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:29.913
I think I'm decided.

1140
01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:36.280
So in New York you're still going to do Jews or Katie rule that.
Yeah man,

1141
01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:40.720
of course.
Okay.
Yeah.
Terrible.
What about,

1142
01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:45.000
well hold on,
let me just think.

1143
01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:50.040
Would you rather do burning man or you sit and wait for the Rose Parade and

1144
01:14:52.601 --> 01:14:52.840
that's a,

1145
01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:55.900
it's it's a week waiting for the rose praying week cause you have to do a

1146
01:14:55.901 --> 01:14:58.870
weekend either climate.
Either get the fuck out of here.

1147
01:14:58.871 --> 01:15:02.100
It's a week at burning man or a week waiting for the Rose Parade.

1148
01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:06.220
Those good and see how many people I could get pregnant.
I would just be like,

1149
01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:11.580
let's see if I'm in like I have tests at the end of the tube and if you got

1150
01:15:12.131 --> 01:15:16.410
pregnant like that,
that's easy.
That's easy.
Yeah.

1151
01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:20.580
They have to wear them and they have to wear their,
their crop top.

1152
01:15:20.581 --> 01:15:24.240
So I'll be like,
you're the sluts.
Okay.
Yeah.

1153
01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:28.510
Why don't choose burning man.
You would as much as I am feeding them in there.

1154
01:15:28.511 --> 01:15:32.500
Like a fucking real SLU team.
Not as a,
as a show I worked on,

1155
01:15:32.501 --> 01:15:35.740
I worked on a television show.
We filmed there,
I swear to God I would do it.

1156
01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:38.950
Aim here.
What was the show called?

1157
01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:43.030
The show is called the hitchhiker chronicles on Fx.

1158
01:15:43.031 --> 01:15:47.980
It was the lead and show to hurt bird actually before I was friends with Bert

1159
01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:52.660
Kreischer.
Wow.
And we picked up hitchhikers when we did Bernie under 300 pounds.

1160
01:15:52.661 --> 01:15:55.030
When that show,
those are his skinny,
he's lean days.

1161
01:15:56.050 --> 01:15:58.810
You would really check the would take,
why would you take a week there?

1162
01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:01.390
I don't like the cold,
the cold cold.

1163
01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:05.770
And I can just imagine the inane conversations I'd be having on the parade
trail.

1164
01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.720
Here's the thing,
I could also get really high.

1165
01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:12.260
You have to fight on the parade trail.
Just like shut down and just,
you know,

1166
01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:15.910
let my eyes roll back and like wake up a couple of days later.

1167
01:16:15.911 --> 01:16:17.560
Like what's going on with your,
I like,
Yo,
what happened?

1168
01:16:17.710 --> 01:16:20.950
Well it's Thursday and like,
Oh shit,
there's the parade's about to start.

1169
01:16:21.190 --> 01:16:23.920
Yeah man,
you're just laying in your own piss.
You've been like this for days.

1170
01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:27.220
But she could do that at burning man and stay warm.

1171
01:16:27.221 --> 01:16:30.380
Can I get my little tent though?
Like they do.
Some people have tests.

1172
01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:32.770
I do the little tent thing,

1173
01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:38.590
but you have to send up packet for Mcdonald's and sleeping bags,

1174
01:16:39.010 --> 01:16:42.680
but you have to have a chair.
You know how they have their beach chairs too?

1175
01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:48.240
I would have a tent and I would have like my chair and my foot and then I would

1176
01:16:49.331 --> 01:16:53.920
have hardcore porn plan on it so that people would start to spread away from my

1177
01:16:53.921 --> 01:16:57.910
tent.
She get a little more space that would happen to burning man.

1178
01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:00.940
They'd be like,
oh,
that guy is just Jackie Knauf.
Yeah,
let's get a space.

1179
01:17:00.970 --> 01:17:03.750
I don't think.
I think they'd be,
well,
let's hang out with in Pasadena.

1180
01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:08.200
They'd be like,
call the police.
Great.
I love to get out of here.

1181
01:17:08.201 --> 01:17:09.034
Take me to jail.

1182
01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:11.720
<v 22>That's my a way out of this.</v>

1183
01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:15.230
They don't tolerate that monkey business and Pasadena.
No,
they don't.
They don't.

1184
01:17:15.250 --> 01:17:18.240
They don't.
Um,
why don't we take a quick break again?
No,

1185
01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:22.400
our guest is going to arrive,
so eat a filet of fish.
Yeah,
of course.
I'm again,

1186
01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:24.610
once again,
of course.
Thanks to uh,

1187
01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:27.950
are great friends and our sponsors at Mcdonald's

1188
01:17:32.150 --> 01:17:36.350
and we're back after that much needed break,
everybody peed.

1189
01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:41.800
And now we are joined by a comedian and also a fellow degenerate.

1190
01:17:44.210 --> 01:17:46.610
You mean comedian?

1191
01:17:47.590 --> 01:17:52.460
A lovely and delightful comedian lady.
A lady comic.

1192
01:17:52.461 --> 01:17:57.080
Everybody a glitter cheese herself is a trigger.
Everybody,

1193
01:17:58.910 --> 01:18:02.780
thank you for coming.
Thank you.
But when people introduce you for spots,

1194
01:18:02.781 --> 01:18:06.650
do they sometimes say I'm despicable or deplorable?

1195
01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:10.040
People say all weird words.
Can't remember.
Degender Hep.

1196
01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:15.380
They say you're from your mom's home,
and then they just go from Netflix.

1197
01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:19.500
I think that's probably easier.
I had a guy,
a drunk guy in the lobby go,
uh,

1198
01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:24.530
he goes,
oh,
like I was walking through the lobby and San Diego.
He goes,
go,
hey.

1199
01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:29.570
He goes,
dude,
don't tell me.
And I go,
okay.
He's like,
I'm drunk.

1200
01:18:29.571 --> 01:18:33.740
I go,
okay.
He goes,
mom's pot house.

1201
01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:38.690
That's it.
It's mom's pot house.
Or we had that lady who was like,
Oh my God,

1202
01:18:38.691 --> 01:18:41.960
I'm obsessed with you guys.
I watch you every day.

1203
01:18:43.730 --> 01:18:47.210
Day.
Yeah.
When people compliment you and then they're like,

1204
01:18:47.211 --> 01:18:51.320
what's your name though?
Do you get recognized every day?

1205
01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:56.440
He does a lot.
Just depends where you are though,
you know,
like,
um,

1206
01:18:57.140 --> 01:18:59.750
first of all sometimes you're like,
oh no.
Then you realize like,
oh,

1207
01:18:59.751 --> 01:19:03.920
we were home all day today.
So,
uh,
but I think like high population areas,

1208
01:19:03.921 --> 01:19:06.320
you know,
if you go to,
once you start traveling,

1209
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:10.040
like if we're in or it's like we're in like a Beverly hills,

1210
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:14.420
like in the center of activity,
there's so many people.

1211
01:19:14.421 --> 01:19:18.200
It's like being at an airport.
So you,
you know,
recognize more.
They're obviously,

1212
01:19:18.230 --> 01:19:22.730
but shopping
and Jude are titties.
That's where you live.

1213
01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:26.510
Do people recognize you a lot from the show?
From now?
Degenerates.

1214
01:19:27.010 --> 01:19:28.160
Just once in a while.

1215
01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:31.520
It's usually like a fun gal that's on par from New York though too.

1216
01:19:31.521 --> 01:19:35.960
I feel like New York's not going to be like [inaudible] recently in San

1217
01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:38.720
Francisco with a friend and her friends came to meet us and they couldn't

1218
01:19:38.721 --> 01:19:41.480
believe I was there and they were like,
you really know each other.

1219
01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:45.500
And that felt kind of fun.
That's cool.
Um,
so she was happy.

1220
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:50.000
We have mutual friends,
but it might say I live in crown heights and um,

1221
01:19:50.001 --> 01:19:52.850
in the past couple of months through the carbon monoxide alarm has gone off

1222
01:19:52.851 --> 01:19:55.650
three times.
And the landlords being kind of a bitch about it.

1223
01:19:55.651 --> 01:19:58.010
It won't fix him getting defensive and yelling and the plumber,

1224
01:19:58.011 --> 01:20:01.730
it keeps fixing stuff,
but it keeps going off.
There's poisonous gases.

1225
01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:04.580
We found out the building next door had squatters.

1226
01:20:04.581 --> 01:20:08.570
They broke into our basement and set up generators and so those,

1227
01:20:08.610 --> 01:20:10.800
so the landlord was being not so nice,

1228
01:20:10.801 --> 01:20:13.830
but she was also like nothing is wrong with the building.
And I'm like,
you're,

1229
01:20:14.190 --> 01:20:16.020
I'm going to complain,
I'm taking you to court.

1230
01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:20.400
And then I just found out that it was squatters with generators,

1231
01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:22.770
cheese,
people squat,

1232
01:20:22.771 --> 01:20:26.610
people who don't have a place.
Yes.

1233
01:20:26.730 --> 01:20:31.290
We're able to get into a building.
Yeah.
And Hook up a generator.

1234
01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:33.930
Yeah.
And then live in the building next door and then,

1235
01:20:34.090 --> 01:20:36.370
and they're powering it from your,
from the gender.

1236
01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:38.440
And then there was a gas leak upstairs.

1237
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:43.470
So basically just almost murdering us for months also speaks to the ingenuity of

1238
01:20:44.611 --> 01:20:48.030
New Yorkers.
And I'm going to stay in the apartment.

1239
01:20:48.031 --> 01:20:51.030
Like that to me was the best case scenario then it wasn't the building's

1240
01:20:51.031 --> 01:20:52.830
problems.
So I'm like what did they do?
Nothing.

1241
01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:55.110
They finally kick these people out.
Well No,
the cops were just like,

1242
01:20:55.111 --> 01:20:57.720
cause I was on a plane and the neighbor called me.
He's like,
guess what?

1243
01:20:57.721 --> 01:20:59.700
This is this happened.
And uh,

1244
01:21:00.330 --> 01:21:02.700
they said the squatters might come back to watch out.

1245
01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:06.570
They can't guarantee the squatters won't come back.
Now here's a great generator.

1246
01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:07.920
He I think got rid of it,

1247
01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:11.130
but that didn't break my door down cause I was at the airport on a plane.

1248
01:21:11.130 --> 01:21:15.630
So they broke my door down,
gotten to the basement and found the generators.

1249
01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:19.260
Did you do you know in La,
by the way,
in the state of California,

1250
01:21:19.261 --> 01:21:23.760
the squatters have rights and there's like a protocol to kicking them out.

1251
01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:26.100
You can't just be like,
get the fuck out of my property.

1252
01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:31.220
I also would just not want to ever be a landlord was learning about like how it

1253
01:21:31.411 --> 01:21:36.060
varies state to state,
but you can rent to somebody and they can just be like,

1254
01:21:36.061 --> 01:21:40.530
I'm in certain states,
I'm not paying,
I'm not paying you.

1255
01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:45.630
And then the process to a victim can be like,
yeah,
fuck yeah,

1256
01:21:45.631 --> 01:21:49.980
but most landlords aren't good people.
Really?
Yeah.
Maybe that's in New York.

1257
01:21:50.370 --> 01:21:52.890
Yeah.
Cause my other one,
he wouldn't give me my deposit,

1258
01:21:52.891 --> 01:21:55.860
but like I told him the heat wasn't working and he came back with a device and

1259
01:21:55.861 --> 01:21:59.640
like he was like,
I don't know,
it's fine.
I'm like,
I'm wearing a coat inside.

1260
01:21:59.641 --> 01:22:01.320
Like I don't know.
They don't,

1261
01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:06.210
they think that people are trying to scam them and it's like I'm just cold or

1262
01:22:06.211 --> 01:22:10.860
there's just monoxide,
like I just don't want to die.
She kept being like,

1263
01:22:10.861 --> 01:22:13.800
the plumber said it's safe,
the fire department said it's fine,

1264
01:22:13.801 --> 01:22:17.640
why would it's fine.
And I go,
it's just not worth the risk.
I don't know.

1265
01:22:17.641 --> 01:22:20.320
And she's like,
just stay there.
And then I'm glad I did.

1266
01:22:20.321 --> 01:22:23.700
And they went to a friend's house and then the next day was full,

1267
01:22:23.701 --> 01:22:25.620
like left the carbon monoxide levels.

1268
01:22:25.621 --> 01:22:30.360
We're at 35 and they should be zero woo.
And I was just sleeping there.

1269
01:22:30.361 --> 01:22:33.840
I've been sleeping with windows open all winter cause I'm just so terrified of

1270
01:22:33.841 --> 01:22:37.890
dying.
That's terrible.
Yeah.
I moved to La.
I can't yet.

1271
01:22:38.190 --> 01:22:40.950
We're not done with the New York,
New York.
It's just too far.

1272
01:22:40.990 --> 01:22:44.430
And I come here enough that when we met,
we met in Chicago and Peoria,

1273
01:22:45.330 --> 01:22:49.200
Peoria at the jukebox.
Then we did Schomburg together.
I,

1274
01:22:49.410 --> 01:22:52.440
my friend opened for you.
I just came to watch.
Yes,

1275
01:22:53.190 --> 01:22:57.930
but we've talked about the clock.
Yeah.

1276
01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:00.540
What's the neatest part?

1277
01:23:00.541 --> 01:23:04.170
Is that when you're doing your show the dirt track gears up and then you can

1278
01:23:04.171 --> 01:23:07.530
hear the cars unless you're killin.

1279
01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:13.150
No one's really there though.
That's part of the club too.
There's no one there.

1280
01:23:13.151 --> 01:23:16.090
And he punches holes in the wall.
Yeah,
he's wild.

1281
01:23:16.091 --> 01:23:19.390
But I do have like these fantasies of like making it big and going back to

1282
01:23:19.391 --> 01:23:22.310
Peoria and being like,
I'm going to sell out for you.
But yeah,

1283
01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:26.920
you want to a part of me.
Is that all about we know.
I don't know.

1284
01:23:26.970 --> 01:23:30.670
You all show you piece of shit.
No,
not in a bad way at all.

1285
01:23:30.671 --> 01:23:32.700
It's just like wild to see.
He,

1286
01:23:32.910 --> 01:23:36.160
he won't book like Youtube Stars because of integrity and I'm like,

1287
01:23:36.161 --> 01:23:39.220
just get them in here.
Yeah.
Sell the speech.
He's like,

1288
01:23:39.221 --> 01:23:43.330
should I have the real housewife on?
I'm like,
have her here sell tickets.

1289
01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:46.330
Well it's also like don't,
yeah,
don't judge it.
If people like it,

1290
01:23:46.331 --> 01:23:50.530
it's entertainment.
Who gives a shit?
Just do it.
Yes sir.
I'll get my space here.

1291
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:54.490
It's so fucking cold in here.
Are you cold?
Okay.
For right now.

1292
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:57.550
I'll probably put my denim on where you are.
You from there though?
No,

1293
01:23:57.551 --> 01:24:01.030
I'm from the Chicago suburbs.
Yeah,
that's what I thought.
Stokey oh,

1294
01:24:01.330 --> 01:24:06.070
very Jewy known for Nazi marches.
KKK marches.
Oh,
we have a good library.

1295
01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:09.610
So it's a nice blend of Jews in Nazi marches.
Yeah.

1296
01:24:09.611 --> 01:24:12.550
The Nazis used to come all the time cause I had the biggest population of Jews

1297
01:24:12.551 --> 01:24:15.310
outside of Israel.
And then when I was in school,

1298
01:24:15.311 --> 01:24:18.340
the KKK would march and then we'd have discussions in school about freedom of

1299
01:24:18.341 --> 01:24:22.530
speech.
I love boy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Kind of supercharges yesterday.

1300
01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:25.090
It was a diverse neighborhood.
It was fun.

1301
01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:28.740
So now you also mentioned that you're going to do the AVN awards.
Yes.

1302
01:24:28.810 --> 01:24:29.643
What are you going to do?

1303
01:24:30.830 --> 01:24:31.663
<v 23>Hello?</v>

1304
01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:38.690
<v 22>Can you tell who that is?
As a Ramone?
Namar no.
Wow.
Okay.</v>

1305
01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:42.940
That's really specific for men.
Know who has those Rocco's if ready.

1306
01:24:43.610 --> 01:24:47.320
You're,
you're familiar.
Yeah.
Would you like to watch this documentary?
Of course.

1307
01:24:47.321 --> 01:24:51.610
Yeah.
I did.
Annabella dangers in it.
Who is one of my faves.
Yeah.

1308
01:24:52.150 --> 01:24:56.860
Um,
but he's a Weirdo.
Yeah.
I mean he's like creep.
He's a demon.
He's a dean.

1309
01:24:56.870 --> 01:25:00.490
He is a sexy piece is kids are like 17 and they're like,
Dad,

1310
01:25:01.450 --> 01:25:05.920
are you going to stop
now?
It's your turn to the point.
They're like,

1311
01:25:06.130 --> 01:25:10.690
we don't want to do,
they'll,
a lot of them have kids.
It's a lot.

1312
01:25:11.050 --> 01:25:14.200
That's why I asked.
Once you have kids,
you start thinking about that.
You're like,

1313
01:25:14.201 --> 01:25:18.100
what the fuck?
Well,
cause I'm even nervous about our boys watching this show.

1314
01:25:18.190 --> 01:25:19.840
Yeah,
yeah.
I want a decade or so.

1315
01:25:19.841 --> 01:25:23.960
But could you imagine doing pornography and his kids?
Like they,

1316
01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:28.590
they're at that age,
they know that their dad doesn't just have sex.
Yeah.

1317
01:25:28.770 --> 01:25:32.410
But that he is the step on girls' necks.
Yeah.

1318
01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:37.180
Put toes in their ass is and just like go to like he is the,

1319
01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:40.030
he's the sex Satan basically.
No,
I,

1320
01:25:40.031 --> 01:25:43.120
that's one of my pet peeve porn pet peeves is when there's like a random foot,

1321
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:45.700
I don't like it.
Yeah.
I don't like a foot in the mouth.

1322
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.990
All of a sudden someone's looking at toe like I don't need to warn.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1323
01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:53.770
I have a few pet peeves,
but that's okay.
I got some shit.
What's your,

1324
01:25:53.771 --> 01:25:56.620
I don't like grundle shots.
What's that like from the back?

1325
01:25:56.621 --> 01:26:00.770
What the ball's waving.
Like I don't want to see man butts.
I agree with napping.

1326
01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:05.710
I don't want to see that.
And I don't like when it's like a giant gaping,
but,

1327
01:26:05.711 --> 01:26:10.580
and you can look inside.
I don't like,

1328
01:26:10.610 --> 01:26:13.010
uh,
yeah,
the gate.
I don't like the gaping butts either.

1329
01:26:13.011 --> 01:26:15.280
I got to tell you when they're like,
look,

1330
01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:18.380
and then it starts to just feel like surgery.

1331
01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:23.660
Mattamy it becomes,
yeah,
it shifts from any type of sexual thing to like,

1332
01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:25.820
that's what it looks like in there.
It's it.
Same thing.

1333
01:26:25.821 --> 01:26:28.980
Like I don't want to see a camera go down into the throat.
Oh Wow.

1334
01:26:29.070 --> 01:26:31.400
That's my pet peeve is the choking.

1335
01:26:31.401 --> 01:26:35.390
Gagging just doesn't feel voluntary a lot to me.

1336
01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:39.410
We got to face fucking,
is that what that's called?
Yeah.
I don't like that.

1337
01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:43.850
You always into porn?
No.
Um,

1338
01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:46.760
but as a grown up,
like I would say in my twenties,

1339
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:50.450
that's why I don't think it fucked with my brain too much out there.

1340
01:26:50.451 --> 01:26:51.284
Cause that's when,

1341
01:26:51.330 --> 01:26:56.030
that's when I started really tart kink dot coms like my favorite.

1342
01:26:56.900 --> 01:27:00.860
But I know all right.
Is that fetish stuff?
Yeah.
What's the,
what are you into?

1343
01:27:00.861 --> 01:27:03.550
My favorite channel is public disgrace.
What's that?

1344
01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:07.910
My therapist has ruined everything for me.
But uh,
well yeah,

1345
01:27:07.911 --> 01:27:12.860
she said it's our brain takes trauma from our youth and makes it fantasy and

1346
01:27:12.890 --> 01:27:17.610
that's like why we're into what we're into,
which is upsetting.
Um,

1347
01:27:18.170 --> 01:27:23.030
but she's like,
no,
it's,
our brain is magical.
But I'm like,
no,
it's like sad that,

1348
01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:26.660
but I like when they take like a girl and there's like a dominatrix girl and

1349
01:27:26.661 --> 01:27:30.920
then everyone kind of fucks her at a bar and like passes her and I,

1350
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:32.880
they pour beer on her.
That's interesting.
See

1351
01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:39.500
public disgrace.
I could kick a guy in the nuts and feel good about that.

1352
01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:42.550
Like those videos where the guy gets kicked him.
Like I could do that easy piece.

1353
01:27:42.770 --> 01:27:46.850
Um,
yeah.
I for a girl needs to be degraded,
but I can't just have men around.

1354
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:50.720
Like there needs to be a female in charge.
Yes,
that makes sense to me too.

1355
01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:55.820
I don't like lesbian porn.
I think for me,
well I'm kind of newly sort of gay.

1356
01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:59.080
I had an ex girlfriend and I think I'm getting,

1357
01:27:59.081 --> 01:28:03.620
so I dated a girl like maybe a year and a half ago for about six months.

1358
01:28:03.621 --> 01:28:06.410
I got dumped.
It ruined my life.
That's what I started therapy.

1359
01:28:06.770 --> 01:28:09.020
But I think I'm more gay than I ever anticipated.

1360
01:28:09.170 --> 01:28:11.810
So I want to find a girlfriend and because I'm new to it,

1361
01:28:11.811 --> 01:28:13.670
I've been watching and learning from.

1362
01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:18.080
And you're saying you're not interested in men at all at this point because all,

1363
01:28:18.081 --> 01:28:21.380
but I would like a wife,
but I'm not,

1364
01:28:21.381 --> 01:28:25.460
not like I find men hot sometimes.
Oh,
well that's good.
Uh,

1365
01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:26.720
I would fuck a dude.

1366
01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:31.100
I feel like I can't see myself ending up with a guy bisexual though right now.

1367
01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:33.950
I think so,
yeah.
I'm open.
I want to be like,
I want to be in love.

1368
01:28:33.951 --> 01:28:37.080
I want to find a partner.
I want to be married.
I wanted that for us.

1369
01:28:37.170 --> 01:28:39.230
That's what I walk signing.
You should.
Yeah.

1370
01:28:45.050 --> 01:28:47.690
No,
I don't.
Polyamory is like losers to me.

1371
01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:54.740
I don't like the word.
I don't like the,
like I don't,
it's just like I want love.

1372
01:28:55.070 --> 01:28:58.490
I want to be married and have like a dog.
But you're definitely,

1373
01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:02.010
from what I'm hearing,
I really like dating a girl.

1374
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:05.640
<v 6>You're channeling the energy towards women.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like on the dating Apps,</v>

1375
01:29:05.641 --> 01:29:08.640
I'm all,
I'm looking for only girls.
Well,
I got to tell you something,

1376
01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:11.460
but in the life,
because here's the thing,

1377
01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:15.210
what I of course am,
I am a fan of yours.

1378
01:29:15.930 --> 01:29:20.070
I said we both are Tom.
Yeah,
I know.
I'm just speaking from myself,
but yes,

1379
01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:22.230
we're fans of yours.
Uh,

1380
01:29:22.530 --> 01:29:25.110
nothing would make me happier than to see you happy.

1381
01:29:25.111 --> 01:29:29.580
And I want you to find the love of your life purpose.
Well,

1382
01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:34.580
there's no reason to be.
What I'm going to do is,
are you currently single?
Yeah.

1383
01:29:34.610 --> 01:29:38.100
Okay.
I'm very single.
I haven't had sex in a year.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.

1384
01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:39.080
I'm so glad you're here.

1385
01:29:39.530 --> 01:29:44.530
I'm going to throw at you some different men who are available and even though

1386
01:29:45.781 --> 01:29:49.500
you're putting out there,
I'm respecting the fact that you're saying women,

1387
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:52.410
I would just like you to consider,

1388
01:29:52.650 --> 01:29:56.100
you may just give me your take on them as they,
you know,

1389
01:29:56.580 --> 01:29:59.640
display themselves to scream.
Okay?
So let's go ahead

1390
01:30:03.070 --> 01:30:07.840
<v 25>before you have sex.
If you want to be horny for two or three hours,</v>

1391
01:30:07.841 --> 01:30:09.550
like you never been in your life,

1392
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:13.020
any of access to marijuana too good,

1393
01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:15.820
we'd listen to me today.

1394
01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:22.830
Turn weight alone.
Can get you really hornier than normal.

1395
01:30:22.831 --> 01:30:25.800
But it's been an in general take about 10,
12,

1396
01:30:25.801 --> 01:30:29.040
Benham girl before you want to have your sexual fun with your partner or

1397
01:30:29.041 --> 01:30:32.700
whatever you do or masturbate.
All right.
Yeah.
Uh,

1398
01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:34.320
about an hour later when you fill it,

1399
01:30:34.321 --> 01:30:39.321
just kicking and smoke your weed done and then can go ahead and get horny.

1400
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:44.390
And I promise you it will be millions of times more.

1401
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:47.940
You'll be so blissfully horny that you will not want to come.

1402
01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:49.853
Trust me.

1403
01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:55.100
<v 6>So is this the fam?
Uh,
we hope so.
We're fans.
It is.</v>

1404
01:30:56.460 --> 01:31:00.360
You know,
would you do,
would you go to dinner huffing?
Yeah,
I do like his beard.

1405
01:31:02.010 --> 01:31:04.680
Yeah,
but I'm positive outlook that guy has.

1406
01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:08.490
I don't like the snorts that he was doing.
What?
I'm sorry.
What do you mean?

1407
01:31:08.491 --> 01:31:11.430
The snorts like he made like breathe like,
you know what's funny?

1408
01:31:11.431 --> 01:31:16.000
I don't like snoring.
We had a,
Oh,
I see.
That's what turned you off.

1409
01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:20.160
The other,
the 10 to 12 Benadryl and then the word,
the setting,

1410
01:31:20.630 --> 01:31:24.840
the way that it looks good to me.
Where do you find these?

1411
01:31:25.050 --> 01:31:29.340
We're lucky.
The best fans in the world.
That guy,

1412
01:31:29.341 --> 01:31:33.800
by the way,
um,
he has,
um,
some respiratory issues.
Is that what it is?
Yeah,

1413
01:31:33.870 --> 01:31:35.310
but I figured you could help them.
You know,

1414
01:31:35.311 --> 01:31:39.180
maybe like one of the things you would do is we'll in the oxygen every day as

1415
01:31:39.181 --> 01:31:43.140
part of the new relationship.
No,
Gosh,
I don't know.

1416
01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:46.860
I'm not good at like Improv Games.
No,
no,
no.
It's,
it's totally,
we just,

1417
01:31:46.861 --> 01:31:50.070
we want to find love for you.
What if like,
let's say,

1418
01:31:50.090 --> 01:31:54.900
let's take this scenario took place.
Um,
you meet a guy,

1419
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:59.920
he's like,
Lisa,
Lisa,
and you're like,
what?
And do I know you?
And he's like,
ah,

1420
01:31:59.950 --> 01:32:00.340
nothing.

1421
01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:04.780
<v 0>I just,
I know I,
I've seen you on Netflix and anyways,</v>

1422
01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:08.080
would you like to have dinner some time?
And you're like,
I don't,
I dunno man.

1423
01:32:08.081 --> 01:32:11.410
I'm kind of not.
And then he goes,
this,
let me have your number.

1424
01:32:11.530 --> 01:32:14.950
And then you give them your phone.
He takes it,
he puts his number in,

1425
01:32:14.951 --> 01:32:19.810
but he calls himself so he now has your number,
right.
Kind of a slick move.

1426
01:32:20.230 --> 01:32:21.280
That's what this guy did.

1427
01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:26.700
And then the next morning he just sent a video of himself to this girl who he'd

1428
01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:28.210
met one time.

1429
01:32:28.270 --> 01:32:30.490
<v 22>Okay,
I'm thrilled.
Ready?
Yes.</v>

1430
01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:35.320
<v 26>Good morning,
Julia.
It's me.
Joe.
Just wanted to say hi.</v>

1431
01:32:35.890 --> 01:32:37.180
Wish you a great day.

1432
01:32:37.810 --> 01:32:42.640
Tell you that me and you yesterday and getting a look at you was probably one of

1433
01:32:42.641 --> 01:32:45.670
the greatest moments of my life.
You are so beautiful.

1434
01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:50.770
You don't know how beautiful you are to me.
I mean just,
you're gorgeous.

1435
01:32:50.771 --> 01:32:54.400
You're precious.
But it's been sitting in my mind when you said to me,

1436
01:32:54.401 --> 01:32:58.810
you want to go back with your ex boyfriend,
please erase him from your memory.

1437
01:32:58.990 --> 01:33:00.940
Don't ever go back in the past.
I know,

1438
01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:05.320
cause I've been there and I understand when you know you're trying to find

1439
01:33:05.321 --> 01:33:10.321
somebody and you go on dates and not the compares to your racks,

1440
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:15.370
but there is that better person out there.
And Julia,

1441
01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:16.750
I promise you it is me.

1442
01:33:16.810 --> 01:33:19.330
I mean so far I love you like you've never been loved before.

1443
01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:22.200
<v 0>You feel terrified.</v>

1444
01:33:22.710 --> 01:33:27.350
<v 22>Um,
not to.
I liked it.
He's showing off his home,
the whole thing.
I like the plant.</v>

1445
01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:31.400
No,
I hate the word precious a lot.
Yeah,
I hate that.

1446
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:32.360
Do you like ceiling fans though?

1447
01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:34.640
<v 0>He's got multiple ceilings.</v>

1448
01:33:34.990 --> 01:33:39.770
<v 22>No.
Yeah,
a lot.
No,
I got some sheik fans actually.
Yeah,</v>

1449
01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:44.240
I have some Varnado for Nedo cause that offensive brand.
It's a fancy fan brand.

1450
01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:48.430
Really?
Yeah,
I like it.
I did buy the Dyson Airblade one too,

1451
01:33:48.431 --> 01:33:50.650
but I thought it was an air conditioner and they're not there.

1452
01:33:50.651 --> 01:33:54.130
Just $600 fans owe $600 I bought two.
Yeah,

1453
01:33:54.131 --> 01:33:57.850
there like three 50 each and I thought they were air conditioners but they're

1454
01:33:57.851 --> 01:34:02.350
just air filtering fan.
So I returned them immediately.
Oh yeah,

1455
01:34:02.530 --> 01:34:03.580
that's no.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1456
01:34:03.581 --> 01:34:06.100
Someone that I had a crush on told me to buy them and I did it.

1457
01:34:06.190 --> 01:34:09.340
And then can I ask you though,
would you re,

1458
01:34:09.390 --> 01:34:13.920
do you respect this move of the gun?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
This is too much.
Right.

1459
01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:18.550
But you know the answer though.
Yeah.
Sending a video the next day.

1460
01:34:18.850 --> 01:34:22.270
Also,
I'm,
I hate when people are like,
you don't know how beautiful you are.

1461
01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:26.530
That's so weird.
I don't like that.
It is rude.
And the,

1462
01:34:26.650 --> 01:34:30.190
the hair on his face looks weird.
It looks like it's too smooth everywhere.

1463
01:34:30.490 --> 01:34:35.460
And then just so Perry and travel.
Yeah.
I don't like this at all.

1464
01:34:35.470 --> 01:34:38.230
It's a little intense to write.
Very intense.

1465
01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:43.270
It's a lot for a chording video and he doesn't know.
No.
Yes,
no,
but yet,

1466
01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:46.030
no one would agree with that.
This is a good move though,
right?

1467
01:34:46.210 --> 01:34:47.530
I don't think anyone,
except for Joe,

1468
01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:50.200
he thinks it's a good movie and is a great mood.
Yeah.

1469
01:34:50.201 --> 01:34:54.130
I wonder what he does for a living.
It is a nice place.
Wow.
Yeah.
I wonder,

1470
01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:59.150
do you know where he lives?
I do.
Okay.
As a mall town.
No big cities.

1471
01:34:59.151 --> 01:35:02.780
So he is making money.
He makes a good living.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
That's pretty good.

1472
01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:06.520
Now this is crazy.
In that region out to them.
And then we were like,
ah,

1473
01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.930
good idea.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Let's go.

1474
01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:13.920
I don't like Gel met.

1475
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:19.580
There's just better products out there.
There's pomades and creams.

1476
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:24.080
There's no reason to use a gel.
Sure.
Dated at this point.
Like if you're,

1477
01:35:24.090 --> 01:35:28.400
if you're doing gel,
you're like,
I'm a Guido.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1478
01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:33.410
Fucking Guinea wop.
So this guys,
sorry,

1479
01:35:33.411 --> 01:35:37.940
I don't want to
see if you liked this one.
A shot.
No,
I'm done.

1480
01:35:37.941 --> 01:35:38.900
Fucking old man.

1481
01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:49.090
<v 26>I like to have some on my lips.</v>

1482
01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:53.880
I would've liked to have
titties.
Your roadmap.

1483
01:35:54.910 --> 01:35:59.770
I would like to have some sex.
I like to have a woman in my home.

1484
01:36:01.470 --> 01:36:02.490
I could make her look.

1485
01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:07.000
I'm not like one of these young men are little boys.

1486
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:12.040
They get their selves off and then oops,
they don't care about their partner.

1487
01:36:13.130 --> 01:36:13.963
You come.

1488
01:36:16.110 --> 01:36:18.870
<v 22>Yeah,
but this is what my ab and experience is gonna be.</v>

1489
01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:22.020
It's gonna be me interviewing guys like that are going to be like,

1490
01:36:22.230 --> 01:36:26.550
I'm just like sick of old white dudes.
Well,

1491
01:36:26.551 --> 01:36:29.040
you know the Internet is ruining my life right now.
No,

1492
01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:33.230
they found racist tweets and they're really bad.
They're so bad.
It's you really,

1493
01:36:33.250 --> 01:36:36.270
I'm so embarrassed.
I can't believe I wrote any of those things.

1494
01:36:36.271 --> 01:36:40.280
I'm truly humiliated.
How did someone,
why does someone dig it up?
How did it,

1495
01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:45.360
cause I did the MSNBC thing and I said I'm sick of old white guys and Bernie's

1496
01:36:45.361 --> 01:36:47.580
old and ugly.
Like,
I just,
but it was just,

1497
01:36:47.610 --> 01:36:51.210
I was just excited to go on the show cause chef Tom Colicchio is going to be on

1498
01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:52.890
and he's a hero of mine.

1499
01:36:53.250 --> 01:36:55.740
My friend was at my house braiding and they sent me topics.
I'm like,
no,

1500
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:59.490
Bernie's annoying.
I'll talk about him.
And then people love Bernie.

1501
01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:03.450
So I've been a,
I can't,
I have not gone online in a few days.

1502
01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:09.360
That's the tactic like Diane Monoxide Bitch.
But yeah,
the tweets are bad.

1503
01:37:09.630 --> 01:37:13.530
I apologize.
But a lot of people don't believe that I'm being sincere.

1504
01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:15.690
But there I am humiliated.

1505
01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:20.060
But I was just more scared of my friends and my friends that I care about have

1506
01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:21.690
texts to me going,
you're fine.

1507
01:37:21.691 --> 01:37:24.280
So that's all I really care about because I think every,

1508
01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:28.740
almost every comic has some experience in this,

1509
01:37:28.741 --> 01:37:31.320
in that if you've had Twitter and you,

1510
01:37:31.370 --> 01:37:33.450
Twitter's been around a little over 10 years,

1511
01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:37.080
you might have gone from being someone in your young teens in your early

1512
01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:41.550
twenties,
thirties.
It's,
um,
you know,
you make jokes that are just,
well,

1513
01:37:41.551 --> 01:37:45.000
I also feel dumb because I was told like,
scrub your Twitter.
And I was like,

1514
01:37:45.210 --> 01:37:47.850
I don't think I have anything.
I'm like pretty good of a person.

1515
01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:52.500
And then I their old though,
I said the n word in 2016.

1516
01:37:52.530 --> 01:37:55.770
I don't know what I was thinking cause I knew it was bad then,
but I did it.
Yeah.

1517
01:37:57.060 --> 01:38:00.130
Well there's like 15 Asian tweets.
Um,

1518
01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:03.710
and then a couple about Indian men on men.
Like I don't know what I was,

1519
01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:06.270
I can't even,
but you know what?

1520
01:38:06.271 --> 01:38:09.360
If they just posted it going like this dumb white bitch,
I'd be fine with it.

1521
01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:12.450
But they're going in,
anyone that's black or Asian that's following me,

1522
01:38:12.451 --> 01:38:16.470
they're sending them the screenshots.
Oh Geez.
So I just,

1523
01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:18.930
that's kind of weird.
I know,
but I think that like

1524
01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:23.800
<v 0>the kind of interesting psychology two comedians yeah.
Is that like,</v>

1525
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:28.150
even if you,
if you hang out with comics all the time,
um,
you start to,

1526
01:38:28.151 --> 01:38:33.100
you build this thing where you go,
it becomes about like,

1527
01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:36.640
can you say the,
the thing that gets a reaction out of other comics.

1528
01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:41.400
So you start to naturally say more inflammatory things,
not to excuse it.
Like,

1529
01:38:41.401 --> 01:38:46.060
yeah,
but like if you hang out with comics,
you'll hear more racial,

1530
01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:50.200
sexist,
just crazier language that you don't really don't hear it.

1531
01:38:50.201 --> 01:38:54.540
And then you start to think of it as like the norm,
you know?
And then he,

1532
01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:56.830
and then you get distance from it and you're like,
oh,

1533
01:38:56.831 --> 01:39:00.550
that was pretty reckless way to speak.
Yeah.
But I mean,

1534
01:39:00.551 --> 01:39:03.610
at the time you feel like you're just,
you know,

1535
01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:07.900
you're being the rascal basically like you're saying,
just to be provocative.

1536
01:39:07.901 --> 01:39:12.130
I mean,
isn't that the Gig?
To be provocative and to push the boundaries

1537
01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:15.510
<v 22>also,
this isn't gonna make me like Bernie,
you know what I mean?
Like,</v>

1538
01:39:15.511 --> 01:39:19.980
I don't know what these people is kind of a no motivation is,

1539
01:39:19.981 --> 01:39:24.210
but I have done a show.
Funny question to ask you guys

1540
01:39:25.710 --> 01:39:28.260
as Nicole,
if I say the n word,

1541
01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:36.030
is that one of your things?
No,

1542
01:39:36.090 --> 01:39:39.410
I would rather be degraded.
I don't want to call anyone that work.

1543
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:42.990
Well,
one person.
So the tweet was about,

1544
01:39:42.991 --> 01:39:45.960
so I took accidentally my niece and nephews to see Keanu,

1545
01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:48.330
cause I thought it was just a movie about a kitten.

1546
01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:53.140
And then it was so many Edwards Strip appeal movies.
Yes.
Yes.

1547
01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:56.100
And so one person tweeted like [inaudible] even care,
she said the word,

1548
01:39:56.101 --> 01:39:59.520
but she took children to that movie.
Her judgments obviously fucked.

1549
01:39:59.521 --> 01:40:03.270
We can't listen to her about politics.
People aren't just people.
Yeah.

1550
01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:06.820
That was better not to read it.
You're smart.
You're approach is,
no,
I'm not.
Yeah.

1551
01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:10.680
I'm,
I give him my password to someone and I'm not going on it.
Good for you.
Yeah,

1552
01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:14.060
don't do it.
Block it out.
I can't.
Yeah,
they're just a,

1553
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:18.330
there's no more texts.
Let's talk about your porno pet peeves.

1554
01:40:18.331 --> 01:40:22.800
What else do I like?
Well,
I hate fake noises.
Yeah,
that's why I like,

1555
01:40:22.801 --> 01:40:24.810
I think the pope,
like the kinky stuff,

1556
01:40:24.811 --> 01:40:28.650
cause you know it's a little bit more real.
There's like Hitachi's everywhere.

1557
01:40:28.710 --> 01:40:29.543
Oh right.

1558
01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:34.580
So I like real noises and then sometimes I'm fans of porn stars that don't turn

1559
01:40:34.651 --> 01:40:39.150
me on,
but I'm just,
I'm obsessed with them.
Like Adriana Shewchuk,
I just like,

1560
01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:42.300
I'm obsessed with,
I don't know how I pay,
I give her 1299 a month,

1561
01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:47.780
but I don't use it to masturbate for her only fans cause she's a slut on her off

1562
01:40:47.851 --> 01:40:52.140
time.
And that's like the best.
So her only fans account,
it's basically her.

1563
01:40:52.410 --> 01:40:54.490
Some of them,
she'll suck a dick at a Dave and busters.

1564
01:40:54.491 --> 01:40:56.620
I do jokes like she'll just put her on her,

1565
01:40:56.621 --> 01:41:00.190
she'll be at a music festival and she'll just suck a dick in the middle of it
or,

1566
01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:00.910
um,

1567
01:41:00.910 --> 01:41:04.120
and she gets people on craigslist and they come over and then they have sex with

1568
01:41:04.121 --> 01:41:05.170
her.
And then her boyfriend had sex.

1569
01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:08.860
She's just like wild when it's her and all her best friends are porn stars.

1570
01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:12.430
So they'll have game nights and then she'll just tape them doing whatever.

1571
01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:15.010
I like watching her on her off time.

1572
01:41:16.530 --> 01:41:20.230
It's almost like if you're watching this like porn stuff and then you see a

1573
01:41:20.231 --> 01:41:24.390
behind the scenes,
the behind the scenes seems like it's um,
I don't know,

1574
01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:28.100
a little more exciting because like,
yes,
they're not performing,
you know?
Yeah.

1575
01:41:28.820 --> 01:41:31.510
And then my favorite girls,
they are lesbian,
married couple,

1576
01:41:31.511 --> 01:41:34.420
but they'll get another girl and they'll be in a hotel room in one we'll tape

1577
01:41:34.421 --> 01:41:38.650
and the others have sex and I kinda,
yeah,
I like it grounded but not amateur.

1578
01:41:38.651 --> 01:41:42.070
I want a professional,
I hate,
they don't know the angles and stuff.

1579
01:41:42.071 --> 01:41:46.000
Like I don't want to watch amateur porn.
And you learn this over years of,
right.

1580
01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:50.500
Like you said in your 20s or early twenties you got more into it in the past few

1581
01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:54.010
years.
I would say I'm lonely.
Yeah.
And I'm into it.

1582
01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:57.580
But I also watched the interviews before and after and I watched,

1583
01:41:57.581 --> 01:41:59.850
there's like a series called ask a porn star.
So I get to,

1584
01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:03.010
I like to know about their translating world.

1585
01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:05.290
Lot of work would you ever do on,

1586
01:42:05.291 --> 01:42:09.750
it sounds like you're very interested in I would world.
I would never,
uh,

1587
01:42:09.770 --> 01:42:12.910
I would never,
but I see in my private life,
I like it.

1588
01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:17.860
So I am terrified at any moment that someone will release something that's going

1589
01:42:17.861 --> 01:42:21.970
on to where your foot is on this cord.
So many wires and crap.

1590
01:42:23.230 --> 01:42:27.520
Um,
coat.
Oh No,
I wanna yeah,

1591
01:42:27.521 --> 01:42:30.430
I don't think I'd do porn,
but I like sending dirty shit and I like getting it.

1592
01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:33.550
Well there you go.
That's what guys do all day long,
you know?

1593
01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:35.710
Well I think I do a joke about this,

1594
01:42:35.711 --> 01:42:39.040
but I told someone to send me a dirty video once and he sent me videos of him

1595
01:42:39.041 --> 01:42:41.440
fucking someone else coming on someone else.

1596
01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:45.640
But I felt bad because I didn't know if she knew.

1597
01:42:45.641 --> 01:42:48.790
So I watched it like twice and then deleted him.
Oh really?
Yeah.

1598
01:42:49.210 --> 01:42:52.360
I had to delete it,
but I want,
we had to watch him not long at all.

1599
01:42:53.470 --> 01:42:56.440
Like 30 seconds each or something.
The girl knows she's being recorded in it.

1600
01:42:56.550 --> 01:43:00.010
Yeah.
Yeah,
for sure.
Cause he,
when we had sex,

1601
01:43:00.011 --> 01:43:02.320
he tried to do stuff and I was like,
I don't trust you.

1602
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:06.400
And now I'm glad I didn't send them.
And fascinated by,
um,
the,
uh,

1603
01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.350
the change in your dating guys.
How do you discover it?

1604
01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:14.080
How do you find out?
Basically I was in Australia,

1605
01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:19.060
I was in Melbourne for the comedy festival and meet this girl.
It's so good.

1606
01:43:19.210 --> 01:43:23.320
I want to go back so bad.
It's fun there.
Um,

1607
01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:26.180
but uh,
we had a mutual,
we have a mutual best friends,

1608
01:43:26.181 --> 01:43:27.250
so I knew I'd hang out with her.

1609
01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:31.270
And then we were at an art museum and I just looked over and I was like,

1610
01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:34.660
Oh my God,
I'm fucking in love with her.
And then I was like nervous,

1611
01:43:34.661 --> 01:43:36.790
but then I finally told her that I liked her.

1612
01:43:37.060 --> 01:43:41.500
And then you started and we made out and then we hooked up.
And then,
um,

1613
01:43:41.530 --> 01:43:44.400
I had to go to Sydney and she had to stay,
but we immediately started texting.

1614
01:43:44.420 --> 01:43:46.960
I'm a creep.
So Day two,
I was like,
can I buy tickets and see you?

1615
01:43:47.470 --> 01:43:50.770
And so we met up and then we just like would fly around and see each other.

1616
01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:55.420
Why then we would like,
you know,
text him.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.

1617
01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:58.940
Was she a,
uh,
a native?
No,
she's in London.

1618
01:43:58.970 --> 01:44:01.670
She's in the new Netflix things that came out.
Oh Shit.

1619
01:44:04.190 --> 01:44:07.190
She knows.
No,
I talk about everything.
She actually asked me,
she's like,

1620
01:44:07.191 --> 01:44:09.830
can you please stop talking about me?
And she's like,

1621
01:44:09.831 --> 01:44:13.130
can you stop calling me a compulsive liar on podcasts?
I'm like,
I'll try it.

1622
01:44:13.190 --> 01:44:17.690
But it's hard.
So you guys are officially dating right now?
No,
I got Dom's Bro.

1623
01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:18.700
My heart was broken.

1624
01:44:18.710 --> 01:44:21.620
I was depressed for at six months and then last year I started therapy and

1625
01:44:21.621 --> 01:44:26.210
that's helped me a lot cause I was really,
truly sad.
Yeah.

1626
01:44:26.211 --> 01:44:29.090
I really loved her.
But now I'm like removed,
you know,
it's fine.

1627
01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:32.480
But we text sometimes.
What's your therapist saying about this?
Like,

1628
01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:34.670
well that a lot of my,

1629
01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:38.200
I think it was the first time I felt fully like loved and gave like,
I dunno,

1630
01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:41.300
I just,
it was a really good relationship while it lasted,

1631
01:44:41.301 --> 01:44:45.410
but she said most of my issues and why I can't let it go is because of other

1632
01:44:45.411 --> 01:44:48.350
stuff that I'd never explored and that she kind of gave me everything I've ever

1633
01:44:48.351 --> 01:44:53.060
wanted.
So.
Wow.
It's like more than that.
Interesting.

1634
01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:55.820
Yeah.
I never felt seen before.

1635
01:44:56.570 --> 01:45:01.460
Like a lot of comedians have that issue,
seen,
heard,
acknowledged,

1636
01:45:01.461 --> 01:45:03.590
all that stuff and it was hard.

1637
01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:06.500
I mean I would have married her but now I'm glad we're not together.

1638
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:09.890
Oh yeah,
I would've,
yeah,
absolutely.

1639
01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:12.470
Because that would have been fine being long distance and everything,

1640
01:45:12.471 --> 01:45:16.040
but she couldn't do it up until you meet her at the festival.

1641
01:45:17.630 --> 01:45:21.290
Is it occurring to you that you might know?
Like I've had to,

1642
01:45:21.330 --> 01:45:24.410
I've had one group thing and I hooked up with a girl and I was like 21 in

1643
01:45:24.411 --> 01:45:28.600
Portland and then that was it.
But now,
yes.
Yeah.

1644
01:45:28.610 --> 01:45:33.170
I was staying at an anarchist.
We can pull out man.
I got stories.
Oh,
see my,
yeah,

1645
01:45:33.171 --> 01:45:36.290
Scottsdale was my Arizona time,

1646
01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:40.970
but um,
no,
I didn't know at all,

1647
01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:42.590
but I thought I liked having sex.

1648
01:45:42.650 --> 01:45:45.470
I just enjoyed having sex with her more than I've had with any dude.

1649
01:45:45.530 --> 01:45:49.400
That's great.
Yeah,
I think so.
Yeah.
Great to know.

1650
01:45:49.790 --> 01:45:53.390
Yeah.
No,
100%.
I'm just embarrassed because I'm so old,
you know?

1651
01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:56.090
I'm going to say you're very young.

1652
01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:59.100
I think that's for not knowing your kind of gay,
I don't know.

1653
01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:03.080
I feel so ignorant because my friends are like so gay.
I don't know.

1654
01:46:03.170 --> 01:46:06.440
It seems weird.
I didn't know.
But now everyone's like,
oh,
now you're like,

1655
01:46:06.441 --> 01:46:08.280
everyone will be easier for you.
The pool widen,

1656
01:46:08.330 --> 01:46:12.500
but I think it's like so specific now I want like a short haired girl dresses.

1657
01:46:12.501 --> 01:46:16.760
Kind of like a boy.
Oh boy.
Like girl,

1658
01:46:16.850 --> 01:46:20.530
what are you going to show?
[inaudible]

1659
01:46:23.070 --> 01:46:25.990
like let's say you,
you said,
hey,
will you send me?
Oh,

1660
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.720
but I do want to tell you that she looks like all the boys I had crushes on as a

1661
01:46:29.721 --> 01:46:31.940
young girl.
Really that she looks like a boy.

1662
01:46:31.941 --> 01:46:35.960
Bander like she looks like Nick Carter,
like Leonardo Dicaprio.
He that always,

1663
01:46:36.050 --> 01:46:38.420
that's the part I don't understand about lesbian is it?
Yeah.
Okay,

1664
01:46:38.421 --> 01:46:41.780
so you like a woman but then she looks like the boy that he had.

1665
01:46:41.790 --> 01:46:46.040
So like it's why,
right?
So like what so confused.

1666
01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:51.000
It's fluid.
Jesus.
But she also fucks boys too.

1667
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:55.500
We're all just,
yeah,
we're all just kind of,
what's your pronoun?
Wishy washy.

1668
01:46:55.740 --> 01:46:58.740
Do you have a pronoun?
No,
I'm fine.
That's what I always say.
This sounds bad,

1669
01:46:58.770 --> 01:47:01.860
but it's like,
I don't know if I can date a day.
That seems so complicated.

1670
01:47:01.861 --> 01:47:04.800
Like I wonder if they have a sense of humor.
I know,

1671
01:47:06.930 --> 01:47:10.200
but uh,
yeah.
What's Your Pronoun?
Um,
all right,

1672
01:47:10.201 --> 01:47:14.880
so here's a cool guy and I'm going to get graphic.

1673
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:19.380
No,
it's super chill.
So just let me know.

1674
01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:24.270
Like what do you think of him?
Of like his whole appeal,
his style.

1675
01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:26.190
He's just like,
just check them out for a second.

1676
01:47:26.610 --> 01:47:27.443
<v 20>Hi there guys.</v>

1677
01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:31.620
It's Pete again and I'm here to do a little video and I wanted to use this but

1678
01:47:31.621 --> 01:47:35.370
by greeny toy that I bought this new one and I thought I'd try that again.

1679
01:47:35.430 --> 01:47:38.850
And then I also wanted to try this step one did fuck sleep.

1680
01:47:39.590 --> 01:47:42.630
He's used to it of course.

1681
01:47:42.631 --> 01:47:46.530
And then I went to look and they didn't send any batteries so

1682
01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:52.890
I'm not going to be able to use the vibrating
plate backwards,

1683
01:47:53.250 --> 01:47:56.490
so I'm sure that's going to get me off.
Yeah.
And it's kind,

1684
01:47:56.610 --> 01:48:00.150
it's got this cool builtin cockraine.

1685
01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:04.240
Oh and then I got this cool.
A friend of mine had mine.

1686
01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:09.090
<v 22>Wait,
hold on.
Oh,
that's so cool.
I love him.
He's my favorite of the group,</v>

1687
01:48:09.150 --> 01:48:13.890
isn't he great.
He's good.
He's got great energy,
great energy.

1688
01:48:13.891 --> 01:48:17.700
I liked that.
He is fun about the toys.
Yes.
So excited.
Yes,

1689
01:48:17.850 --> 01:48:21.720
and I liked that he went bad.
Bad because of the batteries.
Yeah.
He's a fun guy,

1690
01:48:21.721 --> 01:48:25.530
man.
You and I am one of the other guys.
Better than that.

1691
01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:30.710
You like the Benadryl and oldies.

1692
01:48:30.750 --> 01:48:33.870
I would take Benadryl or Joe over this guy.

1693
01:48:34.710 --> 01:48:38.430
Take Benadryl,
Benadryl.
Benadryl is severely,

1694
01:48:38.431 --> 01:48:41.920
severely unstable.
I know,
but that's why he won't harass.
You might,

1695
01:48:41.921 --> 01:48:44.550
she'll pass out what he,
this guy's pretty gay.
No,

1696
01:48:46.270 --> 01:48:48.240
this guy's definitely going to fuck you.

1697
01:48:48.241 --> 01:48:50.520
Then Benadryl guys going to pass out before anything.

1698
01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:53.190
I drill guys going to chop you up and put you in a box.

1699
01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:56.670
They'll be asleep before then.
No,
this guy's a maniac.

1700
01:48:56.700 --> 01:48:58.710
But at least you know the Benadryl guy would get caught.

1701
01:48:58.711 --> 01:49:01.200
He would not get away with murder.
He would not get away.
She would get caught.

1702
01:49:01.201 --> 01:49:05.860
But you'd be definitely dead.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
So I'll keep watching them

1703
01:49:06.030 --> 01:49:08.550
<v 20>flexing with his boyfriend and it's a double ended dude.</v>

1704
01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:13.200
So I really want to try this because I like fucking stuff at first.

1705
01:49:13.201 --> 01:49:16.190
I'm going to try and get this in my button and then this is the best product.

1706
01:49:17.050 --> 01:49:19.920
Little,
oh,
that was cool.
Control.

1707
01:49:22.740 --> 01:49:25.890
Nice texture to it.
Yeah,

1708
01:49:27.900 --> 01:49:30.810
go.
Doesn't like this part.
I love him.

1709
01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:36.690
I don't like the foot there.
Yeah.
And it's got a nice built in Cap rain,

1710
01:49:36.691 --> 01:49:37.770
which I thought was kind of cool.

1711
01:49:37.930 --> 01:49:42.730
<v 22>It is kind of cool.
I just like that he's supporting his local porn store.</v>

1712
01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:45.610
He totally is.
Yeah.
And he's,
and he's also,
you know,

1713
01:49:45.611 --> 01:49:48.730
it's like one of those review and people are like,
Hey,

1714
01:49:48.731 --> 01:49:52.330
have you seen the new BMW three series?
Here's all the features.
You know,

1715
01:49:52.331 --> 01:49:54.970
he's like one of those guys.
I love them.
Yeah.
Do we have more?

1716
01:49:56.370 --> 01:49:57.250
They're definitely more

1717
01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:02.170
<v 20>my eye,
so it may take me a minute.</v>

1718
01:50:02.530 --> 01:50:06.650
Oh Woo.
Get her.
Yeah.

1719
01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.780
I haven't had anything in my blood since my last,
uh,
but toy video,

1720
01:50:16.630 --> 01:50:17.700
someone's got to do it.

1721
01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:21.340
<v 22>Yeah.
Yeah.
Someone's going to test these toys as a side.
I too,</v>

1722
01:50:21.341 --> 01:50:25.270
like he's really put on a Hoodie.
Yeah.
Because she's so upset with this guy.

1723
01:50:25.271 --> 01:50:27.970
He's just so open with his sexuality.
That's what your boss is.

1724
01:50:27.971 --> 01:50:31.450
Not including anyone else in his,
you know,
he's not like,
come on to my dungeon.

1725
01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:33.940
Right,
right.
Going gonna make you feel good.
He was just like,

1726
01:50:34.150 --> 01:50:37.840
I'm going to have fun by myself and you're going to be going to,
you said abns.

1727
01:50:37.890 --> 01:50:39.880
Yeah.
Is that soon?
Yeah.

1728
01:50:39.881 --> 01:50:44.200
I'm going on the 20 lb there to the 23rd through the 27th and then Cardi B's

1729
01:50:44.201 --> 01:50:48.250
performing at the awards.
Bacardi Carta.
I love her.

1730
01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:53.110
My favorite thing is watching her eat shellfish.
She goes,

1731
01:50:53.290 --> 01:50:57.530
these are some good ass veneers.
They shit on Instagram.
It's like,

1732
01:50:57.570 --> 01:51:01.480
look at all this meat.
Like she's just luxury.
I love her.

1733
01:51:02.230 --> 01:51:06.370
She's fine.
She's like tapping on crab shells.
I just,
I really like her.

1734
01:51:06.430 --> 01:51:09.070
I'm really excited.
What are you going to be doing at Avn?

1735
01:51:09.071 --> 01:51:12.590
So people know for sure.
I'll be at the browsers booth.
Uh Huh.
Um,

1736
01:51:12.610 --> 01:51:15.700
and then I'll be at the red carpet at the award show and then I'm just going to

1737
01:51:15.701 --> 01:51:20.380
be a fan and a glitter dress watching the awards.
Wow.
And cheering from like,

1738
01:51:20.381 --> 01:51:23.170
I vote for them.
Like I vote for all the fan awards.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1739
01:51:23.171 --> 01:51:24.910
I treat it like I treat any other business.

1740
01:51:24.911 --> 01:51:28.330
I think that's what's like fucked as people don't respect these girls that are

1741
01:51:28.331 --> 01:51:31.600
just working.
Yeah.
No,
no,
I agree.
We agree.
That's why we celebrate,
uh,

1742
01:51:31.630 --> 01:51:34.960
the porno industry here because someone was telling me Riley Reid has over a

1743
01:51:34.961 --> 01:51:37.870
billion streams,
a billion,
a billion,

1744
01:51:37.871 --> 01:51:41.230
which is like if she was a musician or a comment or anything,
it's like,
yeah,

1745
01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:43.840
she was on youtube.
She would make so much money.

1746
01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:49.770
It is a performance art thing too.
You know?
These are performers.
Yeah.

1747
01:51:49.930 --> 01:51:54.370
And people like Dick.
Hello?
Hello?
Yeah.

1748
01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.760
Um,
what are your guys's categories?

1749
01:51:58.780 --> 01:52:02.290
I'm so vanilla.
I tell you what's not my categories.

1750
01:52:02.291 --> 01:52:05.200
It's weird because when you have a baby and you blow out your badge,

1751
01:52:05.230 --> 01:52:08.650
I think I've done that twice now.
It's really hard for me to watch porn,

1752
01:52:08.651 --> 01:52:11.020
like right after you have a baby because you're so medical,

1753
01:52:11.021 --> 01:52:15.820
like your body's still Kinda,
yeah.
So like,
I hate mealth stuff too.

1754
01:52:15.821 --> 01:52:20.820
I'm like,
oh,
that makes me cringe.
Mm hmm.
Trying to think I'm,

1755
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:23.080
I'd say I'm kind of boring.
Sorry.

1756
01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:28.060
Regular regular one or two people to straight people or a few.
Yeah,

1757
01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:32.900
that's fine.
Yeah.
Suddenly so shy.

1758
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:35.530
So I'm so,
but because I'm in so mom mode,

1759
01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:37.720
like I'm only like almost six months postpartum,

1760
01:52:37.721 --> 01:52:40.900
so I'm not like super sexual yet.
You know what I mean?
Your,

1761
01:52:40.930 --> 01:52:43.030
your body is still kind of cut that always weirds oh,

1762
01:52:43.031 --> 01:52:45.200
there's is a trend that I've found the uh,

1763
01:52:45.201 --> 01:52:49.100
when women squeeze their breast milk on people,

1764
01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:56.020
I'm not into,
I'm really,
I don't like it.
I like that.

1765
01:52:59.670 --> 01:53:03.500
I do like,
I do like the NBA is what?
It's homeless.
We,

1766
01:53:03.501 --> 01:53:07.100
I took her to a basketball game.
Oh this is really cool.

1767
01:53:07.101 --> 01:53:11.270
I would love to come back to watch these guys play basketball.
And I'm like,

1768
01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:17.000
are you being sarcastic?
Did you hate it?
No,
I loved it.

1769
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:21.380
And then that night I dreamt that Tom had a big black dog did,

1770
01:53:21.381 --> 01:53:25.130
he was everything else was his color,
normal color and then huge black.

1771
01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:28.070
Everything else will buy normal color and size.
And then she was like,

1772
01:53:28.071 --> 01:53:32.120
but you have this big black cock right after the Laker game.
I mean,
come on.

1773
01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:36.740
I bought season tickets.
Yes.
Cool.
What's your genre?

1774
01:53:36.741 --> 01:53:40.170
I don't even know anymore.
I just like to see a grill kit dogged out,
you know,

1775
01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:43.070
just like wrapped around with like a lot of dudes

1776
01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:49.970
I like,
I mean I am pretty like I can watch,

1777
01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:54.590
you know how when you go to the tube sites,
um,
there's like a homepage.

1778
01:53:55.250 --> 01:53:59.630
I mean let's say there's 20 videos,
13 of them work for me.

1779
01:54:01.150 --> 01:54:03.600
I'm like,
I have my favorite set out.

1780
01:54:03.601 --> 01:54:06.210
Like I have to like figure out what I'm perfectly in the mood for.

1781
01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:08.900
I mean I'll tell you what else I discriminate.

1782
01:54:09.470 --> 01:54:12.680
I saw like there was like some BJ video.

1783
01:54:12.681 --> 01:54:17.440
Then there was like pass step.
Mom was like,
Hey,

1784
01:54:17.670 --> 01:54:19.610
oh me and your sister going to teach you how to fuck.

1785
01:54:19.611 --> 01:54:24.611
One of those was on my therapist said about the trauma and turning it

1786
01:54:24.621 --> 01:54:27.850
pleasurable.
Like there's a reason all this incest porn is so in,

1787
01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:31.490
it's just trauma.
It's like when the male,
yeah,

1788
01:54:31.491 --> 01:54:36.440
I think it's like a lot of people turning their creepy lives and to also look

1789
01:54:36.441 --> 01:54:40.880
little dicks.
It's humiliating.
I really don't like it.

1790
01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:44.450
I don't like it either.
For sure.
For sure.

1791
01:54:45.140 --> 01:54:50.030
Whenever you [inaudible] whole ones,
it's like,
I dunno,
I want to see that.

1792
01:54:50.090 --> 01:54:53.300
I hate seeing an average size dick in a porn.
I'm serious.

1793
01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.030
I really am like,
come on,

1794
01:54:56.830 --> 01:55:00.560
like give us some fucking equipment to work with him.

1795
01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:02.630
I want to see something impressive.

1796
01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.910
And also actually like when the girl goes like cheese,

1797
01:55:06.020 --> 01:55:08.390
like how they can fit all of this and then they're like,

1798
01:55:08.391 --> 01:55:10.710
we're going to make it fit,
you know?
Yeah.

1799
01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:14.213
Yeah.

1800
01:55:14.730 --> 01:55:19.730
I can't get off on really on lesbian porn with a strap on now.

1801
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:24.590
Even if I put my toy in and everything that feels extra fake to me.

1802
01:55:24.591 --> 01:55:26.060
Lesbian Porn,
really

1803
01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:29.660
my favorites.

1804
01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:32.990
Nikki hearts and her wife is hot and they're tatted up and they're gay.

1805
01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:37.640
And I like,
I liked the tatted up girls.
Yeah.
I like a Bella,
Donna.
She's neat.

1806
01:55:37.850 --> 01:55:42.560
She puts baseball bats and her,
but she's retired but an icon.
Yeah,

1807
01:55:42.561 --> 01:55:43.680
I like her.
I like her.

1808
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:48.880
<v 6>She's nice as shit.
Yeah,
I met her once.
Yeah.
So,</v>

1809
01:55:51.580 --> 01:55:54.650
um,
is there another cool guy or,
okay,

1810
01:55:54.770 --> 01:55:59.040
so please know about guide area.
No,
no,
please.

1811
01:55:59.370 --> 01:56:04.170
So listen,
we have this game.
Okay.
Um,
and we liked to play it.

1812
01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:08.860
I want to set it up correctly for you.
Do either of you watch bravo a ton?

1813
01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:13.740
This is like so much like Andy,
his clubhouse full.
Yeah.
With all the fun stuff.

1814
01:56:13.770 --> 01:56:18.750
Yeah.
Oh,
you got to keep adding.
We watch a million dollar fisting.
Okay.

1815
01:56:19.790 --> 01:56:23.130
Uh,
what's his name?
Jeff Lewis.
Although that show just got canceled,

1816
01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:27.270
which were in love with Jeff Lewis.
I'm so bomb the housewife shit though.

1817
01:56:27.271 --> 01:56:30.680
I don't want,
oh,
see,
I like the Vanderpump.
You guys would love Vanderpump.

1818
01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:32.010
I eat at a restaurant every now and then.

1819
01:56:32.011 --> 01:56:36.720
My shrink used to be right by their prompt.
They're such trash bags.
Yeah,

1820
01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:39.720
this is Tom.
What are you doing?
Oh yeah.
You know,

1821
01:56:39.721 --> 01:56:43.350
the scene in requiem for a dream.
And I was like,
it's so sad.
Like that is,

1822
01:56:43.410 --> 01:56:48.390
that turns me on.
Okay.
I loved that Alan's Oh,
okay.
Okay.
That end scene reverence.

1823
01:56:48.391 --> 01:56:52.720
Like it's so sad.
Like sometimes I'll pull it up.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.
Are traumatized.

1824
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:56.340
I don't have my,
my,
uh,
intro for it,
but I do have,

1825
01:56:56.341 --> 01:57:01.170
so this is what we do is play these videos and we call the segment horrible,

1826
01:57:01.171 --> 01:57:06.171
are hilarious and we just basically want you to watch it and tell us whether you

1827
01:57:06.271 --> 01:57:10.590
think it's horrible or really funny.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm scared.
Yeah.

1828
01:57:10.910 --> 01:57:11.743
<v 8>Okay.</v>

1829
01:57:13.060 --> 01:57:14.780
<v 6>It's a wrestling video for people listening</v>

1830
01:57:19.550 --> 01:57:23.680
<v 8>tasting.
Oh,</v>

1831
01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:45.353
<v 6>all right.</v>

1832
01:57:45.910 --> 01:57:49.540
Well I thought it was just going to be like a pussy juice hands

1833
01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:55.210
and I would've been fine with what happened for the listening audience is that

1834
01:57:55.211 --> 01:57:56.190
she pulled a,
a,

1835
01:57:56.191 --> 01:58:00.430
a tampon out that was very dark and appearance wiping me out.

1836
01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:05.580
What league,
what wrestling league as I said,
well that's a WWE.
No,

1837
01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:10.090
I don't know.
I don't know.
But those sounded like real fans of wrestling.

1838
01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:14.830
They did sound like it.
It looked like it was a fake tamp though.
Yeah,
I hope so.

1839
01:58:14.890 --> 01:58:19.630
I hope so.
I think so.
But again,
great performance.
Yeah,
the fans are great for us.

1840
01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:22.500
I don't know.
I was upset,
I think,

1841
01:58:23.460 --> 01:58:26.980
did we not explain why we didn't explain it very well to female wrestlers?

1842
01:58:26.981 --> 01:58:30.390
One pulled out a bloody tampon and put it in the other woman's mouth and said,

1843
01:58:30.391 --> 01:58:35.110
taste the tuna.
Now see,
we laugh about it,
but to be,
to be fair,

1844
01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:39.130
uh,
when we were actually watching it,
Christina was like this

1845
01:58:40.830 --> 01:58:41.663
and

1846
01:58:42.410 --> 01:58:44.680
<v 22>yeah,
I don't think I laughed.
I definitely didn't laugh.</v>

1847
01:58:44.710 --> 01:58:49.030
I didn't think you thought it was hilarious.
No.
Did you?
No.
No,
no.

1848
01:58:49.180 --> 01:58:53.280
I don't think it was hilarious,
but as long as it's fake,
I'm okay with that.
Okay.

1849
01:58:53.530 --> 01:58:55.390
I just don't want it to be a real town.
Well,

1850
01:58:55.450 --> 01:58:58.930
I thought it was going to be the fish finger to watch the Osbornes.

1851
01:58:59.500 --> 01:59:01.930
Sharon Osborne would give the fish finger to her daughter.

1852
01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:05.500
The real was really funny.
Yeah,
she did it in the episode.

1853
01:59:05.540 --> 01:59:07.000
Osborne 10 years ago.

1854
01:59:07.450 --> 01:59:11.620
<v 3>I'm going to give you the fish finger and then she put her hand down her coach</v>

1855
01:59:11.621 --> 01:59:15.130
and her pants and then rub it.
The upper lip over daughter.

1856
01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:20.320
I'm giving you a fish.
It was cute.
I thought it was funny.
As motherly love.

1857
01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:24.300
I didn't think so.
Oh,
okay.
I have another one for you.
Okay.

1858
01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:27.930
I am liking the vibe of this.
Okay.
Yeah,
me too.
Go ahead.

1859
01:59:37.130 --> 01:59:40.730
<v 8>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

1860
01:59:50.190 --> 01:59:51.023
okay.

1861
02:00:07.970 --> 02:00:11.690
<v 22>Are you laughing?
I'm not laughing.
My husband's laughing.</v>

1862
02:00:11.870 --> 02:00:16.460
Ooh.
Why didn't he try to take the cloth though?
He just kept enjoying.

1863
02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:22.820
<v 3>I don't know.
I just don't get why you didn't try to save himself?
Yeah.</v>

1864
02:00:22.821 --> 02:00:27.680
I don't know.
He really flipped out though.
It looked,
it looked scared.

1865
02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:31.400
Yeah.
I'm not into that.
I'm not interested.
I liked that.
That was pretty funny.

1866
02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:32.353
Okay.

1867
02:00:32.890 --> 02:00:37.480
<v 22>Um,
but it was real,
right?
It wasn't acting.
Yeah.
I,
yeah.
I mean,
I didn't laugh,</v>

1868
02:00:37.481 --> 02:00:39.340
so I guess it wasn't funny,
but,

1869
02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:44.220
<v 3>oh,
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I get it.
Um,</v>

1870
02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:49.960
I want to know what's next or do we talk [inaudible] you're not supposed to

1871
02:00:51.531 --> 02:00:55.430
laugh at that.
I think it was on a laugh at something.
Mental illness.

1872
02:00:55.860 --> 02:00:59.000
Don't laugh at that.
It wasn't mental illness.

1873
02:01:00.110 --> 02:01:04.460
<v 22>He just had a crab on it.
You're your mental illness.
Oh,
laughing.
Go to shit.</v>

1874
02:01:04.461 --> 02:01:08.420
This hurts.
People are hurting.
Yeah.
I don't like watching fights in movies.

1875
02:01:08.421 --> 02:01:11.630
Like if there's a fistfight,
I turn away really in a movie even.
Yeah.

1876
02:01:11.631 --> 02:01:16.280
Like in the movie kids a hundred,
if you remember that like too much.

1877
02:01:16.281 --> 02:01:19.280
I don't like physical fights or worldstar stuff like that.

1878
02:01:19.281 --> 02:01:20.620
Like people actually getting hurt and

1879
02:01:22.670 --> 02:01:25.730
bounces off of cement or something like that.
Yeah.

1880
02:01:25.731 --> 02:01:29.930
If I'm out and about and I see a fight,
I get really upset.
Like scared and upset.

1881
02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:31.980
<v 3>Yeah,
for sure.
Yeah.
I'll call the cops.</v>

1882
02:01:34.150 --> 02:01:36.700
<v 22>Can I ask you,
what did you,
do you have any opinion?</v>

1883
02:01:36.701 --> 02:01:41.630
I know you're from the Chicago area.
Yes.
Did you ever know anyone or,

1884
02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:46.910
or maybe you yourself became a fan of Garth Brooks?
No.

1885
02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:51.560
No,
but I know Garth Brooks fans.
Is it and how do you know them?
Um,

1886
02:01:51.590 --> 02:01:55.370
there are everywhere.
I mean he is very popular.
Very Fair.
He's really popular.

1887
02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:57.800
You a little astounded by it.

1888
02:01:58.670 --> 02:02:03.500
By the level of notoriety and fame.
Yes.
It's pretty significant.

1889
02:02:03.650 --> 02:02:05.990
Maybe it'd be if we saw him alive,
we would understand.

1890
02:02:06.110 --> 02:02:07.990
I've heard that argument a lot.
Tried a man.

1891
02:02:07.991 --> 02:02:12.010
I'm watching the concert on cvs and like it's just hokey.

1892
02:02:12.020 --> 02:02:13.670
He's kind of a Corny Dad.
Boehner.
Like,

1893
02:02:13.671 --> 02:02:18.140
at one point he was doing like the heart hand,
like I live,
he goes like,
Nah.
Um,

1894
02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:20.750
there are cooler than just playing country,

1895
02:02:20.751 --> 02:02:23.750
but I saw the Dixie chicks a couple of years ago.
They were great.

1896
02:02:23.780 --> 02:02:28.430
They were great.
I got too hammered,
but I cried so much and I just loved them.

1897
02:02:28.670 --> 02:02:32.390
You know,
some people that are buying a Bandana,
if you really Dixie chicks,
Bam,

1898
02:02:32.391 --> 02:02:36.110
Bam.
There's some people who think that,
you know,

1899
02:02:36.111 --> 02:02:41.111
Garth may have bodies head and on his ranch and that he pretends to be human and

1900
02:02:41.451 --> 02:02:44.210
that it's all just a big act.
Um,

1901
02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:47.450
this is footage from his most recent CBS concert.

1902
02:02:47.451 --> 02:02:51.110
You were talking about somebody,
this is the one I almost pretending to be human.

1903
02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:52.290
Go ahead.
And,
um,

1904
02:02:52.490 --> 02:02:55.760
<v 27>everybody,
Garth Brooks here in iconic Notre Dame locker room,</v>

1905
02:02:55.761 --> 02:02:58.670
this is where the players go out to take the field every Saturday.

1906
02:02:58.700 --> 02:03:01.430
This is where all our players are getting ready to take the field for this

1907
02:03:01.431 --> 02:03:05.630
concert.
So tonight the fighting Irish,
they're going to become the singing Irish.

1908
02:03:05.660 --> 02:03:06.500
This is going to be good.

1909
02:03:07.220 --> 02:03:11.210
<v 22>That was like real just dad boundary.
Yeah,
I had manufactured.
Yeah.</v>

1910
02:03:11.330 --> 02:03:13.760
I just feel it when you're famous for that long,

1911
02:03:13.761 --> 02:03:17.430
you become semi just mentally fucked.
Yeah.

1912
02:03:17.431 --> 02:03:19.970
I don't think you can stay normal being famous for decades.

1913
02:03:19.971 --> 02:03:24.020
Especially that famous.
Yeah.
It's just impossible.
That's why they all are nuts.

1914
02:03:24.021 --> 02:03:27.620
I can't that because everyone is fake to you.
Everybody.
No one is real.

1915
02:03:27.621 --> 02:03:31.790
Everyone wants something from you or treats you too nice and no one tells you

1916
02:03:31.791 --> 02:03:34.130
you're wrong and I,
and you can't go anywhere.

1917
02:03:34.131 --> 02:03:37.220
And I think it just makes you absolutely insane.
I think you're right.

1918
02:03:37.250 --> 02:03:39.380
I think you're totally right.
And I think,
you know,

1919
02:03:39.381 --> 02:03:44.060
maybe he's handling it well as compared to like a Michael Jackson.

1920
02:03:44.180 --> 02:03:47.220
Yeah.
Will legally it it just fucked.
Yeah.

1921
02:03:47.221 --> 02:03:50.330
Or like when people act mad about everything Madonna does.
It's like,
yes,

1922
02:03:50.331 --> 02:03:53.930
she's been famous since the 80s it's bound to make you not a real shot of her

1923
02:03:53.931 --> 02:03:56.130
side.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1924
02:03:56.190 --> 02:03:59.770
She's always posting or do you follow her on the gram?
Yeah.
Well,
no,
I,

1925
02:03:59.780 --> 02:04:01.270
I'm addicted to Instagram,
so I bake.

1926
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:05.180
I just recently unfollowed like thousands and thousands of people.
Oh No.

1927
02:04:05.450 --> 02:04:08.510
It has to be only people like soak.
I don't know.
I just can't.

1928
02:04:08.630 --> 02:04:11.750
So now it's like you're all caught up and I have nothing to look at,

1929
02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:15.680
but then I just go to the explore page.
I mean,
I just love,
I love it too.

1930
02:04:15.681 --> 02:04:18.680
I'm fascinated,
but I follow her and she's adopted about,
I don't know,

1931
02:04:18.681 --> 02:04:20.900
12 African children at this point,

1932
02:04:21.290 --> 02:04:24.230
and the only thing she plays is have them singing and dancing.

1933
02:04:24.231 --> 02:04:28.310
Like she makes them sing and dance constantly.
It's like,
oh,
this looks terrible.

1934
02:04:28.340 --> 02:04:31.100
Like having Madonna's your adopted mom.
Like you think it's fun.

1935
02:04:31.101 --> 02:04:35.180
It's just terrible.
Yeah.
Come on,
dance.
Let's see what else he's got.

1936
02:04:37.540 --> 02:04:38.390
Don't miss it.

1937
02:04:40.230 --> 02:04:43.170
Legendary coach blue hopes had the sign put up.

1938
02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:46.440
That's now probably one of the most famous sides if football history.

1939
02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:55.020
Well,
they ripped it.
No.
Oh yeah,
you're right.
It's,
it looks like a high,

1940
02:04:55.021 --> 02:04:58.120
super compressed.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Now Lou Holtz,
Lou Holtz

1941
02:04:59.620 --> 02:05:00.453
actually guy,

1942
02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:05.610
and he was on one of those horrible football shows you watched where he would be

1943
02:05:05.611 --> 02:05:07.560
at the round table telling the bad dad

1944
02:05:09.580 --> 02:05:13.620
this mush mouth is on television.
Great.
And they're paying him like millions,

1945
02:05:13.620 --> 02:05:17.150
millions.
Meanwhile,
they can't let a woman over 60 be on television.
Yeah,

1946
02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:21.150
it's true.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She's always pointing it out.

1947
02:05:21.151 --> 02:05:23.700
Something I had never noticed before,
but I'm like,
oh,
you're totally right.

1948
02:05:24.060 --> 02:05:27.180
It's like a guy can be a fucking dog,

1949
02:05:27.260 --> 02:05:31.890
a fucking basset hound,
and he gets prime time television spots,

1950
02:05:32.250 --> 02:05:35.190
but like that a woman,
they'd be like,
get Outta here with that fucking face.

1951
02:05:37.420 --> 02:05:40.890
Super Hot woman.
And they'll still tell you that you're disgusting.
Yeah,

1952
02:05:40.891 --> 02:05:42.570
that's true.
It's true.
It's true.
I have that.

1953
02:05:42.571 --> 02:05:46.230
But that part that you can be on your a game.
I mean,

1954
02:05:46.260 --> 02:05:50.700
people call Rihanna fat,
you know,
it's just,
she's perfect.

1955
02:05:50.701 --> 02:05:55.140
She is perfect.
Her and Miley or like my,
Oh,
Miley's hottest for me.

1956
02:05:55.390 --> 02:05:58.800
Yeah.
Miley and Rhiana.
Your celebrity crush your celeb crush?

1957
02:06:00.900 --> 02:06:05.020
I think so.
I think anybody would go gay for Rihanna.
You'd have to.

1958
02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:08.010
She's so pretty.
She's very patient.
She's wild.

1959
02:06:08.011 --> 02:06:12.790
I heard she made Leonardo Dicaprio lose weight before she fucked him.
She's like,

1960
02:06:12.791 --> 02:06:15.810
you're fat.
And got him a trainer and he had to lose weight.
The fucker.

1961
02:06:16.250 --> 02:06:17.640
Who knows if it's real.
I don't know.

1962
02:06:19.020 --> 02:06:22.560
Straight Savitri man and she was like,

1963
02:06:23.590 --> 02:06:28.480
that was that waistline.
She's so cool.
I'll eat the booty though either.

1964
02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:33.000
But no,
I wouldn't need anybody.
I don't want to eat but I'm not

1965
02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:36.720
in kindergarten.

1966
02:06:37.860 --> 02:06:42.340
Well my prediction is eating ass is slowly on the decline and pissing is going

1967
02:06:42.341 --> 02:06:46.590
to go up in popularity.
Tell us about water.
Sports are going to be more in,

1968
02:06:46.591 --> 02:06:51.480
I think people are going to be more confident to talk about their p fetishes.

1969
02:06:51.540 --> 02:06:55.650
I just think people will be in,
this is just on a limb.
This is coming from,
no,

1970
02:06:55.651 --> 02:07:00.651
I'm actual sources but I think cause squirting has been so in recently that I

1971
02:07:00.721 --> 02:07:03.270
think it's just like such a stopover to the pill.

1972
02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:07.020
What do you think of those people that say that squirting is actually paying?

1973
02:07:07.021 --> 02:07:09.600
Some of it is,
yeah,
I believe scored is piss.

1974
02:07:09.610 --> 02:07:11.730
I don't think it's something that's 100% pissed,

1975
02:07:11.731 --> 02:07:15.960
but I think it's maybe 40% fluid be.
If it's not all pissed.

1976
02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:21.390
I'm not sure.
Magic magic magic.
I don't know what it is,

1977
02:07:21.391 --> 02:07:26.391
but I know the girls in porn drink pedialyte and Gatorade frost and they're

1978
02:07:26.941 --> 02:07:30.900
peeing and they're hydrating and pissing.
That's not fully square.

1979
02:07:30.930 --> 02:07:35.110
But um,
yeah,
cause it's not yellow.
No,

1980
02:07:35.170 --> 02:07:39.880
it's not yellow so it can't be all p.
Hmm.
They're well hydrated though.
They are,

1981
02:07:42.070 --> 02:07:44.140
but as to me as great,
I don't want it.

1982
02:07:44.500 --> 02:07:48.220
I don't want to in Tom's been trying to get me to lick a scrum for a decade and

1983
02:07:48.221 --> 02:07:49.450
it's just not going to happen.

1984
02:07:49.490 --> 02:07:53.790
Which would you let someone else look as but I mean,
no,
we're married.

1985
02:07:54.180 --> 02:07:57.190
We're not open.
Even if you were in the room,
no,

1986
02:07:57.191 --> 02:07:59.470
I wouldn't be comfortable with it.
Like a nice,

1987
02:07:59.740 --> 02:08:04.740
maybe you should just get a fake tongue and today want to feel the spread.

1988
02:08:08.650 --> 02:08:11.170
You wouldn't let someone do that?
No.
No.

1989
02:08:11.590 --> 02:08:14.890
Would you let someone like my scrum if I wasn't willing to do it.

1990
02:08:17.110 --> 02:08:20.430
Now you're opening up a whole thing.
That was our opening up a whole thing.

1991
02:08:20.620 --> 02:08:24.290
If there's stuff you won't do,
your someone else can do it.
Right.

1992
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:26.980
What you're saying is that you don't want to do it.

1993
02:08:28.770 --> 02:08:32.230
Would you hire?
Would you let someone else do it and then you're like,

1994
02:08:32.231 --> 02:08:35.530
would you let someone do it to me,
but I'm willing to do it.
See,

1995
02:08:35.531 --> 02:08:38.230
that's the difference.
If we find something that you won't do,

1996
02:08:38.231 --> 02:08:41.510
am I allowed to have someone else do it?
Such as staple my tits.

1997
02:08:41.540 --> 02:08:45.650
The desk we've been talking about that for,
but you don't really want that.
I just

1998
02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:52.330
promise you're to open.
Yeah,
you're too willing to willing to get that toy.

1999
02:08:52.331 --> 02:08:56.440
That's like us.
A spinny thing of tongues.
And then I'll just,
there you go.

2000
02:08:56.780 --> 02:09:00.550
And what?
She can spread your butt cheeks.
He'll hold the tongue machine.

2001
02:09:01.490 --> 02:09:05.260
Or even if Terry,
if you got him to come over with his toys,
we got,

2002
02:09:05.261 --> 02:09:08.740
Terry helped me put the plug in.
Can I,
can you help me out?

2003
02:09:09.310 --> 02:09:11.110
Put your foot up on the table.
Like Lisa likes.

2004
02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:17.320
I look levelheaded so we could both Terry and I can look at each other when the

2005
02:09:17.771 --> 02:09:20.290
girls are like doing the,
when they're on the floor,

2006
02:09:20.291 --> 02:09:21.610
but then their legs are fully,
oh,

2007
02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:26.590
it's just the guy standing on top of the pile driver.
Oh Man.

2008
02:09:27.580 --> 02:09:30.850
I hear wedding bells whenever I say I love that.

2009
02:09:31.490 --> 02:09:34.360
I want to see photos from her wedding.
Oh,
it's really nice.

2010
02:09:34.590 --> 02:09:36.590
You're just looking at them.
Last night you mentioned

2011
02:09:38.250 --> 02:09:41.730
I'm going to be a bridesmaid and I was a bridesmaid and my sister's wedding at

2012
02:09:41.731 --> 02:09:42.880
like age 12 but my,

2013
02:09:43.170 --> 02:09:47.350
one of my best friends asked me this week and I'm doing the speech at the

2014
02:09:47.351 --> 02:09:51.110
wedding.
Yeah.
I'm excited to tell the wedding crime.

2015
02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:53.590
You're going to AVN from there.
They all know.

2016
02:09:54.340 --> 02:09:57.220
They know the wedding's in December,
but this is like my best friend.

2017
02:09:57.221 --> 02:10:01.690
Her mom knows me.
They all know.
They all know I like porn.
Good.

2018
02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:02.561
But I also,

2019
02:10:02.561 --> 02:10:05.950
I think the reason it's damaging to do does they don't realize it's like a job

2020
02:10:05.951 --> 02:10:08.980
and the girls are acting and doing stuff and then they take the moves home with

2021
02:10:08.981 --> 02:10:12.250
them and it fucks with their brains and what sex is supposed to be like.

2022
02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:17.010
But I think I'm aware enough that hopefully fuck my brains.

2023
02:10:17.011 --> 02:10:19.900
Entertainment.
Yeah.
And it's to turn you on.
I just hope I,

2024
02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:22.810
I hope it doesn't mess me up in my brain.

2025
02:10:23.890 --> 02:10:27.490
Oh is that your concern was watching porn?
Yeah.
How much are you watching?

2026
02:10:27.580 --> 02:10:30.130
I actually haven't watched since I've been here,
so like for a week?
Yeah,

2027
02:10:30.131 --> 02:10:32.980
I guess I'm okay right now.
Yeah.
But at home I'll just be,

2028
02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:35.270
I'll be late to stuff for sure.
Yeah.

2029
02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:37.070
Like I should get in the shower and I'm like,
well I should,

2030
02:10:37.370 --> 02:10:41.510
I should watch porn before I get in the shower.
Right.
I was late to the school,

2031
02:10:41.511 --> 02:10:43.160
our brothers one time I was watching porn.

2032
02:10:46.090 --> 02:10:49.790
Where's there an any situation?
Cause I don't,
I'm not interested in ass ever.

2033
02:10:49.791 --> 02:10:54.110
And people always tell me what if someone's showers completely and you see that

2034
02:10:54.111 --> 02:10:57.170
and I'm like,
I still don't want to tell you why.
I mean real talk.

2035
02:10:57.200 --> 02:11:01.040
I love taking shits.
I love,
I like Browning and I,

2036
02:11:01.130 --> 02:11:05.150
to me it's not sexual and I don't want a dick or a finger or anything in there.

2037
02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:09.470
It's not hygienic man.
There's Poopoo in there.
Yeah,
Google comes out.

2038
02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:13.520
It smells bad.
A couple of Nice lips look couple miles back there.

2039
02:11:14.170 --> 02:11:18.590
Just eating up some lunch.
Have you always wanted this?
No,

2040
02:11:19.940 --> 02:11:24.800
of course.
It's never going to have be my scrub master.
No,

2041
02:11:25.450 --> 02:11:30.290
he's his bottles.
Harry.
He's here.
You'd have to get it.
Whitey.
Yeah,
he's nasty.

2042
02:11:30.291 --> 02:11:34.070
You know it's a hot bag.
They're even touched a guy's butthole.
Yeah.
I actually,

2043
02:11:34.071 --> 02:11:37.670
one of my,
yeah,
I have,
I've been in there.
It's not nice.

2044
02:11:37.790 --> 02:11:40.820
It's like it hot and steamy and Harry will cause then you don't want to do

2045
02:11:40.821 --> 02:11:43.460
anything else with your hand of course.
And you have to like,

2046
02:11:43.530 --> 02:11:46.100
you're just thinking about it too much.

2047
02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:51.120
It's a surprise digit in there from a real SLU tea.

2048
02:11:52.190 --> 02:11:56.870
And then I returned the favor and there was a lot of chocolate.

2049
02:11:58.850 --> 02:12:03.580
Yes.
What slow is this?
Went.
Oh,
you're African slash.

2050
02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:08.060
No.
Well that's uh,
yeah,
the porn stars.

2051
02:12:08.061 --> 02:12:09.830
I watched this interview thing and it's like,

2052
02:12:09.831 --> 02:12:11.480
what's your most embarrassing moment on set?

2053
02:12:11.481 --> 02:12:13.700
And they've all shat in someone like everyone.

2054
02:12:13.701 --> 02:12:17.370
I believe that that's where like if you're going to play,
yeah,
you're gonna,

2055
02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:20.120
you're going to encounter it.
And then the other crazy thing,

2056
02:12:20.121 --> 02:12:23.780
if they work on their periods,
they put makeup sponges in there,

2057
02:12:23.781 --> 02:12:26.360
pussy and then sometimes they forget about it.

2058
02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:29.270
And that's the other thing that people talk about.

2059
02:12:29.271 --> 02:12:32.420
It's like you'll just get a girl at onset and they smell so bad and it's because

2060
02:12:32.421 --> 02:12:36.080
they forgot their makeup sponge up their makeups now away from us.

2061
02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:40.070
I was like,
just put like sponge,

2062
02:12:40.071 --> 02:12:43.850
like there's an actual menstrual sponge you can put up there or it's a form of

2063
02:12:43.851 --> 02:12:47.450
birth control.
I feel.
I bought a cup and it was very difficult.

2064
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:51.950
I did not work for me.
Imagine like being,
it was not good.
Too much work.

2065
02:12:52.190 --> 02:12:54.260
It was,
it was a problem for sure.

2066
02:12:54.290 --> 02:12:56.150
But that's the thing was also being with a girl.
No,

2067
02:12:56.151 --> 02:12:58.550
the periods that are the ones really that grossed out,

2068
02:12:59.510 --> 02:13:04.390
which is helpful way,
but then when you're both on your ladies,
we were,

2069
02:13:04.550 --> 02:13:08.060
we'd had,
that never happened.
Oh,
but you don't,
you go downstairs,

2070
02:13:08.061 --> 02:13:11.370
you go downtown when she's on her.
I didn't,
but she,

2071
02:13:11.550 --> 02:13:14.600
there was just like blood all over our hands,
but no one really cared.

2072
02:13:15.410 --> 02:13:19.160
It was kind of an invigorating,
I dunno,
I liked it.
I am so square.

2073
02:13:19.460 --> 02:13:24.020
Apparently I'm the man.
Well,
but you're getting it in more often.
Like,

2074
02:13:24.021 --> 02:13:26.700
I'm pretty sexual I guess in a creep.
But I don't,
I,

2075
02:13:26.860 --> 02:13:30.590
I not enough people want to have sex with me.
So it's a problem.
No,

2076
02:13:30.591 --> 02:13:32.610
I'm telling like I haven't had sex in a year.

2077
02:13:32.611 --> 02:13:35.470
I fucked this weird couple in Scottsdale exactly a year ago.
That's correct.

2078
02:13:36.990 --> 02:13:40.750
Yeah.
We were just talking about how Arizona is so weird for that kind of stuff.

2079
02:13:40.751 --> 02:13:44.070
Swingers.
Yeah,
they don't do anything.
It's hot.
They have nowhere to go.

2080
02:13:44.071 --> 02:13:47.880
And then the houses are cheap so they have enough room to do what they want.

2081
02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:53.040
And you so he had sex with a married couple or just start Tinder?

2082
02:13:53.070 --> 02:13:53.551
Well,

2083
02:13:53.551 --> 02:13:56.370
cause I didn't know if I was gay or not what I was going to do and I hadn't,

2084
02:13:56.490 --> 02:13:58.770
I was like,
I hadn't hooked up since I got dumped.

2085
02:13:58.771 --> 02:14:00.870
So I was like I'll fuck a couple.

2086
02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:04.860
And so I found them on Tinder and there was a hotter couple that I met,

2087
02:14:04.861 --> 02:14:08.220
but I did it.
A couple on Tinder or are you just looking for one person?
Like,

2088
02:14:08.270 --> 02:14:12.930
usually if you,
if you look for girls on dating apps,
it's,

2089
02:14:13.110 --> 02:14:16.470
there's so many couples to the point where lesbians were not interested in

2090
02:14:16.471 --> 02:14:18.810
threesomes.
I don't want to fuck your boyfriend.

2091
02:14:18.811 --> 02:14:23.220
So a lot of couples will go on as just the girl.
Wow.
Yeah.

2092
02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:26.130
And they had tattoos and stuff.
So I chose them.

2093
02:14:26.190 --> 02:14:31.190
I feel like Phoenix is the city where over the last 10 years has to be four or

2094
02:14:32.701 --> 02:14:35.670
five times where people like a couple have been like,

2095
02:14:36.450 --> 02:14:39.570
do you want to hang out tonight?
And I'm like,
don't want to hang out tonight.
And

2096
02:14:41.820 --> 02:14:45.390
Phoenix always.
I feel like it's in the water there.
Yeah.

2097
02:14:45.391 --> 02:14:46.980
There's a lot of partiers out there.

2098
02:14:47.010 --> 02:14:51.840
It attracts a certain party girl or a party guy shows in Scottsdale.

2099
02:14:51.841 --> 02:14:54.150
Guy came up to me after my sentence that just so you know,

2100
02:14:54.151 --> 02:14:58.470
she squirts all over me all the time.
Thanks.
Yeah,
it's cool.

2101
02:14:58.900 --> 02:15:02.100
Yeah,
no there.
I felt more connected to this couple,

2102
02:15:02.101 --> 02:15:05.010
but then it wasn't a good thing.
They had like neon blue lights around the bed.

2103
02:15:05.100 --> 02:15:10.020
Oh God.
It was bad.
That's terrible.
But I stayed and I,
he was racist.

2104
02:15:10.021 --> 02:15:14.720
I think that's right up your alley.
Yeah.
Perfect.

2105
02:15:15.630 --> 02:15:19.230
No,
he was gross.
She was pretty fun.
See that?
Yeah.

2106
02:15:19.231 --> 02:15:21.390
I just have to find a girlfriend.
Not so sure.

2107
02:15:21.391 --> 02:15:24.060
There are people that will like fuck me,
but like I want,
you know,

2108
02:15:24.090 --> 02:15:28.590
I want to like the person of course course.
But um,
I can't,

2109
02:15:28.710 --> 02:15:30.840
he was just nasty looking dude.
He just,

2110
02:15:30.841 --> 02:15:33.450
it was more about him and he kept trying to be bossy and it wasn't about

2111
02:15:33.451 --> 02:15:37.620
everyone's it,
he was just like to me,
me,
me and bothered me.

2112
02:15:37.620 --> 02:15:40.410
And it seemed like she was trying to like please him verse herself.

2113
02:15:40.411 --> 02:15:43.980
I just didn't like the dynamics of,
and then in the more,
not in the morning,

2114
02:15:43.981 --> 02:15:44.820
I didn't stay overnight,

2115
02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:48.150
but afterwards I was waiting for my car and he told his wife,
he goes,
Hey,

2116
02:15:48.151 --> 02:15:50.820
don't forget to ask you.
I ice your pussy so it doesn't hurt in the morning.

2117
02:15:51.900 --> 02:15:55.110
Which means,
which meant that he said that regularly.

2118
02:15:56.440 --> 02:16:01.170
Tell you
yes.
It's like they're just fucking for pay.

2119
02:16:01.171 --> 02:16:04.810
I don't know.
It just was weird.
I got to tell you,

2120
02:16:05.190 --> 02:16:09.150
if you're in a married relationship and you have family and a mortgage and all

2121
02:16:09.151 --> 02:16:12.240
that,
it just seems crazy.
Doesn't it seem crazy to you?
It was normal to me

2122
02:16:13.860 --> 02:16:14.461
to be like,
yeah,

2123
02:16:14.461 --> 02:16:19.461
let's just meet the strange nice lady on an app and then hover over and the

2124
02:16:19.651 --> 02:16:23.760
party man as a crazy alive,
so it's a party and it was funny.

2125
02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:27.180
They were telling me how all of his family like hates her and the whole time I

2126
02:16:27.181 --> 02:16:31.640
was like,
yeah,
I get what's happening here.
Of course.

2127
02:16:31.660 --> 02:16:36.280
Are The black shirts of the family,
was there an age gap between them?
You know,

2128
02:16:36.490 --> 02:16:40.790
but she was from Iowa.
She was just,
you seem very like,
you're like,
it's,

2129
02:16:40.791 --> 02:16:43.390
that's what I did.
Did,
did you have threesomes before?

2130
02:16:43.570 --> 02:16:47.230
I had one for some of my life before that and they were in the front row at

2131
02:16:47.231 --> 02:16:51.160
Caroline's.
Wow.
They took me,

2132
02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:55.370
they basically after the set we talked and then we had a drain.

2133
02:16:56.250 --> 02:17:00.880
It was two guys and a girl and I've been telling this story for so long.

2134
02:17:00.881 --> 02:17:03.460
I'm so boring.
Like,
I need a new sex story.
But,
um,

2135
02:17:03.700 --> 02:17:07.660
I thought the guy was hot and so I waited for them and then we chit chatted and

2136
02:17:07.661 --> 02:17:10.320
then after her to drink,
they were like,
listen,
we're actually not a couple.

2137
02:17:10.340 --> 02:17:14.320
We're all here to fuck each other.
We have a hotel room,
there's coke,
Molly,

2138
02:17:14.380 --> 02:17:17.890
we'd love for you to come.
Wow.
And I said,
absolutely.

2139
02:17:18.750 --> 02:17:22.180
And do you do do,
you'd have to do the drugs?
I don't like cocaine,

2140
02:17:22.181 --> 02:17:27.130
but I did Molly.
I love Molly was a crazy experience.
It was awesome.

2141
02:17:27.190 --> 02:17:31.900
It was like all my dreams came true.
It really was like a fantasy fulfilled.

2142
02:17:31.930 --> 02:17:34.780
It was fine.
Yeah.
I liked it.
And they were,

2143
02:17:34.810 --> 02:17:38.180
they were good people that are like a drawer full of toy,
you know?

2144
02:17:38.260 --> 02:17:41.200
They were like prepared.
This is their hobby and something like that.

2145
02:17:41.201 --> 02:17:43.210
How long do you stay?
You know what I mean?
Like,
oh,

2146
02:17:43.211 --> 02:17:47.590
I went straight to my babysitting job in the morning from,
yeah,

2147
02:17:48.100 --> 02:17:51.160
I'm glad you guys have a gnarly,
did you shower him before?
No.

2148
02:17:51.161 --> 02:17:52.710
And I didn't think I was going to have a wild night,

2149
02:17:52.711 --> 02:17:55.930
so I don't even have my phone charger or anything and I just showed up in black

2150
02:17:55.931 --> 02:18:00.880
heeled boots and like a black dress with lace sleeves at eight 15 in the
morning.

2151
02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:03.420
So the upper east side where they cool.
No,

2152
02:18:03.421 --> 02:18:08.320
the mom knew something was wrong with the mom knew I was a backup nanny,

2153
02:18:08.321 --> 02:18:09.870
so I worked for an agency for years,

2154
02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:14.510
so I just showed up and did like last minute care.
She knows she went to where,

2155
02:18:14.511 --> 02:18:18.340
I mean it is wild that people,
maybe they trust the agency,

2156
02:18:18.341 --> 02:18:22.000
but the amount of,
even tiny babies I would show up and they'd be like,

2157
02:18:22.300 --> 02:18:26.680
notes are on the table by,
and I'm like,
all right.
It is weird.

2158
02:18:26.681 --> 02:18:29.440
I mean I was very good at my job and I care about children,

2159
02:18:29.470 --> 02:18:34.470
but it is really crazy that they just trusted a 20 something girl.

2160
02:18:34.781 --> 02:18:38.410
I would usually show up in sweatpants and they would just leave me with their

2161
02:18:38.411 --> 02:18:42.190
three months old.
It's for days.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
I don't know.

2162
02:18:42.191 --> 02:18:44.260
I'm not down with that shit at all.
No,
it's weird.

2163
02:18:44.600 --> 02:18:45.970
It's fucking know who watches your kid,

2164
02:18:46.030 --> 02:18:48.130
you have your anatomy but then do your parents or something or you have a

2165
02:18:48.131 --> 02:18:52.990
babysitter?
We have no parents involved.
Just like,
yeah,

2166
02:18:52.991 --> 02:18:55.030
a couple people that we trust.
Okay.

2167
02:18:55.150 --> 02:18:58.930
Like our lady's been with us since Ellis was four months old.
He's three now.

2168
02:18:59.020 --> 02:19:03.700
He's three now.
Like we were very,
no way,
dude.
No fucking way.
No,

2169
02:19:03.701 --> 02:19:06.610
it was weird because I would come from partying all the time.

2170
02:19:06.630 --> 02:19:11.610
I can't believe I've babysat probably over a hundred families and um,

2171
02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:14.080
my butt back to this person.
Oh yeah.

2172
02:19:14.110 --> 02:19:18.940
I gotta ask you because I always wonder because I'm so uptight.
Like,
I mean I be,

2173
02:19:18.970 --> 02:19:22.830
what don't you like so be in your head like,
oh,
I'm so fat.

2174
02:19:23.020 --> 02:19:26.500
I'm fatter than anybody here.
And like,
well yeah,
it wasn't shaved her,

2175
02:19:26.501 --> 02:19:30.740
I wasn't for a wild night.
Well we were on Molly,

2176
02:19:30.741 --> 02:19:33.980
so I just feel like you kind of feel great.
But they also were,

2177
02:19:34.010 --> 02:19:36.620
cause we would take breaks or chill or two people.
We had watched,

2178
02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:41.120
it was like an all night kind of extravaganza.
So while we like chatted,

2179
02:19:41.121 --> 02:19:43.670
they were like really impressed with like,
we can't believe it's your first time,

2180
02:19:43.671 --> 02:19:46.640
you're really in it.
And I'm like,
thank you.
So I felt good.
Yeah,

2181
02:19:46.641 --> 02:19:47.474
they were in town,

2182
02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:50.510
the other one's wife was coming and they were all going to go to some sex party.

2183
02:19:50.511 --> 02:19:53.180
Like this is their hobby because people always ask,
they're like,

2184
02:19:53.181 --> 02:19:56.630
where their condoms?
I'm like,
yes,
this is what they do.
They're not,

2185
02:19:56.900 --> 02:19:59.780
they're not going to fuck with.
And they all,
here's the thing though.

2186
02:19:59.781 --> 02:20:04.220
A lot of times you watch these shows like real sex and stuff.
Yeah.
We're like,

2187
02:20:04.221 --> 02:20:08.920
you know these documentaries and like there's some real dogs doing this.

2188
02:20:09.460 --> 02:20:11.660
Are they trying to,
the guy was not hot,

2189
02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:15.590
but the other guy was really high and the girl was really queue.

2190
02:20:15.680 --> 02:20:18.890
But neither of their dicks for like giant or anything.

2191
02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:24.560
But they had tons of dildos.
Right.
So they didn't care.
Yeah.

2192
02:20:24.800 --> 02:20:28.780
More than enough.
But yeah,
maybe it's a dude.

2193
02:20:28.940 --> 02:20:33.320
I got real sex was weird for sure cause that's how I got my sex education was

2194
02:20:33.321 --> 02:20:38.321
real sex and Howard stern at midnight after SNL I'd put it on and I remember

2195
02:20:39.351 --> 02:20:40.550
that real sex show.
You're right.

2196
02:20:40.551 --> 02:20:44.060
It was always like we're into group masturbation and it was like the most

2197
02:20:44.061 --> 02:20:47.360
unattractive people in the world that you would never want to be naked.

2198
02:20:47.420 --> 02:20:49.250
So many glass dildo episodes.

2199
02:20:49.580 --> 02:20:52.520
There was just always making glass dildos at factories.

2200
02:20:53.490 --> 02:20:55.400
Like how many fucking pony tails we're going to see.

2201
02:20:56.350 --> 02:20:58.820
My friend just recently got a new pony and he's like,

2202
02:20:58.821 --> 02:21:02.300
I think people are treating me different and like they sure are.
They sure are.

2203
02:21:02.420 --> 02:21:06.050
I'm like,
you're basically like,
hey dude.
He's like,
it's not fair.
I'm like,
no,

2204
02:21:06.051 --> 02:21:08.230
but you can cut it off.
Yeah,
it's,
yeah.

2205
02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:11.700
People are not going to be nice to know what's happening.
Shoveled.

2206
02:21:12.020 --> 02:21:13.490
You're unlikeable and you're pushy.

2207
02:21:16.610 --> 02:21:20.720
I was just trying to make a point about how people talk about women.
I just,

2208
02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:25.190
I dunno.
I thought you were great on that.
I had so much fun,

2209
02:21:25.191 --> 02:21:28.220
but I think people are,
people are like,
you don't know about politics.
I'm like,

2210
02:21:28.540 --> 02:21:30.800
you,
we don't know shit.
It's whatever.

2211
02:21:30.801 --> 02:21:33.980
Like anybody who comments on anything,

2212
02:21:34.010 --> 02:21:35.750
there's going to be people that say that on,
you know what I mean?

2213
02:21:35.751 --> 02:21:40.450
Like you could say that about football.
You could say it about,
uh,

2214
02:21:40.940 --> 02:21:44.570
hunting.
You can say it about politics.
Like if you make a comment.
Yeah.

2215
02:21:44.750 --> 02:21:46.490
And it's a on a popular platform.

2216
02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:51.680
I guess that's what it is to where I've never usually,
no one cares what I say.

2217
02:21:51.681 --> 02:21:53.510
So I guess I was shocked that People Watch,

2218
02:21:53.511 --> 02:21:56.600
you're getting the experience of a lot of people paying attention to it.

2219
02:21:56.660 --> 02:21:58.270
That's what it is.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2220
02:21:58.580 --> 02:22:01.990
And then best thing to do is to do what you did and not engage it.

2221
02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:05.470
At first it was like all these fun gifts and I was like,
this is fun.

2222
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:08.810
I love the new,
I don't know.
I doubt it's new,
but I like when people say like,

2223
02:22:08.900 --> 02:22:13.420
I see no lies.
I like that.
I got a lot of this.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2224
02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:17.700
Well,
I think are in the era of,
um,
you know,
nobody,
you,

2225
02:22:17.760 --> 02:22:21.350
you don't have to be an expert in anything anymore,
just have an opinion,

2226
02:22:21.351 --> 02:22:24.650
which is kind of great and kind of not great simultaneously,
you know,

2227
02:22:24.651 --> 02:22:29.250
cause you don't get the,
if you do make a comment and you're not an expert,

2228
02:22:29.251 --> 02:22:31.980
people shit on you.
However,
because of the Internet,

2229
02:22:31.981 --> 02:22:34.770
it's like the democratization of information and he ever,

2230
02:22:34.771 --> 02:22:37.860
anybody can read anything and figure shit out and I don't think we're actually

2231
02:22:37.861 --> 02:22:40.470
reading anything.
I think,
I know for me it's just headlines,

2232
02:22:40.471 --> 02:22:44.940
Twitter and what my top friends tell me.
Yeah.
That's why when people were like,

2233
02:22:44.941 --> 02:22:47.970
you don't have a grasp on modern politics.
I'm like,
I'm sure you're right,

2234
02:22:47.971 --> 02:22:51.720
but I don't think you have more than me.
Right.
I just don't buy that.

2235
02:22:51.721 --> 02:22:53.550
They're smarter than me.
And you're a comedian.

2236
02:22:53.551 --> 02:22:56.790
Your job is to be funny and entertaining and you did that.
Yeah.

2237
02:22:56.791 --> 02:22:59.610
They're just evil.
I don't know what their goal is.
Go to work.

2238
02:22:59.611 --> 02:23:01.350
Like I just don't understand what you're doing.

2239
02:23:01.351 --> 02:23:04.870
You're tagging every single black person that follows me.
Yeah.

2240
02:23:05.250 --> 02:23:08.960
It's like insane.
A lot of time it's not so crazy this direction.

2241
02:23:09.360 --> 02:23:13.920
I wonder if they all know each other.
No,
probably now.
And they're like,

2242
02:23:13.921 --> 02:23:16.710
if you were this progressive person that loves Bernie,

2243
02:23:16.711 --> 02:23:18.510
why are you shutting people down?

2244
02:23:19.070 --> 02:23:23.540
<v 0>Dude?
It's,
it's not indicative.
I think look like social media isn't even reality,</v>

2245
02:23:23.630 --> 02:23:26.450
you know?
Yeah.
Really you can get lost in it.
That's the danger.

2246
02:23:26.470 --> 02:23:31.470
You can get lost in it and you can start to think that this is the world and

2247
02:23:31.521 --> 02:23:35.030
then you realize if you do what you did like jump off for a couple of days,

2248
02:23:35.031 --> 02:23:37.660
you realize like that's not the world.
Yeah,
I was,

2249
02:23:37.820 --> 02:23:42.820
I was going down some crazy rabbit hole that I can get so involved in that.

2250
02:23:44.541 --> 02:23:46.170
I think it's everything and it's,

2251
02:23:46.171 --> 02:23:49.640
it's not a really a reflection of the real world.
No.

2252
02:23:49.900 --> 02:23:54.050
So not at all.
Um,
then we are to be off of my phone.
Yeah.

2253
02:23:54.170 --> 02:23:55.490
It was probably healthy though for you.

2254
02:23:55.870 --> 02:23:56.920
<v 22>No,
I was listening to this.</v>

2255
02:23:56.950 --> 02:24:01.270
I think it was actually Dr Drew's podcast about habits.
Anyway,

2256
02:24:01.271 --> 02:24:04.000
this person was saying when they could write and they were sitting down to
write,

2257
02:24:04.001 --> 02:24:06.820
they would leave their phone in another room in the house.

2258
02:24:07.150 --> 02:24:11.140
And that way they weren't tempted to compulsively look at the phone cause it's a

2259
02:24:11.141 --> 02:24:14.200
compulsion at this point.
Most of read that it's like,
um,

2260
02:24:14.220 --> 02:24:17.920
it's having a slot machine in your pocket because not every time you get

2261
02:24:17.921 --> 02:24:22.690
dopamine,
but you know it's coming soon with any like,
or message or text.
Yeah.

2262
02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:25.660
So you just keep checking it for the hope that someone's giving you attention.

2263
02:24:25.780 --> 02:24:26.740
Right.
I know.

2264
02:24:26.741 --> 02:24:30.430
I wish I can get a land line and just have an answering machine and live that

2265
02:24:30.431 --> 02:24:34.330
life.
I want to go back.
You can't sell bad.
Yeah,
we'll see.
I Dunno,
I'm real,

2266
02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:37.600
because when I,
I've,
I have been leaving my phone at home if I just,

2267
02:24:37.630 --> 02:24:40.480
I'm leaving the house for a few hours.
Right.
But the whole time I'm like,

2268
02:24:40.870 --> 02:24:44.320
I'm reaching for it constantly.
Or I'm about to,
Oh,
I should message this person.

2269
02:24:44.350 --> 02:24:47.920
Oh,
I should take a photo.
Oh,
I should,
you know,
it's the story that it is weird.

2270
02:24:47.950 --> 02:24:50.440
Even without it.
I'm just thinking about it all the time.
You know,

2271
02:24:50.780 --> 02:24:55.310
<v 0>Arusha fear is like big on that.
Yes.
He has a flip phone,
he has a flip phone,</v>

2272
02:24:55.311 --> 02:24:59.920
which has totally psychotic,
but he's always encouraging us,
um,

2273
02:25:00.410 --> 02:25:04.970
to like take social media off our phones and all that stuff.
And you know,

2274
02:25:05.060 --> 02:25:06.230
sometimes I,

2275
02:25:06.260 --> 02:25:09.980
he'll hit me with the right message on the right day about it and I'll,

2276
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:13.580
I'll just like not look that day and I do feel better.

2277
02:25:14.230 --> 02:25:16.360
<v 22>Yeah.
You get more done.
I mean,
that's what I was reading too.</v>

2278
02:25:16.361 --> 02:25:19.900
It's like our memories and experiences are going to be looking at our phone

2279
02:25:19.901 --> 02:25:23.050
because we're,
it's hard for our brains to multitask.

2280
02:25:23.290 --> 02:25:26.110
So all the new experiences that we're having in our brains,

2281
02:25:26.111 --> 02:25:27.430
remembering his phone related,

2282
02:25:27.450 --> 02:25:31.600
like we're not creating new memories with the world around us.
Right.

2283
02:25:32.290 --> 02:25:36.100
It's wild.
Yeah.
But we're addicted.
We're totally addictive.

2284
02:25:36.310 --> 02:25:40.570
But I bought a planner and an alarm clock,
but I keep just on my phone.
I can't,

2285
02:25:40.571 --> 02:25:44.560
I don't know.
Hmm.
Oh,
never.
No,
it's dwindling down.

2286
02:25:44.740 --> 02:25:49.180
Let me ask you a road stuff or you have anything coming up?
Um,
yeah,

2287
02:25:49.270 --> 02:25:53.890
I'm going to be in Vancouver for JFL fantastic city.
One of my favorite cities.

2288
02:25:54.040 --> 02:25:55.840
I don't know where I'm going to be.
Honestly.

2289
02:25:56.710 --> 02:26:00.560
I'm glitter cheese that are all of you.

2290
02:26:02.290 --> 02:26:05.140
I don't know where I'm going to be.
Well I know you're going to be in Fort Worth,

2291
02:26:05.141 --> 02:26:08.980
Texas I think in March.
Okay.
And that's it.

2292
02:26:09.070 --> 02:26:12.470
And she'll be at the brazzers booth.
Yeah.
Browsers.

2293
02:26:12.490 --> 02:26:16.810
I bought a really slutty outfit.
Oh yeah,
the Internet.

2294
02:26:17.170 --> 02:26:22.090
Do you shop on [inaudible]?
No,
I've seen it.
Yeah.
No I don't.

2295
02:26:22.150 --> 02:26:24.900
It's so good.
Okay.
We have to do is just get a quick update.

2296
02:26:25.020 --> 02:26:28.890
<v 0>Um,
so as you know,
the studio is still under construction.</v>

2297
02:26:28.891 --> 02:26:30.990
There's still soundproofing.
Um,

2298
02:26:31.290 --> 02:26:36.290
we actually had to shut down soundproofing because other businesses in this

2299
02:26:36.691 --> 02:26:39.720
business park where like what the fuck is going on over there?

2300
02:26:39.930 --> 02:26:43.830
Cause it was so loud and that has delayed a couple of things.
Right.
So what,

2301
02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:46.830
what's up with the other shows coming to the,
to our channel.

2302
02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:51.400
<v 16>So right now the tentative schedule is for the other shows to be starting around</v>

2303
02:26:51.401 --> 02:26:56.170
February,
like February 1st week of February,
first week,

2304
02:26:56.171 --> 02:26:59.350
second week of February.
We'll start staggering them out.
So you know,

2305
02:26:59.500 --> 02:27:03.480
we'll start off with either Dr Drew's show Sickler Santina.
Okay.
Um,

2306
02:27:03.730 --> 02:27:06.460
and also San now since he's recording in his other studio,

2307
02:27:06.461 --> 02:27:09.610
we'll start posting some of those videos that he's recording the different

2308
02:27:09.611 --> 02:27:10.810
location until he starts here.

2309
02:27:10.870 --> 02:27:14.980
<v 0>Okay.
So we'll put like his videos on our channel.
Yes.
Okay,</v>

2310
02:27:15.610 --> 02:27:16.930
<v 16>great.
Coming in February.</v>

2311
02:27:17.710 --> 02:27:22.690
<v 22>[inaudible] is such a cool married couple.
Thanks.
You're really doing it.
Yeah,</v>

2312
02:27:22.750 --> 02:27:24.610
I love her.
Are you guys going to write a book or what?

2313
02:27:25.090 --> 02:27:29.530
I know we've made babies advice.
We made two children already.
Yeah.
Advice.

2314
02:27:29.531 --> 02:27:31.750
I don't know for advice.
I don't think so.

2315
02:27:31.780 --> 02:27:34.960
Well it seems like you're happy and honest with each other.
I don't know.

2316
02:27:35.380 --> 02:27:39.430
I think this podcast is our,
uh,
our gift to the world,
right?
Yeah.

2317
02:27:39.431 --> 02:27:43.390
Kind of total.
Totally like ourselves.

2318
02:27:43.780 --> 02:27:47.040
Can I tell you what it is?
It's the best actually advisor,

2319
02:27:47.050 --> 02:27:51.850
whatever is as a married couple is find something you enjoy doing together.

2320
02:27:51.880 --> 02:27:55.600
Like this is kind of what he and I do together that we did before we had

2321
02:27:55.601 --> 02:27:59.050
children.
So kind of reminds us of a time of total silliness.

2322
02:27:59.650 --> 02:28:01.710
Total lack of responsibility.
We were just to,

2323
02:28:01.711 --> 02:28:04.840
Dick had comedians who started a show.
So yeah,

2324
02:28:04.841 --> 02:28:08.590
if you find something you enjoy doing outside of like children and career or

2325
02:28:08.591 --> 02:28:12.850
whatever,
if you can't,
I mean,
even though this is our job,
but yeah,
that helps.

2326
02:28:12.851 --> 02:28:17.760
That's huge.
Like a hobby together.
Something you can do together.
Uh,

2327
02:28:18.150 --> 02:28:22.160
any tennis.
What else do you guys do?
Do you guys do nights?
Yes.

2328
02:28:22.190 --> 02:28:25.820
<v 6>We have date night,
Karen this week.
Thursday.
Yup.
Yes.</v>

2329
02:28:25.850 --> 02:28:28.420
You start to schedule it more when you have babies.
You're like,

2330
02:28:28.460 --> 02:28:33.420
we will have dinner on Thursday.
No,
having babies seems insane.
It's,
it's,
yeah.

2331
02:28:33.890 --> 02:28:38.300
Having more than one baby's insane.
Dude.
I just remembered something.
I was like,

2332
02:28:38.301 --> 02:28:40.370
have you got any date?
We're doing some gigs together.
Yeah.

2333
02:28:40.430 --> 02:28:44.450
I'm opening for you in Boston.
Oh,
there you go.
I'm so excited.
Yeah.

2334
02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:48.390
She's super funds that people know those Boston shows.

2335
02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:53.480
Is it April or May?
One of the April or May.
We're actually,

2336
02:28:54.050 --> 02:28:58.490
that's exciting.
So go see Lee's opened for Tommy Bunch.
Louder.

2337
02:28:58.700 --> 02:29:03.440
Yes.
We are getting from this.
I'm telling you.

2338
02:29:03.441 --> 02:29:06.770
I'll tell you right now,
it's uh,
it's April.
You're right.

2339
02:29:06.800 --> 02:29:10.340
We're actually starting in Bethlehem,
pa.
Oh,
cool.
On the sands casino.

2340
02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:15.350
And then we're doing Medford,
which is just outside of Boston,
like 15 minutes.

2341
02:29:15.380 --> 02:29:18.790
Then we do proper Boston and then we'd go back to Medford.
Wow.

2342
02:29:18.870 --> 02:29:23.120
So we're going back and forth.
Uh,
but we're gonna end up doing one,
two,
three,

2343
02:29:23.121 --> 02:29:23.960
four,
five.

2344
02:29:24.250 --> 02:29:28.420
<v 22>Wow,
that's so wild.</v>

2345
02:29:28.950 --> 02:29:33.010
I'll see her.
Sealys a trigger on a,
the degenerates.
What number are you on?

2346
02:29:33.011 --> 02:29:36.880
That one?
I forget.
Number four.
Check her out.
She's number four.

2347
02:29:37.390 --> 02:29:40.730
Did you guys already talk about how the door almost fallen you?
Yeah,
lot.

2348
02:29:40.750 --> 02:29:45.190
Countless Times.
What a nightmare.
What a fucking shit show.
I can't believe it.

2349
02:29:45.191 --> 02:29:49.120
How am I,
how many weeks or days later did you give birth?
Oh,

2350
02:29:49.121 --> 02:29:53.320
about six weeks later.
Okay.
So,
yeah,

2351
02:29:53.321 --> 02:29:56.560
that was like the last thing I did and I just sat in my pool for the rest of the

2352
02:29:56.560 --> 02:29:59.650
summer.
I have a special kind of brag thing.
I know you're trying to end this,

2353
02:29:59.651 --> 02:30:04.360
but I have friends here and I was with them the day she found out she was

2354
02:30:04.361 --> 02:30:07.960
pregnant with her second baby and then wildly I was in town and I was going to

2355
02:30:07.961 --> 02:30:12.170
her house and I was there the day her water broke.
So the day,
yeah,

2356
02:30:12.190 --> 02:30:15.820
I felt really special and cool.
And I met the baby yesterday or two days ago,

2357
02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:20.530
so she don't go,
go.
Um,
she's good.
I don't know,
it's her,

2358
02:30:20.780 --> 02:30:22.210
it was an unplanned thing.

2359
02:30:22.211 --> 02:30:24.700
So their babies one and a half and now they have a two month old.

2360
02:30:26.050 --> 02:30:30.040
So it's really an it say goodbye to her for her because the baby doesn't even

2361
02:30:30.041 --> 02:30:33.880
understand why anything.
It's like they have two babies.

2362
02:30:34.210 --> 02:30:38.260
That's crazy town.
That's a crazy short age gap.
Yeah.

2363
02:30:38.261 --> 02:30:41.340
But if you're just saying you're going to get pregnant.
That's right.

2364
02:30:41.670 --> 02:30:42.620
That's right.

2365
02:30:42.760 --> 02:30:46.640
<v 6>Do you watch,
um,
uh,
what's it called?
You know,
I was pregnant.</v>

2366
02:30:46.650 --> 02:30:50.480
Teen moms know love after lock lock going.
Yeah,

2367
02:30:50.750 --> 02:30:55.480
no love after a lockup is fucking amazing.
And that's on,
what is it?

2368
02:30:55.481 --> 02:30:57.030
We TV or something,
something like that.

2369
02:30:57.031 --> 02:31:00.280
It's on iTunes and it's people that meet people on the inside,
you know,

2370
02:31:00.281 --> 02:31:04.210
like they do the pen pal thing.
Uh,
there's sites for like,
Hey,

2371
02:31:04.211 --> 02:31:05.740
do you want to meet a felon?
I guess.

2372
02:31:06.010 --> 02:31:11.010
And they start these romances and then it continues,

2373
02:31:11.141 --> 02:31:14.500
you know,
the,
the camera crew joins as a person is released.

2374
02:31:14.800 --> 02:31:18.040
It's a basically a formula for disaster every time.

2375
02:31:18.070 --> 02:31:20.190
But there's couple

2376
02:31:21.030 --> 02:31:22.710
<v 0>where this is like my favorite,</v>

2377
02:31:24.060 --> 02:31:29.060
the guy and the girl had a baby like three months before he went to prison.

2378
02:31:29.760 --> 02:31:34.200
He's getting out of prison.
He now likes another girl,
not the,

2379
02:31:34.260 --> 02:31:37.530
the baby's mother.
And he's like,
I'm going to have,
I have to have sex with her,

2380
02:31:37.531 --> 02:31:41.190
keep her chill.
And then she's like,
we're not going to use,

2381
02:31:41.540 --> 02:31:45.630
you don't have protection.
But it's like,
I dunno,
we'll see.

2382
02:31:46.560 --> 02:31:49.740
We'll just see what happens.
And then like,

2383
02:31:49.741 --> 02:31:54.741
but she's also realizes that he's totally unstable and not,

2384
02:31:55.200 --> 02:31:55.830
you know,

2385
02:31:55.830 --> 02:31:58.740
<v 22>yeah.
But she's thinking if I could lock him down with two babies,</v>

2386
02:31:58.800 --> 02:32:01.740
he's not gonna leave me one baby.
Someone can walk.

2387
02:32:01.770 --> 02:32:05.340
But she's thinking like two babies.
Yeah.
That's what I do with you.

2388
02:32:05.430 --> 02:32:08.540
I know you guys,
Svu fans are now linode RSV,

2389
02:32:08.700 --> 02:32:12.120
but I feel like he should be cause he loves crime and killing so much.

2390
02:32:12.180 --> 02:32:15.600
I love Mariska.
Hargitay yeah,
there's just good detectives.

2391
02:32:15.690 --> 02:32:17.490
Benson unstable or there's just great.

2392
02:32:17.491 --> 02:32:22.491
But there was one episode with John Stamos and he was a reproductive rapist.

2393
02:32:22.870 --> 02:32:26.640
Oh,
where do you would have consensual sex with women,
but poke holes in condoms.

2394
02:32:26.990 --> 02:32:30.510
And so we had dozens of babies everywhere and he just kept wanting to make more

2395
02:32:30.511 --> 02:32:32.760
and more babies.
Oh,
that's nasty.
Yeah.

2396
02:32:32.790 --> 02:32:36.390
But John Stamos is one of the only people I've seen in person that I got giddy

2397
02:32:36.391 --> 02:32:40.860
and like lost my breath.
Like he is really handsome,
handsome.
I never ages,

2398
02:32:40.920 --> 02:32:44.820
I couldn't even get my words together.
I've never felt that way before.

2399
02:32:44.880 --> 02:32:48.840
But he really is hot.
Yes.
John Stamos.

2400
02:32:48.860 --> 02:32:51.330
That Dude's genetically gifted though.
Yes.
Yeah.

2401
02:32:51.420 --> 02:32:56.040
It's gotta be like fucking 58 or something like that.
Yeah.
All that yogurt,

2402
02:32:56.240 --> 02:33:00.390
Goddamn fucking,
hey man,

2403
02:33:00.391 --> 02:33:05.370

2404
02:33:05.850 --> 02:33:10.130
Oh,

Oop.
Exactly.
Okay.
All about that bass about that,

2405
02:33:10.131 --> 02:33:13.980
you know that songs she got married at,
but one of my favorite tha the,

2406
02:33:14.160 --> 02:33:17.370
I became obsessed with them because there a photo of them leaving a sex store

2407
02:33:17.371 --> 02:33:19.200
with like a bag of dildos.
Yes.

2408
02:33:20.450 --> 02:33:23.940
And they got married last week and I've been stalking them on Instagram.

2409
02:33:23.941 --> 02:33:25.500
It's either we do that in Toronto.

2410
02:33:26.120 --> 02:33:30.210
We bought sex toys on the road in Toronto.
Is it Toronto?
[inaudible]

2411
02:33:30.420 --> 02:33:35.360
<v 0>hmm.
Did we bring them to the show?
I don't remember what,
what the fuck maybe.
Hmm.</v>

2412
02:33:37.210 --> 02:33:40.950
Anyway,
that was part again.
Yup.
Yup.
Um,
I want to thank,
um,

2413
02:33:41.070 --> 02:33:43.390

2414
02:33:43.840 --> 02:33:47.050

2415
02:33:49.780 --> 02:33:50.613

02:33:50.820 --> 02:33:54.090
<v 0>Donald's for all the money.
Well,</v>

2417
02:33:54.090 --> 02:33:56.970
<v 22>I told Christina,
but I recently had an antique store,</v>

2418
02:33:57.270 --> 02:34:01.680
found an old happy meal toy of a mic nugget,
which whoa.
And I have it.

2419
02:34:01.740 --> 02:34:04.770
That's fantastic.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2420
02:34:04.771 --> 02:34:08.100
I wonder if we'll have access now to like old library of toys and you know,

2421
02:34:08.101 --> 02:34:11.300
and stuff from our connection to them.
Yeah.
I hope PSI.

2422
02:34:11.650 --> 02:34:14.370
The hamburglar toy or something.
This is for my son.

2423
02:34:14.371 --> 02:34:18.250
We got this in the happy meal to truck.
Fantastic.
No,
we don't gender him

2424
02:34:18.690 --> 02:34:21.730
<v 0>Mcdonald's.
Yeah,
let's talk about that.
But yeah.
Yeah.</v>

2425
02:34:21.731 --> 02:34:24.700
They were like thought a boy's toy or whatever.
Or they said it was a boy's toy.

2426
02:34:24.701 --> 02:34:27.850
Right.
Base declared like it's a boy's toy and we're like,

2427
02:34:27.851 --> 02:34:30.580
we'll decide what's a boy's toy.
Um,
you know,

2428
02:34:30.581 --> 02:34:34.870
I'm not gonna let somebody tell me just because someone tells me it's my son.

2429
02:34:34.871 --> 02:34:37.900
That's my son.
You know what I mean?
Let him decide.
He's three.

2430
02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:41.950
He knows that by now.
He knows what gender he is.
Yeah.
I mean they fuck,

2431
02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:44.500
<v 22>there you go again,
Tom.
It's child abuse.</v>

2432
02:34:45.550 --> 02:34:48.520
You changed our younger son's diaper today.
Did you ask consent?

2433
02:34:48.730 --> 02:34:52.120
<v 0>No,
I just changed it.
That's something you're supposed to do.</v>

2434
02:34:52.150 --> 02:34:53.350
Did you do that when you were babysitting?

2435
02:34:54.070 --> 02:34:57.310
<v 22>No.
Oh,
did you guys watch the circumcision documentary?</v>

2436
02:34:58.050 --> 02:35:02.200
Why are you anti circumcision?
I just honestly,

2437
02:35:02.201 --> 02:35:04.270
I didn't have an opinion going into it.
Yeah.

2438
02:35:04.540 --> 02:35:08.740
But everyone on every side is a lunatic and they get crazier and crazier as the

2439
02:35:08.741 --> 02:35:13.000
movie goes on.
You kind of end up hating everybody.
Yeah.
But,
um,

2440
02:35:13.030 --> 02:35:15.580
I guess I'm,
I guess I don't get,
I don't care,

2441
02:35:16.090 --> 02:35:18.580
but I don't get why people are so into it.

2442
02:35:19.590 --> 02:35:24.570
<v 0>Yeah.
I mean the people who are really anti circumcision kind of,
I dunno,</v>

2443
02:35:24.660 --> 02:35:27.940
they kind of amused me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
When they're like,
how you

2444
02:35:28.030 --> 02:35:32.600
<v 22>dare you figure these bodies.
Yeah.
What,</v>

2445
02:35:32.610 --> 02:35:36.050
the people that are so into circumcision or even crazier.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I've,

2446
02:35:36.080 --> 02:35:38.140
I guess I've never heard of watch this documentary.

2447
02:35:38.141 --> 02:35:42.910
It's a lunatics after lunatics the whole way through.
Wows me out.

2448
02:35:43.160 --> 02:35:47.320
I'll check it out.
Sorry.

2451
02:35:54.260 --> 02:35:58.000

Yup.</v>

2452
02:35:58.060 --> 02:36:02.800

2453

Yeah,
I'm stuck.

2456
02:36:14.630 --> 02:36:15.970
But tickets are almost gone a lot.

2457
02:36:16.250 --> 02:36:17.580
<v 0>Those are almost gotten so by them.</v>

2458
02:36:17.610 --> 02:36:20.280
The last thing that I have tickets available for this month is,
