Speaker 2:          00:00:19       Christina,

Speaker 1:          00:00:30       did it have bat bit up, up skidded at sketch, sketch, sketch. I ended up, you know I was on the Graham last week and you texted it to him? I did and there was a woman on there to me now so I can just pull it. Let me find it is terrible. There's a woman who got some kind of an award, like a grammy nomination for scatting. Not throwing her shit in someone's face. Scott play is when you play it. That's a different game hoopoe but it was, it's probably the most annoying thing you've ever seen. I have to search through here. I don't know Tommy. It's really great how you don't have this ready already is just beyond me. You know? This is what the show's about babe. What do you like best about listening to somebody scan? I mean it's just like, I just feel it in me. [inaudible] up it up. I'd be, oh here she is. Here she is. You email it to me? Yeah. Hold on. Yeah. What a fucking it, it kind of feels to me like a racket, like come on. It's not really a talent. To me it feels like someone is really hard. I just emailed her insides hurts everything. Well, it's not real. It's not singing and it's not rapping. It's scatting, right? Yeah. So it's like here I,

Speaker 1:          00:01:47       she's like, I just feel it. I don't have to write it, but if I did set it, how has that a talent? If you don't have to write it and you don't have to really learn how to do it, we just did it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:01:59       Ski.

Speaker 1:          00:02:02       Well Bart, like it's, Oh God, there she is. She's got, and it's an NPR. Yeah. Grammy nominated jazz vocalists, Jazz. Mia Horn. Scatting is more than a technique. It's a means to honor her and ancestry and empower herself in the moment. Oh my God. Okay. I'm a greater stage is mine. You ready to, you ready to hear my favorite form of music that exists? Yeah. All right. Here we go.

Speaker 4:          00:02:31       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:02:33       Think about a horn player. I just become a horn player. That did do date. It's called a kid called scanning improvisation, but 10 times because they give out a whole body is the instrument. I mean for me it's important because my ancestors did it and they had a reason behind doing what they did. They didn't have horns.

Speaker 1:          00:03:01       The reason couldn't afford cool shit. Yeah, I know, boy. Oh come on now. It goes to like a fun Jesus. They will. It's on Instagram. I don't think about a horn player B. Did I just get scared and you got the grammy num cause I don't know if I could do that with a horn. I think if you gave me a horn and he told me to imitate the horn, I'll be like, I don't know how to do this. You have somebody give a try and go cause that's a talent is what I can go. I'm a horn.

Speaker 1:          00:03:42       My ancestors didn't have horns and a, even though I could go get one now I want to be like them. You know my ancestors didn't have either running water. Yeah, they didn't have electricity. Sanitation. We had to do stuff the old way roofs. None of it beds, but that's the old way, Yada, Yada. Preserve the cool stuff, right. It's the worst is when someone was like, but people used to do this and they didn't have what you have now. That's why he did that. She's like, yeah, I don't need the horn. I am the horn. No, you're not, but you're not the horn. You know, you're not. Honestly, I don't even like the way the horn plays just by itself. I don't like that shit either. I mean, I like jazz, but even when I hear a lot, I'm like, oh my God, my head's going to explode. One of my friends likes free flowing. Oh my God, Jess sessions.

Speaker 3:          00:04:37       Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:04:39       and especially when, I don't know how you wash that. You're like, man, he's one of those guys like, Oh yeah, I really loses himself in it, and I'm like, yeah, he lost me to mission accomplished now. Damn. Yeah. I mean, I know there's talent. There's clearly a lot of skill involved in that stuff, but for me it just gives me anxiety listening to it. Yeah, that's pretty bad. Good night through a proper show. Open. What are we doing here? Let me, hold on. Let me do the horns for it. Yeah, you want to do the, Oh, you went to your mom's house horns. Why don't you to all the instruments. Welcome. How's really good. Thank you Jesus. My ancestors taught me. Yeah. Here we go. Here. Here you go. Up Top. We explain to me why I could eat for it. If you eat, eat 10 mother fucking peaks up consuming as much as the speaks of pork. Oh, is Randy

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       [inaudible]. Well, welcome. We'll go to your mom's house for us, Christina pledges. It's interesting.

Speaker 5:          00:06:49       Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:06:50       It's like we're instruments not playing the horn. I am the horn. I was the guitar right there. Bam, Bam, Bam. And the thing is my, uh, to my ancestors, they couldn't play guitar and neither. Kat, I'm just carrying on the great tradition of having no musical talent in my bloodline. Yeah. Ba, Ba, ba boom, ba boom. Wow. Yeah. Good stuff. Truly is. It truly is one music for him. I don't, I just don't get, yeah, I don't get it either. God, you can listen to that shit. Like, I don't get it. A lot of stuff to talk about gene. Yeah. So the Christians or are some of them are against putting their mounts on penises, right? Yeah. Cause jeans and stuff. Yeah. The, a lot of them I think if you're like, what is it is evangelical and like old school baptist, they really read the Bible literally and then they, yeah, no, it really will change your opinion on, I think religion being a grownup piano growing up being adult, any photo from space.

Speaker 1:          00:07:58       Right. You know, when you look at a photo, I was looking at a photo from space. Yeah. That was taken by some satellite from Saturn towards earth. And you just see a dot and there's an arrow. It's like this is earth kind of makes you go like, it'd be like if someone said, and then the people on that star think that a magic man comes down. You know what I mean? Yeah. It makes you go like what they read the Bible. It's a book said to not eat pigs. It's, and it's absurd to think that of all the galaxies and all the solar systems and yeah, we only know of this planet having of life that like we're somehow special only made up of mythical story. Yeah. And some, someone, a man in the sky is keeping track of all of this. What'd you do that in there? Did you eat a bite of you suck somebody's Dick. Did you do you jack off? No big trouble. Yeah. Okay. You fuck your mom? Did you eat fish on Friday? All that stuff is just nonsense. It, yeah. I don't think God even has time. Let's say that there is a god, he hasn't had time to keep track of all that. A lot going on. There's so much more happening.

Speaker 6:          00:09:05       Especially things like if you do something, let's say self indulgent, it's kind of selfish and greedy. Maybe it's something mundane like eating big. Um, but then there's also fires and my slot genocide. He was like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. You have sausage.

Speaker 1:          00:09:28       Put that back down. Right? Well God doesn't even care about the biggies. Like all this stuff you've just named the fires. And the eye doesn't stop them. How costs Nazis. He's always like, I hope you guys learn freewill. Yeah. Better stop being bad. That's where this happened. I'm going to send that hurricane and all those queers. Killary buddy. Yeah. Stop being gay. I hate it. That's one of my main things up here and I hate gays. I think about it all the time. I made you, I made the possibility that you gave but I can't stand it. God's a big homophobe.

Speaker 6:          00:10:08       Yeah, he really, really is like, ah, stop it. Yeah. That's really cool. So, so ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:10:18       It's just like the gays I know. Got, it's just like the gate. Just let this guy, that is God's thing. Right? Here's God right here. I have a quote from God. I have come all over my face. What? She sent me an MP three. He sent you that? Yeah. Um, so yeah, this lady here has like some pretty strong views. Yeah, there you go. It's interesting how, I mean you're taught these rules kind of early. If you're a grownup and religion and then there is a turning point where you go like, wait a minute, wait a minute, why can't I do that? Why can't I eat pork or why can't I have, cause the guy said, why is this even like

Speaker 6:          00:11:12       all the stories make no sense. No sense. And also the idea that there's a book in even in his historical context, human history, it's like a hundred thousand years old, but we're going to like, but 2000 years ago they're like, that's when the guy was here. It's the right one. And that's when the book was written. And then people are like, that's the book. We all should live our lives based on a book that's 2000 years old. He didn't know that. Yeah. Okay. Well, and also there's two then all the people before him, were they doing things incorrectly or Doug didn't know here yet? Well, uh, for it when I was going to say,

Speaker 1:          00:11:55       yeah, I, yeah, it's, it's all fucking so stupid. Here's what I think. This is what God is doing all day long. Every day. Rob, Rob, rob, just jerking off, watching TV. I think we're TV. You think every time he comes it's, and that's rain. That's a really good, really good. No, because these guys, so his comes gotta be, that's the hurricanes. Oh, it's right. Hurricanes. Tornadoes. See, that makes a lot more sense. It's God come when, when there's a hurricane. Yeah. Or blizzard or something. We should run this by my mom thinks she would dig it. Yeah. It's interesting too, what people have a couple of religious jokes in my act, right? Yeah. Yeah, man, it's so funny. Most of the time it goes pretty well. Yeah. But there's been times when it's gone sideways and it is amazing to me how seriously people take that still.

Speaker 1:          00:12:46       Yeah. But like I, I do feel like it has something to do with being really, you're really inundated with it as a child. Yeah. And you kind of have to under your childish beliefs. Yeah. As an adult. And a lot of people don't. And you're like, wait, that wasn't, or the idea that our Bible is the right one is kind of crazy. I tell you about the conversation I had with a woman on the plane. No, I only talked, I don't have those conversations anymore on a plane. Um, so I was sitting there and I dunno, it was pretty mundane stuff. And then I saw a peak

Speaker 6:          00:13:17       at the cover and it was something about Peter the Apostle. So I'll go, I said something like, good book. And she was like, it's really good actually. He's really good. And I said, oh, okay. And then said, so are you, I mean, are you just like studying for educational purposes or like, in other words, is this, you know, you learning something or is this like, you're just free to join us? She's like, no, this one, you know, I mean it's, I'm learning, but it's what I, you know, I was, I was looking forward to reading this and I was like, oh. And then we started talking about that a little bit and I kinda, you know, I didn't say anything provocative to her, but then I was like, Hey, do you ever, she said something about, Oh yeah. She was like, yeah, you know, it's like when people, she was like, do you have you accepted Christ as your savior?

Speaker 6:          00:14:01       And I was like, sure. I go, I just had like, I was raised, that's what I always say when someone is how I was raised in a Catholic house. In other words, I'm trying to tell them, you don't worry about me, like don't try to sell me. Yeah. But I'm also not trying to further, the guy goes, raised Catholic. She was like, oh, that's good. And, or whatever. She said, but then she was like, yeah, you know, and it's kind of my mission to like, you know, I try to save people before and I go, well, what do you think happens? I go, if they don't, she goes, then they go to hell. And I go, so you, do you really think that people go to hell if they don't accept Christ? And she goes, yeah. I said, what about um, cause there's a lot of people, billions of people that are another religion. Like back to what you were saying. Okay, sure. And you know Jews

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       dude, I go, do you think they go to hell? And she goes, it was a really hard conclusion for me to come to. But yeah, so all Muslims go to hell. She was like, yeah, and I go and all Jews. She was like, Yup. And I go, all right, I go have, have a great trip. Hope you have a blessed, blessed. But isn't that crazy that this human is walking the world with us? Well, and especially because if you, I mean Jesus has messages of love and acceptance and he accepted the prostitutes and he accepted all the people that, you know, we're a marginalized in society. But except for those, you know, Jews and then those loans, I mean I get it. If it religion gives you comfort, I think you should have your comfort for sure. Then your messages, everyone's going to hell was kind of a crew.

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       Hey, contradictory. Yeah. This lady is also a little crazy in your fucking mouth and it all falls under the same umbrella. Yeah. She said she added a syllable to umbrella umbrella umber. She did it at the Rihanna Barella oh man. Fuck you up. Let's be in a religion though. It's funny cause I flew home yesterday from Portland and was that our audiences are by far the panning out that these are being recorded at a different pace because of the fucking movie schedules. Excuse me. Because of the Goddamn fucking movie schedule. You're a movie star now. You should have no more regal of it. A vocabulary. I'm just letting our listeners know. I mean I'm thrilled to do the movie and I always love doing this show. I'm just saying that's why you're maybe starting out. You think you should really clean up, clean up my act of the waste to act the everything.

Speaker 1:          00:16:56       So I came back from Portland, which was amazed. The audiences were amazed. You guys are fantastic for coming out. I really do appreciate Portland [inaudible] have the best fucking crowds are just amazing and they're so, they're so down to have fun. I had, you know, it was great. So I know Portland and Portland and I came home and we were texting and you go, is it weird that I don't give a shit about Easter? Don't give a motherfucking shit about Easter Sunday as I'm flying home on Easter Sunday and I will go, neither do I could give fucking zero fucks. But I honestly think it's two fold for me. Why I don't like Easter one. Uh, because of the stations of the cross. Because in Catholic school it was like they didn't focus on the Easter bunny or on the fund or the chocolate Catholic school is like, and then the suffering Christ for people that listen or watch the show, we all have different backgrounds, but the kids that grew up in Catholic homes know that, you know, Catholics, if you had real Catholic parents said a real, a nice way of ruining child's like fun.

Speaker 1:          00:18:00       Yeah. It should just be Easter baskets and Shire, they were ruined Christmas with Christ's suffering and you know, you're like presence there. Like it's not about presence. And you're like, all right. And then you're like, everyone else was talking about presence. Yeah, well they're stupid and they're going to hell. And then Easter. Yeah. Easter's like bunny. And they're like, well the real part about Easter as God rose after he was murdered. Oh four. So yeah, but they really dragged it out. When I went to an all girls Catholic school, you realize that's why we fucking go like God, Jesus ruined before you go. And we had to walk. I remember our campus was beautiful and they had, they actually did the real stations of the cross and we had to walk around with a non, you know, sister Ann or whoever. And then she's like, and this is when Jesus fell again and Jesus falls like a hundred times over and over. And they beat him and whipped them and people point and laugh and he had a crown of thorns in his marriage. I remember being a kid and then showing us that on an Easter too. What I mean, like not in school. I mean, being a young kid, you know, maybe five or six and you're like, have your basket where you're Chucky treats. And then they're like, there's an image of, and you're like, what happened? Jesus, he's, he rose from the dead today while you're eating your fucking chocolate.

Speaker 1:          00:19:30       And then I remember I had this teacher who had to teach us exactly how the nails got put in. Did you know that? They did not. By the way, it's inaccurate historically that they put the nails through Jesus, his palms through the risks. Right. Because that would slide off the cross. If you nailed somebody, palms, it would just tear through it and the person would fall. So they crucified you by nailing it through your wrists. But it was cool for them to discover that I bet back in the room. Yeah. They were like, Oh, you know the nail, the weight of his body just slid through his hands when he fell, he still died, but kind of fucked up the decoration we were going for it. So what we've done is innovated this whole thing. We nail through the risks and then we nail through both feet and they bleed out.

Speaker 1:          00:20:16       That way works well. Yeah. Okay. So that's one reason I hate Easter. The second reason has to do is my dad, I had this childhood memory, it was right around the age where I was kind of starting to figure out that Santa wasn't real. And I think once that domino falls, all the others do like the Easter bunny and the tooth fairy and Santa hadn't fallen just yet, but I was starting to catch on and I remember my dad, I was staying with him at the time and um, it was the night before Easter and I were going to sleep and I was like, so dad, the Easter bunny is going to come right like these. I kept asking him, the Easter bunny is going to come right. And he was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. It's going to come like it. Co of course ignoring me. And of course I woke up Easter morning and there was nothing like, my dad didn't even buy me like a chocolate, like nothing in the house. And I remember just being like, wait, there's no Easter bunny. It's like, oh yeah, no, there's no Easter bunny like he, that's how he told me. I don't remember. It must have been like around the age where you start to realize, so let's seven or something seminary. And then I remember going to my mom's house and just crying cause like it was like

Speaker 7:          00:21:31       there's no,

Speaker 1:          00:21:35       and she's like fuck. She's like, yeah. And I remember she took me to the store and I bought an etch a sketch and that was like my Easter present for the day. But like he really fucked up the biggies for me cause he was just lazy. He was like, Nah, I don't want to buy nothing for you. So that sounds cool parenting, right? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:55       But we don't say, here's the thing is that we don't fuck up our kids good time. I keep trying. I just pull that back. As much as I don't give a fuck about Easter, I made sure that our child enjoyed Easter. Yesterday we did an Easter egg hunt for LJ and he got, you know, we didn't do the Jesus stuff to him. Yeah. She got to do it for your kids, man. You got to do it for your kids. So we don't give a shit. I no, no, no. That's the whole thing. That's what being a parent is a good parent. I'm just saying that that's what being yes, that yesterday and hiding eggs, that's us being good, but my dad was so selfish, like, why wouldn't you just be like, and I remember him blowing me off like, yeah, yeah, sure, sure. It's going to be here tomorrow.

Speaker 1:          00:22:40       Yeah. Yeah. Like it was so dismissive and shitty. Like you couldn't have gotten, I know you went to the liquor store. I know you went down to the seven 11 you could gotten me like a fucking chocolate bunny with your six or a Heineken. I mean that's just fucking lazy. I'm sorry. No, I'm fine. I'm just saying it's really lazy parenting. Yeah, no, I hear you. I hear you. Yeah. Could have gotten down to the fucking rite aid or whatever. Cvs. I definitely think most men would fall short if they were, that's true. That's true. You guys have no, but that's not, not this generation. I mean all this generation is different though. It is a different, it's a different world. We're also, this generation is much more emotionally aware, you know? I'll be, your dad will probably just like, oh, here's your, I don't know Steg Buddy.

Speaker 1:          00:23:30       Here's your Easter steak. Yeah, yeah. Like steak. And then he'd be like, all right. Uh, I owe her some chocolates too, but I don't know where they are. Okay. And that would be your eastern, probably the women kind of ran the show when it, right. But if your kid says pacifically, Hey dad, Easter Buddy's coming tomorrow. You know what that means? Yeah. Yeah. A cute little girl asking you for shit. I mean, come on. Jesus Christ. Oh, fucking leave. If she has specifically, I'm sure you would try. It was like I was reminding him. Yeah. So fucking lazy. He's unbelievable. She's Christ. Uh, but you're right, the women tend to keep up the traditions they do. Yeah. I know. It sounds like I'm being a antiquated with this stuff, but it's true. Well, yeah, I, I'm the mom, so I make sure Christmas looks nice. The House looks nice, never do a decoration.

Speaker 1:          00:24:28       I'll tell you that. If it was just me, not a single thing, you would never know what time of year it was. If you were just dropped into this home, you'd be like, I dunno. Is it March? Is it June? Is it November? You had no, no idea. Yeah, no, but I liked that you do it of course, because I know it makes everybody, it brings joy. Just like at Halloween, I decorate the house. I like to have that stuff. Maybe because my parents were so great at it, you know, I'm just carrying on their tradition on this circle of fun, just like my ancestors did.

Speaker 7:          00:24:57       Yesterday's court blood pressure come fuck you up on it in a long run. Fuck you up in alone. Drawn from the inside. That's why we got aids and all this other bullshit around. Okay, so the term eating, eating vagina, uh, it, it, it's, it's, you're more so licky you're not really eating it. You consume and the shit that comes from, you know, either I'll be okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:32       I love her. I wish that was my grandmother. She didn't have a lot of fun in her youth and her grandmother didn't talk like that at all. But I wish, I wish you did.

Speaker 7:          00:25:43       He's why we got eight

Speaker 1:          00:25:44       Carl from oral. Yeah. And vaginas and stuff. Yeah. I love it. I think it was bud fucking actually ma'am, but fucking there's the medical term when you, but fuck, you can get eight. Yeah, that's what they say. So the doctor says that fucking disease. Yeah. I don't think it's a dick suck disease. So not down with that pork. No. Pork is really a big, the Muslims don't eat the pork, right? Yeah, no. Yeah. By the way, did you see this? You've seen this filthy animal. They're all filthy animals. Cows are filthy too. They're all, they all step in their own ship to change your filthy animals. Um, this guy, what is his name? Jamie. Jamie Lee. Parker is a tattoo artist. And I know what you're going to bring up and I can't believe how good it is. So I have a, I have a joke in my latest special about, which is true about sometimes throughout

Speaker 6:          00:26:44       my life and including recently, people will be like, oh, Segura is that Japanese? And I have a, so there's a bit about it in the special home and do the whole thing. But, so anyways, I guess, you know, people have been commenting and messaging me a lot about it and you know, they right there. Are you Japanese like as a joke? Oh yeah. When people who think it's Japanese relaxing uha sounds Japanese. I'm like, alright man. Anyways, that's the joke. He did a tattoo on someone, craziness of me as like a Samurai. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:27:20       it's so good. I mean I will say detail is like, he really got your face, your nose, your beard, and you're like the guys really, whoever this is is an amazing beard. Colors, right? Yeah. Like down to the the whisker. Yeah. Like where, like this white hair right here. Yeah. I know what you're talking about. Yeah. And he did a 14 hours. Damn. It's a real fan right there.

Speaker 6:          00:27:45       This is so amazing. Especially in contrast to that Instagram page. I think it's called sucky tattoos or suck my tattoos. That shit is so fucking hilarious. Cause it's, it's basically tattoos that were done in 14 seconds. Yeah. It's sucky tattoos. Hmm. And then the tagline is stopped getting shitty tattoos. [inaudible] says it's, it's so unbelievable. I'm going to try to pull it up right now and show it to you, um, that people would, especially when you see how bad these are, um, it's like, why would you, this isn't like you paid, you bought a painting and your pride, you're, uh, you know, you're like, I'm going to hang this up. This is on your body. You know, this is on your body forever and so hard to commit to something. Oh my God. I mean, that guy says, it just says keep it real stupid. Ooh, I dunno what that's supposed to be. That's misspelled. Believed in myself. P. E. L. I. V. E. N. O. Shit. That's bad. That says be live in, and this is what about believing in English? Yeah, I mean, as shit like this, it's funny. Eyes on your ass cheeks. The ones that are really crazy or just like the really poorly sketched. Well, you know where the the line work here, you know like the outer edge is and then look, they misspelled California and then rode over it. California dreaming and I mean look at the font. It's like somebody free hand. You let them,

Speaker 1:          00:29:30       does it make any sense? You know, no prison tattoos. I don't think that's fair cause it's like that dude's in prison. Oh you think something's wrong with this guy though? Or you think something's wrong with him? No teeth in the mouth, but no, but I mean like you can't, you can't really rank a prison tattoo. It's like, all right. Ah Man,

Speaker 6:          00:29:52       I don't know. Just this they misspelled too. You know there's, there's two o's too weird to live. Too Rare. Yeah. Yeah. I thought

Speaker 1:          00:30:02       they do a stencil first so you can proof read

Speaker 6:          00:30:05       like nobody, nobody proof writers. No regrets a lot, bro. Yeah. Anyways, what a great contrast. Right? When you see this work, you know that somebody paid someone for that and then you have fucking

Speaker 1:          00:30:26       sky that's amaze through this. I think it's crazy. Jamie Lee Parker. Oh, Jamie Hart. Yeah. Where do you know where this person is? No, no. I just see it in this email here, but pretty amazing. It's incredible. Yeah. Jesus even got your silly, I work, I keep forgetting because I look at it, I see a painting. Thank you. Keep forgetting to this is on someone's body. That's another thing you have to take into consideration is like that. That's on an angle. Like yeah, it's a round surface. Simon. A flat. It's like an arm. But even right now I keep, I keep forgetting as a

Speaker 6:          00:30:55       looking at it cause I'm looking at the artwork and then I have to remind myself somebody is walking around with that.

Speaker 1:          00:31:01       No, I know. What if you offend him on your next special, I don't know. You're like hates me. Yeah. And he's like fuck fucking eight times bigger. And now I was like, what's he look like? And he's like, well actually I have a photo like tattoo of him on my body. Gmo Farms. Is that on his leg? You think

Speaker 6:          00:31:16       arm? Uh, I dunno. I can't tell. It's around. I think that's a leg.

Speaker 1:          00:31:21       Oh, you're right. I think you're right. Yeah. So like not only does he have to get you in your life, your likeliness, perfect. Your likeness, sorry. But he has to do it on an angle. So like how does he even, how do they fucking learn? How do you learn to Tattoo? That's the real thing. That means you got to give a lot of bad tattoos I'm assuming, right?

Speaker 6:          00:31:38       I'm assuming. Yeah. But hopefully most of them are just, you know, not tattooed on someone. Maybe you learned all your bad stuff on paper.

Speaker 1:          00:31:48       You learnt. Yeah. But then, but then you can practice it. Yeah. Do it on skin, man. And I'm going to town

Speaker 6:          00:31:55       right now. So I do this regularly. Well, because I freak out. I personally have my own anxiety about beard length and hair length and I, you know, when it gets to a certain point you kind of go like, I got to get my hair cut today. I gotta get my,

Speaker 1:          00:32:07       yeah. Yeah. I get the same way. I feel like I look horrible. You got to do it just ugly. You get your head like

Speaker 6:          00:32:13       this over a week. But I can't touch it myself because I go to shoot more of the White House to look the same as it did last time, so I have to go tomorrow and let them do the cut and make sure it matches the earlier stuff. Anyways, it's making me absolutely crazy. Shout out to Plymouth, Minnesota is suburb of Minneapolis and wearing my twin cities hat today and shout out to Zachary Lane. Elementary school where I went for one year. Okay. You think a lot of those people

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       are listening? There's definitely someone right now who's like no fucking way. I went to Zachary Lane. Yeah, I went there for fourth grade and then we went to the Catholic school. I forget the name of fifth grade and sixth grade raised. Yeah. It's cool. Your parents moved you around every year and then we moved again for seventh grade. I went to lake shore, Middle School in medicine. It's really bad. Did your kids your beard? I don't. I don't feel like it's that full right now.

Speaker 6:          00:33:05       I know how full it is compared to how I've been wearing it.

Speaker 1:          00:33:10       Do you, so do you smell the smells more like it cause I know, I know that your beard's traps more smells a little more. It is a little more trappy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I will say when your diet was way worser. Yeah. When you were eating like pizza and stuff, your beard would smell a lot like like cheese and stuff more. Thank you. Then. Yeah. It doesn't smell bad now, but I can tell what you've, what you've been doing like memory, you came home last time and I sniffed your beard and I was like, did you smoke cigars? Yeah. Yeah. I can smell that. Smoked cigars the day before. Right. But it's, it's still in your beard and in your skin and you hadn't showered. Right. I'm assuming. I think I had showered. That's what I was amazing. Yeah. I can smell it all in your beard. Yeah. Pretty interesting. Let you go on your hikes. Who knows what happens there? Hiking lately, smelling that beard

Speaker 6:          00:34:04       meeting guys. A lot of Nice guys having a muscle spasm in the same spot for a couple of days. It's now where spot is it right here. It's moving right now

Speaker 1:          00:34:13       on there. You see it? No, don't you feel it right now? I wonder why they're right here. I Dunno. It's interesting. Um, well we're, we're going to talk about, I wanted to bring up that Netflix show you and I got into, uh, that beach body show. Oh, with people go to Thailand. Beauty and the beauty and the beach or something. Yeah. Yeah. Thailand for cosmetic surgery. It's people from New Zealand and Australia who, who can't afford to have it, I guess done there. And then they go to Thailand for discount, major plastic surgery. And I'm talking like removing penises, creating vaginas. Face Work Major. Oh yeah. Major shifts.

Speaker 6:          00:34:54       Chin implants. I had no idea how much, even the discussion of removing one's penis and testicles. I would feel so, and I, and I, this is not to belittle or demean or humiliate entity does it? Uh, I think you know, by all means, do what? Whatever you want to do to be happy. I think it's great if that's what you want to do. I'm saying that when the person was consultating with the doctor, I could feel my testes jump, I could feel my asshole go like yeah. And he's like, yeah, and then we'll remove the penis. I was like, ha ha. Yeah. And then we'll invert everything and you a vagina. I was like,

Speaker 1:          00:35:39       I couldn't, I was, I was having this visceral reaction to it that I, I didn't expect at all. It was tough. I know you couldn't watch the whole segment. I couldn't watch that segment. You miss it. Cause they show the Dong in her hand at one point. She's like, yeah, y'all painted. We caught it all. And he's like, what? Uh, what did you just say? I'm joining the Thai accent, ma'am. I can do it now. My mom is my new moms, Vietnamese, so I can make fun of rob. Rob. Yeah, rob. It's fine. Yeah. And his tie, his tie. Oh He's, yeah. So he's your rub rub. Dr Rob. All right. It's, it's fascinating. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:36:16       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:36:17       I guess there's this port, there's four women in Australia who her uterus is coming out of her vagina cause she had five babies and she has like public health care and they told her she had to wait nine years to get the procedure. So she's kind of a fuck that

Speaker 8:          00:36:31       sizable wait nine years.

Speaker 1:          00:36:34       Jesus Christ. Yeah. I mean tell someone that their genitals or is it public health care? That's what she is on. I don't know. I'm not familiar enough with their,

Speaker 8:          00:36:43       the big things about public health care in different parts of the world is they will pay for it but they sometimes they're like you got to come back in years.

Speaker 1:          00:36:50       Gosh, I mean and in that case I understand going to Thailand, it's closer for obviously for Australians. Yeah. You get it done and it's a nice enough place. It's, it's fancy. Yeah. And there anyway, there's this one lady cause you, they don't show you, first of all, they don't show you a year later, which is really when you want to see what plastic surgery looks like was the very true when the face is relaxed and you see how the muscles have kind of come together and the work that they've done. So you only see like two, three weeks postop and they're all also geeked to have the work done and they're so excited and they're all shiny. And there's this one lady who had a facelift done.

Speaker 8:          00:37:29       Well you tell it. I like you telling it. She had, she had a facelift on whatever. She's all black and blue, which is normal. And then eyelids all stitched up. Yeah. Faces all crazy. And then she's looking in the mirror. She was like, I look great. And then about 10 days later, swelling has reduced. Oh my God. So brutal. Watch it. I keep thinking about it. I wish I was a logger, meaning a transcriber on home, uh, extreme makeover. It was the name of the show. Extreme loved that show. That was the network version. They would air this show on ABC I think. And they would basically take people, busted ass people and give them a total makeovers. I mean plastic surgery, new teeth, hair, great new wardrobes, everything. And then you know, they would have a big reveal. People would be like, what the dog,

Speaker 1:          00:38:21       they should just have a teeth make show because that alone, I remember what just transform people to were huge. The teeth were done by a dentist out here. Oh yeah, I remember that doctor. Yeah, doctor fuck nuts. Wash bag, big Douche bag. And He um, he let us get like free widenings and we went there and then his uh, assistance or like, do you have that? That's where they told me they were like, you have like 20 habits happened to me by the way. Later I happened to me. Same thing. We know, I told that story for a long time when I had insurance, dental insurance and this one job and they're like, you have like 13 cavities, 13th actually the number, that number. And then I was like, fuck you. And I went to my Hungarian dentist and he's like, you have like one cavity, this is a lie, but this story, whatever. I'm so I'm glad it's documented because people have called you out on it. I asked my friend Eric, I was, he was there when it happened. Okay. We worked together. So anyway, go ahead. When you worked at America's most wanted so that I know I know that much. So this lady has like the 10 day she's 10 days removed from, from her intensive plastic surgery where they're, and slides under her fucking face pulling her drain.

Speaker 1:          00:39:39       Anyways, she's like, I'm going to go see the doctor today. And when she says she's going to go see the doctor, her left eyebrow, she's like, I'm going to go see a doctor. I have someone want to talk to them about it. And you're like, I think she's going to talk about that eyebrow as she goes in there and she's like, um, there's one thing I wanted to ask you about. I remember you mentioning it and I didn't realize it was an issue until people kept re-explaining things for me. Like, I didn't understand, is this a left eyebrow, I'm going to come down or is it gonna stay cock like I'm in a permanent state of Huh. And he's like, Hey, we'll come now she had a case of Tom Cigarettes cause he got that eyebrow. That's your eyebrows. She had a case in the meanies. Yeah, I mean that Shit looked just one. And I remember dude right before she went into the dark, I was like, it's her fucking eyebrow higher dude. I was like, look, that eyebrow, it was slowly creeping up. Creeping up. Yeah. And then with him it looks really bad. It looks horrible and he's like, it's very normal. It will come down under. And I was like, no way, no fucking way. The muscle him need full body massage. Open your mouth.

Speaker 1:          00:40:56       Let me pull up my, my taste. They do not. Those doctors are very good. No, those two, those doctors pioneered, um, that whole, you know, cutting the weaning off surgery. That's what it's called. Yeah. Dick up inside you, they created that stuff. That's why they have so many good lady boys there. It's, they, they innovated that. And thinking about it now, it's like, uh, I dunno. It's just that like they in Edinburg. Yeah. And so that becomes your canal somehow. You stay with good sensitivity to, well, here's how, here's how they did it. So they took his scrotal skin actually, and then they show the nurse plucking the hairs off of the scrotal skin and making it soft, like kind of scraping it. And then that's the skin that they used for the internal part of the vagina is when I'm understanding. And then the, yeah. And they use the tip of the penis to make the cliteracy. Ah, yeah. And then the penis skin, I think is the outer, the Lavia. Isn't that amazing? It's amazing. And I wish they would have shown more detail. No, I have so many questions. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You want to have that done while they explain it to you. They're like,

Speaker 9:          00:42:21       bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, Bro.

Speaker 1:          00:42:37       Oh my God. So moving along, topic wise. Yeah. You and I went into a bar. Stocks. Uh, we go, we dropped what we were taking fifth to the vet I think. Yeah. And we were on our way back and I had to go pee in the Starbucks and when I went to go pee there was a woman next to me who came in hurriedly hurt hurriedly. Is that the word? Hurried hurry. In a hurried manner. And she dropped trout and she had a full diarrhea.

Speaker 9:          00:43:03       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:43:08       Yeah. I have to say in girl world, that is very rare. It's extremely rare. It's as rare as hearing a double pipe. Classic cars. Generally women don't drop massive brown load in a public restroom. Really? No. So what happens? Like, can you hear a little bit? Oh my God, I heard everything. No, no. Normally, oh, ps you hear p number one only smell too though. Sometimes some nasty bitch you'll hear like and like, like a two will slip out like, and then you'll know like, oh she's, she's shitting but you don't sell them. Do you hear like the full, like all of it nice world that you live in because let me tell you something about the men's room. Yeah. In a lot. In most place, especially a busy men's room, like I'm saying multiple stalls. It is a symphony of sounds and it smells like death. I mean, you go to lax. Yeah. Well that's, yeah. Any major airport like those, those bathroom stalls are wrecked. I mean it stinks to high heaven. Well, at the airport, you know you've got international dumps, international time zones dumps, and you see the, the fucking travel nurses of humanity walking through there. Yeah. Garbage, garbage people. Yeah. No it is. This is like what it's like, uh, in the men's room it's like,

Speaker 1:          00:44:50       but why do you guys have no shame and why do women have the shame?

Speaker 8:          00:44:53       Dude do, I mean, I had time in my life where I was a little more like, Ooh, but like, I dunno, I think guys are just

Speaker 1:          00:44:58       like, I got a shit. What do you want me to do? Help me. Sensei. Yeah. How do I, I mean I don't, I usually just shit with reckless abandon if I have to shit, I shit, I don't fucking care. Yeah. For the other gals listening, how do we get them? How do we get over the hump of, cause I feel like I would like that this woman was just going for it. I mean it was Starbucks. Yeah. They basically serve you bal torture and then some of them don't have bathrooms. We just heard an eruption though. I heard diarrhea. Yeah. Very rare. Very rare in the women's bathroom. You just got to realize, yeah,

Speaker 8:          00:45:33       doesn't matter. Doesn't, who cares? You got it. When you got to go, you should just let it out. Let the vowel

Speaker 1:          00:45:37       and the farts. I think it's the fart. So women don't want people to hear the farts. I hear the sounds right. It's embarrassing. It's not lazy like there's, and there's no one that you can't see the person. That's what I always feel to it was up around you. It's anonymous and you can wait for that other person. That's what I've done.

Speaker 8:          00:45:52       Ones where I'm like, Ooh, like, and you know the person that I've, I've heard people go like, Jesus, I've heard that before. So if that happens and you're feeling a little timid, you know, but I've also walked out and have people just look right at me and you go like, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:46:08       have you ever had someone after you violent shit in public? And then they're like, hey, you're Tom secure. I know you're a comedian. I've had them

Speaker 8:          00:46:14       say, I've had them say like, Hey, yeah, I'm while I'm at a urinal and I've also had it while I'm washing my hands. Like, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:46:22       but not like after you just had that like age or dad.

Speaker 8:          00:46:25       I walked out of the stall, but I've had it, you know, washing my hands 30 seconds later. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:46:29       They know that you just shit. That's what I'm saying. I don't know.

Speaker 8:          00:46:32       I don't know if they know I just shit, no, I don't think so.

Speaker 1:          00:46:35       Cause I, that would bother me if I took a shit. And then they're like, oh hey, I don't like when they try to shake my hands in the bathroom. That's nasty as fuck. I've had a guy try to shake my hands on at the urinal. Yeah. Holding your winger. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:46:46       And I'm like, well, I'm a little busy right now. He's like, Oh yeah, yeah. I was going to come see your show, but I didn't. I'm like, thank you. That's always the fun I was going to see ya. But I chose not to. Thank you. All right. Yeah. Um, so you remember I was a few weeks ago. I wonder if I have it, uh, in here, there was a guy and he had a proposal, I think.

Speaker 8:          00:47:50       really shitty whole. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but essentially he's like, Hey, I'll give you $1,000 I have dinner at a nice restaurant, but I want to have a family with you. I Dunno. Anyways, he has another video out.

Uh, speaking of mental illness, how about this person? The video seems like it staggers a little bit. I don't know what that's all about, but check out this lady. Here I am a sole fork. What that means is from nonphysical energy. So most people in the planet, there are nonphysical energy that is projected forth into a physical human body. I am nonphysical energy. This perfect projected fourth and two and arturian body. An extra terrestrial body. Hmm. It's a mom last night I like to hear more. Okay. Lucky for you. An extra terrestrial. Damian has chosen to then project forth as a human body 12 times. This is the 12th incarnation. It's quite funny and ironically, because before I even came down, there was an entire control of beings, arturian beings, six dimensional beings who even chose the way I would look in this life. I just, I'm also kind of fascinated where you acquire the vocabulary to speak like arturians this before. Actually, it's not just one word I'm saying. You know, she, she's able to speak freely with some command of basically language. Most people don't. It's a glossary of nonsense. That's a great title for your next album.

Speaker 1:          00:54:53       I love it. Yeah. Yeah. It's like how does she come? How did they, I guess all these Weirdos that buy in to this shit or she's read some weird, she read some bullshit book about, you know, the, the Seti, whatever messages of extra terrestrials the, now there's a whole subculture want to go full circle on this episode. It's basically no different than the Bible. Just a bunch of nonsense. Did what now? What are you talking about? The same. It's the same thing. Kinda. Would you like to know what, so I came down here with the intention of reaching people in every single continent. They like to pay attention to what's attractive, right? But based on where you are geographically, certain things are attractive and certain things are unattractive. So a really beautiful woman down in Africa. Mike, come up here to us and be considered pretty ugly down there. Why is it we up? We see in the continent of Africa, not all down there.

Speaker 1:          00:55:54       Well, the earth is flat. It's not like my looks are so gorgeous to one demographic over. Another demographic is that there will not be a person on the planet regardless of what country you go to that does not perceive some level of attractiveness. Gus, they'll pay attention. She basically just said, I'm attractive to any to everyone on earth. Oh, oh, okay. I, I like, I didn't want to devote the mental energy to figuring out what horseshit she's talking about. She said that she like I out halfway through it I was like, I don't, I have, he said, I'm attractive to iron on earth. To some degree. That is what this person just said about themselves. Cool. I'm attracted to everyone. 18 to 26 we could set her up with $1,000 state guy. They seem like a couple of delusional. At the very least, people we've heard of make $1,000. Hey, that's money in my pocket. She might not be under 26 now. She's too old for him. How will you think she is? 32 oh yeah, she's way too fucking old. One foot in the grave, a soul fork.

Speaker 1:          00:56:59       This is the 12th incarnation. Oh Wow. Yeah. Those are drugs. Right? Or maybe she's just sick, you know? And I also think there's just people that are so wounded and they, they really just need something to believe in. And like aliens and incarnations and spiritual forks and all like, you know, I am a spiritual fork. Okay. Okay. Hey Man, it's your world. You got it. Yeah, go for it. I can bullshit. Speaking a spiritual forks. I was in, um, the airport and I saw a woman wearing a house slippers, like fuzzy house slippers. And it's actually not the first time I've seen that. It's, I've been seeing a trend of young girls wearing like house slippers out. It's kind of a thing now. Yeah, I've seen that a lot more. Right. It's not the open tonus cause somebody commented like, Oh do you hate feet is Otr as like now it's not the feet.

Speaker 1:          00:57:57       It's that these shoes are not meant to be worn out in the streets. They're covered. They have an open back, you know. So sorry. Which one? Slippers. Just having an open back. That's what these were. These were like fuzzy slippers, like you know, old school, 1960s fuzzy slippers. So they were, there was no heel. It was just like a Shitty, it's a trend. It's a shitty flip flop. Yeah. Not even a flip flop. It's got that one bar so your toes are exposed, your heels exposed. It's really not a supportive shoe. It's a crummy, a soul. You know, I've seen it. I've seen all different versions. I've seen the Sandal version where you see the whole foot, but it's just covered. It's like fuzzy. But I've also seen like the house slipper, in other words, your foot slides into it. Oh God. Oh right. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:58:40       It opened back only. But it's clearly a slipper. But I think it's just, I think it's a fad where the the fad is like the more that's meant for home, the more you're seeing it out. Yes. I'm saying that it's a statement like this is such relaxed where I take it out cause that's how chill I am. Right. I wear my pj's and my slippers when I'm out and I saw a lot of boys wearing pajama bottoms, like straight jammies. Oh yeah. I like to really like Jeff [inaudible] did a standup in them a few weeks ago. No, he didn't. No bottoms on stage. Yeah. Wow. It's Jeff tape. He could pull it off. I'm just saying that's how relaxed he is. He's that guy though. You believe that he just rolled out of bed and did stand out? Yeah. Well I mean like it is diet. Look at his whole Gatorade on stage.

Speaker 1:          00:59:28       He did. Yeah. Gatorade and hot dogs. Hot Dogs. We did bring Gatorade. You know what I remember about that week that he stayed with us besides when we lived next door to a seven 11 that's all he ate. But that's how we got that. You're saying, excuse me, is that when he would drink the red Gatorade, he would have a ring around his lips, red and his beard. It would like the color would bleed into his beard too. Yeah. So it was kind of a neat bonus with the Gatorade drinking Gatorade and he had the full sugar, not even like the g two, which is what you like to get. Like when you're sick you get like the lesser sugar Gatorade, like serious diarrhea. Yeah. Uh, then I will have some electrolytes, electrolytes. The GTO drink it regularly. I don't like, no, no. We have it as an emergency for when you have diarrhea, diarrhea, like Chicago, Chicago.

Speaker 1:          01:00:22       The funniest thing is we were joking about Chicago once about like as a nickname for it. And I kind of laughed at it and didn't really, you know, he's like, oh, he has a joke name. And then I went to the airport and this lady, it's a lady in the United Terminal. Uh, if you fly United out of lax, she's a black lady in maybe her somewhere between 45 and 55 and she wears sunglasses. But they're clearly like prescription sunglasses, but she wears them at the gate. So you, she stands out because you're right, the woman has sunglasses on and she was like flat 1528 to Chicago was born in now she said it and I was like, Oh yeah, what? And anyways, I saw her a couple of weeks ago and I said, is there a flight to Chicago? Because Chicago goes out of gate 57. Yeah. I approached her and such a car and she to Chicago. Well, I hear, I've heard lots of people say Chicago. I think I didn't really pay attention to the series. Oh cause that's one of the first ones that I really, I mean, I saw her do it over a year ago, but I wasn't really key on Chicago. Oh No, I've heard it. It's very prevalent. It's a common, a common thing. People say Chicago. Oh yeah, I've heard Washington, Washington. I've heard that too. And it's like, wait, what? That's terrible. And uh, Euston my dad's.

Speaker 1:          01:01:53       But when Washington is, it's not forgivable. It's not worship when you cancel a friendship for sure. So it was like, I'm going to Washington, Washington. Nice, stupid. Fuck. It's not Washington. It's not Chicago. Chicago. Why do you, why are you throwing a heart in there? Why people do, but why? Why are you adding a letter that's not even remotely close to? What I hate to is people who call San Francisco Frisco because the natives do not fucking call it. It's just terrible. FRESCA and no one says that when you live up there, it's San Fran. Yeah. He never say friscol. It's fucking rocky time.

Speaker 1:          01:02:32       San Francisco. [inaudible] 69 [inaudible] 69 is the football team in a frack and Frisk Frisco again. April 29th I'm going there. When are you going there?

Speaker 7:          01:06:33       Hi, I'm Kim and I'm here to fill. This is such a beautiful villa. The villa we sitting with the first time ever experience in my life with young men and they have big, hard car to offer me. This villa is really quaint place and it's really, really comfortable with a lot of artifacts inside the house as well as outside the

Speaker 1:          01:07:14       viewers. I want to go do you think that the men watching are super stoked to hear about the artifacts? Probably. Probably a lot of art collectors and we watched all the money in the world last night. Great. How funny was that? Well, we're halfway. I fell asleep halfway through it, but John, Eddie, you're good friends. Mark Walberg is in it. Sorry. You were just talking about it from my friends with, um, that's one of my good friends. So anyways, my buddy marks in it and I'm kind of out of shape. Yeah. I'm going to tell him not really in shape and you're getting fat again. Uh, who plays the mom? Michelle Williams. Gosh, she's so great. She's great in it. This is the infamous film that, uh, Kevin Spacey last shot about 50 days. It was shot ready to go, ready to be released 47 days before it's release. This the, it comes out that he's trying to fuck accused the fucking

Speaker 8:          01:08:16       teenage boy under age boys. And he's a huge, huge how allegedly allegedly allegedly harassing people, allegedly going after underage guys for a long time. Anyway, that, that's the storyline. They go, we can't do this movie with Kevin Spacey. It's all ready to go. It's edited already. So then Ridley Scott, the director says, I'm going to reshoot all of his scenes. This isn't already completed films so crazy. And he cast Christopher plummer at as the reshoot. Uh, so they have to bring in actors that he's obviously in scenes with and reshoot those again, those scenes. Girl, boy, boy, girl. Right. But isn't that amazing? So what they did was the editors sent the, edited the scenes with spacey to set and they would see how they were lit, see how they were blocked, shot everything. And then they would mimic, they'd go to the same space that they just had and they would reshoot it basically exactly the way they did before.

Speaker 8:          01:09:25       But with Christopher plummer instead of Kevin Spacey, it's crazy. The thing of course, it's amazing is that even though spacey is a bigger star than plummer, I mean, you watch plumber and he's actually an elderly man playing an elderly man, which makes sense, right? As opposed to, he was all in makeup to make them look older, but the character was amazing. It was based on the real John Paul Getty who, uh, was a infamously wealthy and stingy man. And he had such, like, there was some things we were really laughing at like, uh, as well as I am sure a lot of rich people experience, they get letters about peoples hardships and want to know if the rich person can help them. So this, you know, they're in the movie, he has his grandson reading him a letter that someone wrote, dear Mr Getty, you know, my, uh, brother needs a liver or he's going to die. And I would hope that you can help us out. God bless. And he's like, he dictates to his grandson. He's like, write dear. So and so. If I gave money to everybody that asked for help and I'd be destitute like you,

Speaker 1:          01:10:39       I also so funny that made us laugh so hard. What a shit head that'd be poor. Like you. Boy, it would be important some of the vigil you and you know what I mean?

Speaker 8:          01:10:47       One of the things, I mean there's not that necessarily didn't necessarily have it, but in real life when his grandson was really kidnapped and the kidnappers did demand ransom, he wouldn't pay his own grandson. And you know in the movie they have him saying things that he probably really said, which was like, I'm not paying that. And they go, even when his, a guy that works for him is like, you know, it's a drop in the bucket to you. And he's like, no, because if this thing doesn't work out, I'd be exposed. I don't really have any money to spare things like that. Or he had a pay phone in his house for guests. That was great. Yeah, that's real. That's real. He had, he had a real pitiful in so that you wouldn't make long distance calls on his dime

Speaker 1:          01:11:29       and then he would do his own laundry by hand and hang it up in the hotel room. Now it's amazing. Yeah. It's such an interesting personality trait to have so much money. The, I had billions of dollars and yet he wouldn't spend, it was, I wonder what's going on. But you know, he'd been,

Speaker 8:          01:11:45       he lived this very luxurious, I mean, the homes and they were outrageous, you know, and he's, he was perhaps the greatest art collector in the world. I mean, you look at the Getty museum's now and it's unbelievable what was in his personal collection, but he wouldn't spend it on, he'd spend it on art, but not on, you know, laundry service. I mean, like, yeah. Little convenience is like that. I mean,

Speaker 1:          01:12:11       see, to me, that's the only reason to have mine. That is the reason. Can you park closer? Yeah. And uh, you know, it's $25 to park here. Okay. Can I not do my own laundry? Like that's, that's fantastic. That's why you have money. You don't have to do all those annoying things in life.

Speaker 8:          01:12:27       He a, yeah, it's gross. When someone's that rich and his pension at that heart.

Speaker 1:          01:12:31       Oh my line billionaire. I don't like that at all. I don't like that either. What's the point? What are you willing to do with all your money? I hate, I hate it.

Speaker 8:          01:12:38       What I hear, I mean, I guess I like cars, but I also hate when I hear about rich guys drive in like whack ass cars and like the fuck is wrong with you man. I love cars. I know that, but this ones, it's really reliable. I get great mileage. Make you rich, the fuck are you doing man? Live a little.

Speaker 1:          01:12:55       I know. I get upset when I hear rich people not spending money on like education for their kids or they're like, we're sending kids to public school. I'm like, yeah, but it in California and a nice, I know that some public schools are great, but where we live it's really not fantastic for the most part. It depends on your neighborhood, right? But it's like to just spend the money. I'll fucking send your kid somewhere. Nice. Yes.

Speaker 8:          01:13:17       If it's a, if it's, it's a, it's eat that. Well, it depends on which, uh, what part of the country and what, what, you know.

Speaker 1:          01:13:24       Yes. No, I know. I know, but I'm saying that there's a, I'm thinking of a specific family. Oh, that we know. Yeah. One of the best schools I ever went to was a public school. It wasn't California. That's true. Bottom of the barrel. That shit. There's definitely a New York, New York is good. No, there's some like regional. Yes. Obviously. But yeah, I don't, it know, that's my, I actually wish I could have gone to that school from, we went about. What about people that don't fix their teeth? The have all the money in the world. That's fucking crazy. We've seen people, we know people like that.

Speaker 8:          01:13:54       Yeah. So it's, it's nuts. I know where you're like, you don't want to, it's what everybody sees. First thing they see your fucking dirty mouth. Yeah. Fix it. Get your two fees fixed. They're colored and there's holes in there. It doesn't look like you know how any of it works. [inaudible] you will see some wild shit. This guy who also doctor drew could give an evaluation and I'll put that on the list. Goes to in the Burger King Margaret came and he kind of start some shit.

Speaker 3:          01:14:30       Hey. Yeah, look at that though.

Speaker 8:          01:14:45       Oh, so he is talking shit knocking shit off the counter and I think he just pushed her register off the counter. Oh, that's a pretty aggressive. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:14:54       Pretty good clock him.

Speaker 1:          01:15:09       He's kind of thing on his leg like a brace. He was being all aggressive. I know that too. Just clocked him hard. Yeah. Well he needed it. Okay. To calm the fuck down. Hold on a second.

Speaker 3:          01:15:19       No, we're standing on his head. He ain't, he's got a good reason to Jesus Christ. Come on up.

Speaker 1:          01:15:34       I say stay on that fucker's right. She said no, just to get up. I'm going to tase his ass. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:15:41       Good for her. Crazy mother fucker. Good. He's crazy. He's out of control. Oh, she came up.

Speaker 1:          01:15:53       She's just kicked him again. Yeah, I dunno how funny this is Tom. Huh?

Speaker 8:          01:16:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:16:03       What part's funny? So you were getting tased or kits? Well, it's just that he's getting it because he deserves it. He went in there and started some shit and then stranger, like that guy that just came in and slapped him doesn't work though. He's just a patron that was like, oh, I can get in a slapped. So she just, first of all, it's one thing if you act out and then like, like that first guy punched him because he, he, he shoved him first. It's like, all right, now he's laying on the ground and someone was like, hold on, I'm going to tase them. Like he's already down. So she goes to tase him and then she

Speaker 3:          01:16:40       gets in a little phase and then this guy comes in slack,

Speaker 1:          01:16:48       kicked and tased again. Ooh. Oh. I do think the slap was unnecessary. The head slap. It was, it was, that was a bonus. Slap wheelies, a bonus lab. He didn't need that at that point. Not entirely, but you can justify it for sure. I definitely think the Taser was good. That was a good move on her part.

Speaker 3:          01:17:06       Tasing some ass. Go girl. Get them again.

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       This guy's out of his fucking mind. Yeah. Get out of their asshole. Good for them. Yeah. Defend your soul book. And he has something. He just, this is his, this thing here at the end. He just grabbed something there. Oh, Mike, something like he parked there. Can you see what it is? I don't know. Like a wheelchair or a little wheely thing for all the A's. I got like a scoot. Scoot for his leg. Oh yeah. Of scoots goods has a scoot scoot and he's, he's talking shit and burger king is crazy. Wow. That's pretty wild. Yeah. Well Deb, shit, that was great. Start some shit made my day. I don't know if I feel the same way, but really, I mean, I just wish she hadn't had done that in the first place, I guess.

Speaker 6:          01:17:58       I mean, you know, you go into Burger King, someone says you go into Burger King on one leg yelling, push it off the counter, uh, start talking shit, getting peeves, people's faces. How do you think it's going to go? Right? Like, is that a good idea? I'd be like, mm,

Speaker 1:          01:18:18       gotta be so retarded. I don't think I would do that. So he's definitely started some shit. Shit. Some shit. Crazy person. Yeah. That's completely unnecessary. Well good for them. They defended themselves. Psych. I could have gone way, way crazier to man. Um, somebody wrote to us on or something. You want to answer that? Why don't dogs have to wipe? I have a question for you. Mommy's, why do dogs not have to wipe their ass after pooping? But humans do. Justin from Portland. Yeah. Well I don't know. I don't know because I actually think our dogs need a wiping sometimes because we've actually had the white bits. He's a pooper after, after a shit. So they kind of do sometimes I'm guessing because their glands or anal glands are stronger, maybe able to pinch it really comes off, right? Yeah. But like I've said, we've had the butts stamp on several pieces of furniture in this house. So yeah, it's remember at fie fuse to do it a lot back in Redondo, we had a carpet that I got from like some cheapy place, Ikea or something. It was covered in

Speaker 6:          01:19:23       dog shit. And that means my brother or sister in law. And I were wondering what you thought about which, uh, which of a conjoined twin pair would have to push to piss the person you horrified by even entertain the subject. But I'm sure we are not the only curious ones about the question. I mean a mommy, Tina tore it up an SLC, uh, best show I've ever seen it. Wise guys ever and way to go. Thank you. Thank you for the car. Well that's an interesting question. They're saying who initiated the puss when they're, when they're conjoined. But from what I've seen from the interviews with conjoined twins, all those questions about who does what, it's one of the phenomenons of what happens. It's neither one. They both do it at the same time.

Speaker 1:          01:20:03       So you're telling me they both feel the urge to shit and they both just, it's the same. Like how do you know which leg to put in front of? Like who goes first? It's just, it just happens on radical. Yeah. So there's some things like you, you just have an automatic body whereas they share those organs. And then who initiates masturbation? That's the same thing. It's like I feel like coming and the other ones like me too and then they just go for it. Some of those hoes are married. Those co-joined. Yeah, those co-joined thoughts are married. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:20:39       Even I know that's silly. True. Do you think so? No, they are. One of them's married and the other one's not. I think two of them got married. How the fuck that guy marries both of them. Then he married one and then when she's just along for the whole marriage. Right. Of course. That's how they live their life. That's terrible. So she wouldn't, she would if she doesn't want to be married, that guy, cause she's married that guy to know the, they both have their own husbands. God, you're just blowing my mind right now. So they all say goodnight, goodnight, goodnight. And then those guys end up being like, hey man, all the time. Who's going to fuck her? But did they have one vagina or to stop it so the guys take turns. It's like my night, it's my night. Sometimes I go in there together. No, they doubt. Sure they do.

Speaker 1:          01:21:33       Yeah, they do. She doesn't do dps. I didn't see that as a DP. Double Vag. I'm sure our audience will inform us of whether or not she's gone. Oh, I know there's a lot of experts out there. I can hear them typing right now. He hasn't found it was released March 8th two guys get your information strain. You guys are not fact checking on this. Yeah, we know. We need to know the truth. Want to get to the real state in Lafferty. Lafata I'm a ball hog. I am paid 10 Lafferty. It's too bad she's in retirement. I feel like we just boosted her career. You know what? I know I would. I would have her in studio just to talk about, talk about that clip that day. How'd that feel to be a ball hog and what was that like? Was it funny to you when they told you about the, I mean those poor women, cause it's dumb things they have to say.

Speaker 1:          01:22:30       And men actually, there's all these silly things. I mean you, you gotta be able to sell those diet. Let's stupid dialogue. Just like on any TV show or thing you're doing with those balls. Yeah. Yeah. Like it's all part of Showbiz. What's up Mr High and Mrs Tight. Big Old fan of both. You notice y'all burp some times on the podcast? Yeah, I can't do that for as long as I can remember. I rarely, Burt, I've tried many times. Please friends have described how to do it and nothing. I can't drink a lot of beer at a time because of it. I just get full when it happened. What happens is I will Burt maybe once or twice a month and even then they are always puny little wimpy burps. This means the odds of me being blessed with a double pipe classic. Extremely rare. It makes me sad now when it comes to farts.

Speaker 1:          01:23:17       Oh my God. Do I fart a lot. That's my gut is a toxic waste pant plant. Anyway, just thought I'd let you know. Keep up the good work. Gene Salute Jake. Well yeah, I think you just nailed it, right? So it's going, it's going down instead of going up. He just didn't ever goes up for him. Yeah, I mean I'd be sad. Well, without burps I have, I know somebody very dear to me and get close to me who can't burp either. It's a girl and I've tried for a year. It's been like situation like I don't want, I won't go there. Okay. But I've tried training her and we tried sewed. I've tried. There's different things you can do. You can, I say it'd be okay, but you can't suck in the air. You can train yourself to burp that way. See, I just did that on command.

Speaker 1:          01:24:06       I can do this guy says he can. He drinks a soda and nothing happens. What happens is he farts choosing to go down. But you think that's like what is going on in this person's body where that happened? It's just the way they're built and yeah, it sounds like it. I mean I don't Burp as much now that I'm pregnant. I think cause I have so much acid reflux happening and I don't want a burb look at you. You just did that. You just did that. That would have made his whole year. Wow. Maybe it just did. I think some people are more inclined to be burpee than others. It's a gift. It's a genetic blessing. All right. Yeah. I don't know. You can train. I mean, you have to suck up the air. Have you tried sucking it up from your stomach? Like I just did that.

Speaker 1:          01:24:49       Yeah. I don't understand. Just I just did that. Swallow more air and then put the swallow. It's not, he said that he swallows air. It's bringing it up and does and to sound that's causing him trouble. I don't know how to teach it. I don't know how to teach it though. I feel like there's just some things that you just know in life, you know? I agree. It's an innate skill, guys. I just is. He's just not your calling now, next lifetime or anything else, June?
