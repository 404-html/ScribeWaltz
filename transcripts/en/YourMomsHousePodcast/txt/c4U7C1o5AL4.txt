Is that what you're saying? Yeah. Or do you think it's gradual or which has she always just been like, I don't feel like I don't feel like it today. Ah, man. I think it's been a slow process. Yeah. First of all, I will. I don't like pointing this out. But you did a hundred percent assume or pronoun and Sodas. I right. Then we don't know. There's no way of knowing any anymore. There is no way. And how cruel of us to assign a pronoun to some, I apologize. Hey. Hi. How are you? What's your name? What's Your Pronoun? Well, I'm assuming it's a she. It's used to be a share now it's, it's a day.

Speaker 4:          00:04:46       Do you think so? No, they ish. That's interesting. It does happen to women at a certain age. I mean we've talked about the, shut it down. Why? For the shut it down lady. So it's a phenomena. It's a shut it down. Usually the shut it down starts with a haircut. That's what we've learned. Oh, with the, with the moms? Yeah. Mom. Yes. Do a more masculine cut and they go, yeah, part of my shut it down. Move. It's the Tony Hawk. Yeah. The bags shut it down. Happens with bodies too. I mean, we always see, I mean with both sexes, it's not just a female thing, but you see people, they're like, oh, they threw in the towel on that hunt nuts. Yeah, no self respect. Nah. Yeah, yeah. Total disregard. Yeah. It to me, look it. I just say it because you know, you gotta fight.

Speaker 4:          00:05:32       You gotta fight. You gotta fight. You can't just throw in the towel. I mean, look to fight every day. For me, I'm struggling. It's always hard for both of us. Yeah, I'm pregnant. You know, you're tired. I'm tired. Anything I want to fucking put on makeup, we're going to say no to sweets. Hire a trainer. Try a man is making an effort. Just try to make, so that's the thing is that your significant other sees the effort and they'd go, well, he's trying. He might look like a fucking pile of dog shit, but he's trying. I don't think you look like a pile of dog should. I think it was great. Much better than that. At least we're both swagged out in our three stripe life. Finally, I'm so excited that you've joined and my tribe, I've been in euro trash my whole life. I came out of my mom's vagina wearing one of these.

Speaker 4:          00:06:12       Yeah. And I'm so excited that team Adidas has given you, threw me some nice, I love it. Gave me a bunch of stuff. I would just been, I've just been flexing stunting on these pools are all my newest like it a welcome to team euro trash. How do you feel? Fucking great. Right and Free Shit, you know, I understand it's gross to be able to buy stuff and get free stuff at the same time. It's a massive box of free Adidas. Shout out to Adidas. Um, you know I got, I got some nice messages from executives. I gotta write some Adidas Shit in my next special dude. Just do it. Do any product that you like. I know I should. Any free new baby coming pampers. Yeah, I'm going to do that. Actually. I like pampers. Huggies, Pampers. I can't even use fucking Huggies man. Yo, I didn't know.

Speaker 4:          00:07:11       I mean, of course I had no idea cause I had never bought them. But Damn, diapers are expensive as shit. And I buy like a month's supply at a time. $50 dude, I know for like a box. And then you got to do the wipes. You can't just dry wipe the baby's ass. That's another fucking fortune, man. You gotta get the quality wipes. You get the cheap wives, you're buying double, you pay, you pay the price, man. I know they sent you the track pants that go with it. Are you going to go full euro trash and do that? And they also sent me this gray, uh, Adidas sweatpants, sweat matching top 11 flights almost over. Let's say I tell you in the 90s, I was all about the matching Adidas. They had the roll over sweat pants and I had the tearaways, the three stripes airways that match this jacket.

Speaker 4:          00:07:59       Yeah, I mean that's fantastic. Also, there's products, you know, you'd never think of trying, but someone gives it to you. I'm telling you, this is not a paid thing, but those boosts, they sent me pure boosts and ultra boost shoes so I never would have bought them because I just don't, I don't buy everything that I hear about, but I went crazy on it. Can I ask you though, because now looking back in retrospect, those tear away pants, not very like practical. Like what? Two people? I guess just for bath it's a, it's a spinoff from basketball because in basketball you were there your warmups so you were more warming up and then it's game time. You just go group and your shorts or on, I don't have to pull them down. Right. You can just rip them off. I always thought ways were the coolest thing too.

Speaker 4:          00:08:43       I remember I remember playing Jv basketball and we had tear away pants and that was the thrill and the game was just doing the terror weapon. You feeling like you're a, yeah, I mean I wasn't athletic at all, but I just liked the idea of snap up pants. So silly. Yeah. And then like the super cool guys, you know, they didn't bug them all the way down, so they had like two open at the bottom. Yeah, I did that. I'd give it a little flare flare. Yeah, Kinda Nice. When you kind of half Giagos things, you didn't really jarring when you had them. You're like, you know what I do love about the three stripe. A full track suit never goes out of style. No, these, yeah, this is timeless. It's timeless. This is the same thing that run DMC was wearing. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:09:29       it's fucking dope. It's still looks fresh.

Speaker 4:          00:09:33       Does Adidas, I love this. This is official Hungarian gear, Dude. I'm so stoked. Deputy. The all white ones. That's, that's real gangster. I need to get you a gold medallion. Where's your gold jewelry dude? That's coming. Let's see what they continue to do here. They're really pissed that I believe this is the garbage truck driver. Oh, poor guys. Just the worst. It's the worst job to have. I don't know if it's the worst job. It's like, but can you, can you give the gun? I mean, listen, hard job. It really flips out. Oh Geez,

Speaker 5:          00:10:09       these are not cars. They don't stop on a dime.

Speaker 4:          00:10:19       Big Boy.

Speaker 5:          00:10:25       I left the carpeting and the note, four bags aren't so much more than ordered.

Speaker 4:          00:10:39       You know, it's uh, I'm always amazed by this ladies so angry and she doesn't curse when someone can do that and she's like big boy, your rear end. She so heated and she's not dropping any, I don't know how people do that. She keeps it Christian Christian temper temper on him. Oh No, I can't do that if I'm super pissed. The worst things coming out. Yeah. I mean she's really, he keeps saying shit. I'm still blown away at how man masculine she is and the shoulders and the shoulder. She might be a weightlifter though. I don't think so. You don't think she, she, she ain't shit better shit to do if she were, I just feel like she got him up and going on. I won't be doing a strict press. A lot of power cleans.

Speaker 5:          00:11:30       Okay. And you're going to pay you liked your job now. I'm a garbage man. Good luck. Cause you ain't going to happen.

Speaker 4:          00:11:45       Okay Weirdo. It's always crazy to me when someone thinks they have that much power, but what is she fuck? Are you, you're going to decide whether this guy has a job or not. She's going to spend that energy doing

Speaker 5:          00:12:00       stop. Don't stop. Don't stop time.

Speaker 4:          00:12:14       I think the interesting is what do you think those tits way we were talking about doors, those are no joke, right? She's not wearing any kind of support bra. What size do you think those are? No. H H h sloppers and they're not even contained, but I'm surprised there's no wild tits on that top is not flattering for that either. Yeah. She's got some big fuck. She is special is touched, but you know, I just think it's such a, I don't, I don't know how people have time for this shit to call up. The man's boss was fired up. I know. What worse cares?

Speaker 5:          00:12:55       Well, what you were supposed to do.

Speaker 2:          00:13:10       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:13:18       Did that stop? Was it ever turned on? Yeah. All right. I just had to do a little camera card switch up.

Speaker 4:          00:13:26       Um, I'm just saying like I can't, I don't, I mean, isn't it hard? Is it his day? Like hard enough. He's up at the crack of dawn. He's picking up trash. It doesn't smell good in there. Oh, you don't think she has these thoughts? Like who cares? Let the guy, but don't you also at this point, this upset at some point? Don't you go, you're not upset about the trash? No, she's upset because she weighs too much. Didn't get the right Bra. That's what she got. The wrong fucking support Bra. I know she has 25 pounds each. She's upset because she woke up a man cause she's so fucking, she's so gnarly. You know, she's just angry. She's angry at other stuff now. She loves in look, listen to this mocking. She's would like Ab psy fucking talk to you like a baby. And she goes, no.

Speaker 5:          00:14:12       All right. And you can even follow. Why don't you go back?

Speaker 2:          00:14:24       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:14:24       You know, my mom was like this, so, and I think that's why it also bothers me. Balanced.

Speaker 5:          00:14:34       Exactly.

Speaker 4:          00:14:34       My mom would like yell at salespeople like this or she took everything personally.

Speaker 2:          00:14:58       That's a really good point. It's really good thing to think about actually. Yeah. Um Hm.

Speaker 4:          00:15:05       Or menstrual blood lady and she's got managed her blood on her face as you're doing.

Speaker 2:          00:15:34       She's just

Speaker 5:          00:15:40       tier.

Speaker 4:          00:15:53       Yeah, they're moving. I didn't see him move before and now I see him showing him. You've got to restrain those tests. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh boy.

Speaker 2:          00:16:03       Yeah. This guy, I mean, she's kind of feels like an audition way that she's very theatrical. What she's, yeah, sure, sure. I'm a kind of impressed directing skills. It's pretty good. Pretty good

Speaker 5:          00:16:19       look.

That's my thing. Do it. Do it. See, hey, she's really losing it and see if the tape until now with that mirror wasn't there. Oh, she got that. The fucking world. There's a big old milkers goes flat wagons. Oh, am I

Speaker 5:          00:17:06       guy

Speaker 4:          00:17:11       dumpers yeah. She's got big old fucking dumpy to hate when these videos and like this and I don't know what happened next, what the resolution was or anything. It is compelling. It is compelling stuff. If anybody knows what 50 pound tits did next, anyone has a follow up, we'd love to hear about it. I mean hers way more than mine, right? Oh yeah, of course. Those are three times the size of your test. Speaking of your tits, um, at least I hardest mine properly. Like I buy the right size bras. I got it. Do that. Um, here it is. Where is it or is

Speaker 2:          00:17:47       it a better, I'm sorry. See it a lot of, uh, votes on how much my tits way. Yeah, that's what I was trying to find. I saw. Sure. I'll just tell you the tweets. I've been getting people who have been ranging from six pounds each to two and a half to 15 or 20 I have some relevant info regarding the weight of money. Mommy, Tina's mushy perps. My girlfriend had g size slobby hangers when I first met her due to them interfering with our com hugs and her spine curvature. She had them reduced to see cups and lost a total of five operation genes. Hangers have got to be high and tight with mommy milk. So 15 pounds a piece is a fair estimate. You both. Wow. So when I'm, when they're full of milk for sure. At least. Yeah. Cause they keep growing during your pregnancy.

Speaker 2:          00:18:36       Yeah. They're getting bigger now even more because there's the milk ducts are starting to and then people have submitted different techniques. Great quick solution for tit. Wait, just have Tina Stan on irregular bathroom scale. Then have her do it again while Tommy holds up her tits. The difference that's from Dane. Okay, well let's think about that. Does that really work? Yeah, I guess I guess that would work. I don't know, but I feel like, I mean that's a technique but it's not going to be as accurate as just getting that team. I'm not so sure. Someone said they weighed the tits on a Deli scale. Um, if you'd be interested. Years ago when I was just last double D's, I worked for a deli. It was a slow Sunday. It's working with the all female staff. They were not as blessed as I am in the 10 department and like to gently tease me about my abundance.

Speaker 2:          00:19:25       We wildly, we wonder how much they weighed a well, we had it happen to have a deli meat scale at hand. We were silly on free milkshakes and all the weed we smoked in the basement. He gave it a try after placing a sheet of Delhi tissue on the scale, I stepped up, popped out my broad, proceeded the way that my had a lefty at 4.7 pounds, right, was 5.2 don't sanitize the scale and everyone got their tits out and there was hot scissoring. Just kidding. We cleaned up and clocked out. Now I have a great story to tell it. My job interviews your Moshi purples high and tight. Lisa in Virginia, if you would like any advice on how to accomplish a tit weigh in? I consider myself pretty much an expert in the sport. Well now I just have to get my hands on a deli scam.

Speaker 2:          00:20:08       That's right. People had mentioned that. They have been mentioning that somebody else said that this kitchen scale is something you could do. A couple of months ago, my boyfriend and I had the same question, so I got out that glass top kitchen scale, laid it on the edge of the table and got down to the level of the table where the bottom of my tits lined up at the top of the scale. Plop the tit on top 34 double d and each one rounded out to six pounds. Whoa. How's total Holly? Who Found Lynn Canada? He asked. I estimate Christina's tit. Wait at 18 pounds. Wow. So we can just buy one from Amazon. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:20:47       Glass scale too. Here's the thing though, but how do you know that the pressure of you? I know what she's saying. You're going to plop it on there, but how do you know you're not putting more pressure on the scale by how you're standing or something to consider for horse? These are all factors. I think the Deli scale might be the only. Yeah. Do you think we could try the whole farts? You think they would let us do it? Yeah, we were friends with those workers. Yeah, that's totally possible. Deli meat scale cause a deli meats scale. I feel like it's used to being very precise. You know he measure out thin slices of meat. It's very precisely right. Those are big tits. Oh, those are real big double D's. Even. I'm surprised how much those way. Huge Teddy's I want to get mine reduced after. Definitely. What do you wanna bring him down to see? Yeah, a C Cup will be like being in fifth grade again for me. I can fucking run

Speaker 2:          00:21:44       right before we started recording, I saw this came up that I'm Sony pictures has apologized. Yeah. After Peter Rabbit, the movie exploits a food allergy setting. Some parents. Oh, the a food allergy. Huh? Her Son has food allergies and a scene in the film shows blackberries being used as a weapon. The backlash to the scene has already drawn an apology from the filmmakers. Oh, good. Good. Holy Shit.

Speaker 4:          00:22:12       Well, I'm glad we're apologizing. The big corporations are yielding to these idiots. That's great. Oh, good example. Encouraged the other dummies to come forward.

Speaker 2:          00:22:22       Allergies are often not taken seriously enough. Haven't trivializing the big screen by such a popular character is immensely in a statement. Sony pictures apologize. Food allergies are a serious issue. Our film should not have made light of Peter Rabbit's, arch nemesis, Mr Mcgregor being allergic to blackberries. Even in a cartoonish, slapstick way. The statement which attributed in part to the films, directors, writers, and producers added. We sincerely regret not being more aware and sensitive to this issue. And we truly apologize. She's just,

Speaker 4:          00:22:52       is this, the end of us is as a CN of America. I mean, this is a food allergy joke. And here's the thing. I, you know, I was, as I was posting Christ, uh, a joke about he man the other day on my Instagram, it's a, it's a meme that someone sent me on Twitter. It's like he man is now changed it to himself to the man and I, and I was just picturing the backlash though. Yeah. That's pretty funny. Yeah. And um, and somebody being like, but I'm non binary and I was really thinking about this in a logical, philosophical way. Yeah. Okay. So what's wrong? So someone has a food allergy. What's wrong with making a, putting it in a story that somebody has a food allergy? You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 2:          00:23:34       Well, cause you're making, they made fun of like he was written, it was trying to find his epi pen and then he went in

Speaker 4:          00:23:40       shock. And that was the joke. He did not, yeah. Oh, is that right? Yeah, but so what, so what if somebody is upset about it? I have that thing and you can't make fun of it. That's the logic, right. Affects me. It makes me sad. Therefore you can't joke about it. Claude. Things that don't affect me personally, but here we go. If we keep apologizing to everybody, then it's an infinite apologies and we can't talk about shit. Yeah. I'm sure that you could go to some of these people and be like, how do you feel about jokes about Mexicans? And they'd be like, I mean that's fine. I don't know any Mexicans I know about these fucking peanut allergy remedies. Blackberries are upsetting to my, to me personally because I have the allergy. It's very selective. Yeah. It's just always about only what affects you is offensive.

Speaker 4:          00:24:31       It's just a logic. So I was thinking to myself, let's say somebody is going to contact me from the non-binary community. I'm non by. Okay, so what, so why does that mean I can't joke about it because you're being, I dunno, it's, you're being insensitive to something being insensitive. And so why is that? Is it necessarily immoral? Is it wrong to be not funny? It's not funny because it's something that, that, um, that I've, I've been going through and I can tell you that it's not funny. It's not funny for you, but it's funny for everybody else. They shouldn't be laughing cause it's not a fun day. So we should control the external world to make your internal. She just, if you were actually funny, you could figure out something else to joke about that didn't, it wasn't at the expense of people with allergies who haven't decided their pronoun yet.

Speaker 4:          00:25:19       It's my favorite. Yeah, no, it's a, it's an endless cycle. I mean it could just go on and on and on. And the problem too, like I said, as the Sony's are cowtowing to this horribly stupid logic, amazing part is that they extended her an apology for that. I mean, is there a huge blackberry allergy community that there must be somewhat, I think it's also not even just blackberry allergies. It's just parents. I mean I have friends, we, we know people whose children are allergic to. Um, you know, foods peanuts. Are you kidding me, Lj? I put him in preschool when I was doing the enrollment papers. They give you a sheet this long. Just reading you the riot. Act On, do not pack any, not related. No peanut butter, almond butter, nut butter, soy butter at any good, no nuts, no nuts, granola bars.

Speaker 4:          00:26:05       You have to buy them without nuts. Is that even possible? Is there even a bar thing? Is that I totally get that part and I get some kids going to die. Yeah, no, I get it. I get it and I get it that it's just, you know, this is a really serious issue for some families. I'm glad we don't have it. Yes, of course. But I still think you can make jokes and make fun of the allergy. Not you're not making fun of the kid. You're making fun of the fact that they gave to give you a sheet now because of the thing or whatever the joke is. I mean, people have aids jokes. Oh, such good ones and you know, we haven't heard enough. I feel like people have been writing it in. People have holocaust jokes. Yeah. Rape. Rape is great. Yeah. I'm glad that was your sentence.

Speaker 4:          00:26:51       But yeah, people joke about all types of things. Deafness, disabilities, everything. Yeah. We've, I think you and I have covered personally. I've heard from a few people I know. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think the thing is, the answer for all those people is like, just don't laugh if you don't think it's funny and also watch something else. Let's move on with your life. Are there no other movies playing right now? Here's the thing. You know me and I don't like vomiting. I have a phobia of vomiting, so whenever it's in a film, I just don't like it for that brief. Second, would I write the movie people and let them know I have a phobia? I don't like seeing it. You should take it out. You just go, oh, that's a moment that I'm not going to care for in this guy's act. Or it's just so silly.

Speaker 4:          00:27:37       People are fucking out of there and I'm kind of enjoying watching people spiral though. I'm kind of getting off on it now. Like now that it's extended to food allergies now it's great. I hope it keeps going. I hope it, I hope the, the outrage keeps going to more and more absurd things like I hope they start going like, and then he made fun of his friend for not liking cheese in the movie and I come from a dairy family and then somebody was like, you know, we should have been thoughtful about the dairy community in Wisconsin and we apologize for that joke and that and then just let it keep going, let it. But the only reason that the Sonys of the world are apologizing is because of the internet and the visibility of these dummies who rallied together and Facebook groups and groups on Twitter and they use social media to collectively be idiots. And you know, Sony doesn't want their name being tarnished, I'm assuming. So they have to shut these idiots up somehow. It's ridiculous. Anyway, speaking of lunacy, we found the best goddamn reality show last night. Oh my God. Well, what's the called? Love. I posted it on my Instagram. I'm Christina [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          00:28:50       Mais I'm the Christina p. It's called love after lock up. And you would think that it would just be a show about like dating, but it's better than that. Oh my people that are marrying convicted felons. It's amazing. It is amazing. I wonder, what is it called again? You just said love after lockup. It's on we TV and we were scrolling through last night. You were taking a shit as usual and I saw this jam and I thought it doesn't get any better than inmates dating non inmates.

Speaker 6:          00:29:29       Jesus help me. Jesus. I discovered thought, oh my gosh, it's beautiful. Lives in California. Convict Grandad. Oh Wow. They looked up and saw as mugshot. I was like, wow, this guy takes a really hot mugshot out. My man is a good man. Prison man. Once released my dream wedding, my dad would be walking me down the aisle. If you're crazy,

Speaker 4:          00:30:19       do they have to? Why do they have to marry immediately? My Dad and mark it down the aisle is hard. I had a twin that daddy would walk me down the aisle that will be hospice and all my bridesmaids would where? Few shot. Yeah. That girl is obsessed. They're all fucked up. These people are actually super sad. Yeah. You could tell that they're all, they're all scared, like they were like kicked dogs. They're like, I just want a nice owner, and oddly enough, ironically, they feel like this will be the good owner. Well, yeah, because what it is is that they say it in the shell like, well, the thing is there's less quote, less risk dating an inmate because there's less theoretically things they can do to you. Right. They can't cheat on you. They can't do anything bad, but the irony is they're actually way more harmful to these poor souls because they're criminals.

Speaker 4:          00:31:15       They're manipulating this. This woman took $20,000 from this guy. Well, he's sent her and she admits. Then she's like, at first I was just like trying to pull money out of them. You're like, I'm a con artist, but now I'm not now change. Yeah, they're, my favorite is that one lady's dating a guy who's been locked up for eight eight, eight eight 18 he has not seen the outside for two decades. He's never like see the enter and she has kids, she has kids. She was like, I'm gonna marry him. And like this will be their new debt. Instant Dad. And you're like three small children and they're all like young children. Yeah. Nice little sweet kids and she's new dead. Well he has been uh, doing some stuff and he's finally here. It's nice and thoughtful of her because she also likes to think of what gang affiliation he has when she gets dressed and stuff believable. He's like, well he's a crip so I can't wear red when I pick him up. And you're like, really is that important right here he is talking about it.

Speaker 6:          00:32:19       I never had a job in my life until I started working in and out of jail. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 4:          00:32:33       I'm not saying maybe these guys in prison can't turn it around and maybe they are a nice cute cause. Not everybody's all and no such thing as redemption and all that. But I mean how about you give it a minute before you get married? Running into the, to the wedding is it cannot be a good idea. So then the girl, this is her daddy or looking at and she's 26 or 26, and her boo is getting out of prison and he's 24. Just a laundry list of when is it vehicle? He's stealing cars. All kinds of stuff. Yeah, he's stealing and um, he's broken in the homes and credit cause he's my favorite. He's one, he's one of these white boys like, yeah. You know, relationship with a female in a minute. What Dude? Transracial I believe he's really adaptable. Lingo. Female. Yeah, he's cute relations in a minute. Uh Huh.

Speaker 5:          00:33:40       Mormon girl. Shoot somebody.

Speaker 4:          00:33:47       She gets mad when they teaser. They like, you married a guy prison. Where did you get that ring? Like in, uh, at the little penny slot machine in prison. And she's like, you gotta make up funny one. Now she could, that's disrespectful. You're being disrespectful. It's like, no, they're actually being honest with you, dummy. Uh, so the, the, the 26 year old girl, her whole thing is, she just wants the wedding. You know, it doesn't matter to who, just that this guy comes out and that I can't wear a dress and my bridesmaids can't wear burgundy and we can handle anyway. Then it's like you don't even care who you're marrying a lot. Both of these women are like, I just want the dress. I just want, they just want to have their fantasy wedding. Yeah. It's really fucked up. And I think that's what's really fucked up about women and how they raise us little girls from the very beginning. A lot of this Disney horse shit. Uh, it's called, I mean, listen, my parents certainly didn't pump that into my head. The, no, I know. But I think now there's such, there's such a level of awareness that you have a chance if you have a little girl, Ooh. To not put that in her head, that the greatest day ever will be your wedding day, most important day of your life or into your life. And you can be a princess prep for one day. Get to be the princess.

Speaker 4:          00:35:02       All the colors that you love the most. Yeah. But remember like those Gypsies, the Big Gypsy wedding show, that was her whole thing my mother had put in my head at one solitaire diamond with diamonds all around it. And then horses. That's my dream. And then you're just uses live in the memory of that day? I think so. That's the best day. I mean it's so, it's so crazy to me that that's the biggest highlight of your life is a stupid fucking wedding. You gotta be kidding. She's a real, I guess

Speaker 7:          00:35:37       you could call him a trick. It wasn't true. And the thing is though, that the way he was with me, how I was able to be honest with him, he was okay with me being me.

Speaker 4:          00:35:54       He's broken too. Just like, oh, okay baby. I ain't buying shit. He can't afford for her. Yeah, she's gonna. She's gonna Bleed them dry leave. It's of course it's, it's all, it's so great though. What a great, what a great show. In delusion, you get to see how people talk themselves into bad ideas. It's fun. If you guys want to show love after lock up, I wish I could find this guy. This guy is guys, the Trans Racial Man. Yeah. Yeah. The trans racial identify with. Would you say is he here? He has Garrett. That's his name.

Speaker 8:          00:36:36       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:36:38       and then, um, that's the other thing is that they're Marion people. They've never also slept with, never had sex, never had a date, never had anything normal, nothing. Can't have conversations on the phone longer than 15 minutes. And then there's the guy marrying the heroin girl. Ah, forget that. He's sweet. He was a, he's a marine. He's an it guy. Crazy eyes though. Yeah. Doctor drew was telling us when you see the tops of the whites, it's like a pulmonary thing. No, that was the best thing. Is that crystal meth or drugs? Dr Group. But uh, yeah, so he's sweet as can be. He's a good guy. And then just eastern European hall, one of my tribe, a ropes and in with the Internet pictures of her and she's a former yet recovering heroin addict and she got put in prison for, for what was she doing? Possession and intent to distribute or something. Heroin. Special heroin.

Speaker 4:          00:37:36       Yup. Good stuff. Could you imagine your child being like, I'm marrying this? Well that's what this shows you. These, these parents did Fallon fuck that one guys. So he's like, you're gonna marry this guy. She's like, he'd give him a chance. He's a great guy, but the great guideline is my favorite. They should, I don't know, just earn the great guy. Satisfying. If you have to tell people, you know what I mean? What is up with this great guy? He's doing 18 years for armed robbery. Oh yes. He's great at crime. That's what I meant to say.

Speaker 8:          00:38:11       Oh,

Speaker 4:          00:38:15       and then waiting and waiting for this data is going to pick them up.

Speaker 4:          00:38:28       She got some a matching outfit. That's the priority. Is that

Speaker 9:          00:38:34       2198 Oh yeah. And then the lady,

Tom, I think he's held in prison for burglaries, grand thefts, Dnn from people's homes, cars and a jog, jog, use and drug possession. I was sentenced to eight years in prison, five years probation and judge treatment when I was 18 it was definitely crazy. You know, going to prison for all those years. Living with 80 guys in the room. I love it. Everyone has onto your motives. Everyone always wants something from criminals are shitty people. Like a hundred best days of my life. It's one of the best days of my life. All right. Can we go

Speaker 8:          00:45:54       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:45:54       Happened a couple of weeks ago and a lot of people were talking about it, but I don't know if you heard about it or saw it. And that is Tom Brady the quarter.

Speaker 4:          00:46:03       Tom Brady is how you're supposed to say. Some people say that. Yeah, I've heard that. I don't know anything about, he did this show for Facebook where he let cameras follow them around. Oh, I heard about this and he his son and kissed him or something and it wasn't good enough. And he went back for seconds. Well just here. Just why. Okay. Let me see.

Speaker 8:          00:46:20       So getting like treatment, I was wondering if I could check my, we won't get every now and Jack. Everything comes at a cost, but it was like a peck is your fantasy quarterback check Cam Newton. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:46:45       See now that I see it because I've heard people talking about it. Yeah. Okay. So he goes in for one pack and then he's, he goes in for a second one and the second was really meaningful mouth cast with his dad. It's weird to me. Okay. Yeah. Look, I know that some families they mouth kiss. Yeah. But I think the same sex is kind of, it's a little for me personally, it's just not my thing. I don't mouth kiss our son. I don't think that that's, I've never kissed anyone in my family. No. I accidentally did my Stepdad once, he wa he turned his head. Yeah. My Indian stepdad accidents. But I'm talking about the regular [inaudible] that happened in the early nineties and I'm thinking about it ever since. Like it was a bad moment cause

Speaker 2:          00:47:23       cheek kissing is so big in, um, my mom's culture. Yeah. Like there's never a mistake

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       for a mouth. No, I don't. I don't know if I didn't, if I didn't have her, um, I think my dad's family, I probably, I don't even know if we'd go past hugs. You know, your dad's more formal. Yeah, they're definitely Gary. And you kiss both cheeks. Yeah. Now it's where cheek kissers we're not mouth kissers this is a very weird thing. I don't, I'm not into this man. So He's coming back for number two. It's so sensual to, it's so weird in this account. It, let's go

Speaker 5:          00:47:57       already know Jack. Everything comes at a cost. That was the short one. He says, come back. Oh, that's weird. I'm, is Dan here? Wait, did you hear him say, but I'm his dad. It was like, here he is with his dad. So yeah, this has caused a huge conversation before. So he's 11 years old, Tom, because this is a family thing. Maybe it's a little bit longer than it should be.

Speaker 4:          00:48:37       Oh, they didn't show it because he also, they show him Tom with his, you know, 70 year old dad and they killed the mouth. The mouth. Could you imagine kissing top dog's mouth feel so bad for my mother? Yeah. I mean the smells alone that come out of your dad's mouth. His Dad mouth on your dad mouth. Yeah. And I keep drinking coffee. It's going to my dad. Matt's going to kick in generational dad mouth kissing. Disgusting. I Dunno. What do you think? I mean, would you kiss Ellis? No. You don't kiss Ellis on the mouth? No. I mean, I think, I mean probably as a, I don't, I kiss him on his cheeks. I think it's an appropriate personally.

Speaker 4:          00:49:18       And I don't, I don't want to as a little kid personally, like, you know how Nasty Your Dad's mouth is? My Dad's mouth has been nasty since I can remember like, just try putting his mouth on. I don't even like the idea of it. Just Devin mouth is nasty. I don't like that. I know. I Dunno. I don't wanna like I don't want to, um, I'm sure we just contributed to that. That kid probably got tortured at school. Well that's enlisted and that's Tom Brady's fault for exposing his children on the fucking show or whatever. But now that being said, I grew up with a family. A friend of mine, he would mouth kiss his mother, his father and his sister, good night and hello. I am it. There are nice family ethnicity. They were Jewish, White Jews. Uh, and uh, he was a goth kid with us, which is even weirder.

Speaker 4:          00:50:20       Mouth Kissing and they were a nice family. They're are super nice. And it was like, I remember the mom would be like, hey, give your sister a goodnight. And then he would go and mouth kiss sister goodnight and then goodnight dad, mouth kiss, dad mouth kiss mom. What's a weird one too? I've had, it happened only a few times but kind of had some high society girls that are like theirs that they're friends. It's not a dating thing. Greet you with mouse case. Not that I know I've had it before too where you go like, and what I mean by high society is, you know like a fluent types who like country clubbers who greet you with mouth kisses and, and like a, they do with all their friends, you know, friends. I do think family, especially opposite sex might be a little hanky. No, I'll say I think it's kind of odd in my family though, we bathed together and we have for years and you know, when I go home and I see my folks will take a bath, I took a shower together.

Speaker 4:          00:51:22       Well a lot of times I'll tell you what, my mom and dad and we, you know, we soap each other up, but it's like I've just never thought twice about it. Family shower. Well, in California two we have strict water regulations and I remember in college when I would go home, uh, if I brought, like sometimes my friends would come with me, it'll be my dad, myself and my friend. We'd all take a shower or bath together and that was just how we do things. And then sometimes when you pooped, your dad would poop in between your legs or I would put it between his legs. That's right. So we poop at the same time, which is also a nice water saver to water saver. But again, some people think that's weird. Sure. I mean that's just how we do it in our house. I don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:52:02       My family was not affectionate either, but I think the mouth kiss would fucking Allen like that to you with hung goes, you guys do cheek kisses shakes. Yeah. You give one to sometimes a third I've seen have been, uh, I think in Spain it was always two, one, two, and then there's places where you do three, one, two, three. It was a, I think the Swiss do three. Yes. Yeah. Hungarians you say that's a lot of work by the stupid Poussey for people don't know is kissing. Yes, yes. Yeah, I do. Um, I think one, two, three is a lot of work too much. Come on. And I didn't like kissing Hungarian guys growing up because they were a lot of aftershave. And I remember like my dad's friends would be, have really greasy, smelly cheeks and then they kiss you, they kissed you as a kid and then you smell like what that fucking hongos face smelled like.

Speaker 4:          00:52:54       You know the Argentine men, you kiss each other the same way because in like in Peru, it's only opposite sexes that greet with a kiss. The Argentinians, the men do it to each other. That's fucking gay too. Yeah, it's Super Gay. I thought. So the first time it happened, I pulled back and uh, my, one of my cousins was like, I dunno, this is, I was like, Nah, Bro. And then he grabbed her nuts and then he's like, let it go, relax. And no, Hungarians are way too homophobic for that shit. They'd be like, fuck you fucking me. Kiss me, kiss my Dick. Right now. Yeah, no way, Bro. Here's some foreigners. These guys are, let's see. This is the, uh, the shepherds, Bush Raiders rugby team. They are an Australian rules football team based in London. Apparently this speech helped him out. Account a comeback. I love this type of sports shit.

Speaker 7:          00:54:01       Yes.

Speaker 4:          00:54:16       Fuck these cuts.

Speaker 7:          00:54:17       That's what I'm asking

Speaker 4:          00:54:34       God, these guys. But he's saying these cunts, which I respect. Yeah. They came down, there were 48 points down in the second quarter and they won by two after that cut speech. Wow. Yeah. See, I feel like I would just talk that way normally. Yeah. Doc was like, those are the kinds of speeches I'd be giving. Normally. You'd just talk like that. I feel like that's the kind of fiery need to win. You know? That's how I talked to myself before I go up on stage. Fucking cons is fine. Take this. You take care of yourself down before you go. Do you really need that? No. No, no, but I can't be in a good mood. I can't feel good about myself or feel, um, happy. We have a hundred percent opposite requirements. What do you do? I don't like go. I've obviously you've everyone who's done it this long has gone on stage with the full spectrum of feelings.

Speaker 4:          00:55:28       So I know, you know, I've gone on stage in a horrible mood. I've gone on stage and a great, uh, I think I'm a much better show and a better comic when I'm in a great mood and when I feel loose and I'm laughing about stuff, I think I'm a better comic. Yeah. Um, but some people, you know that energies is weird on that doesn't work for me. I have to feel miserable, have to feel a little self loathing and I ha I just have to get, it's like it's not that I'm really feeling that way but because I'm a pretty happy person actually. But from my comedy brain to flip over, I have to go in there before I can get up. It's like a weird thing. I have to switch into that mode. I can't, I can't just be like happy go lucky and go up there cause I won't focus.

Speaker 4:          00:56:11       I won't, I won't be funny. I don't know why you won't be funny if you, if I go up, they're happy, everything's great. It doesn't work for me. I have to get content out to get miserable. It's just how, it's just how it goes. It goes, I got to my Tonya Harding, I gotta, I gotta fight the imaginary, uh, you know, mom figure I think is what's happening. Honestly, I got to prove somebody wrong. I'm so crazy. My brain. I got it. Yeah, it's a lot. Well, it's a, it's a lot only for comedy, but I don't, I don't do it in my regular life, but I just know like that's where I have to access to do the thing that I do. You know what he's, what do you say to yourself? What if you're in a good mood? Yeah. Then I have to talk myself down too.

Speaker 4:          00:56:57       I mean I just have to get, I have to remind myself of the harder times to stand up and when I used to have to fight for the audience to pay attention to me. And if I like, I have to go to a like Toledo comedy connection with two axes. When I was opening, it was an opening act and I'm eating fucking Nachos for dinner and I'm staying in a motel. I just remember those times when you really, you deliberately take yourself. Yes, I do. I have to go back to like the, the grime and the hard stuff. I don't know. And then the performance feels better. Yeah. It's like Rodney, no respect. Think. Imagine if Friday went up there and was like, everything's great. My wife loves me, my kids respect me. It just wouldn't be, I think for me how I'm funny is to be just a little miserable, a little, a little saucy. Right. I have to be a little spicy,

Speaker 2:          00:57:48       by the way, I didn't even see that this was here. We were discussing the pronouns earlier. Um, I worked for a Social Services Agency and recently my agency forced all staff to declare our gender pronouns, public emails. Oh, can coworkers and anyone in the public we might email. Well, I support individuals rights to declare their own identity and pronouns. I feel like this top down decision is way overreaching plus for the people still nervous about it. My work is basically forcing them to make a decision they may not be ready to make. That's interesting. I wanted to hear your thoughts before I sent her a long email about my thoughts. Hi, how are you? What's your name? What's Your Pronoun?

Speaker 4:          00:58:28       Well, here's the thing about gender identity is that it's fluid. So what you may want to say to HR is today I'm, I'm a her. Tomorrow I could flux and be a hero

Speaker 2:          00:58:37       is actually an excellent point. Thank you. Would I would highlight, I would, I would make that an even bigger point and say, um, you know, I don't appreciate being forced. Ooh, good declaration right now. Although I see that you're doing it so that people who have made their pronouns decision can let people know. And people can not offend them. But one of the things that really bothers me is as a gender fluid individual, um, I am only into using this pronoun for the moment. That doesn't mean that at all. Like it tomorrow or even by the end of this email. Exactly our hourly, I can change my gender. You could also speak for others and say, and others also have the right to change their pronouns on a regular

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       basis. Here's the way I suggest that this email go out at the beginning of each day. I would go a step farther. Every hour. Yeah. Hourly and update as to what everyone's pronouns are. So nobody's affected negatively. When somebody miss identifies their pronouns. What's Your Pronoun? Yeah, maybe keep up. I Dunno. Like we used to have these when I worked in offices, you know the messenger window. Yeah. And whoever's fluxing at the moment can update the entire staff. So we all so nobody gets their feelings hurt when there are misidentified. Yeah, that's true. It's so complicated.

Speaker 2:          00:59:54       Mistake. It's very, you know what? It is. Logical. Makes Sense. Makes a lot of sense. It's a good one

Speaker 4:          01:00:04       way to spend the HR energy. You know what I'm saying? Corporate energy needs to be spent on, on pronouns and identify them.

Speaker 2:          01:00:11       Yeah. Um, what is this world? Mommy's loved the show. Can't wait to see Tom and Omaha. I have a story about my cousin who was born with six toes on his left foot. Yeah. When they went to the doctor to get it removed, they cut off the wrong tone. Shut up. So instead of cutting off the outside Pinky, which I don't know what you call that, the cut off the actual pinky toe. No, look at his foot. He has a two inch gap between the ring toe and his pinkie and being the mess of person I am. I would laugh every time I saw it. Sure. Fuck all the haters and the cross eyed doctor who can't tell the difference between a regular tow and the extra one, Billy Jesus. That's bad luck. How does that happen? You don't have like a big marker that you point to the fucking thing.

Speaker 4:          01:00:52       Yeah, I will. I've read, I've seen that in movies where people put an x on the leg they're supposed to have amputated just to make sure. Yeah. Yeah, I do. How do you get the wrong one off dude?

Speaker 2:          01:01:01       I Dunno. Fuck that. I remember in town it was Tampa. Um, it was a big, it was a, it became a national story, but it was a guy who was supposed to have his leg amputated. Amputated the wrong one. Yeah. Cool. So he became a double amputee. God dammit. Hang on. Oh one sucks. But at least it's, you know, survivable kind of. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:01:21       Yeah. Cause you, your equilibrium will be off with the, with a missing toe, but you won't be

Speaker 2:          01:01:26       completely horrible. Or at least that guy, the guy who, you know, I'm sure one of those last thoughts. And last they said it was like, hey, at least you'll still have one leg. And he was a true,

Speaker 4:          01:01:36       and then you wake up and they're like big, actually

Speaker 2:          01:01:40       I second sake you're going to lose both. But also we're going to give you like $6 million. And he was like, all right,

Speaker 4:          01:01:47       for, is that worth it? Does that mean, what dollar amount would that be worth to you? I'd be super, do you know that's how the law works though. The idea is to make you whole, again, that's the phrase I used in my two weeks in law school to make somebody whole again. And what that means is monetary compensation. It's, that's literally what they're doing is like we'll just fill up the leg hole with money. Oh

Speaker 2:          01:02:12       that um, those monetary settlements are based on the, you have

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       and your ability to earn money. So like when, right. Tracy Morgan was in that huge accident with the Walmart driver. Oh, right, right, right, right. He, you know, the terms has never been released, but it's been a reported that his settlement amount is astronomical because he's earned, you know, he's worth a lot of money and the potential earnings that they could affect when he was out of commission are off the chain to diminish. How would it affect it as potential turning and you saw it like with him, they don't go like, like for a regular Joe they might say, we'll give you $5 million. Right, okay. Yeah. And with him it's many, many, many times. That's his definition of making him exactly, which is just money, which is bananas to me. I would also throw in stuff like, I mean like if you got murdered by someone, like I be like, I want to, I want that guy to apologize to me every morning I wanted to come to my house and like get down on his knees and beg forgiveness and stuff like that.

Speaker 4:          01:03:19       Like what is this like for instance carry, you just demand that whoever did the wrong common repent like every morning to you don't think you can do that. I'd like to, if someone murdered, did you see that guy that wanted to kill the, the in the courtroom? Who is it? It's that famous trial and he's like to the, to the judge, like can I spend some time alone with this man? The one that was at the coach that was molesting? Yeah. The doctor that the USA gym and then he took off, tried to attack them and the, yeah, the cops tackled them and yeah, but that was great. He's like, can I have money alone in the room with this guy? And she was like, no. It's like I was going to do it anyway. You like good for you. Yeah, totally understandable. Was even held in contempt or like, I don't know, probably.

Speaker 4:          01:04:06       I'm sure it's one of those things where they have to, you know, protect any citizen from that happening. They pry pull 'em back and they're like, that's $5. Yeah. It's all good man. I wish we could give you five minutes with him. Yeah, yeah. God Damn. Doctor Nassar. Yes. What a scumbag. He was like, he molested sexually abuse like hundreds of girls, so horrible real piece of garbage. Um, this was great. This is from super bowl week. Uh, this is a guy, his name was Al Sean Jeffries and I think he played college ball at South Carolina, if I remember correctly. Plays for Philadelphia. And one of the big things about the super bowl is you have, it's basically media week. There's a lot of hype around the game. So the guys have to do media day and there's just all these things around the game and he could not be less interested. And you could tell that when he's being interviewed. I mean, this is just magic. I love shit like this.

Speaker 9:          01:05:03       We were talking to lane earlier and he said that he and the team and everybody's trying to keep this as normal of a week as possible, but this is anything but normal. How much fun is this and how much are you enjoying this experience so far? All right, misty. God Man, this shit terrible. Donatos I find that we could have stayed in Philly. Come on Friday or Saturday.

Speaker 4:          01:05:24       Yeah. Love it. I love it. Totally honest. Yeah. He's not doing the, um, the answer that they want you to like the NFL wants. You'd be like, this is great, man. I'm having so much fun.

Speaker 9:          01:05:35       Then you wouldn't get to see Timberlake and all the other celebrities. It's part of the experience, right? Uh, you're a normal person. Then he bleeds just like, I believe he got through. It was just like, so, I mean he's, he's a celebrities to you. I mean, hats off to him. I listen to his music. I'm here, great guy. I mean great artists, but I'm here to play football. I care less about other shit.

Speaker 4:          01:06:01       Agreed. It's such a great answer.

Speaker 9:          01:06:03       Did you see the temperature for Game Day on Sunday? Can we plant indoors? Oh, she wear outside though. How would that affect it? I mean, we'll be here. It makes sense. The headache calling New York, right? I don't think super. We'll be here. Fair enough.

Speaker 4:          01:06:21       Yeah. Good for him though. He's got a point. I mean, do you see the temperature for it? We're playing indoors. Doesn't matter. What if you weren't, I think those hypothetical's it's like what? But can you imagine if you guys weren't allowed to wear helmets on Sunday? Yeah. That would be crazy. I mean, yeah, don't bother me. The temperature doesn't matter, dude. You know what I was thinking about these athletes and they're traveling to China and even these guys would have to play foosball. I mean more time you could spend at home sleeping normally eating normal food, you know, not in a hotel room. When you can't sleep and they're disrupting their lives, they're not going to be in optimal shape. The distraction, you know, the potential for distractions is the big thing. Yeah. That's really what the worry is when you play in these games.

Speaker 4:          01:07:06       No, it's just sad it he's right. Let me stay home. I can be with my fucking family. There's a double pipe validity questions here. Okie dokie. Let's see. Hey, Hitler's today at work had a double pike classic for the first time in two years. I have a question about its validity. I had been chewing gum all day. Oh, interest heard acts as a laxative. So does it count if my body was getting a little help from a possible laxative, fuck me, piss on me and beat me. John. No, chewing gum is not a laxative. It's not. I thought he was going to say it probably contributed. Um, and he'd be correct in assuming too. Maybe that burp. No error. These, you're chewing and you're swallowing air cause somebody beat me. Um, I think it's definitely still a double pipe. I mean everybody who has one, nope, ate or drank and has some ahead of time, you know, you can't listen.

Speaker 4:          01:07:55       But he's, this person is saying that they've kind of enhanced the odds of having a double pipe in it and that's manipulating the score. I'm sorry, I don't agree with that. That's like saying I chew gum, I had a can of beans and then I drink soda and then I had a double pipe. Classic. Well yeah, because you're manipulating. Definitely still count because people eat beans and drink so it all the time and it doesn't because you're still like the air. It's not that that air is going to come out because you ate a drink. That's why you have that gas buildup. It's that they came out at the same time. If they really did BURP Fart, same time, then you had one, well let me tell him, this is not a sneeze. Take steroids and you win the race. Is that still going to be winning?

Speaker 4:          01:08:35       And I think that if the double pipe classic occurs in nature, it's natural. It happens without forcing it. You're like, no, I think it's equivalent to using steroids. What do you mean the 20 friends? Anything that you eat is going to affect your gas. So then you're saying like, okay, I had a Tacos for lunch as account. No, because you had to go. But we're talking about gaming the system, talking about purposely loading up on re fried beans and purposely drinking a lot of soda to create the effect of the double pipe. That's what I'm saying. I'm not saying you happen to have tacos and that's a different thing. I'm saying this person, this person is saying they're forcing it. They didn't say I forced, they said I had gum and then something happened. It is a rare event and you get credit. It was a double pipe classic.

Speaker 4:          01:09:22       Uh, you did it John. You did it all right. That's what you think. I, you know, potato Patato I think it should occur without interference. Do so when, when like let's say he's like, I had a coke before, does it count now? It doesn't count either. Like what, what can be hearsay? Here's what, here's what it'll count. It's fine if it's just a coke. Okay, let's just say no, no. I'll tell you why. Yes, yes, you may. You may increase the Burbage, but you're not. It's not going to affect your [inaudible]. Now, if you were, say I ate a bunch of re fried beans and dried apricot and then I loaded up on coke. You're trying to game the system and at delet pipe classic has to kind of happen organically. You cannot force it. You just can't unreal and if you do, it's cheating. I don't think that's fair.

Speaker 4:          01:10:07       I don't think that's right. I would say, what is, I'm going to go out and say this. I don't think you should be able to weigh in on this if that's your logic. I mean you're like one of those corrupt referees that's also betting on games. Okay. Now I know a lot of people have been writing about last week's. Would you rather we did. Would you rather, all the music you listened to is the song the heat is on or all the movies you watch be sister, act two and now people run back in the habit if you don't mind doing the full time. Sorry.

Speaker 4:          01:10:38       Uh, and people were like, Christina, what about when the music happens in the film? Is that the heat is on? No, those are two separate things. If you're, if you chose the only film you can watch is distract too back in the habit, you're entitled to all the tunes and all the music you will hear. It just drags you back in the habit. It's not that you'll hear the anxious all the time. Yeah. So, but, but they're saying if you chose the ages, oh, as your only music than if you're watching sister act to will you hear the h is oh, oh, that's interesting. Well then that would be, yes. Sorry, sorry. So I'm, I'm fucking flipping here. Well, let's say you choose the Hso. Every form of music you hear will be, the heat is on. So you watched sister out to as you get to watch.

Speaker 4:          01:11:23       No. But that's the thing. You get to watch whatever movie you want now, but any form of music you hear will be the heat is on. Right. So in the movie sister act too, they could be singing. Hallelujah. Jesus. But you're going to hear the heat is on because you're, the only songs you can hear are the heat is on. You don't want, I'm sorry. So you don't get to think you're confused by the question now what be initially it was if you choose one or the yes. Sorry, I'm confused if you, if you pick songs. Okay. If you pick,

Speaker 2:          01:11:50       I get to listen to any music I want. Right, right, right. And you're only movie his sister act too. Back in the habit. Okay. Yes. Then you can listen to any music you want. You only get one fellow sister act to, Oh hey, sorry. Go ahead. Quite yet. Okay. If you pick, I can listen to any music. Sorry. You're only movie his sister. Act correctly. Correct. Back in the habit. You can listen to any music you want after that, but you can never watch any TV or films. You only get to watch sister act too back in the habit and you get it. It's an in it's entirety. Okay. The way it's performed. Okay. If you pick, I don't, I'd rather have the other choice. In other words, I'd rather be able to watch any film. Right. Then you only get one song. In that case, the only music you ever hear is the ages. Oh, okay. Right. Yeah, that's, that's good. Yeah. That makes sense. Does that answer the question though? Yeah, I think so. Um, all right. Is there anything else Jean?

Speaker 4:          01:12:50       I don't think so. I mean, I got to get a deli meat scale.

Speaker 2:          01:12:54       That's right. Am I get my hands on one of those? We should just look on Amazon. See if it's possible. Look at that. We've got a ways. Our banner. Yeah.
