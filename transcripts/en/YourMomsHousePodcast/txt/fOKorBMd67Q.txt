Stand up. Stand them up Stan. I've actually had to stop using that word because I can't figure out if its stamina or making fun of it. Yeah. I was trying to make fun of it too and I thought I was saying it wrong. If it's too close, yes and no, I, I fucked it up. I have to hear him say it to know that that's wrong because now stamina sounds wrong. Like stamina, stamina. It's like when we made fun of all those words and then it gets stuck that way regardless. Library pacifically pacifically stand them up. See what standing with sales right now to me when, uh, we were looking at homes, one of the ladies that was showing us a home goes, I go to this room, be, she goes, you could use it as a library. Stand them up. I had a lot of fun in the Ma and then I even got to go have some fun on the morning. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         00:29:09       Oh it's a garage or a DJ? Dad Mouth. Aka duct tape. Duct tape. Duct tape. How'd you get that? People call me duck tape man. Cause I always have it on me. You know, like macgyver. I'll duct tape your mouth shut. I'll just, anywhere that you have a hole on you, I'll put duct tape. So I'm going to do it up tonight. I didn't realize that morning. A lot of color options. Duct tape. Is this a guy thing? Is that we just adored duct tape so much? Or what, what is the fascination with, with tape? So this is a jail thing. Really dancing. Oh please, please tell us. Warm. Just a buddy of mine, he got locked up for armed kidnapping and then he, uh, everybody had like a nickname in prison and he found some duct tape so they called him doc tape. I'm just trying to, I want to free my buddy duct tape free doctors. Free Duck tape. Free Dog. He for awhile he has, you know, it's a 20 year sentence, but the thing is there's good behavior and there's appeals and if everything goes right, I think duct tape, it'll be out in seven free dog tape.

Speaker 13:         00:30:29       Here's the thing, I feel like if you commit armed kidnapping, but it's during a drug deal that it's not like, like there was other people doing bad things anyways. They should give you a little bit of leniency on that. You know, it's not like he kidnapped a kid. He can't have a bad dude. So he essentially, it took someone off the street, they couldn't find chewy for like, I don't know, three weeks or something. So that's three weeks that she wasn't selling a cocaine. Here you go free, dark yellow. Yeah, of course. I got a dog. I put it in her purse. Stay tuned folks, because we have got to do, got a duck tape, something to follow you on Twitter at, at to grow. And I will tweet out the location of the after party and we will wreck a place. We will physically destroy this place out. Duct tape it all back to yeah and that's exactly what I do man. We tear it down and then I put it back together back together. Man. You get my home's concept.

Speaker 13:         00:31:33       Someone's never been to your show besides duct tape. What can people expect? Not like an x rated show, but it's like all rated. It's probably are rated for adults to come out and have a great time over a drink some food and enjoy your crazy thing. You're going to switch your name to scotch tape and not know duct tape. No, no, no, no. Cause I'm going to honor duct tape until he gets out. Free doc tape free or your comic mentors. Like who did you look up to as a young kid? And he's like, you know what, someday I'm going to do that. Uh, it changed, you know, like when I was like a young, young kid, I feel like it started off with a Cosby. He's got a little bit of legal trouble himself. He should get some duckies in bubble wrap and some duct tape a long time ago. No, you should not have had decayed thanks a lot for those crimes. Uh, I then I liked the TPM away from the duct tape. Not, not here. Keep Cosby away from the duck tape. It's all kinds of things going on here. There's a lot of good comedians like free duct tape, duct tape. Go ask the day.

They really let you have free reign in Iowa. Huh? They were fun. Yeah. Those two were really good time. That was. That was definitely fun. See, now I like I, oh, I changed my mind. So you have a good time there. Yeah. Does that make you not want to go on as yourself though? Yeah, I'm not sure what I would do now if I, if I were go on those terrible shows, you know? Yeah. Don't call their sheer terror. I mean really awesome, relevant hip veggie doing work, doing the Lord's work. I used to bring fif on television with me just then they, they got a real kick out of seeing the dog. But I don't know.

Speaker 7:          00:37:08       I don't know if I could do a character. Let's see. A, you want to see, oh my God. So it says, oh my God, there is late. I'm sorry you sent me this thing when you sent me a Corey Feldman. Oh fuck. Well my friend Mary Lynn texted me first thing on, I forget, maybe Friday morning, Saturday morning. And she's like, have you seen this yet? And I mean the Internet exploded with people and I feel like we don't usually touch these big important stories. Yeah. You know? But this was so weird. Like, I feel like we need to really get into it and analyze what is happening here. Yeah. Uh, cause so Corey Feldman went on the today show and he's been making music since, you know, the late eighties, early nineties. Did you know that, that he went on, um, like Howard Stern's television show and sang a song in 1992 about like the youth of today and stuff. It was so weird. No. So you know, he's a, you text that to me or did you think I texted it to the world? Yeah, I texted it to everybody. Or was that a text? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Anyways. Um, so hey, I just got a phantom tax. You know how you get them to yeah, I got one the other day too. What is your say? Mine says is, is this someone trying to reach dean? My old Stepdad. I Dunno.

Speaker 2:          00:38:41       Huh? Huh?

Speaker 7:          00:38:43       Can I finish my, oh, sorry. I got one that's the other day that says thanks. We finished 10 minutes ago. Smiley face. No, no clue. And then did you write back, how hard did you come? I should have. Why didn't I, it would have been great. I mean, I fucking miss my shots. So anyways, Corey Feldman, his mentor was Michael Jackson. We all know that it's here. Yeah. He was a celebrity kid and he hung out with Mj. By the way, did you hear that? Someone came out and finally said that Michael Jackson did sexually abuse him as a child, but because of the statute of limitations on it, they can't press any kind of charges. There's a statute of limitations I think you need limits on, I know, right? Yeah. But the guy said that he was, you know, I dunno why he didn't come out so long.

Speaker 7:          00:39:31       I imagine the shame of being molested and, and whatever the feelings. But, so the guy finally came out and said that yes. An MJ. What he would do is have his assistant reach out to these families. Yeah. And be like, Hey, do you want to come hang out at Neverland? And then he would, you know, show them the roller coasters and all the cool stuff. And the parents would hang out with Mj and he would win their trust. Kind of like, you know, oh, isn't it great? And then he would have the assistant reach out to the parents and ask if their kid could come to Neverland and spend the night. Right. And then these idiot parents would let their kids spend the night with Michael Jackson. Of course he was molesting. Doesn't it seem crazy now to think that people were like, no, he's not doing that.

Speaker 7:          00:40:17       Of course he's not. He just likes to sleep with young children. He just likes to sleep with little boys like he's just a kid at heart. No, I chose you to how people let logic go when someone's really fabulous. Well, when they really love Mike, I loved Michael Jackson. They love him because he's so talented and famous by saying, yeah, if he just was like, Oh, you're that Guy Michael. He works at the craft store hardware, sleeping with kids. He'd be like, yeah. All right, well he's going to spend the night with your children. No, no, he's not. Or you having a hard time finding this? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, do you want me to find it? Press pause for a minute. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:40:54       Right.

Speaker 7:          00:40:56       All right. We're bad. We got it. Um, oh man. Buckle up guys, if you haven't heard this, this is Corey Feldman on the today show on the today show. And by the way, you can see like even at this point, yes. The Michael Jackson influence, you know, you can see the insanity ramping up. Like you can tell that Cory's off. He's got a hood on like a dark hoodie and you can see the look in his eye isn't normal. It's not normal. It's that Michael always had like very distinct, uh, and white and black was always his thing. You know, like a, and you can see that that's, that's what he's going on coming here. I felt like the cover Angelica or

Speaker 10:         00:41:35       is him coming out of the earth wearing black and there's fire and there's angels, but it looks

Speaker 7:          00:41:42       Jorge Angels. Right. But it also looks like $2 cover art, like at the mall. Do you remember,

Speaker 10:         00:41:49       you probably weren't into this, but in the 90s when um, like that there was, there's this southern Shondra of hip hop really exploded all their cover harmony. No, that's not southern thugs. No, it looks like it looks like what? Like, um, like uh, making say, uh, like all those guys, they're covered. Ours was like tanks and like just I guy in a goal like juvenile and them and I can't even think of his name, but um,

Speaker 7:          00:42:20       wait, wait, wait. But you know what? I like it. This is like gang banger art where it's and Jelly number two, that Gore and it's got that like, yeah, handwriting font, whatever that cursive font. It looks like it was made at the mall, Dude.

Speaker 10:         00:42:35       Yeah. Here's the master p album covers. Okay. Like, yeah, here's this is, yeah, that's what I'm saying. All those looked like that back in the 90s.

Speaker 7:          00:42:45       And the angels are dressed like prostitutes. They got garter belts on. They all dress like sluts, sled angels, like the Halloween Costume version for women. This is like what all these, oh right, right. Yeah. That's a lot better. Well I, it's hard to describe but if there was a lot of fire and flame, it's like cheap shit. It's like a dude just learned, not even like whatever was before Photoshop when they were like, hey put a tank in there. But that's a fire to fire in there. It's, it's that bad. It's really fair. It's worse than that. It really is. It is garbage. But if you're, if you're debuting like a hip cool song is the today show where you do it? Well you do it when you're a pop star.

Speaker 10:         00:43:41       All those little like Katy Perry who does those pornos and like, uh, um, you know like uh yeah whatever.

Speaker 7:          00:43:47       Whoever the famous singers are Dave, they do these morning cause they know there's millions of viewers. How did he get on here? Do you think you had a publicist or somebody, obviously there's some hookup where maybe somebody saw it and they're like, do you want to see something go viral for the wrong reasons? Well that someone the book or got fired immediately. I Dunno. Maybe promoted cause think about how many views the thing, here's the thing, the music's not that shitty. Like how is that any shittier than the shitty things they play on the radio. That's just a shitty as anything else. I think it's the, it's the dancing. It's like, you know, in a six year old is like, Mommy, mommy, watch me dance. Mommy, look, look at my dance mommy. That's what he's doing. Yeah. Where it's like, look

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       at, look at my dance moves, mom, watch me dive three, dive mommy. And I was like, I'm watching, I'm watching you. Yeah. Um, I already can't do this. What's going on? I Dunno. So there we go back here. I wanted to pull up something else to show you at the same time as this was playing, um, here, maybe here I can do it, but there's cause it kind of a, it kind of made me reminded me of something else. I also like the host who's like, uh, I had a Corey Feldman poster on my wall. Like, wait, you're a dude though, unless you like dude's did you have other dudes on your wall growing up? Really? Doesn't this give you a little bit of a reminder of

Speaker 2:          00:45:16       [inaudible]?

Speaker 4:          00:45:22       It's just a Shitty, is that, yeah. I mean, which the Shittier, oh, definitely. Uh, Nick Hawk, I think they cock is the worst

Speaker 2:          00:45:30       is

Speaker 4:          00:45:31       yes. Not that's what I'm trying to say. It's not that shitty. It's not that bad. No, you just heard it. You'd be like, Eh, it's an a, it's not, I mean, I'm not going to buy this, but I'd be like, it's all right. But the absurdity is the dance and that it's him and the dancing. The dancing is outrageous. He even is rocking. What ended up being a Michael Jackson style of hair. You realize that? Yeah, but I mean Michael Jackson rock that there was a point where he had long hair. He combed it back here. We kind of pinned it back and then less some loss. It's a direct style suck. But he's like, that's my idol or whatever, you know. But very much Korey always chose late eighties MJ versus the early to mid. I always thought this was Mj is least attractive era. I like shorter heaven later.

Speaker 4:          00:46:22       This is like a lady. Yeah, mid nineties look like black or white. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah, he really, and the reason I think so many people made fun of him after this, besides how bad it is, and you can tell how sincere he isn't it. But I like that. So I know. No, I'm not faulting him for it. But when you see someone trying really hard and it doesn't go well, then they go, they come in on your heart. He probably has been just tortured since this. Well, you'd think that and you'd think that he may throw in the towel, but he hasn't. And like he's been shit on a lot.

Speaker 2:          00:46:56       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:47:00       wings, angels, they love that Shit. But he tweeted out, he's like, I guess you know, everyone's talking about us. I guess the angels and I did our job. Like he doesn't, I dunno, there's something here that says it's really not going out going well. Oh really? Cause Corey Feldman sobs, aw. While speaking out against today's show reaction were petrified to even go out. And he says it's the experience becomes something to hide. Like I think there's a video of it. It got, let's see.

Speaker 10:         00:47:30       He has not been able to get out of bed after the person. Oh No. Yeah. This is this fifth album.

Speaker 7:          00:47:38       I know. That's what I'm, that's what I'm thinking is that maybe it's time to, you know, throw in the towel here,

Speaker 10:         00:47:44       man. This is, um, Ooh.

Speaker 7:          00:47:47       Well, what's going on here? What, what do you think is, well, how does this happen? Is what I'm trying to ask you from a, an emotional, did a Facebook live posts responding to his critics? Oh, doors now infamous performance on the today show. Friday he debuted his new song, go for it, and the appearance received a bit of backlash and is now deleted posts. He said, quote, all we can say is that we tried really hard because we love our fans and we just wanted to give them the best show that we could, but we don't deserve these things that are being said about us are awful. Feldman was a popular teen actor in the 80s he started in the Goonies and the lost boys.

Speaker 10:         00:48:27       Wow. There you go.

Speaker 7:          00:48:30       You know what I think it might be because he got famous so young that it's like kind of an arrested development thing. Like he stopped developing it like six years old. Yeah. You know, and he's kind of stuck in this

Speaker 10:         00:48:43       age. Yeah. Yeah. It says, um, it is delusional though. It is delusional and I dunno, I mean, I think you know what the other thing is too is that you can almost blame the today show. Like if he had just made a video for this or something, it wouldn't, yeah. But he's on the today show. This is like part of it. Like they fucking, this is the thing where they go, oh, Rihanna has a new thing. She's going to do it on the today show. And they put him in that series. Wow. That's really weird of them to do that. You know, he said it's been really painful. I don't, sorry if it's not good enough for you, but you don't have to beat us up. Well look at us participating in the beating up. Well, yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:49:25       It was just such a shock. It really was like such a weird thing for me. Yeah. It was just like, what do you, I don't know man. What's happening?

Speaker 10:         00:49:33       Yeah. No, it's really bad. This is really bad. Yeah. Um, the dancing is really good. We see more dance moves. So I liked the dancing. Yeah. He's doing his, uh, his, his little, yeah. I got to play the song. Oh, okay. I thought you wanted to mute it to not to not shit on him for Oh, there if you were trying to dance like Michael Jackson. Yeah. And they would teach you in stages, you know, like, well, let's first do this. He's doing like stage two, right of, of learning how to do it right now they're light, right. They're clearly amateur. Michael, like entry level moves. Yeah. He's like, he loves Michael Jackson. He can't do Michael Jackson moves. Yeah. So he's doing, you know, little things that our dance class, yeah. It's like he's, you could see the little moves. He just, all the stuff and Michael Jackson did. Thank you.

Speaker 7:          00:50:25       That's totally MBA stuff. Yeah. All of the

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       foot. Yeah. But he does it like a six year old. Right, right. And that's not a doing Michael Jackson. That's not good. Wow. That's so interesting. I don't want the guy to kill himself or anything, so no, it is just give up music, hang out, just give up your dreams. No, that's terrible. It must be hard to have this desire in you so much. Like I want to be a singer so bad, but you're really terrible at it. Yeah. And you just keep failing and failing, but then you, you listened to the secret or you listen to Tony Robbins and they're like, keep going no matter what. And he was like, yeah, I'm going to keep going. Maybe not throwing the towel, you know, um, moving right along. Yeah. Can I ask you your advice on something or can I pick your brain on something? Yeah. So on a Friday I had lunch with a friend and I had a kale salad with salmon and then I had violent diarrhea for like the next day I just had really hot, sour diarrhea. Are you listening to me anyways? Here's what I noticed happening.

Speaker 4:          00:51:43       Are you paying attention? You have to pay attention to me. Look at me when I'm talking to him, please. I was pooping and it was really hot and it burned a lot and I noticed that every time I'm done making diarrhea, I have to pee. It's lot a lot like the yellow, brown, yellow phenomenon, but this time, every time they have diarrhea, I have to pee afterwards. Okay, but why? I mean, I dunno. I think your body's just getting rid of everything. How has that weird? I don't understand. It's weird because when I sit down to Brown, I make pee all the time. Like I already pee before Brown, so I'm empty, but then why would I make the area? There's always a yellow there. I'm sure it's really good question. I'm going to call a doctor or something. I do. You don't have that. Maybe that's just a girl thing. I think maybe you're right. I think maybe you're just so focused on when you have diarrhea, it's more like your brain's like, oh shit, this is real, you know, not normal. Then maybe you hold your pee a little bit and then when you brown that out you relax more and your body goes, No, let the pee out too.

Speaker 4:          00:53:00       I feel like it's something to do with heat. Your body losing he or something. This is a really interesting, this is the thing, you're like, hey, let me bring this up. They didn't want to tell me earlier. You're like, I got something I got to talk about. That's it. That's really good. That's really good. But I'm serious. You're not taking it serious. I'm taking it really seriously. It's maybe it's your loss of body heat and then like the peak gets made. Yeah. Um, Oh, you know what? Uh, it may be that, isn't it? It's really interesting and I think we should explore it more. Maybe some other time. Um, but I don't think it's heat leaving your body. I feel like my body heat leaves when you have diarrhea, you know? Can I tell you the worst thing you've ever done? Yeah, I wrote it down. Okay. You called me the other day as you were eating veggie chips from the trader's Joe. Yeah. On speaker phone. Yeah, that was terrible fly. Just horrible. I was hungry. I hated it. The why. What was terrible? I Dunno. What was terrible? The sounds the sounds. Yeah. That sounds where you were on speaker phone. So how could you even hear it so much here at amplified? What do you mean? How could I hear it? It was amplified. It sounds like you got really mad.

Speaker 3:          00:54:13       Yeah. So

Speaker 4:          00:54:17       it sounded like on speaker phone it was so terrible. I didn't have the stand up to, to naughty. I'll tell you, say it correctly. You mean stamina, stamina, stamina, fan of that. The right way to say it. Stamina, stamina, stamina. Sounds wrong now. Salmon. That does sound round. Yeah. Fuck Stamina. Stan [inaudible] Fatima, you know what you did Dan ma CNA. It sounds bad when Steven says it. Yeah. You did something gross this week to uh, we were hanging out with the dogs and you were sitting on this chair and the in our bedroom and you called bitsy over. Yeah. And I knew it was coming cause I saw you pose for it. [inaudible] you farted on Betsey's head but your legs were spread open. Here's kind of suggest that I sat on, here's how it was. I was sitting in a chair with my legs open. Right. And then she put her paws up like to come up.

Speaker 4:          00:55:19       Right. So she's, she's standing on the ground. Her paws are on the hair and her face is basically in my open crotch. Yeah. And I felt like I was like, this is going to be a good one, you know? And what did she do? She might like, it was like I was awesome. Where's that from? That was great. Yeah. Cause bitsy loves the farts and then faith does, faith doesn't like the smell of fire. If you fart in your feed, he gets up and walks away. Doesn't like farts. Fevers. So into self preservation. He knows like when the baby is going to pull his hair, he just takes off. Busy doesn't get it. Nope. He didn't even tell exactly what causes that counterpart Bitsy, uh, had her beard pulled yesterday by Ellis. Yeah. So hard that she cried. Oh, her ear on her ear. She hasn't learned yet. Those Fif sees that baby. He's like, I'm out and never going to get my hair pulled. So you farted and Betsey's face your face. Yeah. And it was neat because I got to witness and I saw the ramp up. I knew what you're going to do. Yeah. And I was like a

Speaker 7:          00:56:24       read just totally degraded now and to just being frat boys with each other. Like do you not want to be romantically associated with? Absolutely. Of course I did. It was just such a good opportunity. I didn't know how to pass it up. And you had on boxers too. So there was only one layer separating bitsy from that fart.

Speaker 10:         00:56:43       And if I could, if I could explain a little more. I had a, a meaty kind of rich lunch and then I came home and I made fitness. Oh. So they were extra like, you know, I dunno. They were extra cooked up in right there where the system was going. Yeah. So I had felt a few like really good ones leading up to the, I knew it was going to be good. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:57:06       You knew it. You felt it in your heart? Yeah. Now how have your bowel movements been lately? You haven't, I heard it this morning. It didn't sound good. Did that was, that one wasn't great. But aside from that one, I didn't know you heard that one. I can always hear, oh, that one wasn't good walls for say hearing. It wasn't very nice. But aside from that, it's been really good. Your Diet's been better. And when is your colonoscopy?

Speaker 10:         00:57:36       It's in a next month. It's an October. I think I'm gonna have to have a good day. I'm traveling on the date it was scheduled.

Speaker 7:          00:57:45       You got to do it, but it's cleaned up since you've changed your diet a bit. I know you haven't been eating fried foods or many carbohydrates, so that's an interesting thing to note and no sugar. Yeah. Except yeah, to this morning it kind of went stop what you think. Except except for this morning the Brown sounded really explosive. Yeah, I think

Speaker 10:         00:58:06       it was, um, you know, just like that early morning, you know, food made a, I was on an empty stomach. When you eat on an empty stomach and it has any richness to it, you know, still happen.

Speaker 7:          00:58:18       Yeah. It was interesting. I went to silver lake, uh, to have lunch with a friend and it was like taking a tour of all the restaurants from my past and I got diarrhea from. Yeah. It's, it's interesting how many places on the east side. I, I used to get diarrhea from. Where did you end up eating any more? Good Little Dom's. It used to be a French place. Uh, I can't remember the name of it. Love who bell? No, no, us on what street? It's on a Hillhurst and you know, our Mexico City, that restaurant is, I've got diarrhea. There are so many times Mexico City mixed Mexico gives me diarrhea every time I would. And I still eat there. I've got Mama. You guys, don't you miss that? You guys would give me a lot of farts. But that's my absolute favorite Mexican place and all of Los Angeles.

Speaker 7:          00:59:03       As you guys in La, in Los Angeles. But that is the best. Yeah. That is a little stand. It's a, it's a stand in a parking lot and a bearded Mexican lady takes your order and writes it on a bag and you eat in a filthy parking lot. Yeah. And like birds take shits next to you and it's the best mood. She's a big lady. She's Harry too. Yeah. Makes good tacos. It doesn't really make him, but she sets out, she sits down and takes, or it's her recipes, I think. Yeah. But it was like a tour of everywhere I gotten sick. Cafe Stella. I remember we took Maria there years ago. Yeah. And she got diarrhea in the bathroom as we were eating their players. Blair's give me diarrhea. Really? They did the collywobbles. Oh yeah. I really liked them, but the, that made me sick every time. A lot of risks.

Speaker 10:         00:59:50       Food is just really rich to come with a lot of butter and restaurants. So can we talk about the why Goo? Oh my God. Get your life.

Speaker 1:          00:59:58       Oh my God.

Speaker 10:         01:00:00       I know. It was really good. Best thing I've ever had. Me Too. It's like buttery. There's American Wagyu and there's Japanese Wagyu and the Japanese stuff is like eating a stick of butter. Yeah. There they purposely encourage you to get small portion of it

Speaker 7:          01:00:18       cause they know how. How rich don't need a huge one of that. Oh my God.

Speaker 10:         01:00:24       Like every bite. Just

Speaker 7:          01:00:27       how do they get it? So they do, they force feed it like Kobe probably like beer, feed it and massage the calf or whatever. Is it a cat

Speaker 10:         01:00:35       fatty? I Dunno. I don't even know. It's delicious though.

Speaker 7:          01:00:39       Yeah. That was real. A special treat that we, we, we went out, we don't really go out to eat that much anymore. I used to love to do that. I said all the time before baby jeans. Yeah. But you know the kid sleeps at seven and by then we're just so tired. All we can do is watch, you know, an episode of flipping out on Bravo TV and then I fall asleep by nine.

Speaker 10:         01:00:58       I go to bed even much earlier now. I went to bed at 11 last night. Oh Wow. He used to be up every night one too.

Speaker 7:          01:01:04       No. And if you left town I'd be like backpack. No, five 30. Ah, yeah, you were a real night owl now too tired. I'm exhausted. Every damn exhausted to the bone. You had your beard trimmed. Hmm.

Speaker 10:         01:01:27       You can see it if you're watching. It's much shorter. Um, and it was cut a week ago. So you can imagine, dude, I, I had to get it. So here's the thing, your beard starts to get really thick. You don't just throw the trimmer on it, right? Because your hair starts to grow on your face. Like it went on your head. Meaning that it's better to have a professional trim it because when you're talking about long bushy hair than it's growing in different directions and different lengths. So, but when you have a pro do it, you know, they'll comb it like you, they would your head and have and shape it like you would your hair. So my guy is awesome. He's the best and he's added town last week and it's getting my, my beard is getting like to a degree of mountain man that I can't even, you know what I mean?

Speaker 10:         01:02:17       Like it's Farrell, it's too, so I go, can you recommend me somebody? And he goes, yeah. And He sends me this dude, good guy, pro guy obviously. And I just don't give them any, it's my fault. I don't give him any heads up. Like he just goes, oh, what's going on? I go, oh, this thing's out of control and a, I don't want to just throw the clippers on it. And he's like, Nah, you need, you need someone to shape that for you. I go, yeah, he doesn't ask me much more on. He's like, all right. And he starts doing all this stuff that I'm used to this guy doing, you know, combing it, clipping it with clippers, like, or with scissors, like you would head hair. And then I go, yeah, down here, I don't know about, you know, pulling it up something. He goes, Oh yeah, you don't want a line. I just kind of blended in and I go, okay, he throws his clippers on like when you hear the one, I'm like, yeah. And then he just goes and clips it all off and I was like, uh,

Speaker 7:          01:03:11       and you can see it go down. Right? Like, you know when they're fucking you. Yeah. Like you know it's happening, but you're like hoping against hope. Maybe this guy knows what he's doing yet. Maybe I should just hang back a little and not panic. And after like, um,

Speaker 10:         01:03:25       uh, something really dramatic, you know, you can't go, oh right. It's too late to like, let's just see where it goes. Yeah. It just keeps going and going. And I'm like, oh my God. And to make it even worse, I even go like, Oh wow, this is really different

Speaker 7:          01:03:41       and what I'm used to. And he's like, Oh yeah, yeah. It just, it turns almost the whole thing off and you have to act like you do. Love it. Thank you. Wow. Yeah. It goes different, but it's fun to see different looks. It is fun. Well, you came home and I was like, well, it's like when you had those replacement teeth. Oh my God. That was the worst dude you got. Fuck. Like he fucked your beard so bad. It's a little better now. It's way better. It's grown a week. Yeah. I mean your, your beard grow so fast. Thankfully that it wasn't too long looking like a dick. But Dude, that guy jacked you. Yeah. We got to yell at Allen. Allen sent you there. No, we don't need to yell at him though because like I said,

Speaker 10:         01:04:27       I could have, when he said how's it going or what's going on, and I was telling him I could have said the normal thing, which is, you know, it's way too big. I want to bring it down some.

Speaker 7:          01:04:38       Yeah. This is what you should say to a new person. He doesn't know me at all. I should have given him some direct. Explicit. Yeah. I was just like, yeah, it's long. And he just went at it and he was like, let me let me fuck your shit up. You want to look stupid? I was like, you look stupid. God, why stood up? I was like, man, this looks like shit and that doors and then you can't really, you can't express your sadness cause like you just, you just know you're never going to go back there. Yeah, of course. It's a loss. It's a wash.

Speaker 10:         01:05:06       Talk about it. You're like, hmm, maybe we should just cut the whole thing off right now. I considered it for a moment and I was like, well there's still some there so it's probably better to not trim more. In other words, it'll catch up

Speaker 7:          01:05:19       ELAC quicker. It grows so fast on you. Yeah. Yeah. I, you know, I went to my regular misuse and uh, she's like, do you want to try Reiki? And I'm like, yeah, I asked her, I go, does it feel nice? She goes, yeah, some people think, think it feels nice. You know, I wanted a massage. Really. I didn't want to try Reiki but, but I kind of roll with it. Yeah. Anyway, I absolutely hated it cause it's like one of those things where they just touch you, they touch your shock rose or whatever the fuck. And I fell asleep. I went through phases of sleep, anger, rage, like stop fucking touching me, like just fucking rubbed me like, let's go. Yeah. And I really like her and you know, we, we just decided to try something different, so I had to pretend like I really enjoyed the Reiki. Like she goes, did you love it? I go, yeah. Thank you. Oh, I loved it. Yeah. What a neat experience is that thing too? It's like just being right, right? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:06:16       I had that once in a hotel where I call the spa going to deep tissue and then I get in the room and it's like this frail older lady and I'm like, so you do deep tissue, Huh? And she's like, that's not really what I do. That's what I booked. She's like, wait til you experience what I do. Like just touching your like tickling. Yeah. Gentle touching. And I was like, ah, my seven year old girls do to, what do you think? I'm like that I think I like it more fresher.

Speaker 7:          01:06:44       Well, sure. Yeah. Well I know, and she goes, uh, so I see her later. The reiki lady. I saw her like a couple of weeks later and she's like, so how did you, how did you feel a breakthrough? Did you have any weird dreams? I was like, Oh yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:07:07       Oh, it was so good.

Speaker 7:          01:07:09       So weird. Thanks. Hi. I can't even tell you because she goes, you're going to have a spiritual enema. I'm getting, this is like a spiritual I and I was and I thought, well that's two things I love. Yeah. I like spirituality and I like shinning, so. Yep. I'm on board. You thought you were ready to go? I thought I was in for a treat. That is your wheel house. Oh, I know. Yeah. And then I got, I got real disappointed. I got real angry. Yeah. Angry you if you try Reiki. No, I don't want to. I know. I don't like it. Go ballistic. It's so horrible. I don't like any of that life. Oh. I always like whatever strength you have, give it to me. All of it. She literally just touched my, yeah. For like 15 minutes and then I'm going to, she touched my heart in my chest Chakra. Just touched it. And then I'm going to, and I was like, ah, fuck. I wanted to river. And I do like being kicked in the morning. I'd rather get kicked in the balls into Reiki again. Yeah. Fuck that was

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       and raging. Yeah. And it went on for so long. It was a full hour of just soft touches that for an hour I Dude, oh, that's terrible. That's terrible. It's too long. If I want to take a nap, I could have stayed home. I made a nap. And your and your table man. Shit. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? We have some, you know what I'm saying? Is here, I think it's, you knows, it's Lorens Larkin. Let's see,

Speaker 14:         01:08:43       he's a free agent. What statement do you think you made tonight with this performance? Um, you know, I think I made a pretty big statement. You know, I'm not even ranked, so I couldn't tell you if even if there was ranking from one 15, I can tell you where I was at. So I think it just shows a lot. You know, I took the fight on short notice and, uh, you know, I've, I finished them and then in the first round, you know, and, um, I don't feel like it was a lucky shot. And you know, I think it was just right from the get go. You know, it's sticking to the game plan, lot of, you know, where I was out of division,

Speaker 4:          01:09:20       you know.

Speaker 14:         01:09:21       Yeah. You know, it's not like I don't, you know, I see stuff on the, on the media and the Internet, you know, and comments, you know, when, when UFC post stuff and bypass was posting stuff. And I see the comments of fans like, you know, who is this guy? Who is he?

Speaker 4:          01:09:38       Um, and you're a big, big proponent of separating, you knows, you know, what I'm saying is you feel me, I'm talking about, so this guy would be in his own, you know, category Lorens Larkin. Let's see, a super cut of all his,

Speaker 14:         01:09:54       um, you know, you know, we know that, you know, you know, I mean, you know, you know, you know, and you know, you know, I'm not known, you know, and you know, you know that, you know, you know well, you know, you know, you know. Yeah. You know, when you know, you know, uh, you know, you know, but you know what I'm, you know,

Speaker 4:          01:10:20       I'm partial to, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. I like, you know, so, but uh, to me it's really, it's this, the special thing is, hey, you know what I'm saying? Cause it started that way with us. We we liked, you know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? Yes. I'm talking, you feel me? I'm saying try fact that you feel me. You know,

Speaker 15:         01:11:03       it's

And my dad goes, you know, uh, pretty soon you're going to have to start hitting him. I go, well, he's like, well, yeah. I mean, you know it. He's going to get a little older and they get a little out of line. You sometimes you just got to hit a kid. That's what they tell you. It's good. He goes, Doctor Tony Grant used to say this, you have to hit the kid. Why? I was like, oh thanks. I don't even hit, I don't hit anybody in my life.

They spent my mom me a few times and like her third time she, I laughed and she was like, whatever. Yeah. That's always the key to getting hit as a kid. If you start laughing, then the power's gone.

Oh yeah, yeah, let's see it. It's called Mama clean.

Speaker 8:          01:23:40       I've tried over a thousand ways to make my life manageable and quite frankly, I maxed out exercise to me has always been a priority, but it was always at the expensive of dirty, gooey kitchen or hundreds of Aaron's left undone. And I finally, I got so fed up that I worked out a quirky slightly off the wall that'll system where I can get it all done at once.

Speaker 4:          01:24:08       Okay. She does like homemade.

Speaker 8:          01:24:10       The Clean Mamak program is an element of three days. Kind of like a triangle. On one side of the triangle you're going to have your multitasking exercises that I'm going to show you. And how to really maximize on the other side of the triangle. You're going to have your diet.

Speaker 8:          01:24:36       a, which I suggest you do at least three times a week. It's creating your own personal boot camp style and just really knock it out.
