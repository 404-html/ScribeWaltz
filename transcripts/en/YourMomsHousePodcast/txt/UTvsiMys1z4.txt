What's the difference from between the old one? Well, it's about 45 yards away from the old one. Yeah. And it's bigger. It's much bigger. And the old capacity was like three 75 and this one's five 50. [inaudible] that's like a theater. Yeah, it's a, it's basically a small theater, but crowds were amazing. Uh, it's, you know, I've, I've said this in a pose that I've said it before to people. There's nothing like the, like the physical space that you're comfortable with as a comic or performer. The Old Breyer is the first club I ever Mc to weekend at first club I ever featured a weekend at. And the first night I ever headlined headline, all three first night you ever headlined got road head broadhead?

Speaker 1:          00:04:58       Yeah. That's cool. I met her. And that's your, your home. I forgot that I did for, I forgot that. Yeah, you were, you were out and bring out a lot in the early two thousands when and then started even like, so then I worked a lot of weekends there and then I had a monthly show for a while. Um, [inaudible] gave me Tuesday nights and I would comp the shit out of it. I mean, it would be like a free show, but the crowds are always great to me. Embryo. I just always had a good time. So I always, I've always loved going to break it to do those weekends. And it was awesome. It was really, it was my first time doing an hour in two months. Is that right? Oh yeah. I, I know, I'm just writing mine that went away. And then, um, yeah, so I haven't understand that since I filmed the Netflix thing. I know this is my, my first set back in, back in business here on a Thursday at the store. It's been over two months. Dude. It's a long time. It's crazy. It is a longer one. Anytime. So Lazy. Right? Yeah. You're fucking crybaby

Speaker 3:          00:06:00       now. Were there a lot of mommies in breath? A lot. Yeah. He saw, he knew their mommy's cause of their shirts.

Speaker 1:          00:06:07       They out that I had a Josh powder came with me, who's great. And uh, in his introduction he would always say, you don't from your mom's house pocket. And they go nuts. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, there's definitely a strong, strong motherhood.

Speaker 3:          00:06:23       The strong mommy's down there. That's good. That's fun. That's fantastic. Yeah. Um, well look, I'm glad you're, I'm glad to have you home. I like it when you sleep in bed next to me, even though now you're onto a brand new serial killer show.

Speaker 1:          00:06:36       I am a killer and I've been talking telling people about it online. You have to, you're also right.

Speaker 3:          00:06:42       Big Fan. Not at all. Not at all. Not at all. He did something

Speaker 1:          00:06:46       never seen you do. If you guys don't know this is a new Netflix series that um, what it does is it features people on death row, uh, who have murdered or you know, in this, in the one case, in, in the second episode, it's a guy who was present with some, you know what I mean? You know, a lot of states if they are like, like if I drive and you kill someone and then we drive away, I get charged too. So there's a guy like that. But in the first episode, which you were exposed to, you sat on the bed and stared down and that was like, can you believe that? And you were like, I'm not listening and I'm not looking.

Speaker 3:          00:07:24       I don't want this to permeate my mind. I don't know. And I, and I say this like with like, I try to be open minded because I want us to be able to share things in common, but it's so depressing. Just the tone and then hearing like how, how clearly they, these people came from bad, the first one backgrounds and the Robertson depressing. Oh my God, his life is such a day. And by the way, happy you are discussing. I mean look at the smile on your face. I mean there's the funny parts are funny. I'll give them that, but the parts are definitely very sad. You were also exposed to how bad he looks. Holy Shit. That guy looks like uncle fester on the poster. He

Speaker 1:          00:08:11       also looks like in return of the Jedi when Darth Vader's mass comes off and you see the ground. Yeah. And like the dark circles and he's like Warren and you see like just a sad broken look like a sick man. What's weird is it says in the first episode, um, you know, they featured him in the, in the interview and then the state of Florida let, let him be interviewed 65 days later. So they do a followup interview. He looks so much better. Like the black circles are gone. They let them go to club med for a week. I don't know what happened, but that guy's life story when you really, really think about it. Yeah, it is horrific. Well my favorite is, I think he goes, I had a normal and I was like,

Speaker 3:          00:08:55       I don't think you did just before he turned 17 I don't think he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Okay. So just a normal level

Speaker 1:          00:09:02       bringing in Florida prison for more than 37 years. Jesus. And he's only like fucking like 50 or something, you know, or yeah, it's pretty bad.

Speaker 3:          00:09:14       And that, and what part makes you laugh the hardest? He has a couple, he has a couple of funny, funny beats. Like when he goes, he talks about he killed his cellmate and then he's like, I wish I had access to a soundboard now. So I could play the psycho.

Speaker 1:          00:09:29       Wait, wait, wait, wait. Like as we're talking, he goes, I killed the soundboard and the next studio. Sure, sure. He goes, I killed my, my cellmate. And then he looks at the interviewer and he's like, he goes, I don't feel bad about it. And he goes, and he lasts like that. He goes, I know. You're like, oh, this guy's crazy. It's pretty funny. And then they interviewed a former former cellmate, obviously the one that he killed and the guy goes, he likes sits down. And you could tell by the way, by the weight it's set up by the dialog that the guy who's featured the killer of the death row guy told the producers, oh, you should interview this guy. Like it's implied. Right, right. And he goes, I don't know why he told you, interview me. I'm not as Frat guys. A piece of shit. That's funny. That was funny. And he talks about like how big of a piece of shit he is. He's like, okay, I don't respect him at all. He's like, he is a fucking pariah. He just, yeah, he just will go after anybody. He thinks he can get away with it on and he's like, he's a horrible person.

Speaker 3:          00:10:32       It's to, it's terrible. And even just the sounds of the show, cause like you said, I didn't look at the screen. I just look down the whole time. Yeah. The sounds of the show. The general tone, the Beige Ness, no js definitely like depressing. And then comedy, like it goes back and forth. Sure. But sure. There's some sad parts. I just can't, I can't watch stuff where I just know that there's suffering. There's too much suffering for me. I don't like white bummer shit. This is, this is another caveat. There's like a white bummer tangent. You, you know what I mean? Yeah. Crime shows kids with cancer, people falling. I was hoping, I mean, I'm, I'm not

Speaker 1:          00:11:05       series yet. I haven't, I'm hoping for, uh, a little more psycho detached like crazy person. Yeah. A little less. Oh my life. You know, it was real sad. And this is this a thing I'm hoping more funny and less.

Speaker 3:          00:11:21       It's coming up. Yeah. Yeah. And did you watch this? While I was falling asleep last night too. I did. I started episode two. Okay. Which uh, thank you for doing that so that it leaks into my unconscious mind as I sleep. Yeah. That one was, that one was pretty sad too. I'm hoping it gets funnier, but it's, well, I got to fall asleep to the sweet sounds of a El Chapo that I'm Spanish. I got to hear a cobbler

Speaker 1:          00:11:49       where I recognize one of the, so there's only El Chapo, a Mexican series that I think there's, I don't know how many seasons of it or on Netflix. And I started it. And here's the thing, you always roll the dice with these, especially with these Latin American productions. Why is that? Well, I mean the, the shows that we get to see on like, you know, the soaps and stuff and like, like Mexican or mango and sat and land. It's horrible. It's so bad. And so I go, is this going to be like a Hokey cheesy show? Like I didn't know if it's going to be good or really goofy and shitty and it's actually really good. You know, it's a, it's basically the narcos story, but of Chapo and yeah, the actors are great. The production values is great. They have a couple American English speaking actors in small parts on it, and I swear one of them, uh, looks so familiar to me.

Speaker 1:          00:12:49       I think he was in my [inaudible] class. I got gotta look it up. I'll look it up. But uh, sounded really peaceful and nice too. It's another fun thing to fall asleep to. Thank you for that. Um, yeah, so that's, that show has done, has done very well. I guess they're, they're looking at a possibly doing a season four right now. Hmm. It is. It's him. Yeah. Yeah. I know this dude. Yup. Wow. Yeah. Holy Shit. I gotta reach out to him. So his name is Dave. Oh, hello. Nice. Yeah. Good for Dave working. Dave's doing it, man. Sullen, dude. Is he doing like all fucking Mexican stuff? That's cool, dude. You should, uh, you should apply for these jobs. You can speak Mexican fluently. Thank you. That's all I hear. I mean, she got wrong. Maybe he moved to align to align. Maybe he moved.

Speaker 1:          00:13:45       Oh, I don't want you to move to Mexico to work. Do a do a line from Chapo. Come on. Pretend you're in it. I latching Galloway. Yeah. Gene gunk. All the Mexican slang makes me, let's Chin gone. It's just fucking Mexican Mexican slang. Fuck and fuck it are like, yeah. Yeah. I like, I like how that sounds. That's what I grew up listening to. I as somebody who knows Dave, Holler at me, man. Dave. Oh, hello. Okay. Now we used to hang out all the time. Yeah. David's cool dude. Well, she took my first headshots.

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       me in Mexico. In Espanol. Yeah. Say Hablo Espanol bloat a spine. Yo. I like when your dad speaks Spanish. He's really fluent. You know Tami, when you were a little boy used to say Cargill make daddy cargomatic courier, you'd say Gargan May. I think your dad speaks Spanish. The worst of anybody. I knew that if they hired him the worst in the Spanish speaking, so it'd be the best. He just walks in the room. He's like, can I come back? And they're like, we're not going to carry you Sir Kerrick. Me. That's all he knows. And now we have the new version of that, which is our son going, I hold you and how old you are. So cute. Can you please, can we please pull up this Instagram thing I'm talking about when a mute it because I don't want it to get taken down. Oh right.

Speaker 3:          00:15:42       Yeah. Okay. It's a visual thing. So if you guys are watching on Youtube, you're blessed with what we're about to show you. If you're not, if you're just listening, I will describe to you what it is we're seeing. Cause it's so ridiculous. So I follow Elizabeth Gilbert, she's the writer who did eat, pray love. Um, basically it's based on, you know, the book where uh, she splits with her husband and then she falls in love with another man there together for 14 years. And recently in the last few years she hooked up with her best female friend and is like, oh, I'm a lesbian now. Now the horrible part of this is that the female friend she's been friends with forever has just passed away of cancer. And so she, Kendall, they came together just as this woman was diagnosed with cancer and so she had to watch her mate essentially die and be ravaged by this horrible thing.

Speaker 3:          00:16:34       Now that being said, I still find a way to make fun of her and on her Instagram she posted this thing, um, that grief is a full body experience. Can you please push play on this? And I want everyone to watch this. It's so embarrassing. And so she's doing like, this is her, this is her friend. No, this is her and this Elizabeth Gilbert. No baby. You have to read the caption. Oh, it looks like her answers. My beloved friend, Oh, was rye as ex wife Elizabeth. Yeah. Anyways, so there's this woman doing this interpretive dance of grief in her, in her kitchen and, oh, it's so embarrassing. Like if you're watching it, and I keep like, I keep, I get it that this is like, I have empathy and this is sympathy and whatever, and this is real for this person. I like, oh, so embarrassed when I see it. You should be embarrassed. It's embarrassing. So embarrassing. Totally embarrassing. And she's doing like, ah, it's, it just looks like, you know what it looks like. It looks like when a white person goes to Jamaica. Yeah. Or Ghana

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       or something. And then they see locals dance and then they're like, I learned this and you're like, please stop doing that. It's the African anteater dance. And she, it's so sad. It's so earnest and sincere and it's only because I don't have the connection to my emotions to do something like this. Of course, I'm so disconnected. I could never do this. I mean, of course this is probably, they're probably better people. So much better. Yeah. Well, I sent this to me, I'd rather not be a good person. Then I sent this to a comedian friend of mine and she's like, oh my gosh. I was crying and I was like, really? I was crying laughing at this shit. This is ridiculous. I'm like, I must have no soul because I mean I get like, I get that you feel this way, but then isn't there a level of like, don't why?

Speaker 1:          00:18:40       Why do you have to share it? She says, we dance because it hurts too much. Not Too. We dance because we are so grateful to this love. Oh my God, I'm so embarrassed by it. And then she says, don't let this out of you cause grief. It was settled in your bones and make you sync with pain so you can grieve. You can grief move through you. You can help grieve, move through you with music and with dance. But do I have to do this? I hope not. If you did this over some grief, I mean I just want you to know that I would openly mock you. Also, I do pilates twice a week. Does that count as movement that just keep it there and don't post it online? Why do white ladies feel like they have to share all their feelings? Well, it's only a certain lane of white lady who I happened to find the least attractive of all white ladies.

Speaker 1:          00:19:38       Really? Like why fucking white ladies have to share their fucking let me guess. They went to all women's college. This kind of shits encouraged multiple degrees. I get it. [inaudible] studies major. I know the worst. Literally the worst cause my least favorite person to be. Of course I'm related to a ton of them. Well look, it's not that I don't, I believe in all that stuff and I behind it intellectually. I just don't want to hear about it. I don't want to like get on. I just want to be bombarded by all the time and I'm sorry her friend died or I mean that's sad. That's what I'm saying that I can't help but make fun of people who express their feelings. But that's your job. Don't you understand that you shouldn't feel badly about it. It's your job to mock people who are sincere and earnest.

Speaker 1:          00:20:30       That's the world needs balance. The world needs balance in the world needs people like her. It's who are sincere and in touch with their suite, and she will inspire people to take that sincerely. Yeah. But because there's balance in the universe, the world also has people like us shitheads. Yeah. Who will point and laugh and mock and you know what? People enjoy us for that. Some people would get upset and truthfully, maybe one day, many years down the line will go, you know, I used to laugh at that and now I don't, and that'll be a different time in our life, but for right now, our job is to mock this person for grieving like an asshole.

Speaker 3:          00:21:18       Other people's sincerity is my hilarity. That's the fuel that I live on. You. I'm such a Dick. Yeah. You don't know that you're a big asphalt. No. I mean, sometimes I, I'm aware of it. I'm like, God, I love being a professional asshole. It's great. But then I'm like, how does that, is that the line here? Or like, I'm not like that woman's grieving and she's like, I'm doing an interpretive dance on my grief. I mean, like the truth is to like, I don't agree with, that's how you agree. Personally. I've grieved that I didn't do that thing alone. Crying hard. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:52       Feel kind of sick. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:21:55       Drink a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:21:57       Stay in a dark room and kind of sit in your depression. Yeah, but not, not this Ernest shit, this dance thing. I'd be like, fuck you, I want to punch something. So if I got like this, you don't think you can handle it? No, absolutely not. Absolutely not. No Way. If you were doing that for real to grieve, I would just be like, look, you know, of course do it. Like I don't want to be anywhere around it. Please keep it in another room. Do it upstairs. Yeah. I tell you to come in here. I go stay in the studio. I'll be somewhere else.

Speaker 3:          00:22:31       And I also think that this lends itself, cause right now we're in an era of nonstop sharing. Uh, the earnest shares, you know, you see them on Facebook, the oversee the medical over shares. Like, uh, my mom's a festering wound on her foot's getting better guys. And you're like, I don't want to know any of the stuff about you. Um, but there's definitely now a blurred line between public and private. You know, like there's, there's very little delineation nowadays between what's public and what's private. Like you and I had been seeing people taking phone calls on speakerphone, right. Like we were in the, in a nice restaurant and this guy, this dad has a speaker phone, he is a speaker. It's on speaker phone and then he puts it up to his

Speaker 1:          00:23:16       yeah. And The lady goes on a, a full, you know, dynamic tires are, yeah. Yeah. And then he's like, well, I gotta I'm going to have a lunch now. And then you use here as well, Rah Rah Rah Rah at full volume full. And he's holding it here. Yeah, he's holding it up. I don't think. Maybe he didn't even know he was on speaker phone and he's, he was old. He was old. He was, he, he should know better. He's gotta be dead now. That was like five, six days ago.

Speaker 3:          00:23:48       And then remember that guy in Starbucks who did like a health insurance call or something you said? He was like,

Speaker 1:          00:23:54       he was on the phone with, oh my God. You recorded him. I did. I know I got to, he was on the phone, I want to say with Bank of America. Oh,

Speaker 3:          00:24:05       and what should be a private call because you're talking about your finances deco, obnoxious and rude fucking shit. Bird. What is wrong with people? Yeah. Oh nope, that's not it. Um, another thing I've been seeing are people wearing how slippers in public spaces as well. Like I'm talking like Fuzzy Pink House slippers to get on an airplane. I side at Burbank airport. Like, look, I'm not opposed to seeing people's feet. That's not the problem. I don't care. But you're not supposed to wear fuzzy slippers to like the mall, the grocery store airplanes. It's completely inappropriate. It's just not footwear that's meant to be outdoors. Dangerous actually. Cause it's too flimsy. A shoe.

Speaker 1:          00:24:51       Yeah. It's silly.

Speaker 3:          00:24:55       It's not, it's not, it's inappropriate. I don't know what the fuck is happening that people think the world is their living room. It's obnoxious. Yeah. I mean you used to, people used to have shame about that kind of stuff. He tried to keep your conversations private or worse. Some people listen to their music or watch videos at full volume. You're like, dude, nobody wants to hear your bullshit. No, of course. And I'm very cognizant of that too, cause we have a sign in some, you know, if we take him out in public, like we always like Shh, quiet, don't yell. You know, via, if we're showing them video as well. He has, you know, he's eating so that he focuses in minute. We make sure that the volumes down so that we're not disturbing other people. Right. Of course. Yeah. It's just so silly. People are so horrible. Why don't you, why are you trying to find this audio? Trying to press pause so you can look for it.

Speaker 1:          00:25:45       Yeah. One second. Okay. I, I was able to pull this missy, if I can make it actually play here. This is, I found it on my phone. I was just thinking about that ladies interpretive dance. The least comfortable with thinking about it again. Like it made me like get it, get, it makes me feel icky inside. Yeah, that's right. It's so weird. Why do people share that fucking Shit Dude? Don't shh. Don't share your feelings like that cause they're more emotionally balanced in you. I know. Um, it's just so vulnerable. It's like ugh. Yeah. Gotcha. So uncomfortable. This is so gross. So it's like acoustic guitar singing. I videoed this guy or slam poetry at Starbucks. No, this is, he's, he's just sitting there with his phone by the way. On a table. Yeah. Speaking of his coffee on speakerphone. Crazy. Full volume. Crazy person. And we're all, you know, trying to enjoy our days. Sure, sure.

Speaker 4:          00:26:48       Press Four for this, two for that. Like fuck everybody. Yeah. You guys all listen to me beyond.

Speaker 3:          00:26:56       Yeah. Like you want like it's bad enough when you have to be on hold in your personal life and now you got to hear some other assholes being put on hold. I don't think there's anything worse than someone else's being put on hold that shit up to your ear, asshole. You fucking make everyone else listened to your hold stone. A fucking scumbag. What a scumbag. Such a Dick.

Speaker 4:          00:27:25       Yeah. Now you've got an offering. Listen [inaudible] like you want to hear any of that? Do you want to hear that right? Someone else's fucking hold. We're all sitting there just trying to

Speaker 3:          00:27:44       unwind. Have a coffee and we got to hear your commercials. Unbelievable. Such a piece of shit. What an asshole. Yeah, like what? What goes through people's minds that that's acceptable behavior to put it on speaker phone so everybody gets to hear you being on hold. He's a fucking psycho and he doesn't care. Do you think it's just like an unconscious, like I'm claiming the space. It's like public Whistler's like people that are whistling. It's a way, it's like what birds do to mark their territory. Like everybody listened to me. I'm here, I'm here. He's so removed and he's so narcissistic and so oblivious to the fact that that would be bothersome to somebody else. That's his personality. This is my Starbucks. I don't, I don't even think. Yeah, I mean he doesn't like if you were like to say, do you think other people want to hear the speakerphone?

Speaker 3:          00:28:32       Uh, hold stuff from Bank of America while they're here? He would be like, what? Huh? I don't know. I'm not like totally unaware that he's even doing this. Yeah. And if you pointed out that like no one wants to hear that, he'd be like, well yeah. Do you know what we need right now in society? By the way, you remember the Guardian Angels of the 80s those nerds that he used to dress up and like fight crime for free and like the New York subways and stuff, we need to have the guardian angels of proper public etiquette. Now people who are designated, they walk around and like uniforms. So you can see like, oh shit, there's the Guardian Angel and that person comes over and goes, excuse me, you're being an asshole. Nobody wants to hear Your Bank of America on hold or a, excuse me, Shit Bird. You don't wear a fucking slippers.

Speaker 3:          00:29:19       I'm thinking a little more aggressive. Go for it. Let's take it out of the Philippines. Uh, I think it's, I don't know if it's president or prime minister. He has a kill onsite policy for drug dealers. Love it. So like if he even thinks you're a drug dealer, like it, permission to shoot you in the head on the streets. I think they should do it. Yeah. For socially. Yeah. Rude people execute. Somebody goes right there murders that guy in Starbucks and it's innocent. And then everyone's like, what the fuck are they like speak phone, full blast. And here's how we do it. It's a fucking bullet right in the brain. So you see the splatter, the blood splatter on the window. And then like in China, when people are students, China, they send your family the bill for the bull. You get a thing in the mail.

Speaker 3:          00:30:05       It's like you owe us a fucking dollar 28 and you know who else gets a fucking bullet in the head? Whoever their car breaks down during rush hour traffic on the four oh five if you're responsible, your car breaks down at 5:00 PM on a fucking Friday and it's your fault that everyone else has now even further fucks right in the fucking head. Yeah, and we do it in public. We round people up. Maybe we'll delay that. You know what I mean? Like at the end of the week we'll do all the assholes that held up traffic was Handmaid's tale. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They all get around. We all grab a rock and everybody gets a chance to throw 11 person. I love it. Yeah, I like it too, man. Let's get through this guy who hates white people real quick. Everybody hates wiping. I know. It's kind of

Speaker 5:          00:30:48       okay. You guys just have to go off real quick about racism. Kay. Kay. Fuck white people. Yeah. Every culture has something like, look at the Chinese, they have like honor and Mike. Okay. Like light, like native native Americans, like Hispanic people. They have like heritage and shit in their culture, heritage and their shit. Fucking hamburgers like kicking in the fucking door on other countries and being like, hey, we're better than you because we made you do everything for us and what a bunch of needy fucking wipe fuck white people. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:31:26       Yeah. Is this the new professor over at uh, Harvard sociology guy? Yeah, the new FTT RTD professor over there. He's the, he's the vice admiral FTD. Our head of sociology. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:31:50       Where are all the good white jokes? There's a million white jokes about every fucking light culture and they're all [inaudible]. Why is there no good, funny white jokes? Black home. He told me this and I hit the ground laughing. Yeah. We are all the white jokes bro. We are all the white jokes.

Do your friend drew these in your car while you were driving and put them on you? We are all the white jokes. Gosh, that's really thought this through. I like his presentation.

So what happened? Was he something like woke him up more? He heard, he was like, yeah, yeah. How come there are no white people joke book jokes that's fucked up. Like really opened his eyes. Yeah. And now he thinks he's having a profound thought. Yeah. This is the first thought he's had that's like, oh, that was your share.

Speaker 3:          00:32:56       This one is big. I think they need to share is PR. Is there like a weight that's another person that gets executed by the way. The need to share people. Yeah. If you're oversharing on social media, bullet in the head. Oh, that'd be a great one to eliminate. I would love to kill everybody that does. Yeah. I think the, uh, the Elizabeth Gilbert Interpretive Dancer gets a bullet right quick. This guy is so stupid. He's so dumb. Yeah. He's really not right. I figured that part out. Why? Why come people Chinese of honor and the native Americans have heritage and his face too. Yeah. They also have good food. Yeah, there's Chinese. The Chinese, what did he say? They have their honor. Honor. And then we are all the white jokes, bro. Oh, we are all the wide Joe's by being alive. We're all white jokes. Yeah. Okay. I don't get it. You know who's back?

I mean, you want to know why you're all fucked up. This guy's a genius. This is the smartest man alive. Yet Dan Pena should run for president. He's, he would start our policy of public execution and I were discussing some of the level of some of the things you have here. Hold on. This is why you're fucking poor, right? [inaudible] this is Dan. You know you won't, we featured them on our show. Yeah, of course. What did you put it?

Speaker 6:          00:35:13       Where is it? You had a, you have a fucking template script. You have a mother fucking script that a fucking monkey can read that Alex wants a fucking case study because he wants to know this shit behind it cause he's stupid and that's why he's fucking poor. Hey, you don't need any motherfucking case studies. How many fucking times do I have to say you had the fucking script. There's Dan. I said, don't change your fucking war on a square. Not a comma. If it's got missed the fucking word sending down misspelled. The last thing you fucking need is a fucking

Speaker 3:          00:35:56       case study. It's my coach I speech. This is why your fucking whore. Okay. There's Dan, just one of my favorite people and really a friend of the show. He and I kept in touch. We DM on Twitter from time to time and it just, we've had lunch with him. No, he's really a treasure. Got this aggressive persona, but he's actually a very sweet man to be around. Wonderful Gentleman. Wonderful Guy. I didn't know about this. This was just saying in, but so this one was leading up to I think like Dan Pena who gives a fuck about the global warming I think.

Speaker 6:          00:36:36       Thank you for asking that question. I have the answer for the question. Okay. We changing the gas now you're full of shit. Sit down. I'm going to answer you. Shut up and sit down. Sit down. Let's just take Florida for example, which is one of the fastest growing condominium beachfront condominiums on the planet. In the perspectives when you invest, there should be in the footnotes. If global warming this for real and water wise is 10 feet. This investment you made is fuck all. Now one single investment prospectus written since 2008 this century has alluded to global warming. Now one motherfucker. So the people that have the money and I'm jealous of the Vice President Gore, which shall and I wrote on a plane from South America with fears of I am jealous. He came up with a scan before I did because the financial institutions, the banks of this world, no, it's not going to happen otherwise you couldn't get a goddamn loan in London. You know those 30 40 year mortgages, the will be over by then. Is Barclays bank going to give you a motherfucking loan? That's

Speaker 3:          00:38:14       the best. I love her. I don't know what the hell he's talking about but um, yeah, he needs a TV show. Do you know what I mean? Fuck Anderson Cooper, pun on damn pain. Yeah. Every night. If he had a TV show on scene, yeah, I would watch this guy. Of course, I don't have to agree with anything. He's just entertaining

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       mother fucker, but he can't be censored. You have to let him roll like those gotta be on like Hbo or showtime. That's too like a fan. That's somebody that was like, I have questions. Shut up. This guy's a trend for sure. Bought a ticket to ask him. Yeah, of course. Shut the fuck up. Well, she also wants to fucking light him up. Of course. Like Dan Pena is going to be an environmentally, that's not his fucking lane. Don't think the guy talking about, she uses hillage guy. He's a savage course. I've watched the shit out of that. I would love to have him on because he's easy. He is a Trump supporter. I know. He's the only, like, I feel like, I think it's 97% of the scientists that are experts in the field agree about global warming, but he is the only person I've ever heard contested with.

Speaker 1:          00:39:42       How come? Financial institutions or real estate. Yeah. Well how come they're like, do you think they're going to loan you something? They're not going to get back in a few years. That it's actually not one that I've ever heard before. So I would give him that. Well, it's from his perspective, right? That's what he deals in his money and real estate and stuff like that. But he is a white guy, so fuck white people. I don't like them. Now. Um, our guest should be here momentarily. Should we take a quick break and we'll be back in a moment? All right. Here we are. Yeah, we're back. Where we, uh, we're back with our guests. He's tall, he's white and he's thin and he's here still weak. Chin is the great return guests. We've had them on multiple times. Right. But the, it's been a while. I spent a long time.

Speaker 1:          00:40:29       I think maybe I've done it twice. Third time probably at a different location every time. Pretty much. Yeah. I think, uh, the great map. Wronger thank you for coming. This is a joy. Yeah. Love. You guys know we love you man. It's been way too long. Yeah. I feel like, I mean talk, we started doing, stand up. Three of us are in la. Did stand up together like probably 15 years ago. Yeah, something like that. I remember seeing you guys. I remember the first time I saw each of you. I remember the first time I saw you, you didn't go up. You were realizing you were visiting from Chicago, you had a blazer on and it was at like a maybe like a beige colored Blazer and it was at Tangier, I think I, we were like, you're like, oh. And you were like Super Nice. I was like, Oh fuck is this guy? Like, cause he was like, Hey, I'm at like really outgoing and nice. Which is rare because people are always stretched bags. Matt was genuinely a nice person. Nice person. Thank you. I remember I used to wear like blazers and tee shirts. It's a hot, it's a hot look. But like, but like I remember sometimes I'd

Speaker 7:          00:41:34       talk to comics and they'd be like, oh, what's up man? Good thinking. I was like an exam or something. Oh, right, right. Just like, cause they never seen me before and they're just wondering, you know, well and here too, I mean, I don't know if it's nationwide, but la, anybody. Oh, under 40 in a jacket. Specially if they're dressed in a suit or something. Yeah. Oh that's an agent. Junior age. It's so weird how they're always in suits. I feel like a j agents almost always have to wear suits. Like why now, now that you can, you see them more out with like, oh, I just had a, like, I just got a tucked in shirt with what you're learning, you know, but I don't know why they have to be dressed like that. Then they just get told like, you have to look better than anyone kind of thing you have to represent.

Speaker 7:          00:42:11       And it's cause because it's like, fuck, I have friends that work for, for ca and knows been uta in those giant like ca building, you know, we call it the death star because it's just, it looks, and it is, you know, that is some Darth Vader shit, like, yeah. And so it's this culture of win at all costs, which I just can't imagine living in. I mean, like, like that. And that's what the Blazer, yeah, I guess, yeah. You gotta come, you gotta come in like, uh, like, uh, uh, like agent Smith, uh, um, I remember a tricks. Oh yeah. That is kind of thing that is the uniform of the soul. Succubus the sales pitch program is always like the most aggressive. They're like, what are you doing with the, you know, your mailing list and you're like, I don't know. They're like, you know, we have this program [inaudible] it can permeate someone's computer.

Speaker 7:          00:43:10       You have to read their fucking emails. Yeah. And we'll make yours. And you're like, wait, what? Yeah. I mean, I'm exaggerating obviously, but it's like crazy shit like that. You know? As you guys know, my, my wife is my ex manager, so it's like, I know stuff I probably shouldn't know about all this stuff, you know? And like no manager games, no games, no games. I know, I know agent games and it's like, I will, I will talk with her like when she's like, and she's got a small roster that's really awesome and stuff. So she's not generally looking for new clients, but like sometimes I'll see somebody and be like, oh, they're great. Or there's someone that's got a lot of heat on them and she'll be like, yeah, I think I'd like to sign them. But this person, this person, this person, like these big dogs are kind of coming in and stuff and I will pretend to be them with her and be like, you know, just like how they talk to the client or when she's around, you know, that takes care is great.

Speaker 7:          00:43:53       I love her. I love her. Here's the thing, my team, cause they never talk shit about each other. Not really, but it's just kind of thing. The of just like, just like, no, no, no. Yeah, like that um, teams, Godfrey thing, he's like, you know, you're screwed when they say they love you, follow, followed by, but they don't want you for this. So that's always [inaudible] I love her. I love her that we're not going to pick up the project. But that's always the casting feedback too. Like what did they say it? They're like, well they said they loved you. Yeah, here it comes. They love

Speaker 8:          00:44:32       me and they're giving me this part. Actually they don't love you that much. You love your friend. I got fired from Chelsea lately as a writer. We executive came down after a taping was like, you're doing such a great job. We love you. I just wanted to let you know we love you. And I was like, ah. And the next morning I got fired. Yeah. And that's exactly what I know. When they told you you didn't know. But I remember I felt really good about myself. I was like, wow, I'm nailing this Gig. No Way. I just don't know how my, I created a project and sold it with a cousin of mine a couple of years ago and he writes video games and writes books and stuff and he's one the smartest guys I've ever met. And us going through the process together. He was like, I don't know how you guys do this.

Speaker 8:          00:45:12       I don't know how you live like this. And if when you tell me stories like that, it's like I'm having like PTSD flashbacks of times where I've been let go or, or someone's, you know, kind of, you know, you're like, oh, I think everything is great. And like that's when the bottom drops out. How do you maintain cycle? Horrible. It's a horrible parent time. Businesses. It's like logically traumatizing its own way, but the, the TV film is Wally will stand up is consistently shitty. Right? Like you just know there's always going to be a crazy club owner. Sure is not going to be right. It's fraught with dog shit. It doesn't change. It's just like, you know like when they, when Nash, Steve Martin, why he quit stand up and he's like Friday to Friday. That's why. And it's got to, you can feel like, you know, like you think you could be a microcosm metaphor would be like a Friday night, like the first show law.

Speaker 8:          00:46:10       Great. Everything went awesome. Crowd was, was it having a good time, which they should. They're little boost up, which great, but they weren't over the top. And then that second show where people went to happy hour and stayed out and they went and they missed the first show and they're in and you feel like you're strapping on like Swat team equipment backstage. Oh here we're going through the door. We're going to the door of this crack house and the best part of my hands on your shoulders, put your hands on him, on the host, the host, he's going to kick in a door is he's going to get shot in the face. We know he's dead. Yeah, that guy's going to get mowed. The rookie thing. Yeah. Look, Caitlin, you're second. Like I think you'll catch a couple of shots. You got your, you have your week, you've got your vest on.

Speaker 8:          00:46:50       At least though, if you're in a good club, you know, they know they're like your support team, their headquarters. But there's the clubs that are like, what man? And you're like, come on. Like what? I don't kick anybody out there. Like this is what it is. Nobody are like, yeah, but you can make it better. I love, I love clubs that have, that had their security so good that the pier, there's like loud drunk guy and then all of a sudden there's someone standing behind him like Batman. It just gives them a little tap. Like, they haven't orchestrated, but no one notices these people, but they just slide up and get them out the suit. You know what I mean? It's just like, yeah, the guy that just comes behind and just splits guys throwing like a, you know, in the movies like a Ninja, a century with a machine gun.

Speaker 8:          00:47:33       He just gets pulled her portion. He's gone. Like that's, I have one super intimidating looking guy. Yes. I don't understand why they dumb like when they go like this is security and it's a guy like half my size. I'm like, no, it's a woman. Yeah, there's a, I've seen great female bouncers because a lot of times those guys are not going to push back on a woman hit her or she talks some shit. Yeah. And there was a, there was a lady and uh, I was just in Montreal this past week and there's a lady at one club that was like roped, like her arms were very strong and I like tattoos and she has like her hair pulled back and he's like scary post apocalyptic white girl dreadlocks. And you're like, oh, like, and she was, you know, where I'm watching her and I said, she's laughing.

Speaker 8:          00:48:19       I'm like, oh, I feel really good about myself. Right. Because she's intimidating. And also like these guys that want to like, you know, who's gonna throw me out? Like if she punches you in the face and you're fighting back tears and getting thrown out, like this is not good. Look for that. That guy who thinks he's an Alpha male. So you can be like, hey, hey, hey, all right, I'll get out. I'll get out. You know, psychologically it works. Big, strong woman. Yeah. And just not even that big, just wirey yeah. You know, like, like strong, you know, built, built, strong like a security likes you, it almost feels as good as black people approval.

Speaker 8:          00:48:54       It's almost as good black people where you're like, I feel really good about myself. That Cleveland Improv. Yes. I know that. Not to Brag, you don't have to feel like I did it. I had a great set there and walked outside and there's that little standing river back there and uh, and uh, uh, tug, tugboat went by blaring Tupac. Yeah, I yelled out tug life tagline. I got a second laugh outside with people having cigarettes. That's awesome. It's so funny that you nailed one of my, one of my choices. Perfect moment. It felt great. I also know that room when it doesn't go course. I remember the heckles I remember a woman in the back going a, your mama should have swelled that nut. Oh my God. And I remember, uh, a guy just like third row he's going through. It's terrible, man. That's the worst.

Speaker 8:          00:49:53       I remember I ran in New York and it put me to sleep in Italian and Italian guy going, oh man. Well you kidding me here? Like, c'mon, let's get outta here. Like audibly, during my setup, that's worse because you know, it's authentic. It's not like, hey, you suck and it's undeniable. I'm not doing well right now. I'll read the comment cards. You ever read those when you were a feature? Nope. That's a bad idea. I don't read the Youtube. Oh, I know. I learned that I only didn't read them because I probably didn't think about it. If I was when I was still featuring,

Speaker 7:          00:50:28       I would have read them all, I'm sure. Right. These validation, and even if you were at 300 good ones, he would find the too. Yeah. Oh yeah. Hey, did you do that now? You got to do that now. Even on Twitter or whatever. The one guy that hates your guts. Yeah. It's just, it just feels good. That's the joy of stand up. You gotta keep yourself feeling. I don't get as many, you know, like out and out. I hate you ones, but like I get backhanded compliments, which are, to me, those are kind of fantastic. What's your favorite one? Yeah. Got to tell us. Uh, I did a throwback show and Montreal with Wanda Sykes and Jo Koy unfortunate Feemster throwback show. They put clips, old clips of us and everyone has a mic and everyone can stop it. You don't know. Do you know what clip was coming?

Speaker 7:          00:51:16       No, not really. They had, they had doesn't forward like a backyard party drunk and it once. And I remember doing that show and be like, I remember it being fun and I was like, oh my low close Chris Gethard was backstage and I was telling about it cause he was the, he was the next show, not not throw back and he just got quiet and I was like, are you okay? He's like, I, I'm just having horrible flashbacks. I'm having like charges of terror going through my body right now. And I'm just like, yeah. And I guess we were just sweating on stage, which I, it was, it was, it sounded like, like probably how skydiving fields. I've never skydive but it felt like that. Wait, what were you saying? Compliment. Oh, so someone said like, uh, these guys are really funny. No one could have saved that show, but boy they tried.

Speaker 7:          00:52:02       Oh show I thought did really well, which was surprising to me but I don't know. They're like good try though. No one. Amen for effort man. Your show and like you try hard that. And Tom and I both hate when people are like, oh we saw your special on Netflix is good. It's pretty good. Pretty good, pretty good, pretty good, pretty fun. It's just that thing that everyone's an expert on comedy, everyone. Because everyone, I pretty much, everyone's made someone laugh at some point. Yes. But a lot of these people are uh, office managers or bosses where the person has to laugh at this things you say. And so you like Michael Scott go like, oh, I'm funny. I'm funny. And so everyone has an no. You know, I was on my couch on my fifth beer. You were in front of a thousand people by yourself.

Speaker 7:          00:52:54       Uh, Tom. And you know what I think I know I would've done different things than you and it's like, Nah, you probably would have shit yourself and ran off stage. Yeah. Well cause we haven't done 15, 20 years of staff who said it. But I think the more that I thought about it, I was like, they're right. Every man, every man thinks they're hilarious. Yeah. To it. Like, if you get them at the right time, they're like, I'm pretty fucking funny. Yeah. And so, yeah. And you know, some of them are, yeah. To be fair with them actually are really funny. Yeah. But I still,

Speaker 8:          00:53:26       some of them are not to any of us, uh, not flinch a little when we're forced to say out loud that were funny. I'll never write professional. Right. Right. That, but even then, right then I couldn't say it because it's just like too, it feels gross. It feels gross. Yeah. A friend of mine and I were saying we can hang out. It's always hilarious when anyone on ironically describes themselves as smart, funny or tough. Oh my God. Talking about themselves. So like three guys rushed us and I like fought him. I'm like the tough one. And Mike, you're the toes. I worked on this puzzle. I it, I mean I'm, I'm pretty smart. Yeah. I mean, good for you. Smart. Really smart people you'll find usually don't lead with how smart they are. No, because they understand the all encompassing vastness of human intelligence. Right. Every, every smart versus met someone that made them feel like a monk. Of course. Every one of them. Yeah. You know, like who? Someone I knew someone who knew someone who was hired as a, as a Simpsons writer. And he went, he wins like, and he was always the smartest person in the room and he went in that room and he's like, I've never felt stupid in my whole life. So it's like you need stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          00:54:33       Wait, can I, can I, sorry, I just, yeah, we pull up the Instagram video that we watched earlier and just see if Matt feels the same thing we do. Okay. Because that's kind of, it's a long list tangent, tangent of like what's an calf feels? Grody yeah. And you're like, does this feel, does this feel? What am I feeling like I'm not sure if I'm sorry I interrupted you. No, no, no. I, that was that, that was my say. It was okay. Just like, tell me how this, how does this make you feel? Just watch this. It's a video. It's grief as a full body experience. So this is a dance of grief, this person. Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:55:07       I mean this is just letting the grief out, but yeah, I'm sorry to be, I mean she's obviously talented. She's got good movement since it feels like a very white, it's a white lady thing. You Do, right?

Speaker 8:          00:55:28       Yeah, I think so. You know what it's like. The thing is, it's like I grew up, I grew up in Portland, Oregon where my parents took me to so many things. Like here's the difference. Here's the difference. If you're in a theater and you're like, I'm here to watch experimental dance. They were asking for it. Yes you are right. And I kind of, I will be honest, I kind of respect the fact that she went ahead and put this up. Yeah. Cause that's inviting all kinds of shredding. Right. But at this, by the way, none of the comments are mean. We're the only people are going to meet. All the comments are like beautiful boy. Hey listen. I'm like Kara. Kara is always just, just punching me over the head over it. You're always, you never are. You know, you'd never, I'm never the guy who just like gives it three beats and goes, oh fuck this chick. You don't like, you're not that guy. Never. No, not really. But like, no, you're like at the same time it's,

Speaker 7:          00:56:17       it did,

Speaker 8:          00:56:19       is she putting this up to help with others? Grief, grief,

Speaker 7:          00:56:24       to show her dance scale because he is not a good dancer. It's uh, the, the person. It doesn't matter. Does it matter the person who put it up, it's not the person dancing. As I listen, as I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt, I'm still laughing. It's still, I mean I'm still because you're, it's a little bit cringy yes it is. And like, yeah, like let's say, let's say I did this, it's me doing that. That would be entertained. Well, but here's the thing. I respect this more than an incredibly fit celebrity that's like, like just showing his or her amazing body and going and going and going. There were times I didn't love myself or postpartum picks that models and actresses put up like two weeks postpartum and the flat belly. Yeah. I'm putting these pictures up to inspire other women like no you're not. You're not showing your pockmarked ass. You know what I mean? Hanging off the edge of a chair, you know it's to insight jealousy and envy. Yeah. Like there's that weird thing. She's English but she does, she does a imitations of celebrity like videos and pictures where she's like was girl a woman in a bikini jump roping insanely like soul, like soul cut and then she does it. She's like their bellies jumping.

Speaker 7:          00:57:42       I went the same hashtags which is just like perfect video shut up Schnitzel. This video makes me so uncomfortable because it's so earnest cause like I'm not capable, I'm not that in touch with my feelings. So when I see other people doing it I'm like Oh God, God gives me so much anxiety to be in touch with your feelings. That's what I was saying is that it's great. The balance in the universe is that the earnest sincere person exists and they are actually helpful. Good to have. Right. That non cynical like earnest person and then the balance is at the universe feels that we're pieces of shit like us to mock them and some people enjoy that. But I don't know if it's the pieces of shit. Well you know, I will say I because, because, because, because it's like when this person does that and puts it out there, they know what they're doing and they had got you got it.

Speaker 7:          00:58:35       If you're going to be an artist, you better have a thick ass skin. I think you're right. You know, cause it's like, and kind of go. Yeah, you're right. All right, cool. I'll, I'll take it. I'll tell you, don't get butthurt because I'll put it this way. Back to my childhood. I remember going to these performances and like look at my dad and he's so uncomfortable, you know, it wasn't comfortable because it's just like, you know, yeah. Try to take it and you know, he wants to be like, this is dumb. Like he wants to so bad, you know. But he's kind of just, just trying to keep an open this, your mother forced you guys to watch this horse shit. I think it's just, I'm kind of try to map, look like my dad would take me a little bit, but like, uh, like he also would be like, alright, you know, let's, let's go to this thing and take me to that. Take me to every Schwartzenegger movie every day. His bond. But because

Speaker 8:          00:59:22       I had none knowledge and perspective, I wasn't like, I feel like right now there's a movement and you know, like fucking white pride anti women dumbos that while we're red hats and blah, blah, blah. And those guys, and I think those guys took those movies seriously as a commando was real. They thought Schwartzenegger was really, and that was a real, you know, and they like the enemy. Ah, I just want to stab someone so bad and they really want a death star to blow up. But that shit doesn't exist. Trump's sells smart by the way. It's set up in multiple interviews and so, you know, it's true. No, it's true. By, by our definition. Yeah. You know it's true. Yeah. He probably also says he's funny and tough. He has said,

Speaker 1:          00:59:58       he said when that horrible Parkland shooting took place at that school, he's like, I would have gone in there unarmed. Yes, for sure. And like he's like fucking, yeah, I would have run into easy, I've heard an assault rifle. I would have run into that phone bro. For real though. Like you don't know man. I know I've done some wild shit. Yeah. For Real. Why don't we give him a chance next time there's some somebody hold up in a trader Joe's or something. Let's just fly in.

Speaker 8:          01:00:26       Yes. He said stand down. Stand down. Swat team.

Speaker 1:          01:00:30       Yeah. No, that's smart. Tough. And what's the other one? And Fun and funny because people will sometimes, sometimes people will tell you after shows, they'll be like, I'm pretty funny guy. And you're like, all right. Or I'll get emails. They'll say, um, you know, I watched your special or I was at your show and I have, uh, some material that I think nice you would be able to, to like, I'm not gonna use it cause I don't do it. I'll give it to you and I'll be like, okay, cool, thanks. And they'll be like, so do you want it? If you want it hit me up. And I'm like, no, I'm, I'm good. And then they'll follow up and they're like, it's fucking like Primo material and then I'll not respond and, and they'll write, hey, uh, I know she didn't respond, but I'm going to share it with you anyways. And it'll be like a of a, of just writing with no punctuation. Oh God. You're like, right, that's fine.

Speaker 8:          01:01:24       Well, and it's all, it's also like willful ignorance where it's like, look, I don't want to learn all the, I didn't want to go through all that stuff. You've gone through it. Yeah. I just want to get it. I want you to think the lady, I hated the thought, the pornography of suffering that like American idol and all those shows do where they show you the people that succeed. You thought you could sing it killing yourself or shame. But there was one lady who came on and just couldn't dance and couldn't sing and then had a meltdown, which she's like, I know you can do that thing where you put people's voices through it like a filter and make someone a star do it for me. And it's like, why would we do that? I want to be a star so you can have all this. What is, what do I gain in breaking my neck to do that? So it's like that thing of, of someone just being like, well I know you did stand up and shitty rooms for 20 years, but like I just want to skip ahead.

Speaker 7:          01:02:18       You had a friend who I'm no longer friends with actually. She was like, yeah, I'd like, I'd love to do what you do, but I don't want to go through like, you know, learning how to do it and failing and so I just want to be like successful at it. I was like, I don't think I can be friends with you. I mean, I really don't think I can know a person is horrible. Yeah. I mean it's like I love being lazy. It's the best. It doesn't get you anything and you need to recognize that. So gross. You don't deserve things. You just want the glory. Speaking is an only child. Right. You know what I mean? I always thought I was a golden golden boy. I'm not right. But it's like the amount of people who just want stuff handed to them. And it's a stereotype for millennials and I don't think it's any more or less true than our generation or whatever, but like the amount of people who once they hit 30 and they're not Drake slash Zuckerberg, right.

Speaker 7:          01:03:11       I wonder how it's going to shatter their psyches cause we're like, no, no, I'm a blow up. I'm going to blow up. It's the pressure to be a Zuckerberg by the time you're 30 because there are so many fuck heads that are super multi millionaires and now you feel inadequate because you're not a multimillionaire by the time you're 30 and that's just silly. And the whole thing really is like if you actually just get into the work of it and like you really love it. You got, it sounds Cliche, but the ups and downs come with that and you will feel like, oh, I did something meaningful. You don't want to miss out on all that stuff. The good and the bad. The bad stuff helps a lot. Absolutely. It helps. A couple of things I have to update on before I do this. Excuse me, this advertisement.

Speaker 7:          01:03:52       Sure Bud. Um, first is that I got the message that added show in Montclair is happening Wednesday, November 14th. It is on sale this Friday, this Friday Thompson grow.com tour. We're adding a show in Montclair at the Welmont. Additionally, the bikes socks are on sale now. Yup. Socks. You know, they are, I will say I want a pair of those. I will send you a pair of those and you can go and, uh, get them there@merchantmethod.com slash Tom Sigora got them up on my Instagram. Just want someone to give that to their mom. Who Does it? I love bikes, not realizing what it is. Just like something, a convict stream kids. Yeah. So there's, there's that. And have you seen,

Speaker 7:          01:04:41       you said familiar? Oh my gosh. Cool. It's so good. And they're so beautiful. The tick, right? She's gorgeous. And it works. That's the music that indicates it's time to talk about teeth. So quip is bringing us this dental update. Do you have a nice smile? Even going to the dentist, taking care of a year. Twice a year I had a, a snore guard made. Okay. And the first one they made didn't work. Oh, I took it home. And um, you know, they take a mold of your mouth. Oh, okay. I didn't know that. Yeah. And then I brought it into the dentist. Yeah. Try It on. And he basically like under his breath was like, fuck. I was like, why? He's like, he goes, we'll send you a new one. And I go, well, yeah, I mean it's got to work. Right. So, so anyways, they sent the new one.

Speaker 7:          01:05:31       Do you have any complaints? Oh, it's saved our lives. If you have somebody in your marriage, your spouse, wherever, whoever sleeps next to you that snores, go to the dentist and get a professional snore guard word. Does it go? So it just took your mouth to mouth and it has bands, uh, the, the top deck dish and the bottom tray. Yeah. Have a band that are adjustable. So what happens is the principle of the idea is see snoring is caused by different things for different people. Right. Most of the time it's that someone's lower jaw actually drops down. Yes. And then obstructs the air passage. So the mouth guard with those bands, depending on how tight you make them, just keeps your lower jaw up. So you fall asleep and instead of your mouth dropping, oh, it just stays up. Stays forward. But what if you sleep like with breathe through your mouth when you sleep?

Speaker 7:          01:06:21       I mean there's, yeah, there's open and there's, yeah, there's air can pass through it. Okay. It's just like, oh, of course. Keeps your, and then if you have like a really strong drop, you can make the band super tight in your mouth. Like just looks sexy, right? You want to laugh. A lot of guys that have their mouth garden and it also, you feel because you're, when you're, you don't realize when you snore a lot. I didn't that your sleep is super fucked up. [inaudible] always like dragon, like God. And ever since I started, I started wearing them years ago. He's got it. This is a new one. Uh, always feel completely differently. Really. Yeah. You sleep deeper. Yeah. I don't always snore, but like my wife will wake me up and I ordered my first one. Like when she recorded it, she recorded me snoring. And this is back when we lived in the Rampart division.

Speaker 7:          01:07:13       This is like, Oh yeah, near Macarthur Park. Right. I remember that. Every time I go to the dynasty typewriter. I think of you guys. Is that, that new place? How is it? It's good. Yeah. It feels real old school. You know, a Jamie who used to run the Improv runs it and he, he just bunch of different weird shows. Uh, it's the one thing is parking is, is just a monster over and your car is going to get Jack Cooper down there. Uber. Yeah. There you go. Well, there's the heads up, just Uber, Uber. But the shows are good, but it's a fun, it's a fun room. Yeah. Um, before, I don't want to just, I just want to jump over it. Your, you started basically a new version of your podcast. What's it called? It's called advice from a dipshit with Matt Broenger. That's perfect. Thank you. I'm very, very proud of the name I, everything I've ever named, it's just like, doesn't make me laugh. Like every album, every special. Like is it, is it a name that makes me laugh? You know what I mean? I always, I, I, you know, we both have bits about, about tattoos. Oh yeah. We both hate meaningful

Speaker 8:          01:08:15       tattoos. I hate meaningful special titles. I don't hate him. Oh, there's gotta be, I know there's a few that we got to talk about it at all. So, you know, I mean, it depends, but, but uh, or, or album titles are sincere ones. You mean like if someone calls, you know, like, like I'm waiting for the guy to name his comedy album or a special beast where it's like, which is a nickname would give you like a compliment, not a nickname. We gave each other, but anyway, that guy's a beast. Then the picture is like, first thing I had to change the caution tape. Caution tape. Caution tape to this comedies. Too dangerous. It was a crime scene. There's a crunchy to killed. So hard. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, tape over the mouth. Equal opportunity offender. Uh, the victim, but the podcast was called Ding Dong or with Matt Bronco.

Speaker 8:          01:09:11       I would still like it, but people who don't know who I am, there's like, what? Who is this? Tara? Would you got it like a rest of, what's the billboard? What do, what's the show about? Okay, I get it. You don't like what I have to read it and understand. I feel like advice from a dip. Shit. You're like, I get it. Yeah. So people, people can call in. Can I read the, the number? Of course, yes. Of course. People call in and just leave a message, like whatever you want to ask about because I feel like, you know, I got married at at 43, I, I've had a Dui. I made a lot of fun in the sky. It's in my life, but all of which kind of made me who I am. They're like, we're all made of mistakes, you know? And it's just like, it's kind of become this dear dip shit, Abby for millennials and older where people are just like, and I get older people asking me how the, how I get, how you get over heartbreak.

Speaker 8:          01:09:59       I get, um, people, uh, younger people going, like, my parents really want me to be this, but I want to be this. Yeah. You know, I get people, like, how do I tell my family I'm gay? And it's like I draw from experience, uh, just people that I've known who've gone through this, but mostly through my own experience and I'm actually going to have, um, uh, I started having like guests on every couple of episodes to listen with them with me because I don't hear him beforehand. I don't pick the messages. My producer partner Amanda does. And so she'll, she'll be like, Ooh, I got some in the barrel for you this time. And she'll play them. And I'll be like, whoa, like what the shit? And like I'm doing them live now. And so it's fun because the audience hears him for the first time with me.

Speaker 8:          01:10:38       And there's nothing like a packed room where a guy's like, hey man, love your comedy. I got a weird Dick. I'm like, all right. Yeah, we'll live with that. We'd be a lot of fun. It's a lot of fun. And it's like I, I treat everything sincerely. I make it into entertaining, you know, as a comedian. But it's like I'm not here to make fun of people. Right. And so people know that it's kind of like, I came to use the term safe space, but it's like you say anything you want, don't prank me, don't do a character cause it ain't gonna make it. I'm not going to play it. Well, you're going to be respectful of them it sounds like. Yeah. So the number is 323-SEVEN-SIX-3228 if you want to call it three g three seven six three zero two two eight and just leave a message.

It's so fun doing it. Yeah. Cause I've always been a fan of both of your voices as Comedians, like your people that I hang out with. And I always just laugh at a time. I saw you on the road and you were like just in a Mcdonald's and I was like, Hey, there's water at an airport. And I always, I was thinking about this, I might've said this on the show, but I remember the first time we did stand up actually together and it was in, it was in Venice and you went up and crushed and then someone up after I went up after you and did eh, and I got off stage and I was like, who is that guy?

Speaker 8:          01:12:09       Cause I'd never seen you. Yeah. And this guy sidled up next to me and was like, yeah, you know why he didn't do that? Well, because that guy, he's not supposed to kill like that. And he didn't know you at all based on how he thought you looked or something. Oh. And I was like, okay, fuck this guy. Yeah. Yeah. Tom's cool. Yeah. I like it says name Tom. I like Tom. Yeah. But it was that thing like Dion, Udacity. Yeah. Of people to be like, look to see you. I got same guy. Be like, ah, it's a chick depravity. Okay. Of course. You know what I mean? It's just that these categories sure. People put, yeah, I love watching. I still love watching standup. I still love watching comedy and I love being surprised. That is true. Any surprises? The best elements where you're just like, where did this person come from? But I never go, oh, this person is going to eat it ever. No,

Speaker 3:          01:12:55       cause you don't know you. I do that. No, you don't ever know. Yeah. Do you do if a guy looks like he's nervous a little bit or if he immediately comes out with way too much cursing right off the bat or hey, how are you guys doing tonight? How's everybody feeling?

Speaker 8:          01:13:11       Ah, or you can see, you can see like, like kind of hallway backstage. A bravado like fake confidence. If it's someone who's like fucking, you should have seen my show Thursday or something and you're like, oh, this is going to be bad. [inaudible] like that. That's that's Oh yeah, definitely are talking about another show. How well they did. I'm like it treating it like a locker room. Yeah. That's a lot of hot chicks there, man. Have you been bro? Real hot shit. You're like this guy's going to eat his own dick. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:13:39       All right. You ever see those comics before? Like when we were starting to come up to book book shows, there was always a guy in the alleyway kind of pacing back and forth. Nervously listening like heavy metal music to get himself palms like that guy.

Speaker 8:          01:13:52       Yeah. Shadow boxing. Shadow box. Always a bad sign. Yeah. Trying to get themselves psyched to go out at midnight real quick. I was about to go out and we let her bring us out on at midnight and I'm back there with Hassan Minhaj and I'm like, my legs are so stiff. I'm just stretching my thought. I was just like, he's like, you just stretched before you out. And I'm like, no, I never

Speaker 7:          01:14:11       do. And he's just like long as you're not shadow boxing. He says the same time we knew the words he used to get ripped at the early shows. That Guy Cameron, it was at the cat club. He would just, he'd be like, I'm up, I'm up the class. And he would just like whiskey whiskey. Yeah. But then when it was, it'd be really funny, like you're seeing like a seven minute, oh, so this your ra next week you'd be like, I can't wait to see that guy again. And he would be like, he'd just drink like five whiskies and then he wrote about you fucking bitch. You, you'd be laughing at him being a mess. Be like, you're not laughing at that funny anymore. You're like, this is crazy. Like this is a guy screaming at a bus stop basically. You know, you're like, this is bad. Which you Matt, would you judge this guy? Ah, fuck. I can't hear him.

Speaker 9:          01:15:16       I like to have some, I would like to have to do is your roadmap. I would like to have some sex. Oh, Mike, you come last lady 10 15 times before I even went. And beau marks.

Speaker 7:          01:15:37       So he's just putting it out there. Yeah,

Speaker 9:          01:15:41       about that ladies. I would like to pass her one to have sex.

Speaker 7:          01:15:46       So what does he want though? The nuance. Well, he's saying, are you tired of poets, poets? Jesus. Just say what you life is short. We found him last week. We played this, those clips and we talked about it for awhile. It turns out he's got other clips. No, wait a minute. What did mommy say last week when he came into our lives? When we go down this guy's rabbit hole? Yeah, let me, let me, let me say, uh, that's, that's awful. Yeah. And ridiculous and just, uh, all right buddy. Like, you know, cut it out. But counterpoint. If that guy was like in a bar and it was like different people going up and singing little little, little folk songs, country songs and it went up and was like, boom, Dick do like to have some sex. I like to have some titties. It'd be like, Hey man, that's fun.

Speaker 7:          01:16:38       That's how you send that message. You don't just go, I like some sex. Yeah, I'd like some titties in my, in. My last lady came 15 times where I went. Boom. All right man. Women like a little romance compared to most of the people we played. This guy is romantic. That's a sad thing we're on. We're also in Neward. The fact that he has and why? Why so close to the camera. Listen, we've, we've analyzed the visuals on this capsulated that exactly because what that last week, that's what we were saying like you can't just come out like that with women. Women don't respond. Maybe other dudes respond well to that, but you're right. That's what he needed an accessory. Now women don't like that. No, you don't say it's staring in someone's face. You kind of say it off in the distance, you know what I mean? Like you're an old man bartender. And so it was like, hey, how's it going Sam? Me? And he's like, yeah, that's funny. He's not, he's saying it to the universe. I mean everyone feels that way from time to time labeled the this folder, the make you cum guy.

Speaker 7:          01:17:52       So let's see.

Speaker 10:         01:17:54       No, I wish though. That's a bad, bad cold. You can just my club to someone hurting them. Lastly though, what is he watching Rachel Maddow last week it was Rachel Maddow their way.

Speaker 7:          01:18:07       Now it's your way. It's some kind of CSI type drama. I think so, wait a minute. The taking the teeth out is really a bold move. I know. Because last week I think that helps his mouth technique. It probably does, right? Cause all right. Just say that in the presence of police. He did this last week. Look, he ended it. I remember with a big smile. Yep. Hey, I noticed that as Trumpers were creepy. Yeah, we'll wait. We'll wait to false looking. Right when everyone, when someone looks weathered but their teeth straight, like it's weird.

Speaker 10:         01:18:45       Nothing just straight up sex or by no hard feelings. Hey listen, I want to, I don't want to have hard feelings.

Speaker 7:          01:19:08       the unmentionable this thing, the thing that women are self conscious about in shouldn't be. He's like, make sure it smells like who's heat and make demands on someone's vagina. Yeah. Well he said it's about myself. Cleaned up. I will. I will. I will bet $1,000. He has real smelly balls.

I feel like he checks off all the boxes for what? The modern woman, I would not have predicted it, but that, that first video he is watching MSNBC. I did not think that was his lane. I mean, I think it's kind of immaterial what

Speaker 8:          01:20:08       he's watching. The fact that if reflecting on his glasses and he's still looking at the video and go on, I'm gonna put it off. I mean, you've been on camera a lot. He's framed really nicely. He's framed real close. Yeah. Keep, do you remember that movie election? Yeah, I remember the cut to when he finds out, Matthew Broderick finds out his kids, uh, kids, coworker, his co teacher is having sex with Reese Witherspoon's high school girl character and the closeup on his face and he goes, you can't believe how when, or pussy? Yes. Pardon me. Yeah. And it's, it's close because it's awful. Yeah. Because when a guy is talking about that stuff and you're that close, there's nothing worse. Yeah. It's one of the funniest parts of the movie and he's just like, ah man, don't talk like that, you know? Yeah, that's,

Speaker 1:          01:20:48       well that's the thing of phenomenon on our show is that all the creepers, the creeper guys, the framing is always too close. They're generally shirtless. Their lip poorly. The sound is bad. Like they all check these boxes. Yeah. Of Psycho. Well behaviors or thing. He's not done making demands. There's a, there's another video. There's demand. No, it seems like, I mean I'm, I'm just reading kind of the notes about it, but let's see if he,

Cause he was yelling at walk in ahead of you.

Speaker 7:          01:28:30       Just a grown man. Noah was true. I didn't think about it. That's just the visions of a divorced dads that deserve to get divorced. Yeah. Tommy. God Damn it, it's mine. I don't care what any court says. You know, they've, I'm sure they had to deal with that sort of thing. Oh yeah. I can't be just standing in the parking lot and parents like I've never seen him and I'm sure there's probably not a teacher. Oh no, not a caretaker. There's probably friends that have tagged along. Sure. Been like, why can't I come in? Oh No, no, no. And then, and like walk in and they're like, yeah,

Speaker 8:          01:29:02       I, I remember like my, my parents are both educators now retired, but my dad used to, he was in administration the last like 10, 15 years. And he's, he was a principal and a vice principal. And at one point he was principal at this place near our house called, uh, called Holly Rude. That's like, like maybe k through five. And I remember walking up and my dad's was, is, is like taller than me now. He's kind of shrunk with AIDS, but like, he's a big guy and he's just destroying these kids in foursquare. And it was just so fun to watch, but it was like I was walking onto the playground. I'm like, I, this is feels so weird. I'm like, I'm like, Dad, hey. And all the kids just turning to my dad, hey, like they all y'all back at me. But it was like my dad's like, oh, it's my son. And we were like, okay, okay. But it's just like, that was my first exposure to, you know, you can't just walk in here, you know, it's just so I'm very conscious of it.

Speaker 3:          01:29:51       No, of course. And there's a code to get in and they watch those kids like, Huh? You got to, they ain't going nowhere. You have to, yeah, I know he's fucking psychos out. Right.

Speaker 8:          01:29:59       My old voting place used to be inside a grade school that was down the street from my, Nah. I'd go in there and I'm like in the hallway alone, I'm like, this is not good. Where's the boating? Why'd you put it here? And I see the sign and I just run over to it and get in line like whew. Thank God. No,

Speaker 3:          01:30:16       just a bad. Yeah, no. And I love is Matt wanting to put our um, lung infection guy on the voice. So great. Which I think is such a great idea. I was laughing at that. Um, especially cause you're right, that I've done, I've only said I show once, like they, they, the judges have their backs turned to the, yeah. Don't, why is that? Just that you're not biased by, I think that's the idea. Yeah. I've only seen it once, twice, but we are in the age where, you know, it's silly. No, but I'm saying you sell people get huge careers because they look, yeah. Yeah. Where's your telling me about that white singer who sounds black and they were listening? Oh yeah. And the other day. Yeah. Oh I've, I could tell I could go when Bobby Caldwell's a hit song, which you won't do for love. What you won't do for love came out. It came out, it came out like 25, 30 years ago. Yeah. It's like a silhouette. They wouldn't put him on an album cover. They would put on purpose and they knew because it was a hit with black urban hit and they were like, do not show it. Scott. I grew up thinking that guy was black. No, if you hear the song, I thought it was black. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:31:17       Also. Uh, um, he did. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:31:21       so how does the song go? Sing it cause I forget it. Well, do, do pho Lou Bennett, pepto, it's an attorney. James that comes on. Everyone feels good and raided the barbecues. Yeah, it's a, yeah, it's a white guy. He's a white guy. He looks like a real cracker too. You should,

Speaker 8:          01:31:42       you should check out the song. Open your eyes. Common sampled it for that song. The light. There are time that Tim too. Thanks guys. White guys white. What's Bobby also? That's why we call. Yeah, he still tours. He's still, he does like standards and stuff, but yeah. Now Alan Thicke

Speaker 7:          01:32:00       sounds, yeah. He was kind of like a modern day. What's that? Blurred lines. Yeah. I don't think his, his dad Robin. It sounds whiter than anyone. Yeah, he is. He skipped generations. You know, if you guys had like a red headed kid, like what? How'd this happen? Like same thing, right? Right. Real soulful son. He is, he's super soulful. Doug Stanhope had that bit about, remember that the woman that went on like the, uh, Britain's got talent and saying, you know the song and killed it and like, and was like, oh my God, and, and stay at home. It was like, have you heard about the unattractive woman who couldn't say, has anyone heard of this, this wondrous creature? And it's like, oh my, and it hit me. I was like, oh, that's all that was. She came out and she was just Kinda dumpy older lady. Turns out that she also had some mental yes.

Speaker 7:          01:32:56       But it's like, why was that so surprising? You know what I mean? Like, I like the unattractive person that sings the sacs soulful song, you know, about being left or whatever. The English woman, she had mental problems. That's what's her name. She's English and she won like the American. Exactly. What exactly we're talking to them, right? Yeah. It's different. That's different. FTT Rtd. Yeah. She looked like she looked like a bill. Bellacheck yeah. Yeah. Kara. Kara for New England and I got her that tee shirt. That's like the many moods of Bella check. Oh yeah. And it's like same face, static. Furious. I'm relaxed. Can I have a sip of your coffee? I've been drinking so much water that I need something to stop the hydration. Right, right, right. Um, just, uh, you know, uh, to voice. Could you imagine him? Because here's the thing with the lung infection, dude, this is big bill.

Speaker 7:          01:33:51       Bellacheck just see the one sports person. I know her name. Everyone's screaming it right now. Susan. Yes. Susan Boyle. Go. Yeah. But the thing with the lung infection man, uh, that we've deduced is that there's actually some talent he had. He's on key. He has really good rhythm. You know, it's a little off putting because he is a, he is a leathery man. He's asked about four teeth evenly spaced apart. Yeah. And it's like he took out certainty. How did that work? Perfectly spaced. I did other ones stay, you know, like, like Spartan warriors while the rest of the soldiers die. Realize why is that? He is definitely, you're like, this guy needs more teeth. Yup. But you also realize you can get by with that many teeth, you know? And I never really thought about that until I saw his name. There's so many things he can't eat dark.

Speaker 7:          01:34:53       You can start all, you can pull that off a rib short. Yes, yes. You can eat spare like pork ones are soft. Bobby Lee has no ballers chooses steak in the front of his mouth. Cheery the front teeth. Bobby gets some olders he's doesn't have, he's been without them for so long and he's just used to not choose steak. No good. It's weird. It's weird that he does something weird, right? Such a straight laced normal dude. Such a square doesn't just take his pants off and anyone and presence right now, but you need the front teeth to chew up, like to take a bite of something real important and then you need the backs. The rest are superfluous. But what if he has? What if that guy has great Maulers? That's all you need. Sparkling Ivers but pulls up. He pulls all the brushes back. They're meticulously flosses. He can get them whitened. Who would check that shit out? I will say that guy has no problem flossing. Easy peasy jump school. He might have a nice guy. Okay, what'd you rather pay? You're going to spend about $25 you're going to go to, okay. You're going to watch, you're going to sit, you're going to watch, even if the staying alive guy belong. Infection guy.

Speaker 7:          01:36:13       Yeah, or the grief dancer. Oh, say United state United. Yeah. I like to party. Yeah, that's a funny man. I don't know. I don't need this. If I'm a little fucked up, I'm losing my mind with that guy. He's going to walk on stage and I'm going to turn to the bar and I'd go, everyone gets a drink. It's a good time. You smoke something a little. Like if I get a little hit, a shot, I'd be like say, you know, I'd be like, dude, I do it again and I just start throwing. But he's got to close with stay United. That's true. Although we don't know if he does any others. Maybe he just does that 25 minutes of stay United. So yes, it might be the same song over and over, but that's the one that's doing this for an hour because I know this guy's making a good, like you got hit like a door dealers and it's going to be a lot of people just laughing at him.

Speaker 7:          01:37:23       What a board. A Basketball Jersey. Just as you start to feel bad for him and you're like, man, this is fucked up. He'd be like, I hate your girl's pussy too. And you'd be like, all right man. Hey know what shut up. Is that your lady like you're a pussy. You're like, hey, hey, hey man, fuck man. Take it easy. I got you this, I got you a door deal. He would say the most critical, oh, these guys are wild cards. He's been out in the sun. He's been drinking his whole life. You don't know what's going to get a guy like, like sometimes you see those comics that like idolized, you know those comics that just like, I just say anything, you know the political correctness is my enemy. And so those people that just say something absolutely bananas that he's not funny. That's is between song filler.

Speaker 7:          01:38:14       I never laughed. He's like, no, but I mean, you know she was asleep. Like we're trapped here with him. Like she's your girlfriend and Nah, just some girl I found anyways. Stay United States stay in it. No one clapping. Yeah. Ruin it so fast. I was told that this video I haven't seen, we're supposed to watch it and decide who's out of line because there's two people. Okay. And I think they're in a whole foods. That's what I'm told. I haven't opened it yet, but okay. Let's see if we can agree or disagree that one of the two participants is Adeline. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 14:         01:38:55       We go with that. We have to do the same. You really shouldn't be blocking the handicap and crossing you all any of this, any of this blue, right? No one is supposed to be blocking you at anytime. Thank you. I'll take that into,

Speaker 7:          01:39:12       okay. So I think it's, she's one of the participants, right? And the guy. So she's saying don't, it seems like a reasonable start. Yup. She's like, Hey, you shouldn't be blocking this. Yeah, sure.

Speaker 14:         01:39:23       Picks up. Can you please move out of the handicap plate? Please move the out of the handicap plates. I'm here. You're in the handicap space?

Speaker 7:          01:39:40       No. The thing is they're only briefly like they're just crossing. I wish I had more visual and I don't mean to see her. I don't, I'm not like [inaudible], but like I don't see where is the, let's start. Okay. Do we know it's at right? Blue is handicapped. Yes it is. I didn't know that. I didn't know. I've been guilty of this. Okay. Okay. Okay. He's stamped, but they're not like, it doesn't seem like they're really obstructing. No, she can. She can work around. That middle is worn down, but that's still handicapped. You know what I mean? Right. This whole area. Wait, wait, so this whole thing is considered handicap, right? If you, my understanding is correct. Blue is his handicap. I think you're correct. Yeah. Okay, so she looked, she has a boy. She, she made her point and she said like, you know, he's like, yeah, I'll take that into consideration. Which she definitely didn't mean he wasn't like he was he. Oh yeah. He was already, he was pissed that there was no, there was no, excuse me. Right, right. Which I get it. I mean that's a natural, if we're having a conversation, so we're like, you're really like, okay. Yeah, you do. You know how to, how to interrupt. Right. Even unnecessary interruption. So wait, let's, I think it's about, this is crazy. I think it's going to pick up the pace here. Is that okay? Okay.

Speaker 14:         01:40:51       People are not supposed to force you to get out of this by law. You're not supposed to be going to take it up with management. Okay. How about if I call the police? Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:41:04       Oh, he says you're insane. Okay. She said, I feel like he's getting to butt hurt by her. And in fairness, she does have what sounds like a very grating voice. Yes. You know what I mean? Some of us do. Hey, and she's also a little too on top of it. Right? Like she's looking for a fight. I mean like he's not, it's not like she was like, I'm trying to get into this space and you're blocking it. And My, my suspicious mind is like, who turns on a recording device and in walks up. Oh God, I don't know. That's just me being super suspicious. That's like, oh, I, I try just maybe listening as a fight. Yeah. Someone was like, excuse me. They're waiting for a little bit. Yeah, the scene. The building. Yeah. And it's what the, what the things I'm suspicious of is when it recording starts before usually if someone's like, and it just, it's starts and a cop's yelling at this person, this person probably did escalate.

Speaker 7:          01:42:02       Not the person recording, but they're like, I got, I'm going to record this. You're, you're, yeah. She's what's known as a shit mixer. Yeah. No, I saw, I saw one too where a guy walked up to cops that were like on a scene somewhere and he walks up and they're like, can you stay there? Like, can you stand back and say, I don't have to do shit. Ah, fuck you. And they're like looking at each other like, yeah. And then of course they see the camera doesn't like it does trying to, and it's like I'm, I'm as angry at certain cops as anyone is right now, but it's just like that. Dot. What? What the fuck does that solve? Just one random cops. Yeah. Dude. There's just come up and try you trying to get them to do something crazy with you. Now this bride is looking for trouble. Oh really? Shit.

Speaker 14:         01:42:47       Oh really? You're insane. I'm doing my job. No, but you're doing it illegally. It's not illegal and I'm surprised that you shop yet. Oh, okay.

Speaker 7:          01:42:58       Well lets you got the New England accent. I'm surprised you shop here. Yeah. Oh boy. Yeah. She's, she's upset about something else and then she started to go away. I wish this picked up more where she's talking to management, I think. I think she's going to go walk up and close up. Just stab each of those melons with a knife. I wish. Yeah, that you're insane. You're insane. Yeah. Yeah. She's just rising to one shop. Yeah. Yeah. Which is by the way, the appropriate response to people like this. I think you should just have licensed to tell people they're crazy. No. Yeah. Well, I do feel like that guy could have handled it better and been like, you know, but it's, it's, you know, I can't, it's always funny. How would you, you'd be so annoyed now. Totally. No, no, no, I'm not. I'm really not judging him because I don't know how it would have been that situation.

Speaker 7:          01:43:44       I'm sure it would've been so pissed, you know? But you know, if this person is driving thing with a straw and I, I'm not, I'm just going to be like, ah, okay. You, we'll get out of the way. Sorry, ma'am. Whatever, you know, pending, she's being mommy to, you know what I mean? Right. Too many people that you need to be like, I mean, and also the approach, it's always about, if she could be, she said, excuse me. I don't know if you know this, but you're standing, I don't know if you know what? I didn't know that I'm in my forties I never knew blue as handicapped. Yeah. Not that I would be like, Hey, get outta here. Wheelchair guy.

Speaker 7:          01:44:22       Excuse me. Like the fuck Outta here. So I know nothing makes me laugh harder than just someone being that immediately crazy. Yeah, I know. That's what I'm hoping for with every video I open, just not hold back. I didn't. Same Guy. Yeah. I remember when I was a kid, it was at the time it was horrifying, but I looked back and I laughed so hard that like me and a buddy, we couldn't have been more than eight or nine it, we're in the park and there's a water fountain and there's hardly any water coming out over like maybe four seconds pass by. We're like, I don't know. Ah, this guy behind it. It's like, it's like what? Holding a baby? A grown man. You girls going to drink or not? Both two boys were both two little boys. It's not coming out very well. Well, like stuttering, like just shocked.

Speaker 7:          01:45:12       He's like, well then suck it. And we're like, we just walked away. And Morris, who's that insane to a young boy? Ugly Bagel face? No, no, I don't think. I think Eglise last night, last I heard it ugly, went to MIT. So he's a smart guy. Deep cuts for that. That's a deep cut. Deep, deep. Yeah. Prank. A guy named ugly Bagel face. What we found, we found this the silliest name in the phone book and called him like a thousand times, but very childish. I very great by the way. We were playing, how obnoxious it is earlier when people have, uh, conversations on speaker phone in public, oh, isn't that the worst? Or, or people that watch videos in the airport get your life. I've had two guys that I've said, uh, hey man, do you have headphones? Can use them. And they're like, I don't have them.

Speaker 7:          01:46:00       And I'm like, okay, I don't need to hear that thing. You just turn it down. And I'm like, yeah. And they look at me like I'm crazy. Yeah. It's bold. What? I can't watch my television and public and they look these, literally, this was, I recorded this, this is my recording. That's me. And this is the guy on Bank of America's hold on speakerphone is Starbucks. Do I want to hear about Bank of America's offers? And he's on hold. So he's just playing it. Wow. That's so rude. Yeah. I mean that's so brutal. And he's just leaving it there eating this thing. Everyone's drinking his coffee like hey fuck head. Yeah. But I was telling her like, this guy's a complete fucking oblivious. Like it doesn't give a shit, you know? If you were like, why you doing that? He'd be like, cause

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       I'm on hold.

Speaker 8:          01:46:50       [inaudible] what am I supposed to do? Yeah. Yeah. I don't have a choice. Yeah. I got to hold it to my head. I was going to do that off of speaker phone. No, no. Wait. So you've walked up to people and you've been like, do you have had fun? No, I just look old. Like we were all sitting in the same, uh, gate waiting for the flight. Yeah. And I'm like, hey man, do you have headphones? Can you put those on? I was just saying, I've had phones when you put those on in the same sentence. Yep. So they don't say anything. They're like, I don't have it. It's like the, and that's the same thing. They're like, really? There's nothing I can do. You're forced to listen. And I'm like, all right, can you turn the sound off? And they're like, well, they can't believe it, of course, because it's like, listen, nobody likes confrontation.

Speaker 8:          01:47:30       And I'm not, no, no. I hate it. I hate it so much. I've maybe shushed people two times in the, in the, in the, in the movie theater maybe. Yeah. Maybe I will put up with stuff. I have found out the best neighbors on our CULDESAC. Yeah, the craziest on the other side of the fence, right beneath lay of like a pool and they were up 10 30 [inaudible] trying to go to bed. They're blaring eighties music and sing along to it. And I'm just like, ah, I just go out in the backyard and I'm like, hey guys, past 10, can you, uh, can you turn down? Fuck you, like right away, right away. Like, like by another fucking house. Uh, and he said, but like to each other, not to me just being like, oh, fuck man. Is this your new place, your current place, place?

Speaker 8:          01:48:17       And they're, they're, they're, they're rarely around, but they already, they have a neighborhood rep, uh, as these, as these and it's, and it's super young. No, no. They have two kids. They turn it down. They turned down and they were like, welcome to fucking neighborhood. And I just said thank you. And went inside. It's like I'm not playing your game. I'm not going to be the other. You're going, you're, you're, you're faded. You're not just drunk, you're on something else. I they probably were doing lines or something, but it's like he hits, yeah. Jesus. Jesus. I mean I feel like I kind of live in the neighborhood with parents that do coke. You know what I mean? That's still want that have like the party a little bit. I think maybe Silver Lake more than Los Felix, but like it's, there's still that element and like, uh, yeah. So it's, well,

Speaker 1:          01:49:04       cause they are there in your neighborhood. You have parents who still want to be cool. Yes. Yes. I like Tom and I have surrendered to this game. We're like, listen, we're fucking suburban lanes are still cool though. Cool. I go to the mall only confrontation that I've had with the loud thing, cause I didn't say shit to this psycho, but uh, at the airport gate I saw somebody with a laptop on their lap open. Yes. Facetime calling with that. So they were like, yeah, Brazil. Yeah, I know. And then you hear the person and I just walked in front and I go, how's it going? Like that Nice. And the guy was like, like looked at me like the fuck, how's it going? And he just was like, anyway, so we're going to get on the flight. So he just, he, I just was like,

Speaker 7:          01:49:48       made it myself, be known to him. She was, I was like, you know, you should take your shirt off first. Everybody there, I mean everybody at the gate was looking at this guy like you're crazy. You're crazy guy. Yeah, no, somebody emailed in a loud car because we were talking about it. I'd like to nominate someone for the talk and openly on the phone in public hall of fame while waiting in line at riding a woman, answers her phone, puts it on speakerphone, then hands it to her five year old daughter who is now walking around the store, holding the phone while the mom yells across the store to talk to the person on the phone. It was in fucking sane. Uh, that's for the talking public champs. Yeah, that's, that's, that is totally crazy. We got a good one. We were just in province town, uh, you know, the way the top of the, of, of the, uh, the Cape and in New England and it's, it's the gas town you ever been to, which means the funnest town and is like this great little like beach town. We'd never been, we just wanted to go, we were already on the east coast for like, Oh, let's take a couple of days ago.

Speaker 8:          01:50:45       And the guy who picked us up to get to the airport, like the Lyft driver picks us up real thick, west Indian Jamaican accent, uh, any. And he's like, the phone's ringing. And he's like, he's like, Oh, who's is this? And it turns it up. Then, uh, Jacob o. G h A. R. R. Where are you? You're supposed to be here. No, you said a it dirty. I did not say 30. I did not say 30 and he's like, Jihad, Jihad. Jihad listened to me. She had, and she keeps screaming. She's screaming at him, his employer. And he was like, how'd you go to the hospital? And a g g had stopped yelling. I have people in the car. Are you going to the hospital or are you doing, are you doing left right now? Are you doing left? Right. And we're just like, wow.

Speaker 7:          01:51:27       Oh my God. It was like the most brutal over here. And it went on way too long and you finally like shut it down. But it's like, that would be my nominee for worst. That's a horrible, yeah. Like you don't know your boss's number and you just answer it while people are in the car. Oh, I got by the way, probably a thousand messages and tweets because Russia has appointed Steven Seagal. Yes, I saw your Instagram post. Yeah. Special Representative of humanitarian relations, but sure. U S and arm breaking. He is, I don't know if you know this, this is, you can talk about people talking about themselves. Oh yeah. This is him in the interview.

Speaker 8:          01:52:05       I mean I am the king and then province.

Speaker 7:          01:52:09       Does that make sense? I would believe he's the king of Improv. Steven Seagal probably. Yes, yes, yes. Ans you so hard. Do you know what that actually means? Because I watched more of an interview. I don't go off script. The other actors do and what I do is I'll just change it in the moment. So like while you learned the lines of the script for the movie. Oh yeah. He will just throw stuff out there and you have to figure out, he doesn't do improv comedy Improv. He does. I'm just going to say the lines I want to say. Yup. And scrap the other act or I'm lazy. Yeah, yeah. Like A, here's the lines of scrub. Well, here's what I'm going to say. Yeah. They're like, okay. I mean this is a guy who like God is career career start by being like, he was like a studio execs.

Speaker 7:          01:52:55       Karate trainer. That's right. And the exact would take 'em in in a meetings and let, let's, let's spar. Yeah. Would you put this guy in a movie? Is that right? Yeah, and its story and this was the 80s when it was all cocaine and misogyny know. And so like you know, he came out of that era and probably just never changed. It was just like, no, you come to my trailer, I want a blowjob. Is there anything going on? Is there any more like a that I dropped off your lunch order. Mr Seagal. That's all I'm doing. I know, right? It's like, but could any be, could it be any crazier than they serious?

Speaker 1:          01:53:29       Mostly appointed Steven Seagal. Yeah. Like a special representative that now someone on the US side is going to have to go. Yeah. All right. I'm going to talk to Seagal today about yeah, how we can better.

Speaker 3:          01:53:44       It's, it's in the, we're in the upside down. Donald Trump is president. Steven Seagal is this fucking thing. Hootin and we're best friends now with him. It's, it's all this is absurdity. Yeah. World is done. We're all going to die. Um, it's all
