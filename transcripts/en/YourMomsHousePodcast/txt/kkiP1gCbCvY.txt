Speaker 5:          00:10:38       might be home or my vision. Oh you're a virgin is a fucking third.

Speaker 1:          00:10:42       That's a loose, yeah. No, it has to be, you're such a liar. So you say that sear your sweet guy and I appreciate it. I am not being nice. I'm being honest. I mean it does. I have to picture like I have to picture like eight guys standing behind me just to try to get in there. Like I, I pretend it's a competition and, and they're like, yeah, Tom. Yeah. Like do it up, hurry up. And then I'm like, ah. And then there's other guys orderly way give it to everyone. Like it's the gardeners and it's the fucking what we have gardeners, so how can I get it?

Speaker 5:          00:11:31       Shit for the Indian guy, which is a real thing because we have Jose, he comes by every fucking Wednesday. We talking about like, all right, what does that mean, Dal? Like wave most.

Speaker 4:          00:11:47       I like that.

Speaker 1:          00:11:51       That's giver her eggs. Give her eggs,

Speaker 2:          00:11:56       eggs. This one's fine. I don't know what the fuck he says honestly. Is that Daddy Yankee? I think it is. You wouldn't know pit bull, Huh? POSTER MR worldwide. Do you know that dude? He's, he's ridiculous, right? Yeah, they are. He makes like 35 million easy. Right? Just like giving way was out. What does it mean? Seriously way.

Yeah, always come with those guys. Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:13:10       Savages. Yeah. Guys like to come. What are you going to do this? Isn't that crazy? That basically every decision a guy makes it is connected to coming for you? Not necessarily. Let me mean for me. These guys are that different. But then, but then when guys turn like 50 they become, you know, human like, you know what I'm saying? Like your dad, it became sweeter and now like when the need to come goes down a little, like you guys start to care about helping turtles across the street. I think it doesn't happen at 50 I think you got that wrong. Maybe like 68 that's when the testosterone starts to like dial down and you turn it into women and you become people. It's great. I know I have an uncle who was like, just started crying at 75 and I'm like crying and he's like, it's a sweet moment. Like you were a savage dude. Do you, do you think your dad still comes a lot?

Speaker 2:          00:14:18       Definitely. No, cause he's, he has, he's friends with a lot of older, like older than him and he's like, you know, my buddy, whatever, he takes a pill, my other buddy has to inject himself. Yeah. But he's like, you know, this guy's 81 this guys. And I go, oh man. Like how about you? He like, ah, no, not a problem about like still a lot of lead in the pencil. Not even your old man's doing fine. I'm like that's enough. That's enough information. Enough information about my dad's Dick. So I remember when I saw his balls on the cruise, I still think about it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:14:57       In what way? Like how just like I remember him flipping his leg, her and I was like what there it is as I recall. I recall. Yeah, I remember that. Crazy. Pretty big. They're low hangers though. Like you're going to have nuts to hang low too. I hope so. I can only, I can only dream about having balls that are, sometimes I think about that. Honestly not to hit it again, but I think about it on the toilet. Cause sometimes you're like thinking about toilet water. That's real to your boss touched the water yet. No, no. I mean I have just regular balls. They're not. No, they are. They're really, they're good. I really like him. Come on. I have all the balls and I've touched a lot of balls. Puerto Rico. Yeah. Well, what were they like? Bad Ball am I mean look, one woman's bad ball is another woman's treasure. I don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:16:11       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:16:11       Right. Different strokes. Everyone's the same. So maybe personally, here's my, I just don't, I like him high and tight. I do. I like, Oh yeah, like yours are nice and high and tight. I've had balls that are just all skin like you're like too, so they're too big and there's not, there's nothing in them. It's just, I've never, I've been blowing old guy again. No, they're, they're young guys at that huge nuts, but I usually usually it, the interesting thing Tom really thought provoking that the bigger the balls, I found that the shorter and fatter the wiener, like it would be like a coke can or the balls. Yeah, there were shorts down. Did it affect the loads they busted? No, I'm saying where the big balls when you're like, Jesus, this thing doesn't turn off. Where is it? Like that.

Speaker 3:          00:17:12       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:17:14       No, I mean, what was it like that no, really hoppy on? Do you want to know? Is that the most I have the most,

Speaker 3:          00:17:27       a lot of loan.

Speaker 2:          00:17:28       Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no. I will check off with any of you guys. I'm serious. This is gross, but I'm going to do it any cause, whatever. I mean from high school I had high school, college girls are always like, Jesus, what is up with all this jazz man. I know. And I actually asked the doctor

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       about it once cause you know you have like men have con like I could like it's like a contraction, right? Like yeah, I had, so I went to the doctor, I was like, I was uh, I don't like 18, 19. I was like, look man, I'm busting these huge ass nut. Is that normal? And he was like, what kind of con that's like, so I described it to them in detail and he was like, no, it's not normal. And then, yeah, well he goes, it's, it's, it's, it's a, you know, high, much higher than average. But he goes, yeah, just consider yourself lucky. He's, he said it though, he said it like I've been trying to come like that for years. I dedicated my life to this and you just get it naturally. And I was like, yeah, that's fascinating. I know. I wonder if I'll and want to get into the details. What do, do you think you have more swimmers than most? No. No, I don't think it has anything to do with that. Just the amount of fluid around. Yeah. I just have a great prostate. Wow. I go rob. Rob.

Speaker 3:          00:18:49       Wow.

Forward an issues. Here we go with the important issues of, of, of our show. Here we go.

Speaker 6:          00:19:21       What I'm thinking for Marlene, this is Mike, which is scrub kip. Be Stuck in an elevator fixed. It's not. That was on the phone earlier. 16 [inaudible] out.

Speaker 3:          00:19:36       Oh Shit. Don't bring in one month into this. Well, go to your mom's house, Christina. There it is, right.

Speaker 1:          00:20:39       We are live and breath balls, beach, Florida. That um, so that guy was pretty pissed off. He's talking to an elevator manufacturing rep on the phone. I guess his elevator didn't get fixed when he wanted it to, so he did

Speaker 6:          00:20:58       just talking out my Beta fish.

Speaker 1:          00:21:12       Did he say the slut? I didn't know that. Nobody ever says that. Like get that fucking slut that I was talking to. That's so crazy. It's a tough call over the phone to now she's a slide doesn't, but it's a, it's a good way to provoke. See what happens. Just spoke a little bit. Is that slut still there? And then they're like, excuse me. Nobody likes that. How can call it the, I mean, I guess your elevator not being fixed does piss you off. But this level, this level,

Speaker 6:          00:21:44       okay. I'm sorry I have to deal with people. It's the worst elevator on the world. I'm going to come in and rev it up your fucking noses. Get him here now.

Speaker 1:          00:21:58       Jesus Christ. I, you know what I stands out to me the most about that is that he will shove it up. Your noses like to be that angry and the natural inclination to be, I'll shove up your fucking ass. And he was like, stuff that fucking elevator up your nose. It's almost like he pulled his anger in for a moment. He didn't want to go blue. He was like that's too far. But it probably would hurt more in your nose then your ass. Right. What do you think it would hurt to have an elevator shoved in any orifice so that you have but yeah, your nose. You definitely die for sure. If I put an elevator up your nose. Yeah. That hurts so much. You know I keep thinking about the animal lady this week. Like some clips stick to me. I keep thinking about how Lawrence rain. Is that her name? Yeah. Oh I can show cause it would absorb the toxins like you would die. And what really stood out to me about her just laid, it gave herself a year, an enema. Was that? Yeah, let me bring it up. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Here we go. Fucking sad. Lawrence. Today I'm going to do a urine for the first time for the first time. And you should see like, she's like, like I'm going to see my dad for the first time. She's so tough attached that she's committing to this. She's so skinny today. During the day I have collected this much. I just

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       poured one court and to my animal bucket right above me. You pissed in a bucket is what you're saying and you're going to put it in yet. What happens to you that you get that nutty? Like how does that switch flip where you're like, no, this is healthy. She's a conspiracy theorist for sure. Yeah. Yeah, she is. Cause I, I remember one of my, uh, down here, I went to high school in Vero beach. If you don't know if I run around here and what am I

Speaker 1:          00:24:13       friends' moms was like, you can't trust doctors. Like they'll, they'll fuck with you. I'm like, okay.

Speaker 2:          00:24:21       And like when you're sick too, you know, what should I be like, I'm going to the doctor. She was like, that's stupid. Only an idiot would go to the doctor and then she had all these

Speaker 1:          00:24:29       is alternative therapies, which I'm sure like, I'm not saying that there's no alternative therapy that has, you know, value, but if you, if you keep embracing that only alternative works, then you end up putting your own pissing

Speaker 2:          00:24:45       it gives you are going to die. Yeah, because who was it? Who Was it? Who's dead? The computer guy. Yeah. He was alternative therapy. He had pancreatic cancer, which is aggressive to begin with, is not high

Speaker 1:          00:24:58       chance of beating it. And they found it early and so they were like, we're going to take it out. And he was like, I'm going to eat fruit. And they're like, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:25:06       Right. What? He's like, I fucking made these things. I'm eating fruit. All right. I'm gonna end. The doctor's like, all right. He did make the shit that we're typing on. So, and then a few months later he was like, oh, I fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. That is the equivalent of like, I'm going to get myself. You're an animal. You're right. Gert. And it'll, that's what happens. This lady

Speaker 1:          00:25:31       100% if they were like, you have a brain tumor, we need to operate, she'd be like, I'm going to juggle this week.

Speaker 2:          00:25:35       And they do see what happens. Okay. So I'm laying on my left side and I'm just about to insert the hustle right now during this process. Okay.

I just, I don't know how people have stuff on their butts so easily. I mean, are you getting used to it? You get used to it. You gotta just some of our, I mean, I'm sure there's people in the audience like this. Some of our friends are like, oh yeah, like, you know, we bought fuck pretty regular.

But fucking regularly and giving yourself a piano bar, but all you have to, I mean, shouldn't you give yourself an enema before you have bud Saks? Yeah. Yeah. Or a strong performers do that. It's a very strong performance as a courtesy, I'm assuming. I think it's a courtesy to yourself, man. Makes it easier as wild. Cool. One more time.

Speaker 2:          00:28:09       Whoa. Oh. Oh. This purple vision. She's tripping out purple vision toxins in her bloodstream. Crazy. 10,000 more people coming together and support support me.

Speaker 3:          00:30:09       And, and

Speaker 2:          00:30:17       what's neat about that talent is that sometimes I notice you sign with your left and it looks all retarded. Like you'll be all, wait, what? He looks stupid when you do it. But it's cute. Like you saw it, it looked stupid because it's not right. Like you shouldn't just like when you sign your name, but it got me to thinking what do you do with either hand, which, which hand do you wipe with? Cause I'm not with you at those times. Very thought provoking. I mean all the things it's like, it's automatic. Like I'm just good at everything but I do it like the hand chooses like through the anorexia chooses itself. So I write lefthanded and it looks stupid. I brushed my teeth lefthanded eat with a fork left, I throw a ball right handed, didn't notice that. And I, I prefer to jerk it right handed. I can do it with the other hand.

Speaker 3:          00:31:21       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:31:21       But I prefer especially to finish with the right hand, you know, there's just like, there's just, I know how to,

Speaker 3:          00:31:31       yeah

Speaker 2:          00:31:31       though that your, your subtle moves and especially for like that finishing, you know what I mean? Rounding third, I like to go back to them. Like I can go left, left, left wing up and then it goes to the right hand, you know? So I do that and I definitely wipe right handed. Yeah. Interesting. I think higher skill level things are right handed. Wait a minute, but you write with your left. That's quite possibly the highest skill.

Speaker 3:          00:32:01       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:32:02       Throw a football man right handed. Okay. Yeah. Interesting. In baseball, I shoot right handed. Yeah. Golf, right handed. Not that I do that regularly. But you're not a golfer. I didn't know all this about you. These are all new things. Yeah, I didn't know it. I like learning. We should go out to dinner sometime. Tell you a bunch of stuff if you want to, if you want to find out. I've also been watching you do everything right handed everything. I have known you. This is useless. Why don't you donate it? Why don't you give away? Even when I do polities and stuff, the left side is terrible. It's wonky. It's weaker.

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       I'm totally right dominant, you know? Yes. This talent, it's just being strong and stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:32:46       Okay. But back to you. So

Speaker 5:          00:32:49       notice this week we spent a lot of time together. We've been on vacation here. Uh, you really savor your body functions like more than anybody I know. Like you'll sneeze, like you do this annoying thing where you sneeze like three times in a row. Like it's clearly for attention. But yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:33:06       third time

Speaker 1:          00:33:12       you have to look at the light to get it out. That's the worst. I always look for the light. Oh yeah. And if you say bless you before I sneeze, I'll knock you the fuck.

Speaker 3:          00:33:24       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:33:27       because it will fuck with me. It makes me so upset when you're like on the edge like hot and someone was like bless you, bye. Fuck you. Fuck you. I don't know. It goes away. Yeah. Cause you need, you need total focus. Like when I see you doing your, that doesn't, I don't feel like that's what I look like. I have to stop and let you dig your retarded face and then you sneezing threes and then after it you'll be like, oh that was such good snakes.

Speaker 1:          00:34:01       I like how it feels. Don't you like that feeling now? It's a little, it's a little pleasure. It's not like, I'm not saying it's a myth. If you have like a like three or more in a row and you have that momentary buzz from it, you're like, whoa. It feels good. I like it like that. You'll be like, that was a good cough or that was a good shit or that was such a good shit. Like I don't really enjoy shooting. I just like, and I'm like, Oh God, I feel so fucking good right now. And she's like this golf thing. Like I'll, I'll cue tips. Look like someone dip them in orange paint.

Speaker 3:          00:34:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:48       Jesus Christ. Yeah, we got a lot of waxes. Hereditary. Yeah, that's what my dad told me. I know. It was like, I was like, oh dude, I had a lot of wax. He's like, yes. Genetic, like all excited. I'm like, couldn't, it couldn't be a vertical leap ahead to be fucking ear wax. Sweet. It's just really cool jeans. You got that down. Yeah, but you do like them more than anyone else. It's true. All right. Do you want to go back to this or no, this isn't, what's the, was this? No, he don't like that. Next to the better guy. All right. We're done with elevator guy. The fucking lady ended it. So Christina, it says, I was listening to episode Oh nine this morning. No, was an audio issue. Uh, three 36 in awful sound filled my headphones and it's you, you sneezing. It says, let's see.

Speaker 4:          00:35:52       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:36:05       you have the fucking balls to talk about my

Speaker 4:          00:36:12       the fuck man.

Speaker 5:          00:36:16       But that was so charming. It was like a little like a little dose.

Speaker 1:          00:36:25       That's hideous.

Speaker 5:          00:36:28       Maybe that's why I don't enjoy them.

Speaker 1:          00:36:34       Oh Man. I'm going to set it affected me emotionally and still have not recovered. Also also at 1508, there was a sound of what I think was it touched individual attempting to sing. It was deeply disturbing and hope it was just an equipment issue that can be fixed. And then it says, click here to hear it. Here's this one.

Speaker 7:          00:37:02       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:37:06       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:37:08       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:37:16       Wow.

Speaker 5:          00:37:23       By the way, that's called a perfect impression. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:37:28       Yeah. I'm a huge DNR fan, guys.

Speaker 3:          00:37:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:41       Ah, you can't take your headphones off now, can you?

Speaker 5:          00:37:50       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:37:51       You are fucked now. You guys are all rotten. All of you. You're terrible. You're the worst. Don't do it again. So No, don't do it again. Don't do it again. No, don't do boring things. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:38:08       All right guys. Let's get to some why a major business. First of all, we know a lot of people been writing in about this very important debate that's been raging on in the your mom's house community, and that is whether or not shit's pushed the fart out.

Speaker 4:          00:38:23       Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:38:24       Yeah. Very divisive. Finally, someone is addressing, so

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       this came in from Zachary? Yeah. Hey, Hitler's. I've been thinking about Europe.

Speaker 1:          00:38:41       I know. It's so funny. God dammit. Hitler's every,

Speaker 5:          00:38:50       every one of them starts hailing. Okay. Hang on. Learners. I'd been thinking about your far and shit situation. Any rights. Honestly, I'm deeply offended. Who are we to apply socially constructed roles to shits and farts. Maybe some farts push out shits and some shits. Bush out farts. You excrement. Normative. Binary Standard. Yeah. Should be cast aside and we should just accept that. Farts and shits are fluid. Anyway, I hope. I hope you can get rid of yours says normative constructs and see the light. Keep it high and tight. Thank you Zach. Well, thank you. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:39:36       That's a really good stuff. Yeah. Well that's really interesting. Well, did you want to read something, Tommy? Yeah. Which one? The next one. Well, no. Yeah, on this topic I'm saying, well, a good job. Young Jedi. That was, that was great. I mean, no, once a listener brought it to my attention, I was totally blown away. Yeah. You had me believing far. It's supposed to shit out for years. That's what my mother taught me. That's not true because they're taught me if farts push the shit out. Yeah. When shit was done, there'd be so many parts after it a shit out when shit was out there before. It's not necessarily so Tom Shit's Bush the farts out. Right. So then there should be four. It's at the end of the shit is what you're saying. If our sports the shit out, but we're going the other way on it. You want to even understand this. This is high level stuff.

Speaker 5:          00:40:37       Philosophically speaking. Well, I had an, I had an epiphany on this very topic, uh, as we've been spending time here in Palm Beach, is that I farted the other day and I kept farting and farting and farting and farting with no shit. Okay. And I thought to myself, I thought to myself, can't we have farts for the sake of having them?

Speaker 1:          00:41:03       Why? Oh yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:41:08       Why must all farts have purpose or utility? Oh, he wouldn't really philosophical. Thank you. Yeah. I mean, it's like this capitalistic notion that everything has to have a fucking utility attached to it. You really did. What a farts or just refer to sake, like art first static enjoyment. There's no usefulness to them.

Speaker 1:          00:41:28       Yeah. You're opening my whole mind up again and again. Really interesting stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:41:35       I thought it was super deep, Bro. Thanks guys.

Speaker 1:          00:41:39       Um, here's a, a thought provoker it's also fowl. Uh, it says sub cane. I was sitting in bed after a night at the bars and my girlfriend was vomiting in the bathroom right next to my bedroom after one too many adult beverages. Nope. That's when something amazing happened at the same moment while she barfed it made a sound. Only Chris Jeans I could love. She farted, which raises the question, what do you call it when you puke and Fart at the same time? Keep it high and tight and Paulien by sincerely hot cocoa. Whoa.

Speaker 4:          00:42:18       Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:42:20       What? Do you have a name for that? No, that is a thought. Provoker then you can fart, puke and Fart. I feel like those two go hand in hand because you can't have food poisoning. Yeah. And if you barf and Fart, it could be a bart. I guess I would just call it a Bert and leave it at that. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:42:34       yeah. Well done, Tom. Yeah. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:42:41       you're right. Let's leave it at that. Yeah. Here's another thought. Provoker that came in. I really like this one. Okay. Are you ready? You guys, this is from Gerald. Uh, he writes, can retarded people vote?

Speaker 4:          00:42:56       Whoa. That's such a good question. It's mean,

Speaker 2:          00:43:06       and you go like, come on. But then like a few seconds later, you're like, that's a good question.

Speaker 4:          00:43:11       Like, right, right, right. The answer's yes. Wait, how do you know? Wait, wait, what about retiring people voting?

Speaker 2:          00:43:31       He was voting. Yeah, cause they can't be like, dude, not you.

Speaker 4:          00:43:34       Thank you. Can you go to vote? And they're like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're like, I can't. No, that's true.

Speaker 2:          00:43:46       Someone helped him sign. Well now wait a minute, that's a physical disability. But he was mentally disabled as well. Okay. Yeah. But what if he's like, you know, you know.

Speaker 4:          00:43:58       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:43:59       Like what have you seen when you were like, this guy doesn't know what day it is. You know, like

Speaker 4:          00:44:05       I'm serious. Like can that guy, he cannot, how do you know this though? What?

Speaker 8:          00:44:17       Oh,

Speaker 2:          00:44:19       you retarded. Interesting. And uh, I wonder, I wonder, couldn't can retard it. They can drive clearly can.

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       Yes they can. We learned that as long as you can pass the driving test, you can show up fucking drooling and no, it's true. And if you pass the test, they were like, you passed the test like, but I'm saying for voting, it's your, it's your constitutional right. You're 18. That's true. American. That's the only two prerequisites. I think you would have to be just beyond like they literally, they would have to be like, no, you know, like he was like, ah, like if you can't find your way in the booth, then baby, they can go like you definitely camp. Oh, but so wild. If you're like, I like orange.

Speaker 4:          00:45:12       What? What?

Speaker 1:          00:45:15       That's not crazy. I'm an actor. I'm so offended. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Says, okay, do top dogs. I'd go retarded. Oh yeah. That's my favorite. Where is that? Oh yeah. I go retarded. I go retarded. Yeah, I got retarded. Yeah, it's the best. All right. As I read this one, this is another thought. Provoker. Let's see this one. Yeah. Okay. Hi Hillary. God Damn it. They're all, it's a lot. It's a lot. Do you guys think deaf people are more grossed out by Farge than non deaf people? That's a good question though. I look at it like this. There are other senses are heightened just like blind people, including the smells, but add into the mix. They can't hear them. A silent, but deadly is always worse because it sneaks up on you. Basically. Their whole life is nothing but silent. But then that's from Kevin. Kevin, you're a Goddamn road scholar.

Speaker 1:          00:46:33       And that is true because every time someone could, it could be like super loud and you'd be like, what the fuck man? Yeah. Well they just kick you. It's the warning so you can brace. Right. So when you know the expectation is met, then you know that's true. Yeah. You're, you're, you're, you're, it's always a surprise. Yeah. Let's talk about death. So Jerry Lewis died. Yes. He was, uh, uh, Christina's. Yeah. Not a fan. He was, while speaking of retarded, that was his whole thing. That is true. His whole thing was acting retarded. Um, funny, retarded big teeth and the big glasses. Yeah. Yeah. He, he basically locked down retarded. Um, I mean, that is, that is,

Speaker 4:          00:47:22       ah,

Speaker 1:          00:47:26       that's Jerry Lewis. If you didn't, and he died and they did this thing, the Hollywood reporter, which is, it's really big in, in La that the trades, right? Like the industry news and Hollywood reporter is definitely one of the biggest, they did a special interview where they were interviewing people that are still working in Hollywood over 90 years old and cause this just to be like, well that's what they wanted to know. They're like, why are you doing stop and just relax. But I mean they were also celebrating them, you know, they're like, you're old as fuck and you're still entertaining people and it's pretty, you know, it was probably a, it's a cool thing. The Hollywood reporter calls you, you work in Hollywood, it's a big deal. They go to his house, he allows them into his house. They set up for eight an interview that's going to be in print but also it to air online. And he was such a deck and it's, it's Kinda hilarious. But like he just was like, it's like, why would you even say yes to the interview? That's a thing is that he had, he was a notorious, they don't just show up. They weren't like, you want to do an interview now, you know? No. And he had a bad reputation for being really grumpy towards the end of his life. Yeah. This is pretty funny. This is pretty,

Speaker 9:          00:48:42       we're doing a feature on people who are still working in their nineties. Have you ever thought about retiring? Why was there never a moment that you thought it might be time to retire or you would want? Why? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:48:59       so that the management being the interview, I'd be like, Oh my God,

Speaker 9:          00:49:04       you come from, you come from a generation, a little older and I think of Bob Hope. George Burns.

Speaker 1:          00:49:10       I liked it. He tells a 91 year old guy. You come from a generation a little older. Yeah, no shit. Huh?

Speaker 9:          00:49:16       People you knew, many of whom didn't want to, uh, were, are never retired either. Um, do you see similarities with them? None. None. What do you think drives people like you and to want to keep working? Cause we do it well.

Speaker 1:          00:49:37       Shit. Wait, this is even better. This, this is great. Hold on. Hold on.

Speaker 9:          00:49:42       What's different about performing now for you than say 20 years ago? How has it, how is it different for you?

Speaker 1:          00:49:53       What an inspiring interview, Huh? Hey, here's another lab.

Speaker 9:          00:49:59       Have you made any, do you, how do you keep the material fresh sessions to be, you know, older and you're in, you're performing or does it? How do you keep the material fresh for yourself by working at it?

Speaker 1:          00:50:14       So then if you're this guy, you're like, oh my God. So then he goes like, cause you're out. You're basically willing him to just talk more, not give you one word answer. So he's like, well here's one I know factually you'll have to give me a different answer. He's asked, he's gas. How is

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       Vegas different now than when you started working there? 50 plus years ago, right? 1 million. Which is

Speaker 9:          00:50:36       Vegas different. Totally different. You then when you first came here, what was the first time you you performed at Vegas? 1947 sorry, seven times. What? What face? She's like when you first showed up. It's not, it's the same.

Speaker 2:          00:50:51       Exactly the same. Exactly the same. It's totally that. There were two hotels. You Lying Dick, he, he's so dismissive. Why do the interview if you're not even going to answer the guy? It's so weird.

Speaker 9:          00:51:12       Well, it looks like, is it about being, I wish she could see that. What is it about, how would you describe the place? It doesn't need to be sharp in 1947 what was it? I wasn't a little bit of a dusty cow town. It was, what was it? What was it like Dustin cow town.

Speaker 2:          00:51:36       Well, thanks for the interview, Jerry. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:51:39       Here's the super cut of his answer. Why? Why none? Cause we do it well is not at all. Why working at it? Anyone that's $90. No, no. 1947 it's not, it's the same. Exactly the same Dustin cow town. No, no,

Speaker 2:          00:52:01       you asshole total. I have to admit, I think that's the funniest shit he's ever.

Speaker 3:          00:52:08       Absolutely.

Speaker 2:          00:52:11       I feel like at 91 I would give the same interview, you know? Well that's the thing is once your face starts melting off of your skull, you know what I mean? Like you, that's when you go behind closed doors and just retire. Yeah. You know, just, just give it up. Your Ego and the guy is such a fucking egocentric. Yeah. Torturing people with your existence. At that point. You know what I mean? Just go away and die like the rest of us. Oh my God. Sorry. Is that too dark? It's too old. How do you know where blue jeans came from? You know about this? During the 1950s young America discovered blue jeans and the industry exploded in the United States. It's a hidden appeal club. I had you looking over here. Boom.

Speaker 3:          00:53:13       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:53:14       Do you know the fucking hurt? That was mean. That really hurt actually. You're the Jerry Lewis. That was a dry heave.

Speaker 5:          00:53:30       God, you're terrible. All right. Here's another thought. Provoker so there's no more barf clubs. When food goes right through you, is it the meal you just ate or a prior one being pushed out? Good question. I don't see how it could be the meal you just ate. It can't be, but it feels like it does, but maybe it's pushing the bad food out that you had earlier and that's what's cleaning you out, right? The Prius, the meal that was,

Speaker 1:          00:54:02       I mean, you're getting into medical stuff now. It's making space. Wow. That's what it is. Yesterdays stomach's like fucking get out of here.

Speaker 5:          00:54:23       You also knew the retarded question town.

Speaker 1:          00:54:27       If I can an expert of West Palm Beach. Huh? Do you want to do a master of accents? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally. Okay, so this came in. Let's see what this is here. This is a, I have like a fucking God damn nat. Alright, so this is Scottish. Woof Blatz a toughie. This couple is on the Jeremy Kyle show confronting each other about cheating. Oh, all right. Let's see if you guys can figure out what's

Speaker 2:          00:54:56       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:55:02       that was English. Just so you know.

Speaker 2:          00:55:06       No, I heard it's not, I know what you thought it was.

Speaker 1:          00:55:28       Good n word. No, no, no, no. It sounds like it. I heard big words too. I heard you know what? Yeah. And she said it's clear. She said it's clear.

Speaker 10:         00:55:47       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:55:49       it was clear something obviously she said obviously. Oh honestly, okay. Fucking show offs and then, and then

Speaker 2:          00:56:10       mine I think.

And then, Oh man, good. She's saying the n word conversation. So now you're going to say, see when you finally get the balls to admit it, you're going to say one or two lassies. That's what the whole thing. That's what she says. I swear to you. Yes it is. She's racist. Two losses. I heard. That's what she says. Well, the philosophy here, Scottish, do you not think she's saying that you think the translation is wrong? She says the n word conversation with no, she doesn't. No, I know. I'm sure the translation is accurate. I just don't, you know that's crazy. That's crazy that that is English. Maths, English. Damn, that is, that is English when I,

So you have a guy who for 50 years, he's just been like touching his dick, talking about his dick, talking about sex. So maybe it'd be like the most mind blowing sexual experience. You could ever know why he's such an expert. So sharp.

Speaker 1:          01:12:42       That's how you see it to get in. Get it out. But what about, that's the thing in this scenario, what's supposed to be happening is these guys are going to town for like hours, so you can't really think of it as in and out. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:13:03       Maybe she's got a good point. Wait, hold on. The lady in the front just said the rub rub guy is going to be counting out like one.

Speaker 1:          01:17:00       I'll say this before we get started with, would you rather you have a gift for these? You really do. You've come up with some of the best ones ever. They come out of you like that.

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       It's amazing. Yeah. It's because I understand suffering and no, I feel like I, I feel like I like what is misery? The would you rather choose really good. Thank you. No thank guys. Please, let's go. Okay. Okay. What'd you rather? Yeah, I like, what'd you rather wear? A fart helmet. What's a fart helmet? It's my own design. So a fart helmet is, it's a tube that's hooked up to your butthole and then it's connected to like a space helmet. Like what? You were like a mask? Yeah, so far mass. Oh, they did? Okay. So, but every Fart, it's in your face and you're smelling it all day. Do you smelling your own farts all day, all day or, or you pee in a mason jar, but you carry it with you everywhere and you're like, you have to do, you have to talk about it. Talk about it. Like I know some giant, you meet people, you're like, this is my urine. Hi. Believe in keeping all of it. I can get you a jar if you would like and introduce you to the lifestyle or just smell your own farm with a mask on. Right. Do you realize that? Like as crazy as you look to people when you're like, this is my urine. Uh, if you walk into the bank with your fart mask on, it's just, they're pressing the button under the desk immediately. Right,

Speaker 2:          01:18:45       right. Well that, that's what I'm saying is that either scenario is a life ruiner. No, they definitely ruin your life. You're kind of, you come up with these. I just think about what will be the most horrible shit in the world. Yeah. Like a fart helmet. It's gonna it's a mask, right? It's hard to perform. It's hard to carve. The performs your standup career is over. Like you can't call the club, make sure you have the mic inside my mask. So I don't miss any farts while I'm up there. No, they won't. They won't hook you up with that. Yeah, but you could put your urine mason jar down. Well then that disqualifies you from a lot, like imagine having to do Conan and then you're like, and he's like, what's that tongue? And then I tell him and he's like, we'll be right back. Well, interesting. You should ask. Yeah. Starred, urinated on his Mason Jar. Yeah, that's a thing. Your life is ruined. It's pretty awful, but I still think you have some chance, you know, like some people would not notice your mason jar. Some people will be like, okay, and kind of, you know what I mean? Kind of move on, move on. I think you have to go mason jar. A fart mask is 100% you got it. You should have tin foil on your head too. Like you. You can't,

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       no one's going to talk to you. I call it a fart. Hell, you say helmet, but you're describing a mess. It's over your, your face is concealed. And then when people were like, are you scared about the apocalypse? You know, or how I have a fart tube going from the my ass to my mouth and they're like, I'll see you later. And I always walk away. So hundred percent mason jar.

Speaker 5:          01:20:28       Yeah. I'll take the mason jar too. It's apple. Exactly. You have a story and then they're like, can I have some of the essence of it is you have to tell people like, I've decided to do this thing. I collect my urine. That's the craziness, and then I go, have you ever read a urine enema and then they're like, you have to, you have to preach the gospel or the exit over there if you don't mind. All right. What are you going? I'm going to take a, I'm going to take the mason jar to mason jar. Clap for a Mason Mason jar?

Speaker 4:          01:21:00       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:21:04       Fart helmet.

Speaker 1:          01:21:07       Wow. There's some nasty ass girls in the crowd.

Speaker 4:          01:21:12       How could you what?

Speaker 1:          01:21:16       You like your own brand, but your job is over. There's no way your boss is like, it's cool. You worked from home. Do you have, are you in a relationship?

It's a brand. Okay. All right, moving along. Here's my second one. Okay. Okay. Okay. Would you rather, would you rather be Vegan, but you're one of those vegans that you have to fucking talk about it. 24 seven. I want it to be respectful. I'm sure there's a few litter, not proselytizers, but you're the annoying kind. Okay. And you're constantly proselytizing. Every time someone is with you, like a hobo shoes are leather and rice and you talk about your smoothies all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:22:53       I like bees are, are uh, suffering when you eat honey and you're like, yeah, yeah, you're one of those annoying people who doesn't eat anything on the menu. So when we go out, you're always like, is there dairy in at that lactose

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       freeze that gluten free is a, so like all you can eat is like five things and you're a pain in the ass to every real fucking fun guide for, okay. Or You have to listen to me whistle constantly. Hundred percent cutting meat out of my life. 100% I fucking hate listening to whistle. Whistle for them. Whistle for them. That's terrible. That's terrible. No, no. I'm already listen. No, I'm not having any dairy tomorrow. I'm not. No, no. That was terrible. That was terrible. It was terrible. I know.

Speaker 4:          01:23:59       So

Speaker 2:          01:24:03       I, okay. That would be rough though. That mean what you're proposing is really difficult. That's terrible. I would either I annoy the shit out of you or you annoy the shit out of everybody. That's a scenario and I would miss that food for sure. That's what's fucked up. But yeah, but hearing you obviously sounds worse. Waistline. Yeah. This is the thing is it's not the, her whistle is bad. It's that it would be constant. It would be, yeah. But even when I hear the world class Whistler's I'm still like, well, you'd knock that shit off, please. Yeah, it's horrible. I hate when people do it indoors, you know, like waiting in line at the bank and the guy's like, and you're like, are you fucking serious right now? He's asserting dominance. That's what they're doing is, yes, there is that territory is a psychological reason, you know, 100% starting there. This is my territory and then has to fucking listen to me whistle dish fucking I hate them. I said, yeah, I think you would rather fucking go vegan. They listened to your cell phone. That would be a real asshole. Would rather listen to Christina whistling all day every day

Speaker 2:          01:25:13       and who would rather go vegan and listened to her waist. So it's Kinda close proselytizing Megan. Yeah, I'd be, I'd be real annoying. Okay. Yeah. One last one. Okay. This is, this is more gross. Would you rather never floss? You're done flossing. Some of you pigs aren't doing it already. Okay. Yeah. Or when you dump, you're only allowed to wipe once.

Speaker 4:          01:25:40       Ooh,

Speaker 2:          01:25:46       wow. Wow. Heated debate in here. Let the conversation just feels like like a period piece. Yeah. They're like, we're going to allow women in the workforce and everyone's like, what's going on? That was such a sincere reaction. They were like, whoa, lady, whoa. I really can't take a big stinky shit after I go. I don't use toilet paper are flush the toilet and get my hand that get in here three roughly and then flush again. 84 five he's nasty as hell. One white dude. You'd be, yeah, these are great questions. Okay. Order order here, here. And this particular scenario we are dealing with, but de Lis, oh God dammit. He's absolutely brilliant. Would you rather and you will entertain these thoughts?

Speaker 4:          01:27:11       Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:27:13       This triple d slept wife has,

Speaker 4:          01:27:15       boy,

Speaker 2:          01:27:21       no, it is a thing. The reason I choose a day less toilet is because those are the every man's scenario. Hold on, hold on. What you, what you propose is so absurd and I actually forgot what the other option is.

Speaker 4:          01:27:37       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:27:37       What in the hell was the other? No flossing. Flossing you are. You are 51 50 if you choose one, wipe over. Not Philosophy again. Are you out of your guide here? Hold on. I'm going to revise it in the moment because I feel there's a better option than the flossing. Would you rather have one wipe? Yes or not wash your hands for a year.

Speaker 4:          01:28:09       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:28:09       And that's a better, would you rather you could do that? You could do that again would be, hey, there's that fucking psycho that wears gloves everywhere, but it's better than being like, Hey, here's that guy that smells like fucking piles of shit because he listens to a podcast. Yes, a way around such a conundrum of the one lab is to take a shower every time you'll make a bowel movement.

Speaker 4:          01:28:46       That's it, right?

Speaker 2:          01:28:49       That's the, that's the work around. If you will, a appeal denied. That is not acceptable. That is not acceptable. So

Speaker 5:          01:29:03       well, no, no, no. This is, this is not the, so now listen, if you do the one wipe, okay, this is, you can wash your hands as much as you like. Now that's the caveat. So you can one meaningful wipe goes a long way. Hey, there are some shits I take that only require one.

Speaker 1:          01:29:16       Get the fuck Outta here, man. What are you thinking Tom? I mean if you don't wash your hands for a year, you're fucked in a lot of ways. I mean, you really are. Think about all the time. Take it for granted. Oh, that's not crazy. I'm taking a shower like that. You're just like women and men of the GSA in the shower.

Speaker 3:          01:29:52       This, this gentleman,

Speaker 5:          01:29:56       you bring up a valid point. What's the point? What? What do you do to work? Okay. You may put plastic baggies over your hands in the shower. Okay. To to wash it like you ever have a cast on your arm and you have to cover it.

Speaker 1:          01:30:09       You can do that. What? Sweetie? I can't hear you. There's, there's, that's what the Supreme Court would hear. How are you going to wash your asshole if you can't get your hands?

Speaker 5:          01:30:27       No, no, easily. Okay. I covered them in play. I cover them in plastic baggies. They're airtight because it's so serious and you are have a washcloth, which I'm opposed to using in regular life, but because of this thing I have to and I wash cloth. My asshole. Easy peasy dude. Yeah. Fucking loofa that shit dude.

Speaker 1:          01:30:46       No plastic bags. No, no. Yeah, that's true. You're suggesting what a fucking would you rather, I mean this is Charlottesville all over again.

Speaker 3:          01:31:07       This is crazy.

Speaker 5:          01:31:13       Very divisive issue. Why are you choosing hand washing, hand washing or one wipe Dapa go forward. Tom, what's your aunt's or final answer? We need it.

Speaker 1:          01:31:25       Um, I think one way. Dot Gov one wipe.com. I think I would definitely, I would be the gnarly hands, dude. I would just walk around with unwashed hands. I cannot be one wipe guy. You gotta be kidding me? There'd be times, there would be times when you're like, I just can't jump in the shower and you could not, I could not go through life. Like why you shrugging like Eh, whatever. There,

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       there are many one white, but you can shower after. So that's why I'm saying no.

Speaker 4:          01:32:07       What's that number again? He shut what? What happens to demolition? He scoops with that.

Speaker 2:          01:32:19       All right. This is getting, I haven't seen in years. All right, look, look at all the fucking, all right, let's fucking take a vote. Yeah, let's think about, okay. Who votes for they know hand washing for a one year. Go ahead.

Speaker 3:          01:32:32       Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:32:39       Who votes for one wipe dumps? Do you hear that? Sounded like that sounded like more women did the one wipe down. But I think as our shits are not as Nilan.
