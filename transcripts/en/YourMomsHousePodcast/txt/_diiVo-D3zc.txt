Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Well. Well, well go to your mom's house, Christina,

Speaker 2:          00:00:21       your mom's house podcast. Come for the moose soup. Stay for Christina's sour dry personality. There you go. That was very rude. Uh, welcome. Created that. That is Jake Glazer. He's a voiceover artist. Certainly is. I have a few. I have a great bunch of submissions of his good. They're good. Well, he's outstandingly talented, but I'm not sure I approve of the message. Why not? It's a bunch of has coming in here. You're going to be impressed by it. I'll give you, I'll give you a taste of one more. Okay. Your mom's house podcast with a black people yell louder and the White People fart harder. Oh, I like that. Yeah. What an astute observation too. It's funny, I never would have like written that, but you know. Hmm. Well there you go. Pretty funny. Yeah, the whites do for it harder here. They do. Hey, speaking of, did you hear my fart last night at two in the morning?

Speaker 2:          00:01:22       No, Bay by, I didn't know it was asleep. Two o'clock. No warning. I know you didn't hear the baby crying. It's weird how men don't seem to hear, uh, infant crying, but maybe was howling and I went down there, I came back and I let out such a huge fart. And it was really hoping to wake you up at that point. Well, did I? No, of course not. I'm not that I can tell. I don't just ignore that cries. I honestly don't hear the farts either. So, and I thought I had to shit last night at two in the morning, which I, that's your move. Yeah. That is my move. It's also a good story because this morning I woke up to, you know, last night I thought I was going to shit at two in the morning, but I didn't. It was like, okay, why do you want me to hold my stories from you? I thought were married. That's the whole point is that we share. No, you're right. We are. We're worried. We're two mommies. One gene. Yeah. I don't forget. We're definitely one thing. Yeah, that's what, that's why we share a pair. Yeah, absolutely. Wait, so how's our, how's our dogs?

Speaker 3:          00:02:23       Our dog's butt hole. Yeah. The others, they're running the test that they, that they run for for itchy butt holes. Is that right? Yeah, they do a urine analysis because they, they, they think that it could be that her badge is bothered and it looks like it's her butthole. Okay. So they're doing that. They have a fecal sample now they test for like parasites and see if that's what's what's bugging it. And then they already did the actual anal expression in the exam to see if there was something that stood out. They ask you to lick it and taste it. Yeah, they said a funny, that vet goes, I also to examine

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       you at the same time. And I was like, that's weird why? He goes, well a lot of times the owner and the pad, it's like super advanced theory, but they could be, you know, mimicking each other. And I said that's above my pay grade, so go for it man. So he did, he that he fingered me. He expressed your anal glands. So how'd that feel? Felt great. Felt great. Was it now the vet that you saw today, was it, was it the Zim zero one or was it the no, no, no, it was a dude. Are you presuming or straight up why? I'm presuming, but it is, yeah, he identified as male. Yeah. I think I know. Is he like, yeah, Kinda Kinda sloppy, goofy kind of sweet guy. Yeah. I guess is he crazy about Brussels? Griffon I mean he, he, he didn't specify that and he was definitely really sweet with her.

Speaker 2:          00:03:50       What Betsy? Yeah. Yeah. Cause I, when I brought her in there to get her anal glands expressed about a month ago, there was like a sloppy, floppy, endearing that he was really into her. He's like, oh my God, I never see the Brussels. I'm like, I know they're special. Rare like me, my personality. Hello. Hello? Hello? Um, did he tell you what she was thinking? No, that is my pet peeve though. Hell, that is one of my, like my ultimate pet peeves. I can't believe I haven't taken it on stage yet. I need to, I think I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna shoot this special in a few weeks and then my next hour is going to be called what your dog is thinking or what she's thinking. What do you think Betsy is thinking? Well, you know, um, your dog is feeling a little sad, a little anxious, but also hopeful.

Speaker 2:          00:04:39       Uh, Ben, this is something we've observed in dogs for years. I was like hopeful. And then did your dog, did the dog report that to you when it did the uh, the list, the check off list? Well she's a Gemini. Did she tell you that? The birth month, but yeah, so dancer leaning, uh, you know, it was great about Fifo. So you took bitsy separately to the vet and fefe was left behind and I thought for sure fief would be like really upset. You know, why does busy didn't give a shit was like, oh you're gone. Great. And just that surprise, he didn't feel a lick of anxiety. Usually he's got major anxiety. Yeah, he's such a mental case. Fifo but didn't give one shit the busy, it was just pulled that one. Cause I really, I think that's my favorite part of the whole thing. I think so. I think it's, you guys are doing good and she says it twice. It's grammatically incorrect. Yeah. Well I believe is the relative. It makes me crazy. She's really integrate. Yeah. There's, there's all kinds of great stuff when she goes dirty bitch. Yeah. Is that what she says? Dirty. Dirty. Yes. That's weird. Oh yeah. And

Speaker 4:          00:06:08       Gee, you guys are doing good.

Speaker 2:          00:06:15       Yeah, she's awesome. Don't forget your moose soup shirts are now

Speaker 4:          00:06:20       are,

Speaker 2:          00:06:21       well, the shirt actually have a big announcement start. You don't normally do this, but I'll save it for during the show. Let's get this show started normally and then we, I guess shitty later. All right, let's start our show. Let's go here. Oh, and g, welcome to another episode of Your Mom's house. Here we go.

Speaker 5:          00:06:43       Hi Melanie. Stadio carts. Tantra. I was just wanting to share that there are many ways to orgasm. You don't actually have to be having sex orgasm just from hugging. Ah, ah. Ah,

Speaker 2:          00:07:05       okay.

Speaker 5:          00:07:07       How old is Ryan? Don't bring anyone loving.

Speaker 1:          00:07:13       Well, we'll go to your mom's house. Christina. Pledges. It's interesting.

Speaker 4:          00:08:01       You guys are doing good.

Speaker 2:          00:08:07       You love him. She's your, your first grade teacher. Oh my God. Can I tell you how much I hate anybody that engages in any form of Tantra? Oh my God, this shit really gets under my skin. I hate how happy they are. I hate how expressive they're fucking misguided faces. Look, uh, and I, I really hated the fucking orgasm. It was so stupid. There wasn't an orgasm. Faker shaking. And he's like, oh my God, that hug. Fuck you man. Fuck You X. Right? Yeah. Why? I feel like I hated it. And look by that they look like tantra practice. That's the thing is that there's always, oh look, yeah. Doing that thing.

Speaker 2:          00:08:54       Like it's so sensual. That's the new I like. I like, I like fucking, I think, what are you doing? You're putting your tongue over your teeth. That's like the Maria Omg Maria phase. That's like, I feel like that's the version now of like a, like a mouth, a little open. It's always the same dough. I, you know, pie to kind of dopey. Like they just need something. That was like eight years, something like that. Yeah. He's a rapper. He's right. Who Do you think introduced hurts? Is US amazing now. Well that's a thank come when you hug. These are, these are lost souls. People who haven't found Christ, but they find the tantric horse shit. You know what I mean? Like they're one seminar away from giving 20% of their income to Scientology. Like they're just, they're right. If they just took a different door, you know, but they're, they're finding tantra.

Speaker 2:          00:09:53       Tantra, I guess is the contrast. People who sign up for come hugging don't get what they signed up for. I bet most people are like, I dunno, I keep hugging but I'm still not coming. And then they're like, he's just, he's got to let it go more. And then it's basically like speaking in tongues in these, you know, Pentecostal churches or it's like, how'd that happen? And they're like, well, that guy's kind of throwing a little extra spice on that. There's a little hot sauce on there that you might not know about. And it's called faking it. Schizophrenia. Yeah. You got to buy in to the Koolaid, you have to drink it all. Get on board.

Speaker 6:          00:10:32       Especially when you start to see everything can be touching your body all over eating.

Speaker 2:          00:10:49       All I do is come on this woman all day, every day. Do you think they have small children at home? These types? No. Look, I know these people have nothing in their lives then hold them down. You have so much free time. How much free time to be able to engage in Tantra? Nothing but time. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:11:09       Ah,

Speaker 2:          00:11:13       but do you think he's really nutting and his shorts? No, of course. Sure. Is it a dry rub? Like the Rub Rub guy? Well that's, that is there. That would help. But I don't think that's what's happening. But he says you can have an orgasm inside the rub rub. Well, I've got, yeah, he, you can and I don't, I don't doubt that, but I don't doubt that. But Rob, Rob, rob, you know what's the problem with all this stuff is, you know what? I am happy when people find happiness in, in horse shit like this. Yeah. But if they're paying money to go to a seminar, 100% and it's like a thousand dollars a day to learn how to come hug. Yeah. It's like, oh fuck. Don't stop taking advantage of these poor souls who just need Jesus. That's how they make their money. Taking advantage of hate it. It'd be great to come when I hug.

Speaker 2:          00:12:13       If only there were a seminar, I could pay $1,000 I'm all alone when I come. I could come in public on it. I probably my day way better. I mean honestly, I was thinking about that too. That would be great if I'd be like, you mean I can just start giving hugs? Towns are coming. Yeah, that'd be great. But of course there's the part of my brain that goes, oh, that's not happening. You're not going to do that. Of course. Well, and also don't you think it's really messy? You could have come in your pants all day. Oh yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:12:39       It's not.

Speaker 2:          00:12:43       That happens every time you hug, you can out of your mom. Aww. How your mom, your dad like that. Okay. Okay. Well, what if that's the gift is that you can come hug, but it's everybody. It's indiscriminate. Come hugging. So you hug your mother. Hello. You're coming. You're dad, you're coming. Now you can also hug. You know Josh Potter. You're retarded. I'd rather be retarded. I think his phrasing is just, I go retarded. Get amazing. I ride. Okay, but, but listen, you like the feature of the come hug, but it has to be indiscriminate. That's a thing. That's a problem. That's a real problem. Yeah. It's why I'm going to keep not coming when I hug because I do want it to be descriptive. But you like the come hug is what I'm saying. I do like the concept of a comma, right? Yeah. So would you rather have the chem hug but it's indiscriminate? Yeah. Whoever, whatever. Uh, all my friends like, come on Ryan. I come on. Are you full charge Joe? Yeah. All of them. How are we talking about hugging my, come on. Yeah. You say hi to alley the comedy store or be retarded. I mean, it's a real simple, I go retarded. I'd be retarded for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:14:11       What would you do? Oh, well a woman's orgasm is a little more discreet and I won't have a load in my pants. Yeah, but you'd have, I don't see my role to do that thing where people would be like, what's you'd have to deal with? Every time we go on, like, what's going on? You have to be like, can we second? You have to finish coming as they go. Like, oh no, your hands would go like, all right, all right in the hands, kind of back off of you. Then you go, so, um, good to see you. And then they're going to like, I dunno. Cause, and everybody would feel like they'd be like, it's a little presumptuous to think she just came in my arms, but they would think wrong with you. Right. But I could lie and tell them that I'm having seizures and it's induced by touch.

Speaker 2:          00:14:59       It's a touch seizure. They won't, nobody will know. Now here's the one problem, because I don't seem family. Who Cares? My Mom's dead on the, her hug her, but hugging my son does the problem. Oh yeah. That'll, that's a lifetime of calm hugs with our boy. I can't do that. That's not cool. That's true. That's the one reason I choose retarded. Just for that. Yeah. Otherwise I would come hug. I don't care. God Damn. I just want to hug people as much, I guess. Yeah, I guess so, right? Yeah. Hey, can you move my camera up a little? Can I move your camera up a little? I feel like my, the top of my heads being cut off. Oh, it moved? Yeah, I didn't do that. When does that happen? I have no idea. Yeah, right. Yeah. Cause my head looks like it's being cut off. It's odd. I didn't touch that camera and maybe accidentally it was moved. Bumped.

Speaker 8:          00:15:53       Hello? Yeah, right. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:15:57       O and g it doing good. You done real good?

Speaker 8:          00:16:06       Uh

Speaker 2:          00:16:07       Oh yeah. Oh, it's way better. God, that was weird. No, O m g clue. Oh, that one. I moved for that Steve Pro. So make sure that that's framed right. O n. G

Speaker 8:          00:16:24       no, that's about right. That's cool. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:16:28       Okay. I want to get your moose suit. It's really weird, man. I mean, unless I was was in here and now we're back. Now we're here. All right. You guys are doing good. Okay. Aren't you glad? I mean, of all the stations in life to be born into that, that that wasn't your, your mom, you know. Oh my God, that's such a crap shoot. It's such a crapshoot who, who you're born to and where I want to think about that. When I think about how blessed I am that I was born in like I was in what was, you know, close enough to America. Yeah. It could have been, it could have been fucking really nuts. But you would also think that that's normal for a long time. No, I was reading something on the Internet about people in Hong Kong who live in coffin apartments.

Speaker 2:          00:17:16       Have you seen this shit? No. It's like, it's like, you know, people that drive cabs are our security guards and can't afford the cost of living in Hong Kong. Yeah. They pay something like $300 a month and they live in what are basically like 125 square feet. Coffins. It's terrible. And their TV there, you know, toilet, their kitchen sink, everything is in one narrow rectangle and they sleep in it. They do everything so horrible. And then you start thinking yourself. Yeah, but why don't you just live somewhere else? Why worry? Why don't you move to not Hong Kong and go live where there's more space and cost of living's cheaper. Dude, people just love those. You know what the, that's the same thing that people do in a, and I feel like in New York especially. Yeah, that's true. It's just like they go, I don't care. I will live. I will pay to live here. I don't care what's inside of this. Yeah. Well the hope being that you'll improve your, you know, your income level and you'll eventually not have four roommates or the whole thing for you is that the value is based on living in, in that area. It is. Yeah. Again, but you're, you're in New York City. Well that's true. Maybe in Hong Kong. It's the same here. Like I'm going to move on up like the fucking Jefferson.

Speaker 3:          00:18:22       So this is, um, from the description on this video, by the way, we were watching a study revealed that one in three women have trouble reaching orgasm during sex, or the research reveal that eight out of 10 women fake it meet the lucky couple who have an orgasm from hugging husband and wife can orgasm through anything from lovemaking, breathing, dancing to the weather conditions. They're from Texas. They have full body orgasms that lasts as long as 18 hours. They're so connected. If one of them has an orgasm in the same room without touching, the other automatically does as well. Okay. And the married couple of eight years believes that anyone can learn to do this thing. Okay. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:19:02       Has there been scientific tests? So, no, I live in like experiments verifying these bands. I don't think so. I think there's, this is a lot of acting lice. Yeah. Lies acting. It's just like the gays. Yeah. I wish you and I were that connected. Why don't we have no, I'm good. That's too much connection. Todd. Todd Tra? Or is it Tantra? Tantra. Tantra is how much is it Taro readings or Taro? Great question. Well, I listened to these, you know, nut bags on Hay House radio sometimes and they have people that talk to angels and people that talk to dogs and stab pet psychics. I love it. And sometimes they do say it that way. They're like, the Taro is calling your name $5 a minute and you're like, okay, I know it's not true. A,

Speaker 3:          00:19:48       by the way, born George [inaudible] I have to say thank you Mel. C Two Montreal. I was in Montreal this week.

Speaker 2:          00:19:56       Did you have poutines I had a little bite or two. Yeah, I should. It's delish. Did you have a waffle? Like I told you too, I did not have a waffle. Huh?

Speaker 3:          00:20:05       But I had, um, no, I had delicious food. I had a great, great show at Olympia. And then I also went to a Hampton Beach, which the fun thing about a tour like this where I've gone extensively touring to so many places is hitting cities where you're like, you have no expectations. You have low expectations because you're like, I've never even heard of this. I was so confused by Hampton Beach, New Hampshire. I thought I was going to

Speaker 2:          00:20:30       Hamptons. That's what I would have thought. Yeah. All I know is not la. I know. That's what you think. I still don't wear show was crazy there then Wilmington Delaware had no, I know. Or Delaware has no idea where the original colonies didn't have a clue where it was. I mean, I knew was the northeast, that was all

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       I knew. Yeah, I've heard of it. And then balls and whores, Maryland. Yeah. Went fucking off man. Just so you know, uh, I mean if you were at that show in my estimation for just as far as like fun and reaction from the crowd, that had to be a top five show on this tour. That's awesome. And Ryan was there, sickle cell went up there. He did his thing. Josh Potter. Yeah. They, um, that yet. They were great. They were fantastic. But the crowd was so fucking hyped, you know? And that's honestly, that's all comics are ever looking for. Like when they get time, I loved it. And you're like, why did you love that show? Because the, the fucking show was great. Yeah, because the crowd was great. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:21:33       They're on board. They get it. There's no judgment. There's no, you know, booing moment.

Speaker 3:          00:21:40       You know what it's like from the moment you walk out, you know? Yeah. Yeah. If an, if, if two seconds in you're like, Oh God, this is going to be crazy. I know. It was like that. So anyways, thank God. What a blessing in the skies. Nice. Yeah, because sometimes like I don't, I mean I can't look at this tour and be like, that show was, well actually there's a couple of hours like oof. And I don't, I feel like they didn't know how bad I thought the show was, which is good. You don't want to tell him that this was terrible. Yeah. But there was a couple where I was like, Jesus, but there's some that were really fucking crazy. Yeah. Like there was Montclair, New Jersey. I never thought I'd never heard of that place. I didn't think that would I, that was another one where I was like, I've never even heard of this place. And that is your jam jam in Seattle, which I've heard of and I think it

Speaker 2:          00:22:27       towns, those shows were fucking dare always jamming on the one. They were pretty crazy. Always jamming on the one I got really lucky. Chicago always jamming on the one. Yeah. Uh, am I special taping that first cry was fucking bananas. What a what a luck. I'm watching because I'm editing it all now and you're like big. Those fuckers stood up the minute I got out there. Like they gave me a standing ovation. Went just standing there. It was crazy. It was so lucky. What if, what a fortune fortuitous event, if that's the right word. I don't know. You know, it never goes down like that. Stand up. You get a show like that once every, that's what I'm, that's what I'm saying, right? Like, and when you have one of those at a taping. Yeah. Like come on, you're fucking like, oh my God. Lightening in a mother fucking tantric bottle.

Speaker 2:          00:23:08       Yup. You just want to keep getting coming all you want to do it again and come man, can I tell you what our toddler son did today? Yeah. Quick rundown. Yeah. So this morning, uh, you were running around doing stuff and I was taking care of our son by ourselves because our nanny, our beloved amazed nanny's visiting relatives in Guatemala. So we, our nanny less. It's just the two of us. Real people. How can we survive? Oh, working stiffs and uh, I mean, look, we're up at the crack of six. Yeah, we're at the playground. I'm chasing this kid. He runs off into fields. We come home. Uh, he's flipped over the dog water bowl. There's water everywhere. He sloshing around dog water hands. He takes at any strips down. He's in his die, die, rips his diet for off, pisses in the playroom. Just pisses on one of his toys like that walker toy, like he's hiding behind it.

Speaker 2:          00:24:02       And then all of a sudden I see all this water. I'm like, are you peeing? And they did. And then he does it again. Come back. And they like 10 minutes later he's like pulling down that died, died. Pisses right on the tiles. Like he wants to Piss into something, right? Yeah, he does. So I think that's what the sign is. So I showed him the toilet and I explained to him like, Hey, you need to tell her one more fucking time. I will crack your fucking jaw if you ever yeah. You do that or no? Yeah. And your penis isn't dirty and wrong. Yup. It's disgusting rule. That's how I've heard to do it. You telling me do this one more fucking time? You're going to catch the back of my hand. Yup. Yup. You know my Nana, uh, in Hungary, my Hungarian Nana used to time my uncle to the toilet.

Speaker 2:          00:24:43       Like tie him with a rope to toilet, train him. Do you think that's cool? No. He might have bathroom issues today. She also dressed him up like a girl until he was five. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure he's fine. They were really good at child development. It sounds like in the old world. Yeah. Can, isn't that nuts. So that, that's kind of what that is. What they assume, like you're born with an adult brain in a baby body. Yeah. It doesn't make like, how can they even assume that? And I think that for the most part it seems like every generation does way better. Right then the last one, well, theoretically, yeah, but like our parents generation there was good and bad in it, but they're way better than the generation. My Nana, who's a total barbarian, my dad said that

Speaker 3:          00:25:34       he had a pretty, like they had a good relationship, you know, the parents, but it was also like pretty formal. Hmm. You know, it was like, you know, he said like they would, if they would show affection, but he would also, I think he would say like, yes sir. And um, he said one time in college it was, you know, there's senior week, so seniors go to a beach town, let's say, to, to celebrate essentially that they're going to graduate. He wanted to go as junior year and he said, I want to go to, I dunno, whatever beach it was, Wilmington beach to sell, you know, for senior week. And His dad said, I wish you wouldn't do that. And that was the end of the company.

Speaker 2:          00:26:12       Big Fight, Huh? Well, he said like argument. There was no such thing as being like, what the Fuck Dad? Of course it was just understood that that means no, no. That's how he just was like, okay, you respect your elders.

Speaker 2:          00:31:13       I don't know, but she's screaming really loud at the beginning. She's in a hospital again on a moped with, I don't know if that's a neck brace on or something.

Speaker 9:          00:31:27       Oh,

Speaker 10:         00:31:28       Groucho phase Facebook.

Speaker 10:         00:31:44       that Amy severe.

Speaker 9:          00:31:48       My Dad does.

Speaker 2:          00:32:04       She screams as she does. Not sound like Amy said. Doris does like a character she would do, right? Yeah. Yeah. That's amazing. The world is so fucked up, man.

Speaker 9:          00:32:13       No, I'm telling you,

Speaker 2:          00:32:18       and I know this because now that I go to the playground and I see other parents with their kids, then you go, oh, that's why you chase is everything. You guys are fucking idiots and you're raising idiots and there's more fucking idiots and everybody's all worried about, you know which kindergarten you send your kid to and which preschool to get a leg up. It doesn't matter because most of people are are retards. Yeah. Most of the world is full of idiots. There's a

Speaker 11:         00:32:40       lot of stuff gets out there. Yeah. Would, if you're a decent human, you're above. You don't need to send them to a fucking

Speaker 9:          00:32:45       Montessori school.

Speaker 11:         00:32:48       So do you find it funny when she's screaming like that or no, I'm more, it makes me sad for humanity. Like I don't, I don't, I get real bummed out when she's screaming like that. Yes. Why? Because she should know better. Like I get upset with humanity because you shouldn't have, she shouldn't be on her mo. Yeah. Clearly. Clearly

Speaker 9:          00:33:07       hospitals.

Speaker 11:         00:33:11       But I like her screen really. It was pretty fun. Yeah, it is pretty funny. Yeah. No, I like it. Yeah. Ah, yeah. That's great. I'm really got a bad dates.

Speaker 9:          00:33:23       Gotcha.

Speaker 11:         00:33:25       That's a good scream. We're damned. That's a good screen.

Speaker 9:          00:33:32       Okay.

Speaker 11:         00:33:34       And you know, she's just doing it for attention. You think so? Yeah. I mean, yeah. Um, here's the email we got. Can you spit on tp? Is it okay to, to spit on toilet paper then wipe your be whole? No, I am in the Denver airport bathroom waiting for your response. Are you, are you still there now wait, waiting. Uh, I'm 100% yes on that. I thousand percent. No, on, in a public setting. I mean, obviously not at home, but here's a simple workaround. I mean, it's just kind of grody to spit and then wipe your ass with your own spit. It's just, it's gross. But I'm saying it's a, if you're sitting in a public bathroom where you don't have a sink near you, you don't have a beverage with you. Oh, well here's what I'm telling you is that bring in you've, you've mentioned this, yeah.

Speaker 11:         00:34:23       Bring the water bottle in. Well, I'm, I'm saying, I'm saying you don't have it. Like you just didn't have it. Yeah. And you're feeling dirty. No. Yeah. You need something to clean up, man. I'm 100% fine. I would rather dry rub it a thousand times, then spit. It's just why I'm just opposed to spitting and toilet paper and rubbing it on my ass hole. I just, I would rather dry rub it and you know, I, I so gross. You can loosen some of that dry mess up man with the, with the spirit and on your own spit it. I just, I don't know. Sure if I've done it many times. I didn't, I didn't, you know, nasty. I started doing it a year or two ago because your dad taught you though. It was my, uh, uh, brother-in-law one of the mentioned that and I was like, oh, gross.

Speaker 11:         00:35:09       And then I was like, oh yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Started doing it. It's really so thankful for her husband fucking, Hey Hitler's, I just listened to four oh six decided to pull him high and tight and drop a note. I've been married to my first cousin for 23 years. We have three normal offspring with all the normal bits and pieces. I wouldn't date my mom, but I would marry my mom's sister's daughter. Just like the gays. Before breeding, we had all the testing done to make sure we weren't going to have any tards.

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       All the families supported us. I can't imagine sharing my trip with anybody else. Thanks for making an unbearable job. Slightly less unbearable. Mouth kisses all around. Jason, I told you cousin fucking is. It's genetically. No, it's no. That is incorrect.

Speaker 2:          00:35:54       Does that sound correct? You got to move it to the, can I move it? It's going on. It's just not working. Maybe it's a moving because look, I'm out of frame again. Isn't that weird? Oh my. Oh Em gee, let's hop on lane. Not the, Oh, it's trying to focus or it's, it's, oh, oh my gosh. No, I zoomed out right. I think when we play clips, it's trying to focus on this or something. It's just not as, oh my gosh. Oh mg.

Speaker 3:          00:36:34       Sorry about that. Back to cousin. Fucking completely wrong. When you say it's okay. He's telling me he has children that are genetically fine. You've got all the testing done because like most people don't have to have all the testing when before they decided to start breeding. Sure. So he's at a much higher risk for having those genetic abnormalities and I would say this guy is in the smallest percentage of people who go, we should do that before we reproduce when they are first cousins. Okay. It definitely causes abnormalities.

Speaker 2:          00:37:08       Oh yeah. I mean I don't know. I don't know. I heard somewhere, especially in relation to royal marriages that they are married cousins frequently in royal families, like way back in the days they do. What I'm saying is that, but they don't have a lot of tardies in in a the royal fam.

Speaker 3:          00:37:24       They have more genetic issues, health problems than those who do not reproduce within the same genetic family. But it's not, it's not a for sure tar towel. It's not for sure toward town, but it's also not, it's your higher probability for having some type of health problems like dog breeding. Of course. You want to vary the genetic

Speaker 2:          00:37:45       pull. I, I clearly I understand that, but I'm saying it's not necessarily a tar town sentence. You're not necessarily

Speaker 3:          00:37:52       insulatard town. And, and what this guy had mentioned that they had testing done beforehand I think is probably really smart.

Speaker 2:          00:37:59       Yeah. It is smart, quick deal, cousins look, call me, whatever. I don't think marrying your cousins that big of a deal. I don't think it's that. I don't think it's that sacrilege. The cousin, I didn't, I don't have you think, I mean, I wouldn't fuck my female cousins,

Speaker 3:          00:38:16       so I'm opposed to marrying and having sex with any of my first cousins. Um, like that one was hot. Yeah. It doesn't, it doesn't register on the thing to me at all as a possibility, but I know that it's also a very, very common in a lot of cultures. So yes. I'm just saying that I think, I think more people should be doing what he's doing and get, I'm getting more tests again to make sure it's our town isn't inevitable. Yeah. Um, kick twins. Oh, sorry. I don't know if you wanted to see this one. Okay. Yeah, I was listening to latest podcast with

Speaker 2:          00:38:55       no, she didn't say what that Burp was so feeble. It was like, why do it into the mic if you're not even going to follow up?

Speaker 3:          00:39:01       It was week. I'll give you the, oh, why would you do that? I want to send some says a light on this topic of identical twins having identical penises. I am a twin. I can tell you that my brother and I do in fact have different size penis on vacation and my brother had too much to drink and passed out on the couch in his underwear. My ex girlfriend who was on vacation with us went into the living room and was straight glass and at his apple bag later on when I discussed it with her, she described my brother's situation as a large head shorter shaft hanging above two coconuts. However, my setup is a normal head average shaft and two regular size balls. I hope this information helps you with your debate next time and you're in, you're in New York. Come by for some moose soup. Sincerely, Mike, Tom, and is the personality champs. Sorry.

Speaker 12:         00:39:56       No, it's fine. Oh, it's already

Speaker 2:          00:40:09       happening. I don't know. It's the camera or just wants to get close to me. I'm so beautiful today, but this is crazy, right? Yeah. We're not that blue band. Fix it. Fucking hey man, wait. So these twins are identical, correct? Not, oh my OMG not fraternal. Right. So they're dicks. Now here's my, my question with this Dick Detection.

Speaker 3:          00:40:31       Dibs. Go ahead.

Speaker 2:          00:40:34       Is, uh, he's talking about a flacid drunk penis versus an erect, you know, and I understand the, the head of the penis, that's a big, that is a difference and aesthetic thing, you know? Yeah. But I wonder if the size one when erect.

Speaker 3:          00:40:49       Well, this guy, um, we did, he didn't, he said they don't have, you know, when the question being at the twins have identical penises, he didn't say whether they were fraternal or identical twins.

Speaker 2:          00:40:59       See, that's what I need. I need identical twins. And I'm, I'm looking at, cause I asked, I asked fraternal twin Ryan sickler different penises. Okay. He's a twin. [inaudible] different, but we haven't asked identical twins yet. I really love the scientific leanings. Our show is taken lately. I know it's pretty crazy, right? How to blind people. Why

Speaker 3:          00:41:23       it's really, we're really doing a lot of great work, man. I don't know a lot of great work. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:41:29       wait, can I share with you my thought? Of course. So I, I, uh, I found Chaz Bono on Twitter the other day and I was looking at his whatever feed and I noticed that like, he's fully transitioned now. I think he has a penis. Like he's fully, fully, he's on board and he's on the team. Yeah. I gotta tell Ya. And I mean this, I'm not being a shithead. Yeah. I think he's fucking hot, really. I, you know what I mean? Where did you see this image? Just Google, Google image. Chaz Bono 2017. Okay. Wait, is it cha cha's that's his name now. And I gotta tell you that, uh, you know me, I like bears are like, um, I like to big guys stocky and he looks, I think he's hot. I think he did a great job. Whoever did whatever work, he looks great. Him. Yeah, he looks great. I know. I like, no, that's too, I like him with facial hair. Yeah. See there. He's cute. Yeah. Well he's got a good face. Looks good man. And a lot of times when women see this, like he's cute. When women transition, they don't always look masculine enough. Yeah. But he's lucky. I think the weight actually makes him look more. Oh, I like that picture. That was cute. Yeah. See he's cute. Yeah. It looks like a regular dude. Yeah, it looks really good. It's just face is really good for a man.

Speaker 3:          00:42:52       This transition is like quite impressive action. Oh my gosh. I mean, you know, they're always like, you're always, or at least, you know, generally speaking, um, it's usually about women. They're like, that looks like, oh my God, she can fool you, right? Yeah. Yeah. You don't really see that as much with the other way. Like when a woman training,

Speaker 2:          00:43:11       that's what I'm saying. It's so hard for us to get bulkier to get to look masculine, but his features are really, really,

Speaker 3:          00:43:21       yeah. There's no way if you ran into this dude, you'd be like, Hey, were you a woman before? You would never think.

Speaker 2:          00:43:28       And the weight helps, I think. Yeah. Fela Mau and, oh see there's a picture of him with his shirt off, like sitting in shorts and stuff. Yeah. It looks great. Or that you would never know that that was a woman dude. He looks fantastic than it used to be. A woman. Sorry. Yes. Yeah. That's what that he was a woman before. I mean, yeah, it looks great. It's true. True. So anyway, I just had already changed. I don't understand what's going on. Know what's happened.

Speaker 3:          00:43:51       Okay. Um, I gotta tell you this because normally we don't do this. Okay. Normally when, when we have, um, like a sh a shirt launch, uh, we've had a few in recent weeks, completely normal came back to Netflix. So we did, we re leased a new version of sub cane as like a celebration where I partnered with dos Brac, I think, I don't know how to say his name right on, um, on, on Instagram. He's a great artist. And then I, we did Moose suit cause it was so timely, but then we got this unbelievable submission for a shirt design. And I have to uh, make sure I, I say correctly the credit for it. So this shirt design was so funny that I was like, yeah, we, we absolutely have to, to do that. And the guy's name, here we go is a Mark Glass. So He's, he's totally glass and mark last, um, he has, let's see, designed by humans.com he did rob, rob, rob, the rub, rub, rub shirt. I've seen, I laughed so hard at this design that I was like, we were just going to put it up. So it's up there. If you go to merchant method.com

Speaker 2:          00:45:22       are you serious? We made this shirt. Yeah. Immediately. Oh my God. Yeah. And how would you describe it? I'd prefer not to come on. No, you go ahead. Well, it says, it says, of course, the great

Speaker 3:          00:45:36       phrase. I'm rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, rob, rob, and then as my face and it looks like my eyes are struggling to stay open because I'm in ecstasy. And, uh, it looks like something is dripping off of, of the face there. Yeah, that's good.

Speaker 2:          00:46:04       Hey, it's your call. I mean if you want the shirt around, of course I wandered around. Come dripping from your beard. Be My guess babe. That's what it is. More appreciative. I am. I think it's really neat.

Speaker 13:         00:51:10       Sanjay and I don't see nasty bitch ass. I forgot her name. You ever heard of it anyway, but I still can't find you. I'm way know everybody that was talking shit to comment. The black bitches, white bitches. Niggas don't know them. I'm still waiting.

Speaker 11:         00:51:29       No. Where do you think, uh, what do you think she's from? South Atlanta. Yeah, it's the south, but now is Atlanta, not the deep south. We're talking like Atlanta south. What'd he call? Okay. What I'm saying? Cause like when you're Alabama's different accent than like Atlanta. That's what I'm saying. Are you thinking from Bama or something negative? I'm saying she's from Atlanta. Oh, see I think she's from a smaller populated area. Oh. My guess would be that she's maybe, maybe she's in the outskirts of like Norfolk or something. Yeah. Okay. Oh Hey, that's another one. Yeah. Yeah, because Virginia is super weird. Yeah. That's a real weird next. Yeah. Yeah. But like she doesn't live in Norfolk like she lives trysting theory 30 minutes from it and yeah. You know, there's some country has shit going on where she lives for sure. Now she's responding to the haters in her comment feed. Is that, I think she must have like posted something. I mean, I'm sure there's a more, this girl was upset on Facebook. She's not afraid to use big words and all we got on it, but interesting. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         00:52:38       I don't care what race you are, Babe. I'm not racist. Bitch got me fucked up. But it's just the back bitches that's out. So that's why I said black bitches.

Speaker 11:         00:52:48       Is She driving? Yeah. I always wonder how people do that. Yeah. Cause I think to get out that much anger while you're driving is not even, it's not good for your driving. I wish you would pull over.

Speaker 13:         00:53:02       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         00:53:13       I think it's weird. Maybe it's different to brag about how good you are at writing Dick. Well, you know, as Margaret Thatcher said, if you have to tell people you're a lady, right. It's the talkers that Eh, it's always the quiet ones that are doing shit. You got to top dog face while I'm thinking about how, I bet she's just really aggressive. Like I could, I could see her busting like breaking. You're Dong Open. Yeah. I think she probably miss mistakes and through Z. Asm for good. For good. Yeah. There's a lot of enthusiasm there. A lot of anger, energy, you know, it's not the same negative. It's not the same as as doing good. You guys are doing good. Yeah. It's different in iron. Okay,

Speaker 13:         00:54:02       motherfucker ain't got no career then now I'm taking care of Yaki. Well we should put the phone down. Nigga would say Nigga too.

Speaker 11:         00:54:22       I Dunno. I think there's some people, you know what I'm curious of. Go ahead. Um, how many, uh, black people would prefer somebody to be this open with their big words? Right. You know what I mean? Like I remember one time, um, it was a Clayton Peter's Russell Peters brother told me when he had a corporate job, he worked with a guy that he knew was racist, but the guy, he goes, he was open about it and that's what I respected about him, that he liked ladies. I do think she's probably right and that she's probably not racist. I definitely don't think she actually, I think she's somebody who thinks that she has a hall pass. She thinks she has a hall pass because she's got black inner meaning it black by injection. So she's thinking like, well do to have sex with a black guy.

Speaker 11:         00:55:08       Like I clearly am down. Most of her friends are probably below culturally, you know, she does obviously spend time in that community. There's a certain level of comfortability with that. I wonder if like if most people are cool, I think she's cool or, or if people are like, no, I don't prefer that you do this. I don't know. I can only speculate, but I, I can't imagine that anybody would be like, that's okay. You can say that. I think some people would. Yeah, it wouldn't be a boy. I know. That's what I'm talking about. It's not a blanket vote. I think it wouldn't be 100% I just wonder if it's 90% or whether it's more 50 50 that's what you're taking. Unofficial poll. Yeah, sure. I would love to take on official bowl. If you're black and you're listening to this and post on the Facebook page or send an email to your mom's podcast@gmail.com it's not your mom's house podcast.

Speaker 11:         00:56:04       It's your mom's podcast and let us know if you go, actually, I don't mind. The thing is, this is fine. As long as you're hanging out with a lot of black people having sex with him, I guess it's okay. Well she, I mean, I'm sure the guys that have sexual her all the time, we're probably like, this is fine. That's me. That's point of view. All right. Anybody that would willing to, like if you were like, I'm going to call you names or whatever, I'd be like, okay, well here's the, here's a story. So you know, I talk about this in my, my hour that's going to come out soon as having an Indian stuff family. I had an Indian Stepdad and three Indian step sisters. We were very politically incorrect round the house. Oh. It was a joke. Like we'd call him, my mother would call him a towel head and why don't you, why don't you put fucking laundry on your head?

Speaker 11:         00:56:49       And then he would call her Goulash tits or whatever lake and there's, it was just silliness. But see, like that's, you know, that's still different from this though, because that to me is affection. Like all my friends that are of any marginalized group or ethnic group that aren't white. I, if I really care for it, if I really liked him, I would tease them. I have my whole life. Yeah. About whatever it is. Right? Yeah. But that to me is like you're showing that's like a way, a sign of affection for gun. Well, it's also an old school way of showing affection. Like this is different. Like was so, so loaded. It's such a, it's such a harsh, I mean like to, I have black friends that I say, um, you know, inappropriate things too, but I don't drop and bombs on them. Um, I have a, I mean, you know, like Ari, I, I would buy would feel weird not saying something to you about his Jewish.

Speaker 11:         00:57:53       Yeah. But that's like, because I like if I didn't like him, I would never say, okay, so let's, well, let's do this conversation because I did have an word in my act, uh, prior, not that I'm saying it, I say as Dick Clark, assuming that he was a racist piece of shit. So now I did that. I've done that bit in front of Black Comedians for a while now and I've gotten an, you know, and people that were pretty close with and I've never gotten anything negative feedback and they'll fucking tell you. I feel like I'm close enough to people that they'll be like, that's really fucked up. Anyway, I guess it's context, dude contract. It's an interesting, it's an interesting cultural debates is more like the Rachel Dole is all thing. She's where she's like, I can say whatever I want. Not that that's wrong because that lady didn't say that. That I'm, what I'm saying is that, that that lady was like, I'm black. She's clearly a white lady. She's like, yeah, but I identify as black, which is crazy. But I think that this, this person right now basically thinks, I mean without saying it, I think she thinks that she's in the club. It's called cultural appropriation happening a lot here. Yeah, of course. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         00:59:05       No, no bitch. Bitch thinks she can beat my ass. I will wait on it cause I would stay if they Nigga to anybody. That's up to me. Whether you white, black, Mexican, he don't care. I don't care. Black, white, Chinese or candy.

Speaker 2:          00:59:21       Stripe. I don't give a fuck. Yeah. I don't know man. She has that thing where she goes, I don't care.

Speaker 13:         00:59:30       Rick Ross, my mom and Laura, my sister, my sister does. Sweet southern. Yeah. She's Super Sad. Yeah, it does get spoke. Her name. Monica hot. You want to look up? Yeah, it sounds good. I know bitch trying to play me. I don't care. What color do we use?

Speaker 2:          00:59:50       Yeah. Yeah. Different strokes. Same, same strokes for everybody. Yeah,

Speaker 13:         00:59:54       that's fine. Cause I white bitch spoke up to Galle is cheese. Yeah. I never had a child but that's why boot you found the right one.

Speaker 2:          01:00:05       She's really, I mean if she's auditioning and she's got the part, yeah, I'd be like, yeah, your dad, you did it right. Did that. He definitely got it. Well she feels, I mean that's the question too with Rachel Doughlas all in with this kind of, with this girl. It's like what does it mean? Like, if you feel a certain culture, you know, you feel like that's your culture and you're raised in that environment. Like who's to say, you know, I don't fucking know. I don't know. I don't know. I feel like she's bought a lot of guys sneakers at the mall for them before, but I dunno. Is that all it takes to win a man's heart? I mean, so snakes, I think she's, she knows exactly. He's like everyone's one 13. Yeah, I got you. I got you. Okay. I got you. I think I do blue, blue. Wow. Yeah, she's um, she's something I'm trying to think of. Well, yeah, I dunno dude, whatever.

Check out that

Speaker 3:          01:03:34       Bro. And that's it man. Thanks Ross. Dude, this is blood Danza

Speaker 2:          01:03:45       last week I talk about Bukowski's. Don't try, if you ever heard of that on his tombstone is written. Don't try to talk about that quote, man. Isn't that the funniest thing ever? I really, it's very meaningful. So I get deep on that. That's great. I really liked that. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Oh, okay.

Speaker 6:          01:04:06       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:04:08       Fucking

Speaker 2:          01:04:12       she gas it. Fucking sheep. He's fired up though. Ah, speaking of UK. So last week we were talking about why on earth, why on earth would a man choose to be a gynecologist and how it was interesting fucking weird. That is. And you've clearly got to be a pervert of some sort and women, uh, Dick Doctors. Yeah. Well I can't, we can't speak on that, but, so this gent gentlemen in from the UK and um, okay, so he says he works with a number of male consultant gynecologist. They vastly outweigh the women, which is definitely an unusual seeing as medical school is roughly 60, 40 women to men. So anyways, he thinks the big attraction, why men choose gynecology. Uh, he writes, you're able to separate yourself from what you see. So although the issue around sex is definitely there, that is a relatively small price to pay to know that nothing you see can happen to you.

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       And also not having a frame of reference on how it would actually feel, which is good. So meaning if it's a total train wreck down there, you can look at it impartially as an outsider and go, well I guess I'd better stitch this back on and get on with it instead of like, if you're looking at a dick, it's like cut. You're, you're too empathetic almost. Yeah. Interesting. So it's actually, if you're full of empathy, it's great to remove yourself from your sec. Totally. And that makes sense. Like you don't want, you want a divorce completely. I never thought of that either. And secondly, he says that the, um, it's a real macho field, gynecology and doing gynecological procedures and surgeries and it's very macho and Hari is also much easier to track than that. I don't remember. I don't know. I can't think it was in the email that it's easier to get into gynecology. Yeah, I dunno then then if you were to be like a fucking heart surgeon. Oh, right. But the, but the glamor is high. So meaning like there's, uh, it's, it's just more prestigious to do, I guess, you know, women's stuff really. It's difficult. Yeah. Yeah. He says it's very macho cause you're, you're really, you're playing God, you know, with women's innards and big fibroids and shit like that. Like his wife comes out. Yeah. So it's a high reward and guessing. Anyways, I thought that was fascinating. That is, that's interesting. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:06:39       Oh yeah. Still yelling at a sheep. Fucking hell. Mine fucking move. Yeah. Five days.

Speaker 2:          01:06:53       So mad at an innocent cheap. Can you do his accent? A fucking movie. That's pretty good. You're fucking shit. You're fucked. And it's Scotland Scottish. He's, he calls him a fat Dick. Fat Dick. Yeah, that's what he said there

Speaker 6:          01:07:12       all your content. Fucking hell. Mine Cuna El Mundo can move. Yeah, no, it sounds like

Speaker 2:          01:07:24       all right. Francis Begbie train spot. I watched the second one you did on the flight. Did you love it? That was great, dude. I fucking love that movie. I mean, it can't live up to par. It's like when it, I think when the movie really moves into the, whatever, the third act, I was not as invested in it. It's kind of like, Oh, this is movie making. This is, uh, making this story come together. But it's fun to see the characters again. Yes. That's the part. I enjoy it, Sandra. Then. Yeah, seeing them back and getting in trouble was cool. Yeah, it was fun. It's cool. It's, it's a fucking great movie. Trainspotting dude. Fuck deck. Yeah. If Fat Dick, that

Speaker 6:          01:08:05       cupid cut. Fuck Shit. Fucking hell fucking hey, fuck off.

Speaker 11:         01:08:18       I'm just glad I didn't hurt the sheep. I was scared when I first saw he doesn't, I mean, he just drives away, but he's just angry as shit that he can't drive down the street. I kind of don't like when they spray paint sheep. I feel like it's really silly. Don't spray paint. Nice wool. Yeah. He's, he's very, this guy's real aggro. Yep. Yeah. I enjoyed him though. I fucking code. Yeah, he's a lot. He's got a lot of things. That's what oil middle road. Oh my God. So of course there's no such thing. Nothing can compare to the, the greatest dad Boehner of all time.

Speaker 6:          01:09:02       Oh yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:09:03       We know who that is. Canada highway. It's the Canadian Dad boner for the Canadian. He, he definitely wears the crown.

Speaker 6:          01:09:15       Oh, the story that this road towels. Nobody. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. See now, and I'm listening to him. Does he, is he joking?

Speaker 11:         01:09:34       He just loves highways. So we've had different ones. We've had, you know, dad boners that love whatever it is. Solar eclipse, the trains, right train boners are pretty big. This is our first plane boner. This guy parks in a fast food parking lot and watch his planes on their approach at an airport and I'm willing and gets really fucking excited about it. I mean, it's, he, he's in the running. I mean, he can't eclipse Canadian Dad, but this is pretty excitable for fucking commercial airlines. Oh, it's not like special, no planes landing. It's like Sesnas and shit. No. Hmm. Oh yeah. That's an Airbus three one nine

Speaker 10:         01:10:23       there's one, three, three, yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:10:28       Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:10:30       Oh, Boeing seven 37

Speaker 11:         01:10:34       it's like a southwest plane, Bro. Relax this guy. Is this excited for this? Oh, my word. Oh my word. Oh my word. I'm 37 so you notice that also, by the way, that these guys are all these dad boners are real clean. Like they don't curse. Yeah, that's it. Oh my word. Oh my God. Heavens and stars. Yeah. Cheese and rice. They don't go fucking Bowleys shit. Yeah, yeah. That's true. Train guy too. He was like, Oh, this is, oh no. I think it's because you're sublimating everything else in your life for that. Like you're repressing something else somewhere else maturing. You're not allowing your brain to mature. You're not using your Dick. You're not. You're not having come gazumped. What if the guy took you on a day and he goes, we're going to park at this white castle. Oh, watch planes, land and feeling.

Speaker 11:         01:11:22       Are we five? Ours are a little toddler likes playing. He loves a point up with them by, by the waves. The waves. Bye Bye to them. Are you one and a half? Yeah. That's kind of what this guy should be doing. Yeah. His, his development is stunted somewhere. Right? It's not normal. These are not commercial. Okay. These are planes there. Thousands of them land every day. Every year. If you've ever flown, yeah. You're like, okay, that's sucked. Unless he's putting it on like putting us all on, you know, these are just giant fart bubbles in the sky. It's like they're so gross thing. Exciting about this.

Speaker 10:         01:11:55       No, I can't believe it. A Boeing seven 37 come from Los Angeles.

Speaker 11:         01:12:05       Maybe he's touched. Yeah, he might be special. He could be very special. Wait, we haven't even thought of that. What if he's just tarted? He's not retarded. I you sure he parked? No, no. Someone drove him there. No, I don't think. I don't think so. I think he's retarded. I don't think he's retarded that. I think that he's just really, it's just misguided energy. You know? It's like you shouldn't be like this. No, you should have orgasms. It's done. Yeah. You should feel like just for like tits. Right? Right. What if, but what if they are on the spectrum of some kind of behavioral? I guess so. I guess that's possible. It's do. It's weird though, for sure. Super. We're saying we could see there now. It could be that this guy's doing a bit. No, no, no. The genuine. Yeah. That's real. Enthusiasm is too real. Coming from Los Angeles. That's like, he's so stoked. That's how little kids are. How did you know that was from la? See it? What about the following? The flight patterns? I mean there's like apps, like flight deck. You can see what time?

Speaker 10:         01:13:20       Yeah. Oh yeah. Come on.

Speaker 11:         01:13:33       It's a fun character to play it. Yeah. Oh, Boeing seven three seven Oh my word so far. And to deferred. Did it pick it up? Maybe subtly. Yes. So exciting. It's not exciting to me. Now I remember why it's not. Oh, it doesn't smell very good. Oh God. Yeah. I'm still in it. It's my own hello. Help mommies. In the last few years I've killed a relationship with my own mom. She wasn't in my life for years because of addiction and other factors. As we have hung out more often, things are back to normal and we part ways. She tries to plan a smooch right on my mouth. Personally, I wouldn't marry my mom and try to turn a cheek before it lands. What's the best way to duck out of these mouth kisses with my mom without being a, how you say asshole Tim. Oh wait, okay, so you're a dude and she's your mom.

Speaker 11:         01:14:26       Yeah. And they put, they had, you know, many years apart. Things are better now, but she tries to do mouth kisses. Cause I tell you, there's somebody in my life who con and for years it goes to say goodbye to me and mount and tries to mouth kiss. What you do is go for the cheek. You just bypass the mouth and go cheek and the act like that's that. That's what you was just establish. You just establish that. I think you could start, you could start leading kisses. That's maybe the way, in other words, when you say hello, give her a hug and like, just go right. Go right for that cheek. You know? So it's, it's not really, you're not responding. You're not playing defense. You're being playing offense. That's what I do with this. That's a good way to do it. Yeah. Who does that?

Speaker 11:         01:15:13       I'll tell you off Mike. All right. It's a friend that I've had for, you know, 17 years. Oh really? God, it's weird. I know how blind people know when they're done wiping mommy's. I can't believe no one has written the real answer. People, black people full the teepee when they think they are done. If the, this is a fucking goof, I don't know. This is nothing. Sorry guys. Um, how many head scratches equal one Bj? Boy, my boyfriend and I had been listening to the podcast since we started dating four years ago. We recently bet on John Jones versus Daniel Cormier fight number two. If Jon Jones wins, I get five head scratches. If DC wins, my boyfriend gets one. Bj, we were wondering if this is the proper exchange rate for head scratch. BJ's. Well, first of all, Justine, thanks Hitler's. She writes. Justine, first of all, congratulations on your head.

Speaker 11:         01:16:13       Scratchies because Jon Jones did indeed win this past weekend. Five head scratchers for one. Bj. Yeah. Now that sounds about right. That sounds right to you. Well, it depends because I would say you owe me dozens of Bj's at this point, I think. But here's the thing, the head scratches for me has to be, I go to sleep with them. So you need to do the scratchies until I'm asleep more than you think. That's five that I give you five. Well, how many is that? You probably get 40 to 60 oh no, no, she's saying five. I'm sorry, I understood this to mean five, five sessions of Scott show. I think you need to be clear about that and a lot of people are like, you know, one, two, three, four, five scratches. That's bullshit. That's not even a head scratch. You're saying do five hedge scratchy sessions equal a Bj?

Speaker 11:         01:17:04       I think that's about right. If it's a session five sessions full, which means we're laying in bed, I'm ready to go to sleep and then I go give me scratchies and then I get the scratches until I fall asleep. Yeah. I've been trying to ask for the Bj in return for those scratches, but we're just marking up your debt by the way. You totally just blew off your helicopter Bj's. Those are supposed to be an agreed upon. We've gotten distracted. Life took over. We didn't get back to the discussion. If you don't want to see me in a by by pretty soon, but by better start I've had my eye on so how much dog food will I need to eat for that man? No, I'm serious. I want a new updated wedding ring because ours was so, I can't wear it. I'm allergic. But how many cans of dog food will I have to eat for a new wedding band?

Speaker 11:         01:17:53       We can we switch it up? Why don't we switch it up to Bj's and dog food or just don't have any more dog food. Okay. Yeah. I felt bad when you ate that last time. It was worth it though. This rings are all nice. It's a nice ring to waste. The other one now it's this one. Oh yeah, that's right. That's the food ring. This you gave me for my special, which is very sweet of you. Yeah, I do need a proper wedding band cause the other one I can't wear skin breaks out. We've talked about this. You're supposed to give me some things to take in and I got this. These balls are all full. I need those kind of just got home last night. You came home all tired and you took shifts. Remember last night we were going to sleep and you're like, I'll go to shit.

Speaker 11:         01:18:37       And I'm like, thanks. You've been shitting since you got home. We haven't had a chance to get in there. Hey Mommy, I'm an AIDS. Lana Mommy right into needs. Lana about people facetiming. Ah, I'm currently getting my car worked on. I'm in the lobby and these low end loose assholes or facetiming with someone singing happy birthday twice. Stop once in Spanish. Once an English, Jesus Christ Christo. After they finished singing, they continue to have their conversation with the person with the vault all the way up to over 15 minutes. I go outside, but it's nine degrees and humid. This is a low and loose situation. Stay high and tight. Caesar or [inaudible]. I don't know how you say it, but that is some fucking bullshit. I really feel like we, you know, it's time to start telling people, hey, are you fucking out of your mind right now?

Speaker 11:         01:19:29       Where were we when that old guy's phone went off? And I was like, did I say something to him? I was like, oh, no, no, no. Hell No. Hell No. I didn't. I say that to him. I don't remember. I remember that I, dude, I bet it was just ringing and ringing and ringing. Then that's the worst one. All people swarming, and I don't even fucking pick it up. I was in a doctor's office where a patient had words with another patient, which doctor Dix off. No, no, no different doctor. The witch doctory just don't worry about it. I'm just kidding. So the person, the person was the phone and it says there's a big sign there, no cell phones allowed. And so another patient in the doctor's office goes, excuse me, good. And that person on the phone was like, like, what? She's like, you're not supposed to be on your phone in here.

Speaker 11:         01:20:23       And she was like, oh. She's like, um, I, and she was like, I got to go. Someone's saying, and it's like, well, yeah, but there's a huge sign that says it. No one wants to hear your fucking conversation. That's the worst part about this is that it's really an intrusion on other people's audit. That's the whole issue. Yeah. And you don't even, you don't even fucking think about it. Like that's the thing. There's people who just don't, they don't think about it. That to me, an auditory assault me, it makes me, I hate Whistler's. I had people that talk on their fucking speaker phone or watch a movie full volume, why we're married. These are like, these are actually, these are core values or core values. The tenants of our marriage or really that were like, don't abuse my ears in public. Well, you and I are not yellers and we never yell across the house.

Speaker 11:         01:21:11       That's fucking not happening. No. Yeah. And we don't like loud sounds or public. Yeah. Stop being so fucking loud, man. Yeah. Why are you so fucking loud? Yeah. Very rude. It's super rude. It's just obliviousness, you know. Hey Jane. Hi Jeans with G. N. E. S. It's a new one. Yeah. You've talked about workers coming over and taking a shit in your house. Yup. Yup, Yup. My mom has people working on her roof who came over and immediately dropped hot sevens in her bathroom. She called me at the end of the day. I say, told me that not only was there a worker brown sprayed all over the toe, but that her dog went in the trash and shredded toilet paper all over the house. She cleaned it up. She realized there was Brown on the paper. These workers shit in her house and through the poo paper in the trashcan. Oh dear.

Speaker 11:         01:21:58       What the fuck? I guess it's just like the gays. I know a few people that aren't going to be invited over for moose soup. No questions here. Just sharing. One of the worst things I've ever heard of happening. Well, there's a good chance that those are from Latin America. Those guys, you know, so they are used to throw in their poop paper in the, in the trash because of the plumbing down there or it could be they're working on the plumbing. Maybe she didn't say what type of workers they are and maybe the plumbing roof. She said, no, I bet it's that. Because my, one of my buddies who's married to a Mexican woman said that, you know, when the family visited, he was like, I had to keep, I'm like, do not put your shit paper in the toilet. And they, and they don't put it in the trash. Yeah. To a habit. So he puts signs in the bathroom. Good. Yeah. Flesh side. We flush it down, dude. If it's brown, it goes down. All of it. All of it. Anything Brown. Even if you have a brown shirt on, he put it in the toilet. You flush it away. Americans do not. We don't want to see it. Smell it. Just go away. Yeah. It goes go August. Horrifying to a god that Nancy,

Speaker 11:         01:23:09       it's such a weird, oh, she's so weird about it. I would've crashed my car if I was at that red light and that lady on a moped was like, I gotta go, Ah, ah. I like that. She drives away like this. You need to go back.

It's in my mind those ladies are so nice to her though. The ladies and the other car, I think that they were enjoying it and using the cover of being nice, which is a good way you need to go to the hospital because if I were laughing I would be like, y'all write too, but then just keep laughing. Yeah. That's fucking funny. Funny. But a psycho. I know. God, the world is so messed up. Um, what else? I'm supposed to be on Conan next week. Oh, okay. Always.
