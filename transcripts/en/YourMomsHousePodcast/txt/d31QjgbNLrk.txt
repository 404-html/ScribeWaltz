This was sent to me and uh, Tom and I this morning, I forgot, I'm sorry. I forgive. I forgive me for the person who sent it. I didn't put it them on Twitter. We'll figure it out. It's a clip from cameo. It's cameo where you get celebrities to make videos that you pay them a certain amount of money. And this video came in. This is Beverley Mitchell. Remember that show? Seventh Heaven. Yeah, this is, I'm a potter. Used to have a crush on her. Is that right? Yeah. And I know that, uh, anyways, she looks the same. She looks great. She plays like one of the younger kids and something that he obviously got her. Oh. At Mr Dennison d Mr Underscore d. E N. N. Y. S. O. N sent it. Give him some love, uh, for that one. That was crazy. That was the best thing ever. She looks great. She's still, she still looks nice. Never that fucking show. Seventh Heaven. It was like a weird Christian and yeah. I never watched it. Neither is lame. Yeah. I remember that

Speaker 1:          00:09:52       Jessica Biel was on it. Oh, Diaz is calling. I should probably answer right? Yeah, go for it. Just in case. No one dog. Hello? Yeah, he was like, so Joey Diaz is coming over for people listening to do the podcast and then that, that'll be in a couple of weeks from now. Yeah, I'd be in a couple of weeks, but he's, he calls me, I sent him directions with a map on it, like the PDF, which shows like here's where you turn it. It's really like explicit. It's to give anybody who's trying to find the place clear direction. And he's like, so when I get off the highway, oh, I go right. And I go, yeah, like right. Like, so you're going north away from the cities, like don't start with the fucking north and south. All right. He goes, I'm not a fuck a boy scout. All right man. I go, what?

Speaker 1:          00:10:45       I don't know what to tell you. He's like, do I go right? I go, yeah. And he's like, and then at the other street, another right. And I go, yeah, I have no idea. I'm just like, yeah. And he's like, and then what? Then left at the other thing and I go, I'll just be out in the street. Does have a gps. Come on, who are you talking now? He won't even accept text message. He's like, tell you why. If I've been drinking the shit, my ass was going to be on file. I can't wait. Yeah. Oh good. We got them Fart Mc for, I don't know if you want to give that to him. I don't know if you want to start that. I do. I actually, you know what we haven't had against, yeah, you're setting, you're sitting pretty close. Just a reminder. I'm used to Joey's farts and he's like my kid at this holy shit.

Speaker 1:          00:11:24       Anyways, uh, we, we lost track here. So this is Beverley Mitchell. Um, I was saying, I remember Jessica Biel, she cause that's what she got famous on and everybody was enamored with Jessica w worse. So, um, but then this cameo things kind of, it's, it's an APP. If you guys don't know it's an APP, right. And all kinds of people have signed like are doing it where you, you can pay them to send a measures and they have different tiers. So like there's Instagram people and then there's TV and then like Farve, you know, Hall of fame. Superbowl winning quarterback is uncanny and I think you have to pay him 500 bucks just to be like happy birthday. Yeah, exactly. There. Jim, your friend Bob, he lucky you love, he said her tail bone ready. Uh, wranglers are good pants. There's another thing. Don't forget about that.

Speaker 1:          00:12:14       Go go packers. I just, I don't know. I feel like if I was going to start making, I just do it for free for fans. You know what I mean? Well, I mean, you know, I'm not, I'm not hating on the whatever. Yeah. I don't want to do it, but I think it's fine that people do it, but I really liked the people are hitting up people and having them do your mom's house stuff. That's hilarious. That's a good investment. You know what's so funny is seventh heaven. That was like a blatantly Christian value show. It was. Yeah. I think the far right, the father was like a priest on the show. It was like a minister and I think they're like, oh, you used to watch the show. Really? Wow. Scandalous happen on bill's. Really the only thing I remember, I mean, is that why you watched?

Speaker 1:          00:13:00       Yeah. And you're like, God, let me marry you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And like she, you know, she seemed cutting young on that show. It was like, oh, that's kind of I work. Do you remember when I worked as a site rep? We were married, so it was, it was less than 10 years ago. I worked as an adult man, I don't know if I ever told you, but there was a guy, so as a site rep, you would go to a building that they're shooting a movie or production in and you just represent basically the building so that the production doesn't just destroy it because they will don't give a fuck. And you'd be like, Hey, this is a Christina's house. I'm just here to make sure. And then they'll start like nail and shit. So you had to kind of protect it. And one of the other site reps, it's guy was like 26 27 was legit obsessed.

Speaker 1:          00:13:48       Obsessed with Jessica Biel boy. And he was like, yeah, my, I have pictures of her all over my room and oh boy. He's like, I know I'm going to marry her one day. And at first, like if someone said, you're like, ha ha, yeah. And then he was like, no, for real. When I was like, you're gonna Marry Jessica Biel? And he's like, yeah. He's like, well, he's like, we're meant to be together. And I was like, fuck, this dude is seriously delusional. And I would bring it up like I wouldn't see him for a week. I'd see him at the office. I was like, Hey Jessica, plans coming up. And he would be like, oh no, I know you make fun of me for that. But was he a gang banger to know? He was kind of about though. He had like someone bought the blood, he was, he was from Ventura and he likes to serve. He was like, where it's like we're like a perfect match, you know, like it's a delusion. Get the level of delusion that it wasn't like, it's one thing if you see like a teenager like that stu was a grown man. I used to think that Ricky Schroeder and I would fall in love and get married to, what were you like 31 silver spoon? He was my first love.

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       My first crush was Ricky Schroder. Yeah, I mean he was well off. Good looking. Yeah. I mean I hadn't, I had that crush on Alyssa Milano course. And then what was the blonde, the beautiful blonde on the other, the one that Scott Bayeux finger. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Her Nicole, Nicole Agricor. Oh, call Acre. Used to, I used to think if you learn their names, there was a good chance you didn't have together. Right. Cause I was an advanced level for a kid, for a kid. And you're like, oh, I read the credits and I know this person's name calls with me. And I used to, I used to buy like those big bopper magazines, remember those stupid magazines for like teen girls. And then Ricky Schroder would be all over it. And I have like the poster on my wall. It's just loved him. And then it became Johnny Depp when 21 jump street came out.

Speaker 4:          00:15:41       Oh my God. 21 jump street. Johnny Depp. It's so cute. Yeah, he's still looks great though. Yeah. For total look great. I know. Crazy. He was wild to dude. I know. I wish she would, uh, hit the craziest thing. Is that a article about him? The, the spending article, he's like, he's like really has, um, like diagnosed, you know, spending impulsive. Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. He's like, buy 30 of those. Okay. The craziest thing to me still is that he smokes in his house. Rolling cigarettes. Guy Spends 30 million a month. I'm like, yeah, it's Kinda crazy. And then he's like smoking cigarettes and sound like this guy's fucking nuts right now. I wish you would come on our show, but our show is invitation only.

Um, I dunno if you guys don't know if you even know. Do you know that I'm hard rock. Nick was on tosh 0.0, oh yeah. And we got a shout out and they played footage from our show. That's pretty solid. Cool. I'm a little upset because they only mentioned Tom. They're like, and Tom Segura is podcasts. I'm like, what am I chopped liver? What about Christina p two Netflix specials. Hello? What am I fucking that just the dumb girl. Well, the gator, you know, like on radio and that like the, you know, you're, you're Rick dees and who am I? Yeah, no, I understand that.

Speaker 4:          00:17:40       Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm very offended. I'm actually very upset. The Daniel Tosh, I'm offended. Josh says in radio that that role is called the whole on the whole, Oh, the Gash. The girl, I dunno. Wall. That's terrible. Josh. Giggle. Gash. Did we come up with a proper name? Chocolate fucker. Yeah, his was giggle. Giggle. Gosh, he's out of his fucking to be fair to de to Taj though. I actually know him. Yes. So do I. No, no, no. I've talked to him backstage before. Yes.

Cat know. I've toured with Danielle though. That's right. I forgot. Yeah. But still, it's fucking disrespect. There's just some blonde chick there. Just some fucking dumb bitch and then a cool jacket.

Speaker 4:          00:18:37       But anyway. Unbelievable. What the level of disrespect aside from that little hole. Disrespect. The segment was very funny. It wasn't very flattering. And they did, they gave a shout out to they, yeah, they did say cite my name, but they played a clip from our show, correct? Yep. The two of us talking about hard rock the whole time and hard Rudnick to in his, uh, defense was, um, was game and was very fun on this. I have to give him credit. He, he reacted differently than I would. I would maybe at the expected from somebody so attractive and so muscular and so wealthy. I would think that somebody like hard rock, nick wouldn't even give them the media at the time of day. Yeah. He's a busy dude. He's very busy. I thought he was hilarious too, that he has not broken on his claims so on. I saw him on a rider and then they're like, and you really are worth like 100 million.

Speaker 4:          00:19:28       He's like, he's like, Yep. Doesn't he doesn't bend at all in any of those claims. Pretty Fun. That's been at least having a good time. I think he's having a good time and he's on cameo by the way. It hard, right? Yeah. I'll plug it. Okay. Shit. Okay. Go check out. I don't know what he's charging though. I know. I wonder guy that rich shouldn't be charging him. He's a millionaire. He could be doing this for free. Yeah, I know some other people do. Kathy Griffin, she does thumb. Yeah. Lance Bass approached me and I said, dad, no thanks. Yeah, it's not, you know, but I don't know. It's not for me. I personally, like I said, if I wanted to do videos for fans, I just fucking do it for free. I give shout outs to people on their birthdays and happy birthday to, yeah, we should start doing birthday shout outs like on the radio, you know, like that's fucking dumb. Whose birthday's today? Nothing. I hate more than a happy birthday. Fucking I get emails all the time. We'll be at your show on Friday. And uh, my friend Cynthia, her, we give her a shout out also. She, uh, she's got big ear lobes. If you want something to make fun of her about like, yeah, I know. I can't wait to stop my show brought to do that. It's my adult friends birthday. The

Speaker 1:          00:20:47       only thing is that crazy to me. Like you're an adult. No one compares more insane than like we'll be at your show sometimes. It's like, it was a group of us coming. Uh, ted is guys crazy. If you want to fuck with him, you know he's always got a truck. You never, it's all dirty and shit. He never, if you want to make fun of them, Ted here, why don't you wash your truck? Everyone was like, that's hilarious. So fucking stupid. No are my favorite is I get people emailing me, hey to, hey Tom's doing a show in Fort Lauderdale. Can you ask him to help me get proposed? No. That's the one that I hate the most. And by the way, just so you know how unoriginal you are, it is every week, every week I get multiple emails. We're going to be at the show Saturday and I wanted to do something really special, like what I want to propose to my girl at your show, hoping that maybe you could bring me up on stage.

Speaker 1:          00:21:53       What do you realize how little everyone at that show cares? Nobody want you getting engaged and nobody, no, I just, I had to stop myself from writing back. How much I hate them when they email me that, but well, it brings the worst. Also brings the comedy fun to all of, yeah, let's stop. Let's stop the entertainment. Let's make this show that has 1800 2,500 people at it. Let's make everybody stop and watch you go Alyssa. You know, you mean the world to me. You're a girl and he's all nervous and shaky and then, and then he has the story of, remember we were at that show, everyone hated us for stopping the show. So I could propose to you remember, am I going to say the club? But they would. They would. I had it happen twice. And clubs. I've had it happen several times.

Speaker 1:          00:22:43       Yes. But then the owner wants you to plug the blowjob shots. Oh yeah, yeah. Before you're set. Yeah. Does Dallas Fort Worth yet? It's so stupid. Just go ahead and plug these blowjob shots and then just go worse. That's the one where the guy goes, you're the only guy that's ever said anything about this. He told me I was the only guy that's ever, I was like, okay, all right man. Yeah, no, I had, um, I had proposals. Here's what I had though. So the first time I ever had it happen, I was working at club and they were like, some like they basically informed me, they were like, someone's going to propose that. I was like, okay. It was as bad as you can imagine. Guys all nervous and like people and then people are getting, when I realized how much everybody hated it by the next time it happened, they had to ask me.

Speaker 1:          00:23:30       They're like, do you mind if somebody proposes during the show? And I go, I absolutely do mind. And they were like, hmm, what can we do? And I was like, you can wait until I'm done with my show and I go, you can do it after the show. And that was the compromise. I was like, once I'm off stage and back in the green room, I don't care. You can have the guy take a shit on stage and people are filing out. Yeah. So that's what they did finish with their Nachos. I've had people ask me to marry them a lot and um, I'm not going to do it just cause I don't, you don't want me. Yeah. I mean I appreciate the, no, the offers. Nice. That offers. Nice to say. Would you like to be the efficient of my wedding? The offer is insulting and selfish to say.

Speaker 1:          00:24:11       Do you mind if I propose during your show? Because it's just so you know. You're fucking rude. Okay. Oh my God. You're selfish. Your balls are freshly shorn, but they're back down. You need to get your Dick Mount tonight. No one wants to snapping already had started. Can propose price testosterone running through you right now. No, you're right, and again, I don't, I appreciate the offer to officiate your wedding, but I, I'm not the right candidate. That's different. That is different. That's saying, would you like to come to this thing? It's an invitation like this podcast. It's invitation only. That's absolutely right. It's the same thing. Not just any. A whole can come on here and you can just send me a fucking thing, you know? Hey, why can I be, no, no, no. Of course we have to Ordain you worthy of being on our show right now. Who is he getting text message from sexting?

Speaker 1:          00:25:10       Can we try it out your beard and trying to fuck and I knew that would upset you know that man. So in that ever since I've been going like real short with with a haircut and everything, I have to do this horrible maintenance of getting it clipped all the time because it starts to look shitty. Would it has any growth on it? Like getting haircuts like every two weeks when the beard is a little wily look. Well I like it a little look dirty. I like, but you don't understand. That was my attraction to you is that you look dirty and gross and homeless. I like it. Don't you get that? I've always loved that about you. That you're just nasty, stinky bear. I like it. Oh Harry and stuff. I love your soul. Have whiskers for an image of myself. Yeah, of course. But I like it when you're a little unkempt.

Speaker 1:          00:26:00       It's masculine. All right, well I just meant that like, so here, obviously in the front it's thinned out. So when you have thin hair in your front of your head and you're doing the buzz cut, you got to keep it short. Otherwise when it gets any growth, it just highlights how thinned out it is. You know what I mean? Sure. So it started to get there and I was like, I seem to go and get it cleaned up. I keep calling these two places to do it because they're near us. One of them is always packed and I never remembered to call ahead of time. I always called day of, we'll call it like nine in the morning. And they're like, we're completely packed at him. Like Jesus Christ. How many people are getting their damn haircut? I Dunno, they, they're like, you want to come and wait and I'm gonna go.

Speaker 1:          00:26:38       No. So I called the second place and there was a lady who did a pretty good job. Of course she's not there. So I go in yesterday and I tell the dude what I want and I mean it's not totally fucked up, but he fucked your beard. He fucked my beard up. I'm not, you're the one that said that when you came. I know, I know. Just so you know. The funny thing is I gave him like, I give them all a nice, I'm nice, but I go with them like really explicit instructions and he was like, yeah, I get it man. And he did it and I was like, that's not what I wanted.

Speaker 1:          00:27:13       But the good news is you're, it grows fast. It does. So in a week it'll be normal again. He cut the line, he took it up. Here's what's wrong, is that he cut like he gave you the dad line like your, your beard grows. It's got to go further down here and the chin. I know he's not American. Oh, he was of course not unexplained was he did, he did. He was sitting microwave is curry fucking morning. I had my coffee yet. Fuck, fucking morning says that fucking morning. Yeah, that's what I want. That's how I would want a boss to talk to me. Me Til you get to work. And he's like, it's fucking morning now. It's time enough with the business. We're going to get into it. We had the great pleasure, the joy, the benefit, the wonderful time to have Sean Evans here. So delightful and invited him on the show.

Speaker 1:          00:28:22       Yeah. And he was like, yeah, just like hot ones. You know, Sean is the host of hot ones, the wildly popular online show, a youtube show, a that first we feast. It was on the last season. Um, yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a big show and Sean is like just the sweetest guy, I think the best host and interviewer in the game. He's absolutely my favorite person that's ever interviewed me and I love watching him hosts that show. If you've never watched hot ones, you can do a deep dive on that. It's so fun. They might Shaquille O'Neal episode. Yeah, we just watched that one. Um, he has usually has, you know, a mix of like athletes, actors, rappers and comics. Always plugging a comic and every APP every season. Um, and it's great. And so I'm thrilled that he came here. We had the best time with them. We played our own game with him so we played wet ones with them. So, uh, hope you enjoy it. Here is Sean Evans. Everybody. Hey, what's going on everyone for why? Mh I'm Thomson [inaudible] and you're watching wet ones. The show would land water and even blend or questions. Our guest today is Sean Evans. John, you are the CEO, chairman, host

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       president and director of, what's it called? Hot one's hot ones. Yeah, that's another show. Anyways, that show is much better. So first up we're going to give you, um, this is a shit water for shit. People that don't know any better. Go ahead and crack it open. All right. I won't even taste mine cause I think it tastes like dog shit. Yeah. You know that tastes like, what does it taste like? Hold on. Jam. Like it's disgusting trash. Do you have like a, do you ever have a hose attached to your house? Yeah, yeah. I used to do that and pull that move. Yeah. Now it does taste like hose water. I agree. Sean, what's your favorite color? I was actually thinking about this the other day cause I think I just wear creams and grays and blacks all the time, but I feel like those are boring colors.

Speaker 5:          00:30:36       It's like I'm happy that orange exists. Do you ever, do you wear it though? No, cause it looks horrible on me, but orange I think is my favorite color. I can create it though. You at the point now where then you start to appreciate somebody who will wear colors. You know what I mean? Like bold. Yeah. Sometimes I'll see somebody and like an orange or like a a real blue that pops. I'm like, Yo, I wish I could be you. I'm not. It's aspirational. It's aspiration. I won't do it. Yeah, we won't get there. Next up is aquaponics, this natural spring water. You know the difference between that bullshit Disani in this minerals. Oh yeah. You can taste the minerals for real. Yeah. No, I, if I would reach for this when I'm wanting to quench my thirst and then it's an exotic drink. But if somebody offered you this bottle of pis or this this a hundred times, I'm going to put this, I think we should square them off.

Speaker 5:          00:31:33       I'm going to put this to the my right. That means a preferable place. Shawn, did you ever think in a million years that you would be doing what you're doing now? No. I mean we didn't even think that, uh, you know, we didn't even have that high hopes of for the show. Like just in general, what do you think it was a one off or no, no, I thought that we could make this quick fire Internet side show, you know, like celebrities coming in, burning their face off. I thought, you know, even, I didn't know if necessarily it would have a host or that you'd see the host or that it would play that role in it. Originally, our idea for it was it for to be this like swinging light interrogation show where we'd just be like interrogating the celebrity and forcing chicken wings down their throat and they'd just be like fighting through these questions and the wings maybe by themselves. Like, maybe I don't even eat. And it was Tony [inaudible] from g unit who helped us workshop the show and he was kind of like, you know, no self respecting famous person's gonna come in here and just choked down wings while you pepper them with questions. Like if you want this to work, I think you have to eat the wings too. And it was really like the best and that was like unintentional that that worked out like yeah. But it clicked for us.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       Like I remember the light bulb going off or like, oh yeah, I like that. Makes a lot more sense. And then hot ones was born. Dude, it's an amazing show. Thank you to the amazing shape. And the best part about it 100% is you because you are a gifted broadcast or an interviewer. I don't know how you'd do it. I really don't. I think part of it is that you actually, it seems like you take genuine interest in your subjects, which is like what you realize if when you watch, you know, a talk show or radio interview, especially at like, we're always the subject of interviews, you know, where you go in. And like a lot of times with radio there'll be like a, they're just reading like, like a bio line. They'll be like, you went to University of San Francisco, Wikipedia and you're like, this is the second line in my bio and says, here you did Netflix special.

Speaker 1:          00:33:29       What was that like? But yours like yours or are way, way more researched in depth. It feels like you actually take an interest. Well, I think that it's such a competitive space. Like the interview space is so competitive. So if it's like you're going to get eyeballs, you know, and you're going to compete for those, then I think your show has to be that exceptionally good. And then I think the other thing that's played into that as the audience, so many people are cult-like with hot ones. They're hot ones fans and they're just, they're there every single time. So you feel like you have to impress them every single time. So it's like, let me respect your audience. I, you know what I am, I'm scared of him. I'm scared of that audience. I'm scared of them. I think they put such pressure ones. Have a Fart Mike.

Speaker 1:          00:34:15       No, but we need one. This is a fun one. You should have a farm or a show needed a fart Mike. Wow. Giving you permission to take the idea because I thought you'd cornered and if we, by the way, if you please, if you have to Fart, I'm grabbing. I'm, I've got you. Thanks. Gotcha. The only thing you know, you never know. You know, you always have to be ready. It could at any, although as a, as a, an alum of hot ones, I got to tell you, when you're in, when you're in that room and you feel a Fart, you're not sure what's behind it. Oh yeah, I know. It feels like, it feels like this might be a shit Mike real soon. Cause I remember asking after you did hot ones, I'm like, how was your Brown after? And it was, I took my, uh, I'll tell you this, you can pass this advice on to future hot ones who are hesitant to go forward with the game, so to speak.

Speaker 1:          00:35:10       When I worked at Chibo on sunset many years ago, which I think is still around the all Mexican and Guatemalan staff, they would make crazy hot dishes all the time for us, everything was like super spicy and a lot of us, you know, would be like, man that looks spicy as it's going to kill me on the way out. And they were like most of what you gotta do man, you get bread and you butter up that bread. Heavy butter lines the track. Like if you know you're going eat spices and that would completely, and now a lot of times when you go out for something spicy, you weren't in, let's say planning on it. So you're ruined. But whenever we did that, when we ate the buttered like thick buttered bread, it like, I dunno.

Speaker 5:          00:35:51       So did you do that before hot ones though? No, of course not. I'm not smart. I'm saying I remember that. Yeah. But you know, it's weird that I come across somebody on the other side of hot ones, but I always do ask them like one, what was like the next couple of days like, and then do people come up to you in the wild and they're like,

Speaker 1:          00:36:11       oh no, cause yeah, I mean the, yeah, I mean fish. I remember, okay, go in and do hot ones. As it got closer and like it was really first we did, first of all, we did the, um, the burger thing, which we'll get into it, but when we did the hot ones, I definitely had some apprehension and I was like, I was like, oh man. Like how bad is it? So then you start, you know, you're watching them, then you get distracted by how good the show is. You forget that there is going it. But then like day of or day before, I remember I called Bert because he had done, yeah, yeah. And I was like, I was like, I mean, what's going to happen here? He's like, it's hot. It's very hot, but he was like, it won't be that bad. Just so fun. And if it hurts, just let it hurt.

Speaker 1:          00:36:54       That's what he told me. He, that's good advice. Yeah, it was good. He was like, just like, he's like, you'll recover. And I was like, all right. And then I still remember being there, like, I dunno it, it kind of feels like, you know, there's a parachute in a way, but you're still like a little worked up about it. And then the thing was that for me, from my personal experience, I was like four or five weeks in like, this isn't bad at all. But then there was that the bomb. Yeah. Yeah. And that was worse than what I had imagined it could be. Right? Yeah. That wrecked me. Yeah. There's no period for that. But then it's funny because when I watched, when I watched it, and I'm just watching it as let's say, try and take myself out of it as content. I go, this is like one of the funniest parts, watching someone's struggle, sweat. Can I actually remember that? I couldn't remember.

Speaker 5:          00:37:42       You would ask me a couple of times. It gets loud. You feel like that a speaker feedback situation or something? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I was like, ah man, I don't know where to go with this right now. All right man. Just stop ruining my shot. Next water. No, go to Fiji. Just jump ahead to Fiji. Yeah, this is dog shit too. Yeah, we just put the dog shit out there to remind them that they make dogs your water. But this one, oh this is garbage. This is that. They put that all over the place. Like I feel if you're like getting her high g model chick, you product place with Ascensia. Yes. That's very specific and accurate. Yeah. Yeah. They have like a real online marketing strategy. I feel like that one we learned that the Ph stuff is nonsense. Bullshit. Yeah. Martin Risa is a American is Waterstone, Yay. Of German descent. Of course. Um, but Martin taught us a lot and one of the things you've told us, you know how when you Fiji

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       there's like a silkiness to it on your roof. Like, that's the mineral, I think it's called Silica. Silica or you could feel it.

Speaker 6:          00:38:45       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:38:47       it's smooth. That's minerals, man. That's silica and that is delicious. And that leads us to our next question.

Speaker 5:          00:38:57       Fedex or ups, Fedex or ups. Fedex, you know, like not, I've been next day and some stuff lately and every time I hit the FedEx, I feel like in New York you hit a FedEx like every third or fourth door. Yeah. So it's just in that, you know, I mean ups, I'm always like, are we fucking really doing this right now? I agree. It's such a third world. No, I don't think it's, I don't know if I've every been funding into a, Fedex has the u s on lock, but then you go international maybe with ups or what's the DHL? They do that. Like DHL ships on the Zimbabwe. You better do it to DHL. Fedex is really got it down here. Yeah. Yeah. I don't fuck with ups. No. You know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          00:39:43       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:39:48       All right. Are we moving on

Speaker 1:          00:39:51       is real bullshit, but it's crap. The reason I bring it up is that it's brilliant marketing. It's probably in the running for the dog, shittiest of the dog shit waters. And we learned a lot about this from Martin as well. It's like triple distilled, which means it's stripped of all minerals. So again, it's like, you know, I don't know. He might as well drink pool water. Right. Do you like straws?

Speaker 5:          00:40:19       Well, you know straws. I feel like there's a lot of bad PR with straws right now. I feel like I'm a bad person if I use a straw. But then at the same time I wouldn't, you know, like the metal Straw situation and the substitute, like who has time for that? Those you do? I do at the house, yeah. But then I have veneer so I'm always afraid they're going to chip arm or claiming. Yeah. But then do you have to like think ahead and plan, you know, like a straw, so impulsive, like there's just a million straws on the counter. You just grab the Straub when you're drinking something. Yeah, I have him in the, in the cupboard, bunch washed, ready to go. Yeah. And I just pawn down, put it in my smoothie, whatever. See, I know I'd have a hard time doing that. But then at the same time Strawser good because I feel like I have bad teeth. Like I feel on a genetic level really. Parents handed down bad TC that smile. How are they bad? No, I think I'm like, but I think I'm just like a on a cavity level. Like I feel like I get 'em

Speaker 5:          00:41:12       they're just, they're softer and weaker than most people's teeth, but a straw it'll help, you know, cause like if you're drinking something straw, it'll bypass the teeth. You know, you don't take on that contact. Do you use Sensodyne sensitive? Not just a straight crest three d, You know, I'm very be stripping your teeth even more. Really. I would argue you should switch to a

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       sensitive tooth paste like a Sensodyne. Well, I'm sold. Yeah, no, that's dope. Shit. I feel like your Straw wise, I feel like there's some type of like, so you know how like basically a few months ago there was like the real big push back on the straws and you started, they started to like, we're going to take straws away. Starbucks. Uh, I went into the one of these, so I go every day to one. And one of them was like, oh yeah, there's probably not gonna be Straw as soon. So now they're doing, uh, for, for ice drinks, for cold drinks, a lid with an open. And I was like, well, I just go like, well, this is just the new reality, you know, I just like, this is what it is. Like we're all becoming children. I mean, I, and I just kind of was annoyed, but I was like, you know what, I, it's not that bad.

Speaker 1:          00:42:15       And then the next week they're like, not a straws again. I was like, what happened? And I was like, people must have been like, fuck you. I'm not not using a straw. Right. Just it went away like immediately. Yeah. I Dunno. They were basically announced that, no, you're a child. And then people were like, no, I'm not. Okay. Well, I like when the people when it back. Yeah. You know. All right. Christina, what water you want to go through a straw, I guess? Well. I'm a huge fan of Avion. I would argue with all these waters and this is the highest quality. I like the taste. I will pay the extra money in the airport. It's a drink. Also a specific taste if you really, I feel like we grew up on it. Really? Yeah. You grew up on this. Wow. Damn. A lot of money. I didn't grow up on this shit. Okay. Offset. We'll call him on. You're talking about dog town hot ones.

Speaker 1:          00:43:09       I feel like it's a good water but water champ or are you going to bark this one down? Excuse me? Are you referring to him as a minor? My bad. You saw the eye contact. Wow. Looking when he said that. Wow, and guess what? Guess what? We have a new water champ bottle. It's in the store now. Go to emerge method.com/thompson garage and look up the new water champ bottle where you can pretend to be the water champ in your house. Just like she pretends to him. Pretend water champion. Watch the footage. Watch every episode of this show. I'm constantly drinking more water. Your town might smell sad. What does she say about that now? Do you feel like here you are this good looking guy, you're making money, you're getting famous, more famous everyday you're in this relationship. How dumb does that for you? But I don't know. I feel like I'm, I'm playing up in that. I feel like if you, if you pulled a hundred people and you showed a picture of, of me and, and go ahead and put all the stats, go ahead and put the resume there and then you throw one up of her. I bet 96 out of 100 are going to say he's lucky to be with her or not. She's lucky to be, yeah, I bet it would be like in the nineties the nineties your lady, what's going

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       on? Who is Shama Fram Onoway and know what our first date was actually at your guys' show. Yeah, the store let the end of the commedia and yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. And she's a fan actually. You know what? She likes the, she likes the eighties mom bit. No, a lot of people do. Right now. I'm going to have to expand on that. It's cool. So what's her story? What does she until uh, she does like this sort of thing to not, um, not comedy podcasting, but she does like OnAir hosting red carpets and so she's very pretty, she's got to be stunning to do that kind of stuff. Yeah. She was like a Laker girl. Miss California. See now you now you will end jeans. Really not, you'd walk it back though, you know a town, you know. Hold on, hold on. I want to look up.

Speaker 5:          00:45:20       I'm sorry about what I said. Laker girl. So she saw a Lotta these, I'm assuming. I don't know. I don't know, but allowed to. I don't think so. I think that, I think that, uh, are you reading about the cheerleading and stuff that's coming out? You know, I feel like it's, it's such a tough job. Like they don't get paid. They have to pay their own. Uber's out to like whatever our home, they have to go shake hands ad or whatever. You know, I think it's a tough gig being a cheerleader. And then I think, yeah, if you like talk to somebody on the team, you're, you're, you're out of there. Wow. I think it's like that. That's crazy

Speaker 1:          00:46:00       to a Laker game. And, and this is not too long. It was like a couple months ago. And first of all, this is somebody who together 15 years basically, right? Yeah. Sports, zero interest, no games. Like never. She's like, oh, you're watching a game. Just walks away. I take her to the Laker game. She's got a pool of drool on her shirt. Her mouth is open and she's like, she's like, she's licking her lips and then we get in the car. She's like, I really liked his Laker games. And I was like, Oh yeah. She was like all the, and they're so big and strong and you can see everything and the shorts. And I was like, okay. And we couldn't see enough. And the shorts, yeah, yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:46:42       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:46:43       yeah. That was, you want to tell him what happened that night. Oh, and then so then she was like, anyways, the next Laker game you can set up, that'd be great. And I'm like, okay, I'll keep it in mind that that's your new favorite activity next morning. She's like, guess what? I had a dream about. I was like, what? She goes, I dreamt that I was with you, but instead of you having what you have, you had a big black cock. And I'm like, whoa. But he had a big black dog. Yeah, it was cool. She was like,

Speaker 5:          00:47:21       okay, so how long have you been with this lady? So, I dunno. I think that show would have been like, I don't know, like 10 months ago or something. Yeah. That was really your first date. Yeah. And I remember he was texting me, you're like, oh, it's sold out. No, I know. But that's, but that was, I think he made me look cool because then you put my name on the list and then do the comedy store's credit. They're very old school that way, you know, they're very, like, these are toms guests, you know? And then like three people come down from the ceiling and they're like, oh, let me show you your seat. You know? So it's nice. You know, like they're, they're very, uh, they're very cool that way. And then we, uh, went backstage.

Speaker 4:          00:47:56       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:47:56       Member. Yeah. Yeah. We went backstage and we chatted for a little bit and then Hannibal rolled through with Thundercat. Yeah. It was a good, it was a good, I was just telling him dire state. I've been like, yeah, you looked super slender cats album on repeat. That was what you asked me yesterday. Yeah. What is it? Because you've been on a loop for, I dunno how long. I'm such an idiot. Oh, sorry. I was just saying that like, I've been listening to that album on a loop for a year and a half. And then when I met thunder cat, I had no idea who he was. I was like, hey man, and then I just walk out of here. It's true that southern famous singer were in there, beautiful girl. And Hannibal was with them. And I was like, what do you guys do like for musicians? And I was like super famous.

Speaker 5:          00:48:43       Oh No, you are. Yeah. No, that's a, that was par for the course. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Okay. That's cool. Yeah. Just coming full circle married. Yeah. How it'd be pop the question stuff. Jesus. Why don't you fucking lay off a little bit? I love it. I can't wait. Hot seat. Yeah. Yeah man. All this shit away from my face. How many seasons are we into a hot ones now? Eight. Eight season. Eight finishing in a couple of months. 150 episodes. Can you announce anybody that's coming up or no. Is that like top secret? I don't, I don't really care. The only thing is like, fans get sold like Wah Blah, blah, blah, like when they're like looking for a, their episode. Um, but I don't really care. I think so this week we're dropping Billie Eilish next week.

Speaker 4:          00:49:24       Shack. Hmm.

Speaker 5:          00:49:26       Wow, man. That's got a big one.

Speaker 4:          00:49:31       That's where I live with Shawn.

Speaker 5:          00:49:35       Can you imagine? Imagine that though on Tom's body. I know what dreams are made of when, when? Funny question to ask you that. Okay, fine. Any questions? Yeah. And the

Speaker 4:          00:49:51       Theo van after that. Yeah. And then

Speaker 5:          00:49:56       we shot one with Chelsea handler. Oh, good. There you go. It was good. It was fun. I like. Um, I liked it by the way that you keep the comics in the game. Thank you. Bad. Like you've had the, you have the big movie stars and then you have athletes, rappers. But I love as comics. I love that you keep comics in the loop and I think that's just good for a show to just cranking the cops, you know, like people, I think sometimes people want like a very specific kind of viewer experience all the time. But I think that that's what makes it good as when it's like this sort of island of misfit toys, you kind of know what expect but at the same time don't know to expect a week over week thing. So thank you for saying that because we take a lot of pride in that.

Speaker 5:          00:50:33       Absolutely. Yeah. And then we booked like a big finale today. I'll keep that hush for now and then and then and then we, and then the show is, so I did, I did. That's a good one. Yeah. And then, and then we'll take like a couple of weeks off. I was fair to you after, I guess the NFP and then, um, and then we'll take just a couple of weeks off and do it again. You know, it's on, it's on fire, you know. Thank you. I appreciate that. And there's a, you guys are actually, you have hot sauce out there. What's game? Yeah, yeah. I show. Can I bring you a gift? Yes. Oh my gosh. That's awesome. We use hot sauce. Oh, snails, plastic hot sauce. Got The classic. Bam. What else we got here? We got the lowest Kelly and just the way he would have been. Oh, last DAB that, you know, this makes you go caca and your pumps.

Speaker 5:          00:51:37       The last Dab. I love it. Yes. Twila pain. When you do the show, that's what you throw on the last week. You want to die, go for it. And then you'd do it. So it's here. My, it's funny to watch. I think that's the best part is watching people react to, that's half the find is like, oh my God. And it's watching famous people hurt is pretty funny, right? Because I think too, uh, it's, that's the most common man thing, like celebrity is inherently this unobtainable thing. And it's like everyone's always trying to make these like, what's it like to have a beer with them shows, you know, but like really the most common man thing is dying on hot sauce. It's like something that's like, nobody knows and it's like the only legal way to like physically harm someone. It's, it's such a great concept and it is like this, it's relatable in a weird way, right?

Speaker 5:          00:52:29       Yeah, exactly. Like you're like, I know what it's like to eat something spicy and then to see the different levels of suffering is like amusing and entertaining too. And that's been such a, an education for me because, um, now that I'm thrown into this world, it's not like I was some hot sauce guy or chili pepper guy before all this happened. But it is crazy. The range people have, you know, some people can eat a curry and it's fine. It's just chill. They might as well be eating cereal and then some people like one bite and they completely start to melt down. You know, so that's even interest tolerances. It's incredible all over the place. Yeah. People really, some of them, you know, if you, if your life is spent eating certain foods, it's like you can't yeah, you can get there. Yeah. You can't even scare them. Right. And even now, like having done this so frequently, like now I can, you know, the tolerance is definitely gone up. Are you sure? You know when I was in Korea I would go eat in the more

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       authentic, you said Korea, Korea. I would train myself. I would order Soondubu in there, hot as soups and I would just blow it out. I get like diarrhea every day and then by the time I came back to the states, did you see me eat? I should. All the time Korean food came cheating. I would say 2012 but I don't get diarrhea anymore. You can really train yourself. Your biology completely flips. How has this work going to ask? Doctor drew this question? You don't know him. It starts with a B last name with a k because it be alcohol, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink. Nothing happens.

Speaker 4:          00:54:05       He's fine. He can drive one of the most racist Faddis you've heard of him? [inaudible] hot wings though. Is that it is a, it's sadistic. When you want to hurt yourself or masochistic. I always forget how to say it as to which one anyways. It's self punishment going into it. Is it masochism when you hurt your baby and I love him. I know anything, I don't know. But it's like you looked like you'd know you're really into that stuff but you order it just to punish herself. You know it's like the most, it's the most bizarre meal and I do it a lot. Like I eat them a lot in airports and stuff. Do you like working on planes? I'm like, why am I doing this? I throw a hot sauce sometimes when I don't want hot sauce because it's offered, I order a lie, a lot of eggs and on the road and they're like, you want a hot sauce?

Speaker 4:          00:54:57       And in my mind I'm like that really? I'd be like, Yup. And then I don't know. And then like sometimes I'll be like, that's not enough hot sauce and bottle and drown it. And then I'll be like, this is going to hurt. And then I eat them like off, everything hurts. Now my stomach hurts. Do you ever catch a buzz off it in a weird way, right? It's like a high catch, a little high. Sometimes. I like it to hurt my mouth. If it's sour too. I love sour. I'm like, oh fucking burns. I love to, I hit you up about this stuff. I love studying the business of, of, you know, we do like entertain, I love the numbers on the phone and I, you know, as soon as you owe that Gordon Ramsay, uh, episode, uh, blew up. Yeah. You know, I was hitting you up like you believe this shit cause I was excited for, you know, it's crazy too because, uh, you know, from the time that we put up the first episode with Gordon Rate or without Gordon Ramsay first episode ever, everyone's like, Gordon Ramsay has gotta get on the show.

Speaker 4:          00:55:56       He got to have Gordon Ramsey on the show. And then like, that pressure was so loud all the time. Like every tweet, people would respond to it as like, when's Gordon Ramsey on the show and my ige comments, like whatever. So there was so much pressure that like forced us both in the room together and then you feel like you have these ridiculous expectations for it. But we're like, all right, well we'll just going to throw the kitchen sink at them. Just try to, um, you know, just make this just the most outrageous experience. Then he went to Bristol farms and like picked up all that stuff

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       that he was like using like the lemon and lime juice. Did donuts. Yeah. And he's just like fighting off the spice that way. He was really aggressive with it. And we'll, the Brits, the Brits are, they have like a real aversion. Their palates very bland. Every person from the UK that we've ever had on the show has always been struggle city. Yeah. Cause I run Russell brand funny to see him. I mean it was like doughnut bite every, like the sweet, you know, it came from an educated place to, as a, as a highly trained to showman level. I A showman level. Um, but the other thing that's fascinating is like, obviously I know he's super famous, you know, like, you know, he's a well known person, but to see that response to that degree is like, I got excited just seeing that response mean to like, we'd never had anything that crazy, you know, like we knew we'd drop it and it would do well.

Speaker 5:          00:57:17       Like we knew that, but the way that people just took with like the way people took off, I don't know, probably like 30 million or something. Isn't that fascinating? That's crazy, man. It's wild. It's great. Good for you. Yeah. So crazy. That is crazy, man. That is, that's nuts. Um, eh. Oh, do you wish you were taller? Yeah, I think like if I think about things I'd change about myself, adding two or three inches would probably be in the top five. Yeah. I would love, I think I would take six to and just be like, how tall are you? Are you six foot? Yeah. I'm like right at it, you know? But I feel like six two would be like, you know, you're like one of these guys who's like six, eight, you just like a fucking monster walking around and you don't want that. Especially if you can't ball then you'll know.

Speaker 5:          00:58:06       Then it's like your hand is way over there. Like how would you even control? I've got one. Okay. Would you rather be taller or have your peanut B Baker? What's up with how dissatisfied are, I'm just asking. It's just rather your answer for me. I'm just thinking because I was just thinking women don't want to be taller. Generally. I don't want to be tolerant guy. Absolutely. I wish I had a smaller boobs, but I could buy that. What would you want from me? What would you want from me? What would you want from me? For, for you? For me? Yeah. Perfect. I don't want anything that's called a wife John. I wouldn't want, why would you want taller or a bigger pener taller. I feel like I feel good. I'm like a Dick level. I feel good. Like I feel like I just have like, like one you draw. Like I feel like it's very like, like what they'd sell in the store, you know? It's very, it's like factory standard and I feel good about it. And then a, it's nice, but then yeah, I would like to get taller. What do you want? Would you like to have like hair, like surfer dude hair? You know what? I don't have, I don't if I would either. I don't

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       know. Like, like people are like, oh, you know, you're like, we have a similar thing going on. Right? Yeah. And You keep it close. It doesn't bother me in the least same. And I kinda like it the way that I cut through the air, you know, the way I feel the breeze, you know, it's, it doesn't perspective. I actually liked the way it looks. I don't think I'm in the dance. I'm good. I mean if somebody told me like, Hey, would you rather be like, like her perfect physique or taller, that's one where I'd be like, perfect physical. I'd take perfect physical cause he can, I can I, you know, I made it this far. I don't, I don't obsess about the height. Whatever. Who can I, I'm sorry. Were you going to say no, I was just going to say I wish I had awesome.

Speaker 4:          01:00:00       Do you wish I had like another couple inches down here in a movie? So little more growth credit. Kind of like the water bottle where you're like, okay, okay, I got this from a movie I get. Again, I can't take credit for it. Would you, would you trade five years of your life? You lose five years of your life to be in perfect shape to have like a model's body. Even hesitate on that five off the end. Um, I'm not going to tell you which five could be five prime years. I'm going to take five prime years. How does this work? They've just go into a coma or whatever and then you can like take away 30, you go to sleep at 30, you wake up 35 and that's, that's a coma. Sure I'd take it, but your body's Rad. Like you, you look perfect. There your whole life.

Speaker 4:          01:00:55       I think I'd take that. Take those years gone. Yeah. Fuck it. Yeah. Now check out right now. Where do I sign it and then I'll just come back and you're like, the boys are in school. They're doing well. Your children's lives just for the first five years, nothing important happening. I'll come back to like, who are you? I'm like, your dad, who was Lebron? And I'm like, oh my God. Yeah. Okay. What about you? Yeah. You check out. Yeah. I don't give a shit. If someone were to be like, now because of my children, like if you go back to being like 30 to 35 fuck those years. Yeah. Take Em. Fuck those years, those years you've got married. Don't care. Don't care. But I, you know, when you come to the realization like I just have in your brain, you always have the hope that one day you'll have a perfect body.

Speaker 4:          01:01:49       I'm going to work out and I'm going to look perfect. It's never going to happen for me. But you finally, are you there, right? Yeah. Like I had that realization this morning. I was like, oh, this is, this is all racked today. But you had the realization that this is as good as it's gonna get. This is, this is it. I had two children. The, this has ravaged, this is gone. You feel like it's all downhill from here? Absolutely. I mean I'm going to maintain and do plot these twice a week and I'm going to eat well, it's not going to get great. It's what I'm saying. I'm never going to look like a model.

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       Yeah. You know what I mean? I kind of

Speaker 4:          01:02:23       do you still hold a delusion that you're going to be how you look when you were 20? Yeah, sometimes. Yeah. I think I get, I think I do. Yeah. And then what will happen is like, you know, you have like a couple of good or decent naked days, like yeah, you go to the show, especially if it's like, uh, worked out like three days in a row. Yeah. And I just came from listening. So if the muscles are a little swollen, like just like blood in them and you're like, you know, this is pretty good.

Speaker 1:          01:02:49       And then maybe like a, you have a day off and then the next day you're like, how did my body go to shit in a day? You feel like, I mean it must be obviously all in your head, but like I'll feel like, oh no, it's, it's back to shit again.

Speaker 4:          01:03:01       But maybe it makes it kind of lazy sometimes I feel like it does that where I'm like, Oh, well I could snap this back in at any time, so fuck it. You know,

Speaker 1:          01:03:09       now I feel like I'm, I'm pretty far from it being even decent, you know. No, no, it's good. That's good. That's nice. You're a nice guy. I mean, no baby. You are. You're beautiful. Beautiful to me. Thanks man. You're a handsome man. Appreciate it. I'm on, I'm in movies. You are, you're in perfect. I love him. I just booked another mood. It's not a PT now. All my parts, by the way, in the last I just booked apart. I did three last year. The parts were like obnoxious brother-in-law, a corrupt city councilman. Yes. Corrupt police officer and coming up, uh, corrupt. Uh, or like asshole tech guy.

Speaker 4:          01:03:57       The family one with Mark Walton. That's, that's good. He's just tall. It's got a good rotten tomatoes though town that does it pretty well. Right? But I've told you this, that you're going to flourish as an asshole. You're character is asshole. My style. You're good at it. But that's what he's good at. Camino. Yeah. She goes, you know what your key is? You know the way you've said it to me? She goes, you know what? You're really going to really do well in and I'll be like, what? She goes, you're a fucking scumbag. You scumbag. She's like, you're a, well, she knows he's a shows casting. Yeah. Aesthetic like, you know, you don't know how you look. You look like a scumbag.

Speaker 4:          01:04:34       Homeless, degenerate. You married this. I love it. Well, why do you think, who are my types? Yeah, she likes Benicia and I'll tell you what I mean. So what's the guy with his dick in the girl's mouth? Vincent Gallo. Ah, I like crazy homeless, looking smelly. Lifterlms all catcher. I'll catch her at a stoplight looking at a homeless, kind of licks her lips a little bit. I'm like, oh, stop. It was like, oh, he needs a hand stop. No, his legs. Sean, do you ever play this game when you're on an airplane and people are filing passed you? Um, when you see a woman, do you go like, that could be I, I think I could love her. And then you find something immediately wrong with her or like, could that be my spouse? And then you go, no, I'm because

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       she's got like her hair is parted poorly or three toe rings. Yeah. I think I am like a people watcher foyer at heart and sometimes I find myself staring at someone and then trying to think about what it would be like to walk a mile in their shoes or something. Yeah. I start to like wonder what they're like or how, you know, if I see somebody walking by carrying bags of stuff, I'm like, you know, how did they end up in this position in their life where they're carrying those bags on this street and stuff. And then I find myself thinking about it, I think a little bit more than your average person, your average walker by would, you know? Yeah. But I don't do that specifically in the plane. I'm not like, oh, I could marry that person. Then trying to find something to disqualify that. Oh that's pristine. And saying, that's my game. I think I could love me. I can never love you. And then I'll find a superficial reason. Do you find yourself going a rooting for who's going to sit next to you and all these all the time and praying. It's not that person, but it's always that person that smelling next year. So I've got to ask you this because it seemed like,

Speaker 1:          01:06:21       I actually think you have the best gig going in entertainment. You know, it's like such an awesome job and the show keeps getting better and the, you know, they get, it's like, it feels like it's a perfect gig. Right.

Speaker 5:          01:06:33       You know, and a lot of ways it is everything that I always wanted and it's a small team, you know? And every time I talked to somebody else who's doing some other thing, I popped the hood on it and I realize like I'm happy that I'm in my lane doing my thing and nine that lane doing that thing all the time. Uh, it's labor intensive. Obviously we travel so much. There's so much research built into it. Uh, the postproduction in the show plus like the frequency with which we like crank these things out, which the edit is like the key one of the most amazing components. Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate it. We worked so hard on that because I kinda just want everyone watching it to really feel that pain in those moments. You know, like I always think like the evolution of it is some imax experience where like they spit out the water and you get like sprayed with water or something. Like, I always think like it could be bigger than that. Some sort of like oculus rift, you know, a experiential thing is like when I look into the future and think about what the show could be or whatever. Um, but there is the wings, there is constantly eating death wings, you know, it given a take. Yeah. Okay. That's the part I get. But I feel like

Speaker 1:          01:07:41       most too, like the part where I go, you know, there's gotta be either it's floated to you or it's in your own mind like, well then you know the TV show, the talk show, right. It's a natural, you'd be a total obviously natural host at it. Thank you. But then you go like, you know, and you know, maybe there's a time and a place for that, but I feel like every time like for us will, you know, be like, oh, you know, you need to be doing TV and more, you know, stuff that like traditional shows closer, you are around it. You're like, oh, there's so much shit you have to deal with. And then we come here and we're like,

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       oh, we get to do whatever we want, bring out stupid water bottles and the crazy club, no one tells us anything. That's the thing, kind of the great gig and I think too is we've made this team like as we've conquered every single day added to this team. So now I love everybody that's around me and yeah, creatively, there's nobody who's going to get them my way about anything. You know, like I could die on any hill that I want to and I feel supported by the people that are on the team and I'm really proud of the show and what we do and the way that it's just sort of done laps and laps and laps around everyone's expectation and then just completely changes your whole perspective on everything. So all of those ways, like, you know, you kind of want to soak in this moment and uh, stay on track with it and maybe even try to help that train go higher and faster.

Speaker 5:          01:09:05       Uh, but yeah, I think about that all the time because people, you know, like whatever, my agent or like whoever, they'll always be like, oh, what's next? What's next? What's next? You know? Or like, that's just people and that's like nature. And I'm like, I kinda just wanna this is tightened my grip. Yeah. And just this thing right now, especially if you've got a successful thing, ride the fuck out of me. I know, but don't you feel like people are always like, well yes, let's do I want to rip all the cords out and try to put it into something else and then try to get this whole thing back? Like, yeah, fuck no, no. It's the silliest thing. If you find lightening in a bottle, which he, you clearly have and people want to watch it, just keep doing it right. And people show up.

Speaker 5:          01:09:44       So I'm like, what do I want to fuck? Yeah, but love the people fucking that Mia fund that people like our fanatics for hot ones and, and people like, you know, I've experienced the people coming up to me just from being on hot once. It's like, you know, and they'll quote lines from it and yeah, yeah I get emails about it and you know people and the they love that. They love that. Like I brought up trick daddy cause then they're like you not only were guests but you clearly had been watching the show and that trick daddy episode is like a super debt to me is the most underrated episode ever. It's not like this coin amz like tens of millions of views, but it's arguably like one of our best interviews and check daddy. What I love about it is when he first got there, he wasn't, he didn't know what hot ones was looking at it like how are we rolling like that.

Speaker 5:          01:10:35       But then you kind of see his shoulders drop and he just falls into the show so effortlessly. And then we're having this like deep dive career spanning interview on Trick Daddy. And he started to rock with it in that way. And then that acid in part that you referenced is one of the, one of the moments we're most proud of at the show. Barn away, eat a Buddha gang, eat a booty gang life. You seem like a pretty together person. Do Your parents support your career? Yeah, uh, my job with the gifts he's given them now. It was a good Christmas for my dad. But yeah, like they've always been super supportive. My mom passed away when I was in high school, but my dad super supportive even like coming out to New York cause at first it's like hard to explain even uh, you know, he's not watching youtube and stuff so he's like, oh you're going to do, you make a web talk show on the Internet and you know, like the exactly a little bit like okay.

Speaker 5:          01:11:34       But he was super supportive and then, you know, once we got people like Ricky Gervais' and the chair, once I did cold bear, like that was a big deal for him because he was such a huge Letterman fan. So like that being in the same theater and the Ed Sullivan Theater, that was like, it was like, oh okay. Like bear to play your game. I know that was, you know when he spit milk on the stage of the Ed Sullivan Theater. I was like, that was such the, it's such a top of Mount Kilimanjaro from me, you know? That's awesome man. Now you're originally from Chicago? Yes. We love, we were big fans of accent. Chicargo. Have you noticed my drawl? You all like your professional broadcasters? So smart. Did you go to a good college? I went to a pretty good college. Where'd you go? University of Illinois. Yeah, but you couldn't see ivy.

Speaker 5:          01:12:22       Oh, we were just studying on the wire. They get top dollar. I do. What did you study? Wait, Brian Broadcast. Broadcast Journalism. Have they had you come back yet? Well, I want to go back and yeah, they've kind of hinted at it and I get like tagged and like the school's Twitter and stuff and then kids that work at the newspaper. It's a buzzing thing. Same with like at my high school. Well, what I think is weird is that I grew up in a northwest suburb of Chicago and I see that the like local newspaper there, they've never said a damn word about me. You know, like they, I don't know, maybe, you know, like the hometown has never been like, it's never even acknowledged it. But um, whatever. Like I'd love to go back to University of Illinois. I think it's like, uh, cause that would be cool.

Speaker 5:          01:13:13       I think that if I were a student there now and I watched the show, I think that that would be so cool. Yeah. Like I think Hugh Hefner went there. Some good broadcast is I went to u of a Roger Ebert and me will, the accent is like the, when someone has a hardcore act, like all types of were just fascinated by it. Yeah. Yeah. But one thing that's really interesting is if somebody, I don't know if you've ever heard, let's say somebody with a hardcore Chicago accent who's actually really well educated. It's a pretty amazing juxtaposition. So check out this guy speaking and just, you know, just give us your thoughts

Speaker 7:          01:13:52       reserve on Duis. San Joaquin Delta. It's a, it's pretty amazing. It's nice to see too much of willows. You get their mesh of coast live oak growing on the shore as much invasive blackberry brambles. And despite the, the metastatic tumor of modern society, there's still a couple endangered place which haven't been knocked out.

Speaker 5:          01:14:13       I mean, this guy really knows tumor and he's kind of philosophical work. It's not just about the plant life, right? Yeah. Um, it's like that. You remember that Snl, Chris Farley, uh, like the bears go bears dot bulls. He met Jordan 242 the rest of the guys. Six six. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:14:38       It wouldn't be antioxidants. Primrose and there's just supposed to be a wallflower are risks, some of which is in a Brassica family brand stick of fame. We might've, I think it might have bloomed already. Dude,

Speaker 5:          01:14:50       I've never heard anything smart come out of that accent. Do you think he knows he's funny or do you think he's just a second? I'm like, this guy thinks he's Farley in the sketch and then I'm like, no, I think this guy really just knows this shit. And he's, he's one of these guys who's fascinated by something. No one else's, you know, like he's really laying out what plants are out there with enthusiasm I think is genuine, which makes it smart guy. The towns down with the accent. Yeah, exactly. But like I love when somebody is enthusiastic about something that was just fucking plants. He's like, hold on a second, let me give you the fucking details. He'll persuade you. Like know I'm into it a little bit more. Right. When you guys play these clips, do the people in the clips ever acknowledge sometimes guests ever reach? Yeah, like either that's so funny or stop doing it sometimes. Like always a lot of people who you're like, look at this fucking shit show. They're like, can I come on? And they're like, no.

Speaker 5:          01:15:52       And then the people who you're like, I wish we could figure out this is, you never ever hear from the lens of our desperate like king ass rapper. I don't know if you're familiar with his work. He's a gentleman that farts on food and eats the food, which we could find that guy. He's another one. Like the elusive. Yeah, I mean it's another celebrity. We'll never know. We've, we've, believe me, we've tried to find this guy. Not a chance king atrip where we actually do have him on the podcast. I feel like that would be to try something. Try that guy. I would be the move. Yeah. I would send a car. I've put them in the trunk of the car. I'd be like, yes, please come talk to some. He beat me. I don't really hire security for that day though. The guys out front I don't think.

Speaker 5:          01:16:43       Yeah, no, no. I think I'll try it out guy. We'd need to be like, Hey, can we have an armed officer here? Cause I don't know where this is going to go, but I would really love to get to the bottom of that video. Yeah, that's my favorite video of us. That's an interview on the you guys could do too. Now. Uncle Pete, uncle Terry would come on now. I don't know if we could have one. We couldn't really, couldn't we have more than you think? I don't know man. I know we can't even plays clip

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       anymore. We should probably, yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:17:11       actually. Right. If, uh, like if he's talking and he's not shoving stuff up is asked, then I don't see us getting flagged for that. But

Speaker 4:          01:17:18       I mean we've lost so much money because of that guy already.

Speaker 1:          01:17:21       Yeah, that's true. Yeah. He's really fucked us. But um, yeah, basically we're not allowed to play for people that are wondering, cause we had to cut him out of a couple things. It's because, uh, people are the video. People were like, you can't have that guy putting stuff in his ass.

Speaker 4:          01:17:42       Yeah. That's how you lose the Mcdonald's. You're really out there listening is gracious. Yeah. He, um, Terry really forced drug gang. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:17:54       Oh.

Speaker 4:          01:17:56       Oh. He's a ride or die. This right here.

Speaker 4:          01:18:05       Oh, Nasdaq. So that's, that's Terry having an orgasm. It's super slow. Mo. We're allowed to, I found that we're allowed to so nasty. Yeah. Now is your girl, is she cool? Is she in a farm board? She's, uh, she's chill. She's cool. She do foreign, not I, I, I'm trying to keep the romance alive as long as I can. I'll keep hearing this from, this is modern though. What is this? Tom has no idea. That's pretty good. Now, did you fart in front of other girlfriends now? He's not fine. He's no gentleman here town. How long before you started just freely? 14. No, it was a three week. No, no, no, no, no. It wasn't. It was a few months because I was, I remember the first time it was a, I would, I would spend the night at your place. I was, you know, next morning watching TV in your boxer shorts.

Speaker 4:          01:18:53       It was a weak one. It was a few months. It was a few months, but what I did was to, to break the fart barrier. I went, I did, instead of being like, here's a little Fart, I just decided to go for it. I didn't think about it. Yeah. But I took her hand. I put it between my legs and have Fargo on her hand for the first part and she goes, smells like garbage, smells like garbage. And then I was like, well at least we're getting there now. I think that if you're going to do it, that's probably the way to do it I think. So to wake somebody up with just the bucket full ice water, like that's exactly what happened. What did you think about that afterwards? I never really know. It's another red flag that I chose to ignore your, so, uh, you know, it was dad in the serial killer talk early on.

Speaker 4:          01:19:35       It was a red flag and I was like, I don't know. There's so many good things about yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, I just pushed past it. I just liked yet, you know, Tom, I'm so attracted to him. It's like this just thing, this, this unconscious thing. I can't control it. No matter what he does. If he farts out, he could shit on my chest and I would just be like I ear to ear. I would just adore him, feel, come on. I would adore you. That's really sweet. And you can do sweet. Besides cheat on me, I would fucking cut your painter off. But other than that, she meant that I'm meaning. That's like the only thing you could do. What counselors cheating? Oh my God. I don't know. Have, I mean we have our, I have my tour bus permission. You're bang blast privileges.

Speaker 4:          01:20:19       I'm allowed to like, I know you told him, make it, throw it around on the bus. Oh my God. I never told you that. Oh Shit. Alright. And condoms are a must. I always wear a condom. Okay. And then, you know. Right. So what did your dad do growing up? Are you, were you, are you fancy? Did you grow up fancy? No. Uh, he's a judge. So like you grew up fancies smart and fancy. I'm not fat. I didn't grow up fancy. It didn't feel that he has a federal judge. He's like a, he works for the Human Rights Commission. So, uh, you know, civil rights cases, she's smart as hell. He is smart. He's smart as fuck. Yeah. Wow. He is super smart. He's like, did you do the wing guy? Huh?

Speaker 6:          01:21:08       But that's fine.

Speaker 4:          01:21:08       Me and he was never, you know. Yeah. But yeah, but I mean now and yeah, but now I think, but that's, it's like kind of crazy about youtube in the world and stuff is cause now when guy makes more than the, the judge for sure now are their expectations for you to go to law school and follow in his footsteps. And I don't even think that he'd want that. He didn't really put, you know, I didn't, I didn't have that kind of pressure on me. I was like, Eh, you know, if anything, because he worked so much. And then so I feel like I was like almost head. Are latchkey childhood a little bit more. I was very lucky. Yeah. It was very like $40 by the phone sort of childhood, you know, like that sort of situation, garage door combination go sort of childhood. And how old are you if I may I euphoria 32 Jesus, where you're young. I shouldn't even be a latch key kid, but I thought you were 50 you're not 40 yet.

Speaker 6:          01:22:02       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:22:02       But that's great because that's really the, I mean, look gen x or is traditionally we were latch key kids and you know, we created the fucking Internet and now you guys are creating cool content on the Internet and taking it to the next level. That's so great. Yeah. I want to do the dad thing where he like, dude, without getting into it, do you do the finances where you tell him when he was like, well a little yeah, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit without getting he's, he's more, he's the it side of that that he shows is more of like he's proud of me and you know, he, it is good to have somebody whose opinion you can trust when it comes to stuff like that, you know, because whatever people will tell it. Yeah, exactly. So I actually like that my dad will be, he'll come from a place of just trying to help me, you know, of course. And uh, he would be like excited. Like if I moved to La and I had to get a car or something, like he would be excited to go car shopping with me because he's like a car guy, so he could, you know, like live vicariously

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       or something like that. Be An experience. I'd be like, I'd like to show him, you know. That'd be cool. Yeah. I hope you do do that. I know, I hope when you move into Leo, I think within the year, oh that's great. Yeah. This time, you know, cause whatever the show, uh, the way that it runs is on these, you know, 12 episode seasons and these three months on one month off sort of production schedule. So I'd be able to finish season 10 by the end of this calendar year and then I could make like a nice clean break with everything. And then just whatever, either repurpose or either relocate the shot here, which isn't that big a deal because it's basically just an editor would have to, we didn't have to like take our editor who's already a California kid and bring them to Kelly. And then, uh, and that would be kind of all that we'd need to do to make that happen. So I think like January, 2020, I'll be in Los Angeles, not in New York. Hey Sunshine. And now in your body,

Speaker 1:          01:24:03       hey, have you seen gene? This clip is from one of the documentaries that I've been watching do full volume.

Speaker 9:          01:24:10       Yeah. And there are two types of personality features that you have a great deal of. The first items called antisocial personality disorder. Yeah. Nearly as someone who does not have a conscience, does not have remorse, does not feel a sense of guilt is impulse of the typical things we see before age 15 and people who are in that label are cruelty toward animals, cruelty toward people.

Speaker 1:          01:24:50       [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          01:24:51       yeah, I think you're acting range. You could widen the scope. You could play a psychopath, serial killer, cool wall. Easy. And then the kids making these memes are getting borderline too good at them. I know you realize where technology is going next. Like you saw that guy. Oh good. The one you see the one where like he had like Rogan the bikini. It was on my Instagram, Z, Christine and p if he want to see it. That was it looked spot. I mean,

Speaker 1:          01:25:21       that didn't even look like anything, but you know, like, like it,

Speaker 5:          01:25:25       it really happened. I couldn't see the seams, you know? Yeah. It was. And this was a Jenna Sunday. Thank you Jenna. She's done a bunch of these by the way. Somebody on Twitter posted one and they're like, Hey, Christina is this Hawaiian road rules? And it was a girl in the shower. There's hits. And I was like, oh my God, is that me? That's what I thought too. I was like, Oh man, I'm a jack off to this old footage of my wife.

Speaker 9:          01:25:49       Oh,

Speaker 5:          01:25:51       it's not me. I know, but

Speaker 1:          01:25:53       duff, no, it wasn't you at first. I started such a savage. I didn't check off, but I did think it was you at first. And I started writing to, but I was like, those aren't my tits. Yeah. But she had like your expression, your shoulders and you know, ah, here we go. Here we go. And I was reaching down and then I didn't. Jesus. Well, I'm flattered that you still want to jerk it to me. Yeah, I do. Sweet of you. Bed, do it all the time. Really. Sure. It's not even the truth, but they're sweet to say. So. Oh well homie on out homie on Ya. Yeah. Yeah. Comedy content collective. A person that creates that. That's where they all get together. The uh, all those great meme makers. I'm like, they do all that network. They, so they created like this comedy content collective where like there's like, oh, dcis and Jenna and oh my gosh. They all put their stuff together tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah. So it's great. Without them, there's no silliness names. They do all the Photoshop songs, you know, just hilarious stuff, man. Um, so what, uh, what's coming up next man?

Speaker 5:          01:27:02       Just a finishing out the season. Then I'll take a little vacay and then, uh, yeah. Tell us, talk about it. And you don't want I want to do, no, not that I want to. Well, I always feel like I have to go back to Chicago. Um, say what's up to the family and you know what I want to hit this year. Have you guys been to Yosemite? No, I want to hit a national park. I want to see a bear in the wild. That's cool. This is my new move. So this is my new move for this vacay. You're gonna take your lady?

Speaker 1:          01:27:28       Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. Oh, give her pose to her at Yosemite. Yeah, I'm getting a jet. I'll give you a discount on the charter if you're looking at you. Okay. Yeah. All right, cool. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:27:41       Cool. That's a pretty, uh, exciting trip. How long, how long are you going to go for? Well, cause I only have like 12 days or something, so whatever. Maybe I can sneak a day on each side, stretch it to two weeks pop. And uh, you know, Chicago for five days at Yosemite for like a long weekend. And then right back to wolfen down chicken wings. And what do you do for fun? What's your advice? Um, well I think now I just work so much, but I find myself when I'm in La in that, in that West Hollywood vibe where there's that, you know, there's the comedy store, you may have been in dudes when you said that was really even after the whole, all right girlfriend that you know know shit. That's weird. You can ask. But there's that uh, there's that um, hotel triangle there and like Andaz like I'm a big fan of that pool on the roof.

Speaker 5:          01:28:31       Yeah. Popping into the pods. Margarita, you know, some chips and salsa. That's such a vibe up there. But then like the summer scene at the Mondrian, I liked that whole, I liked that a, I like that pool scene. Yeah. And then there's some hot ones fans that like work out there by the pool but they're like, like pool towel, grunt sorta. But that's like that's the best connection. That's the best thing. Cause they make that whole thing run beyond like those a day beds or whatever that are like have like a $4,000 a drink, drink minimum, you know, that are usually reserved for like whoever is in there popping bottles. I'll just be like eating Nachos on those things, you know. Yeah. That's awesome. Those are the bets. A good vibe. The working class person that like listens to this show is my favorite to run into, you know, like say the dude who's driving the FedEx truck or you know, sometimes they even like, you know, drive by and you could say, you know, it's like the Orkin man, the guy cutting grass and like they, it's my favorite shout out to get you one time I was at the pharmacy getting my prescription found Christina.

Speaker 5:          01:29:33       I go, yeah, he goes, I'm listening to you right now. And he was stocking drinks at the pharmacy and I was like, this is crazy. They, whenever we do a show and uh, or like whatever, if I'm speaking at some thing, it's like the people that work backstage that have the ear pieces and they're like pushing carts or like making food or stop or something. Those guys are always hot ones fans and it's like the biggest point of pride for the show. Like for the people who make it like we love, we love that scene. Plus those are the people that can make it happen for you. You absolutely. Yeah, it was absolutely. Then um, Sean, thank you so much for coming today. Thanks for having me here. The best we can hope continued success with the show and I'm hope to see you again soon man. All right, thanks guys.
