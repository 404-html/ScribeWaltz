Do you think Trump's first order of business will be to move the state, the country's capital to like Miami? That'd be awesome. Somewhere more fun. I don't think he would. He's a swimmer. He doesn't know what Miami vibe somewhere where there's more hot chicks. Yeah. It's still fucking hot chicks around here. You guys are all serious talking about likes and he likes, he does like some hot chicks, but who can blame them for that? It isn't like those bummer chicks. Thank stuff. How opinions, boom. Boom. You're ready to start the show. Oh my God. I'm so ready to, let's go jean

Speaker 4:          00:03:50       the honorable member or for a Senate Gulf islands. You're rough, my friend and her speech, but I heard her to say a word that I know is distinctly on parliamentary and I think she may want to withdraw it. The word was f a r t, z. Honorable men, uh, member for Calgary Signal Hill. Are we saying, are you serious, Mr Speaker? Like is my colleague actually, seriously, I just gave an impassioned speech that's about supporting Alberta jobs and that's what the leader of a political party stands up and has to say. No, I don't withdraw it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:27       Oh, it's Ryan. Don't bring anyone loving to this. Well, well, go to your mom's house, Christina. It's interesting. Feel the base. That's a good one. Oh Wow. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:05:21       The sound is so immense. My, my ear candy rumbling, those, you know, I got those for you. That's a gift. I got you. These are no, not recently, but yeah, a while ago, right? You just said no. I thought you meant you just got these from. No, but that was a present. Like I love these. These are what I used to wear on airplanes when I traveled a lot so I could lock out other people. Yeah, you just seal out the rest of the world. You're a huge fan of noise cancelling head. I haven't got the mini ones. The inner ear noise. Canceler yeah, they're awesome. Does that work? Okay, fantastic. Put it in your rectum. Yeah. And then your, your butthole closes and you can't hear anything. It's fantastic. All right. You know what I wish is that people in our country, I talk back like, oh my God.

Speaker 3:          00:06:09       Like why is no one talking to a president elect Trump this way? Like are we fucking serious while he gives us state of the union? You're orange. Nobody's making any sense. This is great. This just goes to show how sensible Canadians are by the way, were, were in the studio. We made it. It's still a mess. We made it though. This is better than last week. So you can actually see a little bit better than it used to me. You can see we have an actual production desk. Look at this. This is like your, um, your Dj Dad Mouth Central Station. I got my turntables right over there tables. We got special soundproofing on these walls and on the ceilings. I missed him too. I'm glad you brought him back into the fold. Yeah, that's the American. And then this is Canadian. So that's our, our Congress. It's how we talk. We talk funny, I just gave an impassioned speech and then we go and then

Speaker 5:          00:07:25       a,

Speaker 3:          00:07:27       this was amazing. This is a, this is incredible. She said f a r t

Speaker 4:          00:07:34       talking about how to retain skilled labor. Thank you. Why isn't the infrastructure minister talking about how to implement infrastructure funds and get construction workers to work in Alberta? Why does this government treat Alberta like a fart in the room? Nobody wants to talk about or acknowledge. I like that is where my constituents had been out with this government for over a year. And you know what? We're tired of it. Oh. And by the way, constituents, as I'm giving this speech, there's liberal members across the aisle that are laughing at me and they're laughing at you.

Speaker 3:          00:08:06       Okay, Ooh, I like her. Can we get her to work down here?

Speaker 4:          00:08:12       Fan of the honorable member. I'd like to use me, my friend in her speech, but I heard her to say a word that I know is distinctly on parliamentary and I think she may want to withdraw it. The word was f a r tape. The honorable men. Hey Oliver. He signals are you serious? Are you serious? Are tape, whatever it was. F, F, a, r. T. F. A. R. T. A.

Speaker 3:          00:08:50       You know who that is? That's the tattle tail tree school teacher. Teachers. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:09:00       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:09:00       Elizabeth, you fucking tattle tale nurse. Such a fucking nerd. Nerd alert. He said, what's going to happen? Are they gonna punish her for saying that?

Speaker 4:          00:09:13       I have a lot to say about the content of my friend speech. I am deeply concerned as are all people in this place for Canadians who are hurting economic downturn, but the first important, excuse me.

Speaker 3:          00:09:30       Oh good. Well just sit down. Maybe she has to follow it. Maybe she had to fart right then. I wonder how often she farts. She looks like she can, she can. She farts a lot, but it looks like they just like kind of like fallout. I think she eats a lot of TV dinners in front of the television and she farts and she pets her cats.

Speaker 6:          00:09:52       Yeah. Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Speaker 3:          00:09:57       What's going on?

Speaker 6:          00:10:00       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:10:01       And we're back. So this is part of a living in a new place. We've had a constant stream of workers work things. Nothing. Nothing really works. When you first buy a house, Internet's terrible. Internet blows the heater's not working. Uh, the pool needs where it's all, it's all under construction, but it's coming together guys. Yup. Our life, our life is almost gotten. They uh, they just shamed this lady and just sitting down. The lady who was like far T, well they should, you know, like I said, we could use a little bit of this and our, and our politics from the no fun patrol, you know. Fine. So what if someone, she said Fart in the wind. It was in the context of an event. She's The lady that when she was a kid and the teacher left the room for a second, she told the teacher came back, she said, who said that everybody could have one cookie and Simon had for Robbie had four cookies. Yeah. Fuck yeah. This, this is the syndrome of someone who needs justice all the time. Not about justice at that point. They know dickhead.

Speaker 4:          00:11:08       This is speaker. Uh, the leader of the Green party has been probably one of the most vocal opponents of every part of the Alberta economy. So I will take no lessons from her on Oh shit.

Speaker 3:          00:11:25       Alberta Bitch

Speaker 4:          00:11:27       for the set of shut Gulf islands. And I feel it's important to make something of the member's choice of words is that she then accused people opposite her for reacting at in that context, decorum is important and respect is important to this place. I remind those who are now heckling me that you are breaking the rules when you do so. I've never heckled in this place. Not once. And I've never used language that was on parliamentary, not once. And I recognize my friends passion, but I do not.

Speaker 3:          00:12:00       Stephanie's, she just sat down again. Yeah. She got fucking shot. Hold. What's up? You know as a r t I love that. I could hear her say that. Oh well she didn't even, she didn't tell her. She didn't say the word. She spelled it out, which is extra juvenile to me when adult can't repeat a bad word. Of course. That makes me crazy. Just say far dummy. Like you've never said Fart in your private life. She didn't want to sink that low. Shouldn't listen to this show. I'm like, oh my God. Elizabeth would have a real problem. This, this show should be like, it was the most offensive, most offensive. Far. Yay.

Speaker 3:          00:12:48       Four. Yeah, four, four. I remember she was from last week, the big, the big flip fluff. Ms Fluff. Great. Big forever. She is. Yeah. She was so fucking fat. Oh my God. Yeah. That was way fat. Cause bird is fat. But that was like, oh, obese. Oh yeah. That was easily to Burt's today, which has enormous, yeah. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. So yeah, so big. Speaking of that, I mean, I'm really hitting this, this weight loss thing hard. You're really, first of all, you're really hitting your drops today. I got to say, you're on point with your drops. Thank you. And you've been hitting the weight loss game harder than I've ever seen. You hit it. He's serious. Mr Speaker, like you have been, well, first of all, working out daily. Yeah. Jammin on the one the diets clean as fuck right now. You bought the, uh, that tank that you sit in for an hour a day.

Speaker 3:          00:13:45       Sweat the sweat tank. Yeah. So you're losing water weight in addition to fat. So there's a lot going on. Yeah, it's pretty great. It's pretty great. I mean, it's a, it's a full on challenge at this point about who is, you know, who's going to be less of a pig, right. Beginning of the new year. Well, and I've seen Burt's propaganda on Instagram. Yeah. I don't buy it. I don't think he's doing anything. Yeah. You, you shouldn't buy it. I mean, now it's nonsense. He's a big liar. You know, he, um, I see him telling nothing but lies all the time and he's, uh, he's also somebody who you have to remember. Oh, this is him right now shut. Oh, okay. Burnt Chrysler. Hey,

Speaker 7:          00:14:28       sure. Clean it up. No, no. Rock tweeted us in a ticket. 10. Friedberg oh, what'd he say? Uh, no. Okay. Watch my news video and then call me back.

Speaker 3:          00:14:48       Well, um, we're doing a podcast right now. Oh, son of a bitch.

Speaker 2:          00:14:53       What do you, what is your new, just tell us. Just tell us.

Speaker 7:          00:15:00       I ended up dealing with you today. I'm running on the treadmill after I did my line was I call these two bearings for those. Y'All didn't get posted back in high school. That's where I was real men put hair on the balls and the rock just back in high school line. Happy Rolling.

Speaker 2:          00:15:20       That's hilarious man.

Speaker 7:          00:15:22       Yeah, yeah, yeah. I watched the video and then, and then call me later.

Speaker 2:          00:15:25       Where's the video? Is it on your Twitter?

Speaker 7:          00:15:27       It's on everywhere. It's on Twitter. On Instagram. It's a video a day during this weight loss challenge. And, uh, and, and just instead of doing a blog, post them on Instagram.

Speaker 2:          00:15:37       Oh, another thing I want to talk, I was talking to Ari, he was saying that like we're just doing a straight up weight loss challenge. That's how I understood it. Right. He was like, well, if he's a half inch taller than you, then he doesn't have to leave. I'm like, no dude, I'm not playing that. We're doing a straight up challenge. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:15:52       Here's the deal. Here's the deal. We both measure. Okay. Okay. We both come in at six one and the whole deal is we just, all we have to get really is the pure 27 but we can get below 27 you have to pay for the trip.

Speaker 2:          00:16:11       Both of you. Does he understand that that's on him? If we hit that,

Speaker 7:          00:16:17       yes. You get totally gets it. Just simply overweight and not our number is two 27

Speaker 2:          00:16:28       okay. Okay, so 27 all right.

Speaker 7:          00:16:31       Yeah, she did a fear.

Speaker 2:          00:16:37       Okay. Okay, so that's this. That's the addition to thing.

Speaker 7:          00:16:40       That's the on that

Speaker 2:          00:16:43       a den Denim you mean? All right, so I'll look up. I'll look up this video you just posted.

Speaker 7:          00:16:53       Call me later.

Speaker 2:          00:16:53       All right. All right, sounds good. Bye. I didn't know that. So you guys only have to get to being overweight and not obese. So two 27 and above is considered obese. Well, for our height, I mean, yeah, so two days right now we're, we're grotesquely obese and if we get done at two 27 we'll just be overweight. Like if we want it to be healthy. But also you should, you should remember this though. The BMI is a super outdated measuring. No, it really is. It really is. How so explain to me how the BMI like takes into, it doesn't take into it like it wasn't taking into account like at your muscle mass. Really. It's just saying like based on an average size guy, oh you should weigh this amount, but you could, you could be a muscular guy and, and could be considered obese by it. You could also just be kind of a normal build guy and still

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       be considered obese by it. Cause it's, it's an outdated measurement. It's just taking the number is what you're saying. But yeah, it's, it's just saying, oh, you're six feet tall, you shade weigh 180 pounds, but you can see guys that are two 10 that are healthy guys. They're like, no, no, you're obese now. Cause you're, you're, so you're saying instead they should do a ratio of your body fat to muscle tone? Well, I'm saying that if somebody were to really want to find out on this scale, you should do like a, a real, uh, modern day body fat percentage. So you know how much, right, like a trainer, when you see sometimes they paint your fat and then they tell you how fat you are. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting. I was like, Bro, I didn't find them. I don't believe he's doing two a day.

Speaker 3:          00:18:35       Oh, I think it definitely just did you think so? He did it today. Okay. I'm not saying he's doing it every day. Does he have a sweat tank like you have? I don't think he has a sweat tank. Um, you know, Diet. I just can't see him sticking to it for the month, especially on the road. He's going to have so much boost flowing through a system. The problem with him and this challenge is the road that's going to be a huge obstacle for him. And that's something thankfully you don't have to contend with because he drinks a lot. He drinks on the airplane, don't forget, he doesn't fly sober. So that alone is going to be quite a challenge. Oh yeah. And it's, it's a month of that, you know of him trying to flush cannolis. Yeah, I think so too. It's impossible. This is what's cool about this Internet right now is that I can't fucking pull this up because the Internet here fucking sucks even though we've paying for the top tier that they offer. So that's always our problem. We always pay for the top tier and we never get what we want. Dude, it's such lush cause it's so hard to get high speed internet and we've had different companies and they all our garbage man dog shit. Here we go.

Speaker 8:          00:19:43       Here we go in the morning, but I'm ready to go to crossfit, waiting for my workout partner, Johnny Blade to come pick me up. And that's how you start a day. All before Tommy bonds just had his first jar of honey. Oh my hat fucked off.

Speaker 9:          00:20:05       Doesn't look good. It doesn't look good at all.

Speaker 3:          00:20:12       No, he's wearing a rock tee shirt.

Speaker 9:          00:20:15       Oh.

Speaker 8:          00:20:17       Oh my God. He looks like shit. We are in jungle. Heading back to the man cave. What? I call it two a day. For those of you who didn't get pussy back in high school, uh, two days with us. Bad ass used to do to grow hair on her fault. It's getting real up here. Can you hear the music playing?

Speaker 3:          00:20:39       It's funny, he goes funny. He didn't do two a days cause he didn't play ball. Well wasn't he like a, what did he do in high school? He would fucking hung out. Yeah. He's one of these guys too that like, oh my God. I remember one time I, when I asked him, I go, did you play football in high school? He goes, oh, supposed to be like one of the next best players at my school. Like supposed to be great. But then I injured my shoulder. I was going to like everyone was talking about how good I was going to be like hypothetically, he was proud of himself in college. His movements are terrible in college. Wasn't he van wilder? Yeah, he was a lunatic. Partied. He didn't even do the sports, so that looked really bad when he was terrible. It look like I got a 50 year old dude trying to work out and you're like, stop it. You're going to pull your back or something. Yeah. He's gonna hurt himself. I hope he got approval from his position before he started. I should do, I should do a video just where I show him how to do this. This is bullshit. He did once you've been doing this already for months, I'll take them to a class. Oh, remember when you did crossfits? Oh my God. He come home and you're like, oh, it's a burpees. Burpees.

Speaker 3:          00:22:00       Yeah. I did a plank yesterday, uh, two minutes. First Time my entire life. Pretty cool. You're just going to, you're not going to give me any kind of props. I am proud of you. I think that's great. I think I really do think that's great. I'm glad to 27 it's a magic number. That's your record. No booboo to 27. Oh, I thought you meant to 27 was how long you planned for? No. Oh, just to two minutes. That's fantastic. Yeah. Two 27 is not obese. Okay. So No, you know, um, yeah. Pretty incredible, right? Very. Can't believe I didn't do two a days and you throw it to today's joke out. So fucking funny. You know, bursts never even been to Russia. No. That whole story is just, it's, it's all exactly. That's right. Yeah. They didn't really call him no. And he calls himself, I'll stories guys.

Speaker 3:          00:22:55       It's all stories and his diet's probably not clean. Oh my God. He's not eating clean and not boozing mean maybe for a few days. Maybe a week. I could see him when he's home. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's got leftovers because they blow it out the crushers. Oh yeah. And there's, I'm sure he's eating leftovers. It's still sugar. We throw it out. We got, we ate one day and then I throw it all out the next day. Stuffing, green's paints, tomatoes, tomatoes, checking, Bam, Bam. Throw it out. Yeah. So we didn't have, we're not tempted to go to it. That's how dedicated I am to my husband. Winning the obesity challenge. Challenge and not obesity challenge. That's right. Two 27 jeans. You're almost there getting closer. Oh Dude, I'm getting closer. Yeah. Written clean, clean eating, clean living, fitness, jumping rope, making boxing. Boxing's I wanted to bring up a story. We had the electrician come this week and he pushed the doorbell and I answered and he goes, Oh hey jean. And I had thought that I was heard and I let him and I go, I think he just called me gene. And then later he goes, all right Jeanne, you very much,

Speaker 2:          00:24:16       cause he heard me call you jeans a few times and like jeans, do you want this here? So he was like, he was like, I'm picking up on it. You know. He was like, oh there's like Jane. You loved it though.

Speaker 3:          00:24:29       Yeah. I mean for a split second, because we have had workers come through here that are fans of your mom's house. And I thought for a second, maybe this guy is like a fan of the show or something. Oh, for sure. He's a little, he's a little older so I don't, I didn't think so, you know, but just the fact that someone called me gene based on you is pretty great. Pretty Great Jean ll the morning gene flow gene. Um, that was fun. It was fantastic. Jane Jane,

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       when this club's up, I would say that you actually said, oh, interesting. First you're blaming, wait a minute, I'm the apprentice of accents. You're the master of eggs, but you lived there. Yeah, I know, but I was tired and not paying attention. I'm just saying, I think I followed your lead, but you're the master. I'm just saying, I think you polluted my mind for a moment. Uh, but then we had a number of people write in a very upset saying this is absolutely very clearly not British. It's Australian. And then people on top of that wrote in and go, this is Kiwi. Well yes, you're right. Now allow me to clarify cause I read all the emails and I've done my, uh, my research here. I heard the first speaker is Momster alien and this key, this guy, this New Zealand guy wrote and he's like, I was so happy to hear that we're going to shit on the ozzies cause I gives us Kiwis. Great Joy. Yeah. And then he goes, the rest were Kiwis. Oh really? The first speaker is mom's trillion and then all these lunatics so that the dog wrangler is Australian and then these little savage pigs, what's of his are Kiwi, right? These suck pigs and they're laid texts. Dog Fetish costumes are Kiwis. Wow. Right. What a masterful right accent this man has. Right. It's really weird.

Speaker 10:         00:28:03       Pops. We've had a bit of arrests, but it's training. What's involved in here? Pop place at first seems really simple because most people think you just get the most value. Right. Waddling around and for the buck buck, but it's really so much more complicated. Oh my God.

Speaker 3:          00:28:22       Complicated than this. When do you guys pull your dicks out? Yeah,

Speaker 10:         00:28:25       when he sent that he's Seiko that belongs to somebody in the room. We'll dump up. See, I knew it was mine. Well done. Oh God. It's so fucking bugs.

Speaker 3:          00:28:35       Petting the puppy in the latex costume.

Speaker 10:         00:28:39       It's upsetting. It wasn't any other trainers. There wasn't anyone to teach me. You lived in Australia to Adam. I know put together, but I will say, can you press pause? Yeah. Is that his accent?

Speaker 3:          00:28:53       His accent feels subtly Momster alien. It's, it doesn't sound as much as like Gig you go day by. Yeah, yeah, yeah. When they toggling tog o we have a big Australia now I'm here. Yeah. Yeah. One of the clips coming up. That's right. Pop lately. Yeah. How much for you to do pup play with this guy in charge and just all these other guys and they all recognize you from your Netflix specials. Even with my dog, mass gone. Well, they cut your beard out of the mass of people can recognize good die my FM Netflix. Hey, you sure this guy? You know, he pulls his dick out and just Mal Fox. All these dogs, they don't mention that. I know, but you know that's coming. Of course. Why else are people wearing this tech shit?

Speaker 10:         00:29:42       Oh my God. He's smelling the other guy's ass and aesthetics and SafeWork. Oh, for fuck's sake. Putting that altogether. I've become, I become a trainer and I own and backing it again. Hey, who's your honor? I use your own. No, that's right.

Speaker 3:          00:30:00       Yeah, I should have gotten this. It's very disappointing. It was a sad day in your mom's house. Yeah,

Speaker 11:         00:30:06       I was going to be honest and I'm going to be open about who I am.

Speaker 3:          00:30:11       That's who just said that this guy in a full fucking ridiculous dog mask and latex suit, dammit. And by the way, fate, perfect smile, dog teeth. Perfect smile. By the way, these late full body latex dog costumes can't be cheap. No, it's a real investment of real investment team. Also investment of your time to live at this fucking perverts house in his cage to get the realistic dog face costume with your eyes cut out. I guess a really aggressive like, you know, costumes and masks can go one way and yet that's a really aggressive looking. Doesn't it look super aggressive? Of course. Yeah. But that's his puppy nature. That's his nature. He wants to express Tom. Oh yes, sure. So gross. I is so, it's so not my lane. I'm just so, I'm so not into this stuff. Yeah. Where'd it go though? I don't know. Make Fun of them, but I want to hear the difference between the Kiwis and the mom's sterling. It. Okay. Okay. Cause I'm not sure

Speaker 11:         00:31:12       and I'm going to be open about who I am, about who I am. I'm not ashamed of the fetish or muffled of the people that you should be ashamed though. A little beautiful, very ashamed. I'm not ashamed of the fetish. I'm not ashamed of. Why not people that I hang out with. I think you should be just a little bit, I suppose that I want people tonight. It's a normal community. It's not, I don't think that I should be hiding it away.

Speaker 10:         00:31:37       You can read it 100% sure. Just like the guy that Mary's, there wasn't any other trainers. It wasn't. Can you want to hear that difference? Right? Yeah. Wasn't well, I can't cause a muffled. It might get, it wasn't any other trainers, Thales and tried anyone to teach me, so I had to go out and learn and put together. The idea is well done. Secret got a present for me. Pretty boy. Good boy.

Speaker 3:          00:32:01       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         00:32:03       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:32:03       I took it off of a relief to get that off. So now put it back on. Your parents are watching

Speaker 11:         00:32:10       and I'm going to be open about who I am that I'm not ashamed of the fetish. I'm not ashamed of the people that I have and I suppose that I want people can buy and normal community. We live in this guy's cage hiding it away.

Speaker 3:          00:32:29       A relief to get that off. So what? What the little relief to get that off. Yeah. So Kiwi, I mean, I guess sounds a little more of the bling. What are you doing? No checking a message. Oh, who's calling? I don't know. I got somebody just left me a voicemail. I don't know if it's a, Oh, okay. It's a different guy. Um, I don't know if it was the guy in the house. Oh, I gave my number. Oh, it's the Harry is he let letting you know. I mean, he seems happy. He's fine. He's very happy. You would think for a sense of like, Hey, I want to keep my day job. Yeah. I don't need my friends and family to know that I dress up like a latex dog and sniff other guy's butts and then you know, yeah. F them. You don't, you don't need people to know. Just like what we said last week. Sometimes my trainer, he, he helps me. You know your dog trainer? Yeah. It's just like the gays. Yeah. I asked him, would you ever date your mom asked him, would you ever date your mom? He was like, Yo, really word.

Speaker 3:          00:33:33       He calls me mom, you know? I mean, you know what I mean? Yeah. So dumb. So dumb. Fuck him. What's up man? That's something else. I wouldn't even open up that can of worms. It's just like the gays. Yeah. God. It's just like the game is still one of the most alarming things we've ever, in my opinion, played ever need to buy. It's one that lingered around the house for days. He kept quoting that one for days. It's crazy. I asked, I'm your mom and you're my son and I if falling in love with him. He said, are you really? I said, yes, I am. He's thinking, don't what? I was scared to let you know too. I am too bold consenting adults. If it comes down to it, you know, it's just like the gays there, you know? As long as they're over 18 everything's fine. Yeah, yeah, Yup. Same thing. Yup. Exactly the same. I asked him, I asked him, you day, your mom, how do you like, that's such a, she just brings it up. When they were just one day who are talking and laughing and she was like, I asked him, what would you ever day your mom like? Yeah. Hello. How are you responsible as a parent, right? It's on her. It's on her. You're not supposed to, so you want to hear a distinctly Australian accent? Yeah. Let's figure the difference out between the Kiwi and the Australia.

Speaker 12:         00:35:00       Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, it was always in bed and we will have come and wake me up, not coming into letting me Jaxa. I'll say saying, I'll make running towards the light. He was up on the straight and then he come back towards the car and I said, Oh hey, what are you doing there? Am I doing there, Mike? You got to wait here. And he's like, Nah, Nah. Oh. I fell asleep behind the wheel and I'm like, what? What ride I ride, I,

Speaker 3:          00:35:25       he needs a perfect smile. A devil. He's missing some paper. I don't know where a perfect smiles are. I have a perfect smile on my travel case. I traveled with it so that if I ever need a smile on the road, thank God.

Speaker 12:         00:35:39       Definitely. Then he just decided to start walking up the street again and I said, what do you know, Mike? You got to wait to hear the cops in common and he's just started taking off. So I was reading, so I jumped in me little purple car and started chasing him up the street and then he went down a solid straight, told the cop as he went in the psyllid straight and I went and got him. This is awesome. No, it's just tasting me jokes.

Speaker 3:          00:35:59       Should I see the memory jogger and he's got four teeth? They know. Don't Australians just sound adorable no matter what they're saying. Yeah. Even chopper chopper. Joe died his pubes ginger JOPPA. I love it. Yeah, they do. They're, they're, they're, they're a fun group. Sweet. Right? Yeah. He just don't sound like dicks. I don't know how long you lived there. Six months there. I did road rules. There were saying you lived there and filmed for like almost three months, I think you lived there and nineties I know, but you lived as well. How does that make my point? Well, no, I mean it was an extended trip. I don't know if I would consider three months. You wouldn't say you lived there for three months. All right. Then I guess it's living, I mean I lived in Boston for a summer, I still say yeah, but I lived in a, I lived in youth hostels and a Winnebagos. Yeah. In the winter you were doing challenges. Shit man, you're wrestling crocs sitting on ice, just glass and you're just classical house. Glassing just glue.

Speaker 3:          00:36:57       I got a bad bite. I got a bad, this guy looks so happy, really happy. And you know these Australians, they always, they're always happy. I don't know. I've never seen a bummed out Australian and they were like that in the 90s everyone's super nice then it was a 90 thing. I don't know. I mean, look, I just know that I didn't meet a Root Ozzie when I was there. Really? No Americans are Douche bag. We're mean to foreigners especially, but there are so nice. I loved it there. Canadians. Australians. Yeah. K We. Oh, nice. They're all nicer than us. Most. Most other places. Would you say, oh, this is, this is New Zealand.

Speaker 3:          00:37:52       No, you're laughing at it because of this. Preventing trips around your home can be as easy as tidying up toys. The breathing is, they're obviously very close though. That's Kiwi. Kiwi. It's a bit of, yeah. Fruity fruity bars. Yeah. It's stronger and I feel like a struggle as a stronger accent he bought. Yes. It's a little more fairy cutie

Speaker 1:          00:38:20       energy bundles. Right? Snacks to keep the snakes and that's why I don't say x already. Buzz.

Speaker 3:          00:38:33       Oh my God. Do you know that I clean up the toys now a lot more because of that. Yeah. See if it worked then oh my God. No, I don't want to see it again. Fruity bars, snacks,

Just glass and just glass and glass and all of a sudden put my head on. I'm like, oh, we're just glassing. He's pick your two of those.

Speaker 3:          00:39:58       We know. I was wrong that this guy's Canadian. No. You thought it was going to. Of course. Yeah. No, he's from Colorado. I don't buy it. How do we have a Canadian living in Colorado? Dude, he has no Canadian accent it and looking for Moose. That's, I mean, there's nothing more Canadian than that. No, no, you don't know. It's um, it's really bad. How, how far off you are with that one? You don't know. I'm really, I'm really disappointed. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:27       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:40:33       First of all, yeah. I want to bring up something that I'm really thankful for. You know, we just celebrated thanksgiving, thanksgiving giving mate. That was a perfect English accent. Thank you. And we invited her friends over. Yeah, we did straight friends and straight friends and no good friends. Nobody. Non binaries. Yeah. And I'm saying, wait, you know, we didn't do anything we didn't want to do. So the point is, you and I made sweet love. Oh yeah. In our home for the first time here. And I wanted to thank you because you put on deodorant before we did it. That's really and showered and I thought, wow, what a special occasion. Yeah. Okay. So you did, you said that and I was like, what are you talking about? How you go whoa, deodorant. What's, what's going on? What's the, what's the big deal here? Why, why the deodorant?

Speaker 3:          00:41:30       Like I weren't you on an every day? No. Do you mean no? I mean what I mean is usually when you're asking for set Scx, I don't want to say the word STX you, you don't usually grow them up or do anything special for me. Right before sometimes you'll have flown across the country tape the night before you'll have a show and then you'll be like, can we do it? I was really impressed that you took the time to put on deodorant as well as shower prior to us doing it like right then. That was really cool for me. The most memorable moment was we did it Saturday and yeah, it was at the tail end of the Florida, Florida state kit and I turned it off, especially when as soon as I get over, like as soon as I rolled over I go because it was a game on that would to me it was like the special moment that you turn the game off.

Speaker 3:          00:42:34       I thought, I thought you just mute it while I thought I would mute it and just watch. But then you were like, I could tell you weren't into that. So I turned it off and you know, I tried to get through it as fast as I could for you. Um, and then yeah, for me. And then when I rolled back over on me like I wasn't game on and you were like, okay, I'm going to go to the shower for me now. I thought that by the way, that's a sign of a real marriage is when you get, you can do it and then your husband goes, can I put the gate back on? And you'll go, yeah, fine. It's fine. And there's no anger. Oh, right. It means you're in a good place and your mass truth because I know how important that game was to you.

Speaker 3:          00:43:12       There's Florida, Florida state, and we won the gator chomp killed the gators, the gay turds turds. Ah, that was really neat. And we've been playing this a little roleplay lately, which is fun. Well because we were making kissy faces the other day and in bed and you'd had a glass of wine. It was kind of like three quarters done was the side of the bed. When I went to kiss, you know, I was like, oh, I like this. This is like back in my, uh, bar. My bar in the days when I used to just kind of troll the bars and you go, oh my God, really? I go, yeah, you remind me of, uh, what's a good bar? Bar. Troll name Karen. Karen. Yeah. Total care. Then you're Karen and just make it the bar. I want to do a smoke a cigarette too as it, because when you have that on your map, then I know you're down a lose and smoke. I'm like, yeah, what's up? And Karen has really low standards. She's not used to being treated well. That's the thing. Karen's like, Whoa, you're kissing me. Usually I don't get math. Pat My head. And that's what's with all these sheets on your bed and Karen doesn't get mad when the guy flips the game on. Right. That's what she's cure. Karen's actually used to have the game on in the background as they're doing full volume. So Karen's thankful that you turn it off and that's why I let you go

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       back to you would've been what would've been cool. If you want to be like really cool. Why points we do it in the dog face, in the TV, all the Games on. That could be cool. This might be the guy that let me check. Uh, who's that? That's the guy in the house. Oh Shit. There's a dude in our house. Oh, there's so many dudes in our house. Always. What the deal is he is he calling? I Dunno. He just said I'm done. So I'll be asking me if I need to come over there and not asking me. No. Okay. We'll see what he says. Um, glass. But anyways, and then what I really liked. Yeah. So you have been taking, you've been smoking cigars lately. Outside. I've been enjoying getting back into cigars. I like them like, I don't know, 20 years ago and you were 10 and now I like them more than 20 years ago.

Speaker 2:          00:45:25       You're only 37. Yeah. So like a teenager, late teenage, what are you talking about? That's what I like. Cigars, Florida. That's when I got into cigars in high school. Yeah. Who the fuck? Smoke cigars and high school. That's how I got into him. I was doing two days. That's how it fucking calm down. Calm down. Yeah. That was a grown man already. That is silly. Yeah. So you came in after you smoke your cigar and I kissed you and I was like, well it looks like Karen found a match. Yeah. You're Bobby. Bobby. Bobby again. Cause I had cigar breath. Right. And Karen's got such low standards. A Bobby can walk around and the shorts. Yes. Unfortunately. Oh, for crying out loud. What's wrong with the heater? I Dunno. Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go out there. All right, pause, pause number two. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Oh, I got to stay with the dogs and back for interruptions. There you go. High traffic today in the Segura. Yeah, a lot going on.

Speaker 2:          00:46:27       Well, I got a little tree for you. You want to hear it? I got a little treat. No Robbie, here we go. Hey Buddy. That's top dog. Hey Buddy. Stop Dog. I was the Georgia. Oh God. Hey Buddy. Good job doc. Do you need to wipe down? Stop talk gave, uh, gave dad a call. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Pretty fantastic conversation. We haven't spoken with him in a while. Yeah, it's been a while. And I got lucky that, um, not only did I get to talk to top dog, I also got to talk a little bit too. Charro oh boy. So it was, uh, it was something, they're coming out pretty soon.

Speaker 13:         00:47:15       Hello? Hey Buddy. Hey, you're home. Yeah, I'm home and work every day. All Day. Some of them. Oh, it's great. What, how's it going? What are you doing watching Perry Mason with? Oh,

Speaker 14:         00:47:30       cool. Hey, did you tell me the other day that you had like a new fart smell?

Speaker 13:         00:47:38       I did. I did. I did. What, so what do you attribute that to? You know, I don't know. I don't know. I, I think maybe a combination of some different foods and things. Uh, but, you know, I, I kinda have my, my fart smells down to bed, eight or 10 basic smells. Yeah. And this was a new one and it, it, you know, cause it, and it was ugly, I have to tell you, but it wasn't so ugly, but it was just different. It, you know, it was almost like it was somebody else's heart. Were you surprised? I was surprised. I was totally surprised. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 14:         00:48:21       Yeah. And then, so what, what did it lead to though? I mean like, was it a, were you sick or

Speaker 13:         00:48:27       do you think now, now there wasn't, there wasn't any, any event. Usually, you know, if you have some need, it's a restaurant you've never eaten before. You go to somebody's house, you know, I have some greasy Italian food or something and yeah, I guess, yeah, but this was, this was, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:48:44       crazy Italian or something like that. Some guys in like Italian hates a time for this. The only person alive that hates Italian thing.

Speaker 13:         00:48:51       Hates means I really, you know, I tried, I went back and tried to remember what I ate and I can't put, but it was definitely different. You know, it was a real job, a real discovery.

Speaker 14:         00:49:01       That's really something, Huh?

Speaker 13:         00:49:04       It is. It is. You know, and I thought I was kind of past the point of new discoveries, you know, I'm 69 years old and kind of everything is pretty much routine. So Emma, there was a little bit of high excitement there that I may have opened up a new, a new vein and the old, you know, margin testing, I don't know.

Speaker 14:         00:49:22       Yeah. So, but you still, your movement afterwards, it was standard. It was normal.

Speaker 13:         00:49:27       Yeah. It was standard. Yeah, no, absolutely.

Speaker 14:         00:49:29       That's really something,

Speaker 13:         00:49:32       you know, you, you, you just came to Thanksgiving and of course that, that changes your, you know, you have a lot of things in quantity and stuff you don't normally have. So,

Speaker 14:         00:49:40       oh, this was, this was the thanksgiving.

Speaker 13:         00:49:43       No, it was a pre thanksgiving, but just coming through thanksgiving, you know, uh, you know, I should, uh, I'm back to doing, you know, I had basically a twos and three there ever since thanksgiving. Wow. That's good. Anyway, but I, I would just stop by that one. Smell. I've never,

Speaker 3:          00:50:03       two is a little hard. It's hard, but threes and fours are ideal. So if you haven't twos and threes, I would say fours and fives are ideal for me. No five's too sloppy. Threes and fours are the ideal. I don't think so. I think, no, it's not a matter of opinion of me. Look, the reason for is or where you want to be. Yeah. Yeah. I know this stuff. I go four or five. Don't go for a five. It's too sloppy. You

Speaker 2:          00:50:27       went threes and fours. I believe me, I've studied this stuff. I know the whole scale. When's your colonoscopy? It's next one. Hold on. You want a four and now you're right. Three or four. You want to four, right? That's what I just to three is kind of hard, a sausage shape with cracks in the surface. But that's all right. You want a smooth soft sausage or snake? Four. Four. Yeah. No, sorry, go ahead. Okay.

Speaker 13:         00:50:54       Smelled that smell before.

Speaker 14:         00:50:56       Yeah. I mean having a new, I kind of know what you mean. Um, one thing that was weird was I was on a flight last week and somebody kept farting and it was the same smells. I knew it was the same guy. It's far too. Yeah. And then about two hours into the flight I farted and my fart smelled like his fart. That was weird.

Speaker 13:         00:51:20       That was weird. Yeah. I couldn't be, I tell you, we are, we are. We get on like, like you're on a tram or something, you know, people, but sitting down so they stand up and I am the 80 do that a lot in Florida because you know, if it would cold weather climates and you have a party kind of get in a crowd, it kind of hides in your, your overcoat or jacket or wear everywhere and you know, it doesn't, but time it gets out, it's kind of diluted. But if you live in a hot weather climate like Florida or la and that summertime when you're Fart, it's out there. You know, there's, there's an escape hatch. Okay.

Speaker 14:         00:51:59       Oh yeah. And uh, you know,

Speaker 13:         00:52:02       yeah. So, uh, and then people, people, uh, you know, then they all look around, you know, there's like, you always know, the people that don't look around are the ones that did it.

Speaker 14:         00:52:15       Yeah. Interesting. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         00:52:19       I do it. I always look, I always look around with like this discussed of what the hell's going on.

Speaker 14:         00:52:25       Yeah. Kind of to kind of misguide them

Speaker 13:         00:52:29       all. The other times I went to this one

Speaker 2:          00:52:33       conversations with my dad, or like an eye, I'll reciprocate. I'll be like, oh, I'll say this back. And then he'll be like, so something else I did.

Speaker 13:         00:52:42       Yeah. And yeah, there was an older person in front of me, so they don't know. They're not aware if somebody is behind them, sometimes we're not aware of somebody in front of him. Okay. Yeah. And so they had no idea. And all of a sudden this not only hedge smell, but it had noise too. I have no idea. Somebody is them

Speaker 14:         00:53:01       and they find it a big one, Huh?

Speaker 13:         00:53:03       Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And, and then, and then when they step up to the counter and they realize you're behind, you're, they, they, they pretend they don't have any ownership of the problem. You don't. Right, right.

Speaker 2:          00:53:16       I remember one time I was, uh, I'll never forget, you know, just memories that just stick with you. I share an office with this guy also named Tom when I was working in DC. Columbia. Yeah. Uh, that was working at a America's most wanted, he was a producer and Onair guy. And I was just a researcher, so I was 20, um, and he, or maybe 21 and he was probably 40 at the time and we both like hip hop. So one time we just went to a record store, like during lunch break just to look at the records. And this guy, this was back when there was record stores everywhere and they had headphone stations. You remember that whenever it came to that. So you put headphones on and they would have like five or six things you could listen to at the time. Sure, sure.

Speaker 2:          00:54:02       So these are albums that are out. So this big guy is standing there with headphones on and he hits like, so obviously you can't hear what he's listening to, but he's singing the notes singing the song. He was like, and as he hits the high note, he rips a massive fart. Right. But it was so weird because he turned around and looked at us cause we were busting out laughing and it was all, he looked at us like, oh you laughing at my voice. I think he didn't know that he farted. Yeah. Because when you're wearing your ear buds, even in here, you don't hear your far. And I think because he was singing, yeah, he didn't actually realize that he pushed out a fart because I've had that happen before when I've been on treadmills where you're farting and you think it's silent and maybe it's not and everyone could hear it. Sure. That's a real common problem. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         00:54:52       Yeah. I know what you mean. Um, did don't tell mom about this new smell or no, no, no. This is where it gets good. She's in the other room. She's not into this. I haven't told her baptist. Is she around by any chance? Can of talk to her. You can talk to her. Hold on. Okay. Hold on. Let me bring up right away. I'm both of you then when you took this side. Yeah, it's good. It can wear on you sometimes. Um, what's up? Did you know that he had a new fart smell the other day? Yeah, he said after all these years he has about eight to 10 fart smells

Speaker 2:          00:55:37       so great. I'm so disappointed she disappointed at you or doesn't want to hear about it. Doesn't want to hear about it. Which Tom she referring to when you are, you're telling me it's telling me. I thought I heard I Tom, which made me laugh. I thought it was your dad. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         00:55:53       No, I did them come and you have a new, you should see how serious he you sending me. It is a my life. Okay. Person hated in my life. Who? The person I'm talking about this middle of the French and kicking him out is anyone can do

Speaker 15:         00:56:28       70 oh, by the way, I want to tell you in front of him. This is serious. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my God. It hurts to hear. Say, yeah, it's only wants to talk over you. I don't know. I want to talk to you. Oh, okay. Did they remember you? I don't want to talk about farts, but this is like, can you mag it smells. I mean definitely still. How does it know when to change your [inaudible] part? It will make so much. I didn't recognize the smell of yours. Let me see. When I farted. I do recognize this man. I know it's a new one,

Speaker 14:         00:57:07       but isn't that kind of amazing when you think about it

Speaker 15:         00:57:11       then tell me. I cannot believe that. I mean, I know if it, mine is metal doesn't smell as far as I know. But to recognize the smell of this heart. He says there's a new one.

Speaker 14:         00:57:20       He says he has eight to 10 different smells that he recognizes.

Speaker 15:         00:57:25       Yeah. I want to put you on a speaker. Yeah, hold on. Okay. Oh crap. Damn. Yeah. You said you have eight to 10 different yeah. Different snow in the kid from China. Okay. So I know by the way my car. Oh, what kind of taxes did you hear that? Yeah. Testing.

Speaker 14:         00:57:49       Well isn't it? He's, he's, it's kind of a, a nice, uh, a skill that he has that he knows what's coming.

Speaker 15:         00:57:54       I just needed to know about history. Know about the flowers. I know like the smell of the flower. Roseway Iranian. Oh, I know what butterflies coming by. The color of this. Tell me about the fight. What kind of, but dad can do. Dad knows the age that she's the one that skill that's for shoots, can God. Okay.

Speaker 14:         00:58:19       But he also wanted to give him discovered. I think that the real thing is it, not only does he have that skill after all these years, he was able to detect a new smell, which is really signal.

Speaker 15:         00:58:32       Yeah. That really was kind of like, ah, you know, it's like we ended a stronger word finding a new planet.

Speaker 14:         00:58:38       Yeah, that's really true. Yeah. It's like they, they find, they find new new solar systems and galaxies.

Speaker 15:         00:58:46       How long, how Lope Andrew did on your own that you're going to live at Gordon to their fights and this male [inaudible] that would be my goal and my, the meditation where we live, I might have went on to be a ration card. When you go to the bathroom, knowing what's coming to see, I'm retired, I paid, I know it's coming today and I am a lot of toilet paper. I need an extra role.

Speaker 14:         00:59:11       So is the main the main advantage to knowing what's coming? Just toilet paper usage?

Speaker 15:         00:59:17       Nope. Actually toilet paper. Then the real main advantage is you know how close you are and sometimes they come quicker than others. You know, they don't come quick,

Speaker 14:         00:59:27       so do certain fart smells, let you know you're going to have a really explosive, huge shit. Yes.

Speaker 15:         00:59:33       By I all. Absolutely. Yeah. That I tell you. I know because sometimes we're talking and then he runs out. I guess. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm good. He out. Say, ah. I knew that I thought was going to be a five, but it wasn't the biggest exploding. I said, don't please don't go the leaders

Speaker 14:         00:59:50       an eight and it goes all over them. Oh Wow. Well, I really clear. It's really, I don't think you do have that discussing as your fired because to call that really cool. I think that's awesome that he has that skill in a book. I don't, I don't know, like I'm not at dad's level, but I, I have some Cochise that yeah, they paint the ball and stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to teach my son. It's going to pass it down from generation to generation.

Speaker 15:         01:00:20       Absolutely. I'd be sure to be sure to be sure that your phone knows that he's getting mad. Never argue with any of this disgusting stuff. Okay? You should be hearing protection. Okaka don't forget to talk about God. I made it.

Speaker 14:         01:00:35       Okay? I gotta go. I love you guys. Okay?

Speaker 15:         01:00:38       Yeah, but you know what? I don't see. You said that you go, you talk about [inaudible]. Do I have you forgot to say I'm walking into a meeting.

Speaker 14:         01:00:46       Somebody here at the house. I have to go. That's the reason why I got to go. I said, if only for the person I, he did. Okay. I'm in another room. I love you guys. Okay? I love that. Okay. Bye. There you go.

Speaker 3:          01:00:56       Your mom does the same thing I do to you because you always go, I gotta go. I gotta let you go. Here you go. So rude. I gotta let you go. Yeah. That was probably one of the best calls and a long time. I laughed so hard, man. My stomach hurts from that call. I love how upset Charro gets. That's the best part is how upset she is and how disappointed she was when she found out what you guys were talking about. Oh yeah, and she's disappointed in you. I

Speaker 14:         01:01:23       she couldn't read. What was it here? I think it was here. Hi. Hi. He said, after all these years he has about eight to 10 fart smells and he had a new smell is, believe me, it's my favorite thing too. That's why I do this.

Speaker 3:          01:01:43       Disappointment is so profound in you, right then. Yes.

Speaker 14:         01:01:47       So fun. I'll both of you then when you took this, that's funny. She goes, how bored do you get? What you talking to your friend and you sometimes. What's up? Did you know that he had a new fart smell the other day? Yeah. He said after all these years he had eight to 10 fart smells. Any of that new smell. The smells.

Speaker 3:          01:02:18       She's so disappointed

Speaker 6:          01:02:20       in you right there. Yeah. I don't think I've ever heard her and usually she just gets angry. Yeah, but this was thorough disgust, contempt and obsessiveness at you and your dad. It's a very nuanced emotion for Charlie. This one's a little more than once. Usually she just goes to rage. Ah. So funny. I don't want to hear, oh, I thought it was your shit. Both from the streets. That's how I like my answers. It itch. And so that's when she's a bit Ghostface man. Yeah, she is. Yeah. You know what I thought was really neat, which you have been teaching. Our son is in the mornings. You and I, we get our coffee together and he'd go into his room and we wake him up or he's already up and we have like a family time and there's a, there's a, a rocking chair I sit in, I said was sitting there with Ellis and you are sitting on like a plastic chair, like a step, the step stool.

Speaker 6:          01:03:17       And you are in your dad boxers like you normally are with your, uh, your slippers and just a shirt and you're sitting on this plastic stool and your legs were spread open and the fabric was pulling against up against your nuts. Yeah. So we could see just a hint of balls to the side to side. Yeah. And you spread your legs, you lifted the legs in the air and then you farted. Yeah, it was like a snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, like firecrackers and the street. And it was cool that our son got to see that firsthand. Yeah, it was pretty cool. I agree. It was kind of like a that uh, what's that? Um, that, that great art that he had a kick ass ripper. It was sitting on a dresser. Right, right. His Dresser Fart. That's it. A getaway.

Speaker 3:          01:04:12       Yeah. Good one. That's a neat thing. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my God. That was so good. Now how does your dad was another clip from, uh, when I talked to my mom too. I have a question though. Earlier she was like, ask them, will you ever date your mom? I was like, yeah, mom, what do you would, would you do mom? Um, so how does your dad hold it? Does he hold in these as a, the men? No, no, no. So how does he fired around your mother who has honored contempt for them? He just does and he'll be like, baby, I go, it just came out. I got it. I got to go. She goes, well, go to the bathroom. And he's like, I don't want it to go to the bathroom. She was like, this is this. And then he'll get matches and stuff, you know?

Speaker 3:          01:04:53       And She just gets upset. She just yelled. But she loves it. Ha. Yeah. I have to say, I think one of the greatest things about our relationship is that we just fart in front of each other because could you imagine 2040 years of having to get up and go to the bathroom? We know people like that though. I know. But that's especially because your dad has a sickness. He has a diverticulitis. So those a rancid, it's medical. Have you smelled? Of course. I've known him for years. Of course. Bad. It's disgusting. It's really rancid. His farts are like just wallpaper peeling any crazy. So I wanted to play this for you. This woman, uh, Shah's Rad Morgan. She's an author of the book, the fuck list. A memoir about the two years after her divorce where she fucked a lot of dudes. Cool. Um, we always talk about this.

Speaker 3:          01:05:47       Yeah. Oh yeah. We're going to blow bang whenever after. Oh yeah. And by the way, yeah, you had a dream and then you tried to kind of like dismiss it later. You're like, ah, yeah, whatever was just dream where you said I watched you, right? No, the dream was you had an idea for a bit for your mom's house where I blow the entire cast of Juggalos. This is your dream. This isn't my dream. Yeah. And I, I went through with it. I did it. Reluctantly reluctant. No, I just did it. I didn't think. Yeah. And then afterwards I was talking to Bryce about it. Yeah. Brace was like, wow, you really blew all those guys. It was really crazy. And then I had second thoughts. I was like, oh, we can't air that. We can't air that. Right. And then I go, that's your concern.

Speaker 3:          01:06:37       And then I go, Tom, I blew all the guys in Gigolos. We can air this bit. This is going to, it's a ruin my reputation as a lady. Yeah. And that was it. Yeah. Look at him. And I liked it as you, your dream. Tell your shrink about that one. Let me know what she says. Who I roll. I mean, you're like, oh, I had this dream like, like somebody, it sounds like someone really twisted your arm. He's like, well I just did it. I blew these five guys. But I only remember blowing like, whoa. I only remember, I only remember one Peter. Really? Yeah, like in the dream. I didn't go one. You remember who was it was through the braces. The Jesus guy. No sprays. It was praise God. You blew brace in your dream. Right. But then I didn't, I just remember seeing the painter. I don't remember it like doing anything. And then I remember Bryce being like, wow. And then I asked to take the bed out.

Speaker 16:         01:07:29       The breeze philosophy, philosophy, philosophy, degrees, philosophy.

Speaker 3:          01:07:40       You blew them. Yeah. And your dream really cool babe. You got it.

Speaker 17:         01:07:47       Hi. I'm sure was at Morgan. I'm author of the fuck list. So this is a very unusual video. I have come all over my face, kind of. You can see it and thank you Brandon for leaving it there for me.

Speaker 3:          01:08:01       Bryce. Uh, it looks good. It looks like a nice lady. She did. Yeah, she did before she said that. Well, I don't know why you have to make a video of come on your face, Donny. Well she's going to tell you why we've all had come on our face.

Speaker 17:         01:08:16       The reason I'm showing this to you is because I want you guys to realize that come to me as a woman come just to be something really disgusting and gross and slimy and I would have never let a guy do that on my face. I concerted so disrespectful. I want to tell you how I came to see calm is not some Yucky slobby slimy stuff and make it something that turns me on and this is how I realize by talking to men, they associate the come with their pleasure with their orgasm. They will identify with it almost like a woman might identify with her. I don't know, with our hair, something about our bodies that we like.

Speaker 3:          01:09:02       She's a really weird accent and she's, is there some kind of expectation? Yeah, but so far I'm 100% on board with her. Do you agree with that? That is an extension absolutely. In guys do identify, identify it with their pleasure and everything. I think that's that part. And so the fact that it repulses me is that bad. Um, it's just, it's just reality. I just have to deal with it. I mean, I wish it wasn't like that, if that's what you're asking. I wish it were a candy flavored. Mine tastes pretty good as far as I remember. I had a couple of cups of it last week wasn't, it wasn't that bad

Speaker 17:         01:09:38       and not only up for a man has come is a very precious part of himself at all. He loves his comedy, still proud of it. She looks at it like it turns him on when he sees it coming out. He's proud of it because like he sees how much there is parked shoots. It's a measure of his manliness, you know, like there's so many things about it and when he could come on a woman, it makes him feel so close to her. He's giving her part of himself. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:10:12       This lady's a genius. Can I tell you something? Or eyes are really, everything's right. Can I tell you some? What's so great is when women get hosed into this horse shit, that guy's feel things about their calm and we need to be more respectful of letting guys come on. Gimme a break. Yeah. This one is a little bit about cell phones practices. I practiced as a white tigress for about a year. Then the oral sex tradition, there's a lot of things. For example, we have a technique, she talks weird. They both king deeply the penis and you're almost like gagging on it. And when I first heard about this technique and then solid, I was like saw my goodness. And it was like the instant thing that came up in me was that it's degrading to women or the technique where you're holding the back of the head and the man is holding her head and then circling has hips and holding.

Speaker 3:          01:11:04       How day this lady's cool is she needs a mill approval too much. What's going on? What is this? Why can't this get addressed? It seems like the eyes, oh, I got that. No, I'm not like that. What's going on? Their bags. She's old. Yeah. But I mean God damn, she should put come on those bags. What I'm saying, there's so much. So much bags and you've got all this access to all this come. Why don't you marrying the two? Right. If it's a skin tightener. Yeah, cause I think she'll get more calm, which she loves. She, if she takes care of those eyes, her teeth look good though. She don't tell us your teeth look good. She's an attractive woman. I know, but these are real bad. Real well I can't. Exactly, and she has come on her face. I keep forgetting that it's on the, I guess it's kind of dried. It's usually gets flaky, right? Yeah. Crusty

Speaker 17:         01:11:52       and it's a turn on. It's not disrespectful. Great teeth. You can see that like guys come on in your body or anything. Like if guys come on your face or in your body or anything like they just, they just will. It's just such a respectful, loving act to deal. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          01:12:12       No leverage. With riverbed, the guys, she's a sesame street character.

Speaker 17:         01:12:23       So after they come on my face, I like to rub it in and it makes really, really good. Facial skin is so smooth.

Speaker 3:          01:12:33       Yeah. God Damn Hoes job you're talking about and she's totally hosed this bride in more than one way.

Speaker 17:         01:12:40       The only thing is when I get into my eyes, it makes my eyes burn a little bit and no shit. I get in my eyes because I like to look at the men when they're coming. I like to look in their eyes and I like to see the come come out of their penis and Charles Murray on now. So I opened my eyes to look and then always, I always get some in my eyes, so I have to figure out how to get better at that.

Speaker 3:          01:13:03       Yeah, you got to get better at that needs really oversexed I think. I think this is too much of a focal point in her life. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that she's talking like a fucking teenager. She might have been really super repressed I think so. This is her reverse? I think so, yeah. Because usually when people lead with the sexuality card, it's their whole thing. I like to watch, come, come out on the come lady. I'm come face lady, come on my face. I rub it in. It's definitely, you're right, it's years of repression and now she's, she's the official. Come on my face lady. It's so funny. I love by the way, the thought always being that like, oh, you really gotta be so accepting of guys to get them to be indie. Like, no, you don't. You don't need them.

Speaker 3:          01:13:48       You don't need the guy to come on your face for someone to come. You know what I mean? Like dudes will come no matter what, dude, don't worry about it. Can we stop fucking worrying about their feelings about their fucking calm. You don't want to, we don't have to worry about guys know why. Who Cares? What do you mean? I'm just saying that they're not an underserved demographic. Sexually. Men historically. What do you mean? I mean, you guys are ruled the world this whole time. Who Cares? The way we have things we need to take care of baby. Okay guys do you're a holiday shopping using our Amazon banner.

Speaker 3:          01:15:06       Okay. Ready? Yeah. Can you please settle this debate once and for all? My wife and I argue all the time about wiping techniques and we are in need of a neutral third party to weigh in on the subject Grady. So I myself am a sane person and I wiped from front to back until the toilet paper more or less comes back white. She on the other hand, goes back to front wiping shit towards the clit. She justifies this aggressive, she justifies this by saying she has this claw technique where she essentially uses toilet paper as a make shift. Shitty finger condom scoops it out from inside the beholder, so make sure she gets it all. I agree her bunk hall is probably definitely a lot cleaner than mine, but what are you mommy's thinking? My crazy. It's real crazy. Sounds a really, really aggressive on a lot of levels.

Speaker 3:          01:16:02       Wiping back to front is never recommended. No for nobody in that. She claws at it and just, Oh man, wait. Let me just see though. I do see the point like she went like this with the paper in there that the problem is you aren't putting Cutco on your machine and that's not sanitary. You can also do the claw through a reverse claw. Do a claw front to pull out and use your thumb as the claw right away from there. No, you should definitely reverse your claw. You should get the toto. Yeah, get the total washlet three 50 on Amazon using our banner. It's really the best podcasts. Did you know that? That the button that turns it on. If you press it twice, that's how you get hard pressure. No, it's soft on off and then there's stop. So you do soft on the second time.

Speaker 3:          01:16:52       Makes it hard. You're fucking kidding. Cause I've just been increasing the pressure by pushing the button. Wow, that's amazing. So we are using the washlet from the nineties we got the total three 50 and love and you do the model number because the guy at the total store, I went to their showroom and he walked me through it and he goes oh you got to get the three 50 that's the latest model and get it on Amazon and it's pretty painless to hookup. You need to have an outlet by the toilet and the water sources there. This thing has a remote control, a heated seat. You just basically, it's like your old shit to shower thing. I mean I still like to do a cursory wipe wash. Let uh sure. I'll do like a wipe. Why and then I let it rip. Yeah. Why do you, why do you do that's what the wash led is for.

Speaker 3:          01:17:44       No, I still like to do one wipe cause if you have a like a lot of Kaka there, you don't have a big hairy asshole like me. So yeah, I'll do like a cursory why, but I just, I don't even look, I just wipe it, drop it and then I hit on and then I just let that stream go. I mean there's nothing on the paper afterwards. It's amazing. Have you used the dryer? Yeah. That's so nice. It's a nice, it's a hairdryer and your asshole. It's a hair like a full powered with art there is the front setting and then the rear settings. But as a woman I have to use the frontline so it pushes the Kaka away. Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah, I understand. You can't do the front to the back to front. We got a horrible are hilarious clip to watch. I haven't watched it. Do you want to weigh in? We'll see what you think.

Speaker 18:         01:18:34       What the fuck? Ah, ah, ah. My fucking nuts.

Not a whole fucking lot past the dope summer of 63 that's what I was thinking. Jesus. Yeah. He goes, did you hear that? I don't think it's funny.

Speaker 18:         01:19:18       Bummed out.

Speaker 3:          01:19:33       It's pretty funny. Well, I think it's a bummer that that's the guy that hits you. That fucking cunt. That Kippy asshole smoking dope. Yeah. All over my face. I have come all over my car and I really like it. It's an excellent skin softener show. Aw, I don't like it in my, Oh, he's at birds, boy. Super Dumb. Dumb. Do you see the Hungarian email? I did. That's funny. You notice that? Read it though. Okay. It says, dear main mommy, Tina and surfer of the water champ champ thrown Tom. You surfer. Yeah. Hmm. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:20:20       Inspired by your wonderful podcast. I pulled my jeans up high and tight and sent off for a DNA kit from 23 and me, I use the word I use, the code. Bird has fat jeans to pay an extra 20% to pay an extra 20 bucks, which goes towards Burt's liposuction surgery. I received the kit fluid bonded with a test tube and a few weeks later I received my results. The test identified several very close blood relatives. I didn't know I had you see my mom was adopted and found her bio mother several years ago, but she never found out the identity of her bio father threw some detective work and by comparing DNA results on another website called g d match. Um, they compare DNA from different testing companies. I discovered my mom's biological father. Hmm. His last name was Joe Hahn sick. Does that sound, how'd you say it? Oh No, you have to spell it. J. O. H. A. N C. I s. I k.

Speaker 3:          01:21:15       Yo hand shake at sound check. All right, well he was 100% cockroach DNA having Hungarian. That makes me 25% Hungarian. Excellent. We'll do. I know. How do I connect with my eastern bloc routes? Is there anything special about being Hungarian? Should I take this? Go dancing and start being rude to people. Should I plan a pilgrimage to Budapest? Yes. I'm really lost here. See you at the next family reunion. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:21:40       Andy p s my wife and I saw Tina and Houston a while back. Uh, we already have tickets to see the fake water champ time when he comes to town. Unbelievable.

Speaker 3:          01:21:49       And as you'd say in Hungarian. [inaudible] yeah, I think that's wonderful. I think you should go to Budapest. You said you should start eating sausage, drinking beer and abusing your body because you can cause you got cockroach eastern bloc DNA also, uh, work on your scowl, right Tom? Yeah. Work on your depressive illness. You're going to need it. Yup. No, it's nice. It's beautiful. Beautiful cursing. Get, get a good curse. Going. A disdain for humanity. You got to work on that a little bit. I think it's cool. You should go check it out. It's fun. Yeah. It's fun. How, how grumpy some of them are. I don't know if they are anymore, but you know, last time I went shoes, everybody in my family's grumpy, super grumpy stirs. That's fun. Good for you. So that's a, that's a pretty cool message. Very resilient jeans. Very resilient.

Speaker 2:          01:22:44       Well, someone else told me this. A Mommy's long time, long time. First Time I was listening to a podcast, three 71 when a listener wrote in saying their dad picks up an Asian accent. Whenever we're talking to an Asian person, this is my favorite thing. Well, this seems to be an epidemic as deeply ingrained and dads as dad mouth is. My father does the exact same thing from the unintentional horrifically racist accent to reverting back to a caveman sentence structure. However, my father's dad accident goes a little further. Not only does he do the accent of the person you're speaking with, but he is in contact with them. Over the course of maybe an hour, he starts to switch up accents, even throwing in words from different languages and it's, for example, after an entire meal of him talking to our waitress and a Sushi restaurant with an Asian data accent.

Speaker 2:          01:23:31       For some reason over the course of a few sentences, it morphed into a Hispanic accent, even ending the night with Eh, with him saying see and respond to the waitress question of whether or not he was finished with his plate. Oh my God. Oh my God. My father is neither Hispanic nor Asian and has not had any extended periods with anyone. Um, he would not have a familiar familiarity preference like a was suggested by the main mommy. I think this matter needs further investigation to get the source of data accents, keeping them high and tight Blake be wow. That is just remarkable. I mean, I have so many countless memories of my dad doing that. Juan Nieto, did you have, did you, would you able to buy some Nice space today? He's good. No. See why aren't you telling you like that, that, and maybe this weekend we, uh, should I show you some of the things in the church is nice here. You would like it and they were like, okay, boom, boom, boom. And it was like Jess, Jess, so ridiculous. Um, Miss. Say, uh, Oh yeah. Oh, by the way, do you remember the, um, master of accents last episode? Um, which clearly we, you know the fatty play? Yeah. No, the also the other guy. What was the, uh, um, the redneck. Oh, right. Yeah. From Louisiana. That's right. Somebody gave us a, someone to give us the old one too.

Speaker 19:         01:25:20       Golf. I'm, I ain't go with state prison here. Had a facial or bad at, I'm wondering how paring it back and forth out the failure

Speaker 2:          01:25:27       makes a lot of sense. We said he was hauling printers. It's hauling prisoners back and forth. Oh, Angola state prison. All right. That wouldn't make sense. Yeah. Instead of printers. Yeah.

Speaker 19:         01:25:41       Cringe. I had [inaudible] go [inaudible] have to look it in tanker and then thank you.

Speaker 2:          01:25:50       Thank run and thanking. Yeah, but now we know that, uh, there's no printers that they need and goal this state prison. What a dumb fucking, well, yeah. Listen in your defense as a master of accents, I think that

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       your batting average is pretty high. It's pretty, it's pretty easy. It's substantial. That one word off. I mean, you translated all that hillbilly. I know, I know you hear this dog. Of course. Of course I do.
