Speaker 1:          00:09:55       Thirsty. I'm the water champion. Don't bring it to your mom. So Christina. Okay, I got your own water. Hold on. I know you're reaching

Speaker 4:          00:10:55       or my water, but I brought you a more appropriate size water have for your water intake. You had to use both hands like Ellis does. Is that good? It's nice and warm. It's from the sink. It's tap water. Jesus, you jerk. You couldn't even give me regular water here up. I'll put the good stuff in there for it. Yeah. You kind of drank a lot of that. You must not have been drinking that much this morning. No, I'm uh, I'm drinking coffee right now. You know why? Because I'm super tired from drinking so much water. Sure. What color was your p this morning? You're finished your city. It was so clear that like trans, it was just transparent, whatever. You don't even know this yet. I haven't told you, but yeah, I installed this thing we got is called the the bowl glow. That's a stupid little device you put in the toilet and it lights up the water at night so you can see the toilet.

Speaker 4:          00:11:56       It can be any color. Red, blue, green. That's what that thing is. Yeah. So I was thinking how fun it would be if it's like, you know, if it's blue and then you make the water green with you, it's going to be like a dark green. No, no. With Neil stay blue. Yeah. It'll be like, oh, it's clear. It doesn't even turn into anything. I should have made it red. That's normally what you see today. This weekend with water. With fitness actually. Yeah. Yeah. Really? No Sir. I don't worry about it. Okay. Well I landed and Gosh, Ceville Nashville, Tennessee. Uh, I worked out every day. They're good for you Thursday? I did. Uh, what did I do? I did both. It was split day, so I did like cardio and weights. Friday only weights and Saturday cardio. Wow. I did it like two hours before my shows so I could work out.

Speaker 4:          00:12:47       Then you shower, you little something, go to the show and I just drank just ridiculous amounts of water. Plus it was hot as fuck. That'll make you drink a lot of water. It's true. I did. I drank a lot of water this week. Wow. Good for you. See that. That's like a notable thing for you because I drink water all the time and I got up every morning. I wake up at 5:00 AM before the kid wakes up and I hit the weights. Even see me down there in the garage because I heard you say massage for my 40th birthday, my BFF Shauna came and we went to Bark Williams. Happy Smurf Day. 21 years old. You went to Burke Williams did everything to do with that. She says, you know, thank you for my mom's side and they tag on my nails and my toes and they, they go, now you're gonna want to hydrate Africa toxin.

Speaker 4:          00:13:40       But the lady, when she whispered in my ear, her breath was really bad. I'm a serious. Did she go, he'll probably want to drink a little more cause I can tell you no, but then she goes, you're my favorite. No Shit. Then she kissed me on the floor. No, she did. They don't do that for you there. Yeah, but I thought I was their favorite. So she actually went, she went and her breasts dog so bad. I know. Don't whisper in my ear if you're breastfeeding, that's brutal. You know, I just did an Uber ride with a driver whose breath wafted over across, you know, the console is like Jesus, man. Get your entire life. Now this piece of shit video you made, I saw an Instagram or are you threatening me with, you're like, oh, I drank more than just a reminder that I'm the water champion.

Speaker 4:          00:14:31       I flew to Nashville sitting next to R and B legend Jill Scott, by the way. So my black celebrity status continues. Yeah, that's neat. I told her about it about that. That was like, when I hear my list, she goes, yes, we talked like most of the flight and she, she goes, yeah, I go, so I list her, but she of course, most impressed by Tyson. That is that. That's a good yet. I go, you're on the list now. And she was like, okay, now do you have a funny story with her? She was so lovely and just like just, she's a poet and a, you know, she just talks about being centered and balanced and happy and not needing everything to feel happy and like, wow, that's fair. Very fun call. She was very cool. No, you issued a little video statements saying that you drink more water.

Speaker 4:          00:15:19       I have a retort. I'd like to finally make an official retort. You've been a tag and make you this with you. Did you guys work on this together? It feels, I know, but I'm telling you that I am sick of the attacks on social media. And finally this video will prove who is the real water drinking champion. Just remember I, okay. Schnitzel. Cause she's saying she, she's a glass of water rights, which makes the most of the water. She's got her little, her little hamster feed her in her cage. I'm a little concerned about this. Should I set this up? This is going to definitively answer who's the more drinker of the waters in this house? Which one is it looks like there's two in here. Oh it says three 49 underscore video or three 48 underscore water underscore drinking. Uh, three 49. Yeah, three frame.

Speaker 4:          00:16:12       Okay. Just so you know. Okay. So we're doing this. Just see, should I set it up a little bit? Can you tell me, well Tom, I decided to surveil your actual water drinking habits. What? Yeah, I have footage from the last episode of Your Mom's house and let's see who really drank more water. Oh man, you're so dead. It was so dead with my weight. My response videos absolutely massacre you. Well, let's see who drank more water and the last episode of Your Mom's house. Kelly? Yes. What is she? Parking? Brake marking and our video. Okay. Hmm. How has music? Yeah. Okay. All right. Which mommy drinks more water? Has what? It says there is me. I got one so far drinking the first time. There's that one.

Speaker 7:          00:17:14       I got two, two times. I got three. Tom's one right now. Alright. He's got to, I can already tell you the floor and your video

Speaker 4:          00:17:27       got three. I've got four. Can I tell you the flaw in that? There's no fraud drinking so much more than you. You can tell. You can tell. You're really going to contest. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can tell like yours, just like, like, like you're just like a bitsy sit like and I'm like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Yeah. Whatever.

Speaker 7:          00:17:46       The record shop. I'm at five, five times drinking. You're only a three. You're four, six, four, seven. I'm at seven and we're still at four. Oh, I'm an eight. And you're still at four. I've with what you drank on the last episode. I drank doubling. It's an old song on the record

Speaker 4:          00:18:33       so that was blue man. Thank you man for making that second. I drink double what you drank on the last episode. Secondly, first of all, I mean people, I feel like they can see this and they can see them in the population. That was honest. I just asked him after the episode, why don't you put it together? But I had an empty like 16 ounce bottle and that you had a still like half full abi where you're like not well not sure cause I had to Amy on look at the backup water to go with my primary. There's overwhelming online support. I'm a lot of champion. Yes there is. I've been getting, a lot of people are just like I taught look at any posts down, Instagram, Twitter. They're like, clearly Tom's the water champ. Yeah, that is so false. If you look in my car, just go down to my car. There's empty water bottles, half bottles. I hydrate constantly. I just knocked down that sippy cup like it was nothing. That is nothing. It's a baby baby cat up dummy. That's so stupid and it's so wrong. You just got a water changes, got molded and your booty exploded. Here we go. Well where's your water for it today? It's here right now. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:19:50       Whenever that's the point. That's a sip for me. Well you're except for me is a fucking pint and the sip for you is like, like a little baby step or a bear. You are drink way more water. Five times my size and he'd drink five times less. You're hydrated. Inferior. Hydrated fairy. Yes. Your age to know. Wow. I'm age too. Oh Wow. Yeah. Wow. So I just want to make it clear that video is dog shit and you're the dog shit. You're the water winter in the same sense that if I were to play basketball with our son right now, I'd be like, you're the winner too. You know, I just put it in the basket mad because I burned you so good. It's so, so offensive. Moded and your booty exploded all over this water place. Okay, we'll see. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       we'll do a live contest coming up. Legit. It's already been done. Legit. You want to talk about what happened? A burns fat. We can go there. What did, what did you want to talk about though? Nashville.

Speaker 4:          00:21:01       Oh, right. So you, you've met several celebrities in your life. You've met your, your Jill Scott. Yup. And that was awesome. You sat next to her and then you met another

Speaker 3:          00:21:11       celebrity. By the way, a bunch of the titans came out and Tennessee titans, football players, a current and former really nice guys, um, hung out with them. So shout out to the titans. Um, yeah, so you're never going to believe this will you will now. But I think a lot of our audience will be blown away by this. Um, throat Zilla came to a show Saturday. It was unexpected. I, I've seen her posts and things like, when are you doing a show here? And I've just, you know, never, it never occurred to me that, that she wouldn't, I saw a couple of posts that she said, I'm coming to Nashville, but you never, you know, people post things on your wall and you're like, okay. Yeah. Um, she bought a ticket. She showed up and uh, she wore a shirt that said throat Zilla on it and then Google me. I'm so hoping somebody there, it was like, I wonder what that means is it picks up their phone like Google. Whoa.

Speaker 4:          00:22:14       Yeah. She DMD me on Twitter. Like I'm going to see your man wants his shirt size and yes. And then he's, she's like, there's too many people in line. Oh, really? You meet your husband? I was like, what? Wait though. The woman who sucks Dick's professionally is like, it's too hard to see.

Speaker 3:          00:22:29       That's fine. Maybe you shouldn't be damning. The wife I bought that throws with that. How, how uh, pure her intention. No, I know. I believe that. Yeah. But the funniest thing was that Friday I'm out with my friend Mike and his wife and I'd only briefly met his wife. So now we're having dinner after the show. And I actually, since I'm just getting to know her, I go, how'd you guys meet? And as she's telling me, and that's usually a story that you're paying attention. You're pretty engaged. My phone's lighting up and it's you. Yeah. So I just go like, you know, he's kind of look real quick and it says, are you and your friends getting blown by throat Zillow right now? And so I gotta I gotta I gotta answer this right? Yeah. So I tie it back to you like, of course.

Speaker 3:          00:23:13       Yeah. Yeah. We're all, we're all doing that. Whatever. No, and then she's continued with the story and then the phone lights up again and it's, it's, it's you. Yeah. And I keep going, so I have to go. I'm sorry too. I'm not trying to be rude here. Um, but I think I got to call my wife. She's like, she goes, no, of course it's your wife, like color. She has no idea what we talk about. So I tried to call you, but of course we have no reception here. Yeah. So I have to keep texting you. And then when I finally feel like, cause don't, you know, with texts, she actually had a good suggestion. She's like, I go, I can't tell what she's joking. You know sometimes when we joke she goes, you're going to have like an Emoji that's code for a joke. I'm like, that's a, that's a serious or not serious. If I use emojis generally and the text exchange it means I'm no, but what if you had one that meant this is, but just so you know, generally if I'm using emojis it means I'm not really mad. True. So here is, here's the exchange. I go, no, she's not. There you go. Oh good. I'm so happy. My, the blowjob lady is BFFs with my husband. So I'm like pay.

Speaker 3:          00:24:23       Yeah. Hopefully she'll be getting ready for Josh with me. And then you go, how did this come about that she was making the trip to see a nice trip to man. I told this to Josh. I've never seen him laugh so hard. You Go, great. So can I become friends with the pussy eating machine guy? And I go, we are not friends. And then you did put a bunch of emojis in eye rolling and one of the family Emoji. Yeah. Like remember your family, please remember your family and your two dogs. Emoticons for dogs and for our child together. And you go, please don't ruin our lives.

Speaker 3:          00:25:11       Like Babe, you're killing me. And then you sent me a picture of you and our son. Well the best part was this, that whole exchange then led to, I'm really likes this guy. Know that whole exchange then led to me coming back to the table and of course everything all right. And I go, Oh yeah, you know, my wife was just joking but I didn't know. She was like, oh she's, she makes a suggestion. I go, yeah, this is this whole throat Zillow thing. Like I'm sorry. So then I'm laying out the details of who throws Zilla is and I can see her face is like, that's cool. And I'm like realizing that our level of appropriate honor talk normal's a little skewed. Yeah. Especially for first time didn't like normal people. The Blow Job Queen, you know. So anyways, they were, they were very nice people, but I think I was horrified her, but oh and throw Sheila was very nice. Yeah, I know. I know. She has. How I finally got you to calm down. I was like, baby, calm down. I go telling, you know you go, come on man. I go, well first of all I'm going to have $400 on me. And you're like, oh, okay. I'm like, he could have led with that that I don't have hundreds of dollars, hundreds of dollars to spend on blowjobs. Gosh, no, I did have my fingers crossed for Josh to, I'll be honest with you. I actually did as well. So what did she

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       need Josh to or know what is is separation of church and state. She was out for a night of just comedy and having gray. She was off. She was off the clock, so to speak. This was when she met him and she was like, oh, hi, nice to meet you. Like she was just nice and sweet lady. Very nice. And it's what an exciting thing. Josh was kind of excited. He was like, hello. He knew it was Josh, by the way. He's the one who introduced the whole story. He started this again at Virginia Beach with, I told her, I go, Josh is the one maybe maybe reward them, you know? And she was like, she just said goodbye and left. But she sounded sweet actually. She was very nice. Yeah. I saw the picture of you two together and somebody saw the back of her head picture somebody, somebody goes, uh, did you give her, did she give you the throat?

Speaker 5:          00:27:34       And she posted, oh, I could never do that. I love his wife. Aw, that's sweet. You're BFFs with throat. We, we DM each other. It's really gave me your shirt size. Yeah. I was supposed to get my own church. Said I should tell her your size. So anyways. Well good. I'm glad to hear that your marriage is, your valves are solo taxonomy are still intact. Yeah. Maybe we'll get Josh potter a Bj. That's the goal. That's the goal. Yeah. What do you think it would take? I mean it probably would take those hundreds and hundreds of dollars. My whole thing is how disposable is your income? I mean if I was making five, $10 million a year, think that's well worth the entertainment. Sure is, hey, here's whatever your fee is please. And then do we make them snap chat it to you? Uh, you know, do we make it public or I wonder if he would sign up for that. That's what I'm saying. Like you can't just get something for nothing. Josh, if we get this for you, you need to, well as long as they give us a play by play afterwards of how should we do a Kickstarter for Josh? He did say though, he goes, cause we've seen some of her online footage and it's with let's just say large individuals. He goes, what would she do with me? Just kind of leaned forward and it would all be gone.

Speaker 5:          00:28:54       Oh I told her, I asked her to do that for that video. I go, so then can you go pop, pop, pop. And she goes, that's not what it sounds like. She did her own, she was like, she did it. There was all kinds of people in the room and they were like, wow, that sounds way more authentic than Tom's version. She's a professional experienced. Yeah. That's professional. Baghdad professional man. So big, big celebrity week for you. Big Celebrity Week. Um, Jill Scott and throwed Zillow. So hilarious. So Smash Ceville. Yup. And give us an IBS update. Did you really? Interesting. You know what's so interesting to sometimes you have explosive diarrhea, like I do a couple of times a and you'll go, oh it's, you know what I just ate. Must cause it. And you go that's too rich or something. And then just kind of not on your mind the next day

Speaker 6:          00:29:55       have a cheeseburger

Speaker 5:          00:29:57       and later you have a totally normal bowel movement. Oh it is. I be like Joe, that is IBS. Yeah. I mean that's from what I have. Why would that be IBM? Because it is random. It could be like a spasmatic a bowel thing. So it is kind of arbitrary so that that could be part of it. I don't know. Okay. What was the one going to a specialist? Yeah. When are you, when is that appointment is coming up? Let's put that on the calendar. What? What does blue band laughing? I don't know. I think he's just laughing that I have an appointment.

The 30th I am keeping kind of a food diary so that you can tell the doctor after I eat certain this and that. It's a good idea. I think that's what they're going to make you do. Right.

I was in a brown spot in the cracker, you know, so this was the Yak stall. So that was kind of it. It ended up being kind of a nostalgic moment, if you know what I mean. You know, you get emotional about it, you know. Well, you know, I mean get emotional, but you know, I, I, this is one of the challenges that you face in life and you have to, you know, I mean, I actually thought about adding to go home, but I got it out and made my flight and you know, got engine the new place.

Speaker 3:          00:42:20       Right. So where were you flying to? Do you remember?

Speaker 16:         00:42:24       Well, uh, I was flying to, I think I was trying to Arizona, so I was just like,

Speaker 3:          00:42:33       oh wow. So you cross country with Dukie on your pants. That's not too, yeah, yeah, Yup, Yup, Yup, Yup. Um, wow. That's pretty, that's pretty neat. It'd be Kinda cool if you also were to go to the same gas station in Miami that you pulled over for your biggest shit ever. Do you remember that one?

Speaker 16:         00:42:50       You know, at that place she still existed today. It would be a nurse. I know. Really. You know that, that we're talking by Miami's damage, you know, say kind of place where, you know, on the side you had transmissions. I just discarded on the side. Oh

Speaker 3:          00:43:10       Wow. Do you remember, did you finish that shit? Did you tell him I'm about it at all or no? Cause it was so epic?

Speaker 16:         00:43:17       Probably. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:43:19       Do you think she probably enjoyed that or no? Definitely not. Definitely not. Um, you know, I was the one that we've been getting a lot, a lot of people emailing us about double pipe classics, you know?

Speaker 16:         00:43:34       Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They were, you know, they're very rare. Yeah. When I had my last one, you know, you, you can go a whole year or two without even have her.

Speaker 3:          00:43:51       Yeah. I mean, Christina had her first one this year, I think the first one in ages and I haven't had one this year.

Speaker 16:         00:44:02       I haven't handled it this year either.

Speaker 3:          00:44:04       Yeah. That's the thing is, and people are keep trying to, they keep trying to manufacture them and I tried to encourage them. You

Speaker 16:         00:44:13       can't, you can't do it. Yeah. Yeah. Just one of those things. Yeah. You know, it's one of those things you just, you got to let it happen. Right. Like you can't make it rain, you know, there's certain thing. Right. Right. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I remember the last time, time

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       it rain. That's true. Yeah. I mean, cause then people will be like, Hey, um, I sneezed and fired at the same time. Does that count? And I'm like, no, of course not. No.

Speaker 16:         00:44:43       The GG to do that. Exactly. You know, it's not special, you know, and uh, and still not won yet. Sorry to the shame. So I know that, you know, in this round you just want to be judged. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you gotta think about music though.

Speaker 3:          00:45:04       The reason it's so rare too is that you got air coming out of both ends. You know, usually, usually it takes a, it picks a road, you know, it doesn't actually go down both.

Speaker 16:         00:45:13       Oh yeah, that's right. You know, I was like getting punched in the gut and it goes both ways. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:45:19       Yeah. It's really, it's really something. So

Speaker 16:         00:45:22       I don't remember the last time I had one of those, you know, I haven't had one that I would really remember it. I'm pretty good about my classic moments about, can't take it this way. Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:45:33       Just shows you that you as the master an even you don't even recall your lap. I remember having one, I believe. I mean, we can probably find it in our show a year ago and it's, you know, for me, probably maybe the third or fourth ever. Very rare. They're so rare and um, yeah, every time though, it's a really special moment. A lot of people have let us know about their first time and they're like, oh, it happened to me today is really spectacular.

Speaker 16:         00:46:02       Well, yeah, as Yogi Berra used, just say, you know, there's only one the first time. The first time.

Speaker 3:          00:46:08       Right, right, right. That's true. Um, so have your, um, you know, I'm going to go see a specialist actually because I have so many catastrophic shits that I'm actually going to go check my guts out.

Speaker 16:         00:46:23       Really?

Speaker 3:          00:46:23       Yeah. I mean, I don't know that I have anything medical for sure, but, um, I just figured, you know, I could just check it out, see if any maybe food allergies.

Speaker 16:         00:46:34       It'd be my career all over again. I'd really want to be a gastroenterologist.

Speaker 3:          00:46:39       Oh yeah. You were made for it.

Speaker 16:         00:46:42       Yes. If fascinates me, Ron insider and the guts. Yeah. Well, you know, I checked her Nana, I got, I'm trying to say I took an antibiotic and as an antibiotic I've never taken before. Well, I had the hardest shift gears. Okay. Really? I May, we're talking, we're talking one GS and twosies. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:47:05       How long ago was this?

Speaker 16:         00:47:08       Just two weeks ago.

Speaker 3:          00:47:09       Oh really? Cause I remember, was it last year when you had the real hard shifts and we talked about hydrating.

Speaker 16:         00:47:16       Yeah. But this is really due to the antibiotic. So I loaded up on metamucil and the center, so that makes a difference. Once I quit, I quit the antibiotic. I knew I was out of the Claire and I had my normal smarts smell a certain right. You know, I know. Smells a certain way. Yeah. Oh yeah. And, and that was like the ghost state know. And sure enough later that day back to normal. Wow. What a neat story. Yeah, yeah, yeah. She had a price. They little with that bacteria in your gut. All right. That's what they do. They acknowledge Shoba your germs for you or what's wrong with you. But they also getting a gut and, and uh, oh, I have to tell you this. Okay. I was having lunch with a doctor. It was like 85 and I don't know if you've ever heard what's called C diff.

Speaker 16:         00:48:10       It's a bacterial infection that is really a result of taking too many antibiotics. Okay. Very common in nursing homes. And today was people just take too many antibiotics. You going to get to get all right. Well you know a lot of people they say take probiotics and all this stuff, but the, what they really need to do is introduce a shit back into your gut. In the old days they used to give you shit animals. They would give you an animal of somebody else's shit into your gut in order to reintroduce. That's very, what about just doing, I never, well you know I, I'm sure that somebody might want to do that for fem or I was just fascinated by it. Yeah. That is interesting to do that or no, no, I never knew that until here earlier this year when I was having lunch with this doctorate. Wow. Shit. Anima. What's the C diff? Yeah. Wait, spell it. D. I. F. F. C. Oh by the way, speaking of shirts. How about your bedspread? Th is everything cool with that now?

What do you think? Stay up all night. Yeah. For me, I go to bed at like four 30 every night that you're gone. I'm like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I just ate. Well, we had in the snack drawers.

Speaker 4:          00:55:02       No meals. No. I think we put a little order in your life, but when you leave I fly off the rails too, you know, not behaviorally. I just get really like I don't know what to do right now. I just feel like you're, you're my, you're my left side. You're at my other pair of, we share a pair of jeans. It's like how I do not go to bed when you're gone. I don't split. You have to wake up with Lj. I mean it's better now, but when he before him, Oh, you never did completely. I was like, it's 5:00 AM I should really just turn it in. She'll like that. What were you doing? Watching TV? Watching movies and just like forcing, like feeling tired, like fight through it.

Speaker 4:          00:55:45       Right. I remember those days before I kid. When you get to stay up all night and then just sleep next day. I know to stay in bed. Tozer over, go to brunch. Yeah. It's not going to happen for a minute son. Now I fly off the rails too. I just, I don't know what to do with myself, you know, cause you're the left leg and my jeans and when you're not here, I'm like, I don't know. I do. I had to hopping around on one leg, you know, it feels sucks. I feel as jeans, mummy your mind. This is how I feel when, uh, when you're not around.

Speaker 17:         00:56:26       I called up inside her, I called.

Speaker 11:         00:56:34       I'm excited. He's so happy that I'm done.

Speaker 17:         00:56:50       No,

Speaker 3:          00:57:00       no. American announcer does anything even close to that. I know. Basically Dick Vitale probably would be the guy, right? That is, does he do, what's his sound? He just really, he is so high energy did he talks himself out of breath and he's, yeah, baby. It's always baby, but he's like screaming it. He gets really hype about it. So people that that are, you know, he definitely adds enthusiasm, but it could definitely wear you out. Um, it's a, it's a lot. It's definitely a lot. Um, wow. This is a, that's Italian, right? Yeah. This is, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is this deadly for sure. Um, I can't even imagine getting this excited about soccer. Well, just, yeah, I like enthusiastic announcers, but it's just crazy to, to be like that, right? Like, yes, cause night for American football. I'll give you a, with what he's said,

Speaker 11:         00:58:07       another guy in ESPN now to dig by cow clearly gets carried away with his word God is going to be, that's fine. Yeah. That's still within reason. Now. It's within reason.

Speaker 3:          00:58:43       Are you serious, baby?

Speaker 11:         00:58:44       Awesome baby.

Speaker 3:          00:58:50       He's, he's, you know, he's exciting. Americans are very contained though. This says a Dick Vitale. It goes crazy here.

Speaker 11:         00:58:57       Haley newspapers that cover this program. Why weird here? He, that's good.

Speaker 5:          00:59:32       That's not no worries.

Speaker 11:         00:59:33       Italian Europeans really loved their soccer. They go really nuts. Everyone does. Arabs love it. The a rams. The Latins nameless.

Speaker 5:          00:59:58       Well anyways, so that was exciting. Got It. Yeah, he was fine. You got it.

Speaker 6:          01:00:03       Yeah. Awesome baby. That's him. Yeah. Um,

Speaker 5:          01:00:09       this guy though, cause there's also the, uh, the Spanish goal guy. I liked that guy. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but every guy has got to find their hook. These announcers. Right. You gotta Find Your special book. Yeah. Yours would be far, far, far, far, far, far apart, baby. That's not what I would do.

Speaker 6:          01:00:32       Um, let's see. Uh, let's see. The Spanish.

Speaker 5:          01:00:36       You don't fart into the mic anymore. Like he used to. I did. Used to do that. Actually. I did it in a really, in a classic jeans episode cause we used to have handheld mics back in silver lake. It's not like we're normal. That one. I wanted to have one point. Oh my God. I wanted to have one get picked up on the audio. I can't believe you. Let me just describe, Oh my God, I'm a throw up faith. That's awesome. Oh, so fucking terrible. It. What does this smelly, I'm going to throw up. Oh, Mike, I'm going to throw up. I'm going to throw up. It smells like yoga. Like those Japanese dumplings we had baby. That's Rad. Oh, oh. Oh, I like that you, you went like, this is what marriage is. You're pushing it away with, oh my God. Did you shit today.

Speaker 5:          01:01:29       That's so you. And I was like, who? Savannah. And they're like, she's one of the cohosts. Oh my gosh. I could go to a separate room. Oh my God. Yeah. I go into a separate room and I, uh, he said it's me in the scroll in the scrolls are fucking absolute moron. Please try to ignore it. That's the best part was he will keep playing it. But that's the clip. That's not the whole thing. No, I know, but that's the clip. I have it. But that was a horrible, and then what happened was Burt, you and I were podcasting, you farted and then Bert kept telling the stupid Savannah story and I was like, are you not going to address? Which just happened? Yeah, because we were in burgs man cave where you can taste it. It's like coming into my mouth. We were in his man cave in, you're fart. Just, yeah. It was a black cloud in that room and I had

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       to get out there like she's one of the cohosts and so I go on my separate, oh my God. I go into a separate room. That one I remember the smell of. That's funny you bring this up because I remember that smell. I had to leave the room. I walked out of that podcast, remember? Oh yeah, I believe that was one of those. You were like, because you smelled it. Unreal. Your farts. I had a fart this morning when I was opening the dog crates and you are my God. You didn't even acknowledge it. I remember it was so long and loud. It was good. You didn't acknowledge it though. I was trying to sleep, I was trying to sleep, but I acknowledge it. Can you do that now for me? Can you give me what I deserve?

Speaker 4:          01:03:15       Pretty Great. Appreciate you really dropped some weight on me. It just keeps telling the Savannah story why he chose, he chose to ignore you like a toddler. Like Ah, I just ignore that bad behavior. Unreal. Have you had any good public farts lately? I think good public parks it on the plane Lailey far whenever you played. I know you'd see I, he's still, you know, and sometimes I lift up the best kind is when you um, when you're trying to disguise it, you know, like you need to lift up. We don't want to go so, so I'll be like, I'll be like, I'll look in the seat back pocket part there, act like the straps are kind of fucked up. Oh God. As I put it back together, you know, that's interesting. I just usually have a blanket over my lap so I just, and shop that way and I feel like that kid who cross your legs pull the leg up.

Speaker 4:          01:04:28       But I usually lean against the window. I thought naturally up though, right? I thought it would be the input higher flight here next to me, the guy, it's a morning flight early morning. That's first people are, it's not just far be, it's also body fluid city. Like it's everything. So the guy next to me, every five minutes for a four hour flight went like clearing his sinuses and then behind the guy went and I was like, wow. I just kept hearing you being like fucking disgusting. Well don't get on the plane aids monkey if you're going to spread it like that. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with y'all? I mean don't, don't spread your disease peg. I agree. I agree. That's sucking in the snot thing really

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       gets me. Yeah. I that is my absolute least favorite. I just hate human beings on airplanes and everything. Everyone does annoys the shit out of me. No, I know. Hate everybody. It's been really nice not traveling as much with the baby jeans. I, you know, I think it took that to, to make me slow down. Yeah. I am so much happier now that I don't deal with humanity coming up this week. Oh Jeez. Fart sparks Capone early flight. It's going to hurt your stomach big time. Now did you fart next to Jill Scott? No. No. He had some respect for that shit on that flight though, which I hated. Really? Shitting on planes. It's the worst yet I had to now have you chose God doesn't like salmon. I'm sorry, what? Jill? Scott doesn't like salmon. I don't think he said that word right. I don't know what you're talking to Salomon. Yeah. She wasn't like it. I discovered that. It's interesting was it was kind of how the conversation started and actually why you're ordering lunch. Yeah. And they said, um, would you like something or salad with Salomon? Well, Hannah, and she was like, ah. Right.

Speaker 5:          01:06:30       And then it started, we just started talking. Well, I wouldn't eat plain airplane Salmon Saulman to save my duck. Right. It's disgusting. What airline was this? A Delta? Yeah. Even they have g decent meals. I wouldn't touch it. What? I was encouraging her to go to a French restaurant and get traditional salmon French made where, I'm sorry, French Solomon Solomon. They have, you know, basically it's rich. Medium rare, but yes, you know, they'll take you in the spoon on the piping hot butter and drizzle it so you have an outside that's kind of lightly fried basically with butter. But I would be careful with the rare Saulman because you had that in Vegas and it made you really ill. But I don't think it was rare Salomon as much as I just got, I mean, I don't get rare Salomon. Yeah, just medium rare I think is the best way to have.

Speaker 5:          01:07:23       I don't like that. I get scared. I get really nervous. So it's too raw salmon. Yeah, because you don't, it's not Sushi grade, it's just some pieces. Wellman. I wouldn't do that. That's just, you know, Fridays. Fridays I'm saying though, but if you go to like a high end place where it's quality stuff, I do it that way. Yeah, sure. Okay. Difference between you and me. Different strokes for the same folks. Everyone's the same. I got another voicemail from the Persian lady. You did. We should play that. So it's just, it just never ends. Just essentially the Salamay continues. That's a, let's say this is the latest Salah, my voicemail
