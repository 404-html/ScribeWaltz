One of the things I think we haven't even mentioned gene, these episodes are happening, um, at a pace that is different than normal because of this movie schedule. So like right now when you're hearing this episode, I'm shooting my dps, my boy girls, my boy, girl, boy girl scene. This is like call my scenes. We record, we recorded this probably three weeks or so before you heard it. I know. We usually do it in real time. Like we do it right before two days before it comes out a day. Just say fresh. Cause we're kind of a current event show. We like to be up on what's happening in the world. That's right gene. And um, yeah. So it is one of the things it's sort of a pain about right now, but all we're doing it, we're doing it, we're trying, we're trying, we're trying to make it work. We want to keep doing our show.

Speaker 3:          00:02:18       shut up CX. Okay. You don't want to say that I look and salary Todd. Okay. We taught is, is you okay from seeing other people are retarded.

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:02:30       Well, you see other people are retarded. It means that your mom actually give birth to the wrong baby because you don't ever have to rise to judge people when your Dick is not even as this thing. You can't even, you can't even like have a proper Dick and you say that I look like a retard.

Speaker 1:          00:02:48       I don't know. I don't think she looks that way at all. I don't know what's, and I don't know if it doesn't look that, I don't even know what the insult is that she's saying about the Dick. No, I want her to know,

So it's actually double a pretty great insult. It's saying go fuck your mom and when whatever noise she's making you told her to shut the fuck up and take it. She's ruthless man. She's great. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:03:31       I really like your rights to say I'm retired because your mom didn't give birth to have shit hole like you acid. Oh yeah, girl.

Speaker 1:          00:03:39       Good for you. She's fired up. I liked the heat. Yeah. I like her fire. She was very fired. If we trained women to be more like her, I feel like the world would be a better place. Like to stand up for yourself and not take any shit. Be a lot. I think that's good. It'd be so retarded. Yeah. A lot. A lot less Harvey Weinstein action happening in the world. You know what I mean? Striking back. You think you think he could take advantage of her? I think she's, um, she's, she's calling the shots today. She really is. She's a fucking animal. I like her. Yeah. You get a sense her rage if he's really upset. I felt like that's what the Internet's for a lot of people at functions as a place to just let your rage out. Yeah. I have a feeling she's been called that a few times though because the r word. Yeah. Whew. I don't even want to say it, but the r word, uh, you think she's been called? I don't think she seems that way, but you know, hey, yeah. Potato Patato very hurtful word, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:04:38       and do I have a giant?

Speaker 1:          00:04:40       It is so you shouldn't say it. Yup. Yeah. Goodness. I mean, you know, she's, she's maybe not as sensitive to the word as we are because she's of a different culture. So we're going to be a little forgiving here. Yeah, you can let her say what she said. That's her opinion. But yeah, it's uh, here in the United States, sensitive. I don't know where she's from, but here in the United States, um, you can't, you can't talk like,

Speaker 3:          00:05:13       do you want to fuck with my mind?

Speaker 1:          00:05:15       Similar. Yeah. Similar. Sorry. Similar. Similar. I think she's might be tie. You think so ty? What? No, no, like that, that a little, I hear that. Okay. Well you're the master of accents. You tell us. I Dunno. Actually. I know where she's from, Cambodia. So I need to polish up on some of my Asian dialects. Can we please talk about our show now? Uh, yeah, we can talk about our show now. Um, a lot of good stuff happening. Where is it? I had it here for right.

Speaker 4:          00:05:44       Oh yeah. Ah, oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:05:54       um, so that's our, a reality show Stinger that we hadn't been a long time ago, but we haven't dove into delved into a reality show in a while and we've been watching more scripted stuff, which is, you know, good quality. Tell you why. I'm a huge fan of the reality genre. I love it. I feel as though you've got me into shows. I used to never watch a lot of those, but if they're not making them as real as they used to, there's so fabricated now, but this one's a hundred. It's a documentary type style. Well, yeah, it's a series. I mean it has a run. It's on, it's on Netflix here in the u s uh, I say that because we have a worldwide audience. Uh, oh boy. Uh, anyways, the show his age gap love, right. They just got glove and we talked about it last week, but my goodness, I thought it was a one off cause that's kind of how it was presented.

Speaker 1:          00:06:50       This is just tackling one subject and then I hit more episodes and there's a whole season. I'm so obsessed. I know I haven't seen you this joyful since you got into your narcos a Telanovela. I think the reason that I'm so obsessed is this. The show is permission for me to bring up my worst personality traits. My most critical mean, mean spirited, but funny and fun personality traits because I, the whole time I just shake my head, I'm like, Ugh, this is disgusting. They're so gross. All the old people are gross. Makeup's all fucked up on the teeth are all young people are gross. The whole thing is just gross. And I have so much fun just hating them the whole time. Oh, I think that's going to be a guest. One second. All right. Um, our guest is here. He is, uh, fueling up with caffeine.

Speaker 1:          00:07:42       Said he refused to come on unless he had coffee. I was like, all right. Yeah. It was very, very demanding. So we uh, you know, we, we cater to our guests, so, but yeah, so age gap. Um, yeah. I love, I don't know. I you're right. I haven't had, cause sometimes when a reality show, uh, we get into, you know, it's usually like kind of background music if you don't have to focus on the grounds of sunset. It's kind of the, what did that below deck, the yacht thing. It's like I can miss an episode and I'm like, oh that's, yeah, that's the guy. That's cool. It's, yeah, it's like candy, you just kind of cat. But this one, I am so into studying and I also love making a list as it goes on of WHO's grocer? Like who like to fuck less. See.

Speaker 1:          00:08:30       And the thing is with us as a couple, everyone's like, you guys love each other so much. There's so much love. And, and I'm like, you know, a lot of our relationship, we're United by stuff we hate. Yeah. It's actually our ability to sit down and watch a show like that and criticized the shit out of people. We don't even know they were really bonds us ruthlessly do it. And uh, with no heart and just, it's really, if someone were listening be like, you're a real asshole man because we're doing, it's such a mean way, but it's, it's, it's just you and I like no one's really getting hurt. I would like to do, if we could through licensed, I don't know how that would work is due like alive streaming of us know how we could do it or watching the shots or we could do it.

Speaker 1:          00:09:13       We just say this podcast is going to accompany episode two of age. Got Love. And then you press play on it here and we have a different feed and then you just talk as you do it. Yeah. Can we do it in bed though? I want to be able to lay it. Just bring a zoom recorder up there. What I was, I mean, well my favorite was so the new champion of gross next, cause every episode you introduce new older people who were like, that person is disgusting. So there's a guy now who is like the champ of gross and which one you feel it cause we had no, he had the really long white hair and he's got, he used to be a minister. He's so nasty. And his, his uh, so age, they're, this age gap is 40 plus years or something. And she's like pretty nice looking.

Speaker 1:          00:10:01       Gow Normal. Yeah. And she's like, yeah, they start talking about the makeover that he's, you go, oh, she's going to give him a makeover. And he's like, no, no, no. This is him. Postmates. So he's got his long, white people had it. And you're like, what? And she starts talking about when I met him, his breath was really sour or what, and she goes, his teeth. I asked him when the last time he went to the dentist and he said 20 some years. And she goes, so she goes, you could really smell his breath strongly. And she goes, now, you know he's had his teeth white and you're like whitened. Those motherfuckers are grains. They went from green to yellow and she's like, and his breath is like passable now and you're like, oh my God. I mean so, so gnarly. And this poor girl is, she's like fucking 30 or something and they have five kids running around the house.

Speaker 1:          00:10:50       I just loved, you know what it is. I think it's why everybody likes those shows. You just end up feeling better about yourself and the decisions you've made and where you're at or you get to look into somebody else's home. Well, I was wondering, the breath alone is such a deterrent for me and somebody's mouth being that jacked up. Like what? What did she like about him? I'm not sure. I don't know. That's the problem with these. I think it was just, you know what? I think it was because they met in church, I think it was, there was some type of power dynamic. She saw that he was the minister, so she sees him in front of the church. He's the, he's not, he's a father figure. Literally two people, not, you know, in life. In other words, he's giving them guidance and advice. Yes. She was attracted to that paternal energy and he told, you know, he would give the sermon every week and this and that. And then, but then she's like, but physically he was repulsive. And you're like, what? How are you banging this guy? I Dunno. It's, it's astounding. It's really crazy. Jesus. My, my least favorite actually

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       is the Florida, the acting couple or the guys like 60 and she's 22 and she was homeschooled and she grew up in a religious upbringing. So she's totally socially are worded. Yeah. One might say and he's like not, he's not bad looking objectively for an older gentleman, but he's such a, that I look and saw we had, okay. Yeah. He, he's such a Boner, a dad Boehner, like his jokes are like loves and the size of a small child. And I, I'm like, Oh my God, your personality so unbearable. You are right. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:31       About this. This is my, one of my favorite people in the thing is that that guy I thought was less physically gross, but he is creepier. Creep factor is a creep factor because there's something, he's disguising it with that. Aw shucks.

Speaker 5:          00:12:46       Yes. It's phony. Yeah. And it's a, it's yes. Because you know, you know, he's preying upon this. She is now 22 they met when she was like fucking 18 yeah. And you know, and he's like, Aww shucks, there's some bullshit there. So that's scarier for that guy. He's really taken advantage of her naivete. Definitely. Yeah. It's not fair. They, you know what it is too. I almost, I have more respect for the trophy wife and the older gentlemen couple. Yeah. Just because there's an even exchange of power. There's an even exchange. It's right. Good looks and getting laid for money. Yeah. Older guy, younger woman. But she's hot. He's the got the money. So there's an exchange, there's a contract. But when the balance is totally not fair, where it's like she's, you know, 17 when we met homeschool, totally naive. You know, you know the world, Bro.

Speaker 5:          00:13:39       You know what, you're fucking dealing. Right, right, right, right. Any aid that wealthy, you know what I'm saying? Like she's doing her own dishes and shit. Yeah, they gon, they're gonna fucking Chili's for dinner. I would like that camera to, they were rolling that house. Ooh. I know that one's the one for a couple of years. When she finally wise up, she'll wise up at some point. Yeah, it's, it's unequal. What about the older lady who her 28 year old booboo is doing her toenails filing her nails and her feet and they're rotten. They're rotten and crusted there likes to give me a panic. She's a, they're American, right?

Speaker 1:          00:14:16       She's, she is a troll. She's hideous and something's really fucked up with that guy. Yeah. He's weird too. He's on some type of spectrum because he doesn't, it's not, the eyes are not registering regular emotions and he's looking at, I saw her and we kissed and we kissed and she keeps me, she's like, oh, she, she's dude. He's touched too, so she's taken advantage of some nice looking touched guy. You know what I'm saying? He's touched. He's really tough. Definitely our word it. Yeah. And she's taking advantage of this headache. Hearing those horrendous fucking on hurt.

Speaker 6:          00:14:52       It's just gross. What are you going to give me a pedicure? If they looked on shut up, I wouldn't let go near anything like that. I can't even reach my toes anymore. When are you going to start doing it? I mean, I would do that for you, but you don't. But here's the truth. You don't look like that. And that's why I would do that for you. Thank you. If you look like her, I just filed papers, so just serve you. Hey, so disgusting. She is disgusting. It is fucked up too as a spouse where you just let yourself go. It's not fair. It's not fair to do to some money. [inaudible] all. Alright, let's get our guests. Okay. Keep you one second. Let me bring our guest in and a very excited. Oh, all right. We're back. We're back. Um, yeah. We were talking about our son's name, Ellis. Uh, it is true that we saw the movie month after Doc Ellis.

Speaker 6:          00:15:46       We both have immigrant. I know. It's a good one. We both have immigrant parents as you do. So then people were like, oh, Ellis island. That's where we're like, yeah, that's the last thing I would have thought. So I'm like, Eh, but actually that's the one I have to bring up. Whenever somebody goes, what's his name all I have to go like, you know, like Ellis Island. They're like, yeah. I'm like, okay, that's just like the island. That's a great name. He's a great kid. Well with us is at the fantastic Tom Rowe international comedic superstar. Tom Rhodes, who's not a stranger to your mom's house. It's been a long time in Redondo. We has a long time, man. We had such a good time. I thought, wow, I'm going to be a regular on this show. We stopped doing guest guest for two years. Okay. No guess.

Speaker 6:          00:16:35       And we did the Culligan Man. He goes, I got Lincoln man cause I had fans. Have you got the part of your podcasts that came to my shows and said, hey, can we get rid of silly? But you tour where you were like a world renowned comedian. You're at, like, you really do your road dog to the Max. Like people are like, Oh yeah, I'd do the road. I'm like, you don't do the rogue like Tom Rhodes the road. You really, you've done it. You've done it. Comedy fucking everywhere, man. Yeah. Well I, you know, I, um, I've been doing the international circuits for 20 years and you know, I had, uh, I had that Sitcom many years ago in NBC and when the Shit come finished, I had a lot of money and I had played everywhere in the United States and I looked at my money is like kind of my NBC artist grant.

Speaker 6:          00:17:26       And I started taking trips to London and invested in myself, slept on a friend's couch and uh, actually the movie phantom thread. Yeah. Everything I liked the best about that movie is it takes place on Fitzroy Square. And I, my friend rich hall, um, he lived on Fitzroy Square and he gave me a key to his apartment. So that's where I would stay when I would go to London. And it's like a short walk to the London comedy store. And so there's some thread, so you know, people know that's PT, Anderson's new movie, Pt Anderson, Paul Thomas Anderson. I love Paul Thomas Jenner's. Oh my God, he's so amazing. I haven't seen it, but he's such an amazing, I bombed in front of him like a month ago, so I really cool guy. It's you and it's a, it's a great film, but I love the fact that it takes place on Fitzroy Square, but you've also, you've done, I mean London, but you've done all over the South Pacific.

Speaker 6:          00:18:25       But what I was going to say was London was the key to the international circuits for me. I got him with London and then that led to gigs around Europe and Asia and Australia because I want to know if this happens to you when you step into a whole other country. In other words, whether it's a European country, Asia, I'm going to do you have first show anxiety of like, is this going to work for me? That's kind of the drug, that's the fuel. Is this, this fear of Oh shit, this might not work well and what is going to work? And then the fact that you have to think so quickly on your feet, like, um, people don't read those references and going to work. Yeah. You know how like when you're locked and loaded in your brain and you're telling a story and you're like, how you say brain is thinking, okay, I'm going to go into this little section.

Speaker 6:          00:19:10       Yeah, I'm going to talk about this next. And then you get this little panic fear of, oh my God, is that, that's what you're addicted to. In a way. It is actually so funny. Yeah. Like it's really cool. Like when I'll do, uh, you know, I didn't live anywhere for 10 years. I put everything into storage and like, uh, the last time I did your show, I wasn't living anywhere. No, that's right. And, and it was really cool. So I would do three or four months a year in Europe and then a month in Asia and Australia, six months all over the states. Um, but like when you got like a week in Ireland booked and a week in England and then a week in Holland, it's like, it's different. See like, oh, okay, wow, Ireland was great and you know, I really got the hang of it by the end of the week and Irish audiences are the best.

Speaker 6:          00:19:56       And then you go to England and you're like, it's completely different. Really. Yeah. I would try to use this. I was just down for it. Irish audiences, uh, Irish, you can tell it, you can see it in their comedians. It, there's a storytelling tradition. Yeah. Yeah. So they really love stories. Yeah. And then you go to England and they, they like self deprecation. Right? Uh, you know, you don't see, I've never see like a real arrogant Jimmy Carr, but you never see like jacked up arrogant English committee. They're always a blessing on themselves. Seen as like an American quality. The, yeah, the bravado and the like. And then I saved the day is an American thing and like the British sentiment would be like, and then I fucked up the day for everybody. Yeah, yeah, exactly. I remember I did the Edinburgh Festival in 2014 and this, this wrote this review of me and she said, don't we all wish we could be as confident as the Americans?

Speaker 6:          00:20:54       And it's like, it's so stupid. Like, um, I've had up ups and downs in my life, you know, and uh, I, you guys know me personally and my, my, My, my dad and my sister died and I, I went into the emotionally I was in the toilet, I was heartbroken over losing these people that I loved. And it took me a while to build back my confidence and then here's this woman going, oh, it's this American quality. No, it's, we're each individually fighting our own fight in life and you know, things happen and you've got to constantly be coming back from the brink. Whatever you are, you are

Speaker 1:          00:21:35       do not like about the festivals and the overseas, um, comedy scene. Like the one thing I do not like the idea of reviews all the time. I really don't because you don't have any exposure to it when you're kind of us based. Like you do shows everywhere. No one ever does a fucking like, you know what I mean? Once in a blue moon, maybe some city beat blog will be like, I went to their show and they kind of do. But like when you start doing some of these festivals and you see all out, um, I think it's just such a departure from what I'm used to. I was never a fan of that. Even if it's like a nice review, you still like, I don't know, it just feels like you shouldn't be doing a writeup.

Speaker 6:          00:22:14       Yeah. Who are they qualified? What is your qualification? Just some funding, you know, it's gotten even worse because like in Edinburgh, the newspapers in England used to pay for these reviewers to go up there and most all of those newspapers cut there. Oh sure. Budgets. So they ended up your guide to budget with a website viewing things and you're like, Nah, I like, there's like college kids writing.

Speaker 1:          00:22:42       It was like what are, yeah. Who are you? I've seen some of those by the way, that are absurd for a cause. The one place you do see the review here? State side is colleges. I've done colleges and the reviews, it's not even that they're, they're critical. It's so bad. Just such a terrible writing because it's just like a freshman, uh, you know, journalists. It'll be like, I went to see Tom Segura at our, uh, student performing arts center. He opened with a joke about how cold it was here. The joke went like this. I thought it was very funny. He next tackled these topics, some of them like, and it's very just, you know, stating a fact, stating a fact, stating the line, stating review. And it's like you're putting that out into the Internet, uh, memory bank. It's just, it's, it's terrible. Gave away your joke. Of course you gave away the joke and he would do like, quote, like long things and you're like, yeah, just, uh, yeah, there's, uh, English. Uh, I hate

Speaker 6:          00:23:46       to bring it up. This website is it comedy website? Uh, and they wrote some thing about a joke that I did about, not a joke. It's a story that happened to me. And, uh, it's, uh, it's a joke on my new album. And, uh, my wife Ashton and I were talking about the, the me too movement. We did a, uh, an episode for my podcast and talking about experiences, and I talked about this comedian who, uh, had tricked me into going back to his apartment when I was very young man. And a, and then this comedy website in England wrote this salacious story. I mean, they wasn't, wasn't salacious. The headline was Tom Rhodes accuses such and such comedian of sexual assault. And then they quoted my joke and they quoted us talking about it on the podcast. And one of the things that bothered me the most, well, I mean, you know, they're trying to get clickbait.

Speaker 6:          00:24:47       Yeah. I didn't accuse the guy of sexual assault. I tell the story of the creepy older famous man yeah. Who, you know, tried to trick me and got me back to his apartment and manhandled me. Yeah. But he didn't punch me. He didn't penetrate me. Yeah. Uh, it wasn't, you know, and I think that sexual assault is such a serious issue in the, in the world right now. Yeah. How dare this, this site is kind of trying to get yeah. Trivializing the, the, the movements. Yeah. And uh, and then also they gave away my story punch like, oh Geez, that's the worst though. It was rolling on many levels.

Speaker 1:          00:25:29       Qualifies anybody to be a critic. I mean, even if you look at a Cisco and, and fuck bird or what are their names? Yeah, he's dead. They're dead. They're both, yeah. Apparently they both hated each other too. So these are two men who were full of hate, I'm assuming to either a failed artist or whatever. And one of them made like, it's one of those celebrated awful movies Ebird like a rotten tomato, like valley of the dolls to or something. So like, so you're a field filmmaker yourself and that qualifies you to criticize other people. How I know like it's just, I don't know. I hate people that criticize already. Like what are you talking about? That's why I roll my eyes at every top 10 list. Ah, like as if anyone in your life, everybody can write a top 10 list and technically everyone's right because it's your fucking top 10 list. But the idea that we would make one person's top 10 lists as credible, whether it's movies, music, books, comedy, it's like, why? Why is your top 10 lists of value? You're just, you don't even do it. You don't do the thing that you're saying you have the authority on. Like you're not a musician, right? Don't write music. If Bill Burr, what a print out like, hey, top 10 specials,

Speaker 6:          00:26:44       I'd be like, all right, that's fucking bill Burke. Let's listen to that guy's opinion on, you know, comedy. It's absurd. But uh huh. I know it's silly. Fucking listen to these Jack Offs. There's a lot of good movies that they got terrible scores on you and I want, we don't, we totally discredit when you're going through the iTunes or something. Like I don't even listen to that guy. Let's see if it's good. I mean, the only ones that are pretty much they're spot on is if it has single digit approval. If it's like 8% of people liked this movie here, like it might be dog shit. If it's 35% it could be a decent movie. Some people, you know, just didn't resonate with that and their sensibilities. Or you look at the Oscars and you're like, is America really watching these movies that the academy has a big heart on fire.

Speaker 6:          00:27:31       They made this big push now, but now every category has like 10 nominees. It's a too many nominees. Madness. You've got too many people up for, I watch shape of water last night. How was it? You know what I can see, I think that's the, I mean, I really want to get out to win, but I can see why shape of water did, did win because, and I, at the very end of the movie, I go, ah, I get it. It was a love story. I mean, it's a woman in a fish and they're fun. You remember splash, we all loved splash, right? You know, it's, uh, and so I thought, yeah, well get out was a horror movie and horror movies never win. My wife loves three billboards, which is about hate and people dealing with hate, which really speaks to, you know, where the world is today.

Speaker 6:          00:28:28       There's so much hate and all these lovely it out. Dude. It's such, I, I, I'm, I don't know I could, I could step into a class about that. I think so too. I think I saw a fascination of one because the guy invented his own genre, which hasn't been done since Quintin Tarantino in 1992 with reservoir dogs. That was like such a, Oh wow. It's kind of, it's mine. He'd wanted his own genre. So for that alone, hearing him talk about like, I love Jordan, Bill Peele saying that he started and stopped writing this movie like 20 times and thinking that people wouldn't like this, maybe never get made. And Amsterdam, uh, Jordan Peele was in boom, Chicago, this, um, Improv theater in Amsterdam. And uh, I had a late night talk show on the Dutch television and I would stop by there. Uh, there was a bar out front, it was in my neighborhood and he was the guy that I would talk to.

Speaker 6:          00:29:35       I would pop in there and, uh, he was a sweetheart of a guy. And, uh, I, I, you know, I very lovable, wonderful guy. And, uh, it's funny, like when you know somebody and they, they knock it out of the park, you know, like guy watched your special, I've felt the same way. Oh, thanks man. Yeah. Um, it's, it's like a good feeling when you see people totally knock it out of the park. You didn't mention him. I did love jury special as well, but what was the I, it's, um, was that a year ago? Oh my God. I haven't had one in many years this October. Was it October? It's a while ago now.

Speaker 5:          00:30:19       It's October 27 incidents. It was a really, okay, go ahead. Go ahead. No, but here's the thing. I'll say this before. Uh, that thing about, that's fine. It's fine. The thing about that, your specialty is great. Now I'm going to feel bad about me over this time. The mom or something? It's a cold. Oh my God, you guys, uh, her special now it's called mother and it, which is the best title mother. I'm just kidding.

Speaker 1:          00:30:49       But one thing I love, the thing I love about, I'm so disappointed in so many movies, you know, I mean, you go into movie, you want, you want it to be surprised. Do you want to have things happen that really you didn't expect? And so many movies when you press play, it's a blueprint that they're following. You go like, this is this scene. I know what the next thing does that sets up that this is that relationship. Here's the conflict, here's the resolution. Yeah, I saw the movie the whole time. The thing I love about get out is just, just so many layers and so many elements of surprise. Like you're, you're constantly like, Holy Shit, this means that and this, you know, like you're the fact that, that you could watch a movie and be surprised so many times captivated by the story. That's what to me was like the most amazing thing about that.

Speaker 6:          00:31:36       Totally. Like when the woman's hitting the tea cup and he's fallen down the hole

Speaker 1:          00:31:41       metaphor of the sunken place and you know, institutional race. It's just an incredible, if you haven't seen get out at this point, uh, it's, you know, it's really, it's an amazing movie that people so sorry to people have emailed that a few weeks ago. They were blown away by your chicken noises that you do a really good chicken noise. Um, I guess you did one on the show and I'm so used to your checking calling that it didn't really stand out, but hey, your chicken.

Speaker 5:          00:32:07       Well, I mean it's in my special time and you know, I am not going to watch any more movies until I go watch your special I guess.

Speaker 6:          00:32:15       Got It. I'm going to write the most loving review where it is ever been written.

Speaker 5:          00:32:20       It's the craziest, most unique, odd, I mean I like your hat people do things here that you don't ever see any place else.

Speaker 6:          00:32:30       One competition that people flock to for locals really needs no introduction.

Speaker 5:          00:32:37       Wow. Because it's not hard to hear. This

Speaker 5:          00:32:43       is the national cluck off where people from all over the United States come and sweet to see if we can mimic a chicken the best. Um, that's great. You know, uh, I'm from Oviedo, Florida and then, oh, veto is famous for, uh, the Oviedo chickens really walk around on the little downtown area. Where is, oh, veto. It's uh, the panhandle area. No, no, no, no, no. It's um, east of Orlando About, oh, I mean it was a charming go beach kind of towards cocoa. Okay. Uh, it was a charming little citrus village when I grew up there. And now they built a circular highway around Orlando and it is a highway exit. Now there's a chili's and a target and all that, but there's still a little downtown area and there's a Popeye's fried chicken, which is funny because these chickens walk around in the parking lot.

Speaker 5:          00:33:33       Oh God. And that's the one thing my little town was known for was the, as the chickens. Chickens. Wow. Two, um, tied us all together. I mean, people are asking, can we make, are in for it? They want to, they can. Christina. No, I can't do the call. The rooster call, but that's a specific time. But you do, you have done some impressive animal noises. I think you did. He'd goat. Is it sheep goat? Yeah. Let, we'll start with the chicken. Okay. That's all right. Yeah. Yeah. The pressure's on now, but this is when the winter step up. I listen to my face. I can't laugh though. I can't laugh.

Speaker 7:          00:34:17       Well,

Speaker 5:          00:34:19       that was great. Really Great. Yeah. Hey, hey. That was really good. Yeah. Thanks guys. That was, what do I win? You could kind of have, you could compete. Really great checking. I don't think. What kind of animal sounds can you guys do? I don't know. That was really good

Speaker 8:          00:34:40       per day.

Speaker 5:          00:34:42       That is is not you. That was me. I just did it. Ah, I come on. What animal sounds like he's stuck at your Chin like that too. I'm not, I don't do the a master of accents, but I'm asked from animals. Yeah. They weren't know if you can beat this guy. One man entered the cluck the gun and didn't lay in it because he took home his 12th. That's right. 12 national cluck off title. Oh, it's like music. We say you have an ear for it. I have an ear for animal sounds. Any barnyard animal I can pretty much mimic. Wow. Where was that? I don't know. I wish it were in la. Yeah. The craziest, most unique chicken show. God, I mean, I don't know where that this is. It's been an old age question. What came first? The chicken or the egg? Kind of boring intro. I mean drawing here my goat.

Speaker 6:          00:35:38       I do. Okay. Ready? There's also a visual way, right? Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:35:41       Ah,

Speaker 6:          00:35:45       I was really good. That was really good. So you do have a skill for this. People were right. They spotted it correctly. You're really good. Terrible reality shows. And I can make animal noises. That's all I got. That's what I got. What's your talent? What's your odd talent? Oh Wow. Can you wiggle your ears? Double jointed. Can you flip your eyelids? I wow. I haven't. You pick your nose with your tongue. When you travel. You traveled Europe so much. Did you ever meet this guy? There's nipples are disturbing this video. That's Europe. You've traveled to Europe a lot in Europe. That's how they are, right, Jeremy? I don't know. You spent more time there than me. Those are so thick. Right?

Speaker 6:          00:36:57       That is so bizarre. Yeah. What about the offer from that gentleman in his apartment? Should we play that? Should we have roads? Necess which offer though? I'll try. Oh. Oh yeah. You want to go all classic on them. It's like it's been a while since you've been in your mom's house. You should know what we're talking about. Okay. Yeah. I don't know if you're down with this or if you want. Oh yeah, cause you always, you said that. Well now you have a place to live, but if you ever travel again and you need a place to live

Speaker 5:          00:37:28       black, God's love to fuck and fuck good. Yes. You're a hot black guy. You want to fuck me at 2195 if you want to move in, you can move in, but you got to fuck the, I have any, I need to be fucked a lot, man. You can rent free food, free rent and everything else, man. He has a GL man. Men from jail, homeless or um, your thug median income. Then Franklin boot cheer, man. If Vicky would have at least you got up,

Speaker 6:          00:37:58       it's a bad angle to be lying down when you're like, when you're looking for like a sexual made partner, there's a whole lot of wrong. Right. You don't want, you don't want that dumper in angle. You're the first guy to mention his position. You should be setting up definitely a little more lighting. Better lighting. Cover up those under eye circles. Yup. Foundation a little something. But anyways, free rent if you're ever in, I don't know, I forget what city, but I'll find out the great thing about, I'm not living anywhere for 10 years and then get everything out of storage. Um, my apartment looks like a national geographic gift shop. Oh, does it? Really? Yeah. And then I, uh, I, you know, I was blown away to fight. I didn't know your mother was from Peru and if you come to my, my apartment, I've got Peruvian blankets that you love.

Speaker 6:          00:38:51       Peru. Peru is my favorite place I have ever been in my life and my all time favorite souvenir. I ever bought anywhere in the world and I've been doing a joke about it is, um, my handcrafted Peruvian chess set and it is, uh, the Incas versus the Spanish conquistadores. Yeah. Well we know who won that one. Well, and I suck at chess whenever I play, I'm the INCAS. When I get slaughtered, it's historically accurate. Hilarious. Uh, but uh, but yeah, I, when I lived in Amsterdam, I had a late night talk show for two years and then the same network, let me be a presenter on a travel show for a year and I got to film a highlight on Peru. So I didn't go to the Amazon north part, but I went almost everywhere else. I travel what was there for like almost two weeks. And, uh, it was one of the greatest experiences of my life. Did you do eyeliner? I did not. Uh, you know, when you're filming a television show, they don't encourage this or Anthony Bordain or something, then it would be all about, I've never taken my wife there.

Speaker 6:          00:39:59       And you let this man and pregnant you were not taking you to the motherland. I gotcha. There. I, she's nervous about it. She read something about Shining Path. I'm like, damn, that's gone. Let's expand. That's the terrorist organization. I was there when they were setting off bombs like living in, I was spending my summers in Peru and you would hear like, oh my law and see like buildings shake. Wow. Windows shatter. And the next morning I would call my parents, you know, in the u s and I'd be like, yeah, they, you know, shiny path set off a 2000 pound bomb let yesterday. And they're like, yeah, so, uh, everything else good buddy. I'm like, Jesus, you're not nervous at all. They're like, no, we're not. We went to Machu Picchu when we left the road outside of Machu Picchu, some like kind of country road people. They had a, there was some protest of some kind going on and they had rolled massive boulders off of the mountains into the road.

Speaker 6:          00:41:06       They would block the, that was apparently way of protesting and Peru have not know though. That's some like really rural shit though. Yeah. Yeah. We've got no other way to voice our displeasure. Of course somebody get up there with a, now they got, I mean that, that, that organization's long gone man. I know, I know. I do. My Elk Guzman as the leader of the Shining Path. He's in prison for life. He's there on an island prison, like their Alcatraz, uh, I want to go back and spend more time in Cusco. Gray was the, uh, was the Rome of the Inca empire and there's this famous Cusco. Can I ramble about this? Yeah. There's this famous 12 sided stone. The ink is, did not use mortar. There's, and this stone is like 10 tons and it's as 12 sided stone and it's in this foundation, uh, a wall. And uh, the, the metaphor is that no stone is too irregular not to fit in place somewhere.

Speaker 6:          00:42:08       That was the way that they, that's the way that they did their masonry. I love that. That when you're in much appease, when you see these, you know, 15 foot, 5,000 pound stones and they're laying flush with another stone and all they can do is hypothesize about like, there is there, like they're like, we would today in 2018 we would use tractors and bulldozers and you know, equipment. And they're like, we have just theories. We don't know how the fuck they built this and how things, it's crazy he moved in late like that. And some people think aliens might have that. Maybe they just don't know. It's, it's, it's really, it's so impossible. And they're like, you know, they had thousands of people, but we still don't know how they would make it look. And I mean, they made buildings out of rocks. It's crazy. [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:42:57       PG, uh, the way the did like home dwellings or are laid out that, uh, there's still running water that runs through them, which is amazing. And they took you to the sacrificial Chandler. They used to just slaughter people. Cool. Everything is positioned so that, you know, you could worship the sun because they're fucking stupid primitive place. We got to bring this stuff back then, man. But my favorite thing, uh, the train from Cusco to Puno that you can, the last car, the Inca classes, the first class in the last two cars on the train have leather arm chairs. Yeah. So the regular train ticket is like $14. And then that's from Cusco, Machu Picchu, Cusco to Puno. Oh, to put in seven hours through the Andes. Puno is the biggest city on Lake Titicaca. Okay. And Yeah. Um, yeah, you don't even know what's on the shores of Lake Titicaca has a statue of Beavis and butthead laughing. So one of my favorite things I've ever done in my life, uh, so the last two cars is the first class and it's only like 27 bucks. He got leather arm chairs in the caboose is a bar car and the ass end of the caboose is an out open air Bannister. So you can get a cocktail at the bar and then you're like leaning against the banister as you're going through the Andes. And then there's like birds of Lama. It's just absolutely amazing. It's awesome. You should go sometime. Yeah, we'll see.

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       I got other shit going on. Yeah. You know, so funny you said that your parents would send you to Pei-ru and my parents, uh, let my friends, my best friend Shauna and I go in the summer of 94, we were 17 years old, not yet 18. My Dad like just let us go to Hungary and this is right after communism fell. This isn't only two years after the Iron Curtain. So Budapest was still, it's like pretty much corrupt, still run by the Russian mafia. The apartment that we stayed at didn't have a phone. We had to use a phone, see later bitch and uh, on the corner of where our apartment was in Hungary was a place called the black roof. It was a strip club. So there was like terrible elements and we would just, you know, we were 17, so we were out at night like boozing cause you could drink in Hungary. No one gives a shit. I was 17 with my best friend, like running these streets. I would never let my kid go at 17. But they thought Hungary was the way it was when they were, you know, when they were living there during communism, when it was safe. But like not at all.

Speaker 1:          00:45:34       Here's what we're going to panic the morning after this one particularly notable bomb was set off because it was so powerful that, you know, we were, we were let's say 15 minutes outside of downtown Lima and, uh, in the house, uh, that I was staying in with my uncle and my cousins and aunt lived. They had this a window that was like an old school. It was a like 150 pound try Amazon think. So. No. So it was like 150 pound window that you had to, you used to crank, right. And then it would let go, Ooh. It was open by a crank, really heavy and enormous. And in the middle of the night, the bomb that went off was so big downtown that that window blew open and then just shattered everything. And it wasn't, it was national news, international news. Cause you know, the, the, the Shining Path movement was growing and I thought they were going to be like, you're getting on a plane today, right.

Speaker 1:          00:46:34       It barely registers to my parents. I was like, could you see it on CNN? They're like, yeah, well, you know how it goes. You're going to, so, uh, you guys going to go do this? You're going to go to the still going to school today? I'm like, yeah, like, yeah, worried about this shit at all. And they're like, hey. And my uncle was in media, so they're like, your uncle is a target because the, the shiny path would target people with influence, you know? So they were like, he had body guards and I'm like, wow, you're not worried about this

Speaker 5:          00:47:04       family didn't have any influence. Yeah. Scumbags. Just Hungarian. Totally everyday. What the fuck man? Um, what's wrong with their parents?

Speaker 1:          00:47:13       So did you know that, uh, one of our guys, this guy here who was a also legendary on our show

Speaker 10:         00:47:24       before you have sex,

Speaker 5:          00:47:27       if you want to be haunted for two or three hours, like you never been

Speaker 11:         00:47:30       in your life, you have access to marijuana too. Good. We'd listened to me. True. We'd alone can get you really hornier than normal, but it's been an Andrew will take about 10, 12 Benham girl before you want to have your sexual fun with your partner or whatever you do or masturbate.

Speaker 6:          00:47:50       So what do you think? First of all, about 10 or 12 minutes after looking at it, that guy, I never would have sex everywhere. That guy was really disturbing. Yeah. Um, so he's been featured on the program a few times and he's back. This is a, and we've an update. Well he has a, uh, I guess this is just a commentary that he has on a topic that is important to us. I've gone way up, let's say for what reason? It's Kinda nice now. See what, see if you agree with what he says. Are you sure it makes sense for now? What the Dennis Dennis questioning Dennis. Okay. For now, what the dentist do you really wish that all of us would have no more troubles with their gums or teeth? Because if you do, then you don't make any money and you don't have a life anymore and you wasted your life.

Speaker 6:          00:48:44       So if Christ comes right now and says, well, I'm going to heal everyone on this planet, Amount Hill, their teeth, then where does that leave you man? Wow. Right. I have more a serious issues with my dentist. Yeah, I mean that's ridiculous. I mean, wait, you're saying that he has a ridiculous beef with something irrational? It's irrational beat for, first of all, if you're going to make a video, put on a shirt, put on a shirt, opposite philosophy. He's never had shirts. It, it did look like he had some kind of hair gel in his hair though. But my dentist displays vacation photos in the waiting area and I think that just breeds resentment. Um, you know, you're sitting there and like there's pictures of him like on a boat in the Caribbean or wherever and it's like, he's like, you're about to pay for that.

Speaker 6:          00:49:40       How many calories? You didn't have a cavity, but I just got the bill on this fucking Bahamas. My kids want to go paragliding. God, Jesus Christ. Yeah. Well this guy has got beef with everybody. I love about find this guy. People just cousins. He sent them in. I Dunno. Yeah. I think that my favorite thing though is that he really thinks he cracked the case with this. Where he's like, he's like, Nah, if you don't have cavities anymore, where are you going to make your money? And he really feels like he solved the case. Totally. My crop that he's like, where's that? And where does that leave you man?

Speaker 6:          00:50:25       Yeah, he's talked some shit. He really ties and nailed you figured out your whole scale. Yeah. He just like a, like a homicide detective. He's just a really solved the case detective shall Lacey's on it. So if you, uh, how has it been by the way? We haven't seen you in a while, but how do you feel being housed now as you, for you went 10 years without a permanent address? I love it. Ah, yeah. Cause Oschner loves to cook and it's interesting the little things in life, like having a sock drawer and underwear drawer a really thrills us. And the fact that, uh, we can buy family size shampoos and everything was traveling, travel, see everything was travel size forever. And then we opened the fridge and we're like, we own this mustard, our third man. Uh, and it's, it's nice to I, this is my third time living in Los Angeles and I used to not like Los Angeles and now I love it because I'm older now I'm married and uh, now I can appreciate the, uh, fine fruits and vegetables that are available in the mortgage.

Speaker 6:          00:51:41       Um, you know, I lived here 20 years ago when I had the Sitcom. I lived on top of the Hollywood hills in this rockstar apartment, all glass walls. I view of all the lights of Los Angeles. I was swimming in cash and then 20 years ago I lived in, I'm sorry, 10 years ago I lived in Korea town and I was broke. And um, now it's like the three bears porridge is just right. Awesome. Not broke. I'm not rich. Just kind of uh, you know, life enjoyable but seems like you're very content and a good, a very good place. Like, yeah. That's awesome. Got to feel so displacing. I that one thing I didn't like about being on the road was that the constant living out of the suitcase, like my Tom and I were really hardcore road dogs. There's a few years there where, you know, you go out Wednesday, you come home Monday and then you reset.

Speaker 6:          00:52:34       It was just living out of it. We had to take Austin, uh, my wife traveled with me for eight of the 10 years did I didn't live anywhere. And I told her when we got together, when she's from Holland and when we, you know, the first year was a long distance relationship and then I said, if you want to be with me, you have to reduce your life. To one checked bag and to carry owns and for a woman, for a woman to reduce her life to like four pairs of shoes. Very admirable. She rolled with it and we had a great adventure. Um, you know, when we had time off, depending where we were, we would go like, and especially now with like airbnb and Uber and you know, you can, you can basically live anywhere and have a nice life, you know, four years in a row we went to Rome and rented an apartment for a week or two after I did like a couple months, once of gigs in Europe, did a month in Asia than we went to Bali for a couple of weeks.

Speaker 6:          00:53:36       Um, when I was still drinking in the states. When we had time off, we would go to New Orleans. We loved New Orleans, um, San Francisco, depending where we were when we had time off because we didn't live anywhere we could live wherever we want it. It's great cause I want to know with all this traveling with, I mean she was with you. How often did she go to the show? A Lot, actually. Yeah. Uh, I mean, that's probably why I married her. Yeah. Uh, but yeah, no, she, and she, that's one of the things that I, I love the most about her is she loved not coming from the comedy world. Yeah. Uh, she instantly loved comedy and loved hanging out with comedians. It's so funny when you start hanging, hanging out with comics, it's more fun than watching them do that. Totally. So like did that, that was the best thing.

Speaker 6:          00:54:23       And then, you know, doing festivals around the world and then, uh, having comedian friends and all these different countries go to Australia and then there's this group of comedian friends to hang out with, go to whatever country, and then there's, you know, or go to Chicago, good in New York and there's that new group of friends every week to hang out with. And, um, I also liked the fact that she was a heavy drinker. Did she, cause she could hold her liquor and, uh, and you know, I was a heavy drinker forever. And, uh, and yeah, you gotta have a partner in crime, right? You don't want her to be. Yeah. So it was fun. We were, we were partying and hanging out with comedians and, uh, when I busted my head open and stopped drinking four years ago, she, she dialed it back enormously. That's great.

Speaker 6:          00:55:13       You guys are a perfect match man. Yeah. And it's funny because Tom and I are the complete opposite of you guys. Like when, if I would go on the road with him like years ago, I would never go to his show and like pretty much vice first. I don't think he ever really now because we're so over it. Well like I get anxiety being in the room of a show period. It doesn't even matter. It's really actually so I don't like it. I don't like being in the showroom know, like when I'm not up there, you guys would have like us that um, you know, when your partner sees you so often, you know, you gotta make your show lively for them. Oh God, now no, I'm the opposite in the room. It's my Kryptonite and he's watching. There were years, I would not let him watch me cause I, it was like, it gave me so much anxiety because I, you know, me as a human and then to see that that would happen now would be is like, you know, because we know each other so well. It's been so long and it's such like, you know, a deep rooted relationship

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       is if, uh, if we're in like a work mode where another word, she goes, um, I'm work shopping this thing, let me know what you think. She might say like, so watch this specifically or vice versa. It'd be like, I'm doing this thing, do you think this is this or that? But then it's like we put on like workbrain it's not, and I don't feel like I'm watching my wife feel like I'm watching. Disassociate. Yeah. Disassociating on. And then we're like, we're talking about a bit, but just for like the joy of watching it, I can't do it. I don't like, I don't like watching, like if I have a spot at the store tonight, if I go there and they're like, I'll find out, when am I up? Oh, you're up in, you know, 20 minutes. Someone's on stage right now. I'll pop in, I'll start to watch them and after a couple minutes I'm just like, I got to get out of the room so I have to leave the room.

Speaker 6:          00:57:13       I, I, it's funny, I, I uh, I like standing there watching it. I, I still eyes love watching comedy. I like sometimes I'll, I'll get there early when I'm at the comedy store and I like when like somebody is destroying the room before where you can say something and then it's uh, I'll give you an example. Like the, at the, I go to New York once or twice a year just to do sets at the comedy cellar. I love it. And last summer I went to New York and um, I had to go on after Amy Schumer. And so Amy Schumer, I had to follow her like three times that week. And you know, she's from New York, she's just hometown hero. Everyone loves her. She's, she's destroying the place. And she told the story about her father. She said he kind of an asshole, he's got ms or whatever. But she's just for her father and she loves him and she's been paying somebody to come and Jack him off.

Speaker 6:          00:58:11       Oh God. And so this was her closer and uh, and, and, and, and she absolutely destroyed the place. So like you got the, you know, there's the normal anxiety, nervousness as comedian when you're about to go on stage and you're, you're in your mind about what you want to talk about. And then when somebody is on before you and they're absolutely ripping the place to shreds and they're being adored, and then that adds even an extra layer of intensity to your, yeah. Anxiety. And so I guess for me it just came to me the first night, I'm like, oh my God, she's absolutely just can't believe she's talking about her dad like this. Yeah. It just came to me like moments before I walked on stage. I walked out there and I just acted very kind of shy and, and sheepish. Hi everybody. Um, please forgive me.

Speaker 6:          00:59:06       I'm a little nervous tonight. This, this isn't my normal job. My normal job as I jack off, Amy Schumer's fine. I'm not used to working under these bright lights. And, uh, normally I worked to candle light with some soft Sinatra, the backgrounds and like, it just, it's like, it's, yeah, it's like surfing, you know, you jumping on someone else's wave. Totally. Um, no, but you know why you, you do that though, because you're a better comedian. Ah, actually that's the only time I'll tell you this, the only time I do feel inclined to like, Oh, pay attention, pay attention is if someone is ripping the room, perform. Yeah, that is, that will make me, but I'm doing that not for my own curiosity. I'm doing that to be able to be effective and know what's going on. You know, watched the person before me just so like, Oh, if they, oh, they do this topic or this topic or you know, if you ever thought about with all the touring and all the years you've been doing it, do you ever, have you ever thought about how many hours you've probably written or no?

Speaker 6:          01:00:09       Uh, no. Uh, well, I mean I've put out a, I just came out with a new album, all hail laughter and that's my fourth album. Um, how much unreleased stuff? Yeah, I have no idea. I mean I videos and videos of things from the past. I don't know, it's just amazing to me how long I've been doing comedy and uh, it's, I that I can't sell more tickets in certain places. I got to a, I'm in Sacramento next week. I be doing that. The punchlines is such a great room. Great Room. I love Sacramento and, and Lady Bird was one of my favorite movies of the year. I thought Greta Gerwig should've won the, the, the best act. And I loved the fact that the film took place in Sacramento. It's this girl coming of age story. Anyway, I get this a email yesterday. I'm just saying that a minimal tickets have been sold and it's like, when does this anxiety leave you as a performer?

Speaker 6:          01:01:07       Yeah. How much do you have to do in your life and career? Get where it's like, you know, I shouldn't have to worry about, I know a room like that. So what though? But the weird thing is they're really, everybody will have a theory and that nobody is 100% right because there is no formula. If we all knew the formula for sure and everyone would just be like, oh, just do this. But that's the thing. It's like you just don't know. I mean some, I mean sometimes it's a something online, like people started selling tickets off of viral videos now, you know. Oh yeah. I mean you can just do something that just blows up online. All of a sudden that sells tickets. Sometimes it's more traditional, it's TV, it's movie or it's a special that really resonates with an audience. But even that you just don't know it.

Speaker 6:          01:01:54       There's no formula. That's the most, I dunno, frustrating part. But that's the part that if there was an answer, you know, it's like trying to, how do you make a a movie be a blockbuster hit? And they like, well, you know, it's like, I dunno. It's, I guess you'd think about things the way you are in your life. Like my eye, there are certain comedians I love and like I will go see them. Uh, I'm fans of certain people. I love Van Morrison. Van Morrison played at the Wiltern last week. I W I saw him once before in New York years ago. And he's older. Yeah. And, uh, you know, I went and I, and I'm a fan. I, it's like I can appreciate just being in the same room with the guy because I love him so much, but only because I'm a huge fan of Van Morrison. I could pick out the five songs that I knew. I think anyone else who went to that show would have thought, oh my God, I can't believe he didn't do, have I told you lately, or x, y I wish she'd done more hits or whatever, you know? Um, I, it's, I don't know. It's, I guess people who knows what I'm trying to, no, I dunno. I mean, I know what you're trying to say. If you love somebody, you would support them. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. Guests. No, it's true. It's true.

Speaker 1:          01:03:16       It comes from having a devotion to

Speaker 6:          01:03:21       being real. That's what a fan. But I mean, there's like, there's, there's some cities like San Francisco and Chicago and Atlanta. What's your best city? Ah, I love San Francisco. The punchline. I like Minneapolis. Acme. That's great. Uh, the Atlanta punchline had been playing for years. Um, Chicago xannies you know, there's, there's, there's, there's a lot of them that I love. Yeah. Uh, the Sydney comedy store in Australia is one of my favorites and they're good to you. I was there last year and it had been a few years since I had been there. But yeah, I've played there a lot through the years. One of my favorite rooms in the world. If you played there. Uh, I did. Uh, I did a guest set there when I was, I was in town for

Speaker 1:          01:04:08       festival a few years back and I got to do like a guest sat there, which was really fun. That was it. That's the most,

Speaker 6:          01:04:16       I love Australian audiences and Sydney's one of my favorite cities in the world. I just had to cancel for someone's going to do

Speaker 1:          01:04:22       ne next month and then let you cancel because I booked that, that movie. So it's like a good reason to have the cancel. Yeah. But it's fucking my second cancellation

Speaker 6:          01:04:35       or a, well, maybe when you go back you'll do the Enmore theater. That's what I was booked to the more, it was amazing. I was booked to do it. We were, we were in that part of town. New Town is like the, it's the cool gay, artsy area. Like if you were a, an artist or a musician, I'm just bomb because here's what

Speaker 1:          01:04:54       now I want to do. I want to rebook Australia, but I cannot book something again and cancel. Right. But I don't know what like, so I want to book something without a lot of, uh, a heads up. In other words, I want to be like, hey man, can we try to book Australia for like eight weeks from now? So that I know that I can definitely

Speaker 6:          01:05:18       do it right. But I don't know if they'll go for that. It's pretty, I Melbourne of course, uh, is amazing. Awesome. Yeah. Brisbane Perth. Yeah. Love these poets supposed to do. I got to New Zealand, the New Zealand comedy festival haven't been, um, that's god that was one of the best months. Yeah. I refuse to go. Really? No, I actually asked to go and, uh, the promoters were like, ah, we don't think you should add a New Zealand to this. And I was like, why? And they're like, because it's not that big of a market and you're not that big of a name. And I was like, all right. I just thought it'd be really, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I was like, okay, so I'll just leave it as it. I mean, there was there talking about it like, I, after all you've done, they were like, oh yeah. They said, no, I know when I tried to add new field, what does the performer have to do?

Speaker 6:          01:06:09       It's a funny, Tom and I talk about that. Like in our business, you're never ever enough on the food chain, no matter how successful you are, you're always a piece of shit. We're saying. We were saying that like, Bill start saying things to you, like they'll go, uh, and then, uh, this is the offer you're going to get and somebody in your position should be pretty happy with that off. Wow. Wow. Oh yeah. That was what we were talking about when you were going, I got a message about my, my ticket sales for next week and Sacramento. Fuck, do I have to worry? Yeah. And by the way, what point in your life, and it's not, it's not only that, the real, the real job of a real club is that they are, suppose you're supposed to deliver the thing on stage and like you do what you can and your, your podcast or you post that you're coming somewhere, but they are your promoter.

Speaker 6:          01:07:04       That's the job they, and a lot of clubs don't look at it like that. Now. It's not your job you're doing is like extra as far as promoting, but they're supposed to promote your show and they're supposed to be creative in ways to get people to come to that show, you know? And so when they're like, yeah, you didn't sell tickets, I feel I'd be like, now you didn't sell tickets, right, because you were supposed to let p, what did you do? You send out an email once or something, right? Why don't you be a little more proactive about it and then they tell you, oh, we got to back out this amount from your pay because it costs me like five grand and advertising. And you're like, what did you know that you can ask? I have five grand. I didn't see any bus posters. You can legally ask for receipts on that. I would like to, whenever whenever you do a build Burgo, if they do like deductions, they'll say, you know, advertising this, you could be like, I need to see the receipt receipt or, or the ubiquitous radio spots where they're like, oh, we spent thousands on radio. You're like, okay, that's really hard to trace. Like she'd be like, why would you do that? You know who's listening? Yeah. Yeah. Well, my favorite

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       is always, oh, you, you just missed your bonus by 11 people. Yeah. You sell a hundred tickets, you're going to get the bonus. And we only sold 89 fucking counting. And I had one

Speaker 1:          01:08:30       say more. I did a weekend a few years ago at a club that held, um, I think the club, the club, let's say three 50 and I had a bonus that would kick in regardless if it were free or paid tickets. And I had paid tickets, bonus would kick in at 300 capacity. So if as long as we're throwing people in the room, I would get the bonus. And I had like between two 85 and two 95 at every show, but paid. Oh, that's great. And they didn't give me wow. Anyhow. And then I called, that's the business. What kind of fucking deal is that? I sold tickets, hard tickets. Right. And then, but I didn't hit that magic number and they're like, we'll get them next time. Next time. Yeah, no, I do the other club next time as well. How about

Speaker 5:          01:09:17       exactly? I love it. He's like, like some of these club owners driving a brand new Mercedes Benz every year and it's like, wow. Yeah. Just missed the bonus. There was a place in town here where the guy would, they don't pay for, they don't pay you for spots and he would pull up people like we can't pay for a spot to pull up in like a new Lexus. Yeah, you can't, you can't dish everybody 15 bucks for the set. And he was my favorite story in the world. Chad Daniels, who's Hilarious, who your friends are. You guys did that documentary together. Uh, I need you to kill. So he did some club, I won't say where. And the guy, the owner of the club pays you a different rate contingent upon what time of year you do the clubs. So in the summer, let's say he'll pay you 1500 but in the winter it's $2,000.

Speaker 5:          01:10:04       And so Chad goes in the summertime and he's working out new material and the club owner is like upset with that because you know, Chad's working it out. So it's not like kill, kill, kill, kill, kill. And he knows a child's capable of it. He's a really funny comedian. And so the owner is like, hey man, what the hell? Like you came and you did all this new stuff, like you're not killing. You know what the fuck? And he goes, well, he goes, I'm doing my Somerset to go. He summary, he stuck with doing this new set that wasn't killing. That's just just to tell that guy I'm doing my Somerset. I don't know him, but now I love it. That's fantastic. Yeah. Somerset, I'm still, the guy's like, dude, what the fuck? He's like, well, you know, I'm giving you what you pay for in Somerset. I mean, have you ever heard of that? I didn't know that. The club, I never, I know. Yeah, I know that like, I know clubs, especially old mark. Is that a room in Texas? No, I'll tell you. I'll tell you after the shades in North America, cold market clubs especially, you know your mom and pop clubs midway will, they're

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       always packed in the winter because people sure pack up, fill it up. Yeah. And then clubs in like Texas and Florida in the summer because of the air conditioning. Yeah. Therefore too. It's interesting. Yeah. So, but like those, those cold places in the, if you sell tickets there in the summer, they're like, all right, you're legit. But they expect to have more empty seats in the summer and that the idea that they'd be like, and that means we're not going to pay you as much is yeah, it's the business where it's the shittiest man. Um, do you think this lady is touched or no?

Speaker 12:         01:11:50       Seven oh 4:30 PM. I'm just wondering what the heck is then our water supply. What the heck is going on? Why? I've done the Metallica. I thought that create a rainbow effect in a sprinkler.

Speaker 1:          01:12:08       She thinks there's a government,

Speaker 5:          01:12:10       Huh?

Speaker 12:         01:12:11       Get out of our ground. That allowed rule type of effect to happen like prisons done and our moon anymore. Everywhere we look, the visible that crumb is rainbow. That cannot be natural. It wasn't.

Speaker 5:          01:12:29       Well, you know when you're offended by your beauty, you know, because I agree. Baby checkout. So I agree. You know, she lives in a good neighborhood. When you can hear the sirens in the background and the bullet holes in the fence, that's a nice touch.

Speaker 12:         01:12:43       But now it happened and now we have the naked have got there. What the Hell is going on? What is oozing out of our,

Speaker 1:          01:12:53       we as a nation need to appreciate a rainbow baby on a small level. Well, for people who aren't watching the show, so it's a sprinkler and it's created a natural rainbow. Yeah. And she's convinced that the government has poisoned her water supply. Water, the light colors. Yeah. She really, she really broke through that conspiracy though.

Speaker 5:          01:13:11       Can, does that leave you man? Huh?

Speaker 1:          01:13:16       I think to, to quote Dr drew when he came on our show, there is a huge problem with it. Right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I really are fucked. That's pretty bad. I feel like a fifth grader knows that, you know, light through water. Of course. Yeah. They teach you that stuff. Clouds, rain rainbows. Um, Tom, they uh, do you have dates listed on your site? I do, yeah, of course. Um, let's, uh, let's go through because this, we are doing, um, well that's hardcore pornography. We have, uh, not on my site. No, no, no. Sometime around so you can see her car. I, um, I have, uh, he loves us. Porn. Thanks. Or plugging my, uh, dates I'm going to be on, this is not happening. March 16th. Oh, a fun. That's great. Yeah. This, this episode will drop in a few weeks, so that's what I'm kind of, Oh, so you might have just missed

Speaker 6:          01:14:17       Thomas Thomas Sacramento or has this is not happening? Malaria. You might see him. Well, no, but it's just a, you know, it's true.

Speaker 1:          01:14:31       Um, when's your Sacramento? It's march 15 through 17. He's at the punchline. Maybe we can wait. We can swap in episode. Do this, trade out the other one. It doesn't matter. Right. Try it. Try it out. Uh, then he's going to, Holy Shit. He's going to be in Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines. Jesus Hong Kong, uh, later in Austin, uh, at in Vegas at Brad. Garret's like Tahoe. He's doing, uh, oh, the Great Tacoma Club. We've both done that and enjoyed that. It's a great room. Spokane. Yep. I haven't done spoken. I've done that. It's great. I've done lol. Looks like you're doing an lol and San Antonio, the La Jolla store. Xannies in Chicago. You're doing poly, you're going to go to

Speaker 6:          01:15:15       Paris. What's that? Have you done that before? Actually, I was in Paris in January at this. I, I've, I've, I've played in Paris a lot. Uh, but there's this theater that I played in January and uh, theater la over. Ah, oh. And I'm booked back there October 15th and I am going to fill my next hour special on October 15th. So if there's any listeners who is looking for a reason to go to Paris, that you should come to my, my, our special dude. Now we're going to be awesome. When you do Paris, is it mostly ex pats? I mean it's obviously, no, actually this, when I was there in January, it was, it was mostly French people watch spoke English. So for my hour special, I need to, uh, I need, I need to get some more English speaking people there, but, and it's a phenomenal room.

Speaker 6:          01:16:12       I have a long history with Paris. My first love of my adult life. Uh, I lived with a Parisian woman in San Francisco for seven years, not to Lee. We're still good friends. And the very first time I went to Paris, uh, some guys tried to rob me and I was maced and really, ah, I've got some great stories. I almost drowned in Thailand on this French resort region. Audiences get all the nuances of your, like if they also like stories and they, they really love theater. So you'll like, you'll never, you would never get a heckler in pay in France, right. Because the audience is just conditioned to watch the show, respect the performer on stage. But uh, yeah. But uh, you know, so I've got my, you know, best stories traveling the world. I haven't done a special in like five years. Think so do this is, it's all my anxiety. I cannot believe you're going to do it in Paris. Yeah. Wild. What size venue is the, is this theater?

Speaker 5:          01:17:16       It's holds three 50. Perfect. Wonderful. When I was there in January, I sold 240 tickets. It's amazing. I can sell more tickets in Paris than I can in some clubs in the United States, international comedian. Like you're kind of a trailblazer that way. So this is fantastic. It's great. And I, thanks Christina. And I, uh, you know, I, I love Paris. I got great stories and observations and a pair earth. It's magic and eat a lot while you're there, man. There's this, I this last summer when I was there, I discovered this a Archna googled best patisserie is there's this place called storer, s, t, O, h, r, e, r. And uh, I followed them on Instagram. It's the rate, it's the number one rated patisserie in, in Paris. It's on this street called roof mount to Goya. And this street is, it's got bread shops and cheese shops and it's, it's such an amazing food street, but this patisserie places the number one rated patisserie.

Speaker 5:          01:18:35       And when I go to Paris now I'll take the metro straight there. And like they, they, there's these custard tarts with like raspberries and, Oh man, I'm trying to be carpet on top of it. Well that's the thing, like when I was there, it's, you know, I'm trying to be, I left breadcrumbs all over the city. The, these, these baguettes are only like a dollar 20 and these, you know, you just just walk around nibbling on bread and then you like, I got my little patisserie pastries in a box for done for whenever I'm ready to sit down,

Speaker 6:          01:19:13       easily old me out out. I would look like, uh, what's that guy that Burt looks like Gerard dip? I'll do, I'll, there's a, there's a fee as a is a food channel show. Yeah. Where it's, I saw it when I was in Europe, so I don't know if it's, if it's, I thought it was the food channel, but it's, he's basically eating his way through Europe. Dude, he's been, he no badness. You see like a couple of years ago there was a big story where he was on a flight and he pissed in the, I'm in the aisle aisle of the plane and they're like, what the fuck man? He's like, he's like, he's well over three bills now. And they're like, you know what kind of behaviors? And he's like, well, I drink several bottles of wine every day. So that's a contributes to him gaining that much weight. And also he's just like, so of my behaviors, just kind of erratic because I'm drunk apparently in the aisle I'm drinking constantly. He like he out with like

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       a, with lock cores.
