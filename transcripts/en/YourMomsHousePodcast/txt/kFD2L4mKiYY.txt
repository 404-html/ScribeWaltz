Um, we did it episode 400 crazy. I can't believe we've found a way to talk about a farting poop pooping. You sound like one of the critics. It's the only thing we do here. It's amazing though, isn't it? I mean, yeah, there's a lot of stuff that goes on for a four. I remember that happy 400th anniversary. That'd be 400 a smurf or re before hundred. I can't believe it. When we started this silly show in our house in silver lakes. Yeah. I remember we sat at the kitchen table, I'll never forget this, and we had the discussion over what to name our new podcast. Yeah. And we, I forget the other candidates, but it was basically, what's the dumbest thing we could call a podcast? And we were like, oh, that's your mom's house. Where are you going to your mom's house? Your Mom's house? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:01:41       Yeah. Isn't that silly? It's so silly. It's so silly. I remember writing down in a, an old joke book, um, some dumb line about opening a restaurant called your mom's house so that you could say that there's somebody like, just for the purpose of that. Yeah. It's mom's house. It's your mom's house. But here we are, 400 episodes. I can't believe I'm living in the house. That Brown Bill Brown talk bill. The guy that used to work in this space made beautiful music. We make, we make different types of music here. Yeah. Yep. Different stuff. Same strokes, different say for everyone. Everyone's the same. So excited though. Yeah. What's your favorite thing we've ever done on the show or you think it's for after the break here? After we, oh yeah. You know what though? I'm still caught up on their brown story because you started to tell me a brown story and then I was like, wait, save it, save it. And now I'm still thinking about courses. What happened? Yeah, they're going about it. You ready to do this? Yeah. Cause I have a good story for you to. Hmm. Okay. Yeah. Can't wait. There you go. Let's get it started. Episode Mute my mom.

Speaker 3:          00:04:14       400 episodes of that opening song. It never gets old to me. I still like it on songs. You get tired. I don't want to, I mean, you're tired of it. Great. Sound at your mom's house. Intro music. I like it. I should have beta. I love the, I love the intro. Yeah, the sweet guitar licks like, Oh yeah, it's absurd. Every, oh my God, I almost just my uncle.

Speaker 5:          00:04:34       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:04:36       Toilet paper. No, I can use this. Uh, no, probably. Go ahead and do the paper. You get it? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I could see where this is going to go. Okay. Fan for a minute.

Speaker 5:          00:04:44       Okay. So yeah, I love, I can, I think I've told it on another podcast before, but Ryan match the match man down in breast balls, beach, Florida. He created that opening song and a bunch of like the segment intros and I remember sending him clips and being like, here's Mr t right, here's coach ice and but you know, left it to him to be creative with it. Yeah. And he came up with that.

Speaker 3:          00:05:14       Well, cause we at the time we're playing that Mr t clip, that was a silly one. Like everyone, anything that said, mom, your mom yeah. Treats your mother. Right. Your mother, right. Oh he came on his mind because there were like your mama's so fat. And he's like, Whoa, whoa. Don't get anybody's mother into this. The stupid video. And then it went to your mom and the fuck is stands. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:05:32       And then there was, uh, who was Randy that had nothing that looks like, you know what that looks like. That's your coffee. But the, uh, uh, Randy was Randy, that was hall of fame. Tight end for the Baltimore Colts. Yeah. Um, okay. Name. I can't, I just drew a blank on his name. Um, but he had dementia and, um, let me look, let me look it up. Who it is so I can, I can tie it in

Speaker 3:          00:06:06       kind of a gay name for a position and foosball, isn't it? Yeah, the tight end. Yeah. John Mackey, that's how it works. John Mackey and he had dementia and then his wife and he, he were being interviewed. Yeah. And then, uh, and then the guy was like, well, what's it like living with him and isn't she? And then she, yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:06:23       it's really sad actually. It's one of the saddest things, right? Because she goes, you know, we repeat the conversations and when he asked me like, you know, when are we leaving? I tell him, uh, Randy, who's a made up name of a mechanic, he's working on the car. And then, you know, that puts them off for a while and then he asks again like, are you ready to go? And then they cut to the interviewer and the interviewer goes, John, is Randy working on the car right now? I could try to like get in on the thing. And then John Goes, Ooh, is Randy?

Speaker 3:          00:06:58       That's another hilarious scene. Just like Stevie's hilarious. Right? Well you think that's hilarious to, and he's really funny and they are making fun of me really dark. You're making fun of me. It is dark, but Stevie doesn't have dementia. He's moderately touched, but he's tired. Yeah, Stevie special. But he's not retarded. Yeah, Stevie's got a promise with you. He's got a lot of problems and we really, I really liked that one. And then I really liked the Todd Phillips. He enjoying? Yeah, no, she's the smartest one in the whole documentary. She's the Yoda. She's like, you shouldn't be with someone that abuses you and you're like, how does this bitch? No, she's the only one that says anything remotely normal

Speaker 5:          00:07:41       that's in the bed and is even more disabled than her. Right. Has even greater insight. Remember? No, I don't remember what she said, but I do remember her friend was like,

Speaker 3:          00:07:51       oh, right, right. The he needs a piece of shit. Right. She's the only one that's flat out like, look, see, he's a shit head. Yeah. That guy's a real shit bird. You need to get out, man. He smoked. He gets mad. They get over it. I was like real life stuff. Later on down the road near the road gets mad. He always pluralizes is the wrong word.

Speaker 6:          00:08:13       They were changes. People change it.

Speaker 3:          00:08:15       See, he always gets the plural round. Yeah. I like when he's all, people call me snake cause I ain't afraid of them and nobody calls. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:08:22       When you woke up to a rattlesnake, do you stand there? Do you run like hell, Fintech a chance again, better not run. I was like, do I take a chance? Then people in take a chance again stabbed in the back again. Oh, well. All right,

Speaker 5:          00:08:38       well I guess that's not the people call me snake, but we'll see you get the point. Hello problems. Oh, here we go. Here we go. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:08:46       That's why I get my name's snake for him. I ain't afraid of him. Never has been except whereas a kid. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       That'd be a big part of when you, that would negate your first statement. Right. Never been afraid of him set for the first 12 years of my life philosophy. Yeah. Yeah. Cause you never implies never either. Never or it has been symbolic logic does. You don't even need to take it. He's wrote that fucking bug, right? Yeah. Suck the Venn diagrams that those types of things are a big part of, uh, the culture these days. The statements that don't make sense. Untruth. Yeah. They're a big part of the news. I think we're all kind of becoming experts on things. It makes sense and no nonsense. It is, can I, and I know everyone's buying 1984 the George Orwell bug, but it is double plus good. It's called new speak in that book. And it's, there's totally an, an entirely new lexicon and its new speak and it's jibberish and it's double plus good.

Speaker 2:          00:09:45       I'd rather focus on whether eating ass is gay or not. Agreed. And we get to the important stuff. This lady makes a great point and it's something I, I really wanted to highlight this. Everyone was like, what's special about episode 400? What's going to go on? Well, this clip was sent in and it made me think of what, what would be a better, um, celebration of this podcast? Then if legitimately in episode 400, we can get you to open up your eyes, open up your heart, open up your mind, and ultimately open up your mouth to lick my rear end. It's never going to have, can you just, but can you just for this episode, for the episode, can you entertain the idea just for this podcast? Entertain the idea. I mean, I guess I owe it to the listeners. There we go for 400. And I see just for you doing that, I think that, uh, there's like, uh, a need to celebrate that you just, you just scared. Just that you're entertaining the idea.

Speaker 7:          00:10:48       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:10:52       those are celebration horns and explosions in the morning crew. I didn't even see that. But listen, first of all, can I ask you a real question? Is this woman going to threaten our marriage? Swipey number two, right here. Am I looking down the barrel of the next Mrs [inaudible] Gora uh, this is just, you know what? Somebody that I want you to mirror, it's not going to expose us to grow up, but I want you to be like, oh, I could, I could be just like this. Just listen. I know you're big on logic. You're big on philosophy. Just knows. She has to say. Okay. That's all I'm asking. I tell you what I'm afraid of. What your asshole pacifically what? It's the heat. Yeah. So hot down there, the heat and the sweat and the hair. That's more than one thing. And the smells. Jeez. Why here? Your dumps? They don't sound good. I can only deduce that the smells aren't good. I, I've heard you shit. I can't, I can't unknow it is, it's a nice man. But do you think you could get it sterile enough that I won't contract some kind of, um, and ultimately disease? Absolutely sterile. Let's, let's jump on this journey together. I'm holding your hand. Let's go through this whole thing and see if, uh, this lady couldn't convince you otherwise.

Speaker 4:          00:12:13       Why is he gay? Full of fee meal for a, for a man to be okay with his female licking his ass during sex. She fuck with your herbage I'm as local

Speaker 2:          00:12:28       liquor. So right away she's saying that that's what she does. Now let's see why she does it.

Speaker 4:          00:12:34       Yeah. My Nigga, we let me lick his ass the shit out of his ass. Like niggas eat pizza.

Speaker 2:          00:12:42       Okay, so right away you know that there's ladies out there that go really hardcore into it. He's not saying like that. She goes right to those women are mentally unstable. She seems fine. She seems really sweet. I actually really enjoy her demeanor and I like her. I'm just not convinced she's right in the head. I don't know her well enough, but I don't think that's normal. There's an interesting statement. Not that I had this fear anyways, but just I'm saying she has,

Speaker 4:          00:13:10       how long think is gay horse not a between a man and a fee meall right to go home because it's between a man and a female. I agree that's

Speaker 2:          00:13:22       big toe and that, and that was never an issue. Obviously for us. We didn't say this was gay, but that speaks to a certain segment of the population that does have that apprehension. So I just think that's a very soon offended personally the use of pronouns. Like she didn't, she wasn't inclusive of all the different binary genders. So yeah, I mean what is a female? What does mail, what is she talking about? So it's a, it's disrespectful firstly, but doing it is, it's just like the gate. It's just like, but yes, to your point, I don't think she's right and I have never heard it actually expressed that way. She said it perfectly. She's speaking actually to something different. She speaking, telling men who don't want to try it, she's not speaking to me. Obviously I'm back. I'm on my hands and knees. I'm praying the rosary.

Speaker 2:          00:14:11       I'm making dedications to it, but their rosary speaking to you sound like your mother told me, well, what's in it for me? What's in it for me? Let's go there. Remember the dog food ring? Yeah. What's in it? Well, what do you need? What do you want? Some material thing. I mean absolutely. I thought just knowing that you're blowing your husband's mind and giving him great pleasure to be enough. Not only works when you're dating, that's not the same. There's married kid. It doesn't work that way. Really disappointing on, let me just think about it. I mean I want to go to Tahiti. That's a bucket list thing. Yeah, but we're not going to do that right now. Well, when Ellis is a little older and we're in the overlooking

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       the water, the one that I want to stay in. Yeah. That's when the ass lick will take place, so I got to put off an ass lick for possibly a decade. Come on. It's hot. Are there and to eat. That's the problem is that I'm actually making more problems for myself just to, come on, let me just think here. All right. What I would like, let's be real. Let's be real. Let's be price tag on this, uh, on this sexual act. Let me think about what I really want in life. I mean, I, like I said, I want to go on trips. I like trips and I'm not terribly. All right. What about a materialistic? I mean, and also by the way, if you agree to terms on this, you can't just go, Huh? That'd be like, I did it. I did it. I did it.

Speaker 3:          00:15:32       Map so scared. You got a barrier, you know? Good. What'd you wax it? Yeah. You promise. Hairless. Hairless. I'm afraid. Honestly. I'm afraid of the hair and the smell that hair traps. Let's keep it honest and, and the heat, there's a lot of heat because I put my finger in there. Playfully. Not In there, but are in the area. Yeah. Pretend spread your cheeks and it's hot. It's so sweaty. It's like a jungle. Um, okay. I'll get it waxed while you're gone this weekend. You're going to come back to a hairless ass on stuff for my birthday. It a birthday treat, June 18th. Oh, it's my special birthday. Yeah. I get to lick your ass. How did that happen? It's also father's day. That's how that happened.

Speaker 2:          00:16:14       That's what's going on. Let me think. What do you think? It's waxed.

Speaker 3:          00:16:21       Okay, so that's out of the car. That's fine. Mm. Signed off on that.

Speaker 2:          00:16:25       What do you really want to Haiti? I mean, come on Fiji or weekend to loom.

Speaker 3:          00:16:33       I want to go stairwells on the beach and stare at Shit. It's gotta be somewhere. We're going to bring the boy right now. Oh God. It's no vacation at all. Is it? I know. How about a day where you watch the kid and I go stare at the beach. Yeah, fine. I want to a Malibu or something. Yeah. Check in some nice place alone. She's fine. But I mean, we're talking like squat over your face squat and you just, and you do just uh, yeah. Tongues, worlds. I didn't agree to that first part of the deal. No, but I don't trust that your thighs can, I think you're going to smother me if you do it that way. Hold my asshole's going to but not, I don't trust that you will. You will respect me enough to not smoke. You're your joker. You're mean mean you'll smother me. No, I'll just, I'll just no, no. Stand over you. I'll just kind of ease into it.

Speaker 8:          00:17:29       No, my ass. My ass. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:17:34       no singing. Do you like what about I, we do the, we do the Dai Dai change. That's the only way I would do it. The spread. Oh okay. Yeah. The pan. While your rebate, remember laying on my back. I pulled my legs up. You changed my diet and you got to town. Yeah, I go to town. Let me listen to what she has. I'm just not an end to this dude. I'm really not into that. I'm trying. I'm really, I'm really trying to wrap my brain. Yes,

Speaker 4:          00:17:58       you got to be honest fellows. It feel good to hear your a sleep. Cause I had my [inaudible] bad few in shit feel real good to me. So I know that she feel good to y'all and y'all just uncomfortable because she feel good and he seen your Aas and you know that's a gay spot. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 3:          00:18:20       I'm not worried about the gay stuff. Yeah. I don't think anything between man, I who cares. Even if it were, I'm just honestly, I'm honestly afraid of bacteria and you know that I am, I'm afraid of vomiting. No, no. I'm talking about ingesting fecal matter. I'm a very, uh, you know, against poopy in my mouth. Full inspection. If you can't get that on an eyeball and there's just germs, bacteria, let's have fucking doctors write in and tell us how many fecal to oral cases they've seen. You'd get worms, parasites. So that's the major concern. Yes. Honestly, it's sickness that terrifies me. I mean, Shit, man. That's how you get like hepatitis, when you go to other countries, it's, it's fecal matter in food. He's going to let me live with this request. Burning too bubbly. Just say, ah, yeah, I'm afraid we're just going to have to not.

Speaker 3:          00:19:22       You just almost signed up for, I didn't sign it. I'm afraid. Listen, if we have doctors write in, if somebody can assure me in the medical community listening that it would not result in me getting hepatitis or some horrific disease, then yeah, go ahead. Courses. If he tell me it's not possible. So it's dirty fecal. It is. Yours is, no, I'm saying after a shower, stop saying like you're like dirty. It's not, it's not finishing it. That's what I don't care is why? Because I get leaky, but all the time I shit, this is why I started brown to shower because I make a brown and then I wipe, wipe, wipe and the Brown keeps coming and that's when I had

Speaker 4:          00:19:58       good to hear your ASD

Speaker 3:          00:20:01       speaking as somebody whose finger doesn't close after childbirth. Alright. This is just dumb at this point. It's not done. It's a valid point. It's bacteria that you shouldn't put in your mouth. All right. I mean, aren't you afraid of that? No. No. I think you're, the whole thing is nonsense. I think you should lick fiefs. Buttle no, I'm going to have him look mine. Cause can we talk about the Brown story? I'm dying to hear the end of it. All right. All right. Episode 400.

Speaker 9:          00:20:37       I love this intro. Really talent. Talent. Yeah, of course. I didn't production plop

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       sounds and the audio cut out. Yeah, sure. Um, okay. So let's start. Walk me through the beginning. So, oh well first of all, I just had an amazing weekend. Amazing, amazing, amazing. I started in Tux in Arizona, 805 and they were like guys just getting started as a springtime. And uh, but uh, son Pusan Yeah. Pusan Arizona, uh, brought Josh Potter with me. Very funny. Super Funny Guy. Sweet guy too. Yeah. Really great guy.

Speaker 5:          00:21:18       He, he, he killed it. Great shows. So we started there. We did the reality theater. So much fun. Thank you everybody that came out. I had an absolute fucking blast there. Then the next day we went to Reno.

Speaker 2:          00:21:33       You know, I'm feeling like you're kind of glazing over the important points of the story. What were you eating? How frequently we went to El Charro. Mexican steakhouse. Sounded like your recipe for El bub blasting. Yeah. Yeah, but no, I mean it was delicious. You know, I just had meat and veggies. That's what I, that's how I get down. Yeah. Um, and then I see, by the way, I worked out before every single show. Okay, good. That's what I do as part of my routine. I mean, the hotel shows him three hours. Cool. I'm going to go to the gym. I spend about an hour there, then come back, shower, get ready for the show. So that exhausts me. It doesn't, it, that makes me more tired. I add the ad, make me angrier. It makes me awake and alert and I feel like, Oh yeah, I drank coffee around five.

Speaker 2:          00:22:19       I get jacked. I take a couple of doubts and I watch a Netflix. Oh, see I can't, I can't do it that way. I can't lay down and do a show I don't like, Oh yeah, I can lay down in the green room and then get up on stage. I go from zero. It makes me feel more tired. It's just the way I am. Like if I'm, if I'm laying around, I feel more tired. If I'm active, I feel more alert. I always feel like when we're done making fitness, I'd have to take a nap. I'm just tired. Interesting. Now the only time yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:22:46       that I would feel that way is if it's like balls to the wall, you know, blow out workout. But I don't do that. I try to do,

Speaker 2:          00:22:54       do moderate so that like, oh, heart rates up, I'm sweating, but I don't try to go like, um, you know, super high intensity. Yeah. Anyway, um,

Speaker 5:          00:23:05       so after that a reno, which I think I'd been to reno, but I don't even remember, but we went to Reno to the Grand Sierra resort. Such a beautiful, beautiful theater. The Grand Theater, they remodeled it. Unbelievable. I mean, just such a gorgeous venue. Amazing history. They had I guess as this is one of the old school reno casinos that has been remodeled. Sinatra had your favorite. Yeah. The greatest singer of all time

Speaker 10:         00:23:34       up, up, up, up. Look at that time at the bar, hooked up, up. Uh, those legs are going on for days,

Speaker 2:          00:23:42       so, Oh God, he

Speaker 5:          00:23:45       scaled the Bup, bup, not thinking anyway. He didn't want it has the biggest stage, like actual physical square footage of stage in the world.

Speaker 2:          00:23:57       Yeah. And they said it that stage. Well the stage that you're on has the curtain dropped and is enormous. If you go behind the curtain, there's a plane, there's Nana's, um, just they land a plane on,

Speaker 5:          00:24:10       no, no, it's a pro. It's a prop for a, for a play that ran for 35 years, but it's a full size plane. It looks like a bike parked in someone's backyard because that's how big backstage, it's not even, it doesn't even stand out. Like whoa. It's just, it goes on and on and on. It's an enormous backstage. It's like an airfield hanger. It's just huge. See they have like, they're like, oh, that was part of a play that stopped running 10 years ago, but we just left it here and it's this enormous like fountain, like structure and they're like, we just don't know where to put it anyways. Then you see like a shed, it looks like a, um, like a storage unit and it's all locked up and you, you don't even pay attention to it. I'm like, you want to see this? And they open it. They're like, this was Frank Sinatra's room. And I'm like, what do you mean his room? And they go, well he didn't want to stay in the hotel and have to walk over here. So they built him

Speaker 2:          00:25:05       a room, Jeez. Backstage so that he could eat, sleep congregate. Right. And then walk out and be like basically on state. Crazy. I mean I can get that. Imagine being Frank Sinatra famous and walking through the hotel every night. Well I thought it was because people would, as I said, Oh yeah, cause he doesn't want people to see them. And they were like, no, no, because he didn't want to walk that far. Huh? Oh, I, yeah, I thought it was the same thing. Yeah. Him being so famous that people would stop him. But yeah, I guess not. Yeah, it was just a lazy piece of Shit. Yeah. They didn't phrase it that way. But yeah, I think he just wanted the convenience of it. Like, when's the show? Cool. I'll be here. I'll tell you that. That gives me so much anxiety. I, there's one club and I won't say where because I don't want to let everybody know where the comic sleeps, but there's one club where they put you up in the hotel. The club is in the hotel, and then your room is right behind the stage. There's a few of those terrible, really weird. Emotionally, mentally you need a break. They Cooper's not bad. The comedy mix, because that's in the basement of the hotel, but it's a nice hotel, you know? Oh, so we, yeah, but it's not, I'm talking about this club. They literally put you in the room that if you open the back door to the stage, there's your room. Oh No, I don't like that. I don't know. I did that one. Yeah, you have.

Speaker 5:          00:26:23       I have. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Now I remember too. Yeah. I did that once and then they asked me back and I go, guess what?

Speaker 2:          00:26:31       I'm not saying there though. Not saying they're able to revise that deal. Well, and what's crazy is that like really famous people have done that room and have stayed in that room and you're like, wait,

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       how is that possible that that room is also the green room? They're like, just go to your room.

Speaker 3:          00:26:51       Yeah. Cause there isn't an agreement. It's right. There's like a steps to the stage and then it's weird. Like this is not how show business works at all. Yeah. Pretty funny. But let's get to the importance that, I mean we'll, hold on, let me finish telling you the story man. And now I'm chomping at the bad

Speaker 5:          00:27:06       amazing crowd in Reno. I mean fucking crazy. It was 2,600 people in Reno. Yeah. I didn't know that many people lived in Reno. It was crazy. And then last night the Chenga, I did a Spanish word for pussy. That's right. We, let me, let me look. Your partner, what is Penecci Che? Yeah, that's different. But it sounds like by Chang is actually in the tribal name of that trial. In other words, they are something, the Chang is the Harry Pachangas. Yeah. So, but again, another beautiful place. They really have poured a ton of money into that place. I've seen the commercials, I've never been there really nice. It's really nice. Um, and uh, in a really, really great crowd. And uh, among, uh, Maria came, she was that last night. I made fun of her from the stage, you know, third, my show. First thing when I see up, she was like, oh, I saw, yeah, talk like I talk like that and I go, well, you do as you're doing right now.

Speaker 5:          00:28:10       She's like, I don't go like, aw, aw, you kind of do, it looks like really fast, like really fast. But I don't go like, ah, she says I do it, but then I point out, I don't just say, you go, ah, I just said, you're like, ah, I'll have to try to smoke a wet. Which she's like, I didn't say it. Like, ah. Anyway, she was there. My cousin Janette was there, both of their spouses. We had a great night. Uh, then we went out for dinner afterwards and had a great time. So anyways, this morning, normally if, if, uh, if they hadn't been there right after the show, I would've gotten my car and be like, I'm just gonna go back home. Right. Because it's about a two hour drive, maybe a little more. But since my sister's in town, which is rare, I go, well, we should have dinner.

Speaker 5:          00:29:01       It's like I'm going to spend the night because then, then it gets too late. So I get up this morning and I'm like, I got to get back. We got to do the podcast, you know, there's things to do. So I'm in the room and I'm like, when is this shit going to come? Hold on man. I'm finally, finally get to the part of the story that I care about. Okay. You said you had hotel coffee now is this, no, no, no. You're jumping ahead. Jumping ahead. Before I get there and you're saying let's go back. I haven't even gotten there yet. So I'm sitting there and I'm thinking, stupid. Huh? I'm thinking I got to get in my car and get back home. When is this dump going to? I know it's a, I go, is it going to come during this drive and ruined this drive from worse to is?

Speaker 5:          00:29:46       Yeah. So then I go, should I try to like, it's not ready to come. Should I try to force a dump out? You know, like, no, I know what I'll do. I'll make a little hotel room coffee and see if I can get the engine started. You know? So I brew it. I'm putting stuff in my bag and packing. I'm Kinda like, and then you know, you're thinking like, ah, how long is this drive going to take? Right. I have a sip and I'm like, you know, I could sit here for 15 minutes, drink this coffee and probably do this, but I don't want to wait 15 minutes right now and it's not ready.

Speaker 3:          00:30:15       No Ma marriage. Before we continue, may I give you my travel tip? And this is for the listeners, whenever you're traveling, go buy the Starbucks instant coffee. Go to Starbucks before your trip or aren't Amazon using our banner, your mom's House podcast out and you buy the instant packets. I'm telling you, that shit is white. It's brown lightning, you'll drink that and you're going to shit that shit that doesn't make you shit. Nothing. Well, and that's great for travel but, but continue. I should've given you some, that's what I was trying to say. I feel badly that did not. So anyway, so you're like, do I stay, sit here, finish this cup. Yeah. Now did you finish the whole no, no, no.

Speaker 5:          00:30:55       Is, that's what I'm saying. So I have a sip and I go, oh my God. Like I can feel the beginning like the oil getting grease, but it's not ready or do I go cause I want to go, I want to get back. Right. So I just go, fuck it. I'm leaving. I go downstairs, get the car and here's a big decision. I wasn't even a decision. It's actually kind of made for me. I got to put gas in the car and I go, is there a Starbucks or a coffee bean or someplace to get coffee for my drive back? I don't see one for the first half hour of the drive, which is really annoying. But then I realize that's actually doing me a favor because if I were drinking it, I would have to dump. So I actually right now I'm like, I don't know, 10 minutes from the house, two hours plus into this drive. And I realize, oh, it's a good thing I didn't find coffee. So I do find someone, I'm like uh, right around the corner from the house and as soon as I get in the house I say hi to you. Um, I have a couple sips of coffee and then boom, ready to go. And it was like a

Speaker 3:          00:32:05       nice for, that's interesting. What's interesting is that when I travel and I go to Barre stocks and I get a double tall a soy latte. Yeah. It doesn't make me shit anymore. It's not strong enough. Oh yeah. Cause that's, that's mostly soy milk. Double Tall. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It doesn't make me Brown. You got to, you got to go for the fire man. You've got to get some of this s espresso. Espresso. Yeah. Interesting. Interesting. Um, can I, can I share my story with you please? Sure. I mean you just go, oh, I'm moving like no, nobody else has a brown story to share as long as no one else is talking. Yeah. Oh well, okay. So anyways, last night I made eggplant and I ate a whole almost the whole egg plant to myself. Yeah. And then I went to sleep and I didn't have any farts all night, which for sure is like

Speaker 9:          00:32:59       excellent. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:33:03       Eggplants make me Fart so bad. Yeah, I know that for sure. And I didn't hit any kind of Florence and I was like concerned a little like what does that mean? It doesn't mean that like can you make your body immune? I don't think so. The farts? Yeah. No, cause I eat Brussel sprouts now and I don't really get as many fights as I used to in the beginning. So anyways, no, I'm serious. I think you can build a resistance to the food that gives you the farts and you get less parts over time. Yeah. So I'm having like no farts. And then this morning I drank my coffee and I took the biggest shit of my life. I mean it was so much and I thought, isn't that weird though that I didn't have any like very good, very good. Yay. But I didn't have any warning shots like there was not nothing.

Speaker 3:          00:33:49       What's your theory on this? Cause it sounds really interesting so far. That's your, uh, my theory is that I've grown it. You can build an immunity to flu. You're not having, you're not having that every day. Eggplant. So not every day, but I've had it enough to build an immunity. You know, it's like when you take a little bit of the poison every day, your body builds an immunity to it. Interesting. I don't know if I believe that, but I do know, I believe that in theory, I still believe that that theory applies here cause it's not like you're like constantly eating this stuff for you to build the immunity. I did enough. You think? So I do a Brussels sprouts to aunt dried apricot. It's those main used to make me feel really bad and they really don't do that anymore.

Speaker 9:          00:34:36       Okay. I'm in the shed. Okay. Yeah, there's a reason.

Speaker 3:          00:34:47       Well, I think I found out her reason. That's why she's in the shed cheese thing.

Speaker 9:          00:34:56       I have a bunch of girls here. If you see my writing other sites, you'll see there's suddenly all kinds of pictures of, of me and other girls and video's going to be showing up very short. Other girls. Yeah, we're taking videos and problems. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:35:14       Hear the rooster crowing. Um, what would it have taken for you to go down this path you think? Not a lot. Like how close could you have been to like, oh, there's videos on my site and you're just like, they're going to be up soon. It would be in some other girls. I have gas and then you turn it on, you fart into a camera. 2009 could have happened. He thinks that like had nothing picked out for us. Yeah. I mean we were looking at us. I wouldn't be with you if this was going on. I'm saying you're alone for sure. He wouldn't support me and my business venture. Definitely not. No, no, no. Well, I mean 2008 where we were at our brokenness, we have no money. Nearly married. I mean, this is easy money, dude. As far as I'm concerned, no, I think, no dude, easy

Speaker 5:          00:35:56       not married to this. My mock this on our podcast. I'm not married to it. You know how fucking I could do this and let's say 2007 instead of getting engaged, we break up a year later. Are you in a shed farting in my camera? Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:36:16       Possibly. Because look, when I married you, I mean I had just transitioned into being a fulltime fee track. I had no money and I leaned in on you and you know, we,

Speaker 5:          00:36:26       because of you, it been like, hey, pretty girl. You're thinking about other ways to make money and you're like, oh my God, no. Would you ever come by my shed this week? And uh, he, he's, he plenty of eggplant before you go over there where your Pajama bottoms too. That's a weird choice. The Pajama bottoms, she eats veggies.

Speaker 11:         00:36:46       Yeah,

Speaker 12:         00:36:47       that was all swollen. So yesterday I thought vegetables, some rooster is the best idea. She's a Christian, at least. Did you see her cross? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:37:02       Ah, it's such just mailing $100 to that far. I know.

Speaker 5:          00:37:05       How much do you think she can, but she's in the veggies just like you blonde big cans. Yeah. Just like you healthy diet guys.

Speaker 3:          00:37:13       I could do. I could so do it. It's really not a big,

Speaker 12:         00:37:16       okay. I'm going to go try to go back to the party and put half that and pictures of it. Yeah. I might be back though because I don't think this is real.

Speaker 5:          00:37:27       All of the cheeks got up on her tippy toes for that one. She got up. She was like, oh,

Speaker 3:          00:37:32       I wouldn't do it that way. I would make mine more playful the way king ass rapper does. I create more scenarios, more oopsies, different locations. The shed is not exciting to the viewer.

Speaker 5:          00:37:45       I don't like to shed that. She's out there making that like this. Uh, yeah. I don't like the shed aspect of it.

Speaker 1:          00:37:53       I know.

Speaker 12:         00:37:54       I like that.

Speaker 3:          00:37:56       That would be a little more fun about it.

Speaker 1:          00:37:58       Oh my [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          00:38:07       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:38:10       I know this. Can you believe it? Oh my gosh. I'm so embarrassed now and a response. We came up with a very serious topic discussion. We normally don't get the serious on the show. Uh, but we were wondering what do you call it when you have to dump, but only a fart comes out and we, how's that

Speaker 5:          00:38:32       big, big conversation started last week.

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       Um, a number of them came in here. Oh wait, can I glean from Twitter? Sure, sure. Okay. At Real Big Kong writes a no shit. But a fart should be called a Chanel shit and nope. Combo. All right, so again, just to make people clear on this shore, uh, we've said that when you think you're going to fart and you and you should, it's a shark. What about when you think you're going to shit and you only fart? Why isn't there a word for it? Right, right, right. Okay. Uh, this one is from at Garel be dumped. Fake Ghost Shit. Counter Shit. Charlatan. I like that one. That one a lot. Or imposter. That's funny. I'll strong suggestions. I like counter shit or charlatan. I'm kind of leaning towards short 10. Booster boosters are funny. Uh, okay. Just watch the latest episode. Mommy's, this is from at secret moves MMA.

Speaker 2:          00:39:38       What if the opposite of sharp was far, which also sounds like farce. Yeah, I mean, that's a suggestion. A food. I heard that one. That's not bad. Um, someone said there's a, uh, seduce a pseudo deuce. I said yes. At Chase Leopard rights. Uh, when you think you're going to shit and you only Fart, it's a Charlotte. It was pretty good. Yeah. Somebody said there's no word combos for this. It's just simply a solid fart. I just a disappointment. A Brown downer. Oh, I like a brick. Came in Rachel from Portland. Okay. When range. Yeah. Somebody calls it a Macbeth. I'm like that. Yeah. It is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing. Very good like that. Uh, moms, when you go to take your shit only turns out to be a tutor. It's called a shoot. Ah. Um, ah, uh, Tibbs said it's a poltergeist. Wow. I like that one a lot. Octo poos him spirit poop. Yeah. Uh, this one said you're not taking this shit home and you're frowning. Fart failed was brown frown. Yeah. That's Kate and the resident Fart gentlemen. Thank you for all your [inaudible] where I'm leaning. Yeah, I like pull pools or geist a lot. Charlatan. And I like imposter. That's really good.

Speaker 12:         00:41:12       It's really hot in here too, cause it's like the 90 outside today. Yeah. So I'm in a room, it's fed, closed all day. So yeah. How much money can she make? $50 a video to ruin your life. That's a thing. Is it really worth it is,

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       I think she, she might be pushing a little too hard at this point. I heard, cause I think she's gotten a few out. She's like, I gotta get a few more out in their bodies. Like, um, it's going to be a little extra on the end of this one that sounded like she's all winded. My work here is done.

Speaker 12:         00:42:03       Can you hear that tailbone? Oh God. It's like Rodenbach Lee. Yuck. Yuck.

Speaker 2:          00:42:20       I mean, how much could she make? Seriously?

Speaker 2:          00:42:26       I don't even $50 a video dude in this like, well no, because there's, there's gotta be multiple, you know, viewers, guys that, do you think they're paying, you don't think they're paying $50 each? It's a subscriber based. I don't know. I'm trying to guess like to figure out like if she's putting this up somewhere and she's obviously speaking to an audience, a group of people that are used to coming there, maybe they pay, I don't know, $10, $20 each. The demand to put out content. I mean, she's really gotta be farting every day, every other day. I'm rethinking being married to you if you're doing this. Now I'm thinking maybe this is a good idea. I'm thinking of the potential. What's the pros? Just the sheer volume. Yeah. Yeah. As long as we can get a, you know, a decent, uh, cause you're just the, uh, the upfront costs are just the food to make the fart.

Speaker 2:          00:43:21       No, what makes me far too, so there's the thing is no trial and error. 40 years of doing this. I mean, I've been in this game long enough. I know it works for me. What are you want to call the site fart mistress. Oh, that's probably taken. I'm sure I wanted to look Fart, mess, stress 40 cause then then I combined like the mill genre. Oh yeah. No, I mean wet fart mistress. Did you mean fart mistress? Mistress fart porn two mistresses, but there's not fart mistress.com is what I'm saying. Far Mres 40 yeah, cause then it combines taken and the FARC genre together. Right. I think that's smart marketing Tris, the farting MILF. That's another one from a marketing standpoint that no, I typed it in as a URL. No results for fart mistresses. Yeah. Hello? Yeah. Buy It up now. Well now someone's going to buy it. I believe we hadn't buyers for mistress. Bart mistress is here

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       now. How much content do I have to put out? Is it once a week or daily? Like how are these porn sites work? Tell me. I don't know. I don't know how that stuff works. Oh sure. I don't know how the uploading content you ask, you ask our friend Yoshi, he knows all that stuff. But I mean to keep my subscribers engaged and happy, I would think of at least a couple of week and then I had a tweet, the videos and, but then you're just giving it away for free. Right? All tastes see the whole thing. Well that's the thing that the teaser is the whole show pretty much. I mean, a Fart is humble. If we second could be, the teaser could be like, oh guys, ah, some big ones coming. That's what I worry about in that genre. Is it so limited creatively?

Speaker 3:          00:45:18       Like how many set up? Why don't we get more creative with it? But I mean, it's like, oh, I have to Fart so bad. Ah, like we need to really think of a way to reinvent the Fart, Mr Shaundra. That's true. I mean, what if it's an accidental thing? Like we set up these scenarios where like, I'm at jury duty and then I'm like, oh my God, Tom, I have to Fart so bad. I'm, I'm afraid to let it out. And you're like, just let it out and like I fart in public and stuff. Could that be a genre? Could be zone, right? Yeah, of course. What about the car fart where you, it's like a hot one and then you leave, you come back. It's still there. That kind of stuff. So you're getting more creative about done this other pole thing is that as you're doing that out there in the world, you know that a bunch of guys are enjoying it. You know,

Speaker 12:         00:46:05       can't look when you squeeze it all guests.

He's like a trainer that goes, uh hey, I saw you put your knees down, get back up there. Right. You know, so you definitely wouldn't come fast because he know. Yeah. Like I would have major control. You know what? Come to think of it. He should be like a concierge service. Like he, you should come to your house and teach you how to Rob Rob, because I lie, you won't come.

Speaker 3:          00:50:49       I think it would be mildly difficult to stay hard if he's sitting there looking at you like rob and you're like, um, dude, why? I can't really get it up right now. I can't believe you feel that way. Yeah. I think I would have a little bit of difficulty. Terrible. Yeah. The shot. I would take checks, but any day, especially on the penis now, would you rather have sex with him? No other option or you have to put shocks, whole foot in your coochie he's done. I mean, it would hurt, but I'd find a way why I squeezed a person out of there. I don't, why would you do that over that? Because that guy is so fucking gross. Dude. The Chinese case. The worst. That's the worst. Yeah. He's, he's a nasty pervert. He really is. Nasty program. You're so, and that guy at all. How about Stevens to goal or him?

Speaker 3:          00:51:45       Steven Seagal. Really? He's not that repugnant, sweaty, fat, older guy. He's not that bad. I mean, he's got that silly hair, but that's, you know, that's nothing. He's probably way more annoying. I have to listen to him talk about himself all day soon. I am the king of Improv for you. You want to deal with that? Yeah. So you all about sex. You think that guy's annoying about sex the moment you choose to call, he's going to be like, I've made more girls come in the last hundred and 20 even imagine and then he'll start doing like, wait a minute, let me, hold on. Let me just, uh, let me talk to you. A pussy food is nasty. It's both nasty, but I think they're amazing guys. Much more charming. Why is he the grossest I just, I'm not attracted to him at all. I just think he's Rose Rose. I don't like his, I actually can't believe you find him grosser than say, Oh yeah. Really know why. I think because the old Chinese guy could be like my granddad. I feel like he's too old. He's not that old. He's like your sweet old Chinese grandad. I don't like him. He's too nasty to talking. My jacket is deg and stuff. I don't want to hear that dad. Hey, you got to tell you something. I'm Pauley and I'm bi.

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       and I'm by audio issue with the podcast. Hey Hitler. I've noticed in the past few episodes that every time you say that you are playing a clip of someone puking or farting, I never actually hear someone puking or farting, but I'm even an even more obnoxious sound that turns out to be Christina's voice. It's a complete turnoff for me and I'm sure it is for others. Also after glass and through the Internet for hours trying to troubleshoot, I came across a webpage dedicated to this type of disturbing problem. It said that this issue is actually stems from a complete lack of personality is causing the audio interference in parentheses. Christina. This makes perfect sense. As Christina's personality is as dry as an old lady's vaccine in the Mojave desert, I suggest adding more of Tom's refreshing and sweet personality as well as his water champs skills to come patch, combat, Christina's obnoxious and embarrassing personality. Please fuck my triple d slot wife Kristen, Kansas. Well, Chris from Kansas, you can suck my tits. My ass. Yeah, tell him all about it. Well, I mean this is silly. This is silly. I think it's silly. Yeah, the whole thing is silly. I'm personality champ. I'm the world champ. Everybody knows. Oh, come on. Who brought the water to you today before the show? And by the way, you think you haven't even cracked your syrup. And that's true. Cause you're so fucking babe,

Anyways, I think that who posted this, this dude posted this video of, it's kind of like that. Um, what's it called when like the, like the, the court shows, you know, we're like, they confessed, the let the TV judge decide everything in Spanish. And this one was just out radius, but it's all in Spanish. But just to highlight that somebody said this on TV.

Speaker 3:          01:01:55       Okay. So you're fine.

Speaker 5:          01:02:02       So this lady with a studio audience is telling the judge, um, he told us to uncover our backsides and as we were still wearing those transparent ropes. Okay. Um, I was the fourth one down, right? Yeah. Okay. Yes.

Speaker 5:          01:02:35       and then out of nowhere I feel someone's tongue liking my bud.

Speaker 13:         01:02:38       Bye. Amy.

Speaker 5:          01:02:40       I tried to hit him, but he grabbed me and said I was ruining the ritual. Oh

Speaker 13:         01:03:05       Is there any factors in your practice?

Speaker 3:          01:03:09       It does it, yeah. So those guys, is that the same saying in Spanish tossing salad and that this is, why would they call that? Is there a route?

Speaker 5:          01:03:18       Praise. Uh, I think she said one here. She said it's okay.

Speaker 13:         01:03:23       I think I meant that.

Speaker 5:          01:03:26       That'd be so negative that the, I dunno, the, the black kiss, is that what she's saying? I don't know. I think that's what she said.

Speaker 3:          01:03:33       That's what it sounds. He's the guy.

Speaker 15:         01:03:37       Yum. You know, either yellow [inaudible] El [inaudible] son.

So he has this, he's bald, he's older, he's got this weird white shirt that has like no collar. Right? Like, and he's telling that the court now that dogs and cats heal themselves with their tongues, Jesus cured a blind man with his saliva. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:04:14       I never read that one, Gary. I know. Why the anus. Why? Because all the bad stuff comes from their true. True. Okay. Don't just, I get as flat

Speaker 5:          01:04:36       So he spits on their cans. It, why did you show that? Is it upsetting?

Speaker 3:          01:04:43       Yeah. I feel like so many things on your mom's house. It never phased me. That's like one of those things and it cause it's a holy man and he's taking advantage of people's religion. Well, he's not taking advantage of anyone. He's feeling people. I hate that. I hate that people trust him. It's so sad. Yes. Thanks for bumming me out. Well, maybe you'd want it to feel a little.

Speaker 15:         01:05:10       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:05:11       That's what I feel. All right. I like that these people were like, this is charge and they're like, okay, pull your pants down. Okay, now spread

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       your cheeks. Gotcha. Like what don't you be like, fuck you. I'm not pulling my pants down. Crazy train. I'm going to lick your ass for a minute and make you feel better. Right, but what you wouldn't protest at that level. Let me ask you this. I kind of feel like this is actually a great evidence for your honor's pace in getting you to kiss my, give me the black. Yes is a holy man's ploy cleans on the impurity. US. As you can see, this very spiritual man has cured many people by spitting in the healthiest of places. And I feel

Speaker 16:         01:05:55       that

Speaker 2:          01:05:57       counsel would best serve me back cleaning my bed.

Speaker 16:         01:06:03       Uh,

Speaker 2:          01:06:05       dirty evil. Oh, I think we should take you to a yoga class so that you can learn to lick your own butt hole. Okay. That is not what I signed up for. It was not what I want. Can I just take a rag on a stick and wet it and then mash it against your butt hole? I'd be like, that's my tongue. No, that's the same thing. It's the same thing. It's the same thing. What's, what's Mario saying? Maria just said, I challenge you and Bert to a water challenge. Okay. I will win. And if you want a bigger challenge, we can do a pull up, push up, post Tito's challenge and I'll still win. Love you. Hm. Well first of all, the water challenge wouldn't be with him. It'd be with you and me. That's the, she's not getting it. She doesn't get, she doesn't understand that.

Speaker 2:          01:06:52       No. Would you want to take her up on that challenge? No, because I've never been a showboat or like you are, will you? You guzzle a gallon and then own the water champ. It's not about that. It's about hydrating constantly throughout the day so that I don't need to binge. I understand. I'm a consistent, you're, you're, you're just, you're jumping ahead. Would you want to have a day long water challenge? I don't need the challenge. I know exactly who I am and I am the true champ. You don't want to compete in this. Why would I? Okay. To be the wind. What's the point to say who drinks the most or who drinks, who drinks the most in a day? Not a binge moment in a day. Okay, but that's the thing. It's like the, you're going to binge, you're going to push yourself day than you normally do.

Speaker 2:          01:07:37       I can drink it all day. Do you want to prove that you're the water champ by partaking in the competition with Maria or with you? With the two of us. So it's a threeway competition. What does, but what does she have to, she doesn't have anything to do with it. She's not a part of this thing. She's saying that she's the water champion and the and wants to dethrone us. I don't want to do this now. Why? Why? Why would I want, I don't like doing contests like you and Bert. I don't like putting myself through suffering for the point of what? No, I don't like it. I know why. I know in my heart who I am. I don't need to fucking compete. No. In my heart who I am, I already know that I am the champion. Why would I even need to compete?

Speaker 2:          01:08:17       Demean myself to base myself to compete with fucking peasants. You and Maria are jokes. You guys are fucking, you're not even in my league. Why would I compete with a dilettante drinkers? Okay. You guys are fucking Sunday drinkers, but this thing, I'll know this. When you say things like that, you can back it up with what you do. That's the whole point. Yeah. I've, I've, I know I'm hydrated. The doctor says I'm perfect. Everything's perfect. I've been to a urologist, they, the guy told me to stop drinking so much so you won't take place. Take Part in the competition? No, I don't believe, I don't like doing stuff like that. That's a fucking waste of my time. Okay. Um, I would like to accept Maria's challenge for the water drinking competition. Oh my God. What? When are you going to do this? Tomorrow. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:09:04       Or I dunno, the next day. Wait, what? Is that so weird to you? I mean, no, it just sounds like torture because you guys are just going to gorge and drink too much and it's going to be miserable. I don't have that kind of time right now. I got to do stuff, man. You don't have that kind of thing. No, I'm busy the next two weeks, you know, shooting my special, go to San Francisco. All right. I had to fucking go do shit tomorrow. I'll have time to, if I can do this. Yeah. But you know, you realize you're not allowed. Like when you say that you won't participate, you're not allowed to be part of the conversation. Great. But I mean, you're no longer even allowed to call yourself the water champion. That's fine. I know in my heart who I am. I'm secure with who I am. Yeah. Big l with what you are. It's fine. So be it. So be it. You guys have, I'm great at this. I don't need to compete. It's a silly, this is childish. I'm, I'm an adult. Your children.

Speaker 5:          01:09:57       Okay. All right. Um, speaking of great fun things. My, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:10:08       two sentences and I'm not sure it wasn't the same, but this is a major league baseball player reading his own mother's jokes

Speaker 5:          01:10:15       to, uh, to uh, uh, a teammate of his and

Speaker 2:          01:10:23       the teammates reaction is almost unbelievable. It actually feels like top dog is in the room.

Speaker 9:          01:10:29       It's Monday. We're going to do mom joke, Phillips and will Smith has a lot of corny jokes. So we're going to tell a few to Mr Breath. Philip. Sarah, see if we can't get them to laugh. So is there his mother's jokes? Okay. Why did the stadium get hot after the game? Because it was hot. Just like my dance left. Look at that guys lap because he fucking with him. I don't know.

Speaker 2:          01:11:02       I don't know. I think they're both, I think they're both, it's pretty funny.

Speaker 5:          01:11:07       I think this guy is, is questionable up top, you know? I don't think he's a all there. The guy on the left. Yeah. I think he's got real problems. Like maybe, maybe he used to play football before he played baseball and that kind of problem.

Speaker 9:          01:11:25       Yeah. That's so good. How'd you make an egg roll there? Push it like he's really, he thinks that's really funny.

Speaker 3:          01:11:37       You think so? I think he knows that one's corny. I think he does, but he's like, oh my gosh, this is good

Speaker 17:         01:11:45       money.

Speaker 9:          01:11:46       No, it's not pleasant. The bicycle fall over because they didn't have a peg. I was too tired. Your tires to get that way. I get it.

Speaker 3:          01:11:57       I think he's, I think he's really liked this touched. Yeah. A little bit. Sweet guy. But you know, were tarred. He got all the genes to play a sport. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then to think about anything else.

Speaker 3:          01:12:40       really thinks it's funny. I like, is it, it made me that there's so much more innocent than we are. Like they'd probably don't sit here and talk about, you know, farting and fist fucking coming all day long a week segments. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. These guys don't talk about the horrible things we do. They must be not as desensitized. Yeah. Is that what's going on? Uh, yeah. I mean this guy is probably a really sweet guy and uh, yeah, he's probably, I think it has a lot to do with the kindness of his heart is being nice. Yeah. I remember reading these jokes off a popsicle sticks when I was a child and I was, I still was like Wah, Wah. Like I never thought they were funny. It's an intelligence factor. It is. You think so? Of course. Yeah, of course it is. I don't know. Um, or you know, intelligence as in the real world experience. Yeah. Miss Street savvy. You know, he's not super smart.

Speaker 5:          01:13:32       He might be, I mean

Speaker 3:          01:13:35       this is for, what does the duck say to the bartender? Oh my God. Put It on my right

Speaker 5:          01:13:39       bill. Right. That's what I mean. Put It on my bill is

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       Right. That'd be so much easier. Watch sitcoms everyday. We can watch friends and think it was the best show ever. Amen. You see what Ross did? It was so funny he did that hand gesture and saying, okay,

Speaker 9:          01:14:24       fund will Smith and the snow will Smith. That's you put first fresh prince. He doesn't get it. He doesn't get it right. He's not that much. Huh? Dude, this guy.

Speaker 2:          01:14:44       Yeah, he's been hit with a ball in the head with a bat. Maybe a couple of what of his story is like, uh, this guy and when he was 15 was beaten relentlessly. Yeah. Is that brain damage? Somehow he was able to maintain his ability to play baseball. I was in a coma. He's in now we're shitting on him. Yeah. How do you know if you're in front of a Polish firing squad?

Speaker 17:         01:15:16       That's true. The guns are faced. If the, uh, your Dad die,

Speaker 2:          01:15:22       Dad, dad, do you not understand how these folks work? You're not supposed to actually try to answer them the best day ever. It was such a good day. Yeah. And we got them again here when I had them in studio guy. I loved those blinds. It was so weird to me that they lacked the hard, it's weird to me too, that she laughed. She laughed that hard. Well, I think your mom, I mean, you have to forgive her because she's working on a second language thing and yeah, that's really a cultural humor. Yeah. But I guess this is like when certain people, like certain comedians that you're like, that is so not on my radar. Yeah. Finding and you're like, why do you, why are people laughing? I don't, I don't get it. Jane, you remember this should be a roll call last week. I was trying to forget that.

I was hired two years ago at a large biotechnology seed corn company and we had a toned down version of the boy, a cult chant before taking the job. I spent seven months in Afghanistan getting shot at sometimes shooting back, sleeping and jacking off when again, when it came to my turn in the Sheboygan ceremonial ceremonial circle, I was zoning out and I froze and yell, Hey, my name is Andrew. Clap, clap, and I killed a man. It gets super quiet and they canceled the rest of the Ori till lunch. I do appreciate not having to attend these dog shit, retard festivals anymore. I to talk to HR a couple of times after that. I appreciate it, dude. I ain't tight.

Speaker 2:          01:17:14       Thanks Mommy. Andrew, do you realize that that dude's Improv in that moment ended their entire orientation that's effective? And do you realize that? I mean, cause that's an unconscious thing that should be [inaudible] experience was so traumatic that it unconsciously led him to think of his war days. Do you know what I mean? When he's like, there's nothing worse than this. Oh wait, Afghanistan. And also the fact that it's, um, chant like, you know, so you go to the same beat rhythm, so your brain goes into that kind of stream of consciousness. Yeah. And then he was like, what can I say about myself? I killed a guy anyway. Yeah. They're like, from my group stops. And then hands drew, are you guys gonna clap again? And they're like, oh, because you realize that some, someone there could have, could have thought also that, uh, that was a confession. Like he killed a civilian. Oh, right. Like I killed my roommate. What? Thank God. His body. Yeah. Oh, oh. Oh Lord. Yeah. Wow. I'm sure Afghanistan was better than this fucking shit. Thanks for your service, Andrew. And thanks for writing in. That is an amazing story. Actually. This Dad Boehner thing came in that, um, I actually find it to be more, it's one of these interesting, you know, sometimes you're like, yeah, that's pretty cool. It's, I don't know if you've seen this yet or not, but this is a dad boner.

Speaker 3:          01:23:35       This reminds me of, that's Bj boy butter by a San Francisco in the 90s this is exactly what we saw. Some wild shit. You told me once that you saw. Yes, there guys fucking in the streets. Just real crazy, but fucking each other all the time. Any two people fucking in the streets. It's crazy, but back then I feel like SF was way gay or and and wackier and more fun. Yeah. Now it's, yeah, upstairs like us to Douche bags, going to whole foods with their kids. It's a little different now that I don't love San Francisco guys. I'm not saying that, but it's just culturally very different since the dot commerce came. There's people like us now. It's not the Weirdo. They used to be a real beacon for weird beards. It was really fucking far out. It was really fun. Oh, I had the bed. We had the best time.

Speaker 3:          01:24:20       I mean, we just get on those Muni buses, get high smoke, drink beer, walk around Haight street. See fucking weird shit. You steers to be a guy that dressed up like Sherlock Holmes under the freeway and people would just be like, what's up Sherlock? Like he would just yell hi Sherlock. And he was, you know, there was a guy in a pink units hard on a fucking unicycle that was on Haight street all the time. Just the pink guy. I used to see him all the time. Woo Hoo, go, whew. I mean just, and they're always there. Just straight, weird, weird, all kinds of weird shit. Now it's, I don't know whether the Weirdos Weirdos are in Portland now, I think. I think Portland's the New San Francisco. See there's a lot of Weirdos in Portland. Yeah, they all kind of went for and there's a pride about it, which is interesting, which is awesome. Yeah. Fucking where they're at. I just pulled up this page thinking, you know, there's 400 episodes in neuro and we found this.

Speaker 1:          01:25:16       Oh Mom.

Speaker 3:          01:25:17       Yeah, that was great. That's from like a special edition episode of cops where they did a, I mean obviously the air on a regular episode that they put it on like a best of type of cops tape and it was a random youtube fine going away. It's gone. Shut up. Yeah, it's not there anymore. I mean we were randomly watching it and then we were like, wait, what did that guy just said it doesn't he sound like say my mom's house and we're, you know, it's like the early days of your mom's house. Like how perfect is it that it's like a weird thing cause we like playing weird segment audio and this guy's like,

Speaker 1:          01:25:51       oh mom,

Speaker 3:          01:25:52       my mom's house. And then our first sponsor of this show with stamps.com and then this guy says,

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       so then we would be like, this episode is brought to you by [inaudible] dot com and then if we win, we want you to use our, our website shop through the Amazon banner. Check out the clips, see where you can see us live. Go to our web.

Speaker 19:         01:26:21       I'm Bob, I'm a Martian

Speaker 2:          01:26:24       as the websites ww,

Speaker 19:         01:26:31       the best.

Speaker 2:          01:26:32       It's not in, this is the cops with him because when they're like, how are you doing today, sir? Uh, what, what you doing out here?

Speaker 19:         01:26:40       Um, mom,

Speaker 2:          01:26:41       sorry. Okay, go ahead and give me that license in a registration for you. And then he goes, uh, you have, uh, you have, uh, anything to drink today while you're sitting down. You're gonna have anything to drink.

Speaker 19:         01:26:54       I'm Bob [inaudible], I'm a Marshall. I'd

Speaker 2:          01:26:58       go ahead and do me a favor. Turn off that car. Just step out for a second. Like that's the guy stays like, so like treats him like he's actually speaking English back to like a toddler. Me a favor. Go ahead and turn that off. And the step out for me and they're look like that this guy is definitely coming with, that's gotta be the hardest part of law enforcement, which is the majority of law enforcement. You're just like, sir, sir, could you step out of the car? Just be normal. Like the guy actually said something. Sure. So battling, you have the registration, the registration on you right now?

Speaker 2:          01:27:34       Yeah, it's lent. Um, anyways, it's been crazy. I tell people this at live shows, I say it all the time when they go, you know, I listen to the podcast, I love it. And that's, you know, that's why they come out. This is the most fun thing we do is do this podcast because it's really, it really is all the stupid shit that you and I have enjoyed over the years. And it's all about silly and it's great because we come in here and we see all the world, everything is sealed off and it's just talking about stuff we really, truly care about new way. Genuinely. I want to say, uh, we do appreciate everybody that listens to the show, downloads the show and tells us that they enjoy it. The help site all the time. It sounds like really goofy to say almost, right?

Speaker 2:          01:28:19       But people are like, oh, it helps me get through my work day, or it helps us a good distraction from whatever mundane thing I'm doing. You know, I never, we never expected anybody would say that. And I think it's, uh, it's very cool that people enjoy it like that. It overwhelms me at times when we do the show live or I go do standup and all the mommies show up and you're just like, this is crazy crazy. This started just out of us talking about farts and shit like that that we normally would talk about and to think that it's really touched the lives of so many people. So silly. The House that far it's built. So anyways, we're gonna, you know, there's no, there's no sign of us down with this.

Speaker 5:          01:29:02       Um, we're going to be having, like I said, we've had guests lately. We're bringing some, we have guests lined up coming up, some episodes, we'll have them, some won't, but there's, you know, it's one of the most fun things we do. So there's no way we would slip, slow down or stop doing this 400 and hopefully 4,000 more. Um, that's it man.

Speaker 3:          01:29:22       Oh, um, I don't know. We were wanting to do a glossary of terms from your mind. Somebody start that already. I don't know. But if I know the Facebook page, you guys do that, can someone started glossary or maybe a Wikipedia page of all the terms are some localized place that fans can go, you know, there's gotta be someone who's in charge of all of these things.

Speaker 5:          01:29:43       There you go. And a, I know we said it at the top, but obviously, uh, go to thousand ranch.com for tickets to the San Francisco shows and uh, the link for Christina Seattle special taping that's coming up in just a couple of weeks.
