Speaker 3:          00:05:18       Oh my goodness. I wasn't expecting that.

Speaker 1:          00:05:25       Don't bring it in one. Loving to them. Go to your mom's house, Christina visits.

Speaker 2:          00:05:57       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:06:18       My girlfriend Christiane Amanpour girlfriend and my dad. Is that possible? We need to be, my joke was that I'm pause. My girlfriend. You Love Christianne I'm a Mama, Mama, Mama Mama part. I do. I do. I think she's your older lady attraction. She's your Freebie. You know why I want to have dinner with one, not like pick her brain. Just have, you know, yeah. As I want to ask her questions about and you know what? I'd let you give her the d babe. It's easier. You're free. That's my hall pass. It's your hall pass. I'll take it. She's Rad dude. She is red. Yeah. Smart attracted her. You just, you just told her that I'm allowed to fuck her.

Speaker 3:          00:07:08       That's what she did when she heard that. You know what I like about her too is that she's got old school teeth. She's got his old world teeth. Like she didn't, she didn't Jack them up with veneers. Boy Do we have a dental update? Oh my God, there's so much to cover. First of all, we have to tell people, and this is all on me, I got, we get emails every day and messages everyday about people asking for access to old episodes and a long time ago, I don't remember why, but we put like a lock limit for iTunes to I think the past, the the most recent 100 and really didn't think much of it. We just go like, okay, that's what it is. But every day people go, how can I get other episodes? And I see that so much that today I was like, Hey, will you unlock?

Speaker 3:          00:07:58       Just put no limit on them. And you're like, okay, sure dude, I don't know if you've checked your feet, have not. Oh, it's been like Holy Shit. Why did I just get 150 episodes died? The subscribers, I want people to know that the intentions were to say, here you go. Yeah, I'm trying to, we're trying to give them for free for free and easy access. Yeah. I didn't consider it. I thought it was like a cool thing that you'd be like, oh great, I can sit anywhere. Because it would show up in the subscriber feeds like their, so like their phones are full pick and choose the ones you like. But anyways, now once you situate that, it's uh, it's so that you can listen to them at anytime. Yeah. So the back catalog starts at episode 40. The reason being, the first 39 we did with the original red band.

Speaker 3:          00:08:51       Yeah. In his studio. And then we moved the studio to our own home. Yeah. And so it started to episode 40. So that's, but, and then I don't know if they're in chronological order on, on the Lipson feed for some reason. I don't know how to control that, but yeah. I don't know either or not chronologically ordered, but they're all there now and they're on our, uh, libsin page. Uh, if you want to go, go just Google your mom's house RSS. Yeah. And it'll come up all the back catalog anyways. It's, um, that is so funny. Yeah. Sorry guys. It's so annoying. It's really annoying to you. I'm sorry. There's so many pushes around your presidential campaign on both sides that they prefer not to comment.

Speaker 7:          00:09:32       Lick Kublai Khan.

Speaker 3:          00:09:36       I hate that woman. Yeah. She's really aggressive. She's really, really sad about this woman. Oh yeah, them, I wasn't talking to you now. That's positive. Grab 'em by the Pussy. Oh yeah. Grab 'em by the Pussy. Or there's this Ding Dong floating around. This woman who's like it, Donald Trump, he forced himself on me. I was a contestant for Miss Universe and I liked it. Oh, I liked it. We seen her. She's, no, she said bud there. That does also have to exist. Yeah. Because the reason that a guy in a power thinks he can do that is because he's done it a few times. Yeah. And a few times it was reciprocated as like, that's awesome. No pushback. So then they go like, oh, just do that to everybody. And that's usually from dump dummies. Yeah. But I'm just saying maybe she does. That might be the highlight of her life.

Speaker 3:          00:10:24       She, she could be a star fucker who's like, that was amazing. This is actually heard. This is the girl from seeing it. Oh yeah. It was a shocking thing. And now there you go. Is that Christiana? Um, important. Yeah. I love it. This guy doesn't know exactly like he's Rad. He's like, trying to say is like, there's a lot of pussies everywhere. It's Rad. That is your dad was essential dumping. I've heard him say sentences like that. You realize the Russians think we're just the ultimate, oh yeah. Sissy. Nancy boys. Oh, you were so weak to that. I think Obama is so weird to them. You know what, smiling and last month. Yeah. Joy. Joyous. Smiling. Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:11:06       Money.

Speaker 3:          00:11:07       Yeah. For pussies. Yeah, that's true. Oh, relatives would think you're a dope if you smiled. Cause a reason, another thing to point out before we go, that was a burp in my throat because, does that sound horrible? Yeah. It was like one of those things. And you're like the, the bubble bursts here. I know. I've had that happen.

Speaker 8:          00:11:37       I missed that.

Speaker 3:          00:11:38       If you're new to the show, big announcements only happen. Major announcements after chips have been poured into a bowl. Right. And we got that from the morning radio shows that they usually play. Bugles you know, like, I've never heard, I've never heard it referred to as abuse. I think a horn horn.

Speaker 8:          00:12:03       Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:12:04       Stupid. No, it's so dumb. Fucking dumbest thing. So down. So our version of the morning radio show his chips in a bowl. Yeah. Uh, chips in a bowl. Cat's eating kibble. I like the cat and this is a big chips in a bowl announcement. Okay. Okay. Are you ready? Jeans? I'm ready.

Some of these, uh, cities I will not add shows. Some of the venues are big and I'm just trying to get them, but if they fill up, they're gone. So I'm really excited. I've never done a theater tour. Most of these are our theaters. There's only a couple clubs. Uh, and by the way, I also wanted to do this during the episode and explain this part. I know I'm going to get hit up for cities that aren't there and I'm there. You're not being left out. It's just not part of the initial frame of marketing for the tour. For instance, Denver, you know, I love Denver. Um, it's just not going to happen in those first few months. But Denver is definitely going to happen in 2017, uh, things like that.

Speaker 4:          00:14:02       So I just wanted to point that out. Um, and also still get the tweets though. I know Joe Coming Hawaiian. I'm definitely going to Hawaii. A cone to there.

So there's going to be Canadia um, I'm working on a u UK thing and working on mom's strail. Yeah. So these are all things I'm trying to do anyways. We'll move on, but I wanted to tell everybody that's a big, that's a big deal for me. Big Announcement and a that's why you got so many chips in your bowl jeans.

Speaker 3:          00:14:35       I thought you were going to announce that you're lactose intolerant. My God, I'm shrimp and tolerant. Can I, I think, can I tell you what it might be? Hmm. Cause didn't you eat some of my cheese before? Yeah, the shrimps. So maybe the, the cheese was pushed out by the shrimp. I got tested though. I actually don't have a food allergy. Um, I got negative on everything they said. Maybe a food set sensitivity, which is different. Okay. Um, and I also have to push my colonoscopy. We didn't turn that light on that light. Oh, that's a problem, huh? I'll turn it off. Is it plugged in? Yeah. Oh, I dunno. It's Kinda important. No anything. Just do it. Okay. Don't pause. Keep talking, talking. Oh, you'll do that and I'll do that. Oh, here's my theory with you because we both just had shrimp that I made at home. Yeah. So I feel fine. And then you shoot your brains out. And I heard it through the bathroom

Speaker 9:          00:15:33       door. What's wrong booboo? Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:15:40       But then we had that Starbucks, uh, protein plate. But you don't think that's better? That's better. You don't think you're lactose at all? I'm saying they tested me that for that. And you're not? Yeah. Oh, now I know I'm not fun. I don't like milk. I hate no god. If I drank milk, I'll feel sick. But I don't actually have that 23 and me shit that we did or whatever the fuck that genetic thing was, says that we are both lactose dollar. I Dunno, man. Here's why I'm not going on the 27th because I have to fly to New York now. Oh, look at that excuse after I'm doing Ron Bennington. Unmask. If you're in New York, it's free to go to the 27th I think so. Is that, do we know? I don't know yet. They made an announcement so I know I can talk about it.

Speaker 3:          00:16:30       Anyway, the lactose thing, that's, you know, genetic. Yeah. Why are you shitting after shrimp? That's a term sensitivity. That's so weird. I don't know something's wrong. Why is that dog barking so crazy. Retarded. She's so fucking retarded. So stupid. She got diarrhea again. So our baby got sick for the first time ever. I mean 10 months old. Our baby got his first fever. It was a fucking nightmare because of course you were out of town, so I deal with this all alone as usual, and then the fucking dog gets diarrhea on top of the kid being sick. I'm like, God, I wanted to blow my brains out. This new dog doesn't stop barking though. It really makes me want to blow my brains out and they continue to bark. Yeah. And then you go and see what they're looking at and there there's nothing. It really makes sure she barks it. Absolutely not. I know. Like right now she's so fired up. What could that be? The squirrel outside. It could be someone. It's, it's gonna. It's gonna make me go get her. The only other option is to have her in the room with you.

Speaker 9:          00:17:34       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:17:35       To go get her. Okay. Keep talking. Oh, for fuck sake. I have to vamp now. Yeah. Oh, for crying out loud. So, okay, fine. The kid was sick for the first time in 10 months. That's the

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       story. This is our life at your mom's house. I can't wait to get a new studio that's separate from the house and the place we're moving to. It's going to be way different than this. Anyways, I the kids sick. I'm in a fucking lather. I don't know if you have babies, but the first time your baby gets sick, at least for me, put me in a full panic. A full lather. I mean I was having like severe anxiety attacks. Fee's been shitting in my closet this week. Hi. Um, so yeah, I wake up at two in the morning and bitsy has diarrhea. 4:00 AM she has diarrhea. It was a nightmare. I had to shove Imodium down her throat because the vet told us we could and then it stopped. But man, what a fun week at Casa Segora. Baby's sick dogs sick. Everybody's sick except you and me.

Speaker 5:          00:18:37       Thank God. Now you got sick. You just shit. What, what was she barking at? She was just at the gate just barking at it. At the gate from the kitchen. The kitchen get, where's the cluster? I think she's in there, but she was just barking at the gate we need in the baby gate. Yeah. Yeah. The dog just barks it. Nothing nonsense. And she was really intensely barking yet. I think it's her way of saying I want to come up there with you. She got her wish and then Fifo has shit in my closet twice. Two Times in the last 48 hours. Not Cool. Not Cool. Because he's sending a very direct message though my feet. What is it? I love you still. I can't let you up right now. I'm working. Okay. Come on. Come sit in my lap. So he knows that something's been up in the house with the baby and he needs attention. Look at this. This is hilarious. Me. Okay. FIFA. Roney okay. Pepper. Tony. Okay. Can't alone.

Talk to you soon. Bye. Wow, it's Ali, uh, Shabani. Thank you. Um, I wrote this, I go, man, this is unbelievable to slay him. And he said, of course she doesn't really complete her thoughts there. So choppy. What is most shocking is she uses a really vulgar language, especially for an older person.

Speaker 4:          00:22:28       And while the curse words translate literally to whore bitch the words in Farsi or really vulgar, like she says, cost cast, which you guys caught onto it. It was a bad word. It, it literally translates to pussy stretcher. Hey, k a whore. I'm just curious who is ripping her off? Last time was about real estate. The time passport in pictures. She is nuts. Interesting. Yeah. Anyways, thank you guys for the translations. Salah Amaze. Pretty stoked that she's not getting all of these voicemails. I hope I want Sallie Mae to get a bank of voicemails. Like everybody just got our downloaded episode, you know, I want to sell him on his phone to get them at once and she gets 40 fucking voicemail and that's your really gets to know her friend. You know, I don't think it's her friend. I think solo may is a family member.

Speaker 4:          00:23:17       Yeah. At this older woman or a daughter or it's somebody. It's a family. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. I Dunno man. I'm, I'm upset. She called my phone the other day, the Persian lady and then didn't leave a voicemail and I was so excited for the voicemail. Yeah. Sometimes she doesn't leave one. Yeah, she doesn't. I know that that was really rare though. When you told me that she was calling, I go, oh, is so excited. Yeah. What are you looking at? Me? Just what you sent. I'm been trying to figure out what the play, um, because you said some great stuff. Oh, I also wanted to point this out. I was talking to you about this. I did a Burt cast with Bert Bertrand, yeah. And Wilfred Burr. And we were, you know, just regular podcast talking. I told this story about this lady I know a friend of mine knows works with someone who blew the Wu Tang clan and she's not happy about it now, but at the time she voluntarily did it.

Speaker 4:          00:24:21       Anyways, I tell the story and to summarize, my friend works at a music venue and one time when the Wu Tang clan came to play there, a lady he was working with was like, I'm going to get on that bus. I'm going to like suck and fuck some Wu Tang. She vault. She goes, she announced it. I would love to blow everybody in the Wu Tang. And um, he was like, are you sure you want to do that? You know? And she goes, gosh, that's like a perfect idea. And she was like, yeah, I want to do it. And he goes, you know, it's like, it's Kinda like that, um, that's how he was being a protective friend, but a woman's, yeah. Killed Square, but a woman's choice, you know, she, he was, he was being supportive. You're sure live right. You're supposed to be a slide. So anyways, she says yes.

Speaker 4:          00:25:12       She goes on the bus, she's in there for a while, comes back, and pretty soon thereafter, you know, she's, uh, she's gets emotional. And then she goes, you know, that was pretty terrible. He's like, well, what happened? She's like, you know, I blew all of them. And, and uh, and she, she said, and he goes like, you know, they hurt you or you, and she was like, no, it was just, they were just so mean, you know? Oh yeah. You think that the members of the Wu Tang clan would be savages. That's weird. I know. So anyways, she was, she thought she was blowing, I think she was going to blow Joe to see or something, you know, the grateful dead night. Nice guys, hippie guys. If she had blown the Tom Tang clan totally different because I'm the type of person that would be just like, thank you.

Speaker 4:          00:26:01       Thank you. Thank you. Of course, that's my philosophy. Of course you're talking about, don't forget on the groundbreaking first we'd hang out and through the 36 chambers, there's a sketch and interstitial between songs that goes, uh, you know, I'm a cut your eyelids off and feed you nothing but sleeping pills. Uh, I'll show your asshole close and keep feeding you and feeding and feeding. And that's between. So guys that improvise that I imagined when they're getting their dick suck can also improvise some things, a couple of lines here and there. You know, I got your back, but your best to watch your front because it's the Niggas who front, that'd be polling stations. Wow. That's very, very accurate and very, and that's also, that's a Jesus album. That's like that. That's great advice. Now those guys, like you pointed out, also talk about blasting the whole head.

Speaker 4:          00:26:53       Fucking blown out on it. Yeah. Right. So there's also nine of them. I mean recipes, uh, 14 nine's the original number. So, you know, sweet baby Jesus. I made a couple jokes telling that story to Burt and Burger. I told him, I was like, she was probably like, Oh man, even you got, and like I got a blow Kappa Donna too. Like you know, it's like almost, you know, caps not even original, but you know what I mean, like the not as famous members. Anyways, that's the story. She got really emotional because they were real mean. And then later on she was kind of, I think the next day like, I dunno, inconsolable, right to the point where my friend asked like, do I need to call? Like do I need to, I think I told them too like that in the story, but I need to call the authorities implying it was there a crime committed and she was the one that said, oh, I volunteered for this.

Speaker 4:          00:27:51       But it was awful. I could, if I could have told her that before. Well anyways, I think this is hilarious. Okay. And I laughed a lot telling the story because it makes me laugh to think of how mean they could have been like, I imagine ghost face killer can say some really fucked up shit. I Bet Ray Quan was probably eating as he was getting his dick sucked and then like food felt like he was probably eating. Yeah. Yeah. Or like a McFlurry and then it fell on her head and he was like dancing for you. Like you eat dick juice, no ice cream. Ice Cream off of her forehead and eats it still. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So shit like that. You know, let's go sit right there. You know, he probably suck my Dick. You don't want me, you know? Well, like I said, this isn't like, um, you know, this isn't a Yani, you're not blowing a full band.

Speaker 4:          00:28:52       No Man, they're, they're known to be savage and sure. I mean like even if I made that offer to like modest mouse or something that's going to be like, oh thanks for a second. Our dicks, you know, they weren't, they, I think they would be the 12 year old picture. That guy again, his dick sucked. Right. So anyways, this shit made me laugh. I tell a story. This made it to the front page of Reddit. My Buddy [inaudible] Greg pointed out to me and then I was reading it and it has the full variety, but some people were like, sorry, I don't think sexual assault is funny. It's not a salt if it's consensual. Of course it was consensual to the point. And also it just shows you people are always looking to, you know, get their agenda out there. That even in the story,

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       like I'm telling the story with notes now, but when I told the story originally, I told that with the details of this person volunteering and making it clear that it was consensual, but there's still people saying like, no, no, no. The only reason they're saying that stuff is because of this Trump thing and it's in the air and it's, it's like a topic hot topic or whatever. Yes, please. It's so dumb. It is dumb stupid. Let's say if you're stupid enough to want to blow the Wu Tang clan in the first place. I mean, of course it's going to feel bad, sweetie. Yeah. You think you think it absolutely is going to feel bad? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:30:20       Cause there's like tape there and there's no duck tape and the Lutein, is that the, the last member duck tape. That's the guy he hasn't gotten out yet. Hurry drives cabs now. Anyways. Um, just to make it clear, there was not even, there was such a clear point made that this wasn't, um, sexual assault, obviously. I know, but I just feel like stupid. And Look, I've known you for a million years. You're the least sexual pro sexual assault. Personally. God Love Planet. I guarantee it wasn't intended that way. Of course, look dumb. You know, people get their panties in a bunch over Trump and now they're transferring all that energy to you. Yeah, it's stupid. Anyways, which band would you blow? Hmm, good question. That's a new game. I mean, first of all, I would look for a band that has less than nine members. I mean, she went for a week, highest amount of decks.

Speaker 3:          00:31:21       Awesome. Now that's a really interesting point. Topic. You think about it. Would you want nine different guys to not in your mouth period. No one sitting. I think this was somebody too much come. I think also that that this lady was thinking about it was too much because that's a really good point too. I think she, it's too much. Do you think she underestimated the, the number of members in the band and that's why it was such a bummer. I think she may have been watching honestly some videos and been like, oh, this will be like, like look at, look at all the fun people are having, you know, that's the porno. Like, like she's watching like, oh, everyone's like the affection. Yeah. Like this is what a thrill this is for everybody. Yeah. And then you get in there and you're playing with the big boys, you're playing the major league ball and then all of a sudden it's like some a rapper sitting on your face.

Speaker 11:         00:32:17       Blake. My ass, my ass. And,

Speaker 3:          00:32:22       and, and in all sincerity as a woman, I don't, I don't think I could think of a band. I would least want to blow all the movers up when you, first of all, there's nine guys minimum mine minimum. No. Yeah. Yes. And it's not like it's not the peace and love music party. It's, it's, it's the Blue Tang. It's pretty much, I'm trying to think if there's ever a modest mouse. They'd be a good choice. Maybe like a depressive band play radio head. They be great to blow. Maybe like a solo act, folk singer and just a guy in a guitar. Adele. Hello? One singer sting. He's all tantric though. He'd be like, you're gonna blow me for 16 that's where he's the, he's a master. He does yoga. Did you know that Mick Jagger or we talked about this, didn't we on Joe Rogan show that he does yoga too.

Speaker 3:          00:33:28       He's in such good shape. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You want to blow up. You don't want to blow the older guys. That takes forever. Forget it. Just to get the blood down there. That's what I'm saying. You want to blow the young buck, the 20 the Biebers of the world. What are the quick one of those guys? The boy band one direction. One direction. How many are in that spit on those little dicks? I think there are four. But like they're going to come quick. That's the whole point. You're going to come to many guys and what? You're going to touch their dicks and as you grab him, you're going to go, you know it's going to be fast. I wouldn't want to blow like a heavy metal, like Metallica guys stink. Right? Dick smell bad on the balls would be, that's the name. Now, some of those bands, they started off as like the stinky dicks.

Speaker 3:          00:34:19       Right. And then later on when they got signed, they change it to Metallica, you know? But they're their first band names. Like I never wash my ass. Got to be so nasty, so nasty all the time. Yeah. Yeah. But I wouldn't, yeah, I wouldn't blow a metal band and I would not do a blue Tang for sure. Not, not a good choice. No. That's an intense move to start off doing that. You know, for your first, is that called a blow bang? Yeah. And I mean like even for a group, you're like a girl who was like, you know what, I want to like more power to you. But to start with the Wu Tang clan, that's a really aggressive varsity move. You want to start off slow. Maybe you start with a solo artist, you know, Wiz Khalifa. Just go somebody who just, he's alone, you know, maybe him and a Dj would have been a good one. Hmm. Hanson Hansen. Yeah. Two teenage brothers, Jonas brothers. And they were brothers. One of them now. So though, right? This isn't one of them still perform or something back in, who knows? But yeah, to be like, let me start off with these nine dudes. These nine hardcore rappers sing about murder or rap about murder.

Speaker 3:          00:35:33       That's why he makes me laugh. It's really funny. I think it's funny.

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       I agree with you a man. Anyways, also, thank you. Many thanks. Can I tell you that Charlotte, North Carolina, some of the most fun shows I have all year, they don't know this, but they helped me build about a new 10 minutes this weekend. Great. Um, which was really, really fun. And also Carlos Valencia was my opening act there. Really great guy. And um, he's a Columbian. I don't know if you know what I'm drinking out of my own personalized main mommy water container. I see that. Yeah. It's embarrassing that you have that. Um, it's good. It's refreshing. Where's your water? Smooth. Refreshing drink. Where's your water? It's not water. That is a sparkling water essence drink called liquid. No sodium, no sugars by sailor water. Do you know that Kevin Christie hates those [inaudible] he said at the, it sounds exciting and then you drink it and it, it does taste like nothing.

Speaker 4:          00:36:44       Well, Kevin Christie, um, is, is talking like a person who eats and drinks what he wants. And honestly, if you had the choice of a liquid or something with sugar, you probably do want the sugar. But when you cut sugar out of your life, this is the best it can be. Or you're 40 and you can't have soda anymore. No, that's what I'm saying, man. Yeah, you can't do it. Yeah, I can't do it, man. You shouldn't do it. I can't do it. So I a blue band, as you guys know, he's still with us, but he's not here. He's doing, he's building nests and all these different trees across the city and I asked him to pull these for us. Jeans. Yeah. Um, some great pss. I love always loved Psa. Some of these are really amazing. I haven't seen them all. I've only seen a couple, but I wanted to show you how they from the 80s.

Speaker 4:          00:37:44       Those were my favorite ones. The old ones are the best. The old ones, you know why they don't pull any punches. That's wow. Yeah. Did you stop? Drop and roll also? I remember just making an observation to our, our youtube viewers. You're still seeing the old board. I ordered an actual another board. That's why it hasn't been replaced because people message me things I thought of. You've got a new board. Oh, I did get a new board and I got another board. I got to send back the second board. That's the story. Okay. All right. Here we go. Jeans.

Right, of course. Thank you. I like, ah, family times, whatever family size is over. Of course. [inaudible] and you're like, can we watch the other show out?

The Brits don't fuck around. Are these all Brits? Oh yeah. Right. Yeah. They do things a little harsher. Yeah. They don't fuck around. Little bit more direct. I remember there was a campaign about um, like loose lips sink ships during the war and just those like posters they tell you like basically if you blab secrets, you're murdering your countrymen.

Speaker 3:          00:42:34       Sure. That, well I know that the, you know, they don't like stuff like a have a nice day. I've heard that a bunch of English people. Yeah. They, they think that that's so, um, condescending. Definitely Eastern blockers don't like that shit. Oh, I know. I know a certain person in your life was not a fan of that at all. My step mom hated. Have a nice day. Or how you doing phone Edith to my mother really hated having nice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's really funny to me cause you know what, to me, I never thought one way or the other about it. Like I never said it. It's not my partying way of, you know, I don't, it's not an expression I part with, but it also never really registered. But it's really funny to me to think about it bothering somebody. You know what infuriates me? Mm. And this is totally irrational, but good morning. Good morning. I absolutely, I don't know why I've made cause I'm grumpy when I wake up. I fucking hate it. Good morning. Oh fuck off. It's that stop. You know we actually had um, a drop. Do you remember Carla? My name's Carla. 24. Seven. Carla haven't good fucking day. She said you have a good fucking night. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:43:55       I don't know where that is. My mother would say that to people. You'll have that good fucking day. How did you know that one? Did you hear her say that? Um, I think you told me that once and I left for an entire day straight because cause we were just talking about like the wild shit. She would say. Yeah. Cause your mom, the first time I met your mom was that a lunch? And she said the first thing she talked about was a content Bloomingdale's. Yeah. She said this fucking content Bloomingdale's. And I was like, whoa. And I just, I mean, I was ear to ear smiles, but I was also

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       like, she just opened up with, there was a context. Yeah, yeah, yeah. She doesn't, shouldn't build up to it. You know, she reminds me of actually this last voicemail from Persian lady. Very similar to the email. The voicemails I would receive like the conspiracies. The so-and-so's out to fuck me. I got to get this person back. Yeah. Super, super normal stuff. Yeah. You have a good [inaudible]. You'll have a nice fucking day. No, she wrote that to me. Yeah, she did my mother. That's why I wrote it to you in an in a letter in the mail. This was how crazy. Now that she's dead.

Speaker 5:          00:45:11       Sorry. So hard because it's outrageous. Can I tell a story? Why are so of course, so my parent, my mother remarried to this nice. My Stepdad, this nice Indian guy, right? They divorce and I decided to write my former stepfather an email just to say, you know, hey, I know things went south with you and my mom. I just want to say thanks for being a cool step dad. For 17 years. You were in my life and uh, thanks for being you keep, you could have been a Douche bag and you weren't right. She checked his emails, found the email, printed it out, and then on the letter, the printed email wrote, have a nice fucking day and mailed it to me in the mail. Like I caught you. I caught you. Caught me being nice to the man. That was my stepdad for 17 it was not a normal reaction. Oh, really? Know what part wasn't normal of that has changed. That's when she loves, it's horrible. It's real crazy. Oh yeah. Super Fun to be on the receiving end of that from your own mom.

Speaker 14:         00:46:19       No, you'll have, this is burger king. I'm sorry ma'am. You can go in and say, okay, Miss Carla, Miss Bitch,

Speaker 5:          00:47:12       but you would have a good fucking night. My name is Carla all day and I ain't ashamed of it. Why would should be ashamed. Whoo. That's some good stuff, man. Shit, we kiss my pussy too. That was that. Probably one of my

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       favorite major jobs. Yeah, I know. There's so many. Yeah, watch. I'll profanity old school. Um, but it was kind of a sip. You're lacroix. Oh, why would you want that? Well, I like to switch up. My water intakes varied. There's suck my pussy. Here we go. Thanks mom. You can suck on that.

Speaker 15:         00:48:01       Uh, no.

Speaker 14:         00:48:03       Oh Man.

Speaker 4:          00:48:08       Yeah, there you go. That's it. Good old classics. Good stuff, man. Uh, yeah. My mom was also very racist to your mom was talking about this on the show yet. I don't think you've talked about on the show, but um, yeah, I heard, I heard that at that first, first, first lunch. Like she didn't even do that. Like, let me gauge how you feel about it. She just, she just went for it to, that lunch was really like, it was very eye opening and interesting. Interesting is a good way. Isn't that crazy that you still married me despite my dad the first time you meet him

Speaker 15:         00:48:48       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:48:50       drops some, some embalm. Yeah. Back in the day he was not, he didn't pull any punches. And then your mom was a different level though. Your Dad was just more like shooting the shit. And I could tell that, you know, he was like, he was old world just like it's just a old school guy. I was like, okay, I knew I knew what I was getting with him. Your mom was much more unpredictable. What like you like you would know because she is unpredictable, you know, like that. Yeah. So, but I did not know what was not. I didn't know really what was happening there. But in a weird way I kind of understood, I thought I understood your mother as being this eccentric foreign person that has like a kind of big bold personality. My mom is kind of like that. Especially sometimes I've seen people meet my mother and not know what just happened.

Speaker 4:          00:49:43       Like I've seen them be like, what? And I have to kind of go like, oh, this is what she meant by that. And this is what she meant by that. And No, no, no, no. That's, that's how she is especially is to somebody really American, you know, like with two American parents and they grew up in the suburbs and like the, and they don't, they don't meet foreigners. So I kind of thought that your mom was like, you know, your mother is like a fun foreign mom, kind of, she may say a word and correctly or it has an emotional reaction also. She's also much more expressive and animated. There's also a thing that I related to with your mother and mother's very animated. So your mother, I saw her as well. My mother does not curse. So that part's, what was it really amusing to me that you're like this fucking, she was like, this can't at Bloomingdale's. And I was like, whoa. And then she was taught, she goes, I thought they fucking bitch. Fuck you announced it. Like that is intense.

Speaker 5:          00:50:40       So really it's a real, real, she was convinced it's, it's, I'm so glad she's dead now. I can talk about this stuff. But yeah, she was always convinced that someone's out to get her, the woman at Bloomingdale's. And one time, I never forget, we went to a Sushi bar and the waitress, excuse me, sat us near the restroom and my mother took that personally and she called her. She goes, you're fucking gook bitch. Don't fucking sit me next to the toilet. You're fucking gook bitch. And I was like, all right, we gotta go. Yeah, you got, you can't, you can't even, and I made her leave. I was so mortified. We can't be served. It's a lot, lot of that. Yeah. And I remember someone cut her off in traffic. I remember one time when I was a little little girl, someone cut her off in traffic and the woman gave a look to my mom. Some look. My mom was like, oh, you're going to fucking cry. Like she was.

Speaker 5:          00:51:37       She would a fight with people for parking spaces. Like we weren't, we were in a parking lot in San Diego. Oh, you're gonna fucking cry. Like she was so crazy. And My mother was fighting for a spot once in San Diego and part of the yelling at people with Dean or, no, this is before dean. This is when I was just a little girl and she would itch. I remember they had like a fight where the two of them were inching, inching into the one parking spot and my mother won that one. And then later my Stepdad came in. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:52:07       That was the, I got to tell you this. Yeah. I don't know if I ever tell you that stuff first time I really felt like I wrap my head around what you grew up with. Right when you told me that parking lot story where, because a lot of times people speak, you know, hyperbole with like exaggerations and, Oh, you know, my Stepdad, he was a crazy guy.

Speaker 5:          00:52:28       Yeah. I don't even throw that word around. Yeah. Loosely around me. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:52:32       Oh, you know, he was like, he talked a lot of shit and you're like, yeah, okay. Like I, he had a big personalities, what you're saying, but you told me a story. You Go, yeah. You know, my, my mom, I stubbed out, they there, they were nuts. And I'm like, yeah. And you go like, you know, in parking lots, like he would talk, you know, Talk Shit to people. Yeah. And I go, yeah, okay. And you go one time, this guy, like they fought over a parking spot and I guess the other guy got it. And so then my Stepdad stabbed his tires.

Speaker 5:          00:53:06       Okay. Yes. Not that. Not at that moment. So what we did was later he goes, oh, there's Indian. Let's go for some ice cream, pistachio ice cream. And because we used to go to the rite aid, they're now called rite aids, whatever. Thrifty. And that was flavor. So

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       I didn't know I was a teenager. I get in the car, we'd go to the Thrifty's for the ice cream. He goes, hold on, I got to do something, gets out of the car, stab, stab, stab this guy's tires back in the car. And we'd go, got, we got pistachio. So that's really when I go like, oh, as other level, other levels. I mean, I can see a being someone's story from, they were in college, right? I was fucking nuts and go, but this was a 40 something, maybe 50 something year old man. And there's a lot that was going on and he pulled over the car and stabbed someone is tired and then we went off and got ice cream. Ice Cream. That's not, it's so, it's so outrageous. That actually was one of the first stories where I was like, oh, she's, she really did grow up with some not normal shit at all.

Speaker 3:          00:54:20       Lunacy, lunacy. And I also didn't want you to know the extent of it cause I wanted to marry normal. I'll tell you, I've thought about that story for a minute. I was like, what in the fuck? He used to fight with people in movie theaters. Um, somebody we talking in the theater and he'd turn around and tell him shut up. And one time one guy was like, you shut up. And then he stood out. You fucking shut up. You want to take it outside. Like it was one of those things. And then one time in the grocery store, some kid was crying and my mother told the kid to shut up and told me that Stepdad came in. I was like, they were, they were a good pair, believe it or not does too. I think they found each other. That was, it was like fire and kerosene and the two of them together.

Speaker 3:          00:55:08       That's the other one. I remember 10 years ago, you told me the story. You're like, this kid was crying. My mom told the kid to shut up and then the mother, right, wasn't the mom got upset, they weren't Gilson horse. And the mom was like, don't talk to my kid like that obviously. And then escalated into take to the parking lot. I would lose my mind if somebody said that to me. Of course. Yeah, of course. Yeah. It's a lot, man. I talk about it on that. See Bro, because you know what I found though? A lot of people have wacky parents more than have, oh my God, I don't know. I don't think I'm in that much of a minority. Who knows? It's embarrassing. I gotta be it. Definitely relate to that. But what I'm saying is all of them, and you should know that that's not okay.

Speaker 3:          00:55:56       And that's not, I mean, that becomes your example. If you're seeing, if you're a parent is like, I'm a stab, someone's tires out. It's not a good thing to do so bad. And I knew it was wrong then, you know, even when I grew up in it and you grew up in it, you think that's the norm. But I remember being like 10 years old and thinking, surely I was adopted. I swear to God, I had the thought that one day someone's going to knock on the door and tell that I was actually of another family and they're going to take me away. I really knew at an early age that I did not belong. And it's taken years of therapy to reprogram, like to, to um, to unlearn the bad learning. Sure. All that stuff. A lot of it, you know. See the thing is you're lucky that you don't see that as the way to be because there's people that get raised like that and then they go, I'm going to go stab some times.

Speaker 3:          00:56:46       Absolutely. Cause it's cause it's what, you know, learned behavior. Yeah. That's a thing.

Think it's the glamour drug of the eighties well, that's the point of this front. That little reminder, hey, can kill you if you've got to die for something. This sure as hell ain't yet.

Speaker 3:          01:04:28       It's not effective. That was terrible. That was stupid. Like that wasn't even cautionary. No. Who wants to listen to him about that and he slid have flavor flave do that shit. And they'll be like, oh no, I love him. Pee Wee.

Speaker 9:          01:04:44       This is crack rock cocaine. Okay. It isn't glamorous or a cool hook. Kids stuff. It's the most addictive kind of cocaine and it can kill you. What's really bad is nobody knows how much it takes. So every time you use it, you risk dying. It isn't worth it.

Speaker 3:          01:05:06       All right, well that's about what number we saw how we watched his new movie and we were trying to guess his age. Yeah. And he's like 70 yeah, I thought he was 48 yeah, we start 70

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       he's way older than we thought. It's 50 no, no, no, no, no. I got a double.

Speaker 5:          01:05:26       He must have been 31 at the height of his fame. And that was what, 20 years ago? So it was 50 he's 64 get out of here. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:05:38       Yep. Paul Rodriguez. Rubinfeld Aka Paul Reubens. Yeah, 64 man. But they computer generated. I didn't know that. Well, they did some, some computer stuff on it.

Speaker 5:          01:05:57       Oh, the latest. Yeah. [inaudible] 64 I don't care with that. He still looks incredible. A Mace. Yeah. What is, can I read this email from a listener about the dog shit food [inaudible] so last week, um, I ate a little bit of dog food just to see if my poo would smell as bad as dog shit because someone wrote in and asked us if we ate dog food. What are shit smell like it. Anyway, this guy writes in, Hey Hitler's. I thought I'd try him in here and say that most of the unique smell of dog shit does not come from dog food, but in fact comes from the dogs. Anal scent glands door. There are two of these on either side of a dog's. How'd he say ass? Hell yeah. They helped the dog markets territory. No Shit. The problem is that with modern dog food made of cow brains and maggots.

Speaker 4:          01:06:53       Fuck, is that, oh no. Oh Shit. I should grab this. Okay. Right in the middle of an email.

Speaker 5:          01:07:00       Sorry. Sorry, I was in the middle. I know, but I thought I, I had to get that. Now, the problem is that modern dog food made of cow brains and magnets, there often isn't enough fiber in a dog's diet to push all that smelly goop out of their scent glands and they become impacted. This is what causes dogs drag your ass is across the carpet. If that doesn't work, you might have to stick a finger in there and squeeze all that doubt. We don't do that. We take our dog to the vet and they do anal gland expression cause if he dad could do it by the groomers, they don't really get in there the way the vet does. Just a little tip. If you guys have dogs, take him to the vet. Bitsy needs to have that done once a month. Is it once a month? Because she's like a pure bred Dum Dum. Yeah. And you know they're genetically defective. Yeah. So That's interesting. I didn't know that. Their anal glands make it smell bad.

Speaker 4:          01:07:54       [inaudible] interesting. I didn't know that either. Interesting. I didn't know. Does that look familiar to you or no? What's a photo of two bottles of water post show in Portland. You got a full bottle here, basically a half bottle of water there.

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       That's after you. That's after you perform. The email says Tom. Christina put on a great show in PDX last week. I was front and center. Yes, she did have two bottles of water with her. Attaches a photo of what they look like at the end of the show. One completely full one, perhaps half empty. Oh, and on the podcast this week, she conveniently didn't mention that she dropped the open one during the set where she probably lost at least four to five ounces. So based on the visual evidence, it looks like she your kid about three ounces through a 90 minute set. She was horse at the end. You just can't help some people. It's no wonder why you're the true water champ. Thank you for your thoughts. First of all, Blake, thank you Blake. Blake, how do I know those two waters are in fact my waters? Those are your waters.

Speaker 3:          01:09:08       He had them tested for my saliva to make it genetically, please, clearly decoy water. A lot of pussies in this argument right now. It's just not happening. That's Blake bullshit. I've been getting reports about you, your lack of hydration in South Carolina. Yeah. I wasn't in South Carolina, North Carolina. I was not lacking. I was so hydrated. I don't, I didn't, I heard lots of reports that you didn't take any sips during your show. He didn't bring any water up on stage. Things of that nature. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I did drink a lot there. People were talking about it. Nobody's talking about your hydration. There was on the news.

Speaker 4:          01:09:53       Um, hello. Mommies can't help but notice that over the past few months, Tom has continuously postpone, is required. Colonoscopy, how we just addressed this, but we did a few episodes back. I was a static to discover the Tom rescheduled the date, the same as my birthday on the 27th I thought, wow. Tom's colon and health is one of my best birthday. A birthday presents a guy could receive however I am now distraught. Find out he was going to postpone again. Beg of you, Tom, please give me yourself and your, your gift, your family. The gift of a perfect colon health on the 21st birthday on my 21st birthday of October 27th I'll drink one for you. It doesn't say who that's from. Um, but thank you and I will, I will not do it on the 27th because I will not be here, but I will reschedule it again.

Speaker 3:          01:10:40       Why are you showing me? I made you read that because I want to shame you into making that appointment. You just had violent diarrhea. That's true. And I care about you. Dumb dumb. Can I read this email? Yeah. I love this. Hi. Zim Genes and surge jeans. I wanted to trim it on the shower debate. That isn't really a debate, Thomas. Correct. Uh, that for showers that are shower slash Tub combos with shower curtains as opposed to shower doors, you enter from the rear. Also glad that Christina quickly realized how it was. She did

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       the opposite for so many years. However, I wanted to quickly point out that in most bathrooms with this type of shower tub deal, the toilet is parallel to the tub on the same bathroom wall as a showerhead. Meaning that in order to enter the shower at via the wrong slash psychotic way, you would actually have to shimmy between the tub and the toilet in order to enter that way. Just think to all your many experiences and hotel bathrooms to know what I'm talking about. But the average bathroom is literally set up to naturally allow you to enter the shower from the rear stop fighting the natural architecture of the bathroom floor pan plan. This madness must end love the pod. Huge Fan. Thanks Rick. So they're saying that you're entering incorrectly doing that are our old bathroom. The toilet was directly parallel to the shower. Right? So I would get off the toilet and then squeeze my way in between the toilet and the shower because it was so small and our old place. Of course then I would force the issue to do it. And you such a dummy.

Speaker 3:          01:12:18       Oh, you're not a dummy, but I think you understand that there's a better, there's a better way.

Speaker 5:          01:12:24       Yeah. I really made an effort to, to do it that way. So funny. That seemed more intuitive to me.

Speaker 3:          01:12:31       Nothing back. And now, you know. No, I know. Um, don't worry this, this is too long. This dental update, sorry. Okay. In retrospect is too long. Well, I thought we could play the other thing please. Um, let me see.

Speaker 8:          01:12:52       You posted right on the cheat sheet first lane. Oh yeah.

I didn't do it myself. Like I didn't do it intentionally, so I'm trying to, okay. There you go. Oh my gosh. Yeah. We need new chairs so our teeth are still not, that's embarrassing that we do this.
