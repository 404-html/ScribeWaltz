Not Possible. No. No matter how talented you are, you busy. Yeah. Why the low talk? What is that his sexy voice? I don't know.

Speaker 6:          00:09:37       No, I want to barely can roll a blunt with her blessing.

Speaker 5:          00:09:40       That's, that's pretty, he's trying to meet. That's, but that's his deliberate sexy time boys. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:09:45       Saying any time machine out of beef Jerky,

Speaker 5:          00:09:49       sex swing time machine at a beef jerky. It's really not. Does that even mean? What does that mean sir? Oh, think anyone called or texted him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think that maybe now they will. Well, that's, I'm saying you and I have been giving these guys a great platform yet. We don't give out their numbers. Obviously. It's a fine line. So they can find them. We uh, uh, the Meth, that guy took it video down. Why? Why? Yeah. I wonder why people found them and they're like, hey man, I want to see that Dick get bigger.

Speaker 5:          00:10:20       That's the thing about our, uh, listeners is that they are so good at finding these people. You can't hide from the Mommy's yes. That they are a harnessed force and they should never be matched with, you know? Yeah man. Yeah. Quite a force. Oh my God. I, I don't want to forget. So that's why I'm jumping into this right now. What's that? Um, I did it. I did it. I did it. I went ahead and against your wishes. Um, hold on. Oh boy. Against your wishes. No neuropathy. Now your apathy issues, he just said, I'm not sure why that's relevant to his discussion of what, when his brother comes so hard. Yeah. With no known neuropathy. [inaudible] neuropathy hinder his ability to come rather than bolster it boost his ability to come hard. You know what I'm saying? Like his argument is, yeah, there's no known neuropathy that would be an advantage is what I'm thinking to his coming so hard.

Speaker 5:          00:11:27       It's all the math. So why I mentioned the neuropathy, I don't know baby smokes meth. I mean, what are you trying to do here? I'm just trying to make logical sense out of the argument. That's your problem. My problem with crazy is my whole life I've tried to understand it and I just, you can't, you can't understand it. You just gotta let it go. You dared me and, and double dog dared me and said, it's not possible. Uh, I didn't say that. A, you said it's not a good idea. It's not possible. And I went and pulled the trigger anyway. Oh boy. It's the four stroking tee shirt from,

Speaker 1:          00:12:03       I'll see you at your mom's house. Oh boy. We went with the approach of, uh, having a golf clubs. A lot of people were telling me, oh, motorcycles have four stroke engines, but I have no one. No, I wouldn't know that. Well, the, I just was just like, yeah, I don't,

Speaker 5:          00:12:21       so it says your mom's house for stroke gang, don't math with us, which is pretty funny. I like the tag.

Speaker 1:          00:12:26       Yeah, it's pretty great. I'm trying to find a, I want to find the gentleman that designed it for us. Uh, to me it's Jeffrey Miles. Jeffrey Jeffrey. Thank you very much. Uh, says your mom's house. And then on that bottom part it says, don't mess with us. Which was a suggestion from somebody for stroke gang. So it's in the store. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:12:47       I'm going to be selling about five or seven of these. Let's show Christina what time it is and prove to her that for stroke gang it can be for the masses. My prediction [inaudible] Lotta Xcels not at all. Not a lot of uh, female cuts being sold. I can go and mail only on this. I think the, okay, when that's a smart idea because you're not going to see a lot of females, female side necessarily. Trolls mediums are going to seem larger sizes being so like you're full of it. But yeah. Um, I would be, I would be so surprised if I saw a woman out of your mom's house event or one of our standup shows wearing this. I would not be surprised. This is the difference between you and me. Okay. Well I believe, I'd like to get some numbers on these because this is the rub rub shirt and no offense to the designer because he tweeted me and he was like, I'm, I can't believe you. Yeah, that was funny. I was joking. But the design is fine. I'm not saying anything. I just think the concept, the idea of your, of a com beard on a comedian's face, it's a little aggressive and I'm thinking four strokes till someone comes hard again. A little aggressive. And they did the play on, they put golf clubs there. Oh, I got it. No, I understand the joke. It's very clever. But uh, you know, what does it mean? It's about, well now

Speaker 1:          00:14:05       like an inside thing where like somebody who just walks by, someone in that shirt, it's like, Oh God, I got it. A golf thing, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:14:13       Yeah. You're laughing at my reaction. You know what's great about it? It happens every, every episode and you get mad every time. I know. It's terrible. It's so funny. You're like Charlie Brown when he goes to kick the ball and then Lucy takes it away. No. And he's like, why did I keep trying anyways? Um, disgusting, vile

Speaker 1:          00:14:35       bye. Sees it. And they go, oh, that's a golf friend. But then if it's a, somebody that's in the know, they know that it's a meth smoking,

Speaker 5:          00:14:46       that's a meth pipe right under the golf clubs.

Speaker 1:          00:14:49       Yeah. But meant to look like a, a t with a ball kind of upside down, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:14:55       You know me really funny because doesn't Your Dad Golf? Yeah. Maybe we could get him a shirt. Oh, I'll definitely send them one. You buddy at a golf shirt. What's this for? Stroking cow. So at four strokes would imply we gotta get it.

Speaker 1:          00:15:08       I'm on the show soon. He, uh, he's on a trip,

Speaker 7:          00:15:11       right? Four strokes would imply that you can get the ball in the hole and four, well it would, well, I mean it would

Speaker 1:          00:15:17       just, it doesn't necessarily suggest that it's just, you know, a stroke is, uh, you know, a swing of it. Um, three strokes for strokes. So I think it would just suggest to a golf person that it's just, yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:15:31       Golf Lingo. You want me super funny is if golf nerds did buy it. No, I had no idea. Like, he's so funny. He, to the driving range, Dad boners wearing it. What's the forest stroke that you and your friends you go play golf? Uh, yeah. Well, uh, have fun selling those five shirts and view so wrong on this. Let's see what mentally ill women you know are into that kind of stuff. I'm telling you,

Speaker 1:          00:15:56       it's in the store now. March method, merchant method.com. So slash Tom Segura. Um, we did our, uh, so grow, we did an overnight to get away. Yeah. For one night. What we do is, uh, we take her some and put them in the dog crate, put a bowl, some waters, fresh water, don't get upset. We leave him diapers were like change yourself and then, sure. Uh, we, uh, we just leave him for like a day again. Please say that you're joking. So the child services doesn't come investigate. Kidding. It's less than a day. We did them for like 18 hours. Okay. Um, no, we have a, he's watched. Don't worry about it. No. Yeah, well it, the cigarettes and his, his booze and then we go overnight. It's just what something we do every once in a while. And we went to a nice place. We spent the night out, but, uh, first we went to their spa and did like nice mommy treatment at the spa. And, um, beforehand, before we left the house, actually it was like mid day you had ordered a Mediterranean lunch. Yeah. And you were like trial this stuff. And I go, okay. And it was really good. It was it an Israeli or is it yeah,

Speaker 7:          00:17:07       Sydney. Yeah. Yeah, Mediterranean Diet. I was reading how healthy it is and I'm really into sour tastes right now being preggers. Yeah. So, you know, it's like a fucking Hamas and chicken kebabs and stuff like that. I had, you know, had had breakfast and I was, I was like, yeah, but I'll try these and I've took a couple of bites of things, really fresh egg plant that fresh salads and mix, right. Diced tomatoes, all fresh. Very good. Really good. And then of course like a homemade fresh hummus. Hamas, I think he's homeless. Yeah, I, I

Speaker 1:          00:17:37       had that homos and um, if you bites then a few more or less really good. And we drive to the place and um, we check in together. I go in my room,

Speaker 7:          00:17:50       I lay on this table and a therapist comes in and was like, okay here, you know, whatever, like relax, have a nice treatment. And then as she like changes the light in the room, my stomach goes through. Oh, I was like, oh my God. And like, you know when you, I could feel it. The feeling from my gut to my asshole, I'm looking through that donut that your face is in and I, my eyes widened. I go, oh my God, it's a catch it quick and I just squeeze my cheeks so hot. I spent the first 15 minutes just like this and that donut like in a full panic. And then eventually it just went back up inside me. It's interesting cause I had a panic fart too, cause that Mediterranean food really creates a lot of gas and I just client just hard as I can, which is very hard for me.

Speaker 7:          00:18:44       Um, but then it just disappeared. Yeah. Now here's the nice part is that the minute you stand up after the massage, it all comes out. Oh it is. Here's the thing, and you forgot about it. That's what happened. You know, it's like a 90 minute treatment massage. So when, uh, when you're, when it's like, okay, it's done. You kind of have that drunk post massage feeling where you're like, whoa. And she was like, oh, they're waiting outside with water, their water. And I sit up and you're like, Oh man, you sit on the table for a second, kind of gather yourself, put your robe on. Like, oh man. And then asthma about to walk out. I go, Huh, I got the fart again. And now you feel no pressure, no fear. And it's just, it's like it built, it grows, it grows and then it comes out so fast.

Speaker 7:          00:19:38       Yeah. And so effortlessly, but also with more substance and purpose has really some meaning behind it. You can't stop it if you want it to. At that point, it was like a second massage has to happen. Now what's really neat is where I was climbing up some stairs with you to go back to our room and there was a gaggle of young girls, little 1213 year old tea. We're not 12, 13? No. Uh, how old are those slots? No, like 17, 18, 19 like, yeah, they're older tables sluts. Okay. Yeah, they were total slots. Now they look, they look tiny. Everyone looks so young to me now. They're not 12th night and they were walking. I climb steps slowly now. So they're like all kind of going past and I let out the biggest fart. Believe it. Here's what's interesting. Okay. Here's why I wrote it down for topic today because if you recall, the Cincinnati fart happened when I was six months pregnant and Cincinnati and that, what room do we, six one eight or eight oh eight.

Speaker 7:          00:20:44       Yeah. We couldn't figure it out. And, and it came to, it came to my attention that pregnancy farts for me are more powerful. They smell exactly like what I have just eaten. I, um, the day I had some Broccoli and Le and beef stew, I farted, like an hour later, it's smelled exactly like the beef stew in the Broccoli. He was so crazy intense. And so I allowed that tremendous for it on the stairs. And I was like, this is one of the nice things about being pregnant is the volume, the ferocity, the years probably people that had really heard and seen you do that would have been that poor woman. You get so much empathy as a, you know, you think they take mercy on us. Oh definitely. Like I had done in the pig that had been like, oh that that nicely. They have no idea what a savage you are no idea.

Speaker 7:          00:21:42       That's the best part about being a lady is that nobody knows it's, it's my secret, our secret and have a rnt and no that was great. And then here's the other thing that we might, God we're at a nice place, you know, it's our one night out for like, I dunno the month or two, we never go out to dinner anymore. Like we're in bed by eight o'clock watching TV. Like the dinner doesn't happen. So make a reservation at a nice restaurant. Really Nice restaurant and we eat it fine. We look at the menu and we're like, it's going to be a great meal. And then especially because you're pregnant, cause I actually, I follow the lead a lot. Like I try to be a good boy, but if there's a pregnant woman eating and saying I can only resist so much. And so it's like there's a few hours and you're like, well I got to eat something.

Speaker 7:          00:22:31       Like I need a snack. I could, we had a good two, two hours and 45 minutes before a dinner reservation at this point. Here's the thing, we usually dinner like at five with our kid and our dinner reservation was for seven 45 which is for me, that's pajamas at bedtime. So five you're like, you're like, oh I got to wait almost three hours. You got to, got to order something. So we pull up the room, the in room dining menu. Yeah. And we, you start ordering beet salad, cheese, careless smarties. And then what was the other thing? Oh the chips and Guac. That's always the nail and the confidence that that was bad. I mean it was good. But anyways, they bring it up and then it starts picking up cookies too. Yeah. Oh No, they brought a whole thing of different cookies. What the fuck is this?

Speaker 7:          00:23:23       Oh, just welcomes. It's just a gift from the staff. Oh my God. Yeah. I just, I dunno, all of a sudden I'm looking at you. I'm like, supposed to have dinner in an hour and you're like, yeah, oh, I think we're going to skip appetizers. I'm like, yeah. I think, yeah. I ended up being a great meal that we only ate even when I, when I ordered dinner, the guy was like, he sides. I was like, nope. He's like, it's not that big of go. It's fine. I'd never do that. I was like, no, no. It's good. We're such 80th and that's such a nice place. And we never really go out tonight. We don't go to a nice places anymore and like, we totally blew it, dude. We blew it on Calamari and chips and salsa and the chips in gloss. So it was a fun night though.

Speaker 7:          00:24:11       Super Fun. Yeah, but I was like, dude, you take it for at, Huh? Oh yeah, of course. What did you drink? I drank. Um, oh. I tried one of their signature cocktails. I didn't even know that. Yeah. And then, uh, I had a glass of wine after that crazy rep brows. I'd be carried back to the room. Sure, sure. Well, you know what's so funny to you and I are, this is why we're married, been together for so long is that we both liked the same things, which is laying down and then eating. Yeah. Well it makes for a good relationship watching stuff. Farming land, the end of the same stuff, man. Patten dogs. You know what I mean? This is something I want you to think about since, um, we're going to have another baby soon.

Speaker 8:          00:25:02       Also, I'm making use today a bit of a stink. I've a baby nappies asexuality expert claims parents must ask permission before changing their child's nappy.

Speaker 7:          00:25:17       Yeah. It's a foreign or word for it. So it's the idea that we should ask this child to be about for consent

Speaker 8:          00:25:28       to change. Yeah. In Carlson blades, consent must be given by the child before they dirty nappies removed. He or she is on the ABC suggesting how to go about it. I'm going to change a nappy now. Is that okay? Of course the baby is not going to respond. Yes, mom. That's awesome. I'd love to have my nappy changed, but if you leave a space and wait for body language and ways to make eye contact, then you're letting that child know that their response matters and live in Glen in that child run away from the change table,

Speaker 7:          00:25:58       right? That's right. That's right. I was going to say shit on it. It's such, what's going on? It's worth shit. What the fuck is it? You know what's wrong is that people don't think there's objective reality anymore. Everybody's living in their own version of it, and so whatever you say is right, it doesn't matter. There's no objective shit happening. The thing is, this woman had it right on the head. You ever try to change a diaper on a screaming infant who's wet and miserable? Never give consent one out of half the time when a kid can't even respond, but they're usually like, no, no, and you're like, you have shit on you. Well this morning. Yeah. It takes 10 minutes just to wrangle the toddler and uh, to convince him to stop playing for five seconds. Yes. It's, it's a, it's a fucking nightmare, man. And an infant, someone who can't even really talk, respond.

Speaker 7:          00:26:52       Oh my God. That is the dumbest thing I've ever fucking heard. Fuck. An eight week old. Is it okay with you? This dumb bitch and I have never had a kid in her life. [inaudible] stupid. Basically. It's caused quite a stir. Some slam. His concept is left lunacy. Yes. Carson has definitive comments saying the idea around consent is about empowering children with their rights and protecting them from sexual abuse. Oh, okay. Well here's the thing. You just tell the kid, mommy and daddy change your your day day. Yeah. And it, you know, nobody else. That's it. Or if someone touches your eat, why can't you just have a conversation with your kids is what I'm saying? Because what you're talking about like stupid idiot kids that can't speak though. She's talking about babies. I've got a seat.

Speaker 9:          00:27:36       Same month old. You do two photo. It's cool. Cool. It's cool.

Speaker 7:          00:27:41       Yeah. She can see her point. Oh, okay,

Speaker 9:          00:27:45       well monitor. It'll go po says no. It was a single time. You're not respecting her consent. Oh, I know.

Speaker 7:          00:27:55       I liked these. Yeah, yeah, of course. These keeper. Real man. Yeah. Um, all I know. Yeah. You're not respecting her consent. Change that baby's nappy. Well then I guess diaper changing is a sexual event. Is that what they're saying? I don't know. I'm going to change a nappy now. He said, okay. Is that it? Okay. I mean, you're not touch, you know what I mean? It's not a sexual, I understand the, the, the kind of the logic of like, can I pull your pants down essentially and do the, you know, wipe you up. But you know what, this is a, it is, is it's madness. Yes. It's, it's absolutely madness that you would think to ask a baby for consent to, I mean, the fact that we're even having this conversation. Yeah. Well I'll tell you what else is insanity. Uh, remember that gender, was it Holland? And she was asking the two year old what gender the two year old felt that day. And it's like the kid doesn't even understand the fucking question. Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah. And it's like they don't know how to even think in that way yet. No, it's not even that's not happening. Uh, I'll tell you who's not into giving consent for everything. Couple a number of the things they do. Let me show you this gentleman

Speaker 9:          00:29:10       after one of his fights in prison have to be the guy so bad. I took a blue no sane and just feeling this in no what I'm saying. Nothing. And it went from there, man. Yeah, it went from no sure. Became well known. I would like a live in laser does a respect everybody on this. Everybody do you know about me or disrespect of as Dasa, you know what I'm saying? And get crazy.

Speaker 7:          00:29:39       So he's got his own alter ego. Good for him. I mean, I, I can't say I wouldn't try to do the same in prison. Well, why don't you hear a little bit more about what dark side does.

Speaker 10:         00:29:50       Kelly says when others crossing you will not only hurt them, humiliate them as well. We warn you, it's description is disturbing.

Speaker 9:          00:29:57       I told you SPEC. You know what I'm saying? I told this, I might put more food. It took me to put a wound or saying I'll take me. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? Everybody don't mess with me. No reason why by lead them after I get in physical contact with them, I learned an improvement from a 25 year vision. I seen an old car and beat, you know when he knocked the gap? No Sin. He took a finger stuck in the Buddha Hall. No what I'm saying. And they did it. So when that man crazy, the Megan was sticking a finger Buddha holes and we going to kill him. Leave him alone. No. Beethoven. I alert. Yes. I learned from

Speaker 7:          00:30:33       it. Makes Sense. It does make sense. It's scary as shit though, right? Yeah. I mean that this guy is terrifying, but that's why he, that's his signature move. Yeah. He's telling you, I'm uh, I'm uh, if you fuck with me, I'm going to put my finger in your butt. I'm going to put my finger up your butt. If you fuck with me. He's the backside guy. Oh, he's smart. He knows what he's doing. It's called marketing. It's called branding. Tom Get on board. I don't know, man. It's um, that's intense. So nobody's talked to them. No, no fucks with him. And they, you, you realize that. You probably get the warning when you get that he's, he gets, he's like, yeah. Hey Man. And then he, if you're new, you ask them about you like that to show me his finger. Was that all about, I'm like, well, the dark side and he's got a real dark side. He will, a dork set. He'll knock you out. They help put his finger up your ass.

Speaker 10:         00:31:24       Just be aware of the thumb. If you get on his bad side. He just crazy Yulia Salada you name it. Don't matter what you do. Are you going to get you love it?

Speaker 7:          00:31:36       Yeah. I mean, look, you got a credit, this guy for some creativity here. He's got a great hook. He's got a great way of protecting himself. Yeah. I mean, he's kind of brilliant. I think this is brilliant, really. Dude, if you are in prison with all these fucking hard dudes. Yeah. And you got them all afraid of you because you're going to shove your finger and you're in their butts. Yeah. It's brilliant. I feel like he would just be giving his idea to all these other guys though. I mean, no, what's the stop? The other guy should be like, oh, that's what I'm going to do to, you know. So they're both trying to put their fingers in each other's exactly. You're fighting. Yeah, exactly. You can't take another inmate's calling card. That's not cool. I mean what's going to stop you? You're a convict.

Speaker 7:          00:32:21       You're uh, you know, remember this, this is also a prison guy. I gave him to Greece. Yeah. That guy's terrible. I tell him now this one, I'm on his finger sticking in his eighties and you know what I'm saying? Kind of like fuck yourself. Yeah. That's even scarier though to tell somebody to put their finger in their own. Oh, this one's, that one's super menacing. Yeah. Cause you know it's leading to a Fox. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Cause he's like, you got to lubricate yourself so I don't get in trouble. Wasn't that the reasoning? Imagine like likes to fuck his seal. That's a motto is fine. It is a is, you know what I'm fucking saying? Yeah. Well this guy, it's just a finger in the stank. He done it when you're knocked out. Yeah. So it's fine. Like there's no fire. What are you talking about? You're knocked out. You're not gonna feel it. You'll feel it afterwards. It's just a finger gently. Well, it's a thumb on a, you know, you're already unconscious. So what?

Speaker 9:          00:33:21       Saying no. Saying Salsa. Salsa. Wow.

Speaker 7:          00:33:28       Got It. He's got it. He's got the right idea. This guy, you're a fan of dark side. Hey man, if I were in prison and if I were smart enough to come up with a hook like that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean this guy's a genius. A genius. Dark sizes.

Speaker 9:          00:33:41       Thanks.

Speaker 11:         00:33:44       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:33:45       Flavor fleet. Yup.

Speaker 9:          00:33:48       No, say no. Say No. Say No. Say No. No.

Speaker 7:          00:34:00       It's been a while since we've had a montage. Super Cut. You know what I'm saying? Like that.

Speaker 1:          00:34:04       Yeah. That was pretty great. Thanks. Dark sighting. God, that would be the worst guy to see on the yard. Oh my God. Best if your cell mate with someone like that? Nope. I don't think he has a cellmate. No, I don't think so either. I think they know better than that. I think they may have had a cellmate prim. Remember that one? There was that one on one. You turn me up a little bit. There was that one. I might have owned a lockup guy who, uh, he had a crazy thank you. It was a Kentucky one. Yeah, we had a crazy mullet and remember he was, he had a really scary stare. Yeah. And he told a story about how he had a cellmate and he didn't like him. Yeah. So he told the warden or the guards, like, I don't want to be soul mates with this guy anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:34:52       Like get him out of here and there you go. Like, you don't get to decide that. So he just killed him. He goes, guess what? I'll have some in the morning. I just decided. Yeah, that's terrifying. Yeah. Some of these dudes are pretty wild. Gosh. Oh, that's why they're locked up. Yeah. Um, what is this? I haven't seen this. There's someone said they discovered a, what is this I want to share with you? Oh, and guests. Donia that's really close to where I went to college. North Carolina. Hmm. This is a poop pile in the neighborhood. Oh, okay. Okay. Let's see how, let's see.

Speaker 12:         00:35:27       Well, your work in Gastonia, North Carolina, and uh, I know Christine's had all these stats about poop pile, not and not being a common thing around here. But, uh, this is the local poop out here. No. Yes. Stoney wow. Trees right above us. You can see it's flour. This is what we do around here. Tupac man.

Speaker 7:          00:35:57       Thank you. Edwin. Let's tar heel. State mastery is hell Edwin. But again, I'm not seeing the design that you describe where it put people, put steps on the ladder and then there's it. I had a little more ingenuity, so I mean, that just looks like a bunch of sticks and some turds. Let's switch gears for a second. Uh, thank you Edwin for filming that. Um, a lot of people were excited last week. Uh, by my tried out video and it ended up leaving to a real examination of one bit of dialogue. Yes. Uh, this is big. Your mom's house news hot debate. We have been examining this. Then I made note of the ridiculous amount of different versions of things people are hearing. They're really, there really are a lot. Really? Yeah, I wrote that. Okay. Oh yeah, yeah. Let's hear it. Well first I guess let's, let's replay the audio so of course it can beat me home.

Speaker 7:          00:36:57       Ya know, so it's that last bit on, Ya know, right. Homea now. So piss on me. Beat me, piss on me. Beat me on me. I know that last bit. Homing. Yeah. Really gets to people. Okay. Yeah. So here is, I'm going to run through, these are all the ones that were suggested at least a few times. It's a few. The first one which was suggested the most actually okay. Is that he's saying home yet and it's because this is after he says, um, yeah, uh, you got a friend, your frank and moving to, right. So call me out. So he's saying like homie out to all your friends is what they're saying. Yes, homie out Amina. But then I hear homea now, right homie on out is what they're, some people are saying he's saying home. Yeah, no homie on out, you know, like homey on out homie homie on out.

Speaker 7:          00:37:52       So people heard help a man out. Oh yeah, of course. When I say these things, none of them should be heard clearly because he's in this like, he's so fired up. Frantic. Yeah. That he's basically tripping over the words right now. Sorry. Will help a man out. Let me hear it again. Help me out. You know palm. Yeah. No, no, no, no. That's how some are saying, hold on man out. How a man out. Yeah. How a man, oh Ho, Ho, Ho man out. How a man out on me. I know. Some people are hearing,

Speaker 13:         00:38:27       uh,

Speaker 7:          00:38:29       hold me down. So it's like piss on me. Beat me, hold me down. Like he's, you know, I mean Piss, somebody beat me. Oh Man. No, no, no. Uh, own me. They in and out. Well, that's interesting. Let's people heard on me. I know a lot of people heard hollow me out. In other words, he's saying, hollow me out. Hollow me out. Maybe. How long me out? Let me hear it. Oh Man. No, I think it's how a man out a, it kept going. People, some of the people heard whole menu like piss on me. Beat me that. No, he's not that creative. No. Um, the big one that really stood out to me. I'll tell you which one that I started to believe I was hearing. This one was explained to me by someone is hone me out and to hone something out means to make a whole bigger. Let's hear it. Hone me out. Hone me out. All me. I know now that would be such an advanced word for him. He's not thinking that what? I threw an effect on it. That was terrifying.

Speaker 7:          00:39:42       Now here's what I did right here. Okay. So here's what I actually believe to be what he's saying. Okay. I believe, and this was suggested by a number of people that he is actually saying, I'm home home here now. I'm home right now. Oh Shit Dude. That's it. That's that one. Resonate. And here's why. That's it. Moments before he gave out his address. Yeah, that makes sense. And he's like, I'm home wine now. So he's like pissed on me. Beat me at home. Like he's saying to come over home right now so you can do those things right now. I even did an edit where I tried to split up how fast he says it home here now. Yeah. And it's kind of like I'm a hot white come back when he steps on it, like I'm home right now and he's so hopped up that he can't get the words out fast enough to just strike home.

Speaker 7:          00:40:37       So now it's pissed on me, beat me now try to here home here, now I'm home here, I'm home home, Ya know? Oh mere. Now I'm home and I'm home. I'm home here now. Do those things right now I'm home and I'm here now. Yeah, that's what he's saying. But he, that's what he's saying. He's too frantic. You know home. You know I'm here now. I'm home on here now and that and that makes sense actually with his accent and his hair. Would you want to say is piss on me? Beat me. I'm home right now. Come on over it now. It's my address. It makes total sense. I think that is all me. I know I'm home. I'm here now. Can I tell you something? I rarely get my mind blown like I'm, my mind is blown because I would never have heard that, but once you point that out, that makes it, it makes sense in the context of the other parts of the message. I was impressed by it. Yeah, I'm home. I'm here now. What I was almost more impressed by as soon as we uploaded last week's podcast where I shared my version and asked our listeners to share their version, try it out. It started to come in right away.

Speaker 14:         00:41:56       Go off the fucking fuck. Good feel black guy and you want to fuck me moving in. You can move in. You got to fucking, I need to be fucked a lot, man.

Christopher Walken. Really, really talented to like, I mean these are great. These are fantastic. And actually start doing when, when guests come in here, we should start having our guests, uh, do a cold reading and do the monologue. Yeah, I think so too. No prep. That should is so funny. I do watching other people do it now. Yeah, it's so it's, you see, you really get to see the absurdity of his request and the absurdity of his mind and how sick he is and, and then just how ridiculous the whole thing is. But I think you're right that it's a, I'm here. I'm home right now, home here. Now I'm home here now. That's what he's saying.

Speaker 5:          00:45:55       Here's only beat me at home. Where are it? You can do it right now. Yeah. Fuck me right now. Uh, that makes sense.

Speaker 14:         00:46:32       I think that, yeah. Uh, well you are the master. I mean you lived in these places. I'm looking for hardcore guys. I'm looking for hardcore guys.

Anyway, she and I planned our pregnancies at the same time and, uh, she's doing July as well. I didn't realize that. Yeah, we should, uh, we should give her the heads up. Yeah, I was thinking on Twitter. Maybe if you guys could let her know that her baby is due the same time as the famous comedian, Christina p, that would be amazing if, you know, the way we got Gloria Stefan's attention to, to talk about she came on our show and our show. What if, uh, you guys hit Cardi B of so much about the fact that she's doing Christina's do that. She's like, Yo, who the fuck Christina Pete. Well, how would it fuck cause she, yeah, she's got that accent. I'd be mine and my own business and I opened my Twitter album. Yeah. That would be amazing. Hit we you, who the fuck is Jamar? You Tag Cardi B be like, Hey Cardi B, we should it be, should we ask her? No. Did you know Cardi B? Did you know it's pretty cool. Your due dates, the same Christina beer. Yeah. How cool of you to get pregnant the same time as she is. So, uh, it's, I am Cardi B by those wizard is her hands her handle? I am Cardi B so it hit her up and be like, um,

Speaker 7:          00:49:54       are you guys going to have your babies in the same room? Yeah. Yeah. Just make any reference to Christina being pregnant with her. So just be like, Hey, I didn't know, uh, the, you're giving birth the same time as Christina p. Yeah. Did you plan to have the baby at the same time as Christina piece?

Speaker 4:          00:50:14       Hmm.

Speaker 7:          00:50:16       Are you going to have a, a baby party with Christina p with the families? Do or would you have baby showers together? What's happening? We're going to, yeah, she's on the east coast. I'm on the west coast. Let's make it happen. Uh, check out this guy. Just, this is the kind of guy I could see you getting like rolling your eyes at, I think this is on the train or something somewhere. So this guy from me once he taught at prostitutes pee in his mouth, so I think he's drunk on a subway or a train or something. Okay.

Speaker 15:         00:51:01       Drinking mouthwash.

That's when you have been, you know that if you go like that, very exciting. You're going to antagonize, you're going to provoke. He's like, I'm just repeating what somebody says. Shit like that on a train next to you. No. Yeah. You act like you don't hear a fucking thing and you just record them through your bicycle. Yeah.

Speaker 15:         00:51:36       Yeah. Okay.

That's a, that's a, that's an interesting, what would you really need a prostitute for that? That's to me, that seems like an easy ask the wife or the girlfriend. What? No, it's not. You could ask me to do, I'll try and I'll try it. All right. I'll pee in your mouth will be on your fucking face. Not something most people ask there. Oh No, I don't. I don't take offense to that. For me. It's easy peasy. I'm already paying anyway. Um, yeah, I wouldn't care. I mean, that's cool. Have you, but I think most people that are, that's kind of a, I was, I not horrible. I mean it's kind of advanced. I don't think most people, you know, some people are in the p but aren't most, most probably people aren't. I'm like, will you pee in my mouth? And they probably wouldn't. I don't think they would just be like, oh, that's a good girlfriend has, but also, do you think he has a girlfriend? That's probably what we should lead with. Do you think he's just like, yeah, I'll just ask my girlfriend for that. No, I guess, no, I guess not. He seems a little drunk too during the day little, yeah, it's dude is fucking hammered. It looks like it's the morning. Yeah. Yeah. Huh, Huh.

Speaker 15:         00:53:25       And

Speaker 7:          00:53:27       go oof. Really drunk, you know? Let's see if it says where this was, I don't know if this was, just says that he's the guy I let prostitutes. PMR mouth. I like the Vietnam office.

Speaker 7:          00:53:57       Yeah. The world is full of colorful people. Yeah. So you would be like, you're on board. If I'm like, I want you to give a shit. You know what I'm saying? Like if you're in a relationship with somebody and that's their thing, that's easy to accommodate that. That's not, I'll be honest. That does not intrigue me. Why not? I've never been into urine. I don't like the smell of it, Daryl. I know, but I just, you know, most of the time you smell pee. I don't go like, oh have a smell. Pas excited. I'm like, this smells like Piss, you know? But it's like that guy that McAfee guy lets people shit in his mouth. That's to me different ballgame. It is a different ball game. It's a way different ballgame and those people should be put somewhere else. But it's mental. But my point of bringing that up is just that you know the smell.

Speaker 7:          00:54:42       How do you deal with the smell? The Pismo? Yeah. Let's put things in context. Your P, this is what the fourth coffee you've had this morning. Yeah. Second you drink nothing. First of all, the water champ. Let's look right now. Who's got delicious clear water on their t side of the table. Who's drinking mostly water and a cup. Okay, that's iced coffee. That's your second. And that's a venti. That's not a small, so the reason your piece smells horrendous is because you're not hydrating your mouth. It's smells like a brick of coffee. Uh, my pee smells great. No, it smells like an entire graph of coffee being poured into a toilet. I'm looking for Posey. If anyone out there.

Speaker 7:          00:55:21       My p does it smell a lot? Because it's pretty clear cause I drink a lot of water. You see? No, I drink a lot of water. No you don't. Yes I do. I drink mostly water. Water. Now Liars having a coffee. That doesn't mean I don't drink mostly water. I never see you drink water. I only see you drinking brown coffee. Oh my God. You're such a liar. You're such a psycho liar. I never see it. You cannot be trusted. That's what I know for sure. P of my mouth. You're a fucking liar. You wouldn't want me to pee in your mouth. No nastiest shit. I went. Okay, well you don't have to drink it. Does he? Does he drink it or he just, that's what I'm wondering. He doesn't drink it though, right? How do you know he doesn't drink it? Well, does the macafee guy eat the poo poo or he just, I don't know. We act like I fucking hang out with these guys. You Watch the documentary? They talk about whether he eats it? No. Why does nobody asks the pressing questions in these films? I don't know. That's like the biggest question. Do you want to get pissed in your mouth? No. Why?

Speaker 7:          00:56:25       I'm not interested. I've never thought why don't you let me pee in your mouth and you can masturbate at the same time? Why not? Excuse me. But the next time you masturbate, do you mind if I, what does she say? I Dunno. I remember that lady. She's like to ask for Anal Lingus. Do you mind if I um, it's a very specific thing. Fetish? Yeah. You want to try it? No. How do you know you won't like it? I know I won't like it. What part of it? No, I won't like it. It's too hot. It's weird. I honestly, it's not the smell. It's the temperature I think would freak me out. Maybe it'll turn you on. I don't think so either. You could roll around in it. Why don't you lay in the tub? Live someone pay in your mouth. I'm not averse to having your fluids on me.

Speaker 7:          00:57:13       Like obviously I don't care about that. I really do think it's the warmth of the P and my mouth. That would make me want to vomit. Cause it's like body temperature except your ps really hot. Actually I think your p is like 105 degrees because it's so brown and thick. No, it's, it's like that guy's calm like the four stroke p. That's cause it's, there's no water and it's just so chunky. And it was like Brown chunks come out. No, it's the temperature more than anything. Um, and your piece specifically smells very pungent, very strong, very strong smell. When I go pee on your pee in the middle of the night and I smell it, it's so dark. It's so brown with the P is like a brown. Cool. It's clear. It's clear as day. Oh No. Oh No. Let's go take a pee challenge right now. I'll fucking show you my piece. Clear years is Brown. No, it's not. You say stupid shit nonstop and no one calls you on course. I say stupid shit. This is your mom's house, baby. This is the platform for stupid shit. I drink nothing but water and coffee all day. Okay. Then why does it smell like coffee? Only it doesn't. That's what I'm saying. You're a fucking liar. Show strong. Okay. Your P's mostly red. Okay. Red p. Yeah. Right now being pregnant from blood. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:58:41       That makes no sense. But yeah. No, and I actually, I'll be honest, you scared me with how little water you've been drinking. I'm being totally serious. I see you drinking soda, drinking alcohol, but I don't see you drinking water. I'm serious. Okay. Okay. Listen, can I read an email that came in from our friend Matt on these coasts? I'm sure he says the sons, they were having a, a family discussion and it's kind of an interesting topic and I definitely think it's appropriate for our show. Okay. So what'd you do this? Once you take this offer, it's a would you rather?

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       Okay. Okay. From this moment until the end of your life all of course I'm fucking blind. All the food you eat will taste like the best version of whatever it is you're eating. So if you're eating pizza, it will taste like the best pizza ever. If you're eating snoozers, it's the best snu she ever. But every time you fart, it will smell 1% worse than the last part. You may with no limit on how smelly your farts will become over time. So once you accept the deal, the next fart you make will be the baseline. Do you make this deal? Why or why not? Um, so thank you Matt for submitting this. Both things happen in this scenario. So you get the best food ever, but every time you fart it gets 1% worse than the last time. I mean, who would not take that deal?

Speaker 5:          01:00:15       Well, cause your farts are going to be horrendous. By the end of your life. It's going to be napalm. Who Cares? Who Cares? I care. You're fortunate already bad. And that there's no such thing as good fart, so it's already smells disastrous. You're saying it's going to smell worse, but you get the best taste ever whenever you eat anything. I mean this is an easy one. Yeah, but it's not for me. Here's why is that I don't want my food to taste the best ever. Cause then I get fat. Just fucking whatever. Check yourself regulate. It's fine. Yeah, but food tastes even better than it does now. You know how hard it is for me just to maintain and not when I'm pregnant. It's hard. But I mean how could you turn that? You wouldn't, he's saying that if you have a bite of a cookie, if you have a piece of paper, I don't want it to be the best tasting ever.

Speaker 5:          01:01:03       Cause I be the fattest person ever. No. Yeah, no. You could just stop you. There's some things you eat now that are amazing. You don't just keep going crazy on them. We can. You have self restraint. 1% worse. Fart every time is terrible. You won't be able to stew in your own baby. You won't even be able to sit in your own fart. Yeah, you, but you'd work out a system. You'd be like, oh, I got a far coming in and you, you go outside and you'd run every time you have to fart or something and right behind you. Yeah. You'd just be like, I got to Fart in the, you'd run away from your smell, but what about me? Like you're not, you don't think that'll bother me over time and getting them outside, running away from it. But that's a lie. Okay, let's, let's be realistic here.

Speaker 5:          01:01:44       You're not going to do that. I just give you a mask. You think I want to sleep with a mask on set for sleep just for the moment when I Fart, dude. But you've, here's when your farts mostly happen at nighttime when we're laying in bed in the middle of the night, middle of the night mornings, dude, you far at like four in the morning, super loud and then you think it's the best thing that's ever happened to me. And I'm like, oh I can, I'll start old and I wake up, you fight in the morning to first thing. So what? What am I supposed to be worried about that it smells bad, dude. So when you think I want to smell that far. Yeah, but I'm getting these great tastes. I don't care about your tastes. I care about your farts. Yeah, but I'm saying that I would take it because I want to have those great tastes and I don't care if it smells a little bit worse every time you're going to ruin your marriage. Why would I ruin it? Look how bad your dad's farts smell. Yeah, those are bad. That's really bad.

Speaker 5:          01:02:35       They have taken up this offer. Somebody may have given him this offer. I mean his farts smell like this offer. You know what I'm saying? And that's a life Roner like your dad's farts are just tear. They clear out movie theaters. You was fucking, you would survive. I would survive, but I wouldn't be happy. And why? Why would you be unhappy? Because just to smell a little rotten fart every now and then. Every now and then. My life is your farts. The other day we were in the kitchen and you force my hand on your underwear as you farted on my hand. Do you think that was nice? I remember that. Yeah. I felt the vibration. We're doing the cool one where I uh, I played with my butt sheet as I farted.

Speaker 5:          01:03:18       I remember that one. Yep. That was pretty cool. I just feel like I deal with a lot of your farts and for them to smell worser. Why worser is not, it's not cool for me. It's fine. I feel like it's fine. We'll have fun with your second wife. Let's talk about her. I think she's like, I think your second wife is going to be a Dalmatian cause second wives usually are. Yeah. We've been studying some second wives. We know some people that are on their second wife likes showbiz second wives. You know what I'm saying? Like the guy gets a little cash, he has a midlife crisis. He dumps the first wife and the kids and the family and then runs off with just the fucking skanky. IEST dumbest it happens. Happens a lot. So you need a few times. Yeah. And it's, you know, of course it's admirable. Everybody goes, that's awesome. Um, but yeah, I mean like what, who, who do you, how do you see it playing out for me? Um, I definitely think that your second wife is going to be way younger. I'd be like, Hey, let's start with like age. We're going to go, this happens probably like, what, five, six years from now in your mind. The kids are grown.

Speaker 5:          01:04:36       Yeah, they're fine. They're fine. They're doing great in elementary school. And then you, you know, you're a big movie star, big celebrity, one of your ingenue costars she just turned 20. She's like the new hot Winnie. She's 20. She's 20 years old and a blah. I know you like blondes and just really not demanding, like not smart. That's all right. That's like the key, the key to it from what I've seen, uh, on these, uh, these second wife. Yeah. A lot, a lot less of this chat. A lot less opinions, no opinions, no things you have to do today. No. You know, there's no, no schedule or of course, and that's what I seen that these, the midlife guy goes towards it. It's like, oh, this is great. Then he sometimes has to remember that. Then there's going to be no opinions, no pain, no, no conversations that are going to be decent.

Speaker 5:          01:05:38       She's got to say stuff like wow, bay. But she'll call you babe a lot, baby. Oh my God, baby. I love this. Might have hair extensions, a big fake tits and she's just going to say things I have to a big fake tits, so. Right. I mean, she does. She's the second wife. They all do. They all have second. I think. I don't die. I don't think so. You know? Um, wow. This is awesome. Like those are the phrases you're going to hear a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Oh, I love you babe. Yeah, Dalmatian Talk. Yeah. The second wife has to be way dumber than the first. Oh, definitely. That's, that's part of what you're looking for. Way less qualified as a human. It's just like a stupid girl and she's just like, your kids are so cute. Tell him I keep, my kids are not good.

Speaker 5:          01:06:31       This feels more girlfriend then wife though. No, that's the point. See that's the thing is that it should be just a girlfriend like and then what? Then I'm like, Oh fuck no you love it because you've had the first wife who was all these, you know, words, words, words, ideas, orders and you're so over it and upset that like the Dalmatians a relief cause you can just do what you want. Come and go as you please. You are singing to me right now. I love it. When um, how do you prevent this from happening? Cause it sounds like just how do I prevent you got it. He tell me. I don't know. I just, that's great.

Speaker 5:          01:07:10       20 Ted, stupid as, as all get out and, and like my kids spend a lot of time with her and they her, oh that's the other parts of things like emotionally she's about the same level. She's like I got, I got them slime, we did a slime party and I'm like, what's a slime party? All the kids are doing it. And she rented out a room at the chuck e cheese or whatever. Fucking, we all had slime party and she's the coolest. I'll be like, cause she knows all this stuff cause she's a fucking drum. Shandy said the store's name.

Speaker 5:          01:07:45       Yeah, she's awesome. She had the, she had, he let me get hair extensions. Shandy tech me to the salon. No, no. Shanti Shanti and we'll get them acrylic nails when they're like seven my boys. Oh that's right. We didn't want them girls. He noticed it but she, she wanted, she wanted a whore up your daughters, if you had writers spoil them, let them do what they want and you have to hear about how great Shandy is. You think you would just tolerate it? Oh my God. No. I would go to a mental hospital like I would if you did that shit to me and our family. Yeah. I would just be institutionalized. I think they would just give up. Oh my God, how it works. How do I get this done? This is great. I would just be, I would be a shell if you did this to me.

Speaker 5:          01:08:29       Oh, that's what that second wife, so what's second husband like? Usually a second husband. Women shut it down. I think women, if you, if you had this happened to you sometimes, here's how it goes to waste. The 50 year old woman just either shuts it down like Jane Fonda, she's older than that 50 but yeah, she just came out and she was like, shut it down like women and go the other way where they're like, I'm over it. I'm never getting married again. I don't need a vagina. I'm fine. I'm in menopause. Don't touch me. I'm having hot flashes. Or they go hypersexual. Yeah. And they're like, I'm going to adult con this weekend. I'm going to touch vibrators and, and I'm a MILF guys and they really advertise themselves as a Melph. Maybe you do that. Maybe you start a new site. Yeah. W from foreign ministers. I just convert it to Christina. gilt.com get off. I'm like, grandma, you're going to be some point.

Speaker 5:          01:09:27       God No, but then I have to lose like 50 pounds and get Lipo and fixed my tits. If you want to go the hypersexual and then I go hypersexual which work? I know you, you'd be like, I don't want to do all that shit. I'm so lazy. I, you'd be like, no, no, no, no. Shut it down. Shut it down. Uh, but then, you know, I'd find some like age gap, Love Shit, some 28 year old loser, you know, playing the video games and I, and I would just take care of him. That's the equivalent baby. The Dalmatian wife. That's what I can't see. You go in that route. I might, I mean, what a video game guy. Well, I'm, I'm the, I'm the breadwinner and he's just like, I play a bit down. Do you think you would like the Dalmatian life course? I'm talking about something more reasonable for you.

Speaker 5:          01:10:14       Of course I went to Dalmatian wife. That's it. But that's not, that's six years away. Maybe you would not be a real tolerate six years away. Uh, how stupid she is. Cause she would say dumb things. That's true. Oh my God. All the time. She's so embarrassing. I would have uh, uh, dinners, but I'd be like, uh, no. I was just going to be me and my friends cause it would be other couples and they'd be like, where's your Dalmatian? I'm like, oh, she had choir practice. But you know, your other friends would talk so much shit about your down nationwide. Of course. Oh my God. It would never be their go goto gossip things worse. We've seen Tom's new wife. She's so, she's so dumb. Christina was so much smarter than her. Yeah. But then Berge yeah, no, I know a lot. Um, you know, I might get into some like real kinky stuff next. You do. You know,

Speaker 7:          01:11:14       this is something, I dunno how much I could tolerate it. This, this is so weird to me that people really do this

Speaker 8:          01:11:22       Peter Pan,

Speaker 7:          01:11:36       I think it's so weird to me. So this is some, a woman likes to be babies. She's a grown woman, likes to be treated like a baby and he pretends to be her dad, dad. Kay. This is definitely for doctor. It's, here's what strikes me even more besides the obvious is that we're actually with a toddler all the time. So the fact that this is somebody's choice to be like this is really stands out of stupid, stupid or damaged cause yeah, I think what happened is some so much trauma like I bet you this one is sexual trauma and she wants, she needs to regress or something. Okay. Cause she's not embracing adult sexual. This is why you know those a porno girls talking baby talk, that's sexual molestation. How does this Guy Bang her? Cause you know he's tall, he's talking to her like a baby all the time, you know, and then you're going to, he's like, he's like, okay, we read our book, you're ready. It goes sleep now booboo. And then, then she's like, Oh why the fuck? It's like that's really it. Do they have intercourse? I Dunno, let's get through it.

Speaker 8:          01:12:41       I've men who moved Emily and already crumbling through the power dreary air but not really cause I'm fine.

Speaker 7:          01:13:04       Oh see there you go. Ready? Just to start. So he is 11 years older than her, so he doesn't mind taking on, I guess the, the paternal role. You know what always stands out to me about something like this is the effort, the amount of effort out. Good talking to you. Like you're fucking baby right now. Again, I could do this, you know, I can do this for a date. Like if I went out with someone, they're like, talk to me like a baby or something and be like, all right. But then at the end of the day I'd be like, there's no way I could do this again. I don't even think I could last a date. And this is so wackadoo. I mean this chick's got so many fucking metal problems and so does he, but maybe he likes the dependency of it. She's totally, you know a baby. It's so big. It's so sick.

Speaker 8:          01:13:49       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:14:02       Oh my God. He's going to be like, you have your shoes. You know, we got to go out with shoes. She needs something. She can't put them on. She needs her daddy. Lg By definition

Speaker 8:          01:14:12       is daddy don little girl. And it is a subsection of Bdsm, which is a part of kink. I was just discovering things about the community, learning a bit more about it. I decided to um, try it out and I've just loved it ever since. It's just me

Speaker 7:          01:14:29       try it out. So this, this grinds or crank, it's really gets her going. This is a second. I mean, I guess, you know, I'd like to encourage people to find out what they like. I got to tell you this. I don't want the adult baby diaper thing. I don't get either. I don't, I don't understand what the turn on is about being an infant or acting. It's really, that's your wires are crossed, man is some flex

Speaker 8:          01:14:52       and wire crossed shit. There are a lot of people in the community that do this sexually. Um, and I'm not one of those people completely, no sexual lifestyle for me. Oh, thank God. Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:15:02       Okay. So now that, that's more so that means that she does fuck, but only when she's out of Cara. Thank God I ain't, you know what I mean? I think the role, I understand the role playing. Maybe she's healing some childhood trauma or something, but the fucking, the fire, the guy, oh my God. Look like, how's your girlfriend? Good. What do you guys do for fun? Well, she pretends to be five. We go to the park. Yeah. Do play dough.

Speaker 12:         01:15:30       Max First told me that she was this lifestyle. She had shown me the videos that she was watching. She showed me a copy.

Speaker 7:          01:15:36       I know I'm a Jesus showing her how to count and uh, going over the alphabet. You're like, what? Yeah. Push her on the swings. There's a teeter totter or she could spell her name. She could spell my name. Uh, could you spell the dog's name? Yeah, we're really in a Thomas the train right now. Can you count all at tenant back? Does your girlfriend? Yeah, she likes Peppa the pig. I saw that. Yeah. That's a good one.

Speaker 12:         01:16:04       Was it? She was watching, she was eating these babies snacks and I think that's when we, that's when we had the conversation about it.

Speaker 7:          01:16:11       No, you mean this fucking asshole. Nice though, right? It's Cosby sweater and his ear plug his butt plugs in his ears. And all this, but he's a nice guy. Is he a nice guy for doing this? To hear this psycho? I think so.

Speaker 12:         01:16:23       What's his deal? Went down on more hardcore versions of the DLG subset, but for a lot of, for a lot of people is nonsexual. It's, and for us it's nonsexual. Do you

Speaker 7:          01:16:34       imagine getting this shit? I know it's nuts isn't to just show you the really is someone for everyone now. There is man. It's the inner how lucky that she found him. I would say because most guys, if she was dating and she was like, I go, I, I learned blue sky blue and those, you know, he'd be like, did it and then this is a square. They look the fuck are you doing right now? Come wipe me. Yeah. I mean this is like other level. Could you imagine? I would love to see these two playing in the park. I'm like, what is happening? How weird must it get? Cause she said that a lot of in this lifestyle do a sexual play on this. Yeah, that's what I'm, I'm wondering what the deal is there. That's real. I think that's, that's trauma. Absolutely right. It's gotta be, you're reenacting the trauma. Oh fuck. I mean there's, there's no way

Speaker 8:          01:17:25       I have a little, a lot of the time, especially when we're at home. Cool. When we're just relaxing and I'm with him. I'm little when I want to be, um, I'm a little when it's right to be, but of course it's, it's not something that like I cannot some trouble like public, you know, I don't just randomly like shout daddy because that's involving other people in something that they didn't know. So she's smart. Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:17:49       Yeah. She understands boundaries. She understands indoor, outdoor. The is fun for her. She, yeah. You know what? Now that I see her, she seems rational. Yeah. And it just brings her joy and then, you know, good for her. Yeah. But she definitely needs to make an appointment with a therapist and, and uh, get on that. She really likes pretending to be a little girl,

Speaker 8:          01:18:08       might want to talk to somebody. Daddy takes care of me, but I also take care of him. We take care of each other. And I think having that nurturing aspect to the relationship really makes it strong.

Speaker 7:          01:18:25       Okay. You know, this could be growth, this could be a wife number two. Oh boy. It is like it is the same thing. Yeah. For me basically, you know, dependent dumb, dumb. Now this, this chick needs serious mental counseling. See if she's still under this. And is there anything that just just like going to a shrink once a week, twice a week maybe for her will just do wonders. Yeah. I think getting out, I think this discussion would, she needs some professional. We're out a lot. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:18:54       I have an extensive list of rules, but the main ones are no tantrums. I'm no saying no and those are the two that I'm not that great at. If I break a rule, then I get timeouts. I just have to sit here in the corner and stare at the wall and do nothing.

Speaker 7:          01:19:15       Yeah. What the fuck is this all about? What's going on? Why are you doing this? What the fuck is going on as a ride? But Hey, you know what? It sounds like she's a pretty rational human and she knows what, Hey, this is my fun time. I I boundaries and I do this in the house.

Speaker 14:         01:19:37       Explain this lifestyle in terms of a little whose lifestyle is kind of like a coloring book where she hands me the lines and I can just fill them in with whatever we're calling on one. Oh boy. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:19:51       What is a fire? She's five and she's still drinking out of a sippy. Yeah. Get on your advanced sippy stuff. Well, she can drink out of a cup by now at five. Yeah. Ellis was the same exact to sip it. You stopped that one. He stopped this. Yeah. To go to school. I mean they don't even let you bring that in. Vulnerable

Speaker 8:          01:20:08       and so open in little space that that's where I want to keep it. Like it's a safe place and it's a place that we share together on the day, Christ and the bass that would wear so quick right

Speaker 5:          01:20:25       now. I know. And she said like, oh, don't worry. I'll be like, hey, can you stop doing that? That'd be so bad at being that that, but that's also the the time we live in this whole safe place. Horse Shit. This is my safe place. I think you'd be, we'll fucking weird is I want, yeah. What is wrong with these? We will have fun decency anymore. You know what I'm saying? Like can we just go back to repressing our desires like a normal society and be contributing members just for press this shit and go do something else with your life. That's good advice. You know what I mean? Go, go contribute to society. That's good advice. Press desires are good because they make you, you sublimate them through other things. This, I know you're going to get a kill. Fucking won a Nobel prize. You Psycho. You're going to have some money.

Speaker 1:          01:21:12       Great thoughts. All right, I'll go ahead and I'll read this. Okay, so hungry, I'll read this to you is an email that came in. Hey moms. I been with my boyfriend for almost two years and as he is getting more comfortable with me, he's also getting grocer. But one year into dating. We went on a two week long trip, a few days into the trip. I noticed that he hadn't taken a shower yet and he insisted that he showered after I'd fallen asleep. I believe them at first, but as the first week went by and noticed none of the hotel towels removing from where I had got put them and the shampoo and soap hadn't moved the next week he got a really bad sunburn and use that as an excuse to not shower for the rest of the trip. Turns out he didn't shower for a month. Fast forward to a year later, we now live together and he was showering every few days at first, but now he just washes his hair and his junk maybe once every two weeks. I confront him about it all the time and tell him that he smells like dirty skin, but he just laughs about it. I've tried to get him to shower with me, but he always makes up an excuse. Also, he has the same bottle of soap in the shower since I first met him. I worry that I'm starting to not notice the smell and that our whole apartment smells like him. He is also an athlete. So that makes,

Speaker 5:          01:22:28       yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:22:29       Any suggestions to help me make him shower. Also, what is the longest you've gone without shower out and what is an acceptable amount of time to go without one? I can't go two days. Nope. Thanks for taking the time to read this. Love the show. Hannah. I mean, do you want to start? Well, I mean, you know, obviously there, there is probably some root issue involved in this being something for him. In other words, this doesn't, most people do shower that are normal, healthy, functioning in society. Yeah. So, uh, I, you know, there might be something tied to this guy's childhood.

Speaker 5:          01:23:14       Oh, I might go even something more basic. I had a roommate in college that had severe skin psoriasis or Eczema or something, some kind of skin condition. Yeah. And so showering for him was rare as well because it would aggravate the skin condition. So he might have like a medical, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:23:31       Well she would pick up on that. I think that'd be, if I like to just be adverse to taking showers. It's, it's definitely unusual. Especially someone that works out a lot. Yeah. This is a psychological issue too. I think so. Yeah. Cause I mean that's one of the main things. I mean I'm going to go to the gym here in a minute and it's like, oh, you come back and you're soaking wet and yeah, sometimes you know, you get distracted and it starts to dry, but you feel that, that dry sweat on you. And

Speaker 5:          01:23:59       you know what? I am, I shower every day no matter how horrible I feel. I think the only times I've ever skipped is when I've been really ill with a fever. Even when I gave birth. Yeah. I think I showered, uh, the next I've been very sick and missed a couple days. You know what I'm talking to. But to set us, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:24:18       Um, with like a, a viral or bacterial infection or something that vomiting and you're just like, um, and you know, if you have shakes because you, you know, your temperatures swinging a couple of days, but being healthy, I mean the longest would be skipping a day because of, yeah. Because of whatever scenario, you know, a day,

Speaker 5:          01:24:37       a day. But I am so fanatic about my body is failing clean and feeling fresh. I just feel greasy and oily.

Speaker 1:          01:24:46       Who doesn't like that? I love the post clean failing best. A lot of times I'll do it. I've gone through, you know, a lot of times I shower right before bed if I have a long day. Yeah. It's like I'm about to get in bed. I was like, no, I'm going to shower first shower, then get in bed.

Speaker 5:          01:25:00       Feels good. It feels good. Yeah. I mean, listen, I don't know how this isn't a deal breaker for this woman sexually. Oh my God. Because you, uh, uh, just as a partner I think as a courtesy, like his dick and balls can't smell great you, so he does it once every two weeks. Yeah. And not only that, it's, it can give you infections to UTI. Uh, you know, they're not new. Do

Speaker 1:          01:25:24       together as a couple of years. I would sit down, I'm serious. I would go for this. I always say, look, you know, I, you know, I love you. You know I'm with you. Yeah, let's just talk about it. Yeah. Why is she just straight up? Yeah. Let's talk about what's going on and he's going to be like, wait, what? What? Let's just be straight up about it. Just tell me so that I know, what is your aversion to showers? Like what's going on, what's going on? And then he, he might be like, no, I'd be like, no, no, no. Like we've been together for a couple of years. We lived together. So you know, I'm in to you. Yeah. But I just want to know and then maybe you get a little bit under the surface. See, but I think if it is a psychological

Speaker 7:          01:26:04       trauma or some kind of an issue, a lot of people don't even know what that thing is consciously. The commerce, like the conversation starter is going to get something going. Can I tell you as a woman what I would do? Uh, I think the trick is to get in with dudes is sexual stuff and be like, look, I love you. I want to keep fucking Yale. I can't fuck you if your Dick Smells. Yeah, that's true. I mean, and you can also do the, if if reason doesn't work, you can lead like, like basically set up that sex is going to happen and he's like, yeah. And they'd be like, look, go shop. But see that's just going to get it done. I know it's a long, I'm saying the longterm discussion needs to happen. Like, excuse me, like you're saying. Yeah, but she needs to maybe make an incentive for him if he's not willing to, cause she says she's asked, right. I think she needs to incentivize him a little bit and maybe the sexist. Yeah, I'd want to know. I'd be like, oh, I really want to know what's up.

Speaker 7:          01:27:03       Sounds horrible. I mean that especially if he's exercising, that's really not cool. Then again, there I just, people who don't shower frequently, who it's their thing. I mean, I have relatives who are not big bathers and I'm talking going days and days and days and I, you know, I don't know that hygiene man, I got have it. I can't stand it. If my hair is greasy and I'm smelly or like I can't, I can't be with someone like that. I mean, thinking about your, your, your, your asshole and you're digging balls and your badge. Like to me not having a dirty vagina is like, it's just, I can't, I cannot, you know what I'm saying? We'll dude's like, we know. No, you skip a day. What's going on in your ball bag? Of course you run that and you go, oh, you can smell it and nuts stink.

Speaker 7:          01:28:05       Oh, of course. I mean, same with women. It's just sweat. Yeah. I mean, you've got to get soap in there. You got it. I mean, there's no way she can blow this guy. There's no way. And again, you can get all kinds of infections from somebody who's not hygienic down there. You know, he's one of those guys, you know sometimes you're out in public, you're in line at the grocery store and all of a sudden someone walks by and you go like, Oh yeah, I get that. That be oh trail. You know where you go is so nasty. They walk around like everything's fine. You pose a shit so nasty. That's why people were put Julie, they cover that shit. I would that nasty oils and stuff. I hate it too. That's another thing I filled out there for wife number two, no petroleum oil, no shower all the time, but she does that. She was wife number two, wife number two's got all kinds of time cause she doesn't have a job. She doesn't really have hobbies. She just likes to exercise.

Speaker 1:          01:29:03       This was a, you know, another message came in. It's pretty funny. Hey jeans. After a busy morning I took to my car to take a break, reclined my seat and listen to your mom's house while relaxing. I rolled the window down this beautiful day and a miss listening to an edit of Tom and friends in a gay orgy calling a phone sex line. Remember that prank call? I noticed through my rear view window, my female boss who was parked behind me taking notice of the ungodly sounds coming from my car after five to 10 seconds of clue listening to the phone, sex call, she got in her car and drove off. I immediately laughed so hard at the thought of her thinking about how I watch gay porn on my breaks. I have since run into her and the Internet has yet to be addressed. I want to thank the Mommy's for now creating this unspeakable tension.

Speaker 1:          01:29:51       We shall forever hold between us. That's true. Cause that that call was really graphic really long too. Yeah. It was all like, yeah, I fucking come on me, suck Mike. It was really, really intense. It's pretty funny. Yeah. That's great. You got to try to listen. You know, with ear buds. Yeah. I guess roll your windows up. She's says jeans until the day I die. The phrase, try it out has been forever ruined. I can't hear without fuck me, piss on me and beat me going, running through my brain's when test driving a new car, getting a new putter or the first time my wife had been where this swaddle cloth with my new son. She asked if I want to and utters that damn phrase. I'm now holding my son. All I can hear as a man asked me to piss him off on him and beat him.

Speaker 1:          01:30:34       I wonder if it's a first in human history. Love you Andrew. We have room and try it out. I just ruined for me. I mean, I say it just, it'll come out and then I just, I started laughing. What are you laughing at? My, I just try it. I know so many phrases are destroyed for us. Yep. Uh, so when tells me to be careful, I used to be carefree and scratching my ass all the time. I got a, then I got a deal. Science assist, uh, apparently scratched and broke the skin a bit and allow bacteria to get in over time and form assist. I couldn't sit down comfortably. Had to have surgery to have it removed and cleaned out. Yeah. Sorry. This is from scratching too hard. Yeah. Scratching the crack too hard. Yeah. You gotta go, he said he did his finger just to the crack.

Speaker 1:          01:31:17       Like direct skin skin. Well yeah, I actually had one of those when I was 19. I had that, that system is it from scratching directly? I got mine from horseback riding. Ah, fuck horses. I went horseback riding and I have a hairy butt. And so you're like, the whole time you were rubbing, you know, like that. And then I was like, oh, this hurts. And I showed it to a, it's actually a friend's mom who was a nurse and she was like, you need to where, where was it on your butt? The top, very top of the crack. The middle, like at the very top. Sure. And then I went and the guy was like, oh yeah, you have this thing. And assisted formed, you know, started a forum and I was like hurt. And he's like, yeah, cause uh, like it's

Speaker 7:          01:32:00       infected now. I was like, oh, I was totally scared. He gave me,

Speaker 1:          01:32:03       um, a, uh, what's it called? Uh, uh, antibiotics. And that night, that night,

Speaker 7:          01:32:11       the cyst exploded, but it did it in my sleep. I just woke up and when I, when I wake up, my buck, my box, it had ruptured and then dry because it was in my sleep were all crusty. I'm like, what the fuck? And I take them off and there's like dried blood and says no. It's just, it's like a little thing like quarter, no smaller than that even. Yeah. Nicole. Yeah, I guess it was all pus and blood. Who's super nasty. Yeah. That's where you want me to put my mouth? No, below that. Lower on lower part of you thinks that this is okay. So he's telling you don't scratch so hard finger is saying be careful because it's like the same thing as the horseback riding. You know, you can shoot everything. Yeah, sure, sure. Guy. That's why I advocate. If you've got a butt scratch, just rub your finger over your underwear. Do you know what I'm saying? Go through the don't go under the underwear. Yeah. Just scratch through your clothing. Why? So what? Wash your underwear, right? Sure. Don't touch skin to skin and then your fingers all dirty. Some of your Chinese get Terry. That's what they're for.

Speaker 1:          01:33:20       Wore a all right. I got a try it out and we got to try it out. Um, that's a gene. What else you got? Anything else? No, I think I'm good. I'm, I love you. I love you too. Um,

Speaker 7:          01:33:34       we got to get y'all and I'm home. I'm home here now. I'm hearing no piss on me. Beat me home right now. I'm here. No piss on me. Beat me home here. Now I'm homeless here now. I think that's what he's saying, but I think you're right. Come home. I'm home. I'm home. I'm homing now. I'm home right now.

Speaker 1:          01:34:00       I think so. I'm now all right. We've got to run here is

Speaker 7:          01:34:05       time. Classic Song. Oh my gosh. And we'll see you next week. Thanks for listening. I forget the fourth stroke gang shirt is a in the store. A Thompson. Don't buy that syrupy on my line or don't support time in this. Please support me in this. Don't support this lunacy hygiene.

Speaker 4:          01:35:45       Yes. That's

Speaker 3:          01:35:50       not bad. Not Bad at all. Not Bad at all at all. At all.
