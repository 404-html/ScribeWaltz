This is say a button on a bus. Retarded. I think it's the boyfriend of a lady who's acting out and the bus driver asked him to get off the bus and they refuse. The cops are right there. She spits on one of them. Oh dear. So then they kind of like, you know, push her back onto the bus to arrest her. And that's when the guy's like, don't, she's retired. She doesn't know what she's doing. And then somebody, some PC or on the, on the bus goes, it's mentally. Yeah, I think it might even be one.

They rode the bus and the guy who's saying she's retarded is her boyfriend, caregiver, whoever. It was close to her. Yeah. He's not troubled by the word. She's certainly not disputing it. She's like, I'm not retarded. I'm mentally disabled.

Speaker 1:          00:04:49       She sounds retarded. Bula Schumer

Speaker 3:          00:04:54       mentally to say somebody's a really gets upset about it. There is that. The cop is that one of the other cops, listen, he gets really upset.

Speaker 1:          00:05:03       Jeff through this develop.

Speaker 3:          00:05:07       Don't say the word retarded and then he's like, no, no, she's retarded. He's retarded. If you knew her, you know how I'm with her all the time. She's 24, seven retarded. I told you you were going to lay a, that made my day. That really made my guys guys, guys, I'm with her all the time. Trust me. She's retarded. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:05:32       Yes

Speaker 3:          00:05:37       guys, it's table, um, cash. Check it out but just did hot yoga number 12. It's been ruining our home life. Too many messages. Too many. You're gone for hours every day cause we're doing 90 minute fucking classes. Well I don't get it cause your, let's say your class is like one, everyone's sick of it by the way. I'm sure it was Joe's idea. She was sick of it. I'm so fucking sick of yoga. No one wants to do 15 classes in a month about anything. It's a lot. No, no. Have you achieved enlightenment of some sort? I do feel like at the end of, of all the classes you do have a definite sense of clarity. It's a good, it's a good place to go if you have a decision weighing on your mind. I think like whether or not to call somebody retarded or developmentally challenged, I don't know yet.

Speaker 3:          00:06:28       And then at the end of class I'd be like, she's retarded. So you really do. What happens is hot yoga, Bikram Yoga class. Um, a good portion of it is basically meditation. If you're in a meditative state, which I think Burt could really benefit from. Oh, Berta specialty. Yeah. Has he been able to sign everyone does silenced his monkey mind? I don't know. I think so. I think he isn't in a different place. It would be. We should do, we should see him again soon. We should bring him back and get an update. Good enough. Did you leave for hot? You're like, oh class is that one. I'll be home at seven. You're hilarious. It's so funny how we breakdown for this audience, what it's like to be with you in this. So classes are 90 minutes long. 90 okay. It's hot yoga in on the class schedule.

Speaker 3:          00:07:17       If you'll go online, it tells you to arrive. Please arrive 15 minutes before class. So your 90 minutes is now 105 minutes. Class doesn't start exactly on time. Mostly the class would start, you know, five to 10 minutes after the scheduled time, which means it ends five to 10 minutes after the scheduled time. So if you're talking about driving to this thing, arriving a little bit early, doing the full class when you're done, it's 104 degrees in the room. It's like you jumped into a pool and then you got to let all those parts out that you've been holding the farts out. You've got to take a shower. Um, there's a single shower, wait a minute, what you're like no, cause you were like you came home in her day and you're like, I'm like, cause I, I showered there and I go, all of you shower there.

Speaker 3:          00:08:01       I mean what, what Yoga, I've never heard of a yoga, Yoga, yoga studio, honestly, where you could shower after. I have, I have never heard of it. But you haven't been to a Bikram yoga class. But that's what I'm in. So understanding, but I'm saying that you're like me and the guys, we shower together after and I was like a group shower and you're like, yes, a group shower. And I thought that was a little fishy. The ladies shower too. So everybody showers. Showers. Yeah. I think the only person that I've seen not shower there as Bert because he just gets in his car. Oh wait a minute. Soaking wet, but it's not really a group shower. She fits. This is weird. Yeah. We just hit pause. We're back. Uh, Fitz Simmons just came in fits dog the Great Greg and we were talking off mic. Uh, he's actually a hot Yoga Bikram Yoga

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       practitioner as well. He loves it, right? Isn't it pronounced beek rum? Yeah. Okay. All right. Should I open your mic or no? Yeah, that would be good. Oh, there you are noticing. I can, I can't hear anything because you didn't turn his headphones up, which you return those

Speaker 5:          00:09:09       probably number two. There we go. Yeah. That's good. That's good. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't done it a ton, but I used to do it every year. I went to San Francisco because that's where it kinda started, I think. Yeah. And I would go up and I would do the punch line and I would always go in on Saturday. And do a hot yoga class and uh, you know, so it was once a year, but then I started doing it with a buddy in Venice. They got one in Venice. That's really good. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:09:35       I mean, so I've gone to, I went to my 12th one of the month today. Supposed to 15 right. So I have to go tomorrow's number 13 and then just two more. Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:09:43       Thanks for adding that up. I wasn't sure if team work cause 13 concept and then it goes 1415 that's if you know like all, all right. And you do that off the top of your head. I can just throw another number at me. I'll just say, so you go one and then you get good. Two, three, 408 you started seven Oh yeah, that'll take it out. Right. But Christine's favorite kids joke of all time. That was why. Why is five afraid of six to seven eight, nine, six three to seven because seven ate nine is that it? Yeah. He never red bubble gum wrappers? No. No. And then you can see more of these if you watch was new, special, inferior. It's on Netflix right now. Love dead. Lot of dad jokes

Speaker 4:          00:10:28       to Mary for there to be a group shower after she thinks it's crazy that I shower. I'm like I'm a group shower

Speaker 5:          00:10:35       pool after this now that's what happens. It's a matter of fact, I'd never seen my friend Matt, Matt Molloy. I'd never seen him naked before and I was okay with it because it wasn't like we had just jumped into a cold lake and then we're doing it. This was like I had some nice hang. Sure. I had some Nice puffy flesh Gordon Brown

Speaker 4:          00:10:53       sweating for awhile in there. Yeah I know it's weird cause like we have a, it's a very small locker room and it's a single shower so people have to wait and like some of the guys walk into the shower stall with their shorts on and I'm a dick out guy. Like I, I take it off, I sure I stand naked in the locker room. It's kind of really a separation of like who's have grown up in here, you know, cause like I feel like the, no, I'm serious. It an immigrant. It's the real Russian immigrant style. Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:11:25       yeah. Give a shit. Well it's um, I was a very skinny kid and I had, I hit, I hit puberty at like I was close to 15, I think when I hit. Yeah. So I remember freshman hockey, I used to go, I used to go to practice not making this up. I was so embarrassed to even take my pants off. Did I used to strap my shin guards and put my pants, my hip pants on over my jeans

Speaker 6:          00:11:53       and I would play hockey with my jeans on underneath. That's crazy. Excellent. Cause I was so embarrassed by my twiggy little legs. I hairless twiggy little lag.

Speaker 4:          00:12:01       Really. You thought you're going to be mocked by others like the other kids?

Speaker 6:          00:12:05       I was horrified about my body. And so, and then I would hitch hike home because the rank was like 20 minutes away and it was, this is New York in the wheelchair. I would stand on the side of the highway in January. Drenched wet. Yeah, the we raised. Where were your parents? Had? One of my teachers picked me up on the side of two 87 and they drove me home. It was, it was way out of her way to take me all the way home and then they call my mom the next day and they were like, do you know that I picked your son up hitchhiking last night at nine o'clock until 87 and my mom went like, well, how else was he going to get home? It's like, oh. I picked him up and driven up not only that, never bought me any hockey equipment. I used to bum like old skates off friends and I remember going through the garbage and the locker room and finding broken shin pads and then taping them on with tape.

Speaker 6:          00:12:55       I'd find tape rolls that were thrown out that weren't completely gone and I would use those because they never bought me a piece of sporting equipment and my life and I played sports. How do they not buy you? I meanwhile we had money. That's even worse. That's even worse because my mom grew up, both my parents grew up in the Bronx and they didn't have any money and my mom, especially like my grandparents were from Ireland, they came over here like literally off the boat, nothing. And so my mom grew up with seven brothers and sisters and just like penny pinched and she couldn't, even though my father was in radio and he made good money, she couldn't spend the money. I feel the same way. I know how many, how many kids, how many siblings did you have? A brother and a sister?

Speaker 4:          00:13:38       They're brothers, sisters. Everybody had this experience then that your siblings. Yeah, that's, that's wild. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:13:44       Is this something you guys talk about a lot or no to so many other things to get to? You know, that doesn't, that's at the bottom of the list now. It wasn't that bad. It's a matter of fact, my, my sister has said to my wife, she doesn't get what me and my brother are complaining about so much because she thinks that everything was good and bad, but fine. But isn't that funny? She's the baby. That's why

Speaker 4:          00:14:06       blings though when you talk about the shared experience, I always find that like I have two sisters and I've heard in different, in different scenarios, uh, either one of us having the, you know, the totally different version

Speaker 6:          00:14:21       for you, younger or older. I'm a middle, I'm the middle of the year, the metal. But like I,

Speaker 4:          00:14:25       I think I'm, I'm, I mean I'm the most even tempered of the three to begin with. And then like my version of something we'll always be usually more like a recollection will be like, that was pretty normal. And there's, we're always be like more heightened, more emotional exaggeration of something I'll be like, no, that wasn't it.

Speaker 6:          00:14:45       I think, I think you guys know this as parents, you guys have gone through some pretty major life in the last couple of years and uh, I think you deal with a different set of parents at any given time. And birth order they say has a huge effect on how you're treated. You know, the first one there, they're nervous, they're scared. That kid can be neurotic. They could end up being hyper achieving because there's so much pressure on them and in the middle kid can get lost a little bit because then the younger one gets the, it's the baby we gotta you know, and then the younger one generally gets treated the best, but they also feel the most pressure to not cause any issues there. They tend to be super likable, not have needs.

Speaker 4:          00:15:25       Boy, I think that was me in our family, the middle, cause they were like, the older kid had more like, you know, shit going on and, and acting out and then the baby was the baby and they're like, is the good thing about you is that you're, you're not demanding. Like to me, you know, they were like, that's the great thing about you is that you're a nice kid. Easy to deal with you. You're not causing us anyway.

Speaker 6:          00:15:47       Yeah. And I was like, look, you right in the eye when they say it. Yeah, you're nice. Everybody likes you stay without causing any problems, which keep grades. Okay. You don't get drunk and you're just taking it all in. Good. Those are my marching orders. Of course. Yes.

Speaker 4:          00:16:01       And I don't think they consciously realize that they're telling you to do that. You know, I think they think part of them thinks like they're just like telling you how it is that they're actually telling you what to do.

Speaker 6:          00:16:12       Yeah. You know, I don't know if they processed that at the time. Um, I think subconsciously you tell your kids a lot and I'm starting to become more aware of that because my kids are so different. My son is like boom, straight A's, captain of the soccer team, captain of the club, soccer team, girlfriend, steady friends. I'm the nicest, most even keeled. Like I literally couldn't tell you what I would change about this kid. And then sometimes I wonder, am I, is he being that way? Because we're subtly demanding that of him. Right. Oh, right. Because he's almost too good, right? Yeah. And you're not aware of it. Obviously. You know, you don't know until later when your kids tell you that you were a bad parent. God, there's no way you were bad. You weren't bad. I go, I travel. I feel like maybe that has an effect on them.

Speaker 6:          00:17:01       You may have gone every other weekend, but your wife is there. Right. So somebody's got a full time mom for 17 years, so somebody is always there. Same with Tom and I, we take turns traveling, but one of us is always there. Yeah, I think that's the key, right? No, we don't both. And don't let your kids hitchhiked. Don't you love how that, that's this, that's that far gender people hitchhiked. I grew up here in the San Fernando Valley. I just saw some, uh, like a grown man who's doing that? Who's doing that? Fuck. Are you doing? I hitchhiked. I used to, I used to work as a caddy at a golf course that was like 15 minutes away. And I used to get up at like six o'clock in the morning and I would get on the road and I would hitchhike to work. And then I would caddy like two loops. I was like 14 years old and I would carry two loops. Two giant. I told you I

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       was skinny. I was, yeah. And then I would, uh, hitchhike home. Who would pick up cause you got, you got a bunch of rides. So sometimes it took a long time. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:17:58       Was it, um, questionable people picking you up usually or,

Speaker 6:          00:18:02       I never had a bad experience. Not once. Nope. My friend Pete, who is my best friend, we hitchhiked together a lot. Yeah. And uh, he had a guy, he went, he went to school in the Bronx and so he had a guy pick them up, two different guys twice picked him up that were jerking off. Wow. Yeah. I could see that happening a lot. But yeah. For guys, here's the crazy thing about this whole, um, uh,

Speaker 5:          00:18:28       what's his name? Harvey Weinstein thing. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:18:31       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:18:32       And not to, you know, and you had some very interesting opinions on it when Ya, thank Christina did my podcast the other day and I thought you had some very brave takes on it. Me Meetings. She would blow up

Speaker 5:          00:18:42       hi. PHRYGIA and her husband would encourage her. Yeah. That's a story. Not even scarring. I mean, if it's a big enough fell, that's what I'm saying. Yeah. Like a big Hollywood movie to show me the deck film for some film. Kidding. Yeah. Guy. If a guy your deal, that's not a big one. I needed a ride and he gave you that ride still. I wouldn't mind if that's what I'm saying. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. And so I know a comedian who was kind of mentored by another comedian. Huh.

Speaker 6:          00:19:11       And uh, the older comedian brought him over his apartment one night and he jr he just started jerking off

Speaker 5:          00:19:18       the front of them and the guy just left and he fucking still considers him like a mentor still. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just like, all right, so the, the Guy Jerks. It's, it's almost like, you know, I believe me, I'm not belittling the Harvey Weinstein thing or anybody need to even say what I'm in the middle of saying no. But I think

Speaker 4:          00:19:38       is funny thing about guys is like guys forgiving guys doing like guys can also feel like somebody could act violently, right? Yeah. Uh, a man and a woman be like, I'm gonna stay away from that guy for the rest of my life. And a guy can act violently and in front of another guy, like a friend I was saying, and he'll still like, he'll get over, he'll be like, oh, I have fist fights with like a, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:20:03       you guys externalize your anger. He, you know, he punched a hole in that wall and broke that guy's job. But like, yeah, he's a good guy. No, we don't do, I used to fist fights with my close friends and we would get over it. I mean, it would take a week. Yeah. And then we'd be over it. Yeah. Yeah. But I hear stories about guys jerking off in front of each other too, like sleepover parties. When you're a, you've heard those stories, like, I never heard those stories. My guy friends were like, yeah, we used to have sleeping bags and we'd sleep on either side of the bed and we'd watch some movie. And then we both jerkbait that's me. Sarah, you did that? Yeah. No, I used to go over, across the street.

Speaker 4:          00:20:37       Uh, my friend's house, I won't say his name but, but we would, uh, he would have, you know, everyone be sleeping bags and then we would put it on the spice channel. But spice didn't come in. You would, it would snow. You're right. And

Speaker 5:          00:20:47       then you'd get like some, some get a random, I'll get a random shot and then everyone, no one would be like, hey check me out. But everyone will be like humping the floor or like you could, you could feel, you know, all the wrestling and the sleeping bags and then people would be like, and then we're like 10, 11, and then everyone pass out. And that was like a sleepover on like a Friday, Saturday night for a year or two that was happening all the time. Never talked about when talked about it was, yeah. It wasn't like people have, cause it was at the age of like starting to do that. In other words, it's not like you're 15, 16, you've been doing it for awhile. It was like 10, 11 years old. So it, you wouldn't even know earlier here hit puberty. Like I said, I guess that was 21.

Speaker 5:          00:21:30       I was pouring Greg, I mean 15 years old. And that kicks in like did you have some kind of pituitary thing or why? I don't know. I don't know. I'm just like, I'm not even, I didn't have hair for a long time and uh, you know, I've kind of a high voice. I'm a, I'm a feminine man and what I've always tried to overcompensate, you're really not. But I've always tried to overcompensate by being tough and being aggressive, like a little cocky, sharp tongue, still sharp tongue. But you know, that's all hiding. Uh, you know, your early years of having a shame with my body.

Speaker 4:          00:22:02       Um, and our high school, so I switched high schools and when I arrive at high school, I'm a freshman so I switched her my freshman year and after the first football practice, I'm a, I'm a freshman but I'm playing with, you know, I'm on the Varsity team cause we're, we're doing a spring ball, so I'm playing for the first time in spring football on the varsity team. So people are getting after practice, taking their pads and their stuff off. And I noticed all the guys going into the shower with their boxers on and like, it's so weird. So what happens is nobody wanted to shower naked, but why? Just they were just, it was, I dunno, but here's the thing, like I'm a freshman, so I came from, I switched from a school where everybody was showering naked because it's a shower. But since I, I switched and there's upperclassmen wearing boxers in the shower. I just kept my boxers on too. Because you didn't want to be the person who's insisting on being naked. Yeah. So people showered with their boxers on and then took their boxers off once they had a towel around them.

Speaker 4:          00:23:11       And this is, this is like, I'm 14 and these are like 1718 year old guys shower, showering in their boxers. You think

Speaker 5:          00:23:21       actually the shower that the most integral part of the shower is the asshole on the ball said, right? Yeah. And those boxes are so football boxers, like you just ran around and just, you know, it's just gnarly, man. Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

Speaker 4:          00:23:36       Nobody except for like, by the time I was a senior, the one kid who we suspected was gay and definitely turned out to be gay, was walking around without that was it?

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       That was the only kid. It's like you're black. And he had a big fucking Dick on him too, so he was like, Hey, what's up? It's out here.

Speaker 6:          00:23:52       I've spent so little time around naked guys at the Friar's club. I used to belong to the Friar's Club in New York. Yeah. And they have the best steam room in New York City. It's like this old marble and a, this is going to sound crazy, but I swear to God, this is true. You go in and it's so old school Jewish that when you walk in, you put on a towel and you sit down and then this, this Yugoslavian guy comes in, this old Yugoslavian guy and he brings you ice water and a towel that's been dunked in ice. And he hands it to you. And so you sit there and it's completely balls. Once you get in there, it's balls out. Yeah. Yeah. And so it's all these old dudes. And their sacs are like hanging over the bench and down towards the floor. Yeah. There, you know, the PDC can't tell if they have a big penis or it just melted.

Speaker 6:          00:24:37       His skin is flopping over Fishkin and gravity and life has just written on these bodies and these splotches of hairs, sometimes you don't even have they shaved or did the hair just fall out? Yeah. And so, and so you finished with the shower and then you walk to the Shah, you finished with the steam and you walk to the shower and they have these giant fucking marble sided showers with, um, with a man hole covers size, shower head on it. And it blasts like a thousand gallons a second. You feel, it's like, it's like being in a civil rights riot. This German shepherds barking underneath the seat and then you shout and then you, uh, and then I would jerk off a lot, not because I just saw this Dick's just because I was I 22, and I was just jerking off all the time. Sure. And so I would jerk off and then uh, I would come out and the Yugoslavian guy would wait for you and you have a dry towel and he would put it around your shoulders and then he would pat you dry your neck and your arms and your back then your butt and your legs and your feet.

Speaker 6:          00:25:42       He would pat. Is that, is that yes.

Speaker 5:          00:25:44       And your peer that yes, it is. So in Hungary, that guy, oh, a tip every day when you leave. Yeah, it's normal. And Hungary, there's the thermal baths. It because the Turks were in Hungary at some point and so they have a, the, you know, famous Miguel air and hotel and you, you get buck naked and, and yeah, someone pats you down, they're very hands on. They can be very hands on, don't you dare get a massage at the Gellert cause that's like, you know, your, your buck naked. And then like the Big Lady, we'll open the curtain and like people will be walking by and you're just getting slapped and slathered with that soap. It's, it's, they're not as squeamish as Americans are about the body. Definitely. Yeah. I think the Irish are very squeamish. I think it's probably a Catholic thing. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I've, I've always, yeah, it took me a long time. I'm not, I'm still not comfortable with my body, but should we get naked? You want to look good naked? I'll do hot yoga with you. I'm at right now. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. And then we'll do hot yoga because it's going to get hot. I'll tell you after having

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       a kid, I don't give a shit. And I think it's because you, when you give birth you're wide open. And like I was pushing Ellis out as I was pushing, the nurses had a shift change, so it was like five new people got to see my coach. No, but yeah, like I don't care. I'm done. My body is a functional thing. Yeah. Like I don't feel weird about it.

Speaker 6:          00:27:05       Yeah. I think I feel less weird than I used to. You know, like I, uh, I used to bench press a lot because that was how I overcame being skinny. He's like in college I actually got kind of, not big, but you know bigger. And the worst thing about that is then you get older and you, your tits ball might have yeah. And, and the, and you know, and it's just so fucking embarrassing to the point where you get so embarrassed that you stopped being embarrassed. Right? Yeah. You just let go into it. Yeah, that's right. Surrender. Surrender to your ugly, Shitty Yadie

Speaker 4:          00:27:35       and that's what you end up. It's funny cause you had your party admirers. I do like the notably flawed person who really doesn't care. You know what I mean? And then you're like, I want to be like that. And then sometimes you become like that and you're like, oh I'm back. You're like, I just don't care anymore Bobby Lee. Well and if you can notice if you, if you go on vacation or to any ocean or pool, most people

Speaker 6:          00:27:58       we'll have shitty bodies. That's right. Yeah, that's right. It's a small section that I'm good. And when I do see them, I think I'm glad I'm looking at their body, but I think to myself, how much time and work went into their life this moment. Yeah. Yeah. This, yeah. You know, how many moments do people get to see their body?

Speaker 4:          00:28:16       Like when we saw a perfect dad and that last vacation, he's a perfect day saw perfect dad fucking like Swedish Donnis for sculpted, just everything. But the V fucking the lower, you know, the lower ab, right. Good feet holding one kid and walk with the other world, like beautiful motherfucker. Get the time to do it, to work out with him. And his wife was like, okay, it like an okay shape, but this dude was just, I mean he looked, I was like, I bet this guy's an Olympian. Yeah. That's the type of build he had. Yeah. But like he stood out amongst hundreds, like everybody else was dog shit.

Speaker 6:          00:28:52       Yeah. Well, how do you feel with the body change that you've just gone through? I mean, do you feel like you want to go out on the beach and show people your body now? No,

Speaker 4:          00:28:59       I think it's, you know, it's different. I was actually telling someone about it. It's like you change happens with, with like with your weight and everything slowly. Yeah. And I think it just, you kind of get, it reinforces to you like, oh, like this still sucks pretty badly. Like my body, I'll be like, oh, like you're still, you're still pretty fat and it's been, a lot of weight is gone. But then I always try to remind myself of like how getting out of shape actually took a long time because what happens is like when you're, when you're in it, when you really are like really eating well and working out, it can be frustrating when you just, some random day you're like, I eaten poorly in a month and I've done nothing but work out. And um, and you just see like you're fat shitty flaws and you're like, that sucks.

Speaker 4:          00:29:49       But then you go like, yeah, but to get out of shape, it wasn't like I ate three bad meals, you know what I mean? It was neglect and sitting and eating shitty food for years to, to put on that weight. So yeah, a month or two months or six months is not going to be like all that, all that bad shit is gone. It takes a long, long time. Yeah. Yeah. But I think, I mean with me like I definitely don't feel like, Oh wow, this is like, I joke around, you know, like I know t's Bert and uh, you know, but like I know I feel like I'm in

Speaker 5:          00:30:21       terrible. You Look Great Tommy. I compliment you. And every day you do, you look great. Well thanks. So hands on your face will be so different. Your body looks fantastic, I think. I mean, you look great heavy. Thankfully. I like you both ways. I like skinny. Yeah, you definitely tolerated that. Tolerate it. Okay. How about your body? You sucked off the, the mom you weight fast. Do you think? Yeah, you look good. I dropped out. Yeah. I got real fat now. You know, you just don't eat carbs or sugar or have fun. No alcohol, suffering. It's just you have to suffer. That's just it. Yeah. There's no easy way. Right? You just suffer. Well, I guess it's a matter of like your palate. I think for some people you get addicted to carbs and so the withdraw from carbs and sugars is very intense, intense. And I think for some people they just were never that into carbs. So it's not that big a deal. When I think about, yeah, I've had, I not even going to say out loud what I want to say. Why? Well No, I should, because I can tell you how horrifying it was to be that skinny when I was little. I literally eat anything that I want.

Speaker 4:          00:31:23       Yeah, no, I get it man up. But everyone had like, I don't know man. I, everyone has their own issue with different things. Yeah. So it's like I've never had the, for me it's definitely food and I definitely was eating a cray, like I was thinking about once you make a transition and for a while you're conscious of your eating and you go, how I used to eat was so insane. Yeah. Well let me see his comedian. Oh yeah. And like what about like eating with normal people and, and like they would, you know, they would like a regular person would see one of my meals as like an indoor, like a vacation meal, I guess we'll do this today. And I'd be like, I do this every day. Like I always do. And like I would eat just like with, I just no regard for her.

Speaker 5:          00:32:13       Give me like a regular meal at a restaurant. What you would order like an appetizer and entree and a dessert.

Speaker 4:          00:32:18       Hundred percent. Yeah. And like, and, and maybe like order, another thing that like, I just want to try that and, and like another entree or aside maybe both. No Shit. But I wouldn't even, like I wouldn't fucking even process it. And like I would have, if I was on the road, I would have breakfast, I would have something like rich and fatty, then I would be like, I gotta have something sweet. So I have like a waffle. And then like, if they're like, have you seen this bakery that has like, bib, amazing croissants, I'd be like, let's go. Let's go try it. Yeah. I mean I think I'm going to throw ups was wait like an hour and then when I'm done, like once it digests, like I just wouldn't, I wouldn't think that, I wouldn't even think it was that much of an indulgence. I would think of normal Tommy.

Speaker 4:          00:33:01       We used to at our old house and a bag in Redondo last time we saw you, we used to make brownies. I would, I would bake brownies like every night, every night, and then we would eat like half the tray nice and hot, put some ice cream on that. And I'm like, well no wonder, you know, we got, and here's the other thing before I, I always forget this, before we invited the public to shame us about being fat, like Burt and I specifically, and we did this weight loss challenge. Yeah, Dude. When I would post things on social media, maybe one out of 400 comments would be about being fat. Nobody would say anything to me. Nobody was like, you're one person might, you know, you're like, oh, this guy's a dick.

Speaker 5:          00:33:45       Well because you're built to be fat bill. I have a big fat. Yes, true. What a great thing to say. You're right. It's true. Are built to be. So

Speaker 4:          00:33:53       it would just be like, it's fine. Yeah. Built to be fat. That's a good name for a special actually tee shirts shot. I just shot it in this special and I submitted the title, but I think it might change. It took the break

Speaker 5:          00:34:11       built to be fat. He's got the face for it and you've got a big head. Shoulders are broad. You had a beard into that. Forget it. You know what I might do? Put on a hundred pounds and have another special called built to be fun where it's like I put it all back on, right? Well, yeah. I mean, uh, um, what's her name? Got Pregnant again to do her next special Allie. You know, people are gonna say that too. Oh, she did it again. Yeah, but it's a ticking clock. She's got to get the special done, you know? I mean, how old's the other baby or babies like to, oh, it's two already heard her baby's going to be too, right, right. Yeah. She's uh, she's so fucking funny. She's a great person. Good. Yeah, she's really sweet. Um, so, okay, so I have a gift for you guys because you know, you, um, when you had the baby and uh, Christina reminded me of this when I came on, I got you guys a, uh, uh, a white, uh, genie was a white or like a warm, which by the way has become our go to gift for.

Speaker 5:          00:35:25       That's great. When we think of it as like, oh, this is what a comic should get. Yes. Yes. And it's like, you know, when you think about a baby and you think about how little control they have about joy and all that stuff, a hot on the asshole

Speaker 6:          00:35:38       is the best. It's just every single time it would put the baby in a good mood.

Speaker 3:          00:35:42       Yeah. Yup. And by God, if you're about to give me a notebook full of jokes, I'm super appreciative because I have, I need a new hour and I really,

Speaker 6:          00:35:50       well you remember that Greg, do you remember that movie field of dreams? If you build it they will come. Yes. It's an empty notebook. Ah, but here's what it is. Is this book right here? Look in this. This is what I, we kept since the start. Cause how old is your kid now? Nine months.

Speaker 3:          00:36:05       No, he's almost two year olds to shut the fuck up. Yeah, he's almost too God

Speaker 6:          00:36:12       damn. All right. So I might be a little late with this but not too late. We started this, somebody gave us this one when the, when our first kid started talking and it's, you write down every quote, every cute thing that they say are meaningful thing and we've got it for years. Oh and uh, so I got you guys the same book. Have you been keeping? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:36:33       record of that. I opened up an email account for Ellis when he was born and we email him, we sent him photos, photos and stuff. But this is direct quotes of things. Then you know, we'll, we'll, we'll say like today we did this. Yeah. And like you said that. All right. All right. This is fantastic. Thank you.

Speaker 6:          00:36:52       I brought mine so I could read you a couple of good ones that my kids, it's sad.

Speaker 3:          00:36:57       We'll start, we've got to show that one. Yeah. Yeah. This is special because it's handwritten from Mommy and Daddy. That is very nice. Very special. You know how much like, cause I was going to read this like as we get and I'm 38 and like I have, you know, every year like your appreciation and your relationship with your parents changed. Yeah. Like if I was my eight, like right now reading this that my parents wrote, yeah. I have such an impact.

Speaker 6:          00:37:25       Oh, already know this thing is dogeared because my kids, uh, there, there are 17 and 14, like to sit around and read this. Oh, there's nothing kids when they're adolescents, like more than to see pictures of themselves and hear what they were like, they love stories about themselves because they don't know who they are yet. Right, right, right. And they think it's hysterical when, when you show them that they were cute. Um, all right. Uh Oh. And what was tired? And he said, um, mommy more snores please. Do you want to take a nap? Oh, I, that's like so and uh, he said, wait, let me find a good one. Oh, this was the, the quote that we still quote almost constantly. We were in the airport and we're flying from New York back to La and we had to get up super early and Owen was three ish and he was cranky and we've got some breakfast, but we tried to give them good food. So we tried to find oatmeal, we couldn't find it. And so we ended up having a buy him a chocolate muffin. And so we give it to when he was so excited, he was like shaking. And then we said, but you can't eat the whole thing. And I took the top off. I said, you just eat the part that's in the thing. And he goes, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:38:38       you don't know all the rules about,

Speaker 6:          00:38:44       and to this day we constantly say, you don't know all the rules about whatever it is they were talking. Oh, that's adorable. Tell me if this is too corny. I just thought it would be, no, we love it. I'm going to do this for an email. Um, because he just started talking. He just started really

Speaker 7:          00:39:01       run your finger along the crack of your ass. You don't need to figure your whole, you don't want to come back with shit on your finger.

Speaker 6:          00:39:07       And he was for, Jeez, this is Owen. When he was, uh, six, uh, I was carrying out a plate of fresh cut pineapple and he said, come on Daddy, let's go eat some heaven. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah. Um, I liked, I think my favorite thing too is that he enjoys reading this, but that's really good. Yeah. Um, this is Jo Jo when she was about, uh, six violence. Mom, her mom, her friend's black. My father's mom has really curly hair and wide fingernails, but that's okay because she's an extremely nice person.

Speaker 1:          00:39:46       Awesome. Fantastic.

Speaker 6:          00:39:52       Am I qualifying it? You know, but that's okay. Yeah. Yeah. You know, he wasn't nothing. He not a race. She was not a racist kid, but you know. Yeah. Black and white is black and white for sure. And then this is another black and white one. Um, this is Owen before watching a Michael Jackson video. Is he going to be black or white in this one? And then after watching the video, he said I like his hair better after the fire. Oh Man. He was already slinging. Um, um, uh, then this is Joe Joe, the first week of school when she was in kindergarten. Everyone at school is always having fights to play with me. I hate myself because it's like I'm starting wars. So when you want to hear these, you guys would just run to the notebook. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We should keep it in like the kitchen or something. Yeah. And then, um, she had like, all of her friends were black for some reason growing up. Maybe it's because we live in a really poor neighborhood now. We live in Venice, so there's a lot of like diversity. But she says, Mommy, why do I like all the dark ones the best?

Speaker 1:          00:41:10       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:41:10       Oh Man, that is so fun. And this was a, here's a little one. Act play after Jay. My kids make fun of me going bald constantly. It's their Goto. Thanks Dale. Now. Oh yeah. Yeah, but this is when they were really little. Yeah. A judge who was making fun of my hair falling out and then Owen said, don't listen to Joe, Joe Teasing you. And I said, thanks Owen. And he went, you're welcome baldy.

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       Right. I'm not going to keep reading because I have no idea if this is annoying. It's really, really horrible. Yeah, we're going to do it. Thank you for that. Yeah. I remember that. Wanting to learn who I was and what I was like. The thing is that you feel like it's true. It's like it gives you, it gives you a sense of identity to know what you were like, you know? Because our memories are so selective. I mean, I read this thing about interviewing I witnesses for jury pools and not your pulls for eye witnesses for, for trials. And our ability to truly remember what happened is like 0.1%. It's like, you know when and when you're talking about your childhood with all the emotions that go around it and you hear other people telling the story about you. So it's really their version of who you were.

Speaker 5:          00:42:25       And so to have the actual quote from them shows them as close to you as you can get to who they really are. And especially when my daughter's racist story is, is um, is something positive, like a positive quality. I think where if you're in that age where maybe you're, you know, I don't know, you're, maybe you're a young teen and you're shy and you're not sure of yourself and they tell and you hear a story about you being a little kid doing something where you were assertive. You know, it's like, it gives you confidence. Yes. You go like, oh, like who I really am is the story you're telling. You know, it changes. It changes the way you feel about yourself. Precise. My parents saw me a story when I was a kid because I grew up with a lot of black kids too, and there was a kid with the blacks. There was a kid who invited me to his birthday party and then I found out that he didn't invite our friends. His name is Yemi, a wallaby. He was from Africa, didn't invite Yummy and so I said to the kid who was like my best friend, but his mother didn't want Yemi there. I said I wouldn't go to the party and I was only like seven. He's not going on. I'm like, cause I figured then the musical sock and nobody can dam.

Speaker 5:          00:43:39       I went to high school with a kid named [inaudible] obituary who, damn. Yeah, he was at for, it's funny, I was asking my dad to reminisce when I give birth to Alice. I was like, Dad, look what was I like? How much did I weigh when I was born? He goes, I don't know normal. I'm his only child like you. You do remember the one right? Just normal car. Remember the time? No, no, no, it was it where they did. They have a lot of pictures of, you know, Friday my mom put together an album. Yeah, you must've been a cute little kid. Was really attractive. Yeah. God really? Qut. The pictures. Oh I got real dark. What was that like 1213 and the darkness and the darkness came over. Let me ask you this because this is good to know. My daughter now that she's 14 is going into that place where she comes in the front door and is in a room very quickly and you don't see her except for dinner and you know she's actually very sweet but she can be pissy towards my wife.

Speaker 5:          00:44:46       When does that end and are you, were you aware that you were doing that and did you feel bad about it later? Oh, I don't feel bad about it because I was hiding from my family. I didn't like being around them. Yeah. My, my family is different than what you guys had by far. Like what you have rather. A lot of it is high school drama. Did she just start high school? Yeah. Yeah. So I think a lot of it is like what happened at school and she might be talking to her girlfriends about it like, oh my God, and then he did this or we did that. Like you're analyzing a lot of what happened to you if you're going to break down the dad's. Cool. Yeah. So that could be, I think that's really, it's, it's like this girl world that you inhabit at that age. So it ends when you start to realize you're not the center and like it doesn't matter. Like by 16 I think you're like, oh, I'm not the only human around and mom and dad are not that bad. Quick to get out of it to page 17

Speaker 4:          00:45:36       my two sisters were really bad my senior year. Really bad. Yeah. I'm saying like with like kind of being rude and Shitty to my parents and they were over it before high school ended. Yeah. And they did feel bad and felt even worse later once they had kids before even having kids, like once you're like in your 20s, they, they would feel like really guilty about how shitty their attitudes were. Yeah. Yeah. Like they feel really bad because like, they were like, you know, like super embarrassed of them and like just like era and they were just

Speaker 5:          00:46:11       oh yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:46:12       Snapping all the time. Yeah. You're like, what the fuck man? Like she's in ninth grade.

Speaker 5:          00:46:18       She's in ninth grade. Yeah. That's a hard year. Ninth Grade, the first year of high school. So it's like this huge leap into becoming a teenager. Like a legit teenagers.

Speaker 4:          00:46:27       Yeah. Well this device the way make you feel bad. Let you show me this. Uh, this, uh, we, we were sent this video, this lady, um, she, she and her boyfriend were asked to leave a bus and then, um, she didn't want to leave the

Speaker 1:          00:46:39       bus, so the police are outside the class. Then she spit towards the cop. She said, no, no, you're not

Speaker 4:          00:47:00       her boyfriend. Well, her boyfriend is trying to get this is the boyfriend is trying to get her off, like trying to get the policemen to not arrest her just by repeating that she's retarded. So she's not accountable but

Speaker 5:          00:47:13       oh I didn't hear that.

Speaker 1:          00:47:21       Oh she's retarded. I told you tango started just retarded.

Speaker 5:          00:47:30       And did you see the PC police step in and go mentally disabled? Don't even pop was saying that. No, it's another bus rider is like for seniors, the word is developmentally disabled and uh, he continues like route as they bring her off the bus.

Speaker 8:          00:47:54       Oh No,

Speaker 5:          00:48:02       she, she's not developmentally, he's correcting the guy that's trying to help her. That's clearly her guardian. Right? Yeah. Right. Speaking of which,

Speaker 3:          00:48:12       um, oh, we're doing a benefit, Christina, and I think you're out of town. I remember eighth at the comedy store for the best buddies. That's cool.

Speaker 3:          00:50:10       all the podcasts, the most amazing song submission. So last week, oh, that was made specifically for your show? No, no, no, no. So, but we know that like, whenever we play, like, you know, like we play like she's retarded clip. Yeah. Like someone will make a song out of that and like some of them are legit song production people, you

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       know, they'll just,

Speaker 1:          00:50:30       there we go. Here we go. She said sort of classic terminator. Yeah. Got It. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:50:58       So that was got to Yaddo tuned them

Speaker 1:          00:51:06       16

Speaker 5:          00:51:10       those came in. I've been having machines within, it's stuck in my head. Oh, last with ready. Catchy though. Right? That's just like a vibrator store. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:51:21       It, uh, it's incredible. And more machines within came in. Here's a gun. Yeah. Nadir Gun. Let's see what this one is here.

Speaker 1:          00:51:38       Wow. This is the Max. Incredible. That's amazing. This is a, by the way, this is

Speaker 5:          00:51:57       sounds good. Genes within metal by machine

Speaker 1:          00:51:59       genes play made a real,

Speaker 5:          00:52:03       there was a bit like he put a band together and

Speaker 4:          00:52:06       no. So what happens is like, okay, so for like the first few, what happened was people took the audio that we played with this guy walking down the street, just got machines within and they created, uh, a song out of that. In other words, they, they looped in beats and then they, and they made a song out of it. This one right here, I don't know if on that one right there, they actually sang it themselves or whether they distorted it or not. I don't know. It's pretty. And, but like this guy right here just submitted this also.

Speaker 5:          00:52:36       So here's a little different take on machines. I mean, it's going to be the full corrosion on it. A big fans. So you got, so Tom and Cindy, um, and it was an amazing time. We kept seeing machines within all day. So I just kind of like in my head. So hope you enjoy it.

Speaker 4:          00:52:54       Yep.

Speaker 9:          00:52:56       Oh, I was right. Good. Jesus.

Speaker 3:          00:53:44       that's amazing. That's my pick. And they both work. Yeah. That's the thing. These guys found a way to make the song work. It's all about the producer man. Gotta find your deep. Do you guys put out an album once a year? No.

Speaker 8:          00:53:56       Let's do a Christmas production. The second guy stalling before an oral exam. This is a

Speaker 3:          00:56:14       no, it's great. In joke writing, you really got to make your premise clear and that's what he does with songs. He's like, Chris rock really sets it up. Yup. Here's what the song's

Speaker 3:          00:57:29       Do you think you could do live? Do you think you'd do a live show? I think if you could book him as your opener is what you're saying. I mean like do you think it could handle it? It's a good five minutes. That's a solid five. Try to get him to shut up. Once you're on

Speaker 5:          00:57:40       stage though.

Speaker 3:          00:58:24       That is a no chase with that song. Thank you know chase. Thanks everybody is sending in your machines within remixes. Those were really good. Looking forward to, she's retarded songs next week. They're really good. This guy does have a gift for the idea though. I'm saying this Juggalos. Yeah, he does have a gift of putting together like silly things. Silly, catchy. He could write jingles. Maybe you know he could write for the insane clown posse. Maybe that's quite a leap put on with the, Jimmy wants his dick and that, oh, Jimmy Ivy. No. Right. Did you watch that? Um, defiant ones on HBO about Jimmy Iovine and Dr Dre. Like a four [inaudible] it's so good, man. Their story, Jimmy, I've been story is just bananas. It's so, it's, it's, it's insane what like how he got into being a record producer, you know, he was like cleaning up a studio for a job, like after hours,

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       like just mopping. Right. And then they're like, do you know how to run a board? Yeah. And he was like, no. And then a guy shows them how to run a board. That's amazing. And it's just like, and athlete like one thing into the next and then he's sitting there like engineering a Springsteen album. Wow. And then, uh, he tells a story about it. That's right. Yes. He talks about it. This book. It's wild. Yeah. And then how about, uh, I think it was Ivan. He's Catholic and it was like an Easter where there, one of the guys was like, you need to come that we need you to hear today. He's like, it's Easter Sunday. And the guy was like, fucking come to the studio. And his family was like, come on, you're not leaving on this. He's, he's young. He's like in his early 20. [inaudible] and he goes in and it's for, uh, it's a Lennon session. Wow. Yeah. So he's sitting there like, he's like, I just said Fuck Easter. Yeah. And just, he was a,

Speaker 6:          01:00:11       Oh, that's amazing. He didn't know. He just went in. He was telling me to come in and do one in. Yeah. Damn, that's the thing. I always tell young people now that you hit a certain age and you talked to a lot of young people about, you know, everybody wants advice. And we went and, and it's, it's hard because if you catch me on a bad day, and this has happened, I've taught kids out of going into show business, my friend Tom asked me to talk to his son, um, and, uh, he wanted to go into comedy writing and I read his scripts and it was okay. It was okay. And in this business, it's got to not just be good. It's gotta be excellent. And it's gotta be original. There has to be like, you know, like somebody, a SPEC script, it gets traction in this town is like somebody will take a partridge family episode from 1971 and then they'll put in uh, isis as like, you have to come up with shit. That's crazy. And then on top of it be so well written and so, and I just said to him, I go, look man, you got a college degree. Does just, there's so many other things to do. And his father who's black got really upset with me. He's like, dude, what did you fucking tell my son? And I was like, I'm sorry man. It was a bad day. It was a bad day for them.

Speaker 4:          01:01:27       I totally get that. I, you know what I did once this is, I mean like I don't think I did the wrong thing. I picked the wrong time was I told a comic who was booked by a club that was emceeing to not do so much crowd work. Oh that, well I told him cause he was doing it every show. Yeah. And, um, it was like Saturday between the first and late show where I go, look, man, I go, someone's going to tell you, someone's going to tell you this at some point. And like, you should know that like when you're on a headliner show like this, like you really don't, it shouldn't be up to you to just decide to do 10 minutes of crying. And he was like, what? And I go, I'm telling you this to, uh, to be rude, but like you're, you're basically dictating that. Like that's the tone of what they're about to see. You're not, you're actually making it, it's not even really fucking up my show, but it's like the Middle Act, who on this hierarchy is definitely above you, is now like putting this thing where he's like, has to adapt to your crowd. Right.

Speaker 6:          01:02:30       Exactly. Not only that, now you meet you in the feature. I'd have to watch him every shell to see you so you don't talk to the same people he's talking.

Speaker 4:          01:02:38       It's, so I, I did it in like a nice way. Yeah. But man that he was shell shocked and I couldn't tell right away. He went up there and bombed. And then afterwards, like, you know, I, I didn't say much to him after his set, but after the show he was like, I go, dude, like somebody was going to tell you that and they might not have even been as nice about it as I was. I said, well, you think you can just get on like fucking bill birds show and just be like, Ma, I'm just going to do fucking Crowdwork. Yeah, go, you can't do that shit. And he was like, really? I go, it's not like this was like a showcase thing. Do what you want, you know, was 20 comics going up? Fine. They go, but like this is not that show. This is a weekend show. And um, he was like, ah, I guess, you know, I just, um, I guess you telling me like two minutes before I went up Kinda threw me off was like, sorry, I felt bad. I felt bad about the timing of it. I was like, yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:03:37       it's powerful for a young comic to hear from a, you know a legend.

Speaker 4:          01:03:41       Yeah. Yeah. Will you go, will you tell, especially if you tell him like right, if someone tells you something, right. There was, I was,

Speaker 6:          01:03:47       well I, I always do this thing when I'm on the road and I don't know when I started doing it, but every time the MC and sometimes I, I've met the emcee for two enough to get my, my intro, cause if it's the first night, I just haven't spent time with them and I always will go. He'll go, Greg Fitzsimmons and I come up and then when he shakes your hand, when he walks off, I was go, thanks faggot. And then I do my set and I never talk about it. And then the next time I go up I'll go, thanks homo. And I just keep saying thanks cock sucker. And I do it each time and they never bring it up. And then this one guy comes up to me Saturday night between shows. He's like, he goes, did I do something? Goes did I do, did I go long? I keep thinking that I did that bit. That's similar to yours and his, did that make you mad? He, he was going through and what I would, it could be. I go, no dude, I do that to everybody. I never, I never imagined anybody would take it as anything, but it's,

Speaker 4:          01:04:39       yeah, of course, of course. I can imagine though, if you're that guy, the anxiety he probably had the next day. He was probably like, I thought it was a good show, but I can tell me me a faggot,

Speaker 6:          01:04:51       it's done. He goes, there's a, cause that guy, I was doing crowd work with that guy and I kinda like backed down and I thought that maybe that's why you kept calling me that and it's like I didn't have the heart to tell him. I didn't watch all of his sets, you know?

Speaker 4:          01:05:04       Oh man, that's the other one is when they, um, sometimes they are like Saturday, the be like, you see the set and I go, no, not once. That's a whole week. You guys are terrible people. And then I'm like, I just, I,

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       I can't do it then. I don't want to watch. It's hard because sometimes if I watch the feature and he's got, he's got a bit that's really close to mind. It depresses me because I realize this kid is in Oklahoma and he's a feature and he and we're thinking the same joke. So I don't even care if we repeat a similar joke like I used to watch so I didn't repeat a joke and now he just figured it's more detrimental to even know through that comedy is this easy and I think it's so hard. Right? And then you're like that guy's name when that good. I know that too where you're like that's one of my, that's a good as an original thought or thought at the time. Like damn. And I found when lightning in a bottle, it's depressing. I thought it went today actually when I was on the toilet and I wrote it on my phone, which is Yelp is essentially like you can tell a lot, cause I was yelping um, hot water heaters.

Speaker 5:          01:06:09       We need a new hot water heater and you just see the range of opinions that people can have about a piece of hardware and that you know, you know any given case a factory worker didn't put a nut on or didn't it so it doesn't make the company evil, it just means that there's a variance in quality of thanks but it becomes like a roar shack test for the person that's doing the reviewing and it's always like this hot water heater makes me feel lonely and someone else is like this thing gets me laid as true. So I want to put really innocuous things on Yelp and just see how people like friendship see on people. How do you yell at Friends House? That's true because it is one big projection. Your experience of something and like the particular form of rejection and you can always look for the negative and something or you can look for the positive. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:07:00       we've been up by the way we've emailed, we put out there a bunch of these questions originally we put out I think like how to, what blind people know when they're done wiping. And then blind people would write in and tell us how to deaf people. Wake up in the morning. And then last week we asked about how to cop a lot of dumb questions. Just trying to see now how do cops, um, handcuff a one arm guy? Like when they have a one arm guy,

Speaker 5:          01:07:26       here's your answer. We go, we got the answer.

Speaker 3:          01:07:29       Hey Mommy's, I'm a police officer on the east coast. I'm explaining to you how to cuff on one arm. PERP. First option is to cut off one hand and put the other cuff off, cuff off one hand, put the other cuff on a belt loop on the opposite side of their genes. If they're foolishly not wearing their jeans high and tight, then they just get cuffed to a stationary, immovable object. Thanks. And the Canadian answer and I didn't know we had a different answer there.

Speaker 5:          01:07:55       Their hand,

Speaker 3:          01:07:59       uh, the police. Okay. On your recent Potty, I heard you ask police how to handcuff someone with one. On one hand, I'm a police officer in Canada and recently helped arrest a one handed man. No Way. The short answer to the question is we can't.

Speaker 5:          01:08:11       One would assume that you can just cut his one hand directly to ankle.

Speaker 3:          01:08:17       So apartment Paulison specifically prohibits this because it is considered a hard time and can cause fat people with respiratory problems and stop breathing. We are issued nylon Rhett leg restraints, however they are useless if the rest of the person, if the arrested person is also is not handcuff because they can just bend over and take them. The only restraints that we consider acceptable or the metal shackles that would cut his cough is hand to the front and have as a long chain reaching around down to the ankles. They're loosely cuff together. Patrol cops don't carry shackles, so we just shoved him into the back of the van. I hope this helps and thanks for the great podcast, Justin. Well thank you both Brim Lau and Justin for the snappy in one armed and overweight. Oh, like it couldn't get worse. And committing crimes, you're just like being in your arrested just like your life is just shit. You know, you're in jail, you're fat and you got one arm. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:09:13       I was watching Trudeau on the Internet, you know, they're, you know that Canadian band, the tragically hip. Yeah. It's like Canon is pride. Right. And the lead singer died. And here's like sweet ass Trudeau crying about this lead singer. Did you see him buying Shannon couldn't love them anymore. Yeah. He was like national treasure. And I was like, imagine if Donald Trump like our stupid president book bunch of faggots crying about some bad, get it together. Yeah. Like, oh my God, what a difference. And I know he's got an military guys go down and he doesn't even take it seriously.

Speaker 3:          01:09:48       I see that thing this, this morning, how brutal where the widow of the of the soldier that died was on like good morning America. And she was like, yeah, that, that account that Frederica Wilson gave of how the president spoke is spot on. That's where I'm like, God. And He, and she was what made me really sad. It was that he, he couldn't remember my husband's name and he immediately tweeted, I spoke to her and I'd never hesitated about him, his name from the very beginning, like he tweeted that immediately. Oh boy.

Speaker 5:          01:10:19       I mean, the amazing thing is there was a witness to the first call. So number one, what's the agenda of a fallen soldier? His parents to lie about the president of United States. Right. And then you've got corroboration from a congress woman, not just Johnny, you know, she had had in the back of the van, like, yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:10:38       no, for this woman, she was on the call. It was speakerphone, her aunt, her uncle, the congresswoman and the driver. So five people. Yeah. And she's, and she's like, nope. And he's like, that's not what happened out of that. Yeah. It's crazy. Wow.

Speaker 5:          01:10:54       It's true. That's not even your priority to call out the president at that moment when it all started, because he was taking shots at Obama saying that I, he didn't use to call me while Obama called every one of them followed up with a letter and usually called back six months later. So why go after, first of all, it's like, it's like a lawyer says,

Speaker 6:          01:11:14       don't ask a question. You don't know the answer to. Don't Attack Obama on something that you don't know the answer to. Yeah. Especially when you're actually guilty of it yourself. Yeah. Well, he's a sociopath. It's crazy. It's banana. She just ban ban Trump. Talk from all podcast.

Speaker 4:          01:13:59       sale of this, how are you a regular like are, are you good at oral care, do you

Speaker 6:          01:14:04       I floss every day, thank God because I've got a couple of niches in between my that just, they just fill up. I eat anything. I've got something in those, in those spots. It drives me crazy and so I love the little handheld flossing

Speaker 5:          01:14:21       devices. Those, they don't like that. I like them. I keep those in my bag and then I floss every night. I brush at least three times a day. I'm consumed with having bad breath because when people have bad breath, I can't hang out with them anymore. Dude, it's ruined a few like people that I want to hang out with. Yes. It's all I think about your breath. One of them, like I like a friend and I'm just like, I dunno. It's weird. Like I can't write that off. We both wrote down three names of comedians with bad breath. They would crossover. I bet. I bet. At least let's do that. Okay. When we're off the air.

Speaker 6:          01:14:54       Um, so, uh, anyway, so I go in and I was feeling this pain when I bite on the right side of my mouth. And so I went in and the, and, and I swear

Speaker 5:          01:15:04       war. And how often do you go to the dentist? Do you go regularly? Yeah, go once a year. Okay. Okay. And uh, oh, I take my teeth very seriously. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. You know, it's very, you'd be surprised because I only ask because of the range of like, some people come in here or they'll email in and they'll be like, haven't been to the dentist in 10 years. And then they go, because you guys talk. But all the time I just decided to go and we get the full range. Some people were like, I had 26 cavities. Right. And some people were like, you wouldn't believe what I haven't been in 10 years. Nothing. Yeah, I'm fine. Right. Anyway, I have very hard teeth. I didn't get a lot of cavities in my life. My mom's got hard teeth. We don't get cavities. Wow. They're very white. Is that a natural? I don't know. I used toothbrush with the white neuron it and maybe like know smile. Oh Wow, this one's fake. This got knocked out. Ooh. And Aah. And they've put it in. And that was when I was 15 and it's still going strong ground on the last that long. Now what about veneer work? Porcelain? No, nothing like that. No. Bondings of any kind of, wow. So you're, you're feeling a pain though. So I'm

Speaker 6:          01:16:05       feeling a pain when I bite and I'm convinced it's my second molar top. Uh, uh, right. Yup. And so I go in and the guy, uh, takes, takes a, like a cue tip and he says, bite down and keep biting down. I'm not feeling the pain. And it keeps going. And then he goes back to the wisdom tooth and I bite on that. And there was the pain. And so it was like this phantom thing where I thought it was this tooth, but it was the other one. So then he goes, all right, well, you know, we can, we can, uh, he says, he, I think it's cracked. He said, and so because I, I do to have filling in that one. And so the wall of it was too thin. So he goes, all right, we're going to pull it next week. And so I go home and then that week I'm chewing and all sudden I chew on something hard.

Speaker 6:          01:16:50       And it was the outside piece of the wisdom tooth had fallen off and I crunched down. And here's the amazing thing about the human tooth. A dental system, you will be biting full speed. What does that 20 miles an hour each bite. Sure. And then if something is in there that's hard. Your teeth stop in a nano millimeter for crushing down. Isn't that incredible? And it just stops. Yeah. And even when you're fat, it's about, and so, uh, so I went in and he, uh, he went in to pull it out and he shot me with the Nova Cane. And all I'm asking is in advance. I'm like, so can I get like a barbiturates or whatever, can I, can I get some opioids? And he's like, I don't think you'll really need it. And I'm going, you know, I'm pretty pain sensitive and I'm really not, but, uh, I want to get them and give them to my friends.

Speaker 6:          01:17:42       And so, uh, and so he goes in and he's like, gives me the penicillin shot and that not penicillin. The, uh, the numbing thing, the Novocaine, Novocaine, and then, and then he's picking her, he's poking around and then all of a sudden he holds it in front of me. It took like three minutes. He just popped it right out and then, um, you know, gave me some gauze to chew on and I did three shows at night. Oh, Mike with the gauze in my mouth. Oh, here, here in la. And then I, and then I went out the next day. Took the, you know, said the gauze out overnight. The next day I was, I was fine and I haven't had any pain. Some people get wisdom teeth out and for whatever reason it's, oh, it's an leads. It affected and they have pain from

Speaker 4:          01:18:29       back then when I, when I had mine taken out, they weaved in some cloth that had a painkiller, but it had a clove clover, clover and I, I absolutely cannot stand it. So I would driving around like, oh, and tasting the clothes, the clove tastes. Yeah. And I had to, I called, I was like, you have to put something else in. Like I'm going to, I'm going to be not, I'm going to throw up. And so I had to go in, they had to weave it back, put another one in. Wow. I never have, I've never heard this story 12 years. And I never, you know about your dental history time. I know you always get something exciting and fun with a dental update or you do a dental update on every episode that every episode we've probably done, I don't know, 50 of, I mean we'd like to, it's funny like we, we aligned with this company where we're both there like trying to make oral care more a part of the conversation and we naturally did this, been doing this for years.

Speaker 4:          01:19:33       Like we just bring it up because I think we're just, I know it started as a joke. It was started as a joke. I had put the veneer stuff or some dental work done. No, I had a crown replaced. My point is that we were so boring to talk about on the podcast that we made it a segment on the point of fascination. Yeah. In other words, and it really is interesting to hear people's take on it. Like it's, it's so extreme, but there are people who come sit here and are like, don't brush, don't do anything. And you're, yeah. It's just, I don't know. It's like one of those things that you take for granted that someone is probably going to take care of it.

Speaker 5:          01:20:13       Oh well it is like old people. One of the first things they'll tell you is take care of your teeth. Cause when you get old in, that shit starts popping out or in pain.

Speaker 4:          01:20:21       I've asked, I always ask whenever I go to any type of medical professional, as soon as you get that rapport going with like the nurse, I'm always like, tell me some wild shit. Like what? What? And they told me that like, I go, what's the craziest thing you see here in the dentist's office? And they're always like, oh, it's old people who have neglected. Do you think it smells bad when they said no? Some of them will tilt their head back and there was just food packed. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:20:46       Oh,

Speaker 4:          01:20:48       goals and in between. And I'm like, and the smell of be like, it's not describable smell. It's a, it's the most nauseating thing you've ever seen

Speaker 5:          01:20:54       and you got to get it. And then the dentist assistant has to get in there with the floss and floss, go out being a dental hygienist. Could you even imagine the smells and you're working for a suicidal boss, number one suicide rate. Why do they want to kill themselves? But no one wants to be there as monotonous and people are afraid when they up there. I mean, I catch myself in the chair and I go, oh my God, every muscle in my body is tense right now. Right. And they pick up on that. Yeah. As opposed to being a comedian where what, how fucking great is our job. People come in, they drink, they relax, they, and, and it's also like, I was thinking about this, like, we're not that good. Right. What we do is not that good because we learn over time to be calm and act like we know what we're doing.

Speaker 5:          01:21:42       But the truth is those two or 300 people are sitting there with an agenda. Yeah. They are there to laugh. It's like when you go to a, uh, a sad movie, you're there to cry. I don't cry when I go to it's sad movie. I cry. Right. So when I go to a comedy show, it doesn't matter how funny the person is, I paid, you know, whatever they're paying to get in 20 bucks, 25 bucks and two drinks, they're fucking laughing. Right, right. Maybe, but then again, there's the, the, I dare you to make me laugh. People too. Yeah. But that's not, most of us are most, they're watching your specials like oh, that's different. Some on TV it's different. Yeah. Yeah. And then it's a challenge. Yes.

Speaker 4:          01:22:20       Yeah. The best was when you're getting these notes, different dynamic. The emails that I get, emails, like I press play on your, on your special knowing that it would suck

Speaker 5:          01:22:29       and you're, and you're like, cool. And then they'll be like, I gotta admit I did laugh and I was totally not expecting too. You're not, you're not as Shitty as I thought you would be. Like that's a very nice email. And you know, they think that they're being clever. Yeah. But it really is so annoying. It's so those him emails or after shows with some of the codes to go, hey, you weren't that bad. It's like, just walk. Just fucking walk away.

Speaker 4:          01:22:57       Yeah. Yeah. I always, I'm the one that I always tell is like the, uh, like they're like, you were pretty funny and you're like, would you, would you honestly walk up to another human being and qualify a compliment like that? Like, would you approach a woman be like, yeah, you know, you're not bad looking. Yeah. You know, it's like the, the, the way that you're saying that is such a shitty tone to say like,

Speaker 5:          01:23:19       well, it means that that guy probably sees himself as the funniest guy in his office and he can't give up the Alpha status. That's really interesting. Yeah. I never, I never thought of it that way. There's a lot of alpha. Yeah. I mean, we're assuming alpha status and the same for you. Yeah. You know, you're walking in and you're saying that's why women do. And one of the many theories why women are, you know, there's that thing of like women aren't funny and it's all, it's like, well no, it's that you won't give over to the way I just described. People walking into club and sitting down and giving over. I think there's a criteria for who they will give it over to as well. And for men they don't sell. You don't want to give up their alpha status. Yeah. It's a position of power to, to hold a microphone and to be like, you're listening to me for the next hour of your life. And also a women aren't allowed to be loud, vulgar, aggressive. It's societaly frowned upon for a woman to a assert that kind of power. Yeah. So attractive. Sexually attractive. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:24:11       How threatened men are. Um, in all aspects of like on social media, I was thinking about like all the shit talking like all the hate. It's all dudes. And I probably have a more, obviously skew more male followers, but like all the fucking hate all the shit talking. It's all guys. Yeah. It's all guys. It's like unprompted. They're just pushing their issues onto you. Yeah. You know, it's like whatever, they're attacking you for it. Sometimes it's like, oh, you know, you have this a nice fucking shirt asshole and you're like, what? Yeah. You know, or it's like, yeah, you think you're so fucking funny. What about some guy wrote me like I, I did some sarcastic post and he was like easy to say when you have success and your wife has makes money and blah blah blah. I'm like, yeah, right.

Speaker 5:          01:25:01       It's the grand post. Right. I'm just joking. Although when a woman criticizes me, she's almost always dead on. So it's like the thing you said it was actually kind of racist we got, yeah. Like think about it. You're right. Yeah, you're right. That's true. I know a lot of females criticizing me now from the special, it's a lot of female on female eight. Really? Oh yeah. Yeah. Maybe it's that the sexist feel more comfortable criticizing. They're all 100% yeah. Yeah. Cause guide the, the, what I get from guys is like, I usually hate a female comics, but you're funny. Like a guy. He's funny. And then I'm like, thanks. I think, thank you. I don't know, you know, like every other dumb broad out there. Yeah. Good job. Wow. What a compliment.

Speaker 4:          01:25:42       Yeah. By the way, did you pick up on this, uh, the David Cross thing? Did you hear about this or read about it? What happened? How he was accused of being racist, but like in a tweet,

Speaker 5:          01:25:52       oh, I saw that there was an Asian, a comedic actress, Simon say, and I don't want to give this person any thunder. I mean, it's a known story. I think that, you know, David Cross is whole sensibility

Speaker 6:          01:26:04       is ironic. Every, I mean it's like Sarah Silverman, it's a call. Anything she says is racist is like split. You don't get what this person is.

Speaker 4:          01:26:12       That's what I thought too, man. And the other thing that I, I want to say like, yeah, we have to give some sense.

Speaker 6:          01:26:18       I mean, it's literally like me calling that Guy Faggot as being homophobic. Right? When I say to the MC, like that's literally how add a context that would be David Cross.

Speaker 4:          01:26:27       So the story of people know is that the, the comedic actress was, I think, I think it was at a bar in, on location before shooting a movie. This is how I understand it. And like people are getting together at the bar and that he approached and she said that he was like, um, he said something to her and she was like stunned by what she, yeah. He made fun of her pants or something. Yeah. And then he was like, you know how to speak English and then challenged her to a karate fight. And I was like, yeah, I, you know, I just thought like, but if you're, cause you're a comp, if the person who was saying it was, is a comedian, yeah. Don't you think that like if you know David Cross that he is actually playing, like playing the part of that stupid person, right.

Speaker 4:          01:27:13       In an improvisational moment. Right. Like that's how I was like, wouldn't that be like automatic? It's a compliment that he would think that you'd be okay with it. Right, right. Great. 100%. Yeah. Um, and I just felt like, I don't know, I mean I'm not Asian so I don't have the right to like say whether or not it's offensive, but I'm like, but I am a comic. And I'm like, yeah. Like if, if he came up to me and started like doing what David Cross does and like jumping into like a character and insulting me. Like that's supposed to be the fun thing that you're like, yeah, oh yeah man. Like your yes and it, yeah, yeah, yeah. You go along with it. Sure. And to recount it 10 years later and be like, God, that was so painful. It just sounded like, I was like,

Speaker 6:          01:27:59       oh, you're so weak. It might. Well that's the problem now with the whole me to pound sign me too Hashtag yeah. Is that it's so undefined and it's such an excuse for anybody to just bitch about feeling slighted at some point. Feeling slighted and being sexually harassed are very different things. Yeah. Well racial, racially harassed. The whole problem is the non specificity, specificity. Specificity. For instance, if you're going to call someone a racist and you're going to do it on Twitter and 150 characters or less like is that really fair to put someone on blast in two sentences? The answer is no racism.

Speaker 4:          01:28:42       You know, like to tell that story like we met at the bar before, like you know as a like as a cast and then like to take all the nuance out of the conversation.

Speaker 6:          01:28:53       Yes. And then that was racist to me. Well it's also a misuse of the word racist because racism is

Speaker 4:          01:28:59       the, the, the,

Speaker 6:          01:29:02       the person who has the power using that power to objectify or oppress the person of another race. Geez. The lesser race, the superior race acting superior basically is a crime. We earned it. Yeah. Look, we only fucked within our thin gene pool for thousands of years, so we could be better. But I mean, but I mean racism is the acting out of a prejudice. Yeah. So just making it up. Not even say, say David Cross was it for the most liberal outspokenly, you know, democratic guy. If he say this in one moment of his life decided to be a racist, he didn't do anything about it. He didn't keep her from getting an a movie or on stage. So there's no crime and I think he is one of the most liberal, uh, he is like really? He and his wife have followed them on Instagram. Yeah. Ps sweet. I doubt that. And what the Hashtag me too think I'd like to know what the stories are. I feel like if it, if it's not specific, it's like what is, how is this helping people? Yeah. There you go. Cause in sharing stories, that's how people help each other. Do you know what an Asian woman by the way, making fun of another Asian.

Speaker 3:          01:30:16       She was no, she, this woman is actually talking about how, how she said that like uh, that she'll fight your ass even though I'll let her say it so

Speaker 12:         01:30:34       fucked up bitch, I'm still hurting shit and we'll fuck your is stop. Okay. You want to fuck with my money?

Speaker 3:          01:30:41       Oh, I fucking love that. So Schatz a character, she's a, she's a real hood ass chick, right? What does she look like? She's, um, I guess, I think it was she Chinese, Vietnamese, and um, but she like, uh, from New York and talks like, like super ghetto. And then it goes, she was like, oh, I might look like I'll change, I'll bow. Fuck your ass up. He want to fuck with my mind. Who I fuck with me? Do you want to fuck with me man?

Speaker 12:         01:31:11       Oh, that's be as Vietnamese, right?

Speaker 3:          01:31:19       Yeah. May, may, may, may is her name. I don't know. I'm on my mind.

Speaker 6:          01:31:25       Yeah. The Vietnamese gangs are bad ass. They were no tourists when they started coming over here and like the 90s, I forget why they was like an influx of Vietnamese gangs and, uh, the cops would talk about how, you know, it all started with like, you know, the Italian mobsters. Right. And that mafia were really, they just, they killed other fat guys. There wasn't, there wasn't too much. And then along came like, um, you know, uh, inner city crips and bloods and they were killing other bystanders. Got killed a lot. But then these Vietnamese gangs came along and they said, these motherfuckers were scary than any of the other gangs because these guys would just black fucking open fire there we do is all kinds of hits going on. And, and they said they were, they were really fucking tough. And then of course the Russians came.

Speaker 4:          01:32:15       Oh savages that just like Trump everyone. And then, you know, I remember when we were kids, like the big thing when I was growing up, my mother's Peruvian is we would always refer, everyone would referred to the Colombians as like the most savage. Yeah, no cause it like the cartels and they're like, they're so violent. And then they were definitely, I mean they look like fucking kindergarteners next to the Mexican cartels. So much way more savagery and the Mexican cartels like fucking will kill a whole kid, like a school full of kids and all the teachers and stab notes into them so that when the cops come, the notes are stabbed into the kid's dead bodies. No Shit. Yeah. Yeah. Because like they were trying to oppress the cartel in that area. Wow. Crazy shit like that. You know, it's like in um, way, but I'm saying like leftover. Yeah. You know what?

Speaker 6:          01:33:08       Well, it's like member apocalypse now and when at the end he's talking about how the Americans would send a medical units in to try to treat the Vietnamese who had, I forget what disease they have, but they gave him shots of penicillin and then the warlords would come in and they would chop off the children's arms that got the shot. And then that's when Marlon Brando said the horror, AH,

Speaker 4:          01:33:32       Jesus Christ

Speaker 1:          01:33:34       gray matter. It's all made a song out of that. It is a good song.

Speaker 13:         01:33:46       My mind.

Speaker 14:         01:33:48       Ah, Tuesday I belie

Speaker 1:          01:34:02       man my day because I make crazy as videos in my hair. Fucking Matt, come on, look was talking to you too.

Speaker 14:         01:34:15       Your Dick in a box to tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick in the wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:34:29       You remember a great, yeah, it's really good. I can't stand when somebody comment under one of my video. It's too high. No waterfall. But I am blessed.

Speaker 4:          01:34:44       Uh, so this guy last week tried to tell us, tell the Internet that if you want to feel Horny, you should take 10 to 12 Benadryl. You're going to answer by when you see this one,

Speaker 6:          01:34:55       he's a die. If you take 12 where

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       we thought crazy person. Yeah. He's like, you want to be a horny 10 to 12 Benadryl.

Speaker 15:         01:35:05       Send me the hospital before you have sex. Do you want to be horny for two or three hours? Like you never been in your life? Any of access to marijuana too good. We'd listen to me. She came to me. True wheat alone can get your really hornier than normal, but it's been on general. Take about 10 12 billion girl before you want to have your sexual fun with your partner or whatever you do or masturbate. All right,

Speaker 3:          01:35:37       so this guy, I'm thinking it's the ladder with him. This guy is often in the balloon. Odd. He's, he's, he's real. He's the, they send them some more videos of him, so he's gone for it. He's really going for it. But this person said that's one way I heard the most recent podcasts. It needed to share. When I was in high school, Somebody told me, you took a bunch of Benadryl. It would give you a pleasant, hi, I'm not sure what is wrong with that women's wrestling guy because it was truly one of the worst, worst experiences in my life. And movies. They often show acid and mushrooms is terrifying, inducing terrifying visuals, which they don't for most people, unfortunately. This is exactly what happened. Most of them, I felt like it was on fire. I could not tell what was real, what wasn't. I was talking to people I believed were there and I would look back and they were gone.

Speaker 3:          01:36:24       When I would walk into a different room, I would think I was somewhere else on a different day. Towards the end, I was chasing it. Tarantula around the room and trying to kill it with a broom says, considering this guy has done this a lot, he must be a special kind of crazy. Keep your dosage is low when experimenting with drugs or new masturbation techniques. Dr Lee's, I bet he didn't sneeze one style. Yeah. See upside on the bright side. You this, uh, could you imagine this guy's fucked up? Well, can you imagine watching the video and then going, I'll try it. Yeah. Look at this. I mean there's, you're talking about take the, this is the string from his shorts. Obviously it goes to my pants right now, but

Speaker 15:         01:37:13       cause hard as you can to rip this apart. Close hers. You can you fill those magnets, a little atomic magnets that make molecules and the molecules stick down our molecules. No, no they don't. That's a magnet. Lots of the little pity magnets ma'am.

Speaker 3:          01:37:37       He also turns out he's really pissed off at women in general. I know why. I was going to say, I mean when I see a waste of human existence like that and you think about how much work it took for his mommy to make him and care and then you're like, no, this is what you're fucking dealing with your

Delia, I didn't realize that last one by the way is solidified the level that that dude's really well you think? Well I mean the 10 or 12 bandage rolls inside. Yeah. Did you did not doubt it. But that would the end there when he was like, fuck you motherfucker. Like that's that. Is this guy not stumble onto Methodist point? I know, right? Good. 30 Benadryl. Okay. Yeah. I think the next step is meth. Yeah. I think

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       that's the step before this. Like that's an old step. He said it hard to get, Benadryl is not like a controlled substance. I know like sue DEF Sudafed is to deference in there. Whatever happened when I met her, you know everyone's always like, wait til you meet my mom. Like that kind of thing. She was like, wait til you meet my mom please. And then we met at a restaurant and she was like, hello. And then she's like, I was at Bloomingdale's. And he's fucking cunt sales woman. And I was like, ah. I started laugh so hard because I was so funny. And she's like, barely. She's like barely registering me. She's like watching me laugh. And she's like, I said, fuck you, you fucking bitch. And I was like, oh wow. First meeting we were in a public restaurant or restaurant, she would frequent and she would always get the back booth so that people couldn't hear her, so she could really unleash.

Speaker 3:          01:41:48       Yeah. And then Christina was like, when she was like, what are her views on race? Super. My mother was super racist. She would, um, she felt slighted by that. We went to a Sushi bar once and they sat us in her opinion, very close to the restroom, which not really, but she was too close to the toilet. And so she got mad at the waitress and she was like, this fucking goop bitch set me near the fucking toilet. Fuck fucker. You're fucking gook. And I was like, oh. Um, so then we like got up and stormed out and I had to follow her. I was like, something's wrong.

Speaker 3:          01:42:24       Jesus. She was always right. And my step father was Indian and he was racist too. Ironically, they're both dead now, but that's one of my favorite, like the psychology of like these fucking immigrants, like your Indian step immigrated at like 25 or 30 like a grown man came to this country and was like, we gotta put these border wall. Like he was like, yeah, pro. You know what I mean? Like he probably came in illegally. No, no, he fought in our military. Well he did and he came in legally, but he was a republican and he gave a lot of money to the Republican Party and therefore felt that he was kind of like, you know, like a white guy by, by money. And he kind of was like, in this country, your economic status determines a lot, right. How people perceive you. And he was a baller, so yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:43:09       Oh Wow. That's crazy. But pictures of the five last Republican presidents sign personally given to him because that's how much money, he don't know what the party shit. What did he do for work? Oh really? One answer that I'm a little bit a little bit of everything and they say, well, this little, it was little, my uh, one of my friends growing up, not that this means it, but it's probably, it was Dominican and they, they were like, I was like, what does your dad do? They live, they were very wealthy and import, export, import x. That's another, it's like four years later it's like, well what does he do specifically import export. I'm like, could you tell me what he, and mostly important

Speaker 6:          01:43:54       distribution. Yeah. I was like, hmm, okay. That was it. That was the most you ever got spending the night at his house. What do you do? Import. Export, right. Yeah. Okay. Well that's amazing because when you think about a World War II and the people that came over you, or even going back to, you know, the turn of the 19th century when people came over here and they had nothing and, and all of a sudden like, you know, you got some guy who came over here like, you know, I was reading this book about the, the I, the famine in Ireland and like people would come over here and like 1946 with fuck, you know, zero and all of a sudden they went to college and then they went to got a doctor's license. Oh, it's banana and became wealthy and it's like, I, I hope my kids like just break even.

Speaker 6:          01:44:42       I hope that they can move out of the house at some point. Make enough money to live on their own. That's my, that's my goal for my kids. Yes. Wait, can I ask a question though? Sidebar. He will. He's a winner because he was, your son's going to, he's the way you described. Yeah, he should be. Well, you never know. Sometimes kids peak in high school. Your daughter is going to bring a black guy to live with her for sure. Gonna fucking definitely move on. Yeah, I'm expecting the black guy were already like, you know, putting hip hop stuff around the house. It's just a matter of time, stuff around the house. You hang gold chains on the wall and shit. So he's comfortable. We've got some like, you know, some like, uh, African elephant type statues and what, what else do black people like?

Speaker 6:          01:45:25       We got cookbooks. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. I want to ask you a question about the potato famine in Ireland while there are a fucking island. Why weren't they fishing and eating fish? We were fishing. We were growing a multitude of crops, but we were, um, we were being held hostage by the British who were, who were exporting 99% of our agriculture and then selling it to other countries while we literally a million people starved. It was a genocide. We'd, they literally, you know, and so we were subsisting off the potatoes. And so when the potatoes went bad, they didn't give us any of the other food. We had giant, um, uh, pigs, a giant, a agricultural as well as livestock all being exported. And the Brits were like, fucking let him die, let him die. Literally said there are too many of them. Let them die. And this is what yours. Is this happening? This was like in the 1840 [inaudible] well the occupation lasted for hundreds of years. 1840s. Now the British, you talk about Nazi Germany, the British are way worse in terms of what they've done worldwide colonizing and you know, slaughtering all kinds of native peoples, like the Spanish to Spanish by my other half. Yeah. Savages. Yeah, I remember. I still remember that. I carry this with me, like those

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       moments, those conversations. I was in this, I was in school in, in Madrid, like in college, taking a class and they were like, how do you, um, when I write the teacher where the professor wrote, you know, when I write United States, what is the first thing that comes to mind? And a Spanish student was like, imperialism, like, yes. And world dominance and then like what about Spain? And they said some other shit. And I was like, how about imperialism? And he was like, excuse me. And I'm like, you have like 600 million people speak Spanish 2,600 miles away. Yeah. I think it's because they just liked the language cause you guys fucking fuck went in there and you just went in there and just destroyed the place.

Speaker 6:          01:47:30       The most ancient civilizations, the Aztecs and the Incas destroyed their temples and their everything. Their, their speech, they didn't allow them to speak their native language. And so it's, it's great. And pillage took everything back and then all the goals, they're like, you guys are the imperialist. Like we learned it from dad. Yeah, dad that took all that gold. Yes. Because all of that goal in Central America and they just carved it and the, and it's the people in Mexico, they didn't fucking know. Of course they did gold, didn't mean anything to them. So next thing you know, they're hauling that shit out of the ground with a gun to their head. And anyway, this is, this has gotten to be a very dark,

Speaker 4:          01:48:10       I love it. Podcast. Yeah. We're on the brink of civil war in this country. And listen, we got to wrap things up. Um, fits dog radio if it's a podcast. So the show airs on Sirius Xm as well, right?
