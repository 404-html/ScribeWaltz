Speaker 7:          00:08:25       Who's fatter? Thompson or Bert Kreischer. That's a very good question. Very good question. I don't know if you realize this, but to my very good friends, Tom Sigora and Bert Kreischer, they're both hilarious guys and they have decided to do this thing where they're calling each other fat. They're both, but I love them both to jazz, but they both lose a couple of pounds. Think of bolts, lose a rural, um, and they've just decided, uh, to, uh, have this public thing where it's like, Hashtag bird is fat. Hashtag Thomas Fat, I'm going to move my phone to this new thing. Ooh, that's better. Um, and so they sell t shirts like half Hashtag Thomas Fadden Hashtag birdies fat tee shirts and all the proceeds from the sales of those go directly to them. So you're not helping any fucking charities. No starving. Kids are getting fed. They're just going to buy food and get fatter.

Speaker 1:          00:09:28       Oh, it's Ryan don't bring in one loving to them. Well, well, well go to your mom's house Christina, cause it's interesting. Okay. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:10:41       well, he's not in the mood. He just woke up maybe in a little bit. He'll get chatty in a minute here.

Speaker 6:          00:10:46       That's hilarious. Joe Did a Joe Rogan, our buddy did episode. Um, eight, 27 of his podcast where he just did a Q and. A. That's how massive that guy's show is. He can just be like Q and a, so like three hours and then in like, and probably get, you know, whatever. 1 million downloads crazy. Um, but people have been hitting him up who's fatter because he's been so, I haven't seen, I've been tagged and tweets on, uh, on, you know, on Twitter where they're, they're tagging him. You're like, so Joe, you haven't weighed in yet. Who's fatter?

Speaker 5:          00:11:19       Did he, he didn't say whose fatter, he just said you both needed to lose some lbs. Yeah. Yeah, he did. Yeah. And that you guys are just going to buy it. Yeah. You're going to buy more food. Yeah, that's right. That's right. What do you think Ellis? Who's fat or your, yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:11:34       Oh, who's fatter? You're going to weigh in on this? Are you going to eat some microphone? That's a cool thing that babies do. We just put everything in there.

Speaker 5:          00:11:45       Yeah. Super Fun for Moms to watch. Okay. Well anyways, uh, very cool that he mentioned you guys. Yeah. He madness. Yes,

Speaker 6:          00:11:54       he went on a little bit here. That's, it's pretty funny. If you want to hear. Sure.

Speaker 7:          00:11:57       And birds case, he's probably going to buy boxes of wine or drinks, boxes of wine in an evening and so it was trying to explain to me how many bottles of wine that is and we don't really know. I could Google that. I'm going to Google that right now. Let's find out. If you had to guess, how many boxes of wine would you say

Speaker 6:          00:12:20       one box is? Probably, I mean two bottles.

Speaker 7:          00:12:24       All right. Let's take a quick, let's see. I guess how many or how many bottles are there? How many bottles of wine or in a box? All right. Eight bottles of wine are in. Oh, no, wine. I'm good. Before I click on it, I'm going to say, I think, I think it was nine. I'm going to say it seems like a lot for bottles. Okay. Okay. Wait, six, six and two thirds bottles. All right. Here it was 750 mil liter bottles. How many? 750 milliliter bottles are there in a five liter box of wine? Well at six and two thirds. And if it's a three liter box of wine, it's four bottles.

Speaker 6:          00:13:09       Oh my God. But wine is so Bush League Cup. Burt though, you know he's, he's a machine. He starts with cooking it up, man. Yeah. That's an order, right?

Speaker 7:          00:13:21       I bet he's drinking the six and two thirds in a night. I think he's done more than one. Yeah, I forget what he said. Yeah, he's definitely drank at least one box in a night on a regular basis. So that's a four. Bob. I would be dead. I don't know how he does it. Well he's, he's definitely fat. I mean that helps. And then it's also, there's a helps

Speaker 6:          00:13:49       that helps. Uh, so he drinks a box every night you think? I don't think so. No. I mean Bertrand also, he, he moves it around like he doesn't just stick to one style. Like sometimes it's beer, sometimes it's just funny. He was a beer guy. He likes beer, he likes shots, you know, he's a machine. He's the part of you that no one party is like bird. No one parties. I have that first full weekend of odd ball with him. Oh my God. I'm going to have to like, oh my God, no, my detox before and after. Oh my God. Oh my God. And plus you guys are going to get a lot of fat shaming, shaming together. We're going to get a lot of people can be weighing in as you're performing. Probably probably you're fat or we're going to hear it's like thousands of people and then also on the odd ball, you know we, him and I, we're not the big dogs on the show. So you do like a 15 minute set and then you're, you're done. Right? So you got, you have to drink is what you're saying? I think, uh, she just walked by all account. Let me, we should, uh, can you, can you pass them off real quick? Okay. Yeah. Press printing. Press. All right. So now baby jeans is back in his crate.

Speaker 6:          00:15:02       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:15:03       it's a family affair here and now we have two dogs in here and we replaced the dog with a tube to other babies. There's always babies. No bubbles. Memphis. Oh my God. The Mongan. Well, what's really interesting about the bird is fat phenomenon. And let's be honest, there is no, Tom is fat phenomenon. It is heavily weighted, no pun intended, on Burt Chrysler, Chrysler. Right. And it is a phenomenon. I mean if you look at the Montreal comedy festival, gave him his itinerary and it said burned Chrysler Bark. Chrysler, Chrysler. Yeah. Uh, we've been getting countless tweets of Bev. You wearing the shirts. We've been getting international submissions for Burdis fat. Yeah. It's just taking, it's taking the world by storm. Yeah, it's really great. And I don't think it's, I think it's just cause people love, I don't know why this particular thing to golf maybe cause it's just fun to, to fat shame people as you know. Not that that's bad. I think it's great. No, I'm not maligning this. I think this is a wonderful, yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:16:04       Public Service. We are describing people in Latin. We're using adjectives. Let's say the adjective or basis means, uh, let's try using that in a sentence. So I'll put this on the role of Bob's Christ together.

Speaker 9:          00:16:38       Oh my God. That was amazing.

Speaker 5:          00:16:42       There you go. That is beardo from Australia. Thank you. Mom's Australia. Australia. Yeah. That is wow. Leave. Wow. That was amazing. Thank you for doing that. See what I'm saying? It's a worldwide phenomenon. Yeah. Let's hope that it motivates Bert to, uh, to stop being so fat. So undeniably unapologetically fat, no remorse, right. No remorse whatsoever. It's offensive. I'm offended. Yeah. It's quite, quite horrific to be in the presence of should we call him by a new pronoun? Like a fat brown?

Speaker 6:          00:17:21       I don't know man. So that's an interesting way. Maybe it needs a new pronoun. Thank you for leaking like Lindsey. Thanks bets. We have a quite a show lined up for everybody. This is, I'm not your typical mom show. Um, the genes machine and I, we have a special family edition. I mean you heard our little son barely murmur, but we also have my sister LMG Maria was here. Oh, okay. Um, I sat with here with her and studio for a while, talked to her. I'm going to get into that and then I have almost a full hour of top dog and Charo. Oh my God. I'm going to start things off. Why don't we get, uh, the Maria portion. Oh my God. Your sister when she was here was on all cylinders. Yeah. Do you realize what she, she flew across the country was a one year old.

Speaker 6:          00:18:27       It's unbelievable. And on two connecting flights. Yeah. And then showed up here and the baby was exhausted and she just, it just, it just rolls off her back. Like I envy that level of like, I don't care what to let, let's go. And I think we need to interrupt. One thing we didn't think about is how much our show luckily has grown since the early days for people that are joining us that maybe had to listening for a month or so and they're like, what's the big deal? The foundation of this show in a lot of ways is OMG Maria. In the old days, man, we would get her on the phone and she would just be fired up about some lcs or d sees. Those are lazy concen dumb cons. Starbucks fucking up her Starbucks order. I'd never thought that Maria was stopped drinking coffee, but she did. I know it's an, it's a bummer for our show, which I know I want to encourage her.

Speaker 6:          00:19:19       I don't care about her health. I want the, the content. I know she drinks tea now, which just does not as fun as that is fun. And she's not as angry as she used to be at Starbucks. The caffeine, she would order like three or four drinks per day and that would make her angry or naturally fired up. So it's fucking amazing. It's like the caffeine was throwing kerosene on her personality. It was perfect. Um, so anyways, I want to play for you, the Maria conversation and a, then we'll come back and we'll talk and we'll get you into the top dog and, and Charles Conversation. Yeah, I can't wait to hear this. Alright, here we go guys. Oh Em. Gee Maria.

Speaker 10:         00:19:57       Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. Oh my God. Oh my God. You're fucking McGee. Hand seriously as the backup and had a hole in it is important. That goddamn bottle. Oh my God. Seriously

Speaker 4:          00:20:15       female. Okay. All these bodily fluids come out. Do you think there's more coming at you is too there was semen or something, something else? Semen would be from three days ago. Yeah. You know, I got pregnant with Weston five days after we had sex and there was still, usually when we have sex, it still leaks out of me for like a few days after because apparently I have a very mucusy cervix. Hmm. How do you, how do you find out something like that? The doctor told me because when we estimated the date of conception was in California and Shabbos in Chicago, I'm like, I had sex with them a week ago. Is that unusual? I don't really know. I mean I think usually if it happens within two or three days because they die out. I don't know exactly how it happens, but apparently with his strong swimmers and my super mucusy cervix just hangs out in there.

Speaker 4:          00:21:05       So like five days later it's just leaking out. Whoa. That's why I can't wear thongs usually. Yeah, we can't, you know, I had to wear underwear with like something there for like the week after we got after sex. Yeah. He like comes in me or I can't have a massage. Like you know if we have sex that day for a few days, cause it's happened once before where I was having like a massage and it was like, it was like gross and like a snail trail after I got from the, it was so disgusting. I know. It's so brown. Yeah. Lesbians do it. Like knowing what the shit comes out of your bodies. I don't get at, wait, wait. You don't understand what was going to do what? Like knowing what comes out of your body, how they like go downtown on each other. Oh yeah. Really? Yeah. I know. I mean when I, knowing what comes out of me and the worst part is as you get older, it's stinkier kids. When you see like older lesbian and you're like I can't, I don't know. Yeah, I don't understand it. I'm like, it's so gross down there. Cause you feel gross. I feel disgusting. Yeah. I think it's disgusting. Like the vagina as you get older is disgusting, especially of you have kids and it's just gross. Everything about it's disgusting.

Speaker 4:          00:22:22       Hairy balls and saggy vault. It's actually the same argument can be made when you think about it. What you're saying applies to a straight man with a woman as they get older because that's also an older vagina at time. No, but I mean it's the same. The same thing. They have to comply. It's up to him. Him lapping it up every night or whatever. Yeah. You know, it's discussing. What about Old Dick? So they get saggy. And I haven't been that. I'd never say no. I haven't been with a really old deck, really know. And Jeff is younger, so I've been with, um, well I've been with, but I've seen my dad's balls. Is it so discussing and I have seen on videos like old saggy and they're so Wrigley's balls. I'm not even kidding actually. It's been a while now, but I've been in the, in their bedroom where he, you know, he changed, so he drops his, his underwear down and bends and like it looked like animal testicles, like did that big and they hang were enormous.

Speaker 4:          00:23:30       God, like go to pick nuts. Yeah. Yeah. And I was like, Whoa, dad. He goes, well, what are you doing? And he just started to see samples, man, looking at your balls. I'm going to talk to him about his balls. If I see that video, that nut bra, the Nub Brown. Yeah. They did a little comedy thing about, cause you know, old men as they would go to the bathroom, cause their ball start to drop and sag and they would drop in the toilet. Said someone came up with like an up raw, it was a joke. But now you know, you don't sit on your balls anymore and you don't have to worry about them dropping in the toilet. It was really funny. And there's that. Um, there's the story about, you know, Mr Belvedere remember that show? Yeah. That he sat on his nuts, um, at a read through and it's off bad to delay shooting an episode once.

Speaker 4:          00:24:17       Yeah. She sat on his testicles. That sounds awful. I know, I know. So gross. I've actually heard they getting kicked in the nuts. They coolant and pain from man, like getting kicked hard is the equivalent of pain as like, you know, labor contractions. But the only thing is labor contractions go on and on and on. It's so horrible. Yeah. It hasn't happened obviously in years, but he did a, he measured pain. Like they actually like that measured pain receptors on a man and it kicked him in the nuts. Oh my God. I mean the idiot that was willing to do this is amazing. But um, and then they did it, you know, women, the pain receptors. It's weird thing. I've never, I mean I'm, I'm really all about whatever get whatever turns you on is, you know, do your thing. But there's a whole whole segment of, you know, adult erotica that's about dudes getting kicked in the balls.

Speaker 4:          00:25:12       Yeah, yeah. I love it. Yeah. They love it. Oh my God. There's some sick people, you know, I think I can understand that guys signing up for it and they get kicked him fucking hard, hard, and repeatedly, not once. And sometimes they cough up and they have blood coming out of their dicks. Oh my God. Yeah. I mean, they signed up for it. I thought porn ones when a guy had like a, like a long metal tubing shoved. Oh my God. Oh my God. That his penis. I just don't get it. The pain thing. No, that, that thing, I definitely don't get her right neck. Yeah. Well, so it's eating stool and like shitting on each other. Nobody, there's something seriously wrong with these people. Yes. I totally agree. And I want to know what goes through their head that they think like this is normal.

Speaker 4:          00:26:01       I'm definitely going to find a great woman that wants to do this with me. She's quality material. It's, I know. So, um, I think I've ever had you have ever had you in studio? I did once before, right? Yeah. And uh, Redondo. So obviously people are a big fan of yours. Um, there, everyone's always been surprised that you stopped drinking Starbucks, but where do you encounter, um, your LLCs and dcs these days? Cause that was like the main place used to get them a voice. You're now living in Florida. He find a surprising number of them. Um, well one the worst. I think the greatest population of lcs and dcs would be at Kmart. I went once, I will never return. The second group is definitely Walmart. Unfortunately I have to go there every now and then. Sam Clubs is the Fattest Group of lcs and dcs. Really?

Speaker 4:          00:26:58       It's horrible. I actually at the point now that on the weekends I refused to go to Publix. Sam's club or Walmart or any grocery shopping, I can't deal with it anymore. I think goes out there. And how disgusting and how obnoxious and rude. So Sam's Club, you know, you go, we go on the weekend, we did our bulk shopping of stuff and it's all have also happens to be sampled day. So every aisle has samples. And you had these heifers, I mean these huge families and they bring the whole fucking family. I mean it's not like mom or dad doing the groceries. It is mom, dad, brother, sister, grandma, the wheelchairs. They've got the automated wheelchairs everywhere and they just stop and they just go on these feeding frenzies it's like going on a carnival cruise with all you can eat buffet. It's disgusting. And you and I just want to go get a fucking rotisserie chicken and some toilet paper, but you can't get through the aisle and I lose my shit so I can't, I told you, I'm like, it makes me angry.

Speaker 4:          00:27:48       And it was my weekend. Like I just want to go buy some things and go home and I can't go through anywhere. So you're really angry when you see like a super obese people? No, I don't get angry. I want to see obese people. I get angry when they make the whole, they feel like I'm inconveniencing. They're feeding frenzy and they just, you know, they're in, they're in my way of everything. We're getting animals. They were like animals. Yeah. And it's like my fault. Like they're like, excuse me, I'm trying to eat a sample here and as long as well as the rest of the store and you just see like what they're doing. Like I just, I don't understand. Like, if you're at the point where you can't see your genitals or your feet, why do you think it's okay to go get like mass quantities of like pork, ribs and Cheetos and it's disgusting.

Speaker 4:          00:28:29       And you just, I remember when we were in these obviously, but we were in high school. Yeah. There was a pretty big kid of the other high school. Okay. And um, one of my friends told me there was good friends with him, but one of my friends who was good friends with him and told me that, uh, his family made every meal with Bacon and that they've saved the bacon grease and that they would use the big ruse to like co can flavor things with. I'd never heard of that since then or before then. I did that with duck fat. Really? Yeah. When I cooked doc, I say the grease and I'll use it to like saute potatoes or vegetables. You see the George multiple jars. It's disgusting. I mean I would say one darn it would last me forever. Every meal is or their bacon sausage some.

Speaker 4:          00:29:24       They were big people too. Yeah. But then there comes a point where we're like, you know what, this law, you look at everyone else around you and you're like, something's wrong. I can't see my feet. I should probably do something about it. I think those are, yeah, that is the way I think the, what happens with when their families have those epidemics is that you've made it normal at your home. So on your feed, your kids and you take your kids to go give them sugary drinks and a bunch of crap and garbage and that's all they know. It's the norm for them. Yeah. It's the same thing with like all those teenage moms that you know these, so when I was doing that, the class is at the women's care center and I would have these girls, I mean they're girls like in high school coming in, they're on their third or fourth pregnancy and they had no interest in ever doing anything.

Speaker 4:          00:30:05       They're like, oh, just get on WIC and food stamps and welfare. Yeah. And, and it's normal. Like this is what the norm is to them. There's a zero dream or aspirations to do anything more with your life. It's depressing. Yeah. No, I gotta say you, um, you have this unreal drive to work out. Yes. It's so cool. Where do you think that comes from? Where you are, where you work out? So savagely to get my aggression out and eat a healthy outlet. It's really, yeah. I mean I need to do something to get my frustrations out and energy and board of the frustrations come from using everybody's frustration to me now. You know, like working kids, it's exhausting. So it's good to be like that. Like life in general. Yeah. I mean like when things piss you off and if you didn't do that, it would just be like, you have been irritable bitch.

Speaker 4:          00:30:58       I be intolerable. Really? Yeah. I mean you see now as the poor, like even in high school, like if something, if I get mad, I mean frustrated. I need you just our families, the St will explode if I don't find some way to get it out. Yeah, true. I feel the, I feel a similar. Yeah. I mean I need somewhere to explode. I can just, I can be aggressive. I'm not hurting anybody. I need, I have, we all have aggressive jeans. I need somewhere to get that out. That's not going to harm others. I mean, useful for people to know. You flew from the east coast, you connected in Dallas, you had to lose, you got here in the evening and nine, it wasn't like we went to bed relatively late and then you got up really early case got up so early and then when I got up you'd run five miles and uh, most of it is at an incline, a severe incline.

Speaker 4:          00:31:54       I was, I was not prepared for that one. Pushing that stroller up that hill was like God. But I was explaining to me what you did. First of all, I have yet to see, I don't want to give away my address, but in this neighborhood, I've yet to see anybody run where you were running. I mean, that's a walk, you know, and most people walk up that slowly. This is crazy that you were able to run five miles and that you did it at seven in the morning. No, I did it, I think at nine. Nine. I don't think so. Maybe eight, maybe eight I think. I have no idea. It was up so early. I just didn't know. I just needed to get her calm. I was like, okay, here we go. So after that run, you feel totally like more balanced? I do. I was telling me my legs are shot and afterwards I was tired, but I felt really calm the rest of the day. I was super chill. And then like today, what will you do? You and I are going to do a burpee circuit. I burpee challenge burpees, challenge. You're going to do it. Preppy challenge, 30 minutes nonstop, nonstop, or every channel. ABS dips in between. Okay, cool.

Speaker 4:          00:33:09       It'll be, it'll be, it'll feel good after tired. Look good. Um, and then you're really on top of, you love to cook, but you like healthy cooking. I do like how they cooking. I mean, I don't want to be, you know, a Walrus. Yeah, I see enough of them at Walmart and Sam's Club. Yeah. So rose, that's okay. Do you think bird, his hat? Who? Bert?

Tommy [inaudible] it's going to cause a divorce. You're fired if he doesn't get me that toilet, you want it, right? No. Yeah, we've talked about it a bunch that uh, it's really a game changer. It really is just, you know what number one, even if I'm cold, my whole body, I go to the bathroom, I sit there and it is so warm that depict honestly your war map, my whole body,

Speaker 13:         00:40:18       it has an environmental advantage because you actually use less toilet paper. Yeah. And you know, so you're really actually, but then you're using a lot of water, I guess is kind of a tradeoff. Well know it takes more water to make that amount of time, so I think it's a better deal. Yeah. Well I know that I feel a lot cleaner. It does that well. When I, when I first did my yesterday, when I did my first dump here. Yeah. And then I went in for my normal rewind. A lot of times when I do adopt, but I have a wipe and then they have to go back a little. But all that you know about whole ledge?

Speaker 14:         00:40:54       Yeah. Where they would get at a hotel. He barely made it to the room.

Speaker 13:         00:40:57       Oh, that was mid day. He went from there to the shower. I didn't really know. It was a classic. It really was a 3.5 it wasn't quite a four. It was so bad that he told me he won't tell me about it too. Don't discuss, tell me about it. It went, it went on for like ever. It was one wasn't a last year was a three, five, probably three, eight, maybe one to four and it just kept going out out now. So it was kind of solid. Well it was, it was, there was a softness to it. Okay. So it was so maybe closer to 4.0 yeah. Yeah. Okay. From

Speaker 14:         00:41:31       the bedroom. I wasn't sure if he was making movies or he was doing pub

Speaker 13:         00:41:37       anyway. It was like it was gigantic. Okay. And then, but here's what happened. It kind of, the last bit kind of broke off so I didn't have enough in me to shoot out the last bit. So some of it kind of hung there. So I had to go through, had to go through half a roll of toilet paper to get the last bit out and it was just dirty. So finally what I had to do is get up and get in the shower and finish off in the shower. So you went shit the shower. Oh, immediately. Yeah. Yes. Now do you ever take a shit and then go to the shower without wiping even once? Oh No, I never do that. No. What I do is I make an evaluation businessman's or seen it does that I make an evaluation if I'm, if I'm, if I'm a half a roll of toilet paper in.

Speaker 13:         00:42:27       Yeah. And it's still some there. I've got to go to shark. Oh. But the thing is that, that, that big day kind of saves you now that you think will meet men you think has made me, I want to make it, I know this, this trip is going to cost me some money to cause I, when we get back, here's what we have to do. We have to, she'll go online. I don't know if Amazon prime sells these things or not, but she'll find out. The company's called Toto USA. Toto USA. Okay. I dunno because we rent this house so, okay. You're going to have to go to total USA and look into that and have, uh, now you have to pick out your favorite, your re replaced to do it too. You just can't have it. I mean we can't, okay. The melon, it's actually called a, they call it a washlet I think is what they call it. Divide it down for me because it's got the heated toilet seats. Got a heated toilet seat too. It's great. Yeah. I enjoyed that when I tested it out yesterday, you know?

Speaker 14:         00:43:24       Yeah. It's called a washlet. Honestly getting my job. But you walk out of that place. I do took a shower. It's pretty amazing because people in basically take showers for main parts of your body to be clean. Yeah. And that's the most important part of your body and when you get out of there and said, oh my gosh, I feel like just, it's incredible.

Speaker 13:         00:43:43       It is. I can't believe that I'm going to be 69 years old next month and I never used one of those things until yesterday. It's incredible. You think about what I'd been missing out or you really have been missing out. I know. I feel like my life's changed ever since. Ever since

Speaker 14:         00:44:01       girls have these things I went to,

Speaker 13:         00:44:03       it's gonna be ridiculous. Your factories, your mother. Yeah. I mean I haven't seen a smile on her face like that and then a while. Let me tell you just teasing. Just teasing. Okay. Now have you had any

Speaker 14:         00:44:14       double pipe classics and all recently double double pipe classics? I have no idea about.

Speaker 13:         00:44:23       It's like when you fart and Burp at the same time. Those are very rare. Only lately, but never. Thank God I am Numb. He's had them. I've had

Speaker 14:         00:44:31       it. Not often, but there it depends where you hear that you have the capacity of doing it from the top and the bottom at the same time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not, it's not very common. It's both barrels. Yeah, it's, it's, yeah, it's both girls. Absolutely disgusting. But think about is it that one? Yes and no. You never had one about three weeks ago, but what, what did you eat to be able to, I think it was having Sushi and something carbonated, but the cool part is usually the gas picks one hole and in this case it went out of both at the same time. So I farted and burp together. I, yeah, it's very rare people can do that. It's not very common sticks an effort. Well it has to do, I think of it more like magic because you can't, you can't fake it.

Speaker 14:         00:45:17       You can't fake it. You can't, I mean it went from the baton just comes out. It just came out. Yeah. As you are doing the effort to go. I think actually the effort, I was going to fart and it went out of my mouth at the same time, like I wasn't expecting the Burkhart top of that. You were proud of that? I made tee shirts about it. You called me. Yeah. He called me immediately and we make it for us. I'm doing this and you can't. You can't. No, no, you can. You, you have to go back and reminisce. It had been, I think I said to have been a few years since I had one of those. Yeah. You know, it's like, it's like Haley's comet only comes. Exactly. Yeah. Everybody comes every so often, but well people, people have been messaging me after I talk about it and saying, you know, does it count when I sneezed and Fart? And I go, absolutely not because that's a natural pressure thing to sneeze and push out a Fart, but to burp and Fart is, it's pretty special. Yeah. That, that is a topic of conversation and know there's a bunch of topics. There's this guy, he goes by a king ass ripper. He's called the Fart. God, I wanted to show you him.

Speaker 14:         00:46:22       I think this is simply the same topic. He's called the part guy here, but watch him. He makes his videos.

Speaker 15:         00:46:32       Yeah.

Speaker 14:         00:46:33       Found him and we gave him a lot of publicity.

Speaker 15:         00:46:36       Yeah.

Speaker 14:         00:46:37       Yeah. Isn't that incredible? He's been doing these for years now. Yep. So yeah, but look how good he is. Okay. It looks like me a little, right? Yeah.

Speaker 13:         00:47:30       I wonder if you could write music to that. You'd like notes for that people have taken his far as amazing songs that I can say that.

Speaker 15:         00:47:41       Yes. Which is

Speaker 13:         00:47:45       hours, video hours. How does he manage to get done when its roots? I don't know. That's a great question, Huh?

Speaker 15:         00:47:54       Right.

I think he has people that pay him to do it. I mean, yeah. Tell me what's that got to make that business zone. Now. I can't, I can't get on a die. You're wanting to get into that. You can't control it like that. Mine just, mine is always spontaneous. Spur of the moment. Yeah, don't work. You had to. It is now. Now if you try to do it, you can't do it. It's gotta be natural. It's a natural thing. Yeah. This guy, he just has these videos all over the internet, but I have to have bacon. I tell me discussing when talks to them just barely ripping or Rhonchi far farts are my, ah, Ooh, I should have some more Berlin. I kept it off. This is disgusting. It's pretty cool. We judge something.

Speaker 4:          00:50:29       Went back to park. Okay,

Speaker 14:         00:50:33       so you know that your daughter Maria was in here. She's a, she's very well liked by the listeners. So we had had them email questions and Maria answer them.

Speaker 4:          00:50:50       Yes, that'd be classy. Okay. You can hear it. I'm really, you know, you're very popular on the show. People really like getting to know you and I want to get to know you a little better. I've had some questions submitted from fans and some of them are, you know, in an appropriate, but that's kind of the theme of the show. So I'll just start with this and you just let me know if I'm, you know what the answer is. Okay. Okay. Um, what's the most amount of guys you've had sex with in one day? One day? Yeah. I'd say for what, but neither of us climax one, if that counts all four times. Four different guys. Well, three different guys. I climb, I sweat the fourth one. Neither of us did, so I don't, that counts. So food, that's a crazy number nine. If you'd think about it over the course of 24 hours and it was spring break, you gotta be kidding, right? Yeah. Spring break. We're talking 20 here.

Speaker 14:         00:51:53       Four. I mean, all her stories are crazy. You know, of course. I didn't know what that was.

Speaker 4:          00:51:58       I mean that she's always pushed the envelope, but then realize that this was FedEx. Okay. Yeah, I mean, mine

Speaker 14:         00:52:07       for, uh, she, uh, I think on the fourth one because he was almost a climax. They didn't climax. Yeah. But this was back in her crazy days, guys, four different guys. I need you to do the roof of a hotel. One time she told me you're kidding up. So we were there. Then I remember we were in a hotel that she went to the roof. Yeah, because they had to pull the pull this closer. Where was that? I am trying to remember. We were there again, was there, told me was that it was still, they keep hiring them. Idea says I'm going upstairs to lay in the pool. Took her forever to come back and that could be it. That could be, yeah. She says she has so much time.

Speaker 4:          00:52:50       You don't mind is crazy. Spring break and you were these just random guys you would just run into, but they were there all week at the same place. Holy Shit. That means that I understand the translation. If she, if they're there then more than 24 hours, it deletes the word random. Right? Yeah. I mean that's, that's good. Okay. Yeah, so there was one of them, I don't know, but there's a three I'd seen around, so that's what, that's ridiculous. That's a lot. No,

Speaker 14:         00:53:25       a blind

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       one of them. One of them, I didn't know three of them I'd seen around seem I've round, I see them around. So like if she saw him mouth to have, so basically what you're saying is, so have you seen with him because he didn't even know, they didn't even know his name. That's good. Yeah. I mean if I walk around and I pick it up, she didn't get paid. So technically speaking it's not. So what is it calling? It isn't being loose. Oh it seems like a lot back then. I did not. Did you do that again somewhere else? No, the most I ever did after that was to one night. Wow. That's a lot. All right. Question number two.

Speaker 4:          00:54:13       What's the most cocaine you've ever done in a day? Oh my God. I think three grams. Three grams. But give a, cause you know what three grams are but either July. So that's why a non user, an idea of what that is. Like what, what does, what does three grams mean strictly on the scene and you would use cocaine. You generally do like align. Align is like, yeah, so that's one line, right? Just like a fraction of a gram side maybe did like 30 40 lines, 30 or 40 lines of coke and one day while in Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, which is so dangerous. Oh my God. So she was she,

Speaker 14:         00:55:01       she helped start a drug cartel basically. Business. Yeah. It's good to know. Yeah. This is the most scariest thing I've ever heard

Speaker 4:          00:55:08       from a guy that was our waiter who happens to also be a drug dealer and as well as the guide on our fishing trip,

Speaker 14:         00:55:19       I don't know, few years ago

Speaker 4:          00:55:20       in tango. Wow. Really? She remembers. That's really dangerous. Yes.

Speaker 14:         00:55:27       Remember that guy she has to remember is the drug dealers. She just hit them. Yes, I do. No, I don't think you did because you were making fun of this. Well, I mean it is prostitution then. He's a drug dealer. That's what it is. I mean 30 grams of the rocks. Your daughter, cocaine anymore. No, I mean there's this, that was all in the past. That makes it, okay, well it's over. What do you want to do it? It's in the past. It's still the brain is damaged.

Speaker 4:          00:55:56       I realize that that leaves the next question here. Um, have you ever been arrested and taken to jail? Uh, and if so, what for? You have gone to jail? I have gone to jail. Mom and dad do not. Where, what city were you in? I was in, I was in Chicago. You got arrested and taken to jail? Jeff and I were living together and decent behavior. We were high and drunk and naked running around the streets in the snow. I'm challenging each other. Her neighbors called police. How'd you ally? Cause obviously you don't think you got charged right now. Jeff had a lawyer. Thankfully that's grandparents bailed us out of that one. Really? Yeah. How long were you in jail? Just few hours. Few Hours. Sounds plausible to me.

Speaker 16:         00:56:52       They were naked in the streets.

Speaker 4:          00:56:55       There were, but this is a heavy drug use these days.

Speaker 16:         00:56:58       It doesn't feel good to him. He just goes, gets the drunk naked and go outside to do stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:57:03       Well people, people on drugs do crazy things. It's not that unusual. I mean they do.

Speaker 16:         00:57:09       Yeah. This is the most escape. Interviewer you ever heard in my life? I can't believe we're talking about my daughter.

Speaker 4:          00:57:17       She parties pretty hard. You know,

Speaker 16:         00:57:20       I didn't know that. I knew she party and have fun and you should. I mean, I remember one time, it really affect me. We were in church, I mean out of all the places media decide to tell me riding mass. She didn't around. She says, I want you to know that they already had sex before she was in high school and that is okay. I don't have a baby and brain in mass with my kids and husband and didn't realize it. I don't want to lie. So it's important for you to know. It's an interesting spot to a nice clean up. I think he's a smart spot to come clean. I couldn't even talk. I just keep going. And that's you're right. Yeah. And after mass I said, Maria, you shocked me in the middle of the night. She says what? It bothers me that you didn't know. And I said, when you're a kid and you said there is no baby. And she said, no, you don't have to worry for that part. So I never wanted to ask why? Because I don't know if she, yeah, things happen. And the guy is not a boyfriend. He was, yes. I don't mind. It was one of the five guys that she had in one day, but here there's more.

Speaker 4:          00:58:40       It's pretty intense. Um, have you ever committed a robbery? Yeah, big ones. Small ones. It's more of what I think she confused. Robbery was shoplifting though. Things have you prob tic tacs, lot of alcohol and cigarettes. That's like shoplifting clothes. I mean, but have you ever broken into somewhere and stolen? Yeah, I was really, I don't even remember what we stole it. We were like stupid and drunk and we just went into someone's house and took stuff and just someone's house. That's crazy. And what city was that? That was in Boston. Really. So college days,

Speaker 16:         00:59:27       not the easiest. Really Sad. Wow. This is absolutely the place to hear my daughter. No, it's a colorful past. A colorful pass to be roasted to drug dealers. Going to jail. It means you've lived a full life. It free lights. Yeah. That's not the way to beat the light.

Speaker 13:         00:59:43       I think I prefer, I prefer to think of her as is a a what a great mother and she is today and then I just, it's eccentric. She's eccentric, she's a century. But you know, I guess as a father, you know, I realize that people do things in the past, but I think I, this is like,

Speaker 16:         01:00:02       well, I have to tell has been peace palace. Yeah. It's okay. It's in the person. Wonderful human being. Yeah. At least I hope that she never, ever, ever judge anybody. Right. Yeah. That's a good point. Good point.

Speaker 4:          01:00:15       Yeah. That's a good college. That's amazing. It's a good point. I didn't know that. I mean, I, you know, still there's so many things that were blurry. They give us kind of like, yeah, I think I did the, I don't remember the specifics about it, but I remember, can you kind of, it's kind of a haze. Yeah. I remember we were really drunk and they were out. We knew that the people were the God and the brownstones on Brookline. And so we've just kind of went on. I don't be, didn't take anything. We just kind of hung out in their house and paint your alcohol and eat their food. And then like, okay, I'm gonna go back. Wow. I ever been in a fight with weapons.

Speaker 13:         01:00:50       Hm. I think that, I remember the, the boss university tuition was 19,000 a year in those days. So I'm glad. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:00:57       My money was, was going for good cause good cause for 19,000 it was tuition that didn't it no weapon Roman board. Well, there's something about that here.

Speaker 9:          01:01:06       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:01:06       No, I really wanted to though. I've always wanted to be like, like a warrior tasks. I'm like fight someone and just win. Yeah. I haven't had that opportunity. Words and stuff. Yeah. I think that's kind of the, one of the reasons why I joined the navy. I was thinking I was going to get to go and do some kind of like mission impossible, you know, stuff. And I did it. I even took martial arts classes and it didn't happen. How about, um, have you ever done anything in the adult film industry? Like porn? I did a long, long time ago because I needed extra money. I didn't feel dad was giving me a math in college and who is really excited that finally I will start asking for money and my credit card expenses went down, which he doesn't know is that I did do one film for cash.

Speaker 16:         01:01:52       Hi. This is Debbie. This is a job. No, no, this is not real.

Speaker 13:         01:01:56       Yeah, that's good. That's Marie exaggerated. It's got to be, I don't think so. No. I, I can't imagine her doing that. Really. I know that's gotta be here

Speaker 16:         01:02:06       in college. I got like, like, like $2,500 I am dealing with, I think, I'm going to think,

Speaker 13:         01:02:14       I just, I think sometimes Maria, yeah, go ahead Maria.

Speaker 14:         01:02:20       She is very good at in Bella Sheen and playing to the role. Yeah. I mean, I, I really, that one, I don't, I just don't believe it. Here's another, just one more.

Speaker 16:         01:02:32       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:02:33       So had this idea that um, it's mom and dad are coming. I want to play this game where they're always like, oh my God, Maria. So Maria shocks this way. Surprises this. Yeah, so they're always like in disbelief of your reality. So I thought it would be fun, but I was saying it right now and I'll, I'll, I'll play this later. Okay. I'm asking you to make things up, but the game will be that this is real. Yes. And it'll be something like this. Like I'll say,

Speaker 14:         01:03:12       why did we get played? I mean you're talking about hook, line and sinker being played.

Speaker 16:         01:03:18       No, no, no. I was calling my tears because I was in the worst really effect. Really?

The God is stole from everybody, but we should have it knowing Mariana says for exaggeration, I started to get suspicious for me at one point I said to me a little bit,

Speaker 16:         01:03:47       it's going to be real that he, she did it, but I think I believe it.

Speaker 14:         01:03:51       Tommy is the worst. Did you play us on it? Well, I thought we were going to have more fun with no, we got it.

This is something that I thought you might have something to say on. No. All right.

Speaker 20:         01:09:57       Hey everybody. Welcome back this week going to be talking to you about pronouns. Sonos preferred pronouns or preferred gender pronouns or PGPs, um, whatever you call him. Pronouns, the things we use to refer to people in the third person that are their names. They're also often used as the linguistic representation that people's gender identities. So there are really important, really, really, really important.

Speaker 14:         01:10:21       Okay. You understand what that this is or no? Yes. You know, a gender Pronoun. Is He? Him? She,

Speaker 21:         01:10:28       her

Speaker 14:         01:10:29       like that. Okay. So I got, um, you know, got it. Yeah.

Speaker 21:         01:10:34       All right.

Speaker 20:         01:10:37       The first and most important rule regarding pronouns is to respect people's pronouns. Always. There's a rule number two, always ask, don't assume it's far better to ask you someone's Pronoun is just be like, hey, hi. How are you? What's your name? What's Your Pronoun? Not every dealer. Hey, just want her to confirm what's, what's your pronoun? It's so much better to do. Most people are really like just pleased when someone asks about them cause it can feel very welcoming and accepting. Um, when other people do that, especially when you're newly coming out. Um, worst case I want to be, there are a lot of pronouns out there, like huge amount.

Speaker 14:         01:11:15       So this is where the things have changed recently. I, first of all, I hear you laughing. So the different, this is going to be now what people want to be referred to as like slowly and slowly adding, Huh? Oh I go by they them.

Speaker 20:         01:11:34       Well was the two most common ones are he and she, she has is traditionally considered a male pronoun and she is traditionally considered a female pronoun. However, it's important to note that some people use he or she but did not identify as male or female. So if someone says, oh my parent is he, you can't just assume that they're male or you know, if they say, sure,

Speaker 14:         01:11:57       what are you laughing at? Funny, funny video. How can you talk about it? Here is not a male I am assuming. Yeah, that's all I say. She but I call him a hit. So basically it's a he because he was born male but now he has it. Well this is more about you're talking about um, sex organs. This is gender identity. So like we're not, but if for some people the gender identity spectrum is very wide. When I want to understand this, like if I talk about you and I say hey, there are actually, I don't mean he but it is because you don't describe yourself as a male. Right, right, right, right. Can I see war?

Speaker 20:         01:12:41       You can't assume that there are female. Um, so if you were to say like I prefer, I prefer like masculine pronouns are male pronouns. It sort of implying that everyone else who uses he uses, you know, it is male or that like everyone has identified as male uses heat, which is not also not necessarily the case. So it's better to just say I prefer he'd be done with it, um, or she could be done with it.

Speaker 14:         01:13:05       It gets better.

Speaker 20:         01:13:07       Um, now. So then they're also gender neutral pronouns, gender neutral pronouns can be used for anybody of any gender and they have no gendered meanings attached to them at all, which is super cool. Um, and there are so many of them. The most commonly used is they, they have traditionally plural, but we already used in the singular form to like maintain people's anonymity here. Like if you just don't know what their gender is, you'll be like, oh, I was talking to a student and they told me Blah Blah, blah. Totally normal. So you can use it for specific people as well. And a lot of people prefer they,

Speaker 14:         01:13:40       how did you feel about in your office somebody having a gender identity thing and saying, I like to be referred to as day, then that work. I mean if I have normally called people by their name, right, but if you're referring to somebody and they have a gender identity, like preference, but Pronoun Preferences, I would still refer to that other person by their name rather than they them. So if I'm in an office and they're talking about Bob or Bobby,

Speaker 13:         01:14:13       I would not say they them. I would say Bob or Bobby

Speaker 20:         01:14:17       next. Most common I've seen as z. Z can be spelled a bunch of different ways and it can be declined, but in bigger ways it's like declension lake. So like he, him, his and then Z. Z. He are here. That z Zim Zur. Yeah, Darryl was, there are a lot of options with z. So if someone says I prefer Z, ask them what spelling and if they can use it,

Speaker 14:         01:14:45       can they use that in the office? Well, I think as a neuroma one, I think Czi I think it was it. Okay. But that's what you think of him. That he's telling you how people use it. So what is z means? Z is a pronoun. That is what? That is. Gender neutral. So you're not identifying with either gender.

Speaker 16:         01:15:02       Oh,

Speaker 13:         01:15:03       you know, is your mind blown or no? Well, I mean I think I hear women. Yeah, that's for real. I hear you. I hear, I hear women often say, you guys right. Okay. Referring to they use Z, I'm referring to a group of other women. Right, right. Okay. So I think that, you know, the, who's responsibility is it? Is it the responsibility of the minority or the majority and which, that's an interesting, it's an interesting question. Okay. And the question is, if you get closer to the mic, I think that, you know, for me the challenge is, and it also have, you can raise the arm, the arm. No, not from there. Not from there.

Speaker 16:         01:15:45       Okay,

Speaker 13:         01:15:46       awesome. You know, believe that there should be some deference to seniority and tradition. Okay. So if you have somebody who's 70 years old who was raised in an environment where this is the way, as long as he's not, as long as he's not overly disrespectful or trying to be disrespectful. Right. But he's traditional and his commentary, I don't think it's up to him to modify his behavior in order to make the new minority Hamby I, I totally see what you're saying there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just don't, I mean, I will say I do prefer these him Zur as a pronoun for myself. Tell me

Speaker 16:         01:16:25       I never heard that. Z.

Speaker 13:         01:16:27       Yeah. Yeah. I've never heard this for real. I've never heard it.

Speaker 16:         01:16:30       Z means you don't have it yet.

Speaker 14:         01:16:32       So Z is, is how you'd say he, if somebody was like, oh, or she, for somebody that goes, I'm not he or she, um, z. So you areZ , right? So you'd say Zee said z one at a coke. I get the dose or Zim over there. Oh my God. This is not for real though. Yeah. This is for real. I'm glad it

Speaker 16:         01:16:53       one last too long because this is as crazy as it comes. Now, if you are a toZ and Christina is a psyllidZ or is it she,

Speaker 14:         01:17:02       she uh, she's more on the, on the female gender spectrum. Yeah. So, so far still, sometimes she goes by, they them.

Speaker 9:          01:17:14       So you had in z?

Speaker 13:         01:17:16       Yeah. Let, let me, let me, cause both of you speak Spanish. No, but I want to know Amy.

Speaker 14:         01:17:22       Where's sure. Okay. The baby is a hero. The baby's on z right now. We're trying not to place too many gender identity issues like on him. So we're still, it is a boy. I know. So I know. I'm trying to dial that back. So you have to say on Z. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         01:17:40       All right. Since both of you speak Spanish, which is a mask in the feminine language, unlike English, which has a lot of adjectives or verbs or whatever, there are adjectives that are gender neutral. Gender neutral. Yeah. How does this translate into other languages, which are very much like French or Spanish or Italian, which you're very much a masculine feminine.

Speaker 14:         01:18:06       That's a good question. I mean, I don't have the answer, you know, I don't know what the answer is. Spanish to you because I will know what to call you. Um, uh, Z does moving, but as yes,

Speaker 9:          01:18:21       see it, Christina,

Speaker 14:         01:18:25       Eh, oh yeah. I would just, instead of saying a, I would say if he Stena like he was saying and, and, and see. Oh, how about uh, [inaudible] if diving there. It sounds feminine. [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          01:18:48       it's good. Z

Speaker 14:         01:18:50       you will know. Say you're making it. It's very interesting. It's interesting stuff. Any money you will make it French or rice. Oh my goodness. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         01:18:59       So, so can I, can I bring up a question here that I have on my mind? Uh, you can. Okay. You know, there's been a lot of this LBG, LBGT, whatever it's called. So the issue is like going to the bathroom. Okay. Yeah, that's a popular topic on the show. Okay. Going to the bathroom is, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Now if you have a transgender person who says, I, I'm more, I want to use the ladies' bathroom. Yeah. Even though he has the physical characteristics of a male. Right. How are the, when he goes into a woman's, they, you stalls on the women's. So it's a little bit different. But if, if the guy gets out of a stall, how are the women going to know he's transgender and not some guy who was in there looking for a peak?

Speaker 14:         01:19:50       Well, I mean transgender people don't look like a guy looking for a peak. No, but how do they know that? Well, what do you mean? How did they know that? Why did he is not really how, but that seems to not be an issue. Like it's, it's the issue of people like saying it, but it's not. But what I'm saying, I understand his question now. I don't think somebody is not really just gender. Right. I use the skews of it. Their agenda right there is as a transgender. Right. But it really is a male. Right. He can go into the ladies room. What I'm saying is I understand that and what I, what I'm saying is as of now, yeah, that's not an issue because, no, it's not, it's not an issue because, because we have transgender people using restrooms all the time now. Yeah. And the occurrences that you're speaking of are obviously an anomaly because,

Speaker 13:         01:20:44       well, they have, it's gone. It has an APP, you know, we act as an API yet, but it's I rapists. But I mean those are anomalies. Yeah. So you can't just say, well the one guy who was posing as it was faking, so therefore all the other transgender people who are transgender, I mean you're talking about like, so the one in a thousand thing needs to be, so I think [inaudible] are we going to go to rather than a for the future multisectoral Unisex restrooms. Yeah, I think we are. Yeah. That's where I think it's all going. We're going to a bigger bathrooms. Yeah, but the issue you bring up, I don't think it's an issue. You don't think it's an issue? I mean, it's not an issue. It's an issue of the imagination, but it's not an actual real world issue because we do have transgender people using restrooms. Yeah. Using the opposite sex restroom. I have never seen, most people just want to relieve themselves. I haven't seen that yet. But it's happening all the time. You don't even know it. Shut it down. How do we do not, well, we haven't had any people that look male in the grocery. I'm wanting to know the difference. The other guy, you can be transgender and still dress, get you as a male and you're, and you're, and you're inside. You're a female. No, that's, that's not really, that's the work that way. No. No. Okay. All right.

Speaker 14:         01:22:03       Okay. Yeah, I think the issue is not an issue. The issue is econ bullying because there is so much going on lately and every sense that it could be a great business says, okay, this is my chance. No, it could happen. I'm not saying it couldn't, but I also think that like, it's like the rapist is still gonna rape. Whether or not we have this, he doesn't need to be. Yeah. This issue is actually completely different. Prophets are rapist. No, no. Or even a paper. It's like they're going to do that regardless of the rule. Most people want to just go to the bathroom in comfort and just feel feeling. I can appreciate that more than anyone. I know you can. I know you can. Um, wanted to show you this now that we got off of that serious topic, um, uh, this apparently this guy made this and there's an argument that it's the longest fart ever. Um, yeah, this one. Oh, there's an argument whether, yeah,

Speaker 21:         01:23:05       tell me if you think it's real because you can see him breathing. You can hear the room tone audio. He's got a microphone there. The bed. I know the guys had a lot of parts consistent. Yeah. Great.

Speaker 13:         01:23:46       I think that when you have a real fart like that,

Speaker 13:         01:23:52       it's, the tone is to consistent and almost like as a mechanical device further for awhile because you have this consistent tone and as you have pressure released in your large bowel, okay. It's not going to be completely consistent. So, but it doesn't sound completely consistent. It goes, well there's a longer, I know, but there's a long section in there that there that it sounds like it was just the, the frequency didn't really change that much. I have had long farms. Yeah. You have really long for it. Well, she does. Oh, scream from the bedroom. I'm in the bathroom. Oh my God. I can't believe how long I know what, he's a long prayer. Unfortunately. Sound comfortable. There's no way you can last that long and it still keep going. Yeah, I don't agree. That doesn't mean that it made up. I can pretend to do anything of this song.

Speaker 21:         01:24:45       Okay.

Speaker 13:         01:24:45       This is Charla. Mommy,

Speaker 22:         01:24:54       John Doe Music. I know mom's told you both got done. Yeah. So you hear it. I like it right here. All right, well someone else did it. Matthew Miller made the song for the last time you were on the show like a long time ago. Cause it's, it's good. It's really good. There's a few for dad.

Speaker 13:         01:26:24       You know, I, I think, I think I told her at the time. Yeah. But I took in the terror and the Orlando right dump. They kind of went through my pants and she knows. Do you know about that one though? It went through his pants and he couldn't get it off. So he flew with, got got on the pants. That was it. I had no choice.

Speaker 16:         01:26:52       Yeah. Well. And you go to the bathroom before you go?

Speaker 13:         01:26:54       No, I, I raced into the men's room there, but I just didn't make it in time. So I had to ditch my underwear in, in the or with Gacaca and your pants and get in the plane. I wiped it off as best I could. Okay. Ah, flush four or five times.
