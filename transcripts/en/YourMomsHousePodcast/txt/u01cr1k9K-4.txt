Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Well go to your mom's house, Christina Vincent.

Speaker 1:          00:00:31       anymore

Speaker 2:          00:00:32       any more and just do it like we always do. It wasn't so much to ask.

Speaker 1:          00:00:43       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:44       Anything else? Can you eat your sandwich or something? No, you can just do the minimum. Oh my God, I did everything else. I put in all of the things I did the lighting. Okay. Don't act like I don't do it all good. I don't do it all. I do lots. You want to do it all? Hello? Do you have anything you want to point out to our listeners? Know why? What? What's the big deal? Well, you said you, what's happening? There's nothing going on. You said you guys and messages. I said that I read the comments on our youtube channel and some people are saying that I look pregnant and you know, that's very rude. Um, especially cause those mother fuckers are right.

Speaker 2:          00:01:34       Number two. Number two, thug is incubating right now as you call him. It's a boy. It's a boy. It's a boy. Number two. So yeah, we're in second trimester and I had to hide it this whole time and now you can just let it out like, oh my God. And there is so big, my milkers are so big and everything is so big right now. You're trying to cover them up. Pointless. I got lucky though because our cars are, um, the holidays as when I had my first trimester. I got pregnant in October, so I got to be kind of sick and on the downlow outside of all the cameras, which was nice. But then I couldn't hide it. The last two weeks I've been wearing sweatshirts. You have seen the comments. I've seen him too. That's up. Look pregnant. I know. And with your second child, apparently you show way quicker and I was showing like at five weeks I felt fat as shit already.

Speaker 2:          00:02:26       So. Well, it's exciting. Very exciting. Number over to [inaudible] number two, two thugs in the house. Now what are we going to name this one? When are you thinking? Well, we fucked up on the last one because we were going to go with a Ruth's Chris. Tom's Ruth's Chris. Tom's Ruth's Chris and then called junior. Well because I ate so much of it. Yeah. With Ellis, we should've named him Carl's junior. Now this one I know was also a fan of daily time daily. I think that's a really good name for it. The Sun. That's a good one. But this baby I've really been craving. So

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       I was thinking Domino's, Domino's or domino. We're about thin crust. Oh cause that's what I'm, my jam right now is thing. Crest domino. Thank crest extra cheese and pepper. Tony's on there. The domino sounds kinda like a cool name. Like it was no sub domino. Our blanket. I like blanket blanket blanket like Mike. Yeah, nobody's named domino. That'd be really original. Great Name. But yeah, Carl's Jr we're going to go and have his name legally changed to Carl's Jr and then this one we're going to do dominant. I leg it. Well, uh, there's a lot to cover. Um, we'll talk about all this stuff and the naming of our second thug and more. Let's get the show started and let's keep it a fun, you know, mean people's main concern. Obviously when, when we had a kid last time, they're like, oh, he's having a kid going to make you squares or make you know, more fun. And Joey Diaz was very worried that I might become a woman. Don't become a woman, become a woman. He said. So I hope that never happened. That was my wife. I hope you stay and not a woman. Yeah. I'm gonna cut my hair off with this one though. Here we go. Jane started. Let's get the party started.

Speaker 4:          00:04:13       Okay. And I just wanted to share with all of you why I felt the need to share me placing menstrual blood all over my face and what power it holds for us as women earn these products that we've been shaming for so many lifetimes,

Speaker 3:          00:04:47       period. Blood on the face to add a pretty raw, pretty nasty people, by the way. Thank you. A lot of people have messaged me that they watched my new special disgraceful on Netflix over the weekend. I've got, I really received a between comments and emails and the thousands of messages. So I thank you all for them. Uh, much love, no hate f all the haters, but uh, it's been, well, I still have no, hey, overwhelming people telling me that I'm nasty as hell. I'm the next champ. Yeah, no, that's, there's no way. You're the nasty champ. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:05:26       Oh No,

Speaker 3:          00:05:29       no, no, no, no. Everybody was telling me, they're like, it's funny. You're nasty as hell. You still grossed you nasty. Yes. Listen, I've been nasty supreme of this household. No Way. You've even attacked me for being so nasty. You're like, you're telling me how nasty I am with my farts and like how I'm just, I talk and think. Just disturbed to crave things. Yeah. But that's at our home life. But on stage I would say the, I'm the Nastier

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       and I'm way Nastier than, but you're a woman, you know? But that's why it makes more of an impact. I'm even nastier register as an impact, but I'm definitely aware of the crowd. You're the nasty champ. That's some bull shit right there. True. No, I am the nasty champ. Everybody asks you in bed last night. Oh, you were like, have you ever heard of this? The scrum Gob Gobbler the chumps smuggler? No. What I asked you was, do you know, do you know what a ball hog is? Yeah. Okay. So it's a sports term. In sports, if you play basketball or soccer and somebody won't pass the ball there, a ball hog, like they're hogging the ball right there. They're not sharing, they're not passing it around. They're keeping it all to themselves. So they're called a ball hog and I found that term being exploited by a different industry.

Speaker 5:          00:06:53       Hi. And I'm Blah [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:07:17       stupid. How come that wasn't the opening class? How'd you pass out or menstrual blood lady? I wanted to save it for you. She nasty, nasty champ, not us. I love that they took, I love when they take an innocent sport's term, like your Bhag, share the ball. They turned it into a vile, perverted slang. It's just such a, another silly porno Yang, like there's no woman on the plant. And really maybe there's like two fucking freak shows out there and they're like, I love balls. I got to have them. I'm out. I'm a ball. If this is such a fucking dumb fantasy, it's such a not why. It's hilarious. No, and really does nobody know.

Speaker 5:          00:08:09       I love sucking on Fox

Speaker 2:          00:08:15       and they have a whole series. Oh yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:08:18       Hi, I'm Payton Lafferty Lafferty.

Speaker 2:          00:08:22       That sounds like a Peyton Manning, so you have to like hate and last day they have to say their name. They have to say that they're a ball hog and then they have to just suck balls for like these whole things. Dude, it is easy money. There's a lot of funny ball talk, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:08:38       Oh fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:08:42       Lot of vocal fry balls are funny though. They're funny. The problem with balls, there's a, there's a smell sometimes if they're not clean enough, but other than that balls are pretty low maintenance.

Speaker 5:          00:08:54       Sniff, sniff. Okay. Now let me put it right up against your eye. Bat your eyelashes.

Speaker 2:          00:09:12       There's like five people on the planet that really had this. They were like, put your eyelashes against my balls. Yeah, it's not a lot. Are you into that? No, not really. I should try it out. You know, we got to put this one aside for doctor drew the ball worship, make it make a drew list. True. Um, me. Oh, the trial. So my show, I watch your show and I just get, that's what drew basically told us. This is the sad ever piss on me. Beat me black guys. Do you think you could ever be

Speaker 5:          00:10:04       girl

Speaker 2:          00:10:07       on the com? Yeah, he's got to rub his balls on the, come down and give a shit. Here's the thing, man. Anything that doesn't involve come on my face or getting an STD. Nothing can happen from putting big deal man. I mean, what's the going rate for something like, I mean not, not as, not as me now. Oh as like a comedian and mother of almost two children. Oh, I've millions, millions but light. It's going to ruin my life. It's not possible. You're short on that and I don't care if my life is in the toilet for the rest of it. The rest of it. Yeah. Like I pushed the ball scene out of that. Let's just say, yeah, like 20 years ago. I'm just, who cares? I'm gonna ruin my life. Yeah, let's just have one of those girls. Like it's just, it's never gonna happen for me.

Speaker 2:          00:10:57       Yeah. I do a ball scene for like $1,500 that's not, that's not bad. I think you're asking you for a little much. I think they would probably be like, get out of here. That's you're not, you're not doing it ruining my life for 1500 care about that part. They're like, this is a ball scene. Just balls. But here's what I would do. Being the entrepreneur that I am, I would, I would open up my own website and I would be the ball girl. Oh, you know what I mean? I would, I would make it and I do the eyelash on the balls and I had to put my feet on the balls. Like I'd be the ball queen is how I would do it. You know, I'd make a business out of it. That's pretty good. And I charge guys to come over and then I'd smashed their balls or whatever. Making House calls. That's extra money though cause I've already ruined my life. I'm the ball 80 for the rest of it. So I really gotta yeah, I gotta try it out. What would you do? Well now that I want to be the entrepreneur, I think like go back 20 years and I go uh, if I could go back

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       in time and be like I don't want the life that I have now I want to go down to the CD path. Then I would start my own site called a Gargle, my balls.com and like you're thinking and then I would be like into camera like, hey it's me. You know which one are you dumb hookers out there with sucking my balls. So many. And then some girl would walk in and be like, I would like sniff my balls. Get your nose in there. Yeah, that's a different life

Speaker 2:          00:12:27       path. Right. As I was saying, if you really want to throw it in the toilet, but you got to think in terms of branding and long term, I think it's a good brand to get into. I think so. It's a niche market. Yeah. I think there's a lot of people would be like, it was pretty interesting lane here and maybe there's some awards. I don't know. It's not that bad. But the farting, that's not bad either. The fart videos. Easy money. Really. If all the genres, um, the FARC videos the easiest. Yeah. There's got to eat food. Fucking dude fart all day. Every day. That's right. You didn't imagine being pregnant. I do. The pregnant lady stuff. Even better money. That's when I really jack up the prices.

Speaker 3:          00:13:05       Yeah. Yeah. A lot of fun. Nope. Seems like we have a fun new lane to explore with the balls. It's not bad. It's not bad at all. Try it out.

Speaker 2:          00:13:19       Try it out. Try it out. Go have fun. You'll trust first fun stuff out. So back to period, blood on your face. Um, what about this video? Would you ever make that video? Which video would you make? Um, which one is more harmful to you? You think? Oh fuck. I mean it's you

Speaker 3:          00:13:38       20 cause it menstrual blood on it cause I think that one would tell people it's different signals you're sending. One of them is like, I mean we haven't even seen this yet, but she says I smear period of my, um, I think that would tell people you're mentally ill and then the ball one might just be like, oh she's, she needed money. She's desperate. She's sad.

Speaker 2:          00:14:01       Well it's the, would she rather, it's the word you placed a shame. It's the original. What'd you rather, would you rather masturbate in front of your family or you, am I going to assume responsibility and be mentally ill or

Speaker 3:          00:14:14       I can't believe I'm thinking this, but I think I'd rather there's a ball video of you exist then period. Blood because period blood on your face. Yeah. You can't really explain that one. Explain it. There's no going back. Let's hear her. Explain it.

Speaker 4:          00:14:28       Three reclaiming the blood and through reclaiming our menstrual cycle. Yeah, fully allowed me to embody like everything that I was fully allowed me to have the freedom to be able to express who I was in every way. This,

Speaker 3:          00:14:41       you know this thing about, Oh hey, oh, Gilmartin's here. This is not how this is supposed to go. All right, let's stop. All right,

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       so, uh, we re settled, um, and you want to introduce our guests with us? Is that fantastic? Paul Gil Martin from the, uh, mental illness. Happy Hour, Clara for Paul. I mean, that's the how we do this. Well, how do you do just awkward silence? That's usually it is. And then, and then, uh, you guys have done each other's podcasts. He's been a guest on that deep, Bro. I've been a guest on his show and I thought, why not have them on your mom's house? This is a perfect fit. It don't, you know, I invited myself. No, no, not true. Yes. I said, you know, if you, if you ever need gas, I'd love to do your podcast. So No, I'm happy you're here. I learned my lesson spending last year alone on Christmas Eve, Christmas and my birthday. You know, want to be stubborn. BEACOPP yeah. When you have needs speak up.

Speaker 2:          00:15:41       I think I've been stubborn about that shit more times than I'd like to admit in my life about like, nope, I'll just stay here and, and I'll just show everybody by staying here. It's not saying what I want. Right. Yeah. And I can't be rejected. Yeah. And I get to know my video game. Yeah, exactly. Maybe I'll find a new porn clip there. Hey, I'll get an APP and we have a, we were just playing this porn clip called ball hogs. Um, it's a familiar with it. Um, well there's a, a line of, uh, I mean, you're familiar with the term ball hog in terms of sports. Yes. Somebody who won't pass the ball. Right. So there's a series adult series called ball hogs. It sounds like this. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:16:25       Hi, I'm Sierra and I'm Bala.

Speaker 2:          00:16:35       Well, they just really like balls. Um, here's something that you will never hear about pornography. Somebody watching it. I wish the sound was more graphic. Yeah. Yeah. More detailed, more s, more smacking and drooling, a lot shows up, pillows, balls. We were talking about the ball clip and then we switched to this woman who is, um, she was explaining how she's trying to, what does it like recapture her family. There's this whole thing about shame, uh, in a, uh, when it comes to women's menstrual cycles. And so some women like to reclaim their menstrual cycle and that's what she's doing. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:17:19       yeah. Do it. Reclaiming the blood through a private link reclaiming our menstrual cycle. It fully allowed me to embody like everything that I was, it fully allowed me to have the freedom to be able to express who I was in every way.

Speaker 2:          00:17:32       I gotta say one of the things I'm happy about what she did and what she's talking about is fucking gross, but it's nice that she's attractive. It helps. If it was like somebody gross doing it, I'd be like, this is really nice. That's a really shallow thing to say, but it's actually really true. Yeah. If she weren't hot, we would

Speaker 6:          00:17:50       all be more like not watch all the clips. We would stop and be like, she's really gross. I, I've only seen five seconds with this cliff. But the first thing that comes to my mind is she's desperate for auditions. I think she's one to go in. Do you think supposed to be a ball hog or like a real active? All the boobs don't look natural. No, no. Extremely made up for it. So it's like if you're going to do the whole menstrual blood thing, why not not wear makeup? You know why not be completely stripped down completely as you, I'm not saying be naked, but be as you are completely right like your vagina and match naturally for the full, the full effect. That is a very interesting point that she's doing like this. I'm connected to who I am. I couldn't be more done up and it looks like fake boobs.

Speaker 6:          00:18:39       I could be wrong. I mean, Hey, wait a minute. Isn't that why she needs to reclaim her natural essence? Maybe she is so disconnected because of the fake blueberry and all this. No, this is like a whole other level. I didn't think we were going to get to, come on, come on. By putting these up on social media, I really found it just kind of gave an invitation to people to be able to know that it's okay to share this part of yourself. No, that's not the message at all. There are some things you shouldn't share with social media. One of them would be willing to face, you know, I'm a little ashamed of the noises I make when I Shit, but I dunno if I want to try to ease the public into accepting that.

Speaker 6:          00:19:27       Well maybe, but maybe what she's talking about here is you taking that leap and knowing that you know what you should be. Okay. And how about you posting one of those videos of you taking a Grunty Shit? Yeah. And, and, and kind of knowing that it's okay. Paul, you're a person. I love the word guarantee. Why? Why this insistence that everybody be comfortable with everything publicly. Now I don't show a little bit of shame in your game. Just a little a is fine. I don't think a lot of us feel invisible in our lives. Like something's missing. Like there's something special about us that isn't being recognized and we just need to find what that is. And then the emptiness will be filled. Yeah. So her specialness is, or period is what you're saying. Yeah, and probably because nobody else has done that. So it's like, oh, like the episode I was listening to where you guys were talking about possum possum guy in purple lady and Michael's arts and crafts. Like the people that find their identity through, yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a lady at the coffee shop I go to who is hat lady and her hats like, like if it was this, it was the set of a James Cameron movie, her hat, you would go by, they put a little too much effort into it. It's, it's the most ornate crazy,

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       it's a nativity scene on, on a person's head and each one's different and God bless her, you know, if that makes her happy to do that. But I think it has the opposite effect. When people look at it, they go, oh, she's, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's exactly it. Am I going to, I guess we were having the discussion if, if she had to choose between being one of the ball hog girls, right. Or the menstrual blood lady, who would you rather be? And I think it's like, it's do you want to own being like crazy kind of crazy or if you're the ball you can be like, well they kind of did it to me. You know what I mean? Like I've been to, and it was a money thing. Maybe I did this for a living when I was, cause I actually think that like the ball Hogwan you'd be like, you kind of have some empathy, like she's probably in a bad place and she needed some money. I'm like, but I think it's almost better to be a ball hog than crazy hat lady, you know, is at least someone's jerking off to it, jerking off their hat, laying low and not a one guy in Germany are always. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:21:53       You know, it's been really hard to face off with all of the negative comments on me. You know they were coming. They were not asking anyone else to do this. I'm just saying this has been my experience and it's been really empowering and it felt really good to connect with that part of it.

Speaker 2:          00:22:10       Your you and your sister hood has really, really challenges the definition of empowering. Yep. Well, I've always thought that the yes, that Ha. First of all, pornography is empowering. Being a stripper is empowering, rubbing menstrual blood on our face. Is this empowering? You know what though? What it boils down to is the same strokes where everybody, everybody likes the same thing. That's all different. Different strokes for for her it's empowering. For me, I'm indifferent. I don't have any negativity towards menstrual blood. I don't have any preference. Do you think 20 years from now she's going to look at this clip and roll, roll her eyes or be like, yeah, I'm glad I did that. I mean, any healthy person rolls their eyes and what they did 20 years ago. I hope so. Anybody who's making progress 20 years is, yeah, that's a lifetime. That's a long time. Let's see it. Are we going to see her face, right? Oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:23:13       Hmm. Wow. There you go. You know, Paul, now you said the actress thing. I feel like this was kind of an actory. I don't think there's any doubt. Yeah. I don't think there's any doubt. Do you think there's any frustrated actress? Yeah, you're right. You think there's any right? That's like fucking James Cameron will see this. Yes. Oh yeah. That's like, you get like lost in the delusion of, Oh, I, I, I experienced that. I want it on an audition. One time it was for a Steven Soderbergh movie. Jerked off all over the road. I had the decency to do

Speaker 6:          00:23:46       it in the parking garage, go to the roof parking where nobody is. And uh, I went on and I never get auditions. And it's like, all of a sudden it's just Steven Soderbergh movie I'm auditioning for. So I'm super excited and, uh, I do this a republican character, uh, sometimes for, for comedy. And I thought, oh, this guy's perfect for this audition, this, this part is perfect for this, this guy. And I'm like, there's nobody more perfect for this part. I'm going to get this and it's Steven Soderbergh. It's probably going to be an award winning movie. That part's going to be, I'm probably going to get an award for this and then I'm tripping. Imagining my, not only me giving an award speech, but me arguing with people the next day who I forgot to include in my speed

Speaker 7:          00:24:40       while I'm waiting to go in on the fucking audition and I go in and I'm a horrible, horrible, I didn't even get a call back back.

Speaker 6:          00:24:47       I feel so good. I know that I'm not alone because I've had like I've had those same fantasies and like have thought about like what I wear a Tux or would I wear a suit and like take myself through the whole thing. Absolutely. And then you, then you get the call. Like the actually they, they didn't even say anything about your audition. They didn't even acknowledge that you auditioned. We tried to find out and they don't remember who you are and I'm like, oh no. That moment you had, for those of you I've never heard of Paul Gil Martin or the mental illness happy hour. That's basically like what your show is, is having these moments of being painfully honest and, yes. And I should have mentioned, sorry earlier. Uh, you're also stand up comedian. You been on television a million things. That is it dinner and a movie.

Speaker 6:          00:25:34       That was the thing that probably most people know me from a new comedy central half hour and stuff like that, but I don't do and Chris stand up anymore. Um, yes. When I'm not doing anything, I'm at the Christian science reading room and I laid off, I read through a monocle. Wow. I want to clash it up. Yeah. Yeah. The old school, I liked what you don't do stand up anymore. I don't, I just do this a satirical republican character sometimes, but as far as going to clubs and doing that now I bought five years ago, I just kind of hit a wall and when I have an agreement with the entertainment industry, uh, they won't show an interest in me and I won't show an interest in that. We both kept our under the bark. Uh, do you get to perform the character, the Republican character? I'm like on live stages and yeah, go on. Uh, Carolla's podcast. Oh by, uh, do it on Jimmy Doors. Uh, Jimmy Dore Does live shows. Um, so I do with there, there's some youtube clips. I put a fake campaign ad out about, I don't know, 10 years ago as a guy, but it's really fun to do because it's kind of like my,

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       my picket sign of when I get pissed off about shit. Oh yeah, there are a hypocrite. So I just pour it all into this kind of clueless character. That's fine. Who is a hypocrite. Yes. It must be. You must be really like searching for material these days. Not really allowed to talk about, oh my God, it's, it's, it can be overwhelming. I guess. It's funny because when I started doing the character, it was almost cartoony and now it reality has caught up to it. Yeah. So it's really just rearranging the reality into a punchline, right? Cause I guess you could see the character down and be like, yeah, I believe that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Where's he representative? Actually, a lot of times when I do it, people don't know. It's not a real character. Do you get people to get angry at you? Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:27:28       Oh yeah. Cause his, his views are like, you know, one of the things he says is, is uh, Mexicans make two things, tortillas in trouble. No, that's fantastic. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, yeah. Know my favorite thing about like those guys in real life is, and that's why that line works so well is like a fifth grade level vocabulary, which they did this thing during like the, the uh, the campaigns like leading up to the election and they actually found that like, uh, they studied all these interviews and speeches that Trump did and found that he had like, he stayed in like a third to fifth grade level vocabulary easily. And that actually, that, that had a huge impact. He's one of us, he would say things like, things are bad things or sad, awful. This is just terrible. And it never would leave that range of kind of simplistic language.

Speaker 2:          00:28:18       I thought it was really fascinating language study. Even though he said, I have the best words, I have the best words. And I'm like really smart. Really smart. Really smart. I'm like genius, right? Pretty much. Um, you were asking me last week how, um, how people in Star Wars Yeah. Communicate with like the monsters, you know, like the bookies and watch the star wars films. You'll notice that Chewbacca and uh, our R Two d two, it's always, and then the actors like what's that are too? You want dinner? He's like, well you want a hot dog? Apparently this guy has like a, like Kentucky, oh Jesus. Many people have asked me to do my Chewbacca or am I walking impersonation? And by that I mean my mother language and found out it's actually three languages. It's not, it's not just a bunch of sounds and whatever. And I went back to Wikipedia, found the language does, I'm going to use, which is called true to work. It's a, the called the common language of the Wiki people. It's actually for trade and travel. It's the one that most non wookey's would have used in the stories. This is one of the most disturbing levels of fandom is when they going like, this

Speaker 6:          00:29:42       is real. You know how these people in this world and you're like, that's a made up world bro. But like not like, he's like, well I'm more than the, some of the natives prefer to address it this way. You're like, it's all made up, man. We talking about PDS. How Wikipedia, without further ado,

Speaker 8:          00:30:01       hello, how are you? Goodbye. I will. Thank you. Was

Speaker 6:          00:30:12       not just making Sam a friend. So I don't know. I love that somebody gets so into something. It's just so hard to take it seriously when it's so niche. Cause I think all of us, maybe I should just include myself, find something I like and get, we were kind of talking about this before we start recording and get ridiculously into it. Like when I discovered we get obsessed, oh, when I, when I, uh, discovered good wine for the first time. I mean, I'd been a drinker all along. I'm sober now, but I've been a drinker all along. But I had always thought, oh wine, you know, that's for pussies. You know, what's the big deal? And I was buying a, a friend of mine, a bottle of wine because he loved wine. And I said to the, to the clerk, you know what if I give you 50 bucks for a bottle of wine that you think is awesome, uh, I'd, I'd like to try that.

Speaker 6:          00:31:04       And so I took it home and it blew my fucking mind really. And within three months, I had 24 cases, a vintage wine in a rented humidity controlled storage locker and was searching for wine every day on the Internet. You've got obsessed, dude. I thought you were about to say I was 25 grand in debt. That too. That too. Hey, sorry to interrupt, but can I move this? Cause I can tell that it's blocking my face. What was that? Oh, now can you be, is he cool? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Just for editing because I can see you perfect it. And it's that way with everything that, that I get into this, I run the wheels off it. When I got into photography, taking pictures of dogs, photography, especially if it's pictures of dogs is photography within the, within the first year of having that camera, I took so many pictures, the counter rolled over, which means over 10,000 pictures.

Speaker 6:          00:32:10       So I you have a real obsessive, totally, totally obsessive. Yeah. I've never, I've never done anything in moderation. Is that alcoholism? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. It presents itself in many forms and junkies. Oh, you mean alcoholics? Like it's the similar, yeah, it's all, it doesn't really matter what the substance is. It's the trying to distract yourself from the discomfort of being in your skin. So how long, wait, how long have you been sober? For? 14 years. So that's a long time. Congratulations. Um, is there, was there something that you took to immediately after like your sobriety began? In other words, like some people, as soon as they go sober, they're like, I really got to get into this working. Within six months I had a full on cabinet shop and my, now that paid dividends because I know how to make furniture fucking really? Oh yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:33:05       I could show you pictures. I make mid century modern. Yeah. And I still do that, but I'm not obsessive about it. But it was to the point where I would be at dinner with my wife now, my ex wife and she would be saying something to me and I would be half listening and the other half of me would be saying, oh, what kind of joints should I do it dovetail joint on that thing or what kind of wood should I use? And I know now looking back cause I'm not as obsessive about things that it was a way of me distracting myself from shit I'd buried as a, as a kid, but it everything do you have that weren't day kind of upset or many upsets are really not really, which is nice. Yeah. It's nice. Myself, I guess that's my current day obsession. That's good.

Speaker 6:          00:33:49       Or will be till the day I die. Yeah. I mean I think what a lot of people at least hear about or some of us know people that go sober and some of them get really into fitness and exercise or food. Yeah. Uh, which is the opposite first. Uh, the first probably three months of my sobriety, I was doing a nine shots of espresso a day. Oh my God, man. You know, uh, one guy who does he, I think he does double that a day over ice. Um, no, I do, I do a lot. But now this dude does just straight up espresso on ice when he pitches just, just the bean come out and like he, he ended those, the hardcore workouts and he does a lots of candy. Candy, sugar, sugar rushes. Yeah. I'm just coming off a one year Ben and Jerry's bender.

Speaker 6:          00:34:46       What was your flavor? A American dream. What's in that? It's so perfect. It's vanilla ice cream, but like really, really good vanilla ice cream. And then fudge covered, uh, chunks of waffle cone fuck and caramel swirled in, in every once in a while you'll hit a, a caramel deposit that it seems like the Ben and Jerry worker had nodded off at the Carmel Lever, you know, and it's just like, oh my God, I can't go to bed now. I got to see where this fucking thing ends. So real danger for me is ice cream. Really dangerous. I've got some over the holidays where it, cause we don't normally have it and like what do you like? I'm pretty, I'm pretty much a purist, pretty simple with I like vanilla ice cream with chocolate chip and not mint chocolate chip, just regular truck, mint flavored.

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       Anything like one of those where you can taste like vanilla bean really tight. And then like the offset with like that crunchy chocolate. It's all about the texture man. And then I also, uh, I love that there's multiple versions of this, but all the different cookies and cream ones I can like I can get a pint of that and within minutes being like, oh, I can see the bottom of the pipe right now cause I get zoned out and be like, um, I'm like, I feel sick to my stomach and that stop. And then the ice cream farts two hours later. Those are a whole lever, uh, level of, of sulfur that like the other, it's, they're hot, they come out almost hot. But my stomach will start hurting and I'll get gas under my ribs. And I found that I'm lactose intolerant and you know what, then that's ancient.

Speaker 3:          00:36:27       By the way. You don't get gas, you don't know it's party get gas, but it goes under my ribs hurt. That's the fucking worst pain. I feel like the, the bullshit though is because I tried for a while when I was buying it more is like s like, you know soy ice cream garbage man. What's the point? All, all the knock off. Like this isn't real ice cream is dog shit. Yeah. You gotta have realized, how do you feel about frozen younger guys? I mean I'll fucking eat it, you know, but I always feel like I wish I had ice cream right now. You know, kind of like it cause I liked the shittiness of it. I liked, you know what? I like Mcdonald's Sundays, they're fucking great. There are hot fudge Sundaes are fucking great. Tastes like ice cream. Mcflurries remember we know a guy who was so such that he would get two different McFlurries because he doesn't want to mix the tastes of who hurt him.

Speaker 3:          00:37:21       His monitor his daddy. He was hurt by his daddy. I think he had a really weird relationship with his mommy finding out. A lot of people did. Yeah, he went to podcast. Yep. Fucking depressed when, when? When I weapons spoken to him in a long time. But man, when he went down this, this kind of depression cycle, he went down the food and I remember there was drinking a fucking two leader, like was sitting with sugar, uh, a Pepsi Max, which is like they're, they're amped up Pepsi, Pepsi Max. He was doing, he would get a six pack of Cinnabons. Yes. How was he not a diabetic? He became a diabetic. Yeah. Through it. Well, he reached his goal. He would eat. So of the six he would eat one, two, three, four and the inside of five and then so he would have one and a half left to tell himself that he has control thing. It was fucking nuts man. Wow. And as you still learn it? No, he's out of it now. It was, but he was, I've been in that vortex. It's, yeah, it was bad. Your brain is saying one thing and your body is just going fuck off off.

Speaker 6:          00:38:36       To see someone

Speaker 3:          00:38:37       in that and not know what's going on is like really alarming because I think all of us were like, what the fuck are you doing? Right? Yeah. You know

Speaker 6:          00:38:45       that's bad. That's real deep though. What's the longest time you've ever spent looking for a porn clip? Not a specific one, but you know that when you're looking at porn and you're not just like, all right, I'm just going to look at this and I'm going to jerk off and get the anxiety out or whatever, but you're like the hunt for the clip. The Jam you're getting, you're getting high off than just the anticipation of this is going to get real dark real quick for me. Not Long, long time. Five, six hours probably for me. I've done that five or six hours you guys. Oh yeah. I've gone without eating. I lost weight one time. I want it on such a porn porn vantage. It was shortly after I got out of my marriage.

Speaker 3:          00:39:28       Just didn't want to feel. This is so embarrassing. But I moved when I had lived alone. It was like a year after I moved out here and I would go down those like long rabbit hole foreign searches and I remember one time I got a phone call from one of my aunts and I stayed on the phone with her as I look through clothes for shoes but not masturbating, just like perusing, realizing that I was so in the zone, like zoned out that I was like, yeah, no, yeah, we would be good to see you. And then I would keep clicking through stuff and seeing and they're like, no, no. Did you have the decency to switch to incest porn? No. No. I wanted to, I wanted to stay true to what I was into at the time, but it was fucking how half assed or those answers when you're oh yeah, that's the thing is what, just like a roll out of it. That was that. I could tell her voice like the way she was answering me, it was like, what are you doing? Right? Like what you what? I mean, she was like, uh Huh. Like, okay. Like

Speaker 6:          00:40:29       she could tell that I wasn't paying attention. You can tell when someone is not paying and that's when I was laying attention. I was like, no, I know. It was times on the road when I call you when you were like, ah, yeah, no, you're doing your porn sir.

Speaker 3:          00:40:39       No, it's usually sports. What are your sports? I'm just a big football fan. I like you used to play right? No, no. I mean I played high school football but okay. But I mean I like college football and I'll watch highlights and I'd be like, oh, that's crazy. And, but I don't know. I get, I get sucked into that but not, I don't get like zoned out by that. Really.

Speaker 6:          00:40:57       I use map my TV I liked, I like my TV yell, mom likes her shows. I go down rabbit holes of shows like benchings. There's like two categories. There's the one that that released the drugs in your brain. Yeah. And then there's the ones that are just kind of interesting to you. Like, yeah, that's when I tried to like um, like vintage hockey fights. I like those but I don't like get high. Right, right, right, right. But like porn, I will just feel like dopamine they ended is just like, yes, let's keep going. Yeah. Your reptilian brain food. That's true foods. Avast

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       I got to slow it down cause I'm preggers right now I'm going went down. We'll know because I've already gained too much weight for the pregnancy. Like I got, I got a talking to from the doctor already so. Wow. Well cause I was eating, I was doing Domino's pizza for like the first trimester because your son, you're nauseous so you don't really want to eat. So when you do want to eat it's going to be crap just because like your body wants carbs. The baby ones, carbs. So I was like waffles a cheeseburger is at midnight and then yeah, just, it's already packed. It's what I feel like I've got to reign it in kind of a shameful speech. She was like, so we're not going to do that again, are we? I was like, Oh shit, I better go eat some vegetables as her husband.

Speaker 2:          00:42:16       Where do you do on the sidelines if you see her starting to go over the edge because there's a fine line there. It looks like you don't want to be controlling or insulting or feel like you're objectifying. Not, that is fine. I think that's, I think most, I mean, unless I saw her something doing like destructively eating, I was, yeah, I'm just like, whatever you want and just totally cool with me. Well, I think I ran it into, and I know you're not out of control. That's what I'm saying. But like, yeah, I mean when, I don't know, anytime I've been around any pregnant woman who's like, I got to eat. I'm just like, all right. Yeah, that's the, that's the go flag. That's the green flag or whatever. They do. No real argument against that. But I gained a lot of weight.

Speaker 2:          00:42:59       I gained weight too much because I was eating Carl's Jr twice a week. The best was his, his um, his sheep or like how you should eat, how he eats because he was like a very like thin, you know you could tell like type it in control guy and it was like have four almonds have this thing literally for Asparagus, fuck to medium size. I read it. I was like this is what he eats. This dude eats this and he's just like this is what you should eat. And then once a week he sees a dominatrix to let go of all this. Yes. Those are the guys that go to the dominate tricks. Oh and he goes at the bottom of the sheet, it's like once a week you can splurge and have two ounces of ice cream. What is two ounces? The two licks I do, I look at somebody like that and they might as well be from another planet. Like I used to look at people that would only finish half a beer and I would just think what is that like? Yeah. It's like how do you do, what is your native language?

Speaker 1:          00:44:00       Wow

Speaker 2:          00:44:03       Sake. I think Meyer has been pulled out of the socket.

Speaker 1:          00:44:06       No.

Speaker 2:          00:44:10       Why did you pick out someone? One fourth year size. So this guy would be the kind of guy that is from another planet and I think here he actually shifts to another language.

Speaker 1:          00:44:20       Rawr Rawr Rawr Rawr Rawr Rawr Rawr Rawr Rawr.

Speaker 2:          00:44:26       Approximately. He says he's a Jedi Knight now for those who didn't follow it, I'll do it in motion now.

Speaker 3:          00:44:33       I can't take it man. Can't take it either. But that dude really thinks he's teaching Tom Stand. How much money for you to learn Chewbacca language? And I mean learn it fluently. Like I know you're doing Rosetta stone for Italian. You're doing Rosetta stone for wookie. It, it would seriously be a lot more than I got from Netflix to do a special and a lot more. And you have a test every week and you have to be fluent. It's several million dollars. Why? Why Italian? Why? Well, I speak Spanish and um, you know, I had an interest in learning French and what I, what I discovered was Italian is so much easier for me because it gets close to Spanish. Like all the pronunciations are pretty similar. Yeah. Um, and so far like I'm flying through it, whereas when I did the French, when I was like, fuck, I kept like, I just kept hitting walls and like, so I'm doing it because I want to do something to stimulate that part of my brain, but I don't want to too big of a challenge.

Speaker 3:          00:45:30       So, and with Italian, the one thing that sucks, I feel like there's more utility in French. There's definitely more places you can use it. And definitely more pussy, more and more posts. Number one, Paul De. Yeah. I mean I have like, what are we going to do another couple of years, so I know I'm going to have some fun soon. Um, but yeah, I'm still, I'm doing the Italian just because the very least the AU pair. Yeah. You know, if you, if you don't have enough frequent flyer miles to go to Paris, just get a free childcare. Do you work on your fuck with other languages? Do you ever like, uh, we taped when I was doing dinner and a movie, we tape 10 days in Italy and so I did like a crash course and so I learned, you know, just a spoon. The Bolt Tailgate, they act mineraly parrot, fab order.

Speaker 3:          00:46:14       There you go. Pull native apps, things like that. Like five, like five sentences. But people soap, appreciate it when an American takes the time to learn their language because most Americans just come in there with a sense of entitlement and are just dicks. And so it's like, oh, okay. They recognize that we are fucking country. Yeah, just learn like people learn a couple of basics I think anywhere you go it's like, just learn how to say like, excuse me, thank you, please. For even for like a basic trip. It's like, it goes a long way. Or like I'll never forget being in Paris and I'm having lunch and a nice restaurant with some other students. We were, we were actually in Madrid, but we went over to Paris for a couple days and we're sitting in this restaurant and the server comes up and one of the girls who's American turns them, she goes English, right. And I was like, you. And then everybody at the table was like head down and the guy was like, yes I do. I just speak English. But he even saw from our looks how embarrassed we were. I was like, why don't you just say I can't you learn to say, excuse me. Do you speak English? Or like I don't, I don't speak French, but no, she had to go English. Right. Um, he was like, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       And also like I've dealt with your type. Oh yes. Yeah. When I go to Hungary, I'm not very good Hungarian unless I'm there for like a month and then all kind of maybe pick up a little whatever. Uh, but own thing. Yes. But, um, they're so rude over there. That Hungarian, Oh my God. That's why I barely try because like I remember last time I went there like in [inaudible] 99 or something or on a 2004 or whatever. I was like trying to order and he kept correcting my pronunciation and grammar, but like in a cock sucker where I, um, I should find via, I, I should find these Ganache I guy. So he would try to wow. And I was like, Bro, I'm trying like, you know what I'm fucking saying liquor. Like, you know, you're so upset about it. I'm so upset. Did you call Him Dracula?

Speaker 2:          00:48:21       I wasn't. Not Romanian maybe. Oh, okay. Yeah, but neighbor, same thing. Same Shit. Different toilet. The cousins, um, got a store email here when men poop. Do they holder Harry Dick and balls in their hand push. They're soggy dig down into the toilet and Cayston pee comes out. What of the Dick is so long and touches the water? I learned this from my husband. He goes all in. Love you mommy. Tina. Thank you Jean for choosing my husband and the audience. Friday to say his body was dog shit. Oh, this must have been at your show. I remember him. I remember them. Delightful couple. Very enthusiastic. If we hold our dick and balls in our hands when we shit, no, we push it down obviously in this, push it down. Push it down in between your legs. Here's the seat rim. You Push it against their pee down.

Speaker 2:          00:49:11       Yeah. I never knew that. Otherwise you get pee on the toilet seat. You think it would hang out the outside of the toilet or just maybe just dangled wherever it wanted. I didn't fight him, but think it either has to be in the bowl or outside the bowl. Okay, but here's my thing. If you push it in the bowl, what if it rubs against the inner rim and touch his Poo and pee? No. No. There's no poo up there in the front. It took. It's fun. Our toilet there is in the front. Someone takes explosive dumps in that twilight, but it does do touch the porcelain. It's kind of gross when you're in public. That's what I was going to restaurants. I'll lay a tissue down just for my own peace of mind because you're touching the porcelain. Yeah, but I mean, yeah, it's just how it is.

Speaker 2:          00:49:52       It's gross. But then your painter gets other people's pee and stuff on it. Probably Mike doesn't hang low enough. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. I've, I liked that. She was like, what if it touches the water? It's like, do you know what kind of hang you're talking about right now? That water, it's not like, right. They asked for it. I would gladly be able to have that problem. You know, male comics are always joking about when they get older, their ball sack and they can touch the water. Does that happen? I've looked some guys. Yeah. And you sit on enough toilets where there's also weird, um, mechanisms for toilet. Sometimes you'll sit on a toilet, you hit flush and it has like water comes up and then goes down. So you'll, you'll jump cause the water will raise it up to your balls. But like for the most part your balls are, unless you're a ball hog, in which case, you know, uh, then, then you get your, your balls.

Speaker 2:          00:50:43       Let me put it right up against her. I get so aggressive, I think about 15 years ago because it didn't used to be that way. And I don't want to sound like an old person, but, uh, no. I remember porn when somebody wasn't getting punched. We've had the discussion that when we are introduced to it, we're basically too young, your kid. But we were watching pretty much eighties porn where the thrill was just that you're having sex with some, like that was, yeah, that was, we were seeing a vagina and then in the scene they were like, this is so great that I get to have sex with you. Like that was, yeah, that was the interaction that I'm so glad I missed delivered a pizza. Yeah. And then, you know, it was big hair

Speaker 3:          00:51:28       and it was just naked people doing it. Yeah. And then it,

Speaker 2:          00:51:32       I think it's because, I don't know, there was maybe the, as the exposure of it grew, people became more desensitized. I think so then it heightened. Yeah. Well the, I don't know. But then again, okay, what are the most popular searches for porn? It's MILF porn is one of like top category. It's not the, um, that's true ball licking the fist, double fist. Anal. Fucking, it's not, it's not the most popular for sure. And everyone is kind of in the middle of what their tastes are. I think it's just marketing and like, Whoa, I'm going to, it's like Click Bait, right? Five Dick's and one bought whole Wagga to see how that works out. That's going to break bad. How's this going to break open? Right, right. Cause I don't know, I'm trying to

Speaker 3:          00:52:17       pull up the, uh, it says that there's the most popular. Yeah. What are the big searches right now? Pop most popular porn, Sir

Speaker 2:          00:52:26       Gay. I read the, I heard some podcasts where straight guys are searching for gay stuff. Meaning there's a lot more gay men out there then are, are copping to basically they're saying they're gay. I'm sure MILF has big

Speaker 3:          00:52:40       looks like a Hentai. That's the uh, yeah. Uh, cock cock holding was big. Lesbian. Wow. That whole crazy term. Uh, gay, big. These are the biggest search is a 2017 accord. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:52:57       Oh, crazy things chain. It sounds pretty basic though. Dick big deck that lesbians, it's like same shit. Different toilet ma'am.

Speaker 3:          00:53:06       Yeah. Um, and the most viewed categories for women. Uh, like in the u s the biggest term for a search term for women was lesbian as same as South America. In Africa, you'll never believe it. The biggest search term was ebony. Um, Russia. It's anal.

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       Wow. Um, yeah. And it looks like, yeah, those are kind of it. And then mature and teen teen is a popular term as well. Oh yeah, I've heard that's a big one. Yeah, it's the bed. They seem, you're right. It's not like airtight six Dick's or it's not like that. That's the curiosity click, I think. I mean, what about Trans Trans Sexual? I thought that was very popular. It wasn't the top 10 list, but I'm sure it's a very popular term. A lot of that chicks with dicks. Yup. Um, what is, uh, let's see here. Why do infinity wipers happen? Oh, exactly what you're talking about. Like a bath of 90% of the time, I'm a solid one to Weber. Occasionally get stuck wiping for at least 10 minutes. Really destroys a good roll of toilet paper. And your help is it keep it nonbinary Zack, if I may, because I'm kind of like the queen of Infinity Wipes.

Speaker 2:          00:54:20       This is why I invented shit. The shower for me, the only way to stop the wiping is to take a shower and I don't know why, why that is, but the minute you take soap and water to your Heinie, you're going to stop the wipes. Oh Wow. You have that ever infinity? I christened the house I live in now. It was empty. I had just taken ownership of it and I had to take a shit. So I go in there, I take my first shit in the house and it's one of those shifts where you're like, ah, there's not enough toilet paper in the world. So I get in the shower and there's not even a shower curtain and there's like no soap like day one it was, and I just remember thinking really this is my first memory, this is, this is how I Chris and this is the worst bottle of champagne to crack against a shed test.

Speaker 2:          00:55:12       That first shit in the house you wrecked your remember you really do. I think shaving your asshole and wiping from front to back has been the biggest key for me. Oh. Which minimizes the multiple wives. My Dad has multiple series on it. It's wiped direction, white portion diet that sometimes he goes, you've got to let things settle. So what he, cause I've asked him, he goes, we need to do buddy is you stand up kind of thing. We'll realign inside of you. Because sometimes it's just the way that you're sitting in the way your insides because he goes stand up, kind of let things go back together. And then sit back down. I've tried it actually has worked before. Like he, I mean he says it like really like a researcher would say but he, yeah he insists on it and I've, I've, I've, I've thought about it. I think it does make sense. The next time you have an infinity wiper, just try standing up for a second. You know I'm going to have everything go back to calibrate. Yeah. Yeah. But it's too late at that point. I mean it's like after you get in a car accident, drive better. Yeah, I know. I know. Because here's the thing, if there was already brown all over you, you're already in. It's already messy. It's not all over you. You're just having a, a whole, it's like leaking basically. So

Speaker 3:          00:56:25       Diet I think is the biggest thing is one of life's really most sublime pleasures is the shit where you wipe and you go, I didn't even need toilet. So true. Go Shit. It's the best. That is the best thing. You double checked it. There's something in the bowl you're like, yeah it did. I miss, is there a piece stuck to my leg? Cause this is too good to be true. [inaudible] shit coming. Um, we've been talking about, my dad says things incorrect, like mispronounces so many words. Um, so we're getting a lot of emails about it along the lines of our parents saying things wrong. When I was a child, we had a cat for the longest time. I thought that his name was Charlie. It wasn't until I was laying in bed one night when I was 23, but I realized the cat's name was Charlie and that his name was being said with an extremely thick Boston accent.

Speaker 3:          00:57:19       Grateful to Albert. We're washing it. I looked some scrum. You run like a lady Mike from Albany. I don't know what that part means. Scrum. Do you say that on the, on the spectral? No, no. He says you run like a lady. I don't know. Um, but yeah, well my dad is proceed. Like that's an accent that you're hearing. My Dad had a foggy brain old guy, but he's been doing it for like, like we were talking about when he was here for the holidays. Uh, like, I dunno, Casino was on and my dad was like, that's a Joe Pesci. Right? And we're like, yeah, but haven't you heard his name like 10,000 times? Like why would you call them Pesky? And he says like all types of words, like a few degrees. Yes. My Dad, my dad used to do that to a who would like a Heineken's.

Speaker 3:          00:58:02       Yeah, that's a paralyzing. That's the Goto. At one time my dad, uh, said, um, uh, I was listening to a Simon and Garfunkel. No. And I went, no, Dad, it's, it's Garfunkel. He goes, Oh yeah, Garfinkel, that's the cat, Garfield, Garfield, native English speaker. What? We were discussing all our theories on it. Like, could it be brain damage? I think it's for like my dad, it is actually a lack of paying attention. In other words, it's kind of like being half into the conversation we were watching. He goes, you know, you don't hear a lot about in the news these days, is that Gerald Koocher? And I go, Jared. And he's like, and he goes, yeah, yeah, yeah. So in other words it's like, you know what I'm saying? I'm like, but dude, you've heard his name and you've read it in newspapers like a million times. So your dad's half listening. I think he's looking at some more clips. He might be looking at porn, he might be watching ball hogs instead of actually talking to me, but everything he says is kind of like, you know what I'm trying to say? So I'm like, I think you're just kind of half checked out of everything. Yeah. So then you have saying things wrong. You know what? I think that starts to happen and I don't want to scare you guys. Children, children, deprivation. I know. Absolutely. My best friend, once

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       he had four kids, like there was a part of his brain that never came. Absolutely. Especially as the mom. Yeah. There's a thing called mom brain and it starts for me, it started in the third trimester, my last pregnancy and in for the first year you remember that. I would just forget because you're so sleep deprived and you also so much, your brain is mush. Part of it is aging, but I think that having the kid exacerbates this is your separation from pop culture [inaudible] you're so into this, you know, taking care of this being and all your home life that things kind of pass you by. It happens more when you have a kid I think where you're like somebody will bring up, you're like, who's that? And be like, who's the number one artist in the country right now? And you're like, I don't know who that is now.

Speaker 2:          01:00:04       Just kind of passes you by. Last night I was saying to Tommy, I'm like, I'm, I'm 41 years old. I think I'm finally the official age where I don't know shit about pop culture. Like I, I know about Cardi B and I'm like fascinated by her and that's it. Right, right. It's a singer. She's a says. I honestly, I've never heard of. He's a rapper, he's a rapper and she's got like a couple of big hits. Huge. She's, she's very successful right now. And um, that's all I know. Maybe the voice, I know Blake Shelton was on there, but I'm officially that that turning point where your, your lane? Well we made a, I mean it wasn't on purpose but such a shift I feel like within the last four years or so where things on television, if it's on TV it doesn't mean anything. First of all, like my wind down of like I want to watch something involves Netflix, iTunes, like what's the, you know, renting things or watching a movie.

Speaker 2:          01:00:59       Um, maybe Amazon prime and like if there's a show like that on NBC Fox, I'm like there's 0% chance and less like a friends on it and they're like, I'm on this show. Even then it's like I don't watch it but that's good for you. I know the name of the show, but I mean, yeah, so like those things just go past me now. That's, that's the only thing I watch broadcast TV. Exactly. What's your sport? What do you like? Hockey? Yeah, but you're in northeastern guy or in Chicago. Chicago guy want it. Makes Sense. Yeah. It's a great sports town. It is also a bears fan and a bulls. I was until, you know, after they won in [inaudible] 85, 86, uh, and they just took the team apart from money. I was like, why am I frustrating the fuck out of myself getting behind a team with more care about winning than the fucking owners. They're the only professional sports team where it is the sole business of the owners. So I understand that they treat it more of a business then as a hobby like Jerry Jones where it's all about his ego and winning. But the bears could use some more of that. Yeah. I mean I feel like your fandom, if you have like ownership issues, like I was born in Cincinnati and we left when I was a kid, but we left the year they went to the Superbowl and 88 with boomer. Yeah. And like

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       I was a Yankee shuffle. Yeah. And I was such a die hard. Yeah. I was such a die hard fan. Um, but then what I discovered is like after time kind of living in that with the reality that they're like probably one of the worst ownership groups or teams in the NFL. It, it makes your fandom like die. It's hard man. It really tests there or they're a perennial dog. Yeah. Yeah. And you realize too that you're like, that's so it's, it's a real thing that a team can suck for

Speaker 6:          01:02:51       decades, decades. The saints in the 70s, I don't think they ever had a season where they won more than five games. It was, they never made the playoffs. I know they were dog shit. Awful. Awful. And it, and, and, and uh, what's his name? Uh, Archie manning was a fucking great

Speaker 3:          01:03:07       quarterback. Yeah, there's bad. And then, then you can, and then the flip side you see like, like let's say like the Steelers ownership. You're like, that's like a family that they love the team, the city, they want to win the, do things the right way. And it's like, and they have six fucking rings. Do you think it's, they know when to give up control and not micromanage? I think so. I think, I do think, I mean it sounds kind of Cliche, sports be speak, but it's like they develop a system and like, oh, here's the, it's like a culture, like in a company, here's the way we do things here. And when you get people to really buy into like, this is how we work here and, and you have integrity and you have good values for like how they probably treat employees all the way on down. I think that, that, that becomes something that people really buy into. I mean, for all the shit people talk about the Patriots and all that, it's like, you know, I think they have a real culture going in that organization. Absolutely.

Speaker 6:          01:03:59       Black Hawks are probably one of the greatest examples of that. The, uh, uh, Bill Wirtz was the owner for years and he was despised by the fans because he pinched pennies. He, he was a dick. He treated Bobby Hall and all those other stand Makita treated those guys like shit. Money was the only thing that mattered to him. And when he died, his son, rocky Wirtz took over and, and uh, attendance was in a 30,000 or whatever, a seat stadium. Um, there was maybe 12,000 people. Rocky Wirtz took over. He started bringing back the hall of Famers, honoring them. He got good gms, they started drafting wisely. They got cane, they got Taiz and it is one of the most profitable sports franchises ever. And when change their philosophy, then change your philosophy. And when they won a Stanley Cup, all the employees got ring. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:04:56       That's cool. It's nice. Yeah. One of the things that people, I mean people will say like, we'll say they know it, but they don't act on it is if you're a fan of anything, it doesn't, I mean it could be sports, it could be if you go, I'm not going to support that thing anymore. That's really the only way you'll see change. In other words, right. Like in Cincinnati, they'll still sell that fucking stadium out no matter what they're doing. People will still buy tickets to the game. And so that lets the owners go like, well you don't have to fucking do anything like and money. Yeah. Like roll the dice when you want to hurt them. Like stop going to the Games, stop buying tickets to games and you'll see something will change. Go in the parking lot and set off car bombs or whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:05:35       I encourage the cottages. I um, this is a question we get questions about all types of things, but here's the question about little people. I was in the bathroom cutting my solid brown and half with my powerful urine stream. I had a thought. And you know how when adults refer to their childhood, they start off by saying, when I was little, yeah. Do adult little people refer to their childhood by saying this also, do they say when I was a little smaller, I can't get this off my mind. I need some answers here. That is kind of an interesting question because you do say when I was little and if you're a little person, you might be like, when I was really little, I don't know. I mean it's kind of silly when I was young or when he was younger. Younger. I wonder if they ever, I mean if the leg, yeah, cause all day they're like refer to themselves as little.

Speaker 3:          01:06:18       So, so true. Maybe when it was tiny. Yeah. When I was half to half of you, uh, my girlfriend can't tell the difference between left and right. She has to hold her hands in front of her and make an l with each hand. The correct orientation of the left. Let her knees left. This is my life. I have accepted her handicap and to support her through life. What we want to have a child, well she passed on her retardation or is there still hope for our little jeans? We have a dog and he was real dumb. Not sure yet. If that's her love. Brad, I love this. One of the funniest emails I've ever, ever, ever. So she literally, he goes make a left and she has to go. Which way is yeah. And the dog is dumb and he's not sure if that's her fault. I tell you this much.

Speaker 3:          01:07:03       She's gotta be hot. She's a smoke show for eight Brad, send photos next week because we're pretty sure she's lightening men. My God. What do you think? It could be a, you know, brain thing. Yeah, definitely. I probably is. It's a form of dyslexia or some kind of directional. People have terrible, terrible, I mean, I've never heard left. Right, but I know north south, a lot of people are fucked up by that. I don't know that all the time. I have to do the never eat soggy Wheaties. You know? What I find is that when you live in a certain neighborhood, especially in Los Angeles, you get your orientation, but when you leave that neighborhood and you go to another just neighborhood. Now that for me, I, I lose the sense of all direction. I don't know why, but yeah, like it's like I'm standing in a Hollywood, I'll know north, south, east, west, but if I go to Burbank, I'll start. I'd be like, yeah, it's south of this, and you're like, that's north. I'm like, no, that's not. Yeah, it just throws me off. I don't know why I leave neighborhoods and I, I can't orientate myself. The only way that I, I've always had kind of an obsessive need to know what direction I'm facing. And it was one of the reasons I don't like flying into cities is because then I, I

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       don't have a bearing to start with. Like right now, I know I'm facing northeast. Right. Um, it's just like this, you know, you're facing northeast, right. Didn't know that. I, I wouldn't that, hold on, Huh? Yeah. You are. You are fighting facing northeast. It's just this weird, I think it was a fear of being lost maybe when I was a little person mean. Did you know that? Just like, you just know how you count. It's just, uh, it's just as a sense of, of, uh, I dunno, I dunno how to explain it. I don't, I don't have to think about it cause I'm always thinking of things as a grid kind of when I get into curvy shit, then I, I lose, like when you get into subdivisions where it's all curves. Yeah. Hmm. Um, super orgasm, asthma. Do you know what that is? Uh, our blue, our producer just through this ignore folder. I have no idea what that is. I don't know

Speaker 6:          01:09:08       the most that I've had. I think trevally be upwards of 60 throughout an evening. It's great. Especially the ones that keep on going forever. And then there comes a time after a long time that I just say no, we have got stopped because uh, I mean you can't go up and a hallway.

Speaker 2:          01:09:27       I feel like Europeans have so much more fun than us. I feel like that though. No one American will be in this uh, video clip super orgasm. Actually last year I was really confused and to me it felt like a contraction but nice. Hmm. Do you want to go to this seminar? I was like during like a little group circle. I don't, I'm not a fan of group orgasm therapies or, yeah, no, it's a super orgasm though, right? I know. I don't, I don't, I think one is fine. Like I'm not, I'm not chasing the dragon here, you know what I mean? See, in an evening I think one is sufficient. I would bet the next day they're depressed because you're too high bleeding all of that. That's like when you take ecstasy, uh, you're depressed the next day, Paul, that you're withdrawing all that dopamine or whatever the, yeah, I'm not, I'm not an extreme type of person. I think I'm happy with what, like anatomy, you know? Yeah. Provides 52 year old mother of two. Beverly is super orgasmic, I believe. So

Speaker 6:          01:10:37       practicing tantric sex is what leads to super orgasm and a priestess of love and sacred sexuality. Do you think it's very natural for me if I'm making love with a partner to have many, many orgasms where my whole body is flowing with sexual energy.

Speaker 2:          01:10:52       Do you think she's as full of shit as the guys who got the comm? Hugs? Yeah. Bugs and that they're there. That is like a boat. K of cliches that I search for you. The word sacred. Um, the, the uh, you know, the India, the music, Sitar or whatever, the dancing.

Speaker 3:          01:11:15       It's all Robin. You know the word mother earth is just around the corner? Yeah. Do you know Julie and there? I don't think we need what come hugging is. No, that's so come hugging. There's a, I'm trying to pull this up for you. There is a, um, boy, there's these two people who say that, uh, you can come just by hugging and come

Speaker 5:          01:11:43       seminar.

Speaker 3:          01:11:51       It's, it feels like some bullshit though. It really does. Yeah. Rarely done. Have you ever spood so hard that you hit your own face? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I hung one on my glasses one time in college. I had to laugh. I was like, it made me laugh because it made me laugh. Just, yeah. Drench yourself. Um, I can't even imagine that you guys clean up at clean. It's got to be terrible for men. It's pretty bad. Yeah. And especially because you're, if you, that adolescent phase where it's like nonstop and Ugh, it's just gotta be disgusting for your mother is cleaning up your [inaudible]. I was always, yeah. What's the, what's the most inappropriate or gross thing you've ever cleaned your ges with? Oh, man, that's a good question. Yeah, I get it. That's a really good question. I mean, it was definitely in that, in those terms.

Speaker 3:          01:12:46       I think of like this is an emergency. Yes. It was probably something that's not mine, you know? So like it's probably like somebody like a parent's clothing. I go, you go like you think you're alone. Then like you hear the door open like Oh fuck. And I dunno where I'm at. And then I just clean up. I think. I can't think of like a specific though. What about you? Hands down. It was sex with a girl and a car. She was a single mom and, and she presented it to me to clean myself off with a baby sock. I go, really? She goes, that's the only thing I have. I have not even a lot of surface area. And I was like, this is going to be lasered into my brain for the rest of my life. These are the come huggers by the way. I was trying to show you.

Speaker 5:          01:13:34       Hi Melanie. I'm Scotty with ecstatic hearts. Tantra. I was just want to share that there are many ways to orgasm. You don't actually have to be having sex. You can orgasm just from hugging.

Speaker 3:          01:13:50       So there,

Speaker 1:          01:13:53       ah,

Speaker 3:          01:13:55       it's, it's, it's amazing how many people in the world exist that make us uncomfortable. Yeah. Try it out. Yeah. They're, they're, they're so uncomfortable because I, yeah, I've seen that clip now like 40 times and I'm still like, man, well cause I struggle in my head

Speaker 6:          01:14:12       I'm like, oh, I'm uncomfortable. But as it, because I'm like a prude, am I being close minded here am I,

Speaker 3:          01:14:19       I think we both kind of like, when people are like that I get uncomfortable with there. It's almost like their level of sharing. Like I could make like come on, I'm like, just fucking don't need to know about it. You know? I'm not a prude, but I'm just like, I don't have any, no, I don't want to know. I don't need to know how much you can come.

Speaker 6:          01:14:40       Yeah. I'm all for freedom. Freedom and no shame. But it's, it's, it's less the concept of it then. It is the presentation of it. The presentation of it is always kind of precious and new agey and just, I don't know, there's, there's almost kind of a smug theater crowd. The theater crowds laugh at something that's not funny at all. We know. We understand that the Butler would never do that.

Speaker 3:          01:15:08       Right? Yeah. It got a little of that. Yeah. Um, like I would never see Hamilton. I think I'm so, I'm the lamest in terms of that. You wouldn't see it. I heard of so good. I just hate theater. I don't know. I feel like it's too, it's too corny for me. I'd be like, I don't like opera. I hate musicals. I hate, I hate music eight. Yes. Even like, what was that was such les Miserables movie. Sit through it. Get your ally. I turned off la La land when they started singing in the first scene. I fast forwarded through the songs. I just like Ryan Gosling and what's her shit? Yeah. I don't want to fucking hear. I started on a plane. I was like, Oh, this movie is like winning everything. And then I clicked that first scene, the camera settles. She was like, wait her.

Speaker 3:          01:15:54       And I was like, Nope, I'm not doing it. I'm not going to watch this. Don't want to see it. I've been doing this since I was a kid, like with Disney movies and shit. I used to listen to records and I would skip over the songs. I like the store, so 69 at 70, so submissions to wrap things up. So we've been doing this thing where when I, uh, just to give you context for it, my dad turned 70, uh, back in August we had a big family get together and my mom, who's Peruvian, it doesn't get a lot of references. Uh, one of the dinners on the first night of the, of the get together, I said, Hey, dad is turning 70 tomorrow. Do you think you guys are going to 69 tonight? So afraid it like a child. And she was like, what?

Speaker 3:          01:16:34       And everybody laughed. And then we kept teasing her about it all weekend. Yeah. So we told our listeners about it and we asked them to ask their parents if they're going to 69 at 70 and get it on camera and they'd been selling all. He goes, yeah, you get a wide range of reactions. Sometimes the parent is a playful, sometimes they're stunned, sometimes they get really upset, which is my favorite. Um, but so I don't know what these, these are our new ones that came in. Oh my God. Do I love that? Was the moms that are up to, yeah, the moms. Would you ask me something like that? Sharon? Like really, really upset my fate. I mean, those are good. I like when they're like,

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       you guys are, this is so juvenile. I like the, I like those two, nine times out of 10. The Dad's on board. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:17:15       Dad. That's always what sounds good to me. But yeah, mom's like uptight. I know. Dad's 62 wait, hold on. Let's put bets on it. What do you think her reaction to haul the last night that he's 60 you guys going to 69 one last time. Oh my God. Have you ever or are you going to 69 one last time? Like the last time. He's 69 well, he's hammer hammer. It's hilarious. First question is, have you ever play Joe here right now? Sorry.

Speaker 2:          01:17:56       I love it. That was great. That's from Mr Sr. I couldn't find the pause cause I was gonna say we should take a look at the mom's next time and then bet on how you think she's going to read it. I thought she was going to react angrily. I did too. That glare was like the fuck are you asking me? Yeah. But then she did kind of smile. Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's had a few enter. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. The Alcohol House since uh, no humor. I'm going to go no humor on this lady. Yeah, I could go with you on that. I think it might not work out. Yeah, I think she's, I think that he spends most of the marriage sitting there with that look on his face. Yes. And her reaction with that look on her face. And so that reaction is going to be probably remind her that he doesn't fuck her anymore. This is a, okay, this is from crystal. So here we go.

Speaker 5:          01:18:42       Michelle is going to be 50 yeah, that was kind of, that's a milestone.

Um, cause you explore every facet of human existence and like there's no other person doing it. There's no, there's nowhere else where people are being interviewed about being bipolar or being a Hasidic Jew and being molested as a child or whatever the scenario and what I really love on your website, which has mental pod.com he has these surveys up that people take anonymously and so you can see what people are really have had happened to them in their lives. You know, things that you wouldn't want to admit in public and interest and you can read what things that turn them on. Yeah, yeah. Oh, it's just, it's amazing. It's such a great show.
