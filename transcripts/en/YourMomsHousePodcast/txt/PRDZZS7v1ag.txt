Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Well, well, well go to your mom's house, Christina

Speaker 2:          00:00:19       genes. Are you ready to glass? Just wow, son. Ready to go glass in or what? Cool. So loose. It makes me happy every time. I know it's the best every single single day too. It's such a gift that I was testing out this new slack. We have a, you know, new monitor and everything and I was just playing with it and we were running audio and video through it and we just use that clip and I just was laughing. Still a man still. Yeah. Yeah. He gets so excited. Were just glass, glass and just glass. So ridiculous. All right, let's start the show. Um, oh moose. Do you want to start the show with a clip? Oh No. Uh, holiday spirit or do you like Christmas spirit or do you want to do like a silly, silly man? Well, we did a silly man last week. I'm going to do Christmas. And you love the Christmas season. I love the holidays. Yeah, I do too. Uh, I love the Christmas. Uh, and I don't want anybody with diamonds on the crevice of their person. No, no, no, no. So let's just go. So gross. And I hate that you keep singing it around the house. I know. I know. My asshole pucker every time. All right, let's do it. Let's start the show and it's clan. That was good. Let's get in the holiday. Christmas spirit. Here we go. Let's glass.

Speaker 3:          00:01:59       Sure. Close enough.

Speaker 2:          00:02:06       Ah,

Speaker 1:          00:02:11       don't bring in one month into this. Well, we'll go to your mom's house. Mom said Christina. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:03:00       Yeah, if I'm,

Speaker 5:          00:03:03       if that sounded weird to you. It's should it did. Because we have a replacement computer right now. He goes, my logic board was fucked. Thank you for everybody that messaged me when I asked all those questions last week, my Mac book shot. So that was so weird. Yeah. So I have a, I don't have like my normal drops. I don't have my normal stuff yet. So I did, I realized I didn't have the intro. So I had blue band record, basically a version that's played somewhere, but he doesn't have the actual file. Real deal. Yeah. So that's what we don't have all of our drops. No, but I have some. But you know what that's gonna mean is that we have to invent new ones. Oh yeah. Not only that, but I do have, I do, it actually got me into something I'm really excited to do glass for, of I'm in a glass all fucking day.

Speaker 5:          00:03:46       But the other thing I'm going to do is, um, I went into the archives and you know, people don't realize, I think we get 500 plus legit emails a week. Yeah. Wait, I'm saying not, you know, people listening and writing in and you can only spend so much time, you know, looking over your job. Basically we had to hire someone to do it and then the blue van has another gig too, so he can only kind of get, get through so much and prep all this stuff for the show. So the other day when I, when I sent in that computer to get fixed, I'm using this one, I went into the archives and I realize there's songs we've missed. Yeah. And then other times, this thing, we've talked about that before too, which is songs that have played, but only once. And you're such a good fucking song.

Speaker 5:          00:04:39       They're so amazing. Yeah. And they just come and go. And we were so lucky that people send us amazing shit. Yeah. We only use, can I ask you before I forget? Yeah. What are, are these dicks? Yeah, there's decks on her tits, so I can't leave looking at it. So for our listeners that, um, that don't watch the show, we put, you know, we try to put this up on, on youtube every week. Right now, the clip of the jingle bells lady, she's um, she has, uh, I guess like pink biker shorts, but they're pulled up over her pretty sizable midsection. Um, Gut, right? I mean it's a pretty, it's a who is she right there? Yeah. And then she has a hat on and um, she, um, I dunno, uh, a blue band said he, he doesn't think she's, well, 100%, but I don't know. But then she cut out a paper, drawings of Dicks and there are they, what's the, what's used on her tits to keep them there? It's like shaving cream. So she rubbed shaving cream on her tits and then she put paper Dicks on them and then she sang Chicco Belson. Well, Django Bell, it doesn't, well she said jingle bells. I think she's, I think she's Spanish. Yeah, she's, she's doing the best she can. Yeah. Let's see here. Let's see. Let's just got the spirit and she's touched. Oh,

Speaker 3:          00:05:59       that's a very Spanish, you know what's neat too is when

Speaker 2:          00:06:25       do you want, I really want to know which is this Christmas say no to Dick. I think that's what she said.

Speaker 3:          00:06:34       Love is when people do it in the bathroom.

Speaker 2:          00:06:39       That's what she said. It's nice when people do art in the bathroom by the toilet because the acoustics as you can here are fantastic. The toilet and then it sounds good, you know, because of all the tile and I don't think she's that deliberate. Yeah. But what do you think inspired her to do this and why they, I mean I understand jingle bells because she's obviously into the holiday, but why this Christmas say no to Dick and Oh my God, my thing just went to sleep again. Why that you think? Well, she's got a dick problem. Oh yeah, yeah. He's got a problem with Dick. So you gotta say no today. What is the problem she has? You think she, well she finds dicks on the Internet. That's when I'm guessing. Yeah. And, and they're probably not good dicks. So wouldn't the solution be just go find better dicks?

Speaker 2:          00:07:29       You'd think that? Yeah, but she'd rather write a song about it and put it on the Internet. It's so amazing to me that people still do this shit. They don't even think about their families or jobs. It's kind of on genes. What do you mean what's going on? Help me out man. Keep talking. Um, I didn't realize I have an interesting story. I need your help with Tom. I'm going to need you to pay attention to me eventually, but I can set it up. Cause I've told you the premise already. I went to Washington. Dick come. Yeah. And how was that so much fun? It's really fine. Great clubs. And be honest, I had such a hard time getting through my sets because the audience unanimously, they were all shouting your, the water champion. You're the water champion about me? No, no, no. Christina, your the water and it was like distracted a bunch of losers went to your show.

Speaker 2:          00:08:19       No, no, they're all winners. They're all mommies. Um, but I want to go over something that happened to me. So I took a lot of sloppy dumps while I was on the road because we don't have the, the washlet there said this before sex the other night. You're telling me about this, about this lobby dump. It really was gummy like, so I was like, this is a sexy story. Well that's why I wanted to bring it up on the show because we talked about this last night before we did it. They were really turned on. So I thought maybe turn on the audience. So I, during the day I was hanging out just glass and in my room and I had a fart that it was a hot fart, but it didn't feel like anything came out. But then I went to go pee later and I just like, I went to kind of wipe it up down there and there was brown on the toilet paper. So was that a shark?

Speaker 2:          00:09:20       No, I need help. Was that a shark or was it just a little bit of leaky? But you know what I'm saying? You went to a p right and you wiped your badge. Why wipe down? You got to wipe down, you wipe front to back. And I do a thorough, like always fun. Top down. You always want to push the year end towards the Brown. You never want to do the opposite. Right. He did that and there was brown, but I was like, I kind of grazed my be whole now. I always do just to make sure nothing's going down there. And there was brown on the toilet paper. So that makes me think Tom was that, was that a sharp? Um, I think you're the expert. It's quite obvious that you absolutely sharded. Do you remember the Fart that yes. Did you have to have how soon before that p Wipe did you fart?

Speaker 2:          00:10:11       Well, that's, I was in bed and I was reading and it was like a hot fart. Yeah, it does. I'm saying I didn't feel brown coming down. I just felt like, oh, that was a hot one. And then I went to go potty like 20 minutes later and there was a brown on the paper. Wow. But that other that, but then I ha, here's the other part that's telling me the other part and this is where I need help. Yeah. Because I took a really hot, messy brown that morning because I had a hotel room, coffee and I, it was messy and sloppy and I had to go shit to shower on that one. So my question to you is, do you think that that was the neverending wipe, like a residual from my hot brown earlier? Probably was. You didn't mention that when you brought up, did I shark?

Speaker 2:          00:10:51       Because if you just give me the information, I farted and then I wiped when I peed and there was brown there. You're shorted. But now you're telling me there's a big brown messy wipe earlier bus with messy brown. Then it probably, because I have those sometimes where you're like, Ooh, and then you go later on there's all this brown there. But here's the thing is that I showered after and usually after I shower thing you left out. So now the first of all, I'm really sexually aroused, really turned the plot, thickens the brown thing and well that's what I'm saying. I don't know. What is it? Was it a true shark? Was it a post? Uh, you know, leaky but situation, I don't know. Yeah, it's, it's really interesting. Well, it kind of sharp. Tell me about sharks in your past. Maybe I can compare a shark to just like I farted after a bad doubt basically in the, maybe it pushed some more brownout oh, sure it did. I mean, you know, a handful of times. I'm trying to think of the most recent one. Um, but what's it like in your underwear? Usually? Usually a shark doesn't necessarily have to get that far because like

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       your body alarms you so quickly. It's like a, but clinch thing takes place. You know, you feel the brown coming down. I mean you, you feel like, whoops, that's more than a fart. And it's like still in between your butt cheeks. I've had one, remember we got that, I'm down in the South Bay that uh, it was like some green [inaudible] we're making those blender drinks. Smoothies. Yeah. But it was like, uh, all it was called like ultra green or something green all day powder.

Speaker 6:          00:12:24       Yeah, Dude. That thing. I remember that chart that was standing in the kitchen and I was like, oh, here's a cool fart that was liquid though. Everything came up, felt it come out, which it completely soaked the back of the boxers. Yeah. Yeah. But that was not, I mean, not your standard. I mean it's in the Shard scale for sure. But it wasn't your standard one. That sounds to me. Is that a shard or was that a shit? No. Well that was what it was a short, I mean I went to Fart, right. And some shit liquid came out and that's kind of, that's my point. I went to Fart and some, a little brown came down and the Brown came out. Yeah. So that must be the Mai, I'm, I'm leaning towards a shark because we were so much time in between my shower and then that far that happened. And then also that, that's my second sharp because the first one happened over when we were flying to Africa. Remember when I showed up? It's only the second of your life. My life one have my life now. Pros, childbirth. That whole isn't, is taught is it used to be. And I fart constantly. I can't hold on a farm. You mentioned that. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:13:29       And I've also noticed that and observed it and witnessed.

Speaker 6:          00:13:32       Sorry, I farted a lot in public on this trip. Like when I was on the airplane. I just farted the entire time. Yeah, but don't you fart on airplanes? A art? Don't you fart? Like Cree Fart, right? Pound farts. Yeah, of course. Well, cause nobody can hear it. Oh of course. Yes. A R t. Now I have another addendum to this topic. I farted on the plane. Have you ever had a fart? And I think your dad just brought this up recently that didn't even smell like your own. So you kind of question like, is that my Farnam smelling or somebody

Speaker 5:          00:14:06       houses? Yeah. Yeah, we did talk about that. My Dad was saying that he's discovered a new farts. No. Right. What I had was that I flew a few weeks ago, it was when I flew to Philly and somebody was ripping big farts. Yeah. And continuous where I was like, fuck, it was the same smell. And you're like, God dammit. And then about three and a half hours into the flight, I farted and my fart smelled like that. Right.

Speaker 6:          00:14:32       That's so cool. That was weird. No. Do you think it, did you guys eat at the same place in the airport? Maybe. I don't know man. I mean, I guess it's possible. Anything's possible. It's magic. I Dunno. Fart Moses. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:14:45       Speaking of, by the way, that's Elizabeth May and you remember that? Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       we have a r t a few weeks ago we played her, um, let's see. I'm sorry, that was me bits. What happened? I moved and she got startled and bark. Oh yeah. She gets it very scared. So a few weeks ago we played her, she's The lady who in parliament was like, you shouldn't say fart. Remember? Um, excuse me. But I don't think she's very courtly to say parliamentary.

Speaker 7:          00:15:18       Well the government talking about skilled labor. Yeah. Michelle, why is it the infrastructure minister talking about how to implement infrastructure yeah. To work in Alberta. Yeah. Why does this government treat Alberta like a fart in the room? Nobody wants to talk about or acknowledge. Oh, I thought I made that happen because we both did that. That guys was trying to hold back the laugh part and the wind honorable member for a Senate. Chuck, I'll filings your rough, my friend and her speech. But I heard her to say a word that I know is distinctly on parliamentary. I think she may want to withdraw. Bird was f a r t tattletale

Speaker 2:          00:15:59       per title tail. Right. No Fun. No one likes you and nobody likes you. Elizabeth at the, um, I forget what it's called, but it's like the equivalent in Canada of the correspondents' dinner, right? Like the Canadian, yeah. Yeah. So we're members of government and journalists are together and it's, you know, it's a little bit looser night, but she, she appeared to be hammered at the scene and was escorted off.

Speaker 7:          00:16:28       So we showed you last week, God is here. I want to mention we stand on his traditional territory too. And I want to say like, what the fuck was wrong with the rest of you? You didn't notice where standing on traditional territory, what doesn't scream out first nations about this stage? No, she's bombing, bombing. And then here later, unusual by you're speechless. Look at her being escorted off. Got More class in my whole fucking cabinet. Thank you. Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:16:59       And uh, that lady, this lady looks mortified. She was playing a song from her cell phone. She was so drunk. So then, um, you know, we made it a big thing. Obviously we played it on this show a lot and then we were sent in her appearance after that. Yeah. So after that she made it to jeans. Uh, all the news shows in Canada. Now we've been talking about this all morning about comments from you by the thousands. As a matter of fact. And we want to hear this lady, she is in Ottawa. May thank you for being our guest. Weirdo. Her teeth. Wait, she's got the perfect smile. It looks like a perfect smile isn't really, but it's, it looks like she, she puts it in like

Speaker 7:          00:17:50       you do. Like it's Kinda halfing dude. Oh well her smile is not perfectly level apologize. I know in interviews with other news organizations this morning, having perhaps seen the video again, a, any comments you would like to make additionally? Well, just to make sure that viewers know that what I was attempting to do was to, as you do at the press gallery dinners, and I know all journalists know it. I don't know how Canadians know it. That'd be annual press gallery dinner is an attempt at humor and often playing against oneself in ways that are self deprecating and doing things you normally wouldn't do.

Speaker 2:          00:18:24       So he, you know, what sucks about that is that it's a, um, she's making an apology. Non-Apology it's, I'm sorry. No, I'm not sorry. I didn't do anything wrong, but I'm here to do this. It's the worst man. You know what? You know what the right answer is. The right answer is I'm, yeah. You know what? I had a few too many bombed. That was terrible. Just why can't you just admitted it was, uh, it was, uh, it was a night of fun times and I went a little too far. I got hammered. Sorry guys. Have you ever had a drink too many or is everyone here above that?

Speaker 7:          00:18:57       Right. Various stick. Sometimes sticks. They fail and mine did not work at all. It's tempting humor and failed. I take full responsibility and I certainly course, yeah, well that's good. She needs a lozenge. She did that there. She said she did take responsibility. She goes, I tried. It wasn't my intention ever do, uh, just the jet to Canadians that I was making a speech. I was trying and obviously failing badly. I delivering something new purse. Had I hindsight, I should've realized that having traveled so much to the previous 48 hours that I was probably too sleep deprived. Pull it off again.

Speaker 2:          00:19:38       Uh, to me, didn't seem tired. Pretty alert. Pretty, pretty groggy. Maybe seem like you might have been down for a for a long fun night ahead of you. Yeah. She needs to get those bottom teeth fixed to match the top, the bottom turn yellow. Really wondering. I mean, yes it was the parliamentary. Rudy's are and he can afford nice teeth. Him and the guy that wrote Downton Abbey, that Guy Julian Fellowes, Julian Fellowes as a horrible bottom row,

Speaker 7:          00:20:17       I allow the stairs as we walk the hell put live in there downstairs. Now you see here that you would never rest your back against the chair and beat them time. It's a melon spoon. Is hourly both scoping as all are? Yes. It's a different animal, but you're still in front of your peers. You're still making public comments. You know, there's still, people have phones, chill, you know, all of that. So, so what happened? I got wasted. Just what? I

Speaker 5:          00:20:47       was so tired. I was so tired. My tits almost fell off when people are go to rehab for exhaustion and our business like, oh really? I actually think that could be real though. Exhaustion. It's called throw gas I think and mental illness. I think if you were to do like the more I've toward when it gets back to back to back nights I could see you going needing like to check out. Yeah, but don't you just stay home for a month? Like that's the thing. Is it at home? You still have shipped pulling at you mental hospital? I don't know. I've never had it but I'm saying I could see how if somebody said we're checking you into a facility to not think about stuff for, I don't think there are a facility that's like the four seasons, but that's what they do is they go check, they check in somewhere for exhaustion.

Speaker 5:          00:21:31       It's a mental health facility, but I'm saying I could see how that happens. I can see I have a too, but it's usually because it's coupled I think with drugs, throw gas and mental illness. I don't think it's just like you're tired. I think it's more, but I think at that level of work load where you're traveling that much like day to day to day and performing and like have, I think you could be drug free mentally ill free and have it happen. I do think it's both. Where are you going? You go to a mental hospital because you're, you're well, yeah, because your mental state isn't well, but you're not mentally ill. You just have worked herself into a state of literal exhaustion. It was code for, I have a drug problem. I need to go and get help. I'm not disagreeing with you. My say my thing now is that I actually think no did I think it's real. I think it's actually legit. Not drug related. Yeah. Yeah. I get exhaustions. There you go. Go check in today.

Speaker 7:          00:22:30       Hold. Having a one night that I could do something edgy and humorous given that I am in parliament, the person knowing over the last four years, my record in parliament, what I've tried to pacify our teeth. I never hackle. I never swear. I'm respectful to everybody. I've got the idea that has a skit material. It would actually be funny if I was different from how I really, nobody cares. That obviously doesn't work right. Really giving the explanation, but she thinks that people know her well enough, like you know what I mean? Like

Speaker 5:          00:22:59       maybe they're, they do Elizabeth. So special. Maybe there are. They do you have a, she ain't shit. She ate her. She ate her Ted's. So they don't know her that well. I guess not.

Speaker 7:          00:23:08       I Ha I have to ask because many of our viewers have commented after seeing the video through this morning. Was alcohol involved? I don't think so, but I think I was very sleep deprived and I'd worked at 21 hours a day. Excuses for myself. I should not. In hindsight, I've thought I was capable of pulling off and edgy because she drank fresca. No, I don't think so as I drank, but I don't think it affected, it affected me, which it did. And they did serve wine with dinner and not denying that. But I think primarily, I mean it was just whatever wine the waiter served at our table. I hadn't been too much for over. I don't think that was a factor, but obviously that's what people are saying on online.

Speaker 2:          00:23:48       And then she's like, I'm going to, I'm going to omit that. I, I, um, I had six. Yeah. And then I had that Xanax before the parties. Xanax. Yeah. And uh, I'll just be like, is it one is the one that everyone else drink? Did I have special one? Was there another glass? Did they give me an extra fucking, I don't think so. I had a bread roll, I think. Um, she gave such a politician's answer like, Jesus Christ just go. Yeah. Yeah. I know. I remember what she did at least owned. She was like, I was trying to be funny and I just hate shit. It wasn't Barack the one of the first people to dairy. Yeah. I remember when Barry was like, yeah, I smoked pot. Yeah. I inhaled, yeah. Next question. No, it's so much better it to somebody just like, I smoked cigarettes, so I love cigarettes.

Speaker 2:          00:24:28       That was kind of story. He was like, that was the hard thing for him to stop doing smoking. Yeah. He stopped smoking. I think he smoked even into the beginning of the presidency. So Rad. And then, you know, they were like, you can't be the president, but he's in great shape. Yeah. I mean physically he's physically fit dude. Yeah. He's in Trudeau shape man. Yeah. What do you think's been better shaped rock or two dads? Trudeau. Yeah, he's younger too. Yeah, he's younger. How old buried? You know, Barry's got to be probably at this point right around 50, I think. Late forties early. Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I think you turned 50 and office, so yeah, he's probably 50, 51 young president. Yeah, I'm a old orange sauce. He's uh, he's 70 so here he looks every year. Yeah. It looks like shit

Speaker 7:          00:25:15       politician, not a comedian. And that went really badly. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:25:19       There you go. Well, she did. She did actually do well. We, um, yeah, we demanded as people you don't represent, we demanded that you apologize that way. I need to tell her what to do with her life. Yeah. I just, you know, you need to get a perfect smile, Elizabeth. We should send her one. Can we find out where did we can send her mail and parliament. Yeah, that's too bad or smells really bad. Really bad. You know what the blood flow of the perfect smile is. They only cover the top. Oh, if it's the perfect smile, it should also be the bottoms. Yeah, that's true. Um, I got it. I had an idea to try this week and one want to know what it is. Yeah. When you hear it means that we're going to do our, um, our

Speaker 8:          00:26:08       plugs then or travel blogs. So that's what, that's the code for you like, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:26:17       So just real quick, we'll do it fast. Um, I don't know if there's any left, but I'm at the Ice House. Uh, actually this is after that. Sorry. It's this already that already came out. New Year's Eve. I'm in Orlando, Florida Horn it up. Five shows. Um, 29, 30, 31 new years eve is a special event. Just a FYI. It's always going to cost more

I'll come, I'll come in for five minutes, be like, all right, let's go back to hotel.

And then we're like in bed, like, you know, we're like sharing a room. He's in one bed and [inaudible] good time. Right? I got it. Yeah. And then he's like, wait, I gotta get dinner somewhere. I don't go to go see some shit or something. We do that and then it's like, let's go back and chill again if we look to do, that's what I like to do. Yeah. I mean, I mean, I guess I kinda like to do it too, but he's like an extreme version. I think the only bummer part about having a kid for me. Yeah, no chill time. And for me, I'm, I'm as lazy as your dad. Actually, my natural state is reclining constantly and I really liked that about him. Yeah. He likes, by the way, you've picked up the habit of I'm done eating. I'm going to go. Oh really? And you get up and you leave. Remember we were eating dinner last week and he, first of all, there's no talking now when you eat, it's like silence. I have to talk to Ellis. Yeah, he doesn't talk back. Yeah, you just, it's silence.

Speaker 2:          00:53:34       What does silence and then you get up and you clear your plate. And I'm like, Tom, we're not done yet. And Alice and I are still sitting here. Then what did I do?

And you could see it from the beginning of why I made sure there was an old school top dog shirt. There was some Theo shirts there. Was You with cane? Yeah. It's so rad. Like to look out.

Speaker 5:          00:56:25       Or

Speaker 6:          00:56:26       not be able to floss. Ooh, forever. Wow. You have to choose between going back to taking Moshi bear dumps. We're going back to being the disgusting animal who doesn't floss.

Speaker 5:          00:56:38       I would take no more flossing. Wow. Yeah. Walk me through the logic. Well, I'm thinking of, first of all, first of all, how much I enjoy the toto washlet three 53 50 e and all of its magnificence and, and just unbelievable technology and I love the clean feeling of a post Brown

Speaker 6:          00:56:58       washlet. I know. It's like impossible to go back. You can't go back in time. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:57:02       Um, there's, there's times where I've wanted to floss whatever, don't floss. You just don't floss and you're like, fuck, this is whatever. But you have gross. It's gross. But you go, I dunno, you, you know, you, you still can rinse your mouth. You brush your teeth, you, you could get a Waterpik, you could do all these things that are kind of,

Speaker 6:          00:57:24       well let's do this. Let's take out the Waterpik. You can't do that because that's a form of flossing.

Speaker 5:          00:57:28       Okay, well I think you could still, you could be really more thorough about you're brushing. You could do more thorough.

Speaker 6:          00:57:36       It's not, it's not the same but your, that's something away. But it's like, do I want to floss and then have that dirty birdie bottle all the time. And I think the answer is no. Well, here's the thing is that I would choose not having the toto washlet three 50. He only, because I just go shit to shower anyways. Like I feel like that's always been my toto washlet sure. But not flossing. Like, you know how it is after you eat a steak and there's just chunks of meat in your, between your teeth. There's nothing grocer. It's disgusting. It's disgusting. And if you can't like brushing doesn't always get those chunks of food out. I know you have to floss. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:58:15       pretty fucking gross to not floss, but it's just the way it is, man. I'm going to, I'm choosing it's a would you rather, I know, I know what were opposed on this? Yeah. You would take no more brown so no more clean browns. No, I would just go straight to the shower like I always did before the toto, that was kind of your, that was kind of, I feel like there was a, would you rather that I really liked there was you sent it to me. Really? Yeah. I'll you want me to find it? Yeah. Okay. Just talk for a while. I'll find it. Okay. What just Todd for awhile. Yeah. Sometimes you guys send really good ones. So I um, uh, let me see, is this the one? That's it. What'd you rather, nope, that's not it. But I know there was a good one. Good one. And you go, oh, this one's great. Let's read it. If you can find it. There it is. Okay. Ready? Go for it. How is that? La La, la La. Oh, okay. Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:59:12       You are stuck in a small queen bed, motel six hotel room for 30 days with either king ass ripper or John Soccer's full on carrying

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       out their famous antics. Okay. Pause right there. Yes. We inform people kicking ass rapper who normally I would play a drop of his, the Fart God. Uh, he makes the, the fart videos in his tighty whities and he just lays in bed. It gives the double thumbs ups as he lets out like these crazy long farts and he's got like Brown stains and his underwear and it's horrific. Right? John's soccer's Vegan enthusiast who makes songs about veganism and he has the Deacon Vagina and how he, he makes, you know, ridiculous songs, comedy songs, all about veganism. And He's told, he made a video where he wants to eat every woman's vagina if they're Vegan. Oh, so stupid. Um, okay, so that's just a set up. So they are, there's those two. You share a bed with them, have no contact with the outside world and no form of entertainment other than whatever you and your person of choice choose to do for fun.

Speaker 2:          01:00:20       John Soccer's is allowed to bring an acoustic guitar for him. Oh my God. The king can bring one extra pair of clean underwear. Food and drink are unlimited, but you must follow their diet choices. Exactly. Which will be delivered through a tray slot. So I was to avoid outside context, whatever they choose to eat, you eat, who becomes your 30 day roommate. I hope contemplating this fantastic choice makes you reveal those million dollar smiles. I appreciatively Steven. Right. Thank you. Steven Wright, the comedian. Famous comedian. Right. Thank you for listening. Um, uh, I think that's a really good, would you rather it got me to thinking personally. I like king ass rubber more. There's no, there's no question for me. Oh No. But 30 days locked in a room that is disgusting to be with him. It's vile. It's, it's revolting. And I'm going to go with Sean, John Soccer's, oh my God.

Speaker 2:          01:01:18       And here's why. Annoying. Oh my God. It not as bad as revolting and I feel like he would annoy me. There's on some level he would, um, you know, he knows so much about veganism that he would educate me and I'd be like, all right, I'll learn about this. Yeah. But I'll learn. So I'll be like, all right, I'll learn. Um, I would end up probably wanting to write a song with him so I wouldn't be like, oh this is third. Get out some creative juices, have some fun. Um, eat healthier. He's going to feed me his diet so I'm going to eat healthier. So it's going to be a healthier 30 months, 30 days. Um, if you live with king, asked ripper for 30 days, it would be KFC, baked beans, fear. He would fart all day everyday to the point where they're going to be probably shit cause he, he does Brian, he sharks like you did all day. It's going to smell like fucking hell in that room. It, it's going to be taught. It's not 12 hours. Listen, it's only 30 days of your life. So 30

Speaker 6:          01:02:20       day it's a month you eat poorly for nobody else will eat eggs. Don't forget, he likes to eat dude. He farts on them first. He's going to Fart on your food. He's in charge of the food. I know so, but here's the thing, John Soccer is, we'll try to lick my vegan vagina the whole time. You know Vegan, he'd be disgusted by you. Yeah, but I'm disgusted by him. At least king as ripper is not a sexual fucking predator. John Soccer's is too sexual for me and it would creep me out and he would try to hit on me the whole time. King Astra has no interest in women as is obvious because he puts out fart videos and burp videos. I think you're so far off on this one has no interest in me sexually and that would be the main reason I'd go with King ash of her and I like farts and burps.

Speaker 6:          01:03:01       I laugh at them a lot. Yeah, but you open a window. What do you think my life with you is like? It's not that far off. You think I'm on king after uppers level you please. There are some days you're almost as bad as aspirin. Yes dude, there's one but Ali and okay there's one and yes, you put that Goddamn fan next to our bed so you fart into the fear hasn't been on since we've been here. And then the fan blows the fart in my face. You've been doing that for years. I am. I am used to this fan on tonight. I am learning this to this art torture and tonight f a r. T I'm used to this kind of behavior to me that will be like you in tidy whities from Oh thank you, your honor. Come here. Let me tickling like that guy.

Speaker 5:          01:03:49       I love that guy. I hate him. I think he's awesome. Uh, so nasty talk last week we played that for a, I think his name is Orlando is articulate it this way. Know what? I don't like it. I got new stuff for you. I took it that way in that diamond is always a plus a bitch. Oh my God. I like him.

Speaker 6:          01:04:12       Diamonds in the crab is per se. So

Speaker 5:          01:04:18       turns out we were like, Oh, who is this guy? And he's a a known guy. Yeah, he was on, that's so raven, which is so that's so raven. Orlando Brown is his name. Uh, he did Vlad TV and interview. So check out the diamonds in the crevice of your pussy guy giving an interview. I'm like, God will speak in it. Speaking of Raven and Mickey Mouse, you had that line and no fear. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 15:         01:04:44       You know a lot of them talking about so many months, so many miles to suck my suck. Like Raven did what? She was black. When you hear that rat a tat, I suggest you Nigga Scott. Oh yeah. Well I mean just that.

Speaker 5:          01:04:55       Oh yeah. Wow. That's pretty good. What do you mean to say? Like Raven did when she was black?

Speaker 15:         01:05:01       I mean, I told you in the first interview, I mean, she gave me and I gave her some, but I do, I do.

Speaker 6:          01:05:13       Yay. Yeah. Oh Wow. So

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       he's saying that he ate ravens box. Yeah, she's pretty, yeah. There's no reason. There's nothing weird about that. I'm just saying he has an interesting way of showing it. So interesting is that you and I have been going to tender Greens lately. That's become our jam. Yeah. Yeah. God bless tender Greens. You and I are huge fans and lately we've been seeing people with throat tattoos a lot and he's got, it's a good move. I think if you're looking to put yourself into a, uh, a cat and a unique category where there's opportunity, there's um, originality, there's no, no threat, perceived threat of your behavior. It's the um, it's the choice to get a throat peace and good for customer service. Absolutely. When you walked to the register, yeah, we went to our tender Greens and this really cute 20 something year old girl. Super Nice.

Speaker 2:          01:06:17       I mean super sweet, but it's an aggressive, uh, it was a cat right on her throat, like a big one too. And I imagine when she envisioned it, it probably didn't feel that severe in her mind. And then when you get like a black cat, it's pretty severe. It's really, she was like five feet tall, so tiny, tiny. She was like her head down looking at the register. Then it looks up and you're like, oh my God. And there's another tender Greens employee that has a throat tattoo as well. There was to throw tats are aggressive. I don't know what it is about tender Greens, but they're employees are covered in an aggressive tattoos. Not that I don't oppose it. I think it's entertaining. I know, but I'm not so sure that's where you want to go as a business model. You know you got family people coming in there and not everybody is as open to the throat tattoo as you and I are. No, it does limit your job choice. What do you mean you're worried? Tender Greens that you work at attach shop. Yeah, the job stoppers. Right? Your work at a knife store.

Speaker 2:          01:07:26       There's tender Greens, the knife store, pet store maybe. I think you want to stay away. I've always, you know, retail is hard. I think face is not the best idea. And then I also want to throw in throat. Yeah, I think it's an addendum to the face tattoo that you had. Yeah. Clearly either your Mike Tyson and that's it with the face tattoo. Very few people can pull those off. Very, very few and by a few I think we mean one. So yeah, it's, it's always a long or would you rather get the throat cool tattoo of the cat? Like the one that that girl or you get the Tyson and it's as an homage to him and people know that you and he are acquaintances. That's a little much on the fan blowing out to be like, Hey, I got a tattoo. Like did it on my face.

Speaker 2:          01:08:15       Like here's my thinking is that if you were to do the face tattoo and people know it already, they would go, oh, Tom Segura loves Mike Tyson so much that he did an oh my gosh, he's crazy. He's mentally, but you're going to get that anyways for the throat tat don't you think? Yeah. That's really scary to see. I think, um, I think it went with face. They go like, okay, I know what I'm dealing with here. And I think when someone sees that throat tattoo, they're like, what am I dealing with? Right. That's when you level, because I feel like the throat tad is dot. Yeah. It's like, it's gotta hurt so bad. So tender the, yeah. Yeah. Um, and then just, and then she has a, she had a filled in black cat. Yeah. So there's color in that thing. He goes over and over and just what's up, bro.

Speaker 2:          01:09:03       Yeah. And when you look at someone and they have the, and then the crazy thing is that somebody with that throw tattoo immediately are going to be like, oof. Right. You're going to see it and they're going to be like, what? You know what you did? You know what you fucking did. It's the same thing as like, uh, when a woman has like the see through the shop. Yeah. And they're like, what are you looking at? I'm looking at your big stupid tits cause they're out. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Well, why? Why can't I just do this and you don't mind. We'll, because everybody's looking at put them away. Stupid. Yeah. Don't you slut shaming me like no sweetheart. Put a picture of a Nobel prize. Get over here and I'll take her your pussy. You know? No, but you didn't say, where are we going for it?

Speaker 2:          01:09:46       You said throat over face. Okay. How about this? Let's change, let's change the game. It's a face tattoo. But any face tattoo you want, you can get a teardrop. You can get, it's hard to decide on a face tattoo stars like Kat von D's got up. I mean, I would try to hide it. I would, I would do like an e under my beard, you know, for my sons initial or something. But you can't hide it. It's gotta be visible. Visible. Well, I'm going to have facial hair. What are, what happens now? It's gotta be like a teardrop, like a gangbanger dude. Come on your forehead. No Way. It's a knife. Yeah. No, I'm not doing that. He like Charles Manson clan. Oh, a swastika. Yeah. Originally they were exes and then later turned to swastika to x amount of society. I read a lot of stuff about Manson when I was growing up. Dark side of the forest. Can Pal, cork, Iran. So what do you choose? You're evading the question.

Speaker 2:          01:10:46       I do actually feel like the throat is crazier. I think, I think I would go through the face. I think I would go through the face and you know, I get, I would get a dot on my nose somewhere. Then I have a big black cat. Yeah, I'll do that. You know what I would want you to do? I think you should get your eyebrows filled in. Oh, cool. Yeah. Like why won't you do the haircut I want you to get, now that we're talking about this stuff, will you tell the audience I've asked you to do this multiple times? First of all, I

Speaker 6:          01:11:14       don't think this is as funny as you do and you laugh hysterically every time we're laying in bed. Just kind of like joking. You Go, why don't you shave the top of your head and give yourself a friar tuck? Yeah. You buzz the top and then you leave the, the sides around it like a horseshoe. See, look how happy you are. I don't even think it's that funny. And you think it's so funny. I think it's a great idea. Um, I don't think it's that good. What do you mean? I don't like that? Why? No, and you can't just get a dot on your nose. You have to get, there's rules because the throat piece is like this. Okay. Yeah. You have to get at least an inch, an inch long, an inch wide and in your face because the throat pieces way bigger and it's solid. It's not fair. What if you, what if you inked in your beard so you wouldn't have to grow on anymore?

Speaker 6:          01:12:08       That's a pretty good idea. Maybe I'll do that. Maybe I'll do that. You could tattoo eyeliner. I a lot of women do that. You know they tattoo makeup on women. No, my step mom did it. She tattooed on her eyeliner and you can tattoo lipstick looks fucking terrible, but you can. Isn't that the craziest thing you've ever heard to tattoo your lipstick or eye? Why would you, why is it that important to have makeup on all the time? So weird. No, no, no. What are you looking at? I'm trying to find a picture. Text. Google Friar Tuck. I did already. And it's not, it's not the exact hair hair cut. I want you want a Mohican? It's the last of the Mohicans. It, that's what that is. Google last of the Mohicans. Last of the Mohicans. Yeah. It's like a, it's an Indian thing. Not, not, uh, the cowboy, not diarrhea. Indian. Okay. The cowboy. Um, well, here's the images that come up, like kind of that guy is when I was thinking, I feel like it's a reverse Mohawk so that the top is gone and to reverse Mohawk. Let's see. Um, what is it? A fryer. Friar Tuck company. Get a Mohawk. They look so good. Haircut. How about for a woman though? That's the best. Can I give Elyssa Mohawk when he's older? Yeah, of course. Seriously. Of course. Oh my God. I love it. Yeah, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it.

Speaker 5:          01:13:36       No, that's not how I've enjoyed it. I want you, here's what, okay, here's the idea. God Damn Nice people out of it. Or we saw, I saw one picture of it somewhere. Um, I want you to shave. Look, yeah, right here. The top out. So it's like when a man is balding, like normal mail. Yeah. The horse shoe and then have all the hair long on the sides around it. It's a friar Tuck, but at the Friar Tuck it looks like it goes all the way around though. That's the difference. The Friar Tuck,

Speaker 6:          01:14:04       does anybody know what that Hairdo is called? That my husband?

Speaker 5:          01:14:08       Yeah. Which one? This one? Yeah, it's pretty cool. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       how about like male pattern baldness? Oh, in women. Women. Oh, I'd hate to have that. Yeah. It's not what I had in mind. And I want you to create it. Um, horseshoe horseshoe or, yeah, that guy's hair. It's hilarious. The Circle. Okay. We get the point in time. Yeah, you get the idea. But I want you to like this, like this guy's hair right here. See? Right. All shaved on top, but long you're at longer. I think that'd be real. Give me if I did it honestly, I would really give you whatever you wanted because I think it'd be in, I think you'd end up thanking me though, because you'd be like, wow, like this is a really cool haircut, but I can't really do that. Is there some other version I could do to get something from you? I mean, why? Why do you think you can't do it?

Speaker 2:          01:15:05       You're going to stand out so much. Can we fill your parents? Can I get a fake throat tattoo? Yes. We've got to get on it though. They're coming soon. We got to get on it. What would you get me for the Friar Tuck a car. You want a car for that baby? It's going to ruin everything. I can't do stand up. I can't do. You can do stand up. It's going to give you such a boost. You're going to be, you'll be on the today show the next week if you do that because they'll be like, have you seen how cool this new comedian is? They'll think you're new, but you'll you'll, yeah, or your throat. Oh, Dick. All the way. It would hurt a lot. Yeah. The whole thing is what do you put on there? Your son's name? No, we put a message on there this way. I saw one that had the word poison with an Arrow pointing towards the tip. That's funny. Yeah. That's a pretty cool denim deck. Yeah. Wait, so you did it dick over. I'd put like these jeans need to get tell you what, if you got fingerless gloves tattooed on your hands or the throat. I liked the idea of fingerless gloves tattooed on my Dick, so it looks like someone's holding it.

Speaker 2:          01:16:23       I like that idea too. But for this, would you rather have fingerless gloves tattooed on full gloves? Tattoos? Fingerless it's such a homeless deck to have fingerless gloves or a bad look throat cat at that checkout at tender green. I'd go for the fucking horrific gloves and it has to be become part of my persona. Like you're holding a mic so we're targeting would be like, wait, why are you doing the dice there? I'd be like, Oh fuck. And hickory dickory dock man. Do you know how long it would take to Tattoo fingerless gloves? I'm sure someone's done it. We'll see if someone, you'd have to do an image search school and they're like, it's, no, no, that's a tattoo. Such

Speaker 6:          01:17:10       a crazy, I didn't know. It might be the craziest thing I've thought of in my life. The fingerless gloves tattooed on your hands. There's nothing worse than that. There's no worst tattoo than that. It's pretty bad. The throat. Ted's pretty aggressive, but that just says, I'm fucking out of my mind. That's a really dumb thing to do. Or is that, is that a tenant like that? It's like Henna though. No, no, no, no, no, no. Those are just a real nice, it's a nice pair of gloves to tattoo of fingerless gloves. Yeah. Fingerless gloves. I hate fingerless gloves. What is the point? They don't keep anything warm. The whole point is to keep your fingers, Warren. I am glad you still gives you that grip. Your fingers can get out and take care of things, but I like to drive with them. Do you remember that? That was a wedding gift for one of my friends. It's so funny. Justin gave me fingerless gloves as a wedding. No, he gave each one of us together were a pair of finger. I still have it in our, one of my favorite things. So funny. Yeah. This guy is a little muddy.

Speaker 15:         01:18:22       Well, what do you mean by that? She was black. Part of what she said. So she no longer black. That's what she said. How she didn't say that would be bad. Yeah. Well, how'd you feel when you heard her say that? I feel, I felt like you dumb ass. Don't you know that the Cosby's wasn't predominantly black show mother fucker. That show audience. Hilarious Day. I mean, like I said last time I stand by her if she feels like she's Brittany Spears and all by God let her be Britney Spears. Goddammit. Mr. Lane called me. I don't give a shit.

Speaker 6:          01:18:57       Oh, hey. Hey. Now Orlando Brown

Speaker 15:         01:18:59       made another video about looking at breasts. Yeah, the Areola Areola, right. Well you said, you said that she didn't, she had clear every artist. I said there was, the whole titty was one color. We usually the are different colors. Let me tell you something. Look, no. Takes Him all right now. I said they will fucking name. Let me tell you something.

Speaker 6:          01:19:24       Yeah, yeah. It's happening. Yeah. So now it's Raven has one titty color that's not that unusual. My boobs were all one color pretty much before I had Ellis and now they're like, I'm kind of an expert in those. They, they were not the nips. We're not that different. Yeah. They were like, I was very pale and now it's totally different. Now I have like purples, mushy purples. That is going to be the name of the next of my hour. Mushy purples. Why not? I know. I kind of like it too. It's so fucking good, man. Unless you purples purples and now they are. They're mushy and the nips or perps now everything's purple. So weird and it hasn't gone back. Write a bit

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       about where she purples. I'm Gunna, okay. That's a good name.

Speaker 15:         01:20:12       I did. It was, it was. It looked like it had a category. What does a cataract is? You ever seen her? She don't want dogs. I know it's, it's just, it's, it's all one color around it. It's just a big, a big pink penis. He did.

Speaker 2:          01:20:28       Yeah. He's talking about Ravens titties. Do you like that watch? I'm going to get that for you. You love watch us. It's only $25,000 I'm going to take out a mortgage on the house that's more than that. Unless it's probably a fake. Can I take out a second to get the absolutely for a watch. It's a brilliant idea. Do you remember my favorite thing ever is when you called top dog and you told him we were so poor by the way are cute and so sweet. We were living in the rampart division. We had no money. And you said to your dad, dad, how much I'm going to spend $100,000 I said I'm going to lease a Lamborghini. And he was like, okay, I'm going to go. So we've got to put this much down. And it was like something like 2,500 a month. There's more than 2,500 that's it for a lambo.

Speaker 2:          01:21:17       No, no. I was telling him like it's, I got, you know, we borrowed some money putting like, you know we've got like $20,000 for a down payment and then a lease payments at least like 2,500 it was like more than our rent at the time. Quiet. And then you know, we're going to give up this and that and the whole idea is that all, um, when we go to, I'd go to stand up and people see me pull up, they'll be like, oh, like this is like a significant guy, you know, big deal. Yeah. And you know, this is a business of perception and stuff. And he was like, well, if that's what you need to do and the best part is again, and I was, I was waiting for him to be like, don't do it. The best part is I can get it gets 10 mile per gallon, 10 miles per gallon.

Speaker 2:          01:21:59       I was like, and I only can drive it like a thousand miles a year. So I have to really, really be careful of how often I drive it all the time. He goes, if you know, I understand that that's different business. So, so sweet. Totally was supporting my dad would not be supportive. Yeah. Not at all. No, no. What am I dads say last time my dad's spins, stealing our grapefruits. We talk about this. I don't remember if we talked. He, I remember he was like, I remember from when I first met you, weirdly, one of my oldest memories of you as you telling me how much your dad likes grapefruit. He just fucking love science. I love it too. It's, yeah, it's in the genes, but yeah, no, so he texts me, he doesn't come over. I, he's seen Ellis. My father seen Ellis maybe five times since he's been alive.

Speaker 2:          01:22:45       My son, since we moved into this house, we got two or three grapefruit trees. [inaudible] and my dad texts me, I might come over and get some grapefruits. Okay. And I'm like, all right man. And he comes and he goes, oh, it's too high. The three is too high. I'm going to go to the store, I'll be back. He goes, he comes back the next day and now he's got a tool that the actual grape grape fruit picker, this motherfucker is now pulling down fruit from our trees and a lot too. I was like, all right, get like a couple, right? Yeah. He's out there pulling for like an hour every day. He said, and he stole maybe a whole back. My memories of of grapes are Charro. She Oh she, no, she never eats the hot in their back yard. Oh, that's why. Yeah. When I was a kid, she's a slice grapefruit and pour honey into a little pocket, like a little squirt and then that's how she would be great for it.

Speaker 2:          01:23:39       I want a grapefruit, but so he bought the thing, the picker I now he leaves you that are around, you know, my side of the house. That's the only reason he comes to steal fruit. No. And then he like waves to the kid. Did he even hold Ellis on a Thanksgiving thing? So we looked at him. He looked at it, but what? He's done a good job or anything. Oh my God. But he did. He did. He was like, oh. He goes, you know, they're still young now. It's like there's not much to do with them. You know, as a grandfather, I go, yeah, cause no four or five does when you can do things. I'm like, oh, he'll be back in about four or five years. Yeah. See you then Kiddo. But what was saying like there's not much like not happening. He's only learning to talk, walk, stand.

Speaker 2:          01:24:21       Uh, develop a sense of self and separateness from his mother. It's not a big time. Not a lot going, but he was like, there's not much I can do. Right, right, right, right. My favorite was when he heard us saying good job to Ellis to learn to eat. Good job. Good job. He goes, I don't know the same good job too much. I think you say good job once at the end of the day he said one good job. Not, not all the time. Yeah. Cause otherwise you're saying it too much. Too much. She's like, I hear these people, women who are like, oh you did a good job. Good job. Good job is too much. Too much. I can't wait to tell you said to tell your mom that story. I think the Turner explode and what she's going to go like. Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:25:02       Cause your, your parents are the opposite. Oh my God. Very loving. Well. And they're also like, they applaud, like you say, applaud a shit. Tommy took a shit. Everybody gather round. Let's take a picture. Oh, I know. Every, every move. They, they, they think it's the best thing ever. Absolutely. Look at your self esteem. Look how successful you are through the roof. Through the roof. Yeah. No, that's why I look to you for guidance and guys, speaking of self esteem, uh, the weight loss challenge is ongoing. Um, a slight update. Uh, I've been really good. I've um, uh, made some adjustments to the Diet and I don't want to give away too much because then why, why should Burke a benefit from you or your knowledge? Just know that I'm, I'm fully immersed in this competition. When you're winning, I'm eating well, I'm doing my exercise and let's just say the numbers are a changing.

Speaker 2:          01:25:57       Yeah, well cause births on Instagram. I saw he was an Indian apple today and he's partying. Yeah. Can't lose weight when you're partying. And we'll see. We'll have to see what happens as they like to say. I might tell you what happens. He's fat. Yeah. Well, there's no doubt about that fast kind of permit, but Nah, man, I mean that, that I said all that to say it's just bullshit. I said nothing. He said nothing. I said nothing, man. I said, I said enough to get people to watch and they watch. Yeah, you just did. Yeah. Silly goose. I liked the guy. I gotta say I like him in the crevice of your pussy.

Speaker 2:          01:26:34       I don't like when he juggles it and stuff, but I like him. I think he's, he's a cute guy. He's in a, I don't know, he's a cute guy. He's a nice guy. He's handsome. Um, Bandana. But I liked how he looked in the other one. He's got nice teeth. I feel like you have a real strict policy on leftovers. Um, it's like when there's food in the fridge from the day before, you're like, is this all right to eat? I don't like, yeah, it's from last night now. Like, uh, I think we got to, I'm like, that's the whole point of taking it like in a bag to go home. Not True. You're talking about Sushi leftovers, which you should not store Sushi and then eat it two or three days later. That's not three days later. That's crazy. Of course. I never do that. What I do do three days later, just fucking insane. She like a day later, which I think you can definitely do. You can have dinner at Sushi dinner and put it in the fridge and have it the next day. I disagree. I think that properly. Maybe the, maybe the Sushi chefs, they store their temperature. You have fish. Are you have an ally and not necessarily a Sushi board? Leftovers as plies. Plies has an opinion on it.

Speaker 16:         01:27:51       To explain to some of y'all when I just had to tell my mom, you bought it though. The leftovers away. That wasn't wasn't bad. You're pushing it Sunday. Monday. Yeah. You still eating them leftover hospital day. Then at the bottom line for the though,

Speaker 2:          01:28:36       that's a good point. He says Friday is the best it's going to taste. He's right. He's saying he's using Thanksgiving as an example, so he's thanks. Thanksgiving, the food obviously the next day, most of the two left. His primary laughter is the best day you saying right? The next day. The day after day after, which is my point. So they're after is fine. I think you're pushing it by Saturday. Saturday. Okay. Wednesday you're doing the cooking? Yes. Okay, so it wasn't I Thursday's the day of Thanksgiving. Wednesday night you're prepping and Thursday you cook, you cook it, the rest of it you eat Friday's fantastic. I'm throwing them out by Saturday. God, seriously. Yeah. You can definitely have some of that on Saturday can I don't think, I'm not saying that you can't, I don't think. I think really pushing it with all of that kind of food with Sushi. I definitely think the next day is fine. I don't think so. I I don't it's fresh or nothing with raw fish are out of your fucking

Speaker 16:         01:29:32       yes, that's right. And get a match refrigerator. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:29:44       that's right. He's right. He's right about everything is right.

Speaker 16:         01:29:49       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:29:52       We haven't heard from him in a while. We'll apply. I know it was sweet pussy Saturday. Can I tell you something?

That means it works. Yeah.

Just people were like, I got a huge dad boner for this. How do I see the video? People put it up. Give me a second. Yeah, apparently he does.

Speaker 6:          01:36:08       Um, I, I still feel like he is Canadian though. I hear a Canadian thing and the Moose hunting element to me is Canada, so I don't know where the fuck this guy is from. I'd like to know more about his story. I think he's still from Canada. I don't care what you guys fucking say that you ride any got from Canada. How can you say that? I don't think he sounds American. This guy sounds Canadian.

Speaker 2:          01:36:35       Come on. F A r. T. F. A. R. T. Here it is. Okay. And here is, what's the Red Fred who's name is Fred. Fred Eichler. Yup. Fred Eichler. There you go. Here we go. I'm going to look them up for you. I did this yesterday and I lost the, uh, he has a passion for bow hunting. You know, clearly America's favorite hunter. It was so, I was Canadian born and maybe he's Canadian boring. Fucking know that Shit, man. Of what about Fred was the same amount of personal achievement and his passion for bow hunting is taking them all over the world in pursuit of his next adventure. Fred truly believes that any animal with a bow is a trophy. Okay, his personal, any animal with a bow. Okay. It's personal quest to complete the North American super slam with a recurve bow reflects that state of mind. And Mid August of 2009, Fred harvest at a cow tool elk to become the first to take all 29 North American big game animals with a recurve bow and complete the super slam. Fred has been fortunate enough to share his love, enthusiasm, and support with fellow hundred and it was a country, blah, blah, blah. Who gives a shit to a way of life. He loves it. He absolutely loves it. Real die hard. North American Super Slam. Now. See, that's why it leads me to believe he is Canadian because we don't refer to it as North America
