I saw a lot of posts. Nobody said anything. Everybody said it. Everybody says if you probably watch the back episodes of your mom's house, you'll notice that I drank so much more water than my husband. I constantly, I have multiple look multiple containers next to me. [inaudible] backup waters. I point look was in the tiny fridge. Just in case I get thirsty during a show

Speaker 3:          00:18:34       fucking so great. Now that the science of this one, this happens to you in public, is that you can't look like if you notice nobody's doing the holy shit, like you have to kind of subtly be like, Oh shit. Oh Shit. That's the hardest part of witnessing something like that. Remember our, our buddy we're having dinner was saying if you've watched the public thing and they were all like,

Speaker 6:          00:19:00       he was at work. All right.

Speaker 3:          00:19:04       I have so many things happen in a day now. I wake up too early in the morning. No know there's so much to cover right now. I know what you're talking about and he was like, we were all like staring at, you can't look when, when cool. Should have. It's like that. That's the Harvard of life. I ain't even talking about it. I don't know where you want to start with because there's so much to go. Much.

Speaker 3:          00:19:31       I guess we could even go to last week. I'm sorry to do this, but I have to urinate because I drank so much water. I'm sorry. I got to pee. I'm going to take, if I do, I'll take a picture and show you how clear it is. I don't take it. No, I'm being serious. I really do have to urinate. We just took so long getting ready. Just hit pause. I'll be right back. No, come on. I swear to God I have to pee anyway. I just paid. Would you like to see it? No, I don't. Just look how light the color is. No, I'm serious. Just take note and how white the color, but I'm just showing you how much more I hydrated. Let me say it. Okay, let's go. I'm ready. I'm ready.

Speaker 6:          00:20:13       So I just got to drink more. You're the worst

Speaker 3:          00:20:19       last week. One of the best Persian phone calls ever. The best actually.

Speaker 6:          00:20:25       Or um, Sallie. May

Speaker 9:          00:20:29       mother fuckers hope the boss. Oh my God. Oh my God. For one month. I mean it's some very, very up to do.

Speaker 3:          00:20:42       Hmm. My friends Sleigh, um, sent me this. He was listening to the Persian

Speaker 10:         00:20:48       is the time. You're right. This is the best one. She said. Bolds do. Said she is cussing a lot in Farsi and it's explicit for an old lady. So what she's saying is Salamay I follow this, this block and Dennis, he wrote question marks. Yeah. Mother fucker. Thief. That's what dose is, I think. And then close ghost case means slut, but it's literal translation is pussy stretcher. So sees this motherfucker thief pussy stretcher for one month, since February has been stealing motherfucker, I have a magazine, I will give it to you. Hold on to it. The magazine has a list of attorneys and real estate. So many attorneys, you look fine, an attorney interview one for $150 and then get them. But you need to look over the attorney early, get so expensive. Uh, those means thief. Ah, doors. Doors. Yeah. Salamay uh, although I, as I recall, she mentioned something about Fry's electronics and a video camera a while back. Right. I may have heard her say that Burke Chrysler's fat, I'm not sure by the way. She says in there, in the beginning of that trickster Hogo buzz or I don't know how to say it. Uh, and God goes literal meaning his sister fucker used as a very bad insult and those a lot was just a thief. So she goes off, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:22:27       wow, it's so amazing that seller May, and the saga containment though, we never call her back. We try calling her back and we got her voicemail and which was just meow, meow, meow. And then when did this latest one comes out? This one came a yesterday. Yes. Yesterday.

Speaker 10:         00:22:42       So yesterday a new one came in. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         00:22:45       From your mama ain't got time. You call calling. I was at home depot. We just had a phone call. Yeah, a telephone call. [inaudible] got home depot family talk to the cause you telephone took Jason. Why? It's so funny how you,

Speaker 3:          00:23:07       um, other speakers, other language speakers do that. Like they'll throw in an occasional word so that you feel like you kind of know what's going on and occasional what English one English word that you understand or like why would I talk to you soon in English? Oh. And I say that and you're a little bit assimilated, right? I'm just going to home depot. You

Speaker 10:         00:23:26       both live here now. Kind of thrown in some stuff, you know? Can I talk to you soon? But yeah, so the solid, now don't forget, we called her back and it went to voicemail. Yeah, yeah. Crazy. Yeah, she's crazy. But there's still, there's still never ever interaction

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       back from south that we know of now. We've tried calling her back to be like, hey, we're getting these voicemails and I just wanted to tell the reason I have Solomon. Well that's what you wanted to say.

Speaker 10:         00:23:58       What do you want to tell her? I think Tommy's a guy, but I was okay, fine. I'll have him. He's, he's in the garage right now. What do you want? What will you give me?

Speaker 3:          00:24:11       Like Richard Simmons, I want to do a hostage situation. That's terrifying. So I think tells me she will not tolerate very upset. She come over here. No Way. Settlement, no way. Soloman. Anyways, it continues. The saga continues. The Solow Mason never run out of solid ways. No. Very interesting. In the non binary community, apparently Dj dad mouth has been really impacting legislation because nonbinary is now a recognized gender in Oregon and good work. I also thank you, first of all, this is a personal victory. I consider it for myself and for all the other non-binary binary people in the community,

Speaker 10:         00:25:06       people, um, that we've been wanting to be recognized as such. And if I'm going to, if I could say so myself, I'm happy to be recognized as probably

Speaker 3:          00:25:22       and binary. I'm proud to come out as polyamorous than now. I'm excited to share that I'm bisexual and nonbinding. I'm excited to share it. Well, I'm a little offended personally because what about us? Astral genders, you know what I mean? It's coming. Look, it's going to be a long fight. Okay. Just the fact that there are recognizing some gender fluidity is what I'm happy about. That's the whole victory here. But what about a, I'm nonbinary. My pronouns are not optional. They them motherfucker. Yeah. It's in my profile to my Twitter profile. You have to be they them cause you put it in parentheses, they them. That's what you're supposed to do. What? I'm binary. Well, okay, you didn't know that I, I kind of did. Yeah. I try not to know it. Trying not to, trying not to know, just too much information in my head. Don't you think there's only so much room in here? Yeah, there's a, there's, there's not a lot of room, so it's true. It's tough to remember, but I feel like I want to point out that it's not a fucking option. So if you ever want to talk to me again or not an option, they're not optional.

Speaker 3:          00:26:46       My very part of his video is that he's wearing like a towel on his head, like what your mom does when she gets out of the shower, you know? Yeah. My mother was always naked as we discussed earlier, and she'd come out of the shower and she had these big Ol fucking milk tits, like those deck, that cal thing. We, Eric last week, you know, and has, she had a Fryer, crotch bright red cooch and she'd always have her towel on her head. And I just remember looking at her body being like, God, I hope I don't have a mom body like that. And now I'm blessed with the same exact figure. So that's neat. I am too blessed to be serious. I am too blessed to be stressed. Where is the looking at Daddy? I was looking at the very distracted.

Speaker 10:         00:27:29       I know. Where's the appearance on as Dj Dad Mouth, isn't it? Uh, your mom's house you to page? Yeah. Yeah. Go down to the unaired up playlists section. Oh, there's a different section. Yeah. Like there should be a

Speaker 8:          00:27:44       okay

Speaker 10:         00:27:45       playlists. Yeah. Do you see one that says I'm here? Yeah. Yeah. That's where it goes up there. Oh, okay. So that's where big announcement is. So I was looking at when I told them I was non binary, you know, I couldn't find a percent, but it's still that that adds up the male female binary and then I'm nonbinary okay.

Speaker 3:          00:28:08       Well it was a big deal. It's interesting. This is what, this is why I don't like that. She's laughing and you're, you're bravely coming out. It's like, why don't you take his pro not wanting to take their pronouns seriously?

Speaker 10:         00:28:18       What got this into Oregon's legislation. Right. You know, it's not a joke. It's not funny. I don't like that. She's laughing. Like I'm a busy guy, man. He said, hey, announcement. I think announcement, the big announcement, wanting to make a, is it last year, you know, uh, uh, I came out as poly and by, and now I'm proud to say that, uh, I'm non binary, you know, there's a big deal. It's a big deal. So brave of Utah. They kind of launched the whole thing. I'm so proud of you. First of all, I guess. Thank you for that. I want to say you're welcome to everybody in Oregon. You, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:28:53       So I don't, so I don't understand. Do you think it's like now you can take that off like it's illegal to legal, gender, male, female, and now non-binary. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:29:02       Which, you know, all I can see is that being helpful. That's the cool thing is that it's finally, it's like, ah, thanks for simplifying all our lives,

Speaker 3:          00:29:13       streamlining everything. Well also where your man or your woman, how about neither? Neither. Got It. Got It. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And also too, the other genders now, I mean there's so many other ones. How come was kicking the door open? We're excluding the astro genders, the Demi genders and sec trolls and the right just genders. And horses, gender versus gender is, but yeah, the dog genders, the waffle gendered, right. The, you know, earth gendered. Yeah. Fairy gender, whatever. It's a lot out there. I mean, could there just be a box, here's my preposition to you. Okay, go ahead. Male, female. And then just other like all the other gender can, I think would have actually what I mean, probably the best way to write it in and then that way everybody gets to have, that's true. I think that

Speaker 10:         00:30:03       just having the ability to go back and forth from moment to moment is probably the best solution so that you could tell them right now in this, but tomorrow I might not be right, but then I might be again. Right. And that would be like, okay, now, now it's easy for us to process all this information, data statistics, you know, we need to know this bureau. All that would be like, you know, right.

Speaker 10:         00:36:33       of uh, accidents and messages. We have a Irish pub.

Speaker 3:          00:36:40       Oh my God. Thank God. I've been thinking about those guys all week. What do, I don't think a lot is happening in that clip though. It, it doesn't. So are the clips in here? Yeah, the translation like matches up to the clubs. Got You. Okay. Lincoln.

Speaker 10:         00:36:56       So let's see. We have man, last week we play the master of accents is rarely stumped, but good Lord. Last week was really a challenge. Luckily we had Kevin from Ireland. Shout out to us. Dear mom is shut out from land. Rick Ireland. Huge fabric. Is it limerick? Yeah, I dunno. I think, which one is it?

Speaker 3:          00:37:18       Limerick. L. I. M. E. R. I. C. K. L. I. M. E. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:37:22       Yeah. Limerick. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:37:25       Shut out from limerick. Oh. Hello. Huge fan of the show. No, read the whole thing in Irish dear bro. Not I'll, I'll wait. I'm gonna wait a second. Uh, he sure. Yeah. Yeah. A huge fan of the show in the standup limerick is a county that borders Kerry and Cork, which is where Gaddy and cure. I wanted to help Tom with his impression. He almost has a town that was doing an awesome job I think with some translation to what these gentlemen from carrier are saying. He could nail it down. I got most of it. Um, but this is because I have worked in many bars here in Ireland. It was still super hard to understand as the guy that lives and works in bars in Ireland from there. Is He, is he a native? Yeah, he has trouble. Oh boy. You're goes, all right, let's see what we have here. This was so fun. I actually, it was amazing. Yeah. This one was one of the hardest. And what does [inaudible] mean to you? Does it mean to play? Because I ended up doing with the last two years. Okay.

Speaker 10:         00:38:31       He says, what does the a relocation relocate of the pub mean

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       to you? And he says, God, it means a pint because I haven't had a drink. Would lash two years, which means, cause I have not had a drink for the last two years. Oh, bullshit. Yeah. Yeah. Well that's his job. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. Sorry, I didn't, I can't tell humor and thick.

Speaker 13:         00:38:54       Yeah, that means a player because I ended up doing with the last two years.

Speaker 3:          00:38:58       How about a drink the last two years ago? Are they, they're almost depressing, right? Almost like the Blues Traveler Guy. Dude. He is the best. Isn't that Joe? That's the guy from the blues traveler. Joe Is something else, man. Most chops. They are really depressing, right? Jeans. Oh my God. Yeah, of course. This is a horrible life. All you care about it. Yeah. All right, cool. Well what, wait, what about the blues traveler guy is coming up. Oh, okay.

Speaker 13:         00:39:39       What does it mean to, we keep up to [inaudible] [inaudible] that we have down to dealing with him. Tangelos done. [inaudible] this well Eileen.

Speaker 3:          00:40:22       Okay. If I was raped though, I give it a way we, all right. We actually got a translation. Oh wait, see this? Alright. So interviewer asked again, what is the opening in the pub mean to you? He goes, well, and this is where it kind of makes sense for a second. Well it means a lot cause you keep up the tradition of singing and the music and everything like that. So let's get to that real quick about the tradition of fixing your teeth. That's it. Not a tradition I adhere to. So maybe we could start with that.

Speaker 13:         00:40:51       Cool. Me Too. But it means we keep up to solution. We really kill him. Anything.

Speaker 3:          00:40:59       Well it means a lot because so far I got it. I think. Yeah, I think it just translate it and I think we've got that. We got singing and the music and everything like that. And then he said, then he put it in parentheses. This was very hard to understand something like there's a great dancer. It was a great dance or darts, beautiful old dance here, Jig sets. Um, and then he goes Jig sets and tangos then something laughs and foxtrots uh, with things. Right. We're, we're back to square one again. Okay. Let's see if that hearing that makes sense. Let's see if that makes sense. Okay, cool. Christ Tangelos

Speaker 13:         00:42:10       uh, what was, he was ready to give me a little bag of tea and this letter, Wiley.

Speaker 3:          00:42:16       Holy Shit. I think he basically got it. I think he basically got it. Yeah. I Dunno how you fucking understood that. But now it makes more sense. And now for the master of accidents will appear and give this a shot and listen one last time, please

Speaker 13:         00:42:34       wait, wait, wait. You keep up to sedation seniors? We really kill him when Linda,

Speaker 3:          00:42:39       yeah,

Speaker 13:         00:42:43       that we have down to dealing with.

Speaker 3:          00:42:45       No, we have dancing and I'm almost there. I can't even watch it. You need to be missing teeth to make the sound good. Now you have any days

Speaker 10:         00:44:35       Yes. Yeah. He translated it. You Ready? The guy asks him, God dammit, had you missed the pub when it burnt down, you missed it badly. I'd say, and the guy says, we have where we're after building up an awful lot of money. We'll have to spend it now. That's the biggest job. Now we can, we can spend it. That's really what it says. Yeah. I never would have guessed that in a million course who would have guessed it, but hey,

Speaker 13:         00:45:01       burnt on you, Mr [inaudible] idea.

Speaker 2:          00:53:16       It's supposed to be

Speaker 12:         00:53:18       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:53:23       That's good. Yeah. It was pretty funny. That's, um,

Speaker 10:         00:53:26       that's me with faceswap. Yeah. Um, of course the irony is that he actually ate the ice cream, of course, to, to make fun of me. Right. Um, let's see if I can, he made a great one that really made me laugh and his hotel room, um, where he faced swapped me on to him and, uh, and made an apology. I think you can, I'll see if I can pull up. He was doing it apparently all weekend on his snapchat. He was just, he made a snapchat just for this. Yeah. Just to do this. Yeah. Because it's a very new account. Yeah. He's done. He's done really well by the way. People are, I've told us that they're going back to the tattoo parlor to have roommate oh eight.

Speaker 3:          00:54:15       Oh No. From, from that look. Better late than never guys.

Speaker 10:         00:54:20       Um, there's a, there's a

Speaker 3:          00:54:23       bunch of birdies fat stuff though. It's getting out of control. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:54:28       Um, why can't I find, here we go. Here's, here's what Burt did right here. See if this plays

Speaker 3:          00:54:39       okay guys, it's a big Tom Square up. Just want to apologize for starting this whole big fat campaign on bird. It's a really good, yeah, it's funny. Yeah. It's a not fair. I'm just so much better than I know that. No, I'm well aware of it. So, uh, I'm sorry. The best part about this is that people were there. Like, Tom, you really do look really fat here in this photo right now that you're on birds phase. You look really, really fast. Oh man, there was so many good ones. I think it's motivating Bert to slim down a bit. It's motivated everybody. I know that it's motivated Bert to stop night eating. I have a source, I won't, I won't reveal my source. Yeah. In Chicago, he's at the Improv and I got a text message, hey Burt's here. Yeah. And I go tell him he's fat.

Speaker 3:          00:55:34       Yeah. And my source when, it's funny you mentioned that because he wanted to eat late at night and he said, I can't because too many people are calling me fat. So we're actually making a dent in Burt's dieting plan. The funny thing is his efforts to push backers so much weaker. Right. I got two tweets that are clearly from people. They were at the show that he was doing like, um, and like I'd look at the, the where they are and they're in Chicago, which is where he is. And they're like, Tom, you're you're fucking fat or yeah, I just saw bird. He's clearly been working out. I'm like, did he dictate this to you? Yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:56:11       Um, and then

Speaker 3:          00:56:13       I, we just see a hundred yeah. To Burton or clearly winning. It's a landslide victory. The bird is clearly better than you know. I know. Clearly fatter. There's, there's no comparison. We

Speaker 10:         00:56:24       even have a, a song somebody made a fucking song. Is that in the folder? No. Uh, they actually might be. I think it might be standalone. Standalone. A MC. Yup. Here it is. Okay,

Speaker 10:         01:06:02       Said I thought he was saying you in the greatest on the planet to the people back wherever. Oh, okay. Certainly not Saskatoon.

Speaker 15:         01:06:10       Yup. Loud tonight. So real excited. Okay, first thing, let's just kick the here I got here. No, we're somewhere fair cowboy. This one you guys,

Speaker 10:         01:06:24       he's so tiny. No

Speaker 15:         01:06:28       loud enough for you. You got to help me. But I hear Bon Jovi.

Speaker 10:         01:06:42       Oh Man. So this is like some just natural. It's boring, right?

Speaker 3:          01:06:47       Let's go on for 10 minutes. I'm saying, I just don't think he gets how it works. Shorter is better.

Speaker 15:         01:06:53       It's going to be the funnest train wreck. Dude says hi Garth. Where's Tricia? Tricia is in the Glam squad right now. She's a, she's a getting made up and get ready for her part of the shelf.

Speaker 10:         01:07:05       One thing I will say, Trish was his girl. She's a, that's his, is she a musician? But before he met him, she's the real deal. A real deal. But um, I do like that he's talking about her getting glammed up and then he always looks like he's just like going to seven 11, you know, like he always has just like a hat sweatshirt. Really like dads it down. By the way, speaking of Dads, did you, did you pick up on these uh, uh, Steph curry sneakers? The curry to Lowe's home. Sorry. All right. So, I know you're not really into sneaker culture, but you know, ever since Jordan exploded and for people that don't know and you know, he's still the most dominant shoe brand, like as far as every basketball player, the big thing is to not just get signed by Nike or Adidas, but then your shoe, your shoe.

Speaker 10:         01:08:04       Yeah. So it's like these are the Colbys, these are the Lebrons, you know, so and then every year it will be like, here's a new release. It's the new Lebron, right? So it's, and then shoe collectors, it's like a whole thing. Like, you know, they get into, I got the new lebrons or I got the new kobies. Steph curry is the, like the hottest thing in basketball right now. It's, you know, people are arguing whether he's the guy that's overtaking that top spot from Lebron, you can make a big case that, you know, I mean, he's the best shooter we've ever seen in NBA history. He plays for Golden State and they're playing against, Lebron is California, Oakland. So they're playing against Lebron right now in the finals. But to simplify, look, the main thing is that he's, he's a huge, huge star. Um, arguably the biggest star currently. And so his new sneaker came out and it's current. It's the curry. I think the curry too low. Let me see. Curry two shoes. Here we go. Um, and they have been just been getting assassinated because they, everyone's saying they look like dad shoes.

Speaker 3:          01:09:21       Oh, that's funny. But I mean they got matched one is it, I'm trying to find the good picture of them, but they got absolutely massacre. I know. Um, I think when this loads correctly, you'll see,

Speaker 4:          01:09:37       uh,

Speaker 10:         01:09:40       cause he's been defending them. But people are saying like the curry two loads do not look like stability and a 700 credit score in the shoe. Like this year. I get it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just like they just got massacred with dad jokes, you know, like just horrific dad jokes. And as you can see with our awesome internet situation,

Speaker 3:          01:10:05       so we have like a thousand different internet connections, two lines.

Speaker 10:         01:10:12       It's in here. The routers in here in a certain hard line and your computer into it. How that's a good idea. Okay. Just, uh, I now see in red, I'm ready to fucking throw this thing through a window,

Speaker 4:          01:10:28       but I'm gonna keep going.

Speaker 3:          01:10:34       All right, now we're back. So now you can see them. Those are horrible, right? Those are such dad sneaks. Oh my God. You look like stability and a to have a hundred credit. There's such Obama's right. Cops are on their way. Three horror. Let me speak to your manager. Fives. Hilarious. Yes. Officer right here. I saw everything. Seven amazing.

Speaker 10:         01:10:59       Uh, Beyonce formation is disrespectful to police officers and 11, so hilarious. Yeah. And so, and then he's of course make America great. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:11:12       Huh. Uh, I

Speaker 10:         01:11:13       was told by apple care. Great. And then he of course is the very thing, he's defending his shoes, obviously multimillion dollar contract, but they look straight up like dad shoes right now. Those are terrible. These are, I've resigned, terrible, terrible. Don't touch my penis. And then he can say that all he wants, you know, and people say, uh, under fired their head of design. Yeah. It's task through this backlash and they rehired. They're old head of design. Who had gone to Nike and came back. Oh Wow. Yeah. It was because of this. Yeah. I mean not, and that's not cool at all. And I'm not, I don't know shit about cool snakes, but those aren't terrible. Yeah. Um, I'll tell you who does wear it. Like Garth is like, I'm mad, I'm Jim knew south courage to Lowe's isn't fucking dope man.

Speaker 15:         01:12:04       Really. Somebody who hasn't seen this show. It breaks my heart to say this. And I also say what's the most pride? Because she knows the highlight of the show. I cry every time and I know I shouldn't be used to it by now, but just love that woman lover challenge, pleased and very thankful. We're very lucky to be jury.

Speaker 3:          01:12:21       Throw up all their obs is the best part of the show. Can you believe that bullshit? No. I mean, look, you and I, we support each other in comedy, but we never, I, I really feel like it's so weird.

Speaker 10:         01:12:35       G

Speaker 3:          01:12:37       double handling. Don't you think it's so I'm forced to do that shit with your spouse all the time. Like Eric, I mean, we are so in love Maine. Tricia a picture right there. She's the best. She steals the show though. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:12:54       Right. Oh, there they are buying tickets to see Trish. Yeah. Or Garcelle girl. They would, so they would buy tickets to see her if she's okay. I just don't know that world. But he's definitely a bigger name. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's so funny. Yeah. He now I love her so much. We got to declare our love more publicly, Tom. That means it's real. Let me see if this came through. I um, did that night go through. God dammit. What are you going to do? Who's Dick? You got to suck to make this shit work around here. You know what's wrong then? I'm looking for this, a email to come through. It always gets kicked out of my me thing, you know? Yeah. Go ahead and take a look. Go to the next thing.

Speaker 3:          01:13:40       Um, okay. Well it kind of involves you go ahead. So we were playing with baby jeans this weekend and you were doing airplane with him and there's so many times I've wanted to show you videos online of babies. When you hold them over your head, you've got to be careful because they will vomit and it'll hit your face. And I've always been like shy, show them those videos na and

Speaker 10:         01:14:08       it happened to you. Vomited into my mouth, into

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       my mouth so warm so much. It was horrifying for me cause you know I'm a vomit. Oh yeah. I think the whole, the whole world knows me. And that was like, we all, everybody froze except for the baby obviously. And I ran and I got a burp cloth and wiped you off and you were like, I tasted in my mouth, toys, his word. Come on.

Speaker 10:         01:14:44       Yeah, it was like that. It was like that. And um, it was pretty incredible men. Um, a couple of things stood out. First of all, I didn't even flinch. Right. I didn't even flinch. He just went, we were like this and he went black and you're like, I just sat him on my chest. Yeah. Frozen. I was like, I just stayed looking at him and I was like, help me out here and you got a blanket or a wipe.

Speaker 3:          01:15:14       Oh my God, it's all in your beard tail. Oh, it was so much. I had to shower. I could taste it. I could smell it

Speaker 10:         01:15:22       later because the smell is really, you're like, Huh. It's crazy how that's the thing about having a kid. It doesn't even really bother you. Yeah, it's not, it wasn't that gross. I don't know if I would've reacted as well as you did, cause I don't mind cleaning up his shit. He could shit on me and I'd be like, yeah, I can't wait for him to Puke in your face. Wow. That's literally my biggest dream right now is for him to Puke. I'm terrified of it. Of course he's going to, I don't want it.

Speaker 3:          01:15:54       Anyway. I thought that was really funny. Absolutely. My 40th birthday is on Saturday. Holy Shit. Are you going to, what are you going to do for me?

Speaker 10:         01:16:03       Please send Christina happy 63rd birthday messages. It's really amazing, Huh? I know. I feel like we're so much more juvenile than our parents were. Right. I like horse thinking. I can actually remember my dad's 40th birthday a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Because they had a surprise party for him. So it's like slapping my mind a little bit, but he's such like a, I dunno, just so much more of a grownup. I felt like, you know?

Speaker 3:          01:16:29       Yeah. Cause they had more responsibility earlier. We didn't get this much responsibility. I'd have a kid until I was like 39 so we didn't really, um, you know, people are always like, I feel like I'm 20 still. Like I don't, I feel like I'm 60. I do feel, I don't think I've ever felt young. I like getting older. That's the other thing. People are always fighting it and I'm like, it's great. It's great. I do, I like it. I like it too. I don't like so much happening around and getting closer to death, but every other other part of it's fine with me. Yeah, I agree. I don't, not too traumatized by it. I mean, look, I live in La. When the time comes, I get the surgery on my face. Fix whatever's

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       fallen. Yeah. Are you going to do that? Pull it up, pull it back? Yeah. Oh yeah. That's what, when it's when it's, I need, I think 10 more years on a few things and not get these eye bags done and I get my tits hoisted back up and to some reasonable place. Yeah. Uh, maybe I'll, I'll do that, but I'm, I don't want to get like big Kim Mans those look too hard on her body. Is there a way just to get normal looking tits? Like to get them high. Higher, but like not hard and weird. I can they make them look like for her tits. I think command got them in Bangkok, so that's why you look like that. But they're full of heroin these days. You can go to, you can go to Beverly Hills, man. Yeah, the SUPERNAP Supernet it'd be look bigger shows. You can tell him I'm tired of these big tits fart and I want you to de gas them.

Speaker 2:          01:18:01       And they'll be like, hey, no problem. Thank you. There's so hanging. Hey, can we talk about my new favorite show on Netflix? Yeah. Um, let me get this plug in real quick. Oh yeah. I, uh, I did charge it to the game again. Uh, this time, ah, a j Hawk was, I'm in studio and it's really interesting. We talk about all kinds of stuff, um, from every aspect of his career too. You know, just regular, it's like such a good podcast. We talked just comedy, fun stuff. He's a great talker. Yeah. And I think smart guy, I think I had this clip set up. He's a guy who, who actually won a national championship in college and a super bowl as a pro and there's not that amazing. I mean, it's been done, but not that many people win championships at the two highest levels in American football.

Speaker 2:          01:18:57       It's pretty, we had him over at the Mommy Dome, if, I mean, can I say that? Am I allowed? Yeah. I don't think he'll mind. I made, I made a shake and bake and macaroni and cheese. Yeah. And we had dinner with him and he's so down to earth for someone that's accomplished so much. You wouldn't know. He's so humble. Pie would think he is. I asked him like, what's the normal thing he ever purchase with all his NFL money? He's like, Oh, I love the I and a nice house. One time. He was like, is that it? Yeah. Yeah. I so sweet. Yeah. Um, let's see. Uh, can I play this file here? I Dunno if I can, I'm trying to play you this really cool thing. Cool stuff is real except for neat stuff. So yeah. I mean you've one of the few guys, you won a Superbowl in a national championship. Is there anything that is like similar, consistent on championship teams like that? Like an outlook from the players or the team?

Speaker 16:         01:19:53       Yeah, I mean the culture in the locker rooms, crazy clothes. I think everyone really gets along, hangs out and just really wants to be around each other. And then we had that a common thing, that common core, that thread that ran through. It was like everyone was always wondering like, why is burned Chrysler

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       so fat?

Speaker 2:          01:20:14       It's pretty great. Right? I mean even an NFL locker rooms are talking about, wow, wow. Charge it to the game. That's great. Please subscribe.

Just the, today I'm going to be listening to Melody Martinez. Second single off her new home, crowded me coming out August 14th and it's called soap. Um, apparently here's the confirmed and recorded track list, but might not be the actual track list. It's just the ones that she's confirmed in recording.

Speaker 2:          01:21:27       So he's definitely like a southern boy. Yeah, you can definitely hear it. He might be a Carolina kid. He's Melanie Martinez, some Teeny dos alphabet boy dos halfhearted. Still haven't heard. Pity party trying to, we'll still haven't heard soap about to here. Um, haunted. Still haven't heard. See because I haven't heard sippy cup to her songs for babies. Haven't heard bump on Monday. I haven't heard a teddy bear or haven't heard. I'll toss that had our y'all a thousand words haven't heard home too, so. Gotcha. I'm going to look up who the hell Melanie Martinez is as he's listening to this song that we don't want to get flagged on youtubes with. Um, but Melanie, Tina's, yeah, the titles.

Speaker 2:          01:23:41       You loved it. Last verdict. My conclusion, like you just tasted some food right there. Could you imagine if there was at this age, how much dumb shit you and out of so many videos that would be mortified by? I would have been like super goth, put up golf videos, so embarrassed. Just thinking about what I would do. I would have had a lot. Yeah. Well, what'd you talk about at that age? I would have thought that, I don't know. Every time I talked shit to somebody, I would think it's funny and you know, I probably would have walked. I remember walking around a party, went through the camera, just clowning people in it. I probably would uploaded that and oh my God, it was, I'm sure just terrible. You know, it makes me, it makes me cringe inside me to think about it. Yeah. Are you thinking about yourself doing it? Yeah. Cause we got a cam quarter, you know, in 1988 or something like that where I was 12 or 11 I just remember like hours in front of that thing doing commercials for fake products and singing like I was, you know the singer, whatever. Oh that's embarrassing. By the way, can we get a mom and wondering what you think if I should give this a shot, I don't know. Would you rather to, okay.

Speaker 11:         01:25:12       Hi, I'm Elena Pagosa and while I'm a wrestler, so I usually try to do one deep tissue massage a month. I heard about Dr and she has this thing called the bite massage.

Speaker 2:          01:25:25       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:25:27       Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Alina. So what is the bite massage consist of? Cause I usually extraditing well but is it usually extra? Do you call it? Do you add an additional cost if they want that? No, no. I started out the massage with that before we put all the messy creams and oils. Do you wipe them down? You don't wipe your clients down, don't you get grossed out? No, you are grossed out. You should not be massage therapists. I've seen it all and smells it all. Oh God, I've seen it all. Smelled the nervous about the bite massage because I don't,

Speaker 2:          01:26:08       it's a different technique, so no, I'm open to it and get over it. Yeah, it feels good.

Speaker 11:         01:26:18       Don't be afraid. I started doing this when I was five years old and my mom, because she wanted me to massage her, but my hands weren't strong enough so she just kept saying, bite me, bite me. So I've been doing this my whole life. It sounds strange and unconventional, but it's to die for. Okay. Okay. Hopefully all day it won't hurt no more. Okay, here we go. Why? Why? I told ya? I don't know. I don't know. It's all inviting your back. There's literally no other way to explain it, but it feels really good. Sometimes they do. People buttocks, right? Knowing on it. She's subsiding pervert. It looks like a little rat. This is her thing. Wait, but wait til you hear why. The reason why my clients are mostly celebrities, it's a simple reason. I wanted to get in free to see concerts when I was little. I wanted to meet the people on stage who write the lyrics that I hold so close to my heart and therefore I thought, hm, I'm very good at massages. So how about if I try to barter?

Speaker 2:          01:27:19       Basically? Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:27:20       It feels good. Right? It's almost like getting beat out of you when you come to me. You know,

Speaker 2:          01:27:26       she gave her client list at one point and it was David Bowie. Uh, wow. I had on the list on the cheat sheet. It's on there. Yeah. Wow. And she bit David Bowie? Yes. [inaudible] oasis. They got their first massage ever from no love. No, they'd never had massage was kind of like those too. And she bit there. They're buttholes and yeah. About your ball bag. I think she does do that exact same thing. Well, if it's like staying and stuff, she was a groupie. Yeah. Yeah. Well that's what it sounds like. She's saying. That's how I got started in this, you know? Yeah. Just by index and stuff. Yeah. How'd you like the, the bite massage you think? No, I don't want that. I want that either. I don't need her to do that. No. Stick to the elbows and fingers. Yeah, I agree. So crowding. It sounds a little.

Speaker 2:          01:28:22       Yeah. I mean, I do like this. She does not, she's not bothered by smells. Wow. It's only smells very much. Only smell. What do you think your asshole smells like when you go in? Uh, I try to be nice about it and wash it, you know? Yeah. Yeah. He had a lot of brown this morning. Yes.

Speaker 3:          01:32:28       No, I'm saying I would change your diet. Oh, you would? Yeah, I'm saying I would prefer that to pureeing everything I ever eat cause I enjoy eating too much. Your Shits are disgusting and Sword Ellis'. I just wipe it up and move on. I have to get a much bigger diaper. Genie.

Speaker 10:         01:32:45       You probably start trimming the hair back there too, because it makes it clean up way alone. Trimming your hair. Change my trimming my butthole hair. Yeah, that's true. I never thought of that. We're going to have to get you waxed for sure and then I would put it off. I haven't done it. I know. Now we'll just make sure that you do that. We do want to hear some submitted ones. The came, Nick said, would you rather have horrendous, nasty sewer mouth that everyone around you can smell where whenever they're around you or everyone around you has putrid, wicked, bad breath. It only you can smell. So either everyone's smelling bad breath or you're smelling everyone else's bad breath. I'd rather smell everyone else's and be the source of misery. Oh man, that's rough. I just had an Uber ride and I sat up front. I was with my cousin and her husband. And have you ever had that where you could smell the driver's breath from across the other seat and you're like, Jesus man. Yeah, I feel like someone shit in your mouth. They know wafts over every fear is not crack the window just to, and I leaned my head out just a brief.

Speaker 3:          01:33:49       I kind of like feels shitty smelly dog mount. Like it smells like a fish market, but I kinda like it. I don't know why. Cause he's just so sweet.

Speaker 10:         01:34:00       What would you choose? I think I would have to just be shit mouth. You'd be the ship mouth? Yeah. Oh,

Speaker 3:          01:34:10       but then what about us and our marriage? We you don't care. No, I do. But you just fight through it, man. I have to suffer. You're basically saying that I have to suffer. I don't suffer. It's terrible. You don't choose me over you suffering. That's not love. What do you mean this though? I'm choosing to smell everyone else's so that I don't make other people suffer. You're choosing to make other people suffer by being the source of their misery. No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 10:         01:34:34       Oh, that's not true. I'm just, I just don't want to smell anyone else's bad breath. They'll be so harsh about it. Selfish. Yeah. Here's one other one that came in that one, by the way, that I say who was from that was from nick. This is a, would you rather have a 10 inch painter, but you can only have sex once a year or for 30 days. You have to shit out of

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       10 inch. Super from log once an hour. That's 24 10 inch shifts a day for 30 days. Jesus. So many variables in years. It's, um, I don't, I can't follow it. That was Greg too complicated. Okay. Can I do mine? Yeah. A professional. Would you rather? Okay. Okay. You Ready? I'm listening. And this is tailored to you, so you need to pay attention to this. Okay. Watch. Okay. Would you rather have to listen to your dad's stories over and over and he tells the same five. Okay. And then, yeah, I'd tell you about the time and I'm really ready. I think a kind of ready to dial it back. Okay. Getting ready to retire. Okay. Yeah. So you have to listen to your dad, tell the stories, the same stories or you have to tell the same jokes. Oh, well I just going to reality for the next 10 years.

Speaker 2:          01:35:57       Three Allity is already number one. Yeah. Reality is I'm living in that. There's not a thing like, hey, what would it be like if my dad told the same stories? That's what happened. But I mean, you're all all day, every day. Your option is the only communication you have with somebody is with your father and he tells you the same stories. I'm getting better at processing my emotions when he does tell the same stories. So I would do that because I know I can't do the same job for 10 years, you know, it's torn them over about horrible, whatever, every 16 months. I just did it done. How do you think these poor musicians have to staff to sing the same? Goddamn do Margaritaville and you're like, I think it's kind of more fun for them to perform songs. Maybe. Maybe. Yeah. Okay. Well let those thoughts what I have.
