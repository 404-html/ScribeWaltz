Speaker 5:          00:07:35       So now we've settled on a white picket fence. Tell me bones sticking out. Pegging class. What's pegging? Pegging is pegging is when a dude has sex with another dude. I wasn't begging.

Speaker 1:          00:07:57       Don't bring in one loving to this. Well go to your mom's house, Christina. No, a

Speaker 3:          00:08:49       little bit of the East street face. He did that. Yeah. Yeah, Kevin. He did what? So Fun to talk shit about Springsteen on social media like post up cause he have, he has such a hardcore fans. Basically if I write something about him or Donald Trump on social media, there's always backlash, which is really, really amazing.

Speaker 6:          00:09:14       Well Springsteen is like a rock God wrapped in a an American flag, right? You cannot talk shit on the Boston. They call him the boss and so serious that it's is.

Speaker 3:          00:09:24       That's why it's fun to say that shit about them though. I know he's not. He's not that terrible is he? Is He really needs that. I don't think he's the worst. No, it's not the worst. It's a fun game to play here. I just think it's funny to me, it's just funny how people worship him. Worship. That's really the part that's kind of, if he was just like, oh yeah guys, great. It would be different. But when people are like crazy, so to be like that guy sucks and see people go like fuck right. People get really, I did a post on Instagram. We're at the rock hall of fame. Right. Just put thumbs down in front of a picture of him when I was there and I go, this guy sucks. Oh my God. I got a lot of heat. A lot of blow back on that one. Huh? And then Trump you something shitty about Trump I did on Instagram, man. It's just amazing. Like people really get fucking fired up about the dumbest guy we've ever had involved in anything.

Speaker 3:          00:10:27       So burnt Chrysler, who you saw, right? There was talking and actually last week we did this show and then the like five minutes after we were done doing the depth. So we got a notification that are new, that are segment on not safe with Nikki Glaser was going to air. We're like, oh, we could've talked about it right before it aired. Just stopped taping this show with Jon Sachs. So Nikki Glaser has got a new show on comedy central called not safe with Nikki Glaser. She covers all these really taboo topics and she approached us as a couple to do the topic of pegging and begging class. Yeah, it's Super Fun. We'll put this on the website, but just to give, I think what we shouldn't play the whole fucking thing. It's on thousand ranch.com two oh, it's up there now? Yeah. Okay, so this is just a little little touch intercourse where a woman inserts a strap on Dildo into the anus of her male partner. I like how Bert thought it was the name that the pegging is when a guy fucks a guy that's just called fucking,

Speaker 6:          00:11:34       yeah, that's just how they fought. Yeah, yeah. No, this is a straight act as a stray people by fucking Christina I 12 years I've been threatening him with tagging, but clearly you've shown interest in having your behind stimulated. You want to finger? I've wanted yes. Finger. You've given the finger.

Speaker 7:          00:11:54       No, no, don't even do that. My boyfriend's into stuff back there. He just won't let himself admitted. That's awesome. One of the common fears about pegging is who? I am afraid that it's just I'm going to get showered and shit, but that's kind of the price is going to pay two to give them a good pegging. Another fear is being seen as gay. Is that a fear of yours? I mean if somebody accuses me of being gay then I'll just come over their face. I guess he's been crushing my post. Devastating it for years and years. I know. I know. He's straight. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:12:29       Yeah. There's a bunch of, I'm going to fucking lose my mind if the dogs keep barking. So do you want to go take care of them and also let me call back instacart. They'd called. Did you beat the shit out of the dogs? I wish I did. I thought you were going to hit it everybody. No, I just told him to shut the fuck up. Oh my God. I didn't know what I was saying. He didn't speak English well. Fiefs Englishes Amaz bitsy, not so much, but it was who was barking? I couldn't tell because they were done not barking when I went out there. Oh, they're the backyard. No, they're just in the house to was barking at nothing. They bark at people. They know they, they've work at noises. They don't fucking bark at real things. Are we recording right now? Yeah. Oh, I want to, can I?

Speaker 8:          00:13:15       Okay. What do you think so much to talk about this a sidebar. We, for those of you writing in, we resolved bitsy diarrhea problem. Say thanks for [inaudible] but first can I just talk about this? We got her a dog. Burka. It's like a little thing. It covers her face. I'll show you a picture of it and now she can't eat. It's giving her diarrhea. So problem solved. That's awesome. Yeah, it's great. We um, we put her in her burka, which goes out back so she can't eat rotten fruit and whatever else it is. Yeah, we'll show you. It looks retarded. Okay. So yes, Nikki Glaser. Thank you. It was super fun. And the instructor was, remember that Australian lady we had on here that cut the hair out of her ears, cut her ear out of her hair? It's a little of that aesthetic. No, Sheila. I think so. I don't know. Maybe I'm a bad memory. I was tired that it wasn't like that. Yeah, no, no, but she was like, her name was ruby. She, she, the main thing that I really like respected about her when she was really great teaching the pegging class. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:14:26       But she, I was like, how did you get into this? And she was, you know, whatever. Just discovered it. And then I go, how often do you do this? She goes, I like him. He young and pretty. Yeah. She was like, like a dude talking about his conquest. She's like, yeah, basically. Fuck guys on the regular. It's great. Yeah. Yeah. She's a sturdy lady too. She off our ad. You know what I thought was interesting about that class, which they did an air is we asked like, should we do two fingers or three fingers and your asshole versus a Dildo first member? And she goes, no, you may as well go for the dildo cause it's about the same. Well, what she was saying, no, it was the, I think it was the opposite. It was, hey that looks too big. You know, how about something the size of a finger?

Speaker 8:          00:15:10       And she goes, well then just use a finger. Like if you're gonna, if you want something besides a totally different class, you know, sounds like it sounds like. Yeah. If you want something the size of a finger, just use your finger. Right. You know, which makes sense. Yeah. Which by the way, since the class, nothing's changed. You still haven't done anything. No fingers, no toys, nothing. I still got this totally fucking just open, kind of hanging out their ass hole, waiting for something to come in. Birthday passed. It was my birthday. Nothing. Well I thought you were going to get your anus waxed before I did any. I never, I never suggested I was going to do that. No, you've been talking about what it was completely after that. That was after that. After that conversation you're acting like that was part of no, it was totally separate from that.

Speaker 8:          00:16:01       I was talking about my wiping and that I want a clean asshole again. Yeah, but what makes you think I want to get in there? If it's covered in mud all. It's not about you. It's muddy. It's smelly. By the way. Your birthday. Happy Smurf Day. Thanks. What was really nice? I really appreciated this. We were laying in bed and you lifted your legs. You're on your back and you lifted your two legs up like a baby diaper change and then he farted and you were wearing nothing but boxers. You rent one and then you rolled over and you go, so what's up? Am I going to throw you the day to day or what? I don't sit on this d. No, I didn't go. Really? You're going to, after you farted on me. I said, how about a blow job, right. Do you think now is the appropriate time to ask for something like that?

Speaker 8:          00:16:48       Yeah, because there was no fart in there anymore. It was gone now, so now you know I'm not going to fart during a Bj because, but why the theatrical? I mean if you wanted me to touch her d, why the theatrical of pulling your legs behind your ears in your boxer shorts like you, you went out of your way to be disgusting. I wasn't trying to be disgusting. I was trying to, no, I was trying to be comical about it. Entertaining. I didn't want you to just hear a boring fart like, oh, I hear this all the time. I'm trying to give you something cool to listen to. Can we talk about the fight I had yesterday on the couch? Which one? The one that you were like, that really smells like poison because we had to mommy. Yeah. It's very rich. It's very, it's very heavy. I got the truffle Burger, which makes a bad smell on the way out apparently. And the fries. I did a heavy bag workout after we had those. Oh my God. You want to throw up? No, because it had already settled, but it really made the brown come out. Really? Oh yeah, man. It was the Umami Burger

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       that made the brown or the heavy bag. It was the fitness plus the food. But the combination, I think of a rich burger and a pretty intense cardio workout. You're going to brown every time. It was just no way around it. Did you? So which bathroom did you use? Did you use a bad day? Of course. Of course. I really prefer the downstairs. The day it's warmer and stronger. I need to, what? Can we get warm water upstairs? I don't know. And I know cold stream. It's not the same. It's a fucking firehose downstairs too. It's so strong. My asshole hurts. I know. I kinda like it. And it's like the seats super warm. Now I'm telling you, I've gone, I've even incorporate a little bit of your action. I've got even gone. Shit the button, you know like yeah, that's what I did. Yeah. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

Speaker 3:          00:18:40       Are you saying that you don't shit and then go straight to washing? Sometimes I go wipe one wipe first. Why is it good? Some of the general mud out, but you're crazy. I think you're wasting toilet paper at this point. You need to go straight to water to hose. Yeah. And then it takes it off like paint, you know, he really didn't have the power wash. Cold water doesn't work the same. Cold water doesn't work the same. It's gotta be out. Not the same. I know how really the key top dog taught me that. A lot of people were really into his phone call last week. Big feedback on that. It was really good. It was, it was ah, the magic that he shot on his comforter bedspread embeds. Right. And got a little squirt on the best bread. You know, I listened to that call again. Yeah. And the part that really gets me is that he wasn't, he didn't intend on washing it like he wouldn't have if he were living alone. That's the part that if you go old school, and I mean episode, I couldn't even tell you the episode, but it's where my dad sharded when we were together. Yeah. It was the uh, oh, in Maine and Maine and he shat five feet too far.

Speaker 9:          00:19:56       Oh, was yesterday. I didn't make it and I was, you know, it was so ugly. I had to go and you know, I misread the sign and the hotel and they had to go down the stairs and I, I was squeezed squeezing the cheeks going down the stairs. Yeah. And then went into one of these places, you know, where the, you know, you're rushing, but it's one of these handicap stalls. It's an extra five feet before you get to them. Yeah. And is five feet too far, five feet too far

Speaker 3:          00:20:28       that whenever the episode, whatever episode that was, he shit. And he walked, you know, I was in the bathroom in the hotel where we were sharing a hotel room, Tommy, you done in there and like, I'm taking a shit. What are you, what are you fucking asking me if like he kept knocking and he goes, yeah, I shit my pants. And I was laughing so hard and he told me what happened and then we're going to go out, we're going to go out to a movie or something and I go, what are you doing with those pants? And he's like putting them on and they go, you just shitting them? And he goes, oh, I shit in the underwear. Oh man, I go, but isn't there probably some on the pants. He goes, it's just a little bit of shit and I go, you can't fucking wear those. So growth, he wanted to wear them out. Oh it's so gross. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of, I have a lot of just shit clips from him.

Speaker 10:         00:21:22       Have oil in them already. Okay. So this is, is that the end of the day they were born, they would burn it. They would take every game every day and they wouldn't everybody shit together. He had multiple,

Speaker 3:          00:21:38       he's talking about shitting in the Shit and Vietnam in the burn. Yeah, they're shit.

Speaker 10:         00:21:43       Yeah, it was like a Porta potty. Right, right. And then you would, you would, you would burn it. Okay. Okay. And that's why they call it bean and did shit. Right. Cause right. Did you guys like, would you try to shit in similar places? Like if I took a shit here, when you come by the same area or are you just share wherever you want to? Shit. Wow. You would grab the boy. She just find it. What you do is you dig a hole with your entrenching tool, which is a military term for shovel. And remember when you're in the kind of food you're eating and because you're burning up so many calories, the the size of poops we had were about what a dog does. Oh really? Yeah. Because isn't the military food designed them to block you up to like Mras now they say are designed to be like, cause he experts we meet once a day. Why do I talk?

Speaker 3:          00:22:34       Do you hate luxury yourself? So stupid. Yeah. Uh, yeah, it's horrible. Oh, I got a bunch of those. But um, he uh, yeah, just a little bit of shit that's in there somewhere in that episode when an animal, he's an animal. I can now I see all these bottles. Just say top top, top dog. Like so old plan is here. Hey Buddy. Call. I don't know what this is about even.

Speaker 10:         00:23:11       Hello Tommy? Yeah. Hey Buddy, how you doing? What's up man? Just chilling right now. I'm just chillin. Chillin. Okay. Uh, uh, I haven't talked to you a little bit of your dental work. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Everything's going good, you know, good and uh, been been feeling pretty good. You know, your little traveling, get the Orlando airport the other day. Uh, the infamous Orlando Airport. Yeah. I was in there a head to catch a flight to Memphis and a head. Now the turtle, all of a sudden I felt one coming on. I needed to, I needed to get in there and take it down the Pronto, so I'll go into one of those, you know, terminal air, men's rooms. Yeah. And every stall is full except the handicapped stall again. Really sorry. So I charge in there, you know, really came on strong. Uh, sat down, drop my load immediately and then I looked in and there was only enough toilet paper for one wipe and this wasn't a single wipe down, I'm assuming. Oh, this was Elise. This is probably a five, five, maybe six. Wiper. Okay. Is it, would you classify it as like a glider or um, you know, a blast or something like that? Or is it just something, I wasn't a last year, but it was, um, in between, um, a slider and a sloppy Joe.

Speaker 10:         00:24:41       Hey, will you turn the TV down in the background? Yep. Yep. Okay. And so, uh, yeah, all of a sudden I look over it and normally, you know, as I've told you before, when you're traveling, you got to check to make sure this bay, I didn't, I had no choice in the matter. You didn't do your Rico. Yeah, I'm actually super curious. Right. Because I totally forget this call of how he cleaned this up. I don't know how I cleaned this up, whether he took his socks off or what do a recon because I had to go and there was no other stalls available. So you know, it was either there or on the floor. Okay. So, right. So what I did was all of a sudden I noticed that they have those, you know, totally papers covers that people use the toilet seat cover totally sick. I never used them personally. But um, always just sit on the seat. Yeah, I did yellow. Sure. Just set up, see the too much trouble to use those things. Yeah. And then you position them wrong. He ended up hitting him, you know what I mean? And then you create a bigger mess. So I don't use them, but what I found out, you can take those chairman little pieces in you that it started paper route or he is

Speaker 8:          00:25:48       so that's that and use that. Like you said it like a detective solving a case. Right. He's a brown lock right. Tactic. I've done that. You were at the house with her when she was there, but I've done that too. Haven't you ever used the, that is a a 12 paper. That's why let's take cover. I have many occasions. Many occasions. Yeah. Cause a lot of times the ladies room, there's no tp in the ladies room, no TV because women have to wipe it every time. Number two, so. Right, right, right, right. Yeah. Sometimes you're out a lot. That makes sense though. Yeah. You can use that to wipe. Okay. Ha. Ah Ha ha. Hey Dad, what a genius.

Speaker 10:         00:26:29       Hey Buddy, how you doing? Good. How are you? A pretty good, pretty good. Yeah. No. What's a, what's going on? Well, just got a, my new favorite lunch. She now is this seafood

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       Cobb salad? Fucking no, I don't see, is that the club he goes to? I don't know where it was. The same place every day. He goes yeah. And the dual lane McDonald's. I remember he was not a fan of dual lane McDonald school. Yeah. Yeah. But he still loves Mcdonald's coffee, right? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:27:15       Oh my gosh. Yeah. Yup. There you go. So it was your birthday this week. It was my smurf day. Um, by the way, thanks for putting it out there to the, um, to the general public on Twitter. Uh, get, tell Tom, how old do you think he is? I had quite a range. Uh, you'll never believe this, but nobody actually guests the actual age. Everyone Kelly older. Yeah. Interesting. So we gently older. Yeah. So I had everything from, I think the youngest age I thought I saw was a happy 42nd birthday. And all the way up to, I saw a lot of, uh, hey, next year's the big five. Oh, that's pretty cool. Yeah. All the way to 58 and 60. But yes. Yes. You are a young 60 though. I think a young 60 years. You want to tell people what your actual ages or do you want to leave it a mystery?

Speaker 3:          00:28:08       Oh, I'll tell them. Yeah, I'd, I'd now officially 37 years old. I remember that flies by man. 37 years of your life. Yeah. And you can't believe it. Like you hear it doesn't even sound right. Do you feel like you're going to die soon? Physically? Yes. Yeah. I do feel like I'm going to die. You really feel like you're falling apart. Is that happening for you yet? No. I mean, um, this, oh my God, put them on. Okay, wait, but do this first. Look at the camera normal so that they see what your eyeballs look like. Yeah. And then put them on. Now it magnifies your eyes. You look like my Nana. This is what my grandma used to. Yeah. Big Eyes. Other kind of cool though. I liked the frames. I like them. They just, they make your eyes look bigger while they make the words look bigger.

Speaker 3:          00:28:57       And that's why I like him. He's you wait, you can't, she, when you're aware of him, did you get those at the rite aid or are those three? I'll get the fuck outta here. These were a fortune glasses are really expensive cheeses. I know you don't want to, you don't want to fuck those up and cost a fortune thing. No, but my parents just would go to rite aid and buy the rite aid ones. I Louie them to read now and look at computer basically. Yeah. Yeah. And you're so old, man, doc. So fucking bad. Well, I had the, uh, I had the vision test a year ago and they were like, Nah, I mean you could get them but you don't need them.

I don't really, really crazy. Anyway, we were at, at the bathtub and I was like boom, they're getting away with it. We should explain this first. Okay, go ahead. We settle in. It's a whole like welcoming experience where they sit you down and you put on your, your Komono, the massage, your feet. I fell asleep during it. It was, that part was so good. Yeah.

Gotcha. You're such a Shit Turd. He brought up the road rules. If there's one thing I know in this world, it's dicks and Cox and balls. It's true. First of all, blue ban brought up road rules on his own. Sure he did. Sure. He said he just brought that look. Yeah, but he submits all the potential clips and then you choose this time. Well, I mean it was a good choice and you're the worst. Is that it? Is there one more sound? No, that's it. Speaking of Fuck Boys, you know we've been getting these horse shit emails about how fuck boy isn't about gay gay things and you guys come on, grow up. Everybody knows it is. First of all, let's look at the urban dictionary. I'm going to look it up for you right now. Listen, listen. Urban Dictionary fuckboy a person who is a weak ass pussy. That ain't about shit. Look at this. Weak as fuck. Boy.

Speaker 3:          00:45:55       Sounds pretty clear to me. That was very pretty clear to me too. Some people are like, no, it means player. No, no. It means a person who was a weak ass pussy. That ain't about shit. Look at that weak ass. Fuck Blake's urban dictionary. That's true. I didn't make that shit up. Anyway. Pro, you know, hot debate solved. Absolutely. Um, I also want to point out to saying that road rules club man, 80 years old now I want to point out to our faith fans of the show that I do now have my DJ equipment. I'm going to be hooking it up in the garage. Um, I kept it out of the nursery so we found that compromise, but I should be spinning pretty soon. I was in Vegas this weekend. I got to tell you this, I found out. Yeah, I did a private on Thursday.

Speaker 3:          00:46:52       Um, at encore. That sounds like when you're like, I did a private, it sounds like you're saying I'm a Dick and ball expert. I am a ticking box, but I did. I did a private, if there's one thing I know in this world, it's dicks and Cox and ball and I'm the president of the Dixon, you know, and that's what they hire you for your private private private event. It was a corporate event. There's are always dicey. You never know how it's going to go. But ended up being, it was with a bunch of um, uh, rich, rich as Fuck Texts and oiled people on linkedin. We all met on Linkedin and they hired me to do a standup show. They were, a lot of them were amp for the show, but I got to say it, they still, they treated me right. I had a good time.

Speaker 3:          00:47:39       I got to give a shout out to half jap Ricky what, who have jap Ricky and Kurd. So both of them, uh, kind of organized everything and um, yeah, we, you know, we did the show full charge came with me. Um, there was, there was a lot of memorable moments. It was just kind of felt like a high end bar show, you know, like it was like, uh, yeah, Ph do's where you're like yelling shit. A Guy I thought almost died, literally almost died in the audience and he might be dead now. He, um, cause there were a couple of guys that were passed out in the like in the seat. So you saw ha just completely out. And one dude, I was like, hey, maybe check his pulse because it was old. And he was like leaning forward. Like that kind of made, he made some gesture and then later I go, that guy really looks dead now.

Speaker 3:          00:48:37       And they, someone tapped him and he caught his breath. But it was like, it went from being funny, the scary cause you went like that and I was like, um, you all right. And when I said, are you all right? He went thumbs down. Oh my God. And I go, uh, and then the security came over and tried to escort him out and he wouldn't leave. So in the end, he, um, after the show he still had help leaving the room and then they go, oh, he ate shit and broke his nose on the way to his room and fell and broke his nose. He 37 years old. No, he was 137 years old. He was really old. So he was just hammered. Well, no, he was old hammered and they said, uh, I know he had, they said he had sleep apnea. No boy, you could see when he caught his breath, that's what, what happens to people.

Speaker 3:          00:49:27       Like they catch their breath. That's really dangerous that that guy's going to sleep right now in his room. Um, but I'd like to know if he's dead so I can add it to my bio. That's a good point. Could you say if you were a hacky comic, you can be like, I killed the show literally. Or if you're not hacky, just kind kill confirmed kill would be a great name for a fucking special. Right. And then you could be in sniper gear on the cover. On the box cover. Yeah. But at the end of your gun is a microphone. I liked that. But then do you have the caution tape over your mouth too? Like, well you have caution tape as where they put black stripes under your eyes. Caution car. Yeah. And what's your comedy shirt? Are you wearing a comedy shirt? I'm wearing the flame shirt with flames on it. Yeah, definitely Dj Dad mouth for a couple couple of comics I saw had those back in the day where I would be like, of course. So up and that was their shirt. You know, it's a show comedy shorts. Some people have comedy shirts. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:50:28       And then you learn all shirts or comedy shirts, shirt. Do just wear any shirt. Speaking of uh, comedy shirts and attire. Some really neat comments on my Instagram, uh, regarding my art teacher jacket. Then you, you can call it the art jacket. Let me, let me pull up some great ones from our listeners. So funny dude. I absolutely love when people, hey, Hey Hitler, this is on Instagram. There's so much Hitler on my Instagram. Hey Taylor. I disagree with Tom and most of these comments, not an art teacher jacket. Classy. Well dressed, high and tight fashionista. Sorry for big words, but you know, you know you mean all the real mommy's? No, this butthole is on fleek. Your art skills are high and tight, mom. No. What I'm saying? Can you grade my work? Mrs P is that my mom or an art teacher? Macaulay Culkin told me to pray. Told me in prayer that we should start treating your coat like it was famous.

Speaker 3:          00:51:28       Oh, we also got a comment from your friend who is an art teacher who said she was deeply offended. Yeah. She's like, what guys? Come on.

Speaker 6:          00:51:41       I love this one. Where are we supposed to read the chapter on Rembrandt or on neoclassicism this weekend? I was plenty, so thank you guys for chiming in on that. Everyone agreed. It's absolutely an art teacher jacket. Yeah, I guess. I think I'm still going to wear it. I don't give a shit to a class.

Speaker 3:          00:51:57       Are you going to wear it to do shows whenever teacher Jane Pauley by you really did get this stuff. I know, I know you have your table set up, you have everything ready to go. Ready to go, man. I just got to hook some things up there. I actually got a computer cause I can't, I don't have any room left on this computer, so I've got a computer to, you know, spin stuff like that. Do get, Oh this is, what am I to tell you? This will make you shit your fucking pants. So I'm hanging out at the encore. I'm talking to, to the entertainment director and encore beach club is basically all the vague, you know, Vegas is just designed to make money and you make it and a lot of different ways. Obviously there's gambling, there's dining, right? Um, but for the daytime and for uh, the in shape crowd, the whole thing is to go there. Yeah, yeah. The people, it's so true. People that are fucking young and hot, they go to Vegas and they go to the kind of the

Speaker 6:          00:52:58       pardon. Yes, that

Speaker 3:          00:53:02       is is, it's 140 degrees outside. They stand outside. There's, there's mist spray and then there's a Dj spinning and, and they bring in the top top people, right? Yeah. Would get a Calvin Harris. I don't know. So I go to those guys. What kind of money to those Djs make? And they were like, dude, they have,

Speaker 8:          00:53:26       I won't give out cause I don't want to, but they have two prices. How do they have two prices while they have the uh, the premixed set where they press play or the live set where they'll play a lot more. Yeah. And he goes, and a lot of, you know, the pre mixed set is, all I can say is this, it's well, well into six figures and it's for a two hour set and that's press play. That's, he shows up, he sets up his shit and there's a lot of ladies, right? Press play and then it's premium stand there and they just go, Yup, Yup. That's all you have to do. If you want to pay even more, you get them doing it in real time to the job that they're supposed to be doing and they get paid how much more to actually do the job even more into six figures and standup comedy by the way, is so fucking hard and it takes a decade to get decent at and we don't get paid nearly as much.

Speaker 8:          00:54:35       Finally that I actually was so far cad uninformed with like what these guys play. I was like, wait a minute. So what are they play though as the, I was asking because I, I honestly didn't know. The djs that I know are hip hop Djs, right? So I know who they are and the kind of music is played, but I go, what, what kind of music is played by one of these guys? And he goes, oh, it's music. You know, so it's like Rihanna or no fucking Taylor swift. But then it's his remix of that. And so they're actually playing songs, you know, just a remix. And for that they're commanding that kind of money. Absurd. It's not even like their own music song. It's just yeah they're playing someone else's shit. So that would be like you going to a comedy club doing like I'm doing Carlin's tonight guys and you do someone else's jokes but you do like your wacky impression of him or you record yourself doing someone else's jokes and just push play in front of an audience.

Speaker 8:          00:55:35       And they were like half a million. Give it to us. That even acceptable to do a prerecorded. Um, that's fucking crazy. So I read this article, my friend Eric sent me about these girls who for an art project decided to become fake Dj's. So what this girl never deejayed in her life but she took like a cursory lesson so she knew how to do it and basically what she paired up with her cute friend, these two cute girls, cause that's like the cool thing to do to women are better than one and they would use songs that everybody knew. So she's like basically that audience that loves his DJ stuff is a commodity, like a commodified audience or whatever. They only like shit that they know. Like, I don't give a fuck about actual music. Right. It's just like, is this familiar gay? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:56:24       And she's like, we put together the hackiest set list and within three weeks all the other djs hated them by the way.

You knew just oh Ah, Ooh, happen next. But it will be brand new.

Speaker 8:          01:04:00       What's going to happen next is your oral decay is going to lead to a heart issue.

It's like, dude, just fucking get your life. Get Jar because man, I'm telling you, I had to replace my two front teeth every 10 years and we were broke as a joke, but we put money, get mama teeth, you know, we got, we had debt from it.

Speaker 8:          01:07:45       You know? Yeah. Because it's that important. That is how important it is. I would say there's a lot of things where it's not worth the debt. People want to do things, things, but things on your face, face, Brown faces worth debt. Your face go into debt for your mouth. Your mouth. Yeah. Yeah. It's so important. It's so important. How did she smile? You know, when I got my, my veneers done this time around, the guy did them, was this amazing craftsmen. Yeah, and he said that people, people don't smile for years when they have jacked up teeth. Could you imagine not smiling because you're ashamed of your team? Clearly she's not, but other people you know and your muscles and your lips and everything change over time. He said that he'd get it takes a while to get used to smiling when you get new teeth. I made, made me almost cry hearing that like that. People don't smile because of their teeth. Yeah, no, it sucks. It sucks. I feel like that woman and this guy would be actually a great match. I'm going to show you.

Speaker 16:         01:08:54       Yeah. Cairo sage or I wasn't looking for trouble on the light rail that night. The trouble certainly found him and when that fight broke out, he was ready for it. With his trusty Katana, the fight had been going on for about 20 minutes. She was two on one and none of them saw Cairo stage zero move around behind them. To them, they probably thought I was just moving out in a way, but I was actually setting up to where their blind spot was. The sad truth is is that they weren't even

Speaker 8:          01:09:24       just to pull out a sword. Keto said you'd all

Speaker 16:         01:09:26       challenge. This is about what you saw on the train. It's folded tempered and it does its job. Oh, it says the three men on the train are lucky they ran because I already had a full, a full five stage plan ready to take her

Speaker 8:          01:09:42       a five state. Looking at, I love this at the brim of the hat. He's out of his fucking mind guy is completely crazy. Those guys in New York City in the 80s the angels where they called and they would, they would fight crime on fucking subways and shit. What would they call that? The blue angels. Come on, man. Pilots. I know. I gotta look it up. It's killing me. There's a group of nerds in the 80s and they would be on subways and they'd see stuff happen and they would fight crime. That's what this guy does. This guy though, there's a lot of fucking basement time in this guy. Of course. He's a nerd. We'll, we'll let, okay, let's let her talk

Speaker 16:         01:10:19       out and anybody else who got involved just in case. That's just the way I do things. There's a little poll sending between him and there and there's him, him, him. If he had gone on me, I was planning to go in, completely brought the sword down and then completely cut it out completely gay cape. I'm open because my family couldn't handle me. I had a surprisingly strange affinity. My family couldn't handle crazy sharp objects, particularly kitchen knives when I was a kid, so we traded in the knives from lifetime of studying. The sword, the Kitano, it goes with him everywhere. Actually carry this because I become a little bit more dangerous than without it than with it, so it's more of a restraint mechanism. Been a safety blanket.

Speaker 8:          01:11:03       I love this guy. He just said then he's more dangerous without it. It's a restraint. Yeah. It's keeping him from being as dangerous as he truly

Speaker 6:          01:11:14       is mind, but let's be honest, not it's all in his mind. Of course. In his mind it's mine. He's a superhero dude. I love it. Yeah, he's put, could you see him dating that older lady? Yes. That's the kind of guy that makes sense with like a nice do gooder a crime fighter. Please remind me what is the thing that I'm thinking of? It's not the blue angels. What are you looking for? What? What? He's these group of nerds and they weren't, they would wear uniforms and they blegh police New York City. Okay. The red, the blue angels, something like that.

Speaker 8:          01:11:51       Fuck. Do you know what I'm talking about? My man, you're too young. The Guardian Angel,

Speaker 6:          01:11:57       Guardian Angels. That guy needs to be a guardian angel. I think he is. Yeah, he is. I love him. He's a sword wielding guardian angels. He just watches too many, um, Japan animation shows and then he thinks he's like a Japan summation character. Really does think he has digital auntie. I love me some vigilantism wait, do you think those, it played the footage of the black guys freaking out?

Speaker 8:          01:12:20       No, not really. You know how black people freak out? How do they do it? Mr. Sword? He got a sword. They don't do that. I don't think it would be so composed. I think that that's probably more accurate or black do it. I don't think it would be like that. I don't think so. How would they do it? How are those black guys say? Some shit. If they saw a white kid with a story, I think, oh shit is exactly what, what happened? Yeah. I think they would. It would be like fighting. We were like, Shit like that and then he's run out yet Nancy. Okay. That sounds like that's people watching a clip. People on the train right here. Right. That's a spectator, not the actual shit. Your pants if you're in a fight and then the guy goes out fucking sword. Yeah. Oh Man. Why don't you that guy? Cause even in his recap to the newspeople, he was like, and I was going to go like this and then slice them open like that. Do was ready to kill people.
