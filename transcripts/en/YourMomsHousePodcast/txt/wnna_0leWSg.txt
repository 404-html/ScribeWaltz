Speaker 4:          00:05:47       Uh, it's so, it's so unbelievable. Yeah. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:05:54       By the way. Oh, this is what I wanted to say. Don't,

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       don't fucking break my balls spooky because I know someone right now is breaking my balls because there's no video today. Oh, well you listen to a mother fucker. Yo. You know, first of all guys, we barely had our lives together enough to do today's episode. This has been a massive move. And Tom, oh my God, left town the day we had one day here and then you left town and I've been alone with the baby and workers workers coming in and out. We have everything's chaos, have electricians and handymen and there's a guy right now doing shit in the house, like all kinds of stuff. And I know some people are like, dude, I fucking well I like to watch it and you're fucking up my well low cheese. It's chaos right now. So you guys are probably like, well good luck to you then. Well you know, we're like, you have a good fucking night then.

Speaker 4:          00:06:56       Okay guys, listen. It's a miracle that we pulled together audio tonight. So sorry. We're going to have to look. It's chaos in here right now. There's were, we did this like a, this is a makeshift studio right now. There's cords laying on top of stuff like this isn't set up. So No, I'm looking at just everything splattered everywhere. Yes. Bad and not, not healthy. This is a level eight hoarders, right? What's the highest on the hoarding? Uh, I think five. This is a five. Yeah, there's pathways, which is a good sign. You saw pathways. I mean there's, there's fecal matter everywhere, which is bad in buckets. My friend Matt told me, he's like, you know, and you want you to have the fecal matter. Is that when you're at a five? Oh yeah. Is that what pushes you to the last and no, no. Pathways.

Speaker 4:          00:07:46       Like you said, you can't have no, wait, sorry. So if you still have pathways, you're like, uh, three uh, yeah. I mean you're somewhere on that. You know, you're below, you're like that. So we're at a three. I think it's so hilarious that there's like call, cause I know that Guy Matt, what is he, what's his, his website? It's like five steps or something. I forget men. Um, but that's what, that's what he, he classifies people as the hoarder levels. Like if you've got dead animals, you're definitely like a five plus feces and buckets. You're five. You want to hear the, the, of course, of course. I live for this kind of shit. I love psychological things like this. This is so peculiar that says this is for for fire service. They they watch. It's a fire service hoarding scale. So level one is the start. Most of the homes we see are at this level. You countered large amounts of materials. It's us, but find normal clutter, apparent signs of insects, some apparent size of insects and rodents, clutter and we're the level one. All doors, windows and hallways are accessible. We're not even, we're well our, our doorways are not that

Speaker 1:          00:08:55       accessible right now. Windows we might be able to is a hoarder home. That the amount of overall clutter has begun to appear is the point where you would consider the amount of belongings to be over and above the normal level. Trash cans are overflowing, one or more exits are blocked. Housekeeping is at a minimal level. At level two, the piles of belongings may be at or above waist level. Oh my God, God. Windows are starting to be unusable as piles to continue to get larger. Level three quote, big problems begin. The amount of belongings have taken control of the house, making the rooms unusable for the occupants. Serious hazard for firefighters. Yeah. The goat paths become the only access usable space like the animal. Yeah, I guess because there was so narrow, right. Climbing on mountains on neuro level three, the clutter may be visible from the exterior.

Speaker 1:          00:09:55       Yeah. You're fucked. Stairwells are mostly blocked from below with belongings. It's just a narrow path. Level four is also the beginning of the end. Uh, the beginning of the end of the unusable areas of the home starts from level four. Most of the rooms are unusable, hoarded space levels. Uh, the piles of belongings will be at the ceiling where they're, all windows are covered. God, attic spaces are full. Oh boy. All cabinets are full. Even under the floor spaces. And level five is uninhabitable. Unable to enter. There's obvious structural damage. Broken walls, men. Does it talk about the feces and the dead animals or no? No, because this is like, that was what I read you was for firefighters. This, this day. They do that. They don't get into the fun stuff. Yeah. Roaches and oh, he would clutter cleaner was, yeah. Oh, this is a different, this is a different one. So this one, level five is, um, according to this, animals at risk and danger, uh, pervasive spiders, roaches, mice, rats, squirrels, key living spaces are not usable. Um, toilets, sinks and tubs are not functioning. Human, urine, urine, an excrement is present, rotting food cans or cans or jars are expired.

Speaker 1:          00:11:28       Member Tommy harder's where she was, she was like, well, it's not puffy. I can still eat it. Yeah, the bacteria. So there'll be like a, like a box of like soup or broth. And this woman would be like, the ordering cleaning lady would be like, this is a year ago state. And she goes, well, the box isn't puffy. I can still eat. It's not puffy. I can eat it. Is it puffy yet? And she would ask that and they're like, no, not yet. Well, don't throw that away. Shit. My

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       favorite two was when, um, the one, the women had a problem collecting things like beanie babies and then an entire bedroom would just be a floor to ceiling, like beanie babies. The tag still on like, well, I gotta collect all 700. This one's a limited edition. They're so crazy. The Hordern shows really do. It sounds like a bit, but they do make you feel good about yourself. That's why I think that's the allure that was the, I think why they had viewers. Yeah. I got my shit together. Of course. Yeah, of course. You watch it and you go, oh, my house is, there's a lot of alarming shit on that show. One of the most alarming though was when they had, uh, a psychologist. Do you remember that one? The psychologist was the hoarder. Yeah. How could you do that? And she was like, oh, I know I treat people.

Speaker 4:          00:12:44       But you know, the cobbler's children have shoes, credible levels of denial. That's really what it is. It's some kind of trauma. I think that happens. And then it's unresolved. And then they turn in. They, yeah. And they hard to deal with the trauma. Usually that's what happens. I don't know, unless some people are just nasty. Some people just so mad. He got to be so nasty. It's my favorite episode of hoarders. Remember the the woman that had 75 dead animal carcasses, 75 that was my, yeah, it sounds really, I wish there was more shows about mental illness. I just love mental illness shows. I could watch that. Oh my God, you guys are so disgusting. Yeah. So far I can watch an entire series of people who just shit into jars and collect them. I love that. I can watch that shit all day, man. Why works really, really gross when he's talking about, wait, so what's our house at right now?

Speaker 4:          00:13:44       Like a three. No, we're not there, man. You gotta be kidding me. It's not that bad. We're not that bad. But it's just, it's, it's still, it's chaos for not mentally ill people, you know? It makes me, it gives me so much anxiety to have boxes. I fucking hate it so much. They get it. Just the appearance, just boxes everywhere. It gives me, I just hate it. Boxes Smell. They smell. Yeah. You just, you know that and then there's just stuff like you're missing. Like, I've got the, uh, I've got the Cup but not the lid to the fucking, you know, like a boy, one of these right here for that one. It was just, and I'm never going to find that quarter odor, a whole other piece for it. I'm missing all kinds of shit. It's just, we will be back with, um, you know, with an actual camera show next week, but let's Thanksgiving week two, we're going to be home. We'll be around so we can straighten things up a bit more. Definitely. But, uh, so oil boy, you know, it was neat about moving Tom. My favorite thing and having workers around is, um, all every, every mover that was in her home took a shit they did bad. Yeah. And what's cool is there's a point in the day where the door would be shut, but the fan would still be on. So you knew that people were just to show you.

Speaker 3:          00:15:19       Yeah. That's cool. Through them. Through the door. You can hear it. Yeah. Yup, Yup. Cool.

Speaker 4:          00:15:31       That's what you hear. Like a stranger. A strange dude. Yeah. And like, you know that lunchtime, I remember lunchtime came, they broke for lunch, never moving day, our packing day. Right, right. There's a break for lunch and then five dudes came and shit in our move a whole house like that they had, they sent like the crew, you know, so these six guys show up. Yeah. Moving couches and beds and just heavy shit. And then all six of them are like, I'm gonna take a shit. Right. Shit. All Shit in your house, man. All so gnarly. Yeah, it's been, my favorite was we had a carpenter come a couple days ago to the new house and the guy shook my hand. Sweet guy. Yeah. Shook my hand. Hey, I doing I, my name is. So Steve, we're going to do the thing. Great. Great, great. Not Five minutes later. Can I use your bathroom? And I'm thinking, well, he's going to go number one. It's a morning. It's early morning. No, the guy takes a full,

Speaker 3:          00:16:30       yeah, yeah, yeah. You can hear it. Hear

Speaker 4:          00:16:37       it. Yeah. I could smell it. And he used the bathroom by the kitchen. I'm cooking for my son. I'm eating breakfast and this, this carpenter is taking a shit in my bag. Yeah, that's correct. Right here. But why, why save it for my house? That was a first call in the morning, you know, it was a cool guy. You think he wanted to pull over to Starbucks and maybe shit somewhere else, but he brought it to my house and I think I, I just saw what he did to this too. I think he gave me a modification hold there for this. Oh, I was looking for, I'm excited. I'm so excited to show this to people when we have it set up. Dude. You guys are going to shit when you see the studio. Yeah. It's a professional studio. It is. But we'll give you a tour.

Speaker 4:          00:17:17       I want to do this as like a Patriot on bonus or just a bonus. No, they, we'll just put it up man. Yeah. You guys to see the quality of the studio is bananas. It's soundproofed. It's got like velvet on the walls. Sound paneling, just beyond anything drastically. A number of major motion pictures were scored in. It's right. And we have a couch here that the original owner left behind that leg, Dr Dre sat on screen, all these crazy directors and this guy was a composer for films. Yeah. So it's a cool, it's a great studio. I can't wait for y'all to see her next week. Hopefully I'm your mom and you're my son and I fall in love with him. Are you really? I said yes. He said, you know what, I was scared to let you know too. I am too. Both consenting adults. If, if it comes down to it, you know, it's just like the gays. There's dairy.

Speaker 4:          00:18:10       As long as they're over 18 everything's fine. It's just like the gays, the gays. Do you they just like the gates. The gates. Yeah. So homosexuality, let's set this up. These two dumb dumbs, they have that real dumb way of speaking to, you know, he's, I'm your mom and you're my son and I if falling in love with him. And so I guess the story is this, my fucking lunatic woman gave this guy this kid up for adoption. Oh cool mom. And then they were reunited 20 years later. And then they fell in love. That's sweet. Wonderful Story.

Speaker 4:          00:19:05       I mean, and he talks real dumb like mom does. You can tell that they're related in that photo. Apple doesn't fall far from the stupid tree man. These two idiots. I mean, is there anything more repulsive? It's just like the gay man. So good. That's a, that's about 19 1991 logic. I mean, there you going to marry your dog. I think people still say crazy stuff. Yeah. I got to tell you, as a mom, as a mom, as a mom, I'm a mother and a wife that, and I'm also in show business. The thought of falling in love with my son. It's just not on the table. Why you have a father? What's wrong? The other day when we found this clip, you're like, well, what did it take for you to date your dad? I think you said, I'd rather you said something horrible. I'd rather like be drown or execute. I would literally rather die a slow, horrible death. The only way I would do it is if is if they were like Ellis. His life depends on this happening. I'd be like, absolutely. Like it's my son. But yeah, no, I do anything for that boy.

Speaker 4:          00:20:29       Look at this kiss and they both have teardrop tattoos, which is Kinda Nice. I'm pretty sure would you French or knows? Like I love my mom and she's like, I love you too. And like, and then we keep, here we go. Now I think I'm falling in love with, will you ever date your mom? And he said, well you did your son. And I said the honest truth. Yes I would. Oh cause uh, 19 years you're the best thing that ever happened to me and I really want to be with the rest of my life. I'm going to throw up. So can we talk so dumb.

Speaker 4:          00:21:02       Come you talk to him. Ah, wait for 19 years, it's the best thing that happened. Or why did you give him up for adoption there? I don't know. I mean, God, she's all kinds of fucked up. She asked him that, that ever important question asked them, will you ever date your mom? No. No. I asked to awesome. Awesome. When you everyday your mom. He was like, he's like, yeah, I was like a me too. US All. I all like, yeah. And then he's all like, yeah. And then we were all like, yeah, and then we kiss. Ask them, will you ever date your mom and say, well you did your son and I sit and honest truth. Yes. I would. Honest to goodness 19 years, you're the best thing that ever happened to me and I really want to be with the rest of my life. Yeah. Dummy. It's called having a child. You dumb. Fuck, I'll, could you imagine banging your head just no grow, not that little boy grows inside of you. You push him out of your, your meow and then you know, sex with one of your parents. It just like the gays.

Speaker 5:          00:22:09       The first approach was actually me. Oh. What happened was we were, we were hanging out and you know, just talking and all and just laughing. And I looked at her and she looked at me and I kissed her. Oh my God, here's a real quick,

Speaker 4:          00:22:24       it was a real case. Uq is was a real good cause or okay, here's the real cause. It's just like the gays. Yeah. Yeah. Damn it. These two. Oh Man. I don't know. You gotta stay in school, you know, that's what you took away from this guys. He's gotta go to fucking school. You know, you gotta study, you gotta you gotta not marry your mom and you got to not be like the gays. Yeah. All that fancy book, all that fancy book learning. Seriously though. Real talk word. What would it take for you to date? Charro I want to fucking hit you for even asking me such a disgusting thing. Oh, like, oh, so, and she likes like, Woo, I'm your mom. Would you ever date consider dating your mom? That's the question she asked him. I would like, uh, uh, what a beautiful courtship story too. One day I was like, would you ever date your mom? And then he was like, yeah, I want to do my mom who was a real kid cause or okay.

Speaker 4:          00:23:39       Sometimes I call him, he know Hito at that means son wants to know why he calls me mom. You know what I mean? Thank our cases about whether I have the right to love somebody and I sure as hell have the right to let Monica know it's not about whether you're the right to love somebody. You could definitely, you have the right to love your mother, right? I guess the courts are taking them to task and so they're like, why can't they just stay in their house and not telling anybody the weird by yourself, you have to marry somebody locally. Like why don't you just do your weird shit and keep it quiet? You're not going to fight for the right to marry your mom. I don't think society is going to get on board with that one guys. I don't think so either. Jesus just be goddamn weird at home.

Speaker 4:          00:24:20       Right. It's like it's like you always said, you know, you've always said no. No. You've always said, why? Why do you have to tell everyone? I'm proud to have come out as polyamorous and now I'm excited to share that I'm bisexual. I'm like, why you want to tell everybody? No, nobody needs to know. This guy was like, I told my parents over Thanksgiving dinner, and you're like, why? Why let them eat stuff and they don't need to know your 70 year old parents don't want to know who I'm poly and I'm bi. I'm Paula and I'm by dad, buddy. Hey, got to tell you something. I'm Paula and I'm by Pauley and I'm buying like they're old. They're old. They don't want it. They don't care. Or in this case like nobody cares. Well, it's disgusting. People care if you inform them, but no one cares if they don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:25:12       Fuck your mom. Go ahead and go fuck your mom with the doors closed. Shut the blinds. Retard. No one cares or weird shit on your own time. No, don't make it illegal now. Yeah. Well the thing is I have to marry her. Why? Well, they're dummies. They don't know how to shut the fuck up and just do what they gotta do. Not necessarily talk about it. Just like people to fucking animals and do all this weird stuff. You know, they stay in the shadows. It's, there's some things you got to keep in the shadow. Oh my God, you guys are so disgusting. It's so gross. It is so, so, so wait a minute. You don't want to go down on your mom. Oh my God. Shut up from that same suite vision that you came out of a really, you're, you're fucking, what about sucking on those? Ted does.

Speaker 4:          00:26:01       It's really gross. Moving on. So maybe you could drink milk again. So I should, uh, from those low hangers because swinging hangers, by the way, I want to thank everybody. I can't even really describe. I, you know, I've had a lot of fun on the road recently with like just being away from your family. The best part, that's the best part. But the second best part has been the shows. And I'm saying raw ball. Raul meet Charlotte friend men disco Jude or activities. Yeah, they've all been so fun. But my God, this weekend and fill up Delphia

I think it reminds me I am going to her city later in the year. Maybe I should bring him again. Yeah, that's a great idea. Maybe those two can spark up kind of a connection. Be a little love connection. Cause they start a connection last time. Well they certainly got, you know, they, there was a hello and a goodbye. I don't know if anything happened. I mean I don't, I don't hold his hand when we walk around and kiss. Uh, Josh is the one that turned us on to her snapchat. Josh turned me on

Speaker 1:          00:28:37       the whole story. Josh was the one who let it be known, uh, who she is and, and what exactly what was going on. The, the story of course was about, um, you know, her and a famous athlete. So, sure. He told me about that story and I was like, wait, what? And then he actually is the one who he, uh, he's the one that, that got me thinking about which position in football has the best captain worst cap assholes. Really? Yeah. And that's an ongoing conversation that we've had and we had it. Oh yeah, we had it. Even this, uh, this weekend in the car with the Uber driver was like,

Speaker 5:          00:29:21       who do you think has the worst? Kept a whole, you really got to understand football

Speaker 1:          00:29:26       to have a, an opinion. I'm just asking, can you just give me the top? Well we basically excluded everybody but Lineman, you know, so we have our top tier grade a assholes are like the quarterback diva receivers we decided are probably like just nice assholes like and very well kept clean and, oh no, sorry, I misunderstood. I thought you were talking about the best of the best are probably wide receivers, diva corners and quarterbacks, you know, like the best. Why do you think, uh, it's just, you know, that we, they just appeared to be guys that take a lot of pride in appearance. They take care of themselves physically. They're in great, phenomenal athletic shape. And, um, you know, they, they probably take care of everything including those rosy red assholes. So that was a conversation he and I had. And then it w it further got into, well then what would be the worst asshole. And that's where we, we have a difference of opinion cause I say offensive line and he says defensive line. But it's, it's an interesting theory that he presents. May I throw out something? Okay. Yeah sure, sure.

Speaker 4:          00:30:42       Have you considered, I just think that sometimes there they have white uniforms, those tight pants. And I think that those teams would have to keep the cleanest be holes. Oh just cause they have white. Yes. Because I can see everything when they bend over and I'm, we got the that widescreen TV. I see. I can see cheeks. They don't wear panties. They're not wearing panties. I can see I outlines of balls. So I think you can, you gotta be careful. Cause if the chocolate smears, if your wipe wipe, wipe wipe and you know, we to be careful by the way, I've had horrible dumps since we moved in here cause we don't have our wash. Let's installed and I've ha, I had disastrous bowel movements and I've had to shit to shower here. Well, it's like really have you really? Yeah, because I don't have a wash. Let the bad days not here yet. It's terrible.

Speaker 1:          00:31:40       Yeah. The wash that we got to get that hooked up. That's a, yeah, that's a priority. But I mean how disgusting was it to shit on the road without, uh, it's horrible every time. Like, do you think this guy's assholes growth? And let me just see what's what, what's this person's name?

Speaker 4:          00:31:55       Bj and he's got a 90. I'm going to say I wish I could see his hair situation because I feel like it. Does he have dreadlocks? No. No. Sometimes I feel like people with dreadlocks or extra dirty downstairs too. Yeah. That's just my bias. Then you feel that way. They're like, if your head smells then your asshole on your Coochie, you're going to stink like that too.

Speaker 1:          00:32:19       Could be maybe, I mean, I've heard people say that those are pretty bad smelling. Sometimes some drives where you think this guy smells like, I think his bee holes clean. Do you think this guy, wow, Christina was talking about Vince Wilfork right now, if you don't know who that is, you can look them up. But I think a lot of people would look at that and go, oh, that guy's ass holes a disaster. I, here's why I'm, he's his head

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       is clean shaven and he groomed his facial hair nicely. I think he takes pride in his appearance. And here's somebody who doesn't know anything about football and you're throwing a whole wrench in the game right now. Interesting. Yeah. Well sometimes it takes a fresh perspective on an old timeless problem. I'm wondering, um, let's see who we could probably look at that might change your opinion.

Speaker 1:          00:33:07       Um, right now, let's see. See is this guy, ah, let's say Barnes is he, he's uh, for the, okay. You played for the chiefs right now and see what this guy's ass, what do you think of his asshole thing? This guy's an asshole. Smells okay.

Speaker 4:          00:33:29       First of all, I think all of their assholes smell. I don't think there's a football player alive who's butthole doesn't. Yeah, he's dirty. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Cause he, you can tell he doesn't care about his face. Okay. Barnes while he's, he's got shared, like you said, it's groomed, you know? Yeah. But a man that maintains facial hair shape, that's a guy that cares that his appearance in general. But if you're just clean shaven it's like, well there's effort but not as much effort. Okay. Okay. Um, let me, let me pull up. You put a lot of effort into maintaining your beard, right? That's true. And over the years I've civilized you to care about your be whole cleanliness and your body cleanliness, you know? Yeah. Although every now and then you do slip up and you'll fly home after a long weekend of shows not showered and then demand that I orally pleasure you and I'll be like to have you showered in the last 24 hours or is this your swamp nuts from your flight and then everyone makes mistakes.

Speaker 4:          00:34:32       Yeah. Okay. Who is this guy? He's disgusting. He's disgusting. This is Cody Wickman. Now he's a pig. The uh, now what makes you say that? It looks like a real nice smile. Know that facial hair is bad. Facial hair for 30 guy facial hair. He's got just the chin cover. The shaggy. Yeah. The uh, the one, one quarter of a goatee. It's, it's gross. I'm not, I'm not, he's six, five, 320 pounds. He's a little boy. Six Five, three 20 says tiny little sweep muffin. I see what you're doing now. He's a very, he's a dirt bag. Yeah. You think so? How about um, well my pain Manning, Eli Manning. Peyton manning. Eli. Well, you know what they look like. What do you think Eli is? Retired or Peyton Peyton's. I love pay it. Can I tell you that? I love his commercials. I think he's so funny. Like he's, yeah, he's actually really funny. He is funny. His timing's great. Yeah. He's a funny dude. Those guys are clean. I think Greg's clean. Do you think Greg Robinson? Yeah. Clean left tackle for our Los Angeles Rams. Six five three 32. It's sweaty, but he works hard at maintaining his eye. He

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       looked why? What you just read. Do they live in this city? We probably could get some of these guys in here and get their take on this whole perspective. What a neat idea. I'll be your asshole. How and who's got the dirtiest asshole on the La Rams? Well that's, I mean, come on. It's going to take us a while to figure out, but I don't know if someone's listening and you're in the La Rams. We'll look. I just showed you a couple offensive guys. You said one was was really gross. Um, so let me give you a big, a big defensive linemen. This maybe you're not even following a silly, but do you think this his ass smells bad? Hideous, so maybe terrible. Maybe you're on Joshua's. Maybe. See, cause you don't really know what the position was. No idea. But she was looking at, uh, Michael Brocker is right now.

Speaker 1:          00:36:22       He's a mass. Why the facial hair is all a mess. But see, he look how groomed though because it's too bushy. But see, he's not, there's a lot of attention to that though. That doesn't just happen. It's not a good, but somebody faded that down. Yeah. But I think it needs to be made. The maintenance is not there. He see Josh, his theory is that the aggression with which this position has played. In other words, these guys are chasing after the guy with the ball. Yeah. Leads to a funky or dirty or asshole. Interesting. You know, it's an interesting, you have to really understand football too. I don't get the nuances, but that's what, that's part of why he thinks he's, neither. One of us talked about facial hair. Interesting. Going on aesthetics alone and Michael Bloggers. We want to smell your asshole. Micheal Brecker's. I liked that name.

Speaker 1:          00:37:15       Michael Brocker dirty and disgusting. That guy's going gonna fuck you Michael. Oh, I think so too. And if you don't want to too bad, cause he has six, five, three 26 God. Yeah. Michael is a little fucking hold. You realize these, these last five guys that showed you, it would make me look like a child. That's crazy. Their meat and cheese. Oof. All meat and cheese. Big Ole fucks. I think our son's going to be big like that. I Dunno about like that. He's a big boy. Our son's almost a year old. He wears, um, 18 month and up clothing. She's a pick guy. He's, yeah, he's a big man. All right. Um, oh, I wanted to show you this. This came in. It's pretty great.

They're so cute. And the, the teacher, the woman with this is our first female. She's like improvising to adding all kinds of shit. So good. Oh my God. That was amazing.

Speaker 4:          00:40:22       Oh my gosh, I can't, I can't believe this. I know. This is truly an international and this isn't like, um, like an American teaching abroad. This is an Indian woman who I'm assuming listens to the show and then this is amazing. Wow. I'm blown away. I'm blown away. Thank you for this. So, uh, Sean, the uh, the Indian edition. Wow. Look at the children of Kolkata. Oh. Um, he did it so that they don't suffer the same fate as burnt. Uh, and then Chris wrote to us, I moved to Japan to teach English. I remember specifically that Mommy, Tina Aka water champion. Thank you. Asked for a video from Japan. So I made one for her. I Hope Mommy Bonds, Aka Ivs champion will enjoy this too. That is from Chris. Let's, uh, let's see what else is in the, uh, Burt is being shamed in Calcutta now. Oh my God. And we've had this, how many foreign language ones have we had already? It's count countless. It's, yeah, it's just, yeah,

Speaker 7:          00:41:26       you may love Commedia itchy. Both. How? Comedian number one fat community.

Speaker 6:          00:41:37       Oh my God. Is He, why does he meet that? He yes, he goes, okay. Yeah. So he goes eating and you're right. He goes eating with another fast friends is friend is bad, but he is number one back.

Speaker 5:          00:42:08       He's explaining it. Adorable little Japanese child. This is so fun. Think my favorite thing. God. This is hilarious. Teachers with kids talking about fat bird. It's my baby,

Speaker 6:          00:42:17       right? Is he fat? Is he fat? Yes. Very good. Very good.

Speaker 5:          00:42:29       Oh my God. He's amazing. Chris had the kids draw pictures of her.

Speaker 8:          00:42:37       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:42:37       these are fantastic. These are wonderful pictures. Yeah, it looks like big titties on Burt Burt's wearing a diaper and this one. Yep. It looks like Santa Claus. And this was so good. Yeah. Here's a bird in a speedo. Okay, let's right, right. Wow. I'm so impressed. I cannot believe a, so here's the thing, Burton, I have a weight loss competition going now, right? Really real now, right? Just as the holidays come to. Oh my God, it'd be tricky. Um, so we have a new side bet going. Okay. So the big bet is that whoever's lower has to take the other comedian, the other friend. And for some reason Ari Ari get injected himself when these old is William do it cause he was the driving force, he said behind it. Okay. Um, so the other, the other, the loser, the guy who weighs more has to take the two other people to like some desirable event.

Speaker 5:          00:43:38       A concert at the staples center. Yeah. Event. And it can be in another city. So it could be like I want to go to the Superbowl and it's like, do you got to take everybody? Okay, we have a new side bet. And it made it really real because the thing is that's a costly endeavor. So I'd like Burke to spend that money of course. So we need to slim me down. Yeah, I got a win. Yeah. The new side bet is that the loser has to shave his beard. Oh my gosh. Yeah. And then you can see exactly how fast it goes or is there's a fat cover up. It's been a long time. I know both of you and Bert have had beards for years. For a while. And I was looking at this photo we have above the US back to back here.

Speaker 5:          00:44:20       We took this at Sears a few years ago. Yeah. Look how thin your beard was. Yeah. It doesn't look good when it's thin. I know. It looks good. Bushey yeah. So I haven't seen your face and I don't, I can't remember what about a full shave. Yeah. Yeah. I don't remember the last time that you'd done that. So I, when I, I texted him that I go, how much anxiety just that give you, and he's like so, so, so much, so much. And then he sent me a picture of him at some press event like years ago without a beard. And I was like, Ooh, terrible. Oh well it's just what he goes. And he goes, when I waste so much less than this photo, I can't even picture Burt without a beard. I've, I know ever known him with a beard. I've seen him without it a while. But you know, I'm kind of banking on a couple things.

Speaker 5:          00:45:04       First of all, you know, I've been working out a lot. Yeah. Been eating well. Your stomach is almost gone. But the other thing I'm banking on is his gluttonous lifestyle and it's the holidays. And guess what? December I'm home and he's on the road every week. Forget it, forget it here, here's the variable that's going to mass with Bert, the party life cause he's the life of the party when he's on the road, it's booze, booze, booze, every night eating it, two in the morning and then sleeping and waking up and doing it all over again. I mean, I want to win for a lot of reasons, but I also think I have that in my favor because yeah, I don't have to get to like a crazy number to win this. I think if I just get ahead and, and then, you know, just stay, stay working out the way less than bird, right when yes, it could be.

Speaker 5:          00:45:56       Yes. Okay. Um, but you know, I think that, I don't think he'll be able to dial it back. Not during the holidays. We know that because everyone parties in the holidays, he's renovating the house. They all live in the same room right now. He's stressed out all the time. So when he is home, he wants to drink. When he's on the road, he's going to party. He wants to party. He's going to party. Yeah. So where were you guys the last time we weighed in? Who was ahead? Who was behind? Well, it's funny. So when we weighed w when I weighed in with him on Ari's podcasts, I was two 42 and he said it was two 40 bullshit. And I go, okay. And then he, uh, he texted me like a week later, he goes, oh, slowing. Of course.

Speaker 5:          00:46:43       So actually I haven't had started off, of course, you way less than him, but you know, a lot of people came up to me and fill her up and they were like, you know, you're, you're smaller than I saw it last time. Yeah. I think you're going to beat Bart. I got a lot of people pulling for me on this and he's got his, he, you know, he has loser, like the people that into him. So there'll be on his side. But like, you know, I think, uh, I think, I really think if I stay, I think December is going to be a big month for me with, um, home virtually the entire month. Get on the routine. Yup. Properly. You're, you're, you've got my support and that we're on, I'm on primal Kido. We're there. We're, we're maintaining. Yeah. Now you're, you're going to kick his ass jeans.

Speaker 5:          00:47:26       I think so. Of course you're going to kick his ass. And I think that those, those, those road days he has coming up. Yeah. The thing about it is what actually happens is the booze. What happens when you drink a lot of booze? It leads to more food eating. Yeah. Yeah. So I think his days are fine. It's just that when the, when he starts boozing it up, yeah. He's then going to need to fill up the stomach with the alcohol. Yeah. And don't forget alcohol itself is, yeah, it's sugar. Oh, sure. That's a lot of calories. Yeah. You're, you're talking, that's your daily caloric intake. How much he drinks. Oh yeah. It's, I'm not Burt's and alcoholic, so we're doing, you know, we've got a real thing going on. Say saying that real talk in order for Bert to defeat you. Yeah. He would have to stop drinking.

Speaker 5:          00:48:11       Right. In which case, yeah, he could. And that was his big, if that was his big goal, he could do it, you know, cause he's just like the gays, you gotta you know, it's just like the gays. Yeah. Jesus. What a couple of knuckleheads. Huh? So anyways, that's our new side bet. The Shave, the shave to me is way worser then the sporting event. Oh my God. Cause that's just money. But yeah, this is like, that's embarrassing. It's embarrassing. And if I were to do it, that means I would go to I think Kansas City with a fully shaved face. Well, the good thing for you is that your beard grows back so fast. It grows back so fast, but it would be shaved for longer than you think it would. Uh, it would take to the end of the month to start looking like myself again.

Speaker 5:          00:49:02       I wish you guys would shave your heads too. That would make me laugh. I'm going to get a haircut on Wednesday. Oh, go on Allen. Oh, hi. Oh, hi again. A common, that was boy. Oh, okay. I can't wait for TG jeans. Did you use a lot of fun? We're gonna to make a feast. I've decided to cook full American thanksgiving because we haven't done it and ears. Just as we wrap up, weight loss talk, you're like, yeah, I'm going to make a fucking feast. Ummah. I got us a smoked Turkey from honeybaked ham and I got us a honey baked ham and then I'm going to do green bean casserole. Sweet potatoes. Yup. I'm going to do, I'll do Mac and cheese. A omics, omics, Pumpkin Pie. One day you can fall off the wagon for one day. Yeah. You know, but you know what the funny thing is the leftovers. I'll just give them to Sarah. She's coming over. The funny thing about when you start eating healthy or like sticking to something you like, don't even really want no to that stuff. It's a total bummer. Yeah. What do you look at for motivation?

Speaker 9:          00:50:06       I'm mixed flow. I live in North Carolina and I'm aware of model meet Nikki, otherwise known as ms flow. I think the name is flo cause I thought it was killed and I flat fee.

Wait, I mean this is like, of course, you know a doctor would be like, we need to hospitalize you. Of course. Know something is mentally wrong with this person. She's like, I'm a web model.

Speaker 4:          00:51:42       I'll carry it there.

Speaker 5:          00:51:48       You've got a lesion and salt. I don't believe, by the way, I don't believe that she believes she's doing. I believe that she does the cell. You know she can sell it, but no, she knows she's a disaster. She's turning the negative into a positive, but I don't buy it either. I just love myself like, no you don't.

Speaker 9:          00:53:26       hard cash is 1599 for 30 days subscription and you know, you could see the pictures, videos and all, all that good stuff. But I have had was to do a fart in BDO. This is the one fan told me, he was like, I'll pay you $5 a fart and I need response on them. So he said, I will give you $100 if you could just make a couple farts. Ought to be. I was like, you know what, that's not really my thing.

Speaker 5:          00:54:00       This is good. This bitch has it all figured out. Here we are working for a living. He's got a Fart in a Web Clark far. I can't believe how dare she. She did it. She can't turn down $100 for a couple of farts. Come on man. I would do that.

Speaker 9:          00:54:18       Ooh.

Speaker 5:          00:54:23       $400 for a couple of farts. Would I do it? Yeah, you. Of course I would do it. We do them for free on this shit. Yeah. I tried to Fart on Mike all the time. I had a big fart before we were rolling. We got to get those fart mix. Yeah. Get the card, making them out of it. Making sure the nanny's not texting us. Maybe we'll do, um, I think we should do a show where we have some meal before. It'll create a lot of parts. I just made some Chili, I feel like, but you got to time it right. There was that Peruvian joint on the east side, Don Felix, where we had Lomo site though. Yeah. And it would give me so many farts. Interesting. I've never heard you say that before. Why? Why is something about it was like there was some type of oiliness to the way that they made it there where whenever I ate it for dinner the next morning I'd be in bed like mom prom. So maybe we need to have that one day and Brussel sprouts make me Fart a lot. Oh yeah, that'll do it. Collywobbles but it's a timing issue because for me it takes a few hours. Well that's the thing is we're going to have to really work on this, you know? But that's what scientists do. I mean, you know, trial and error, it keep trying to get it right. Did I get it wrong? Right. It's important for the listeners, for sure. For a damn. She is so fucking, she's an enormous person. Jesus Christ. Normous good. Laura.

Speaker 9:          00:55:57       She's a made good money because you can show, right or you can charge on one thing is they will put it on your website. So it would be like double that they, but when I do special quizzes videos, I don't really put it on my website. I kind of let it be like you're a private gifts to you. You know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          00:56:17       Do you think she's going to marry her mom soon? She talks about, was it just like the gays? She's about as bright as the, uh, the mom and son team that open mouth like you good judge and she was out of breath right there. I know. She's just sitting there putting on a show. This poor woman. I actually, I mean she needs to go to the hospital. She needs a surgery. Yes.

Speaker 9:          00:56:41       Why do you think people like to see you trying on clothes that are too small? What does it do? Mix the losing of me. Maybe even more enormous that I am. I like it too though. I like to hear the sound, ah, putting shirt. Now the question is how am I going to, uh, but the point is what kind of Gig? The incredible hall.

Speaker 5:          00:57:27       What kind of Gig could she have? Like, you know what I'm saying? No. Just making the best of her horrific situation. Like if she, she can't really work in an office because, you know, yeah. But she should, I mean, I get it, but she needs to work on staying alive. You know, she's past the point of like, ah, uh, if if she were a couple hundred pounds less, yeah. Doing this site, I'd be like, oh, okay. I get, but right now, like she looks like she's going to die. Yeah. She's killing herself with food. Yeah. He's just not a good thing.

Speaker 9:          00:57:57       I'm a food whore. I like expensive, nice phone. See Food and it's this band cause I don't,

Speaker 5:          00:58:08       oh my God, she's eating, she's eating a watermelon and she's topless in bed. Yeah. She's eating a water man. You don't see that all the time, but everybody likes food. You just have to be like, hey, I can't eat. Part of the illusion though, when you're fat, but the denial is you go like, oh, I like food. I like it so much. It's my thing. The reason other people aren't like this, right. They don't like it as much as I do. Right, right. You just, yeah. You know what I noticed with being on this diet thing is that I would, I would make food a prize for something, like a reward. Like, oh, I had such a bad day, but I'm going to reward myself with cookies. Or like the reward can't be food. Right. It can't be the emotional outlet. Like I'm, I'm lonely. I'm just going to eat something.

Speaker 5:          00:58:54       And that's totally what I did. Yeah. The other thing is like the mindfulness, you know, of going, of reaching for food. But if you stop and you go, am I eating this cause I'm hungry, right. Or am I eating this because I'm just trying to like, uh, Phil, you know, fill this a moment of feeling nervousness or anxiety, you know, instead of smoking a cigarette, I'm going to, yeah, yeah. This thing, wherever he is, smoker, quits, gains weight always. Some of them gained incredible. Yeah. But I've seen people put on 50, 60 pounds. 80 pounds. Yeah. And you can see it how, I'm sorry, I was just drinking water because I'm the champion. Yeah, you can. Where's your water? I'm interested in the cameras aren't rolling. Yeah, but where's your water? I'm just curious. What are you talking about and let them right here. Let me hear you take us up.

Speaker 5:          00:59:45       Oh, you're such a faker. You're drinking your imaginary water. No drinking water. I have water right here. Okay. Um, I forgot, even when I was saying, I don't fucking know. The point is it's, it can't be an emotional thing. No, that's a problem. Yeah. As with anything, it's hard not to have addictions, alcohol, cigarettes, food. It's just an easy thing, you know? Yeah. It's, it's tough. It is tough. It's hard to be a vice free sober, essentially. I mean, and you know, and I, yeah, cause food is, is uh, isn't it? Addiction thing. Everything. Yeah. Sex, gambling, alive fruit. Shake it for me. I think I eat, she can't lie. You don't know how much I eat. Do you eat fried chicken from a seeking something? Just fried one pool. She, if she just had like chicken breasts, she would not be this fat. Yeah. No, of course not. No. She's eating like the buckets, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:00:48       Oh yeah. Oh No. And I was like, would you ever day your mom? Hmm? He's like, yeah, I will do my mom. Oh, Tom, let's do the scene. Okay. I'll be your mom. Okay. So like would you ever consider dating or mom? And I was like, uh, yeah. I mean I liked her and I was like, do you like me to, yeah. Uh, sometimes I call you like my son or one of Quito, but not all the time because you're my son. I wanted to make sexes with you and like I made the first move. Uh, I was like, what's up? And she was like, hey. And I gave her a kiss. It was like a real case, but it was like a real kiss. Huh. But it's like, what's the big deal? I mean, just like the gays, you know, over 18 is like oil. It's a big deal. You know, it's a big deal. I love my mom cause they were okay. It was, it was it just like the gays for um, a lot of good drops on today's. Yeah. Some good stuff in here. Far and far, eh, so we got an email here, dad accents. Hi, Mommy's in episode three 69, master of accents and water. Mommy. Tommy

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       talked about how top dog would speak to Peruvian family members in English the same way they would speak English. I thought you might find it interesting that my dad, a white CIS gender man does exactly the same thing with Asian people. My Dad makes toys for a living, so growing up he was in China a lot and he's traveled to many Asian countries as well as many other parts of the world. You would think a well traveled mommy such as himself would be respectful of the cultures and dialects. He as it was exposed to, well within the last few years, he started doing this really neat thing or he speaks to Asian people at restaurants with broken English, things like this. Good right? Or food comes soon.

Speaker 1:          01:03:04       He's also gone as far as to ask people in a Korean restaurant, what part China you from? It warms my jeans to hear that the legendary top dog does the same thing and that our dads have something really neat and common. Hope you want me to have a stress remove? I'll see Tom on December 30th mom, Lando, Bo through that is so fucking funny. I like that. It's so amazing. The Broken, oh my God. It's such a fucking dad move. And he does. My Dad does it like, it's so embarrassing. And he's like, what? Why neato neato because he doesn't do, he can't, he can't do any like correct Spanish like Juanito today. And you enjoy the very nice no, the museum. No. And they're like, see, I had a good time. Yes. Tomorrow maybe you'd like, we go a very good place to eat. And they're like, okay. Do like, why are you talking to him retarded? Because that doesn't help him learn English better. Oh, this good. Right. Food comes soon.

Speaker 1:          01:04:20       That is fucking such a dad. Um, mazing God damn boy, I got to fucking figure out a way to incorporate this in a more, it's so fucking funny. I love that he does that. I really love it. I wish we could get a recording of your dad doing this to someone. Does he do it in restaurants to your dad? Oh yeah. No. But if, if anyone, if there's another culture, especially Latin, I think it's like he's saying his dad spends a lot of times and a lot of time in Asian countries, it's the, it's the foreign culture you're most associate comfortable with that you do it to the most. So my dad would do it probably two more Spanish speaking people. Right? So if someone was Spanish, he would, he would start speaking retarded English stuff that a Spanish version would speak and this guy does it to Asian people, which is just outstanding. These good, right. These are good. Will come soon.

Speaker 1:          01:05:28       Oh, I can imagine too that those people are always like, why is that guys speaking? Talking day that I imagine my cousins too would probably like of everyone I spoke to today, only he talked to me about that person. Yeah, because I never ever was like, you like school fun today? No. Oh my God. Now you slow it down for a foreigner. Right. You know, you speak slowly. I'm a listener. Wrote this and hey Tom, wake up. Dan Pena is trying to bang your wife. No, please.

At first seems really simple because most people think you're just getting on all fours, waddling around and going more for, for the buck buck. But it's really so much more complicated.

Speaker 1:          01:18:14       So there are people that are wearing puppy or dog zip, like leather zip ups, like s and m dog masks and they're on their hands and knees. Yeah. This guy had them in a cage. You had him in a crate now and he's describing that it's not just about, yeah,

Speaker 13:         01:20:07       pup play gives me, oh recreation, you gotta be fucking Shit that we all have animalistic passions as humans. We are sexual adults and my animal just happens to be a bit more German shepherd.

Speaker 4:          01:20:21       This is insane. This is a general physician. I know it's usually professional people that have high stress jobs that like s and m in this stuff, but how so? How are they fucking each other? Cause they're in full body latex costumes and they did they unzip their dicks and then fuck each other's butts? I don't know how this works. I don't know. I really don't know.

Speaker 12:         01:20:41       Uh, what draws me to human pup play is I like the gear. I like the, the lifestyle of it all just makes me feel like I am 10 foot tall and bulletproof. No, he's mechanic. Just physical. There is emotion. Having a, hold on, I get to go to my secret persona where I have no human inhibitions that suits reframe.

Speaker 4:          01:21:05       Yeah. It's so alarming to me. This is like more bothersome than the woman marrying her son. No, that's not true. Well, it's just like the way they talk about it, it was like, it makes my, it makes my ass, I'll put her to, yeah. The thing is, is like I envy that these people are so in touch with their feelings that they can find something like, I am so shut off from how I feel that I could never be like, you know, what secret are you? Are you that shut off? And I just want to be a dog and latex. No, but I'm saying that I'm so shut off. Like I might love this. Oh, right. Because of who I am. I'm so quick to be like, fuck you, you fucking asshole. Oh right. But I wouldn't even be open emotionally cause he's right. Like think about it. The argument is during the day, I'm this helpless car mechanic, but when I put on my puppy play costume, I get to be a dog with no human inhibition. So it's his channel of freedom. Yeah. But I'm so fucking uptight and judgmental. I could never get there. Sure. I could never get there.

Speaker 12:         01:22:07       Mahjong wouldn't say it's a specific breed as such terms of the personality that it has. It's a very loyal to see these people. This is something I'm a little bit of social anxiety. I see. Wearing the popcorn's allows a bit of anonymity, so it means that I can interact with people and not be so concerned as to what they're thinking of me.

Speaker 4:          01:22:26       Uh Huh. Okay.

Speaker 12:         01:22:28       I didn't go into human pup play for the six part of it. The cell phone and things. Oh, I've had sex with anyone in puffier. It doesn't just involve men.
