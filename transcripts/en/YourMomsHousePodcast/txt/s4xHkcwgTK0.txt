Speaker 6:          00:06:19       Nope.

Speaker 1:          00:06:24       In the green room and Bray a couple of weeks ago, Josh potters with me and one of the servers came in and she, we were, the TV was on, I think tiger was playing and started talking about like member his, how, how fucking on top of the world he was. Then we started talking about how Tiger Tiger fucking dumb name is tiger. I know that a few times, but you hear it and you're like, okay, well that's Brendan Schaub son's name is tiger. Yeah, it is. Yes it is. Sorry Brennan.

Speaker 6:          00:06:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:00       And, and in this case it's a nickname in Brendan's. It's his real name. Great Name. Did I say so? Uh, so when tiger was on top of the world, it's like just how on top of it he was. Yeah. And then he, he had all these hoes on the side like so many hoes. Right. And we were just talking about, you know, imagine, well just like how backed up he was, what it was, we're pressing to act out in the way he was acting out and we can't wait to throat fucking ass. Weird. Pretty crazy stuff cause he was a pretty buttoned up. He is a pretty buttoned up guy. Well yeah I mean golf in general like that, that image is real straight laced. I'm going to throw fuck the shit out of this horror right now. No, I mean John Daly was the only guy who was openly like that.

Speaker 1:          00:07:48       But I mean he also had like some real problems and he also was never nearly as good as tiger is. Like the best thing we've ever seen. Just dominant. Started it like two years old and he was dominant though. I mean just kicking people's ass every week in this thing. A lot love, big time. Big Time Golfers. They'll have, you know, a few big wins in their career where they're competing every week. But like, you know, having like all these majors like week after week, just crushing people. Anyway, we're talking about this about imagine them being one of those girls and you know he's throwing you cash on the side and some of them are cool with the arrangements. Some of them probably like a lot of times with these things start to get like how come I'm not like the main girl, you know? And he had too many going on to it yet.

Speaker 1:          00:08:34       No one wants to be second or third place, not real. And he's just like don't fucking make eye contact if you see me in the hotel because he had those like arrangements like I know, you know he would arrange the hotel through one of his buddies or you know his handlers. But also it was like, you know, make sure no one, you don't me in the lobby. Okay. Cause he's tiger. So he gets to maintain all this make sense. If you're the Ho like that's your job is to be, if you're a good whoa, you're supposed to be like of course. But what happened was, I think he started to get, some of them were like, wow, you know, they're also around somebody who's so like so famous and so rich. I think they started, some of them started to get like, I want one more.

Speaker 1:          00:09:21       Where's my stuff? Yeah, I want some stuff. I want some stuff too. Anyway, then we started talking about, uh, other well known people and I'm like, this is like, oh, Jay. Not even like, I know. I imagine Oj, you know, approaching, you now be like, hey, how you doing sweetie? And you're like, Hi, if I'm 20 years old and don't, and 1994 never happened. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:26       Yeah, that's what I do. She was found not guilty. Right? Sure. But a lot of people, I don't know, a lot of people wait was she's dead Casey. Anthony's dead. No, she's not dead, right? I don't know. No, no, no, no. Okay. So anyways, she was charged and she was, I think she was found not guilty. Yeah. It was found like the, the verdict was greeted with public outrage. But anyways, people fucking love, uh, some people like love this woman and they really, you know, like she's, she's cuter than I guess, you know, most people you find charged with crimes, like she doesn't look like I'm Eileen, Eileen Warner who's craziest shit like a man. And she's like, yeah, she's a cutie. So imagine, let's see if, uh, if there's, is there 2018 images of her now? Oh boy doesn't, well, she's not in prison. Oh, she's hot. Looks good. She looks great. Um, but imagine we're like, like this one right here. Yeah. This picture of her, you meet her, you go out on a date with her, right. Maybe you meet her at the vet's office. See, she's carrying her dog groomer here and you're like, oh, I got a dog too. And you go out with Casey, you go out on a date. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Great time on your date. And then you have drinks afterwards and you're back at her place. Yeah. You start making out. Things start to go further.

Speaker 1:          00:12:10       Things start to go further. And then she unbuckles your pants. She goes down on you and she starts giving you the blow job, a blow job. I mean, she's spitting on your balls, right? She's gagging on, you're Dong, she's licking under your balls, like Kinda toying with your asshole. And you're like, wow.

Similar, yeah. Similar. Similar and he drives you to like a kind of an east Hollywood apartment. You're like, ah, okay. Ah, Brenton was overrated, you know, and then he takes you up there. Starts like Tony doing like just kind of grown like you're kind of young. He's doing grown man tricks on you. You know like just advanced moves like Kinda Rocco stuff. Like maybe he's, you know what I mean? Like pension, your test law. And then he started hitching my tits of hard. He's like,

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       is that, that's your varsity side short. Well it is what it comes from like an older guy like that German guy we play cause like.com this watch this.

He, yeah, he's nipples need to be go down on you a kills it and you're just begging for it. He gets into you, he starts just railing you and you're like, oh my God.

And he's like, I slipped both of them. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:15:42       Yeah. That's an interesting story. That's a neat idea. I try and stuff for like I, yeah, I mean, I don't know that this is such a funny idea that I'm wiping tears away. I'm not sure it's a tier wiper. Like I see kind of why I technically, it's funny, but it's not, it doesn't get me the way. Well, this is my version of these guys show, right? So you want to finish that guys joke. Oh yeah. Let's see what the, the bear says. The bartender says yes to get clear, walks into a restaurant and says, I like a groove cheese. What's with the big pause? The bar tender ask. That's the joke. Joke. My parent doesn't even have a double closing. Did you get that? I get the grilled cheese. I've heard it,

Speaker 5:          00:16:53       yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:16:56       Oh, you know what? Maybe he didn't tell the joke. Right. I would like a grilled cheese. What's with the big pause? I'm a bear paws. P A u. S e p. Aws. Is that a joke? Because I'm like, wait, that's not even a dry. So he said, I'll uh, I'll have a grilled cheese. Right. But he didn't tell the joke properly. Right. That's exactly what my dad would do. Exactly right. You would miss the point of the joke. The whole timing of it. Yeah. Yeah. What joy number when we called my dad and we'd go outside though.

Speaker 5:          00:17:34       Oh my God, I love it. I love those jokes. Oh, I got a whole bunch. Okay,

Speaker 4:          00:17:46       so how can you tell a blonde has been using your computer?

Speaker 5:          00:17:53       I don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:17:54       There's whiteout all over the Monitor.

Speaker 5:          00:18:01       I got one for you too. Okay, go, go ahead. Go ahead. Okay. This lot is sitting at a bar in Chicago watching the, yeah, the one of these bars where they had the TV behind the bar and some guy up on the ledge and getting ready to jump. So this, this guy sat next to her and he says to her, it's too wordy already. This is the six o'clock news. And uh, he says, uh, I bet you he jumps and the bond says, I bet you your drink. He doesn't. And all of a sudden, okay, the guy jumps. And so the, the guys at the blind is, I guess you owe your $20. And he said, no, that was for a drink and we can't take the money cause I saw it on the five o'clock news and the blinds this. So did I. But I thought he might change his mind. I think that's hilarious.

Speaker 4:          00:19:02       Let's see. It was, it's so poorly told. Well there's, it's too wordy. The setup was too convoluted. It's, I was like, and this is the six o'clock news, like, no, it'd be like, okay, a blonde and an guy. We're sitting at the bar watching the six o'clock news. Yeah. The door. You can I say about the time and then have the punch be like, I saw the slide earlier time. Right. You know, there's a lot of ways to tell that joke efficiently. Yeah. He did not. Um, you know what's funny about your father is that he, um, he's kind of an old school kind of dude and he loves to point out that I'm a woman constantly. Oh yeah. Like I'm not really sure know, Christina, we were watching your special on Netflix and I think what people like the most is that you're a woman telling me jokes and these things like, yeah. Yeah. So any loves to make fun of me being blonde in California. [inaudible] loves it. Loves it. Yeah. I mean, this shit is just

Speaker 5:          00:20:01       my God.

Speaker 4:          00:20:05       See, I think Nice Casey has any Oj stuff's way funnier. Right? Try It, try it on a crowd to see if they think it's funnier. I think we'll get feedback just from this. I a million a million cycles are going to write in and say how wrong I am and how brilliant that is. I know, I know. How wrong you. Oh yeah. They always side with the psychopath. Tom. Christina has just the squared. Tom's Tom's right. That's your whole psycho squad of, of people. Yeah. You know, these are the same derelict to buy the shirts that I don't think are great. Do you wanna know something amazing? This is, this is how good God is. God is good

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       all the time. I'm too blessed to be straight. How, how good is God right now? This was completely unplanned. She had no idea. None. I didn't tell her, but I didn't prep you on this. No, you just bring that up. Added to the store. Oh, less than an hour ago. Oh, what is it this time? The piss on me featuring my face, your mouth open and some tears. Um, Geez, this Tom, this is a presale right now. This is the image that was on my Instagram that did so well. Um, that we, uh, everyone was like, puts us on a shirt. I was like, okay, so great. Yeah, this was a, I wonder how many people are going to want piss on me and beat me. It was like beard at guy's mouth open on their chests, but you know, uh, a judge that kind of a thing. X h h creative x as a 22 year old artists who made this.

Speaker 1:          00:21:43       Um, by the way, I also, it's not for sale yet, but I also send the design to our sock guy, so hopefully there'll be some piss on me. Beat me socks. It's exciting. When's the FTT Rit? Well this is all you're throwing all that at first. Good tongue replaces that Dick. Somebody feel like they crack the code here. Hey, I crack the FCT RTD code high Hitler. I became fascinated with the puzzle presented to the y community. I think I have solved it. Um, I took to the streets. We can walk around pronouncing FTD Archie phonetically making eye contact with each person. I pass in hopes of assistance for inspiration. I got some dirty looks from some zooms herbs with blue hair. You're, they thought it wasn't up to the task, but I did not let just disheartened meat. By the time I got home, I remembered my past relationship with a Jewish woman and drew from the letter number association in the Hebrew language.

Speaker 1:          00:22:43       So I made the chart of the English alphabet a to Z, counting from one to 26 signing each letter, a numerical value FTT RTD added together is 75 the value of the acronym. Why am h got me 46 and the P for podcasts yields 57 seeing that the sum of FTT RTP was the reverse of the sum. Why Mhp was all the proof I needed, that this was indeed a high level puzzle orchestrated by the main mommies. Reinvigorated I press on, I solve for the value is [inaudible] 79 and mommy's 86 knowing that these would surely come into play, I saw I was all I needed to solve the riddles. Crazy. So now with the number, the numerical values associated with each one, you have to solve the problem. Mommies minus FGD RTD equals 1111 is the value of p. So adding 11 to why match gives you 68. Subtracting 11 also gets you 68. Jesus Christ. Now, I have demonstrated irrefutably that the relationship

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       between FTT RTD and mommies. Oh my God, this is a lot you guys. Yeah. Anyway, I can't even keep reading and design added the lexicon. We shouldn't be lean furniture as FTT RTDs in the same vein as mommy genes. Okay. So he's saying we should just, he found that relationship betweenF , g t R tds and the word mommies. Yeah, you solved it. It's not an acronym, but a word to be spoken as its own entity. Gotcha. I like that. We can call each other FTT. RTDS is really great for us. The tongue places that deck, uh, this won't be the person for great times. Rub that Dick Tea Rtd. Uh, Bert is definitely FCT RTD. Want to go for it? Go for it. Go for it. That guy, too retarded to die.

Speaker 4:          00:24:45       Uh, for good time. Right to dean, because that girl to ride the Dick. Fuck gays and ripe the death. I don't think so. Okay. Wow. People keep and then look at this amat amazing, uh, Seagal. FTT Rtd image created by Evan. Amazing. That's great. What song on his neck there as this neck fat. There's just nothing that he's wearing. One of his Asian, you know, it's a great portrait. His eyes and his mouth are so small, so fat. He's so fat. Uh, looks good. It's a great image. Thank you. Haven't, um, yeah, so, you know, we were sharing the other day, whereas a chording stories made me laugh.

Speaker 4:          00:25:43       Fat guys losing weight too. Retarded dating. Would you ever date and are worded person? I'm sorry, what? Would you ever date and are worded person? No. Okay. Why not? Or would you, would you hook up with and are worded, but what if she's super hot, babe? Just listen. Hear me out. What if she's so fucking hot? He's everything. You want big, all sloppy titties. Tiny ways. But donk, donk gotta be so retarded. But why? But why not do I mean, is it wrong for a normal person to hook up with an are worded? Yes, of course they need light. They like doing it too though. I know, but you have a, it's like I'll get up with a drunk person, you know, it's like you have too many uh, advantages over them. Like you don't know that they can say no, you're just, you're, you're intellectually superior.

Speaker 4:          00:26:48       You know, you, you, you can't do that. Okay. I mean, but what if they're super hot? Well really it's about what level of disability someone has for this type of thing. Right. Good point. So if somebody is, I mean let's see, some like a little bit slower than you. You could a little slow. Well that happens all the time. Right? And marriages, we've seen it. Sure. I'm going to go where you live it and then, then there's a, but then there's something where it's definitely, yeah, I hear it. It is a bit like taking advantage of an innocent yeah. Right. Like a child. So what about Slingblade are worded is that guy and go close it wasn't he like mm, like granting a lot. Yeah. Is he out of the question for dating? I don't know. I mean it's a character. It's a, it's a, it's a, a non are worded person playing but he's not fully, he's not full are worded.

Speaker 4:          00:27:45       No, he's, so that's a question could, could, could I, could you date Slingblade right. That's really for you. Do you think you could, well I think remembering back to that movie, I feel like he's not your type. He's not my right. What about Tom Hanks in um, hey, wait a minute. Tom Hanks in guilt. What's a movie? The stupid one with the Jannie. Oh yeah. Stupid is as stupid does dude. She hooks up with him. They even have a kid together. Spoiler alert. And how has that ethical, she hooks up with Forrest Forrest Gump. That's the name of the movie. Hello

Speaker 7:          00:28:18       back on my mother and father's play into my life. No, no, no. She had the mundane bill for me. Come over to the audience that around after and he had her looking at the ground, I dunno know no floor after what ahead of me. A hole dug out, lay down and oh

Speaker 4:          00:28:38       no, he's a problem. I think he's pretty with it. I just don't, I don't like where he's from. Like I don't want to talk about holes in the ground and stuff. You don't even know. I don't think it'd be a good date. I mean, I don't think you'd have a great date. I grew up in the San Fernando Valley, like, I don't know. Could you do it with him? Yeah, I think he's, he's at a level of intelligence. Yeah. I don't think it's unethical. You don't know. And I love Billy Bob Thornton. I think he's definitely sleep with Forrest Gump. Well that's the thing. Jenny did rite aid Jenny and then they had a kid. Yeah. So you can apparently, and he make a hit movie about it. Yeah. You, that's a good point. I forgot about your box office success after you do this. Right. It's a win win.

Speaker 4:          00:29:21       Yeah. So you would sleep with Forrest Gump though? I don't. I don't. He's not my type. I like the edge of a sling blade or guy more than [inaudible]. Which one would you do it with? Forest or sling blade. I mean, I think slingers into some rough shit personally. Yeah. Without really knowing much about them. All that wiggling and it was a, I mean he's, I feel like he's pretty rough. Yeah. I don't think it's going to be like, I think forest is gentle. It has like anger staff that he's repressing. You know it's going to come out. I mean he'll, he'll slice your tits off. I think forest is going to kiss your navel and he, he was always so afraid of free. I don't think. Is it unethical to be with him? Apparently no. Then they met. Like I said, they made a hit movie.

Speaker 4:          00:30:08       Everyone loves the dime the movie. Yeah. You know, that's a good, good point. What's her name that you know who's Janet? You can write pen Robin. Right? Do you think that he made her sniff her butt after like in house of cards? She made him sniff her if forest her sniff is but be really fucking awesome. That was in the scene. That definitely stolen. That would have been such a better man. I come over here, it's like a forest do it. He's like sniff but doing much. I ate lots of peas and carrots. Does it smell like chocolate there do you think? Huh? Do you think they're sexy? It probably was just sweet sec. He didn't do anything. I remember he would freeze. He kind of went just lay there and he loved it. He's an innocent. Why isn't that unethical though? I think it is. I think that's not cool if her, but apparently he, you know he wanted it though. That's the thing. He really loved Jenny. Yeah. She wanted to help him. She diverge a nice time. I mentioned this guy munching on your box telling you the story as I don't want to hear the stories as he's going down. I knew he stops. Too many words already. Looks up back down.

Speaker 4:          00:31:34       I don't like the words the talking and it's so boring. So did you, have anybody caught you that was like this? I did actually. There was a guy I worked with at the Department of Public Safety at the University of San Francisco and my work study job, I worked in the parking booth. So I handed out like I worked in one of those boxes for like four years, handing out parking. And then there was another job you could have, which is called the Charlie unit, where you gave tickets to people. And I refuse to do that. Well there is a kid, it was way too old to be an Undergrad. He was like 25 and he lived at home with his parents and he was kind of a sling blade adjacent, if you know what I mean. Yeah. And one time he did ask me out on a date, what'd you do? I was so stunned.

Speaker 4:          00:32:13       I didn't, cause I talked to him a lot. Like he stopped by the, the parking booth and I talked to him and I was always amused by him cause he was super weird and funny, you know? And I think he misinterpreted that as me being interested. It's a tough thing to adapt to when people are nice too sometimes. Yeah. And I get it like with guys, especially in college, like you're just, you're hunting for that stuff when you start just talking to them, we're like, oh, this is the one. Yeah, I feel badly. And then he, uh, he's like, so you know, if you ever want to go out on a date and eat dinner. And I was so stunned. I go, I don't eat. I'm such a day. I know. I was like, oh, I don't eat. Huh. And I tried to deflect it.

Speaker 4:          00:32:48       No, I didn't mean I was trying to be funny. I think at the time, I know that was bad. There was one guy went on a date with, it was a car salesman. We were 21 years old, 10 minutes into the day. He goes, I've slept with over 76 women. We were 20 years old. And I was like, Ooh, I gotta go. Where's your curious to how good he must be? No, I don't think the way you do. I, I was more of afraid of like diseases and stole this peg is going to get down. Is that right? Well you sleep with like street stragglers. Excuse me. Oh my God. You're, you talk about your past like you find these women and stragglers like gutter gutter slots. No, I don't. Gutter slugs. You one you thought you got aids from and since she and you're in your act now, you just, you recall her so fondly all the time, but was the closest that I, there's a time that I definitely thought I had aids the most. You're so dumb. I mean you had unprotected sex with a woman in Africa twice.

Speaker 1:          00:33:43       Okay. Um, yeah, I think about that. Uh, but we're, we're what's your worst suitor? Well, I mean I had one time, uh, severely disabled person gave me a flower and asked me to be their boyfriend. That's nice. Yeah, I didn't know how to handle it at first. So I was volunteering at a school with the kids, you know, with a disability. And when, when the, she gave me, she was like, be my boyfriend. I was like, oh my God. So I want it to the teacher. And I was like, I don't know what to do. And she told me like, just, just tell you you can't because you already have a girlfriend. Yes, that's what I did. That's sweet. That's not, that doesn't really count. No, no, no. Well, no, but I mean like what about nasty bitches? You've had like a nasty bitch. The okay man, this one, this is fucked up.

Speaker 1:          00:34:38       I feel bad about this one kind of. So I was at a bar on sunset and this is like in my early thin days here in La and I was just, I did it. I wasn't really a bar proper, but I happen to be out with a friend and we're at the bar and a woman just approached me and it, here's the thing about bars, this is no joke. You know they are dark bars at night, have favorable lighting and beer goggles, help tale. But I wasn't, I wasn't, I mean I have maybe a beer or two. I wasn't fucked up. Yeah. And she just approached me and she was like, hey blah blah blah and like very forward. And I was like, okay. She asks me for my number. I was like, yeah, all right. I gave her my number, had a small brief conversation and then I split and she called like either that night or the next day pretty quickly to set up going out Friday or Saturday. And I was like, okay, cool. And I went and I picked her up. Oh Man. Oh Man. It was so bad. What I was seeing was so, so bad. I was, I it to just be like, I got, I, I have a hernia.

Speaker 1:          00:36:00       I just, I mean who I saw, I had zero recollection of her. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:36:06       Really the lighting lighting and yeah, she was just nasty.

Speaker 1:          00:36:09       It was, she was, yeah. It was fucking upsetting. Wow. That's, but I mean, I was nice about it, but I was like, mm, no. You know, what did you do? Uh, we went to like, somebody was having to wait. She knew was having a party somewhere. I just, you know, the whole time I was like, I got to get out of this. I was trying to be like nice about it. And then I remember there was music playing. You don't actually remember is that the party that she took me to had somebody deejaying and sister Nancy BombBomb. That's our song that you and I, but I didn't know the name of that song yet. Yeah. And I remember that at that party she took me to, I went up to the DJ cause I had heard the song before I go, what's the name of this song?

Speaker 1:          00:36:55       And he told me and then that song we came something you and I bonded out early in our relationship because that's your phone. Then we went back to her. No you did. No, no, no. I had to drive her back and she was like, do you want to come in? And I was like, no. She's like, do you want to just like park here? And I was like, no, do you want to? I was like, no, none of it. That's so horrible. But that was, I wasn't a dick about it, but I remember being, I mean, what, what was the thing to do there? Should I have just like at the beginning saw her been like, oh shit. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:37:29       No, I mean here's, here's where the kids today have it, right with this app dating is that they, they don't commit to dinner. They don't commit to a lengthy thing. They commit to like coffee. Yeah. So if you don't like that person, you got a quick out like, oh, I got diarrhea, I got to go. Yeah. And that, that's a mistake. I think that we could've preempted that whole thing of making the date potentially shorter. Yeah. That's basically what they do today. Evening from me. Yeah. It sucks. It nothing's worse than a bad date to and you're like, and then my fear to offend, I just stuck it out. Yeah. I didn't want to be like, I don't find you attractive. Well, here's the thing, because if you think of it in a humane fashion, like you can be kind and maybe get to know somebody and just spend the night. And I was trying to be humane, but I think she was like, well, we're on a date. And I'm like in the U I n n e bitch. No, but that's true. If it, if she can't sense that you're not vibing on her sexually. It's kind of, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:38:28       Didn't I tell you a couple of an ass? I told you about one girl who, who was oh yeah, this was a funny one to me where we were in college and it was like junior year. Um, and the end of the year was approaching. Oh yeah. I, I was hanging out with her and we were in my dorm room and we were making out a little bit on my bed and then I just remember getting like a shove and she's like, you're snoring. So I fell asleep on her, not on her, but you know, next to her. And I was like, what? She's like, you're snoring. And I was like, I mean it's late. I think she didn't marry yet. That's the whole lifetime of that shit. And she left and then she was going home for the summer and she was like, well, I was staying at school. So she was like, it's like four hours apart. And she goes, well, you know, here's my number or whatever, let's, because we went out a couple times, you know, let's stay in touch the summer and you know, maybe see each other. And I was like, yeah, cool. And then I just never texted her or called her or anything. And then in the fall she rolled around, she was like, you're an ass like day one. And I was like, why you didn't text call once? And I was like, I mean,

Speaker 4:          00:39:38       see, I would've played it cool. I would have ignored you and been like, whatever dude is a fucking asshole. Like tell him with my whole thing was like, I just felt nothing for the guy doesn't call, he's not interested and she wasn't unattractive. I was like, I just, you know, it's not, it's not your jam. Hostile. Angry Hungarian. Yeah, the gigantic or we need to Franklin tits. Yeah, exactly. You're waiting for your genes. That's right. So it's a combination.

Speaker 1:          00:40:05       I just was like, whatever. And then I dunno, we went out like once or twice more.

Speaker 4:          00:40:11       Oh, you did go out with her again? Yeah, but I mean, I mean, you know, it was like I got guilted into it kinda sounds like there wasn't even guilted into it. I was just, that's a dick move cars. Then girls think that you're interested if you're like, ah, there's no one else in south care. Totally. We'd stayed. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:28       Friendly. It wasn't like bad with her. It wasn't bad. It was fine.

Speaker 4:          00:40:33       There was one guy I dated in college who was super cute, but there was too much of a language barrier, language barrier. He was a Spanish exchange students. I love them. You know me come on Puerto Rican Spaniards. I married if I can say Gouda. Um, and he was so sweet and so just kind to me and wonderful, but he didn't speak enough. You're a fucking Jody. So chasers. So I kinda, I kinda perse we couldn't go. I just felt like I can't talk to this person. How weird is that? I can't just hide the, I'm not a dirty slot. Like you are, you just hook up with every old strap. This guy from Spain, Barcelona, he spoke so little you couldn't even, yeah, it was tough. Like he was his first year here. We went on a date and I, I liked him. Like I said, his energy was great. He was sweet, super sweet. But it was, there was such a barrier culturally too, like, you know what I mean? We're eh, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:41:32       He was sweet. That's what you would've done to me. No, he was sweet guy. He's, he stalls. We, we still, uh, every now and then on Facebook. Oh Jesus. Really? But through, through other college friends in a group of friends. Yeah. Yeah, me too. I have a couple of girls who I thought were so smug and Hans Suite, but their language science day, smoking hot day. It was cute, but he wasn't smoking hot. You're much your, I still, you know, check in on it when you die. It's a college friend. He became a circle of French for sure. Is He married now? No, I don't. I don't even know. I have to ask him. I'll have to ask him. Are you married one Jose? I tried to think of other bad dates. I mean I feel like they're all bad. Dates are just terrible. That's probably why I wasn't a big dater. I felt I just not good at it. I don't like it. I have to know the person and then we then you'd go for

Speaker 3:          00:42:34       why don't you do it to me?

Speaker 4:          00:42:41       Huh? Hey, thank you. Earn that one. You earn that one with your one Jose emails that nobody knew about. Nobody knew. You can log into my Facebook any day and see the big extreme. Yeah, I had my headphones off. I can only hear.

But you know we have to talk about, because we were watching some show, we were watching below deck and I'm not gonna put my headphones on. I took it off. I know I'm playing other clips. Nellie's what other BARF clips line? No, I don't think I was born yesterday. So I don't know your tricks. I promise. I promise. Nope. We're watching below deck. Put them back on. Nope.

I just want to, I swear to God, if I hear a fucking Barb said, no, I'm not playing it. I'm not. I'm not. We're watching below deck. Slowly putting him on. We're watching deck and there's girls, like, one of my favorite things you do is this dumb girls lace.

Speaker 8:          00:44:43       Well, there's a face on your stars. There's a few favorite things you do. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Seriously. Seriously. Oh my God. Oh my God.

Speaker 4:          00:45:10       We have to go get her son soon, but before we do, oh my God, you guys are so disgusting. Yeah. I Til I got to put my kids to the, uh, there's a super flirt guy who's flirting with all these. He's flirting with every girl on there trying to hook up with the garage. And uh, one of the girls, one of the girls,

Speaker 8:          00:45:27       like out of the, you're the right guy for bed. And he's like, why not just that? Because I lot of bit tried to apply hot pepper sauce the way by a dotted tries. My mom loves her. I, he waits, I, his spoils her. That's what I would look at, far a Todd bits about it. Just like daddy about pretzels.

Speaker 4:          00:45:53       That's the worst thing you can do is, is girl, it'd be like, you are a princess. That is the worst. You're so special that somebody should treat you exactly the way I treat your mother. Right. But people forget that your mother most likely bore a few of his children. Yeah. Probably raise those babies. Took care of the husband for a year. You guys have been together. We've been through ups and downs and licked his bean bag. Dark does cock for years. And

Speaker 8:          00:46:23       what did that

Speaker 4:          00:46:25       when things weren't great. Yeah. And like, yeah, yeah, maybe given him a sympathy handy, you know, three weeks postpartum, still stitches, healing, milky tits underneath, pull down, maybe throws her husband and bone cause she knows it's been a long time since they've, right. So you go like, hello, this is a, that, that's why, that's why she gets, that's why your mom is treated so special by your dad. He's like over time. Yeah. The love grew into a special thing, right? It's all you should initiate dating that way. Well, it's first of all, there's nothing, there's nothing less attractive than the girl who leads with the prince ass car. It's so gross. I went out with a girl one time out of here, out upon signing up.

Speaker 8:          00:47:11       This is like, I would have died. A guy misses lay. I smell. This is the sound of my voice and Mrs, uh, like the touch of my head, I thought that's one of the last ships or bay like told me that a few times.

Speaker 4:          00:47:26       Yeah, it's attractive. Right? Can I, can I tell you the problem with women best, the way I smell this is all about guys, this is wrong. This is wrong. The reason women think this way is because of soap operas and romantic movies with, uh, you know, what's his name? Ryan Gosling and all this horse shit. They fill our minds full of nonsense. It most guys aren't going to do that for ya know, and the guys that will are full of shit. All right. That's the problem. They're a fucking total FTT. Our tds total shit run for the hills. If he's goring thumb rings and fucking, you know, sensitive guy, forget it. Um, that's true with the princess girl, man. You're doing your daughter's a disservice. I told her just be your own person and yeah, try to find someone that she likes him. He an equal.

Speaker 4:          00:48:13       Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. You didn't want to be relationships that are on pedestals. Right. Cause then she's implying the power balance should be that I'm on top. Yeah. And this guy of worships me. Yeah. It's so weird. It's very weird. There's also Mike Tyson coming jokes. We're jumping in. I did not tell him Mike Tyson one. Okay. Yeah, I did tell an Oj I was telling her earlier, well boy, imagine if you went out with Oj on a date now, but you didn't necessarily know everything. No. You do. You kind of know, but you're kind of not. Yeah. You kind of like a, you're willing to go out on a date with them. Yeah. And then he takes you out. You have a good time. Yeah. And then you started poking out. Good time. You start hooking up and as you orgasm is like the orgasm of your life. Yeah. He leans in and whispers in your ear like, I cut those motherfuckers next. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:49:09       And then that just makes you come harder. Yeah. You're cute. You're like, wow, now can I only be, can I only listen or watch true crime? To have a, like a, a massive orgasm sets you up for a fetish, I guess. Yeah. It looks like you two are Kendra jokes spirit. I had no idea of. Right. Do you like murder shows too? Uh, I just got into evil genius. Oh, it's great. Okay, so you're into that one. It's great. Yes, I'm good. I'm excited. I think it's like I, I like murder shows and I, he like gangster shows. I think for the same reason because I secretly want to be a gangster and a murderer. Oh there you go. Where it's like, but I'll never do it cause it's like, you know wrong. It's an escape. Yeah. Who are you ordering first? Let's talk about it.

Speaker 9:          00:49:55       I mean I think you've got to go family members. Oh, certain family members. Interesting choice. I agree. Now I'm on board with family. Yeah, like extended family. But like just those extended family that whenever their name pops up on your phone you're like, oh, I'm about to be miserable. Yeah. That's all really good. Like that's my whole goal in life is to be the person that when my name pops up on your phone you don't go, fuck yes, that's it. That because we all have those people in our lives where that person never calls you and goes, hey, just wanted to say, I just saw your work and congratulations and the life and oh my life. It's going well, everything's fine. Like you just have some people in your, in your world where that is never the appearance. It's like, all right, this phone call is going to cost me a couple thousand dollars, you know, and it cost me a few days off my life probably.

Speaker 9:          00:50:51       Yeah. Just because of the stress and all that and you know, and it's never just a simple fix. It's never just like, Hey, uh, I know you have AAA. I don't have AAA call AAA and get triple. It's, it's more like, Hey, I'm at a Pr, I'm going to prison in Morocco and like, you can't afford to go to Morocco. I got here long story, uh, it, you know, it's like, can you go to the State Department and it's like this huge thing do, are you good at the blowing off? Yes. Yes. So he didn't get to learn it though. You're like, you get better. I'm blowing off family or anyone, everyone. I'm teaching my wife right now because there's, because she's such an accommodating Combinator and, and she's such a loving giving person. Yes. Yes. She's a good person. She's wants to make everybody happy. She brought cookies over four cookies for you in a hole and homemade juice.

Speaker 9:          00:51:49       Yeah. Come on. Homemade juice. So yeah, apple, ginger, we're going to clean out your, Colin's great, uh, well that, that on the show. Yeah. So like she's a good person who, whenever crazy family or friends calls up, she's like trying to be very, she's trying to be very helpful. It's going to solve the problems. And I just, I finally to like sit her down and be like, no, you can, you can just not do that. She's like, yeah, but then they'll, then they'll not like me. I'm like, they already don't like you. They're already just calling you up to use you for because they know that you're the helpful one. So just don't be the helpful one that that's why I'm so envious of some of the members of my family that are just complete fuckups cause it's like no one would ever call them. No one would ever call him and be like, Hey, uh, you've been in jail three times in, in and out of various rehabs and you may have killed someone. Could you help me move? Leggy let, let, let, like no one would ever say that your family, cause Tom and I, we compare crazy. I've got a lot of alcoholism, mental illness. We checked those boxes. I think like, I think like we're playing like dysfunctional family. Bingo. Alcoholism. Yes. Mental illness. Yes. Hoarding.

Speaker 9:          00:53:03       We got, yeah, we got one hoarder. Uh, I think Tom, how does it go if there's pathways? Oh yeah. Yeah. So level one is like, I like a lot of shit too. Um, is like, uh, basically, um, clutter, a lot of clutter. Trash. Yeah. Nothing

Speaker 8:          00:53:26       is rash starts at three. Okay. So then it's just trash. If it's like Vcs, Florida ceiling, but there is a pathway if they leave a place to walk, I think that's a four. But it's still like this person is in deep, deep. Right. But if you need a shovel to get from one room to another or if like five is like, there's like, yeah, there's rats here, but you know, they're nice. That's level five where they, where they shit they shit and they're like, there's no plumbing here but, right. But they also don't see a problem with it. Like someone will be like, did you just shit like an open bag? And they're like, where do you feel like they don't even see live is in the toilet that no longer works. And it just piles and piles of selecting your shit. You're just like, I can't, I uh, because they don't have children.

Speaker 8:          00:54:12       They're like, I created this shit in my body and I can't get rid of it. Yeah. There was a few epitopes, map packs and that's the guy's name. And he called in. We had him on like years and years ago and I met him, he's a great guy. And we were talking about the level fives and there was a couple episodes where there's a few times where he was like, this is not salvageable. And one of them was so bad that the whole episode was just to get the person out of the house. Yeah. The convince him to leave and then they burned the house down. They turned it. Sometimes that's the only solution is you just come in with a blow torch and a bulldozer and you guys like, cause what are you saving? What slice of them you're saving important stuff. Like I need that. I need my nose hair from 1987 and helps them and all they do is find a new home.

Speaker 8:          00:55:03       Yeah, I know exactly the same. Yeah. I like how five they would always, they would always tie together on that and also on like 600 pound shit. They'd be like, they'd be like, you know, like either like I like, I just even like his food tastes good. They're like, when did you start gaining weight? They're like, when my dad died and did, is that when you like start eating a lot more than they're like, and then they're like, do you think it's probably related? And they're like, I don't know. Yeah. And the same thing with the hoarders. They'll be like, my wife left me in 1973 and they're like, when did you start hoarding 74 and now nothing will ever leave me again. I have my house of everything. Yeah, a lot of trouble. God, they should just have it because like all those shows are like on the learning channel or discovery channel or something.

Speaker 8:          00:55:51       They should just have a shot in Freud channel. That's all the fucked up people in this world where where we can go and go, okay, I'm not that bad. Of course. That's why we watch all the top age gap, age gap. Love his girl. I seen that. I haven't seen it. That's on Netflix but just the title of it and I'm man, it's like I'm 60 she's 19 great man. I'm always curious about that. You mentioned was that too right? Was like I'm not, I don't drink a lot cause like the whole age gap love thing. I was once. The youngest woman I ever dated was 20 years old and I was 29 and I dated her for like two dates and I ended it when she didn't know who Johnny Cash was like literally didn't know. You know there was a walk the line movie. I'm not even expecting you to start. Yeah, like she's like, Ooh, now I can't. That's his damn girl.

Speaker 8:          00:56:50       You guys have a conversation with their friends. I just think the threat of the prints that I don't want to print that. That's, that's a little pretentious but I feel like a print that I identify as a print. That's the same way Bruce Jenner said as a woman, but he's not really buddy. I'm a print that. I just want to find a guy like weekends or whether you would sleep before it's got burned out. We jumped over, we jumped over it. Whereas we have an intro. We jumped over. Our dental dental update is brought to you by get quip.com and we are going to ask our guests, Brad Williams, like a horror movie and hip hop. That's awesome. Love that. Brad, do you have a nice smile? Thank you. Let me take care of your terrorists who they're perfect. They're really nice. Braces. Gotta love it. Do you do general upkeep pretty well?

Speaker 8:          00:57:57       Yeah. Uh, yeah, I do general upkeep. And uh, you happened to go to the dentist every six months. You really do it. Yeah. Not everyone does that. It's weird because your normal is what you perceive everyone else's normal to be. And when I find out that people don't go to the dentist every six months, I'm like, wrong with you? Like my mouth is fine. I'm like, oh, and it's preventative. Yeah. My friend just, uh, took his daughter to the dentist and she had 16 cavities, 16 and I'm like, what? How does it like we might be dealing with a possibly unethical Dennis. Oh really? They're like, ah, you have 194 cavities. This is a joke because it's true. But I'm gonna tell you the joke though. So I told the story about how many years ago out here. I went to the dentist and I did go a celebrity dentist.

Speaker 8:          00:58:53       I was working for the show, extreme makeover, and they were giving this deal out for whitening. So we, a lot of us went there. And during the general exam, the dentists' not the celebrity dentist we had of his trainees. Sure. It goes, well, you know, let's just do a general exam. And then he goes, you know, you have 13 cavities, I have 13 cavities. He's like, yeah, do you want to get them filled? And I'm like, well, I don't know man. This is kind of a lot to take in right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're like, it'll be like $5,600. You just want to just take it right. I'm like, what? Just yeah, and I might be a PA, I don't know man. Yeah. So I was like, just let me fucking think about it. And so I go to another dentist and he's like, uh, you don't have any cavities.

Speaker 8:          00:59:35       And I'm like, what do you mean? He's like, dude, you remember tell you that was full of Shit. So yeah. Is this whole thing like I have a similar story, but yeah, six months later she was like, you know what happened the one time I went to the dentist and there's like you have 13 cavities. And then I went to another dentist and he was like, no, you didn't get it. And I'm like, that's my story is what happened to me. I won't tell you what happened to me know. Cause I had dental insurance for the first time. I lied. My friend Eric, he will, he will uh, backup my story. I want Eric to weigh in on this. He will weigh in on this. I went, cause I had dental insurance and I went to some scumbag who was like, you have like, uh, a lot of cavities. And then I went to my Hungarian dentist and the valley, there you go. Who's now retired? He again, I could waste on boss. And he said this guy, he's a fucking liar. You're a scumbag necrotic guide. You have no cavities. This is bullshit.

Speaker 9:          01:00:28       Isn't that it isn't an amazing, uh, I once saw a doctor that was supposedly like a specialist for dwarfs cause we a little people often have like respiratory problems. It just kind of were like pugs. Yeah. You know, kind of we can't breathe. So I knew that I wouldn't see this doctor and he goes like, he, and this is back when I was like 10 and he goes like, oh you have like severe like respiratory problems. Like we need to like prep you for surgery like in that like in the next two weeks. Right. Or else you could die in your sleep any. And he's saying this to my mom and my mom's like freaking out and she, she calls my dad and my dad's like, oh hold on I gotta friend one second. We go, we go and we see the friend who's also an ear, nose and throat doctor and he just looks and goes, you're, you're, you're fine.

Speaker 9:          01:01:22       I don't know what the fuck. And like we were like prepped for surgery like the next week and it's like, what would he have done? Just cut my throat and look it and go, Nah, we're good. Charge him like is that there's people out there that can do the dental world. It's much more common. Yeah. But this kind of shit, that sounds quite terrifying. Yeah. That's like a whole like, Brad needs a lung transplant. We're going to have to do it today. He's saying things that you can't even have a, he needs a new frontal lobe. We that that's the cause of the dwarfism because

Speaker 8:          01:01:54       bad frontal lobe. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So if you just make that the cash, are you guys ready? Ready to do it? Let's do it. We're ready. God scumbag. That's crazy. Um, yeah, but you have nice teeth and keep them. So you have raised as any weird dental things. Yeah. I had said

Speaker 9:          01:02:14       I didn't lose my baby teeth for the longest time, so they had to pull 12 teeth at once or a lot of little people jokes associated with it. I haven't even lost the, I didn't lose my baby teeth or as I call them teeth. Yeah. So they had to yank all them at once and they give me a lot of laughing gas. Yeah. Remember how old you were or this was basically between the ages of Eight and 12? I had a lot of dentists, Rama. Oh, do you did have a lot of dental issues. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then that is common. Uh, not for dwarves just for me, but if you will. But if you look in my dad's mouth, you're like, yeah, I get it. Does he have dad enough? He's got like, oh, like he looks like one of those, he looks like the part of the bugs bunny sketch.

Speaker 9:          01:02:59       We're bugs, throws a grenade into his mouth and like shuts his mouth and then just real like, yeah, that's what his mouth looks like. I'll fuck up. Yeah. Just all fucked up. But like they're all there, but they're all at different angles. Wow. You know, and he's never addressed it now. Yeah. Yeah. Why would you do that? I was saying that because we talk about bad mouth, like just how like if you think about your dad, dad's in general. I'm talking about like Dads, people our age. You're never like, oh he's got a really nice mouth kind of stick. Yeah. I mean I'll run, I'll see my dad just be like, Hey, oh you know, he's visiting and meet you for lunch. And then I'll just walk up to him, give him a hug and I'm like, have you brushed your teeth today? He's like, yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:03:38       I'm like, it's most terrible. He's like, really? Are you serious? I was like, yeah, I go dude, eat a mint. Eat something too. Yeah. Just to be at least his mouth, his mouth, dry mouth all the time. Like, yeah, like what your morning mouth is. Yeah, it is true. I think. I think they've just gotten the full, don't give a fuck. That's true. Full cause you see that with like clothes. Yeah. You know, it's like are you, you'd be like, are you wearing that outfit? He's like, yeah, why I don't care. No one's touching his dick. It is about Dick Touches. Definitely. Yeah. If you're trying to get someone in touch your Dick, your standard of fashion high chain, everything is way higher. Once you're totally tapped out. Why would I do anything? Offer these dictations right now. Speaking of Dick touches forest. Okay. We're talking about whether or not it's unethical to sleep with somebody who's not on your mental level.

Speaker 9:          01:04:34       And we're like, well, at a certain point, obviously it's like you would have well, judgment, intellectual skills, right. Mentally retarded. Right. Okay. Cause like all right, because I'm trying to think of like not Forrest Gump, but, uh, not Slingblade what was, uh, what she did a it, the movie was called the other sister Juliet Lewis. Yes. Her. And in that movie, so she was like, yeah, she was when she was Juliette Lewis and the other sister plays like a mentally challenged woman. Right. But she's not fully, she's not like life goes on. Right. And then what's it called? The other sister. Yeah. So I, I think if you are in that spectrum, yeah. Cool, cool. You know? But once you get to the point where it's like a w w it's like drool once for yes, like you know what I mean? Like once you get to that level, it's like that.

Speaker 9:          01:05:32       All right. Now what about, what about Forrest Gump? Was Jenny ethical or unethical? I think I, I think Jenny was fine. Yeah. Funny Lawn. The level. But, but he's sweet and sincere and genuine love for this woman. Now you could almost say that she was unethical because he loved her so much. Not the actual physical part of it, but because it's like you could take advantage of him. She did black. I'm saying though, is that unethical? It's like I don't think in that situation it was, I think like in that, and that's the thing, there's a there, there, there's a spectrum and where are you on that spectrum and it, like I said, if it's, if, if, if I don't even know what that was. That was from the of the other sister. Oh, that was a Giovanni Ribisi who plays the boyfriend whose movie, I mean, come on. It's mentally challenged. People fucking, and it's a movie. Is this a, is that a song? Yeah. Shit. Oh, that's savage garden.

Speaker 9:          01:06:41       Yeah. That, yeah, it goes, yeah. Just like, yeah. I mean she's Kinda nice voice. She seems off. Would you fuck this guy? I mean that's, yeah. Is that wrong? Well, he's creepy. Creepy, creepy thing. Serves me more than the mental acumen. The guy just sounds like he'd be like, Hey, want to get in that van? I got some, I got some duct tape for you. Sit down and watch episodes of 2020 together. He's been not, this guy would not be giving you neck kisses. No, that's just, that's like a Lenny of from of mice and men like, just think he's going to fuck the back out of something floats out. Now is it politically incorrect for actors to play mentally challenged or are we done with that? We'll see. And now, uh, there was just this article as we're recording this where someone, someone got in trouble today because they're, they're getting cast to play a gay person and they're not gay boy.

Speaker 9:          01:07:54       Right. And I'm thinking like, all right, big thing with like trans, you can't put your eyes with the scarlet Johannson thing. Yeah. She tapped out. Yeah. It's like, I get that. All right. When John Wayne was playing gangas con, that was fucked up. All right. When he was like, oh, we're gonna go over there, I'd get some Hmong goals. Like, yeah. All right. That's, that's wrong. When a w was, was it Mickey Rooney or Andy Rooney? I think Mickey Rooney Wa wa one of the Rooney guys. The, uh, he, he, he played a Chinese person in, I think it was 16 candles. No, it was a breakfast at activities. Right. It was her, that was print that's off. That was horrific. And he did it with buck teeth in and the glasses. Yeah. That was the me. So sorry. That's where that came from. Is that packed the cataract cataract?

Speaker 9:          01:08:43       Oh yes. Yeah, that's bad. But like, but back then they were like, this is one of the best comedic, but you're like, this is fantastic. Well, I mean, yeah. Yeah. Some movies don't hold up. You know, Dumbo is a prime example. But like, yeah. Some words. Yeah. So like, yeah, that is, that is completely egregious. But when you have people like it's called acting, you're, you're, you're playing someone, you're not. So now like, are we only allowed to have people that are like, oh, well he's an accountant. While you can't get a fake accountant, right. Uni How dare you not use an actual account and there's real accounts out there that could use that part. No. It's acting

Speaker 1:          01:09:23       bullshit. Part of, yeah. To, to me of like the scarlet Johannson thing, which what happened, but I don't know what happened through Hanson signed on to play this. Um, I think it's based on a real story. Yeah. About, so a trans person, right? Yeah. And so there was this huge backlash like, hm. Um, you're, you're using a cisgender woman to play this transport. Yeah. There are plenty of trans women out there, but here's my big beef with this addition. There's a fucking fly here. Yeah. Additionally, to the, let's say, well, why can't, I mean, it's like Brad saying it's an actor. So I get why you're saying get the authentic person to play it. How about the business side of this where people buy tickets to see scarlet Johansson, guess what? There is not somebody currently in the Trans Space. Right. Who is as big of a draw as Scott and I know you, the argument can be, well, a good movies, a good movie and, and like, yeah, they just need more opportunities like this. Okay. But the people who want to make this movie, right. Our bedding on, hey, if we can have a movie star plays a apart exactly. Can Recoup this investment. Yeah. You can have this hot, gorgeous, big titted beast playing right. This part. Right. And who I would love to see her

Speaker 9:          01:10:40       play a trans. Yeah. That'd be so interesting to some degree. Even some people were getting mad at the Rock in that, uh, tower tower movie did. Yeah. Because it wasn't because he had one leg, he, he, he, it's like, and somebody's like, well, you what? You couldn't find an actor who actually has one leg. It's like, no, but not the rock. The Rock is the most bankable movie star on the planet right now. This movie would not have fun debuted the way it did. And by the way, if you're a person, and like I'll, I'll say this from my perspective, okay. Because yeah, there's been times when, uh, uh, all right, the guy who played the dwarf in the Lord of the Rings, not a dwarf, all the dwarves in snow white and the huntsmen not tours. All right. They got, uh, you know, uh, they did on the very, the most recent, uh, Willy Wonka, the chocolate factory, the one with Johnny Depp deep.

Speaker 9:          01:11:31       Roy is a dwarf, but they just clone him a bunch of times. And rather than using other dwarf factors, it's like, yeah, I would have an opportunity to be mad about that. But if you told me right now that like Chris Hemsworth was playing a dwarf, I'd be like, awesome. Yeah, that's a great representation for my people. So like the rock, it's like, yeah, if I wanted a representation of the people with prosthetics who wouldn't want to go for the rock because the, uh, because the people who are missing limbs, the only famous one we know about you right now is Oscar Pistorius. He killed his wife or his girlfriend or whatever the fuck. So that's, that's what we have that's in our minds about you. So why not Iraq

Speaker 8:          01:12:11       and their defense? A lot of, uh, people who were, um, uh, what are you missing? Limbs were super supportive of that movie because I saw a couple of things and they were like, oh, it's awesome. And the Rock's awesome. Like representing us. Yes. But of course people want to get mad about everything anyways. I think now people have this sort of thing where, and, and, and I hate it because there are people that have legit causes to be angry, to be upset, to be offended. And I think, but right now there's some sort of weird group mentality where if you aren't offended by something, you feel like you're not included. You're like, oh my God, I'm not poor. I'm not part of the cool kids. All the cool kids are getting mad about this thing. I should be mad about this thing. Or You're searching for your thing, whatever that is. And it's like just or you could have a coconut smile and shut the fuck up. It's a group think thing to get onboard and people aren't really thinking. No, they just, they just want to be offended for the sake of being offended. So lame. Speaking of your, uh, I could advice them both mega history, your tribe. Do you know that, uh, Hungary has abolished gender studies.

Speaker 8:          01:13:18       Can I mention my tribe is the most sympathetic to everybody in the beginning of the week, 24 hours from the Ministry of human capacities and the Ministry of Justice to comment on a proposed amendment, which declares that no gender study courses can be launched in the future. All right. Wow. You know, so some people sound he'll move forward and there's like, no, no, thank you. [inaudible] Shit. You don't want this bullshit. It's an, an ideology, not a science. So they're going to do away with it. All right. You know what? I will say in defense of my people, they don't like what they don't like. They don't want it and get the fuck out. Jews, Jews, Albanians, Gypsies. I love that you led with juice. That's like we killed him and they, they reelected a guy who had a openly antisemitic

Speaker 9:          01:14:12       blah like, right. He's like, they're a problem. A lot of people are hungry or like this guy, it makes less sense. I mean Jews, right? I mean, yeah. Yeah. Like we can't really talk shit in America with our current situation. But yeah, I guess what I'm saying, at least the Hungarians are open about being, you know, racist and wanting to keep everything the way they like it. Hey, you know what though, I'm a fan and this is the thing that uh, when someone takes this next statement out of context, this will end my career. I'm a fan of someone overtly being a racist just because then it's like, oh, your races suck. I should avoid you where your clan robes everywhere. So I can be like, oh, not talking to you. The worst is when you talk with someone and you gel with somebody and you're friends with someone.

Speaker 9:          01:15:07       They're like, oh my God, this is a great person. And then they slip in the comment where the where they're like, yeah, I mean, yeah, it's great that we get to hang out here, but this place really gone to shit since I started letting the blacks, and that's when you go, oh, did not know that about you. And now you're shocked. Like, no, I'm a fan. If you're, if you're a fucking racist, be a racist all the time so we can all just be like, oh, okay, so be open. Yeah. So don't live in Hungary. That's the point. Yeah. Do that. You know? It's like the people were like, he won't make me a cake for a gay wedding. It's like, is that the only baker and how there, there's other bakers. If someone was like, I'm not making a cake for your midget wedding, I'd be like, okay, I don't want to give you money right now is let me give you money fighting to give the risk of money.

Speaker 9:          01:16:04       Let's change the outside. It's like, you're never going to stop bullying going stop racism. Never. It's like trying to stop the wind. People are fucking crazy and dump this world because, because before we had Mexicans and blacks, we hated the Irish. Oh, that's true. And it's like, how would like the Irish, he's like, we all hear the Irish at one point where they're like, ah, fucking my hoolahan. He's the reason why I'm not successful in life. So like, we'll, we'll find a way there. There's dwarves, no joke. There's dwarves that hate other dwarves. What's that all about? Why do they hate the fuck if I know, like they're, oh my God. But it's like, they're like, what are they saying? It's just like their type of dwarfism is like, like fucked up. Or like they, they shouldn't receive the benefits of certain things because they're, uh, because they're, uh, uh, healthier dwarf. So it's like, oh, we need, like, we need, we need funding. We need attention because we're so fucked up. He has hypoplasia, uh, he's not very fucked up, so he get anything,

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       like it's that kind of shit. That's nice.

Speaker 9:          01:17:12       Right? Yeah. So it's like, you're never going to stop this. I know you can never, you can't

Speaker 1:          01:17:17       do you accept that the world is full of assholes and people that just want to complain about everything. Actually have an example of one right here. Okay. Uh, this, uh, well I'll just play a moment for it for you and then we can talk about it. All right.

Speaker 3:          01:17:41       Whichever your chicken.

Speaker 1:          01:17:43       Okay, wait. So here's the setup. Okay. I heard rape. It's, this is a at cafe gratitude. These are animal rights activists that are basically all three of them. Yeah. So they're talking about the fact that would many paper, so many paper that their case credit, artificial insemination of livestock is rape. No. Something that cafe gratitude the Vegan cafe owners are doing on their private farm in Hawaii. So this is like the setup here. Okay. How good is your life that you have to be like out of it

Speaker 9:          01:18:24       all? You know, we got vets that can't get the correct mental health care. We got a written racist things going on. We've got genocides going on in other parts of the world and you're like, Eh, I think all, I think artificially inseminating cows, that's my hill. That's what I'm dying on is I want to find something, man. It's so, I would love for these protesters to hang out with someone like the black lives matter protesters and just compare story. Anything else or anything else? Just like, oh, you're here because you want more funding for cystic fibrosis. That's nice. You want to know what they're doing to cows? They're artificially inseminate. They're raping them. How's these psychos? These three cycles are elitist is off going. That ain't, that ain't right. I'll show you a raven, a cow. I, these three fuckers are,

Speaker 1:          01:19:20       oh, I protest. They have a megaphone and they're yelling at cafe gratitude about, uh, they're, they're saying, you know, uh, any tight, what does it, rape is not love. You can't compassionately raped someone as they say that, that guy walking the dog. Yeah. Says Mike Tyson did. And then, then he said Coby Bryant did. And then he goes, uh, to somebody else I think are maybe the camera guy says, show him, you know, he says, show him your chicken. I Dunno, he's saw it, but here's the whole thing again. And then it goes on.

Speaker 3:          01:20:07       Great. Show me your

Speaker 9:          01:20:07       chicken is shown here to say, oh, and there's a woman that cow suit tell Matt talking about with this. But here it continues. It continues.

Speaker 3:          01:20:19       She's still on the magazine.

Speaker 9:          01:20:29       Wonderful. Sarah Silverman had a few good [inaudible], some dandies lot of female comics. Actually plenty of grey rape jokes out there. There's some solid ones. You guys a pretty good one. Funny. I mean for just a pedestrian walking by protest those solids pretty good. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:20:48       And she says

Speaker 3:          01:21:04       How much were ridiculous? Could this be,

Speaker 9:          01:21:08       does it go on? You know, and I know where this calf is. This in Santa Monica, I think of Venice. Do you know what that is? It's like blocks from the beach. It's a nice day. The Sun Shining and she's doing this. You're like, this guy, he just got off your bike or something. We'll go have lunch and then someone's on a megaphone. I tried to rape me, go to the beach lady, hold off here. Here's why. Here's one of the people who I blame and in these situations is the boyfriend or spouse or whoever of these women who win. Because if my wife came to me and said, oh, I'm going to go protest that, I'd be like, oh, like, cool. What? Um, what are you protesting? Did you know if they're artificially inseminating cows and that's rape and they, I mean, I'd be like, yeah, you're not going outside today.

I always talk about like if I started grief dancing or wearing these behaviors, I'd be like, would you leave me? And he's like, of course. So that's crazy. That's literally, that's literally why that is. Have a spouse love is aware of that. They can check you. Yeah. My wife has checked me many times. I'm like, you're not wearing that. That's dumb. That's a minimum level. Yes. That's, that's bare minimum. Not like a belief system where it's like, yeah, I'm going to spend a gorgeous day in Venice protesting the artificial insemination. You can cafe. It's a Vegan cafe. It's crazy. It's crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:22:49       Right?

Speaker 9:          01:22:53       Women's sounds like Vince Mcmahon. Danielle, Josh, Mike. All right. Joe Hayes cut up Sheoak I want that to be my, so

Speaker 8:          01:23:06       Jeff, that's another thing too with these social justice warriors. It's like she's taking it out a car. Like, do you know what I mean? Like you say rape was good. No. You saying like, Hey, fucking actual rapes were committed and you're not mad about those. Yeah. You're mad about the cow, the fake cow rape. He's making kind of a dad joke. Yeah. And it was like, I mean it's not whatever. It's not great, but it's not good for like for like a non comedian who just walked by. He's like, yeah, that'd be bride dead. And they still are you? Everyone's still cooking careers. Yeah. In the public eye problems there. I know, I know. It is. Hey Stan, a funny about what gets take like people who get, um, you know, career's taken down now. Yeah. For like jokes and they're like, no. Coby Bryan.

Speaker 8:          01:23:59       Yes. Settled a rape charge. Right. Mike Tyson went to jail for raping someone. Yeah. Legitimately and be more like, uh, yeah, but yeah. Yeah, but they, they paid their debt to society. True. But as these, and sorry, he's going down the road. Fuck some girl. His fingers all that's right. God, that's the most embarrassing part of that whole thing. Total list of the throat. Fucking yeah. It's, it's weird what you're, what you're choosing to take down. Yeah. It's arbitrary and that, and that's what I mean is that, is there, is there, there's many legitimate, horrific things that are happening in this world that we should shine a spotlight on and should work to fix. And then there's this, I think because there's some stuff that's just take downable like he is, he's on sorry thing. It's like that's it. That's an attainable shaming goal. Whereas like the Mike Tyson and the Colby, right? Like, you're not going to do shit, lady, you're protest. Why? Because Colby could still make a, make a three. There you go. There's too much money. And somebody was saying, you know the make you cum guy. Yeah, I'll make you come. Yeah. How can I forget? Oh wait, no, this story and I love that guy.

Speaker 8:          01:25:16       What does that, what's the context of this video where he, first of all, he really does a nice job of framing himself out and he posted these kinds of, gets a little bit dog refer at least. Yeah. He could post these guns on sound. Now that's what these guys like post a daily video where you, I'd like to have some pussy, my face and then talks about how good of a lover he is. And so we found like a barrage of his videos like this is

Speaker 10:         01:25:48       to have a woman in my home.

Speaker 8:          01:25:54       What's he watching? I'm trying to like, oh, that's Rachel Maddow. Oh No. They get their salary. He's mad.

Speaker 10:         01:26:00       Oops. They don't care about their partner.

Speaker 9:          01:26:03       So he's like, um, I'm not like that. Um, see, this is when I see this, that's when I'm like, yeah, minority report had it right. We should just be sending the van to his house and be like, yeah, we're picking you up. I haven't done anything. You will. You will. You're going to, you're going to do some shit. What? And we're like, yeah, we're like 99.9% sure you're going to do something. It's kind of creepy.

Speaker 10:         01:26:37       I even went and Beaumont

Speaker 9:          01:26:39       before I, before I went boom, boom. Yeah, I doubt it's a boom before. Is that the tactic to get the ladies? Absolutely. I just walked up to him again. I make it a lot before I'd go really just peaked around throat. I have that effect on then a lot of these, okay. All the same. Took his teeth out for this one.

Speaker 10:         01:27:06       Have yet. There should be somebody out there wants to her cup crisper. I wish I could pop me a rich woman harder or younger or whatever.

Speaker 9:          01:27:17       Older, younger, whatever. I hope older because looking at him you're like, yeah, you don't deserve to have anybody. He won't always got a goatee. Now he really wants you. Can I get a soul patch for the next one? Somebody wrote in, I was watching the, Oh, I'll make you a calm guy. And I noticed his nose and how it's crooked as it goes towards the right side of his face. Clearly it's been broken. I like to think it's been broken from him talking this way to women in public and the women or her hot black guy that fucks and fucks good. Decided to smack him around. And this might be why he says things to his camera now, Nolan. Yeah, I mean it might be right. Strong theory. Yeah. Strong theory theory. Very uh, yeah. That, that, that makes a lot of sense. This can't work.

Speaker 9:          01:28:10       I know there's one or two savages out there or, or if he does it's like, it's like, all right, but then at the same time we say it can't work, but then there's women that date serial killers, you know what I mean? So it's like there's nothing, nothing can really surprise me anymore. And the, and yet there's some people that are single like good people. I know. That's the amazing part to me is making his videos and it's always the same thing over and over and over. Well we'll find out that he, that he married one of the my 600 lb life women. That'd be great. That would be great. I just want a woman to sit on my face. Challenge accepted. Let's see if you come out of this one alive, why would you make a video without your teeth? And that's the crazy because you know it's smoother. That's the craziest

Speaker 8:          01:29:02       thing. It also hasn't, sorry. It has a sign that you're doing on purpose. No, I did on accident. We do it on purpose sometimes. Yeah. There's some people that have been in our lives for like more than a decade. Who are your house? Christine? And I'm like, she's good Christine. Well at least I ate. At least I stopped myself. I go but it'd be, but also good for you for not getting mad cause I hate those people that like they, they, their name is Brittany but they spell it with like three teas or something and then they get mad at you when you're like, oh bri t t and what you're like, what? Excuse me as far as the threat is, um, three days in a heart instead of a dot. Before the eye. Um, prednisone at this folder. I haven't seen this here, but it says it's no fucking God.

Speaker 8:          01:30:08       Yeah. Cause you've gagged like twice. We played one earlier. She got really, Oh this says racist dog owner. So here's the deal, man. My wife and I recently adopted a Chihuahua puppy. Okay. I feel like it's very important that this dog stay connected with its cultural roots. Therefore we have been teaching the dog commands in Spanish. I'm going to laugh at this. This is going to be so great. It's a spite, not really speaking or knowing any Spanish myself, friends and family think we are strange for doing this. But I strongly believe that not training about it this way makes you a racist piece of shit. Why should you have the right to whitewash your dog's heritage? I'd like to hear your opinions on this since Todd is half Mexican or something like that and Christine can weigh in as well, despite her opinion being tainted with white privilege. Thanks. Wow. Love the broadcast. This on me. Beat me. I need to get fucked a lot, man. Chris. All right.

Speaker 8:          01:31:20       Well I have to say this is genius on this man's part. I think it's fantastic. Yeah, I mean, I think you should learn alpha. Maggie, if you have a German shepherd, they have those German shepherds that you can get there were like trained in Germany and then they, they only know commands in German. Amazing. The Brussels Griffon is from Dallas. Maybe that's why it's such a fucking stupid dog, just because we're speaking it to it in the language they speak. What four different languages in Brussels? Major hub, but I mean, French is the dominant language. Clearly Betsy needs

Speaker 9:          01:32:00       to be hearing more from trying it. Let's try it tonight. We, eh, March, I would love to see, but to me that I mean that, that person's obviously being funny. Right? Yeah. Okay. Okay. I'm not talking to a dog like this. That's me talking to it. That so fun. I lose my God damn mind. I mean, see that's the thing is like racism without evil intent. Hilarious. Hilarious. Yes. Larry, you mean this dog? We should, I should teach you a command to teach your, your Chihuahua. I've been watching El Chapo, the series on Alex, which is not just in Spanish, but it's all Mexican slang. Um, so maybe teach your dog, uh, seeing that the way, like you said way is like a, you know, it's like dude dangled, took a meek to tangle. [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          01:33:04       Django. I have to eat something. Well it's like I have your food. It's fucking good. Chingona and then just you hit the Mallory, just tell him that that could be like when to attack someone. You just see someone and it's a Chihuahua. So it'd be hilarious. So you can do it as a joke. There you go. Cause it's not going to be like, it's not like if I, like I have a 70 pound pit bull, so if I said like attack, like I could let Jimmy and we like terrify someone. She's his cries. Your dog train like that? No, not at all. He's the sweetest thing ever. So like you would never do it, but like now I'm tempted to just like walk up to people and like Diego Kale, you know what I mean? Like have someone like freak the fuck out. Cause you would, oh my God, I'm, I'm just fasten. Yeah. He's a massive, massive best. He's just, I mean, granted it's me, so he's massive to me. That's right. Sounds like we see him and it looks like R. Dot.

Speaker 9:          01:34:05       What's a saddle doing on him? I think I got here. Uh, yeah, my God. Yeah. Uh, we, we actually got the dog. Uh, my wife got the dog when I was in Houston, Texas. Oh, I wasn't even there. Really? Yeah. How long ago? This is like, this is like a month and a half ago, so yeah, it's a new dog. Yeah. I mean new dog. And his name is Diego. Diego rescue or a yeah. Yeah, they uh, they found him chained to a church in Compton. I'm a dog stuck life. Yeah. But he's, he's the sweetest dog and like, uh, I feel weird telling these stories because I know bill burr had that bit where it's like his wife got the dog got also got a pit bull while he was out and then he was nervous like coming home to the dog. Um, but yeah, so I had to come home to the dog, like really scared because I'm like, well I'm walking.

Speaker 9:          01:34:58       So I had like my wife come out with the dog on a leash and like meet me outside the house and then I walk the dog and then I walked the dog into the house. So it's like I, I'm, I'm, I'm a dude, I'm fucking alpha. And then the dog immediately got gun in the house, just turn around and jumped on me and started like licking my face and I'm like, love the dog. That's good. Well, and it has no hostility from doing, it's the best. Then like when a midget walks at pit ball, everyone just goes like that. That's, that midget knows something like that's a bad reality show. Yeah, I was on it. That's the weirdest part. Pit boss. Yeah. You were on Pippa? Yeah, I did a roast of Shorty Rossi. Oh Wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow. What was one of the jokes? Fuck some something about he likes pit bulls cause its head. It looks like a pit bull testicle. I don't know. Do you find that with certain cultures of people react to you differently? Like I dunno, the same cultures that are wowed by magic.

Speaker 6:          01:36:04       I had a joke in my attic

Speaker 9:          01:36:05       that different races respond to me. That's what I'm asking. Yeah. Yeah. And it's true where it is true, right? Yeah. Oh yeah. Like give us some insight and, and all right, I'm essentially going to do my joke, but at the same time it's real. So, uh, white people are very, like, when their kids stares at me, it's like he's the kids curious. The parent is horrified. Right. It's like, and they're like, grabbed the kid's head and like turned violently turn the kids had away and stuff like that. And that's, to me, that's, that's a bummer cause it's like you're, you're trying to tell the kid like, this person doesn't exist. Don't, don't, don't acknowledge my favorite. And if people are like, well then what should we do? My favorite thing ever that that apparent did is literally walk their kid up to me and say, hello sir, this is my son. He's not quite sure why you're smaller, but I wanted to come and say hi to you. So he, so he knows that you're, that you're just another human being. And then I went, thank you. Thank you for doing that. Cause then I got to talk to the kid and people think, oh, was the kid, the kid, the kid, he was like five or six.

Speaker 9:          01:37:16       I could've gone with a joke and be like 27, you know, but like, like people freak out about their kids because they think like, they think they have to make up these magical stories for their children. Like, oh, well, you know, um, he, the tooth fairy came and when the tooth fairy shrinks down teeth, they got some dust on that guy. And then he like, he shot like they think that it's like, no, I literally just tell kids when they go, why you little? I go, all right. You see how that person has blonde Terry? So that person has black hair. He goes, that person has no hair. Yeah, some people are really tall, some people are really short. That's all. And they go, okay, that's what you told that like five or six year olds and they go, okay. And that's all you need to tell kids is like essentially the truth.

Speaker 9:          01:37:53       And they're like, oh yeah, yeah. All right. And then cause that's what they want. They want the truth. They want to learn, they want you to get some fancy story. So yeah, the, the, the, the white parents are always more like, ah, he ate gluten. You know, like they like freak out. Uh, Mexicans and Latinos in general say shit but in Spanish because then they see that I'm obviously a gringo and a so they say shit, but it's like I, I know all the words for dwarf. So it's like [inaudible] like I know all that shit. So when I hear those little keywords that's go Kaitlin, you know?

Speaker 9:          01:38:36       Um, and then my favorites are black kids cause they just don't give a fuck. They don't care. They don't care. I'm literally, I'm literally kid walk up to me and be like, what the Hell is wrong with you? It was the greatest thing and I'm just like, yes. Awesome. Good for you. Dad's right behind them. Yeah. What the Hell is wrong with you? I got questions like, why you short as hell man. Genetics, Jesus Christ genetics. I bought crack from that motherfucker laying up like tap and like look at him. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't like that. Like a wheel house. Great. Yeah. That's your wheelhouse. Yeah. Say something to say that I have an answer for everything when it comes to that. Oh, that's why it's always, that's not what I said, but yeah, like that's when someone like does like a real basic heckle.

Speaker 9:          01:39:42       Right. I just kind of look at him like you really think I've never heard that before. What's the thing you hear the most? Oh so like a Leprechaun joke or something. And this is in life or on stage? Both. And on stage. Oh yeah. I've gotten like where's your buttock? Gold from the stage. And I go, it's a, it's at your mom's house after I paid or when I fucked her, cause she's a whore. And then like everyone goes nuts. It's like it's my first time. Yeah. You'd be like, Oh yeah, I'm stumped with the, with the fucking Leprechaun. Haeckel I got nothing. And you just, we've talked about you on this show before. I've heard people have tweeted me and said that you guys say very nice things about me. So thank you. Destroy it. There is no, I know, cause I did a casino with you like many, many years ago.

Speaker 9:          01:40:34       Very bad knob. Oh yeah. It was fucking terrible. But yeah, I mean, I ate a bag of dicks. Jerry did. Okay. And then you went up and I was like, there's no way this guy's going to salvage this. You fucking destroyed the specials. And that told this story. This was salmon. Well, we were, when we did a casino, yeah. Was Colusa casino or then, yeah, I'll be like view me, I think Jay Larson. No. Who was it Larson or was it, what's his name was Larson. Larson was there. You're right, it was Larson. Yeah. And the guy was like, Hey Brad, what do you want these guys to do? I was like, excuse me, we're booked on the show. And he was like, what? He's like, yeah, Brad's been here before. I'm like, yeah, I know, but like Brad didn't bring us, like we got booked to do the show.

Speaker 9:          01:41:20       And he was like, so you'll do 10 and you'll do 10 and brown will take care of the rest were like, hold on a second man. Lately. Dismissive of us. Like I've Jay. And he was like, he's the way, I didn't tell that guy to do that. I 100% okay. I just want that to be clear. One of the nicest people and well that's why everybody is happy for your success because when you're a dick and your success, everyone's like, you can't wait till he fucking falling on space, but everybody is thrilled for your success because you're a good guy. Oh thanks man. Yeah, I'll watch. That was a great show cause like you look back at that show, you're like, oh, those are all like, yeah, back at that time we weren't. But in terms of like they talk about like the uh, draft class, the quarterback class of 1983 with like Jim Kelly, John Elway, like it was a great show.

Speaker 9:          01:42:05       Like it's that it's that kind of thing. We were like, oh, all these guys like went on to do like fucking amazing things before I forget. I did the degenerates together. Yes, we did. Yeah. Coming out in the fall, and I don't know if they're calling it the degenerates or not, but something like that. It's me, you, it's a big Jay Oakerson a young Nigga centers and lies of trainer was the trigger. Trager sorry. Yeah, Dude. This guy though, this guy was like, he was constantly, he was like, Brad, you want to do you want him to go for it? And I was like, dude, what the fuck? He's like, well, you guys know, like you're not closing this year. And we're like, okay, fine. Yeah, but you don't have to keep reminding us that. He's like, yeah, this is Brad show. Ah, fucker. You're going to pass the ball to Coby, right?

Speaker 9:          01:42:53       Like you're going to do Douche douchebags and your audience. I mean, they have to just be eating it after, you know what I mean? Like the guy that yelled at the Leprechaun, oh dude, no one turns that person. He goes, great. Hackle fucking great job. I mean, really? Yeah. You really made the show. But like, that never happens. Sorry, I interrupted you because I'm curious to hear about your life too. So what other things do people say to you that's like so lame? And I mean, like the Leprechaun things pretty constant. Uh, now, uh, now that I'm married there we, we get questions a lot like strange will just walk up to me and my wife because my wife's not a dwarf.

Speaker 9:          01:43:37       Like they've got questions like, like what? Like everyone wants to know how we met. Like everyone's just like, ah, how, how'd that happen? Yeah, that's fucking rude. Cause like, I know what they're thinking and they're like, all right, someone ordered someone. You'd be like, ah, this is a weird, yeah. And then then I have to tell them and that, that freaks them out even more because, uh, how did you, I don't know what he meant. We uh, I met my wife, this is a 100% true story. I was doing a radio gig in San Francisco. Um, I didn't know anyone there. I was living in San Francisco and you were living there. I was living there, there very briefly. I got this rate. I did like four years in a row where I did 48 weeks on the road. I was burned out. Someone said like, Hey, there's this radio gig in San Francisco.

Speaker 9:          01:44:29       Do you want to be a morning show guy? He was like, yeah, what's the money get good. Awesome. I'll take it. So I did it just to get off the road. So to start with this show, I knew no one in San Francisco, so we played this game on the show called Tinder or Grindr where I, where I would flip a coin and based on what it would land on, I would go on either a Tinder date or grinder date. This is how you hope it gets better. So then I did it, did land on a grinder date one time and I did go on one Grindr date with a lovely, a redhead, uh, that we, that he insisted that we just called them ginger bear. I never got his real name. Uh, and he was amazing. He was the best, uh, so caught up or know of course, uh, up up dumb. No, it was the weirdest thing cause like we told them like, hey, you know, Brad's not gay. I'm not gay. Like when that's not gonna happen. This is just the way I can meet people and meet friends and stuff like that. And he's like, yeah, that's fine. And he paid for everything. And like at the end of the night, I'm like, I should probably just jerk this guy off, like I should do something.

Speaker 11:         01:45:26       Aw,

Speaker 9:          01:45:29       yeah. So, um, then a listener called in and said, okay, you guys do Tinder, Grindr, but have you ever heard of this other APP called Thrinder? And we're like, what the hell is then Thrinder and they said, oh, it's Tinder for threesomes. And I'm like, well obviously I should get on that watch. That's an APP. I should be on it again, a Tinder, it's not called Tinder anymore or it's not called Thrinder anymore cause Tinder sued them. So now it's called field f e l d a. So yeah, that's what the name of the APP is. And uh, so I go, yeah, I'll go on this Thrinder APP. That sounds great. And uh, I matched just for threesomes. Yeah. And well, you can go on and match with two singles. You can go on as a couple match with a single. Oh, I got go on as a single match with a couple or you can match with another single and be like, okay, so we gel.

Speaker 9:          01:46:14       So now let's go find the third. Uh, so I go on with the single like let's just baby steps. Let's try it. Deal for a bit. This is for a radio bit or no? Well yeah, this is for a radio bit, but at the same time, my head, I'm like, I want to get a fucking threesome. Okay. So yeah. Uh, that respect. So I went on the APP and uh, I matched with a single woman and we were, and we were like, all right, cool. Let's meet and make sure we're not psychos. And we met and we weren't Psychos, but we work on that APP strictly just for like, let's just hook up. It's a, it's a thing. Yeah. And then at the end of the first day, we're like, we, we, we can't hook up cause this, there was like something here. There was a connection. Yeah. And that's my wife.

Speaker 9:          01:47:02       Two years after that, two years after that, I proposed to her. Wow. I'm on. Yeah. Marijuana threesome out. You dirty fucking filthy hookers. Horse Lot sex ended up, yeah, a couple of slots. And you ended up finding love. How insane is that when sleds find love? Yeah. That's unbelievable. It's so you met, do you tell black people this whole story when was in front of their children? Let me tell you about the birds and the bees. Sometimes the birds and the bees want to add a caterpillar. Yeah, that's how we met. It's an insane story and a, that's remarkable. Yeah. So when people say like, Brad, why are you like, why'd you settle down? It's just like, cause I found a hot Chinese woman that likes three ways. What was I waiting for? Like what's where you're like, oh I'm going to hold off for something better.

Speaker 9:          01:48:04       She met her in San Francisco then. Yeah, Marin, San Francisco. I lasted about not like four months on the radio show. How did you get out of the, don't you have contract? I paid it off. You paid off your contract. I was that miserable. You hit it. What was the worst part? Is it the morning? Not even the mornings. The worst part is that when you're done with the show, you sit down and meeting after the show and some guy who has worked his way up to be program director tells you how to be funny. Oh, that's the thing where he's like, here's what you need to be doing. That's the part where I was literally like, I know I can't do this. I can't have someone who's never been funny in their lives. Help me. Tell me how, tell me how to be funny because of that.

Speaker 9:          01:48:43       Because at that time I was 12 years in and then he'd stand up. Do you have an agent goes make the call for you? Like he's got to go. Yeah, I mean, I, I told the agent, I was like, I'm out. And they're like, it's going to cost to you. I'm like, don't care. Don't care. Give me back on the road giving back. Just write a check to them. They're gone. Go. And uh, how many days a week were you doing it? Five. Yeah. So, and it was, it was the morning show. It was 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM funded it all from 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM was great until you did it. Have Fun doing on the show was fantastic. That was a lot of fun. A lot of fun bits. The people that were on the show were uh, were really talented and that part was amazing.

Speaker 9:          01:49:22       Uh, it's just every other part that sucked like afterward and then finally getting out of all the meetings and show prep at like three o'clock and now you're like, well it's three o'clock. I have about two hours to do something and then I have to go to bed. That's how long you have to be there. W I mean cause after the show then you go to a meeting and you run down the bits that work, especially as a new show. You, you, you went on the bits that work, the bits that didn't, and then you plan the show tomorrow and how

Speaker 8:          01:49:48       do you know it's a radio show? There's no audience that you can actually hear the laughter. How do you know what worked and what did not work? Director is God. And just, and that's why I was like, no, I can't, I can't do it. He goes, you need a live audience. They'll tell you what's funny. Yeah. And we had great reaction on like the phone lines. People would be calling up and be like, this is, this is amazing. This is great. We haven't heard anything like this before. And then like, yeah, that didn't work. Uh, that's not, that's not what you do in radio. It's like, that's a dying medium. So maybe let's not do what you fucking do. You fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you twice. Okay. I would love to see two Hungarian people who know Hungarian still fighting English. Oh man, that's the best part. Your mother queen of Laura's got fucked her ass hole. You'll fuck ass.

Speaker 8:          01:50:47       She prepared me for meeting her mom. Like my mom's wild and I was like, my mom's crazy now. My mom's like real pretty nuts. I was like, sure. And it was like for like a month. And then we went to lunch and she was like, hello? She goes, hi, nice to meet you. And she turns to Christina and she goes, I was at a blooming dads in this fucking cunt. I couldn't. I said, fuck you bitch. You take it back now. And I was like at a restaurant. I was like, oh my God, I was so happy though. I was laughing so hard. Can I tell you that you're the first man I ever brought home that laughed at that shit and that's why we're able to be married. You Know Casey Anthony killed her daughter as she gave you a blow job, right? That's true.

Speaker 8:          01:51:38       That is the other side of this car. Oh Man. Yeah. Cause you see that and you go, oh great, there's another broken toy like me there. You fantastic. Not so much fun. It was fine. Christine, we've got an email that says, did Tina take a monster shit, she looks lighter to Mac. Did you ask me one of my favorite jokes that you ever did? Where you talking about, I didn't know I was pregnant womb to take a shit, but it wasn't as shit to it. Tom was a baby that show, that show was another show that should be on the shot and four channel, 100% and the other show. What's the other one? Dude, we watched it. We got the TLC APP.

Speaker 8:          01:52:31       You can watch a show on the road. Basically the network you're describing, it's like fucking, you know, uh, it's addiction boarding, right? 600 pounds, 600 pounds. And I'm black. Like it'll be combinations of things. Holidays. I'm Mormon and 600 pounds getting those hands and I want to marry three dwarves. It's all these things. So anyways, we're scrolling through. We watched lost in transition, which is about people transitioning like in the middle of their marriage. Like you guys are too old and then you go, I'm a woman. Wow. I was like, what? So it's those. Okay. And these were scrolling through and we see, I still didn't know I was pregnant. So open that up. This is about people who had burr gave birth, women who gave birth, right. Didn't know they were pregnant. Yeah. And then a second time gave birth and didn't know they were pregnant again.

Speaker 8:          01:53:29       Another big shit. And I was like, fuck it. Not Again, not a bad shit again. It was all fog. That's a big shit. Whoa, whoa. What is that? That show is basically the plot of the hangover too, right? Yeah. They're like, this can't happen twice. It's weekend at Bernie's too. Of course. It's every horrible seek or they're like the unbelievable situation that made the first one amazing. Even now it happened again to not know you're pregnant. You have to be so mentally ill or so in denial, like the brain can actually block out a lot of stuff when you're trying to not listen. Christina, why while you tried a woman's playing this shit, let the men talk about how you know you're pregnant. Please Polish Jesus. I mean, I knew nothing about, I know this fucking dumb, broad ideas, words, words like this. Can you imagine not knowing?

Speaker 8:          01:54:23       I mean, you saw me at the very end. I couldn't even, I could barely walk. Like days before you give birth, you were ready to hop in Vegas at the special. That was eight months pregnant. He was shy. Eight months. Yeah. And you were wearing this horror cowgirl outfit. Oh girl. How dare you paint that. Oh, sorry. I thought you meant my dress and I actually wore, I was like, oh no, no, no, no, no. Not that spectacular. And that outfit. Thank you. They put me in a, yeah, it's bad for the Bachelorette party. Yeah. You're a bachelor party. So you were in like a Bret Michaels sparkly pink cowboy hat. Great. We were talking about, by the way, sorry, the, um, you know, people who you see in public on speaker phone and they're like, Hey, no, I'm a, I'm going to walk in now, but what's that?

Speaker 8:          01:55:10       And then you're like, dude, you're on speaker phone. Yeah. And they'll have a full conversation. Yeah. And just how, you know, we should just have bullet to the back of the head. Oh yeah. All of them. The assembly. I don't like that you're on board. No, I don't. Finally, it's weird because there, there's certain things when, here's how, you know, a movie villain is a good villain when it's wrong, what they're doing. But in your head you go, I totally get it right. I totally understand it. It's a great point. So like when thanatos wants to kill half the universe and say, dude, we're

Speaker 9:          01:55:44       fucked up, we, there's too many people and not all of them are good and we just have to wipe that to kill half the people have a horse that's wrong. Right. But damn it that I kind of want that to happen. As you start with India, where does it fit? I'm just saying what did he do? It, it, it, it's random. It's completely random. There's, there's that, there's actually an APP and it's, it's stupid, but you just type your name in and then you hit enter and then it says you were spared by Thanos or you were killed by that. Oh, I was spared just saying it. Ah, so yeah, I, I'd still be here, but us, he's taking no prisoners though. It could be anybody. Yeah. Anybody. Wow. So yeah, and like, so yeah, that's obviously something that should not happen. You should fight to make sure that doesn't happen. But at the same time, if you're one of the ones that stage, you're like, wow, there's a lot less traffic. Nice. This is nice. I saw this. This is my own recording. Okay. Okay. In Starbucks where this guy was eating his breakfast. Yeah, the coffee and we're all just trying to get our coffee. Enjoy your morning. This motherfucker's on hold. Yeah, with Bank of America. Okay. That's it on speaker phone. Puts the phone on speakerphone on the, just on the [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         01:56:56       Taylor. It's him in the red shirt there. Okay. So we all have to listen to his cold. I don't want to hear that shit. Right. Just a total fucking psycho.

Speaker 9:          01:57:09       As we talked about this, those people exist or they watch their videos at full volume or listen to their music. Full volumes. Oh, we, oh, we went to, uh, my wife and I went to a movie and three rows ahead of us. There was a guy like on an iPad and like no headphones and like listening to videos while a movie's going on while the movie's On, while the movie's on, not during the previews, just movies on and he bought out the iPad like no one said anything. No. My, my wife threw a quarter at them and gay older. Nailed it. That's fucking really risky, right? Yeah. But at the same time, what he do, he just got up and like turned around and then sat back down and close the IPAD. It was, it was like a full fucking psycho. I looked at my wife like, I've never loved you more than this moment.

Speaker 9:          01:58:00       Right. Told me a story about a guy who was at a movie theater near him and put his, he put his feet up on the chair. Yeah. Start talking on the phone. Nope. My Dad got a local sheriff walking around and was like, there a guy in there making a problem. I love you said that the sheriff went in there and fucking knock. The guys feed off. The guy's like, get the fuck Outta here. Ah, I love that so much. It sounds like some Florida shit. Right. I was expecting that to go horribly wrong. Like the Sheriff looks at your dad and goes like, hey, you're crazy. You're going, oh no, no, that's, that's awesome. See like, yeah. That's when I just think, and I lit. I

Speaker 8:          01:58:42       literally think that we should develop a birth control in a spray where when you see that you should just be like, eh, that camera and just take that. Not Permanent. It's like, it's like a two week birth control that where it's just like, all right, you know, permanent, white well I think might give them an opportunity Q test administered well listen, well that takes away the Forrest Gump. Like this is what this guy said. He Goes, my name is Collin. Yeah, I was listening to the big you guys recently had about people talking on phones and video calls on speaker without earphones in public. I work at regional trauma hospital and the other day I was working on triage patients in the Er lobby and there was a middle aged woman who kept repeatedly using the voice commands on her phone to call people and then putting the call on speakerphone and loudly talking to them.

Speaker 8:          01:59:32       I have patients coming from motor vehicle accidents, having heart attacks, strokes, all matter of life threatening problems. And she's loudly screaming into her phone about what kind of spaghetti she's going to have that night. So I can't even hear the person in front of me. These are the worst kinds of people. Oh, congratulations on the baby. I'm sorry Tina. But Tommy will always be the water champ. I'm all finished them all done in time for Moose suit by Hitler's Collin from Fort Pierce. Oh, that's wow. Road for me. That is a, that's insane. Like, yeah, if that's the point, like, Hey, this guy is like, oh, I have vitals and they're dropping. And then you've got to hear like fucking Marinara sauce. What's going on, man? You imagine if you're like of like they're coming to you and like saying like, Hey, I'm your husband. Um, do we pull the plug?

Speaker 8:          02:00:23       Like he's not, and all you hear in the background and add some Oregano you, but you're just like, kill him. Just fucking killer. Fucking fucking kill him. Not the past, not the grade at the slice. And they're like, the husband wake up. You're like, kill me. Kill me. I don't live in that world. I want to live here. If I like to batch your Starbucks example, if someone has a piece, if someone calls me and I'm going to Starbucks, I'll leave the Starbucks, leave the Starbucks to take to take that phone call or like just go to my corner or whatever. And like I'm so like hypersensitive to like how my shit could ruin someone else's name. These people don't like how you not, they're just not, they're just not aware of it. They're totally unaware and football season is approaching. We're wondering DTE talk, we taught CTE talk. When does a lot of the preseason started? Yeah. So precision is already gone for four weeks. Um, I just finished the man cave and my house. I'm psyched. Ready? We are talking about, you know, there's a lot of, you know what I'm saying is, and we always keep track of who says, you know what I'm saying a lot. Oh Man. And uh,

Speaker 9:          02:01:40       here we have Tom Brady in a, you know, interview doing a lot. Oh No. Cool. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:01:46       She sounds just walked in. Hi Cutie. Over there. How has being with her enhanced your life? Oh Man. Every possible way. It really has. She's just, um, I couldn't imagine a better partner for me in my life, what I've gone through. Okay, so you both grew up with siblings. She had five sisters and I had three sisters, so it's a lot of women, you know, and it's, you know, she comes from a different country, you know, Dan's to move to New York when she was 17 and you know, we met each other under trying circumstances, you know, like every company work, you know, we love each other, we support each other and we also live in our life and we're trying to find ways to, you know, thing and she's working on, I'm working, there's a lot of things happen on, but how do we always reconnect with one another? It's another one in there, but I believe, you know, like I couldn't find a better woman to, to love me and support me the way she does it all cut together.

Speaker 13:         02:02:56       Good motherfucker right there. You know what I'm saying? Here's the, uh, here's,

Speaker 9:          02:03:00       I'm mad. I'm mad about the setup question. I know we're over. Just goes, oh, has she enhanced your life? Like high blood, everything. Here's the super care. It's a lot of women.

Speaker 4:          02:03:18       No, you know, you know, you know, you know, like, you know, read, you know, like you know it's a lot of your nose.

Speaker 9:          02:03:25       One answer. Yeah, that's solid. I just hate those. Like when you're giving an interview and they, those softball questions of like worst. So is your wife the best woman in the world or in the known universe? We get a lot of, um, is it just jokes all day with, yes. When the baby's shitting and on our faces and we can't control it. She's, you guys run a lot of bits by each other and like, yeah, all day. Every day. As I was pushing our second child out and our first, we had a nurse like this who was like the jokester of the, the nurse Ward. She came out of nowhere and she came over and were like, and at one point I want to be like, can someone get fucking shaky out of here? Because there's time to Joe and Tom and I, we're not joking. No pushing out our child. Like it's not a time do not at all.

Speaker 9:          02:04:26       The worst. The worst thing as a comedian is when you like, cause we have uh, the post office by my house has, I went there to mail a package and then they went, hey, do I know you from somewhere? And they go like, ah, you're a comedian, you're a comedian, you're a funny guy. Like Hey, I'm a comedian. Okay. Yeah. And then they go rich or go over here. He's the funny guy in our office. You guys are going to love, you guys can get along great. And I'm like, this is not a play date. You don't set us up. And like that's the worst when cause then it's the worst for the other guy. I feel bad for the other guy cause he's like probably the funny guy around the office and it's probably good to be like and yeah. And then I'm the professional funny guy and now he's under pressured like Ah Shit.

Speaker 9:          02:05:11       I gotta be funny right now. Like we're professional comedians and we don't like it when someone says be funny right now. That's very nice of you to even think like that. Yeah. Mm hmm. Yeah, it's like that. That's got to suck for that dude. Do you have a, can you weigh in on what you think this means? This is just an image. What is gt? Rtd. All right. Well, first of all, that is Steven Seagal. Yeah. Uh, with a tiny face and a fat head, which is pretty much how it looks now. And that is pretty much, that's pretty much this. Just like pretending, pretending he's not in it. It doesn't have anything to do with Stephen. Yeah. It doesn't have anything to do with upper right. And what do you think that means? Yes. See it. Just go for it. This is, this is a word that I don't, I don't think I'm allowed to say, but I think it's trying to get me to say it.

Speaker 9:          02:06:00       No. Like what's that a word for gay people? That's kind of derogatory. Hmm. I don't see that at all. Yeah, that's what you think. This is the top part. What about the bottom part? Uh, so it's like, get rid of the words I've, oh yeah. Does that, does that reveal a lot of hatred in my person that I see? No, that's interesting. It's like a Rorschach test for it is because different people have different reactions. What, what, what are the reactions have you gotten? Forget that. Tick. I mean, I know first good tongue replaces that dick first. Good tug replaces that. Yeah. Okay. That was it. And then we had, that's a tea RTD was Ri. I'm an idiot. Yeah, no, no, that's okay. Oh, I see what? Yes, I could see that too. Okay. So there's no answer is literally just for great times.

Speaker 9:          02:06:55       Rubbed that Dick. That was one um, fat guy too. He was making these updated to die. Um, let's see. We're good time, right? To Dean Faculty to ride the Dick decays and rape the death. And that's just the words to live by fucking gays and then raped the Daphnis. It's pretty intense. Hold on, I just got done. Fucking the gaze. What do I do now? Okay. The death is Riley. My interpretation of gaze then raped to death. There is no right or wrong. There's no right or wrong. You see and you said get rid of gays. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          02:07:36       Yeah. That's what I saw. And this guy's legit. That might be [inaudible] message. I can say that this was just submitted to us. Sure.
