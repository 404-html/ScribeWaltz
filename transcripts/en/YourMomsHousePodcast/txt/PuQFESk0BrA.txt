Speaker 3:          00:05:01       I thought we were just doing a little teaser. I didn't realize were going to get the whole, the whole thing, the speech on that. I thought it was just like, here's the deal man. That's real quick. Yup. Well I like Alexa saying. Yeah. And especially with the emotion taken out of it, you really get a man, you really get to understand how crazy that guy is. Yeah. And how absurd the, the speech actually is. Oh yeah. With all the emotions have no emotion. No. Just on a verbal, like on the page level, you're like, wow, this guy's really out of his fucking be like reading the car. Like if you're writing a script and being like, yeah, what am I gonna do with these words? Yeah. I'm not sure what choice to make. It's pretty amazing. Uh, I don't know who did that. Do you know who, um, put that together. Oh, no. Shit. I'll, I'll look it up. Okay. Yeah, we should probably, I didn't know you could train Alexa to turn your lights on and off to, what was that all about?

Speaker 2:          00:05:57       Whereas the last

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       episode, Tom is a hard, hard dick. Nick or whatever his fucking name is hard hard shits nick. Shit's nick. Yeah. Taking glass dumps. Yeah. He was um, really something, right? Yeah, man. Try it out. Try it out. Try it out. Your episode is on the beat me all man. Out homie on yet. But you know that now I think about him, the tryout guy. What? Yeah. I think about him like once a week. You should think about it was that was home. You're no, no home here? No. Leon. Yeah. No hold man out as people think it's, I think it's home here now. Yeah. Oh me. No, I'm home. He and now I'm home here now. Yeah. I'm home here now. Uh, but I think about him every now and then and I, you know, what I really think about is how he's managed to be this internet famous and he hasn't reached out to us or like somebody in his life has got to have heard it at some point and been like, Hey, do you, do you know that you're on this podcast and these people are like talking about this video.

Speaker 3:          00:07:07       You May. And he's like, oh yeah, I kind of fucked out. That was silly. Like, what do you think his reaction? Oh God, it would be, oof, it was garlic has it together in any way whatsoever here. Now guy is not, his life is not like, oh yeah, I finally pulled it together and I can reflect back that time. He's getting pissed on and beat on right now. But that's what I wonder too is do you think his dreams came true? Did he get what he wants? Yeah, in some way. I don't think someone moved in did it, but I think, I think someone is, there's probably a couple of ups guys, but like, yeah, I've been in that building. You on that guy beat the fuck out of them. Do you think he found a black guy who likes to flash? Who Likes A and photo? Yeah. Yeah. Black guys at a jail. That has to be the craziest video besides Terry. But even Terry is of sound mind. He's just an exhibitionist. Yeah. Scotty Kay did the lox I clip, so thank you Scotty k for submitted that opening clip. That was really good talent. You got a real, yeah. So a couple of weeks back I shared a bold confession with Eugene. Yeah, I can if I should. I shared the for the first time,

Speaker 5:          00:08:24       Michelle. Fuck it. Oh fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Oh dammit.

Speaker 3:          00:08:34       See that guy's lucid though. That guy is just having a good day. Yeah, that's true. He's cast came too fast. I feel like the guy, the try it out guy, he's trying to improve his life. Yeah. He's looking for the answer. And the answer is black guys who like to fuck and fuck gut. Yeah. Yeah. You know, what was your big confession? Oh, so my big confession a couple of weeks back is we all remember it was a y a matrix inclusive, uh, that I had my very first liquid chart ever, ever in my life. It was a big deal. Yeah. Yeah. And so interestingly enough, this last weekend I ordered the same exact meal that produced the first shirt. Yeah. And what it is, I order from a company called Pizza Rev and I get the cauliflower crust pizza and I order all the meat toppings on there. I get two types of Pepperoni, spicy and regular.

Speaker 3:          00:09:27       I get the Italian sausage and garlic. And what I noticed was because I ate the same thing this time, halfway through my meal, I thought, I think it might be the garlic that's giving me diarrhea. Yeah. And I took off the garlic and lo and behold, yes, I had runny dumps the next day. But it wasn't bad. It wasn't as bad as it was before. And I think it's because of the garlic. That's my, my hip hop. Sure. What are you thinking? Uh, I think it's really neat. I had a sharp scare. Your kid in Washington, a scarer legit sharp. Well, here's what happened. So, wow,

Speaker 1:          00:10:02       I'm on the bus or about to get off the bus to go into the theater. I'm, I fart. Like I'm going to rip it this far right now. Yeah. And I'm like, that's more than a fart. And I panic because you don't shit on the bus. So I learned to like shuffle over to the theater. I dropped trout and I realized I don't see anything in the underwear. I'm like, God. But like I don't check my butt cheeks. I just sit on a toilet, but a disaster come out. Yeah. Well, here's the thing, I, I started having like a couple other loose ones after that. I'm like fuck. And this is like an hour before the show, the first show. So I asked them for Pepto, I, he's drink some pepto drink a little soda. You don't try it on. Yeah. And then I'm okay. I do the first show, I forget about it, I forget about it. Then I'm in the green room with Jeff Tate and I go check this shit out. Ha fart. And I feel

Speaker 3:          00:10:58       the same thing I might because I forgot sketchy asshole. Oh yeah. And so that's scary when you forget

Speaker 1:          00:11:08       a little more comes out. And again, I got lucky with the underwear. I didn't get any underwear but yeah, I was, it was definitely and I think I can check out what it was, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:11:17       Yeah. Well it's probably just a road week cause you were on the law. A lot of different cities. Bacteria, cause I often forgot about my shark too and I would fart in the kitchen again. Like oh I better not now. I don't want to, I'm not going to write out who in this office, but somebody here also had a sharp, they know they would prefer their identity. You know, there's a lot of charters here. And it occurred to me that because there's so much happening, it's kind of a short week here. It is for our week. Yeah. Yeah. It's rare that there's a guest coming in who I'm sure has. Sure. If you told me to bet on it, I'd be like $1 million. Let's ask him. He comes in, how many sharks he's ever had. Well, should we get into who's here and what, what we've been talking about? Of course, man. Um, um, we have the great, uh, Bert Kreischer is going to be joining us here. Um, very funny, very funny. Also very fat as we all know and very racist and we've been looking at pictures of him. Oh my God, that's him at the store. Gene. That's him at the comedy store during the main room. He's shirtless. And that to me yesterday or the day before to oo four, that is not at snap. Now. His belly is so distended, swollen, like an African child starving African version or him, we will give birth.

Speaker 3:          00:12:37       All right. Ooh Boy, that's a big fat. No Sunday at the last or like a week ago in Vegas, he posted that. I was like, Jesus, he's so fat now. Do you think Burness better now than he was before you guys? Weight loss competition. Mm. Clothes is clothes. It's not good. Whatever it is. You know what's crazy though about his body? You can tell that he's meant to have like a rad body because, do you see like his cutlines Joe, what I'm saying like his hippo. It's, it's weird because he still has like chiseled doesn't wear underwear. Yeah. He never does because he has that sensory basically looking at a naked guy with a cloth. Yeah. Yeah. But do you see what I'm saying? Then he's got that hipbone yeah. Like Ryan Gosling has that. You should tell him that. He'll be like, Yo, look at that guy in the front row with the arm folded. Yeah. He's looks guys discussing, hey, just sit here. He's fat too. He's like, who's fat? Burger meat.

Speaker 3:          00:13:44       Um, so we, um, we were looking at like who, because we remember when this all started and the whole fashion thing started when we were talking about that he kind of looks like Gerard dip our toe, right? Cause he had, he had like naked scenes in this movie, but then paper it has a new look now and I think he looks more like these guys. Like there's Dennis Hoff. That guy kind of has Burt's vibe. Well here's why though is because Burt's face is getting redder and redder and swollen. It looks like I'm right there. I think he really looks like, like this guy in that, uh, there's candle to me. He uh, why he kicked it getting Delphinia. There's this other piece that's Birtle hundred percent the smile, you know, like the energy and the essence. I feel like you put a beard on that guy. Does Burt? That is Bert. Yeah. Who's he with? Wow. Oh, who's he with? An author. You don't know who that is? That's JK Rowling. She wrote the Potter series.

Speaker 3:          00:14:56       Pulitzer prize. Or somebody could put Burt's head on that photo. That would be great. Here's Harrisburg, too bad. TMZ hasn't caught on and they're not covering it in detail and some fat there. Fini my favorite to this day. Soprano's I mean, I love that show and he's so talented. This dude, God dammit. Um, when do you think Burt's is going to die? Oh, Jesus. Don't go there. I mean, God, well, no, I mean, let's be realistic here as my friend. I don't want him to, he's my friend too, and I care about him and that's why I'm being a little harsh because it's like that. Huh?

Speaker 3:          00:15:43       Just like that. Yeah. Because here's the deal, man. Here's what I'm thinking. Yeah. This new, uh, bus life that he's embarked on has probably made it a lot easier to party. We, we've gotten into it. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Oh yeah. Yeah. He told me, he's like, we got a grill for his bus. I think I grilled company gave him one. He was like, we smoked meats and we drink until it for every night. Oh, I love him so much. And I, I don't, you know, I don't want him to lose him, obviously. Of course. That is not up to us. You can only try so many times. You know you can't, it's, it's up to him. Chuckleheads laughing. I don't know. Why are you laughing at Blue van? I Dunno what's going on. What's going on? I'll stop. Um, should we, uh, should we go ahead and take a break and one of them taking a shit in our bathroom. Let's ask him about those charts. We will in just a moment. We'll be back to talking about

By the way, my body's reacting. I'll probably shit my pants. Oh, interesting. Hey, your mom's house exclusive. This is short week and we were going to ask you if you have any excellent sharp charted on my bus over the weekend. I sharted in bed with Leanne yesterday. No pants on, shorted onto the sheets and then had to run, you know like tippy toe it into the bathroom and then judge rifled it out. Hold on. I'm going to, so the night before I was Vegan for a while. Describe a while. Everyone has this kind of subjective roughly three days. Okay. Roughly three days with a few cheap meals.

Speaker 6:          00:22:25       That's good. Ryan. No. It's part of the way that told you that the health book you're writing. No, we were, I was drunk at an airport. Felt like you were going to vomit. Right. I was drunk at an airport. How? I'm fucking sweating now. I was drunk at an airport and I was like, I bet I can go fucking Vegan. And they're like, you couldn't go Vegan? I go, yeah, I can. I can do it. Everything I put my mind to and so we get on the plane and I'm like, fuck it. I'm going Vegan. I'm going to lose some weight and go Vegan, so drink a double Tito's and soda. She brings me a beer with it and then lunch comes around. I go, what do you have? Meat and pasta. It was Ernie cheese on the pasta and she goes, no. I said, is there any meat on the pasta?

Speaker 6:          00:23:04       She goes, no. I said, I'll go with the pasta. So the guy next to me, he's kind of watching me, he gets to meat and we start eating. And he goes, hey ma, what are you like allergic to cheese? I go, no, I'm Vegan. And he goes, really? I said, yeah. He goes, you know, there's AG imposter, right? And I go, I didn't know that. He goes, how long have you been eating pasta? I go, my whole life. It goes and you call yourself Vegan, this is what's wrong with you people. And he starts fucking jumping into my lifestyle choice on an airplane. By the way, he didn't know, I've only been Vegan for like 45 minutes. Tell him I just kept eating the pasta and then order to an ice cream Sundae in bed with Leanne my, my stomach. Okay. So after three days ago a my stomach got really kind of, uh, not as toxic as has been like all my shit's come out back of the bowl up under the toilet seat and the ones where you got to wipe your legs cause it splashes up sometimes.

Speaker 6:          00:24:01       Yeah. And so, um, but I mean that's like his regular morning. That's Tuesday, Monday morning. Shit, it's Tuesday. And so I go and uh, I start, I go right out of veganism, veganism, a rec tech sent me a travel smoker. So I go right into Veg, out of veganism into a fucking brisket and it just fucked my stomach. Yeah. I just wolf like animal fat and all her right after my Tampa show me in cow head, Dave Williamson just in Fez Watley sat at the back just eating brisket and then the next day I was just shitting like crazy. So then you meet up in Vegas and your wife goes there and you drank. I'm sure we did bottomless Mimosas when I landed. Then did the show you had the bottomless mimosas until like four o'clock once. See before o'clock show wasn't until 10. Oh Wow. Yeah. And so, but I, my stomach was just racked and then the next morning we woke up, I don't know what I ate or drank that night, but the next morning and World Cup and I thought it was a fart and it just shit on my butt cheeks and then had to carry it into the bathroom.

Speaker 6:          00:25:05       Yeah. Like wanting like a little here. We're like one of those egg spoon races in the new fare. Ooh Shit. No she didn't. She know I shit my pants right before I went on stage in Fort Lauderdale and my camera man was following me and I shit my pants right before I want to stage and then it was fire coming out of my ass fired, you know, like you know when you eat spicy food in your lipstick hot, that was happening to my asshole. And so I shoved an ice cube up there and like, uh, like a suppository to cool it down. You know, cause I'm figured something was hot and then I couldn't get it out and I had to go on stage with an ice cube up my ass and it was literally dripping out of my asshole there. No, I know. I know you shit in your pants right before you go on stage in Fort Lauderdale and sit my butt cheeks.

Speaker 6:          00:25:52       I didn't Shit my pants. I shipped my butt cheeks. Wipe it up. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I clean it up before you perform, you perform the whole hour with shit in your no, but I have done that before. Oh my God. Yeah. You're savage. Dallas, Texas. Christella Alonzo is supposed to go and do 20 minutes and she can all can shoot you could do is like seven [inaudible] this is a long time ago and so she does seven minutes and I'm shitting and I hear my name couldn't proud. I didn't even wipe, I didn't even know why. Couldn't have time to wipe it. And I was like, oh. And I had to perform a shit. My pants the long hour. Oh, where as this said, I have, hold on one second. Hold on. Now that we're talking about this in lieu in Kentucky, in Louisville, no night tell you, what did I tell you before he came on, which I'm actually, I tell good if somebody said, do you think bird has short story give, I'll give you $1 million.

Speaker 6:          00:26:43       We were in Lexington, Kentucky, at Brook comedy off off Broadway, and I realized I had to take a shit in the middle of my hand. I brought the comic up. I said, some will put a timer on the clock. I'm going to bring the other comic up. Dusty sleigh. He's going to do you counted off. I'm going to go run off stage shit and come back. I Bet I can do this in under two minutes. I was back in a minute. Now why I push, I push. I'm a big pusher. You pushed a little too hard. A lot of times when I shit, it's about art. It's like a bouncer kicking out. People that have a club at 2:00 AM just let's go, let's go. He think Ari's Asshole is a fucking pictures of his ship seen on the Internet. No, he also sends us, he group Texas pictures of his, uh, of toilet paper just soaked in blood.

Speaker 6:          00:27:32       Oh my God. He's like, oh, I just pulled this out of my ass. He's the reason I put an ice cube up my ass. Cause he shoves, wads, plugs of toilet paper up his asshole to stop the blood from coming here. And he's like, and we're like getting their surgeries like, yeah. Doctor said it's not really worth it. So anyways, uh, later on doesn't really think it's, it's got a Tesco hanging out of his asshole. Yeah. Like yeah, he's got a hemorrhoid testicle out of his ass. Like a, it's like a ball, right? It's just a hemorrhoid, but it looks like a nerd. It's like a fuck sleep. It's like he got railed for months and years in his asshole. It's got a pink sock. Just kind of, okay. So wait, when you cleaned up though, those ones one, when those ones happen, it's so easy to clean up.

Speaker 6:          00:28:20       Just real quick. Spit on the toilet paper. Wipe your ass. I'm out. That's what your dad does called Mississippi wet wipe my specialty. I do it a lot now dude, you got, well I used to not do it and then you know we get like the fucking bed days at home or just game changers. Then you travel again and you feel like, what does it, the 14 hundreds I'm wiping my ass with pay. It's like going from private school to fucking Gen pop in a public school. Yeah, I do. It's like, no. Yeah, you're like, I'm better than this. So then you start spitting on your pay. It actually makes a big difference on your toilet paper holding it out. Let me tell you how to do it. Spilling your toilet paper right on your finger where your finger is on the toilet paper. Right?

Speaker 6:          00:28:58       And then just take it. It's just one wipe. You're not going back and forth. Just one wipe gently to just kinda just get everything off like a cursory go dry, then go one more spin and then it, I don't mind the wet idea, but why can't you just reach to the sank like board? It's the same reason you don't use water when you jack off, you spit in your hand and Jack off or you know what I mean? It's spit is got a little more lubrication to it. A little more viscosity. So when it rubs chasse drafts, we'll saying nice. He kind of knows what he's talking about. I've been spinning on my toilet paper for eight years is still sexually attracted. That was the best day of very certain about that. No, no. She sees you as like a nice guy, but I'm home sometimes cash cow on the road.

Speaker 6:          00:29:48       Yeah. It's like a rods agents. They're like, I don't care if he's using steroids. Have you seen my bucket new? She's just like, when are you leaving again? Like going like if she does she get like a platinum card. She was like, this is kind of fun. Oh really? Shopping now, you know she's doing, I'll tell you right now, looking at houses. Oh, looking at houses and just, I mean just the fucking modest woman you met fucking 15 years ago, you wouldn't unrecognizable. Unrecognized. It's my favorite thing. She, that new truck we got, she was not wanting to get it. Oh it's too expensive. It's so silly. And then she got it. She goes, this is my favorite thing we've ever owned ever. She goes, I've really feel like I'm driving around in luxury and I'm driving so much picking up George at softball and islet school play practices.

Speaker 6:          00:30:35       One on, she goes, she goes, this makes me feel like driving's not that bad. And I go, you should get treats in life. That's why I don't understand. I've just been trying to work this bit out of my life and my act and I can't figure it out cause I got, maybe people don't relate to the way my brain works. But if you don't have treats in life, what life's not worth living. Like I don't understand the guy that lives treat lists that they just go your treats all day though. Yeah. But that's yeah, be concentrates and I have a low threshold for reward. I'll give you that. But, but guys who deserve treats that don't get him. What's the point? Yeah. Like I used to think and all that. If you can afford it, that's the caveat. If you can afford it, get the treat.

Speaker 6:          00:31:08       If you can't afford it, don't get the fucking tree. And it was just, it should making your treats onto like, uh, on, on like a sliding scale. I've been treating myself my whole life. I have, I, like I said, I definitely think I earned treats when I don't earn them, but my treats, I've never, they haven't like, gotten outrageous. It's just like a new car. Like why not have a new car? We had a car that was 10 years old and was breaking down like lamb broke down on Ventura. I go, what the fuck? We can afford a new car. Let's treat ourselves. Yeah, you deserve it. Tommy's captain treat over here. Oh, he's taught by placing, I'm more likely an where I grew up in the communist Cold War and I didn't treat myself to shit and he's taught me how to enjoy life. But here's the thing, you guys go blow it up.

Speaker 6:          00:31:51       Both of you taught me how to treat myself because I remember we were talking like, I was like, I want to get the hands on. They want to get something nice. You can go. Oh Tommy just gets it for me. Just for me. Yeah. In Vegas this weekend we're doing bottomless mimosas. There's like a mall by the Aria and I go, that's my tree. And that was my trip by the way. No, she got sick. She got sick. The shakes from him. And so we go to the thing and I just disappeared. I got myself a treat and I bought the treat. But you gotta tell the streets, come on my treats silly. It's okay. He was a drunk and treat. Okay. What was it? It was a Gucci Fanny Pack. That's the family. Awesome. It was good to push. I think you had one on him. He got me. One is a push present child years and I was like, Oh Gucci, Panty peg.

Speaker 7:          00:32:41       This is all so silly. Yeah. Oh cause it's such a silly item. And then to get a designer silly, it's like whooo. This

Speaker 6:          00:32:51       all the toe it all through Vegas. Yeah. I had it filled with all my merchant cash, so it was like stacks up cash. So then I went to Tiffany's and I bought land and Nicholas not super expensive, but it's just a nice necklace. Nicely. You Man. I see you soon. Oh, I like it. It's really nice. Enjoy it. Good. Yeah. Cause you're going to die one day. You May as well enjoy, you know, the benefits, right? Me. What are we getting this house man? Yeah, let's talk about it. We looked at one. Yeah. Yeah. It was a little out of our price range, but I thought, I thought, you know, roll the dice on life. Now, if we had had, um, it was at the foot of Fryman Canyon. Uh Huh. I can tell you the, I should probably shouldn't have it on the Internet. It was at the foot of Fryman Canyon had had a dinner.

Speaker 6:          00:33:36       It was really nice. It was an old house. I was part of a compound, so all the houses around it and was like excluded. You couldn't get, that's cool. But a weight, it doesn't matter. He'll put it on Instagram anyway. Yeah, definitely. That's why we got to move. I gotta get out of my fucking house now. Everyone knows where I fucking law. Really? How that happened. Me Describing things in my neighborhood, all my podcast people like a jack in the box. Huh? I think I figured out where you live. Your crazy with that. I didn't. I was before we knew that anyone listened to these fucking things. Yeah. I just, I overshared. I've overshared way too much in my life. Like that's where you guys have done a really smart job and I tore a board, Georgia and Eila didn't even ask and I talked about their periods on Conan. Yeah. Yeah. That's funny though. I left the period party. You described those lovely. Imagine if your island, you've got to go to school the next day and it goes viral and little Jason. Huh? You named me period. Jason. She's like, I don't know who you are.

Speaker 6:          00:34:33       Yeah. Four girls. So let's say this though. We made fun of my tour bus. Yeah. You know, and my picture with my tour bus. Yeah. Uh, what about the body shots world? Hitler did nothing wrong. This is your thing. Jeez. Who does voiceover for you? That's a, my guy Jake. He's great. He's a really good voiceover artist and he is too bad. It's all anti me. No, no, no. He's got some other stuff. Oh, cool. Wait to see it. Yeah, no, that's great. If you're listening, it's just, that was just burnt on a Nazi train. Just to be clear. Yeah. Of what we were, oh, the I pull up, hang on. No, hit pause. Hit pause. Yeah. Pull up the one that's titled Birders are racist. MP Four. I'm dying to see this. What we'll see. We'll see it in a bit. Let's see what this is.

Speaker 5:          00:35:44       Cleveland's, Oh my goodness. Daimler, you're in there. Right there with him shirtless. Wow. What was he like? Not that bad. Really? Well, very artistic. Yeah. This is actually good footage. I know. All right. Okay. The body shots world tour, Hitler did nothing wrong.

Speaker 6:          00:36:21       Wow. You got your whole logo on the side of the plane there? Yeah. Cool. That's not bad. You know, Ron White had done that to his plane, so I feel like I'm in good company. Yeah. That's pretty cool. How much would you like to get a plane, dude? Is that the next step? Almost got one to find me home from Vegas yesterday, but it was $6,000 and I can't write my head and I wrapped my head around that. Yeah. Like I was like, I was like, I thought it would be like, I literally thought it'd be like two grand and I was like, I could do that. I can, I can just go like, fuck it. I had a bad night of the casinos can gamble much. Yeah. Um, but yeah, I can't, I don't know. I'm never gonna be able to be able to do that whole thing.

Speaker 6:          00:36:54       It's crazy. I don't like flying though either. So that's the other thing. Wouldn't buzz life has really enabled your lifestyle choices. Dude, it's me. I'm so much healthier on this fucking boss than I've ever been. Let's talk about it. Uh, it's great because here's what we know. I was trying to figure out like why I'm not getting hung over and I'm not getting fucking super wasted at night. It's because you're going into the tour bus and drinking. It's, it's kind of like drinking at your house and so then you go, I'm tired, I'm going to bed. As opposed to what normally happen on the road as you go, you have to club and then everyone would go ends up at a bar and then you're at a bar and everyone's like, all right, we're going to go. And you're like, one more, would you get one more?

Speaker 6:          00:37:31       And then you get what? You go back to your place. Maybe open one there and for here you just get like you go, I'm going back to my room and you just go to sleep. So I loved it. That are you sleeping better? Asleep. Fucking amazing. Yeah. I think we have, I don't know what kind of matches you have, but it's one of those like fits your body like your tempurpedic. Like it's kind of like a Lisa mattress. He's got one of those like it goes up and down on the tour bus. Oh yeah, me too. Me Too. That it is not one light those up right next to his chocolate fountain. Do you have a chocolate fountain on your mouth? No. Do you really not have two bathrooms though? No, we have two bathrooms. Okay. Yeah. I was like what the fuck? No. Do we do shit in your tour bus?

Speaker 6:          00:38:12       No, we don't sit in our tour bus. Can I tell you the invention I came up with? You made an invention? Yup. It's called toilet condom. Okay. What you do? Oh, it's like a hot bag. Yeah. Yeah. You take it and you put it around the seat. Yeah. And then it's got like a little thing here but you shit into this bag as soon was almost with a reservoir tip. So you ended up in the reservoir tip so then you can just bag it and throw it in the trash. Yeah. Yeah. I mean people do. Yeah. Yeah. They called

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       hot bagging. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Yeah. They just shit in the bag on the bus. Oh boy. You just buy like a $2 million bus like Brian Regan and then you can just shit on your bus. Why is he, cause he has the state of the art. They have like a grinder and all types of crazy shit done his back. I will do it too. I would do a TV show based on tour buses of obsessed with tour buses. I mean the really nice ones are really nice. Like, Oh, like I think mine is probably low end. My, okay. So I have four different tour buses. Yeah. Because I didn't, there's weeks where it doesn't make sense for like when I'm doing tampon Lauderdale I'm like, I don't want a tour bus for that week that um, yeah, I'm like a, I don't want a tour bus for this a week where I have a Portland, Maine and then I have just fly to fort on to the next day. Or you're going to drive? I don't know. I don't know yet. Oh, see for me driving it makes it easier on my stomach. Like I just got, I mean I probably will. That's a three, three and a half.

Speaker 1:          00:39:33       So what I'm saying is, so those weeks don't like, but then I have weeks where it definitely makes sense because of the way those companies work. I was able to get like quotes from different companies for all the different runs, compare them all and then I pulled the trigger on the nicest one for a couple runs. So I'm going to see what it's like, what the differences for that bus. That bus is state of the art though. Okay. I want to it. I might hop on your tour for that, but that bus is like, it's way more than really. Yeah. Then like the one I'm on now, the guy, so the guy goes, uh, you know, when you like, you know, if you're at a restaurant and you might order something and you're like, this doesn't, I don't know if this is a, this tastes right, but you'll second guess yourself because you're like, I don't really complain about the way something tastes.

Speaker 1:          00:40:23       You know, like you're like, I don't want to make a thing of it. Right. So you go like, and then you eat and you're like, no, something's wrong with this. So like on the one of the first, like second night on this bus, I was like, man, I feel like it's fucking loud back here. Like really loud, you know? So then I'm like, we were at the neck, we're in the next city. And he's like, how was it back there? And I was like, well, I gotta be honest, man. I don't want to complain about it, but it does seem pretty loud. And he goes, yes, they need to train new transmission.

Speaker 1:          00:40:57       I go like, do you know this? He was like, Oh yeah, I told him, you know, and they, uh, they rotated the tires, they replaced the rear axle, but she's got some miles on her and she really needs some work. And I was like, so does this happen soon? Or one second does. He's like, yeah, I don't know. I'm like, okay. And then it was like that. It was like, Hey, this water didn't really heat up. He's like, yeah, the plug came. And I told him the soundbar also came to attached in this TV's not working anymore. And I'm like, so when like do I, do I deal with this? He was like, yeah, just till it's fixed. Oh my God. Fuck that. I know. But I mean, you know, [inaudible] got Wifi, egg, then the Wifi, the guy. Here's the thing though, what a difference. Like a nice, like great driver makes the guys the best and um, you know, it's not like, it's not that big of like, I fall asleep, I get up, we're in the next city. I'm like, I don't care man. Yeah, you're sleeping anyways. Yeah. I'm like, it's not that big of a deal. There's shit like, like when the soundbar did work on the TV, the sound bar was dope. Like, like you could watch movies and like I was, I was digging that, but for the most part this bus has been falling dude. And they'll fix it. Probably as I hop on that other bus,

Speaker 6:          00:42:19       I want to see what it is. I wouldn't mind splurging in order to get mine. I had to have it for the whole three months. Yeah, that makes sense. Good. I wanted to wrap it, which might have been a miss couch.

Speaker 1:          00:42:28       No

Speaker 6:          00:42:31       move. It is son Joseph said to me last night, he goes, cause Yo, what's up? Did you fucking rapping it? And that kind of like, I couldn't do that man. I'm too low key. I go, Yo, I don't think I would do that again in the future. Although I know I now will cause it's dude, it is literally people just knocking on the door

Speaker 1:          00:42:48       gotta be shitting. I come in, it's burden there. And they're like, yeah, he's sleeping. Wait, wake them up. Somebody. They know we're doing these ridiculous post to each other. My boss was in DC, we'd driven through, mind you, jersey, Pittsburgh, since he Cleveland land in DC, it's filthy. And they wrote tour bus champ and the dirt. Are you serious?

Speaker 6:          00:43:13       The Aye. Aye. Aye. Getting the face on it. The first night I realized it was like there's people waiting outside the bus and you was trying to get into the venue and I was like, oh, this is a horrible fucking idea. And then knowing that people that know that that's where you are, I wasn't comparable Dan by 10 by, by the time we got to Tampa regionally and Atlanta, I loved it. I was like, well it started being like people were taking pictures of them outside the bus and I thought that was cool. Like people would rip their shirts off and take pictures outside and I was like, oh, that's awesome. And then, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:43:45       and then it never wear a shirt again. I know you're Korean, you're going to be hopefully 80 years old and you're going to have to be like the shortlist of the geriatric. Get Soggy. Ladies and gentlemen. Any of the other machine. How long ago was that was that was yesterday. Was it yesterday? That was yesterday. I think if I just did sit ups. The Bu's has nothing to do with it. The sit ups and then where's your, where's your, uh, where's the one underneath it? That's your Vegas picture. Jesus Christ. How many beers in my worry? You know you had the, what's the shirt is that

Speaker 6:          00:44:29       it says a gator belts melts. Eldorados Monte Carlos and Eldorados is from the beginning of this fresh, so fresh and so clean. Oh, that's your boy. Big Boy. Big Boy. He's my buddy. That's your dog. I remember that. Yup. It's really cool. Everyone lightened him up with the m word anytime he comments on an Indian. Yeah. Some people don't get the joke. That's what kills me about it. It's like some people get the joke and it's funny, some people really don't have a sense of humor. It's like, it's almost like watching Lenny from of mice and men play with animals. They're like, oh, and then you're just like, oh man, you're not doing this right at all. The nuance of the whole thing. Someone painted a picture of outkast and they're like, Hey, I made this poster for your boss. And so I had to buy only place.

Speaker 6:          00:45:09       I have it as like a big picture of outkast above my bed. It's weird. Very weird. Yeah. Hmm. Um, do you have those pictures of like the lookalikes. So remember how we had Gerard Depardieu at one time? Don't you think you kind of looked like this and this off? No. You don't think you'd look at him? What about him in the white shirt though? Well, there's Gandel feet. No, not even remotely in the smile and energy. Not even close. No. No, but put a beard on him. No. You kind of have his build a little bit. You have right there. I do not. He looked like that. That was a week. And we're like that. Then I lived like that last night and he let her men goes, uh, she touches my belly. She goes, Oh yeah, that's right. I forgot you were fat. She goes, but you're like hard fat.

Speaker 6:          00:45:59       Tom's like a soft fat, right? And I'm like, yeah, he's just, he's a gentle fat. Yeah. I had done, it's off all my podcast. It was a long time ago when it was just me doing all the audio and stuff. So I bring him to the podcast. I started the podcast. He brings a girl with him and the first thing he says is, show him your pussy. All my couch, like, she like took her pussy out on my couch and I'm like, there's a leather couch like to fucking ruin the leather. You know? That's Nikki Haley, the former UN ambassador. That woman right there, there was no, yeah, she, I don't think that's accurate. That's, that's who she is. Yeah. She's going to do a speaking tour pretty soon. Cool. Huh? Yeah. Yeah. I can't wait to hear what she has to say. Wait, God gave her vocal cords to you don't think you look like that?

Speaker 6:          00:46:44       No, not at all. Gonna look like that. No, I hate when I go. I hate when I see, you know that Guy Vance Heinz is almost skinnier than me now. This is pretty great. It's probably way, hold on. I have to, okay, we're going to make fun of this, but I have to say at the very beginning, he's putting an amazing fucking work to get where he is. Of course, I'm not like, I'm going to, we're going to make jokes about it, I'm sure. But like I am so impressed with this guy's fucking mindset. You don't know anything about this Van Times gone. Okay. It goes back to the original weight loss challenge, right? This is when I know, I think it goes to sober October. Go sober October because of that weight loss challenge. He, he started his weight loss journey right in November, I think a full year ago.

Speaker 6:          00:47:27       Okay. Okay. So a, a little or more, more than a year ago now. But, uh, I said on the podcast, I said I could run a marathon in under five hours, which I did and I ran it and five 33 but yeah, in building up to the marathon, I ran a half marathon and Vance Hines, listen to the sober October, listen to the fat shaming, listen to all that. But he saw me run the half marathon and then literally it was like, well, fuck, if Burt can do that, I can do something. And so he started trying to work out. He was 475 pounds and today he's like 42 to 50 wow. Amazing. He looks amazing. But then he came and did my podcast with Diamond Dallas page in Atlanta at the Tabernacle, by the way, fucking tabernacle. It's awesome. It's the weirdest venue in the entire world. Did you know that was all white church?

Speaker 6:          00:48:13       He has a, it was a baptist church is all white church. I thought it was an old black church. No, I didn't know that for us it was baptist. Yeah. And I said to them, I go, so this used to be an all black church and they go, no. I said, what do you mean they go, it was a white church. And I was like, well, it's the tabernacle. And they're like, yeah, do what? What part of the 19 hundreds do you think they let black people come in here? And I went, oh yeah. Oh yeah. And they go to BC, Martin Luther King's church. It's like a box. Do you think they had this one too? And Martin Luther King chose to preach in a box. I was like, oh, I never even realized that. They're like, yeah, this was primarily filled with racist white people. I don't want, Oh, that makes us very different from me in my heart. And so, um, that came out wrong. And so, but uh, but Valentine's and Diamond Dallas page comes in, uh, and he was like, brace to 200. Let's see, you can get to 201st. And I was like, I'm never going to fucking catch you

Speaker 3:          00:49:02       to 200. So what? I mean, so the guy that, how far from you? I started off, by the way, hold on, hold on. How far from 200 Reu,

Speaker 6:          00:49:10       right? Like a solid 40, 50, 17. I can tell you right now on my winnings APP. Okay. I wait in this morning on my wedding zap. I don't look at it. It just registers to my phone. Oh. Oh, you don't look at it? No cause I want to track it, but I want to track it. I want to see it when I'm skinny. I don't want to see it now. So my app, I can weigh on the scale goes right to my phone and you don't have to take a look. It doesn't have to fuck with your day. Yeah. Yeah. I just go. Great. Affect your behavior in any other weddings. Apple. My winning scale on my bus and in my house. Okay. Two 45.8 okay. So, but I was two 45.9 yesterday to 50. Uh, February 14th. So, so you're going down, you're going down, but what, so what are you doing lot of diarrhea that helps. I am no. Can I be honest with you? Push. I have no fucking idea how to lose weight. Yeah. Even when I, I've lost weight, I just do it. And like this psychotic, psychotic, manic kind of way. I don't do it in like a health.

Speaker 3:          00:50:12       Yeah. And you don't have a method, but if you, if you, okay, let's talk to Joe. No. Can he make a method for you and could you stick to it? If someone wrote down here's what you're going to do, this is what, this is the routine. Could you have a routine and stick to it?

Speaker 6:          00:50:25       Yeah, I can be. I can be obsessive compulsive but the problem is I'm not hyper obsessive. Yeah, hyper obsessive. But the problem is is when we lost all that weight, I stayed in the two twenties for a full calendar year. Full year. Now we were both in the two twenties for your, I know you're probably still around what, two 30 yeah, but like we were in the two twenties for a full fucking year cause when we did sober October we did our weigh ins at your house when we went to party at your house afterwards and we were almost exact same size. Wait. Yeah. I don't know why. I don't know what's going on and just all of a sudden it just balloons up. I get really, I don't think it's that confusing actually. I get pretty, I get pretty like I get off the rails sometimes.

Speaker 6:          00:51:05       Like I'm like deep dish pizza. I think Baird, I think part of it too is the fact that, look, you're a celebratory guy. Yeah. You're a fun guy. You're killing it on the road. Yeah. You deserve treats. There we go. Now we're talking like my inner dialogue here, away from your family. Let's hear about a strip club at second. So vixens Fort Lauderdale, he just, and uh, um, you know, you're, uh, you're the good time guy so you don't have treats in your head. Like when you get done a show, you don't go, I wonder what I get to treat myself with. I mean sometimes yeah, but your treat, um, we'll see. Here's the thing. I have a way, it's not even like a party thing or aversion to it. It's just like I've just, look, I'm just not wired to be a big drinker. So you, so you go, now I get to be alone in a dark room.

Speaker 6:          00:51:59       I do like that. But I mean most, here's, here's most of my, the second show is over. Okay. Yeah. So I go back in that green room. So hold on, let's, let's, let's walk through our for you. Do two shows. So your first show, no booze, I'm sure. Right? Definitely coffee. Yeah. Okay. Me Too. A Cup of coffee. We're going to stage no booze for a show and might bring a bureau, but I won't touch it. I can show I bring a a cocktail, bring a coffee, cocktail or beer out. Yeah, never. And when I say what I say when I was 22 years old, I got involved the Russian mafia. Here's how it happened. They cheer and that's when I start drinking. That's my first drink of the night because my eyes and I told her the machine story every night. Then you have like 10 minutes, 14 minutes.

Speaker 6:          00:52:36       And I get it. I get it. I'll get a little bit of a buzz. Oddly enough, I know that people think that I wouldn't, but even in that 14 minutes, just having a few sips, I catch a little bit of a buzz. But you're also like you're doing the, uh, like almost like a performance of a play. They know, you know, so I get that. I, um, I never drink ever during shows before, during I just in my head, I can't drink before it makes me, we did it in Vegas. We tried to Mimosas and I'll do it on like an overnight flight. I'll drink that evening. But I, I can't, I have to be sober. I can't be having beers getting on stage. I just give a shitty show. I usually have, I'll have a drink after shows once or twice a week. Whoa. And usually it's maybe one drink. Sometimes it's too, this is what he do after the shot. So, but I mean, all right, so because we're both on buses, it's basically like this,

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       it's like if I'm, so the second show will end, I'll go to the green room. Uh, whoever's with me, we'll be hanging out in their music. I have like a speaker, so we'll put music on, talk about the show is, talk about jokes. And then if I feel like having a drink, we have drink. Sometimes we have post show meal, so have a meal delivered as I'm coming off stage. So we eat. So it's like having dinner after the show. And then it's like, what, how important is the transportation? If it's like we got to get going, like we get on the bus and um, you know, if like, like I said, if it's like, if I feel like having a drink that night, we have a drink sit around. Some nights I don't, so sometimes I'll hit a like a vape pen, uh, you know, like a mile edible. I like mild ones, so I keep it like real buzz level, you know, not fucked up. Oh, mine's a little different. Yeah, go ahead. Tell, tell us the truth. The truth,

Speaker 6:          00:54:22       truth, that'd be 100% on smartly. And I'm worried about how are you worried about fucking everyone else. Oh, they know. Everybody knows. It always comes back to bite you. A drink on stage for the second show starts with, when I tell the machine story, I go backstage and then, uh, backstage, I'll have another drink. Like sitting back there, we do like a, you know, like a 15 minute chill out. People come backstage with her backstage passes like friends or when you know, whatever and have a drink with them. And then I'll take that drink out to the meet and greet to the meet and greet. Of course. Makes Sense. Yeah. And then, uh, and then what I've been doing a lot lately is going, is telling everyone in the show where I'm going to go drink and then everyone goes and meets me at a bar.

Speaker 6:          00:55:04       Yeah, it's different. Wow. It sounds like my nightmare. Oh, so it's not that bad if you can just connect, right. If you're just, if you're one of those people that that can get into you, then it will get into a lot more. If I had to do, I actually don't drink that much cause I can't drink. So I'm taking pictures. I'll take maybe like, I would drink a lot more if I had to take pictures. I'll take like 500 pictures at night. Like at a, like I'm white. I'm inviting 1800 people to a bar, you know, and going like both shows. I go, I'll be drinking it. Dot Dot, dot. Tonight if you want, meet me over there and I'll see you over there. How do you get, I don't get that house. I won't do shots. I won't do shots with anyone. People. I won't let people buy me drinks gives me, I go in, I'll tip the bartender is usually a hundred bucks each and just say, hey, thanks.

Speaker 6:          00:55:52       I'm sorry. Then I fucking swamps your bar tonight. And then I'll, and I'll, and they usually take care of me and just give me like in, when we did it in Boston, we went to the place right down the street. I forget the name of it. And uh, I did, they didn't have Tito's and soda, so I just drink beer, but I don't really go choose Tito's and soda though. Right. It will say it's just a little healthier. I think it's a little leaner. And so that's what, yeah, but then we get on the bus and got a nice handle with you here. I brought you a little, you know, Tito's is always nice enough to send me handles all the time. I have maybe I have maybe 19 bottles of at my, all my outdoor bus. [inaudible] I have so much goddamn Tito's all my tour bus and you have no idea.

Speaker 6:          00:56:29       And Atlanta live nation just gave me a case of Tito's. They were like, oh, just tell you have it and we have so much Tito's. It's ridiculous, but here's where it gets wacky for me. It's like, then we get on the bus and we got, we don't charge traveling with like six people. So you get on the bus and everyone's like, uh, let's, uh, let's do another round of, Hey, let's throw on some Netflix. Hey, we just bullshitting. And nine you stay up and sometimes until four in the morning and you're like, and then sometimes I stay up late. I do stay up late and I have trouble. I've always had trouble. I got, I, you know, I have trouble falling asleep here when I'm on the east coast, I'm fucked. Yeah. I, that's the one thing that fucks me up the most is a, I don't even want to be up that late and I'm still like, fuck man, you know, it's three 30 in the, but once you get on the bus, it's healthier for me.

Speaker 6:          00:57:14       Like when we have to leave right after a venue, it's very healthy. When you go to a bar and then you get back to the bus and you're like, you're just like, oh, it's staying up talking but you're not getting nap fucked up on the just sitting on the bus. Um, I think my drinking oddly enough has been more under control of my eating. I was really good the first run in minutes, just fuck. I started to do this like when, cause you know when you, when you get to the theaters they'll say like, you want food, you know, do you want an order? Appreciate a meal. Just have like an automated answers. She'd be like, yeah, grilled chicken and vet. Like just this way. What gets delivered is good for you. I was doing salads for awhile. That's good. Yeah. And then we had, then we were in Indianapolis and had this great pizza place crunch.

Speaker 6:          00:57:53       I was like four pizzas. What? We'll watch the NFC championship and the port tour bus. Huh? What? And it was just fucking the wheels come off. Yeah. Is that Liam look at it. What's going on there? Oh my God, that's a Bert. Oh my God. Yeah, jerking off. That's me jerking off in a window. Yeah, look at him. Oh my God. You've never seen this? I had never seen it before. That woman got almost got me fired. Do you never heard this story? The time you direct off? You've never heard this story for real? No. Oh, this is a good story. Tell me. So for those of you who are listening, you did not see anything. Okay, that's true. But what you, what was it from the shield and those two acts? It's not real footage. That's not real footage. Now that's from the shield.

Speaker 6:          00:58:41       I thought it was from the tour. No, no, no, no, no. Okay. So, uh, I, the television show, the CI, the shield. You were, I was a cook. That was my role. It said the cock. What was the booking like? Uh, I did actually didn't even have to read for it. They just booked me. How great is that? Yeah. Tell him. He just looked at me and they go, he looks like a cock fucking cause. The role was, I was a guy who hired a black guy to fuck my wife and I like to Jack off watching them fuck on the outside dressed as a DWP outfits. Boy, a guy. This is pretty cool. I like this very specific and I didn't even have to read for it. They went, yeah, this checks off the black guys fucking his wife. So how turned out would you be if that were a thing? Not at, not at all. The idea of someone else fucking Leanne is not turned me on. It was that you're opening your opener. No, no, that was, I don't know what that was from. And I'm offended by that kind of big swig.

Speaker 6:          00:59:47       What would you want to happen with? Nothing. Just me and her fucking potatoes. Girl scout troop leader mom. That you'd be like, oh Leanne, we should go to like you put her in the dog or like missionary or uh, yeah, we did. We did the 12 nights of Kama Sutra and December. We did the 12th of Christmas with a group of friends. So we had 12 parties in December. And then on the first, every one of those nights. And then the first night I said, why don't we as a group of friends do the 12 nights Kama Sutra? So every night we have a party, we'll all send each other at New Kama Sutra pose that we have to do and then we'll send our notes back in the morning as a couple. And not everyone understood it properly. The first couple gave their kids a Nike or a Benadryl and then did all 12 positions at night.

Speaker 6:          01:00:39       It knocked their kids out and fucked him. 12 new position. That's not what you said. And so yeah, there's not oldest, but Leanne and I did it. We did all of them and it was fucking awesome. It was this one position that, uh, that she pulled up and it was so cool. Imagine if, imagine if you're sitting here, she's sitting on my lap at her legs are over to the side right now. Take that position and just fall back on the bed. So her back's on the bed and you're on your side and her legs are up over your legs. Does that make sense? It was awesome. It was awesome. But yeah, I'm more berry meat potatoes. I just want to have regular sex. Can See big anal guy or no, never done it. Not with her once in a camp. This guy did it to me.

Speaker 6:          01:01:28       Nice guy or no, no, no, I'd never done anal. Yeah. Really? I tried. It's the way you booked this role. You said I booked this role. Um, and chiclets is I think Chiklis and this other guy are directing this episode, but chiclets is onset. So I, I read the breakdown and I the scene and it's me watching my wife fuck a black dude, right. And the bike guy and my wife, we're both in this house. I see them in the house. And so I just got into role and I started playing with my Dick, like legit playing with my deck, right. And uh, they pull up and she gets outraged. This lady, this lady, that real person, she calls cut, she goes, this is ridiculous. He's touching himself. And in my head I'm like, I read this wrong. I was like, I thought it said playing with yourself.

Speaker 6:          01:02:16       And I'm like, Oh my God, I'm so fucking embarrassed. I've never acted in before. This is the first ever acted in. This is when we were shooting hurt by the way. So she goes, I'm not going to work with him and show she moves. They split us up. And uh, Michael Chiklis and this other guy, I forget the other guy's name, come up to me and I go, hey man, I'm, I'm really sorry. I think I misread this. I can do it again. I don't have to touch myself. And he was like, no, great choice. I want really got her fucker. It's a great choice. Did, that's definitely what we want. As a matter of fact, what we're going to do is we're going to hold her in position a and then we're going to close it on you. We're gonna do some tights. We're gonna move the camera around, but I want you to just play with yourself.

Speaker 6:          01:02:53       I was like, really? He goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Go at it. And then, and then what am I doing when I call her back the second time? Uh, touch, no touch, no touch yourself and, but we're going to use you touch here. Should I go? Okay. She goes, all right. All right, hold on. First position. All right, action. So I'd walk up this whole shot that you see and I'm fucking playing with my deck or play with my deck. And then my dick starts getting hard and I'm playing with my deck and we're calling off for like five minutes. I'm like, are they even filming or do you think they're just sitting back? They're going to watch this guy, Jaguar xe becomes, yeah. And so then at finally he goes, all right, cut. I ain't goes to let you go. And so then in a little more burden, they pulled up, they pulled her up, and then the scene, I did the scene without touching myself, but they use me touching myself and just inner cut them.

Speaker 6:          01:03:39       And then, uh, yeah. And then I walk around, they arrest me, put me in cuffs, had a panic attack in handcuffs, walked me to the front door, big black guy comes out and I was like, honey, can you just tell them what's going on? And he's like, yeah, dudes with her. And then you find out that I liked to have black eyes. Fuck my wife. Oh yeah, yeah. Oh Wow. I know that all you're going to do is enter cuts my voice. I'd like to have black guys. Fuck my wife and I will use it. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. These are all audio recordings and they're online. Make sure you mark that by the way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We got it. Okay, good. Um, yeah, we have this other, uh, footage of the room. Was it, oh, is this, what is this secret time? Oh yeah. On Netflix. You can watch it right now.

Speaker 8:          01:04:36       Does he fly to get easy? Been Pass it down. What I did on it, does he need a and yard duty gang? Is that Tom and Mike Domitrz focus.

Speaker 6:          01:04:48       Ah, that's, that's a clip from secret time. It's, uh, yeah, they're doing an international versus release of it. They dump it everywhere. Good job man. I appreciate it man. Yeah, thanks. I'll be killed. Another one of these beers. Do you have it in your audience? Do they yell like Burdis fat when they see you or they probably all Thomas Rhett. Tom Thomas, fat Thomas about the old tour bus champ a lot. Yeah, the one, the one, I mean, I told you this, I hate to even bring up because I, because obviously it's the, some regret I never settled the Puck, but uh, the very first date I did after doing this podcast when this in Oxnard and some guy clear as fucking day in the middle of my set goes, tell your n word joke, like what word? The n word he, but he's had, he's had the real word, he said the real word and it was in the cleanest white version of that use of that word and it ruined the room.

Speaker 6:          01:05:47       It ruined the fucking room. And everyone was like, oh. And I was like, listen, I don't, I apologize. I go, listen, I, I understand that you're a fan, but, uh, I, I, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna do that. And I, and I just wish you hadn't done that and it really reset the room and it, I had to like win them back and it was like fucking nightmare. So I get done the show, I'm doing the meet and greet and this black guy comes up to me and he goes, he never told it. I said, it was a black I do on a white guy voice and it fucking, and I was like, I go, why didn't you tell everyone you were black? He goes, I don't care cause he's black. He's like, oh, I'll give you shit. But it was fucking horrific. That was the one that sucked the most. But mostly people y'all tour bus champ burns fat and Mickey Mantle. Jean,

Speaker 5:          01:06:38       is that the black guy? But no, just a black guy. Different black guys.

Speaker 6:          01:06:55       Dude. How about all this black face showing up, huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah, there was, there was the fashion stuff you're talking about. No, no, no. I'm talking about all these fucking, oh, like the Virginia governor. How funny is, I mean how fucking comic goal is that the governor gets caught in black face. The next guy raped some women and that allegedly and then the next guy goes. Actually I've been in black faced all in Virginia, Virginia. You did you ever see anyone a black face in college and like Florida or in high school? No, no. Our, our high school cheerleading squad in like 1980780980 eight came out to babies, got back in all black face with wigs and gold chains. There was a picture of it online. There's a picture over the line and I actually hit some of the chicks up and was like, hey, you guys work with kids.

Speaker 6:          01:07:51       You might want to get rid of that picture. One girl I be, it was a picture online tagged yourself. She's like, I love this thing. No, there's one girl that works with disabled kids that had, there's a picture of me and her in college. It was a, this party I threw and she is in straight black face like like legit blackface and I ran into her in San Diego. I was like, Hey, you may want to like scrub the Internet of that, like just pull down. She had posted it herself and tagged me in it. Just oblivious to the idea that that you don't think I was even aware of what blackface thing? I'm trying to think of like awareness. It wasn't like, I don't think that people were, I mean I wasn't throwing around definitely in high school, but I, if I had seen a probably, you know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          01:08:37       I wouldn't notice to my attention as being as crazy as if you notice it now. I mean I don't, I never even thought of it to be on, I mean I'd never done it, but it's only because I don't like makeup on my face. Like I'm not saying that I would have or I wouldn't, but I don't like makeup on my face. Like clowns freaked me out so I don't never put makeup on my face. Yeah. That's how I know I've never done. I know that I did the talent show in fifth grade. I did young Mc a thing, but I wore a dress. I'm like, wait, why did you wear a dress? A forget, I think I played the girl that's in the story to move. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So like I, I act it out now. That's a hate crime. You were mocking train.

Speaker 6:          01:09:16       I know Kevin Cranston, Bryan Cranston, because he played a disabled person with a naval bombing. It just makes me crazy. It's insane where this is going. I mean, Kevin Hart tried to fucking give a shout out to Jessie, small lat and a, and it's talking about here's what we would ask you. Well, what do you think? Like if you were orchestrating that hate crime, what do you think he did wrong? Oh, I'll tell you what would you have to, how should he have done it? Right? I can tell you all the things, all the signals that I picked up on when I first read the story and I went, I'm not going to say this out loud, but this is bullshit. Let's talk to an expert. You can't, you can't say this out loud because you look like a person that is promoting violence, but I go, hold on one second too.

Speaker 6:          01:09:59       Racist White guys recognized you from empire. I at two in the morning. I watch empire like, but I wouldn't recognize you. I've watched empire, but I wouldn't recognize you and two guys and Maggie has like, Hey, you're that gay guy from MPO. That number's going to happen. No one that's Amaga guys wa is watching empire. That's just doesn't, it's not there. What they enjoy watching. It's a good point. I never thought of. The noose was on his neck for 45 minutes when the police, when the police talked to him, who keeps a noose on their fucking neck, the cops came to his apartment to interview him and he was still had it around his neck and the bleach. No one wants, they're not trying to get you lighter. No one's like, hey, we want you to be like us. Come on man. Let's let, let us help out the, what the fuck it was as, as a white person, you wouldn't want him to be white or he wouldn't be like, okay well if this bleach works then old stop in the middle of this.

Speaker 6:          01:10:54       I'm so sorry man. Right. There was a lot of that that I just didn't, I called, I called bullshit in my head, but then I'm also a cynic. I'm and I'm also a contrarion so like, so like as soon as that happened, I, that's what I thought. And then once I found out it was a lie, I then get empathetic for that kid. And then I go like, you feel badly for her. I feel badly for him. It said, cause I go, where's his brain at? And, and I don't want that to be used as a lightening Rod to light up true Maggie racists to go, this is why they're that or this is like, cause I got, so like whenever, whatever side is that, I'm always going to the opposite side and trying to argue the other direction. Yeah. But yeah, I feel bad for that kid.

Speaker 6:          01:11:33       I don't know what the fuck's going on in his brain. They thought that would help him. It's not good. It's not good for anyone. I thought the same thing. It's just, it's nothing good's going to come of that could be mental illness. I don't know. Breathe. You gotta breathe dude. That is a, that is a great, your mom's house challenge to put stuff in your budget. It's a viral challenge. There'll be put out on Facebook my associate like the ice bucket challenge and it's right, it's a tight shot and it's like, hey guys, my name is Bert Kreischer. It's ready for the, it's ready. I'm ready for the uh, the butt plug challenge right now. You've got to try to guess. Am I putting a butt plug in or am I not putting a blood put yet? And it's just a shot of my eyes and it's being going and people have to guess if you really did it or if you didn't do it.

Speaker 6:          01:12:33       And then do you show them and then you pull back and either pants on or your nick will you do about plug video? I did a, I would know, but I tell you what, I would do a suppository video. Have you ever put up a sub pository in your ass? Won't have one put in, but it's been a long, this is my impression of getting into some hot, this is my impression of a suppository getting put in your asshole. This is me as the suppository getting put in your asshole. Okay. Ready? Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. I'll take it from here. Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:13:03       So I've put a lot of depositories. How often? A lot. Cause I, cause sometimes I fucking ship fire and source depository is what cools it down. See how you do it. Like [inaudible] I've done it very recently. Like if I eat a lot of spicy stuff in my fucking assholes burning, I'll just show what Chabot preparation h suppository up there. Wow. And that cools your ass off immediately. It feels good. Oh, positive. Never. Never a toy or a toy. What kind of toy? Like a little car or something. Oh No, no. I take him sex toy. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I never, I got the little one. No, I've never had any. You never been pegged or anything like that? Never been pegged to finger up my ass, obviously. Okay, so then we're getting somewhere. Yeah. I mean who hasn't had a finger in there as well? I mean how often? No. Like a college. That was the last time. Uh, yeah. Leanne, we'll do it. This is how much you do it. This is my impression of me and Leanne during oral sex. Ready? Put your finger in my ass. What? Nothing. She would not do that. That's not the end. Because as soon as I said that Leanne was just like, are you gay? That's where they embrace down. I'm not putting fingers in your ass.

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       I mean your wife, I would input a guy, put a shit. No. Yeah. Well I don't know. I mean we're asked is a real dry. Anytime I would ever offer that, it would be a Coleen doubt. Okay. I don't have any shit hanging out in my body that I'm not getting rid of immediately. Yeah. I don't know. But you're asked. Seems real dicey to me. If you had to put your finger on one of our assets. Who's who? Did Tom ask the question? I mean nobody like looked on base. Let's say. I'm not married to him, young guys, just my friends. Just knowing what I know about both of your personal hygiene. His is way better than yours. No. You have very, a very lax slack idea of personal hygiene. It's about his personal life. I remember one time I picked something out of my body or something and I smelled it and Tom goes, you would smell that I grow.

Speaker 5:          01:15:10       I'm sorry. If you find an object on your body, your first thing isn't a smell it. That's a first thing I do. If I bought it. It's like, where are you finding it? What better thing? Something between your toes. First thing I do it well. What's that? I don't smell between my, no. Oh, Mike. I would investigate but I wouldn't smell out. Look at it. I'm all. Then just start to smell that bubbly. Okay. Say belly button. Lynn. I wouldn't have been here. You don't rub your finger behind your and smelling? No. Why would you do it? Try it.

Speaker 5:          01:15:42       Do you use, does your smell your behind my ears do right now. All this nasty. I'm wearing headsets. No, it's because you're nasty though. It's not cause I'm nasty. I'm 90% of the [inaudible] told us. Remember when you used to live on set up sixth street downstream from us? I just treat whatever that you use to clip your toenails and then you collect them on a piece of scotch tape and then you tape it under a coffee tea coffee table, which is so nasty, nasty, nasty. Why is that not nasty? It's so nasty. If you had to smell balls right now, you think smell better. Minor Tom. Tom's a thousand times hotter. Always bet your balls smell her horrendous. And here's why. I'm going to tell you why you don't wear underwear and your genes are not clean. You wear the same jeans every time I see you.

Speaker 5:          01:16:39       And on top of their cell phones like you usually think of like, hey, this guy drinks like a 1590 bottles a day, like probably smells between his legs, stinky. You really think you're to do your balls smell good right now. Right now? Right now. I'm good right now, but I don't think they're quite at that sour state. You showered last night? I showered this morning. Yeah, but guess what I'm saying? You're naturally stink here. Well, my balls right now are ripe. I can tell because they're all in these genes and these genes are a older, they're a little older. They're three, three weeks old. That's how long you go between washing your jeans. Yeah. I've actually had a pair of jeans. One time I was flying back from South Africa and I was on the plane. I went, I think my jeans smell. I could smell my jeans and then I washed them and I was like, oh, they're not that color for real.

Speaker 5:          01:17:30       How old are these? Yeah. Yeah. I think Leanne is just really accepting of the fact that you're disgusting. My teeth, my teeth are good right now. Brushed their good cause I know I don't. I floss, I floss like aggressively, but more importantly, our waterpik every day. That's pretty good. That's good. Let's see a smile. He brush. Why not? Cause cause I already know, I already know one time you go, you were being, you were talking, you go, hey, why don't you get your teeth fixed?

Speaker 6:          01:23:30       active with them. Yeah. You know what was going to be cold. It's like it's going to become real news. Oh, this out of context is going to fuck somebody up. Oh, out of context. They will believe it. We're going to, we're going to drop these like kind of everywhere. You know? I remember that there was a person, that's how I was responsible for the synagogue shootings. Someone said that, oh, I sent it to you. Really? A long story. I'm not getting into into it. Yeah. Somebody tweeted you that. Not Don't let it change the fucking subject. Someone genuinely wrote an article saying I was responsible for those synagogues shooting. Okay, let's change this second. Okay. But how often do you shower for Leanne? Everyday. Everyday. Everyday? Yeah. So this is the type of guy you got it. Oh cool. Yeah. I saw her every day.

Speaker 6:          01:24:51       This is crazy. Yes. I've never seen this. Yeah. People are still learning about math and stuff like that based on how fat burden, by the way, whoever who just said that, I don't know. One of your fucking laugh tracks back there. No. People sent that in a long time ago, but apparently I've never seen this. They're still sending it out. This one's new. Okay. Oh cool. Yeah, I was super excited to keep playing. The rest of it. Turn up my volume of my head says I'm not hearing it.

Speaker 10:         01:25:21       Fair enough. Tell me again who's first place jail. Jasper, Joe and then second. Hi, sorry. Second. Tom. Tom. Tom, who's in fourth?

Speaker 6:          01:25:40       Kids laughing. I don't know. I think they like your name. I bet kids like your name. Yeah. It's a fun name of a great man. You don't hear it a lot either? No. Like Burton earnings. What does that some teacher that's just basically talking about the weight loss challenge. It's a teacher who's a is usually we get like English as a second language teachers and like when they're just trying to come up with sentences, they'll just, you know, they'll throw in something like, and then what happens if you eat too much? And then the kids go, you get like bird like that. I don't know, they just send it in. I'm starting to understand this fake news thing. It was becomes real. There's people that come out to me after the shows that are massively overweight. They're like, Hey, are you fat? Fuck. And you're like, and you're like, you're fatter than I am.

Speaker 6:          01:26:26       Like I get that when they're like, um, when it actually, the only person who will say something to you like to my face will be like a really fat guy. Oh yeah. Or the most abusive fat comment. You're like, who's this guy will be like 380 and he's like, Hey, are you fat? Fuck or block someone today? You did. Yeah. I don't mind. I get, I can, I have the probably the thicker skin out of most of the comics out there. I get I, I can take a joke and I'm fine with it and I get, I can understand an attempt at a joke to fall short. I understand that they're not pros at it. I've fallen short, but sometimes you get guys who just say mean shit and I'll take it if you like. I mean, I'll be like, you know, if the guy follows me, I know he was trying to be funny.

Speaker 6:          01:27:10       If you don't follow me, I'm like, sorry man, that's not how it works. You got fucking blocked. Yeah, you get to suck a dick. Or if like I blocked people because they said way too much mean shit about you. And I'm like, oh no, he's my friend. I like him more than I like you and now I'm blocking you. I would like to a lot of people on Instagram for the comment, Oh, I've blocked a lot of people on Instagram. We just get all my thing and start fights with people and just, but they're trying to do like an inside joke, but they're legit starting fights. I just go, man, you can't play anymore. You've got to understand the nuance of it. You've got to get out of a sense of humor about it at least. Yeah, I agree. I don't like, I don't like the super abusive stuff.

Speaker 6:          01:27:43       Like, or if I post a picture of my family and they go, ah, they say like really horrible shit about like whatever. I'm just like, ah, you're not gonna play. Yeah, but I think that's the right we have is to say, Hey, I'm not going to, cause I know, I remember when, when we first did the fat shaming at the very beginning, uh, there were people that did not, would, you weren't in on the joke and they weren't getting it at first and there were picking sides for real. Fuck Bert. I fucking hate that guy. He'll have sued his own jokes. He's a fucking, you don't even have a Netflix special. Who the fuck is he anyway? He's just some guy from travel channel. I remember you going like, Huh? He's blocked and go fuck himself. Yeah. No, I don't, I don't like to really mean stuff. I thought there's like a circle of people that we kind of like is not racist guys. Like this is a circle of people that get the joke, but then there's people that just, Oh yeah, we put them in World War II footage.

Speaker 5:          01:28:35       It's a joke. I didn't think I'd have to say it.

Speaker 6:          01:28:38       That's not real. Not a Nazi. Do you realize that that was an off the cuff comment though. This started it. You were just sitting down. We were promoting it was a perfect time. It was a part number, like here's the fattest and, and we just pause. Like, what's another bad

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       thing to say? Uh, super. Unapologetically Reddix the racist guy and like, if that was it, we've got to get a new thing going. What do you want to be?

Speaker 6:          01:29:11       Oh, the vessels in comedy and comedy. I drove with the biggest dick smelly his balls. Um, grossest brighter, exciting stage presence. Charged with rape, but never too late. Someone's already done that.

Speaker 1:          01:29:35       Yeah. Some fucking guy used to be my friend did that. What am I going to say? His name. All right, let's go tour by the way. You Maniac. Yeah. So your tour is a huge success. Probably bigger than you ever thought. It would be way bigger than I ever thought it would be. And everywhere you're, you're adding shows you fucking touring every week like a psycho. Um, when, so when are you, uh, what's, what's the next stops where you, that you want to people to come to? Where are you, where are you going to be? I know you have everything, but I think, no, I think, uh,

Speaker 6:          01:30:07       everything's sold, but you know, there's always like single tickets, there's always available tickets. So like, uh, on, on their second shows there's always like, you know, like, like a two packets somewhere. I'm in New Orleans this week, Austin, Dallas, and then, uh, and then I do like jersey, Philly, DC, and then that run to the Middle East, middle, middle of the country. And then I'm, and then I'm in Australia and Europe.

Speaker 1:          01:30:30       Yeah. Yeah. I think Europe's already sold out. And then Australia has got open tickets, I think, but that's like fucking three months, four months away. That's great. Are you ever going to do Australia? And we're talking right now for real. Yeah. The main thing is I didn't want to announce it a way ahead of time. I was like, you can't put me in a position where I get fucked. So we'd have to announce it closer to the date. So we went a little B. Wow. I mean it would, I would announce it later in the year. And so it be later in the year

Speaker 6:          01:30:56       ball. No more like winter. You got, you know, you've got to do when they go, ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for Tom Segura and don't walk out on stage for 15 minutes.

Speaker 1:          01:31:10       You've done a story with Joe though, right? And I did the Melbourne comedy festival. Hey, what's going to be our sober October challenges here? I don't know.

Speaker 6:          01:31:18       Think about it now. So we're not thinking of it at the last minute and we're not doing the surf thing. I don't, I mean, I don't know how he would, yeah, I know it's October. It's gonna be cold as fuck. It's really cold. Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:31:31       how about we each raise a wolf

Speaker 6:          01:31:35       children? That's a great idea. I'm trying to plan my touring around it because I don't want to be touring to aggressively in October. Yeah. You did not do well if you did that. Yeah. Right now I'm out. They want me to go out every single weekend in October and I'm like, I can't. I can't. I sober October. Too much fun. I want to be present for it. I want to be here. I want to do something where we all do it together. Like we did hot yoga where it's bringing together, we're going to say first one was better. The first one was better than the competition got intense and the only person, I mean I didn't, I didn't even talk to Ari. I couldn't even talk to rex. He was so competitive about it this year, this year's or whatever, and I didn't talk to Joe wants and we'd all be in our taxed by the only person I ever spoke to is you. Yeah. Like I want to do something. His cohesive kidneys were shutting down like he was doing stupid shit. We can't do that. We talked about it last night and he was like, it's good to know. I still got that part of my brain around where he's like, ah, oh, it's survival mode. Let's fucking go. And I was like, yeah, that my brain didn't do that at all.

Speaker 3:          01:32:32       What did, did it bother you? What? When we did sober October. Yeah. It's stupid. I think it's horrible and it ruins our family life. It puts a wrench in everything. Wow. She sounds like Leanne hard fucking core rolled out. Yeah, because where are the other half to sober? October. In fact, I think she and I should do a podcast when you guys are doing sober October so we can let people know how much it wreaks havoc on. Everybody's glad our wives to see which uh, which wife could milk the most semen out of us. It be cool. Yeah. That's a good challenge. It's a great town. I liked that. Hey, someone dropped the artwork. Sober October milk. The men, the Milkman challenge. I like this one. Well Ari needs a milker. He doesn't have want to feel fine. If you find someone who's got some 25 year old hippie that makes put Julia in New York. Yeah. Who doesn't know it is. She'll, she'll milk them through a table, you know, that'd be fine. Let's see. What can you guys do that's inclusive and fun and cause I think you're right. The solo nature of the last one wasn't fun cause you guys have enjoyable. It was

Speaker 6:          01:33:32       interesting. Yeah it was a good journey but it wasn't, it wasn't, you know, what kind of stuff, here's the thing about the hot yoga. It's, it kinda sucks. It is doable. It's about going there. What if it was more like a like at spin class kind of thing. Like that sucks. It's doable but you don't want to go fucking 15 times in a month. You know what if we paired up with, I mean I think all of us are pretty anti corporate, but what if we did pair up with a big corporation to do something of theirs so we could, I don't know. I mean we're already gonna lose jokes. He's like, we're not going all financially benefit off sober October. I think part of the fun of it is that it's organic, you know? Yeah. I mean going in like, I think going to the like making yourself go to the class and knowing that you can miss a day, but man, you better not miss too many.

Speaker 6:          01:34:16       That made it interesting to me. Yeah. I I liked, I mean, when Ari, like when we were in Arizona and art, he was like, hey, we gotta go. We gotta go. We have a hot yoga class at five and then we're doing a show at eight. It was kind of fun to dip out, go do hot yoga. Did you already do that week with him then you guys, weren't you asking to do Salt Lake, Utah? He already did it. Yeah. How was it? It was great. Ari Is fucking hilarious to watch ski. Really. He's the ugliest skier you've ever seen in your life. He is, first of all, he's, he's taller and lankier than anyone out there. He dresses like he's a child. He has like Stars and Stripes Pants, a Dirk Novinski Jersey on. He covers his face, all black. So it looks like he's like one of those Gi Joe Man.

Speaker 6:          01:35:00       And then he skis, uh, like a pizza pie, whereas he just snow power the whole time. But he goes 60 miles an hour. Snowplowing like it's disgusting. Uh, yeah, but he, uh, there was a phone we can, man. All we did was talk shit about comedy. Really? Oh, that's your favorite thing to do? 100%. That's yours too. Not as much as you, I enjoy watching you gossip more than you had caught me. I, we like gossiping because at the million, but we, I mean like, do you think you're like, you, uh, enhance it for me? I get into it. I get into it. I like to punch up a good chaos. It's fun to watch. You get excited about shad target. Oh Dude. When we've, we've, we went down this blue run, it's called boomer, and in the middle of boomer and Salt Lake City, there's a bar and we went down.

Speaker 6:          01:35:46       We'd been skiing like half the day we like maybe five runs. We get to this bar, boom or, and we sit down when again, won't appear. We want a beer and then something pops up on the Internet and I have someone's like, dude, have you seen this? And all of a sudden we're at boom worth this bar for two hours. And then at one point were like, fuck it. You just want to get out of the bottom, get drunk and finish this conversation. Dude, it was the greatest. Sounds like a lot of fun, dude. I have. I could talk about comedy for days. I love it now just to keep it up and stuff. Don't worry. What do you texting them for? Texting. Laugh track. Oh, you mean laugh track? I hear them cackling in there. They're laughing at moments. They went to that and I don't, do you think I'm instructing them? And I thought it was, oh, it was legit. Laugh track when I was outside. I was looking at their fucking cackle it you're here to get, but that's, that's just him. Why is he had the fucking mask on his face. He's, he's, oh, he's black. Got Aids. Oh. So he didn't want me to know.

Speaker 6:          01:36:43       I'm like, hey dude, I got friends coming. You mind covering up? He's like, yeah, no problem. You got a legit set here. Yeah. Do you like it? Well, not when Mcdonald's was sponsoring, because when they gave us, they gave us two point $3 million and they were like, if you paint the set or a Mcdonald's colors and when they pulled out

Speaker 1:          01:37:05       and Morton's jumped on and then they fired us like two weeks ago. Really?

Speaker 6:          01:37:11       So what's it like? What's the ideal a sponsor for you guys? I mean, we'd love to keep it in the steak house

Speaker 1:          01:37:15       wheelhouse, but I dunno man. I mean we have a couple of, there's this, a Korean steakhouses looking to do something, but the only one to throw us a few hundred bucks, you know, they got that. Cool. I'd rather, I'd rather have one of the big dogs do it. Really? Sure.

Speaker 6:          01:37:30       Like a like, oh yeah. Or Smiths. Oh yeah, that'd be great. Oh, that would be me. They get crazy food to go all green and white. It would be great. And have a guy with like a nice little butler coat come out or view a stake in the middle of our Houston's even I like Houston Lot. Baby back ribs are the best ribs in the fucking world. Pregnant with the first kid.

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       We would go there once a week during even say his name. That's how private you are. Oh God. I'm so glad.

Speaker 6:          01:38:03       Well we gotta get you a travel smoker, Tommy. So you're really, you're smoking, smoking meat during the show, during the show, during the day. Who sets it up? Dave Williamson or myself. We can mostly Dave Williams sentences. Such an inherently bad idea. Jude. We set up the travel smoker. We put out some chairs, put the awning out and crack some beers and sit on the sidewalk outside the theater. People were walking by going, hey, wait, is it, is that you? All of us didn't even know who I am. I go, yeah, they go, hey, I got a picture. Don't even know who I am. I'll make sure it's hilarious. And then your meat's ready by the end of the night or what? Oh yeah, yeah. It was, well, we did a brisket in Tampa. We did. She sign a sore ribs in Orlando. We did a pulled pork in Atlanta. We've done it every, we did Vegan burgers in Fort Lauderdale.

Speaker 6:          01:38:47       You set this up every night. Set up every night. It's so much fucking fun. Shout out to rec tech. Wow, dude. They got great gear. Where did they meet you to like to give it to you? I don't know. You know they sent me a grill a while ago. Just, I don't know, it's just send it to me and I didn't open it. I didn't even, I just was like, ah, I'm busy and I'm busy. Yeah. It was just this big grill and I was like, I don't have time to put it together. They send it to and they gave me like a custom great where it says the machine on it and then one day I'm with Leanne. We got to talk to some time off and I'm like, I'm going to put that smoke together and I put it together. It's a really nice smoker. And then I was like, Hey, I'm going to smoke some stuff tonight. So I smoked some pork ribs and the girls loved him and I was like, it's, I enjoy, you know, I'm a, I am the quintessential American like homer Simpson male. Yeah. I love setting up my grill, grilling out, having a beer.

Speaker 3:          01:39:37       I'll say this by the way. Yeah, 100% true. I've always told people this. You're an excellent cook. Oh, thank you. Thank you. I mean it genuinely and sincerely. I think back on those early days when I was coming over, we would go over to their apartment and, uh, I was looking, I was, I would look at going to your place almost like, you know, when you go home from college, I'm going to have some good food. When I'm home. You would cook feasts. Oh, I would ban it. Those days are the best. Those were, I missed those days so much. And the Nakey time, Nikki time number that when girls get naked running around. I remember I took a shit on the roof. If I got to get together one time to squash it was running around. She just looked at me and was like, oh, just pinched one off right there. I looked at that house on my parents pool one time, just jumped out of the pool, put her bathing suit, offside shit in the yard and then jump back in the pool. I was like, that's my kid, you know, the rooftop and we would all go out there and watch the sunset and drink beer and eat McDonald's. Mcdonald's. Sorry.

Speaker 6:          01:40:54       That's right.

Speaker 3:          01:40:55       Good time. But those are the, that was the beginning of everything. I think Tommy and I were just becoming feature acts and you were coming a headliner. You just had to choose girl. I did see before I even knew anything about

Speaker 6:          01:41:06       bonuses. You guys came over and I did Columbus. It's right when we started doing Rogan's podcast a little bit. You guys came over and as Stroup was like, Hey, uh, you hit your bonus is how do you want it in cash or in the check. I was like, I'll give it a cash. And he gave me like $6,000 in cash and I was like, what? You came over to my house at night and I was making it rain on Ios. She was on the ground and I was just making it rain on her. And I know it was like, look at my bonus. I had $6,000 in cash. You were like, Holy Shit. I was like, I know. Can you believe this dude? I look back to those times so fondly because it was like, even like little things like, um, do you remember the time he told me I burp a lot?

Speaker 6:          01:41:45       Yeah. Like we were in the car and you're like, yeah, this is such like something wrong with, there's some, you like the, if you don't, if you only know Tom for this podcast, there's a part of his personality you don't get, first of all, he, me and him are very similar in that we, we right. Think so. We'll, we'll be writing a joke like this. Oh yeah, yeah. That phase. But then there's another part of him where he like wool. Like, it's almost like, uh, like a child where he looks at you and you can tell he's got a thought isn't it? You burp a lot. And I was like, Huh? He was like, Yo, you've burped like a hundred times in this car ride. I was like, no I don't. And you're like, no, no, you actually do. And then I started going, God damn and I do burp a lot.

Speaker 6:          01:42:23       And then the next thing was I saw him like a week later. He was like, guess what? I talked to my doctor and he said, there's definitely something wrong. I was like, really? Because he was, I told him, you said it was burping a lot and then I was thinking about it and talking about it to them and I definitely have like some acid reflux. I was burping. I didn't realize you still do. You always go, well I do have, I'm drinking, but I was, I wasn't even drinking. We're just in the car. Yeah. And I was burping like a lot. And you're going, oh yeah, I remember that was it. Yeah. I err, err too. That's my big thing. Like if I make some things that someone to eat, something to eat and I watched them take a bite, I'll go. You also, by the way, but aside from you. Yeah, like you have told me, everyone told me my whole life, they're like, ah, you slow down. Just going to say that. I'm like a word made me feel like the, I was a slow eater. Like he'd eat a steak and four bites. I was like, are you all right? He'd be like, whoa.

Speaker 3:          01:43:26       Oh Dude. That should be the sweat when I eat. Yeah, no, he's, you're a fast eater now. I don't know if you can do quantity, but I know that you can do speed. Can we incorporate this and sober October? Maybe you're staying sober, but can you start eating faster? Why didn't like that? Eating faster and faster. Whatever. Eating contest Rocktober I could eat. Can't get fucked up, but you can eat. We're gonna lose Joel and eating contest. Yes. Fatter on October.

Speaker 6:          01:43:52       Yeah. He was to get the fattest. That's not, we've got to make it something that's, no. Yeah, he would definitely, although he would just take it to the next level of gain a hundred pounds and he'd be like, I'm going to lose it this week. I'll lose it on a jog. We need it to be, uh, something that is folds in easy to Joe and Ari's life, but makes it fun for our family. So it's, we're not, you know what I mean? Yeah. Oh, there it is. Oh, those are not the burbs I'm talking about. I know, I know. I did a different on purpose. I was almost doing the regular ones. Have you always been a fast eater? A very, my dad was a fast heater and so I looked at it, it's like a rite of manhood and you eat fast and that's whole man back then.

Speaker 6:          01:44:33       I eat horrifically fast. How, how? He's really fast to my daddy's real fast. Like, like I'm like a shark. Like I, I literally, my eyes go back in my head and I just, and I just can't stop. I can't, I, I, I don't know how to do the thing. It's, this is a super fat person thing where you're like, well, like even it's really good, but I'm totally full, but like I can't not eat everything. Right. And then you're like, oh, it's really hurts. And you still like Keith deedee and you're like God. And then sometimes it's somebody like a sensible not fat person. They'll be like, you know, you don't have to keep eating that. And you're like, oh yeah, I didn't think about that. If someone makes me a meal, I'll let you know. I'm not going to leave one part, not eaten all of it.

Speaker 6:          01:45:17       I'll heed all of it. I find it disrespectful to not eat everything. Last night I had fought a friend's house and I didn't, I was not hungry, but they served me a big bowl of pho, ate the whole thing. I didn't want it. I just ate it cause I was like, I was shitting at the comedy store last night because of it. I was a store. I'm like that. It was great. It was, it was great. It was really awesome. Um, I also, if I'm that way with booze you like, I cannot leave. I cannot leave a d. Like if someone gives me, opens a bottle of wine, I go, we're going to drink the whole bottle of wine, not gonna drink half of it. If someone gives me a beer, I'm not going to leave. I'm going to drink the whole beer. I'm not going to say, you're not going to leave here unless you finished six more beers and a bottle of Tito's I have to finish.

Speaker 6:          01:46:01       Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're fine. One of the first times, one of the first times I started and drink for like six months when I was dating Leanne, because we, she dumped me for early on for drinking. No, it wasn't for drinking, but I, but what we got into a fight was I was drunk when that happened and I got, I felt like alcohol betrayed me for the first time. So I was like, I'm putting alcohol in timeout. And then I was like, and then I got to a place, I was like, maybe I'll never drink again. I thought that. And then we went to Italy and it was snowing. We were in Venice, it was snowing and we were, and it was like during a vacation. So gnomes on this roads? No, it was on the streets. And we went to a little restaurant and it started snowing and she said, I say we just walk around all night.

Speaker 6:          01:46:41       And I was like, I gotta be honest with you. I really want a glass of wine and I hadn't drank or wanted to drink in six months. She goes, do it. I don't give a fuck. And I was like, really? She goes, yeah. She goes, I don't think of a drinking problem. I just think you drank a lot, but here's now, but this is going from not drinking at all. So I have a couple of glasses of wine. They bring the bottle out and I go, we're not going to leave the fucking bottle. We're going to murder the goddamned bottle. Like I'm not going to. And I hadn't drank at all and had one glass. I felt really buzz. I go, we're killing the whole bottle now. I'm burping a lot. And I notice it. Um, and then we killed the bottle and we walked out in the snow.

Speaker 6:          01:47:11       It was one of the most romantic nights I ever had in my life. Oh, it's fucking great. And in Venice? In Italy and just snow, it just started falling. It was brand new. Snow covered streets known had walked on it, it was like midnight and it was right after New Year's Eve. So everything was shut down. Like your honeymoon or no, it's that she thought I was going to propose to her. Yeah. And I didn't, I did it in our bed and of later. So the way that you walked through and she was like, here it is. I can't be like, oh, I gotta take a shit. Pretty bad going on at the time I shoe. Huh? What, what are you crying for?

Speaker 5:          01:47:45       Wait, why did she dump you?

Speaker 6:          01:47:47       We got into a fight with her friend and I wouldn't let it go. Her friend picked a fight with me at a dinner and I wouldn't let it go. And I, I like, after three days I was still upset with it and, and, and I hadn't said, I love you to her yet. She had said, I love you to me. And I hadn't said Olivia. Uh, four months. She's like, I love you and you're like, cool. I said, cool. And she goes, I said, no, actually. I said, she goes, I love you. And I said, you do? She said, yeah, and you love me. And I said, I do. She said, yeah. And I was like, cool. And I just wasn't, I wasn't, I wasn't ready to settle down. I didn't want to like, I didn't know. I didn't want to put labels on it at

Speaker 5:          01:48:28       the time. 28. God, you guys are old now. Two kids are grown ass kids, man. No Shit. Brow. We have babies in this for forever now. He just fucking started.

Speaker 3:          01:51:23       No Way. Tommy is the opposite of, of everything in my family, but that's why I was so attracted to him cause he's like stable and sane and kind and he does what he says he's going to do and like he's just

Speaker 6:          01:51:35       for him. Do you feel like, and I'll say this, I know that you're successful, but none of us in this room are as accessible as Tommy. Of course. You feel like you picked the right horse. Oh my God.

Speaker 5:          01:51:46       All the time. Whoever's on common. If you had said to me one of your friends is going to be famous, I'd be like, whoa.

Speaker 3:          01:51:56       I say to him all the time, what do I tell you, Tommy? What do I say to you? You him, you said, uh, she goes, he's a winner. Yeah. I knew. I knew you were a winner. Here's the truth. Burt shot is that I knew Tommy was a goddamn winner from the moment that I met him. We know. Remember, we're all fucking open. Miker is, will you're, you're in a class ahead of us whenever, but like Tommy was 23 and he was funnier. Everybody, like he's the kind that started standing up and was amazing. It's Dan so far and I bombed in front of Burt 10 times. Yeah, but you also think fucking you're thinking was straight. I always knew that you would be,

Speaker 6:          01:52:30       I'll tell you what I heads, I'll tell you what I knew Tom. He was a winter. Yeah. Is, uh, we did a TV show and they were like, hey, I was like, we need to bring in a writer. Do you have any suggestions? I go, my buddy, Tom Segura is a really great comic. He could be writer and I was, I think I was doing birth conquered at the time. And so I went to do birth conquer. I came back a week later and Tom head, not only taking the head writers job, but he was also executive producing the show. The guy who was the executive producer was now doing crowd control. Mary go buddy Tom James the whole fucking show. He's like, so here's the breakdown, I'll show you how it works. And he show ran the whole show. And I was like, shut the fuck up. And that show was the funniest fucking show that's ever called buzzed. Oh, I remember

Speaker 3:          01:53:21       fucking brainer like it was. And he was, but that's why I picked exactly. If it makes sense. And it was designed for Bert, like literally you couldn't have anybody else. And the pilot was hilarious. Hilarious. And they knocked that, they shut it down immediately. Like it wasn't easy. Was involved. Yeah. And they were like, the show's called buttons, but there's those dating shows where they put boo boos and all those people. The premise, the blind date show is boozing. No, no, no. Remember

Speaker 6:          01:53:53       they had a sober, for those of you listening, we had a segment called, um, called, uh, was it, uh, look at her, stick it, yeah. Where it was like we'd put up a slow celebrity and you'd have to guess if she was straight or gay. Yeah. And so hilarious. It was hilarious. And it was like, it was like Hilary Swank, uh, uh, Jennifer Garner. And then it was Jamie Lee Curtis and this guy goes, stick it. My Dad fucked her and we're like, what? And he goes, my calf, Fuck Jamie Lee Curtis. And I go, I always heard she's a hermaphrodite. And he goes, no, my dad fucker. But then again, what would my dad say? He fucked a dude. Probably not. There's only one way to find out. I'm going to call him. And we go, I go, if you call them, you get an extra hundred dollars. That the Bose speaker phone speaker mode.

Speaker 6:          01:54:34       He goes, dad, did you fuck Jamie Lee Curtis and his dad on the back goes affirmative duty. Do you remember the Mexicans and headbutted each other? No. We, these two Mexican guys and Tom had a segment called, uh, uh, Mexican or an automatic scan. Maybe get one. Right? That was all Latino's. Jennifer Lopez. Mexican. That's right. This was a guest they were basing it on. Whoever was the most successful was Mexican, Mexican. And they're like, they're like, yeah. They're like, she kills it. She's Mexican. And we're like, Nah, she's Puerto Rican. This show is so great. We've got these girls in these hot three girls and there was this thing that we're going to have one girl put lipstick on. Another girl with her toes. Yeah. Like hold it and draw it and, and do lipstick. Yeah. With their tall. And then she goes, can I do it with my tits? No, no, no. This is exactly where I go. So ladies, I don't know if you noticed this, but none of you are wearing lipstick. And one of my favorite things in the world as a woman would lipstick. So the challenges now, and she goes to put it all on my tits and I went, yes it is. Yes.

Speaker 6:          01:55:36       And she goes, what have I put it on her with my tits? I'm like, that'll work. Also, there was no rhyme or reason. It was so fun. Facts as you guys were drinking during the show, and I, they have a problem with that. Here's the, he was not, I was not the guests could, she could be on buzzed, they were on buzz, but with what they blue was their bank account. So if you boil, it blew over 2.25, then we added a zero at the end and you started the bank with $250. And on the ride home you could win more money, but that's money you had to gamble.

Speaker 1:          01:56:06       My favorite segment, what was that? Was I would read a description, you'd guess that this was a television show or not. So I'd be like, you know, like, uh, um, a divorced mother or a struggling family in the Midwest. Uh, the mother works at a plant and the father does this and they have three children, and then they would be like, yeah, that's, yeah, that's a real show. But then we could come up with these ridiculous descriptions of shows. So it would be like, um, uh, a man, uh, lost his legs in a war, but through the, through prayer he became a champion boxer and they're like, that's a real show. But just try to miss like, I miss guided with these absurd descriptions and they would get most of them wrong. Like even ones that were blatantly clearly made up.

Speaker 6:          01:56:56       Oh Dude. Do you remember when the guy was on his first date with this chick? And we're like, have you ever performed oral sex on an animal? And he goes, uh, chipmunks once, and we're like, excuse me? He goes, hold on, let me explain. I was like, ah. You're definitely explained. He was, it fell out of a tree. Resuscitation did, who's the funniest fucking show? But they canceled it. They canceled it immediately and then they're like, it has alcohol. We're like, you paid for this show. It was called buzzed. Yeah, they did a shot at comedy central to celebrate it. They lay on their, all the pilots. They did a shock. They loved it. Turned the lights on there. Like how many episodes did we picking up? Guy raised his hands from ad sales. He said zero. He goes, I can't sell that show. It's really cool that before they ordered the pilot. Well you would think so. You'd think so.

Speaker 1:          01:57:46       Yeah. You got something there Jane? No. Oh, you doodling. All right. Um, the body shots world tour is a, is everywhere. Um, he's going to look, seems like there's some tickets left in Australia. Maybe

Speaker 6:          01:58:00       Australia has got some tickets left. It's a little ways away. I think Europe's entirely sold out. Um, I will be in DC, New Jersey, Philly, uh, wise guys who sold out paramount and Denver on the 23rd and then ending it in Wisconsin, Milwaukee and Minnesota at the end of March. Awesome. It's been the greatest. I'm, I'll be dead honest with you, man. I, I've for those, those who the dewar don't know. Tommy and I are really good friends and so we've talked a lot and to watch your tours and to see you do all these tours and to to look at him and go, I wonder what that's like. I wonder if it's overwhelming. I wonder like just have all those thoughts in your head and then to do it for the first time. Dude, it's the favorite. It's the favorite thing I've ever done in this business ever.

Speaker 6:          01:58:47       This tour is the greatest thing I've ever done. I've never had more fun ever my entire life and I fucking, I just, I honestly only wish that we were doing it together. Now look, it would be fun to be on a tour bus together, have to tour and going into cities. It would be so much fucking fun. I look at, I look at pass Torian going mid. Joe would have loved this. Yeah. Joey, Ari and red band back in the day. He would have loved, it would have been, it would change his life. It would have been. It's a game changer. That's my next goal is to get like do a big tour with all of us and just tore Bust Caravan. Like fucking a band. Yeah, just pulling into venues.

Speaker 1:          01:59:27       Oh, there you could wrap all the buses and each individual guys face.

Speaker 6:          01:59:33       Yeah. This is Ari's buzz. This one's toms by us and then we get let the other people picked the wrappings for the buses.

Speaker 1:          01:59:40       Oh Man. We got to do that for Ari. Oh, you'd love this hall with your butthole. And then we put like what I wanted to do during the sober October thing was get him a rental car with, um, just like honk if you think I'm funny. Kind of quotes on there and just put like, Hahaha.
