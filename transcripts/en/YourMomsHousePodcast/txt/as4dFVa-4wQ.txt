See it tastes better when it comes from someone else.

Speaker 3:          00:05:26       How angry would your mom get growing up when you and I wrote him like that please. And it never did make me laugh. Of course. It still makes me laugh. Burps and farts. High Action makes me laugh. Her upset makes me laugh. Right. But for me, I like your burps the best because I feel like they always tell a story. Thank you. The way that you like, it's nice to be appreciated. I love the, um, the, the forcefulness. Think what I like, what makes me laugh all the time. When you belt, it's that you're so subdued. Like you're so chill and then your, your burps are just violent rips. Yeah. You're like, ah, but then you always maintain, you're still composure. Yeah. That's the fast part is it? You don't even let the hype get to your own head. Thank you. Yeah. I've always been good at, you know, being modest. Yeah. You just kind of let it go. You just let it roll. Thank you. And wait for people to acknowledge how good you are. Thank you. Speaking my language. I can't wait for Ellis to start ripping up. And then he smiled. He's like, he likes them right now. Yeah. We got him to go after he drinks. That's super funny. That is funny. He learned that from you.

Speaker 4:          00:06:45       All right, let's, um, let's pull this out far. These genes away. Ready? Yeah, let's do it. Man.

Speaker 5:          00:06:53       You got three man that weigh over 200 pounds a piece. A woman that's a little plump girl and a daughter who's 13 and you're going to try to take 12 of trouble sausage and a couple of dozen eggs and piggy back. It ain't gonna work.

Speaker 1:          00:07:12       Don't bring in one loving to then go to your mom's house. Christina. Yeah, there you go.

Speaker 4:          00:08:04       I love it. It's just for our people with it following the audio saga. Uh, I just hired an audio engineer. Did they ain't gon fuck such so annoying. Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:08:18       Um, wait a minute. Wait, you're just going to let that roll. You're not going to compliment me on that. That was great. That was a great burger. First of all, I held it in for a longer time just to let it grow and build. Yeah, I look, I restrained myself and then I lie that a go. It was really good.

Speaker 4:          00:08:38       Not really.

Speaker 3:          00:08:43       Probably that's why about audio. Oh shoot.

Speaker 4:          00:08:45       So this is actually the old, old board. I have it hooked up through a direct box in there. Nothing. I get like minimal sound. So can we not play? Oh, those are just drops. We can't play still. Yeah. It's just, it's super frustrating. I don't know what else to do. Well that's why I hired someone and he's coming in. Yeah. It's maybe by next week it'll be fixed. Yeah. Maybe. Maybe speaking of holding in, so you held it in that burp. Do you remember what happened last week? Yeah, so I wrote it down so we could discuss it today. So you made, remember you all of a sudden you got to kick in the, uh, we'll, we'll get to the sausages here anymore. Of course we're going to get it done. You got you in the middle of the day. We were going to have something for dinner and you're like, I really want Mexican. Well, there's a story to that too. We'll get into that in the moment. So, but we did it, you know, somewhat healthy you style because we didn't meet, but we did a lettuce wraps instead of shells. Right. And then you have some cheese and whatever. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:09:51       So that's our version, you know, of Mexican. Anyways. That meat though has a little bit of, you know, it's meat. Has some grease to it. And then we had moms sashes and evening probably three or four hours after we ate man. Like as soon as I laid on that table, I was like farts right at the door too. Like they were like, excuse me, like knocking on the door. And did you actively clench your cheeks hard? Yeah, I did. And you know, I remember really having to focus and kind of feeling like you can't really relax. And then, I mean I held them for awhile and that they were fighting, you know, they wanted to come out and then probably about an hour into it I feel like wow, they're totally gone. And so, but that's what happens is they go up inside of you. But here's the neat part of the story.

Speaker 4:          00:10:43       So it was it like, you know, after, after it was over, everything was fine. It didn't really have those farts anymore. Wait, you're saying so eventually you will, you clenched you clients to clenched and the farts went up inside of you and you were able to relax through the rest of your massage. But after, I mean, I guess I cleanse for a while and then all of a sudden we're back at, you know, bedtime or laying around. I have like one little fart and I'm like, Oh, where, where are the farts? That's the thing. I don't know where they are. And I'm curious because I could feel that they were really there and you felt them up inside of you. That's right. So the next morning, but no, I didn't really feel that anymore. I can just go like there. I don't know where it is. They're just going. So the next morning though, I have a early flight so I get up before you're up. Oh, you are super early. That day I remember that. I go down in the kitchen, I make myself a cup of coffee and I start ripping like 15 seconds and I heard them from upstairs. They were like, like really, really good. The neighbor was starting a motorcycle or something. It was something

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       something was going on and I realize those parts did I held 12 hours earlier or whatever. We're finally finding their way out. Wow. Isn't that something? Wow. What a neat story. Thank you. I mean, I'm thankful that they came out in the house and not on the plane. I just orient the airport or in the car ride anywhere. They were for a while. And did they smell worse cause they had been fermenting in the, I don't really think so. They here, you hear him in the background a little bit. It's so faint and I'm so upset that I can't.

Speaker 3:          00:12:30       Yeah, you can't really hear him. That's a problem with the, yeah. Yeah. That's asked for it. Whereas I recognize that part anywhere. Yeah, I know it. Even when it's faint, like the, it's like the distinct cry of your own baby. I understand it. King up was, there's like a son. He's like a source. Now it's interesting that you mentioned the Mexican food because I too, the reason, well here's my story leading up to the Mexican food is that I was making Brown's every day, every morning, but they were small and they weren't girthy and they weren't really what I'm accustomed to and so I thought, you know what I'm going to do? What I normally do is I kind of give myself a little diarrhea, like not a lot, just a little to get the system going, get the pipes out, get the pipes cleaned and then move on.

Speaker 3:          00:13:22       And so what I normally do is I ordered Thai food and I'll get like a Penang curry or something and put some extra Surratt Sri Registry Racha and there. So I ate the Thai food and then I was like, this is going to be at next morning. Here it comes. No browns like it was just like a normal brown. So wait how constipated constantly like I was making the browns but they were kind of, is it for when they're a little harder, lower down the scale, like a six lower down the scale, like a seven, a three well three still pretty healthy. I mean one and two are pretty hard. It wasn't hard. Just not a lot came out. Oh well balls, but not a lot. Not like pebbles when they're pebbles, you're just dehydrated. And I wouldn't even dream of being dehydrated. It doesn't anymore. So I got the tie and then I thought, well, she really, I got to amp this up to the next day.

Speaker 3:          00:14:20       I had Korean food that usually does it. The soondubu soup. Nothing really. I'm thinking I got to go Mexican and that's when we went to a whole farts and we got all the stuff for Mexican and I'll tell you what next morning, big chocolate city, Brown everywhere. And I think it's the salsa. It's actually the salsa that does it for me every time. So you didn't have farts during that mom's size? No. Really? No. The mid, the next I felt like, oh, I gotta shit pretty hard. And I'd also had dino tying Korean behind the Mexican. So f a r k still got that one. That's the best. That lady, she said. She said if f a R T F A R t. O. N. A nerd. Remember at the, uh, at that tells that that national thing though she was drunk. She was like fucking yes, correct. The hypocrite. A R. T. Yeah. Yeah. Hypocrite. Yeah. Um, Eh, eh,

Speaker 4:          00:15:24       that's really funny. Um, well that was something, I mean, I'm glad you were able to, but what we also discovered something else that we haven't had, we haven't brought up.

Speaker 3:          00:15:31       What's that? Oh my God. Revelation. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:15:36       Have, um, we've had this, your friend brought this to our sources on the street. Yeah. So everybody's always like, oh my God, I'm dreaming of a double five class. Like, when will it happen? Can I get one? Does this count? And there's, you know, I sneezed and I course like, no, of course not. No. So a double pipe classic if you don't know, is it an expression I coined a very proud of that. And it's when somebody burps and farts at the same time, um, it is, it's really quite rare, uh, and, and really, uh, a moment to celebrate. And most people go quite some time without experiencing it. Sometimes years in between mine. Yeah. I mean, I've met people, you know, whenever I meet somebody and they have the, the elbow classic shirt, I go, did you earn it?

Speaker 3:          00:16:21       We'll say, yeah, that's what he will say. No, I have it. And I go, wow. Leaving, you know, you know, you know we should do for those who have had one, yeah, we should put like a, a gold metal, like a gold star Gold Star. And then if you haven't, you just haven't earned your stripes yet. You're like really good idea. Yeah, we have to reproduce it. Oh, and if you've had multiples, it'll be like in the military, like you get your stripes. Yeah. Like you're a five star general. Yeah. Wow. Maybe you're, imagine having a five in a lifetime. Unheard of. Unheard of. Really crazy. You can't do that. Well I think I've had three or four. So stops now you're just exaggerating. You've been there for a couple.

Speaker 4:          00:17:01       So. So anyways, we're talking to one of your sources who I think has her first. She just had her first. She has her first and she goes, I think I might know the secret to it. So we, you know, we stop what we're doing with that. Put the baby on the ground. Like what? And she said he too. It all might be to be constipated. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:17:24       Wow. Think about that for a moment. I'm pondering it now for if you're constipated, you have that kind of extra push. Yeah, no, you have more gas kind of floating in there. So

Speaker 4:          00:17:35       are like constantly kind of, you know, doing a little extra grunt. Right. So maybe in the world of it. So in a, in a, in a way here, and I'm sorry to tell you this, we're going to encourage you to dehydrate yourself. Go ahead and slow down your consumption. Yeah. And see if maybe you can get lucky. Right? Apparently dehydration is the key to a successful double pipe. Classic. [inaudible] wow. What an interesting revelation. Neat story. I know. I feel like we need an x, a special sound for, for something like that for, do you have anything there? Not much. Yes. A R t. There you go. Yeah. That's the sound.

Speaker 4:          00:18:18       Oh boy. What is that? Still have that baby that was like that little Dominican guy. Remember? He looks like a kid. He was a really fired up. Oh, that's in here. Can you turn, can you turn that audio up? That, that sounds low to me. I am a man Nigga. Oh yeah. I remember that. Yeah. Once you put that in order in there. Yeah. Hmm. That's thanksgiving. He's telling you there's no more leftovers. Oh, remember? Yes I do. No, I'd come here. Let me tickle you. I don't like that one. Well, let's go. Let's, let's talk about this. Yeah, it looks good. Um, my favorite part about this is that this is real. A guy called on the, like the one 800 number for that. You know the actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan Sausages. Yes. This is his sausage company. This is Jeffrey Dean Morgan Sausage. And he has a, you know, a 800 number where I guess people can leave a message. This guy left a long message where he's really upset if they change the size of the sausages they sell. Huh. And is a problem.

Speaker 5:          00:19:36       I don't know where the people come from. I don't know. If you test your product, your quality of your product, your product, very delicious. Love your sausage for 30 something here. But I can't take and feed a family of five on a little 12 ounce roll of voltage. I don't mind paying you more money for your 16 ounce roll of sausage, but you don't have it anymore. You've got a 12 ounce roll.

Speaker 4:          00:19:59       So apparently they changed size of sounds like it. It had a 16 going and then they change the 12 but then they also sell a bigger, but it's bigger than 16 so he's upset because they've eliminated the perfect size for his, for his needs right now it sounds like. Why doesn't he just get to hours? It doesn't want to do that. He wants to buy a 16 okay, now he's got to spend more money for two twelvers Oh, I see, I see.

Speaker 5:          00:20:24       So you've got three man that weigh over 200 pounds a piece. A woman that's a little plump girl and a daughter who's 13 and you're going to try to take a 12 pound proba sausage and a couple of dozen eggs and piggy back. It ain't gonna work. Apple

Speaker 4:          00:20:40       a it. So he's got 24 eggs. Why not do 24 rounds? Is it, how many people are we talking about here now, right it the 13 year olds,

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       three grown men, fat wife. You say three grown men? I think you said three minutes

Speaker 5:          00:20:52       and you got three man that way.

Speaker 3:          00:20:54       So three guys that are 200 pounds. Oh, losers are living with him. The big lady and the girl. That's five people. Five people have 24 eggs. That's insane. Tour. How many in between? Let's do the math. 524 that's like four and a half each of eggs a day. No, this is a meal we're talking about, right? Right. So five people. Five people each have three eggs. It's 15 right? So He's, but he's feeding them almost five eggs per customer. This is a lot bananas. Yeah, we don't even go through that much. Jesus. Why would we go? What do you mean what? We don't eat well because I do the grocery shopping and we go through a ton of eggs and a ton of bacon. I know, but it's no baby jeans. You and myself. And this is more people and these are more fat people.

Speaker 5:          00:21:40       And as far as your 16 ounce and label and Phage, I don't eat that. I'm not fuck that man.

Speaker 3:          00:21:46       No north

Speaker 5:          00:21:49       sausage bothering people to eat with the breakfast with the fried egg and a t bone steak. Oh,

Speaker 3:          00:21:55       okay. I didn't know that it was specific to an area. Well that, what'd he say? Maple and sage. That I, that's in the north. Hi Nina. Her mind I gotta tell you I don't want that either. Fuck that shit too. Cause I don't like that sage. That's the thing. I don't like an American breakfast sausage. I hate it. All the herbs and like, I don't like it. Don't like it. I like it either. Playing like what this guy is talking about, dude. Yeah. I like a like a fancy one. Yeah. You know, he's got a good one. Is Ralph's good sausage, breakfast sausage. They have it. It's the kind that they make there. I got it for you a while back and I really liked it. I'm going to try Jeffrey Dean Morgan Sausage soon. Yeah. I want to try it

Speaker 5:          00:22:31       and I think the want to a little 12 ounce package, the feet or five people and I'm not going to buy two of those 12 and where you go because you won't bounce out and charges thing and got damn pri.

Speaker 3:          00:22:46       He's real upset. Well look, if you love your Jeffrey Dean sausages, Morgan Jeopardy, Morgan sauces so much, then pay the extra few bucks. Right? Yeah, I agree. If you're hooked on the flavors, you've got to evolve, dude,

Speaker 5:          00:22:59       but what is sure like you to go back to your 16 ounce package on your record often cause I'm not going to buy it otherwise. Yeah. I'll just have my own damn fault mate. Like I used to years ago. It's not tasty as yours yet, but it'll work.

Speaker 3:          00:23:14       Okay. Yeah, man, it's quite a threat. Do you think the people at Jeffrey Dean Morgan Morgan were like, we got to go back to doing it because it is fun. Maybe. Maybe they heard this one message and they're like, all right, I've got to be it. I always wonder that when people are leaving a message like that, can you think they're going to say, oh, fucking Roger said the change our size. Well, if enough Rogers I guess leave messages. Yeah, that's true. Critical, critical mass.

Speaker 5:          00:23:40       No, no. 12 map. Goddamn roller. Call your brother and me and you kind of found the man. At least you get my point,

Speaker 3:          00:23:50       right.

Speaker 5:          00:23:51       I put it in that fucking pussy role with ball throwing up a bitch. Somebody need their ass kicked by Middle Consumer Geek. Lord. Fuck this shit up.

Speaker 3:          00:24:00       Whoa. I like that. He actually thought it was, yeah, it was a good thing. Yeah. And then he lost it at the end. Cause I like the, the severity of it for him. Like it was a real problem with this guy had to take to the phone line.

Speaker 4:          00:24:16       Hold on. What's up? Hold on. All right, we're back. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:24:20       no. I know the severity of, of making that call, it really bothers him so much that he has to find the number and call. I don't think I've ever done that for like a product I really enjoyed. I just take it. I'm like, oh, they changed it. Oh well I guess they changed it. People Change. People Change. April changes, little changes all the time. Yeah. Right. When did you just kind of roll with the change? Of course. I don't know if I'd take to the phones. Oh my Lord. How about wait, what does he, he ends on this. Let's see if we can get even more mad.

Speaker 5:          00:24:46       Z money. Save money. Save money. Fuck, I'm gonna eat. Got Dennis.

Speaker 4:          00:24:52       Wow. Fuck. I'm gonna eat God damn it. See how it is interesting. Don't you think that when you do, when your message changes to that, then they just probably disregard your message? Well, probably listening to his message.

Speaker 3:          00:25:05       Right? And he's like fucking pussies. There you go. Then you lose credibility. I think so. Now what I've learned about white people complaining what you do when you're like, it's spas are a nice hotels and you've taught me this cause I used to go the angry route and sometimes it does work. Yeah, but you've taught me that the wider you go, the way you complain, the more respect you get.

Speaker 4:          00:25:27       Well, here's what it's about. I learned this too, and I learned this from doing it the other way. You basically have to complain to the people you're complaining about in the way that they respond to Barry Go. So if you're in a high end place, right, you have to complain the way a high end, like the way they would respond to them, which means you have to keep your composure. You can't curse, can't, you can't get all ad, they're not going to respond. What they respond to in like a nice hotel or a nice restaurant is if you complain about you, you tell them, I'm really disappointed in my experience and here's why. And you lay it out for them, then they, that's the language of that world. Yeah. So they reply, they can understand that if you're, I dunno, maybe on a shooting range and fucking Arkansas, right. I Dunno if doing that that way would maybe there you got to be like, I just fucking bullshit

Speaker 3:          00:26:20       man. And then, yeah. And that's, that makes sense. Yeah. But the people at Jeff Jeffrey, Dean Morgan, I don't know if they'd respond to that. Yeah, I dunno. I Dunno.

Speaker 4:          00:26:30       That's a good, that's a good question. But it is like people respond to their, their language.

Speaker 3:          00:26:34       Yeah, that's true. Sometimes they don't respond to enough. Like I remember at the time we were in Dr and the, I forget what they, what did they done all, we went on some thing and they promised it was going to

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       be great and it was terrible. Yeah. I feel like we had been robbed of a day of our vacation cause they are like take this tour and they ended up throwing us on a bus. It was horrible. It was, the whole thing was disappointed. And I told the guy, I like, hey man, you stole a day of our vacation. Like you're, you're supposed to vouch for this thing being a good thing. And it was not, and he was starting to blow me off. Okay, well too bad. And I was like, no, no, no, not too bad. You fucked up my vacation. Yeah. And I used fucking everything. And then we got some free massage and that was the time that I worked together. A lot of line. That's what Dominican's respond to. You spoke their language. There you go. And that's the same place that they had porno in every room on channel six, nine hardcore pornography.

Speaker 4:          00:27:28       That place. Yeah, but not, sorry, not every room had it cause the dad boners the pool. I saw it for a second. It was like kind of came in and out and I was like, we have it all the time. He was like, what we did. It was so ridiculous. It's crazy. Ooh, Ooh. Speaking of, um, just went out. You said complaints or how white people complain you yesterday where the Oscars the ultimate grant and last year, you know, Oscar's so white was trending. It was a big thing about not having people of color nominated. Oh yeah. I remember this year, uh, not only were there black winners, a black bummer won best picture. That's usually a white category. Bummer of the year. And this year was a black bummer. Well, all black cast to be able to be fair.

Speaker 4:          00:28:24       Well, no, no. Now it's different. They did a team votes, but I'm saying that it used to be not only obviously what white people mostly nominated, all the academy members were mostly older. And so now we switched out the academy members of the academy. People of color. Yeah. So it's, it's more diverse and a black bummer is a rare category. Won Best Picture. Moonlight. We have it. By the way. We should watch. I won't watch it. I want to see it. Not because it's a bummer. I can't, I can't, I don't want to see over white bummers. I'd like to see that black men were like this. I don't, that guy's a really good actor too. I like if he's on, he's on a house of farts. He won best actor. He's got a gay black came in. Like what it's like to, this is what I've heard. A gay black in inner city, Miami. Slu. Or it's like in a place where like that shit's not celebrate it like the, you know, the struggle of that.

Speaker 3:          00:29:47       Okay. What era? Eighties you say? No, I didn't say era. Um, I don't know. I think it's contemporary. Yeah, no. Yeah, I think so. Well, Miami, you're saying, yeah, it takes place in Miami. No, you were saying that in Miami they teach them how to give blow jobs. I'm sorry, I didn't, where'd she saying this? That The may have sex much earlier. They do the Puerto Rican. Yes.

Speaker 4:          00:30:08       Well just the children, but no, I have, you know, I grew up a couple of hours. I say this people lot of times or like you said, you grew up in like all these places. Yeah, I grew up in a bunch of places. Yeah, you moved around a lot. When I, I lived for a few years at most of what my high school years were in a few hours north of Miami and I've, you know, some friends from down there and lived down there and they said they were overly sexualized at a much younger age because culturally it was just more,

Speaker 3:          00:30:38       hey mommy. Yeah, it's a super Latin hypersexual hypersexual culture. It is hypersexual. Yeah. I mean I remember the Latin influenced, to be honest. That's Latin. Well that's Puerto Rico. I'll tell you why. Not just, well, some of it because when I went, we went to Puerto Rico member. We were, yeah, we just wanted to cruise the manikins by the way, are way more sway. Way over sexy. Yes. But in Puerto Rico I was like, remember we docked and I was like, I'm finally here. It's my motherland. And I was so excited to finally, yes, soak in my culture. My people and I, we went to like just the souvenir shops right off the boat. Docking area. Yeah. And every towel was like naked chick naked guy. Guy Handshake on top of each other. Like super sexual culture. Hypersexual

Speaker 4:          00:31:23       yeah. I'll tell you this in a, I talked to a former pro baseball player and he said this is an open secret baseball. Baseball has a huge Latin professor. Dominican's right. Has a huge Latin population. Okay. The Dominican's specifically within major league baseball, like the pro baseball league in America. Yeah. They, he said 99% of the time shower separately from the rest of the players and it's, it is a regular practice. It is known amongst major league players that you don't shower with the Dominican, the Dominican shower by themselves. And the reason is because they get overtly sexual to the point. But like it's cool to like each other but like Dick's lat but Dick's labs where they think it's normal, nobody else does. And my knee slapping their dicks against each other's ass and he said it's 100% uh, accepted thing and they know that those guys aren't gay, but nobody else is cool with their shower behavior. So they let them, they said that he said like they all shower set. This is like a guy who went into detail about it. Yeah. And uh, you know, I don't want to say his name, but he, me, he was in the, in the League for 10 seasons or you know, and he played on a few different teams. Is that every team the same way? The are showering everybody else showers. Hey. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:32:49       So at least they know what they like, you know, resection come all over my face. That is so funny. Yeah. So we are, so my point being though, if Miami is so open sexually, I'm wondering why this boy, the story of,

Speaker 4:          00:33:03       well, the story specifically, kind of like, I believe it's like a of maybe like liberty city really intersect like hardcore Gotcha. Black, right, right, right. Where you know, it's a homophobic, yeah. More homophobic, less accepted that to be like a young gay black guy. So I mean, but look, it just won best picture, best supporting actor, best original screenplay or best adapted black bomber. Best Black Bummer of the year.

Speaker 3:          00:33:33       I am glad that La la land didn't, it did not win just because, well, I hate musicals. I know. I fucking hate him. And My, I was, I wanted to see that movie and 12 seconds of the movie, right? The plane yesterday, right? Oh, you did. And it opens,

Speaker 4:          00:33:49       uh, at a traffic jam and a car is like on, um, what's it called? One of those, you know, where they a moving shot where it's like, it's going past all the cars and it stops at this one car with his girl, like, ah, over it,

Speaker 3:          00:34:02       uh, traffic, uh, La Orange. The Cameron, she's like, there is something happening now. And she gets out of the car and a musical starts and I go exit. That's how much I want and I won't watch it. I have no interest. Yeah. Now here's the thing. You know how much I love my Ryan Gosling? Yeah, he's in that. I love him. And I love Emma. What's her tits at? What's her name? Emma Watson. Emma. Emma, Emma, whatever. I really like her. She won. Oh she did? She won. She's fantastic. And I like the two of them together and I won't go see the movie because I, the the people singing a dialogue to me it is not appealing. I fuck it. It makes me crazy to watch musicals. Yeah. The only music movie I like is the muppets. The muppet movie. Yeah. The Rainbow Connection Song. You know, that's cause it's the muppets.

Speaker 3:          00:34:53       I have no tolerance. Um, can I so fucking boring. I liked cats growing up. My mom took me to see cats. Did you ever see that one? No. Well that's cause they're all in cat outfits and they're pretending and cat. Oh, it's fucking boring too. God term it. That is boring. I don't, I'm just not into them. I'm not, I'm not cultured that way either. My parents forced me to a lot. Yeah. Like Swan, Swan Lake. That's fucking boring too. I don't want to see any of them right now, but we have to pretend that we're cultured people. We have to take our son to pretend like where culture. Don't wait. No, no, no, no, no, no. My parents did. No, no, no, no. There Europeans. I had to like learn all hold was like, do you really want to go kind of furrow brow? You sure you want to go to that?

Speaker 3:          00:35:41       You want to go to a Laker game? Maybe it was more fun. We got to teach him that this stuff exists. Right. I mean well your job. Yeah, but I'll be like, I'll put a DVD or you'd be like, doesn't that look terrible? I'll try to encourage that thought, you know? Um, cause it is hard for a kid to watch that. My parents used to take me and I was so bored. Oh yeah. He went every year to see the nutcracker and I fucking hated it. I don't want, I still don't want to sit through it and I don't want, to me, it's fucking boring. I'm not a ballet fan. I want to do this before I forget.

Speaker 3:          00:39:57       that's what's up. You understand that you don't got no sauce, then you're lost.

Speaker 3:          00:40:38       So you know what's going on there. No, but I think it's my favorite conversation I've ever heard. Pretty Great. I love that guy so much. Who He is? No, you don't know who that is. No clue. But I like him a lot. His Gucci Mane. Gucci Mane. Now that's before he, uh, he lost a bunch of weight. I don't know if you saw that. No, I didn't. Yeah, that's an old clip. He's, um, he looks way different now. You will see. Yeah, I like to see, okay. The Gucci Mane. When does he sing? I guy. Was he saying he sings? Um, God bless America and uh, but what's the song I would know because I know you like Gucci Mane. 100%. How dare you? I'm very cool. I'm a Midwestern mom. Let me show you. Moms know everything. Cool. So this is him right now. Right here. Oh, he looks great. Yeah. Okay. He's such good teeth. Yeah. Damn. Look at those teeth are perfect. He lost a bunch of weight. He's great. No

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       prison. I went to a program that'll do it, but he's actually in the end. He got, he got like off the lane. Yeah. He, um, so this is kind of like when that video was, you know, he's definitely chubbier he's got us, he put too much sauce on stuff. That's a problem. Yeah. And then there's weight loss. Yeah. Here's free prison. Okay. So yeah, he's a little filled out. His face filled that filled out and then out of prison. Wow. Lots of prison diet. It looks good son. It looks good. It looks good. This is good. He looks great. Yeah. Yeah. Fucking trap God doing this thing. Yeah. I mean you could see like damn dude, you got to go to prison. I don't know if you have to, but yeah, it definitely worked for him. His um, Dan, he's definitely got it for him.

Speaker 4:          00:42:19       I liked the sauce. Yeah. I wish I could, I'd have to listen to that and really break it down to, well that's what we do on premise. And then in philosophy you have your premise and then you're a and B's prep, prep, prep positions, propositions. So this is him syllogism Graham. See, right. Always looks good. Like he likes his, uh, he likes his clothes. This is lady. They're getting married. No Shit. She stuck with them when they, when he was in prison. That's a real bitch. There you go. I think that's what he would say to. Yeah. Oh, she's cute. Yeah, they look good. They look good together. Yeah. What do you know her name? Uh, I forgot it. I don't remember. Yeah, I don't remember her name. But I like it. Dude. I like this guy. You like Gucci? Ah, he loves the falcons. I liked that she was ride or die like that. Him and his girl. What's his name? Kesha.

Speaker 4:          00:43:18       Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And they look cute. Yeah, they're good couple. They are men. They remind me. A lot of us now I'm not going to find out that he like beats her song. Right? I don't know that shit. What was he in jail for? Oh No, it was like weapons. Drugs. Yeah. Okay. As long as it handle like parole violations. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah. So please, God dammit. Just to have some flat. Now let me have yours. I like yours because yours tastes better. It's Felicia. You understand what kind of, what's going on there? It's sauce, mean coolness. Well, I think you know better way to say it would probably be the confidence spice, right? Right. Confidence. Like he's like, you're not born with that shit. Like life has to season you a little bit. Yeah, I agree with that. Yeah. Some kids are balling your quotes, so how you can be born with seasoning.

Speaker 4:          00:44:28       It definitely saved. No me just hours before with sauce or do you look so different now? Now that you pointed that out? I would not recognize that dude, if you show me that picture before. No, no, no. It looks so much better now. Way Better. He's also like, like I said, he's kind of off of like every night smoking blunts, drinking because his face is puffy from all that I was getting fucked up and it's probably not sleep well. Yeah. I think he lost like 60 or 80 pounds, dude. Damn. Okay. Now do you think black people go nuts for black bomber movies? White people that go nuts for all bummer movies. Oh, that's interesting question. Yeah. I really wonder is that a good deal too? Who's the, who's the audience besides white people that really dig bummer? I guess all people love a good bummer, you know, to a degree. I mean, I think that crosses all, all races. Not like to be bummed out at the movies. Some people, I mean that's just the type of person. Regardless. You're right in that it's, I feel like you do see a lot of white people celebrating the bumper.

Speaker 4:          00:45:57       Generally the industry made of white people who love to applaud the bummer movie as opposed to the like the Rob Reiner film. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Or I'm upset. I get bummed out that we don't see a comedy celebrated amongst ever best screenplay. I mean a few, I guess I've been screenplays, but best picture, best actors, they never give them to a comedic performances. And the part that, that upsets me the most about that, and I know it's been said before, but it's very true, is that a lot of times these iconic comedic performances can only be done by that one person. Whereas the dramatic role, there's like 10 guys that could play that role. There's 10 girls that could play that, that dramatic role. But how many people can play Eddie Murphy in fucking movie? Uh, what, what is it where he plays all the characters, but no one else can do that.

Speaker 4:          00:46:54       Why isn't that celebrated? Huge talent, Jim Carrey in basically anything. It's just nowhere else could do that. Pet detective is one of the funniest fucking movies. I loved that movie. It is one of the only one of the funniest movies and no one else could play that role, but it could come close. Yeah, and if you were to suggest that he get an award for that, it wouldn't be like, oh, you're fucking, if you put him in a movie where he has cancer and dies and he said, oh, let's give it up fucking award. Like the gave, they nominated Bill Murray for lost in translation, which is a great movie and a great role, but I think you could

Speaker 3:          00:47:29       nominate him for 10 other roles. I think it comes down to the people don't have respect for comics, the whole thing and they don't realize like ups are like the clowns of the entertainment where the dog should have of the entertainment world, but we're also then fucking marine corps of entertainment. We're fucking writing it hardcore traveling alone. Yes. Motherfuckers soon as you see like an Improv show or a play please. Or even like acts where there's two people on stage, you have somebody else about like you're not up there alone. When you're alone, it's a totally different thing. A guitar. Yeah. Now they're like praying. It's something that you can kind of put off. Oh yeah. All of what's going on on. It's like it's all of a sudden you have support, right. I have this thing that can play as you're doing. It's not that it's not a skill or a talent because it is, but when you're alone with a microphone, it's way more.

Speaker 3:          00:48:22       You're way more vulnerable. You're way more vulnerable. It's all on you. You can't blame anybody. Yeah. It is the fucking Marine Corps of of entertainment and we don't get the respect. And by the way, a comedy actor can do a serious role, but not vice versa. Not necessarily. Not necessarily. It's very hard for us serious actor to do comedy. Now there's like your deniros who can get away. I think de Niro's funny is any like in meet the Fockers and the parents and the, I mean, I think part of that is it, that material is really good at that particular one. I don't think he's actually a funny guy. I think he's a good actor. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. You're right. Maybe he's not so funny. I'm trying to think of WHO's like bright who can do both. I mean, I know, I know Jim Carrey did man on the moon. Remember when he can do both?

Speaker 3:          00:49:07       He did. Kaufman? Yeah. Robin Williams. Mays. Yes. He was great at doing both, actually. Dramatic actor. Eddie Murphy is actually really, really good. He, I think he did get nominated when he played that dramatic role in the, what was the, it was like about Mo town or something. He played a part in that that got nominated for something so fucking talented date Kilis music and shit. You know, he made his money and he had a family last year, but it was a more serious drama. He's fucking talent. That guy, God dammit. Yeah. Like Jamie Foxx. He won an Oscar for playing a serious role though. Only serious give it to you for comedic role, which is so silly. I don't understand this. Yeah, I'm surprised. You know what white bomber didn't make it did. Maybe it did. I just don't, I didn't pay attention was the one that we saw the arrival, the one in the future and the alien thing I got nominated.

Speaker 3:          00:50:06       Oh yeah. How's it going? One? Yeah. Let's see. That was a good one. Yeah. That's not what not a dis drops tomorrow, right? Yeah. What are you talking about? When does this episode drought? Next week? No, tomorrow night. Oh, so we can still talk about Oscar Shit. We've, we've been talking about Oscars. Do we keep talking about it or are people going to be sick of this by the time this drops? That's what I'm thinking. But I mean, we've, we're, we're already into it. Okay. Right? Yeah, I know. Gosh. It just awesome. How am I hateful? I just what, what, what are you talking? Yeah, we're going out for a romantic getaway tomorrow night. Uh, arrival was nominated. Oh, that's good. Yeah. Not bummer. He enough though? Yeah. They had death in it, but not enough. It was her cancer, um, that she, oh, but she didn't get it. She didn't get a nomination for that role though, for a rival. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And that girl's name is Emma Stone. Emma Stone. Yeah. She's great. I liked her on sesame street too. She did balance. That was her thing was cute.

Speaker 3:          00:51:13       That's the letter of the day. It's a letter. It's a letter is the letter of the day. Hello? She means new album. I would love if he did sesame street. He probably will. I can't wait. You probably will. Yeah. I wish they would have us on sesame street. That would be like the dream. They're like now from your mom's house, podcasts, everybody pull your jeans up and then we met. We liked Grover's fart and then that's our scene. You think it'd be a fun thing to do? F is her fart. Yeah. They totally would let us. I don't think they would. Maybe we put the call out there. There's a fan that works on sesame street. Let us know. I would love to do sesame street. Are you kidding? I don't give a fuck about anything, but I would love to do sesame street. Sesame Street would be amazing cause shit probably have a little bit of a window where it could happen in where like your son can still see it.

Speaker 3:          00:52:06       Ah, it's so cool. Could you imagine your five years wash? Oh, it's easy. You like, hey guys. Yeah, that's right. The word of the day. Yeah. Wanting to the word of the day. Yeah. I want to the word of the day. I like it all. I love. I want to count something with account. Have you rad? Because we're talking about today. Have account is like, Oh gee, sesame street. Yeah. I love the count. I love snuffle up a guess. Um Oh. But Oscar the grouch by far is the funniest character on sesame street. He should so funny. He tells kids to Scram all the time. It's the best. Great. Now scram scram. So funny. That's great. And he's always making people miserable. Yeah. Sorry, we're having too much fun. Is too high. Porosity of about 40 to 45% as a response to the high water content of the shales from here to here, the neutron curve falls back to about 30 ferocity units.

Speaker 3:          00:53:07       While the density curve remains at about 16% indicating relatively less shale, there's owners interpreted it to be a silky shale, possibly align. Aisha says really boring. The same body is indicated at a depth of 12000% even a human. The look at in the gamma ray reading shit, Kamara. Yes, that's a no, it's bad. There's not even a person put interval of porosity is shown at the top where the porosity curbs average about 23% for us. What it felt like by the way, for being just below roll marathon bed. Yeah. I mean several groups exhibit a marked reversal and I see these people follow this right now that's a following or chemistry. I took chemistry for like a week in high school. This is what chemistry sounded like to me. Yeah, I you understand any of that show? It's so bad. God Damn. Hey, Sagar wrote in about sink holes where you read it. Yeah. Did you, I texted it to you. It's on your phone. My phone's dead. Um, sinkholes is a, it's a real deal, dude. We got into it last week and, um,

Speaker 4:          00:54:09       Holy Shit. You know what, just came out over the news right now. Hmm? That Elan Musk? Yeah. Space x Tesla CEO. Yeah. You're going to send to tourists to the moon next year. Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:54:19       Oh yeah. Cool. I definitely would not want that first ride. Would you

Speaker 4:          00:54:23       fuck that? Fuck No. But, um, I think it would be fun to hear the, um, the, the moon landing deniers. Crazy ladder as people start talking more. Yeah. So that's a letter of the British guy. So Adam wrote in hygiene on the topic of sinkholes. My house is half a mile from one here in Michigan at swallowed up, it opened up last month and swallowed a house. Repairs will take two years with the major road closed and the entire neighborhood smells like sewage every day.

Speaker 3:          00:54:54       Air Day. Yeah. Every day I'm hustling. Horrible, horrible, horrible. Has Real people. Yeah. And there's nothing. You can do nothing. And it comes out of the blue. It's not like there's an alarm, you can't call the uh, the city and be like, I demand the earth opened up. Do we have, um, insurance for that? Like, is that part of your house? Insurance is sinkhole insurance? Good question. But I want to put that one in here. That one out. Yeah. Now, let's see here. What did we not cover? Constipation equals farts equals double pipe. Classic. You're fart story. Let's see. I tried giving myself diarrhea check. Oh, I didn't also,

Speaker 4:          00:55:31       I've got a story. Go ahead. Well, this weekend I should say I was in Canadia and I had a great time. Um, I was in Edmonton, Calgary, Vancouver, and in Calgary I hung out with your old buddy

Speaker 3:          00:55:45       from road rules, Shane Jane,

Speaker 4:          00:55:48       his lovely wife, Christie. And um, there a sister in law and I had a great time there. And then Vancouver, Vancouver was bananas, um, at the, at the vogue. And you know, one of the things it was, it was so cool. It was like, there's all the over a thousand people there and, and then they're coming up to me and they're telling me how much fun they have. But they're also saying that like they watched a, they're like, I'm watching the lighting guy, the sound guy, and seeing like how everybody kind of works together and they're other tweeting me that they are enjoying that. And I was like, ah. They're like, you know, those are as much of a

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       part of the show is Tom. Yeah. Like even Tom, he's out there, but he's just one element of what's going on. It's such a, it's such a cool thing, you know, that like everybody was just like, ah, man, this whole shows such an awesome, neat thing and I just love, you know, it was just love all the components because really those guys are just as important as time, if not more. And without those guys, there's no you, you know? Yeah. And I'm just so thankful for the lighting guys and those great, you know, they're the real stars Tom, not you. Even the guys that load in, you know, they're just so important. Yeah. The guys a clean up after and even like when I get off and they don't say anything to me about the show, I still go, wow, you're so cool and important.

Speaker 3:          00:57:11       Can I tell you what that is? I feel like Garth, that whole thing of like they're just as there are the stars too. Like no, they're not. No, they're not. And here's why I'm not saying that they're not important. Not Everybody wants to be at the front of the line or in front of the audience. Some people enjoy being behind the scenes and that's okay. And that's what they want. They assume people assume that, that that guy looked at assumes everyone wants to be out. Right. He's assuming that he is better than them and he's trying to elevate them so that he doesn't look like a Turd, but it's like, dude, maybe they want to be behind maybe the fucking phony. Maybe the lighting guy doesn't want people watching him. Yeah. If you thought of that, like that's probably, and of course they know they're good at their job. I was doing it. I was in Edmonton as the same time as him. Oh my God. Did you know it? I was done. I sent him a tweet.

Speaker 4:          00:58:06       Um, he did nine Rogers arena show bananas. So he sold bananas hundred and 80,000 tickets. So you know how crazy that was to them. So you know, if you go to like for instance, staple center, uh, and you look on the ceiling, they have banners of championships. So it'll say that, you know, the 2002 Lakers, NBA world champions. Right. So in, in Edmonton, at Rogers arena, they have Oilers, you know, Yemen snorers my dad liked them. So I remember what hockey has, championship banners. Right. They added while he was there, a Garth Brooks banner that says nine sold out shows bananas with G J circle. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:58:51       G and t G. Yeah. You know what, and it happened while I was there. I feel like that, you know, well, you, you and I are the Garth and Trisha of podcasting, TNC, the comedy world, the TNC. TNC. Yeah. Love Tea, love, see love g and t and now it's Tennessee. Welcome to a studio G. Yeah. Happen pretty goes happy birthday to g two G two g his alter ego. Yeah, Trish. Really? I think he starts, he should start paying attention to Trish. Oh, packed on the pounds and a really short time. Oh well no, not that we did. We all don't at some time, but I think she, it happened fairly quickly. So I'm wondering if Tricia's okay, maybe she's depressed or sick or like what's, what's going on? I need some answers and if you guys could ask him on the next studio jeans, Hey, what's up with her weight gain? Why is Trish so fat guys? What's going on? And she's a pretty looking girl. She's pretty, pretty wise. Trousseau fat was just fat. How can Chris looks like bird phrase it that way. Portray she is a very beautiful woman. I just don't know what's going on with her when, when I um, I just want to thank the grips and the lighting crabby. Bert, Bert.

Speaker 3:          01:00:16       Gee, I'm going to start doing that now. A lot of people tweeted me his alter ego when he did that and I, and we've already covered that on your show. Them. Chris Gaines, it says, yeah, see that's the mental illness I'm talking about. That's the neat, but that, that's what I'm talking about. That, that weird, you know, maybe you know what, maybe it's just the pressure of the country audience that you have to be down to earth and real. I am, because I learned this listening to country music. People talk about it before, like, I forget where it was from, but Dolly Parton's is kind like she'll let people sleep in her backyard and stuff just so that she's not seen as as me. That's a big deal. And that and the country community, if you're seen as uppity or mean or snobby, forget it. Your career is dead. That's why this guy has got to be like 5 million tickets. Soul. Thank you. This is because he is because you, you made me, you like, he's like please fucking, you know, don't let, don't let my asshole personality come out. Cause if it does, I'm screwed. Like if I'm going to fucking Douche bag, it's out. It's over. So I think he's really making a plate to these fools.

Speaker 3:          01:01:26       Have you seen that? There's a video of him. I found, um, I think it was on Twitter where he's like 5 million tickets sold. It's all because of you guys. You did this. Thank you so much. Um, let's lie. You do videos. Why aren't you thinking you're fan? You should count the tickets and then thank him profusely. It every you guys did well, I already told him like, you know, I know that they love all the whole show. Every aspect is so exciting. I wish you would start bringing your manager on your social media and your eight and as my agent, he books all this stuff. Agent genes is coming over. That's right. He is. Maybe I'll do a video with him. That's right. Yeah. Well he's my agent to now know. So we got to thank him so much. So I got, I got an email, somebody wrote in, they said, what the fuck?

Speaker 3:          01:02:12       Why do you keep saying amaze and excite instead of amazing and exciting and I guess you know, this is probably a newer listener realize that Kim and Kim Man, yeah, she is the reason that we do that. And and uh, in, in this old video we played were interviewed her, she spoke like that. What is amazing is amazing and she has a very bizarre cadence. Someone's sending a new video, what is may her and I had gentlemen wait long hod how'd you say Goc yeah, it says she does, right? Yeah. So do you want to hear it? I can't play video. Mom, do you want to hear, I'm curious to see what she's up to. How is our grandma, she was on 60 minutes. 60 plus it's 60 press. No, it's not. No, it's not 60 press meal.

Speaker 1:          01:04:51       don't stop. Come

Speaker 3:          01:04:58       music is so specific. I guess they have like one guy. Yeah. One guy who does all the music. Yeah. I don't think that they know that for our show. We prefer them to do it without the music. Can you guys Redo this trailer? I'm glad to see that man's working again. I didn't know she stopped. Yeah, we just haven't seen her work lately, but I'm really excited about that. It is exciting. It is exciting. It is amaze. Yeah. This guy was like, what the fuck is that? Why do you say it like that? We don't say it that way. It's not our fault. It's [inaudible] fault. Yeah. And what we do it aren't we? Um, I have a dad boner. Oh yes. Crossing a bridge. That's all I know about this. I haven't seen him so excited. I love these so much. Right. Here we go. I'm going over the new bridge. Whoa. Waiting for this for over three years. Oh really? Oh, super excited. Not the sound so sweet. I know. It's drive over a bridge. Did this guys stoked about a bridge? Three years. That's a long time. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:06:07       Scheduling rubber. Why? Here we go. Here we go.

Speaker 3:          01:06:17       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:06:23       Darko. Oh my God. Wow.

Speaker 3:          01:06:30       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:06:31       Oh yeah. I was going to be doing a dream now. Oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:06:38       Seems like it might be mocking someone who does this. No, that sounded real legitimate. God, maybe he

Speaker 7:          01:06:44       did you do it again? I don't even think about what to do it again. Not Sweet. Awesome. Oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:06:58       Oh, I mean this is obviously the guys doesn't have a lot going on in his life. Is that the only factor? But that's a real dad word is sweet. That's like jam. I don't think I'll ever get this excited about, uh, driving over a bridge. Now they're seeing a fucking solstice or whatever. You know what I mean? These guys are out of their minds. You mean, uh, a solar eclipse, whatever it was. Yeah. I mean he must be a bridge and Susie asked much like the train enthusiast, that guy was really out of his mind. I go super stoked about that. Yeah. I posted a video. Right. I could like the train. Yeah, I know the foamer. Yeah. And Bunch of people were like, well where'd you find this? One guy was like, am I crazy? Is this guy actually sound like you? You know, cause I did it through my voice. A little bit of screen. Can't believe that people didn't know. Oh yeah, maybe this guy has been like involved in the building of the bridge or something. I don't know. Maybe maybe just been watching it for three years being constructed and, but I mean would you would be that excited to drive on it? You saw that being constructed. I Dunno. Wearing Canada, come on. I don't know where in Canada this guy lives. Maybe it's a real remote part

Speaker 4:          01:08:18       that's for a bridge driving on a bridge. That's a lot of rural parts of Canada, you know. Well obviously the, the Dad Boehner level of excite is off the charts there and dad boners being excited as something that we really have been excited about here. So we had blow blue band throw together blow band. That could be, it could be his born name below band threw together a super cut of dad. Boners excited. I'm excited about this. Here we go.

Speaker 7:          01:09:06       Yes. Oh God. Along here. Oh my God. No. Stuck at the prominences. That's a three. You gotta be kidding me. Let's blast myself. We came up here. We've been slipping along.

Speaker 4:          01:10:11       Huge battle. That was outstanding. Thank you. That was amazing. God, I was so good. I guess. You know, it does feel good to take here. Dad. Boners get that excited. It does, right? I mean it's nice. It lifts your spirits, lifted my spirit. You know what I think it is? It is childlike enthusiasm. And the thing that's rare about that is that you're seeing it in adult. Most adults don't ever have that low. And that's the nice part about the charm of our show is we celebrate all things childlike. The burping, we also market, but we also celebrate it. Yes, yes, we, we mocked the burping. Well, we mocked the, the excitement and one that we want to make them insecure and never do it again. But we also are taking a moment to say it's nice. We also want to strip them of their joy. I genuinely get a thrill from Dad Boehner, study by the pussy, a period stuff. Then you say something about that before the show. Yeah. So I was

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       telling you the other day about these period panties, you can buy that you don't have to wear a Tampon or a pad and you just put on these panties and they absorb all the blood, like you free ball on your period. How do you feel about that? Well, I think, I feel like it's a fucking nasty. It sounds NASA was shit, throw away your underwear, you know, it's when I'm away. So I guess the premise is these panties can absorb all the blood. Yeah. Like two tampons worth. And then you just wash the panties. But they're like, do you just throw the panties and you're washing and your washer is not, and that's what I'm asking. Nasty. Like, you know what else you could do? You could wear nothing. No.

Speaker 8:          01:11:54       Hi.

Speaker 3:          01:11:58       So why don't you explain what we're seeing? I don't want no, it's a lady doing

Speaker 8:          01:12:03       ah,

Speaker 3:          01:12:04       on her period. Nothing. No. She's wearing white wearing white white yoga pants. And her period is just floating out really good at Yoga. Really fit. Yeah. So she's just letting her, her blood. Yeah. Go everywhere on the white pants. Yeah. Well her whole thing is like, why should I feel bad about that? You shouldn't feel bad, but you should. It's just a hygiene. I think it's a, it's unhygienic to just, Oh,

Speaker 9:          01:12:37       oh

Speaker 3:          01:12:39       yeah, yeah. Mm hmm. I think it kind of ruined the mood in here for a moment. Yeah, definitely. Made me uncomfortable. Well, the thing is, it is, it is natural. Yeah. And it shouldn't be ashamed of it. It's a whatever. Yeah. But I do think you should, uh, try to be hygienic about it. That's just, probably doesn't feel very good either to just have your blood kind of, you just sitting in your blood, you know? Sure. That doesn't feel good. But that's my concern with these panties is like, do it anyways. I ordered a pair today, just so you know, I'm gonna give it a whirl and I will let you know. I'll report back to everybody on these panties. I just don't see how it can feel. Okay. To sit in your own blood. They swear it. They swear that you can, you can do it. She did it. She did it. She did it for like a feminist, you know? Right. To make a point. Yes. Yeah. There shouldn't be no shame. Right. Which I don't think there should be. No, it's just blood coming out of your blessing. Plus he's bleeding right now. Ducks. Um, Cheryl sage, excuse me, sage. I rock. I see the blood come in and say, right,

Speaker 9:          01:13:52       what? Oh sorry.

Speaker 3:          01:13:56       I would say that to you. Yeah, but you have seen everything come out of my pussy. That's true. But I would tell you if you were laying around and I saw that, I'd be like, do you know your pussies? I'd want somebody to tell me you don't want to bleed out on everybody's stuff. You know? Um, I remember I never forget this one. I gave birth to Ellis. My favorite moment is I was like, hey babe, what it looked like and you go, well the head, I saw the head and then Ellis came out and then like a bunch of shit came out after. That's true. But that's how he said it and then like a bunch of shit and I'm just like, what?

Speaker 3:          01:14:36       All kinds of fluid and stuff came in. It was fine. Right. You don't care. I know you don't care. I don't care either. I just think it's funny that you called it a bunch of shit. I don't know who else to call it. It looked like somebody just opened like a sewage line, just emptied out a hotel. I wish you would go to like a lamaze class and lecture to all the man. Shit's going to come out of her post, but don't be weirded out by it. But it's okay because the baby comes to and then baby yours and you can do what you want. He can marry your mom. You remember we, uh, maybe later when he turns 18, Waa, remember when we played the, this lady, she's on Lincolnton Lincoln dead. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:15:25       This is Sharice off Morgan. And I want to make a video to all these guys that set up a linkedin profile just to look at my linkedin because they have no followers or I dunno, they're just use linkedin to spy on people. Sometimes I will accept, um, request on linkedin because it seems like maybe a good business connection for my work, my writing, my books. And then every once in a while some guy at Luther guy will come along and think that he can ask me out. Linked in is not a dating APP. Your losers stuff per queue. Don't use linkedin to connect with him and then asked me to travel. Do you for date at this guy that said he was going to be in palm springs and may wanted to know if I wanted to come up there and meet him for some hikes and stuff. He was being nice, but a woman does not travel to a man on a date, so fuck you.

Speaker 3:          01:16:18       That's right. That's what's up. She's right about that. Maybe John, maybe. I wonder what made him think to ask you, what date is it be that maybe one of your videos is low? I have come all over my face. Maybe that's the one, but again, it's evidence that Linkedin is not helpful. Linkedin is not helpful unless you're, you know someone, someone else. Lincoln. Dan is not for everybody. Fuck Lincoln. Fugly tickling like that one. Why I don't like him. I don't like what he does that I like him, but I don't like when he does that. Gross. What is your problem with him and the Vegan Vagina guy? It just, it's too creeps. It seems like you're all worked up. I'm not the 34 rectifier, which in my opinion,

Speaker 11:         01:17:10       possibly the best rectifier over put into a early a guitar amplifier. And I'm going to explain why a first off the filament current through the heater filament is only 1.9 amps. That's for an ampere rex. I assume that's the way it is for all of them. Um, I

Speaker 3:          01:17:32       didn't that cleanse the palate of the thing you didn't like, don't you feel recently actually erased my memory. Yeah. I just got focused on how fucking bored I worry this was, yeah, that's neat. Yeah. Hmm. Well, people can't do that and I just did that for you. Can I tell you what I like about you? Yeah. This morning I learned how to make for Tatas. Yeah. And I this a second time I made you for Tata this morning and you get, you are so into it. You liked it so much that you lost your ability to hear. Yeah, I do that. Yeah. And a little jeans and I were talking and laughing and we're like, right dad. And you were just like, if I like it, yeah. To now like what I'm eating, I tune out. Yeah. If I'm reading, forget it. Oh, I know that one.

Speaker 3:          01:18:16       Yeah. I can't hear a thing. Yeah. If I read something, it's over. If I eat and it's good. It was a really good, you won't even hear that's true too. But what's going on? Focus level of focus. Right. I'm so focused on the thing that I'm doing are enjoying that. I don't hear anything else. Yeah. You like that time, like a million years ago at my house, you were frying bacon. I'm going to cut in and talk to you because you were too busy frying your bacon. That's why you use that expression. No frying Bacon and Bacon. But I didn't know it was. I didn't, yeah, I didn't know that it applied to eating. Yeah. Oh yeah. Definitely applies to eating. So, but this means that the last 12 years have shared meals. You've likely not been listening to me talk at all. No. Only as part of the time.

Speaker 3:          01:18:59       Right? Part of the time. Okay. Because how often is the food that good like that for Todd? It was so good. Yeah. That I always distracted, but you can hear me if the food's like okay. Right. Okay. The worst the food, the more I'm listening. Exactly. Yeah. Huh. We to go to like Shakey's for dinner then shaky knees. You know I'm this hairdresser that works with Allen. It was his 40th birthday when I was there and he had it at Shakey's the one in Hollywood because apparently they'll put your name up on the Shakey's billboard. Who looks over at me or him. Who are who? Alan Guy that turned 40 oh the guy that turned 40 it looks older. Yeah. Wow. Well I, I, I asked you that question. I asked you that in an a text the other day, cause you looked 40 when you were 30 so do people think that you look 50 now that you're almost 40 yes, I get into the forties for sure.

Speaker 3:          01:19:54       Yeah. It's really nice. How old do people think you are? I mean the most extreme that I've heard is like 45 bullshit. Yeah. Dude, you don't look 45 but I think people see the gray in the beard. I'm telling you that the, the beard being gray ages you about she shaved her Sheila closer look closer. No. Will you buy a box of Nice and easy not going to do it? No. Like my stepfather would do is just trim the Beardmore which I'm doing on Wednesday. It's too, it's too thick. Alan will fix now. I told you my step father used to buy the, the jet black nice and easy and then he would do his beard and the eyebrows and the hair and he was about 50 like jet black, Indian and he was an Indian guy. Sure. I look really good. How good does it look?

Speaker 3:          01:20:39       You can't go jet black, but I think you should try. Yeah. Will you try jet black? I will not try Jaguar. I wouldn't even make this totally. If I would just ask him to, you know, sprinkle in color. I wouldn't even do, not that I'm doing it. If I were doing it, I would do a modest version. I like it. I like your silver whiskers. I just love them. I like your silver bear look so verbatim. You know what else he did with the Frittata, which really made me realize what a savage you are, is that you like a bear. They've ever seen bears eating a honey hive and there's all the bees swarming around the hive a bear. Well, disregard the bees and keep chomping on the hive and let the bee sting his mouth. That's something I've done a long time. If it tastes good, it's hot. Keep eating because it tastes good.
