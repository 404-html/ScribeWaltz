Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Wow. Well, well go to your mom's house, Christina. Visits. Increase Increase

Speaker 2:          00:00:20       Frank Sinatra. Yeah, I'm not entertained. I don't think it's great. It's also not thinking why you say that? He's singing singing. I can sing like him.

Speaker 3:          00:00:39       Hey Bob.

Speaker 1:          00:00:44       Really man. It's like no, but what about Cassie? Kindness thing is that one. But most of it is a

Speaker 3:          00:00:54       come walking in those ladies at the fuck man, bring me a drink. I love slot. And you're like, that's not really singing

Speaker 4:          00:01:03       man, man. Man,

Speaker 5:          00:01:06       man, man, man, man, man, man, man.

Speaker 1:          00:01:16       There's ladies at the great man. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:01:21       that's a, what is that? That's [inaudible] Sinatra. Nice. It's really good. Yeah. By who is that? Hello? Hello something I can't see. Um, yeah, really good song. I like it. It's not just terrible. Terrible.

Speaker 6:          00:01:41       Yeah. And it's a very, it's just, it's too overexposed to like, I feel like you hear Sinatra and I'm very corporate environments to buy that Sig flow. Sorry, sig flow. You know like when you go to a bar stocks, it's like a corporate approved type of music. Yeah. I think cause it's just, it's been around for so long.

Speaker 4:          00:02:01       I also feel like it's fake nostalgia. Right, right. The guy that tried, he's like, I just, you know, I love that throwback feel. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:02:10       Right. But it's been so overused that it's not even authentic anymore cause they'll play Frank Sinatra, you know, at the Mcdonald's or whatever and you're like, well this isn't cool.

Speaker 4:          00:02:20       Yeah, I know.

Speaker 6:          00:02:21       You know. You know what I'm saying? I'm only talking about, yeah, talking about, you usually hear Sinatra and like Yuppie places like our crate and barrel or a Serola Tabula or Williams and Sonoma. Like when you're buying your hundred dollar pots and pans.

Speaker 4:          00:02:36       Yeah. People like to force that. Yeah. That feel, eh, but it's good that bay to the bar. I think maybe, actually I just realized that's my issue with it. I feel like the person act like they're into that whole thing. Right? Like when did you meet somebody authentically playing Sinatra at their house? But that's what relax too. You're like, oh, it's all about the authenticity as bullet points. Like a 70 year old guy. Yeah. My Dad. Yeah. My Dad does likes Frank Sinatra. It doesn't fit, but it's a, it feels, it feels like it's fake. I'm like love for it. I think you're right. I think you're, I think it's a manufacturer. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right. A fake nostalgia. And at that point it's not neat. It's not cool. It's not raw. Yeah, absolutely. Right. Yeah. The fuck is she doing Schnitzel looking for food? She just went behind it.

Speaker 4:          00:03:33       She got up on the couch. She hasn't, maybe she's lost a few pounds. She has, cause I had been cutting her kibble but she doing man she's looking for is for things to get into. I cut her kibble intake so she still eats the table scraps to fall, but it's actually, it's only been like a week of doing that and she's already dropped some lbs. It looks like. Oh for my uh, audio people, I get a lot of people that, you know, ask questions and make suggestions about, so I have an update on this computer show with tutors or he would open the show. I was wondering if we should watch the mic guy because this discussion you're about to get into sounds about as interesting. I don't know. I don't have him cute up, but I'm saying it sounds like a real boring. Are you going to get real technical on it?

Speaker 4:          00:04:15       Well, it's a little technical but I think we have a lot of people that have have written in about it. Okay. So, so we do the show with two two computers, right. This basically becomes the, the video computer, the one I'm sitting in front of and it's like a backup audio thing, but the majority of the audio stuff plays from the second computer. Right. So that one for the second time got butt fucked, stopped working. I took it in. They will have already replaced a logic board on it and I go, what? She just did a code on it. She reset the p Ram and then the p ramp that I prayed to bring it back here, plug it in. Not the same issue but not playing. So now I think it's actually the Jack that I plugged in there. So I'm going to get into cables plugging and unplugging the cable and plug cause you're messing with it.

Speaker 4:          00:05:05       I then somebody else. Yeah. You kind of, you kind of solved it. I think that there's also a, um, uh, there's a software that somebody told me to download to, to do, to streamline this more. So I'm going to try that too. But we still don't have it today because today I couldn't hook it up. It's still an issue with it. Kind of. It just fucking, it's so annoying. It is annoying. It sucks cause we do our show off of that and all our drops are on there so I had to transfer some. It's like, but, and then I have that, that version of the show opened. That doesn't sound the same for whatever reason. It doesn't sound the same on this computer. I don't understand that at all. It doesn't work. Sucks. Yeah. So weird. So we're just going to have to power through, glass it through glass through. Um, all right. Should we open the show? I properly [inaudible] on my leather mask or, yeah, it was the real math. Let's fucking do this shit, man. A virgin out from his chest,

Speaker 7:          00:05:58       from the covering with the tension of pulling on the tail. Those muscles are actually being squeezed out into pushing out the penis.

Speaker 6:          00:06:08       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:06:15       well welcome to your mom's house. And Christina

Speaker 6:          00:06:44       came here. I know

Speaker 4:          00:06:47       DOR did. And it's the, that's all funky sounding. I don't, I have no idea. Um, it's a real low fi version. I don't get it, man. Anyways. Um,

Speaker 6:          00:06:59       but scoop Bedo the de la God,

Speaker 8:          00:07:02       that's the way it goes sometimes abroad. Well Not Take Yo rob far bup, bup, bup. So you hang with the fellows and you have a drink. Oh six loaded up, bup, bup, bup, bup. I'm the most popular singer of the 20th century.

Speaker 6:          00:07:26       Right. And it also hearkens back to a time like, isn't that the 50s? Isn't that a time of like total sexism, racism when the white man while still does dominate, but like a time when Whitey really fucking let you know that he was in charge. I had a real special black with them. You know they had one, right? Yeah, they're allowed one. There you are. Cool. And he's right. He was black and he was Jew met both quotas and then they're like, the rest of us are white. We're not racist. Fucking Sam is here the whole time. Right? Yeah. Yeah, totally. And I, but ironically that time in Vegas is where those guys are performing. That's back when Vegas was about, it was Sodom and Gomorrah. Yeah. It was, you know, hookers and drugs and really changed. Oozing. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:08:13       It's good and so crazy. And like Nevada now has, uh, I think they're, I think they passed recreational marijuana. Not like that. You couldn't do find it before, but imagine to add that into the mix. Like right now, weed is legal. You can walk on the streets with open beverages. Uh, the Raiders are probably gonna be

Speaker 6:          00:08:32       I being serious. Yeah. That's chaos. You should not have the writers there course, but it's also on Nepal. It's perfect. It is no better town to have the Raiders. That is where they should be. Yeah. Just amazing. It's just going to be people shooting guns in the air, like, yeah, we totally nuts by the way.

Speaker 4:          00:08:51       Thanks everybody that came out. Um, Huntington, Long Island, Montclair, New Jersey, and Atlantic city, another shitty isn't it? Lacks Shitty, far Atlantic, shitty, really fun shows. Uh, my parents came to Atlantic shitty show.

Speaker 6:          00:09:06       I know, cause your dad called this morning and he never asks to speak to me directly, but you handed me the phone and I got really excited. He was really demanding it and I got super pumped because I was like, oh, we're gonna do some brown talk. I mean the dog and I, yeah. And what he does, and he does this every time, is he just talks about how proud he is of you and how much he loves you. He's like, you know, or Zena Brown, a Tommy, he's just such a great kid.

Speaker 9:          00:09:34       Great.

Speaker 6:          00:09:40       And he just talks about how proud he is of you, of how well you did at the show and your performance and your routine. And then notice lately,

Speaker 4:          00:09:48       nothing like start to cringe more than I would. He goes, hey, you know, I watched the crowd. Okay, I watched them. And, uh, you, uh, you, you know, you talk about things that they also can relate to now I'm like, yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:10:09       it's called the top. That's what we all do. I think. Yeah. There, because if you don't, people don't laugh. Right. You got to hit a common ground, but you, you have, uh, I don't know really just, it's really neat. No, try it. Can I tell you what he said to me? That was the best two gene. He goes, uh, uh, uh, uh, audience was really excited. See him like really excited and this girl next to me was just dying, just dying everything Tony, he was saying. And then I did really laughing and I was so tempted to tell her that to my son and at the end of the show I leaned over and I said, that's my son. Yeah. And uh, she really flipped out. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:10:50       I told him, he was telling me that. He was like, yeah, I said to a somebody that's my son, and then the guy goes, top dog. And I go, yeah. He goes, I couldn't help myself, Tony. And my mom was like, don't please. When she told me, she was like, I said, please don't please, please, please.

Speaker 6:          00:11:12       Now your mom, you said, um, it has been having a better, excuse me time at your shows lately because you've been,

Speaker 4:          00:11:19       uh, encouraging actually demanding that she drink before the show. Right. So that has been a huge, huge help. I tell my dad, give her too, because she really can't handle her alcohol. Yes. The best. Give her too. Um, and, and make sure that, you know, she's good and sauced it works so well. First of all, she gets lightheaded and loose. Yeah. She didn't even remember what the show about it the best when

Speaker 6:          00:11:49       she can't criticize or critique or not what she has. I'm not worried about

Speaker 4:          00:11:53       that. I just don't want her to like really internalize anything really. Yeah. I mean like she just, at this point she feels like, so because she'll, if she, if she's sober, she'd be like, that thing was kind of, you know, that wasn't very nice to say that. Yeah. At this point my dad was like, you know, that was true and that my mom goes, what? It's like that whole story he told about me. What story? I didn't even Amnesia. None of it. None of it. None. I love it. Lou went over. So I was like, this is the only way she's allowed to come to them.

Speaker 6:          00:12:25       Yeah. Well we instituted this policy when she came to visit last time. Yeah. Uh, she came in and we immediately gave her a drink and it ended up being the best time we ever had with your folks. Cause every time she'd come over I'd be like, Charlie, you want, you want your peanut Greens? You want your peanut agrees? No, no I cannot. And then I would just pour a, for her memory you would like, tell me like, just pour for end. Pour her a big one. Yeah. I shall never take a second for, yeah. So I was giving her like, you know, tall boys of Pinot grigio and it was fantastic for us. Like I remember they were down on the floor with Ellis laughing. It was great fighting for his affection. It was the best time. Alcohol is the,

Speaker 4:          00:13:01       Oh, this is, this is the other thing I wanted to tell you. The last time she went to the, the, uh, the live show. Yeah. She drank and she goes, you know what I have to tell you, did I, I love the show. Is that no more. You don't do the f anymore and you don't say you're masturbating. And my dad looked at me like, like, what are you talking about? He talked about that for like 15, right? What show are you at it? But then we realized it was the,

Speaker 6:          00:13:28       the sauce, the, the, yeah, the sauce. The sauce, you know, alcohol and drugs are great for some people's personality. Like my father is off the booze now. Yeah. And he's a miserable content. Right. And I don't like him over because he's not fun. And my dad's so much better than when he's drinking. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:13:48       So people are like that. I have friends too that are, I mean, obviously, you know, everyone knows this. Some people, it's fucking toxic to the point where you see that second drink, go down someone's hat and you're like, oh yeah, I had friends like that. Even at high school. Yeah. And I recognize like once this dude has three beers, he headbutts people. Right. Um, and then when, then there's people who just are funneled like Burt's a great example. Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:14:14       Exemplary drinker. Yeah. Bert Burnt Chrysler. Yeah. The unfortunate problem is that he's great when he's drunk. Yeah. Yeah. And I had been drunk just drinking. You don't even know that he's drunk now. You don't know. Like, he's so fun. He's a fun, fun guy. And my dad, the same thing, like a party drunk. Like he's actually kind of a fun dude. Yeah. I'm sure he's had a few in him. He used to crank up the ABA. Yeah. In the house and dance and like Andrix Oh Henrik, I was on the darker days. That's when he was running lights off. Yeah. I'd come home from like high school if, I don't know, like 15. I come home at night from like hanging out with my friends and uh, he'd be sitting in the listening to Hendrix listening to it so loud that I, I was like, oh my God, did somebody break in and turn off our stereo?

Speaker 6:          00:14:58       Like I would walk in and it'd be like blaring and he would also have the television on muted, which makes me crazy personally. Like if something's on an, I can't understand what's happening, I can't do it. And he would just mute the TV and then listen to Hendrix and just sit in the fucking dark, like, get weird. I was like, cool. This is normal. Right. Functional value. That's just how I used to get down. Yeah. That was his unwinding, right? Yeah. That was a weekend. That wasn't a weekday. That was like a Friday night kind of wind down. That's the end of the night. Definitely. That was like midnight. I'm rolling in and I remember he was into that Marley mix to, you know, I'm sorry.

Speaker 6:          00:15:39       Yeah. There was some, a song that he played. Yeah. That was like, oh, this is a, you know, he likes that stuff. Yeah. You know what really made me laugh that he used to do with my ex step mom is a, she fucking hated German Christmas music and my dad would play this one CD that we had and there was one song, Hi Jay, boom by g and she would fucking, she would never get mad, but when hide you boom. Baiji came on just to irritate it. Oh, of course. That was the whole fun is that my dad would look at me because he had had a few in him and he was like, you ready for the Christmas music? And I was like, yes, because I knew that she was going to get fucking hate it so much. She just, she would say that.

Speaker 9:          00:16:24       Yeah. Hi.

Speaker 6:          00:16:25       Did you move by g? I hate these songs still good. Again, like folks she hated for like you with red, red wine. I hate red, red wine. But you don't play it to agitate me like on Christmas. No, but I mean it's not a bad idea. I'm not going to not start doing that. That's terrible with the boy. That's terrible. Put whatever. I'll get mad. Yeah, that's the fun part is pissing Mama. What's your read song? I'm trying to think. You're a, it makes you see, fuck, I definitely have some. It's just I can't really access and what it is right now. You know you don't, but you don't get as angry on arbitrary shit. Like I do know you get angry at people like pro, like in competence makes you angry. I get mad at like irrational, like songs make me angry. Yeah. I'd say I'm healthy. What that's about. Yeah, I'd say I'd say the diagnosis probably. Yeah. Well definitely one of us had a dad that drank and the dark. Yeah, I'd say so. Psychologists definitely. You're definitely the mental health champ of the both of us. I work a lot harder to see.

Speaker 9:          00:17:38       I heard that one before. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:17:44       Yeah. My Dad. Yeah. Ah, oh, he's, they're so sweet. They're going

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       to come back and visit soon. I can't wait till I had my dad and my mom and I'm married. My mom asked him, will you ever date your mom married her? That's so true. That's so true. Yeah. You. Oh, you married her this weekend and I did Atlantic city. I did him and my mom the other day. What was the ceremony like? Oh, it was real nice. And Atlantic City, you know, we had it. We did it right there at the Borgata. Oh, that's cool. Very cool. Yeah, it was fun. It was actually really fun. You had a good time hanging with her? Uh, hung out. Uh, she's, she's the slot champs. Uh, she's in the slots, loose loose slots, but um, she's not really good at it so that's kind of real funny. That's hilarious. Then the best thing is she has, she's somebody who really sucks at it, cause a perennial loser but has all the advice for you.

Speaker 4:          00:18:36       So I always like the whole time I'm with her, she's like, this machine doesn't pay these machine base. So you go like, okay, you said to her machine and then you're bedding too much. I'm like [inaudible] like everything she says, I just, I keep telling her, I go, whatever your instincts tell you, do the opposite. You're the fucking cooler. Like you just kill a room. Well, I mean, is there such a thing as a strategy for slots? Well, I don't know if they're, I mean probably not, but there is there. I do know this just from somebody I know who has, I'm sure he's lost a lot of money, but I know there's a lot that want a lot of money as well. I mean, I believe you go, you get into your range and you Max bet. There's no point in men the bets on those things because all the, if you do hit something then what's the point is if you bet, but more so get like, get on a fucking penny machine Max.

Speaker 4:          00:19:30       So she's like, don't bet so much. Which was the Max bet on a penny? Well, I mean some of them it might be like a dollar a spin. And if you go to like the, you know, or you can do $3 or five or you can go to the high limit slots and that $50 a spin. But I just don't see the point. I'm like, you never win. And you're betting strategy never works. So try the one. I'm telling you. No, no. Yeah. Shin listened to you. Of course not. But I still had fun watching her. And then if it would, if she would have hit something and we'd go like, do you need nicotine meaning and it would, uh, it would go like, you know, pay out like $1 50 cents there. Look at you. You're fucking killing it. And do you get paid in pennies?

Speaker 4:          00:20:08       Does it come out in pennies? No, just it just adds up and you know, it doesn't pay. It doesn't, pennies don't drop. It just adds to your bank. So it'd be like, oh, it would hit and it'd be like 70 cents. Look at you. Oh Wow. I can see their logic. I mean, if you're not in it for the money, just the excitement of the win. Yeah, that is it. She gets a rush, but she's always complaining that she never gets like, it never wins any real money and like, cause you're not betting real money. Yeah. You can get a pony up. Yeah. She won't do it. She's like, no, it's too much. Maybe it's good that she's not into aggressive gambling. She fucking, she's so bad. So bad. But your mom's good at bridge. Yeah. Well there's no real like you are lucking out on a machine.

Speaker 4:          00:20:58       There's no strategies pressing a button. Yeah. But I just think that like whenever she thinks it's time, I go, whenever your body tells you, get up from this machine move and whenever your body says go to that machine, walk away. In other words, you stop trusting yourself. You're bad at this. It's like when my mother used to give me advice. Yeah. I'd be like, oh, okay, I'll just do the opposite of what you said because I know you're fucking crazy. Do the opposite of what you think is literally would. And then my life was super happy. She told me not to marry you. She was like, you should get back together with your lawyer ex boyfriend. I was like, oh, that means I got to marry Tom. Tom Is definitely in the winter and see worked out. Yeah. She didn't like you at all. She didn't, didn't know you though. She's crazy. Shared voices telling her that you were, um, you didn't like her really swear to God. Yeah, she heard voices. But sometimes you got to trust those voices. She did. Sometimes you do. Where's the, I'm trying to find the whale decks. No wheel. Dick's is right here. I was trying to find something else. Um, but okay, we can get in a wheelchair. I love this clip. I was just so taken with this. Oh, I remember now. Okay. What is it Jane? No, I remember, I remember what I was looking for. Um, this lady here,

And then there's like, there's a, there's a, what is that? A forklift? I mean a fucking thing is so massive that, you know, there's a, there's a team of people on the beach and she's the scientist. Obviously she's the one that, that knows about the specimen. And then, you know,

Speaker 7:          00:22:54       covering the tension of pulling on the tail. Those muscles are actually being squeezed out into pushing out the penis.

Speaker 4:          00:23:01       It's so big

Speaker 7:          00:23:02       city. Can you hold for a second so I can show the penis?

Speaker 4:          00:23:07       Oh till I tell you, cause we just looking at something, he doesn't say what Stop Day is massive. It's bananas

She's a real nerd. It's awesome. Great. Yeah, but that's a fucking nerd. Not Farell or whoever. Cruel wrapper. Right, right, right. The black guy with glasses isn't a fucking nerd. That's a nerd and a sweater. Well, I'm such a nerd. I know. I am a girl who plays video games like, oh, okay. I've read two books. I'm a nerd, right? No, this lady knows everything about whales. Everything. Her life is Wilcox. Yeah. I don't know about just the Cox. She just loves licking them. Holding them. Suck on them. No. Putting the warn her phrase, the semen on her friend. Hard drive round Pam.

Speaker 4:          00:24:27       Whoa, whoa. Give you an idea of the size of this cock. It's sitting on her lap. She's bent down. Yeah. And like she's holding basically, I don't know, not even, not even half of it with one hand and then flapping open handed the, the, uh, the end of it, flapping it around. It looks like a, it's like a fire hose, but I mean, like they've already in gorge. It's actually bigger than that. You know, it actually looks like a safety cone painted black. Um, or like a black person's leg.

Speaker 10:         00:25:00       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:25:01       There's like a leg.

Speaker 10:         00:25:03       No. Yeah. No.

Speaker 4:          00:25:07       I think the safety cone was a better, like, imagine a six follow a safety count, but a black one, right? Yeah. Yeah. Not a bad person is like,

Speaker 10:         00:25:17       okay.

Speaker 7:          00:25:18       It's actually probably the most amazing penis in the animal world.

Speaker 4:          00:25:23       I love her so much. Yeah. Now here's why. Probably, and she makes a really good point of why it's the most amazing penis. Yeah. It's because they can't stop the mount. Oh, right. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:25:33       Take us this penis is prehensile how when you're a whale you can't grab another well with your flippers and hug it and make love to it and you don't really have very good hits so you can't really do that motion. So you got to reach the female anyway you can. And this is what they use. A penis is completely flexible. Their kid penetrate from almost any position.

Speaker 4:          00:25:57       Wow. So crazy. It is an amazing, she's right. They can't hug. They can't thrust. Like how did dolphins fuck, we should try it. We should try this approach. What's that approach? Bed. Just like no mounting, no thrusting. And when do we do, I don't know. We just have to, it's just science.

Speaker 7:          00:26:20       So what else? Don't have a favorite position. You know, like there's no such thing as missionary position. All the whales and one of the few animals that do make belly to belly like primates, it's because of this ultra humongous penis that they could actually even have babies. I love

Speaker 4:          00:26:37       her so much, man. The thing is don't you love checks like this? Yeah, she's cool man. He's like so into it. She's like the only person that knows this much about this whale's penis. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         00:26:46       Super stoked about it out here. So that's really the land joy. I know you love the penis or we have to stop. We haven't got to get this whale off the beach. Or you finished it and know then. Yes. Okay. All right. This theme dot. You've got so hot and unbelievable.

Speaker 4:          00:27:06       Yeah, that's cute. Right? That's their little comedy. He had to go in and you know it's coming. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:27:18       Okay.

Speaker 11:         00:27:19       That is massive. It is massive.

Speaker 4:          00:27:22       What else? Basle this basil. I like the a worker's laughing. That's my favorite. They're like no change from fifth grade on. We don't change course. You shouldn't go that big Ole Dick. Yeah, it's true. Yeah. It's something you laughing now. A Dick, of course. Especially because she's super stoked about seeing a whale deck. If my dad was on that beach right, then hundred percent wouldn't be. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:27:49       I still love it. Seven or eight years old, pollute free lap dance. Love those jokes. Oh, I got a little projects

Speaker 4:          00:28:01       crazy. Um, oh, you mentioned. So I figured I would. Uh, you know,

Speaker 9:          00:28:07       I have come all over. My face might have come all of ours, all over Maine.

Speaker 4:          00:28:14       We played, uh, this lady last week. Same Guy will never even touch his own calm or tastes all come. I've seen this happen so many times with guys. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah. You posted, you posted I are on your, no, it was the Instagram teaser that I'm saying the weekly teaser. Here's the thing. I think we should go on strike against calm. Accum strike somebody a note. I noticed that you noticed it, right? Somebody who was like, Hey, is that and actually tagged this woman? Do you know her name? Oh, well I can find it. Hold on. So God, it's always weird when you play a video like this and then you talk a lot of shit. Yeah. And you're a total asshole. And I mean, and then it's like, oh, it's a real person. Yeah. I hate that. I fucking hate that. Uh, I've always feel horrible and I'm like, God, I know he's, we shouldn't have been such, but I didn't realize something. Uh, what is her name? Oh, here she is. Uh, she's on Instagram. Shahrzad Shahrzad should we give her lab? I don't want to. Yeah, it's okay. Okay. Uh, Shahrzad and Morgan. Yeah. And she's written a book, which is why we wanted to kind of, right. Yeah. I mean, look, she's um, here Shahrzad what kind of name is that? No. Shahrzad Morgan. Um, but it says,

Speaker 4:          00:29:38       oh, she said in that comment that she's an escort,

Speaker 6:          00:29:42       which explains everything. Yeah. Because we were like, wait, why is this woman had this problem in life that these guys are just coming all over her and asking her to taste it and well, that makes sense. If she's an escort then she's a professional come dealer. You know what I mean? I see it in there. It doesn't say I have no, I, here's what I have that she wrote a book called pleasure, a memoir and you can get it@mypleasurebook.com. So just to give her a shout out, cause since we shit on her so hard last week. Yeah. Uh, sorry. Shahrzad we didn't know you were an escort. If I knew that then it would, it changed the game and she has a new book coming out called what I did for sex and what it can do for you. Oh, that's cool. So now we totally, we thought she was like a new divorce, say maybe and yeah, she was, which might be true also as yeah. Who knows? But that totally changes the whole nature of the beast here.

Speaker 4:          00:30:34       Yeah. Um, and she did, she, she was nice enough that after we fucking absolutely shit all over this, um, where's, she said, well thanks for the compliment on my teeth. Yeah. She does have a really nice to you. I know. And we compliment and shoot and of all the things she said, she pointed that out. Nice Lady. Yeah, she's nice. She says here, mother has a bachelor of science in Computer Science, Mba and she does a TM high now. Just like me, just like Asian genes, just like Asian genes. Agent jeans. Oh our, yeah. Our agent does TM. Yeah. I'm the only one that's not on you. You're not onboard board the, the cold train. No, but I'm going to do it because you guys got me both thinking about it so much, girl. You got me thinking about it. Thinking about how much I love you. I love you.

Speaker 6:          00:31:27       Yeah, it's good. You should try it. Um, just check it out if you like it. If we're not, then you don't have to wipe. Come on your face.

Speaker 12:         00:31:34       I meditating right now in your mouth to come.

Speaker 6:          00:31:41       Remember I didn't the white tiger say that did she would like to draw in the essence? Yeah. She would put the cum on her face and meditate and how veal. I want to talk about the white tigress practice holding the penis. And she was hosed

Speaker 4:          00:31:58       by, uh, some fucking guy like the, the guy 20. Yeah. This activation God is activation. Some guy like that was like, you don't want to be a white tigers. And she was like, okay.

Speaker 6:          00:32:08       Okay. If she get a special title, like White Tiger. Yeah, you get a white tiger is tight. Oh, do I get an award? It's diploma. So here's the thing, I think we should go on strike against calm. Okay. Well, if she's an escort then yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:32:26       Yeah. Okay. Another thing, you should always wrap that thing up. Yeah, yeah. Yes. Right. Yeah. Gosh, that's a whole other, that's a whole other thing, man. Yeah, it's a lot. Yeah, totally. Totally. Now, when

Speaker 6:          00:32:40       you use escorts, do you use a condom? Uh, always. Always. You can't play that game, otherwise get burned by gonorrhea. Used to say that all the time. Don't we first started dating and I was like, do you have any diseases I should know about? And you're like, well, I got burned by Garrett gonorrhea one time. Twice. You got burnt twice. Yeah, I did. I got burned by gonorrhea twice. That's true. But that's bacterial, so that's fine. You can treat that. Yeah. But you still don't want it. What's it feel like? Um, I dunno. It just, it doesn't feel good. It feels better than it used. Good. Yeah. Does It hurt when you pee? Is that gonorrhea? Um, yeah. Yeah. It Hurts when you pee. It doesn't look good. It look like, um, it looks like you got an infection on your deferral. Yeah. What sluts gave you that?

Speaker 6:          00:33:37       Oh, just fucking dirty road beef, man. Geez, Tom. Yeah. I had a dream last night that you, uh, had sex was one of my close friends, one of your real close friends that, because then I wake up and I'm mad at you all day. Even though rationally I know I shouldn't be unconsciously. Every time I look at you, I feel just a like a shiver of hate. And then I go, oh wait. He didn't really do anything. But I do hate you a little, just a little bit today, by the way. It's real cool. And it's happened throughout the course of our relationship. We're, I would say today's definitely one of the better days. There's days where you carried anger throughout the day from your dreams. There couldn't be a more irrational reason to be upset and you've been like, it's fucked up. Oh, you've, you've cited your dream as the reason you're in a bad mood before.

Speaker 6:          00:34:30       Well, it's logical. I mean, dreams put you in a bad mood and then I just have to remind myself constantly that you didn't do the thing you did. Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah, I'll be liked it. I did sex in your mind, whatever. No one is hooking up with any of your friends. You always say that. Why would you say that it's true. No one's so going to let any of your friends. That's true. Why are you saying that? Because you're fucking your friends or dog. The bounty hunter and they're not dogs. They're not. You got to fucking say that all the time. It's like a rescue clinic.

Speaker 6:          00:35:13       That's so silly breed. Are you into Christina's got him as a friend for sure. You're so crazy. If I just, because I don't hang out with superficial Kardashians girl. Everybody wants, I don't hang out with girls that spend all their money on a liposuction. And how about just a good friend that looks kind of like you would that? That's a problem on my friends. Any Blondie's? Yeah, sure. I don't know. I'm not, you know what I like? That's so funny. I like grumpy brunettes. Throw all my friends and you know what I like, so stop fucking around. Oh, that's right. You're like Blondie's. Maybe there's a reason I'm not friends with any blinds because you'll start sexting. Yeah, maybe. Or those of your p s speaking of texts, I got a very interesting one. Holy Shit. It's not Salamay. So to recap, don't want to change her phone number at this point.

Speaker 6:          00:36:04       What year and a half ago. And you started at first getting job offers for a nurse. She's got a lot of nursing opportunities in Florida. Boca Raton, I get the calls weekly, we're hiring and Clearwater, and then she never gets to the calls. Then out of nowhere it was like, where are you Aiden? Where are you? Where are you people or let people love you still feel like that. And then it was like you weren't at your AAA today. And then we're like, oh. And then there was the calls when eight is checked himself out of the Rehab Clinic and I got calls from his shrinks and it was like eight us. You can't just check yourself out of treatment. I really need to speak with you. This is doctor Blah Blah Blah. So, and it was Solomon and then Salami, which is slowed down. It's been, it's been months since we've done a Persian voicemail and I'm just oh, sad spot on my nose or something.

Speaker 6:          00:37:02       Lady knows that called saw them as well. We don't know cause we just, when you lose hope with Salomon and she's like, I don't know that's somebody by the way, I think I put it together cause it's an older lady. Yeah. If somebody that has all her friends' phone numbers written down, interesting. Every phone number in her life is written down as a digit off and that's why interesting theory. I like that. I think it's just, she doesn't call, she opens her little booklet, her old school handwritten shit possibly supposed to be at three and it's an eight or something. You know, you remember that time she told Salami to put plastic bags in the trees for the squirrels that it wards off score. Somebody found photo of that. That's something that people do. You know crazy people do of course is a squirrel problem that severe and pervasive in California looking squirrels trying to get some food.

Speaker 6:          00:37:52       What do they do? What? What damage do squirrels do? I mean at least in city life, like, okay, they're kind of annoying, but I do have this, can I tell you what happened? Yeah, yeah, of course. So for Atus I get, I get a phone call yesterday from an area code. I'm not, I know I don't have friends in like, this is not for me. And I just let it go to voicemail because I'm with little jeans and we're riding a train. It's cute. And then I get a text from the number, it says hello. And I was like, do I like who is this? And I write back, who is this? And this person just sends a photograph of a $20 bill with just bricks of pills and writes back Rick with the xannies like, oh, he's looking for, he's not looking for Salamay or Schnoz. Atus yeah. So I was tempted to write back like, Bro, this is an eight is his phone. But then I started, my maternal instinct has kicked in where I'm like, I don't want this dealer to know that eight is, has changes number, because then he's just going to fucking try to find him. So I'm just going to not, I'm doing radio silence on the drug dealer. Yeah. Let him figure this out on his own. I'm not going to help aid as get pills. Of course. That's a ton of Xanax though, if you guys are.

Speaker 6:          00:39:12       Wow. I didn't know. That's how, I mean, I'm such a square, like I'm not even sure what Xanax looks like. Really. I'm like this guy's, you know, for a hundred of them in the metal, that is so amazed. I got to really cherish that one. Really Great. So that was pretty exciting news. We watched a good movie last night for once and I fell asleep. It was that good action movie. English people. Yeah, I really liked that one. Yeah. And there were a lot of chapters in it. The lead is a Chav, a Roadman, a lot of road when we're in it, rode men's blood, fat, blood, blah, that there was a couple blood and films in there. Really? I couldn't even understand what the henchman would be like. Blood, what? I was drinking wine last night, so I don't, I, I can't understand things. Oh yeah. Watch the rest of that soon.

Speaker 6:          00:40:08       We rented it. You know, right now we should have bought it. It's a good one. Told you we buy all the shitty movies. Then we rent the good ones. We own Jack reacher to reach all the way back. It wasn't available for Shitty rent. Fuck. That movie's terrible. Fuck that movie. I saw him that finished it. I think I'm going to finish it. I'm going to finish it. Jessica angry. Watch the rest of that pile of shit. I want to wish I watching. That movie really makes me wish I knew Tom Cruise just so I could be uh, um, call him and be like, how disappointed are you in the way this turned out? You would not do that if he was my friend. You would not do that to a friend. You don't do that to people do you know? But he's so I feel like he's the type that would be like, he would be like, yeah, the fucking director of fuck this one up.

Speaker 6:          00:41:02       Oh, I feel like he would leave with that. I think he's the kind of guy that he's really, cause he's in a, he's in Scientology and he's super positive. Like he's one of those people that say something negative. It's true. Well I think it was really positive experience because like he's one of those roads, a lot of people that worked on it and I'm so thankful to all of them. One of those fucking horse shit. Whenever people would credit the crew, that's when I'm like, uh, main thing is I'm just happy to have this crew back and I'm just happy that I was happy that these guys get to work. Do they start doing that? I'm sure that's what your main concerns. My eyes can't real far back enough into my head when I hear that that's what Garth was doing last week. Oh, you know what's really great is that everybody gets to see the grips and the light guy like, no, you don't.

Speaker 6:          00:41:52       One gives a shit and neither do you know. Yeah, you're the star. They always say ego. When shows get renewed. They're like, the main thing is that, that uh, this crew gets to work another season. That's what that was the main, I'm sure I was so worried about like what are they going to do, like I'm taking care of, but like these guys, that was my main concern. Right. Yeah. I'm sure you're going to make your wardrobe Mother Teresa. I did find this from when I did get gonorrhea, the first thing I kind of Rhea. Yup.

Speaker 13:         00:42:24       Right.

Speaker 6:          00:42:27       Yeah. That was me taking a piss with gunner. You never had an STD at all? Not once. I mean, who knows. We'll see what happens this year in college or anything like that. Never. Never, never, never. I never have because I never had sex with strangers. People that I had a relationships with, relationships with them. I had one eye. What happened was I got bad bite and I got sick. He got diarrhea. He always knew your partner? Yeah. Yeah. I was friends with the people I fucked. I never fucks rangers generally as a rule. It's still my, um, my, I guess my numbers are pretty split on that, so I'm sweating jurors like some half strangers, half. I know you can. Yeah. So gross. Oh yeah. I know one of your special strangers you do you reminisce about her like once a year? No, I don't. Oh yeah. Reminisce about a stranger. I won't, I won't say it on the air, but I'll, I'll say this. It wasn't a foreign country. Oh,

Speaker 13:         00:43:38       oh. See, look at your face like I've talked about it. I talked about it in my ass.

Speaker 6:          00:43:44       Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 13:         00:43:46       yeah. That's what I'm fucking talking about. You're still reminiscing.

Speaker 6:          00:43:51       It's not positive. Yeah, but you're still like ruminating about this wonderful woman. You man making a greater point. When I talk about her, I'm making a bigger point to do it. No, I'm going to have to watch the, your new hour now to see what's going on. I haven't watched you do standup in a while cause he'd been out of the, you know, we've been different cities, but yeah. Wow. Look at that. See I was right. She's always on your mind. This girl not always so special to you and your hearts for real though, Girl. Damn girl. Yeah, you're in my heart. What, what about her? It's not her. You bring out like what makes you, it's not her reminiscent. Finally. It's not that it's a Ma. I'm making a point about women. Yeah. Um, giving guys the go ahead and how, how women have to basically be more vigilant than men.

Speaker 6:          00:44:47       Because if you're a guy, there's just a point where you don't rationally think where the peg you got gonorrhea from. I never got gone to Rehab. Just, no, that's just, just the point that I made though at the point that I make is just about that. It's not about it. And you're absolutely right because I remember as a young woman, that dude's just, all they want to do is come in you. And she wasn't the only one who was like, yeah, don't worry about it. Hell no, no, no, no, no. She wasn't the only one. Right. So dangerous. Other floozies that I was with that were like, don't worry about it. Yeah. Yeah. We used to call your sisters Luddy and scanty. Yeah. There's still saved in my phone like that. They got so mad. Maria was just like, whatever. Jane was like, that's disgusting.

Speaker 6:          00:45:34       She, she thought this whole time he brought this up last week, she thought this whole time I had her saved in my phone as cunt. She goes, she was just like so fucking rude. They used to call me conti and I go, oh my God, you can teach me know. Yes, you'd like. She was so adamant. I go, the nickname was [inaudible] like a skunk. Yeah. And she was like, Oh really? I go, yeah, you thought it was con? She goes, yes. No, it was scanty and Ludie. Well, that makes sense now. And when she was so upset about that, she was like, this is so fucking rude. Gosh, I know you're a scant, but now this scares me for our son because all these hoes will be like, you can just blow loads in me and then, oh, I'm preggers now your life is over and you're at an 18 year old boy or 16 year old boy.

Speaker 6:          00:46:23       Well, okay. How do you convince a young man to wear a rubber? It's tough. I don't know, man. We've got to use scare tactics. I think that's what I was just thinking. Now, what can we say to him that'll scare him enough? Erash it's gotta be like right now I'll take them down to skid row and you're like, all these people didn't work out. And he's like, what? He started doing it like six years old. It was really impressionable. And every year you're like, I'm going to go to no condom row. Oh, that end drugs. You want it, you would take pot. This is what it looks like when you take pie and be homeless or pregnant with you. Pregnant people are like, they took about it took pot and they smoked drugs and then the baby's growing inside of you when you do that.

Speaker 6:          00:47:09       Yeah. That was the guys to scare him. We'll say it makes your teeth fall out to those tee ball and be like, yeah, if you don't wear a condom, teeth fall out to fall out. Yup. Did you drugs? She's full out. It does. Right enough. We got to get on that soon, showing him pictures and I will still be that thing. So we feel really don't tell him that. Stoops. Yeah. What's wrong? What? You good man. Don't please. Um, by the way, I think of anything. This is one of my favorite things that come in and a while. You remember obviously, right? Of course you can't. I remember I was duct tape. Yup. Guy Died. I'm so fired up. So fire. We have Korean food after this. You're always in the Korean food cause I have to shit, check this out. Yeah. This is crazy, man.

Speaker 14:         00:48:00       I mean he probably had ever, ever opportunity to put a brown paper poke over. Isn't hey ed can poke holes in it or a plastic bag, you know, but duct tape. I mean it's, it's just unbelievable. People don't think this really happened.

Speaker 6:          00:48:20       This guy. Oh God robbed the place with his face. It's wrapped in duct tape and duct tape. Hmm. Isn't that insane to you? Something tells me drug us. We're responsible for that decision. Yeah, a little bit. Of course. Duct tape, man. Chuck tape. It's bad. Yeah.

Speaker 15:         00:48:41       Bad. And it gets even more unbelievable during a jailhouse interview. The suspect said police have the wrong guy.

Speaker 6:          00:48:48       Yeah. Here he is.

Speaker 14:         00:48:49       They call you the tape bandage. That's not, you look at me. Don't look like a duck tape Ben and baby. I'm not. No. Duct tape banding loud one on one acid. It's sucky. You know this is not me. Now Look Dude Mad. Do the homework, man.

Speaker 6:          00:49:07       He's got to go ask the day pass duct tape tape. I mean this is an insane

Speaker 15:         00:49:16       police. Say the suspect. It's totally him. What? Lucky. Apparently the bandit was sweating so much. The duct tape didn't quite stick, but of course he's not all that lucky. Police say they have enough evidence to make the charges stick butter. Yeah.

They're all grumpy brunettes. We're just having to be, the best question I get asked all the time is what makes monads pizzas so different and it's not really that easy of a question to answer without going into a little bit of detail, please don't go behind the scenes and take a look at what we do with our cheese. What we do with our Dell, what we do with our tomatoes can make this pizza union. Our cheese is an piece of the

Speaker 17:         00:56:23       puzzle. It's the middle child bridging the gap between the crust and the toxic glue that holds it all together. It's, it's delicious. It is a beautiful thing to watch a master cheesemaker preside over at new master ways. Just watching every step in a way to make sure it's perfect and they have made us great. When we talk about Mozzarella cheese. Oh God. We're talking about a product that it needs to be creamy.

Speaker 4:          00:56:54       Duh. Yeah. Yeah. What's the fucking say? Well, it's like, I don't know. Good. His cheese is really fucking, I do. I do want to try it now. Right? Don't you think this guy is probably, it's probably a pretty good, right? What? Do we know the, is this la? No, no.

Speaker 18:         00:57:10       It's creamy. Buttery. Oh, you get a little teary, Rudy. Well, no, no. Naughty. Oh, stop it. Stop it. Really, really good. You're annoying. Really

Speaker 6:          00:57:26       stop it. Yeah, it's Monatiz. That's gross. That's really gross. It was super boring and it's boring. And he's a boner is an exciting topic that he made. Boring. How's that possible? You can make pizza and we look forward. My favorite one of these, um, was the one we did at the live show where she's like dry ponds. Now you may have heard of dry ponds, right? But the dry ponds in this dry pond is a dry pond. Yeah. Oh my God. [inaudible] pond is where there used to be water. It's also, it was like really obvious, but you know, when there's water, but then there isn't, now it's a dry pond. Yeah, no, I got it. Yeah, it was so boring. And dry pounds can be either dry or ponds, but they're not both dry ponds. They're like, yeah, what are you talking about? So when the water goes away, now it's a dry pond. You're like, Yep, that's how you do it. Teaching us about drive. How can we talk about sink holes for a minute? Yeah. I don't understand what's happening with the sinkhole. Why don't you understand? Well, we had a huge storms and la this last weekend. And then in studio city they said there was a sinkhole and that just means that what the earth just collapses and sucks in everything around it.

Speaker 4:          00:58:34       Particular area. I mean, the answer is simply yes. Uh, there was a sinkhole that it opened on the street level and below it was, you know, the, uh, what's it called? Like the, the water, what is it that runs through underneath the tunnel? The, uh, you know, I forget what it's called anyways. Yeah. It was like sewage lines basically like an open flooded. So the water, uh, it was raining so much, right. That, um, I guess that area was just susceptible to it swallowed two cars. Did you see that? That's what I'm saying. So, okay. So basically it gets, sometimes there's sinkholes in that area. It was above like a functioning, um, you know,

Speaker 6:          00:59:18       sewage system line. Okay. So then that breaks down and they think it sucks in, okay. There are sinkholes that happened just, you know, terrain opens up. That's what the fuck I'm talking about. Yeah. Like when we used to live by the beach, I would walk to the ocean. It was one, one time on the beach. Yeah. Dude. Like just out of nowhere, the sand collapses. And you're like, how does that even, how, why? And how does that even happen?

Speaker 3:          00:59:42       This shit is, is uh,

Speaker 6:          00:59:44       no crazy. Crazier than a motherfucker, man. Ooh, this is ray. We need, um, we need a boring video to explain sinkholes to us. Look one up. Let's see how you is one. Oh, what's your tongue of bad? Crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:00:04       Let's see. Let's go. Um, this same as this one seems to vary.

Speaker 6:          01:00:12       Our scientists have discovered evidence in rock layers to date or history on a geological timescale at about 4.6 billion years old. These scientists borings have internal and external energies already tapped out the various land structures of these energies or for shorter version constructive from this map of the United States, sinkholes occur in different regions all across the USA and beyond. Worldwide, Huh?

Speaker 19:         01:00:44       Okay. Did you see that one called how scary sinkholes are freaking thank you. And better at any time. Yeah. I don't understanding our intro. This guy's gonna drag it down. Yeah, we're going to learn words. I can understand here for d news, people and sink holes are now in my list of things I fear most. Right under trapped by a wildfire and above giant spider attacks. Prison sinkholes. This reason a man was asleep in bed in his Florida home. It's totally the earth gave way under his house. It was a sinkhole. He screamed for his brother who rushed in to save him. But even with those few seconds, it was too long. Kind of help. I know the best way to get over it. A fear of something is to get to know it. So here goes. All right. Sinkholes happen when the bedrock of the earth is slowly worn away by erosion. It's particularly common in places that are built mostly on limestone because it's so susceptible to that erosion under the topsoil is a layer called the overburden. Then under that is bedrock, which sounds tough and solid, but it's actually filled with cracks and crevices. Water's constantly, legally the water, the water, water eats away at the rock.

Speaker 19:         01:01:56       The fucking water gums in, Huh?

Speaker 6:          01:02:00       Snotty. Even you saying like it wasn't so much water, they wouldn't, yeah. Laughs we got to deport the water. It's raining too much, man. We gotta get rid of all the water rounded up. Oddly enough, everyone's always complaining about a drought here. Yeah.

Speaker 19:         01:02:20       What the surface is a thin crust of soil until the person walks over at course, cause it all collapses. Sinkholes. In 2010 Guatemala City was hit by Hurricane Agatha, and after being slammed with 45 mile an hour winds, the rain finally proved too much and caused this gaping hole. Oh, an entire factory. The thing is, you feed across and like a hundred feet deep. It looks Photoshop. It most definitely. Whoa, dude. Scary. Luckily no one was injured. Guatemala City is built on ancient volcanic ash and pumice just Kinda like gravel. And when it erodes, this happens. That's not, and it could happen anytime. Anytime a hard rain comes or whatever. There's nothing they can do. Singles, sinkholes aren't always caused by rain or nature. Sometimes humans screw things up. We're pretty good at that. Broken sewer pipes flooded. Mozzies are underground records been known to come?

Speaker 4:          01:03:12       Is it? You know what's crazy too is like, there's always this illusion that everything's fine. Don't worry about, we're in constant chaos any moment. You know, it's, it's, it's a weird way about how the earth, the world, even in modern times, is susceptible to its origins. In other words, the natural state. I don't have many buildings with Nia. You know, big biotron signs, you go like, well now it's modern, but like the earth can still open up and swallow you. Right Bro. I was fucking divas. Fuck. And you're right. Yeah. Cause we can build technology. We can say that we have control. We have no control over her mother nature. She can fucking zero do a tornado. A Tornado. Fucking earthquake. Dude, forget it. Good luck with your fancy freeways and your buildings. When that shit happens, earth opens up. That's what's up. Go Walk.

Speaker 19:         01:04:05       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:04:08       yeah, no shit. I remember it in the big earthquake in 1994 when that happened here in la, freeways just collapsed on top of freeways. And guess what? If you're fucking under it, like you're just dead, you're dead. You know the one thing about that is, it's much scarier is that their sudden I lived through a bunch of hurricanes. I hate that Florida. That's terrifying piece. You have warnings. You know the warnings. That changes a lot because they're like a hurricane is coming and then you're just fucking dumb if you're around for it. But why do people stay? Because there are people that I've learned over time. It's a, it's a mixture of dumb people, poor people. Because poor people really think about like, I don't have the means to travel or stay somewhere. I never thought about that for a long time, but it is true. But then there are dummies like there are one zero like I don't give a fuck. You know what? I didn't get killed last time. I sure shit like that. And then they stick around and die like don't Dan race. Yeah. They risk it and then they just get screwed. I wish we could, I mean they've tried forever. They've been trying forever to develop an earthquake system. Like they could give us warning at least like a few minutes because that would help tremendously.

Speaker 6:          01:05:19       But you're, you're just fucking screwed dude. It's fucking, yeah, it's a nightmare. That's why I don't like doing much. I feel like the less I do the safe right, I am better you can do is like, just stay home all the time. All the time. Our House is super safe. We're safe in here. I feel like. Think so. Unless there's a sinkhole beneath us. So I think about that every night. Put that in your dreams. Put me with one of your friends having sex in a sinkhole and your dreams real scared. The good news is you have life insurance. Please make some better looking friends paid. They're all good looking. They're just brunettes. Blondes. You got a bunch of fucking what about not true of everyone about that? And I'm like, all your friends are here by your dog pound and your fucking dog friends. Maybe your friends are Bowser's. I got g Q squad is, oh, bullshit. The bt Gq. The Big Tom is quarters there elects the Hobo squad. That's your fucking squad. That's what you're into. You liked. You liked that Hobo.
