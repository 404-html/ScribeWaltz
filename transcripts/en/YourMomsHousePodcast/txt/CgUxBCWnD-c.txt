Speaker 4:          00:03:58       Y'All got that Nigga. Fuck them John or whatever the fuck his name is. Cause most of the Niggas I'm here talking about him. Hey one of these niggas asked him that made a status like y'all so perfect. Oh God ain't no raw. We get a Nigga getting his ass, a motherfucking females and I ain't saying that cause I eat Niggas as I'm saying it because it is what it is. Don't bring in

Speaker 2:          00:04:26       well go to your mom's house.

Speaker 1:          00:04:33       I liked this girl. It's a very divisive issue in our nation. Where, I mean this has come up quite a bit here. Do you think Donald Trump gets his ass eaten? I don't think so. I don't think reg, I don't think the line you guys like, yeah, let me eat your yourself now with millennia. She's the bottom bitch. It's happened before. I think he demands and I feel like he would be like get in there though. I think he's probably like that's a minus sissy stuff or so. Oh cause he's of that generation that's like but by mail, by holy names, nothing needs to happen there. Do you think that guys, your dad's age, a lady butts or even that's considerably not, yeah, they're probably like no, that's gross. You don't need to do it is yeah, I'm going to side with them on that.

Speaker 4:          00:05:17       Nothing Nigga you fingers and Annee de questionable my Nigga buck drill need to do as did you suck his dick? You licking his bowl. You might as well eat that ass.

Speaker 1:          00:05:29       That's true. That is kind of point a hundred percent sure God blessing. There's a lot of that.

Speaker 4:          00:05:35       Yeah. And I'll just eat niggas acid so don't be like punch a bitch. No, cause I asked him where I'd be like she can't, what's up? Can I eat your last cause I like him all on his case or whatever. Like he ain't the only Nigga I like in his motherfucking ass. Aight.

Speaker 1:          00:05:51       I thought she said she didn't eat ass before. I know she does. Oh I hear you. I feel like she was making, she was clowning on people

Speaker 5:          00:05:58       that are, you know, saying like no and making fun of it. Gotcha. I think it's in reference to obviously like some story of some celebrity or someone, I don't know what it's in reference to, but you know, making a good point, very divisive issue in our nation today in our nation. Is it considered homosexual? Of course not getting hit. Why would that be homeless? No, it's okay. Well she's telling you that there's lines to the scrum. So legging. The scram is not, well, she's like, if you like extra things, inserting a finger in your, in your be hole, punch a beach. No, but she's saying that if he likes something inserted in his be halls or your questionable, then you're on the, you're kind of gay adjacent. Yeah. Which I also think is funny thing. I don't think if you'd like something inserted or you're gay excited if it's a dick than you are.

Speaker 5:          00:06:55       If you're like, I like Dick's coming up in my ass, then you're probably gay. True. Fake. What about, okay, well let's follow this logic train. Okay. What about a Dildo or a woman wearing a strap on? Is that gay? I mean, that feels more gay adjacent. I, I've, you know, it's never occurred to me that that would be a reality that, uh, would partake and be like, well you strap a dick on it. But I mean, but I got the guy isn't, I guess a hundred percent necessarily gay, but he's definitely, once he wants, he wants the virtual reality ride for sure. You know, cause it, but then again, it's not attached to a dude. Right. That's a key ingredient. But then again it is a dick. It's kind of like the traffic in a woman. Yeah. Yeah. But see like, you know, there's always been that argument about a man that's with a transsexual woman, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:07:49       I mean he doesn't like a straight up other men. He likes a man with tits. Yeah. And but like the presentation of a woman, it's complicated. Confusing. It's not, it's not straight up black and white because some guys are really into that, you know, the, they want the aesthetic of a female. So female looking face, female looking, you know, body, except genitals that are not, so that's, that's pretty complicated. So that this is not that far. This is, this is like what I mean, I don't even think that that should be part of this conversation. Right. Like somebody, not somebody being like, I like my ass eat and they're like, you gay. No, no, no. That's crazy. That's silly. I mean this is really God Burt special. Are you playing the most racist? Yeah. I don't think that's going either. And I, and again a very polarizing, what's what sort of course not. Oh yeah. Yeah it's, you know it's, it's the thing, it's, it's a, I don't think it's gay. I think having, like you said, I wouldn't even say like a strap ons gay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       I would think that as long as it's, if it's attached to a dude then you're gay. Right? Right. Yeah. It's clear cut. But then what is a dude in these non Barrett Binary Times? Interesting point. I mean are we being, what's the word? Binaries? Just probably if we write, we're old, we're binary shaming older. I mean let's see what else you said.

Speaker 4:          00:09:22       Oh lot of y'all niggas like in y'all ass. Hey I didn't ate a few y'all niggas acid so I know for sure you feel me and, and I never just eat it Nigga ass niggas be asking me or whatever like or I asked him so in a Nigga say he is, oh I ain't never just sneaky. He's and the guests like sucking his dick and then hurry up and lick his ass. Hell Nah Nigga cause your body to go wash that thing.

Speaker 1:          00:09:42       Oh she doesn't just do it in prompt to know saying you gotta be clean. So she'll give him a heads up like hey I'm Gunna, I'm Gunna let get and then you take a shower. What about a wet wipe? Do you think that's enough or pinch? But I mean it's better. It's really better to really get in there and scrub I think. Yeah. I mean yeah that's pretty dirty area. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:10:05       Y'all stay here really like really? Oh his heels though. Like y'all on that met life shitting on him cause he like he he got his ass eight or whatever like rather he liked that shit or not. He came lie that she feel good cause I ain't got my ass ate a lot of times and that shit feel good.

Speaker 1:          00:10:24       Crazy talk this person right. That's why you got a bum bump on your lip. You know it actually brings a no, I'm never going to eat your scrump. Just so you know. Interesting. Interesting. Somebody actually wrote in this message, maybe you can read it. Nope, just read it. It says all on Mommy's a huge fan of the podcast and love listening to it. I have a big problem. My husband and I have been together for almost seven years and I've never seen his butthole. You're lucky I feel because he has seen all of me, but hauling all that I deserve to see his, I've asked him repeatedly to show me his brown eye and even went as far as to set up mirrors in places to catch a glimpse. I fear I might die before ever seeing it. So my question is, Christina, have you seen Tom's butthole and what do you recommend I do to see my husband's by hall?

Speaker 1:          00:11:16       Thanks for taking time to read. Love you guys. Keep high and tight. The butthole investigator, Natalie. Uh, I just saw your butt hole. I saw Tom that whole like yesterday. You did? Yeah, dude, we were um, we were just playing and you bend over and spread. Remember, how are we doing? And you kind of, it's like in the last 72 hours I've seen your ass hole. It's not pretty. It's very hairy and dark and scary. It's kind of like, um, the upside down a stranger things. Yeah. Like Wah, it's all dark and mysterious and, and um, toxic, toxic. You feel sad when you see it. Jesus. Yeah. Stuff like that. That's not true. Uh, how do I, you know, here's what you can do to get your boyfriend to show you or as a husband, I can't remember, uh, play a little game called stripper. Yeah. You know that's true. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:12:13       Remove. Oh yeah, we're, I, yeah, I slapped my hands on my butt and then I run them down the back of my legs and I bend down like I'm doing a hot stripper dance.

Speaker 1:          00:12:21       So you may want to encourage him. You start, you go, hey, you want to see my stripper dance? And then you do it and you spread your cheeks and then go, now you do it and then make him do what you just did. Yeah. It's pretty good idea. But you don't want to see it. A man in that position is hideous. Cause his twig and berries or mashed,

Speaker 3:          00:12:41       it's not, I mean, it's not going to turn her on. No. But she'll get to see what she wants to see. I think she might regret seeing it. Yeah. Why do you want to see it? But again, what would it take for you to eat? Like that girl saying, you know, right.

Speaker 1:          00:12:52       No, it's never going to happen. It's just not for me in this lifetime. I mean, what if it's something I need though. You don't. We've been together a million years. You know, I don't need it. No, you don't need it. You've got, you've gone this far.

Speaker 3:          00:13:05       I know, but I mean, I need it. I need that scrum meeting.

Speaker 1:          00:13:13       I need it. I mean nasty as hell, Tom.

Speaker 3:          00:13:17       Um, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:19       No it's not. It's not on the table right now. I know. I'm just lucky to get my hygiene back. You know, I have my six week checkup after having my badge blasted through childbirth and we got the green light. I know. And let's just start there. You know, you're talking to like varsity level stuff, man. We need to get back into just regular old entrance

Speaker 3:          00:13:42       courses and know, so tired as you are too. I'm, I made so much fitness last month, people don't know this on the show, but I go to this gym where we were a telemetry strap. Okay. And, um, and that what happens is it assigns points based on your heart rate, you know, in a workout. So if you have it spike a lot, um, you're getting higher points. And I was working at a bunch at the beginning of the month and they're like, oh, you're number one. I was like, oh, that's great. And then the guy at the gym that my trainer would text me, Oh, you're number three. I was like, fuck. I started to get mad about it, you know? Yeah. So then it just kept going and going and then at the end there I kind of went crazy. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:14:28       Yeah. Yeah. It's a mental problem. I mean, look, I'm concerned with feeding our newborn. I don't sleep either in the night I wake up every few hours. The dog had diarrhea last night. I was up and now dealing with that. But you know, you got your problems too. Like if you can beat this stranger. Yeah. With points, with points for your workouts. So it sounds like you're mocking. No, no, no. I think it's, you know, you're tired and you gotta work out a lot to beat this lady and that doesn't know that I'm competing with her, which is even cooler. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's pretty interesting.

Speaker 3:          00:15:03       So that last day I did three workouts. That's fun. I still feel it. I feel it today. Three days later. Yeah. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:15:13       yeah. You going to do this again in September? No. 10 I'm just going to do normal. No, I mean, I'm, I'm going to do it again, but now that I did it, I made number one. I'm like, cool. Just be, uh, be active. I don't have to be number one. Well, if you were to compete with her, again, I suggest the scrabble method. If you've ever played scrabble with a friend. Yeah. The key is to get a ton of points at the top of the game. Like when you play the electronic version and you get that assistant thing to help you. Yeah. Just get away. You gotta stack the points at the top of the game.

Speaker 3:          00:15:42       Yeah. No, it helps in play. Catch up. Yeah. Can I let that bitch what, what does she do that so fishy goes. So what happens is she works out at the gym. Yeah. Set my gym is a small gym that has like a one on one and you can do small group trainings. You can go with like three friends and be like train us together or you could do one on one. It's small and it's just personal training. Sometimes you could do like weightlifting core stuff. Um, boxing. There's like some martial arts trainers there so you can do kickboxing and that's it. This lady goes there, does her workouts with one of the trainers. In addition to that, she also goes to spin class a lot. Oh, what a spin class gets you, your heart rate really jacked up. So that's how she kills it with points. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:29       Yeah. What's interesting about this, and I've never done soul cycle, but people love it and I, and I'm like, and they pay a fortune. I hear it's very expensive. Yeah. It's like, um, it's a stationary bicycle, but with a lot of people. Right. And you just listened to like cool music. Is that gas? I've never, I've never got it. I hear it's fantastic. Yeah. I mean the whole thing is in or that environment supposed to help you write, write, write, write, write the music. It's a real positive coach. Gotcha. There's also people all around, you're doing the same thing and I think you like stand up on the bicycle and then you sit down, you know, like make it really crazy. Damn. That's hard as fuck. It's pretty hard. Hardcore how much you lose weight faster. And that, um, you know, we were discussing a lot a forest and Jenny. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:17:13       Whether she's a gutter slot and you know, abuse this man of somewhat, uh, restricted intellectual ability.

Speaker 1:          00:17:23       Right. Well, let, the debate was, is it ethical or should you date the mentally challenged? Right. Which clearly forest is not, not mentally challenge, right? I mean, yeah, we don't know what his level pretty functioning and he's high functioning, but he's not a regular guy. Right. And he's not

Speaker 3:          00:17:44       just a normal dude is like, hey, what's up mom? And Blah Blah. I live, I like chocolate. He could do standup comedy though. Yeah, he could probably pull off. There's a few comments. He sounds just, yeah. Um, so anyway, this is, um, the messages that came in. Hey, mommy's in Forrest Gump. Jenny was a calm dog with a heart of gold who tried to help forest out. The only way she knew how early in the film when she snuck into her, she snuck him into her dorm dorm room. So we get a handful of hungry tits. Right. Until he blew his snot and his dungarees she didn't have to do that. Her Final Act of bravery was to break him off some posts while she's still still had a post to give. No one else was, there was no tender for tards today. Forget about the south in the 60s.

Speaker 3:          00:18:35       Also, him being a single father ups his chances of pounding some pissed flaps by a thousand percent Jenny truly selfless, rob. Huh. That's an interesting twist on this ever growing a debate. Another important debate in America today is whether or not Jenny abused forests right to jiff him helped him. I mean, I can see, I feel like this is a spin on reality from rob, but um, that's an interesting point. Over the last, maybe Jenny was truly giving and just this is the only way she knew how to give. She contracted HIV because they had a biker gang bangs. Right. She was doing gang bangs on her nationwide dick to her before she ran into us before or after she became the first lady of the United States of America. Well before. Yeah. No. Yeah. This is before her it. Yeah, that's right. I cannot wait to see. By the way, guess what we fucked up last night when we were like, oh, what are we going to watch Ozark Susan tease out with her? Fuck. Fuck. God dammit. I love that fucking

Speaker 1:          00:19:37       well, I know we're in a kind of a show Lala right now. We got our Ozark back. We've been watching the Shahs of sunset on Bravo. Silly. It's kind of mindless fun. Oh my God. I didn't have chance to set this up. Better Call Saul. I was watching the, I wonder if I could bring it up. I was watching better call Saul is even better this season. It's fantastic. I fucking love that show, that serial killer thing last night. I know I got to fall asleep to that again. Thanks. And it was really a dark one too. It was like, um, how to tell if your kid is a serial killer. I overheard that. You miss something. That's fine when you're a mom of two boys.

Speaker 3:          00:20:14       I was so when they were first explaining all the different, you know, variables that might lead someone to be this way and they're talking about uh, you know, the CT scans they run and how their brains are different. Well yeah, but then they got to a part, I was like, Ooh, Christina might like this parcel. Christine might kind of flip out at this part and I didn't get a chance to set it up and I think I can play it for you here. Hold on. Let me see. Yeah, this just came out. What's the show called? It's called inside the criminal mind. Great.

Speaker 1:          00:20:58       Just what I was hoping to hear about Christina. Oh Shit. You're going to like that

Speaker 6:          00:21:05       for them. This area was physically shrunken by 18% this could account for why they can kill without guilt or remorse. Oh, hold on. Just give it a second. Oh, I know. I know. Criminologists have also found another possible biological predictor of Danish antisocial behavior, low resting heart rate. Oh my God. They theorize that those with low rates don't feel fear as strongly as others. Oh my God, that's you. They may be more violent and take physical risks because they are less fearful of the consequences is that life may feel a bit dull to people with low heart rates, so that's excitement and crazy intense stimulation.

Speaker 1:          00:21:54       Oh my God,

Speaker 3:          00:21:56       this is you to a tease over people that don't know. I have an incredibly low sitting heart rate because, well, I don't know, but a few years ago it was so stunning to my general physician that he sent me to Cedars Imaging Institute and the Cardiac Center and they ran a bunch of tests for a couple of days and at the end they were like, Huh, you just have a low heart rate. Like there was no diagnosis? No, I'm saying for what causes the low heart rate.

Speaker 1:          00:22:24       No, and even we had the life insurance lady come and she took your blood pressure and she was like, wow, you have a really low resting heart rate. It a serial killer husband. I even have it

Speaker 3:          00:22:34       getting that old old bit about the first time my doctor checked it out, he was like, your heart rate is like a Olympic marathon running low. I was like, yeah, it's pretty low. And he was like, why? I'm like, because I run a lot, I'm sure. Um, no, but you know in my, at my real deepest rest of the state, it's in the low forties sometimes in the thirties

Speaker 1:          00:22:59       you've listened to your heartbeat before. Like, I'll have my head on your chest,

Speaker 3:          00:23:03       go, go, go.

Speaker 1:          00:23:07       Anyways, I started to laugh so hard at those lights. Why you? You are who you are, you know? I do think that your low resting. Okay. For instance, I've taken 'em a pill that slows down my heart a little bit. I forget what it's called. Yeah. Like many, many years ago, and I used to perform on it and couldn't because it would slow me down so much and it was like Bra, but that's how you are where I'm like, oh my God, Tom, you sold out the Wilbur. Isn't this the most exciting thing? And you're like, yeah, that's great. And you kind of sighed a loud noise like, hey guys, like you totally are. It totally mellows you.

Speaker 3:          00:23:40       Oh, also I overheard the children caffeine all the time. Oh

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       yeah, you're, you're almost dead. So they say that the children of the serial killers has children. They light fires. Yeah. Bed wetters Oh, bad. Wetters and animal harmers now did it, you kill a Bald Eagle? No, I did kill an endangered. A woodpecker. Okay. But it was not chat for my, it wasn't for my own amusement. It wasn't my, it was, it was because my dad wanted me to, I also wasn't like a kid torturing it. It was a bird that was fucking up our house and he was like, shoot that. I never tortured animals. That is actually the one, you know, they discredited that. They're saying that that was what they used to tell people, so what do they tell you now? How do you know your kids is much more complicated? But in like that, that was actually very dangerous because in the fifties or sixties when they were telling people that a lot, you know, you have these parents being like, my kid pissed his pants and he lit a match. Oh Hey, I played with fire. Well, fire is fascinating. Yeah. I'm not saying that. My parents were, I might say my dad was negligent when he would drink and fall asleep and I got to play with the fireplace at the age of seven or eight. Um, when you get to play with a little bit of fire, come on. I used to throw all kinds of shit in the fireplace. But anyways, yeah, that's clearly you're the mark of a real associate star. I was like, Oh shit. They're like low heart rate.

Speaker 1:          00:25:16       I wonder what that really is for you. What this low heart rate, this low resting, all those tests, like at the one of the finest medical institutions, they were just like, you have an effective heart. You know what's so funny is that you really don't have like a sense of urgency. I've never seen you like panicked and hurried even in times when you should be like, I've never seen you like we've got, you know, like me, like I'm a Jack Rabbit. I wake up and I'm like, you're not like that at all. It takes you a long time to wind up and then like, you know what I mean? I Dunno if I've never done urgency. I've never seen you like panicked and running, running. You said even when you should be like free. Like for instance, you know, missing airplanes. Have you ever, I just don't see you doing that.

Speaker 1:          00:26:03       I remember one time we were connecting for Hawaii and you and I had to get to the thing and like that. You know what I mean? And I'm not really a runner. You're just kinda like, all right, we'll get there. Maybe that's cause you're a low resting heart way. Right. I Dunno. Maybe I don't see myself being late for a lot of flights, so either, you know, I'm always on time. It was a connection. We, it was for our vacation and it was like the airport was really fucked up. It was a Honolulu and we had to get to learn and they're like, you playing takes off in 15 minutes, but it's on the other side of the airport and we had to like book ass to get to this 10 hour. She's like, don't worry about it. No, you are. You are behind me. Like 20 steps and I was running ahead of you. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       Trying to think what, I'm trying to think of times I've seen you like a hurried. You generally like, no, I dunno. It's you're lucky. It's good. I don't see myself. Yeah. I mean I'm definitely not a panic. The person. No, that's me. That's I'm high anxiety and I tend to panic more. Definitely. You need a good balance. Yeah. Good balance. Anyways, talk about your dumps. Let's talk about our dumps. It's been so crazy. Crazy. Yeah. I'm really, it's been quite an active, my valve has been active for the last few weeks. We've been eating Paleo these last few weeks and man, the browns are just ridiculous. It's just all these nutrients. Everything's clean, you know, clean eating and it's a minimum three a day. But here's the thing. No slaps.

Speaker 1:          00:27:41       No, it's not sloppy. [inaudible] they're just like, yeah, you're healthy. And the glide ride their gliders. And I think that's been the key to my hemorrhoid relief. I don't have hemorrhoids anymore. You're eating great. Yeah. I'm not to push the Brown. Isn't it nice just slides right down three times a day? No, I go on. I go, no, no. I go in the morning. Once in the morning, but it's just easy. Like I just sit down in the brown just slides down. Huh?

Speaker 3:          00:28:06       Multiples. I know. It's just unbelief and they're normal. They're like full normal. I'm like, how is there this fives? No, like fours, three for three and a half, four, five. Is Lute looser on the Bristol stool chart? These are like healthy. No, but you're like, how is there this much inside of me?

Speaker 1:          00:28:23       I know. And then I like to weigh myself before and after just to see how it's a really neat, always weigh yourself after a doubt.

Speaker 3:          00:28:31       Oh my God. I have something so amazing. Um, I've, this guy has sent in, um, prank calls before Fort Simpson and he, uh, he sent one here. Um, the talent, I tell you if he's so good, Fort Simpson

Speaker 1:          00:28:51       tell you that prank calls and stuff. Um, it's so hard. Like how do they, how do you prepare that stuff? How do you know? Do you know what I mean? When the person says something in the moment and you're like, I have to find the button to put like how the fuck do you do that so fast? This is

Speaker 3:          00:29:04       not a simple set up. The ones that he does elaborate. So I mean, it's really dedicated. It's like writing a song. I know. And you can listen to his a prank call album. Um, it's at Fort simpson.bandcamp.com. He's got a bunch of calls on there in addition to some, um, why mh one. So here is this latest one. Holy Shit. And that thing is free. By the way, I'm going to mute this because the, uh, the link like, yeah. Yeah. This, this is so good. I realized that we've sometimes it with interruption, they should be uninterrupted. So I'll mute our lines and you can hear this. Bart Simpson and this would call uses top dog, uh, my dad and uh, I'll just let it play. Enjoy.

Speaker 8:          00:31:51       There you go. That's an 18 wheeler Jill there.

Speaker 7:          00:31:53       Me and my dad have a have a shit pile going all the back yard. We had to go for past year now.

Speaker 8:          00:31:59       Yeah, it was gigantic. Well that's why they make, those are newer things that scoop them up. Then you get, then you got one of those loans. Are they causing little wagons that they use the haul that shit away?

Speaker 7:          00:32:12       Oh, say that again.

Speaker 8:          00:32:14       I can't help it. My just, mine's always spontaneous. Spur of the moment.

Speaker 7:          00:32:19       His balls are hanging through the heavy. They're a big bowl of plaster.

Speaker 8:          00:32:25       Well that's one way of hanging around town. Oh, it's an interesting spot. Uh, polyurethane is, but it says

Speaker 7:          00:32:37       they, why you believe in luck yet since ever is a health these truck nuts work out. I think I'm all pursued making little one for women.

Speaker 8:          00:32:48       You'd be the first

Speaker 7:          00:32:50       women drive trucks too. Your miles will hit both sides of the market, you know?

Speaker 8:          00:32:54       Yeah. I don't know how you're going to make those for that, but that'd be a good one. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:32:58       I'm thinking about doing truck cuts for ladies.

Speaker 8:          00:33:05       Start making truck Lavia from our grandmas. Well that's how you're going to have to make the, push the balls and make that work.

Speaker 7:          00:33:17       Thanks for all the help that are booked. You guys have a good one.

Speaker 3:          00:33:21       Oh my God. That was really good. Bart Simpson. I love that. He um, he got that breathing joke in there. Just the way I try. You also got the guy laughing and it did top talk laugh. So they had like dad laughing together at like dad jokes the victim laughs. Oh, so dumb. So good. He has another one that I, I'm saving for next week, but uh, another incredible one that he made. Pretty funny. Yeah. Really good. Thank you. Fart Simpson. Um, go to, like I said, Fart simpson.com, or excuse me, Fart Simpson's dot bandcamp.com and you can listen to his prank calls. Very, very good stuff in d gene. Uh, it looks like people are continuing to make FTC or Gtd. Fgd Rdt. No, that'd be our TV. This is the wrong graphic. Somebody screwed up. Oh, she tea RTD. That doesn't seem right. Yeah. Other people have submitted their guesses.

Speaker 3:          00:34:33       Fake Guy tits really teased dicks. The flaming gay tinks ride. Tremendous. That's from a proud female fan rate. Forrest Gump. The rape to discuss Justin famish get Thomas Rectum Troy delicious. Steve and feels great. Remove Phil's field. Great tits removed that denim. Jason, the mystery continues. No one has been able to solve what that standard JT RTD means. And it's open to interpretation. It is open to interpretation. Um, real quick gene, oh, a couple people, um, wanted clarity on a couple of things here, um, that we can get to. One was, uh, some people had some blow back on our fat shaming and I just want it to be clear. I thought it was clear. So, but sometimes you got to hold people's hands through a conversations when they don't understand like what parts serious, what parts of joke. I think what, you know, at least what I was trying to say was that a, um, I don't think you should just obviously ever just go harass somebody for their weight.

Speaker 3:          00:35:48       No, I was saying that fat shaming was effective, but I also embraced it, you know? Yeah. Um, the other thing was like, some people were like, yeah, but, uh, are you trying to say that like you're not fat? So they know I'm, I've always said that I'm still fat and that I, but I'm actively working on it, so I, I try to eat healthier. I obviously exercise all the time. And for me, um, I don't reject fat shaming because I had an experience with it now that I do think you should, you know, you shouldn't, like I said, attack somebody for being fat. I'm just of the mindset that is not good to be fat. Don't act like it's a positive thing. And you know, if you want, if you're looking for a tactic that may or may not work for you, I enjoyed fat shaming. It works for you as a fantastic go out and like fat shame people all over the place.

Speaker 1:          00:36:44       No, I would ask you, and I don't advocate know, shitting on people. Oh, it's not that. I think first of all, I'm overweight now too. I just had a baby, so I'm fat shaming myself every day to get it back down.

Speaker 3:          00:36:58       You mean we don't do it on the Shawl Tan, but it's all we talk about with ourselves is just like, fuck

Speaker 1:          00:37:04       yeah. Well here's why I personally don't think it should be celebrated to be overweight because being overweight is not a healthy option. Yeah, that's true. So, for instance, um, I know they have like magazine covers now a cosmopolitan has a really overweight model on there and it's like celebrate, like she's obese and that's not, I don't think that that's, yeah, I understand curvy normal yet. Got It. Got It. Good. Uh, but I don't think as a lifestyle that that should be encouraged. Yeah. I would say that. But should we actively share on people know, dude, of course not. Yeah. No, I don't think it should be celebrated. Like, uh, you're clearly embracing an unhealthy lifestyle. Good for you. Like I don't think that's cool.

Speaker 3:          00:37:49       No. And I don't, I don't either. So it's like I don't advocate, um, don't harass people just because they're fat. No, but what I'm saying is like, when people write off fat shaming as a horrible thing to do, I'm like, yeah, I don't think so. And the reason I said I don't think so is because I've experienced it and I actually feel like it was a pretty good motivator.

Speaker 1:          00:38:08       Yeah. Some of the best thing that sometimes the best thing that can happen to you is one, a family member or a friend. He's like, dude, you need to, you need to ring.

Speaker 3:          00:38:16       I'll tell you the difference. When I was much younger and fat and, uh, like I told you, Latins are like this, and I would go to Peru and they would fat shaming. I would reject it. I would be like, fuck, I would, you know, I wouldn't embrace it. Yeah, I would. But I also think that I was being very much in denial at that time. Yeah. I was in denial. They were telling me, you need to lose weight. And I was like, no, I don't fuck them, you know, and that, but the truth is they were right. I did need to lose weight because being heavier contributes to heart disease to a whole host of unhealthy and denial's a strong, strong thing. So that was like, that was kind of, I dunno for me, uh, uh, kind of a lesson. No, just growing in life.

Speaker 3:          00:39:00       When, when it was brought to my attention 15 years later, I was like, yeah, yeah, they're right. You know, let's look up what being overweight does to your body. I know. I think we, we, we don't need to, I think we all get that. It's probably bad for everything. You know, it's, it's bad. It's bad for your cardiovascular system. It's, it's, you know, even my knees when I was, I'm horse joints pain that people experience in their back, ankles, knee, all, all that can be related to being overweight. It's cholesterol. Yeah, of course. No, there's, there's nothing. You don't think that's just helps you survive an overdose. That's it. That's the Chris severe car accident. There's a TV show we watch being, being overweight saved my life on TLC and this lady was like, well, because I had 50 extra pounds on me. The seatbelt like didn't cut through me basically.

Speaker 3:          00:39:53       And there's another good one, like, so there's the possibility that you don't wear a seatbelt when you drive. And a, you might live through a car accident instead of being, instead of being hurled out of the car, you might get wedged in it. So there's the other big plus. All right, so that's that. The other one, uh, for some of you dumb dumbs is, uh, so many fucking idiots is a, the Louis CK concert. Really listen to what you say, listen to what they want to hear. And I've already experienced it many times when they take things out of context, it's like, you know, like when we bring up other people, other celebrities, and they're like, why are you comparing the two? It's like we're talking about what has happened for the last year, other celebrities and the differences between what they're accused of. We were probably one of the most vocal people about the fact that it's ridiculous to come to actually mention him as someone that you would compare what they did.

Speaker 3:          00:40:54       Uh, uh, Louie did with like what Harvey Weinstein or Kevin Spacey did mentioning them in the same breath as like, hey, these guys are all abusers is not fair. It's rich, ridiculous, different shades of gray of course. So we can't make it equal. What you can talk guide as it's their fucking, yeah, you can talk about entertainers and like this guy did this, this guy that. But that doesn't mean we're saying what he did was equal to what this guy did. I mean it obviously isn't and I think the people who think it's okay to equate them are actually really doing harm to that whole movement

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       by saying that like what he did is the same and you should treat those guys the same. It's really not. We're talking about like violence, sexual crimes versus his perversion cause. I think the more specific we can get in terms of defining those gray areas, that makes the movement way more lasting way. More of an impact. If you can start really getting into the legal nitty gritty of it and being like, well what is it that Louis C k? I said, well let's, let's get into it man. Let's define it. And that way the next time it happens to a woman, we can really go after the motherfucker, right? They're not all the same, of course are not the same. And it's like peep. Some people were like thought like you're serious about, he should move to friends. Like do you really need to be explained the that part, but you're not being serious about that.

Speaker 5:          00:42:19       He should move to France. Yeah. No, I think the, there's two different issues that we discussed on this show. Right? There's those levels of seriousness of what this person has done. We weren't talking about that last week. We're talking about is the PR here. Yeah. I mean that was my, like I'm somebody who we're not even getting into what's the evil of it. I'm somebody who has always been like, I'll just say like I've been a huge fan of his, a big admirer of his ability and talent. Like he's, to me, one of the greatest, you know, and when he did, when he came out and did what he did and you know, had to, to go away, it made sense to me. I always thought there's a path to redemption for him. Right. Like that. That to me it was like, that makes sense. What he did was a bad swing.

Speaker 5:          00:43:05       It is come backable. That's what it is. And Cosby not come back up again, come back, you're gone. So I'm like, that makes sense. He's going away. There is a path to redemption. And to me the surprising thing was not that he did stand up, it's that he managed the optics so poorly. To me, that's the part that stood out. It's just that I go, this is a really smart guy on top of being a really talented guy and when you're really smart and really talented and really influential, there's a higher standard for you. It's just the way it is, whether you like it or not. It's just the way it is. For him to get onstage after this break in this climate, in this time, and be like, no statement, no addressing things, no like donation, no own op ed piece about it. That to me was just a lot of just like what, you're not going to do any of those?

Speaker 5:          00:43:58       That seems like PR 101 so that's the part that to me, you stood out and that is a discussion we had last week. It's more about the startling lack of awareness. Yeah. Social climate and being like, I'm just going to do this. Let's talk about cookies and candy and like, Whoa Bro, you guys that don't get that by the way are equally like as out of out of touch with what's going. Like you seem that out of out of touch, you seem that disconnected and you're actually, if you're a huge fan of his, you're doing a him more harm by being like, so what you still just to like, because you're actually fueling the fire of the blow back of the people who are like never again. You're making that grow when you're like, so it didn't do anything and I help him. First of all, it hasn't been positively received in our community from what I gather.

Speaker 5:          00:44:55       No, the p the press has been really bad on it. Um, it just shows a lack of awareness and it does show kind of an obliviousness to the culture, to the climate is when I'm saying of course, regardless of whether or not you think it's what he did is wrong or how wrong or shitty do Stan who get like as somebody like I remain, I remain a big fan of course. And I'll tell you all I hope that he does is digest what's currently going on and take those steps now so that he can go back with like having put forth a huge effort and said like, you know, I checked all the boxes so that people who are fans go see like, you know, you're a good guy. Yeah. I took all the steps and I think that's what Americans love. They love an apology.

Speaker 5:          00:45:44       They love and they love a come to Jesus and apology. They love to think that you're a good guy. Yes. So if you know this about America, yeah. Give them, take a page of the Michael Vick. Vick was like, yes, he went to prison. He could have come out of prison, like suck my practic for life. And instead he like, he partnered with the humane society, you know, he um, he made it, he made donations. He filed for, I forget whether it's seven or chapter, whatever one where instead of like doing a way with his debts, he made it so that he had to pay back his debts almost in full. You know, and it's like, it's like why is that important? It just makes people go like, oh, you're not a piece of shit. Like he did it for himself, but he also did it so that people go like, you know what?

Speaker 5:          00:46:35       You did a horrible thing. But like you're a pretty good, Americans love to forgive. Of course, we're Christians. We love a good apology. That's the part that I go like, what do you do? Well, here's the thing. Some people say, well, he already apologized in that letter and how many times does he have to apologize? Well, as many times as it is necessary to make the women that he harmed feel something. Right. And look, it's just, it's from a fucking PR perspective, dummy. Yeah. It's just a, it was a dumb fucking deal. Do all this shit that Americans like, go donate money to the women's, blah, blah, blah. You know, and I'll show, I'll show that you fucking give a shit and then come back. Yeah. That's the way to do it. And I do have this, I know that Tmz and uh, NBC, they're all going to take this from us and hopefully they'll credit. Um, we actually got in touch with somebody who was on the street. I guess that's does it Macdougal street where the club is right after the show. Wow. They found someone who was walking out right after the show and it just hasn't made it anywhere else. But here. So this is that post that Luis said at the cellar. Pretty incredible stuff here.

Speaker 7:          00:47:48       So you were at the Louis CK show. What'd you think? How big his Dick was? Real? Did he masturbate each act dog board drill. Wow. Was it a lot? Yeah. Yeah. Hot white come. That's really something and it makes me wish I'd seen him or dread.

Speaker 5:          00:48:15       Wow. That's incredible. That's really something. Oh man, we need a, yeah, Pretty Wild, Huh? Pretty good stuff there. Hot and thick. Come, I didn't know that men really were invested in the hotness and the thickness of it. It makes a difference, doesn't it? Are you more, are you happier when it's hotter and thicker? I've never know. I mean, the thickness. Some I never think about temperature. I mean, sometimes you go like, wow, this is really, really kind of thin. And what does that do? You know, does that mean anything? It feels like it's you've, you're draining yourself like thickness usually I think to people goes like, oh, I'm backed up. This has been sitting in others. There's more swimmers in that. Yeah. You're like, I'm really producing some stuff. Well, no, just like I haven't emptied the tank. Oh, so it's darker cloudier Saudi or brine.

Speaker 5:          00:49:05       Yeah. And then when it's real thin, you're like, man, I need to put this thing away. Something's going on. Um, do you know where you are? A big John Landis Fan, right? Sure. Who's the director of? Oh, right. No, I don't know. What did he make? John Landis has an incredibly, he's like an eighties guy. Yeah. Yeah. I love eighties movies. Let's see him. Ivan Reitman. Yeah. Fam Course. I love the woman a Amy Heckerling. That woman pretty much made every movie I've ever loved from the eighties and nineties. Clueless. She did fast times at Ridgemont, high European vacation. All good films. Um, so here's some John Landis stuff. Tiny. I know the name, but I like animal house, the Blues Brothers, all blues brothers. Great places. Yes. A twilight zone. The movie he directed thriller. No spies like us. Love that movie. Amigos. Yes. One little movie called coming to America for my favorite comedy of all time. Definitely. He made Beverly Hills cop three. Great. He May, let's see. Oh No, actually it's the third one. Great. Probably not. Um, but whatever. I mean that's a pretty insane list as it is. Right? Those are a lot of home runs, dude. Yeah. Coming to America as a perfect comedy, I think. Yeah, that's pretty Ghostbusters pretty much. Anyways, this is him and I don't know when this interview took place, but I thought you might like this. Check this out.

Speaker 9:          00:50:35       Like my brother and I went and stayed with them and we, we met Bundy for the first time. Bundy told me, you know the first line that Bundy told you that, but the first line of every Hungarian recipe steal a chicken. Yes. That's something my grandfather would say to.

Speaker 5:          00:50:52       And then he's got more,

Speaker 9:          00:50:54       my grandfather was crazy about Hungarians Darien's who are the really the Hungarian Polish or the people who really founded Hollywood. But the, uh, sell it though. We continue to think about Hungaria this though. There's also a Gary. It is someone who comes into a revolving door behind you and exits in front of me.

No, no, let's do it. Let's keep rolling. Okay. Um, this, I also found this morning and made me so happy. You know, when you just are filled with joy at seeing something pulled off. Yeah. This fucking guy, he's Asian and he was at a Mcdonald's and he relies on the walls like of there like posters. It's just white people. And he was like, I feel like we're underrepresented. So he made his own poster. Oh good. And he put it up at that Mcdonald's and they haven't taken it down. So your hands are underrepresented too? It's uh, it's pretty amazing. I just kind of skim through his video, but like, oh my God. So he ordered, this is this kid. He, uh, he's at Mcdonald's, you know, he notices like this empty wall and he notices that the posters are just like, you know, white kids. So he has a picture made, he throws logos on and he orders it from like a whatever. What is it called? The Kinko's or whatever that makes,

Speaker 10:         00:54:49       that's Rad. I have to look at that. Oh, that's awesome.

Speaker 3:          00:54:56       It's like, and he threw like the same graphics that they have on it. Yeah. Same stupid. And they throw a Mcdonald's logo at the bottom here. It's great.

Speaker 10:         00:55:05       And then, and we made a date with other friends to go hang it up. The Big Day was upon us. I loaded the post stroke, my dad's car, I met our friends there. I'm there. This, I wore a jacket covering my uniform and wait until the coast was clear from any employees. He also,

Speaker 3:          00:55:29       he got, he went to a thrift store. Yeah. And he got to Mcdonald's like an old meat, like a Mcdonald's shirt that was there. And then he made a laminate that said like regional. Oh, you know, um, I don't know. Oh, so he's like, I'm, I'm the corporate bubble by as this new artwork. Just think place though. Like he didn't actually introduce himself.

Speaker 10:         00:55:47       How's The coast is clear? I would take off my jacket toe Christian, Cassandra, how to visit you. That's him regional.

Speaker 3:          00:56:00       Teary. Your directory. That's it. Totally made up.

Speaker 10:         00:56:16       I love it. It is [inaudible] it was up. Oh, I need a second. Okay, so we put the poster up and I gotta change my shirt. I'm so, I'm like over the main Cassandra. This is Christine. I'm shaking. I'm changing right now. Okay. I got this. It's okay. Right? That was something, wow, that's been upset. I really, oh,

Speaker 11:         00:56:52       it's been a few weeks. No one noticed works there that they added this poster and it's, it'd be like if we took a picture of ourselves and you put it up there, no one said anything. He, he tweeted today. That's how I found out about this. It's been 51 days. 51 days. This guy made a poster of himself and his friend trying to put it up in and Mcdonald's. Yeah. That's so good. So great. I love it. I know. It made me so happy, so much. Seriously. Watch this today. I was just,

Speaker 10:         00:57:26       they'll never take it down. Remember folks, all races deserve recognition. Okay. Lab and I guess I did my part

Speaker 11:         00:57:39       and that's like, they're just eating at them underneath.

Speaker 5:          00:57:44       Do we know where in the world this is? I don't know. They do this. You can see this video. This guy's a youtube channel. It's, um, his name is j. E. V. H. Oh my God. Or you can just search. We became Mcdonald's poster models, I guess Jeff. Anyway, I fucking love. So amazing. I'm loving it.

Speaker 12:         00:58:09       Ah,

Speaker 5:          00:58:11       that's so awesome. Yeah, they're right though. I mean, Mcdonald's is around the world. It's not just white people. I mean, you can go pretty much anywhere in the world and there's Mcdonald's. There's no, you can go everywhere. Yeah. No, they're, it's an, it's a, that's probably only not in Antarctica. It's everywhere. I know. It's pretty amazing. Right. And do you know that? I mean they, yeah. Anyway, they can, they can build one in like less than a week or something crazy. I know. Let's see. How many Mcdonald's, um, locations are there? Let's see. Mcdonald's restaurants are in 120 countries and territories. Uh, they operate, there's 36,000, 899 right now.

Speaker 12:         00:58:53       Yeah. Crazy.

Speaker 5:          00:58:55       That is nuts. Here is the list. That's pretty funny. Oh my God. See? Pretty much everywhere. South Africa was going to ask love Africa, Africa that does that. But there is like, what is this? This is in Africa and Asia. It's fucking crazy. Oh yeah. South Africa. Mom's straight. Leah. I've eaten it a few. They're all over South America it looks like, except for whatever that is. America number one. That is, it's embarrassing. Which one do you know? I don't know. This one. He was at believes.

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       I don't know. I don't fucking know, but they're everywhere else. It's been a while since seventh grade. Yeah, it would opa. Yeah. Even those dirty roof skis. How's he too? Yeah. It's a lot. Pretty impressive stuff. Yeah. I'm really, I'm really amazed by what those you, but you would think that Mcdonald's will be really up on that multicultural tab. You know, I just think it's funny that the manager is that Mcdonald's was like, oh yeah, they finally got that poster taken care of that wall. Hey, now, but people are generally very unobservant now let's see what happened, because this is the kind of thing that that tweet went viral. They're going to figure out where that is the coupe. The cool thing is that Mcdonald's could make it really cool and be like, hey, you know, we discovered that this was at this and celebrate it and be like, guess what? That poster staying up and we're going to give you free French fries for a year or whatever. Or they could be like, ah, it's not okay to do that. You know, vandalism. Yeah. I hope they, I hope they back to PR kind of manage it in a smart way, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:00:29       I think makes me happier than clever vandalism. I know it really, I swear it just tickles my little taint. I just love it. You know, even something as small as in um, in school when he used to have, I dunno, they have textbooks anymore and you could take your eraser and like erase the eyeball on somebody's picture and then draw a bigger one and like do shit like that. And so like the next kid gets to your talents and are just erasing big Dicks, you know, you erased it and then you draw the Dick.

Speaker 3:          01:01:00       There's a poster of a real estate guy at one of these, it's like near a high school right here. And the poster hangs there and they cut his eyes and they cut his mouth out and he's like, it looks terrifying. I feel bad for the GAA cause I know he paid for it and then he replaced it. But it was like that for a while and he was like, thanks a lot dick heads. It's pretty great. But it's high school kids. You know, they're going to do something like that. Of course. Why don't we take a break gene and uh, we'll be back with our guests. Uh, Brenda's swab. Brenda, I think that's her name. Isn't that her name? You may have heard of the finance here. Charles Schwab. He had a daughter Brenda, who recently transitioned to a man and he's here now. Brendan Charles Schwab mess things up for me.

Speaker 3:          01:01:43       I'm sure. Did you look like a man? Thanks Bro. Good job. Good job. Yeah, I totally would believe you. A guy. Yeah. Um, real quick before we get into some other stuff here, I just pulled this up from episode four 61 of your mom's house. I don't know if you could comment on this for us at all. He was, then we started talking about how Tiger Tiger fucking dumb now. Oh no being times, but you hear it. You had to play this for him. Please do it. Brendan Schaub son's name is tiger. It is. No, it's not. Yes

Speaker 11:         01:02:20       it is. It's a great name. And in this case it's a nickname. Retinas. This is real. People would have allowed us to get away with not doing. People tag me. They're like, yeah, I'm sorry I forgot your love you. Here's the thing with that. This little dude has everything, man. He's grown up in silk sheets and Santa Monica. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Pop was rich. So rich business is booming, so he's, he has a good life, right? I need him not to be the cool kid in school. I need them to have something to poke fun at me. Like your name's tiger going to be like Scott, former UFC fighter. You know, he's got weird ears. Yes. Yeah. Like they're not, there's not a lot that can go, there's not a lot brown. So I figured, let me push back from the Wa is always, you know, naming of something is a child.

Speaker 11:         01:03:24       Obviously. The big thing it's like was was the wife cool right away? What's she like? We had all these names picked out Max. Again, that Mexican Tiger Woods is an example where you're like, oh, I figured that assholes making a comeback because he was kind of gone and, uh, I went here. We had all these names picked out. This one's going to flinch up first, but now I want you to sit on it cause it's different. Cause I, I don't like regular names like Jim, Bob just hear me out here. Tiger. And she was like, what? And I'm like Whoa, face that I fucking mate. I know, right? Most people don't sit on it for the night and next one she's like, I'm not mad at. And as soon as she was like starting to feel it out, boom, that's it. Tiger patch shop. What's an Alliant pax packs after my uncle who passed away. Who's a good guy? He's a real piece of card piece of shit because I really want this kid to hit it home.

Speaker 11:         01:04:30       This is your mom's house. Do you think we could, he would have left and everyone would have been like, how did you not bring up the tiger bit? No loyalty you have. But I also knew that he wouldn't be like, no, hell no. I know I had to tell Rogan's name was talking to on areas. You never shot a tiger on my, please don't be mean to me about the phone call when we call it. Okay. So it's like a big deal to reveal the name. Right. And like sometimes you hold onto it, you know, even let's say you know the name a month before we held onto the second one. So the first one I'm saying like, you know, like you'll say you knew tiger at six months for sure. And people will start asking you, do you know the name? And you might be like, ah, not yet. Because you don't necessarily want to tell every, you want them to judge like a new tattoo. Totally. That's a really good analysis. So when people like me like tiger,

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       that's ridiculous. And then it burst your bubble. No, it's cool. Yeah. So, but we, uh, we held on forever. We kept, we kept lying about like, like, Nah, I've just haven't figured it out. And like family would be like, you have no, no. I'd be like, nope, I haven't thought of anything. You to creative souls, nothing, nothing. And then finally it was, you know, we're at eight months on the first kid and a we call weird. I remember we were driving and palace fair days and we pulled over. Oh yeah. And my parents and they're like, oh are you going to tell us the name? And I was like, let's do it. And you were so excited. I know. I was so excited. And my mom is Peruvian, you know, so like heavy accent. Yeah. And I go, she's like, tell us the name to me. All, all right. I go, we're naming him and this is verbatim. How is when I go, we're naming him Ellis.

Speaker 11:         01:06:02       And she goes, is he gay? No, my unborn son. That's your SWOT. Is he gay? I'm like, well I don't know yet. We could be. And then she's like, oh, I'm like the fuck man. He's like, Hey Leese I'm like that. That's your fee. I'm telling you your grandson's name. No, she goes [inaudible] like Perry Ellis. Perry Ellis had aids. Yeah. Damn mom. No, I don't say I'm still scarred in the pain.

Speaker 5:          01:06:32       Yeah, I don't say shit cause it's my mother in law. I can't, I can't talk shit to her the same way he can. So I, yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like it's been really fun to share this with you. Well, you know my dad, you know my dad said, uh, when I first found out I was pregnant, he goes, you know what's a good name?

Speaker 11:         01:06:48       Art Are Sir, which is my dad's name. Yeah. Cool. Thank you dad. Thank you. Fine. I got, he's hitting the worst man. He said it like he was telling you about a name he heard. Yeah. So you know what I mean? It'd be like you're like, Hey, do you know what I actually like a kind of a cool name is cause I, I don't hear it like all the time. And you're like, wait, what? Like her name, you go like, you know, the day I told him my name and they're like, that's a cool name. And you're like, wait a minute, are you telling me about your fucking name right now? And that's exactly how he told him that. I told him when my girlfriend was pregnant and when I came home and she had like the test, I'm like, Oh shit, we got to call someone and get to tell someone.

Speaker 11:         01:07:25       And I was like, Oh, I to call my dad first. My Dad's like very strict businessman, like super business where I get all my work ethic from and I call my dad and I have it on speaker phone. My girls like in tears, all excited and I'm like, watch this. I put, Hey Daddy, what's up? I go join US pregnant silence. And he goes, Damn, uh, why? No, you don't have to keep it right click, I'll call you back. And I went, whoa. I did not think it was gonna go like that. He said something like, he said something like, well you know, you don't have to get married, right. Or something like it was not good cause were you guys dating? Yeah, we were dating, you know, for like a year or two. And that was his opposition to the, yeah. Why would he say that? He was just like damn, just being practical. I'm saying like young rapper or something like that.

Speaker 11:         01:08:17       You're an adult, but he said, man, take it easy. You have brothers and sisters. I have an older brother and his, does he have children? He does not. He's a psycho. He's selfish. He loves my son, but he, uh, I dunno. He's a psycho. He's my tournament. She's on the road with me. He's like, oh, really? Yeah, he just really met him. I'm sure I met him at that fight. That, that I shared against you on it. Oh yeah. I told him like, oh, I forgive you. Didn't know my son's name. He works against him now. I would be jumping up and down for him. I know. I just mistakenly thought Matt Mitrione went to Lsu. So mom, bro, sometimes to think about if I took a fight again, I'll come out with a comedy store shirt and have all my Korean friends with me and walk to the ring with you.

Speaker 11:         01:09:04       Yeah, I went to be sick. And what if everybody like Tuh Tuh Tuh further in the joke just made a goofy faces as they walked in and like a bunch of clones, a bunch of clowns. And I get my password. It's all horrible at night. I was at a fight when it's, I want to tell it like a dozen of these fights, uh, opening for Joe for a while. Um, so, and I hardly knew anybody, but there was a guy one time who came out in a pink Tutu and his gimmick there was like a joke and he played lineman, not Ed Herman. Uh, Dave Herman did that maybe, and he came out to weird song, he came back to a weird song and he was wearing a tutu and everybody was like, well, he better fucking win because if you lose on this, it's like, why are you playing games?

Speaker 11:         01:09:46       It's even worse. And I think he did lose titty. Did you ever see the guys who came out? It was a Australian or New Zealand cat and they must have studied all night and they came out the exact men in black outfits and did the dance here come the man in black. Yeah. Loser with I think key one you got to win if you do something. You know what I mean? If you're, if you're not focused on your fight cause you're doing dance routines, then you're a meme for the next 10 years and if you're, if you're a whole thing is like I'm going to wear a pink Tutu. You better when you got to win or you're just crazy. Totally crazy. I just had a thought back related to like telling your parents really important stuff in your life. Doesn't that make it like be really cognizant now when your children tell you something like just killing sided just always pretend hurts my feelings.

Speaker 11:         01:10:36       I've told her a bunch of times about one of my aunts will be like, um, you know, she'll come to a show and when like other relatives obviously are going to be like you were great, you know the way a relative does, she'll be like, I thought everyone was great though. She'll make the point, they don't get how bad that hurts me as an athlete or comic. You're sensitive man. Of course. I remember you saying that. That just when I played at University of Colorado had to sit out a year so I red shirted so I went playing the games, not suit up. I remember, I won't say what family member it is cause we get pissed and so all the families there were all the players go and I went and they're like, oh my God, you played so great. That was fantastic. I was all

Speaker 9:          01:11:14       fuck you man. I get hurt. My feelings so bad. Or I remember my first time my mom saw me do stand up was at the laugh factory at the laugh factory and sports. It's horrible. Oh my God. I come out and I go to, you get it. I go, do you guys have fun? Goes my mom was, it was, it was an interesting, you know, and she's changed it real fast. You went, yeah, I saw Kevin Nealon though.

Speaker 11:         01:11:36       No, the right answer is you are fantastic. I'm so proud of you for trying something. Yeah. You know, my mom's side's me. She saw me in the belly room and I did. Well, I didn't do like, I didn't eat shit. I didn't kill. I did okay. And she's like, Van, you know, it's not like what you are saying is funny. I like how you say it. And I was like, thank you. Thank you. Was that even at that, it also gave me like, um, even now, like God, my dad would be like, I, uh, I pay attention to the audience and the moments that they laugh and where they don't like that one thing, they didn't laugh. Oh my God, he does. Or if I give, like if I do like pho anger, you know, it's not like, yeah, fuck this shit. He's like, I don't know if I would do that. Thank you for the notes. I'm glad to hear. Thank you Chris Rock for the notes. We got to get him doing movie reviews on this show. That'd be hilarious. Um, oh wait, wasn't it? Oh, you know what I love when he tells you to do, he's like, you know what you should do buddy is regional. He'll go reference it. Yeah. I'm like, no one's ever thought of this. He's like, that's brilliant. Pops. He's like, cause you remember that time you're in Minnesota and you said how cold it was. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:12:51       My thought, first of all, why dad was in Monterey at the car show with my brother, this is last week, mind you and sewn goes. Someone goes, AH, they're talking about, uh, kids. And my dad goes, oh yeah, my, my son lives in California. And they guy goes, oh, what's he do out there? And my dad goes, uh, he gets on stage and then, um, he's like an Internet personality, but then he'll get on stage and like tell stories in my brother, you know, he's, my tour manager goes, no, he'd just stand up comedy Demo Day goes, no, no, no, no. He didn't do that. He gets on stage and like tell stories you didn't do comedy. And my brother's was like, that's exactly what he does. Why would he make that distinction? I just, he just doesn't. Or by Dad, this is like, oh my God. It's like a year ago goes, you know, I think you should do some, I mean, you should do some bits on Trump. I want it, dude. I can't believe I didn't stand out. That's exactly what I should do that, wait, did he, when

Speaker 11:         01:13:42       you grow up, when you were growing up, did he likes to end up like you remember him watching specials? No, not really. No. My mom did. My mom did comedy buck. Who was she into? Do you remember? We'd watch Saturday night live every weekend. She loved it all. Yeah. Oh, that's cool. Your dad like none of that was like for sure. Pick a football. So fucking stupid street football, wreck your brain, pick up, shut the fuck. Think sign me up for tech. Football on us for that. Now you're, you're obviously in a committed relationship. Now when you were a single guy, did you request or even demand that

Speaker 3:          01:15:54       before, but this is when I, when I worked in DC, after I graduated college, I had a job for a few months and um, uh, I remember Tracy was a black dude I worked with at America's most wanted in DC on Wisconsin Avenue and one day I give Tracy a ride and he sat in the passenger seat. He was like, you know, like, like what's up? He's like broke up with my girl man. I was like, I was like, Oh shit. Really? I was like, how long were you together? He's like, three years. I want to go. Damn man. Like what happens? Like showing my ass no more. I was like, Shit. I was like, this is the reason that you broke up. And he was like, yeah, Dan is like, you mean like the foundation of your relationship piece of it. And he was like, she won't do it no more.

Speaker 11:         01:16:45       I mean cold if that's your thing though that if you would like to your main, if that's like what you guys are built on its ass and eating. She doesn't do it when aren't you gay? If their main thing is but stuff. No because it's just the ass heating and we would like, cause she put fingers in there like she said if he was like Dicks, there's always discipline indexes gave tongues are not are unquestionably gay. I had a here that's like yeah have you, if he was left this other dude won't fuck my ass no more. So I broke up with my girl. I'll be like yeah I think you're gay bro. You know what's interesting about ass eating though? It's like it's having the audacity to enjoy it because I think I think why we're so opposed to it cause I'm sure having your but like just pleasurable right? It's, I mean it's nice but it's really being that person was bold enough to be like you fucking lick my ass. I don't care how dirty that should cause cause I'm so self conscious, I'm like, Ooh, there's probably Brown there. Even though I'm pretty clean. It's having the balls to be like, it's fucking Likud. It's also just fucking, you're the person doing it. It's like I'm dangerous. I'm nasty, nasty shit.

Speaker 11:         01:17:54       It's like freak level declaring it's waving the flag and then it's like looking at you afterwards. Like you know what kind of person. But it's also uncomfortable if they just do it like that. Nice young lady would ask you like, I've had it before. We girls, they have their fingers done it as as long fake ones and they'll put them fingers in the rump pole and you're Dukie shoot. Yeah. It just depends. No questions asked that. Guess what? That's not her first time doing that. That's what I'm saying. It's Kinda rude. Yeah, it's a little rude. It's rude. I know. One of my friends told me about how he met online lady who came over and it was like, okay, you're coming over. He didn't even, so she's new to him. He wasn't even prepped, like wash, showered, and she changed his died. I went down there on wash be whole.

Speaker 11:         01:18:43       I used to know a girl that would only like to have sex, anal, like chewed. Only want that. Really? Wow. Wow. But She Persian, oh, white girl. White girl. I believed in the Lord or no doubt it. Yeah. I said not that and just surprise Ya. Um, so our 10 year anniversary is later this year and we got this email. Uh, someone said I was delighted to hear Christina's request for ideas on how to celebrate your 10 year anniversary and here are my thoughts. I can't get all of your friends and family together for a celebration after dinner. Gather them around to show a video of Youtube scat sex and through a hammer. Yeah. That's pooping through the Hummus. Get on a Ferris wheel with some family members, smoke meth and molest each other until there is a four stroke. Come. Yup. Wow. Then get a funnel cake. Wow. Have some hot black guys with cows over for a month of rape play. They can beat you while the cows piss on. You. Offer them to stay with you for awhile and exchange for being there. Hot White come dumpsters. I hope this helps. High and tight Jim. Wow Jim. Wow. Really neat offer. I love the hope. This helps. I hope this helps suggest like corporate. Um, I don't know. Do you feel like any of those tickle your feather? I'll marinate on it a little bit. We're going to be married for 10 years.

Speaker 11:         01:20:06       And how long did you guys date before that? For

Speaker 9:          01:20:09       long time. So we can get her for a minute. Yeah. Yeah. He will eat a gene. I know we have two kids now. Isn't that crazy? To me that's the part that's even crazier. It's weird when you have to get used to the idea of a child like you. Like we forget about him. So he's only six weeks, seven weeks old this week. Do you feel, I feel like when I had a kid, life got way more serious for me. Like so scared of everything. Think about death daily. I think about to me dying daily and thinking about tragedy happening to both my children. Like, what if they get that weird meningitis and ended up in the hospital and need a spinal tap? I had one of those, uh, those, it's like two wheels in the front, one wheel on the back, those little a thing called slingshots.

Speaker 9:          01:20:49       They sent one to try out and like have fun with. When I was younger I would fucking wheelies, take a thing of my buddies hanging off naked or whatever. But then I got on that thing, I was going down PCH and also having fun with it and I was like, this isn't a bad thing, just don't have a helmet on. And then I Florida, I put in a third gear and it swiped around like, and I'm facing incoming traffic on PCH. And literally I was like, I can't do this. I can't die man. I can't die. You got a kid. So I literally called him the kid, come get this thing. I think about it too. I know even one of my friends were telling me about road ratio, the, he's like, you still have it. And I go, yeah, I felt habit with this thing happens now sometimes.

Speaker 9:          01:21:26       And I think it's from being a parent where you'll be like, you know when you have crazy thoughts, you're like, I'm just going to for sure t bone, that car, I'm going to go, I'm like punched in the fucking window. Drag that. Like you start having crazy thoughts and then you're like, look, I'm a dad. I can't be like Dan. And then you just like totally calm down. You're like, just everybody just go to these crazy thoughts. Sorry my thought like Bs. It is crazy. I've never felt older because now I'm like super into my lawn. That's a real dad shit. Some Dad Shit Bro. My lawn watering and my focuses and I'm just my gate. It's like that's my shit. That's my shit. I got real excited about it all too. I love it, man. Yeah. I get excited about mail. Anything home related?

Speaker 9:          01:22:15       Yeah. I just want to be home. Yeah, it's of course it's great. I love being home. I mean it's obviously our jobs are all traveling, but I really look forward to going home. It's hard. It's hard for me. It's hard to travel. People are way better at me. I suck at like vacation, stuff like that. I don't like hotels cause when you're on the road, how many hotels have you stayed in a hotel? I'm like, to me like I can't shut down here. Like I can't relax here in the hotel. I just, you a rental house? AIRBNB ahead. Well that's a good idea though. That's a great idea. That was really great. When I'm Burt and Ari and I did it for that national championship game last year. Oh that's airbnb. The house. It was, dude, I was talking about on my show. Your, I think you watch a little college football, right? Yeah, he watches a casual, I dunno, like in the comedy scene, like my friends, I don't, I don't know anyone. And sports count

Speaker 11:         01:23:06       doesn't, Rogan doesn't Dalea does. I was super stoked that college football's back to frank about it came the night. Did you let your kids play football? And I don't know if I don't want them to on it. I mean the injuries, no way. No Way. And our sounds are cannon balls do like, here's the difference. There's some good safe sports, soccer, tennis, swimming, running. I played sports. I played all through elementary, middle high. You there is really, there's just as much danger or playing soccer as pee wee football because there's no high, like the hits are not lying to her fast enough. You're not dude. They're not. I still feel like the exception to with the CT when you see guys come out with Ct. Yeah. I'm like, yeah, but where's all the guys who don't have it? We don't hear from them. The majority don't have it.

Speaker 11:         01:23:55       Dude, a kid playing sixth grade football. He is not the, it's not like Bo Jackson's out there, you know Lawrence Taylor's not fucking blind sight. What about that big kid on the other team? There's always one. There's a Brendan Shab, you know who's like the fucking enormous sixth graders once a year. Once a year. No idea or Jane plan around. Yeah, and then I take my kiss. I'm like, kid til you hit that kid in the knee. You got to take her home and his name. He was like, what? My head down crown or he might, you might be singing a different tune though when you see him in high school and he's this baller than Tom comes. They're like, damn, we got an offer from Stanford. They were like, why go pick up that football? Yeah. I Dunno. I don't want my boys to be weenies though. I definitely want them to be killer.

Speaker 11:         01:24:37       Fine Line. Well killers is aggressive. It's a fine line. Oh, killers. She's, what'd you get a kid into Jujitsu is fine for confidence. Kickboxing. No, no, no. Well I wouldn't let him spar. Right, but you'd love train. Well, I'm trained boxing like I do now and then I hit mits up. I never get hit in the head. I'd love football. The, the juice is worth the squeeze. You can take him places they probably wouldn't be able to get, they're going to meet a lot of good people network. Then getting to school is a great team. Great team. Camaraderie is awesome. Yeah. Um, wouldn't let him fight. Definitely when I'm flooded. No. Fighting's bad. Right? Terrible. You don't wanna you don't have to take head shots all the time. But that's the thing is like you can play football for all of elementary, middle, high school, and maybe have a couple of your bell rung a few times.

Speaker 11:         01:25:24       You know Jesus if got, if you've taken it to like one of these top tier programs in high school, like where they fucking recruit and we write the streets. Taft then no punk. Yeah. And there's AR, there's a, Oh there's IMG academy and you know these Hoover highs, these programs. Have you seen one of those games? Yeah. It's nuts. Yeah, I've been to one. I was like, what tough. He was, might've been a little beat us in college. I did wines. Huge. Crazy. But then when you start getting these big time programs like were where he played. Yeah, you could come out like with a slur and you're speeding like load, you know. But I'm saying that's the likelihood that a kid will be playing that it's like swimming swimming's need this women's nice. That's safe. Tennis if was a better swimmer, I wouldn't mind that.

Speaker 11:         01:26:11       That'd be great to year round though. You gotta go all the way. You think about this guy, this guy is going to tell us what he wants to play. We're always mocking the way people look and the choices they make up. This guy, David ferry is a professional, former professional golfer on the European tour. He works at a television personality and he's rocking this beard right now. What do you think of that? Oh Wow. I mean look at the, cause his, the call line is out here. He did it across the middle of the chewed. I look at the gun. I think he fucks. You think he's big Dick Energy. Key fucks Sake Dick Energy. Okay. Just sticky energy. Do you think he deliberately got the shading different? Like that's an idea for 100% there's a bad guy from the book. This is a villain cut. Right? The billing.

Speaker 11:         01:26:59       But now it's, as Brendan said that I just pictured this guy getting off an elevator and walking into the bar of the hotel and he's like, just so everyone knows here, I fucked pretty good. Yes. That's what I, that's what I, and he orders his drink from afar. You know, some people are like, I didn't come here. I want to order my help. Yeah. He's just like, no, we're just, we're the table. Oh yeah. And jumped in his Maserati and fuck [inaudible] thing gets his ass licked. Demands on a second. Yeah. Do you think like if you're a lady and you meet him and he's like, come into my room, you're like okay. And then you go to the shower to freshen up his bathroom and you like put your makeup on and she would come back in the bedroom and he's on all fours and he's like, that's where it starts.

Speaker 11:         01:27:37       He pushes your head into it points back to the forest is yours. Like you know what to do. See I think he lays down and just scratch this. Let's do you think he pulls it back? A baby? He grabbed it on ankle. On, yeah. Oh, one is bold. That's that big Dick Energy. But you don't want to have a forest like a towel. That's not sexy. It's not sexy balls hanging down the back. It's a funnier look. It is. The Big Duke Energy Moves. Lay on your back and just spread your legs. Yeah, it's a girl. The girl's like, oh, like I guess it a cool Maserati.

Speaker 11:         01:28:11       He's got those big veneers too though. Hey does he went full white? Cause he fucks all day over here too. That's all he cares about. I'm a Maserati and veneers. Nothing worse. Eight. I'm thinking about getting veneers. He, yeah, my friend too. They look good. I the best guy. He makes magic glass. I'll give me, I didn't even have braces. Check this out. Okay. I think you had Braille. Listen, this guy comes in not pad, Bro. Let me see. The bottoms are not bad. They're not great. I mean I've seen wider. Yeah. All right, thanks. Hey, that's come from a guy with 50 shades of brown teeth though. Hold on now let your mind bro. No, those are good and you've got it.

Speaker 13:         01:28:49       Yeah. Yeah. What's up? What's up bro? Hold on. Now

Speaker 11:         01:29:02       you were saying you were thinking about getting your veneers. What? Which ones would you veneer though? Yeah, your teeth are fine. I just feel like if I had been there it'd be sick. No, I looked too much like a giant Mario Lopez. You think? Oh my God. Yeah. I never thought of AC slash Slater vibe going on. I do see that. Do you think he's got that BD? The big they Kennedy? I don't get it from him. No to you later. I did. When we turn this chair backwards, big Duke Energy. I was on a plane, went by him and he did, he did like the terminal and the gate and the boarding all with sunglasses, you know, and like I was like, okay, alright. Alright Bro. And he did the inside like the window seat. So, and he had somebody like a handler and the ILC.

Speaker 11:         01:29:52       Ah, that's not big. Very different. No, it's not necessarily big energy. Very different though than like his onscreen persona where he's like, hey, guess what's in theaters this week? You know, I did a show with them. He was like, hey, how you doing Brandon? Good to see. I'm like, Bro, who are you talking to them? Why do your full makeup? Huh? What are you talking like that? Good to see you. What do you think? I'm like dude, you got to stop. Yeah, Hollywood. Wait too long man. He's got one of those gigs. It's so visible. Like it's one of those Hollywood access is in hotel rooms when you turn on the TV everywhere. And it's also um, you know we take them serious though. No, I don't think so. He probably knows too, like this is a good gig in the, in the grand scheme of things, this is a gig he's probably had for fucking 10 years and heavy and like as long as you look presentable and he stays in great shape, you can just keep being like, here's a, another new exciting Brian and Schwab you and stand up again here in Dallas.

Speaker 11:         01:30:51       Torn box. And just to keep his man card, I could take a picture with Oscar de la Hoya. He'll be at all the fights. That's it. So he has a podcast that's all boxing too. So it was it Mario Lopez. He does. So he really knows his shit. Then he must think he like hangs around the fudge. And so you watch a lot of boxing or no? Um, I do. Yeah, I do. You're gonna Watch that fury. Uh, I'm working it. You're working it. I'll be working with what you're calling it. A, I'll have something to do with that fight. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:31:33       Great fight. Phenomenal fight. It's probably going to be, I don't know if they've announced it was in Vegas around November 11th. It's coming up. It's coming up. I would go to that. That sounds great. Fight. Great. Fight. Water's a great, yeah, I love him.

Yeah, there is a man who had his legs crushed. Did Not Miss Portside when he's gentlemen. Uh, you, no, here's what I didn't like them because he was screaming in agony and pain and then people kind of weren't helping him and it was prolonged. Like that was just a fast, here it is. This is the fuel, right?

Speaker 12:         01:36:42       No. See, watch. Oh my God. You sociopath.

Speaker 10:         01:36:52       It just goes on and on like it's too long. It's too depressing

Speaker 12:         01:37:00       us guys. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:37:02       And it goes on and it's too long. I feel like, oh my God, please helping it. I feel like he's okay though. He is. Yeah, he's fine. He doesn't give a shit. No, he never told Asians. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:37:23       By the way. We had an update a week ago or two weeks ago that I'm from a Taiwanese breast where this happened that said that, um, he just had bruises. He wasn't even there. How does he know that? We read it on the shift. I know, but now in retrospect, because it was in the news, they're like, he was like, ah, and like looked in wade, but he's kind of cool and apparently he was just saying because we were always like, what does he say? We don't know. He's saying he was saying stuck could the equivalent of stuck stock. You don't say that if you die. Yeah, I know that they snap. No, if you're dying, you just go, you know why I liked the electrocution wine? Oh, tell me. Because that one's just like a cartoon beat. Like it's a fat. It's, it's quick. You don't see his face. It's a good quick punchline. That one, I get to know that dude. You know what I'm saying? Oh my God, this guy hit the ground. Yeah, I don't like this. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         01:38:18       Better do something.

Speaker 11:         01:38:21       I would never do this ever. Pros, cons.

Speaker 13:         01:38:25       I've done it.

Speaker 11:         01:38:31       That one is way was pretty happy. It's Hilarious, but that's the way it sounds like he blew out his knees. It's that super funny to my husband. That's pretty funny. I don't know why. It's funny. See, I don't know why. If I as I know he's okay. It's funny. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:38:57       The thing is you can't control it going to get hurt. There's no way to be tough about it. Yeah, no. It was the most horrific injury you've had. I've been fortunate, man. I haven't, you know, I mean her mom freak when she saw you doing this stuff. Uh, yeah. My Dad like wouldn't sleep at night and stuff. I can't imagine my son fighting. I can't imagine. I know I didn't ever had, he goes too crazy. He was crazy. You know that one time when I was, when I was in high school playing ball, it was like one of those weeks where my dad was out of town. So my, my mom doesn't know anything about football. Like she would watch entire games and be like, oh, I was watching the other guy like that. You know? It doesn't know, but a game like one of the only games she went to alone just to be supportive.

Speaker 11:         01:39:41       You balled out? No, I went to an ambulance, took me to the hospital. Damn. What happened on a punt coverage, like as the whistle blew and like, you know you're running full speed. Yeah. And then you're, you're slowing down, right? Like you're slowing your sprint down. One of the, a guy took out my legs and I went up into the air and landed on my tailbone. Damn. Broke the tailbone. I didn't break it but they didn't know what was wrong cause I was like, oh, when you land on it, yeah. You never know. Paralyzed and they realize he's going to hospital. Did you, did you have aspirations of playing college or Pro Green guys? I didn't know how like much I didn't know. You know what I mean? Ignorance is bliss. It is. I was like, oh man. Like I'll probably play it like Auburn or something. I really did. I had no idea. I'll probably, it's probably come down Florida state. I'll improvement. Yeah. I mean I really thought that. I'm not kidding. That's how everyone is though, I guess. I mean, I've told this story before the the time that I didn't like, because the thing is when you're in high school it's such a different game because of the like you can make plays all the time be like, I mean I'm good. Right? Yeah. Yeah. And so when I, when I,

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       I thought I'm a decent player. I mean I knew it was above average. I did, but I didn't know the difference between an above average and elite. And even though there was guys on my team that were elite and I was just like, you know, you kind of are in denial about it. It's like being in denial but anything you're like, well I beat him in this, this, this. It's like you see the say I see the same denial tree doing standup. Like sometimes you're like, I don't know why this person is still doing this after like 50 yeah, yeah. Within, they still do it.

Speaker 9:          01:41:18       But I do like, I feel like a, I don't mean to interrupt you. I feel like in stand up it's very black and white and you're like, well, you're not getting laughs though man. You're not selling tickets on the road.

Speaker 3:          01:41:28       The other thing too, I always measured this in stand up where it was like year one and then I was like, is your, when I got to year two I was like, am I better at stand up and I'm working more, I'm getting more work. And that's how I would measure it. I'd be like, man, you know, I was, I was emceeing and now featuring. So like I'm definitely making progress and all I ever wanted to see was progress and, and then you know, you, you can start to measure the quality of what you're doing. And there's definitely a lot of people that are delusional in, in all entertainment, singing, acting, you know, but a standup, you can kind of see it, you're like, you're making zero progress after 10 years. And sometimes people just, you know, they did

Speaker 9:          01:42:08       standup, you can chill a lot longer, but you cannot do to took Kevin Hart 15 years. Yeah, yeah. I guess. Yeah. But in football it's like, no, no schools, no school on. She played for the team. Now I'm very black and white. I, you know, I had like, I got like the d two and d three recruit letter

Speaker 3:          01:42:24       and I had a couple of clicks. Yeah, yeah, sure. These are people that don't know that I probably have. I'm still in it for a million years. I never knew that they send you, they send you form letters though. So they're like, are, we were impressed with how strong you are on the grid iron and in the classroom and like, my grades are terrible. It's like a form letter, but it's, yeah, it's kind of thrilling. You Open it, you know, and you're like, it's kind of cool. So I would get some of these, but I was like, I want to go to holy cross, man. I'm going to go to fucking, you know, Florida. My hold out to Mitch and when exactly. And when I went on, I went on a trip with a guy in my team who was a legit baller and we went on the field to watch Syracuse play Miami at Miami. And when those guys came out of the tunnel and they were standing next to me pregame, I was like, there was a no, I don't look like these guys. Like I would die on the scout team here. I would die. I mean it hit me that, that it was my level of delusion went away in an instant. I was a junior in high school, so it was a good thing to recognize.

Speaker 9:          01:43:28       It shows your smarts though. You're intelligent level. Cause a lot of guys, there's a lot of guys who even, they see that and they go I can still do it. Then somehow they walked on where they're just scout team guys and you're like, dude, you're never going to play. And they're going to put you through the wringer. Like dude, Rudy did it. And like when he had one fucking play five years, they Linde play one play when he's off sides. You know what I'm saying? Like this

Speaker 11:         01:43:52       doesn't, hmm. I would have been massacred. I mean I probably, if I was one of those, because there's these psycho guys that love the game so much that they'll like, I'll suffer no matter what. Cause I love this game and I'm definitely not that person. But there's guys like done stand up too. That's true. That's got a bomb 5,000 tons so we can call yourself a comedian or you just suck it, calm it better. I'm like, no, that's not true. I know some of the great say that I don't agree with it. I think if you bombing, if you're bombing that much out of a thousand times, you don't have any bits of anyone. Last night and we all, we all bomb if you bomb all the time.

Speaker 11:         01:44:30       Me and Bert were talking, I think it was on his podcast. He goes, yeah. He goes, yeah, me and Tom realize that you're really going to do this comedy thing cause we at the store in the back and you were bombing and I was like, what? And he goes and then we came back and you're like, oh God. That was like, yeah, shit happens man. We did. We said that it's a bird said he's just an exaggerated, I'm sure it was a rough night though. They're this rough nights, man. There are rough nights. Of course you should have rough nights. Hell yeah. If you're like, I've had great shows, that means you've done stamp like eight times all going shows. Shows. Yeah. But you also shouldn't be bombing every single on the true, that's for sure do. Yeah, that's true, man. No, it is crap. I mean, you played at that elite level. I mean, I definitely would have died. I would didn't, they would've have, you know the, I could have been that kid who's like, I could be a scout team full back or something. Some guy, just a battery last me. Yeah. They're just like, oh, we gotta get you neck surgery this off. Thanks for your, and then I'm just like, I just love the team so much. And like they, they just put it for the team.

Speaker 11:         01:45:31       I'm like, ah, I'm not gonna be able to look left or right for the rest of my life. This is the benefit. I have with my kids is a, I've been at the high level in multiple sports. I'm like homeboy and prying freshman in high school. I'm like, dude, we got to pick a different lane. This, you're not getting it right away if the aptitude is there. Yeah, pretty. Pretty close. Yeah. Yeah. You can write. I remember a guy, a coach come in and he was like, you, uh, he was like, you guys, just all you all should worry about is your speed. So just working on your speed and like, what if you already fast?

Speaker 11:         01:46:05       He was like, yeah, you too man. Got that check. What else? What else man? What else? From the short while? What else you got Doug? You try to put on weight. He was like, yeah, it's going pretty well. So anything else? I was like, so I got it. I'm fast. I'm meeting. Yeah. No, those people are different, man. They're totally different. Yeah. Yeah. Sick of innate. What, what a good segue from sports or what other shows you guys watch though? Oh, Bravo. What about Netflix? Yeah, we'd definitely, where he fucks with El Chapo. He does. He loves it. Oh you speak Spanish. Of course. I'm almost done. I'm almost done. I'm in season three episode 11 or 12 come on 12 it's really

Speaker 9:          01:46:50       good. The whole, the series is great. Brilliant. And I was talking about, I was talking, I was putting out the doubt when, when I was pressing play originally I was like look, not to talk about of Shit, but a lot of these Latin American productions are whack. Like when you watch, you know a show that airs on Telemundo or some shit like man this is, this is not the same. That show the writing, the directing, the cinematography, everything is tremendous on it. Do you ever go back and you can, they'll show some of it but you can go back and watch like major scenes and El Chapo, his life where he got arrested or when he escaped from prison and you watch when they recreate it and it is fucking spot out. Small details to everything. I wonder how much, I mean you can tell it, you know what parts are 100% true.

Speaker 9:          01:47:34       I wonder like if, how much of that of like other characters and exaggeration or completely made like the [inaudible] character, it's like, which one's the, you know, the secretary of state, the gay guy. I mean he's, he was gay, you know, who knows what he's doing that side piece and if you'd like to get that, but is that based on a real guy? That's a real guy. That definitely is 100%. Okay. 100%. Yeah. My girls Mexican as fuck. And I asked her, I'm like, Calvert legitimate. She's like pretty legit. And she'll bring me like the actual, I never looked it up. Yeah. We, I get balls deep. Yeah. I love that guy. That plays, they'll Chapo. He's excellent. Here's my thing, what's the, what is this humble we going to do? He's like the girl on those Frickin, you know, on those, uh, the insurance ads.

Speaker 9:          01:48:19       Oh, right. Well, I don't know though, because like why don't see, he's going to be cap type, type it up a chameleon because when he, when he's El Chapo, um, you know, like breaking in to the business and then when he's, uh, when they fast forward to the New York with his head shakes the same at all of us. I think it looks all Chapo. That's it. I think he's screwed. Rowe. I think he's pretty good. No about hiring him for my pocket. Some shit I think screwed dude. What's our, oh, we're going to get back into Ozarks, which just came down and I watched the first two. I couldn't get into it. No Shit. No really? But I'm also a guy, took seven years, get on with game of Thrones. [inaudible] tried twice. I can't, and that was strange. I couldn't either. And then I was denying what happened.

Speaker 9:          01:49:04       How did you get into it? I don't know. I would need a show. I was born, I was like, let me check this shit out. Oh, I was on a plane with the, the writers, the creators of it. I was on a plane and I thought they were on there from always sunny in Philadelphia and then went yep, we're, yeah, we're shooting in, uh, and uh, Ireland this year I went Ireland, Jesus always sunny in Philadelphia. You guys really went Hollywood. He goes bring it all the way to Ireland and then the, it's a private plane, just go sign. They go and we do game of Thrones, man. Oh Shit. And I started talking to them and they were just fascinating dudes. I'm like, yeah, you give it a shot. And then it was damn good. Damn good. I saw, I know it's good. I think it was the pilot and I was like, man, drag. And if I am watching this shit time, I was bro. Yeah. I like his Lord of the

Speaker 11:         01:49:48       one. I know there's people rolling their eyes right now being like, Tom, you fuck dude, I was the same bro. Here's another thing. I've never seen sopranos. Now that's my jam right there. I love that. Fun. I've watched the whole series twice. Not the whole thing. How you got to watch it. And so I've never seen any love it. No, I don't love it. But I, I recognized like it is definitely quality. I mean I just, I never fully embraced, I'm not that fond of Italians. So like I just, you know, again, your nerves, I just think they have so much misguided pride. They kind of just turned me off, you know? That's fair. Yeah. Huh. Like you dad said love it. Do you watch approaches of Europe? Oh, aggressive. Totally kidding. Awesome. That's hilarious.

Speaker 11:         01:50:38       Things like you'd never think of like Italians know like the cockroaches of Europe. I haven't her. Wow. Wow. See, I'll watch words. I'll watch like born this way on Tlc. You seen that? The kids with down syndrome. Oh Gee. You watch that. Why it's, I don't know. It's interesting. It's like a bunch of kids with down, when I say kids so you don't realize how old their somewhere like 40 45 in the first place. The kids now they're grown US folks. And this is born this way. My 90 Day fiance. Oh yeah, no, we fuck with that. We, uh, we fuck with a transition. We just transitioned. TLC was amazing. Which one? Which one is lessened? Oh, hold up. It's like when you, right before you would go Ryan. Charles Schwab. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a really about homeboy who was just married with a girl baby.

Speaker 11:         01:51:27       I was like, Yo, baby girl. And he's like, it's like if I shaved and I was like, I'm gonna just put on a dress. It was like, I feel like a woman. And then they go to their friends by go, Dave is now Dana. And I'm like, how come? How come people keep looking like saying that I'm a guy, they'd be at the nail salon. Yeah, he's fucking, he's like you dude. The dress long nails and then upset about it. Yeah. He's like, people are saying it was that guy. He's like the fuck, you know? And I was like, this is so annoying. And also it's like, I mean, I feel like, you know, he, he went to get that surgery consultation and they're like, you know, we can do this to your eyebrows and your face and all that stuff. Also, it's like, Bro, you could take the Diet little seriously.

Speaker 11:         01:52:12       That wouldn't kill either, bro. Like I would do the Diet first. That's what I'm saying. Just from there, it's like, he's like, he's like, everybody's like, you look like a dude. So it's like, you know, but man, like c'mon dude. I mean I go for a morning run every morning or just eating crew tons and water. Dude, that dude, I was in Spokane, Washington doing shows. It's taking an Uber like in the Uber and it's like, I'm like, damn, that's the biggest girl I've ever seen. I don't give a fuck. It's this little shitty Honda, but it is, wreck it Ralph and this Honda fucking shoulders dress

Speaker 9:          01:52:46       big on. I'm like, damn, her shoulders are bigger than mine, son. I get in and turns around and it's like, this fucking, you know me with a wig on. But it just turned around. I was like, she looked like bill Bellacheck with a wig. I feel like when he transitioned and it was new, it was not a good, it's never good, but it's like, you know, in his or her arms are like, you tell like a little hairy. It's just like you got to try harder and harder, but then there's also limited. They're not even being cool at the gun store. To me. Yeah, of course. Makeup on. It doesn't mean like, oh, it's a check. Like there's some steps you gotta go nippy. Amazing. It was like, I'm transitioning. And then they're like, how's your transition going? He, he handled it the same way that he does football questions. He'd be like, it's fine. It's fine. We're playing the chiefs this week. It's fun.

Speaker 9:          01:53:40       We've had him on the show. I mean the clips on the, we had him on a lot of personality now. Terrible show. That would be a terrible show. Maybe that would be the show. How terrible can you imagine if I was gonna say, Gee, imagine how heartbreaking and be, you know, you guys have two kids. I'm not saying I'm against it. All I'm saying is if my son, when he's 14, was like, dad, I feel like a girl, man. I'm a start rocking dresses, no more football. And it's not like, like, oh, this is terrible. Get Out of my house. But it'd take a hot second to accept it. I'm not sure. Like Bro, it's fuck am I right? Suck that doors. I'm like, gimme a Humean you me the night. Let me sit on this. Yeah, no, I'm going to be cool though. Is your son, he's going to be huge.

Well, have you ever, uh, we had her on our show, Christina back, Kristen Beck. Kristin Beck. Ready for this one. So she was, he previously was a male when the top, uh, navy seals in the world. Oh, I've heard of that transition and do, I'm a woman. I've heard, I've read about this in the news, straight up Badass navy seal. What always felt like a woman. And then one of her, you know, Navy seals, he was like, hey, this way he told him he was a Katelyn have drinks on my boat. And he's like, yeah, I'll come over. You just always come over. And he left his dress on and he just said his friend came over who was also a CEO.

Speaker 9:          01:55:14       It was like, all right, it's cool man. If that's what you like, don't let the other guys find out about it though. Like just do your shit. But dude on the side, man, it's crazy. And then now, and we went out to, went out to lunch after with her and again it, it's a fucking navy seal, man. It looks like and put lipstick on Mascara.
