Me The guy that and um, yeah, so I have the wrong sized shirt but um, and then some people have been messaging me that the orders are shirt. Where is it? Well if you'll look, the sub came shirt is a presale meaning that it's going to ship later and it says that on the order page, but they are going to ship next week. So we brought it back because we, first time we did it we sold out of everything super fast. We brought it back and it's on sale now and they will ship next week.

Speaker 3:          00:07:16       You did that and it's like payback for our stupid neighbor who yells, oh my God. All the time. So loud. She's the worse I should tell him that. That the cane story is true. When I see that guy. Yes. Cause he asked me and I was like, I was delirious. I'm like, wait, what? Sunset Boulevard at the comedy store is where it happened to. Yeah. And I did limousine and then he turned away. Let's amazed. But then you've also perfected your black yelling. I'm working on it a lot, but the very first time we did it was like near Fairfax, wasn't it? Oh, I did it with you and, and you're like, what's that mean? And the guy yelled back. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That was fucking amazing. I remember I was just the beginning of all of this. That was the beginning. Yeah. Like go check this out years ago and I yelled at the guy and he was like, y'all back and then you almost had an aneurysm laughing.

Speaker 3:          00:08:08       So great. Yeah, we started doing that and that was the same year we started like when we pull into a stoplight and there was somebody, a pedestrian standing there and you fart in the car member and I was and I would yell at my husband farmed it and then they'd be like, what? That's a fun game. One time I was called up to a guy with you in the car. I pulled up to a couple, which is kind of scary. It was at night and I hit the brakes when they were walking down the street and I go, I farted and then I hit the gas and they were totally, that was fun to do. My favorite moment with you ever in my life and the last 1547 years we've been together. Remember that time we were eating brunch and you ask the bus boy in Spanish you go, he just said, I have to shit, where's the bathroom?

Speaker 3:          00:08:53       Yes. It say it. Say it in Mexican. I said, a mic, go look at it. Can just point it. He didn't even blink. Of course not because I was normal to him. Says I got to shit. Where's the battery? Mikaila. I didn't even blank dude. Like that guy was awesome. I actually, the time that we first yelled my black Ya'll on Fairfax, I actually was recording the guy that responded back. So I yelled and then he went, yeah, that's from, that's from Fairfax. I didn't remember him. The phrase. Yeah, that was good. Yeah. That was the funny, yeah, that was seriously, that was so funny. We were just in the car, right. And we were rolling up on it and you're like,

Speaker 2:          00:09:37       it was,

Speaker 3:          00:09:41       why is years old

Speaker 3:          00:09:52       by the way? Um, why are you wearing my shirt right now? Ah, what you're wearing my sweatshirt. I don't know. It fits me perfectly like a glove. I think it looks better on me. Let me tell you, I wore that on the flight to Salt Lake City and the flight back from Salt Lake City. Let's get a look at what I'm wearing. It is a real talking point. Um, so I just want you to see what you look like when you were that good. Look at what you've been wearing. That's why I put it on today so you can feel the experience that I've been having. You know, I just feel there's so many different things that happened with that sweatshirt on. First of all worse. Uh, so Doug Mellard and I went to Salt Lake City and he was like, wow. And then I told him how you said your, your take was that I looked like a, the retarded guy that goes to the library every day and everyone's like, Hey Kevin, are you teach special ed?

Speaker 3:          00:10:52       So when I was on the plane, um, first of all, people would board and I could, I would see them go like, yeah, of course. Crazy. You know, one of the flight attendants came over and talked to me like I was super special and I realized that I almost sounded special back because I was actually putting together, I, I've almost confused why I got it. You know what I mean? So I was trying to tell her, she goes, uh, she was, she was working, walking through the cart, the aisle with the cart, and she goes, so, um, I, those jelly fish on your sweatshirt. And I go, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:11:34       She goes, I've never seen that before. Where'd you get that? And I go, I had it made. And she goes, Oh, well why'd you do that? Yeah. And then I was confused. I didn't realize, I didn't remember that. It's actually, it was made first and then I go, oh, I want to get it in my mind. I was thinking of like my, my first special where I have a joke where I said I can't, he came through with jellyfish last week. It was the first 48 bit. So I didn't want to explain that I do comedy. So I just said, I talk about it. So then I got one and I was like, oh no, I actually sound retarded because I'm going, I talk about it and then I wanted it and she goes, that's a really nice, and she talked to me like I was really, really special.

Speaker 3:          00:12:18       Yeah. And then she goes, I go, I have another one with a raven on it. And then I pulled it up. I'm like, cause I like my phone was out and she goes, I'm listening. She was observing other people drinks and then I was like paging through my camera roll. I was like, this one is me raven on my sweatshirt. You show. Did you show her the other one too? No, I didn't show her the Hannibal one. Yeah, I showed her the raven. Can't tell you why I like you wearing the jellyfish and the rape. Yeah, go ahead. Because I know you're not cheating on me cause there's no woman in the world. It's going to lay you wearing the jellyfish. Why? Why do you say that? That's so embarrassing. So you see that you don't see it. You don't have any sexual feelings when you see negative. Yeah. So bad. Really bad. This is craziness. It's not crazy. It looks really crazy. Wait, you don't think any woman would be like, Whoa, what's up with him?

Speaker 3:          00:13:17       I think a normal woman would be like retarded stewardess had that reaction. Here's how she talked to me. I actually thought this later, like as the flight was progressing, it felt like somebody went, I dare you to ask the guy that retarded guy about his course. And then of course, and then she won like 20 bucks for talking to me. She was like, oh my God. He just said he talks about them. She felt good about herself that day. Like you know when like confident, right. She was like, I, I did a good deed by talking to that. Real Nice for target boy that's the economy. Yeah. See she's like, I'm a good person. I talked to Ricardo people like they're one of us. It would have been so she was doing, man, I wish I was in first because then they would have been like, I just the target.

Speaker 3:          00:14:08       Wow. He has make a wish, but they would have just thought that you were like an eccentric millionaire. If you're in first class, now you're just the eccentric guy with the jellyfish. Somebody posted when I, cause I posted a picture of me in that sweatshirt. They said, this is how I imagine like the, the seat, the guy that the startup CEO who runs some tech company dresses like some guy with money. He was like, fuck it. When a jellyfish, I'm worried. Joy for sure. And I laughed so hard because I could, I could see that the guy, the guy who was like, I have $1 billion, I'm going to wear a jellyfish. They're retarded or fucking money, right. Of which I'm neither, I'm not retarded and I don't have fuck you and fuck getting pussy. Yeah. So I'm super stoked about that. Is this a of yours? What? Are you worried about that? No, not really. No, not really. No. Oh my God. I said, fuck you man. Fuck you. By the way, can I just point out that you were hacking coughing last week and you cough like a old black guy? No, I don't use awfully good old homeless black man.

Speaker 3:          00:15:15       So gross. Yeah. That's who you cough. Like, okay. No, no. You Go, you go, Huh? What is black about that? So gross. Nothing is black. That's all black dudes cough. And you were going to a black guy in the bus cough. Oh Man. So I closed it. And that's a black guy. Yeah. Well I'm not a man. So my what do it do your coffee now do it for real. That let the audience hear how regular I cough. No cough. Like you go do it now. That's not how you kept at home. I don't know how to mimic how I caught for real cough. No, that's not what you were doing. You're so gross. Cause you do it in a two step process. Like you bring up the phlegm and then you work it out. Okay. I don't know how you go and you're right. You hear that you're like, oh this black guy right there.

Speaker 3:          00:16:07       Yeah, I'm living, it's like living with Redd Fox. We're living in the junk yard and Lamont, c'mon, c'mon at Margate. Yeah. There you go. Cough like that. That's exactly what you sound like when you call. You're ridiculous. You're ridiculous. Yeah. Red Fox. Yeah though is do you like the Ma? It's sad circumstances, but that, that 11 year old girl sang country twice on like the today show or good black America, it's the bad. Then don't ask her to say what, don't ask, don't ask her to repeat it. I love the power. She goes, Oh yeah, we just got to be careful. It's okay, Sweetie.

Speaker 5:          00:16:48       Which ones did you say?

Speaker 3:          00:16:50       Well, it's actually a horrible story, right? It's about, obviously it's another funny, funny premise for a cloud. It's like, thanks. Some bullying went on and something horrible happened. I don't know if someone kill themselves or kill somebody else and they're asking her like, what? Well, you know what she saw? So she started saying, well, I saw these tech. Which text messages did you see?

Speaker 5:          00:17:08       She'll costs Mra best and she calls him a pipe. I mean, he calls her client. Okay. Okay. Careful with our language or above it. That's all right sweetheart. Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:17:20       well that's okay then. Don't ask her to, I can't say so. I can't say cut. I was talking to said, oh, I can't say, can't you dumb bitch. Uh, um, um, um, oh God never said that word. Oh my God. Oh my God. What was it? Literally like it. Good morning show. Yeah, it was a morning show. Yeah. One of them aware. Um, give him morning. Who can watch those fucking dumb shows anyways, but what the fuck is watching? Good morning. Anything. Have you tried watching those piece of shit morning show. We do them for a living. Well, they're just so here's a, every everyone's emotions are side phony on it. Yes. The phoniness. Yeah. You know that they're this painful. I show up usually in a bad mood at those things of course. And when they're like, I thought went really funny. It's going to be in town.

Speaker 3:          00:18:08       The same stupid energy. Now let's switch gears. A very funny man is in town is going to be at the mall, at the club in the mall. Uh, it's always a football club that has the relationship there. And then they go, Tom, how's it going? And then they wouldn't get it. Or you can do your thing when once we go to, uh, my thing, what do you think I'm going to do? And they're like, just turn it on. Yeah. Watch any morning show clip I'm on. Hi. Well, my favorite is they're always surprised that you're tired. Yeah. You're like, Whoa, what's up? Sleepy head. And you're like, well first of all it's six, seven, eight, but it's three in the morning, my time. Right. You asshole. Yeah, you're not. You're the one that's weird right now. Why do they do that? Why do they make the morning shows extra upbeat? Like don't you prefer to listen to someone that's at your speed? Like what? They should have more like us. Like, hey guys, it's sucks. I'm awake. Fucking hate it. I bet you hate it. Being awake right now to uh, anyways, here's the news like,

Speaker 1:          00:19:06       yeah, and they should be like, you know what's better? Uh, today's already. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:19:09       Bad Day. Yeah. I'm sure life sucks. You're watching the show. You're probably depressed. I just want to tell you is a validating your depression sucks out there. Exactly. Let's go to the weather. Don't bother getting out of bed today. And then the guys like snowing. Why this sucks too. And they cut back what happened in sports. Our teams loss.

Speaker 1:          00:19:31       All right.

Speaker 3:          00:19:33       That's a good morning show. I could get into, oh my goodness. It's crazy. Um, yesterday was the pooper bowl. Um, crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:19:50       I gotta tell you, I know you don't listen or care about football. I'll just say this, uh, with regard to football stuff. Yeah. Oh, um, yeah. I was surprised at what happened. Uh, I tried to pick it just as a, a fan of the game and uh, try to be objective. Totally thought it was going to go the other way. Um, so I know you don't understand what I'm saying and I'll, I'll jump out of this, but I just wanted to say congratulations to the people of Denver. Um, and uh, and really what an unbelievable

Speaker 3:          00:20:25       showing because there was incredible. I think I just caught the very beginning of it and I didn't realize that, um, it's so patriotic. I had no idea that America goes the fuck off. They go off. I mean, we had the, we had lady Gaga singing the anthem. She was crying, there was a tear going. I swear to God. Really? The camera got closer. There was a tear down her eyes. And then the blue angels go overhead and then they can't, they cut to Afghanistan or there soldiers standing in Afghanistan and the minute Afghanistan soldiers are on screen and everybody's cheer. I missed all that. I was out. Did they have the flag on the field? Sometimes the horse a hundred foot flat. I didn't, I've never watched the opening. Yeah, it sounds like it's team America. Oh Wow. Yeah. I was like, is this a joke? Yeah. Or the puppet's going to come out from fucking team. Yeah. Really crazy man. Trey Parker. Gonna and that's done. It's pretty crazy. It was a law. I had no clue. America hinged on the Super Bowl as much. Yeah. It's our biggest commercial product I think is wow. Yeah. Oh Jeez. Isn't that John and I were up polo jeans. Oh, this time. Isn't that crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:21:43       Um, so we're all following the people that organize the Superbowl thought what better way to get things started then bringing in seal. You want me bringing up seal the other day you did. It was kind of weird. It's like he had a premonition. I mean, we were in the, in the kitchen and I go, yeah, we think seals up to, I know I just started saying like, do you mean, can you imagine? Like I go, I think you'd probably just still it still towards Europe and like Eastern Europe. Let's be clear. Not Western central. First of all. I mean he had like a few really huge songs. Well, okay, so he has the crazy song. Yeah. Well what's his other from a rose. Alright. My, my roses kissing new jeans. That's the one right there. Kissing jeans though with the road song. Um, so it's so weird.

Speaker 3:          00:22:34       We're sitting and talking about them and I was remembering that he was married to Heidi Clunes hide the, um, high tech. What do you think her asshole tastes like? Oh Man. There's without a doubt you get in that ass and it's 100%. It's a German asshole. So, uh, so we're talking about, and actually I was telling you that like, you know, it's one of those things, hey, it's, this is a tough entertainment is a tough business, you know, and the man can fucking sing like those songs are, or were hits for a reason, right? Like, yeah. So you'll have some, he can build out some notes. Yeah. So we were just talking about, I go, I wonder what, you know what, even if he does, he just stole a tour Eastern Europe. I'm sure actually any, I'm sure western Europe too, that he, if he goes, I am coming to Barcelona.

Speaker 3:          00:23:21       That shit sold out immediately. Yeah. Barcelona. Yeah, for sure. Paris. Sure. Yeah. Rome. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's still, I think he's still is a draw. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So um, Iceland huge, big, big in Iceland. Right. But anyways, we're sitting there and then the pregames on it, you know, you put the, when it was on CBS, I forget what was done and you go, I'm just going to, you know, let it run up to the game and I turn to the TV during the pregame show and there's seal and I'm like, and then there's the huge audience outside. I'm like, what a bizarre, just selection. Yeah. Cause he kind of has it been in the public at least I haven't heard from him since the crazy song came out. What was that in 1992? It's been awhile. It's been a minute. Yeah. Um, and it's just also weird.

Speaker 3:          00:24:07       I Dunno, you think of football, it's such a huge commercial product. I always think that the more appropriate acts are basically whatever's the most popular, you know, like it makes sense and tits. It makes sense that Beyonce and her big tits are out. Yeah. It makes sense that lady Gaga, good, good guy. Is there, um, I don't know. Whoever is they booked, like Kendrick Lamar, if they book, you know, they, if they had Drake, anybody who's like really relevant in them. Absolutely. In the moment. Um, I mean even band wise, like they had cold play this year. It's great because I thought that was odd. Aren't they like a Downer band like Radiohead, but more ma, you know, like they're more mainstream for sure. So it's like a white bummers they're kind of wipe bummers but I mean it's still, I guess it makes sense, but I dunno, it just, it's always interesting, like you're always like, what, why did they select these people to do so anyways, but seal was just more than bizarre, but was more bizarre than the choice was the first half of him singing because I dunno what the fuck was going on.

Speaker 3:          00:25:14       I don't know if he was just like, oh, what, I'm doing one today? And they go, no, you're singing at the super bowl. Yeah. Um, well, cause we were sitting on the couch and looking at each other like, wait, is this really fucking happening? Is He, does this sound bad to you too? Yep. The brothers were like in my arm for my cause. I Dunno, it's just audio cause this fantastic. But I think it does in the beginning. So it was like the first 30 seconds minute, he was just like, isn't that crazy? And then all of a sudden I was like, this is really horrific. And then he decided to sing. It was like at one moment he goes, all right, I'll sing now. But even the singing was off. It was a little, it was off, but the first part. But see I didn't get it

Speaker 4:          00:25:57       the very first. Sorry, this is it. This is all the gowns.

Speaker 2:          00:26:01       No,

Speaker 3:          00:26:01       the first part at all. No, but it's a little bit of it. You can hear it.

Speaker 2:          00:26:06       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:26:18       Exactly. Singing now he's seen. Yeah, now he's singing. Yeah. Yeah. You don't get, you didn't get the other thing. I couldn't find the, sorry.

Speaker 3:          00:26:34       Well he was finally warming up. You ramped up to that shit. Sorry. Genes positive. We pause it. Try to find it. Hold on. All right, well we added, okay. Um, anyway, I interviewed him afterwards.

Speaker 7:          00:26:54       [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          00:26:58       it's so different to only in as much as like you have the people that come are necessarily there to see you. They're not necessarily your fans, you know, because they had to see a group of entertain a little steam and CNN. So, um, yeah, I guess that's different. But you know, I, I've always lived by that philosophy, um, for not always, but at least for the last 20 years I've lived by the philosophy of like, there are no bad oars audiences, only mediocre performances.

Speaker 3:          00:27:25       Well that was a pretty mediocre one yesterday, man. Not true that the audience was very mediocre for him too. They pan to the crowd on there. They were horrible living around, but he was at dog shows. Terrible. Yeah. For the first, I wish I had the audio. Yeah. Basically if you a, if you saw it, you know, but if you didn't, we'll, we'll try to find that over the next week maybe. But he basically, for the first, for the first minute of her son goes, isn't that crazy? It's crazy. And then I really felt like somebody goes, you need to sing. And then he's saying, yeah, but it was a minute of, I'm not singing the song. I feel like they've always said crazy too much in that song. But that really bothered me in a world full of only some know how to fly. Isn't that crazy? It's crazy. Never going to on this. We are a little crazy. Like all right. Pick a different word is yeah, there's a lot of other words. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot that's is a lot that, that uh, that song was huge man. I know. Super annoying after a while. They do that everywhere. Yeah. That was one of those songs. That's a song where this guy couldn't can tour what I'm saying for the rest of his life, you know? Yeah. It's like, it's never going to give by boy les.

Speaker 9:          00:28:42       Cause your dad would like the song. My Dad loves this car. My Dad was to the dad. Is this a dad's on total debt? Why is it a dad that's feel cool for liking it? Right. Cause it's not a cool, but it's kind of cool. This part, this part, yeah. This is like at Dad. Dj made. Yeah. Alright. I've got my white sneakers on. Right. And uh, feels like approachable. Cool. Yeah. You know, not, not like so cool.

Speaker 3:          00:29:12       Yeah. You feel like you could be like, hey seal. Yeah. I didn't realize he used to have hair. He did. Yeah. I didn't know that. It's a good song. Now. It doesn't look approachable. Cool. And this never mind. No, no, it's way too. But I mean, he's got like leather,

Speaker 9:          00:29:31       best time the chain. Yeah. This is such a dad, you know, my dad used to do is get songs he

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       likes like this, but get the single and let it just play. Repeat in was car man. That's annoying. Over and over and over and over. And he like, I like it. And then it's all you would hear in the car with him. And this is on of his jams. Oh yeah. Yeah. I wish we can make an album of top dog jams. Oh, I could, I could cry now. I'm trying to think right now of the, of one that I'm thinking of. It's another, it's a dad song like this that was, you know, rhythmic like this. I can't remember the name of it. That was in his car for maybe like a year and a half or two years. And he had Beyonce as great as I remember that. That took me by surprise that he liked Beyonce that much. I didn't know clue. Well, the only thing for the first, you know, 15 years of my life only had mo town.

Speaker 3:          00:30:29       So that's really good taste. It's really good taste. Yes. I think what happened is he tried to, he tried to find what's modern Motown and modern Motown is like, you know, well yeah, it's R and B, you know, so he just, but he has to find, he had to find songs that probably were at kind of simple chorus, simple beats that, you know, like the melody was catchy to him. The more complicated songs, I think he goes like, Oh, dad's don't like that. You know, my dad got into in the 90s she was really shocking. Do you remember the band prodigy? I'm not Firestar top. My Dad loved that song and he would just crank it in the house and my step mom will be like, like just hated it. And he would just get ripped and jam out to prodigy. He's like, this is a good song. You know this bum prodigy. Yeah, that's dad. Everybody knows them. Your Dad jams out to classic rock to he loves the stones. The Beatles. My Dad would not be grilling. Not even a little bit. That's like everybody likes to stone is going to be not top dog. And I mean not only doesn't like would be adamant about how much she doesn't like one of those things regionally. Fuck what you like. Wow. Yeah. Well those are counterculture. And he was, it was not counterculture and yeah, he went to Vietnam voluntarily. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:31:54       Get that all the time. No, no. My Dad hates the Beatles hates Elvis. That's, that's crazy. Probably hates every band that performed at Woodstock. Um, without places like fun or free love. No, it does not do drugs and sex. Like everybody. Like you like sex. I think he like sex drugs. No, no, no, no. The sex and drugs. And rock and roll for top dog. And I know it's just sex and Mcdonald's. Yeah, yeah, yes. Sex and Mcdonald's. Coffee, coffee, the best coffee in the world. The best coffee in the world. Got Mcdonald's. I'm, I'm, it's, it's pretty nuts. Never ordered their coffee meeting once in my life. Like in an airport. It's pretty crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:32:46       So we may just know last week, you know the movement is

Speaker 3:          00:32:50       growing and don't say that phrase like that. So alarming. How much does this, this is like when you know you, you get what you asked for.

Speaker 3:          00:33:24       the team, Coco Youtube page puts your appearance. It all says, Hey Hitler. Like a thousand times it says, Hey Hitler. And then people are going, why do they reference Hitler with, what is it about him and Hitler and his jeans? Like it makes so little sense to and outside or that they're like, what's wrong with his jeans and why is he liking to Hitler? That's my favorite part of our show is how exclusionary it is. Oh yeah, no, it is the best why we're saying, Hey Hitler or the jeans. Like I love that. It makes no sense to people outside of the moms circle, but that's, that's why I shows off. You have to be, you have to fucking know. You gotta know man. You got to know software. Everybody,

We were talking and you said you think you'll talk to him? I didn't get to talk to him. We had dressing rooms next to each other, but he had a team with him. He had like, he had, you know, publicist and, and, you know, assistance. And it was a lot of people. It was, a lot of people are fancy. And, um, he also didn't hang out from my peer. He got up off the couch. He's like, I got to go. He's like, who? And then he got above, above.

Speaker 3:          00:36:34       I follow him on Instagram. I didn't realize that before you daily hone in. I forget. I, I must've been watching it. It's normal. He's super normal. Really? Yeah. It's like, here's me and my kid. Here's me, Josh Brolin. Wow. He seems pretty normal, dude. Wow. I did not. I did not expect that. You should say to him, Hey Hitler, let's be friends.

Speaker 1:          00:36:52       Hey Hitler. Um, so here's what's something I want to bring up about the Hay Hitler, and that is that some people in a FedEx sort of way are saying that they're hearing something else. They're like, they're saying, oh, I don't think she's saying, Hey Hitler. I think she's saying, hey ha hiller or hey, no, and you know, it's clearly Hitler to me. Blogging Cure. What I'm saying is that if that's what you're hearing there and you're, you're not hearing it. I asked, you know what? What do you here, here, this is another video of hers that she put out. What are you here? Here.

Speaker 10:         00:37:27       Okay. What?

Speaker 3:          00:37:52       I don't know. I, I could be happy birthday to you. Nicholas. Does it sound like Nicholas to me? No, I hear Nicholas.

Speaker 10:         00:38:02       Huh? Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:38:08       Nicholas? No, it sounds like she saying and then lips.

Speaker 1:          00:38:14       Big words.

Speaker 10:         00:38:20       Yeah. Nick Nicholas. Nicholas.

Speaker 3:          00:38:28       Oh, it just sounds, it sounds

Speaker 1:          00:38:31       egg. A really like a big word. What is going

Speaker 3:          00:38:35       on with this girl? A lot. There's demons. Bells, there's demons. There's a wizard, dork. Sighted people. Okay. All right. I'm like, when people sing like that, I don't know, man. It sounds very bizarre. Um, but she has a weird way of, of communicating. Let's say that. Let's say that. Um, yeah. Why don't you let us know what you hear because I hear Nicholas. Okay. Well you hear that. I hear something else. What do you hear? I hear big words like lips, big word. I hear a big word.

Speaker 11:         00:39:31       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:39:32       When is it big words. No, I want someone to make a remix of you saying it now. Songs and the, Oh, really? It's about, it's your turn. No,

Speaker 11:         00:39:53       no.

Speaker 3:          00:39:59       Colin is Nick Nicholas. Okay. Yeah, it's, it's really, it's really bizarre. I mean, so now we have two controversies for what she was saying because there are people who swear she was saying Hiller Hillary. It's Hitler. Yeah. She's, she's talking at all pillar. She got blesses a Nigga. Casey, this is what I'm talking. Why can't you finally get some heat on that? Okay, thank you. Yeah. Yeah. I think she is, but she is asking adults, Hitler for help. She is, that guy in Nathaniel's jerk helped me. Hitler blessing. Yeah. God is real and God blesses a Nigga. That was when you could not believe what I'm half ounce was saying. That's his name. It was really dumb. That is crazy talk. It was crazy Todd. Yeah, no god. God is real. God bless him. God would never call you a nigger.

Speaker 11:         00:41:15       I'm repeating. It's you like the news caster. You're like, what did the text message say? I'm telling you what the text message and then you're like, don't say God blesses a Nigga. You asked me what the text message and I'm sure you are.

Speaker 10:         00:41:36       No, that's wrong with this girl. That's a really loaded question cause it would take a long time. The answer.

Speaker 3:          00:41:56       You know what for once I'm not interested in the story, like I don't want to kind of don't want to know what's up Shane Lee's story. I feel like that's just let it go. Her eyes. There's a lot going on. Is it the 30 yard stare? Is that like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Something, something's wrong. So Nick, you're never going to say it all right. Yeah. Oh Man. Christina put genes, but genes keep a James King, the Queen, the queen of all stupid. So stupid. Yup. Hey, um, can we give a jeep key update? Who's got the keys to the jeep? Uh, man, I was, I was actually in a full panic about this lease is coming up and I go, man, we got to turn this key and I don't want to no man, you go, if you'll have one set of keys date, they hit you up for like 600 bucks for a set of keys.

Speaker 3:          00:43:19       They can hit you over that. Yes, God, it's not going to cost them that much, but they're going to hit you up for that. And that was a way to get a little more out of you. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? I don't fucking want to do that Shit, you know? No. So I'm really kind of like, I don't know where else to look. I'm looking in all the pockets and cause then we decided, because that's where we found them last time was pockets. So now we are convinced that it's in the park, be in the pocket shit. And then I pulled a bunch of clothes, decided to donate and now when I have to go through the bag of donation pockets, yeah. Not In there. Oh yeah. And then by the way, when I dropped off that donation, I opened the bag, the, and I went and I had them take out each article, check all the pockets a second time like that, that nervous way of doing it, you know, and you go, I look in there again and then couldn't find them in the way that says, Hey Hitler.

Speaker 3:          00:44:11       Yeah. Then I'm, uh, I dunno, I'm looking under the car seat, you know what I'm saying? I'm looking under a, you know, a floor mat. No, what I'm saying, I'm, I'm looking under the Christmas where the Christmas tree everywhere. I can't find it. So finally I call you. I go, you go, I'm going to find it. I have the dogs never in this house because I, I will say one of my great gifts is my ability to find anything. I agree. I can sniff it out. Yeah. Um, so, so you left the house and he put the heat on me. You're like, you have to find these, you have to find these. Yeah. So I look, I tore apart. I went through your backpack. You did. Oh, I want to throw everything. I went through everything and I just put my hand in there. Nope. I put my hand through everything.

Speaker 3:          00:44:59       And then finally I look in the kitchen by the oven on the floor and it's there just on the fucking floor. It's on the floor underneath. What were the keys usually hang when we hang them. And we never even looked at it and look like a couple of fucking rape ties. He didn't look where the keys actually. Hey cause we have a little hook. We're supposed to put them on with a dog leashes and we, and we didn't even look. So you know, someone tried to put them up, they fell down. Probably me. Yeah. And then I just ignore it like I always do. Yeah. So there you go. We got the jeep keys. So the saga is over guys. We have the keys. Thank the Lord that we have the keys. I'm really am thankful about that. Um, I have a dentist appointment next week. Wow. Wait, no dude, this week, tomorrow I go to the dentist. Uh, do you know what I think what? I think my mom mouth is beginning and I'm, I'm really nervous about it. I haven't been brushing or flossing as much.

Speaker 5:          00:45:57       Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:46:10       So tomorrow I go in for my cleaning. Hey Hitler and we'll see. I'm nervous. I have not been flossing as much or brushing nearly as much because of the baby does change. True. Matt was right. I know. Fuck. I know I'm going to, I'm preparing myself, but I'm going to wear, well, I'll get you the, it's during the cleaning. I'm going to listen to podcasts,

Speaker 1:          00:46:31       do it. It's a definitely a change where it, you should always do that at uh, at the dentist's office. Listen to, uh, you know, today was, it wasn't, here's an example. I got up. You are already in the nursery and I have morning mouth. I just woke up. Yeah. And you go, oh, well you hold the baby. Sure. Because you go to do something. I hold the baby and I realized I was sitting there with morning mouth. Yeah. No, I ended up afterwards going to brush my teeth. Right. But I can see how you know, you get distracted enough. Maybe you just send thrown up brushing or till like the afternoon. Yeah. You wait awhile. Oh, and that's how dad mouth and my mouth. Really?

Speaker 3:          00:47:09       Oh yeah. Cause hours fly by with that kid. Yeah. Just keeping it alive before you know it. You haven't showered. You haven't shipped yet. Yeah. You haven't brushed your teeth.

Speaker 1:          00:47:17       Uh, we have a dental, dental, a update from a listener from Joe. Um, he titles is subject line is dental truth. Hmm. He says hello mommies. I normally agree with most of your

Speaker 3:          00:47:29       opinions on the genes of life, but I got to say you ain't keeping it high and tight when it comes to your obsession with dental cleanings, flossing, etc. What brushing am and pm is key of course. But I fear that my mommy's had been brainwashed by the dental industrial complex. Perhaps I myself have been just been blessed with extraordinary teeth. I have not been to the dentist in 15 years. Oh my God. Am I chompers are doing great white, straight and no pain. Waste of money. Ps, Christina, wipe your filthy ass before getting in the south and the shower. What's wrong with you? Now? I have to agree with his ps, but disagree with the subject as a whole. I mean, you're actually recommending to people to go a decade or more without visiting a dentist. He doesn't know. He hasn't been to the dentist. He could have all kinds of problems. Well, he could have, you know, there's sometimes there's certain things with people that they're genetically just gifted with, you know? Yeah. I mean it could have blesses God bless people. Absolutely. So I blesses a Nicholas, you never know.

Speaker 1:          00:48:37       That's true. That's true. And it could be that. That's his blessing. His, he's got perfect teeth. Maybe,

Speaker 3:          00:48:43       but he doesn't know. He doesn't know how to go, Bro. There is the anomaly. He's right. But it's few and far between. Don't go see your tennis, Bro. C'Mon. Yeah. I don't think that's good advice

Speaker 1:          00:48:54       to just go, oh, you never need to do that. I mean, no, most, most people's teeth will disintegrate, fall apart. Things will, things will stop working the way they should because you're not entertaining. Need to get that cleaning. This guy might be one of those people that just doesn't need it, but for the most part, I dunno man. But it gets your life. Get your entire fucking life, get your live, get your ticket, your life.

Speaker 3:          00:49:26       Uh, speaking of pastor meeting, that's who that is. This is pastor man, right

Speaker 12:         00:49:32       frying a job. He said

Speaker 1:          00:49:36       in church and that was about people that were going to, they said they were voting for Obama. He's telling him, Hey John, so weird. So He's been in the news lately because the will, the APP, what does it at church in Harlem that he is the lead pastor of. It's um, it's apparently going to be auctioned off. Okay. Um, there's something going on with his, uh, you know, bills he's not paying up. So here's a little bit of him discussing this here. Okay, let's see.

Speaker 12:         00:50:17       To our enemies. I'd like to say enemies that, um, right now there are several groups, uh, and we've got an office at a controversial church in Harlem may go up for public auction. All right. Uh, the infamous, uh, the anti gay anti Obama passed the, uh, hadn't paid his bills. Uh, pastor man Niggas, oh, says his flock is being fleets where we are. Uh, all these Audis painting those, I'll beat all these news organizations are running up and down and talking about it. They're going to raise money to purchase our church at auction, and they're just having a field day out there and all kinds of stuff and being spread around and they're going to turn this church into a bath houses. They're going to turn into a, a homeless building for, uh, before the sodomites. It's mainly the sodomites. So sober minded people aren't doing it if they,

Speaker 1:          00:51:12       so the sodomites are, the sodomites are out to get him. Um, you know, they're, they're everywhere.

Speaker 12:         00:51:18       It's mainly the sodomites, the salt. More minded people aren't doing anything.

Speaker 1:          00:51:22       Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         00:51:24       The site, the sodomites, I was sick as hell.

Speaker 1:          00:51:27       So he's got a little, um, guest. They, he's got a hype hype woman next. Right, right. Uh Huh. So this part though is, is particularly, I'm entertaining. I think you really got to understand what he's saying here. So if you don't know the controversy behind this guy, now this is the guy that said that, um, that Starbucks has a semen in it, right? Remember that pregnant if you drink Starbucks lattes, really anti Obama, um, really anti Starbucks, which really bothered me because I'm a, you know, I'm a big Starbucks fan. I mean I'm, I'm drinking semen right now and it's delicious. And they fooled me. They got me. Um, cause I go and I pay for it regularly. Uh, he's really anti gay. I mean like to the, I dunno, whatever degree possible. Suspicious how anti gay he is. You know what I mean? A little, I really hate sucking cock. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         00:52:23       And if you're drinking Starbucks, watch out. If you're a woman, you might just get pregnant by drinking Starbucks because they've got some pretty potent. How Sleeman in that drink?

Speaker 1:          00:52:36       The fuck is he talking about? You can't get pregnant from drinking seamen. That's the only, that's the only flaw in your assessment of Starbucks semen is that it's hard to get pregnant from drinking it. Right. I had a, that's not what I heard you heard differently. I don't know if the earth is round and I don't know if that's the truth about all Starbucks. Well, um, so obviously, you know, some pretty controversial guy. And so since the House that the, the church, the building is up for auction, at least that's what the news is saying. Um, and he's so anti, you know, gay. Yeah. Time. Yeah. Uh, they're saying that some, that maybe some gay organizations are trying to raise the money to turn it into either like an l g B t you, uh, center

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       community, Cerner. Somebody even said like a bath house. So that would be, yeah, yeah, that'd be great. Um, but anyways, he, um, you know, you, he's always good for a sound byte and this is from his latest, uh, I guess video posts here. Um,

Speaker 12:         00:53:44       let me tell you something before we can ever own the Lord's House. Cause that's what this is, that this is the Lord's House. This ain't no damn bath house. They know fag house. Oh Man, this is the Lord. And before you can ever own this property to own this property, you will be men who are fags. Testicles will be carrying babies, testicles, and given birth to them. Throw their anus. That's how impossible it is for you to get this house.

It's another pastor that a pastor is when anyone to think I was offending a midget.

Yeah, she was around when Hitler was, yeah, she was his girlfriend and she's toasting, she's in the Netherlands. No, it sounds German. She's goes, she goes post. Oh, and then, and then she says what? She says, oh man. Um, and then she says, uh, how Hitler and they all laugh, but then they're all like, um, and it looks like somebody whispers to were like, don't do that. You know? It's like, I dunno, she's a Hyundai grandma. Yeah. Grandma stopped doing that. Uh, but yeah, she does it for real too. I don't know. Oh, you can see, but she doesn't, she looks like she's, she's a little out of it. She's seen. I'll do it again. All right.

I've known my, no, I don't know what they're telling her. And then she's, she said that again. She's, she raises her drink again. Like, oh, maybe they didn't hear me.

Speaker 3:          00:58:20       it again. And this time they're like, there's less of a laugh. I kind of like,

Speaker 11:         00:58:27       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:58:27       She doesn't know then that looks like a grand side. Something is next to her. He's leaning into her ear. He's telling her you say it again? Yeah. You like you're saying it again.

Speaker 11:         00:58:43       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:58:45       Oh my God. The funny thing is I probably have a relative just like this. Absolutely. Just out of it. Hi. Lately she was alive when Hillary was around. Oh, she might've been 50 when he was around. Yeah. She looks literally 150 years old. He doesn't know what's up. It's hilarious. No, we got you saying that you can't wait for that song. Don't encourage that. Uh, give anybody that is your chances in Hollywood are higher. There you go. There's another, another, another soundbite from Christine's a, don't forget she's, she's solutes her, her king shit, not my fear. Um, uh, so this, you really got a kick out of this. This is, um, from a talk show. Oh my God, I love this. Um, this made me laugh. These or this is the, in the UK, obviously Lancashire, Johnny Davidson, Johnny Davidson jeopardize his pubes ginger. So apparently this is a guy calls in. Well, I can just play, you look at morning challenge and you're looking for someone to cheer him up.

Speaker 13:         01:00:11       Yeah. Rob from South Park didn't get to

Speaker 3:          01:00:19       terrible boarding shell like we're talking about. Yeah. He's just like a POW pow. Pow. Thank you. Do. Oh,

Speaker 14:         01:00:26       oh well I don't watch because I know that, I know you're very good with people who were a bit down. I don't like spend too long on if, cause I know it goes on.

Speaker 13:         01:00:36       That's right where people are going. A bit up though. I'm sure you are. Well, I'm from south. All nine last probably was during the depression. I know. What is the cost of going on the beach? There's Donnie, I see. I'm depressed. I was going to the beach for a all the two to quit office.

Speaker 3:          01:01:02       I don't understand the joke, but he's saying I go to the beach. The joke is how expensive it is to go on the bus. On the boat to the beach. To the beach to quit. Yeah. Okay. Gotcha. Okay. Uh, their English. This is English. Yeah. Yes. But it's like, it's not the queen. The Queen Talks Lancashire. Okay, so here we go. So He's, so he dropped out. He really, he did though. He might've hung out in comedy clubs here because he's big on laughing at his own jokes. Certain comics like really like to do that. Fucking really can't make it. Oh my God. Your pet peeve with comics. I think really because they laugh at their own shit during their set. I mean, only when it's like repetitive, when it's continuous or sometimes it happens genuinely. Oh my God. You're remembering why you thought it was funny in the first place.

Speaker 3:          01:02:04       But you mean like the person who says it in the moment that you go, I said this and then you find what you said really funny. Yeah, that's, that happens that happens in real life, but you're talking about the dude who like, it's a set up and he does it every time. It was like, oh my God. And he does it that way. Every single or, yeah. Everything he says makes himself laugh. Right. That's really everything that you say makes you laugh. Yeah. It's kind of, it's just like Sinbad, you know, like, like, because he that doesn't he like I, I, I dunno does he, it's just, I feel like he's one of those, uh, you know what I'm saying? You got to like that kind of thing. He got to the gym. I'm laughing at you right now.

Speaker 3:          01:02:46       I don't know if we should blame Sinbad, but I'm definitely last time went to the gym. I don't know that that happens. Or is the Steve Harvey laugh at his own stuff? I don't, I don't know. I'm trying to think of who does it. The one I'm thinking less famous people. I'm thinking of comics we now, yeah. And the people that I see just on stage all the time, I'm saying, you know, like, you know what I'm saying? Them onstage, locally and see them cracking up so hard at their own thought. I'm like, okay. I mean it just seems, it just seems it reads false to me. Yeah. We would laugh that hard at what you're saying all the time. Yeah. It's a lot.

Speaker 13:         01:03:28       I thought and I'm depressed. You say, why is he calls up bloody prices and large.

Speaker 3:          01:03:39       Those are the prices at Lord Street, right?

Speaker 15:         01:03:43       Huh?

Speaker 13:         01:03:51       I'm depressed. You say why was let's say the bloody one way he says to him,

Speaker 15:         01:03:58       Huh?

Speaker 13:         01:04:01       Can never get where you're going on the same side of the road. So I took off. I had to go to Burp. Deal to get pot.

Speaker 15:         01:04:14       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:04:18       Absolutely fucking with him. And that guy has no clue. Yeah. He has no clue. The guy went from laughing hard to go on at the other dude's a lame as fuck joke. How do they go to South Park? I did the two quid anyway. What are the prices are longer shot. He, I, you're not a master of accents. No. Cute bluff. Okay. Playing this. I love this.
