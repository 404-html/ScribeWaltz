That's so crazy. Genes. Do you think he knows the backend? Can't believe you don't think this is a bigger deal? Um, I don't only because, only because in this era of the Internet now, yeah, it's everything. Everything comes together so much faster. Yeah. I'm serious that a woman probably was like, oh my gosh. She's like, she's probably a fan of yours. And then she put it. Yeah. You know, it's not that crazy. Now you have lots of fans. Okay. Well I thought it was pretty crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:27:16       And um, she also let me know his mailing address in prison. Um, now that's crazy. You're going to write to, that part's crazy. If you write to him. Well, I was thinking of giving out his address so that everyone could write to him. Um, I sure will. And to encourage him to be not a criminal or just get through your time. You know how many fucking dumb shit he's going to get or people are like, bikes. It's all, it's going to be his bikes. I know. Pull your jeans up, Justin, stay in, stay out of prison. I was like, wait, why are these people calling me mommy bikes and the drawing pictures of bikes? That's what I wanted is that he just opened the letter and it just has a drawing of a bite. Do you want to help? I don't know. I mean I asked and then I consulted with somebody legally about doing that and they said it was fine because you know, we're asking people to write something nice.

Speaker 2:          00:28:18       I'm just apprehensive about it. I'm apprehensive to intuitively, it doesn't sound like a good idea. Yeah. I mean, look what happens when people just, we set the mommy's on like a Twitter person. We got Gloria, Stefan on Gloria. Stefan because of the mommies. Yeah. I don't know. We might ruin that guy. I don't want to do that. I really don't want to do that. It wasn't, I mean, I really thought it'd be cool in my mind. The cool thing would be he goes, uh, he's in prison would suck, which sucks. Then they go like, hey mail. And like one guy gets a letter, one guy gets two letters and they hid the guy's first name is Justin. I can say that you Justin. And they have to just like a bundle and what the fuck. And then people are writing cool things to him. Like, yeah, like you'll get through this or you know, encouraging stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:29:08       Um, you know the guy, I think he's, I don't know if he's married, he's got a couple of kids. I don't know. They could, people could be cool. But then again, if people would just go off and do some crazy, I don't want to be the one who encouraged you, who they blame for inciting that, you know? Yeah. I don't know. So anyways, let's think about it. Let's talk to our lawyer. Okay, let's ask our attorney. I'll say this, it's not that hard to find. Okay. So I'll just say that it's not that hard to find him. No. Oh, I mean, if you know me and you can find me. Okay. And your finance availed. Okay. Like where could they find you? On Twitter or, I dunno, there's other places. I don't know. I can't come on. You can't solve the whole mystery? No. Okay. So they see you on social media. Maybe they can find this place to send Justin some nice mail I guess.

Speaker 2:          00:30:10       I think they could, I'm not telling you you can. Okay. But I would encourage you, if you do decide to ride Justin a letter. I mean, seriously say something nice. Wouldn't that be, wouldn't if it sucked for like wouldn't it suck? First of all, they told me that his vibe, like his crime was that he, I think he was on probation and he was in, um, in possession of stolen property. So it's very possible that why he's in prison is because of like, he could have received a stolen and ends up in prison. So anyways, what I'm saying is that sucks just to go to prison. Wouldn't it be cool if at least you get like a hundred letters or more work? Definitely. That'd be the bright spot in your day. And that's the part of me that wants to do it, but I like, again, a mystery that he would never, maybe so like, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:31:05       What's Netflix like? I don't know how long he's been away. What's Netflix? He just went away now. Oh, okay. Yeah, no, he just, he just got locked up. That is so bananas. And she told me about it at the show and I wrote to her later like, you know, just asking questions and stuff and you know, Nice Kid, 12 year old kid. She was there with her husband. Probably came from a bad family. I'm guessing Justin didn't have great parents maybe. I'm guessing you didn't have a lot of guidance, do you think so? Yeah. And that's why you're in the shit at 12 year. You're on the scared straight show because the parents don't give a fuck about you. You're running the streets. Yeah. Seriously. You're not even capable of shit unless your parents are bad. It's true. Yeah. You tired hun jeans. You had a long day.

Speaker 2:          00:31:55       It was a long day. Do you want to talk about the physical? I think we should. Okay. I have some of that. Which one is that? One of my three. It's so it's also not, it's not even open yet. Sweet. Oh, it's nice and cold. Yeah. Um, yeah. So here's what happened man. It's been two years. Why not? Yeah, it's been two years since my last physical. I like to stay on top of it. And Yours is, how long has your, I forgot, cause you told me years has been how many years? 40 I can't believe you've never had one. I've never had a physical. You know why? Because I'm Hungarian. I got cockroach. DNA. It's true. It is true. I have no problems. I don't believe in this fucking bullshit. You by 25 to 45 Jesus. I hope so. I don't want you to die. Thanks. Your genetics are far weaker than mine. Yeah, you're less resilient. You get sicker more. Yup. He is sick more that your bowels are constantly bothering you.

Speaker 3:          00:32:55       All right, so here's what happened. Yeah. I go in first of all, from 2014 I weigh, I weigh 10 pounds less than I did in 2014. Good. That's good. Check. Oh wait, 22 pounds less than I did about six weeks ago. Okay. That's when I started eating like Kido Kedo yeah, he does hardware, Quito, Quito, c. K. E. T. O. Yeah. Okay. That's cute. Even after Quito, Kaylyn, it's the mantra. Quito. Kaitlin. And uh, so that's the good stuff. That's best. Best about what good stuff ends. So, so then he goes by doctors real thorough. He is doctor Dick by the way. Yes. If you follow my standup at all. Completely normal or you stream it on Pandora, I get a, a breakdown. The charts top tracks that are streaming and doctor Dick has been number one for me for about, I dunno, 15 months.

Speaker 2:          00:33:56       He Israel, he's our doctor. I go see this guy too and he says horrendously funny shit to us. So

Speaker 3:          00:34:04       that's the guy. Anyways, he keeps a really thorough notes, really thorough, you know, back ground stuff. So he's like, you know, yeah. Your waist down. Let me see what I wrote down 2014 you guys lose weight. Yes. You fucking finally listened to me. I go, all right, man. Keeps talking. Asking me. You know how things, anything bothering you. He goes, Oh yeah, I wrote that you had food poisoning this one time, you had this. I said, yeah, you know, I, um, oh, I had to, I had a food allergy test and they sent it to him cause they send any specialist sends something to him. He goes, that came back all negative. I said, yeah, I'm going to see this gastroenterologist though. I had a consultation just because of like explosive diarrhea and crazy shirts and shit. And he said, and I broke down for him how there's kind of no rhyme or reason.

Speaker 3:          00:34:58       Like some days it's horrible. Yeah. It's also like quick and then some days it's fine, it's IBS. Anyways, he goes, hmm, hmm. Uh, and then has, has, have you had that test or that test? And I go, uh, no, I'm having, I'm having it coming up. And he goes, yeah, I think you should. And he goes, shit, I test. Should I check your prostate? And I go, uh, he goes, it looks at me and I go, I don't know, like you're the doctor because we were a little young for it. I don't think so. All right. Let me keep talking about gastro stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       He goes, but maybe there's something there. Hm. All right. Uh, all right, we'll do it. And I'm like, oh man. And were you bond cause it sounded like you got out of it. Yeah. Well I wasn't bummed cause I told him I go, he kept looking at me like, what do you want to do? And I go, dude, I, I trust your right. If you think it do it, do it. But have you ever had a finger in your butt hole? Yes. Okay. But not that deep. So lemme tell you about this saying is that it's, it's his, if someone told me we're not going to do this today, I'd be like, great, let's move on. Yeah. I wouldn't debate it. Quit debating it in, they don't put it in there cause I don't like a finger in my butt.

Speaker 2:          00:36:25       So anyways, we do the physical. Oh. Then he goes, oh, let's run a quick EKG on you. And I'm like, all right. He runs it. And as is has been the case, I have a super low, uh, sitting heart rate. No. Like, uh, like an athlete. Yeah. Which is again, it's in that, it's in that bit, it's all like jokes about that. So he goes and your heart rate is so long ago. I know. It hasn't changed though. It's always been like that. He goes, I want you to wear a monitor, a heart monitor at home tonight while you sleep. I'm like, why? He goes, because I want to see how low it gets when you're sleeping. He goes, if it gets this slow when you're awake. Yeah. I want to see how low it gets when you're sleeping. And I'm like, God damn. We probably have near death experiences every night you think are dreams or on the other side. And if you don't know, you know the jokes that I make about at our, because marathon runners really, really strong cardiovascular people, their hearts are strong, so therefore they, they don't beat as many times per minute. So I have a, my heart, my sitting heart rate's around 44. There's gotta be like a hole in it or something that's making it extra slow. Well it's definitely not, I'm laid back.

Speaker 2:          00:37:50       Maybe he goes like, are you ever tired? And I'm like all the time. Yeah. That's your heart. So anyways, I wore that. I slept last night like a 90 year old man. 15 patches. Oh, it's embarrassing. And I mean it was fine. I don't bad for you. I saw people look at it. When I went from him, I went to the, uh, rite aid. I had a button down. Yeah. Like this one. People were like, this guy's about to die. I'm surprised I didn't shave your chest though. Cause it didn't it. Yes. Did it, did heres rip out multiple hundreds possibly. Yeah. They usually shave you for that. They didn't know. How did you sleep with that stupid thing in your pocket? It was, I had shorts

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       on and I was honestly what, you know what helped yesterday I was so tired. Does it was easy to fall asleep,

Speaker 2:          00:38:42       been a rough couple of week in a cigarette house. We're recording this at night. When I a while the baby sleeps. We normally do this in a day, but it's been naughty. Yeah. Yeah. Lots going on. So, okay. He fingers your but wait, no, no, no. We're not there yet. Oh, I'm sorry. They take a bunch of blood. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:39:03       I do a urine test. He goes, I'm here. You're going to take this heart thing at home. I go, okay. Then he checks the balls, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:39:13       And what does that feel like? Is it kind of Nice or it's a medical, it's medical. It's real medical. He touch it. Hard to feel for lumps are not hard pressure.

Speaker 3:          00:39:22       It's, it's soft to medium,

Speaker 2:          00:39:26       but he checks it. Does he wear gloves or free ball and free. Free hands. Gloves. A soft, nice hands. Nice hands. Yeah. And you can tell him

Speaker 3:          00:39:34       knows what to do with a pair and nuts. Like he knows how to hold them medically. Sure. Um, yeah. So do you have to cough? Is that real? Sometimes I didn't have to coffee yesterday, but I have had to cough before. Why do they do that? Um, I guess because they know like it's a reflex thing to seem to live close to go. So if they don't, maybe something's wrong. I Dunno. Hmm. Um, anyways, checked me all out, then comes in and he goes, all right, lay on your left side.

Speaker 2:          00:40:02       Hmm. Yeah. And he goes in there now with your left hand. So imagine you're laying on your left side. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:40:09       Extend your hand as far as you can and hold up your cell phone. I'm like, okay. He's like an open the camera. And I'm like, all right. He's like, not put the reverse camp, you know, reverse camera on so you can, it's up for a selfie. And I'm like, what? And he's like, do it if I put it on. And he's like, all right, great. Take a picture. I go, okay. So it's me holding it out. And then he holds his finger up to his nose and he's like, Ooh, like that. That's what my doctor did. And I go, can I please post this? He was like, absolutely not. I sent it to you though.

Speaker 2:          00:40:44       I was amazed. I really appreciate, I can't post it. You know what I mean? Now he's a professional. Yeah, he's really good doctor. He's so thorough. He's so good. He's a genius. That guy. I go in there for like minor stuff and he's so thorough.

Speaker 3:          00:40:57       Hey this so then comes the moment truth. He's like lay, lay there. Pull your knees up.

Speaker 2:          00:41:03       Yeah, we had been there and he lubes up the finger. Right. How much of the finger does he lubricate? I can't really tell, but it feels, and is it embedded in the middle?

Speaker 3:          00:41:13       He does, um, for the index and it's pretty low. I asked him right before I go, you want me to clean up back there? And he kind of smiled and then

Speaker 2:          00:41:23       he's nice. He's saying is that, I thought of that with you because that's my fear about putting my finger or mouth on your rectum is dirty. It must be. It was. And the thing is is that it wasn't, was it sweaty? It was hot today in La. No, it was yesterday. Oh is he? Yes. Yesterday. Yeah, she was overcast. So you did, but you did feel self conscious about the smell. At first, I didn't know even know what it looked like. So I real quick did a cursory check back there. I took some paper and I checked you got nothing. So I was clean. Yeah. Cause when I go to the gynecologist I make sure I'm very clean. I take a nice full, I didn't know anyone was going to get in there. I knew, I remember I asked you, yeah, I go, he's going to stick his finger in your butt.

Speaker 2:          00:42:12       And you got no, he's not because he wasn't going to, he decided in the moment I asked for it to not ask for it. So, uh, he stick, he sticks his finger in and I'm surprised at the ease and also the, uh, lack of discomfort I'm feeling really at first. Right. So it's like, okay. And I'm like, oh, oh baby monitor. I'm like, all right, that's not bad. Yeah. And as that thought is processing, like that's not bad. He does a swipe. He goes, he goes, no polyps like that. And then he goes, oh, I can feel it. He goes check into profit. And I'm like, I do like the like just startled, you know, like absolutely. Ah, ah. And he goes, you want a second opinion? I can put another finger in there. And I'm like, Dude. And then he pulls it out. It goes, there you go.

Speaker 2:          00:43:11       I'm like, oh my God, man. Like it, it was traumatic. It was traumatic. It's terrible. Whenever someone puts their hand inside of you, everyone, I was getting checked when I was going to birth Ellis and someone put their hand at my coach every hour. Like it hurts at that point. Terrible. So he said, now I put my finger like this and you before it feels like I have to shit immediately. You've liked it. You liked it. It feels like I have to shit now. You didn't feel like you had to shit immediately. You didn't like it. Please answer my questions. I have so many because one time I had a medical finger in my butt. Honestly, I felt damaged. Sure. I was like, wow. He really was rough with you. Well, he wasn't, I mean it wasn't it rough for damage or sore because he was too, it was too rough.

Speaker 2:          00:44:02       I mean, I, I had a lot of thoughts about anal after that. Like not, not fun. Tender felt tender. I was like, Ooh, let me know if you never had that, did you? Okay, so you said that the finger went in easily. Lot of Lube. So he really, when I cleaned up back there it was gunks so that's good. Yeah, that was considerate of him. Yeah. So it went in easy and then you felt when it got deeper as you're saying, you felt the hook and he kind of looked at in there. Oh yeah. Yeah. Sort of thinking about that pegging class we went to for Nikki. Who is your show? Because we did a show. We did Nikki Glaser show, not so safe. And we went to a peg in class on the show. Yeah. I was thinking about that. Like, man, I remember how you guys were like fucking these clay models.

Speaker 2:          00:44:51       Yeah. Oh my God. Even those like chapstick sized ones, I go, man, I don't know. I didn't, I didn't think of anything feeling, and I know I had a medical procedure. I'm not trying to equate it with that, but I'm just saying it was so tender. I was like, Ooh, you know the Butthole, it's, it is real tender. Roney yeah. It's just not for me personally, you know? I don't condemn anybody that's into it, but no, not at all. It's real, real tender. Yeah. Okay, so now you took a shit since then. Wait, wait, wait. But did it hurt to shit? It wasn't like that. No, no, no, no. It was just like sensitive, like, you know, like a muscle. Yeah. Yeah. No one though. Like those guys used to bang that. Like they were just like, oh, rapid triage it out and they would wrap or fire bang. We've got to be like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Take it easy. You just tell me about those guys. Like, like, you know what I mean? It's called the prison pound. Yeah. You love those, right? Love prison pounding. Especially when you start to dry out. Yeah. It's like it takes too long and then yeah, it just dry like a dry rub in there. Kind of feels like that.

Speaker 2:          00:46:02       Here's the other part. He goes, well because of your digestive stuff and we're not sure yet because you haven't had the colonoscopy yet and all this and that. I want you to take this kit home, shit into this plastic cup and then scoop of pieces of the shit into these four vials. Dude, I nearly vomited this morning. I also had, um, what's it called? Performance anxiety. I know you did. Now don't you wish you had just done the colon

Speaker 9:          00:46:40       brown, Brown John Coming up? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:46:47       I sent you wouldn't be punished and have to do what you going about to talk about doing. Well, I still have it scheduled, but I'm saying that had you done it prior, you wouldn't have got, you wouldn't go through what you did today to have gone through that. That was so disgusting. Let's talk about it. So here's the thing too. I, I felt the nature calling and I went up there and I sat down with a cup underneath me and a plastic surgeon's gloves to tell them the accouchement. So you, you have a set of plastic gloves, you've got a rubber gloves, rubber gloves, you've got a, basically a Dixie cap shit into shape. And then you have several vials. Yes. Of each file has a lid. And the, when you remove the lid, there's a little shovel scooper and it's for you to break up poop and put in there. And then there's, and there's fluid in three of them and nothing in one.

Speaker 2:          00:47:44       So I had two false alarms because they're so worked up about it. Yeah. I was like, I gotta do it because I also have a busy day. It's not just like, Hey, do this and then you're done. It was do this, um, then go to our house, we're moving to, had to do something there, come back here, bed, go back there. Yeah. So it was a lot of stuff. What I'm saying is I, um, man, when I finally got it to come out, it was like, it came out in, you know, in one like blend chunk. Yeah. It was kind of Mushy, kind of stringy and it was like in that, there was something, I dunno man, here's the thing. I was fucking gagging at like, what's into like, I've always wanted to kind of pick it apart. I see. Like, did you see pieces of stuff?

Speaker 2:          00:48:46       Can I tell you something? I realized too, and I've said this before, I can talk about the act of shitting without it, without a blink actual shit. I'm not, I don't have, I can't do it. I'm like, oh right, you've said this before. You're really not into it. Oh my God, dude, you're sitting there right there with a cup of your own feces. I have never done that. Chopping it up. Oh, and here's the other part, because I had to do those things. I didn't had to put those containers in a sealed bag in a third bag and keep them in the frigerator. Cool. Right next to our babies. No, I kept it in the, in the drawer there's like a special drawer we have under the fridge. I put it in there. Good. That is so gnarly, dude. So you cut it out, but what was in your poom asking? Did you find I saw stuff. I don't want to bring it up to him. Gagging. I was dry heaving. I had tears running down my face. It was really fucking disgusting. I really, really hated it. I can't even tell you. Maybe one day when you've processed it more, you can tell me what you saw. It was bad. Just know that it was bad. It was gross.

Speaker 2:          00:50:03       Yeah, it was really bad and that sounds terrible. I dropped off. I dropped off the heart monitor with, so they're going to tell me what, what happened overnight and then I dropped off a bag of shit. He's thorough. Dr. I don't think I've ever heard of anybody having to go through this much stuff. Even on the Dropbox, I'll do another urine test because he wanted to make sure my urine test was up to par and was like, yeah, it's fine. They ran the test. Right then bananas. Yeah. Good though. That's what she want. That's exactly what you want. So then, okay, so that's drama. Yeah. With the house. And then I took LJ to the doctor today for his checkup and he lost his shit. I had to take blood from his little heel today. No, I had to sing twinkle, twinkle little star for him to calm down. I calmed them down. Yeah. My voice is terrible, but it's the only thing that stopped him. It was so cute. Why didn't you sing

Speaker 2:          00:51:27       such a weird song? Yeah, I like it. And then I found a love match for our nanny or Guatemalan nanny. Um, his name is Israel and he works in the parking garage. Yeah. Where pediatrician. He's real nice. Yeah. I really liked his energy. I want to set them up. Do you think he, uh, they're both Guatemalan. Yeah. I feel like it's a, it's a, and they're both like super sweet, you know? Yeah. Like I say, sarcastic shit to both the nanny and to people like Israel and they're just like blank. Yeah. You know, like little bit. How's it going? I'm like, well, kids still alive today at all, Dude, just remind you of it.

Speaker 1:          00:52:05       COMP, drought baller shit. No, fuck them bombing the shit. Fucking carbs are a fucking ball.

Speaker 2:          00:52:49       That could have been the guy. That's one of my favorite things of all time is that those guys findings are released. They're gangbangers. I mean if the setup is true there, there's a video. These two dudes are like, you can hear him, their total la Trobe say like bought those and, and they're like, I love gang violence so much that they like, it's like, uh, a hack premise for a joke that they used to say. Remember when they couldn't find been loud and all these guys, man, they should just get sent some crips and bloods over there. You'll find him. Shoot them. These guys were like, that's how much we love it and killing. Yeah. And they, and then in the video they go crazy with the machine gun and saying it's legit. Yeah. I think that's a real thing. I've always said it was hilarious, man.

Anyways, so we have this bed that we, um, the frame we should say the bed is Saatva, which we've had are, you guys know, uh, the bed is fun in the mattress is perfect, but we ordered this bed and we got it. It took months to get here. And when it finally did. Oh my God, it was, it started squeaking and we got this bed. It arrived in like June or something.

Speaker 11:         00:54:16       Oh my God. Is that it? Is that our bed? No, but it sounds

Speaker 3:          00:54:23       picture a picture too, by the way. You guys know we waited a long, long, long time

Speaker 2:          00:54:31       to get a nice mattress, which yes. You know we can slap a mattress and we waited a long, long time to get this. This is a really nice bed frame in. Yeah. Like we spent, you know, decent money on this for sure. We didn't have a bed frame. Yeah. For years. No bed frame. Just a bad, just the mattress. I used to sleep with a bachelors on the floor and then at one point we got just one step up, which was just, what is it? Just a box for rail? Yeah. Block Saatva set it up there. Like do you have a, a frame? I go, no. And they set up, they love, it's what solve it right. Gave us so then when we move we're like, why don't we get a proper look? Adults. Yeah. Like and with a nice headboard, you know? Yeah. And we went to a really nice store and we did it. We're like, we're buying this really nice bed frame. It's like an investment by the way.

Speaker 3:          00:55:25       We bought it, let's say in February. And they were like, it's going to be delivered March 1st and then write it to her at the end of February. They go, it's not ready. And we go, okay, well you know it's been a month, but how much longer? We think in April. Yeah. Oh, another month. Yeah. Then they just didn't call back. Do you remember that? They look, of course I played then anyways. Then they were like, okay, you know when we complain where you're getting the bed, the guys came out and set it up and day one like you lay on the bed.

Speaker 11:         00:55:59       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:56:00       But I think we, a couple things. We had a newborn baby. Yes. And we also were like, it's new. Like maybe this is maybe settling. Yes. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:56:09       And Man, it's,

Speaker 2:          00:56:12       it felt like it got worse. Yeah. I got white worker and then I would any movement, any movement. And you and I get up to pee in the night five times between the two of us. So every time one of us gets up it's like the loudest, it's a nice sound.

Speaker 11:         00:56:27       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:56:27       The frame. That's what you do here at two o'clock in the morning. Yeah. And then the person leaves and makes you think, oh are you talking about a hundred year old bed? I know three or four month old bit and they made it, it was one of those like custom. Yeah, bed frames. Like it wasn't just some pos. No. Anyways, I started to get desperate. You know when you, when you have the thought of you picture them saying fuck you, you bought it. Yeah. Yeah. I used to have, I would have those in my mind. I know you were really fired up like to a point where I was kind of worried because you are ready. We're convinced that they weren't going to fix it. Yeah. And you were like, you call, okay, you call a UGL it cause I'm going to get too angry. And I was like, all right babe.

Speaker 2:          00:57:11       Like I know when you're fired up about something. Yeah. I'm like, all right, I'll fucking call them. And they were totally sweet about yeah. Oh my can of course send us a recording of the squeak and then from, it's like protocol for them and then we can send somebody out. They sent somebody out within 48 hours. Yeah, but you were on your last, like he was one of those things where you would love town and you're like, could you fix the bed please this week? And I'm like, yeah, sure. On top of everything else that's going on, the kid being sick or you know, whatever. I'm going to make sure. So we finally fixed it. Finally Heimaey came. Was that today? Yeah. Hi. May came. And so what did he say? Why has it been so shitty? He said the washers were the wrong ones. Cool.

Speaker 2:          00:57:57       Certain things weren't done tightly and you know, he took, we took the mattress off together, then the box spring and then he just worked with like the core, like the rails and he said, you know, Ron washers here and uh, tightened everything up. Boom. Yeah. Cause I sat on, it was great. Oh my God. I know it's bright. It's really been disruptive. I think it's been psychological torture. Yeah, it is. It is. Because we wake up every time one of us mood any movement. Eh, eh. I mean you should be able to move without. Amen. Yeah. It was so bad. It's so weird that we did wait so long, so long.

Speaker 11:         00:58:40       We just adapted to it. A couple of idiots. It's horrible every day.

Speaker 2:          00:58:51       It is one of those things where as as humans you just, you're so adaptable. Yeah, yeah, of course wrong. And then you're like, well, just live. We'll just live around this misery and were really into that. Oh yeah. That's the bad. That makes noise.

Speaker 5:          00:59:04       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:59:06       You realize how long we dealt with at that level. No, I mean it's really, it's pretty a long time. It's like having one phone charger in the house half a year. We've been sleeping

Speaker 5:          00:59:15       like that

Speaker 2:          00:59:18       wrong with us. When you're like, we can buy phone chargers, like we can have them in every room. Like, Oh yeah, that's why like 10 of them. Why do I suffer? And it's like such an easy fix. Did they, they didn't even charge us to fix the bed, right? Uh, no. Yeah, I gave the guys from scratch that we're doing such a good, yeah, yeah, yeah. I suffer so much sometimes. Yeah. Needlessly. God. Do you want to hear a crazy accent or see a crazy, a porn clip that's not hardcore? Sure. Which one? Porn or ag accent. I mean, you know,

But in any break you get to hear loud television in the background. And I think the lighting is from the television. Yes. It looks like. Yes. So he just has a TV room and rambling, senseless nonsense. I heard him say any man wants to fight me, which is, it's a pretty bold, yeah. Challenge. Right? I feel like he and the deck hand guy, yeah. Would be a good man. He might be the Irish version of the deck hand. It might be, although I feel like this guy is less of a piece of shit. Even watching somebody make a, I'll fight anybody video. I still feel like he's less of a piece of shit. Sure. In the deck hand, he's got his life together a bit more. He has an apartment in doors, right? That we know about it. That's true. He does live inside. Yeah.

Speaker 15:         01:12:53       Being a groundskeeper for the frat houses can be a pain in the ass, but there are a few things that keep me here. One is that nobody fucks with me. The powers to be, let me do my own thing. As long as the yards are kept up and there are no problems, there should be obvious. There is more barely legal twat on campus anywhere else in the city. Boy, Hey God, I enjoy looking at fresh, young snatch. Just particular to house was put on my list last month and this was the first time that had a chance to work here or the narratives middle.

Speaker 15:         01:13:58       thinks I'm a fucking retard. What an insult because I started a little, there's no reason to think that I'm an idiot. I'm going straight in this dunk cut out. And I remembered that I was wearing a shirt that had writing on front special Olympiads before. I could say a word. She hugs me. My Dick instantly got hard. I thought you'd feel it. I thought of playing a retard. It was going to get me laid.

Speaker 15:         01:16:03       Well, I figured the trick was not dead, too embarrassed at all. So then I looked at who cries like stupid. Like he kept on Jack. Yeah.

Speaker 16:         01:16:10       Can BP her? Let's see. He's quiet. Yeah. So she's, she's

Speaker 15:         01:16:24       being nice to him. I figure I better make my plan now because she was looking at my cock like it was her last meal, so I took her hand and grand hat.

He's really a munching on her stuff, but I kind of want to see what year. Just wanted to see the grand finale. What's the, and also I wanted to see if he was going to be retarded, right? Or is he going to tell her the truth? Like, yeah. Higher Iq than you bitch. Yeah. That's what I retards, it's gotta be a finale.

Speaker 3:          01:17:13       MMM.

Speaker 16:         01:17:14       No. Oh, here we go. I think we're getting close. Yeah. Big retarded finale. The big fake retarded valley. It's a really underwhelming performance, by the way. What? It looks like two people fairly like missionary, but barely really moving. You know, it's not soft core. No, no, no, no. It's not, but it's like real bland. Okay, here you go. Ah, who's retarded? Okay. Ah, no line. Nothing. I didn't even think this through a lot of acne. Oh, they really missed out a golden opportunity here and the punchline. Nothing. I was starting to get a little worried he was putting on her clothes so she was getting real quiet. Has it beginning to think that maybe the Jig was up and she was pissed. I figured what the Hell is that pussy was definitely worth every trouble. He kind of promised me that. You won't tell anyone, Huh? Christy can get in a lot of trouble for taking advantage of this special person. Okay, Miss Christy, I promise. Oh Damn. Yeah they could really, that was it. Like that was such a blessing that we just got one over on the slow girl

Speaker 3:          01:19:11       man. He should have been like, yeah, no retarded. You dumb bitch. Stupid Bitch. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You fucked a pretend retard. Oh my God. And somebody else will good. We got a lot of emails about this. This is my fault, but I'm sorry if the, uh, if us dumping the back catalog ruined your data plan B in your storage, right. You guys, we explained in the last episode, but then we got so much, we just did it to, to be nice and to give out the entire back catalog to you guys because we get asked a lot for it. Yeah. And I, and we did, we always are like, oh, one day, any other day we just said let's just do it. And um, I insisted and then, I mean, people have been writing a lot like, oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Uh, but wanting to to find these, but I definitely got a bunch of like, what in the fuck? Like my phone shut off. Um, anyways, really sorry if, uh, if it, you know, fucked up your storage and everything but a hope. Hope you do like having access to all the back catalogs in eight hours. We had over 1.5 million down crazy. Um, yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:20:34       because we'd done that like once before, a million years ago. It was way before the show took off. Yeah. And it didn't have the impact, so we did not know. I didn't know. Sorry guys.

Speaker 3:          01:20:46       Um, anyways, people wrote more farts please. This eight email just came in from mason. Okay. I am a longtime mommy recently looking through your amendment Mama. So decided to listen to episode one 93 with cousin Janette. I'm glad you mentioned that. Undoubtedly one of your finest mama sows. Uh, I had an epiphany as I was listening. I had an epiphany where have all the parts gone. I listen every week and did not notice until now. There has been a real fart drought at your mom's house. I do not know what the reasoning behind this is, but I think I speak for a lot of mommies. When I say, come on, you guys, show me how those big tits fart. With that being said, I still love the show immensely. A door, the main mommy's, but seriously more fart please. A Mason from Charlotte. I saw Tom, uh, on the 15th.

Speaker 2:          01:21:38       Now does he mean that we aren't farting or that we don't play enough farts? I think it's a combination of the two. It's really been a fart decline. And I will say the reason that our farts tapered off is because our microphones, we used to hold them in our hands and then we upgraded the studio. We've got the, and now we do these. And it's really hard to fart into these microphones cause there's an arm, right?

Speaker 3:          01:22:04       Oh, what is that? And you'd have to uh, Jeez. I think you're, whoa. Uh, um, all right. Yeah, we're good. Uh, you're answering the question for them though. What do you mean get far mix? Just put mics on.

Speaker 2:          01:22:23       That's really good. And we can get them professional grade like these [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:22:28       yeah. And then what happens is you mute them and I let you know, like that's your fart. So whenever you have one you just unmute it. It's a really good idea. I mean, it really get, and guess what happened as we're, as we're talking about this, sure. As we're having this convert sation the king has returned from his long Brown cation. No. And surprisingly enough, he's still ripping some damn farts. Wow. Well look, can we see, can we see it? I mean, he's back.

Speaker 8:          01:23:07       Our great leader

Speaker 16:         01:23:14       an apartment. Whoa. It's still doing his thing and stuff like that. That's his. Wow. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:23:27       Sorry. You know, I feel like it's been so long. It feels like

Speaker 16:         01:23:31       the first time, you know? Yeah. Nice. Whole there. Ooh, Jesus.

Speaker 2:          01:23:37       Oof Man. I missed him so much. Now this is a, an upgrade because when we more king parts around apartment, that's the title of the video course. The first time we found him he was in his parents' basement. Yeah. And now he's got his own place, which is great. There's been other kitchens and other rooms though. I feel like he's moved. Maybe he's the Kinda guy that can't hold down a job long and therefore we lose a lot, you know? No, kind of feels like that to me. Uh, surely none really farting a lot though. I like the whole,

Speaker 16:         01:24:09       yeah, it looks good. Ooh. That felt like that could go wrong. That could go south real quick. His guts. Sure. A shrink.

Speaker 2:          01:24:34       What do you think doctor would say to him? I was just thinking that he would have to go through his shit with his own hands. Now, a lot of people over the years have written to us and say that ass rappers a fraud and that he'll pump his rectum full of air. Yeah. I don't see how that's Po. How can you fart for five? Whole consecutive meant there are no edits. There are edits. Oh, and this one, there is a lot on watching right now and it's like, like three fights in a row.

Speaker 2:          01:25:24       Sounds like, I mean that is a lot of air coming out, so yeah. Well, I mean you either have to be consuming constantly to keep that out, which he likes to consume is a gluttonous slob or whatever. Yeah. Harry and gross letting a Slob. Yeah. Yeah. You know, he is the only, the only person who has not come on your mom's house after us. We're sorry doing him. He did give a shout out to us though. He did. No, he didn't say it. If you, when he had his youtube channel, he said, it said in the video description, shout out to your mom's house. Oh cool. So he gave us some props. It was a tip of the cap. That's a good tip of the panty. That was the most he would do. He did not want any exposure. So interesting. And, and I, we either went on over there.

Speaker 2:          01:26:15       Yeah. And we, we talked about him and they were an yeah, we did a profile and show Joe. And even with all that, after we got back from that, we were like, now let's try to get, and he was unresponsive.

We offered him money and hey dude, we'll pay you whatever art because I love it. Yeah. The love of the game. Yeah. It really is. You can't be bought. He doesn't want the, the glory. That's how he's a purist. You respect him for that. He's a purist. Yeah. He doesn't show his face as much anymore. If you'll notice, it's just the panties. And the

Speaker 16:         01:26:55       no, he still shows. It turns back and yeah, but it's not really now. Look, have a look what's coming up here though. Your favorite look out brown.

What site, but on Youtube, on his profile says, my gluttony has become a hobby of mine. I work as a construction worker and I keep my gluttony a secret from my family. Oh, I'm gaining for all my subscribers and love scarfing down tons of fattening and lard, gross food and garbage to pack in my growing Harry Beer Gut, my goal is to reach 300 pounds with the help of my fans. Okay. So that makes sense. He wants to remain anonymous. Never written that much before though. No, it doesn't sound like him. You know, the thing about him is he does have this Banksy quality where it's cause there's all these, cause he's been kicked off of Youtube and lively because so many times. And I always wonder if somebody, just the videos, you know, ripping them and then saying that they're him. He's so mysterious. That writing that you just read, that's not ass rapper voice. That's just not him. I don't believe it.
