Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Well. Well, well go to your mom's house, Christina Vincent.

Speaker 2:          00:00:23       Your burps are just violent rips? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:00:30       All right.

Speaker 2:          00:00:33       How angry would your mom get along? Let it let it good.

Speaker 4:          00:00:56       Your books the best because I feel like they always tell a story. Please.

Speaker 2:          00:01:18       Good. My point. Yeah. Good. We do my language. I can't listen to it and drying my last episode I had a really,

Speaker 4:          00:02:13       I'm going to pass a good stuff. I feel like he made a real song here. It was really good. Who is this western?

Speaker 2:          00:02:50       Oh says west as it really funny. I was laughing really hard as long as called Burp. No Shit. Artists is called West. That's west. You know what? I love my favorite bourbon. That

Speaker 5:          00:03:00       is when you go back, when it's half out and you muffle the second half. Yeah. Where did you pick that technique? I don't know. You know, I've just been in the game so long. I just have so many different skills to really do whatever. I want to kind of an innovator, if you will. How long have you been using that burp technique? Years. Many years. I have a wide range of abilities when it comes to bourbon. I think you notice it in that song. You definitely conceded that I am the burp. No I did not. You said I did not say that said you're definitely the better Berber that I didn't say the phrase burp champion. Well yeah, but you said it without saying it. That that's probably from an episode like 200 back and that's before I listen to what you said. Pregnancy changed my burp games. Violent rips. I liked the reps. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:03:52       That statement taken from our show. Yeah. Like 200 episodes ago. No, it was pretty reasonable. This one. Yeah. Yeah. That's me. That's me. That's me. I'm doing the loud ones. I feel like they always tell a story.

Speaker 5:          00:04:25       Yeah, I'm the BURP champ. But I didn't say you're the verb champion. I didn't use to have to say it. What it is, it's not implicit. All I said is I liked yours the best because they have different sounds. Pitches. They do tell a story. I like when you go half into the sometimes you like that. Why don't you try it? Cause it's your technique. I can't or you can try it. No, it's not. It's not mine. Mine's different. I like to go aggressive. You heard what I was capable of and that song, I'd like surprises.

Speaker 5:          00:04:57       That's, that's a going, can I have some of your doctors evs to get my own burps going. Your whole thing is like, I want somebody yours. That's because yours is better than my, I don't know why you do that. It's really ridiculous. It just tastes better. It tastes good. Tastes good. A bitch. Um, but you're, you're burbs consistently make me laugh. Um, probably that's probably why. One of the main reasons I married you and your burps in here. One of the main reasons. I mean, there's other stuff like, are you a good person? Are you not addicted to things? Do you call, you know, like do what you're saying, are you going to do keep your word, are you moral? But above all that is, can you Burke? Wow. I didn't realize it was that high on the list. Well, yeah, because I've actually addicted to things. That's a little important to a lot, but I, I dated guys in the past who don't like by, they didn't like my burbs where my farts and I got a lot of heat for being who I was. Really. So when I found you I was like, Oh really? Oh yeah. I have upset. Every ex boyfriend did not appreciate my burping or farting skills. Wow. Fall in.

Speaker 5:          00:06:12       I got a lot of heat for my burbs. Like the last boyfriend I had before you. Yeah. He actually would be like, stop farting. Stop it. Like he would get really mad at me. He didn't appreciate it. That's why I can't hear it. The thing is done. That's why. Okay. O is for is for far. Yeah. I liked that burp that I did on the show that made the teaser. That was a pretty, I mean, I wish you'd give me some credit. I feel like you just want to Laurie and I don't get it. What about my farts? Remember you came home and I farted a lot yesterday. Very cool. In the kitchen. I farted a bunch and there's no shortage of parts from you. I mean if that's what this is about, well who's a better, okay, let's decide then. Who's a better fighter? Who was a bit of Roper? You really want to have that discussion right now. He really thinks so. Well why not? Why can't we just have the discussion? It doesn't have to lead anymore. Let's just open up a topic. You know, you know the answer. What's the answer?

Speaker 5:          00:07:18       I'm definitely the king supreme of both of those categories. Not True. Yana. Yana might. I present the case of my farts being very smelly and hot cause I eat a lot of dried apricots in the past. I tend to have smellier hotter farts than you think so. Yeah. Mine smell way worser than yours. Sometimes they do. Most of the time they do. I think we're going to vomit during this. There's so much gross stuff in this episode. Last conversation is one of them. Definitely the BURP champ. I can't believe you wouldn't concede that. I don't know. I feel like that's up for debate. I feel like, I just feel like we need to open it up and let's kind of see where it says I'm not ready to call that yet. Okay. I feel like it's warm in here. It's not warm in here. You're always hot.

Speaker 5:          00:08:14       We'll take off your fucking sweatshirt. We'll know because it's like comfortable. But I mean the other day I take off the sweatshirt aware these sweatshirts comes or not hot anymore. It's comfortable to wear it though. That's what I'm saying. But here's what Howard tour that was pretty good. This is how ridiculous it was. Just looked at it to see how it registered and how did it register? Pretty hot. Pretty hot. How is yours and comparison go back to it. You didn't look when yours. I mean you, you did it like a real theatrical appropriate then though. Really forced to, so what you're saying, what you're saying is, is that you, you're good with a variety. I might be good with sound. See I like, I like that right there cause it had different sounds and then you incorporate it at the end. My favorite Burberry or is when you used to go when the mouth and then blow it out?

Speaker 5:          00:09:08       Yeah. I mean you're talking about all these different burps right now and you're like, those are cool down one's called. They'll be like, that one's cool. That was cool. But then you go. But I mean, who says you're the best? Well, who does all these different verbs? It's me. I'm obviously the boat. We haven't decided what criteria is the best. Okay. And in my opinion, yeah, variety is important, but so is pitch frequency volume. Very important. Yeah. So I think I have the volume. I have the fortune to talk about how ridiculous you are. Oh, that light's off by the way. Oh Shit. Fuck. Hold on. You guys can look at my light denim that I got. Oh yeah, she's got real light dad. But I'll tell you why. Because these are lucky brand and they're like a nineties Jean that I specifically order online. Pretty nerdy colored. Yeah. But the cut is cool. Look,

Speaker 6:          00:09:58       it looks kind of cool though. Cool.

Speaker 5:          00:10:01       Yeah. Dad, where did the uh, white sneaks

Speaker 6:          00:10:06       yeah. Should close this door.

Speaker 5:          00:10:09       Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Definitely. I know another another day of rain. You want me to hold the heat? Yeah. No, I'm going to turn the air on so cold. Why? Why? Why are you doing this? Why aren't you doing this? You're miserable. No, Dad. You're the worst. How cold are you going to make it in here, Jean? You have such unreasonable expectations for this. The other day I was in bed and I go, is it warm in here? No. I go, it smells warm and I kind of just like, I let your logical mind step in for a second and then I go, wait, this doesn't feel right and I get up and I work. I miss that. And it's 80 it's 80 and you're like, I like it. It feels good. Here's a problem with what you do or I don't like your methods is because it'll be hot as fuck outside.

Speaker 5:          00:11:08       I don't feel it kicking on, so you don't feel it. Jesus. Oh my God. Oh my God. So listen, my problem with your AC consumption is that it'll be hot as fuck outside and then you'll decide to put it down to like 60 never, never once. Not even once. You said you want it to be 63 never done it. Never. How low do you put that thermostat because of you? It feels like 63 I should say that because of you. I always put it at 72 73 silo like that please. The problem is you turn it to low and then it feels like keep it in the low seventies not even down to seven but it feels like I have a fever. I don't feel like you have a fever. It makes me feel feverish and sick when you make the AC so cold and it's been hot all day, so my body's all super high.

Speaker 5:          00:12:00       Whenever I see you and then you overcompensate with whatever. I see you being feverish and sick. I feel so happy and I feel so good with myself, you know, kind of smaller. And your soda. Where's your water? Water Champ. Oh, interesting. Yet another episode where you have no water. Every two beverages with you. Ha, I have coffee and I have water id hydrate, but then I rehydrate. That's my system. The whole thing I do is I don't dehydrate ever. So he also don't drink water and I do. The thing is water champion, not beverage champion. I drink gallons of water were not during the show. I don't know how you go in there right now because I drank so much before. Oh, really? Yeah. Okay. That's your story. Plus, this is water soda. Why naturally flavored? No Art, no sugar, no artificial sweeteners, no caffeine.

Speaker 5:          00:12:50       Fun at all. Water. Yeah. Oh it whatever. I always thought the clear stuff that comes from the tap is water, but you're, you're claiming the Black Cherry via soda is the same as water it is. It's exactly the same molecularly. Well, it has some carbonation in it. Okay. Add some flavorings that make it not taste. Why no artificial sweetener, don't you just drink water if you like water or something like that. Do I drink it all day? I drink gallons of senior drink. Any water today. You're a liar, but you live in a lie. What's the light? Okay, now you're performing. You're forcing it. You're forcing it. You're the lightship. That'll you're either lie champ. He's a liar champ. You're the liar. Chances are willing to share the cold champion. You like it cold like your heart ready. Let's do this shit.

Speaker 7:          00:13:39       I've been, I'm very, very dirty ground lately. For some reason I've been going two, three days without showering. Oh No. I know. It's pretty bad. It is. But it's not all bad because since I'm not showering as often as I probably shut, that means that my asshole probably has a nice stinky sent to it.

Speaker 5:          00:14:08       Oh is Randy. Don't bring anyone loving coded.

Speaker 1:          00:14:14       Well welcome to your mom's house for us Christina pledges. It's interesting

Speaker 8:          00:15:09       she hasn't showered in three days, but that means on the good side. Yeah, this, she's got real stinky be whole. That is a positive. So I thought you were going to say she's not wasting water but that too. Yeah, that too. How, what's the longest you've gone without showering? Definitely a couple of days, but not, not often, man. I mean, uh, yeah. I'm trying to think of like sickness Leben like really sick. You stay in bed and it hurts to stand. That kind of stuff. Yeah, a couple of days maybe into the third day, you know, or some crazy outdoors. Each trip that I took, I dunno as this guy, I don't even do that. I'm the indoor champ period. I haven't done it in a long time. Hey, can't, I'll never can't to my life. Yeah. We got so much flack from that. Uh, what one episode, I don't know, hundreds of episodes ago where we're like, fuck camping.

Speaker 8:          00:15:58       You're wrong. Like I don't want to go dude. And they're like, but you're missing out. No, I'm not. I've been before. Right. I don't want to go. It doesn't mean I don't like it outside. I like being outside. Yeah. I just don't want to say we've gotten there. I liked it. I like lakes. Yeah. I like stuff. I know I like going outdoors. I just don't want to, I don't see the need to sleep out there for days on end, but that's what's funny to me. Shit out there and stuff. When somebody argues against someone's preferences. Right. You know, it's like, it's like someone arguing with about your food preferences. Yeah. You know, if you're like, I'm meeting the soup and they're like, I hate soup, you should try this. And you're like, but I like it. Right. But they're usually like what I liked.

Speaker 8:          00:16:41       Yeah. Like would I like that? Why don't you like my stuff? I Dunno. I Dunno man. Nope. I like sneaky bought wholesale and this lady's got one, so she set it up. Well, now I know what's going to happen. I think. Oh, I don't know. I'm lost today. I thought I would play with my ass home. No, stick my finger really deep. Far. Wait a minute. She's gonna get shit on her finger. No. Yeah. All up in there. Maybe she's training. Take it out and inhale. Yeah, she published stones as field. Wow. Yeah. Maybe that's a spam. I don't know. Maybe she's trying to train

Speaker 2:          00:17:23       Glen. What's your ass smells like? What's your cock and balls smell like?

Speaker 8:          00:17:27       Yeah. That, that is one of my favorite clips. Learn what your cock and balls.

Speaker 2:          00:17:32       Learn your finger along the crack of your ass. You don't need to finger your whole, you don't want to come back with shit on your finger.

Speaker 8:          00:17:39       But here's somebody that wants to take that advice to task. Maybe you can say, I don't think so, sir. You're not the only one that knows how to run your finger along ass. All right, let's

Speaker 7:          00:17:50       just talk about what sense I'm getting. Oh, what kind of smells or living in my asshole right now, because trust me, there's probably a lot of smells going on in my asshole right now.

Speaker 5:          00:18:04       Talk like you, I mean, I was gonna say one of my sisters, but yeah, she is a girl. This is a woman might be related to you. Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. Oh my God. Seriously? She sounds like you. And then she's like, say, uh, as a lot of smells loud that here is a tribal tattoo. That's a neat, let's see here is my sister. Oh my God. Seriously. And then here's this lady. Seriously, seriously. Oh my God. Seriously. Oh Man. So is that it's like you think she's got some real smells, you know, I'm not so worried about the smells. I'm worried about that tribal tat that she has around her arm. That kind of

Speaker 7:          00:18:55       Barb wire nineties. My own included. Yeah. And if you're watching this, you probably love asked smell too.

Speaker 5:          00:19:04       Oh, so this is an f smell video? Like that's like, yeah. What did you think she thought maybe she was just somebody who has, you know, sexual videos up. I didn't know it was like specific. She goes, if you're watching this, you'd like asked smells. This is cool. From an ass smell. Yes. I think so. This is a very specific genre. I can't, oh my God. Seriously. I can't imagine this is like generalized. It's all about ass smells. Oh my God, you guys are so disgusting. That was Jane by the way. People sometimes don't know he was doing, uh, which sister is doing the voices, right? You know, or what they're hearing. Yeah, that's Jane. Yeah. Maria. I don't know. Can we find them? Maria thing to do the difference. Fingers,

Speaker 9:          00:19:48       cut the bomb vest on and like throw myself out because I'm basically on map hat with the lifestyle. It's very fucking healthy lifestyle. He asked me,

Speaker 5:          00:19:56       they kind of sound the first half of that. Yeah, that's real. Yeah, it's different. It's a faster cadence. Much faster. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So let's get back to this stinky ass hole. These ladies here, real curious

Speaker 7:          00:20:10       about it. Something Raunchy. Yeah. Intoxicating. Seriously. Someone can sit on my face all day with her ass and I wouldn't mind sitting in someone else's space, smothering with, smothering them with my dirty, smelly asshole.

Speaker 5:          00:20:30       She kind of talks like you kind of has, well this is kind of vocal fry or so, right? Yeah. I mean, do you think she talks like me? Yeah. Like I feel like you two could be a nice pair in a way. I mean, she was nasty. She had nasty as fuck. But you're like, you're, you're open to nasty like that, you know, I dunno if I would be farting or when he named Justin Myself. Uh, I don't know if I would necessarily be into the ass male aspect of, of the relationship with her. Like if she was like, I didn't shower days wants to smell, but she's inside of my ass. But she's definitely got kind of a Karen vibe to her. Yeah. I mean she's, she's a nasty bitch for sure.

Speaker 5:          00:21:14       She's a crystal or a Shandy. She's gnarliest. Fuck Trish. She's kind of a Trish. Trish that Karen. Yeah. Karen is broken, but she's not this damaged this girl. A Trish. Sure. She is a little more sophisticated. And Karen though. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I thought Tricia was trashy or my mind. No, Tris thinks he has a shot. Remember? No, Karen thinks she has a shot. Trish doesn't trick Tricia's trashier than Karen. No, I don't think so. Have I messed up my alter ego? I think so. Yeah. Yeah. That's not it. Um, all right, let's see what this, uh, yeah, cause it's so cold in here. I feel sick because I'm warm under my sweatshirt and then the 74, it's freezing. Freezing. You feels like studios, there's cold air around. It keeps studios in the 60s always. I wore this white shirt today is because I knew it was cold out and I knew you would still turn on the AC. It's not, it's not clean. That's why I wore this, because I put my hood up for him. His lights that generate heat in here.

Speaker 7:          00:22:17       Yes. It's not as nice. Why don't we stop? No, please don't. No, you want me to sue other my panties all over your face. You inhale. It's gotta be real stake here. How do you know if she's telling the truth?

Speaker 5:          00:22:39       I don't. I wonder. That same thing. Yeah, she's lying. The two to three day thing could be. I don't think she really is into it the way she pretends to be. You know?

Speaker 7:          00:22:51       Oh Jesus. Fuck. Are we done with this yet? I mean, my stomach's hurting from watching this. It smells stronger then I thought I would smell. Oh Wow. It's like a combination of a Raunchy ass and sweet shits now, but in a good way. You know? Not Dirty Shit.

Speaker 5:          00:23:14       Oh my God. You guys are so disgusting.

Speaker 7:          00:23:16       Let's see what's happening. This is blurred. Blurred this hall. No, you get all the natural smells of my asshole. I mean, she's really doing it. Yeah, I know. I get it. A little coercing cause my finger is dry, but I don't want to get all the real smells.

Speaker 5:          00:23:39       That's the important thing. The real smells. Oh, okay.

Speaker 7:          00:23:42       Oh, oh fuck. Um, no. You know what? She's authentic. That's what I respect. Sweetness. Do Smell. I can't, we can't fake this level. So if you're one of her followers, that's my girl. She's not as my jam. Christina's Janice.

Speaker 5:          00:24:05       She's authentic. I believe her now. I wasn't, I wasn't convinced when she showed us her, she spread them and then I wasn't convinced when she was sniffing her panties. I do feel like in order to be the kind of girl you put your finger in your butt and that smell and then describe the smell. You're committed. Like you're, you're in it. You're in it, you're in it. You're real. She's real. She's real. She's real.

Speaker 7:          00:24:27       No thanks asshole. Yeah, she's three days

Speaker 8:          00:24:36       crazy laugh. She's, she's a crazy lady. Crazy. She's crazy. What do you, things like the data, right? Right, right. Nobody dates her. No one on one dates hurts. People start to date or, and then it doesn't go that long. No.

Speaker 7:          00:24:49       How long before you realize how crazy she is? But it's also something good. It's just raunchy ass and shit smell. I mean that's basically what it is. And I fucking love it and I don't care. And I know you love it too. I'm going to throw us too.

Speaker 5:          00:25:06       She is gnarly getting that Hashtag. Uh, what do you think it, how long before, how long do you think

Speaker 7:          00:25:17       Rhonchi ass and shit smell?

Speaker 5:          00:25:20       Do you think she leads with us? Like is this, she has to meet people on like fetish site. I don't know if she leaves

Speaker 8:          00:25:26       is with this, but she doesn't, she doesn't completely mask it either. I think she's the kind of person who you're having dinner, right? Talking about this and that. And then she might be like, I like stinky stuff. It's smelly cheeses. Like she might lead you into or she'll say something like, I didn't put on deodorant today. Right. And then you're like, oh, you know, that's okay. Do you like that you don't like what? There's a Dwayne reed across the street if you want to go there. And then she's like, I don't want to buy any. I'm saying, do you like the way that smells? And you're like, oh, I don't think so. Then she's like, I like doing my fucking asshole smells. And you're like, we should probably get the cheque. Yeah. Yeah. It does go down like that.

Speaker 5:          00:26:10       Yeah. You think she drops it on the first date though? Yeah. I think when you have a fetish, uh, this real, you gotta Let, he's not playing games. She's real

Speaker 7:          00:26:20       full note. A lot of smells going on in my asshole right now.

Speaker 5:          00:26:24       You see that too? Like try a lot of smells going on in my ass asshole. But for different reasons. Not for sexual, I don't say I don't think go and I want to smell each one of them on my finger. And you're usually, you say that when you have to shower, you're like, oh my sticky asshole. Yes. Thank you.

Speaker 8:          00:26:40       But that her finger would have brown on it. It didn't, it didn't know God. Interesting observation. It did not. Well yeah cause that was another level of gnarly that I thought was coming, you know, wait, she didn't get shit on her fingers and she fingered her bottle so that the pup play guys kind of off. And you think yeah, but maybe, I don't know. Maybe she just has like a cleaner pothole. She's a girl. She's a girl or a way gnarlier she could have even, you know, tried to remove some inner brown. Who knows.

Speaker 5:          00:27:09       Well, speaking of dudes being gnarly, a while ago we gave some advice to a young gentleman about what to do about a B hall shaves. He writes in, I wrote you a couple of weeks ago asking if I should do some maintenance down under after listening to your words of wisdom, I made the decision to bic my be whole. I didn't go with the waxing because I didn't know if I was committing to a good thing. Well it was a game changer. Uh, just like you had said, my cleanup game is pretty fucking tight right now. Just a few wipes and done. There is the sweat issue that you mentioned, but that's a welcome trade off. I was surprised to notice how my farts smell different now to kind of sloppy sounding like a fat Guy Fart. I also changed my diet as you suggested by removing most of the carbs and almost all sugar. That's made a huge difference in my life in many ways. I feel like a new man and I can't thank you enough. Fuck Dan Pena. My life coach is the one and only undisputed water champion Tommy Bond.

Speaker 8:          00:28:11       Thanks. And I bow and thank you for your thanks. Well it's neat on this show and we can help people. It is cool. And you know, I, it was easy to give that advice. I thought that it was a, the idea was one that I would go for and I think that the Diet changes, you know, it's modest. It's not too crazy to do that. Change is key to farts. Oh yeah. And the heat, they probably, he said they feel diff or they smell different or sound different. Sound different. That's right. The hair is gone. So it's just really going against skin. It's in the air and the skin is, it says what girl fart sound like. Yeah. Girl forests on different, yeah, for sure. So I'm, I'm very proud of him though for doing it and I, you know, I encourage people to at least take that hair removal for a spin. See if it's something that feels right to you, is fun to you.

Speaker 5:          00:29:04       Well, there's lots of benefits. You got a cleaner wipe. Yeah. Uh, it is sweaty like he said, but you know, trade off. I'd say the cleanup thing is, is

Speaker 8:          00:29:13       massive. The cleanups, the whole point, everything else is, uh, you know, has his, uh, you know, uh, whatever effect of it. But it's not, it's not, it's all about the cleanup challenging cause when you're a hairy man, that is, I can't imagine the suffering. I can't imagine shitting into the top of your head and then being like, seriously, and then just wiping the fish shit off of it. And you're like, how long is it going to take? I don't know, 45 minutes. Speaking of, speaking of that an we got bringing water to Poop, it's called Christina is wrong. Here's the email Solomon get this straight Christians uh, yeah is freaking out about Dj Dad Mal bringing a water bottle into the stall but her jam is to wash it off of her. How do you say rectum in the shower. I guess there is some risk of airborne brown particles attaching to the small surface area exposed on a water him after the bottle cap is removed, but that's only a short amount of time and the risk of contamination is negligible and any non juggle, oh person would ditch that water bottle after bringing it into the shit or obviously chugging most of the water before bringing it into the hydrate water champ.

Speaker 8:          00:30:24       Is it lifestyle? He probably starts out saying it doesn't smell, it doesn't burn it and greasy, I mean step on my balls, but brown should not be washed off onto a surface. You routinely walk barefoot in a puddle of water unless you are bleaching your shower every day, but get your life only using dove body wash. So main mommy. Tina was suspiciously shocked and couldn't barely recognize buttons after hearing this pro level move. I'm no professional but sounds like a subconscious retaliation effort from a personality of lesser character. I mean it's basically f a r t level hypocrisy. Wow. If you swap out poop particles for curse words for, for curse words, for analysis, you feel me? Smart and final mark

Speaker 5:          00:31:11       smartify armor. Yeah. Well first of all, mark, uh, list off a r t allow me to uh, clarify my position on Tom's usage of the water bottle to clean off her ass hole.

Speaker 8:          00:31:23       He is right by the way. And that you don't take a, I'm a taking a full bottle of water and cracking it to do this. What are you doing? This is a like, let's say an airport. You have, you buy your bottle of water, you're drinking it. Let's say you're probably two thirds of the way through it. I gotta take a dump. I bring that in there and it helps me clean up.

Speaker 5:          00:31:45       Now you're using like the maple syrup top, you know, the kind that's like the power squirter. Is that what you're doing? And you're, you're kind of supporting your asshole or your wedding. The toilet paper. Toilet paper. Well, my only thing just go like this. You pour water into, now you have wet toilet paper. Okay. To wash the top of your head off that you shit on my own way. Uh, my, my issue with it was that I was worried about the shame of caring in a bottle of water into the shitter. I just think it's odd when people carry zero shame, um, food items are edible things into the store would not bring. That's kind of a cheeseburger. I see you like you've got your Mcdonald's, you got your Apple Pie. There is a good idea though to eat that on the Shitter, right?

Speaker 5:          00:32:36       So nasty, nasty. And secondly, I don't do shit to shower anymore because of the total washlet three talking about outside of the house we're talking about, uh, why haven't, I haven't shit to showered in awhile, but we're talking about how, so you're, you're, you're at the airport and what do you do? Right. And so that's what I'm saying is it's not an, I don't bring a bottle of water into our home. I'm saying when you're, when you're in public, I guess I'm thinking about the office worker, the person who has to be, I don't think it's that weird rule has to go to like a bottle of water is capped. I know, but it just seems weird. Like I'm going to go to take a shit and then you, you're carrying your bottle of water in the stall with he, you don't think people kind of know?

Speaker 5:          00:33:15       I wouldn't think twice because I used to get wearied just like weird about bringing my iPhone in to take a shit. Like, oh, everybody knows that I'm looking at my iPhone. Oh, when I'm taking a dump, which I would hide it Kinda in my clothes so that people didn't see, I still do. I would carry that water right in. No problem. Right. I, but you're, you're an animal. You don't care about anything. That's true. I wanted to bring this to your attention a as long as we're still on this topic. Yeah. Uh, our good friend Eric, it was his birthday. We bought him a squatty potty using our Amazon banner and go to your mom's house, podcast.com. Click on the banner at the bottom, the homepage to your shopping as you normally would. And I got him a squatty potty. Right. And in Kansas shitty he lives. Yes. Now here's the interesting part is that we've had so many people tell us to use the squatty potty. Yeah. And I've been reluctant because like I take healthy browns, I don't need the assistance of anything. Yeah. Interesting review came in. I'm going to read what he wrote verbatim because I find it that interesting. Hold on

Speaker 5:          00:34:15       one moment. One moment. You don't have it prepped for the show or anything and breathe into the mic because that's definitely loving that. I can't find Jesus. Basically he said, sure hour here.

Speaker 5:          00:34:31       Basically he said, well he said that it's good that it comes out faster when you're doing it right. Like you take it faster shit cause your, your knees are up to your chest basically. Right. The problem is it doesn't leave much time for reading, for texting, for catching up on, you know, Instagram, Twitter, or whatever. That's the problem. So part of the fun of shitting is really catching up on emails, texting people back. Definitely texting your friends, you're taking a shit right now. That kind of stuff. It becomes a necessity. Oh, how's it takes a while. So it really does make sense in that you, I'm sorry, what becomes a necessity? The iPhone. Yeah, because you're like, this isn't going to come out and in half a second I'm going to sit here for a second and then you get the engine going. But if you're, if you're doing that, maybe you're happier that you have more time, you know, in other words, you, you feel like it's going to take some time. That's why you bring your iPhone. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I like to take my time. I like to catch a real dilemma though. I understand. Yeah. Because on the one hand, I like the efficiency of the squatty potty. I liked the idea of, yeah. But

Speaker 8:          00:35:38       then again, I kind of enjoy my, um, you know, relaxed BMS. I like, I like texting everybody that I'm shitting. Anything. You already made your decision. I don't think you're going to do it. No. Um, I should tell this.

Speaker 1:          00:35:57       Are you out on this?

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       jam. I love it. I love sinkholes or dry dry sockets or whatever the fuck. Oh my God, I had an awesome brunch. You did. God, I haven't had brunch in forever. Tell me about bright. Well, cause our baby jeans is up at six in the morning. Yeah. And then he's down by that first nap by nine. It's not really, there's no brunch window. I mean I guess we could do it when he wakes up from that or did it in Chicago. Yeah. What did you have?

Speaker 8:          00:44:57       Well, first of all, I'll tell you the whole weekend was bananas. Yeah. Chicago's like banana city. No, but I mean I did it started in Green Bay and then I went to the trois. And then how has the trois, my, my former, uh, had a great time. I was at the adjacent place. Royal Oak Music venue. Yeah. And uh, crowds were amazing. So cold in here. I need a hot beverage. Yeah. That, that was a blast. But then on Sunday I was with a j Elvis Weinstein came with me and, and then Lewis Lee who, uh, lives in Minneapolis came down and we had brunch at this place called Shaws and it was just delightful. Nothing like a killer Brunch, man. What did you have? I had everything. I was off. Fuck the points. Fuck the points. Yeah, he did it. Yeah. Sunday morning. I'm like, um, Sunday. Funday man, here's the thing. Ever since I've been a more moderate and the focus eater, even off the rails, isn't that far off.

Speaker 5:          00:46:03       Yeah, I agree. Because you know, like a, it's not going to feel that great. That's the, yeah, the whole thing

Speaker 8:          00:46:09       want to like hurt myself. Right. So I remember when of my way there, I told Josh, I go, I said, dude, I'm going deep in this shit today. Like, yeah. And what does that mean for you? Exactly? Going deep. Just A, I'm going to have some sugar and I'm going to have some carbs. I'm, I'm not going to be like, what is, what is that? I'm just going to eat it. But pacifically what are the items that you will order off the menu? I love, you know, I'm a breakfast maniac, so this is uh, the, the Brunch is like a brunch buffet with ton at this place. It was phenomenal. So I just wanted to get like a waffle waffle state too. The cool thing is they did many ones there.

Speaker 5:          00:46:47       Minis are the best. That's the thing I learned is that it's not even about having a crazy amount. It's like getting that taste again. Still want to make something. Well, here's what puts a taste in my mind. Here's what I would do with the mini waffles is it, get as many of those on your plate as you can and then change up the situations on all of them. Dude, you do like chocolate and whipped cream on one. Yup. And then you do your fruits on another. Know what I'm saying? You got some Nutella.

Speaker 8:          00:47:14       There I go. I have that. I have some, some scraps had crab let, cause I have a lot of as a seafood crab legs. But I mean, you know, they give you a, you know, a moderate portion. Yeah, I had my little mini waffle, some breakfast sausage. Yeah. Um, I dunno, a couple of others, like I said, gramps, couple egg things and you're just like, oh, I'm totally good. So you feel like you, you had, uh, you went off the rails, but it wasn't that crazy. You know? And what I've learned too is that if I go off the rails early in the day, yeah, it's better. I don't eat a lot at night. I know I have this stuff I take after I ate that. Does that work? I mean, it's supposed to work and then I asked, I exercise after too. Wow. So you're good.

Speaker 8:          00:48:02       So you do you balance. Yeah. And then I do, you know, I don't fuck around the rest of the week. I don't like that you pick one day to go off the rails and then you clean it up. It was, otherwise you're going to have problems, you know? You know what I found too is that it's not as fun to do the things I used to do. Yeah. It's not as fun because I knew like, I'm just going to get fucking fad. Yeah. Not Worth it to get fat and shitty again. Just cause I like eating. I like drinking a lot of wine. I've had to like really like curb all that, you know, late night, evening, start looking at sugar and things. It blows your mind if you start, if you start being sugar conscious, it's really blows your mind. Just because we were trying to make these, uh, these Quito pancakes, um, the Keto friendly ones, and of course one of the components that you have to get a sugar free syrup, but it also has to not have, so not only can it be, it has to be sugar free.

Speaker 8:          00:49:03       It can't have the sweeteners that affect you the way sugar does. So it's a very specific brand. So I was in whole farts and I asked if they had it and they go, no, we don't have it. And just out of curiosity, I picked up a regular maple syrup and looked at the sugar grams. You know, how many sugar grams are in one serving. Dot. Get your life. I can't even imagine. 53 grams. Yeah. That's like, uh, more than a candy bar. It's more like a snickers bar, Ryan. It's, and then having a little bananas stick to a serving of maple syrup. First of all, whoever makes the servings is fucking bullshit on any product ever. Who just eats, ate potato chips or who has it? I know spoon if, if they didn't, if they didn't tell you that, then the back of every level would terrify half a serving is what that shit is because sugar is the one that only up, I think next year it changes for the first time we're next to the grants.

Speaker 8:          00:50:01       That doesn't show you that the percentage of the daily value you see sodium, fat, protein, it shows you the grams and then a percentage, 15% 25% sugar, it'll say 53 grams, no percentage. And that's because of the sugar lobby, but getting fucked and next year that's neat when the business can fuck with your health like that. So yeah, there's a little bit, just a tiny little bit. Yeah. And if you don't watch your sugar, that's right up like Bert or you get the sugar beet is, yeah, the B. This, um, are you thinking of maybe changing who you are?

Speaker 13:         00:50:45       [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         00:50:55       it's so good to know that my friends have my back through anything. It's just always good to have that friend reassurance. And especially for me it's like don't talk to people outside of my group.

Speaker 5:          00:51:03       Well that's going on here. Did you actually is one of my ex specially vocal fry? Did you see what his um, his lower third was where they call it the Kyron

Speaker 8:          00:51:13       and it says nasal alien. Right, right. So Vinny,

Speaker 14:         00:51:18       no, that my friends have my back through anything. It's just always going to have that friend reassurance. And especially for me because I don't talk to too many people outside of my car.

Speaker 5:          00:51:25       Do you order espresso? Of course not. You know me at all. We in him auto express, so I order, I uh, I always give an extra stair to the person that says, oh my God, me too. I judged them so harsh. So we went to the hotel and the lady was like, this is your espresso machine. She checked us in and I said, where's the machine? An Espresso machine. I love when somebody has poor grammar in front of one of us. And then we ask them on to keep saying it. You're going, yeah, what can you make with this? Just expresses,

Speaker 8:          00:52:00       um, but anyways, back to Vinny. Vinny, he's doing some interesting things with the look. The makeup is really intense. It looks like maybe midway through a performance of cats, the musical, it's like there's an a, there's a, a costume change cause there's very detailed and, and very profound levels of black eye makeup with it's not just black and like, uh, um, it's, it's kind of artistically applied so that it looks like the eyes wrap further back up along the temple. Well, I don't know if you have another clip, but maybe, oh, there's a, yeah, there's a lot going on.

Speaker 14:         00:52:42       Me. I don't want to be that, like that woman. I don't want to be that muscular man. I just want to be this alien. I want to be able to like turn people's heads. I want you to be terrified me. But I also want you to think I'm beautiful because that's what I'm attracted to. When people

Speaker 8:          00:52:59       see this. This is interesting

Speaker 5:          00:53:02       why? It seems pretty common to me. Just your everyday kind of guy.

Speaker 8:          00:53:06       The Psych Guy Space Alien, Babe. I'm sorry. I forgot your Pronoun. Your space. This is, yeah. Oh, what's your pronouns? Yeah, well there's, there's a lot going on. I want to terrify people though. It almost makes me feel like this person wants attention, but I wouldn't

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       know. I wouldn't stoop so low as to what are you doing? Wait, are you saying that this person, hold on, let me get this straight. You're saying that this person isn't right in the head and they just want attention even if it's negative attention. What's Your Pronoun? Wait is out. Is that what you're implying? That this isn't, we shouldn't support this young person and and becoming a nasal alien, a nasal alien. How dare you? You're anal, anal, your alien phobic right now I know and I should be open to alien. You should be open to everything in this era of dairy.

Speaker 14:         00:54:01       Tell me what the gender of an alien person will be like. A question from Sam's friend has a point. The reason why I call myself alien is because alien is never associated with sex. It's like genderless. It's sex less. Yeah. And that's why I started saying alien. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:54:20       I like that. You do? Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know if you'd like where you were about to hear next though. Cause this next part, it's not a lot to like

Speaker 14:         00:54:29       I went in also to see if actually I can do some of everything. Uh, yeah. That, that was the first thing. Genderless. Really just have like enough and just not have any sex for the rest of my life. Like you can't even get like, it's like, it's like there's nothing there like

Speaker 6:          00:54:44       a mannequin.

Speaker 5:          00:54:46       Just be like, Hey, hi. How are you? What's your name? What's Your Pronoun? Hey, will you remove everything and leave a nub?

Speaker 6:          00:54:59       Maybe.

Speaker 5:          00:55:01       Maybe just a mental health counseling would help. Well it sounds like someone's got a problem with their PP. Some something happen. There's, there's some, something's wrong and someone needs to see a shrink before he removes his genuine. Why wait till after. I do hope they have to go through some kind of counseling before you remove your genitals, Dick and balls off. I want it. I want my nub, I want to be a space alien. So I, I, I want to terrify people for them having to be like, wow, that's pretty attractive too. It's a very complicated one. Most trained psychologist and they'd be like, we're going to keep you here overnight. And you were to start this again in the morning. Yeah, it's a lot. Uh,

Speaker 14:         00:55:46       this niche right here is about a change to a world. I know. It means a lot coming from, you know, my friends are these creatures that the, I've handpicked and found in different places in times in my life. They're probably the realest people I know out of everyone I met, which speaks of volumes.

Speaker 5:          00:56:02       What show is this? Um, I'm not sure. It's on e it's on e I. F I think it's like botched plastic surgery dudes. I know, I know he was on that show. Sorry, I dunno. Somehow I came down botched. Yeah, it is what it is. Yeah. Yeah. So I think this may have been on the your mom's house face book group page where this originated from. And then I went down this rabbit hole of this guy's videos and it turns out he has been transitioning into an alien since he was like 16. Like he's, he's always hated himself and the way he looks and he really, really, really wants to be, and he looks even crazier now. Like that's narrative now. He black, he blacks out his eyes so that they're all black. It's fucking terrifying dude. You hear the similarities though, between Zeeman, Garth.

Speaker 15:         00:56:52       Yeah. I like that. I like that. I like that. I like that

Speaker 5:          00:57:01       pink haired Lady. It's funny. I like that though. I really like that. Uh, so I've been following Garth on Instagram and the g g sorry. Yeah. And they've been teaching him, he's been doing those, uh, videos that are only up for like the day, like those, what do they call the snapchats? Yeah, basically on Instagram. And they taught you start. Yeah. And they've taught him link in bio or swipe up. So now he'll be like, um, um, first it's the fake. Yeah. It's the fake smile. Like, hi, I'm here right now. I'm at south by southwest, swap up, swap up. Like, he's so bad at it. It's so great. I was watching him today just like cringing. He's so bad at it. Yeah. It's just not as thing. You know, he, you know, he's a successful singer. I get that he entertains millions of people, but the social media, he needs like a coach. He needs someone to help him be more natural at that stuff. Yeah, he does. Because it's all about authenticity on that medium. You know, it's like,

Speaker 8:          00:58:04       um, also I wanted to point out that, uh, every week now after we do the podcast, if you go to our Facebook page, it's facebook.com/your mom's house podcast. We were doing a live video, a studio m at studio m and a we, you know, we talked to you guys, we answer questions, uh,

Speaker 5:          00:58:27       because it's all about you. You keep talking. You, y'all did it. Y'All did. Y'All day. [inaudible] so many maps. Oh, there you go. Even the dog says, yeah, he hair. She goes, thank you. That's all.

Speaker 8:          00:58:45       So, um, so they're teaching him to be like a real

Speaker 5:          00:58:50       yeah, they're, they're doing a makeover, I think of his social media. Yeah. And the Instagram's getting a little better. Like he started to do more frequent posts, but the snapchats, the, your story parts, they're there. They need work. Let's just put it that way. Cause he, every time teaching the ultimate Dad Boehner had seen there's nothing, no better environment for a dad boner. Then technology, you know, they're all thumbs. They don't so excitable. Yeah. And the thing is too is like you can tell somebody like, look at the guy. Oh God. But you can tell someone's like, okay, Garth and right. Go cause then there's always a pause before he starts his thing. Yeah. I got real excited. He's like, hey yeah, and waves. Yeah. Hey guys. Oh, we're just hanging out. Did he? Oh Gee. I don't want to say what's up to Bozeman, Montana. Yeah. Great time going to blow your city. Excited about that. Going to Shreveport, Louisiana. Excited about that. You're like, you're not excited about going to Sri port. Shut out crap and energy when she has.

Speaker 2:          00:59:56       Okay, dad.

Speaker 6:          01:00:00       Right. We're at south by south. I'm going to show you the one that's made out of bamboo. Look at this night. This has a really nice sound to, this one is made by drying out the bamboo poking holes through walls, dividing sections that, oh shit. Close that up yet. Poking holes through all those kind of putting the beans in. Got It. And then the beans go from one section to the next. No kidding. Draping down and making it right. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:00:29       That's the other thing I like about this. It's boring, but he's also excited. They gag Boehner. Slash. Board. Wow. Right. You don't get that a lot crosses. It crosses two worlds came together. Borings

Speaker 6:          01:00:41       and dad like all on hold on your pants.

Speaker 2:          01:00:45       Are you going to come and you're right. Oh Wow. We hear it pretty nice. Huh?

Speaker 5:          01:00:54       Oh, the other way. Now he showed it to you like it was two tits like you think of the east. Yeah. It was super stoked about you. She'll go in the next room with you. Thank you sir. But that he has to explain to me how the rain stick work. I mean, look, if you've been in a mall since 1990 you fucking seen these. Yeah. It'd be a real idiot nights to know how the rain stick fucking works. Yeah, it has.

Speaker 6:          01:01:17       Keep it going and definitely if you use the turning motion and explained earlier and levering back and forth, no shit.

Speaker 2:          01:01:26       Okay. Now you can try it the other way. Wait a minute. You made a ton of those.

Speaker 5:          01:01:33       Well of the beans go down that way. No Shit.

Speaker 2:          01:01:36       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:01:36       you gotta be kidding me. He's like, yeah, you can just keep doing that for days that it won't stop making that noise. Dad's been smoking dope. I think so. Yeah. He's high. He's a dope dad.

Speaker 2:          01:01:46       Definitely. I get home.

Speaker 6:          01:01:48       We've got a few on for days like that. Oh Wow. I don't have to worry. You won't drive your neighbor's crazy with this instrument.

Speaker 2:          01:01:56       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:01:56       I find even an answer. Is it really an instrument? I mean, who plays the rain stick? I fucking guy guidance. He'll be, he plays that hacky sack lifestyle. The fucking guy kiss up. Thinking about that space. Alien can, I now are fine, but I was so attracted.

Speaker 2:          01:02:13       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:02:14       Okay. Okay. Should complete, what'd you rather?

Speaker 2:          01:02:17       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:02:18       What'd you

Speaker 5:          01:02:19       take a cruise? You're sharing a room with the anal finger. Stinky butt hole lady or the space alien kid. You're in a fucking cruise ship room for a week. Um, you got to have meals together. You do your shuffle board. You're being go activities together. You guys are together. You're a couple for a week on a cruise ship. I think space aliens probably easier to hang out with. I don't think so. I think he is a vortex of emotional need. Yeah, that's true. He's going to rail age. She's nasty. She's like living with a Frat Guy, but the alien guy, he's going to drain you emotionally. She's like, come over and just sit on your fucking face. And he's like a, an emo 13 year old girl. Yeah, I guess you're right. But I'm just thinking like what if the whole time she's just like some of my fingers smell it.

Speaker 5:          01:03:13       Yeah. But you've been to college. Isn't that what that is when dudes hanging out, I guess, is that what you and your slap Dick Friends did all the time? Smelling fingers, lighting farts, guys do. I thought, I dunno. I just feel like it's more pervasive with her. I think it's going to be, there is no joke in it. She's like fucking smell like shit. Yes Karen. It smells like shit. So my panties, something like fresh shit does. You're saying that you think she's relentless with it? Like she can't go to another topic and then, and then as the week progressed she's like stay for with no shower. Nasty and you're like, yeah, and you guys are on a cruise ship and it's like the Caribbean cruise, so it's real sweaters and the room's small. We got one of those. We've got the inside room, there's no balcony, no window.

Speaker 5:          01:04:03       Now the alien guy. The problem is you're going to have to walk around with him a lot and people are going to be like, what's up with those two? And you're gonna have a lot of eyeballs on you and he's going to make a big spectacle of himself every time he go eat somewhere. Oh My god, why is everybody staring at me? And then he's going to do that thing of like, God, there's someone knowing God, don't assume my pronoun. He can get old person's death. Is that a man or a woman? Let me, he'll be like, I'm neither God is it so hard ass? My Pronoun Bitch, I'm a fucking nasal alien. He's going to have a shirt made up that says that the, of course bitch, I'm a nasal alien and then he's going to, it's going to be really embarrassing. Whereas the asshole girl, she's not an embarrassing on a public public.

Speaker 5:          01:04:46       Yep. She'll be, she'll be annoying in the cabin but not in front of everybody else. Yeah, we're in public. People will walk by and go, oh, what does it smell? Hassles stinks. Horrible. Oh I guess she would make me laugh more. I think she would make me laugh cause he kind of reminds you of your sister's on ready. So it's like, so maybe I would, but then again, do I want to cruise with my sisters for a week? It'd be maybe, can we make it a three day cruise? Well, let's say if you had to choose between two occupations, one being you're the nasal alien and you have to go through life trans transitioning into an alien or your job is to not shower and do those asshole committee pretty good. You're all, this is your skill, thank you and Milo skill and my other, would you rather champ would you say thank you.

Speaker 5:          01:05:43       It's your job and you can still do comedy but these jobs might, I would definitely do asshole videos, finger my asshole videos and them over over becoming a nasal alien. Of course. Well I feel like the nasal alien, you just have to wipe the makeup off. No, I'm saying I'm transitioning to be a nasal alien that's going to occupy more of my time than you think. That is such a full time Gig. Of course transitioning and he was like, we have to give this guy a fucking show. They really should actually, I'd watch that Guy Shell. It exists obviously. Just on, I thought that was an episode about, Oh, I think you're right. Okay. Yeah, no, this was a segment to a, a different show. But that kid needs his own reality show. I'd love to watch what's going on mentally there. Doctor drew needs to intervene. This flickering light. Unreal. Ah, ah, ah. Wait a minute. So wait, what did you, you decided on being the ass.

Speaker 4:          01:06:59       Wait, aren't you ruined my life, but both will ruin your life.

Speaker 5:          01:07:13       I'm trying to do a dental update and I totally realize that you didn't explain. What do you mean it's going to ruin your life? Both. Well, why would your asshole vids row in your life? You know what's another one? Both where people say like idea. Both idea. We'll say idea. God, that's fucking terrible. Okay. Um, I, it'll ruin your life to do these assholes. That's why. Well, because I heard an interview with Tara Patch or I can, she made a great point. She's like, if you want to do porn, be prepared for everybody in your life to know your pastor, your Stepdad, your kids. You went to first grade with everyone's gonna find out. So as a ruin your life though, that wouldn't ruin your life. Your mother knowing that she'd be like, you've always been nasty. What's the big deal? You don't think your, you think your son wants to know that his dad does asshole smelling

Speaker 8:          01:08:16       videos. I think it's fine. I think it's not a big deal.

Speaker 5:          01:08:20       You don't think that's going to mess up his school life and, and I mean I look the alien thing is way worse or until you know, I think it's fine.

Speaker 8:          01:08:29       It's just an asshole. You're just, you're just being nasty. I wouldn't say it's quite like porn. I mean it is. There was the one blurt out video where she's clearly fingering her asshole. Yeah. So putting that out there would be a little uncomfortable.

Speaker 5:          01:08:44       Wait a minute. But what about our marriage? Like I'm going to have to smell your asshole. Why does it smell it? Cause I live with you. I sleep next to you. Shine for days and days. Oh yeah. You'll get used to it though. I don't want to get used to it. I know it's not desirable, but we signed up for this. This is our life now. This is what we're doing. I guess it's still better than being an alien. I, yeah, I take the asshole stuff over alien too. It's not that weird. It's just like the gate. It's just like the gays. The gays do the same thing, you know? God Damn Dude.

Speaker 8:          01:09:16       Um, all right, so I was trying to read these dental updates we got. Oh, I have one too. You do? Yeah, of course. All right here

Speaker 4:          01:09:27       can be back in the mood.

Speaker 8:          01:09:36       All right. Just wanted to give you a dental update. I recently went to the dentist after not seeing one in almost 15 years. Holy Fuck. Last time I went was when I was 12 oh my God. I had to get a baby tooth bold. The dentist forgot to give me Nova came before we started pulling.

Speaker 5:          01:09:54       Woo.

Speaker 8:          01:09:54       Told me to stop whining when I told him how bad it hurts. Oh my God. Since then, I've been terrified of the dentist. After listening to your show for several years, I finally told my jeans up, got my life and went to a dentist. Besides my teeth being all buttery and needing a thorough cleaning, I had no cavities. Alright. Thank you for your constant dental shaming. It's just as a fact of effective as fat shaming. Just like the gays Matt. Wonderful Map. Yeah. Um, we have another one, but go ahead. Go ahead.

Speaker 5:          01:10:29       Big Update for me. I'm getting my new crown this Thursday. Today's Tuesday. And it's been misery for the last two weeks because I've had to chew on the left side of my mouth, which is when they fucking tell you to do right. And now what happened was I got a piece of meat stuck behind the temp crown. Oh God. And they tell you not to floss. What do you do? But it was hurting. It was really hurting. And so, you know what I said, fuck it. And I fought, I flossed and one was, it sucked. It didn't pop up just a hour or two. I was like trying to get it out with my fingers and then I just lost in it and it didn't pop off. So I've been flossing.

Speaker 8:          01:11:05       I have an idea. Yeah, go ahead. What about doing a video like the asshole video lady about your teeth and how you don't and

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       you make a video like that. You go like, Oh, I'm not going to fly. I haven't flossed in days. I bet it smells real bad. You run your teeth, your finger around your teeth. Got It. Thank you. Thank you. Why don't you like don't want to do that? It's disgusting. I first of all, I can't go a day without flossing. I think that's revolting. I don't want to do that. Yeah. Okay. What would you rather do? The flossing video or the dirty ass whole video. Of course, the flossing video. Seriously, you would rather do the asshole video because I would rather have a dirty ass hold on a dirty mouth. I get a finger it and smell it. My ass was pretty clean. Dude. Are you hearing the nonsense that you're spewing right now? My butthole because it's hairless. I, because I bid day wash it every day.

Speaker 5:          01:12:05       It's fine, dude. Like I could skip three shower days because I have a day so much. Damn, I didn't realize you're fucking out of your God damn fine and my bowel movements are pretty clean. They pinch right off. There's not a lot of remnants right now. Just some air that comes out of there and it's not real sweet. Like she was saying, it's really, really bad and I think the idea that you're trying to sell that you would do that over a dental video is crazy. You can taste all the time and when I have a floss, I just feel dirty. I don't think that you would finger your asshole and then and then smell it for a while on video. Yes. No, you wouldn't then do the flossing. You're lying. Why would I lie? The philosophy was so disgusting. A minute, wait a minute. Didn't we just say that you shouldn't shut on people for their preferences.

Speaker 5:          01:12:51       I don't like to go camping. This is the same thing trying to convince this one's dumb, Tommy being hurtful. Now I think you should not be hurtful smelling dirty floor. I'm like, God, you guys are so disgusting grosser than smelling a shit. No one believes that. What's not to believe in my mind. Fingering your ass home dirty food over dirty plaque in your mouth. I'm just going to jump over to the next one because this is so, but I'm not even done with my dental updates. So I'm going to get a new crown and then as a treat, I've decided to have my teeth whitened at the dentist's office after my crowd. So when I come home next, oh no, sorry. Thursday I'm at brand new crown. A zoomed out there because I realized the one flaw and the Gel whitening when you do it yourself is that you can't gauge how wide it's going to be like it sucks. It takes too long. Just fucking try it this way and see if I like it. Good. Are you doing it the same when we went to the same dentist? I like that guy. Yeah, I like him too. We'll see Dr Farts. He's good. It's not a, here's another email. What's up? Mommies? I had to send a dental update after mommy. Tina talked about replacing her badly fit crown. It's the worst time, eight twice a week. Flosser thanks to the show twice a week, pump it up to once a day and then

Speaker 8:          01:14:11       we'll talk. I put off getting a crown over a root canal for over six years. Every cleaning my dentist would ask if I wanted to spend 1500 on a crown and I would ask if it was necessary. The answer was always, you know, of course whenever you have the money. I never knew this was code for fucking immediately. I recently went to a new dentist chain called modern dentistry and it was the shit I tried to put off the crown again and they said the tooth was developing micro fractures. Ooh, I said it was in a hurry and they convinced me to stay with 20% off. Great. Promised a two hour crown. Oh, oh it sounds. He numbed me up, ground the tooth down and scan the shape with a three d scanner or the size of a toothbrush, the design, the crown, the crown in the computer and Oh, they designed the, the crown and the computer and they uh, they machine it in under 30 minutes.

Speaker 8:          01:15:06       I don't know what that means. They even did the general cleaning while I waited on the crown. Oh my God. After installing it, they uh, they show you an x ray of how well it went. I'm telling you this shit is big time jeans. [inaudible] I know you probably trust Steve Harvey's Dennis to keep your shit on fleek when you're squishing nasty molding goo into your choppers and waiting two weeks for a phone. Remember that you can get your life to not sure when, but you call that a listener for standing up while wiping like a four year old man and I stand with them. Many parents give up on teaching technique at four. We are so lucky to have you and top dog to give higher titer, wiping education to those less fortunate, keeping it in greasy and mom [inaudible] thanks for that Steve Bro. Cheers Kyle. [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          01:15:50       well, Kyle, I wasn't even aware that they could do a crown instantly. Modern dentistry. I know. I thought we were going to somebody modern and I'm, I'm upset now that there was such a thing that I could've done. I would've gladly, I hate waiting two weeks to the temp. It's misery. Terrible. It's misery. Absolutely terrible. But then again, my veneers that I had done really, really nice, took about two weeks as well. And it was, it was well worth it because the guy like hand crafted my teeth. You know what I mean? Yeah. I don't know. I don't fucking know. I don't fucking know.

Speaker 8:          01:16:21       Um, it's been a minute. So what do you say we revisit some, uh, new submissions of hi mommy thing. Oh, I'm so excited. These are my favorites. There are a lot of fun. Here we go

Speaker 8:          01:22:23       I think you were talking about if I want to, I want to remember, I'm not entirely sure, but I want to say we were talking about what happens with people with those, um, and that you said, you know, fuck my whatever. Fuck my stoma and then that became a a drop. Yup. It's always nice. Yeah. People catch you saying dumb shit. Yeah. It becomes a nice little sound, rob. Yeah. I mean, here's a, of course,

Speaker 6:          01:24:08       Many of those, let's say his head whipped around, he was like, oh hi mommy. In a second. I'm just glass on the menu here. You know, I can only see what's his high end type on the corner there. No. F A r t am I knew I got a coupon here for a double, like classic. Could you repeat that?

I think jeans.

Speaker 5:          01:25:27       Wow. I love the Kayla and Michael. Great job. I love the incorporation of a, your act in the very beginning. And then B, I like the, you know, I mean, we haven't had somebody put in a, you know what I mean? You know what I mean? Like, yeah. You know, I also, like he said, I don't want to be fat like burnt bird. He didn't say like Bert. Right. Subtle distinction. And I like that. Really good work. I liked the use of the coupon.

Speaker 5:          01:26:47       By the way, W can we mention that on this episode? Tom and I got dressed today without seeing each other prior. Yeah, I came home after you so I didn't even know what you're wearing. And we both ended up wearing identical outfits today. Black hooded sweatshirt.

Speaker 8:          01:27:03       You were in that a Chola la one. Yeah, I'm wearing the Jamie Young Jamie. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:27:08       Powerful, powerful, powerful sweatshirt. Um, which I bought by the way. Nice support. Yeah. To support. Um, yeah. And we're wearing jeans. You're wearing dad colored Jean. Let me justify these genes. They need a little bit of justification. I don't, I normally don't do light denim. Yeah. But these are specific nineties cuts. But I buy from the lucky brand online. They don't sell them in the stores. They're called the little Maggie's honor. I think that these chains speak for themselves and this, uh, attempt to make them seem like they're acceptable. It should be dismissed. I let you decide. You know what? I'm not, dudes can't wear a light denim. I think girls can rock light denim boys. It's not even cute. It's not even cute, bro. The state rests, your honor. We believe that the evidence show, let the record show, that's brown lock. We used to do brown lock where we would uncover mysteries behind these mysteries.

Speaker 5:          01:28:11       Can we talk about, first of all, I'm surprised we didn't even get there today. You took two shits today. Let's go through them. Um, yeah. Well wait a minute. How do you know about too? Because this morning we were like, are you sure about that? Yeah, I did. I did. I did, but it was, it was, it was on the way. Sorry. Cause it was right before the shower. I got dressed and everything. Yeah, we were talking, we were in the middle of a discussion. Yeah. Like a business discussion. Yeah. And I love this. My favorite thing that you do, like it's a pretty serious discussion and then you just turn around and you walk away and you walk out. And I was like, oh, hello. Yeah, we're not discussing. You're like, I got to shit. Can you tell me you have to ship before you turn her around and walk away.

Speaker 5:          01:28:55       Okay. Um, and then we were eating lunch. Yeah. And I'm still eating. And you're like, I got a shit. Oh, I really got to shit. It was like a little bit like, ah, the second one, by the way, to say I gotta eat alone. You had finished everything on the plane. Yes you did. I was getting a second round of food you saw in the second round snack. Yeah, but it was just, I mean, come on. It was a follow up like a little treat. It wasn't, this is what I'm eating right now. Anyway. I will always want to make the point. The second one was a lot sloppier and messier. Let's talk about it. I'm trying to travel. I made fitness. It was clean food. You know, it was healthy food. There was Kale, there was chicken. Yeah. Felt the far it's coming. It's my new favorite, eh? Eh, I like how she says that I was for, it might be the best one of those. That's a real drawn out. When I like it. He know who I keep thinking about. There's the come lady.

Speaker 5:          01:30:04       I can't get her out of my mother for some reason. She's been stuck in my mind. Yeah. I've come all over my face. I think that her issue with men not wanting to touch their comment and that is not an issue, is that you're trying to say no, it was like when she, when I thought she was just like a, an a lay person and then I find out she's a professional sex worker. It's like, well yeah guys, you know are going to be weird to you that they're calm and everything like this. Not a big deal. Right. What, what's not the big deal guys don't really want to be that close to it. I don't, but then, but the problem is they expect her to be into the com I think is her gripe. But then we'll never even touch his own commerce so many times.

Speaker 5:          01:30:51       She also, did you hear her part of that where she said, or even taste his own, but like even when do you meet? When did any sensible reasonable guy be like, I mean, yeah, I'll taste it. No one does that. No. But it also, and here's my thing with it, it's like, well, if you're a sex worker, it's part of the Gig that someone asks you, hey, will you swallow? I'm assuming you negotiate ahead of a time, I guess what the sex, we're like, hey, will you swallow my come? Yeah, sure. So you can't really complain about it. Yeah. You shouldn't be. You know what I'm saying? Like, it's a business transaction. If it doesn't have to just come, you know, go on strike. I think we should go on strike against, come, uh, come strike bold stance. But you know what I mean? Like you can't, you can't, uh, fault the guy for not wanting to taste his don't come if he's paying for your services.

Speaker 5:          01:31:47       You know what I mean? Like that's his right to not want to eat the calm because he's paying for you to do whatever. It's like, now we're kind of making a leap on that because I did see something that said escort for her. I don't want a hundred percent. So let's say, let's assume she is, let's just put that, we're making the assumption that discussion. Yeah, I don't, you know who knows what the real story is, but if she is, it's like, okay, well it's not your place to judge. The guys who don't want to eat their come. Most guys don't want to eat their own comp. Most guys don't write. I've never known a guy who's been like, I love it. I love the taste. Have you known anybody that was like, I love? Not Openly. I mean, I'm sure we know. We know somebody is eating their come right now.

Speaker 5:          01:32:26       As they're listening, they're like, I'm going to write an email and let's just, right. Yeah. I don't know a lot of, I mean obviously I'm sure there's a lot of people that are, I'm sure into it, but into their own come, it's probably a smaller percentage into your own Tj's interesting. You think that that's lesser than the guy that's into other guys? Of course. Because that, because that's not that. I mean there's definitely guys and girls that are into com. Yeah. Tasting it, swallowing it. Either there's thoughts out that's not that crazy. To be into your own I think is a bit more of a stretch. Yeah. Cause your own fluid in usually the, the thrill would be that it's a belonging to a second party, nonsexual person. And I'm into things like pup play and that's where we're supposed to get familiar with your own things. Yeah. And it's not sexual, it's not sexual. It's good. Good point. It's just science could always just do, I'm fucking come run,

Speaker 17:         01:33:28       come on. It never seems to get any less humiliated. Come run. In other words, one big fucking Bull Lake. Of course though. And I also know you're deep. Your fucking Dick back inside me where I've still got reminds if your calm and then expect me to fucking suck off my mind so I'll just finish up. Let me do the camera. Let me have a shower. You jumped in the shower. Fuck me in the shower. Clean each other in the shower.

Speaker 5:          01:33:59       Electrical. I love her. You know what I do love these are lower class English girls, dare you. You know what I mean? Like no, I don't know what you mean. Really dark are white trash is far less charming. You know, our white trash girls are just not as as charming as the English accent. Maybe it's the accent. I mean, I am assuming she's a bit trashy and I'm assuming a class distinction here, but I do love these chaps or whatever it is. A film in Oxford. She's a Cambridge, the fellow in the shower. Yeah, she's talking about her tutorials. All right. We've got to run as always. Thank you guys for listening to our show.
