Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Well. Well, well go to your mom's house, Christina,

Speaker 2:          00:00:19       and here we are.

Speaker 3:          00:00:21       Hi Bobby. Hi Mom. Hi Mom. Hello.

Speaker 2:          00:00:30       Disturbing. I'm going to put that on Dr Drew's list. He would definitely have a lot of empathy for that guy because he was homeless. That guy. Yeah, he's the homeless voice. Great Voice Guy. Yeah. It's funny. Like I was just going to go, well what happened to him and then like I know it's something bad. Right? Well, I mean he probably got a big break and manage your money and then he blew it on drugs and now he's homeless again. So yeah, it's kind of predictable. You kind of pick up on these patterns. It's pretty sad. It's pretty sad. It is sad. It is. That's pretty sad. I mean, sure. It's hilarious. Is it funny or sad? That's Kinda, yeah, no, it's actually, that should be the theme of all our clubs. Is it, is it funny or sad? I think it kind of is. Yeah. Um, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:01:18       I'm going to ask me how my pee went. Yeah, I'm sure people are dying to know. That's good. Thanks for asking. Great. Seven months pregnant. So I go a lot. Yeah. You didn't think well I was going to add more toilet paper or the bedroom. I knew you were going to bring this up. I knew you were going to bring this up. How dare you. First of all, I had, I keep that thing stocked all the time. I bring up about, I bring up an entire fucking case of toilet paper. Yeah. You know what I mean? I got back from dropping your kid off and there was none there. Yeah. Well, did you use the tissue? There's a backup tissue box that I put there for a reason. Yeah, it's a backup system. Why not stock it with the TP though? Oh my God. Because we just ran out like this morning at 4:00 AM I took my last wipe and then I woke up at six 45 with a kid.

Speaker 2:          00:02:08       It wasn't the first thing on my list, Tom. Oh, why does it, why am I the keeper of the 12 panel? It was gone. You're the keeper of the House. I, I can't, I can't keep up laughing. I got other stuff. I got dogs diarrhea in the middle of the night. I got seven months. I'm so much pregnant. I got toddler and my friend visiting. It's a lot. All right, so you want to, God, I should tell the story that I want to fucking murder her. Yeah. Christina proposed that. Um, we kill our dog, Betsy. We don't kill it. All we need to do is let her loose in the hills around here and there's a lot of coyotes and if something were to happen, I'm the psycho. I'm the psycho. I'm sitting here like, no babe, we can figure it out. And you're like, no, I can't do it.

Speaker 2:          00:02:53       I can't do it anymore. I'll tell you. Here's why. Uh, the baby keeps me up a lot of nights too. Like they cry a, I'm, I'm tired already. You've been gone a lot. This month has been hard. At least once a month. This guy, damn dog gets diarrhea and then now I'm up at night taking her out two or three times it, I don't know what been the vet. She's eat special food to balance this problem out. She gets diarrhea about once a month, once a month, and I don't know more than other dogs had been. Of course the diarrhea, but it's usually not that frequently. It's not this consistent. Got Dogs that I've been fif might get it once every year and they eat the same stuff that falls on the floor. And here's the thing. Yesterday is when she must've gotten it, but I kept her away from all the droppings from the foods a table.

Speaker 2:          00:03:41       She, there's no like, I don't even know what she, she can't get into trash because there's no, there's no supply around her. I know. I don't even know what she's doing. She finds her way into things though that you don't even think about. I'm sure there's no access. She has no access to these things. I'm beginning to think it's something inside of her that's wrong. I don't think it's a diet. I mean killer. We'll definitely do away with the problem like you're saying, or letting her into the hills a little 14 pound Brussels Griffon just for a night. If she survived, she's, you're gone. Then she's back. She's back in the fold. She wouldn't live an hour outside of this house. Now. I Know Eagle would get her. Oh so fast squirrel snatcher write up I, I'm at a loss. I really don't know. I don't know what is wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:04:30       It's like I can't, I can't be up at night with two babies now. And the fucking dog. That's the thing. Yeah, I'm going crazy. Some of you are probably watching. You're noticing my Mickey mouse shirt. Nobody's noticed it is real. I do it because my son has taken to loving Mickey mouse and it's a way to bait him into affection. So I bought a bunch of Mickey Mouse. He really did this right when I walk around the corner for the first time in the day, he's like Mickey and I go, yeah, yeah, of course. Of course. He gets all excited and it's worked so far it's work. He's like, and then every once in awhile he'll read notice and be like, you got Mickey on your shirt. And I'm like, yeah dude. It's how I roll. He loved it and then I don't wear it. And he's like the fucks up with your shirt. Yeah. Cause he's strictly making right now. Yeah. Pretty cool. And he sleeps nothing like segway from that into our opening clip. He, Ms Tom Leykis. Okay, perfect. There it is. Did you like the clip? That was it. That was it. You liked it. Let's try that again. Let's try it out. Try it out. Try it out. Here we go. I'm Dr. Lindsey Doe, clinical sexologist and host of this sex curious show. Sexplanations today I'm going to answer are very popular. Question. How do I eat ass is Scott

Speaker 1:          00:05:59       well, well, well go to your mom's house.

Speaker 2:          00:06:06       Obviously. Full disclosure, this is more a video for you. Some of the uh, hesitant ladies that listen to the show. Um, a lot of us veteran guys could give this speech ourselves if we want. It might be better for you to hear it from one of your kind, you know? Yeah. Hopefully you'll take notes. Yeah, you do have a pen and paper. Good. Hopefully you'll eating ass. Also known as tossing the salad. Rimming cleaning the kitchen, playing the rusty trombone, anal Lingus and Colo sex is actually pretty simple. Step one, ask your partner your ass hole. The next time I go down on you. How would you feel if I made out with your butt while you masturbate? Wow, she's cool. I like her. You know it's interesting to me is people that call themselves sex experts now, he's not even really necessary. I mean given the internet, you can just Google like just like this.

Speaker 2:          00:07:01       I want you to ask me exactly the way she said this one. Sure, go ahead. Whereas I go down on you. How would you feel if I made out with your butt while you masturbate? Yeah. How would you hold on. How would you feel if I made out with your butt while you masturbate? Cool. Let's do it right now like that. That'd be my answer. How would you feel if I made out with your butt while you master, but I feel great about it. Did you ever think that I would put those words together in a sentence like ever, ever. I never 41 years. Never said that before. He's a super cool chick so she doesn't look like the type to eat ass, which is might be a she. She kind of comes under the radar like you meet her for a drink and you're like, oh maybe she'll kiss.

Speaker 2:          00:07:43       And then she's like, well we didn't make out what you're, but while you dropped off, how'd you feel if I may go step two, once you have consent, it's time to get ready. Avoid giving anything bad to their asshole and getting anything bad from their asshole. Here are the infections that can go from mouth to anus, anus to Matt herpes, gonorrhea and chlamydia, HIV, syphilis, hepatitis a and hepatitis B. Lastly, gastrointestinal problems and parasites. Light basically the things that cause food poisoning might be hanging out and you don't want to put those in your body. So here's a good heads up. But what's I could, I wish I had like a, these things right here make me think. Don't necessarily just eat a stranger's ass. Yeah. I mean without this I would have been like you should, but now I feel like shit, you should, you should meet people right away.

Speaker 2:          00:08:30       But now I'm like, oh, I didn't know you could get all these things that you should discriminate a little, a little bit, a little bit, but not that much. Where are you the kind that would just toss salad willy nilly with girls it out? No, I'm not just handed out for sure, but I mean, I dunno if she, you know, she looked like she didn't have those in and then, yeah, if she looked like she doesn't have those, well here's the thing. I mean, I wouldn't ask for a blood panel. I would see this nasty girl. She nasty as hell, but he's not nasty, but she looks like a nice girl. So this girl, you'd be like, she's, she doesn't even do all this stuff, but she does and she doesn't do a lot of want to know. I mean, I can just, I don't have any STDs.

Speaker 2:          00:09:08       I wonder. Yeah. I wonder how, I know it was quite common to have a lot of these things. Yeah. Do like, do you just like, uh, do you volunteer it? Like when you feel like it's about to go down? I think you have to, I think he knows that that's gotta be like, I feel like that'd be an immediate does then that just kill the queue. Um, no because I mean I know people that have these things and relationships and I think, I think it's more the relationship talk. Well yeah, that's what I'm saying. That's different though. What about when you just meet someone and you're like, it's each other's asses. Wait, but I've got hepatitis A, B, syphilis, HIV, chlamydia and gastrointestinal. I got all these things. Well I think there are people out there that are like, that's the, that's the risk I'm going to take.

Speaker 2:          00:09:56       I remember this, I remember how upset he got. He hooked up with somebody that we knew and then after they were done, she was like, I got to tell you something. And he was like, what? Because I have, um, no, that's not a big deal. He was like, what? Oh my God. Cause I have that thing that everyone has. And he goes, what do you, what do you have? Herpes? What do you mean everyone has, she goes, well, a lot of people have it and he's like, why don't you say it before we get it, before we did it, but then he didn't. He got, he didn't get anything. Let's see. Yeah. Some people say that's just the calculated risk you take for being with that person and you just wear a condom and that's the risk. Not a big deal. I don't think in a relationship.

Speaker 2:          00:10:36       I'm talking about one night stand. Yeah, the one night stand. It's a calculated risk. It tells you how this maybe I'm not broken out right now. There's no outfit, but at least saying it is a big thing. Disclose. I think it's your moral duty about a lot of people don't. That's how things get spread. See, that's why I wasn't promiscuous in the nineties before I met you. I swear this is the only reason I was in a hoe. I mean not the only, but I was so afraid to get in all this stuff, man, and now look, now we're two virgins together. You sure got hoes fucking uniform. All right, let go that next one.

Speaker 4:          00:11:10       Step three set of time. I'm sure you don't want to go down on someone and find a dingleberry of poop and pubes sticking your ass hole. Watch your bowel movements. Healthy ones look like this. Unhealthy ones look like this. Shower and wash your whole bucket with soap, especially the anus and all those little crevices that make it look like a star. Stay outside though. Don't go inside.

Speaker 2:          00:11:29       Oh again, she's with the, she had to tell you to stay outside. Just like that guy. He's like, you want to figure us? Don't put your finger in your household setting at time. Feel like a little bit of a mood killer. What are you talking about? She's like, set a time like fake, like I want to your ass. Cool. Do it at seven no, I think that's really cool because I feel like you've demanded things like how I want to put my mouth on stuff. I'm like, hey bro, I just came from a hike. My crotch smells like a zoo. Do you think you could not put your mouth on my parts right now? Can we make an appointment and then you can do this when I'm clean. No, because I remember the last

Speaker 5:          00:12:07       peg that I did that too. You know, I just met her at a bar and you know we had more drinks and then,

Speaker 2:          00:12:16       but that was probably a big contributor was drinking. Yeah, no, that I think about it. Yeah cause you don't, you lose your sense of taste and stuff and judgment and your, your brain, you're like, yeah go for it. Go, go for it. Go for it. Doesn't matter. My brain done. It's funny cause like my brain didn't when I was in college and stuff. I never sacked guy's stuff just willy nilly. I'm never, do you know that? I've never put my mouth on just a rogue, a painter. I've never, not once. Not only a stranger's Dick. Okay, well one of us is not very adventurous stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:12:47       Four, acquire some dams for a layer of protection. They reduce the risk of all the bugs I mentioned earlier and cover up the smell and taste of asshole.

Speaker 2:          00:12:54       Well, there's the, isn't that the biggest deterrent of them all? The smell and the taste of the asshole.

Speaker 5:          00:12:58       The, you mean it's the biggest fucking seducer of Brill. Yeah, of course. What do you mean if you don't have the taste, what are you doing? You want it to be doing a little Tang. You don't necessarily want, it's super tiny, but ah, you just want to go. Why can't you just have like a clean ass?

Speaker 2:          00:13:20       It's not possible for you. Cause I know where this is going. This is all for you, but you don't have a clean ass. There's no way you can because of the amount of hair and sweat cleaner right now. It's not possible.

Speaker 5:          00:13:33       Trim it too. And then you can just do what's possible with you. You're so Harry, Harry and gross. Hmm.

Speaker 4:          00:13:43       Step five with all preparation in place, play, play with all sorts of body parts, kiss, massage, whatever it takes to get all riled up before.

Speaker 5:          00:13:52       Okay,

Speaker 4:          00:13:52       go for step six. When you lightly blow on the Asshole, the blowing will not only light up this sensitive spot, it will walk the smell toward you. So you can evaluate whether or not you want to proceed. Oh,

Speaker 5:          00:14:03       that's okay. That's actually a good tactic. You see that

Speaker 2:          00:14:07       I'm too, I blocked it out. What did she say? She's saying yes

Speaker 5:          00:14:10       below towards it and then as you blow towards it, your airway hit the asshole. Some of the air will come back and if there's a a scent to it.

Speaker 2:          00:14:20       Yeah, I mean I just generally I engage in practices where there's like, no, I don't have to do that. What do you mean preliminary? Well, how would you know then? No, I'm just saying that I don't, I just stay away from activities that it has to do this much preparation for any activity that does this. What it sounds like, it's a lot like I have to find out if this person has STDs. I have a fine after that to clean their ass.

Speaker 5:          00:14:42       I think the worst was the dental dam and she's like, Hey, like imagine you're, you're like, I'm going to eat that ass. And I'm like, hold on, let me get this dental dam out.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       Why? Oh No, just see. That's how I would prefer to do it. On somebody. All right. Why don't we start with that? I'll get a dental dam and then can I wait until I'm not pregnant? I don't want to do, I'd throw out. I mean that's kind of the real for me. That's a whole genre of porn, right? Pregnant lady eating some guys, but I'm sure I'll look it up later to confirm. So nasty. What's wrong with people, man? Yeah, but she's right about that. That's a good tactic. I can't blow a little air towards it.

Speaker 4:          00:15:25       It just seems so labor intensive for loop and put a dam in place and had enough lube to keep things soft, but not so much that the anus thinks it's leaking.

Speaker 2:          00:15:35       Yeah. It's a lot of thinking. It's too much. Yeah. What? I just do it to them,

Speaker 4:          00:15:39       it's do normal things. Step eight don't literally eat ass unless your partner is into a poking feeling out of nowhere. I recommend working your way to the anus from the buttock, from the genitals to the paraniem inner thighs and up, kissing and touching with your hands licking. If you liked writing the cheeks and going straight in for asshole can feel quite jarring.

Speaker 2:          00:15:58       Hmm. Sounds like you've experienced. No, I just, I did feel that it's from her too. I was like, Ooh, she really knows what she is.

Speaker 4:          00:16:07       Once you're at the site, think licking gentle sucking, kissing and tickling. Even making contact and not moving at all can be incredibly arousing. The anus is densely packed with nerve endings. That's part of a concentrated area of erogenous tissue and it's slightly taboo. So there's a thrilling adventure and doing something pleasurable that society tells us not to.

Speaker 2:          00:16:25       How many people you think that are watching her really need to wash her? In other words, do you need the full lesson of how to do this? I guess a lot, right? So that means somebody who's, who feels like they're really benefiting from it. I clearly, but like I said, like do we need another sexpert in the world? I feel like you could just Google this shit. How do I eat acid? It comes up now, but it's been covered. You know what I mean? I Dunno. I've never heard of discussed this way. So there was, to me it feels pretty intuitive. I mean, except for the blowing thing. That's a, that's a tip. But a wash your ass wash your ass is if you don't know to do that. Yeah, don't eat. Don't literally eat someone's ass. It's kind of intuitive. No Shit. Yeah. Choose someone's be whole. Yeah. I don't know, Eh, it's not my thing, Tom. It's just not my thing. It's never going to be my thing. We're going to get you into it.

Speaker 4:          00:17:18       Check in. I'm not staring. Ask Your partner questions wetter deeper. You could ask any questions like how is it? But getting a yes or no answer means you're not caught up in conversation when they likely want your mouth getting back to business. Okay. I have, I'm getting a little nauseous from licking butts holes. I can't even fathom how many fucking steps this woman have. Anal Lingus is hopefully pleasurable for everyone involved. If you're not into it, consider 69 so you're getting oral sex to,

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       or any new position for that matter. You know what she, she should have talked about the, uh, the squat and sit where like you lay on your back and then a guy steps over your face, squashed down, puts his mouth parts disaster directly in your mouth. And then I can't think of anything more overwhelming. Can you even imagine? That's a beautiful thing. I remember my parents telling me about it the first time. Can you, I can only imagine because I have like, I have, you know, just like squeeze your butt cheeks and stuff and I have felt the heat that comes out of that region with you. Like I can just imagine like the heat that and the hair. Oh, it's nice. I can sell and that you have to hold a squat for a while. Yeah. Yeah. You got to hold it for awhile.

Speaker 2:          00:18:41       Why don't we do the Hammock trek that that guy did? And Venezuela. Oh yeah, the macafee the, yeah, you cut a hole out of the hammock and then you can kind of squat on that. And then that's just to make brown though. He wanted the girls to Brown in his mouth. And the way you can also do it for Butler taking I guess there's a tip she liked to watch these really gross. That's a whole other level. Speaking to Browning. Um, lot of people, a lot of people weighing in on the poop pile. Your time is over man. Defecation and yeah cause you've been found out. Uh, you know some people said Oh you there was a, would you rather when you said you didn't want to poop outside and yeah, cause I'm thinking of of it as open up the side of the street.

Speaker 2:          00:19:27       Like, like that's what we were talking about in India as people just shitting on the side of the road. That to me is different than the poop pile, which was just like a almost like a spiritual event. Yeah. You know what I think is the most Yana compelling evidence against you poo poo pile is the way that you described the setup. Now I would like one of our listeners to go back into the vaults and maybe dig up the audio of the first time you described exactly how the poop pile wet because I'm pretty sure you've described it differently. No, it wasn't this time. You said there was a uh, uh, steps hammered to a tree. Yeah, that's true. The first time you just said, you said it was a ladder. What's a makeshift ladder? Oh, so is it a tree with steps cut put into it or a make shift lumps and calling that a makeshift ladder?

Speaker 2:          00:20:21       The steps nailed into the tree. That's to me is a tree ladder. That, that specific thing. It's a tree that we put steps on. Well, yeah, that's true. It is. In essence, it's a tree that you guys would shut out of, but there was no mention of a tree up until this last time. He's a tree. That's what we had the tree. What do you mean there's no mention of a tree? I don't, Yana, I don't recall any mention of a tree. Well you don't, luckily for you, for me, for all of our listeners, I was able to spend time this weekend with somebody I live with during the poop highlighter and I brought it to his attention. You mentioned to me like bring it to his attention. So I did. And he's just going to lie to

Speaker 6:          00:21:02       all right case. Um, there's been a lot of controversy lately about whether the poop pile is real and as somebody who lived with me in that time, can you comment on too as to whether it was racial or not? Poop pile is definitely real. Um, I mean it was something that everybody took part in. It wasn't just me and Tom and Justin had a roommate, but it was like a neighborhood thing. Kids would come over and that I get excited and tell their kids they come around over. But we had, I mean, we had the ladder and kind of in the back where the tree was the climb up, everybody would take a dump pile up. I mean Poopa yeah, I mean, now what about the accusation that it as guys are that age in college, there's no way we would do that because it would deter, you know, girls from coming over.

Speaker 6:          00:21:59       So we were trying to get late. No, definitely not. It never happened. I mean that was, that was what that was our thing is what we're known for. Never stop you just for, it's like that's the poop powerhouse. Yeah. Let's go get laid. Yeah. And sometimes even they would want it definitely happened. Yeah. The definitely some ladies goofed off the poop pile ladder. It's not as gross or crazy as it sounds to me. It was normal. I mean, everybody did it. So it was just what we did. So I never felt out of, I never questioned anything. So, yeah. And how often did you, what'd you say you participated? Because sometimes it would happen. I remember I wasn't there. You can't force your shit. Right. So when they call the poop pile call and they just, the pill that poupon was stolen or whatever, you want to take a shit, you don't go, just stay up there until you mean you just, you don't anticipate that time.

Speaker 6:          00:22:49       But there was so many poo piles. I mean, yeah, it's like everybody got a turn that was for sure. Like everybody got a shot. Yeah. And um hmm. I'm trying to think. I mean logistically I was trying to explain, you know, the kind of the makeshift ladder in the tree and you climb out. Yeah. We had like the, like we had an actual toilet seat at the end of the tree. Right. And then it felt totally normal. I mean, you sat down and told that you had the bar to hold on to poop. I mean it was just, people don't realize it. Like for the, for kids it was really a fun, like come on, do it. I mean, what kid doesn't love to just drop a poop, right? Yeah. It's like, I was like going on a rollercoaster. You have it to you. You have an almost two year old and a three year old.

Speaker 6:          00:23:29       What happens when you say the word Fart? Yeah, they laugh or poop like so they loved it. They loved it. Kids loved it. The other neighborhood, like men definitely loved it and I almost feel like, yeah, I think women were intrigued by it. It was a pretty cool for sure. Thanks for verifying this stuff. Poop pile dude. Can you do, can you remember the call? Like what does it sound like when we left the whereby? No, I feel like I, for some reason I feel like Justin called out the most like, cause he had, he would really have a, he had a good like yelling voice. He was he a yeller and he would be like, Oh I probably just screaming like that. People would dark, dark. It's like the ice cream truck came through. Exactly. And they were just were like, I gotta do this too. Yeah. Very cool. Not a farm mark.

Speaker 2:          00:24:21       Yana allow me to present Casey's testimony, if I may quote him verbatim. Now you presented the poop pile, last week's drawing such that there were steps nailed on a tree. Yeah. So as you put it, a make shift letter. Now Mr. Casey and his testimony right now said we had the latter kind of back where the tree was. Now those are two separate items. I rest my case. No, he's saying there's a separate ladder kind of bad saying there's a separate lab quote and I quote, we had the ladder kind of back where the tree was. So now in Casey's reminiscences recollection if you will about the poop out there was a ladder kind of backward. The tree was now in your drawing last week. Yeah. Nail Lubeck can bring it up. Yeah. As I'm saying this, you had individual steps like a tree house nailed up. Yeah. Now, which wasn't liar pants.

Speaker 2:          00:25:20       No. Here's the thing. No, no, no, no. Those are two separate ways. No. Cause you could lay a ladder against the tree as well. You could, but you didn't know. I always use the steps that were nailed to the tree. But if you wanted to join somebody up there, maybe somebody who was climbing it, you put the ladder against the tree. No two people going up. He didn't mention that. Now Casey's testimony did not say that. Sometimes there was two of us up there. First of all, there's no mention. Never have two people pulling. Oh, sometimes there was half. Or how is that possible? Because you would all hang off of that branch and wait for wanting off of that rent there. You said there was only one bar right? That you could hold onto throwing. You're telling me that two grown men are going to share a little bar and hang their asses off one branch.

Speaker 2:          00:26:03       No, you're misunderstanding. Somebody is sitting on somebody's sitting to shit. Persons facing him like watching him. Okay. They switched seats. One one's done. So one person's holding in their Shit and coaching the other. This is, first of all, this is the first time you've ever mentioned this scenario happens all the time. All the time. Yeah. Uh, I'm just saying that right now, Casey's testimony of what it even physically looked like doesn't sound or what you like, what you drew. You mean I'm going to get video of it at some point. I'm sure video of what? People pooping off of it. So you can, you think of hoophouse still exists. Shut up. It was legendary. Where is it? Where, where it's in North Carolina. It's in North Carolina, was where I lived. Where, where else would it, do you, you think that the person who now lives in this place maintained this ridiculous thing?

Speaker 2:          00:26:57       I'm sure when they heard stories about it, they wanted to see what was up. Yeah. I like to interview these alleged children that ran to the scene number pile. Okay. Why don't they come forward? I'm sure somebody knows somebody. The magic of the Internet. Sure. You found the bikes kid through the magic of the Internet. Um, somebody wanted me to bring up your Moose. Is this your unbelievable the lies and this house. Somebody submits their market. I'm going to get a metal, a metal detector. A lie detector. Yeah. We're going to get to the bottom of this. I'm over it supposed to be an impression of the moose soup lady. I remember her.

Speaker 7:          00:27:39       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:27:42       So let's see if this guy has a good impression. It's pretty good. Except that the audio doesn't line up with the video. I was confused if he was playing the real, but that was good. I thought he was playing the real, I know. That was really, why does it line up? Because that would indicate that it's not real.

Speaker 7:          00:28:15       Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:28:21       That's pretty. If it is him, that was really good.

Speaker 7:          00:28:30       I know.

Speaker 2:          00:28:32       Tom, you're there. Yeah, that was great. Good job, Austin. Before I forget, I forgot to put it on our show last week only online. I posted it and it still blew up the fucking new try it out. Shirt. It's right. Yeah. So I didn't even realize it because the guy was like, he uh, he messaged me, he was like, oh, people are 11 to try it out shirt. And I go, oh, I only posted it online. We didn't. Uh, there it is. Try it out your mom's house podcast. Try it out in the middle. We also made a women's shirt, so try it out. Women's cut, try it out. Shirt is that, it's kind of trot out inside Joe. Work friendly.

Speaker 2:          00:29:25       Very positive. Yeah. And it's also shows like, have you not listened to this podcast chart out the shot? You know, it's interesting Tom, is that the try it out. Guy has made his rounds into our heart over and over and over again. And before you left for this last trip to yeah, we kind of rediscovered him as a couple. Yeah, it's true. It's like some clips that the over time they kind of unfold and give us more and more meaning why you're right. And I also realized that there was parts of, uh, what he was saying that I was glancing over, glass it over. So that's another blast. Like I really need to pull. Here's the deal, man. That's so funny.

And you know when you're fight, like you, you lay in bed at night and you sometimes think of a confrontation you're going to have with somebody in the next day. Yeah. And you're a kind of lining up your arguments. Like that's what he's been doing. Good. Sitting on this brand on a minute. I think we should do a quick pause. Our friend a wheeler Walker Jr is Co.

So excited to have you back. Jay Dad mouth. That's correct. I want to champion. Good to see you. Good. Hey, wait, what did you just say? Water champion. He's a water champion. Of course. I saw on the news you slept on the news. What News? It's, it's been on the news before. Have you heard of the poop pile? You're from the south. The poop pile? No, I don't know. I mean I know it. Poo is, I don't want piles are done. You ever heard of grown men building like a tree house ladder and then hanging off of it and pulling in the same pile together? What do you think of that? Sounds like a good weekend. We did and guess where I did it in North Carolina, which, yeah, I mean, I mean I had never heard of it, but I'm like, if you, if you said let's do it now, I'd put the microphone down, we'd get weed. I didn't do it. And if I told you he existed in the Carolinas, you probably be like, that sounds believable. If you, if you guessed me, which state I probably, what does it do? You Play

Speaker 9:          00:32:40       Carolina. You must, right? Yeah, we've done a few times. I'm going back there, um, uh, soon. I told you before we started recording, I'm, I'm talking with kid rock in the fall and I think we're doing somewhere in North Carolina. I forget. They told me the dates and then that's going to be a fun tour, man. Yeah, it's crazy. What's, what's cool about it for me, which is a new thing for me, is there, it's country artist, which is probably different. I don't know what it's like for, for Comedians, but it's, we do, it's weekends only. Yeah. So I'll be in Nashville. Oh wait. You know, so we get on the bus Thursday night or Friday, whatever. So yeah, it's just like a living a normal life and then you get to go to her on the weekends. It'll be fun. Yeah. That's going to be awesome, man. That what you do, you guys do

Speaker 5:          00:33:20       pretty much. Pretty much. Yeah. It's a weekend. Yeah. Weekend Gig. Yeah. Which, ah, fuck, that's, that's what makes it tolerable. Really. Yeah. Well, years be like week after week after week, or would it be like,

Speaker 9:          00:33:31       right. Yeah, I think we're, it's, it'll be total of three months of three months. Yeah. Wow. It's a long tour, but it's, uh, it's going to be fun man. Cause I mean, that's why I give, I'm giving him some credit because you know, when I, you know, I was in, you know, making the first record, I'm playing, you know, fuck you bitch, sit on my face to me these sound like arena songs. But then the reality of the world kind of kicked in. I'm like, Ma, you, I started playing clubs. Like, you know, maybe arenas aren't going to happen. And then when they got the call like you can't, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:34:00       you didn't how much they're going to laugh it off. And also the coolest thing will be people. There's going to be people for sure at the show who were like, oh, like who's his opening act? Who is that you got? And then holy, there's gonna be people who get there early,

Speaker 9:          00:34:14       just who want to get, you know, situated with their fucking hot dog. And they're absolutely, they're parents and they're going to hear me singing like, what the fuck is going on?

Speaker 5:          00:34:22       Like when they hear the pussy king, um, I dunno. I think you're going to, you're going to win a lot of new fans on this thing.

Speaker 9:          00:34:29       Yeah. And that's a, that's a good thing about music because I either win the fans over or I, when you, if I don't win them over, I certainly make an impression. Yeah. They'll know. They'll know your name. Yeah. Yeah. They'll, they'll, or they'll, it was like the old hat, you know, I think it was the Howard stern thing, which is, you know, the people like you, you don't tell one person, people don't like you tell it like 50 people.

Speaker 5:          00:34:47       Yeah. I'd be going nuts if I was at a show and I didn't know who you were and I heard these songs, I would be the guy who was like, I got, I'd be buying your album in the fucking, in the audience that right then and there or do you have any songs about eating ass? Can we just,

Speaker 9:          00:35:03       um, no. Uh, well look, I'm going to be making my third record soon, but I've got to get into that, right?

Speaker 5:          00:35:09       Yeah. I mean we were just talking about this and one of the things we talked about that we saw a sexpert give advice on, like bringing it up and preparing for it and she, she suggested like a dental dam and I was like, that kind of is a, I don't know. I think that's kind of a mood killer. Yeah. I mean it seems like you're not really doing it well. I don't know. I didn't like her approach to the ask. It was like, how did it go again? Do you mind if I make out with your

Speaker 8:          00:35:37       butt while you masturbate? That was one of her ways of bringing it up. Yes. Explain to me what a dental dam is. Isn't it just a piece of plastic that you put over a vagine or an a hole and then you, that's how your tongue, your tongue, Lex plastic or rubber latex. I don't know the definition of be nice, but I can't count. He must be just crushing box on the road. You're a musician. You have all these songs, uh, that are sexual in nature. Is it everything you dreamed of? Well, I got a girlfriend so it's not, and um, I'll be honest, I thought that was kind of a thing in the industry that you're not supposed to say here with a woman. Cause well I think John Lennon wasn't supposed to. He had a wife, but I ain't the Beatles. I'm not, you know how long you been with this girl? Over a year. I mean it's, and it's actually real, like I was talking about, it's nice to, you know, yeah. To not have to deal with, he's like fucking road skanks getting backstage and shit like that. And then it's just like, you know,

Speaker 8:          00:36:37       so, so and so wants to go backstage, told him to fuck off, you know, I can't imagine how be different, I mean, stand up. It really, you know, there are Comedians who their, their act

Speaker 5:          00:36:50       is basically, it's cording get like they're, it's an attempt to get laid with their whole thing is, I mean it's not, it's not laid out as in I'm doing this to meet chicks, but that's what they're doing, you know, and, and they, they do their set and it is an attempt to get laid. But it's so different than music where music is, it cannot be in your idea of your mindset of this is why I'm doing this. But I think when people see musicians perform, you know, men and women,

Speaker 8:          00:37:22       yeah, just do it. It's probably just different audience people screaming and drunk and stuff. Sure. But I'll bet who are the like, you know, what's the word I'm looking for? Puente crushers and not, you can't say their names, but it's probably, it's probably like the dudes that you would never imagined. I heard that a Cosby was well before he had a trick to that. Legit like other than those, those things.

Speaker 5:          00:37:48       Women, sometimes it's a, it's a PR. I know a couple, I mean, yeah, I can't say it on here, but when we stop I'll tell you, I'll tell you three verified absolute just hounds that

Speaker 8:          00:37:59       that's their whole people said that to me before, you know, like man you just did this music just to get late. And I was like, in a way I was kind of like, it kind of annoyed. I was like, you don't feel the fee. You know, you don't feel anything in this music other than just like a guy and who needs to get laid, you know? Yeah. No I think you said that, but I'm just saying like it, no, it annoys me when people say like, like that's a lot of work to get late record. Right. They expect that if you're, if you're a musician that it isn't worth it mean. Yeah, that's probably, does she ever get jealous? Cause you also have a lot of really good looking women in your videos and you're singing about like hot

Speaker 9:          00:38:36       chicks. Like is she like how'd you meet her? And she ended this stuff. [inaudible] mutual friend. She, I mean, she as she loves what I do. We get along. I mean, we haven't had any problems with that kind of stuff. Oh, okay. No jealousy or no, no, no. I mean I'll bet if you sat her down and said, would you rather him not call himself the Pussy King? I'll, my guess is she probably say, you know, yes Mr. Walker. Yeah, I prefer that. Yeah. Or the, you know, the sit at home watch TV came we'd probably before, cause I'm, I'm kind of a, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:39:03       so what I got, I get rid of me left and right, but I always there you got to push it off. Yep. We always like the women that come up to me w when the guys ask for Pictures, Oh my God, when I do stand up, you know, I would say 89% maybe more when my audience is men. But you also obviously see couples majority of the time when I meet a couple after the show, a guy, I'll be like, hi man, fucking, it's so great to meet you had a picture and then I'll be like, sure man. And then he'll be like bay, but she'll go, I'm good. I'm all right, fucking here. And then he'll like, insist, come on, get back. She's like, no, no, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.

Speaker 9:          00:39:46       Well, they're holding up. My thing is, is there's a lot of couples, they're in law, you know, it's like, it's the same thing, but, and then he gets a picture and she's like, you know, it's, this is my birthday gift to him. You know, I did is I did it as a favor. I don't need shit.

Speaker 5:          00:39:59       Yeah. You know, I get, I hear it a lot. He's been dying to see you and I go, thanks. Yeah. And she's like, yeah, yeah, no, he was really excited tonight and he really laughed at, like, she tells me like, it's a report, like making sure I know that

Speaker 9:          00:40:12       question a lot too. Like, how do I convince my girlfriend or wife or whatever it took to get her to go to a show with me? I'm like, I don't know if she's not into it, you know, she doesn't like it. Don't just go do something else. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:40:24       Yeah. That's a good point. Yeah, it's, it's, it's very weird. But this is a tour is going to be, I think bananas for you. You're going to pick up so many new fans. Yeah. Geez. Yeah. What kind of venues are you doing? You know,

Speaker 9:          00:40:34       I think it's, I think it's amphitheaters. Aha. Yeah, it'll be, it'll be big, big places. They've got other guy, Brantley Gilbert who is really big. He's doing those songs that you, you have like in those venues is going to be, and it's a real cushy gig too cause you know, we, you know, we go on so early so I'll be like done. I'm used to getting done in fucking midnight. I'll be done early and it's the best way to, you know, get on the bus and walk off and yeah, cause I'm trying to thank you. I have your if your latest album, I have old wheeler on my phone, man. Finger up my butt. Yeah. I really love, I'm excited for the, you know, the kid rock fans who don't know who I am to hear finger on my button. That kind.

Speaker 5:          00:41:18       Yeah. I mean, I guess summers in Kentucky would be what? Too slow to play on something like that. Right? To Open. Yeah,

Speaker 9:          00:41:25       shorter set. So I just try to just know pounded down it. Yeah, maybe I'll probably do fuck you. Bitch is my one valid. That's a great song. You had to try to play it on here before

Speaker 8:          00:41:34       I think so your dog. Yeah, and I think that'll get some hopefully get a couple of lighters even though it'd be probably light a little lighter outside, but yeah. Yeah. That's fucking dope man. That's really, really good news where we've, we've supported you and we're just so thrilled that you're doing so well in your music and you're really talented songwriter, singer. Great. On the guitar. Do you ever scan, do you ever seven debit debit? How it knows a Scott and I thing a thing. Oh, you're not feeling familiar with God. I know it's getting yes, but it's like, is it something you guys are into? We've been getting into it, trying to figure out whether it requires skill or if any two year old I was, I would go for the two year old angle. But yeah, for me, I mean the only time I would ever do that as if I'm working on a song and I didn't have the lyrics radio I on to record the melody, I'd do though do it.

Speaker 8:          00:42:24       Did you know? Yeah, that's more Babel than a scat. I mean, what training would you need for scat? I, it's such a racket. I don't believe it. I mean other people who pay way or there are people who pay you to go see people's scat. Yeah. Like six farmers. I think so. Yeah. Uh, oops. Um, yeah. So anyways, yeah, we, we mocked somebody that did it on our show and then most people were into it. But then we've got a few push backs about, um, you know, how talented this person was. And then we found a woman who won a grammy for her skin and she was like, you know, I'm going to have you won a grammy for. So the categories, I don't know. She's like, you know, I don't, I don't play the Trump, but I am the trumpet. Yeah. It's like a, what's his name? The don't worry. Be Happy Guy. Yeah. Bobby McFerrin. Yeah, I'll bet he won a grammy for some. Oh, you're probably right. Yeah. I mean, here's a little taste of something else.

Speaker 10:         00:43:27       Jesus Christ singing is a form of vocal improvisation using nonsense syllables

Speaker 8:          00:43:33       imitating musical instruments. You have to explain it. Sign Jazz. Yeah. And that's, you don't, I don't have to go after my, each side I'll go country music is the thing where you play your guitar and you say, you know, it's like, if you have to explain it to prove that it's actually music, it's not snowing. Yeah, man. I just watched, what it looks like to me is a guy who's like, I love music, don't want it, don't want to spend the time and get learning guitar, Mandolin, piano, whatever, or base. I'm just going to stand up against the wall and just start fucking babbling. I can't remember remembering lyrics is tough to, yeah, if you just scan it, just like, and I noticed his snaps were kind of off with his scouting. It wasn't very rhythmic duet Scott member or,

Speaker 10:         00:44:18       yeah. You match

Speaker 8:          00:44:22       each other's like last note, take it somewhere else. Yeah. I mean half their life is probably proven that there are musicians. So it just like, it's like I've never, I don't know anything. I've never heard of the sketch

Speaker 9:          00:44:32       show or you know

Speaker 2:          00:44:33       now how long you're pretty damn good guitar player. How long it takes you, you figure it out in like a day and afternoon. How long did it take you? I promise

Speaker 9:          00:44:40       took me, I will say there's a, cause everyone asks that there's a learning. It was like a learning curve. Definitely. It's like the first week you're just like, fuck this, I don't want to play. Yeah. And then there's just a, there's a time maybe few months and we're just like, it starts to feel normal and then not, then you get to a point where you're just picking, you know? Wow. But you started very young, yo. Yeah. It was probably, you know, 11 or 12 or something. What was the first song you wrote? Do you remember when you were 11 first song I wrote, um, I wrote a song with a buddy of mine back in Kentucky. Um, my buddy Tyler who, um, I won't say his last name because I think he's got like a normal job now. We wrote a song called big woman and it was really bad, but you know, big woman and we were trying to do like, um, I think it was quite, I'm like a big bottoms like smiled tap guy.

Speaker 2:          00:45:28       Yeah. Like her, but her butt was big. I think she was all around big. She could have been into scad. Definitely. Well, let's get into it a little more, Scott. Lesson.

Speaker 11:         00:45:37       Things you need to do to scat number while you need to listen to a lot of jazz recordings. Shirley Horn players like the trumpet or the saxophone because Horn instruments are very similar to voice. Oh. Since, because they use a breathing number two, you need to transcribe. You don't have to write the notes down. Just try to sing the solo that you like. If you can find a track that you like, you don't have to really use too much effort. You will eventually see the Solos.

Speaker 2:          00:46:10       You understand what he's advising, right? Yeah. So mimic the right like some Sax Solo and then you, yeah, I can do that. So he's claiming it's, I think he's trying to claim it as if like a cover. What isn't that? Yeah, it's that kind of plagiarism. I mean you're not coming up with your own songs. So is it, what's the talent? Here's another example.

Speaker 7:          00:46:28       What do we think? He basically just singing along with that, having a little bit, why should we call it singing along

Speaker 2:          00:46:41       along with the sound, because that's a singing along with that, having to learn the lyrics. Yeah. He's singing along with like the dark does just mimic the stuff. It is crazy that somebody won a grammy. I want to know this grant. I want to know that Scott and grammy singer Scat, grammy, can you think of a worse thing to have to sit through? How many they should put it like it should be the last award of the night and then our final award, this scat album, that album on the year. Yeah. I mean it really is exactly what you do when you're a little chunks all the time. A tree, I love my tree. You've got to create, is it practice

Speaker 9:          00:47:24       stage? And I forgot my lyric

Speaker 11:         00:47:26       practice, the nonsense syllables. If you use a best choice

Speaker 8:          00:47:30       syllables, then it will stutter your phrase. For instance, did Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee or Bubba, Bubba, Bubba, Bubba, Bubba, some of them love and they shut the baffles. Listen, you can't tell the difference. Thinking are do up Delia [inaudible] and my God and number five you get a day job. Yeah, yeah. It's a skillset.

Speaker 2:          00:47:56       Leave it up. It do.

Speaker 8:          00:48:01       Maybe that's a sign of something. You know, something shitty. Is it for you took like you took the three best scatters, I guess maybe do you call them in the world and then put just two people who just had learned it two seconds before? What'd you be able to tell the difference? It's a great, a great way to, you know, if you, if you took, I think right grace gets put cloud or next to a guy who just picked up a guitar. Yup. Yup. That's, that's, see, that's, that's right. That's the whole thing. He'd be like, I think that cloud the guys better than the other guy. But in scouting you might be like, I dunno. Yeah. That's been doing it in a week. It's pretty fucking good. I mean, he'd be probably, I'd probably be more fun to watch. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It just, um, yeah, it seems kind of like an insane thing to do. Um, how about there's a whole scene, you know, like, yeah, like underground, you know, like, yeah, I think they think it's PR. I think. I feel like he's got the vibe. He thinks it's like some new form of jet, you know, it's like jazz. It's like the millennial version of fucking shit.

Speaker 2:          00:48:57       People have been doing this horse shit for a long time. This is all bullshit racket, this bullshit, man. It's all old stuff. Yeah. People have been scamming the scat thing for a minute. Feel like didn't

Speaker 8:          00:49:09       a song or David Lee Ross like bat, but dd, but oh yeah, I ain't got no. Yeah. So that would that make him the world's greatest? That's, that's gotta be a big scat hit. Yeah. Cause then there was the, then he fucked it up by singing, singing all good and stuff. There was the, um, the scat man song that was, was that one, um, the scap man,

Speaker 2:          00:49:34       you remember that? But then there's the actual music around that. That's right. Right, right. That's breaking the rules, the free form also, because there's no structure to it. The fact that there's no cost at all structure, it kind of doesn't make it a song. Right. I mean, you're a songwriter or wheeler. It can you just willy nilly,

Speaker 8:          00:49:58       wow. There's gotta be some kind of, yeah, that's what I'm, that's what I keep being confused about it. Like if you're in the studio, he goes and the guy goes, let's try it again. He would be like, I don't know what it did. What do you mean try it and try it again? He goes, the new one will be a new song. So it's just like whatever. Like if you had a 10 song album and just be whatever, 10 pieces of shit you threw out there, you know, I kind of think we should try to make us got album. I think so too. Yeah. Great idea. Make It, you could do with these two mikes. Put it out online. You can make a lot of money. Yeah, we get a lot of money. Yeah. Scott, the album, Scott, maybe we could open for you as your duo. You too scattered. You can open every fucking show. You want them to all sit down with kid rock and say, I know I go, I know, I know openers can't have openers, but I got these two. Got To get these guys to at least Scott for a minute for me. How quickly before we got.

Speaker 8:          00:50:51       Yeah, you get hit with for sure. You know, it would start like there. People would be like, Huh. And then once it hit maybe like minute,

Speaker 9:          00:51:03       although I guess you know, bow with debar was kind of a scattered a little,

Speaker 8:          00:51:06       Oh yeah we did bang the bank, but it probably breaks the rules by being the same thing every time. Music. But he always sings, he's doesn't, he doesn't just go, sometimes they go Scott, but did you know Scott a lap pop his crowd, we go on him, turn on him. If he was just sky

Speaker 9:          00:51:27       the vehicle thing. Because when I get ready for a tour, like the main, my main thing, everyone has to get their voice ready or whatever it is. My main thing is learning the fucking lyrics takes me forever. So scatting would be, I mean probably probably do scat every once in while learning your own lyrics. Learning my own lyrics is fucking hard because, because of the way I write is like, you know, cause people have to, you know, my, my band has to sing harmony with me so far. The FIS single wrong line, they got the wrong way. So it's like there's some, there's a song called, can't fuck you off my mind where I just like while read is blowing me. I mean it's like I got to remember who's doing what.

Speaker 8:          00:52:00       Girls don't want to who to what. It's like gotta have him all right. And in order I always, you know, I'm uh, I have zero musical skill and when I would do, I can scat. But when I think that that statement's doing very basic stuff, you know, years ago like learn these four keys, the idea, you know, I had to put so much thought into doing it. One of the things that seems terrifying is you, you realize at the time that when you're doing it and you're like, wow, I finally got this together, that to sing while you're doing that, for some people it would be like, it would be impossible. I would not be able to.

Speaker 9:          00:52:34       Yeah. I didn't really sing that much until I had the guitar to, I'm pretty good cause I was too shy about singing and when I first started. But yeah, I had the guitar down good enough. So I would, I actually was when I was a kid, you know, you could sing. I knew it but I was too scared to really, you know, growing up with a bunch of big family. I was too, I was too shy to kind of belt it out. Um, your siblings? Yeah. Two brothers do a, what do they think of your, I was going to say mixed things and my mom came, my mom's from national so she comes to national lots of sheet. We had a record release show I think for the last one and I think that was um, well the oddest things I've ever done. She was for the first record, she came up to the show and I'm obviously you play no matter what your, just your eyes.

Speaker 9:          00:53:21       Cause I've always wear shades on all the time, but mainly on special on for the lights. And so I'm playing and I just couldn't, I had to watch, my mom was thinking, fuck you bitch. I've never, I've never, in all my years I've never seen this look from her, which was this weird kind of like proud giant crowd. You know, people, people buying and tee shirts and singing along and his other like half of our faces, like, what the fuck did I do wrong? I was like, mom, this ain't song. It ain't about you. You know, I played the whole song and washed her face the whole time and I would, it's not something I would advise anybody to do.

Speaker 8:          00:53:55       I don't like having my mom at shows because you know, I don't sing. Obviously a bank should come to shown she's come to shows and usually she'll, it's some version of a, that was great. Um, and then at some point she'll be like, yeah, why do you the God you say,

Speaker 9:          00:54:12       I was going to say it's probably exact same thing, which is I get a lot of, you know your voices so pretty, you don't need to say the bad word is, you know, but that's like, well, all right,

Speaker 8:          00:54:23       she'll point out another comic. You're like, you know, who doesn't even say the F word? Like, yeah, she's, yeah. She's like, Garth Brooks doesn't need to say that. It needs, it doesn't need to talk about sitting on people's faces. I'm why if he did he'd be even bigger. Yeah, he's sure. He sure. Here we go. We followed it.

Speaker 12:         00:54:44       The dream still lives and my dream is for us to love one another. All of us.

Speaker 8:          00:54:49       Oh Gosh, isn't that weird? Oh Oliver, what dreams still is this was this, was this the MLK one? Probably, but also its most generic thing like you won't even mention MLK. Just like the dream. Everybody's like not a lot of emotion and those are all of us. And wait, he leans in and he doesn't really connect with a while ago cause this dirty. That sounds like it.

Speaker 12:         00:55:16       Just for us to love one another. All of us.

Speaker 9:          00:55:22       Yeah. Fuck I fucking hate that guy. I mean it's weird because you say that now. I mean just because country music has gotten so shitty, you know, cause when I was a kid there was all that good country and Garth came along and he was the pop sellout. So I'm still from that era. But nowadays when there's such this horrible shit, people you've probably never heard of like Florida, Georgia line and you know all this other fucking dog shit. It's like pop, pop, kind of like Florida Georgia line. We've just got off a tour with backstreet boys and Nelly have fun. Have Fun at that one. But I'm saying like that's the people I hate now, but at the time it was Garth was the out. You know, there's a, there's a famous quote attributed to Wayland, but we don't, nobody knows if I'm Waylen said it or not, but the quote was, you know, Garth Brooks did to did to country what panties did to finger fucking, which I think, I mean, it's definitely a quote because I said it, but yeah, definitely a quote, but I don't know that. And everyone says, it says, everyone says it's a Waylon. Whoa. But I don't know if it's a cool quote. That's a good quote. But it kind of is, you know, it was like, yeah, he really just kind of sanitized it for everything. It's the most fucking generic. Oh, that's terrible. Like, if you didn't wear the cowboy hat would, you know it was country.

Speaker 2:          00:56:35       Wow. I, you know what bothers me the most, cause I don't know much about country music, but I just find him to be so insincere and such a fucking phony baloney. It's just weird because that's what country's all about. His sincerity. What I know is that yeah, you're supposed to be real and you keep it real, even if you have a big millions of dollars. And I just, I just don't sense that from him. I just, I don't connect. I don't know. He seems like he's a sociopath Karma.

Speaker 9:          00:56:59       It seems fucking crazy because we, you and I, you guys and I both watched those fucking g alerts. Neither does the g breaks in with the GL or it couldn't be any less important or anything. G alert. He's playing fucking Tulsa.

Speaker 2:          00:57:14       Yeah. Glr Taylor let the conversation creepy. So creepy. And he's also, he's, he's,

Speaker 9:          00:57:25       he's just, you remind me a little bit of, um, I was just think about prince today when that, that other than news kind of came out about him, uh, whatever they figured out. What kind of drugs he was on, but kind of that thing where he just kind of lost in his own world. Like he won't, he's not on iTunes. I don't know if you knew that prince. No. Garth. Oh, I knew prince. While you couldn't buy a lot of history, I didn't know about Garth and Garth will, first of all his um, Chris Gaines is wiped from the Internet. So good. Yeah, but, but Garth is not on iTunes or any of the other places. He's only on Amazon. Why? Because he made some fucking giant, well first before all that shit. He's like, fuck iTunes man. I'll just make like Garth's p threes and so on myself.

Speaker 9:          00:58:11       Yeah, it's on his website. You could buy like, I really think it was called, I think it really was called like GP threes and you get five directly from him. Like he likes his own initial a lot, but yeah, exactly. It's like, no dude, that's not how this shit works. You know? And it's like, it's like the idea of like in the old days, he would build like a Garth records next to tower records thinking and people would just go in there. He's like, I'm not playing this fucking game. He's like, I'm only going to make my own versions of MP three and some on the website. But people don't go to people's websites and buy no, you gotta be where everyone else is buying albums. But now you finally, and I'm sure Amazon paid him a shit load and now here I am endorsing is telling people to go to Amazon.

Speaker 9:          00:58:48       But yeah, to own you. Only way you can listen to in digitally is Amazon. That's crazy. What about in the studio? G me Studio G's. Got It. Let me ask you this about, I'm still curious cause I know nothing about it. But you know, in comedy if a huge comic, um, once you to open forum, it's usually a personal connection. Um, like you would actually talk to the person or maybe like their assistant or something. But when you book a major music tour, like this kid rock thing, is that a purse like d does he call you or is that just like your agent talked to his, yeah, my manager talked to his manager, but I did, I played, he has a thing called the fish fry. He's like kid rock fish fry. It's like a summer festival was in Nashville and I played that last year. And uh, we, you know, talked for a few minutes and he mentioned maybe torn with him and then he went on tour and I never heard, like, I was just like, oh, I guess, yeah, it happened. Let me call it for this fall tour. I was just like, obviously,

Speaker 5:          00:59:42       yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:59:42       Came around or you know, something opened up and um, yeah, just got the, you know, do you want to do it? I'm like, hmm, yeah, let's play some fucking, you know. Okay. It's like I was saying before, I can always picture this music in big places. To me, they sound like fucking anthems. So just to even, even if the crowd isn't true, my guess is kid rock fans probably get to the show early and start drinking. But even it was an empty fucking empathy or it's still be cool to plug and play those big fucking

Speaker 5:          01:00:06       oh yeah, yeah. I bet they get there early and party. Yeah. Yeah. And by the way, empty. There's still thousands.

Speaker 9:          01:00:13       Exactly. That's the thing too. I got it. Probably get used to which is looking out and seeing empty seats, knowing that still 10 times the audience I usually play.

Speaker 5:          01:00:21       It's a pretty crazy, pretty nuts man. Um, so this is a, I dunno, this is an anti drinking. What is this anti drinking ad from New Zealand. Okay. I don't know how to, I haven't seen it yet, but let's see what it is.

Speaker 7:          01:00:57       Want it just killed again.

Speaker 9:          01:01:13       I guess that is a reason not to drink. It's doesn't seem like near the top of the list.

Speaker 5:          01:01:17       No, I mean he was swinging kids around when they get hammered. I mean, yeah, it's not my first,

Speaker 9:          01:01:24       by the way. I do that sober. I also wouldn't go crying. You're crying. Just sit outside. Right?

Speaker 5:          01:01:30       Sissy. Well, you know, it'd be interesting is to get a wheeler's reaction on those videos from last week. Oh, please. Just which ones? I know which ones.

Speaker 9:          01:01:41       Okay. Yeah. I want to see it now

Speaker 5:          01:01:42       just to tell him I to just watch. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:01:52       [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          01:02:03       it actually, that's, he turned out better than I thought he was going to. I mean, okay. Face, it's kind of funny, but that scream, it's a funny screens. A great screen, but also when you play it, I was like, fuck, am I going to watch somebody die? You and like, that's like, that guy needs to hit the hit the gym.

Speaker 2:          01:02:24       That's a good scream. It's so, so that's one verified funny. Yeah. Um, this is a nother one. This is a guy,

Speaker 9:          01:02:34       I always hold the cause the last one then you'd think he's like, why exactly were they filming that again?

Speaker 2:          01:02:38       Yeah, I fill him in the car. Come off. Oh no, he didn't jump that far. I mean, that's an uncomfortable jump for sure. But yeah, I mean his, he broke his leg. That's an off off the top of a truck thing. You know, but I'm saying he didn't jump 20 feet, you know, he probably jumped, what, six, seven? He played shit. That was probably like the 12th time he broke his ankle. So this is a military exercise. A bunch of guys jump out of a plane and this guy's parachute is open, but apparently it's not.

Speaker 3:          01:03:10       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:03:10       I dunno. Not a hundred percent the way it's supposed to be. Okay. Okay. So, so you know, he's looking at

Speaker 3:          01:03:18       shit.

Speaker 2:          01:03:21       How's he in there right now? Yeah. See they're all, he just knows.

Speaker 9:          01:03:35       I mean that, that, that's, that means definitely verify. Funny. Yeah. That one you don't know sometimes when you know you're going to get her. I sometimes scream extra cause it, I know it all. I kind of, yeah. I wonder if he's doing that. I don't, I'm curious what happened to his parents,

Speaker 2:          01:03:48       but actually supposed to be called horrible are hilarious. And you're two for two that they're hilarious.

Speaker 9:          01:03:53       Yeah. But also anything with a parachute if you're okay. I think yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:03:57       you can use. Okay. Yeah. I don't think this guy broke anything. Oh, he definitely

Speaker 3:          01:04:02       leg. Oh, oh,

Speaker 2:          01:04:10       it was army. Yeah. He knows.

Speaker 3:          01:04:24       Oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:04:29       It's not as hilarious. Like I see the sounds are funny like I get, yeah. Now by the, you're laughing at more than that. Like you like that the guys are getting hurt. No, I don't. I think those are a little bit funny sound.

Speaker 9:          01:04:44       It's definitely funny if someone is hurting, it's not you if they live. Yeah, that's, that's, yeah, no, yeah, yeah, totally. What I was thinking about that, I was on a southwest yesterday and I'm like, I love, I always get the window seats that people don't bother me and I'm just sitting there next to the fucking window, like looking to my right. Like does this guy have the strength to pull me back in? Like in case it gets sucked down. Yeah. Cause I actually, I posted on Instagram, I said, you know, hey southwest, if I get sucked out this bit before I'm playing, took off, if I get sucked out this window, you know, put this window, make sure this window goes to the country music hall.

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       Um, somebody, I dunno who is very, uh, expressive about pronouncing my name correctly. I've never had somebody like, I don't,

Speaker 9:          01:05:28       hey guys. So this is a Latin American comedian that like I am obsessed with, named Tomas said goodbye and uh, what's it like? I always hear people like, there's a lot of people know him, but they always the Tom's the girl. I'm like, yes, I know my security. I, I feel like, are you lying? I'm so tired of her running around like pretending that people's names aren't pronounced. Like, my name is Joshua Brown. Okay. And that's not a hard one to do. Yeah. So Bert Kreischer no. Yeah, Joshua Brown. Tomas said Vladimir Uproot Latin America. You can start getting it right. Yeah. Police.

Speaker 5:          01:06:19       It's good. It's good point. Joshua, you got, you got diverse fan. I do. [inaudible] it's comfortable. It's nice to see your fans telling you you're saying your name. Say My name. Yeah. Yeah. I would appreciate it if mower of you said it like Josh did correctly. Tomas say Google.

Speaker 9:          01:06:36       Yeah. Yeah. I was actually just thinking about you the other day because I got it. I got a new place. I got a new place in a new place in Nashville and I was the, the guy runs the building yet it's like, Oh man, I'm a big, cause I was kind of hope they don't know who I am. Yeah, right. I'll fuck is like, cause they do it. Got To do background check. I think it's like they get worried about maybe not getting excited about the place, but the dude was cool and he's like, man, I don't know if you, you probably get the same thing too. There's a man I love Tom Segura. Yeah. I'm just like,

Speaker 7:          01:07:04       okay,

Speaker 9:          01:07:05       but you get probably get about other people. I'm like, yeah, well I was on his Po, you know, what are you thinking about me? Like I mean I get that too. Like shows, you know, man fucking Rogan, you know? Yeah. And I'm like,

Speaker 7:          01:07:16       okay,

Thank you. I'm a flying back and forth and I, I added a couple of shows to do while I'm in town because you have days off, you know, when you're shooting. And so, uh, for the first one, a bunch of bunch of crew, you know, they, they told me they wanted to come, so I leave tickets for them and same thing has happened. I'm going back next week and the next day, like I didn't see a lot, most of them after the show, but I see them the next day on set and a, a crew people, a woman was like, I was a lot of fun last night.

People claim you, um, who enjoy you for whatever they can claim you for. Sure, sure. Yeah. I spent time growing up in Florida. Floridians will be like, you're a Florida boy. I was born in Ohio, Ohio. People be like, you're an Ohioan. Very true. So if somebody is like, you know, I've had people come up to me like Super Latin people after the show. You're one of us. Like, they are, you know, they identify with that part of me. So they're like, that's who you are,

Speaker 9:          01:09:14       right? Yes. What? Everything, you know, it's like, um, yeah, I get the Kentucky thing a lot too. Like there was a map of like, you know, country stars from Kentucky, but I'm from central Kentucky so it was cool cause I was, they put my face like they show like, you know, Stapleton Sturge that everyone's from. My head's like right in the fucking middle. Like in there. Everyone was comments like, you know, why the fuck is he in the middle? It's like they're just show him where he lived, where he lived. Right. They're all so fucking surrounding. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:09:41       Well I got it set on Wikipedia. It says I was born in Toronto, Canada, which is not true. I'm proud Windsor native. Right. Windsor, Ontario. So much better. So much nicer. So much.

Speaker 9:          01:09:52       What's that last one? I've never been to Canada. You never been? No, we got it. I get, well, yeah, we, we do. The tour is going to hit there, right? This tour won't, no. Yeah. No. I got a tour there sometimes because we do sell a decent amount of records there. I got it.

Speaker 2:          01:10:05       How much of a will the tour hit the whole nation? What they could arrive one?

Speaker 9:          01:10:08       Yeah, I mean, I don't know the exact, I do know, I know for a fact we're playing California and I know we're playing New York and Florida, so those three alone makes me. Is there an la show? No, there's um, I don't think or maybe one of the, you know, like one of those things that I think might be kind of considered out lately. Maybe some kind of, or shoreline amphitheater. What's that?

Speaker 2:          01:10:30       The shorelines that San Francisco? Yeah, it's near there. It's massive. Like there's something else I've done the shoreline, it's really crazy. I do like Riverside or San Bernardino right outside. I W I don't remember. I want to open up for Ted Nugent way back in the day and he had, he played like at near Riverside or something like that. We open up for Ted Nugent a million years ago and I was not qualified and I ate such shit. It was the worst thing ever. It was like a hard gig. It's did in the old days. So far, a lot of comedians open up for rock, like rock stars. So that seems, that seems fucking hot. I would turn it down more than 100% across the board. I should have. I just did it knowing it's not in my audience at all. Dude. I've almost heard no stories

Speaker 8:          01:11:13       about,

Speaker 9:          01:11:14       yeah. One of my first shows, I did two shows for David Allan Coe and the cause of the, I didn't get paid shit. So the first show to, to pay for a van, the second show, I just did the first show acoustic by myself, which is probably close to, you know, the point being, you know, you can hear it, you know, you can hear the fucking crowd talking to. I just, I just can't stand that.

Speaker 8:          01:11:36       Yeah, no. [inaudible] has that great story about opening from a, for Brendan flowers when the killers, I don't remember. It's great. It's, but I mean, I'll let him, I think he's told it. He may have told it on our show, but he's definitely told the story yet. Why Joey Diaz do a bunch of dates out here with me. How was that? Was fucking great. That's different though. It's different. Yeah. Because he can really get them psyched. I mean, it was, it was, it was a perfect match and the shows are great and people, you know, he gets heads kind of like a, there's kind of a, you know, Rockstar rob where he's like kind of screening people, you know, and to them. Plus you go on that podcast and tell people you're playing all his guys show up. So that had to be fine. That was really fun. Yeah. Um, was that at the Microsoft something here? It was something, what was it called? The Novo and Novo, I think it is. Yeah. I remember seeing does that big venue. Yeah. I mean it was big for me. It was like, um, I dunno. Theater like 1500 or something. Yeah. But isn't that, it's a downtown area? Yeah, I think it, and they have an adjoining other venue. Bikers. I Dunno.

Speaker 9:          01:12:35       Here's all, he's the only thing I know, which I've never made before, but it's a moms your moms house exclusive. I hired off Craig's list. Um, I hired protestors to hold up, you know, like, you know, screw wheeler, all this stuff. And we hired him and fucking paid to these dudes, whatever, 20 bucks a piece for half an hour to protest my show because I was going to film it and go out there and then I was going to fight them all. That's hilarious. And uh, because it's, it's like that Kinda like downtown area. It's like there's a bunch of, it's like across from staples is a bunch of shit there and they fucking bus, they, they wouldn't allow cameras and, and they made the protesters leave and I tried to, I was like, you got to explain it. It's hard to explain to the cops that it's a fucking, it's a bit, yeah, I paid fucking paid them all. So I had a whole thing ready was I was going to fucking, you know, she put him in choke holds and take them out, you know, and then fucking, you know, and we, I'd called all the local news stations to come out too. I'll be dead. I don't think anyone in my showed up because there was nothing to show up too.

Speaker 8:          01:13:33       Yeah, it's too bad. Um, this is a, if you've ever heard of the pink preacher. No, this is a guy. I guess he, I don't know. I'll just, I'll let you see what he does.

Speaker 13:         01:13:46       Vino here and I'm joined by the pink preacher. Awesome man. So, hey, it's great seeing you here and you look incredible. I mean, you look awesome. Thank you man. Yeah, I love your hair. I mean, thank you.

Speaker 8:          01:13:59       It's, um, it's also, that's a such a indicator when somebody says like, great to see you or something and you start laughing. Like, what are you laughing on man? Why are you laughing at that? What is your story, man?

Speaker 13:         01:14:13       What's your story? A couple, um, well, basically, um, three months ago I was in bed around 11 o'clock at night sleeping. I'm a great sleeper and God woke me up and says, uh, he had me go to my phone and on my phone was a photo of a billboard that I've said, read this and it made me laugh and said, don't go to church. It's all fake news.

Speaker 5:          01:14:33       This is, I guess, somewhat reminiscent of people you see on Hollywood boulevard. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:14:39       It's exactly to, anytime you hear, you know, what's your story? This, this long story. The story begins three months ago. Yeah, it's not, it's not. This is not hit his life calling. Really. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         01:14:50       What happened is God pushed me in that night. Now again, it's around 1115 then I, then I saw that in Oklahoma. I followed the links in the article and they said that in, in, in March or having a atheist convention. Well, God says, I want you to go to that convention.

Speaker 5:          01:15:05       Do you fucking, I feel like there's people who went to high school with him who were just like, oh, Ronny was a piece of shit. Like they're watching this right now.

Speaker 8:          01:15:16       That's the look of that guy does not need to be near the Internet. You know? It's just like everything. Like God had me click this link. You God, God asking me to buy this fucking plasma screen on Amazon Shit. You know, God told me to go order these classes in that stupid fucking piece of shit goes to nightclubs and preaches.

Speaker 13:         01:15:37       The reason I wear the crazy outfit, I do something called a nightclub organization outreach. It's three and a half years ago. I again, God stopped waking me up at, I'm not at 11 o'clock three and a half years ago, I was sleeping. God woke me up and says, gold a minister. I said, where God's seven 11 cause what's open? He goes, you're going to go to the nightclubs. Now Watch, this guys had been married 10 years. I go in, I said, Hey Ernie, I'm going to go to the nightclubs because God wants me to. She says, she says, okay, I'll pray for you.

Speaker 8:          01:16:04       I hate him so much. He imagined is his probably his wife. Toni was bringing my weight, was praying. Do is you want, you should go out at night to night clubs and preach. Yeah, whatever gets you out of the fucking house.

Speaker 5:          01:16:14       It gets you away from God's will. Made it go to strip clubs. Dance isn't Duke. Okay. So do you remember the guy that made obviously the prank call your voice? So we had a listener make a call using Christina's voice, her actual voice recordings of her call a sex line, and talked to the sec operator that she was into scat play. Like I'm not singing, but it was from fans. And uh, even when they had Christina go too far, uh, like said something about Hitler and the sex operator was like, that's a little too much for me. I'm like, it was really, really well done. Now they are having, uh, I guess this is a call that they used me, my voice, I think Ari Jo and maybe Burt, I haven't heard it. I just know that

Speaker 10:         01:17:10       this is, is it the same dude? I think that the same guy made it. Yeah, same guy made it. Yeah. Hey. Hey. How's it going? Good. How are you even joined the day?

Speaker 8:          01:22:19       Was that, I'm curious what joy was talking about.

Speaker 10:         01:22:21       [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          01:22:32       sorry.

Speaker 10:         01:22:38       Oh my God, it hurts. Fuck, I got hurt so bad. This card, what's the big deal? Jesus

Speaker 8:          01:23:02       is real degenerates there. Just like a constant like guys in the background, guys just doing this guy's fucking in the background. Really intense. There's one last clip I have to, we owe them the respect to play the last, how does it end?

Speaker 10:         01:23:21       Yes. [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          01:24:02       your time is up for this call. Goodbye. That's it. You don't get, you don't really tie up the story. A lot of guys, I don't even know that. It doesn't even say the name here, but you really are a master of these. Jesus. Really, really impressed. Thank you for doing that. They prayed to pay a ton for that call too. Yeah, that's true. You know, my friends, we'd get those like $100. Their parents will get those hundred dollar bill, you know, you'd call sex operators. We prank him. You know, cause I think it was kind of like we wanted to, we were horny that we actually wanted to call them, but we didn't pretend it was a prank, you know? Right, right. You know, like tell, you know, talk about your boobs. You know, you get real sexual and we'd just be fucking giggling and shit and then they call my parents and like, I wasn't like 100 bucks a hundred bucks for that.

Speaker 8:          01:25:01       It was always you. They're like wheeler came over. Yeah. I mean it was, it was, it was fucking, I mean, well you're from kind of a smaller place to was just, there's just nothing. The fucking dude. Yeah. I never did it. I never called. I think it was probably more terrified of, of uh, getting in trouble. Yeah. Yeah. You do much print and print calling though. We did some prank calling. I remember one time in the, in the sort of the same way, uh, would prank call cute girl. Like girls we liked from school call and hang up or like, you know, do voices. Yeah. It was fun before caller ID and shit. I remember before Koller idea girl knew that was so terrible. We used to, we had one buddy who had, um, who was the first guy we ever knew who his parents are. I think his dad was in some kind of business. They had two phone lines. So we would do the, we would call two people at the same time and if they picked up at the same time, they'd be talking to each other. So we would call like a girl in high school, like a guy who had a crush on a girl in high school and you just hook them up together. So he thought she called and she thought he caught and they're just like that, you know, who is this?

Speaker 9:          01:26:04       You know, that's really easy. Oh it's Brad, you know? Oh thanks for calling. I didn't call you anything. We just listened to them basically because we were basically gels, you know? Of course, you know when this girl told me, this is like fifth grade man, she was like, I know that you called me. And I was like, I didn't call because we'd called obviously and I don't know how they, I back then it was like you have to ask the operator. We, I, we had busted a couple of times people would, uh, call. Yeah. I don't know if it was the cops or somebody within you that I just got a threat on the phone. Can you yeah. And you have to get like a, I remember you get like a, um, like a reverse phone phone book. It tells you what the numbers are.

Speaker 5:          01:26:48       Yeah. Um, yeah, I dunno. It definitely the game changed for sure when, uh, when it became everybody has caller Id

Speaker 9:          01:26:57       d oh yeah. Cause I, you know, I'm doing the wheeler podcast where people calling on my voicemail and leave messages. So I did it, you know, obviously I want it to be real, having a real phone and now it is a real song, but got a new phone. So we're doing it when people have cut podcasts, people calling all answer the questions. What line do they call it? You, you, you get a second line. Yeah, I got a second line for me, but it's still my real name. This one's don't want real number. Oh, it is? It's on my, it's on my Twitter and my Instagram. You can call in and leave messages. The messages wheeler, the Wheeler Walker Jr podcast. It's just a season two coming up. Um, the same people, the ATC though seem dude's you're working with? Um, oh yeah, they're great. They're awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Helped me out a ton on it because I can't do all that fucking shit. I can't, I'm not, this guy can't edit and shit, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:27:42       Yeah. Um, you don't have a, I've had a bunch of bets challenges with Bert Kreischer and uh, and you fucking killed him on the weigh loss. Oh yeah. Yeah. Let's look. You're still keeping it off to yeah. Try and men, um, my workout four or five days a week. Try not to eat dog shit all the time, but this is a dog shit eating challenge. So you know, doughnut holes. Oh fuck. Yeah. We're going to see who can eat more than 12 minutes. Who's, who's wheat? Burt and I. Oh, it's a contest.

Speaker 9:          01:28:13       It's kind of the anti contents that you had before. It is the anti contest. I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna. I'm gonna, I dunno. I think I feel like births, the Kinda guy who could really wove some food down and he feels like he's like been at a million parties where people have lost money betting against him on and know somebody you prior to sing at all.

Speaker 5:          01:28:31       Now this, this somebody said here, this is a no suggestion. Famous drinking game of participating. Call it power hour. It's the rules are simple. Drink one shot of beer every minute for an hour straight. No more or less. I feel like this would be a great dynamic for the donut challenge. Simply set an alarm to go off. Eat one or two doughnut holes every minute until one of you taps out. No, because that would take too long. I don't want to fucking ass. No Fun. That was a horrible so you got to do one. Yeah, you can do it on a podcast or sad. That's why we set a time limit. It's about how many can you eat in a time limit.

Speaker 8:          01:29:02       Do you think? Part of his thing we'll be doing or either one. Are you going to do more than like show a bunch in at once? Well, I saw him yesterday, I'm on Instagram on his stories. He was at the airport and he stopped by a Krispy Kreme and he kept posting him self eating different donuts. Like yeah, it's, it's a, it's a good question. Which is theory would work the best because it's like one a time you can go fast, but like five at a time, it takes longer to chew. Figuring out the donut

Speaker 2:          01:29:26       challenge, you know. And what are we talking about now? Which part of the same? Like would you do multiple ones at once? Like in other words it was called, you could do like grandma, man. Well it's time. The essence. Yeah. You're up against the clock. How much? 12 minute time limit. Ooh. Yeah. And I think that's the advantage of doing the doughnut holes is that you can train two at a time. You're right, you can go one. I was gonna say maybe squash them together and then that's a good idea. But that might be an unfair thing. What if it crumbs leave and then now that that contributes to it being a lesser donuts and interest, that's volume. Yeah, we got it. We got, who's the judge for this? I am. She's going to be the judge. I'll have to think this through. I got it. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:30:04       Say the more I taught, I've talked to people about it. The more I realize how formidable and opponent for eating Burdis no. Everyone has been saying and they're like, I bet that Duke can crush them. Donuts. No,

Speaker 2:          01:30:18       wait, now have you two decided on the type? Is that an old fashioned doughnut hole? Chocolate. I'll call him after this. I think we should decide and you guys should have to do the same type of donut. It only seems fair.

Speaker 8:          01:30:30       Yeah. I'll let him pick. I let him pick. Okay. You're, it feels like glazed would be the one that's the old, the classic. I think that's going to be less dense than the chocolate, but for some reason the chocolate donut holes, chocolates. I think the other thing you're going to think about is I think as I'm thinking about, I think you're going to realize how long 12 minutes is.

Speaker 2:          01:30:48       Ooh, it's like a point you're going to be shoving him in your, I'm thinking like how much longer are you just going to let you remember? 11 minutes. 30 so it's a good point. Cause how long is Nathan's hot dog eating contest? It's like that's nothing for a couple of minutes. Yeah. Yeah. Those guys. Yeah, you're allowed to do that because that's their big thing is water, right? Yeah. Yeah. You can, that you can do water, get them wet and shoved them. Now do we want to allow, that's a good point. Wheeler, do we want to allow water dunking and milk or what do you want to, can you add hot to hot dog buns?

Speaker 2:          01:31:18       I'm just thinking about how long 12 minutes is. So you can do a lot in 12 minutes. I mean, what's, uh, what's, I mean like the coffee, how long was the Cosby show? I was like, it's like half the colony to ice. Does watching the Cosby show. I didn't do, I didn't eat them nonstop. I have to show the last time I feel pretty full. And then you're like, you got seven minutes left, so, so then maybe take a little break. Maybe the challenge here is not so much cramming two at a time, but pacing yourself. Finding what that pace.

Speaker 8:          01:31:53       Yeah, I'll bet the winners. If you just one one one is the way to do it, then you just, if you eat a boy that's just not

Speaker 9:          01:31:59       going to make yourself sick and you just do it, you know, tortoise and the hare. But see that's the thing is I don't think he'll go slow. No, I think he'll do three at a time nonstop for 12 minutes. Yeah. I think the final score is going to be some funny like 82 to six or something.

Speaker 2:          01:32:15       I think you're right. I think that Burke tends to go in excess. He's good to do the Mickey Mantle Jean thing and like really cramps. You know, people have told me, you friends, men, uh, you eat fast. And then I've only been in awe of him. I've never even come close to his.

Speaker 9:          01:32:36       Yeah. Here's my, here's my advice and I don't like giving people advice, but you got to stop challenging a guy whose name is the machine. Yeah. Right. Yeah. You know, he emceed and get them. It's not some nickname that just popped up. Yeah. And he's a machine at every, I mean he probably got them name machine probably started somewhere with doughnut holes.

Speaker 2:          01:32:53       Yeah. Well I'm a, I am worried about you. I mean you, I think it's a certainty that you're gonna get sick. Yeah. I'm going to get sick. I'm going to get sick. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:33:02       I think that's true. I think that should be a rule that if, I mean diarrhea didn't yell, but if you throw up, but you can count.

Speaker 2:          01:33:08       I think that's how it is. A Nathan's hot dog eating contest. There's a certain time you have to fold it. The hot dog for a moment. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe we could do that. We have to hold it in for a certain amount of time. I'm definitely gonna have diarrhea 100% you think diary. Oh,

Speaker 9:          01:33:20       you know, while I'm on the road, I would say nothing gives me worse. You talking about what? Why ladies don't show up my shows because I had to want to talk about, but the worst, nothing gives me the shit worse than glazed donuts. I don't know why. I don't know what it is. All that sugar. It's just so, it's just like, it's just not, we have not good for your,

Speaker 2:          01:33:38       it doesn't affect me that way. It makes my stomach hurt, but I don't shit, dude, can we get a phone before we wrap up?

Speaker 9:          01:33:43       Yeah. I'll say, how have I seen my new single? Oh Wow. Okay. Yeah. I don't really have single ladies make videos. Don't wanna tell you about the video. So I was at it. There's this, there was this guy, um, his name is Reginald big black guy with a cowboy hat. He calls himself wheeler with a tan and he, he, um, lip syncs to my videos all the time and I'm putting on Instagram and then he can't, he can't come do a show in Dallas. And I just see it. I was like, it was like seeing my soup, my hero come life. He's like, man, I want to do a video video for you. I was like, fuck. Yeah. Like I was number and is, this is a song on my album called if my dick is up, why am I down? Yeah. I remember that song and then he made it. I was like, if you could shoot this video from a couple angles, we'll edit it together into a video.

Speaker 7:          01:34:25       MMM.

Speaker 9:          01:34:26       And he did it. It was pretty fucking cool. That's awesome. Well, thanks Reginald. You want me grab my guitar? Okay, great. Yeah, this is great.

Speaker 7:          01:34:35       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:34:35       How many of you think you could eat in 12 minutes? I don't know. It's picking the number. Seems really scary. How about one minute? I think about 60 seconds. That's, what do you think?

Speaker 7:          01:34:44       And then, I don't know,

Speaker 2:          01:34:47       five in a minute. Oh No. 25 25 yeah. 25 minutes. No.

Speaker 8:          01:34:58       Yeah, I think you might get a little sick one every 20 seconds. Maybe it's realistic. I, Tom, I think the key is to be realistic here because then you're going to pace yourself. We've got to train it, train on the pacing. Well, there's a difference between going for, there's a difference between going for one minute and go on for [inaudible]. Uh, you can add to this point. Just do whatever you need to do.

Speaker 7:          01:35:21       Hmm.
