Speaker 4:          00:12:16       Oh Man. I'm starting to get a little turned on right now. Ah, yeah. Ah Jeez. Ah, and then, and then as I, and then I finished and she goes, uh, yeah. I was just thinking about, I was playing a song earlier when you were like slick. You're like, I'm just looking forward to going like an eharmony and maybe meeting somebody that like I really click with and you know, we can listen to music together and just have fun. You mean I got a 15 year old girl. Why would she be 15 who listens to that ridiculous music listening to it. It was really bad. It was so damn. What are you guys going to do? You and your 15 year old guys can watch the voice together and we could call it and vote at the same time. I'd be like, who we vote for this week? And we could be like, I could be like the song. And she's like, yeah, I'm a tall, my friends, you're like the best DJ ever.

Speaker 4:          00:13:24       Panty Jenga party. And she's like, yeah, we're all coming. It's like slide. That must be what it's like to really date like a 20 year old when you're 50 or 60 year old. Oh, right. The person. That must be what it's like right now. Like I got, let's go to, what does that festival calm? I've heard the big scandal, apparently. Rumor scandal is that this chick that uh, Johnny Depp is a big black mailer. Like this is, yeah, all a conspiracy. You know, that she's faking that he's beating her and all this stuff. I believe, I mean, Doug Stan hub came out and he's a comedian and we all trust comedians saying that that's not true. And I mean, what do, have you ever known Johnny Depp to be a violent guy? Well, he's, I mean there's all the time that we hung out. He was always real chill.

Speaker 4:          00:14:17       So yeah. Well, he's so down to earth. No, I love Johnny Depp. Can I tell you? I don't think he beats her. I don't buy that. It's a sound. It's not an initiative. It's suspect, right? It's really like, well, I mean he's had so many other women in his life. Nobody's ever come forward. It would have come out by now if he were a violent guy and it was also interesting that they went to court. The the, the, the wife amber herd is her name. She went to court and ask the court for like, you know, all these things immediately. So she got her restraining order because the grant, those, if you request them then she requested spousal support denied. She

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       requested a right. Yeah. This is an immediate, you know, it doesn't mean that you're not going to get it in the divorce. She had requested, he paid for her legal fees, denied. She requested of their vehicle, denied the court, rejected all those requests and interesting. But she is must be a real evil person to do something with it.

Speaker 4:          00:15:11       Great. You can look at those eyes. I see those pictures. She cry. She loquacious. Beautiful. But it's just crazy. It's really, um, but I do, I love Johnny. I've always had a crush on Johnny Depp. I below the two of us are 21 jump street. I had a life size poster of him and my room growing up. Yeah. But he is insufferable when you listen to him on like the actor studio and he's like rolling his own black cigarettes, you know the craft like talking to craft and all that horse shit. All are, they all are there for all of the craft, the craft, any of them he gave that he gave a speech, a pretending to be somebody else for a living. It's such a challenge.

Speaker 3:          00:15:53       All that stuff is nauseated. He did a, he got an award recently, I guess right before this all went down. Yeah. Where when he got the award he thanked, you know, he's thanking people and he goes, I want to take my wife, amber, amber for forgetting her name too, for dealing with all these characters I bring home. Uh, I know it's gotta be difficult on her. It's hard on me. So all these people that I'm

Speaker 4:          00:16:17       inhabiting, that's why actors are not comics. Cause if you know you can't do it. No, that mean, how do you, how do I live with Tom [inaudible] Guerra, a talented comedian I with all these are the jokes and amazing things in your head. I know it's hard on you. It's got, I mean, it's really hard on me being so funny and so talented. And the thing is I liked that there's no pressure to be on what I'm owed. I mean, everybody's like Tom, Tom, make me laugh, make me the lash. Yeah. And I love giving to those people. I'm like making people laugh. It's my greatest joy, spreading joy. It fills me with a story, but tell it should show up please. Tom, please have black Dick joke. Do you have it still? Can I hear it? You do. Imagine if comedians talking about our process, the way actors talk about layers. Oh my God. Well I wake up around 1:00 PM I had just come on my stomach. I thought that's kind of drawing in a funny way. I should talk about that tonight. I wiped and I wiped and I thought there's a new bit, right? Yeah. I mean it's too much.

Speaker 3:          00:17:34       Yeah, they're so serious. So serious. But the, but I guess it needed serious and not so serious as to live together for, for the not serious people to thrive. Really. It has to be against all the serious people. Because if we didn't have the Johnny Depp's to make fun of you, it's like I've asked Steven, see gals, oh my God. I came to realization about, you know, I can't stand the offended people. Yeah, but you still need them. They'll always be there. Otherwise I wouldn't have a career. You need someone to go like, Whoa, I can't believe you said that. That's, thank you. Yeah, that's true. I was, thank God there's not an inside the comedian studio. That would be so funny. Is there other, I guess mark. Yeah, I saw him. He was really fun at the store. He does the seven 30 show usually with me or sometimes. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:18:29       Well that, that is inside the community is city, but that's all we talk about. It's like depression or shitty families. Our process process. So this was so fun. I got to get in. Well, I'll show you this first. Can we just announced that we're back on video because blue van, oh my God. You know what this fucking guy did last week? So let me pull this up. He got sick, he went and got sick. He went and got sick like a fucking dumb bird. And uh, so let me pull up our channel here. It's been getting bigger and bigger. Thank you for everybody that's been prescribing to it. And um, you know, watching. Yeah. So last week's episode goes up, it's episode three 45, I think, right? We've never ever had this many thumbs down on a video. And it's because there's no video. It's just a video of the audio, right?

Speaker 3:          00:19:30       She's so late, man. Let me, there are 54 thumbs down. So it never happened before to one of our episodes. So blue ban uploads this episode, right? I send them the file, he flies. It was nasty. Downloads it. Here it is here. And he says, due to genes being low and loose, there will be no video component. So like, of course impulse. That's funny. Yeah. Well except it's also very misleading. So I made sure to write here a little misleading that no video was attributed to low and loose jeans when in fact it's because blue band got sick, his nest got infected by some cardinals and he was doing better, but he wrote this on this vid, jeans are loose and not true. Bird is sick. Oh, okay. Because it's a very big distinction distinction. That's true. So I just wanted to make that clear. One could argue blue bands, logic being that he got sick and therefore his jeans became low and Louis, he should have, they should have put that in the text. You don't want to mislead the listeners, the viewers. People could just think like, we don't feel like it. Our jeans are loose this week.

Speaker 3:          00:20:38       I want him to be like, I got bird aids, fucking bird and you know, fucking bird flu brain's not that bad. There you go. You feel better now. Okay, we're back. We're packing video. A bird is fat and that has been, I wasn't going to, I just wanted to address it before we forgot because we get it wrong. You need to forget. First of all, a big shout out to the people who, who I think understood the distinction of just tweeting that to him without tagging us. Cause that way it's like, why am I getting these? Which I thought was great. Now some people ended up tagging us too, which is fine, but I really wanted to give a shout out to not tagging us because that is the idea of him waking up. Why am I getting this right? Once you see I as tagged in it, then he goes like, oh it's from them.

Speaker 3:          00:21:31       Yeah, the mysteries. It's better. Yeah man, it went so it was crazier than I could've ever imagined thing ever. And then Instagram is Instagram and here too. Oh, oh my God. The Instagram is what I didn't even realize. So my Instagram, God, thank you. It was called sex with me. It was amazing. So we told you last week, right? Cause I think what happened was I read a tweet from him where he called me fat. So I go right. It was something like, well we've been doing this kind of for a long time. I mean, we're years of, well, I spent a year or so of who's fatter you are. Yeah. It's always, you know, it's always the third. It's always bird, but it's always a thing and it's fun. So I just last week we go send him a tweet and say, why are you so fat? And then, and then it became a Hashtag. Bert is fat at the end. Dude. Not only did you guys sent him maybe over a thousand tweets, but I got it. Okay. Some of these are just incredible. So

Speaker 3:          00:22:50       that's really good for it. So fat, right Burt and I liked that. That looks delicious. You started just every tweet, no matter what it has to do with anything had been tagging it. Uh, Burdis fat bird is fast tag. Bert is fat, right? So you go all tweets or Burrito a full charge. And I are fucking up at the comedy store in La Jolla this weekend. You know, bird is fat. It's just, I think we should just all hashtag everything Burdis it, no matter what. No matter what. Then, uh, people were doing. Lot of shops from my photo shops are amazing. Who Does Vegas? Vegas seven Oh two crushes. She crushes the Photoshop stuff. Here's another one on hers. I think that's Joe. Joe. Joey's body

Speaker 3:          00:23:43       especially facile, that stupid grin on his face. He has the best expressions for fat guy stuff because his regular expressions always like, oh so you put that on like an enormous body. It's really amazing. Um, well then he wrote, he tweeted, cause he got after hundreds of them, he goes just when you think the joke is getting old and he, it was he tagged, he quoted as somebody who wrote braking and it shows these scientists looking at something under a microscope. The nation's leading scientists are working around the clock to determine why bird is so fat.

Speaker 3:          00:24:17       Then you put this up, I had so much fun the night more about nonbinary friends. Tomorrow night bird is fat and I also got them all saying a video, why is you're fat? And I got people at La Jolla, somebody put the civil war stand up team time team bird. Which side are you on? Oh, that's, and they burnt by the way, I'm the number one fat shaming person today. Oh my God. He put, I know exactly how Amy Schumer feels. I guess cause she had gotten, I dunno, some hatred or something. I think she had a picture of her in a bikini and um, some tablet, but she looked great. She's not fucking, this is like, no, she looks great. This is how, uh, let's be, let's be clear between Amy Schumer and Bert. Bert is legitimately fad. Oh, Bert parts. Enormous. Yeah. Amy's not normal. This is like if you just looked up his name. Yeah. He retweeted these. Burt, why are you so fat? Just curious. Why are you so fast?

Speaker 3:          00:25:22       So like is it a steroid thing? Thyroid thing. Why are you so fat? Hey, Burt Chrysler, why are you so fat? Then two accounts started of Burt Chrysler. Um, this one says breakfast tip, 600 kids have less calories. Three pancakes. You're trying to watch your weight. I put syrup in the Heinekens for it as fat. Six, I have less calories in three van gigs. Oh Man, bear Chrysler is the best too. Yeah, man. So then I'm talking to him on the phone Saturday and I look at something on, on, uh, Instagram and I go, I'll just, you know, I pulled up his, here's the comments Bra, all the fat, man, why are you so fat? Why the fuck are you so fucking fat? Low fat alert? Why are you so fat? So you guys went to his institute, Bert Chrysler, why are you so fucking fat? You are so fat. It's all fatty fat, fat burn. Why you so fat? It's hundreds of comments on every picture. And then he goes, he has to post, of course, a shirtless picture of himself just asking why so fat? Why so fat? Huge Fan. But why are you fat? Why are you so fat?

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       God, you're fat. It's endless. And I gotta say my favorite thing I've been a part of in years is this so much fun. He said that, uh, one of his daughters, it was posted on one of his things. He goes, sure, are a lot of people calling you fat today. Dot. Oh my God. So anyways, thank you so much for, I'm going to work guys. Really outstanding. That really was outstanding work. I mean, that one's my favorite. The breaking scientists or the breaking science thing is great. Yeah. And the photo shops or maze. Yeah. I mean, Vegas, it's really, uh, you know, we challenged you and I think you just leaped over the challenge above and beyond. It was really a crest dangerous. Once we get the mommy's on something, yeah. You Better Watch out. Watch yourself get on the mommy's bad side. I know. I mean, that's on the good side. We'd love, but, but that's, you know, so you remember a while ago the, the Trump song, right? It's China to meat, meat, meat, meat, meat, meat, meat,

Speaker 6:          00:27:54       China, China, China, China, China, China, China.

Speaker 4:          00:28:12       So it's so good. It's great. That's by a island. And then I finally, this week we got a Hillary song. Oh, now we can go back and forth, check out this Hillary song. It's by a place, Boeing, um, really, really great work.

Speaker 7:          00:29:02       [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] not a laughing matter. I take it really seriously to me because on all these mothers

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       don't. For me because I'm a or because I'm a woman, I'm a woman and all these brothers Don for me because I'm a woman, because I'm a woman, woman running to be the first woman president. Not Imagine anyone being more of an outsider, then the first woman can be more of an outsider than a woman president. I can't think of anything more of an outsider than electing the first woman president, a woman president.

Speaker 3:          00:30:05       It's amazing. So good. I love her laughing. That's the clap is so horrible. Really Tan. Wow. Good job. That's placed Boeing. Who did that one and then the Trump has had, I didn't realize has various China, China, China, China, China, China. Now did you read about his hair? You're telling me some article you read on why it looks so horrible. What's the story with him? It's, it's basically the, they come to the conclusion is hair is completely not natural. You know, obviously people are fixated on it looks terrible that it's a $60,000. We've, that he has an elaborate we've, that he opted for this years ago when there wasn't an option for him to do and obviously really expensive surgical one or nonsurgical. And he opted for the nonsurgical, which is that fucking dead dog you see on his head today. That's terrible. Yeah. So it's uh, but it's uh, it's a long read.

Speaker 3:          00:31:16       It's a really funny read about how elaborate his pro, let me see if it, but why does he have to style it like a Douche bag? That's the weird thing is the styling of it. Yeah. It looks like cotton candy. It's a Gawker piece actually. Um, so Google that Gawker Trump hair, Donald Trump hair Gawker and it's a yes. It's really, they go into incredible detail. Oh my God, it's so horrible. There's just so there's, so, there's so much of an investigation. I mean it really, really is elaborate cause it looks normal. If this is one of the interesting parts of the article was it said, um, look at what happened last August, part of a time interview when they had a bald eagle name, Uncle Sam. But in an act of performance, it was truthfully a bit too on the nose for my tastes, the living symbol of American pride. It's hack the angry orange candidate. And as Uncle Sam's wings flap frantically Trump's hair piece of migrated. It was ever so slight in ever so brief, but migrate. It did end in one impossibly solid piece. So it was hair removed all together. They chunky, they made this little,

Speaker 2:          00:32:32       you can see.

Speaker 8:          00:32:42       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:32:48       it's not his hair. You know, here's, here's the, Oh, they had it all moves together here. Yep.

Speaker 9:          00:32:55       Wow.

Speaker 4:          00:32:57       You can see it. So yeah, it's so bizarre. Dude. Look at this article is all about the hair. Why don't you think that one of his wives will be like, baby you, you got to divorce. You look crazy. The guy that started the, this particular hair restoration procedure used to have an office guest where my really helps in Trump tower in New York. And he has since left there, but they said that, you know, that's where, that's where Trump had this done. Oh, it's, it is really, really crazy. Micro extension. But he has to know. It looks like shit. I mean, of course she does, but we all have our own levels of delusion. You know my little face looks like shit though. He's orange and he, yeah, he looks so chapped and dry. Like that guy in the Americans, he just looks like a dry hot dog, you know. Would you like to like a dry Dick? A dog deck. What'd you ever kiss him? No. Like you just mouth smells. It's such a dad mouth. Yeah. He has a drill.

Speaker 8:          00:34:00       Charlie. Margaret. Just somebody from shiny shiny. Am I supposed to dislike?

Speaker 7:          00:34:17       Let's say China, China. China can't be.

Speaker 4:          00:34:34       Whoa, Beth's got into it. She liked it. What are you barking about? She hates Donald Trump. She's not voting for him. Which she's not going to vote. What are you doing this? You're just having a time talking to the voices in her head. Um, anyways, great music. Great submissions. Both of them. I can't wait for you to do some hair restoration. Are you going to do that? No. You're just going to let it go. No, I'm definitely of the, you know, everyone has the thought as the hair starts to leave, you're like, what should I do about this? But you know, it was pretty, I tried for, it was years ago. I tried it for a month. A pill. Yeah. But um, my doctor subscribed to me and uh, for one month I tried it and wow. Wow. I did not like the way I felt. No, it made you not want to have sex and it was still depressed also. Yeah, because testosterone, high testosterone can lead the hair loss. Right. Anyways, it was, I didn't like it. So that was it. I tried that pill and then I was like, I don't give a shit.

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       What about the Propecia? You can rub on, I dunno. Topical Ointment. I don't, I'm not that interested. Well, I would say that you might have a good chance of keeping your hair because if you haven't lost it by now, right. I mean it's thin, it's thinner. It's been this thin for the last 10 years. I'm saying no, it's the not more over the last 10 years for sure. Oh yeah. It's definitely, I mean it's on your mother's side is your mom's dad. He had that widow's peak. Go what I have and I don't know. Well, we'll see. We're getting that 23 and me thing done. Oh yeah. We'll see what's going on. I think it tells you all that stuff. If you're going to go bald and die and stuff, it says you're going to go bald. Die. Yeah. What you're going to die of. Thanks for signing up for 23 and me. You're going to go bald and die. Probably. Well, okay. I'm excited for that. Very exciting.

Speaker 4:          00:36:31       I'm a little upset. You told me the news today. A lot of people, this is memorial day as we're recording this and some people have been supportive of commemorating the Cincinnati Fart. Yes, yes. Now you came in the kitchen and you told me that some people are doubting the validity.

Speaker 3:          00:36:52       I, Cincinnati Fart. I can pull up. I just caught this moments ago. I mean, I was, I just happened to

Speaker 4:          00:37:01       I'm, and I'm so upset. I'm so beside myself. I can't even believe that people would doubt the authenticity of my Cincinnati.

Speaker 3:          00:37:08       Well, somebody wrote today, let us not only remember our fallen soldiers, but let us also remember the Cincinnati Fart. And, um, they, they did a salute. All give a round of applause. This says a fart. I saw that. Then Gary Thorne wrote the Cincinnati Fart is a myth. There is no documented evidence that ever existed. Wow. Okay. Pretty. It's pretty bold, right? Well then, well, let, let's, let's, let's continue then. Somebody wrote, let me guess. The Holocaust never happened either. Get Real, bro. Cincinnati fart matters. Never said that. Lots of evidence Holocaust happen. Unlike Cincinnati Fart, which is all hearsay. Uh, somebody said, well, I heard if you go to Cincy, close your eyes and smell deeply, you could still catch a whiff. Urban legend. He replied, yeah, we can debate this forever. But none of the change, none of this changes the fact that Bert Kreischer is fat. That's a good point. And then he other guy wrote, you're right, Marcos wrote, you're right. Why is burnt so fat? So it ends, it makes sense.

Speaker 4:          00:38:19       Well, allow me to address these please. Firstly that Cincinnati fart happened. And uh, in July of last year I was pregnant. We just gone on a cruise on of what body of water is that in Cincinnati? Uh, yeah, it's a forever. Whatever. Raw water. Anyways, I ate, um, the buffet, I had, uh, several different things. I had mashed potatoes, chicken, roasted vegetables, everything. I, yeah. And Look, the Cincinnati fart happened. I couldn't prepare for it. It's not as though we could get a camera ready is just one of those things that happen. Now. Tom was there to witness it was there and I, are you suggesting that my husband Tom is a liar? I'm not a liar. What did it sound like? Let's relive it.

Speaker 3:          00:39:06       Oh, it was like,

Speaker 4:          00:39:09       let's relive it. It's when I got back, I remember I stayed out later than you and I was tired. You retired back to the room. I took my cousins to a restaurant cause right. Um, yeah, we ate, we had drinks. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:39:21       Um, so we went out, I got back, I gave you a hug and then it happened tomorrow.

Speaker 10:         00:39:29       Oh,

Speaker 8:          00:39:34       uh Huh.

Speaker 4:          00:39:40       I mean my eyes almost fell out of my head. Yeah. I'd never heard anything like it. And the thing is, I felt that fart building all evening because I was laying down and I remember being like, oh, there's a lot of rumbles in this man guts. You couldn't believe it either. I remember. Yeah. That was never, ever seen anything like it, you know. Are we calling the hotel called the hotel room?

Speaker 11:         00:40:05       Good afternoon. Thank you for discovering the renaissance and Cincinnati downtown. How may I direct your call?

Speaker 3:          00:40:08       Hi Ya. Um, do you get to, can someone book a room to commemorate this Cincinnati Fart that happened last year?

Speaker 3:          00:40:27       Yeah. Well, yeah, I mean there's a lot of people. I have actually quite a few people that want to, I think it's room three, 1313 is that right? I think so. Three 31 I forget one of the two

Speaker 11:         00:40:41       at our hotel. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:40:43       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         00:40:48       Um, can I put you on a brief hold?

Speaker 4:          00:40:50       Sure. Yeah. The Cincinnati Fart. Thank you. Yes.

Speaker 11:         00:40:52       Okay. All right. So we actually don't have a real number. Is there any one,

Speaker 3:          00:40:58       is there a way I can check in which room I stayed in last time I was there.

Speaker 11:         00:41:04       Um, I, uh, do you remember around what time your stay was?

Speaker 3:          00:41:12       Yes, I can actually give you the exact dates.

Speaker 11:         00:41:15       Okay. So we've never actually had a fire in our hotel.

Speaker 3:          00:41:19       Oh, okay. Yeah, no, no, I, I didn't mean that. So last August, 1920 21 and 22 I believe. Yes. So last name would be Segura, s e, g, U, R, a, Tom and, and well, there was a few cigarettes, so this would be the one with Christina, c, h R. I. S. T. I, n. A

Speaker 11:         00:41:47       on on one second. SD, J. U. R. A?

Speaker 3:          00:41:49       No, no, no. S. E. G. G. Oh, I apologize. Yes. And the first name is Christina. Sure. It was undermining.

Speaker 10:         00:41:59       Okay.

Speaker 11:         00:42:00       And this was last year around August.

Speaker 3:          00:42:02       It's exactly, it was exactly August. Uh, I think 19 2021 and 20 and 23 we left the 23rd

Speaker 11:         00:42:14       okay. So was there a different name for saying that it could be under,

Speaker 3:          00:42:17       uh, yes. Thomas or Tom and then Christina? Yeah, we had the same room though.

Speaker 11:         00:42:24       Okay. So I do see a reservation that we did have for you in room 18 and your arrival date was August 19th

Speaker 3:          00:42:32       six 15 1618 six 18 now there was two Segura is there though with the same name? I just want to make sure I'm not because it's my dad also stayed there under the name Tom Segura. So do you see a second?

Speaker 11:         00:42:50       I do see a second one, but it has a different date of arrival. That one is August 21st Oh, okay. So we have to a cigarette.

Speaker 3:          00:42:59       No, you know what? I arrived, she arrived the 21st so that would be, so what's that? That might not be the correct room. What's that number? What's that room number? Eight zero eight eight zero eight that's it. That's it. That's the one eight zero eight yeah. Now can we do group packages for people wanting to pill? Yeah, cause I know people that want to pay extra just to stay in this room.

Speaker 11:         00:43:24       What was so special about that room?

Speaker 3:          00:43:25       The Cincinnati Fart.

Speaker 10:         00:43:29       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:43:30       Could you spell that for me? Yeah. F A r t like passing gas.

Speaker 10:         00:43:38       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:43:38       And it was like this elaborate huge deal. But I know that people want to like honor it.

Speaker 10:         00:43:51       I see.

Speaker 3:          00:43:54       Okay. So they can read, they can just request the room number then probably right?

Speaker 11:         00:44:00       Yes. And then there was a, I see something on the Internet. It says Sidney much room 1618

Speaker 3:          00:44:11       1618.

Speaker 11:         00:44:13       So I'm not really sure.

Speaker 3:          00:44:15       I don't think that's it. Oh, she's looking enough on the Internet. Yeah. Since 94 she says 1618 is eight oh eight. I remember it anyway because I have the alternative. There's an industrial band called eight away state and I remember thinking that it, okay.

Speaker 11:         00:44:30       So, um, the two rooms. So Mr Seeger, we had your in room 1618 on August 17th and August 21st we had you treasure or two reservations. It was a room share for room eight zero eight okay. Okay. One of the Bulls. Figure it out from there. Thank you so much for your very welcome. Bye Bye. Sorry, it was a little confused. Oh No, no, it's great. You're wonderful. Thank you. All right. You're very welcome sir.

Speaker 4:          00:44:55       Wait a minute. So at 16 eight I don't know. Here's why I'm saying that we have to figure out when you arrived. I rattled later because I got in and I got out. Remember cause I was so pregnant. Right. You don't want to stay long. So I got in and I got out, which leads me to believe that I'm the later check it and the 21st and didn't you move rooms? You started in one room and then we

Speaker 3:          00:45:17       Matt or something like that. Which hotels? That's what it was. I'm thinking eight Oh eight okay. Okay. Hmm. Well I mean one other thing we could do, by the way, what if you, you guys all search online? Cincinnati renaissance or Renaissance Hotel. Cincinnati Fart. Then whenever anybody starts typing in the Renaissance Hotel in Cincinnati.

Speaker 4:          00:45:49       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:45:51       It'll say Cincinnati Fart. If like a few hundred of you do it, it'll definitely Google. Well yeah, they'll definitely like why does it say this is that he fart when people look up our hotel. So here's the uh, the Cincinnati part. Oh my gosh. Yeah. So right now its renaissance hotel, Cincinnati c and right now the things say renaissance to toss him steady Ohio, Cincinnati wedding, Cincinnati parking. We can make it say Cincinnati fart right here. Besides Hotel Cincinnati Fart.

Speaker 7:          00:46:31       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:46:31       Now war room. Are we going? I does anyone know the precise location of this isn't a far as the first result. She must have looked that up.

Speaker 7:          00:46:43       [inaudible] 16.

Speaker 4:          00:46:45       Must've been the room. That was the route we must have talked about is we announced those, this is back then. Okay. Oh it's, that's why she goes 16, 18. Yeah, but she said six 18? No, she said 16. 16, 18. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So then I guess it's 16, 18, cause that's hot off the heels of the actual events. Spell that for me.

Speaker 7:          00:47:08       That's, that's what she was reading. She was reading.

Speaker 4:          00:47:10       Oh my God. How funny is that? Yeah. Hilarious. Well good. Now you guys know where to go. Yeah. Renaissance Hotel. 1618 you know what? Maybe just walked by eight oh eight and see if anything's there. Maybe you could still smell it. Yeah, maybe you do. I end up staying in that room. Please send us a picture. Uh, I like to see it, tweet it and be really funny. And it happened in the doorway and if you could actually in the doorway in form. No, it was, it was inside the room, Babe. Oh really? It wasn't, I didn't know my thought. I went to hug you and I'd come in the room. And where was I standing? We were standing like the bathrooms over here near the closet were in the room. And then I farted. Right. The Renaissance Hotel rooms 1618. So this girl just pulled this up.

Speaker 4:          00:47:58       She took it very seriously. Yeah. She googled Cincinnati fire fire. Yeah. She just, she just realized she was talking to this fucking face. So fun. It was amazing. Yeah. That's so funny. Do they have a banquet room there? Oh yeah. They have everything there. You know, maybe we should do like some huge, that's what I was thinking. Why don't we do the podcast from like their banquet room one time and then all walk up to the room. 1618 pilgrimage to the room and let's see. Yeah, maybe reenact it. And maybe you the reenacted, like civil war reenactment. What guys? It was a right here guys. Everybody gather around. The longest part of my life happened and in this hotel and I were, I'll never forget it. I will never forget that fart. That was a powerful long and it can only happen with a gift of pregnancy. Yeah. I think that was why it was so special. You're definitely, uh, yeah. Ooh.

Speaker 12:         00:49:07       My name is mark. I'm 20 years old and I'm in a relationship with 15 inflatable animal.

If, uh, if you're a parent and this is like, I was just thinking that if this was Ellis, yeah, I'd beat the shit out of him. Really old school. I'd beat the inflatable shit out of him. Snipe. Make them going. What might make them go harder into it though, right? I, there's some kind of, what's wrong with this guy? You know, there's a lot wrong with them, but how does this happen?

Now that I'm remembering it was we were up higher. It was 16th floor. Where are we? Yeah. I'm trying to remember the view and I just, I know I see them in my head but I, I know cause then Jane came over with Eric and they open the window and he was smoking out the window and I remember we were high enough to do that whenever he was smoking cigarettes out the window of our room. Yeah. You don't remember that? No, I don't remember that. Maybe you weren't in there. It was just pregnant me like hey, thanks for putting that out the window. Oh fuck man. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:56:48       I remember when they came here and smoke and we were like, no, we weren't. So again, did they? I don't remember. You weren't here. You were either out or in bed already. Yeah. And they went on a walk and you guys just go smoke. She goes, no, I go, are you ha do you have a breath mint? She's like, yeah, just, just breath man after a walk. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:57:11       Your sister also feels that liberty to just rummage through our pantry too. She studies, I have real sweat till thrive now. And she was just rummaging. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:57:20       You got, why do you got like starts opening cabinets. Refrigerator. But do you have hair is you don't have shit. Huh? Um, why are you opening your Oh, I can't look at my fucking brother. I can't look through your stuff. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:57:41       Can families a little worst? Isn't it just like whatever dude? No. This morning we are talking about a childhood stuff and uh, you asked me, you're like, were your parents super affectionate with you? And I was like, and I thought they were, apparently

Speaker 3:          00:58:04       I'm learning all this great stuff about my childhood. We were raised in basically a work camp.

Speaker 4:          00:58:12       See, my therapist says, she's like, you grew up with extreme deprivation. I'm like, it wasn't that bad. Come on. Like I, I even am like we were, cause we smother our son with so much. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:58:23       Physically to the point where he's like, yeah, he's like, cause I'm just all day hugging them, kissing and hugging or kissing, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss till he's like, sometimes I'll kiss him, he's happy and I'll keep kissing him until he cried and he'll be like, stop it. He does this. It's too much affection. I can't stop. So I go, Huh? I go, yeah. I was talking about my family, super affectionate to Latin, very effusive. And even my dad, my dad hugs, kisses all the time and I go, was it like this for you too? And you basically were like, like your, your brain basically stopped working for a second and you're like, excuse me. And I go, yeah. So like do your dad didn't hug you and kiss you go, well he would do things like grab my shoulder and go like, Hey, I love you. Okay. Like what?

Speaker 4:          00:59:15       Yeah, my dad grabbed your shoulder and squeezes it and he goes, I love you. Okay, I love you. And then he pats you. I swear to God. And you wouldn't get all over yourself? No. If my parents said that to me, I'd lose my mind. I know. Really? No. Now my mother would hug me, but I didn't like it cause I didn't like her. I didn't like her. Everything, you know, shoots every now and then she would hug me. It was, it was too hard and she smelled too perfumy and her hair was always like a helmet. So it was just like, ah. It was like, I didn't like it. We'll see that. I think about that. I understand that your dad's thing must be, because he also just didn't come up in it and affectionate household, you know, people usually duplicate what they're used to.

Speaker 4:          01:00:04       You know, and I don't know if you noticed last time I think he was here, he went to shake your hand. No, didn't I went to shake his hand. He gave me a hug. Okay, so he hugs, he hugs. Hello? Yeah. Now, yeah, that's after it being, you know, training him. Yeah. But no, he never, I don't remember him, you know, hugging me as a kid. You hugged me that day twice. And then when we went to his place, he hugged me again. Yeah, so he's, he's become more affectionate. It's an older person but happens to have some older people too, but not at, not in my youth. No, not really. No, it is. I love you. Okay. I love you, but like good morning kiss and stuff like that. No. What really? I Good Morning Kiss. Yeah. No. Oh God. You got home from school. Hey, good big kiss. You're hilarious. First of all, my parents were nowhere to be found when I got home from school, but like when they go home and relax, kiss you, you're out of your mind. Really?

Speaker 9:          01:00:58       No,

Speaker 4:          01:00:59       no. My mother would come home and I would hear her and I would hide, but he doesn't sound that crazy to you. If you think of it in this terms, imagine a Ellis getting home. Oh, I will. I'm going to go nuts. I mean, I go nuts. Just I haven't seen him in like a day and I'm going, no, no. It wasn't like that. My Dad or my mom would come home and they would say high or low or whatever. Treating you. They screaming in the hall law and then you go, hey, and that was it. But I don't recall ever being like, I'm so happy to see my folks, you know, that wouldn't be disappointed them down. You're going to eat or I'm gonna fucking make you shit. Yeah. So in Hungarian, I heard a few sayings. Okay. There's, there's one occur on buff on the cubs, which best sauce. That's, I'm going to hit your head so hard. You're going to shit in your pants.

If you're not into the Americans, great show to dive into and lose yourself for, we're in the second season. Yeah. Um, it takes place in the early eighties, so, you know, Cold War, they're KGB agents living in America under deep cover. Keri Russell, which is great. It reminds me a lot of you. Thank you.

Danny was such a piece of shit. I just, I love that Florida trash though. Are you feeling today? Oh, well, let's see what's on the chart today for how we feel about our gender. Let's see. Um, I feel I like this one. Arrow gender agenda that is influenced by your surroundings. I kind of feel like that right now. Okay. A little arrow. January. Oh hmm. Okay. What about affect, affect, do gender, a gender that is effected by mood swings. That's pretty good too. Let me see that. How about I just hit the scroll. See where we land, right? Yeah. Look, we're still in the A's right now. Okay, hold on. Okay. See transgendered, we know that once legit cause people about cut their stuff off to be that, that you got a real bio gender, a gender that feels connected to nature in some way. I'm definitely biogen. Oh wait, is there a dog gender cause I love my dog. So it's funny you mentioned that. Um, not only is there that there's a, there's actually this what, how did I know that?

Speaker 12:         01:04:34       I swear I didn't know this was coming from a role model and I'm not running around on the falls are looking country. I can totally understand why people would think it's strange to identify as being a dog. It's so well relax after a long day. I'm not having to cope with normal human life. Sure, sure.

Speaker 4:          01:04:53       I get it. I'm not having to deal with normal human car moves. Uh Yeah. Did they go number two outside like dogs and number money that you mentioned that no, I don't know actually. I know that that was so bizarre. It was you just feeling you're feeling very um, a canine gender today. Yeah. And connected to your bio, gender wow. Status. Which the two come together from your astral gender non binary. I can't be non-binary but then identify dog gendered. Right. I think you can, can I be, I am non binary and dark. Gender. Okay. I can't wait to meet the president and tell him.

Speaker 4:          01:05:41       And what Pronoun would you or should you be referring to me as because I am a dog gendered. Am I, it's a great question. A, I'm not a he she cause I'm on binary. Yeah. How would you refer to a dog? Well, it's a him or her, but they're non binary dogs. Maybe the, then you go back to the and then they and them preferred pronoun. Okay. Yeah. Okay. That's a great point. It was really good that you mentioned it. You have to say the right pronouns, pronouns, or not. Any preference. We show that. Do we have that on deck? Sorry to that guy because I feel like last week, oh right. To see him and he really needs to be seen and heard and validated and everybody needs to know the proper pronouns for that guy. Interesting. Color, gender agenda associated with one or more colors and the feelings.

Speaker 4:          01:06:36       Hughes. I can't read it. It's too small. Emotions and and or objects associated with that color. Maybe use like pink gender, blue gender, yellow jet. That is such horse shit. Color, color, gendered. They've, I mean listen, I think this isn't a front to people that really have gender identity issues. You know, if you're like I'm a man trapped in a woman's body, vice versa. This stuff, this has to be an embarrassment to people that are, have like Ge, like genuine gender problem or gender identity things, you know, I don't know what makes you say that? So this is, this is, I'm offended. I am a fan. Yeah. Let me see. I think like here's one burst gender agenda that comes and intense bursts of feeling and quickly fades back to the original state. Now this is under, where did you find gender fluid? support.tumblr.com guys, look at the site and figure out which gender you are and make sure to tell us and let everybody know your proper pronouns this week. It's really important that you let us know. We would definitely want everybody to get their proper pronouns in their, so astral gender colored gendered. I can, I think we could. Oh yeah. I think people need to see this guy, right? We didn't really show him before, so let's see if I can get into play. Don't you feel like this is totally offensive to people that really have like gender identity? We get her fucking,

Speaker 14:         01:08:08       this is the newest video on my Oscar gender terrorist playlists on my channel, Dakota, all my playlist because I posted anything in a long time. If you would like to know why, check out my ass Dakota life update coming out video there. You just want to make a video that I can link people to me. There's a lot of homage to everyone in the world to bear. My pronouns are not preferred. They're not a preference. They are mandatory for interaction with me. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:08:43       you know what's crazy? I don't want to interact with you all you've met. You've made us a lot of points. Yes, he's got, she shaved his eyes. Yes. Sorry. They shaved their eyebrows and sanity have their beard going and total insanity. But the eyebrow shaving is almost universally. Yeah. It remember the movie mental illness, the movie, the wall, Pink Floyd, the wall. There's a scene where he breaks down. He has a mental breakdown and he, I believe he shaves his eyebrows off and his hair and everything. And that's a sign of mental illness. Uh, royal Tenenbaums Richie Tenenbaum tries to kill himself. Yeah. He shaves everything off. It's a, it's a metaphor of some kind for losing. You're not, or just out of your fucking mind. You and I have eyebrows or walk the streets of downtown Los Angeles. And, um, every time you see somebody with a shaved eyebrows, just know that it should. It's really about to go down with them. Yeah. Shit's gone. And, and I love the, the Old Lady Turban. This is, I got out of the shower, my hair is wet and then the various Wicca Jars, you know, full of warlock things. And here's a apples and boy he has a little shrine. I chart for the DMV. I mean there's a low cut, low cut. So much happening for you. You know what? This guy is so fucking confused guys. I'm shit. I mean

Speaker 14:         01:10:01       expect everyone in the world's who understands. Yeah. Asia, you don't have anything to stand on. This is what you're going to abide by if you're going to be in our lives. And that's all there is to it. So anyway, I hope you guys are doing well. My Non Binary folks. I love you. I hope that you're having a fantastic time. I hope you have a good Halloween. Um, if you choose not to go out and you want to stay in and thank you for taking care of yourself. This is not something that you're obligated to deal with. I know it's hard for us at this time of year because you know, everybody thinks are fucking gender identity and expression and the whole thing isn't it? It's a fucking costume in the first place. So costume day is amateur night oftentimes is a little bit hard for us to deal with, so,

Speaker 4:          01:10:44       all right. How does he take, so he takes Halloween personally. Now it's a personal offense guys. Got You got so many problems. I'd say the gender identity is the last on the list. This guy's Super Jesus Christ. Fuck you. Come, come out Outta Camo gender. What's that? Well, you know you aren't cisgender, but you settled with your assigned gender for the time being. Okay. How about Delis? DALYSIA gender? What's that from the the Latin word. Delete him. Any favorite? Meaning that feeling of having more than one simultaneous gender, you are preferring one that fits better. I don't even understand that. While you shouldn't, I don't even understand this. Do you do? Are they teaching kids this Horse Shit in school? They better not be. I'll pull my phone. Okay. Where can we send Ellis that he won't hear about this dumb shit. Yeah, this is, I mean what such an asshole?

Speaker 4:          01:11:38       Yeah, I think it's an attention. I'm sub gender, mostly a gender with a bit of another gender. Fuck you man. May mostly age, gender with a bit of another gender. So I mean I don't even understand. How about surge gender? How's that having a gender that is 100% one gender, but with more of another gender added on top of that. You can't be more than a hundred percent that's so crazy. That's not even logically possible. Try Agenda, not listen to this shit. Try Gender. The feeling of having three simultaneous or fluctuating genders. You don't, they don't exist. There's only two genders. What do you mean three? There's a, yeah. Okay. You fucking square bug. It is a fucking, hey, wait a minute. Doris over here thinks there's two genders. Fucking retard.

Speaker 4:          01:12:34       Andrea, what is it? You know what it is? People are bored. There's nothing happening though. Life is so easy in America. We're looking for things to get all fired up about. Yeah, it does. It have to invent things to get offended about this fucking kid. If there's a war going on in his ass was about to be drafted into a war and you think there'd be time for him to paint his fucking nails and do his tats and fill his weird, which is actually like to see a video where they sent him choose. Yes. Less developed countries have him explain his situation. Yeah. Why don't you go to Kabul, Afghanistan and explain your gender problems. Don't announce to people I'm neither gender watch. And then they just go, he's a witch. Let's kill him. Alright, set him on fire. Um, our Budapest go to Hungary. My modern, amazing. Let's discuss.

Speaker 13:         01:13:25       Great. What about an hour later when I smell bacon I could eat. So at one point do you shut out the window? You ever do that for old time's sake? No, I in tubs because I just couldn't take it no more walls up while I was taking a shower. Why get out? No, let me tell you something. For some reason on, no, listen to me jasmine. If for some reason though for about two years, every time I hate going and I like shooting before I go in the shower, but I liked shooting before I go into the shower. I don't want to take a shot of him walking around with a dirty ass all day because at least you got a better, you got to stop every hallway and clean and then it gets hot out. I don't like, I like taking this shit before I go on the show.

Speaker 13:         01:14:05       But that like that day system don't work according to your fucking pussy schedule. Yep. Wash and then you come out. Some days I was taking a shower and sometimes the water would hit my back. I have to take a shit and he had some words. Let me tell you something. Would you want to dry off and to take the shit? And it does suck. It makes you have to go to the bathroom as soon as the water hit you. So sometimes you do something, a wet toilet and it's a horrible feel, worse feeling. It's a horrible feeling. So for awhile there I was just saying, fuck it. Let me just shit while I'm taking a shower. You know? I would either unscrew that thing. Sometimes I pick it up my hand and just draw it. Right. That's how disgusting I am. Sometimes I would just shit in Vegas. Sometimes I was eating pills and doing blow and I would just sit in the thing with my legs open like a Chinese guy. You know how they shouldn't try them, but only with water hitting my boss at the same time.

Speaker 3:          01:15:02       He's saying he would squat down into the drain and shit in the shower. Do you guys think I'm nasty? Oh No. This is a whole this, this is your Mother Teresa. Yes. Yes.

Speaker 13:         01:15:14       Guy's profile and watch the shit come out with all the barnacles. Oh, and then I get like the salt and push it down the hole. Yes, I would. I'm disgusting. I got to admit to it right now. Anybody who's ever taken a shower at Joey Diaz is out. No, not this outcome. I wouldn't do it in the hotel. Oh, okay. Oh Jesus. We should down the peanuts would get stuck to the thing drain. Couldn't go back down. Oh no,

Speaker 3:          01:15:38       we're speechless. Just when you think you know, Joey Diaz, we thought him shitting on the tree was cray cray. He has such a crazy story that I want him to, uh, to tell that I heard, uh, from somebody else in the whole story is the kind of story I have to check first. We were like, I can't just bring it up, you know? Yeah. That's not say no. I mean, I'm sorry, I'm still processing what I've just heard. Like I can't move on just yet. I need to process it. Hold on. He said he moves the drain thing and then he squats like a Chinese guy and shit in the shower in a way, you know, like as far as like addressing your workflow, it's, it makes sense. Like I have to sanitize my hands, but I want to also feel dirty. Just hearing. Yeah. I want to, I know it's so weird, right? I don't know why this makes me feel. I think I'm going to take a shower and just not shit right after this. Um, but he, uh, he's such a savage Charlie.

Speaker 15:         01:16:38       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:16:39       Does it makes sense to do, except it says no sense. No, it makes sense to do if you go to, to just shit where you're standing. It doesn't make any sense. Of course it does because that's because of the water cleans it. Know what I'm saying? It's so filthy and repulsive that nobody does it. If you were to be like, Hey, where should I? Shit, you just share wherever, like where the water's flowing right now. But you're shitting in the, yeah, no, you, you gave me so much crap. It's not, I'm saying showering and you're letting Joey get a pass on

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       squatting in the drain or I'm not explaining, well, what I'm trying to say, but I'm trying to say is on some level, the act of shitting where water is flowing makes sense. Except doing it where you're bathing is just so disgusting. You know what I mean? Like, it's like you're pissing in the river because it's right. The, you know, you don't have to get out and not find the spy. So you're saying, but it's so, it's so good. Disgusting that he above and beyond anything I could do or Ari. Ari and I are both straight shed the shower people shower people. This Joey, this is okay. I'm speechless. Yeah, it's a Joey Diaz has a wife. Doesn't that blow your mind?

Speaker 1:          01:17:55       Some woman. I love him. I love you Joey. It's just so great. Gnarly.

Speaker 4:          01:18:24       Okay. Alright, so it's over. It's over. It's over. Okay. What is wrong with you? It's in my dealing. He just made himself on his eating stuff. That's disgusting. You're going to fucking throw up there. It's gone. It's gone. I thought it was appropriate to play after shitting in the shower.

Speaker 1:          01:18:49       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:18:51       Are we done? Yeah, we're done. Y'all finished. Wow. We're done. We're finished and we're done. We're finished. And we'd done it. I hate that.

It's different. It's your boy. I know it's your boy guy and I'll be fine. Um, how bad do you feel like that is? What, what'd he did? What was going on there, Joey or the gagging a Joey. Uh, I just don't know how his wife handles that. It's a lot. You know what I mean? What do you use? I'm looking for what is this sphincter relaxation? What does that, I dunno, man. Must have been, it could be my mom. You can fucking tribe called quest. That's not a song. Is it? Sphincter relaxation. That's what it's called.

Speaker 1:          01:21:46       Oh Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:22:02       Cyber Dental update. Oh, I love these. How are your teeth doing? Are still yellow. Did you use the whitening size? How many times have you tried the white name? Once. Just one. Yeah. Did it burn a lot? Yeah. It hurts for the next couple of days too. That's good.

Speaker 4:          01:22:19       That means it's working. I'm going to do it again. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:22:21       I'm going to do it again. Yeah, you got to repeat it. Are they going to do it tonight? Okay. Been a while.

Speaker 4:          01:22:26       Uh, but I'm going to do it more often because you're not, you're not, I saw how much we're putting in, so it was too hot. You got to just put like A. Dot. I thought it wasn't dark. You are like, like a glop. There's a way to minimize the pain. That's definitely it.

Speaker 3:          01:22:39       Here's the deal. I'll update from some listeners. Uh, Tom and Christina, I just wanted to share my appreciation for the dental updates segment and your overall awareness of dental hygiene and care. You got it. The reason I shared the love of dental care is because I am a dental hygienist and it's my job to stop people from doing the stupid shit that people write in about. Fortunately, I rarely see that crazy shit because I work in a military dental clinic. Oh. And we are required to have a dental exam cleaning once a year no matter what. I just wish that people would understand. They get one set of set of teeth that last a lifetime and once those are gone, that's it. If you fucked that up, you're stuck with a lifetime of not biting into an apple and you're stuck with denture cream. Keep up the great work. I hope to make it to a live show one day. Remember, floss them shits, peace out. Fuckboys tray the floss boss. Thank you. Tray. That thing got kicked. That moved. Came. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:23:34       Um, I would like to ask the professionals out there and dental industry. Yeah, I have a cap that's kind of wonky. Let's a back tooth. It's Kinda wonkily placed. I'm going to have to replace it eventually. Crown Sarno. Cap a crown your own. Yeah. Um, thank you. And when I floss it, I feel like it's tender Rony like it's, it's just precarious and I'm just wondering, is there a way I can floss? Is there a technique I can use it? Maybe I'm just afraid of flipping up that crown if that's possible for flossing, you could do that whole thing of uh, going to a dentist or, yeah. I mean I was kind of waiting until I was a little recover from childbirth. Oh, you and your fucking son, Huh? Before I started messing with me. Wait, they can, did you give birth again or something? How learned six months go. You can't go to the dentist. They have your teeth checked. I had them cleans after I had Ellis. What? I have to have this crown replaced and I really put in that off. I've got to tell you I needed to do the new dentist because we moved. I don't have one yet.

Speaker 3:          01:24:33       I know we should call 'em oh, the doc and ask him. Oh, for real?

Speaker 4:          01:24:37       Yeah, we'll do that cause I don't want to go to one of these like showbizzy Dennis down here in La and the, you know they had jack you so fucking hard on these prices

Speaker 3:          01:24:47       and they do the whole thing where something happens to me and then you say it happened to you. Remember? That's the one

Speaker 4:          01:24:54       that's so funny. Oh my God. Did I swear? That's why I don't have dental insurance. Did they? Did it did. It happened that way to me. Maybe we could go to a dentist and find out why your teeth are so yellow candy. All right, look like candy corn.

Speaker 3:          01:25:12       Somebody else wrote in. Hey Mom and dad mouth. I just wanted to let you know you're talking about getting your teeth fixed. Don't mind the cost finally inspired me. Good to get the work I've been avoiding for a year. Good for you. It includes 24 months of nonbinary braces or gender fluid extractions, including a top front that needs an implant. As I've failed, I have a failed root canal with a huge abscess, which requires a cow bone graft. Fuck. Finally, jaw surgery. It's the final step to polyamorous to extend my bottom jaw forward to correct my bike, which has been the root of all these problems about six months and I'm so happy with the progress. Every time I see myself in the mirror I ask, Hey Hitler, where's the com? Yeah, it feels like my browns are all fours and I finally

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       got my life. Good for you. Weirdest thing is my front tooth, which is essentially a flipper. Oh, except it's connected to braces. Wire. Okay. All right, so he's saying that the fake to this connected to the braces. Okay. Yeah. Love from New Zealand where the gender pronouns are not optional. Fantastic. I wish I knew who wrote that.

You'll feel so much better when they look good for sure. Oh yeah, man. You know, sometimes I look at pictures of me and everything else can look all fucked up, you know? But if your teeth look nice, it totally look, makes you look so much nicer. Really does. Um, do you want to read some Fan Mail? I don't have it in front of me. I have it in front of me. Like do you want Oh, okay. Yeah. Put it up here. Sure. Here we go. The top. Yes. Hi Mommy. Just wanted to say fuck you. I wear a condom on my tongue. Love Danielle.

Speaker 3:          01:27:09       That's from last week, right? It was last week's episode. Who said that? Uh, the Cruzee arm Muslim guy. Oh, that's right. I'll fucking wear it. Kind of where my tongue. Yeah. Yeah. That guy was really nice. People are looking for that video. We got to put it on our site. All right. We've been rebuilding the site. If you, if some of you guys noticed lastic immediately. Oh shit man. We had a, a problem with our old site, so we got a new site built kind of a as much as we could. And what did we use? Squarespace. Squarespace. So it's a Squarespace site. And um, that's your mom's house. podcast.com. We're working on getting the clips. You got the Info on how to get those up there, right? So, all right, cool. We'll add those up. Um, here's another email.

Speaker 4:          01:27:51       Hey, Hitler's. Yeah, I had an experience today that I am not sure qualifies as a double pipe classic. Here we go. While at work, I went to the bathroom cause I stood in front of the toilet just about to pee. I felt the sneeze coming on and wouldn't you know it. I farted, sneeze and Pete at the same time, all three bodily functions shot out of me simultaneously. Oh Wow. I'm not sure if this is as good as a double pipe classic or even better. Please let me know your thoughts. Are you out of your Goddamn mind? No, it's not better. No, it doesn't count. I keep getting this fucking question. Hey, if I sneeze and far, is that a double pipe? It's not the same. You know, you just have a little extra turbo boost on your fart.

Speaker 4:          01:28:31       Yeah. You have that night trope and you just add a little extra juice to it. The rules of a double pipe are burping and farting. Same time they, it doesn't happen often. It's not going to happen to you every Wednesday. God, you just have to relish it when it does happen. Just stop. You sit down, you say a prayer, you thank y'all way for, of course it doesn't happen a lot. No last week you to shout out to the bear community and you requested some gay bears to clarify some shit, so here I am as a burly gay dude to set you to straight. Here's how it works within the gay community, especially when it comes to the sub genre of bears, a bear, simply an overweight guy that is covered in body here. It's literally that simple, Aka Tommie Hines or Chewbacca. With that said, there are sub classes within the gay community in regards to bear.

Speaker 4:          01:29:27       When I get interested in now this is what I'm talking about here and odder is a hair fit and slim guy and otter is not fat. No Dad Bod? No, nothing in auto is just simply a regular fit dude that just happens to be hearing my friend. John's definitely an honor. All generally otters are very fit and have a six pack or less and they do lots of labs and an Olympic size swimming pool. Okay, but that said you have the fake bears, Aka smooth skins. These are just fat guys that try to identify themselves as bears, but they are not bears because they're not what? Well what that said they are the chubs. It's just big bears are smooth skins. You have to be Harry in order to be there. That's what he's saying. If you're fat and hairless, you're just fat. Like Burt. His chest isn't very hairy.

Speaker 4:          01:30:24       They probably would be like, why is this guy so fat, fat Ed herring. Ah. These guys are just straight up heavy dudes. Like 500 pounds, 500 pound types of dudes. The type of guys where the smells come out of the roles of their fat. Yeah. They try to come within the bear community and then you have the muscle. There's these guys are straight up. Jack. I've seen these guys, it's like Mac as that. These are your typical muscle gym freaks and they have body hair. They don't have the typical beer belly or anything like that. What they are are just pure gym jocks and are jacked to the tits with whatever supplements they are using. Either way they are kind of fucking hot. Wow. So basically those are three typical sub genres of bears within the gay community. Cope. My experience with the Dick has helped you to and understanding the mystical bare sub genre, Keith and jeans high and tight cognac explaining to us we appreciate it.

Speaker 4:          01:31:20       That's really interesting. Yeah, that's a lot of sub genre. Mac SF will be considered a muscle there for sure. Yeah. I don't know what episodes those are awhile ago. I love Mac and then we had his partner at the time was listening to the show and he um, he's like, we'll answer your question. Also, his partner was I think an editor and it was like, hey thought you might enjoy this. A edit of some sort of Mac stuff. I just worked on it for Gore. Shit, it's hard. Is is real be spin. He's a real animal. Only one Mac, SF, Google, m a C K, s f or just download a hair suit. Pursuits of their albums, but don't look at work. All right. It's intense. Real intense. Um, I think that said jeans. Yup. You got anything else? No. Good. Tom Treats me like a frat brother. Oh, maybe that's on the next step is, excuse me. I'm I telling you that career ago. Fart. I got to shit. I'm like, am I a Frat Bro? I'm your wife. Then you got to say that we sit down for breakfast. We're eating breakfast. I'm sitting right next to you. Lift your leg up. Fart at me. You don't lift the other way. You lift towards me as I'm eating and you're like, hey, you're calling me the fucking Frat guy.

Speaker 4:          01:32:48       Unbelievable. Unbelievable. I love you though. I love you too. Um, okay, so we want to address this. This is a really a big deal. You know, in this episode we called the hotel in Cincinnati to get people the exact room number where the Cincinnati fart occurred. And there's, there was a little, you know, misunderstanding as far as a, what I heard and what was repeated back. And we're, we're not yet at the exact room number. We need to figure it out. Right. And I want to be, I'm going to come clean on little something. So when we went to Cincinnati for, it happened and we recorded that episode August, 2015 and we said, oh, it's room 1618 and I remember in my head going, wait, that's not the right room. That was I think your parents room now. Yeah. And I'm like, what? Because I know at the time I go, that's not right.

Speaker 4:          01:33:44       I said that in my head. So either at six 18 or eight oh eight or eight oh eight and we're not giving up. That's the thing. We just want people to know, like, we're gunna find out the correct room number. We're just, we're just not there yet. We don't want to mislead anyone. And we don't want you to think that we're just going to quit on the room. We don't want you to plan your summer vacations around this information. Look, it is the Renaissance Hotel in downtown Cincinnati and it is either eight oh eight or six 18 I'm almost inclined to believe, but not 1618 right? That one of the numbers, right? Because she said we listened back and she's clearly said six. I thought you said 16 I want to say it's eight oh eight because of the band eight Oh eight state. It's an industrial plant and I remember being like eight Oh eight state in my head at the time.

Speaker 4:          01:34:34       You know when you make dumb association, maybe you could check in and say, can I get two keys, one for eight oh run for six 18 and just walk around both for a moment and see if you smell anything or just stand there. Close your eyes. And if you feel a little extra movement, you're in the right room. You know, we're going to do a little more research and figure out the correct room. We'll make sure you guys do the right, go, go to the right room, the right things. Um, yeah. Yeah. This is a big deal. Yeah, this is a big deal. Well I know and we're commemorating it. It's very important stuff. Figure out the correct room by looking back at our flights and figuring out exactly who checked in first. You checked in first and I flew in as late as I could.

Speaker 4:          01:35:17       We went to the wedding and then I left the next day. And you stayed on a day after my, no, but I don't know that I checked into that hook. Did I check into that hotel first? You came from another room? He and I, we started fresh together in that room and the room stop. So I don't know if you were, if you were in a different hotel. I was. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Okay. I wasn't a different hotel. And you want, what day was the wedding? The wedding was on a Friday. I think we'll, all we have to do is look at the calendar and we can look at the calendar and figure it out. Yeah, because I came as late as possible. I came in the night before the wedding, I believe. No, no, no. I came for the dinner.

Speaker 9:          01:36:01       Yup.

Speaker 4:          01:36:03       Okay. Mystery. We're going to ask too. It's a bit of a mystery. Let's look right now. August it was what day? Saturday of August. 22nd of 2015 is a Saturday. Okay. Yeah. Look here. Flight. I flew from CVG to lax on the 22nd on Saturday, on Saturday from CVG, so I flew in from lax to CBG on the 19th so I checked into the hotel on the 19th you wouldn't have checked it on the 19th let the record show unless this is your flight. Why would I have that in my phone? That let's me confirmation crowed. Look, it's all here. Christina flew in was the, oh, that makes sense. Cause the rehearsals Thursday, the wedding's Friday, Saturday, which means it was the first room number she gave us the 19 which I think was eight oh eight state guys. The Cincinnati fart happened in a, it's eight oh eight and I know I make a correction to the episode. It's a very nice title. It correctly because I know the day we recorded it on the show, we set it wrong. And in my head I went, should I say the right number? And I was like, who cares? You know, under the episode title, this

Speaker 9:          01:37:16       Cincinnati Farts. Right?

Speaker 4:          01:37:21       Can we tag this audio onto the episode? Maybe eight oh eight this is important. This is really, really vital information. Um, Gosh, I'm really happy we were able to resolve this. If you want, you could address the fact that there's a diaper in front of you on the table. I don't know if went that'd people, what's going on there? This is a dog diaper. I got an Amazon using our banner. Your mom's house. podcast.com. Deter the dog from urinating on our staircase cause there's, it's carpeted for people that are curious too. She doesn't pee in it. No, she just doesn't until she goes outside. And where are we taking off? Right? It's part of potty training and yes, when she's house broken for the most part, she's just young. Yeah, she's stupid. Sit on. Or are you guys Cincinnati fart roommate. Oh wait, it's eight oh eight eight oh eight.

Speaker 4:          01:38:08       It's eight oh eight. All right. We should get out of here. This, oh, this says, what is this gaping dad. Yeah. Is that good? Yeah. Yeah, it's good. It's really good guys. You really going to love it. Okay. I don't know why this is a, having a lot of, uh, Internet problems at the house. Last couple of bad problems is really cool cause dad doesn't know how to do things. I don't know why I'm dad's never know how to use technology. That's, thanks dad. Was that a lot? So, all right. I gotta go. This is a bye. Bye. Gaping Dad. It's called vocal fry jam. Oh good.

Speaker 1:          01:38:50       Okay. Bye guys.
