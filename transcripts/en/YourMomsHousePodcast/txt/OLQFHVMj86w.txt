Speaker 4:          00:05:38       Focus. Christina, you wrote this. You're writing, what's the last word? I can't read that as you're writing kiss. Let me see. Did you write me that rescue something and then that's your writing, isn't it? Yeah, that is. We like to a little focus, Christina. Focus. Focus. Yeah. You know what? I like a little known Mott. We'll let you in on a very intimate mommy's secret is that Tom and I, since we first started seeing each other, we always have these comedy notebooks. You always see me scribbling. Yeah. And we would go into the deep pages and write each other, messed up masters or draw pictures of dicks and balls. Um, our favorite thing to do on airplanes, those magazines, memories to draw dicks like on every page of the, the skymall catalog.

Speaker 1:          00:06:18       Yeah. And then put it back. It's great. You know, that's a gift to somebody who's sitting there

Speaker 4:          00:06:26       came all magazine. Defacement is probably one of my favorite things we've done in the area. I forgot. We, we should do that again. That's another thing you can do to spice things up.

Speaker 1:          00:06:35       Um, how are you doing? How you feeling right now?

Speaker 4:          00:06:38       Oh, it's hired. We had a crazy weekend. Our both our kids are sick. Everybody's getting sick. You're getting sick. The baby had a fever yesterday, so I had to run them to the doctor. And you know what they always say when you bring your kid in.

Speaker 1:          00:06:50       Yeah. It's a virus. We find the worst part of that fleet, honestly, getting sick during this God damn challenge. Oh right. And you know, your body just wants to rest and I'm falling behind. So the current standings right now, right. And sober fart Tobar Sober October and the bane of my existence, then there's not that much time left. There's about a week left. Yeah. And it, it had been pretty close for a while and then Joe went nuts a few days. You knew it was coming. He's pulled far in a way ahead of us. Um, so really it's a competition now between Bert Ari and I wish we kind of always knew it would be. Yeah, it's been neck and neck, but like yesterday I just couldn't do anything excessive. You know, my body was just like, you need to round. Yeah. But then you're like, fuck, like you have to get something even on the low.

Speaker 1:          00:07:46       The whole thing is, I've always gotten points every day because if you let a day go by, it's just, you're, you're in too deep of a hole. So even if you walk around and get some points, you know, going on a long walk, can you wear this telemetry strap just all day? Good. Can we put it on one of the dogs and the dog ran in the backyard? I don't think it will register the dog, but like so, but it's just one of those things where like, dude, our kid runs all day and put it on him. I wish it burns calories so it'd be like you really very active. Oh, crazy. Yeah, but like I just fucking, I did great the day before. I've been, I've been doing it all month, but then feeling like this doesn't make you want to run when you're sick. You don't want to live. You don't want to do shit science, so it sucks your will to live. I know y'all are. Hopefully it'll be better soon. He's got to take drugs. I don't know what drugs to take. Dayquil all right. Maybe I'll take some dayquil. Get yourself jacked. You'll jack me up, Jack you off. Okay. Speaking of that opening clip, doesn't that feel like your first six years in standup? Like every open mic? Oh, I thought meant like, doesn't this feel

Speaker 4:          00:08:55       like retro? Your mind does. That's what it feels like for me. Like I got such a big smile when I saw this. I was like, this is what this show's all about. I did an interview with Larry King, that's right, yesterday, yesterday, and it'll be out in a few weeks, a week. The movie comes out and he was like, who would you love to have on your mom's house? And I was like, um, I don't know man. Because I was like, I dunno. I started talking about it. I go, we like trash TV like Bravo. And he was like, what? But I really wanted to say I should have said like a CAS ripper. That's exactly why I was thinking. Yeah I didn't, he did say he was like, he was like, so what do you like on your show? I was like, you know, we like to play like viral interact clips of like, like a guy who's like really high on meth and he just wants to invite strangers who have sex with him. And he was like reflects. I think that's the challenge of writing this CBS pilot that we're doing right now.

Speaker 4:          00:09:54       Like how's the pilot? And I'm like, you know what? We're really trying to keep it real. Your mom's house is, I mean within the confines of a network show, the spirit being the same. We can't have a guy being like I came in for strokes so much thick cap com couldn't believe up big his dick was, but I was going to say that guy cause I went to do a show at Bar Lubitsch and I was watching like younger male comics and the first six years it's just masturbation. Like all they talk about is jerky and headaches, which is fine. I'm not just saying it's just, it reminded me of like, Oh yeah, this is, oh this guy's got some other materials. If you want to see some of his stuff here, let's go and do it again. Piss rattlesnake. Yeah, this is Matt Kras. Remember this guy?

Speaker 4:          00:10:43       I spit rattlesnakes. This is Dan and this is an open mind. I sleep out under a no, it is kind of like a bowling alley. Canoga bowl. Sunday night, fuck under covered darkness. Black women only cause the Sun Keynes file. They like animals, beasts, raccoons, foxes in sheets. God, I love this shit. Wow. Dangers. You know, maybe I do like spoken word is pretty good stuff. If it were like this, yeah I'd watch this all day. Why are we so attracted to this? Lights me up inside. This guy is a hero. I like poopy. You say poopy and my face lights up and crazy people like I had. I love Gigi. Allen is fucking guy. Steve Lives is smooth and pink times sweet. I loved tastes that Pussy Pussy. Me Nick. Oh Pussy is Reimann quite a bit. It's good. It's not bad. Drink the pussy meat or eat to put and then drink the nectar that it secretes. We need, this is off the top of the dome. Pretty good. Pretty good. Somebody needs to lay a beat under this. Uh Oh. I'm sure they will. I'm sure they will.

Speaker 5:          00:12:01       I like how we take black dandelion wine. Is that right? All right. Sassafras water, orange mass spine. The color of a mud puddle, which shoots at the water line. Hey now lack to lick the pedals of iron roofs and then class and Brian. Hm.

Speaker 4:          00:12:21       I mean this stream of consciousness is pretty aggressive. It's actually really good. It sounds like he wants to get mudded. It sounds like he may be under the influence of something. No, but that's the whole thing is this drugs or mental illness is an interesting segment. Yeah. We need a awesome intro. Music for a mental illness or, or drugs. Drugs are metal. Yeah. I'm going to go, uh, the intensity of the eyes, the cadence. I'm going to go mental illness. Uh, maybe schizophrenia, the stream of consciousness here. Uh, cause math guy tried out that guy's math, right? We learned that. Yeah. Uh, that's more aggressive and a lot of shoulder asks. He, this guy could be mushrooms, acid, this, you know, maybe could be, I'm feeling his intense eye contact. That's mental illness to me right now. Weird. Crazy. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:13:15       The boat for my lover. Guilt or in a minute with golden silver. Starla yeah. On an Egf. Shinra I want fashioned a boat for my lover.

Speaker 4:          00:13:30       I just also feel like, you know, it's not high production. Yeah. But the fact that he knows to have a microphone and a light and a camera on, Whoa, wait a minute. It's pretty good. I mean, this is not your typical, your mom's house. Wait a minute. It's kind of frame semi correctly. I like the lighting. The lighting is, it's deliberate. It's not right, but it's, it's a choice. And I, but the biggest thing, the biggest credit we have to give them is audio. Wow. You're right. And I like his Iggy pop thing. He's kind of shirtless with the long weird hair. Uh, you're right. This is kind of a revelation that guy. See now I'm going on for drugs because mental illness wouldn't have the wherewithal, right. It could be drugs. Yeah. Drugs. You have the focus. Let us know sir. Which is, which is it

Speaker 5:          00:14:24       Mary? She who wants to leave forever with me under the leaves twinkling in dark forest. [inaudible] blind in gripping tightly in the hand each and Desti rough chunk a time.

Speaker 4:          00:14:42       I tell Ya. Asheville, North Carolina, they've got a lot of talented people. So yeah, that guy's pretty exact guy from North Carolina. I have no idea.

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       But that's what I saw. Can he open for you? Yeah, he could open for me. What have you brought to this guy? That's my new contest. How insane can I make my openers? B, that would be so fun. This guy's are opening your audience. So if they knew what was going on, it would be really fun. You know, if they knew we were like, it's going to be crazy at my shows, I'm going to pay out an absolute best person. We could do like a gong show of crazy people in the eye. But if you just, if you just surprise them, whether it'd be a lot of disappointment, you know? Yeah. They got to be in on it. You gotta be well cause this truly for more than 30 seconds, you can't really sit through this. It's pretty painful. Yeah. This is like open mic.

Speaker 1:          00:15:34       This is what you sit through for six years. Yeah. If that bitch own lane knew she was get in Madrid. Oh Damn. Crew. Hey, hey, hey. Um, I'm just making sure our guest is on time there. She's going to be a little bit late. She says, okay, if that bitch on Lynn. No. See he was Dupan we've been saying fuck the points lately. Meaning well yeah, last night a little grilled cheese we had in and out yesterday. You got to do it though. If I had a sick day. You just want to eat and you don't feel full ever on sick days when you have a cold. I know. It's so weird. Like a bottomless pit. I don't understand. I guess because your body's burning so much just to fight the elements that what it is. It's my theory. I was thinking about how disloyal you are and somebody sent in this clip. This is from a show in Australia where they test a guy's wife to see if she's f Gtr, TD. They test the wife. Oh yeah, we should test the guy. No, no. See what happened. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:16:46       What's the number one element to a successful marriage? That's what you guys have to yell at trust. What is trust? Trust to say, Hey, might to detectives over there. They're going to be working for me today. I'm about to make a call to my wife. It's going to scare the bejesus out of her and let's see if she's going to trust her. How's it going when the detectives knock on the door? Let's see how she goes.

Speaker 1:          00:17:07       So this dude who obviously has it, has, um, has set up his wife. So here's what he's doing. Okay. He calls her in a panic and basically tells his wife that detectives are about to arrive at the house about a date, a certain date, and he's like, lie to them and say, I was home that day and that's it. And then he just like, he's like, I got and then they knock on the doors and there's hidden cameras, but he really fucking throws her. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:17:37       Honey, listen to me. You are about to get a knock on the door by a policeman now babe.

Speaker 4:          00:18:46       She says, I can't remember. So she, they asked her specifically that?

Speaker 4:          00:19:06       I mean, she's not telling them what he said to tell him. Right. So, but what are, you know what she's doing? She's, she's kind of hedging our bets. Yeah. She's like, I don't know what he did. I'm not going to totally cover for him. I'm just going to plead the fifth kind of, this is fair. Like I'm going to be, she's going want, well, how would you ever be okay if someone goes, Tom, where was Christina? February 5th he fucking recollection. So that's a good answer. Me and said, I know when they say that, then I would've been like, oh, what date? February 2nd. Oh yeah, no, no. She was here for sure. Yeah. We, uh, we went out to dinner at the, um, oh, I forget what's the origin time play? I would make that up because you just called me. Well, let me tell you what she's doing wrong here.

Speaker 4:          00:19:48       First of all, when you're lying to the authorities, you have to act surprised when they get to the door. She's not a very good actor. Yeah. No, I know. You need to be like, wow, she's really truthful. Yeah. She's a good person. Yeah. That's why. That's why it's on a piece of shit like us. Right. She needs to go, oh my goodness. La, you guys are here. The law enforcement here and then, I don't know. Let me check in my calendar. February what day? Second. Oh, um, let me see. Yeah, no, we had a babysitter that night. We went out to a steak dinner on a date night. You already, yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:20:23       We'll come back and say you, man, that's the best process moving forward. Thank you.

Speaker 4:          00:20:28       Right, man.

Speaker 3:          00:20:46       Sorry. It was, it was trust exercise to see if you're trusting God in life where they go, I'm the better one here. That's what you're supposed to trust me. Come and meet the detectives.

Speaker 4:          00:21:05       She's just like you. She's a liar. She's a, she's a disloyal. Yeah. Have gt I, she's not an Ftt Rda. Yeah. I Dunno if FTT RTD can be, she's not a girl that rides till death appropriate here. Yeah. Okay. That's for girls that ride till death and we have it in the store by the way. And I really hope that the only people wearing them real little checks, like I'm extremely loyal. I, okay, here's the deal. If you gave me that call and I didn't know what you'd done at that point, I would lie for you to the police. Thank you. So let's just say I'm ride or die on ignorance and I complete ignorance later and be like, oh, in my calendar was wrong. I thought you meant w o February six Oh, I'm sorry. I fucked up. I had it in here differently. I thought you, I thought you meant June.

Speaker 4:          00:21:52       Yeah. Huh. I, I then I take it back once I found out that you killed the Starbucks Barista. Yeah. By the way, uh, I had, uh, a fan of the show asked me if you've seen forensic files. Yeah, of course. And they're like, yeah, but they always get caught on that show. So the show only profiles the losers. The losers who get caught is what you're saying? Yes. All those fucking dummies. FTT RTDs again, somebody with curly hair like they're not supposed to like, like Philippe told us too. So how do you think you can get away with it? How do you get away with it? Not going to give away all my secrets on this show. You have to burn the body with acid. Right. It's a good way to do it. I mean, I heard, let me know. Okay. Um, here's an email that bitch, okay, go ahead.

Speaker 1:          00:22:43       Hey, Mommy's, I'm a new listener. Enjoy the show. Really recently in a meeting at work, one of the dads on my team, I mentioned courtesy, flushing it. Oh, he believes we don't do this enough. Now, the courtesy flush isn't something new to me, but I almost never do it since that meeting. I've been thinking about them nonstop. Do you do them and do they work? I would imagine they only work in a shit iceberg situation where the log or sludge pile sticks out of the water. If the shit is underwater, how could it continue to give off that stash? Personally, I believe the need to courtesy flush is rather where thoughts t money. Uh, sorry. T I'm going to have to disagree with you there. I think courtesy flushes are definitely a way to go.

Speaker 4:          00:23:26       You do that here? Oh yeah, you do that for me. Oh yeah, you do. I hear you flushing multiple times and I think in public settings it's definitely a thing to do. It's just blew my mind. You realized for 14 years. I thought that you were flushing so frequently because there was so much brown coming out. No. Oh, you're a courtesy. Courtesy. Yeah, that's babe. You realize, you know that joke you have. Yeah. We're like, will you come out and you and I go, do we need to go to the hospital? Yeah, that was just because I'm like, why is it fucking flushing so much? It must be so much Kaka that comes out. Well there is a lot of cockup but my thing is that especially, you know that first, the first release is usually the biggest release, right? Not In my case, my second, but when that comes out you have fresh Kaka that just came out of you.

Speaker 4:          00:24:12       I hit flush immediately. Ah, it sucks. All the cook it down. Yeah, so the smell is going to be less than it would be if it just sat there like soup and like when you're cooking a soup and it goes, the smell goes through the house. If it sits in the toilet longer, it's going to smell own drum for sure. No question about it. Here's smells sour. Your puppies. All I smell sound. No. Sometimes they smell sweet, but that's diabetes. Have you ever smelled me? Courtesy, flush. Never know. Tea, smell my browns. No, that's a lie. No, I don't even never smelled my brown. I haven't. We've shared a bathroom before. I mean he's still may be some little after remnant, but no, nothing's wrong. I always know when you've just gone because you leave behind the reminder toilet paper. It's one square and there's like a dab of Brown on it.

Speaker 4:          00:25:01       It's like oh that's his last wife and let you know that I did it. Yeah. How come you leave that there? I wanted you to know that I did it. Why don't you wash it down? I don't want you to be proud of me. I always fleshed that for you so that no one else sees it in the house. Some parasailing, I'd do it for you. You can just tell you my skills. Look when you read this one, marriage advice needed. Dear Mommy's Dyrus. No wire hangers. I know that reference. I am so blessed to be married for 15 years to some random girl I knocked up. It has been a great 15 years. But I've been worried the whole time because my wife has never given any evidence that she shits. No smells after she goes no splashes on the bull note. Nothing I'm worried cause either a, she does shit, in which case I'm married to some sort of Austin Powers sex bot that does laundry or be even after 15 years she is still not comfortable to shit around me.

Speaker 4:          00:26:01       How can I help her feel comfortable to visit Brown town when she wants? We've been together a good while, but even during labor with both our kids, she didn't shit the table, which I was looking forward to almost as much as meeting my new kiddos. You've both given great advice and would love to hear your perspectives. Please email me back with whatever you have. Thank you so much for your time and entertainment and advice. Genes update from that. Yeah, I would say at first say to David, just say thank you. Yeah. I mean you don't need her to want to shit in front of you. That's the last line. So, so she's keeping, but he's kind of worried because there's not even evidence. Listen, she's shitting, but she's doing it in secret and that's what bothers him is that she's the need to hide. Yeah. But think of it as it's something

Speaker 1:          00:26:46       she's still trying to maintain some level of sexiness for him. That's why I would think of it. Ah, you know what I mean? She's still trying to be like, you know, we've had kids, you've seen my pussy blown out. My God, we've seen each other and probably our worst and we've been sick around each other. But I'm just still trying to make you not think of me as a pooper. Yeah, that's just a nice thing. She's just trying to be, keep it nice

Speaker 4:          00:27:10       guess. But I feel like that's there. There's that level. Like I closed the door cause I don't want you to see me. Boop. I don't want you to see me poop either. But I don't, I don't go out of my way to hide it. I know and I feel like that's what he's like, well why doesn't she trust me? And that's the level she's at. She wants it to be like that. I worry for her. Only that she might have shame surrounding the brown and I feel like it's not good to have shame around Brown. That's true. Or sex or anything. Yeah, I worry for her levels of shame.

Speaker 1:          00:27:41       I mean, the only thing I could tell you, if, if, if you're really concerned about that, as you could tell her, be like, hey, you know, you know I take big, big dumps. Sure. I know you do too. Yeah. And I don't feel like you should be a take big dumps. Yeah. I don't think you should be ashamed of it. You don't have to run to a different side of the house to poop. I don't mind you pooping. It doesn't bother me at all. Did she fart in front of you? Probably not from the family. Not just tell her you like her farts. Tell her you want to know what they smell like.

Speaker 4:          00:28:13       Yeah. Just ask her acts, act Axar acts or that and see what happens. Okay. You Know Jean? Yes. As you mentioned, we've been watching so many bravo shows. Oh my God, I, it's, but you know, we go through phases of stuff, like we get into scripted shows and we always, we always go back on that and to this episode, by the way. No, but I, I don't know. We'll see. But, um, I thought we should discuss the episode we watched with Hannah and Conrad [inaudible]. Uh, so this is below deck med. There's two. There's below deck and below deck med. Yes. And so Hannah's the chiefs to Stuart s and she's banging the Boson who's like 23 years old. She's 30. She's 30 yet and so years. Yeah. I said, but, and I only just seven years. It's like those are the quantum leap years. Like your early twenties or so different from your thirties. That's true. I'm just establishing yourself. You're still not really an adult. Yeah, I dunno. What do you, we've been kind of going back and forth on the Soak Conrad in this check or banging then dating for what, a couple weeks?

Speaker 1:          00:29:17       Yeah, on a boat. You know, they're living in this kind of isolated world, right. Cause you're right. Floating around, just working together with the personalities that you work with and guests. So it's kind of like study abroad. You're like, I think the love happens.

Speaker 4:          00:29:34       Yeah. And it's in this isolated world, basically. Everything's kind of heightened and stuff. Yeah. So, um, I guess he bought her a carton of cigarettes when they were in port and at the end of a night of drinking or whatever, or you're about to go out. Oh, they're about to go out, like getting ready, right.

Speaker 1:          00:29:51       Yeah. The, when he bought it, but then they're getting ready to go out on a, on a night out on, all right. So she's getting ready and it's kind of quick and, and he's like, they have their cabins. Next week, the crew does all down stairs on the boat and he leans over and he's like, oh, hey, don't forget you owe me 50 bucks for a, yeah. You want me to follow for that? Right. He says it real casually. Like, Hey, heads up. Do you want me to that 50 bucks? Yeah. And, um, she immediately was like, okay, uh, hold on, let me get that for it. He's like, no, no, I'm not like right now. I'm just saying like, it just, yeah, I just remembered that. So I'm telling you, she's like, no, no, no, no. And you could tell that she's kind of rolls her eyes.

Speaker 1:          00:30:36       She's not into it. And she goes into her wallet, she gets to 50. She goes, here you go. He's like, I didn't mean like right now. And then you kind of think that, I don't know, is this, how serious is this exchange right now? Then they get into a van and they drive off and you can tell it's really eating at her. So she starts to be like, oh, uh, you got your 50 back, right? Like you all settled now. And he's like, I wasn't making a big deal about it. Then she starts to do kind of juvenile stuff cause she starts to bring it up. Um, like gifts that she's been

Speaker 4:          00:31:13       well, and then she's like, I had a BMW when I was 16 my grandma gave it to me and whatever it is, my favorite car, Hannah Fry, she sat, they frickin this shit. I don't, I can't remember. They all sound Australian. Cool. She's just really better accents and hours. And then they Americans go on the boat and I, we don't want no vegetables, no fruit. Uh, you gotta have a lot of ranch dressing, otherwise I don't hate it. I won't check strips ranch. So anyways, so she gets really bent out of shape about this $50

Speaker 1:          00:31:45       Yo and then it really escalates. Then she pulls him aside and she goes, I don't know if I'm like the right girl for you. And he takes that as you have to be someone that would spend money, but she's saying, this is what I interpreted it. He takes offense to it, like extreme offense to it that, that maybe she's looking for a guy with a lot of money to buy her things. Right. And then her defense of that is like, no, I'm just saying that if your making sure you get your 50 back as a priority, that's not really, it does get complicated because it actually, there's a lot of nuance to the conversation and she's like, no, I'm just saying like a 50 if you've got to get your 50 like you're not willing to, you know, buy me something for 50 bucks without running to get it back. I might not be like that to me is not a relationship. And then he keeps going,

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       look I am [inaudible] I am of the belief that everything is 50 50 like down the middle. And of course they were like yeah this is also where the age comes into it because then he's saying or the reality is that he's 23 he doesn't have a lot of money so is it, you almost kind of go like, well the east should have been a little more understanding of the other. She should have been more cognizant of the fact that when you're 23 years old, $50 can make or break you. And so like when a guy buys you something that expensive and you're in a position that you're a little older and when you've been earning learning, yeah. Like you should kind of volunteer to pay him back and they've only been dating for two weeks now. This conversation is really not about money when you think about it, right?

Speaker 4:          00:33:25       It's like a, it's an exchange. It's like, er, from a woman's perspective it's like ill, right? I'm giving you my heart, my poon, my tits and all that stuff. And you're doing like tit for tat. Like it's kind of gross. It is kinda gross. Not realize though that money and how you view it and how you spend it and your whole view on it has so much to do with your upbringing thousand times hardwired into you a thousand times. I would ask for the 50 back from my friend, but not the chicken, the chick, that girlfriend. I know for sure. But then see what the thing is too. Like when you're first dating and when I dated people and even when we were first dating in our twenties like we both were broke. So I was like, I would pay for something and then you would pay for something that's true, but kind of by covered you on something.

Speaker 4:          00:34:17       I would not bring it back up. Oh, okay. Remember when I bought that thing? You've got to give me that back. I'd be like, uh, cause to me that says like that's your friend. Yeah, that's, but that's my, I'm aware enough to know that that's how my mind operates. Yeah. And I also am aware enough to know that I wouldn't want a girl to think that 50 meant that much to me. Even if it did, I would rather just eat that because I wouldn't want her to think like is 50 fucking really affect you? Even if it did, I would still be like, no, it's fine. It's cool. Yeah. Yeah, that's, that's true. But I mean again that's, that's looking back on God who I was and how I was raised and well that's how I was trying to pay for dates. But you were chivalrous and like, but I think also the reason you and I worked so well is that you always offering to pay back in the day when you didn't have it.

Speaker 4:          00:35:14       And I wasn't the kind of girl that would take advantage of that. Very nice. I looked out and he also did not have expensive tastes. You were not, it was like you've gotta be fancier. In fact, I our first date, remember you, I was like, let's go to this bar and Pasadena that you can still smoke at. Yeah. That was my big night out you. That's true. Uh, but you're about that family stuff man. About money. Yeah. Like my parents, I had to really unlearn a lot of poverty thinking and a lot of scarcity thinking and like, it's like in your DNA, it's horrible and it's, and it actually makes you more anxious and it makes you reject. It actually prevents you from earning more money. Makes you kind of understand. It's crazy. Yeah. Cause he talks about it. He comes from a family where the dad had, what was it he was, he's found out that he didn't see his dad for a long time.

Speaker 4:          00:36:07       And then when his dad did visit, it was like his dad visited him to verify something so that he didn't, he had to make sure he didn't have to pay any more child support. And then he, oh, cool. Views with money. Yeah. Negative. That's very negative. And he views, um, anybody who wants even like you to give them a dollar as somebody who's trying to take something from somebody with ulterior motives, you know? Interesting. So in a child's mind, he could have been like, Oh, the reason my dad isn't around us because of money. I don't know what that even like people listening right now all have different relationships with money. Oh my God. Some people, it's natural. So people would naturally side with the, with Conrad, the boy, and some would be like, what? Just fucking, cause she's not that. Whether they make her out to be materialistic, Hannah on this episode, like, Oh, she's materialistic.

Speaker 4:          00:36:58       She's just this bet shoe. Where is he sound? Lauren. It's like, well, no, she actually worked really hard to buy those things that she enjoys wearing. He and of course gives a shit, but I want to throw out there, cause I, I struggled with money for many years. Not, I mean, I think philosophically and the poverty mentality and like, I don't deserve nice things or, um, because money's not, it's an exchange. It's not about, anyways, there's this great lady named Louise Hay. She's dead now. She just died. Louise l hey, and she gave, there's a talk about money. Uh, it's, you can download it on iTunes. I recommend listening to that. That really changed my perspective on, on money and deserving more in life in general. Right. Um, you get stuck in a fucking poor mentality, dude. That's a fucker. Did you know, by the way, did you know that Rosie O'donnell played a special person in a movie? No. Stop. I swear to you. How did I miss this? It was just sent to us.

Speaker 9:          00:37:59       Jojo is beautiful and successful. Beth has a stall or they have nothing in common. She's retarded now. They're going to be more than family. They're going to be a film by Angelica Houston

Speaker 4:          00:38:22       and was that famous actress. She's with two Andie Mcdowell.

Speaker 9:          00:38:25       Rosie O'donnell, Andie MacDowell hiding the bus with my sister Tuesday at one watch

Speaker 4:          00:38:34       this whole film. Do like a streaming Rosie. Can we watch this full movie and do an episode where we watch it? We got to get ahold of riding the bus with my sister only on BBC fall. She's retired.

Speaker 9:          00:38:53       Oh,

Speaker 4:          00:38:55       can I watch that again? You want to see that again?

Speaker 9:          00:38:58       Is Beautiful and successful. She's retarded. He's done. This is unreal.

Speaker 4:          00:39:19       Gelica Houston did this film. Famous lady too. So can you imagine Rosie O'Donnell like practicing being retarded. Oh wait, wait. How do I run like is her run is a little ridiculous. Yeah, it was. It was kind of silly.

Speaker 9:          00:39:40       Rosie O'donnell, Andy Mcdowell, you

Speaker 4:          00:39:44       get into that mental place that that's what I'm saying to, to play one of these roles. That's what I'm saying. Cause it's like you're, you want to portray it sympathetically and accurately. Yeah. But it's also kind of funny kind of. I like how she has a stack or cookie. She's like, this is what we're talking to people do. Right. They get a whole stack. L'Oreal, I dunno. It's really something. What year was this? How did I miss this? I was in five. No. Yeah, that's an old, I mean, you know, relatively, and this one kind of flew under the radar a little bit. A little bit. We should hide it and this reminds me, 62 up is coming out in 2019 the up series. We've got to go see that. They usually play it at a small theater here in la. If you're in, if you're in the UK, you probably know about the seven up series.

Speaker 4:          00:40:37       It started in the 60s where they follow a group of English kids from the time they're seven years old and every seven years they revisit them to see the premise of Erasmus. You give me the the child from the age of seven I'll show you the man to fall percent. So fascinating to see if you can transcend your socioeconomic, if you really want to binge on levels. Yeah, it's great. Binge on something cool. Watch the seven up series. Yeah, it's called the number seven, you p series seven up every meeting, every seven years. You have revisited the same kids every seven years. And it is the fascinating thing is because the premise of the, of the whole series that goes, show me, uh, I know, I know, but she'll make it at seven and I'll show you the man. So when you see a kid until he's seven, and I'll show you the man, how you raised them, how many of these kids that you see on that first one, and it's black and white, you know, it's, it's whatever shifts or six days ago.

Speaker 4:          00:41:32       Um, and you see the kid who's like, oh, I'm going to go to Cambridge, I'm reading maths at Cambridge. And that kid grows up and he goes to Cambridge and he becomes a lawyer. And then you see like the kid who's a on the monkey bars, what, why his teeth is hanging off. And then he's, uh, he's running around pulling his pants up because they keep falling down. He hasn't bought a belt. And he's like, yeah, they really, they show you the full run of it. It's fascinating. It's really fascinating, especially in the UK. What's interesting is this idea that you can kind of transcend your, your socioeconomic status. I think back, you know the idea like if you're born in a certain class, are you going to be able to get out of it and the rich get richer? Yup. It's pretty exciting. Pretty.

Speaker 4:          00:42:18       Is it 62 of no, is it 69 now at 62 right, because the next one, don't forget to read that. Here we go. Stop love shaming. Giulia to tad and crispy. I seek your attention based on the recent broadcasting. Have a video made by a man. You know what does that go away? I don't know that the two of you and flipper, Sparta openly love shamed. I don't know what that means. Giulia. Oh, for first four hosts our guests, Felipe Esparza. Giulia sharing this video is essentially revenge porn and today's climate. Simply greeting a woman politely is grounds for an indecency accusation and a guilty verdict and the court of public opinion. Granted, the gentleman who sent the video would be able to Texas Julia aged daughter with the same efficiency. If I cut off nine of his fingers, IVL vehemently reiterate that he is stepping into the unknown in order to utilize his iPhone technology and the name of love. I formally request you cease love shaming a man who took a huge leap in the name of his world, Juliet. She deserves to feel like a real woman. She's gorgeous. She's precious. Let's go full throttle forever. Not Too dumb to come, Patrick. Wow. Lesson it. Don't fucking blame this me too. Stuff on Julia. Julia, don't blame the me too movement on not being able to hit. All of you guys know the fucking difference. Come on.

Speaker 4:          00:43:48       He's something that could you imagine waking up next to that every day. I'll go morning talk. Let's go full throttle. Go full throttle. I love you so much. Oh my God. The level of no one would ever love you the way that I do so fucking weird. Let's go full throttle. Full throttle, full throttle. God, that guy's really scary. It's so scary. He's a really terrifying man. Yeah. I mean before social media you would just get creepy letters from guys. I once had a guy in high school notes on my windshields

Speaker 1:          00:44:33       experienced me. You won't even know who your ex boyfriend is. Yeah. Like I would follow me to Taco Bell with my friends after school. I had that feel terrible. What age? This is high school. Like senior year. He would just follow you. He didn't go to him. I went to an all girls high school and this guy would somehow like break into campus, put a note on my car, follow Shauna and me to talk about and like show up there, show up at my house. Like really? Really Cray cray. It's really crazy to Julia Google. Oh Man, I will love you. Like you've never been loved before. That's insane to say to somebody the day after you met them. Yeah. That's the part where you go like, cause there can be parts of this that are charming, you know, could be. Yeah. And then you go somewhere there and you're like, no, we'll travel. Eh? Yeah. He's a little obsessive, but it's been sitting in my mind when you said to me, you want to go back with your ex boyfriend? Boy, he's too old for this type of behavior too. Of course he is. Yeah, of course. He's old. He's like, what? 30 something at least at least. Maybe there's forties. Let's go full throttle and let's go full throttle.

Speaker 1:          00:45:48       That's cool. Full throttle. So we get a cool guys. Uh, my man, Gee, I a new social media posts. I saw it the other day and I immediately vomited into my mouth. Um, there couldn't be anyone weirder. He's the coolest poster on social media. He is the weirdest guy. Weird. He has no cool. How does he have like no cool to be that big of a star? Yeah, he's zero. Cool. I don't know if people understand too. I think people are like, oh yeah, he's popular amongst, um, you know, country music. Do you know something? Did you know that the number one act in the world above, beyond say Bruno Mars? All of them. Everyone. Are you fucking serious? Yup. Yup. And uh, and what he's about to do, what he's about to embark on when he's announcing here will be the biggest tour of all time, man. It's our agent's Rep. This guy. Yes, go flow and telling you. I love it all about it, but it does let him be Julia Beard. It was weird. Or Julia or this guy, right? This guy, the full trial guys guys. This guy of all time. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:47:04       Everybody. Garth here in Nashville, Tennessee. Right here in the place where we've got inducted into the hall of fame. Great Room right here and the country music hall of fame. God else, the world tour today, the stadium tour. This is going to be fun. I want to call it the big ass stadium tour. It's just stadium tour above is all the information on it. But what we talked about today is we're going to introduce five cities before Christmas to go on sale because on insights to you, gee, you guys asked for a longer planning date. So can plan to be at as many of these as you can. Here it comes, the first two cities, St Louis where we're kicking it off of man. You talk about a love fest. Last time we were there, Phoenix specifically doing Dale Arizona, uh, where the cardinals play there at State Farm, uh, stadium as well. So those are the first two. The other three will be announced here shortly. And again, they'll all be on sale before Christmas. And remember, this is all about game day. Every show is going to be game day or Garth Day. However you want to look at it. Come dressed in your full color, support your team. Let's go have some fun and let's get physical playing music. I like that thought,

Speaker 4:          00:48:05       Huh? What the fuck is wrong with you man? What is wrong with you? Can I tell you what's really, he doesn't know how to connect no beings, which is odd that yourself such a huge music star, right? That's the, see, this is the conundrum is he's trying to be this friendly social media guy and he's not this guy. Let's get physical playing music. I don't understand. So Game Day, he means that. So he's doing a stadium tour, right? So all these shows will be weird. Normally football teams. Ah, he's like, it's game day where your team's favorite colors show up at the Glendale game wearing Arizona cardinals gear. And then because it's game day, let's get physical playing music. I like that, but I'm, I'm not so taken. Yeah,

Speaker 10:         00:48:55       let's go have some fun and let's get physical playing music. I like that thought. Oh my God.

Speaker 4:          00:49:00       And then the crazy chimp smile. Oh Man, I think I'm okay.

Speaker 3:          00:49:05       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:49:05       it's that he, he must not like this process. So much of like talking to the camera and trying to be relatable. Yeah, it's true. Because you know what happened? Oh, he probably or definitely got in late on social media because we remember when he was introduced to it and the weirdest things like, hey guys, I'm on, I'm on my space now.

Speaker 10:         00:49:23       Well, I guess it's official. We're now on Facebook. I really wasn't sure about this to start, but then a friend of mine said something that just made all kinds of sense. She said think of it more as a conversation. I like that.

Speaker 4:          00:49:36       I mean, that's like the weirdest thing that anyone's ever said. I know. So I think what happens is this is a guy that comes from the age of like, just do your act to do radio interviews, maybe, you know, do that kind of thing. So all this stuff is so foreign to him that he's never adapted. Like how to be natural doing it. Well, and also, and I'll tell you an also, he might be a monster in real life. No, I do. I do. So he, this is him like pretending to be, I think he's a monster. Okay. When somebody really smiles, you see his smile. Yeah. The eyes don't match the smile when, when you really smile, look, and it's genuine that you get wrinkles in your eyes and the eyes kind of narrow. Right. So his eyes are just normal, wide open and then like this, yeah, that's a sociopath.

Speaker 4:          00:50:25       Like a chimp smile that his, his face doesn't light up to match it. Yeah. I think there's that. I think that he's so forcing, he's forcing this relate-ability and it's not relatable. Now he's forcing, I think he's a monster. I think he is. He's so afraid that people are going to see that he might be a little shitty because you watch somebody like Dolly Parton. Okay. Watch her talk to anybody and you can tell a Dolly Parton is, Dolly Parton has Dolly Parton no matter what she's so she speaks from the heart. You can tell she's warm, but this, this guy is dark city, darkness, darkness, darkness, darkness. Yeah, but he doesn't embrace the darkness. He keeps pushing it and pushing it away. And that's what that looks like when you're like, hi, I'm nice. I promise some nights it love me and everybody likes me. Daddy. Hey, okay, well how did I do here? How did I do?

Speaker 1:          00:51:21       Hey Tom here inside your mom's house studio where we fill every episode is pretty cool, man. I just want to nail down tour. I wanted to call it the, tag it down your throat out. You're assholes who are, but it's just take it down. Uh, uh, I wanted announced some days because you guys asked me, you said, can you let us know way ahead of times. We can be able to go to as many of these as we want to. Yeah, so here's the first two men. Oh, we're going to do the May sonic in San Francisco, January 4th Oh, such a love fest there last time. And then we just added a Oklahoma City on Tuesday actually goes, see commonly on Tuesday, we're going to be Tuesday the city at the tower theater and that's gonna be January 22nd we're going to have so much fun. Hey dressed. Where are your favorite things? And this, this whole thing is going to be like sports fun. It's like, hey comedy, while we're getting physical. I like that.

Speaker 4:          00:52:20       Yeah, you're super relatable and you're connecting a normal, right? You're like, this is a normal guy. You did a great job. Thank [inaudible]. I was laughing as I was filming you. Okay. Here's another, and another really presumptuous thing he says during the stadium tour plug, it's like you guys wanted to know all the dates so you can land your lives around my fucking concert. Not only that plan to go as many as these, as many of these, I know you want to come to like 10 of these actually that's the one thing he is actually not lying about. Oh my God. He put a show on sale at Notre Dame stadium where the football gamers play fighting Irish play. And it was like, I mean it was a minute, two minutes. So he's like the grateful dead cause people just follow. And here's the thing, I was talking to a friend about that.

Speaker 4:          00:53:13       I was like, the fascinating thing is like you telling me that Beyonce or Bruno Mars or somebody like that is a huge act or the stones. I'm like, yeah, of course. And I hear people talk about them all the time. He's the only guy who I've never heard.

Speaker 12:         00:57:23       for David Letterman. Hi, it's Andy. David. Any better man? I'm so bummed because she usually wears her Adidas three stripes. I was really excited to see you and that's why I wore it. I've worn it the same night as well cause you look like you could be my tribe in eastern bloc or vibe to you. Well I feel like I started a posting my pictures and thing and people were like what about Chris? Like they were like, they were trying to start a beef between us. No such thing. I love and respect you too much. There's no way. You're like one of the girls, the comedy store I always liked cause you come, you come with jokes. You know what I'm saying? Like I like I always respect a female comic. Any comic that comes and tries to like take a swing, do, don't just push the owl. It's a wild thing to not do comedy while you're on stage. Right.

Speaker 12:         00:58:12       It's just so like what? Why would you put the audience through this? What are you doing and all the like, it's so lecturer in shooting now two, it's like what you're not, you're going to not only not do jokes, which is what they paid for, but then also like condemned their law, their lifestyles. Right. What are you doing? Cause you can make fun. Like it's fun to make fun of people you don't agree with because that's the best. It's like when you write a joke that's good enough that you're both laughing at them. That's like the ultimate, I don't know why people,

Speaker 1:          00:58:37       yeah, we're in this place now to where it's actually the reason that there is people lecturing all of that is because comedy is so popular, so it's actually great that we're in a business that is so popular. It's so big that people who suck at it can still do it.

Speaker 12:         00:58:51       Yeah. People accept that. Like they're one of the people they it to like the boom I'm or the night. Yeah. It's fantastic. If you're actually good, not in a boom. Only the really good people get to do it. It does feel good. And by keep complaining ladies keep coming. Yeah, I'm just going to keep doing the spots. I love it. And that's why I love Annie Letterman because you're fucking ride or die. She's the real deal. She grinds that whole bullshit to that. I've heard they're like, there's no women at the store. I've been at the store with a bunch of women. They never mentioned

Speaker 13:         00:59:22       me and those arguments, because I don't fit the narrative because I'm not like a famous draw a really, you know, like some people will come out to see me but I'm not going to like fill the seats. Like I'm not the one like making the main room a or whatever. So they don't bring me up because you know, like I just showed that you can like, like work hard and do the job and not like what like, you know, when you guys are counting lineups, like when I was at your stage in comedy, I was like, uh, doing like I was like on stage, you know, it's not like I had all these people. I remember when I started doing Mike's and uh, New York and these girls would get mad at me. It wasn't just girls, but it was like, you know, this certain like class of comedians that I like I guess started with, they would get so mad.

Speaker 13:         01:00:02       Like I had one girl who like blocked me on all these social media things and I was like, wait, what's happening? I see you every day. And she was like, I'm mad because you, you always leave the mix before I go on, I'm like, bitch, you aren't on my radar. I've never met you. I'm not friends with you. Like oh this is my job. Like I wasn't getting paid at it but I was like, you know, I quit drinking to do this. I moved to new, like I, I sacrificed a lot. I didn't have friends. Like I was like wanting to do it. So I was like, I had a day job working as a waitress and I would immediately, I had my hustle down where I had like friends that would sign me up from right there. I would sign them up and I was doing like five Mike's a night.

Speaker 13:         01:00:35       So I'm like, what's a, what's up bitches? I'm like crying blood at the end of the week. What are you doing? Wow, you don't five mics. And then I had a, yeah, it was a Mike Lawrence when I first started doing open mics. I've been doing comedy 10, almost 10 now, so I still feel very young in it. But, um, I had moved, I had lived in Santa Fe and I was drinking a bunch. I quit drinking, moved to New York or move to Santa Fe. I lived in Santa Fe for seven years. I went to college there to the College of Santa Fe, which went out of business. My College fucking Trump feud. They went out of business. Um, I got an email from my, I had moved to New York. Um, I had all these incompletes and I just figured like I would graduate college at some point before I died and left Santa Fe, moved to New York, had just quit drinking and started doing open mikes.

Speaker 13:         01:01:25       And I get a message on my Facebook from one of my old art professors and she's like, um, I just, the is going out of business and we've got a record of all the people that have been completed to do a foreign completes, but you have two weeks to finish them if you want to graduate. Yeah. And this was a bitch that would like, I would skip her class and she would call me and I'm like, get away from me bitch. Like, what do you my mom click? I'm like, I'm in college now. I don't have to go to class. I'm like, no clue. So what did you end up doing? Um, I ended up getting an Adderall prescription and charging on my credit card, a bunch of flights and shit. I had to fly to Santa Fe twice in two weeks because I had a statistics class that's so hard and if I like statistics, but it's like memorizing all these numbers and shit.

Speaker 13:         01:02:06       And it had been years since I had gotten my incomplete, where I just like didn't do a midterm or something, like something where I just, I used to send it to my teachers. I'm like, I thought it was called my terms. I do them when I want. Like I just was, I was such a small school and I just use my gift of Gab to get through things. Um, but the, the guy that wouldn't, the guy that was my statistics teacher was, uh, it was, the school was founded by the Christian brothers, so he was like this Christian brother who brother Brian who was like, he looked like the salary on Veggie Tales. Like he just had like the craziest, like shaped head and shit. But he would wear like this cloak with like the rabbit teeth things and they were just so weird and it was like, they looked like ghosts from another time, but he was very strict and like what, just give me like, my other teachers are like, just write something and we'll just, you know, give you a grade.

Speaker 13:         01:02:53       He made me fucking, he gave me, first of all, he gave me a d. I flew with her twice, but I had to learn, relearn statistics of all. Let's try my lease. I paid a girl in beer to do my statistics labs and call it. That's how much I couldn't do it. I was so stupid with math and it's like, yeah you can't, well you have to pay attention so much and you have to completely get the concept of it to yeah. I'm not interested. He said about 10 years ago. So this is like 2008 yeah, 2008 you start doing Mike's in New York. It's something you always wanted to do. I wanted to do it. I moved to, I was drinking so much and I crashed in my, I had a motor scooter that I crashed in Santa Fe. So how much were you drinking? A lot.

Speaker 13:         01:03:32       I was like Jaeger for breakfast. You're hardcore. Yeah, well I was like dealing with a lot of like self hate and shit, so I would just sort of like squash it down. So you had to start early in the morning for that. I drank all the time. I drank all day and I had a motor scooter and I was also a waitress and a bartender. So it's like that sort of culture where everyone's drinking in Santa Fe is a very small town of like a lot of people are retired. And then she was like this, this younger, there were like two colleges but there were small. Um, but you know, it was just like a weird, like, what are you going to do? You know, always nice. Yeah, it's beautiful. It's beautiful. Um, so do you stopped drinking there before you go to New York? I go hard. And Santa Fe and Santa Fe go hard.

Speaker 13:         01:04:16       And then in New York I'm going hard, but it's like nobody else's, like it's, I'm just on a different, I'm on like a desert level of drunk. Like I'm like, I was like an Indian casinos with Indians and you know what I mean? Or am drinking, um, am drinking all day dreams. Tell me, tell me that. Like when you wake up, is it like you'd go to your cabinet? Well, it depends on like it was, it would depend. No, not cabinet. It would be like I would wake up late and just probably go to bars. But I had, I remember I had a boyfriend once in college who was so gay. It was like, I mean he's married to a woman now. I don't share it as a kid. I think he's like, I want to have to fuck her stinky Plessy. She's already got a kid.

Speaker 13:         01:04:52       Um, but she's so grouse or tuna anyway. But um, she, he, um, we would drink a lot to think he was drinking. Like, cause he was like going try to like, but it was always like, he was always like, let's have this dude, fuck us. I'm like, all right. I'm like, why are you looking at him? But it's so weird. I thought it was just get so drunk. Everything was like, so like partyish or whatever. And I remember we would invite threesomes. Is that you're saying? Yeah, well there was way we were always part. There was always a party where it was never like how he was a guy into this. Never had, there was never a girl. Straight guys aren't into that. Another dude and the party. I used to always an college and make my boyfriend's make out with other boys and be like, to assert my dominance over their own sexuality.

Speaker 13:         01:05:36       Whoa. Yeah. And they would always accept and they always broke up with me as soon as I have a deep voice and a mustache. So I think I like attract, I'm like the guys like last dude like, but he but, but that guy we used to, we called the Jack Daniels Oj. So in the morning we'd be like, Yo, pass the Oj damn. Like then you're going hard. You're not drinking wine or beer and you're like, Yeager, Jack Daniels. I wanted to get fucking blackout. Take a break from this bitch. Have you been in therapy or have you gone to any kind of program or counseling? I went to therapy a couple times and then I was like, they keep making me mad at my parents. It's so annoying. And now I'm like in a rage and my parents like I should probably go to therapy. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         01:06:24       I was like, why do they keep bringing my parents up? It's like, I, I've dealt with that. Um, but I went to, I did go to Aa for a year or not for your, sorry for three months, but it seems like I'm a chip. And then I was like, oh no bitches. I'm fine. It seems like you have a good, I mean, listen, I follow you on Instagram. I see that you visit your family, you seem to have a good relationship with them now. They did some terrible things though. Like I'm like, wow, I'm like, you motherfucker, you still like them. I love them. It's Stockholm Syndrome. I don't know. I love them. I'm just like, well, I just started playing hard to get with them. Like I realized I was holding a boom box up to my mom's window, like playing on your eyes. I'm like, why am I trying to fuck my parents?

Speaker 13:         01:07:03       It literally feels like I'm like strangling a puppy with them and like, I love you so much. Why don't you love me back. And so I'm like, I'm not calling them. And I'm like talking to them not that often. I'm like, Yo, you guys remember when we used to talk every day that was literally just me annoying you. So whatever. We'll see. Oh I'm, yeah, I'm, I'm not yeah, I love them. I forgive them. But um, so they, I want them to feel a little guilt that they don't feel that what you're saying, if you feel like they don't love you, they don't show you. No, I know they lack a paralegal. You know, they love me. I totally know they love me. I think that maybe, um, my ability to love is a little bit stronger than theirs and, but it's probably be a product of the neglect as a child.

Speaker 13:         01:07:47       It's just my mom like, didn't I keep thinking about it? Cause I was talking to my boyfriend about it and they didn't teach me to like read and stuff. Like they didn't, I didn't, I just am learning about history. Like they sent me to a juvenile delinquent school and I had Kinda wasn't like everyone got kicked out of their schools. I didn't, they just like were like, there's an art program. Like they just put me in a school with like, like young criminals, criminals. I was like, no. And I was like, smoking a cigarette here and there. I was like, I wasn't like a good kid, but they were literally not paying attention to me that that was like an Annie door instead of a job to get it over, just like send me out. And they're like, she'll come back, which it's like when I'm hungry, but it's like I was like a cute little kid. Like I was kind of like a, a pretty little girl. And so they just, they didn't realize like what did they know they were sending you to a juvenile delinquent school? Yeah. I don't know what they do that

Speaker 1:          01:08:34       well.

Speaker 13:         01:08:35       Are they immigrant? And by the way, are not my mom was adopted. It's like, wow.

Speaker 1:          01:08:40       Well why would they send you to that school?

Speaker 13:         01:08:42       I mean, okay. So they didn't teach me anything. I was never taught manners or how to act or anything. And then I'll kind of get in trouble just like for just like existing the way you would like, I pretty much was like the jungle book. Sure. And um, I'm like jungle, I'm just wanting topless just in a loin cloth. Everyone's mad at me. Um, but they uh, Brown skinned at that time too. Oh boy. But they, they sent me to, so they would just like send me this, I don't know. I was like hanging out with adults all the time. I may just like always had like grown up friends who wanted to hang out with like a seven year old. Do you know how fucking weird that is? Yes. I just was getting dead left and right. I mean they were literally just like, do you want, they're like, oh, do you think our daughter's beautiful?

Speaker 13:         01:09:23       However, it just was like very, my mom was mad. I'm a twin and she don't only want to have two kids. And I think she like kind of like was like overwhelmed and I was terrified and she didn't. My mom had a pituitary, I had no idea when she was little, which was like a, a growth in her arra tumor on her pituitary gland. So she didn't like it or period till she was 19 or anything. So she has like a really weird relationship with femininity and she was adopted so she's like pissed her birth mom. Yeah, these are all things I'm just making up, but I think I'm ready. I think I'm correct. Like she's never, I mean she will confirm, I guess she's always like, you always call me out on stuff. I'm like, well dude, one of my friends never call me

Speaker 1:          01:09:59       as a kid was super artsy, just like [inaudible] creative kid and his parents. One day we were in the same school and then he started going to school. He was like, my buddy, you know? Yeah. And so I was like, where is he in there? Like a sound to another school. And they arranged for me to visit him one day in that school and I visited him and it was a, an extra, like a school for extreme developmentally disabled.

Speaker 13:         01:10:25       I walked into his class and it was, what was it called? Landmark. But I was like, the fuck are you doing here? And he was like, yeah, this is where I go to school. Like I'm retarded. I mean, yeah. Can I say that? I can talk as I can say retargeting and bags. I don't want to out you, but they said you have to say retarded or are we delete the episode? They banned from the stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:10:49       So yeah, it was um, it was at I, I mean there were kids like bouncing off the walls. There was super violent kids, people, this was like my school and I was like, why are you, and then years later, you know, he's a totally just regular guy, sweet, sweet guy. And I go, what? Like what was that all about? And they're like, yeah, my parents just thought my like artistic inclinations weird.

Speaker 12:         01:11:13       So they just sent me to this school and it was completely, I'm sure traumatizing actually to him to be there to see your surroundings. And they're like, this is where you belong. You belong amongst these kids. Which he did not. Well, it is weird when you, when you're put in a group like that, you're like, wait, is this what you think I am? Is this, what year was that? Did that really play or was that just in my head? I'm like, I hear that all the time and that exact boy every time I'm about to talk. Um, but no, it really is like a weird thing because, you know, they just wouldn't brother. And we were held back in kindergarten because of my brother had learning disabilities. And then, um, in second grade when I couldn't read, um, they were like, well, my mom would always tell me, well then we found out about your learning disabilities in second grade, which is like never needed to tell me that.

Speaker 12:         01:12:07       I could have just told me the part where it was Max. But, um, so then I'm thinking back on it. I'm looking at, I'm like, I don't think I had reading problems. They told me I had a tracking problem. My mom likes sent me to this like whole institute and so all this stuff where it's like, mom, you never sat down and told me to read. Why are you acting like I was supposed to just know how to read? Like she literally never, I said that I got she, um, school home to me. She's like, I thought she just sent me to school to do all the home things and yeah, she was like, they'll do it, but I'm like, you know, all the parents are like also sitting down with their kids. It's not like they're just sending them and like the teachers have like all these other students.

Speaker 12:         01:12:40       So then I would stay after with my regular teacher and she would give me, and then I learned to read really easily. It just sounds like, you know, I mean, I think my mom wanted to have a fucking nar, Nar, Nar, Nar, Nar. What do you mean? He was just another word for retired, those evil. I also was a special ed teacher, so I should be better about this. But now, you know, I'm learning about this in therapy because I fucking hate my parents too. And um, it doesn't go away. When you have your own, it actually gets amplified. What happens is when you start to raise your own children, you go like, what the fuck? Wait a minute. And you start to go back into your own things and you, you know, you have to free, I forgive, obviously I'm not like actively angry anymore anymore, but you start to realize like they're just incapable of seeing your needs, which is so devastating cause you're like, why did nobody see that?

Speaker 12:         01:13:30       Why didn't nobody realize that like little Annie needed help reading or it's just so wild. It's like, why? It's like my mom in front of my boyfriend, I was like, mom, I don't remember you like teaching in or did you teach me to read? And she starts laughing. She's like, of course not. Like she thinks it's so funny. She's a fuck up. I'm like, you could just try to be better. What about your other eye? Did they learn to read? Um, Ma, no. Ever. They, they gave us both. They give us all like disabled, like things, you know? Oh God. It's just like, wow, how did they get my number? It's just, I get calls all day and it's all like some robot bitch or horse or political, remember your taxes. And I'm like trying to forget them. Stop doing that. Are you kidding me? I do this at in the morning. Not now.

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       Yeah, but it's infuriating when your parents don't see you or don't care to know

Speaker 13:         01:14:16       just how the, when I'm like, I'm telling you the exact truth and I'm giving you even the words you could say back. Right. And you can't do it. It's like, but I think there's so many like secrets that people grow and I think that generation too, like we're much more like we talked to like telling everyone all our shit, but it's like, um, you know, like there's so many secrets and there's so many things that you have to tell yourself and lighters of about to not like let the dominoes fall. So I do understand that, but it's like, I'm just like, you guys are in the evening of life. Do you not want to like settle the beef? Like this is it, right? Like I'm here being like, come on, let's do this. And it's just, my dad said he would go to therapy with me and then I was like, oh, he would. Yeah, my dad would be my dad's. My Dad's cool about it. It's just like, I don't know what I realized the things that I need from them, I just need to give to myself and there's just no, and I just need to get your a narcissist, she sounds like.

Speaker 4:          01:15:11       Yeah, it's hard. It's really hard to have a parent that's like, they can't, they don't,

Speaker 13:         01:15:16       do you want to hear about my last show in Philly? Yeah. Okay. So my parents do the landmark forum, um, which I know that's amazing that they even did that. No, they didn't do it once. They've been doing it for 12 years. You know what I do, you know when you do a thing and it's supposed to teach you how to like go into the rest of your life and we'll explain to people what landmark is. Self Development.

Speaker 13:         01:15:39       Um, it's called [inaudible]. It's like, it depends on how you use it. It's, but it's a self development thing. It's a derivative from s and you go on to like a seminar, you go into a seminar and it's so you'd pay like, I don't know, it's like 800 bucks or something. Which little pricey. Um, you go into a seminar and there's like one leader, there's no, all the walls are white, you know, all the chairs are uniform. You sit there, it's like really, you know, they force you to pay attention and it's all about, it's kind of like, it's a lot of different, um,

Speaker 3:          01:16:09       yeah,

Speaker 13:         01:16:09       theories of, uh, psychology put in one, but it's, you know, essentially like you're getting to the point of like where your life is empty and meaningless so you can fill it in. You're creating these stories, but there's all of these like specific words they use, which I, you know, I did it when I was 19. My parents want me to do, and I did it and it was, you know, it's that feeling that a weird feeling you get in at the end of it where you're kind of surrendering and it feels very cold. It feels just very like a religion almost. People always. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:16:34       I mean, I didn't go through it, but you hear a lot of times people describe or liking it to some version of like Scientology. Right? So it's just very, yeah, when I saw the Scientology thing, I was like, Ooh, the shades Atlanta, it's like therapy. But in front of other people. From what I understand, like you, you give speeches to hundreds of other people and you share all these very personal things with groups, right? So it's not like, personally I never said white people didn't take all that money and just go see a therapy

Speaker 13:         01:17:00       one for a decade. Also, they pull, they pull you. I know. It's like a cowardly, the, I don't know. Like for me, I do anything but that like, I'm like, I guess I believe in psychics. Like I guess we get my Tarot cards read. There's something like, so confronting about therapy I think for people, for me at least. And of course, yeah, it's just a lie. And I'm like, I'm paying you this much fucking money. But, um, all right. So, uh, with the thing, the problem that I had with landmark was at the end of it, they then go, you should reconnect with all these people. And I've had a lot of people do me dirty and I always accepted responsibility. My parents included, where it was so hard for me to, like, I didn't want to blame anyone else. It just seemed easier to blame myself and to just believe I was like born rotten and I was just like this bad seed or whatever.

Speaker 13:         01:17:42       Then to admit that literally every fucking grown up in my life, let me down, did not do their job. And that to me was like a scarier world and just being like, I'm a piece of shit living in this course. Right? So then I'm in landmark and then at the end they want, it's all about like reconnecting with anyone you have any sort of like ill will with or anything. And it's not, that's probably not the message of the landmark. They probably don't say anyone. But to me it's like I'm nice and I want people to like me and, and uh, with, you know, with my, at that stage, especially with my parents and stuff. So it was like, I'm like looking for this like approval all the time. So I wanted to connect with everyone. Now I'm at the age where I want to disconnect with so many people.

Speaker 13:         01:18:19       I'm like, get the f like, yeah Yo, if I haven't talked to in four years, don't you dare ask me for free tickets. Right. Get the fuck like I don't know you are but whatever. Maybe not four years. But it's just like, you know, I was like collecting people all the time. So then when landmarks sort of at the end of the weekend when they're like reconnect with people, I'm reconnecting with people that really fucked me over like not fucked me over in a little way, but like that are not, are dangerous people for me to be around and then I'm having to call them and tell them what I did wrong. Boy, like I'm what's called, I had to take a teacher to, to court for sexually assaulting me and he was like, God, I broke this whole ring of his. Like it was like I was sexually assaulted by a teacher for real and I actually went to court and no one believed me.

Speaker 13:         01:18:58       And you don't need people to believe you. You need the judge to believe you anyway. You don't need your friend. It's like a popularity thing to be like, I don't fucking need that. Like that's like a, you took him to court. I go to, but um, he got three years probation, so I'm like, I couldn't put, yeah, he pled guilty high school or now he's, um, I think he wasn't allowed, I can't remember what the thing the deal was, but middle school, high school, I was in high school, I was 15 or 16, and then I'm no help from anyone. I mean it was like really it was, it was and your parents, my parents did, but it's their fault. It happened. So it's like, uh, you know, looking back I'm like, oh, of course they wanted to like settle and stuff because my parents just, um, I was just not, I was given no rules.

Speaker 13:         01:19:42       I was given no discipline at all. So I was always in these crazy, dangerous situations. And I also wasn't taught that I was good, you know, like, so I was, my mom is very competitive with me and she would do that. She was so antifeminist femininity because of, I believe, because she didn't have her period and shit until she was older that it was, you know, she, her way to like relate to dudes was to like, Bro, you know, like, which I do too, but it's like sh, you know, she was always like the only woman on the, she would play like men's racquetball rather than, you know, I'm just like, she always had to be like the only girl. So, um, so then, um, she, it just was very like, uh, yeah. I don't, I don't know, but just so they had earlier before that happened when I was 15 or, I'm sorry, this is what I was saying.

Speaker 13:         01:20:27       My mom would, um, she never would let people say I was pretty or anything. Like, it was always be like, she's smart, but it was like, I didn't, I literally got the message that I wasn't pretty, which like I'm not, I don't, I think that it's gross for girls to run around and being like, I'm hot shit or whatever. But I think there was a level of awareness. I was a level of attractive that that was, it was dangerous to send me out. Like it was like, um, like I was just, I was a girl, she was treating me like a boy in a way, you know, I was just not, the boys don't get molested all the time, but it was like, I just, um, I just had no clue what I looked like until like this year. So I was always like confused. I'm like, I'm flashing my tits. Why? He's never mad at me. I look like a boy. Like what? You know, like, oh, I don't look like a boy. Um, and so there was just like this kind of like nagging of my, of my looks all the time to the point where I wasn't sure what I looked like.

Speaker 4:          01:21:17       Right, right. Cause I can be, it's bad on the others. I can understand why she probably overcorrected because on the one hand to tell the little girl she didn't want to be lying. Yeah. All the time. Then you turn them into a dumb role with no identity. Right. But to go the, Oh, the overcorrection is to not acknowledge that you are an attractive little girl and that people might want to prey upon you. It was just like very, you know, we were brought up Quaker, my mom, which we weren't what we were brought up. Quaker just not our mentioned now. And that's how many layers are there. Jesus. A lot of layers. When does the book come out? This fucking crazy. Wait, what happened last time you were a, did a show in Philly, you were going to say? Oh yeah. Okay. So

Speaker 13:         01:21:54       I'm in Philly and, um, my mom, uh, she was landmark. So all of her landmark for shooting bites all over laminates and all today it's at, um, punchline. So she invites all of her, you know, which it's like, all right, that's cute that you're, you know, cause I'm looking at it like she's proud of me or whatever, but that's how it is. Okay. That's not what it is. You're an extension of her. Right. I'm, I'm, uh, I'm someone who's getting a platform that she can take. I don't even wouldn't even say an extension of her. Um, I, I wouldn't even say I would love to be cleaned like that. I wouldn't want you to be like, that sounds so awesome. So she, um, all of our friends come and, um, and it's Christmas and my mom owns an Ebay dropoff storm and I might eat my mom's Ebay drop of sore.

Speaker 13:         01:22:46       She gets a bunch of weird shit and so, and she thinks it's funny to give us these gifts and none of us think it's funny. It's always annoying. It's always like some, it's smells like someone's basement. It's like, oh, can you get this away from the children? Like my nieces and nephews, just like, everyone's like, please stop bringing this trash into our house. But, so that's like her big bet is that she brings us like weird shit from, so I'm onstage, I'm just starting, I'm, I get really nervous in Philly because I had all this stuff happened in high school, so I, I really get nervous. People are going to, I don't, I don't like anyone from like my friends. Like I'm like, I don't want anyone from my high school to show I'm scared. I have a lot of predators there. So I'm like, um, I got real nervous and may feel he shows and um, I was trying to, like I was working on, I wanted to get a tapes.

Speaker 13:         01:23:30       He had a special, and I was like telling my mom that day I was like, I really need to, I'm just nervous because I really want to make sure I, I have a good order for my jokes and I just want to make sure I stay on track. I have so much anxiety. Okay. So the week, I'll tell you about the year before when I did Thanksgiving there. All right after this. So she, so for some dumb reason I forgot my mom's, my mom and I think me telling her this will let her know to really not interrupt and not be difficult. She drives me into the, I go with her and to the, to the club. Okay. So I'm with her the whole time. So I don't see her bringing anything in or anything because I'm just not paying attention. I'm just like a little bit nervous trying to stay on track, get there.

Speaker 13:         01:24:11       She's trying to it. I'm like, I don't want to be your friend. Like I don't have time for this. I have to like, you know, kept pumped. So I get on stage and I'm, I'm, I'm a little nervous. I have a like a rougher start than usual and uh, and maybe five minutes in when I'm just getting my, starting to get my bearings, she throws a present onstage. Okay. She snuck a fucking president. She snuck a fucking present in through it and threw it onto the stage. She goes, Hey, I got you a present and throws like while I'm in the middle of the joke. So then, okay, so her friends are there, but they're not, it's, it's like, I don't think I was sold out, but I was like a few seats shy being sold out this month. I don't know how those motherfuckers do that.

Speaker 13:         01:24:54       We're all of a sudden I'm not getting a bonus. I'm like, oh, that was, I'm like, how did, how did my people just not, there couldn't have been like five more people. But anyway, it was very close. It was like two 55 yet to 51. It was just like, but it was like they were telling the truth. I'm like, it was like when they see it, I was like, oh, I'm so almost a draw. But then so okay, so then, but so she makes up like there's maybe like 12 of her friends, so she's not making up that much of the audience, but it's enough where I'm like, Ma, you know, like, so she, so she throws the present on stage and now I'm like, I gotta I just barely gotten the audience on my side. So now I'm, um, I have to take a present, open it, like in retrospect, I should've thrown at her.

Speaker 13:         01:25:37       He's like totally took, taken her down as if she was a regular person and not my mom embarrassed her in front of her friends and possibly had her kicked out, but I was still being like, I don't wanna hurt my mom's feelings. Right. I don't wanna embarrass her in front of her friends. So I'm trying to like, make it work in both ways. So now I have to, I have to get away from the microphone to open this present. My hands aren't on the mic. My hands are now doing another thing. I have to look down at a thing. I have no control over the audience at this point. Right now. People are looking at her. I have to now, now and then what it is is it's a fucking like an arm, not like a, not like a sexist but like uh, like an arm that nurses would use to try like their ivs on or whatever.

Speaker 13:         01:26:22       So she throws his arms like, so now I have to explain who my fucking mom is, what her job is, why should we give me this present all this stuff. And it was just like, so I was so mad and I had a really bad set cause I was so like of course and like it was like I got like bad review. Like I never got bad. Like, I mean we all get bad reviews here and there, but like I never get in Philly. I usually get like really good reviews and it was like, I got like bad, like I got like people were writing about it like she saw like all this, I'm like, mom, you fucking bitch. Like yeah, that's my money. Like that's my job. Like, and I remember like talking and she was like, what? I'm just like, well how did you go? Sorry, can't you just like get over it? Like I didn't mean to. And it's like, let's play this out. Let's say that had killed what? Where would the audience be looking at you bitch, not at me like that. It wouldn't like you just completely took, so then you didn't like the gift. Yeah, she was like, come on, I got you an arm thing. Maybe I did lie. I do actually have of Jada Pinkett Smith about this.

Speaker 14:         01:27:23       I've been sitting here and just thinking about forgiveness and it's been a deep journey for me because I've had to look into the shadows of my own heart and understand how I've heard other people and forgive myself for any wrong accident. My, for what you're doing to me now you're, yes, you're not my people. I had to clear myself with my own shame, my own guilt, and have compassion for myself and forgiveness.

Speaker 13:         01:27:51       What is selfish apology, right? Why does everyone think everyone gives a fucking shit? It's so unbelievable. What is this new thing where it's like everyone's like, vulnerability is strength. And now my, like, I'm bipolar in her like, Yo, I wouldn't, maybe not like, well, and there's a time and a forum where you could all say your shit, but it's like, I'm just saying, everyone's like not on social media is my thing where it's like the, the, like the where it's like we're at this place where it's now like, like naked chicks showing their cellulite and they're like, look, I'm Bree, or brave or whatever. I'm like, getting attention for your body is not bravery. Like that's not, they were like, now I can also do this thing that was also kind of gross appropriate. My favorite are chicks that were, or their ugly mud masks. They're like, look how ugly I am right now. It's just,

Speaker 1:          01:28:39       yeah, it's silly. Uh, but by the way, we have to watch red table talk on Facebook. Oh my God. I've never been more excited for anything as if the gift that Jadah provides isn't big enough. She is coming out with a new show with will. Yes. We're going to explain everything.

Speaker 13:         01:28:56       Yes. On Facebook. People crying and breaking down. Do not bring me today. I've broken you enough.

Speaker 8:          01:29:03       All right, so hold on, let's clear something swinger. Just historical room. Jadah Jayda deep down inside I was insecure little boy. That one jaded is say I was great. You know why I never got divorced? It's cheaper to keep me,

Speaker 12:         01:29:24       it's so interesting to me that they're willing to put like they are doing the social thing. They're movie stars. You know? It's like, but what is, what is driving the necessity like that guys says he wants to do any movie. It's just like greenlight. We'll make it any anytime. What do you think it is? She wants to humiliate him. You think so this whole thing, am I broken you enough? No, no, no. She wants to. Why would he agree to it? To distill the gay rumors. Yeah, they're going to just still those, they're going to just steal the open marriage rumors. They're going to discipline. She also, part of her wants the acknowledgment, the recognition for being jade Pinkett kid into it though. It's like they bring the kids in that willow, she's good on it. Cause I had been watching red table talk on Facebook and she's probably the most, my most favorite part of it all because her face is funny.

Speaker 12:         01:30:12       And she's like, Damn. Like she makes these cute little faces. She's a gift. She's very, she's very, yeah, she's a total again, but she's very likable. The kids or the kids sweet now Jadah you, she gets very vulnerable. She talks about why she's been wearing her head wraps lately. I'm fascinated. I was hair loss. She's had hair loss. That's fun. Yeah. And then she talks about sex with her grandma and her daughter and went up to the that vulnerability. I do appreciate it. Amaze. It's on. It's on Facebook watch and we have to start watching it. Talking about sponsored by them.

Speaker 12:         01:30:49       Um, do you guys know that it's a full time job to be a good dad? He got so much more stuff than I had. It's the lyrics to that song. I was like, it's a full time job to be a good dad. That's right. I forgot that horse more of an option. I be like part time two of us. Right? I think you were cheaper when I met you when I started most definitely in personality or moneywise. Um, now are you a frugal person or how do you approach no, I just make money and then I spend it all and then I'm broke and then I freak out. And that's your pattern. Well, these are people who are the extreme of cheap. I think they'll, you'll appreciate them if this is what I think it is. It is about them. And I was like, that's so crazy that sheep.

Speaker 12:         01:31:47       I was like, well smiths afraid he's going to run out. No Way. Is this a TLC show? Yes. I already know. You already know. I fucking love this. Um, but go ahead. Just some of it's just going to fuck this shit. I live for this. So this is my bathtub. Look at it's brand new and shiny. I don't even have to clean it. There's no mildew. All my crowd, which is amazing. I has never cleaned it because I've never used it. I have a gym membership and that's where I take my shower. I like to work out and kind of a gym rat. I'm there every day anyway. Well first of all, it's not. I mean, what do those traps? She's like, this is on the rat. My urine. In an effort to save money, I started peeing in a jar. Just uh, maybe to save energy.

Speaker 12:         01:32:34       I like to be in your bed, but don't go into the bathroom. Wait, why did she say, she's reminding me she's going to save on the water bill water bill. Yeah, just what she does. We're going to get to that. Somebody's got to planet fitness. A $10 a month. Here you go. Big Time, money savings, quite pungent. And the longer it sits, the stronger it an apple juice. One line that you can put your urine into your compost pile. And I thought, Wow, I can pee in a jar. Build my compost. Oh God, no. He used to shoot from Philly, right. That acts, haste and that one when it's on one over easy exit over there. It's a gross accident. How much can you save pissing into, we're about to find out why would you do $30 a month to $20 a month? So there's $10 right there.

Speaker 12:         01:33:25       So I pee in a bottle, but don't get me wrong, I, you know, I pooped like everybody else and I put that in the toilet. What did in the toilet flush, there's a middle man. The process, I put the with the toilet, I poop over here and then I put it in the, and she sells over handmade jewelry, but she also has some Nice Ted's. It's like, come on girl, get a Webcam. She has a, she says she flushed twice a day with the browns. Yeah. So she's got healthy movements. So she saved $10 a month doing way bigger psycho like that. This lady, this lady makes that. Is this how you guys stay in love? You just look at people that are way worse than you? Of course. Yes. I don't do laundry. You have to pay quite a bit in quarters, so whenever I have dirty clothes, I tried to watch them while I'm showering.

Speaker 12:         01:34:15       I'm using a free sample of detergent. I got detergent and reach my clothes, put them in the shower. I love this. I love it. I get it. Whenever did this in college, make it on camera again. If you're willing to get naked on camera, you can make some money. Exactly. She's, she's halfway there. She says the last time that I did laundry, it was three years ago, three years ago, and they start ringing out in these clothes. It gets better. She's a yes. Just want to do all that expensive laundry and don't use the dryer. I only does it ride

Speaker 15:         01:34:58       around waste money, but it's a shrink's clothes and their wears clothes out faster. Yeah. You can keep your clothes looking new order for longer if you don't dry them.

Speaker 12:         01:35:06       No, the Jewish Asians,

Speaker 15:         01:35:09       well, normally I wouldn't want to maybe a load of laundry every other week. It's cost like $3 to wash and dry clothes. Say maybe $6 a month.

Speaker 12:         01:35:18       $6 she's not destitute. I mean, look at her bathroom. It's nice. I mean that's six bucks in your pocket. That's actually her whole apartment. You didn't know that she lived in the bathroom. This is like an Indian. She pays us $50 a month to live in that battle. Now I will admit that in college I may have hand washed underwear a few times. Yeah, that's not that crazy. Come on. You guys wash your underwear. You guys were underwear. How old are you? He doesn't wear underwear. It freaks me out. How do you have your deck rubbing against denim jeans and so it doesn't burn. I know. Told us. He's just like, he's got stuff to do, man. He's doesn't that time to put fucking underwear all the time. How's he gotten rid of that eyelash? I can't. No, it's so, it's truly upsetting. I know. It's like, it may as well be like an ass hair. Like there's just, it's like so decided for a decade now since we've wait, you mean it's never, he's never gotten rid of it now he's had it since we've known her. And imagine how many times that comes into your just I, yeah. How does he get out when you, when you see one kind of like an eyebrow here. Oh Shit. Took a point. I don't know how many deals with that

Speaker 15:         01:36:24       toilet paper. I just use water and soap to clean myself off. After going to the bathroom, I'd take his water bottle that I have and like rinse myself off if I just urinated, it's, I'm done with that. And then I dry myself off with one of the paper towels I have if I took a dump. And then I also ran a salt wipe myself down with soap.

Speaker 12:         01:36:43       Do you see how little that soapland chalk

Speaker 15:         01:36:46       and rinse off the soap fights? I don't believe in spending money on something that you're just going to throw away such as toilet paper or paper towel.

Speaker 12:         01:36:52       Yeah, I think the day bitch cause I do. Yeah. She's a little proud. A little proud of it. This is mental illness. Proud of this. You think she has a boyfriend? No. Or do you think she's proud? Do you think she's like, do you think she's like, like, look how, look how awesome I've, I've figured this out. Yes. She's telling you I've got a system here it is. If I took a dumb yes, the best, breaking it down, I just felt like she wouldn't say dumb. Yeah. I don't think that that like pretty clean. Her bow pose. A pretty clean clean for sure. She's a soap on on her. After you had the baby, they tell you to squirt your vagina in the same way it did look like a baby thing. Yeah. If you're done yet, there's a square bottle and you have to wrench or virgin off that way we just, Tom not know about that.

Speaker 12:         01:37:38       Did you know that? Did I hit the squirt bottle? Are you able to stay separate from the stuff? No, I knew about that. He's sought a square bottle side by the potatoes or the little Filipino. Listen if I was a kid, I'm going to make my dude fucking know everything and be like, you have to watch it fucking heat.

It's like, yeah, but it's like it's a unique experience to yourself. Right? Like in your family, you and your husband. I don't like the sharing of a, everything the kid does too. Once it's, you know, it's weird. It's just not, the kid can't consent to that. Especially if you have like any type of fan base. It's funny. Yeah. You don't want them talking to you too much about your know. Um, you have a boyfriend, but in case you ever are single again, Kinda always have them. Here's some good advice. Somebody. Yeah.

The fatness is only accentuated by this cut his prison pussy and it also, it does kind of look like as an extended asshole. So what is it like a gaping asshole? Yeah. Yeah. Not a good look

Speaker 16:         01:40:05       are crazy beat up women or women that are addicted to pills or ranking or other were just to have some men issues all together.

Speaker 12:         01:40:18       Maybe he's scarred a little bit from some past experiences because there was a lot of restrained emotion behind it. Yeah. And it's always the, well, let's say the portly or unsightly men that tend to have really high standards for the, excuse me, excuse me,

Speaker 16:         01:40:34       don't regurgitate people from high school. There's a reason they're in your passion. Remember you're a generation x, are you? But at a high school longer than you were in high school and it's been a long, long time. Most of us graduated in the eighties and nineties most of them go back and try to grab that girl that you had a crush on me. Do not. I repeat, not do online dating. I don't care how many friends you have. Where are we supposed to go? Know somebody that knows somebody that met their wife on online dating. It is a waste of, trust me on this guys, if you ever want to feel like a leper in your basement, spend some time on online dating and also if you're from a small town like me, nobody picks up a woman that you're interested in a local bar. There's probably 20 other guys are all trying to get with her secretly. I remember we tried to shark your shit.

Speaker 12:         01:41:20       Okay. This guy's a real expert, Huh? I mean, so far he's also not, he's a, he's like that critic that tells you everything that's wrong. Yeah. You know, here's everything that's bad about everything, but no solution. They took all of the options out. Yeah. Some will. How, how's it going to go back to high school? Get out of this small town. Don't go online. Don't go here. I guess the park is the leading option right now. Come to this park. You got to meet a nice young man on fortnight. I mean, uh,

Speaker 16:         01:41:47       I work out four or five times a week. Oh, okay. And I'm, I'm not the best work out of my basement. You know, make an effort, make it better for his looks are fleeting. Now that doesn't mean go out with like a 400 pound woman.

Speaker 12:         01:42:00       Yeah. You can't be the one that mentioned the way a honey bold. It's the expectations, right? You guys got it. You can not put demands on bitches like this. Also don't, the high school thing makes no sense because you can easily reconnect with someone. Like don't maybe think it's going to be the same person. Yeah, no question. I know he's watching this guy has been, he's been burned with fire. He's very,

Speaker 16:         01:42:26       I feel like Emirates and I mean never stand for being in the friend zone. The girl says to you, I look at you as a brother, or I look at you as a friend. I look, he goes, my fat brother don't stand for arrogant women. If she's stuck up, she isn't worth it. A lot of women get big heads because they get a lot of guys flirt with them and I'll tell you what, they're not worth your time. They're not that great. Remember, they got to bring something to the table. Okay? Remember, you're the highly caloric to find somebody that you want to spend your life with.

Speaker 12:         01:42:55       What's going on? I know is I areas not good here. Oh, this is sad. This poor guy.

Speaker 16:         01:43:02       You don't need the drama. You don't need to build anybody.

Speaker 12:         01:43:06       I mean, his advice is depressing. It's just, it's really sad and it's all knows. It's like, here's a million things you shouldn't do. Goodbye. Also, here's the thing, I've dated some pretty big guys. Yeah, I don't have any problem with that, but you can't be like no fat, no fat checks. What the fuck? The fattest guy I know has a no fat check policy. Seriously. I mean like he's dead broke at a divorce. It's really, I mean, like I know a guy who seriously like three 50, he's very unsightly and, and it's fine. Right. But then he, his law, his list of demands for women is kind of like this. They just have to buy a bitch from overseas. That's what that exist for. Like the brides and

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       the Asian ladies, right? Yeah, the commands of the world. Yeah. This is a Fucking, I got to pee. You guys work it out. Oh Geez. Yeah.

Like, I honestly feel like they all tricked me and Oh man, apology. Except now, now I'm happy. But

Speaker 4:          01:44:35       all right, so you've been with the same dude for how long now? A year. Oh, that's super new. Yeah. But we were friends for like seven years. That's the way to go. I think that's the way to go.

I never, I always thought you like, they came separately, like love and intimacy and then friendship, you know? I was like, oh you fuck. And then, yeah, so I would be like hanging out with him and then we'd be having like the best time ever. Just like literally like writing jokes, laughing, just like till our stomachs hurt. And then I'd be like, oh, I gotta go back in this guy that parked my car the other day who I really like looking at this man, this fucking guy, you know? I go like Fox, I'm like roller. I'm like this guy. Rollerblades

Speaker 4:          01:45:15       so how did it, so then did he like bring that up to you?

Speaker 13:         01:45:18       Yeah, he did. Yeah, he did. He was like, you've kind of already been my girlfriend for a while and it was like, he like Jedi mind trick males like I guess, but I was like, I was not thrilled about it. At first. I was like, how dare he had promised he would never. Thank you. Um, women helping women. He, um, yeah, he had promised to a number hit on me, so awesome. Cool. Then when he did, I was pissed. But yes.

Speaker 4:          01:45:43       Is he your first serious boyfriend or how have you done boy,

Speaker 13:         01:45:46       um, I mean I'd had long term boyfriends, but they weren't serious. I was always like, this is terrible. How do I get out of this? I dated a guy, I dated a guy for three years who I just, I mean, it was, it was rough

Speaker 4:          01:46:00       for three years, like on and off.

Speaker 13:         01:46:02       No, lived with him. Oh, I was homeless when I met him. I was living in my car and, uh, this was the rollerblader and then, um, he's like a nice guy. He's a nice guy from jersey, like reminded me of home who's younger than me. Um, and he was like, you know, he wasn't gonna make me like stay in my car. I mean, I wasn't living in my car car, but I'm, and I was like sort of sleep like I would crash and I'd never hear here and there. And so, uh, he was like, stay with me. And then I was like, already I was into him in the beginning and then so I was like living with him, but then it was just like three years went by and I was like, I'm going to die. Jesus. I'm going to fucking die.

Speaker 4:          01:46:35       Wait, so you never got to do online dating and stuff. I went on to, Ooh,

Speaker 13:         01:46:39       I want on, oh, this idea of a good story. I want them to, I went on to things, but I thought it was just too bad. Like I was like, oh, I went through a breakup or something. I want to like fuck someone once or so

Speaker 12:         01:46:50       I went on, I did Riaa Joe Riaz. It's like the celebrity, the celebrity one, they exclusive like, sounds cool. It's worse. It's like, oh, hey, do you want to go on a date that, um, we'll also potentially hurt your career? Well, awesome. Well, it's just like we, it's like, just want to go on a date with a producer, like only somebody in, yeah. So it's like, it's just, it's Ryan, my friend Karen Says Ryan stands for rich asshole young asshole. But it's like very, it's like exclusive and it's just like, it's a weird, I don't know, to me it's, it's just weird. It's like you're like, Hey, Matthew Perry, uh, or whatever. Do you know what I mean? It's like you're just like, it's like a, we, it's like weird, you know, like, oh, um, but I never like cared about that shit. I never was like, I want to date a celeb.

Speaker 12:         01:47:39       Like I never super weird. I know you're married to one, but you guys are selecting. No, I was thinking cause uh, cause uh, Steve Simone, then there was like, we need a celebrity. It was like being, so Steve just came at you with such, like, we've known him a long time, right? Yeah, of course. So it's like he's had to transition the way he talks, like, do you know what I mean? Not that he hasn't always been that way, but like now he's like, he's like, um, you're, and it's like it was cause you are, but it was, it was just like the way he said it was like very, it was just very cute. He's so sweet. He's opening for me. November 24th in man, Diego, California. At the House of Blues. We plan with the school thing. We planned this whole blog. Yeah. That was seamless. I know, right?

Speaker 12:         01:48:18       He's so funny. Can I tell you what I love about Steve Smith? A positive energy. The guy always, he's, he's not talking like dark shit like we do. Like he's like, remember when you had pizza? It's like ice cream, but he's genuine. He really loves that stuff and he brings the whole room up. Like, Gosh, she's such a such a diamond. I really love that. And he's a good human. He does charity work for true TV. Never. Not, never, not farting guy on Twitter. His handle is never not funny. He was a fan of our show. He's Brad had to get him in the other pilot. One more psycho cheap person. Oh I love this. I could do this all day. It's so fun to watch. Fucking misers are my favorite.

Speaker 6:          01:49:04       I'm cutting toilet paper squares for background. Sure. Wash and use instead of paper products. We have a little band underneath the basket, the little toilet wipes or we picked him so we can wash them later. It's time to wash and just for a minute I ever have to touch them with my hand paper to anything. For me as a middle class family that makes a good income, I should and we'd have to go into debt to buy toilet paper and you

Speaker 12:         01:49:30       don't, that's the other thing. Here's the thing, they always think they're saving but the energy and time spent cutting up strips of cloth and then nuts like the dollar store, say 99 cents store way. That time I want to do is I spend 19 hours a week cutting and washing. And did you guys do like organic diapers and stuff? Did you try to do? My friend is pregnant and she's like, and I'm like, I'm just the high. I'm like, she's already like talking about Oregon. I'm like, wait, organic diapers. I'm like, wait, or like cloth type cloth diapers? No. Why don't you just not do this to yourself? Like why are you already like, I have heard such nightmare stories about cloth diapers. I just feel like you're going to, it's going to blow out once and you're not going to gross. Just ruin the environment for three years.

Speaker 6:          01:50:25       None of our cloth wipes that we've been using them for more than five years of the marketing nuance saves us $20 a month over a year. Then that is 245

Speaker 12:         01:50:36       Ooh, she's on the sped 10 hours a day. Cutting strips. No, I spend that on Amazon everyday. Like on like toothpicks. I'm like, what should I get today?

Speaker 6:          01:50:50       I had one person say she couldn't continue her washing machine. I just had to laugh because of you know, anything about and bacteria. There's no eight can survive those harsh conditions and so what your own asshole issue at all.

Speaker 12:         01:51:03       She's mocking her friend who said, do you want to wash your shit paper in the Washer? She's like, that's silly. Bitch doesn't know what she's talking about. She's like, I'm wearing one of my shit. Rags as a, the kid had a blow out the baby and his pajamas or whenever, and nanny goes to put it in our washing machine. I go, don't you fucking do that? I got this from old navy for four 99 I can afford another form if fuck you don't, don't put it in my washing machine here. Has the kid has better intuition about mom's nonsense here. First came up with like the kids, a little skeptical and once I got used to it and to me it's something solid on your hand.

Speaker 6:          01:51:46       The paper stuff,

Speaker 12:         01:51:49       the shit that's on your hand, that solid chest. He had good. He goes, this is kind of dirty, right?

Speaker 6:          01:52:00       It's clean. It's

Speaker 12:         01:52:02       okay, so she's trying to clean. He's like, this is staying with Kaka Mommy, and she was like, no, no, no. This is clean. Oh my God, you use that? Mommy said it's okay. This is my favorite one. For some reason. I really liked that lady. Oh, you know what's another one? I really don't understand the extreme couponers they spend 10 15 hours a day cutting the coupon, putting the coupon into folder binders, and then taking it to the store. It's like for that, that's a part time jobs. Ridiculous. Yeah. Just figure out a job that you can earn more money instead of trying to find a way to not spend money. You know what I mean? It's sort of course. Yes. You know they don't have a job. You're doing a job like the guy, like there's this guy that is outside the rite aid near my house and he's always like, he's always asking for it.

Speaker 12:         01:52:50       He's a, he's like a like a like kind of handsome black dude, you know? He's like maybe 25 or something. Who knows? It could be 65 your number now. But um, he's like holding a cup out. I didn't go or just, or just not cup. He goes, hey, it's like hard times. Can you give him? I'm like, do you want me to give you an application? Because me handing your money is exactly the same job. Like no offense to people that work at write it, but it was like, dude, I think you can probably get a job here probably. Yeah. Yeah. Like I could get you like what do you want if you're standing out there all that time and it's hard. It's weird. And everyone, the woman that worked there was like, yeah, what the fuck dude. I yeah. Also it's hard for me to make money course back in the day. You mentioned you are always forcing your boyfriends to kiss boys. Yes. Boys. Did you ever get into other kinky like in a kink stuff or no? Um, I like to be jerked off in front of just getting a diver. You kink of the air? Um,

Speaker 17:         01:53:44       oh.

Speaker 12:         01:53:47       I think I was just like kind of down for whatever. Okay. Or were you down for this?

Speaker 11:         01:53:53       Imagine if the easiest way to delight your wife. She just drove all across room relationships. Wouldn't tell me

Speaker 12:         01:54:06       I'm feeling that tails getting fucked. I feel physically ill with the pup play. Yeah. It makes me very uncomfortable inside. I liked the original kiwi pup play, the deceitful one. They're like, this is not sexual, just a bunch of men wearing leather and math. And then we found his other channels where he was like inserting mass down there. Yeah. Is that a butt plug tail? This one probably wasn't as, so when it's all dudes, it definitely is what it's dudes. They're like leather. Like get on the table that the vet needs to inspect you and then yeah, there's, I went to a leather vest and silver lake, um, maybe 10 years ago. Yeah. Leather daddies. And they were the, they have assless chaps. Yeah. And um, which I've never seen asphalt chops to be honest, but with butt plugs that look like towels. And then there was a guy that was, had a booth that people could come up to and they would zip you up in a body bag and just your balls about it and he would whip your balls and people were like, there was a line around the fucking bottom line.

Speaker 12:         01:55:07       Can I tell you what that is? That was San Francisco in the late night and that was, so that was the weekend. That was a good time back in that city. You were there for like the real, the height of Gay Shit, man. There were dudes just butt fucking in the streets back then. It was awesome. I think if this women's movement knew a little bit more about like dom shit, like they'd be happier. Like yeah, you can like whip. There's dude you can find that will let you whip their balls will actually ask you to, maybe they don't want to do it. I can do that. I would do that for money if I weren't married. It was, I guess I love no, if you, if I loved it. No, I think here's what I would do. Anyone tolerates that level of pain. It's gotta be, there's gotta be such a more inward pain they're trying to hide.

Speaker 12:         01:55:50       Oh, that's an interesting, I mean, I'm like, that's interesting. Like shit, trying to mask the inner pain inside. That's how much worse the pain is on that. It's interesting that your balls whipped, but I mean, I'm saying there's a physical pain. It changes obviously from person to person, but for a lot of guys, wear anything aggressive there will physically make you collapse, like nauseous. Right? Absolutely. I know, and when people say to me, don't you feel resentful that you have to carry the baby for nine months and then pushed the baby out and then breastfeed the baby? And I go, no, because then two and a half years when that little boy is running around, he's going to kick daddy right in the nuts and it's called payback because I loud every time was actually trained them to do it. We have lessons. He's homeschooled and kicking down the balls.

Speaker 12:         01:56:37       Oh, you've won all these ribbons at dog shows, but they rarely ask. If I'm the oh boy. Quite a few that's rude to go into it to try to win as a human. It's not fair. It's like Oscar Pistorius with a fake legs. A little bit of an advantage. Don't name is Tony and I'm a human pup. I'm Tony's husband and trainer. Oh, that's a twist. That's quite a twist and they have real dogs are not neuter involved. Even though it was balls with my entire life. A lot of kids like to play. Pretend they like to pretend to be, but I really fuck them. They enjoy doing it. I just never grew out of that pet play through Tony. Once we start dating or is it common? Who's Tony? Tony's on the left. She is glad to do it. I say when the student is ready, the master appears.

Speaker 12:         01:57:26       Oh boy. These two are a match made in heaven. Doggy heaven. All dogs go to heaven. They're dogs are super cute. I feel bad for them now. What's Your Pronoun? They're like, they go to Costco to get peanut butter. I bought Tony. Definitely. He she's observes aspects of to mind that relate to BDSM or kink or leather? No, it involves gear that is restrictive or restraining. For example, leashes, harnesses, myths on your hands. You know what I don't like? I don't like how put together they are. I like having my pup play psychos to really be out on the edge. I don't like, I don't like an articulate explanation actually don't like that. It's like half shaved head. Like I want you to look proper. Like I want this to be more of a twist. I want you to be like, like Harvard educated. Yeah. I like to be caught off guard more. Or just, I like when they're like the fakeness of like, this is just fun. Kiwis and out with the guys and then there's just like fucking, do you want to like the Obamas to be doing that? To try to have like a broader audience? Like they're pretending like they were like, we want the Christians like as too, they just want, they don't want to come off as weird. Right. It's

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       legitimizing it. Right. Oh, we have these harnesses

Speaker 18:         01:58:45       slowly is similar to the responsibility with a regular dog. I have to groom the dogs and my wife's hair, that's pretty, I have regular dog. I'm just different. Okay. Okay. He's like, we have bio dogs and I do train them barking, but you know, if you want to make a big stink that's you're an adult human, you could do you want it?

Speaker 4:          01:59:06       Okay.

Speaker 12:         01:59:07       So that there was pretty, cause she, she took offense to the fact that he was like, you know, we have like real dog. She's like, I am a funny, can I hear that again please? Yeah, that was pretty great. That was perfect.

Speaker 18:         01:59:15       Great. Hi. Responsibility is similar to the responsibility with a regular dog. The first expert.

Speaker 4:          01:59:24       I'm a regular dog. Just different. Okay. She is rough bio dog. Have you been a horse trainer?

Speaker 12:         01:59:35       A harsh chair since 2009 we can I just say, can you pause it for a second? Sure. Because before we even get into this bitch, um, she's a cha. Okay. So what annoys me about that is like if you want to be like a weird dog badge, be a dog badge, but don't, don't be precious about how your dog bitch. Yeah, you are weird. That is weird. Okay. And tout that you're weird and you found a fucking husband who's like totally down. I fucking do your gratitude list in the morning, bitch. All right. You can write it with a little pause and don't, but don't like correct. I'm like, he's offended you like, it's not like he has to accommodate you more than he already has. He has. You're eating out of a fucking dog ball batch, like a, come on. He said regular dog and you're supposed to say buy a real dogs. Don't do that. Real dogs don't go like far. Far fewer like disrespecting my pronouns. No, she's out of

Speaker 4:          02:00:27       Annie. Do some role play. Be like you're my bio dog. Tell Tom you're, I mean you're my regular dog. You're just a regular dog. It's bio.

Speaker 12:         02:00:40       Wow, I love this and that's the day I love this safe space. Do you remember that guy? Please explore please. We need to hear this Mumbo jumbo. This is this and critter club is to provide a safe space for people to explore. We engage in pet play. People don't realize that safe spaces inside yourself that is the same. It's really like you have to just accept herself and not worry about other people because you have no control over how their people treat you. You'll literally have no, all you can do is set up boundaries and people either cross number don't and then you have them in your life or you don't like, it's what is happening right now. Yeah, it's all victim culture. It's a, yeah, it's, I have to change the external world. You have no, it's like people have not, I've used that real shit happens.

Speaker 12:         02:01:32       So it's like, think it goes up around your house broken into or whatever. I feel like being like fucking raped or having like your house broken into. It's like these things that happen where you're like, you realize like your walls are not their fault. It's like this barrier is like not real. Right? So you just have to be, you have to be your walls. Like you have to try your best to like protect yourself and you can't just like, it's just, it's just, it makes me crazy, crazy, real wisdom. It's fucking the, I just can't believe this shit. It's like, I don't give a fuck about your dog shit, but I'm allowed to make fun of you. I'm sorry. Yeah, of course. We're going to be weird. If you're going to put it out there like you're saying. Yeah, and you can make fun of me, mother fucker.

Speaker 12:         02:02:10       I'm not saying you came in front of me. It's like who wasn't made fun of. It's so important to me. Made Fun of like, especially as comics, like I mean, come on, we all got dragged, dragged and it's like you learn how to get through it worse. But no, you have to go to a safe space and do your pony play. But I'm going through something. It's like, yeah, so it was Roseanne Bitch. Like what the fuck? Like and you can't everyone so hypocritical. Oh yeah. If you want. Okay, fine. Then we have to be like, feel bad for everyone. Everybody. Everybody's a front. If they voted for Trump,

Speaker 11:         02:02:38       don't feel bad for them. Quintessential head play gear, his tail and hood. Everything else is extra. Okay, so let's do tail. Oh, that's not extra. Okay. The tells that extra for me. The reason that I like to be a dog, his dog is man's best friend. Dogs experience the world through a lens of pure joy. I ever seen someone that cynical as am more maybe dolphins, but I feel like that pet play would be much harder. It's all I trained off late pony and critter club is kind of Ooh, head play dress up like that style. There's no sex involved. I don't think sexually sexual. I do think that to an extent is is for Roddick because it is intimate.

Speaker 12:         02:03:17       I'm sorry it's not sexual. He's wearing fucking pleather from head to toe of course. And it's all harnessed and belts all snug on drafts. No, it's totally something. I put a fake tail in my asshole, but it's not sexual. It's like you guys pretending that you weren't going to fucking put that bottle right up. Tom's that what bothers me too. Along what you were saying. Uh, the safe space and then the need to, you know, everybody's different and we have to honor what they're doing. It's like, no you don't. You can talk shit about like, this is ridiculous. It's remember when you could just call crazy shit crazy. Yeah. Now it's, you're considered crazy shaming. Craziest like the most fun thing to point and laugh at because what keeps you feeling like when you're making fun of someone, you're fucking including the thing. It's like I'm trying to get on a level where I can relate to you because what you're doing is fucking crazy. If I wasn't making fun of you, I would be judging you. Right. Do you understand? If I was just silently sitting there and going like this, I would be repressing every thought I had about how fucking nuts it is. Yeah. Or I can try to make the rim left. Bust your balls and then map it out. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         02:04:28       I consider myself, I thought you died. I got excited. That being said, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I didn't hear it. What is she saying? Yeah. I consider myself out. I'm very open. That being said, I do compartmentalize my pet play because not everyone wants or needs to see that families. First thing she said, yeah, I think they have a general idea that I'm to deposit, but you don't talk about it. They know.

Speaker 12:         02:04:55       She talked about it like she was considering going to thanksgiving dressed up like that, so I like, yeah, I mean I guess this is one of our big points on these people all the time. A lot of times the people insist on everybody knowing what makes them come and it's like you don't have to tell everybody and she actually, I'll give her credit, keeps it to herself that like this is her. I mean keeps she's off, but at least she's not. She's like saying like, I don't tell dad and does it a joggy mentoring guys. I'm a comedian. It is a documentary, which that I applaud like just keep it to yourself if you're going to be weird, just do it behind closed doors. Why does everybody have to celebrate everything you're fucking doing? How annoying is that as someone with a narcissistic mother, how annoying is that?

Speaker 12:         02:05:41       If your owner is like taking the toy, you're like, Yo, can I get the toy? You went to pet smart and came back with nothing for me. Just for yourself. This is a nasty or stealing your dogs. Then I will say, if anybody is meant to be a dog, it's that broad. Right? Yeah. She fucking looks like a human dog. She does. She cut her hair like a dog and she's very ruthless. Um, she's a doll. She's fantastic. I almost want to, we got to watch those again because I feel like I didn't fully get the essence, like I need to soak it in. You haven't gotten, I need to take a second pass. I was like, I've got to soak, if you know what I mean. I didn't get wet enough. Right. I'm really, and I haven't come yet. We have to watch it again.

Speaker 12:         02:06:27       But there are some videos on this show that you take one pass and you're like, that was weird. And then I think about them for a week and then I'm like, we got this. We got to do guys ever. Are you ever like, we've got to try that? No, just mock them endlessly. Any where can people see you coming up? Um, oh, I just have my date up and I forgot and he's a great comic. You need to go see her live. She's Ah, often at the store, one of the few ladies that's allowed to perform that very funny lady. It's hard. I had to, you know, complained. I complained a lot online and then they finally passed me. Yeah. That's the way to do it. I did not go into the line and, no, no, you just have to complain about stuff. Right. You have to be a victim. It's crazy. Um, let me look up the state. Go see comedienne. Uh, and can I tell you my finish my Brian's story? Yeah. Oh yeah. So I go on a date with, and you know, like everyone's a liar and everything, but I thought they lie about like height and stuff. This guy, um, cropped out, he had a like a lobster claw hand cause like a deformed hand and like, I don't care.

Speaker 13:         02:07:36       I was a special ed teacher. I'm cool. But like it was um, it was just so surprising and we never talked about it. And then he took me into a lobster restaurant he did with his lobster. Yeah. That's nice that we didn't talk about it. No, it was totally random and I was like, cause I was like, I don't want to do a bit about it. I talked about it on stage but it's like, but I, I didn't want to, I was like, I'm not going to talk about this on stage. Do they tend to labs? The restaurant. But then once he took him to the labs restaurant, I was like done deal. Sorry Bro. But it was wild. I'm like just hope like, cause I would always make sure he could tell it in a big boobs and stuff. Like I never wanted to have the moment of like discipline.

Speaker 13:         02:08:09       I just never like if I'm not your type, you're not mine. So it's like I'm not going to like go on a date with someone and then show up and you're like look different than your picture. Yeah. Wait, but this is a famous person with a lobster, you know, he was like, I don't, he like had a picture of one direction. I'm trying to think of famous people with lobster claw. No, no, no, no, he's not. He's just, he was a nice guy. It was just like, and I wouldn't have it just once I saw that, I was like, yeah, that's weird man. Just show your thing.
