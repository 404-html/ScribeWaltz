Why does it make sense? Uh, that was an old school one. That's a super old school man. No, no. I'm here. The man now dog. Possibly the lamest, lamest line ever in a movie. Well, yeah, if that's the word. That's right. That is Sean Connery. Tell him the black kid that he's like mentoring or something. It's got to be a writer and it's like that the moment of triumph where all of his lessons have come through, you know? And it's like montage. Yeah. And then he did it and he's like, you're the man now dog. Can we stop making those movies where white people turn around in the lives of black kids? I would actually like to see you ride.

Speaker 4:          00:04:49       Really go for it. Now. Like in today's world, like really do one that's so on the nose that we can all mock it and I need more directly. There's a movie now on Netflix, I'm itching to watch. It's on my list. Is it that genre? Well it's a reverse of that. So it's the black girl teaching the white girls how to be saucier. Oh that's also such a blade out. So lame. Yeah. So it's a step, you know that they, it's like step stuff, whatever. And she's going to teach the white girls how to step Ah, was called like stepsister. Oh, is that kind of like a like what's going on with the fuck? You don't know. Stop stomping the yard. Yeah. It's a stomp in the, uh, what they do in man, she's just stomp on the gas stop in the yard, but she's gonna, she's gonna teach them how to be more flavorful color. And the best is that on those trailers, they're like, stop in the yard. They always have the guy that can't say it. Say why this person doing the voiceover? So embarrassing. It is so embarrassed. They stopping the yard this spring.

Speaker 4:          00:05:54       Lace up your sneakers, get ready to stomp a little harder. Yeah. That's horrible. I've never seen a step crew or whatever. Have you seen this? But I'm confused. It's a real thing though. Yeah. A step crew. Oh, California. I'm just never, have you seen a step approval for an urban step crew? MMM. It's wondering if it's real or cringeworthy stuff is like, um, is that, is that like, I'm going to teach you how to be from the hood and you teach me how to hang out with white people and like member, that's like, first of all, it's been done a lot already. Like had like 10 of those movies. Right. But then a few years ago, Steve Martin, who's pretty highly regarded and respected in comedy, like he's kind of for a lot of people on the Mount Rushmore of, you know, comedic minds. Yes. He did one of those with Queen Latifa.

Speaker 4:          00:06:51       Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I saw that one in the, in the trailer. He ends up in like a bboy pose and he was like, what's up? What's happening girl? And he's like, and she doesn't think like now, now you get it. Yeah, that's right. And then he's like, Yo, Yo Yo, I mean you go like this fucking turd cracker who's like, I can see blacks dance. I get it. Sure. Cultural differences or funny. Oh my God. I mean, I mean in the 70s and the 80s that was kind of a new thing, you know, like Ed was it Eddie Murphy doing a Beverly hills cop and he then he had a white, yeah, yeah, buddy cops that, that was funny and I was a little less on the tailpipe, that whole thing. It was pretty funny to make fun of white people is always funny. That's true. But like, I dunno the way that was done, like there's, there's nuance to jokes, you know what I mean? Like that's the only thing you have to make the characters people, right? Not just staring, just characters, you know. So that's the thing is that that was done really like, you believe that white guy was that white guy and Eddie Murphy was kinda being himself and Eddie Murphy had all the carts. He actually, he had the power because he was the funny guy. Yeah. Genuinely funny too. They weren't like, and then just smack these crackers around.

Speaker 4:          00:08:16       But I do love those step cruise man. You know, I watched bringing on every item that's cheerlead. You know what you would love. I love the clovers. I can watch those clovers take a shit on. Or you should even just youtube this historically black university marching bands. Oh, they are so amazing. I'm talking like Grambling, you know, uh, what does it McNeese state like I'm talking to southern Hellman, uh, Hellman. Isn't that where cast weekends went? Oh, that's where different. Where like Morehouse, I'm telling you that historically black universities that have marching bands will blow your mind. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I, we got to go watch some, I'm saying the whole presentation from the uniforms cause it's always like crisp, clean. I mean it's like a military style uniforms and the coordination of the movements and the music it and like it's, well what about the blackness Tom?

Speaker 4:          00:09:10       It's super black. That's what I'm saying now there they're already there. Yeah. And then like sewing, like usually every one of those performances we'll begin with like a black person go and then you're like, that means like pay attention and then they'll like, they'll do a snap and then the show will start. Yeah, it's called right. Be Some clovers and the APP. Anyways, I don't know how we got on sidetracked on this. Um, are we talking about Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. You, uh, well you've had aids and you're getting out of that. I, this is like the only time you guys don't know. But like I live with aids and have, for years I've been fighting it. I take my meds and I always had a sinus infection and cold the fucking flu. And like for years I'm sitting here living with you. And I would go through these horrible sicknesses that would last five, seven, 10 days.

Speaker 4:          00:10:12       And you'd be like, to me like, yeah, no, I don't know, but I didn't get it. And then the next year I get sick four times. And you'd be like, yeah, I didn't get sick this year. And then the next year I get six, six times and you'd be fine. You know why? It's my Goddamn cockroach. Cockroach. Cause my eastern bloc genetics, I can, I've survived the communism. I've survived World War Two because my genetics are superior. My immune system is superior to the average American. I don't doubt it. Now the problem is I'm pregnant and so I've got, my immune system is lowered from pregnancy. So it just took me down. I'd never, I have a laid in bed sick, but a decade. When's the last time you ever see me laid out? But the good news is I got into this Korean soap opera and Netflix. Uh, I think it's a poor translation of the title or just lazy translation.

Speaker 4:          00:11:03       They do that. They do that both ways. Yeah. Why be so, like, why not really try to think, excuse me about the title. I know there they'll do things like, I dunno, there'll be like a, what's a big action movie here? You know, it'd be like some like taken. Yeah. But like in, um, uh, in Korea when they release it there, they'll, they'll call it like he's had enough, you know, like they give it like these, because words don't have the same impact. What's this Korean show called? Well, it's shittily translated to, hello my twenties, and I was looking for some light bullshit. I'm so fascinated by Korean culture because when I was in Seoul like 10 years ago, I would watch their TV and I wish I can understand what these people were talking about because it's so dramatic and they're so beautiful. They're such beautiful people and always frustrated me. And I finally have access now at subtitled and I'm hooked. I'm halfway through it and it's a dark show. It's actually very dark and very complicated. And very cool.

Speaker 4:          00:12:15       God, I would give anything for this to stop right now. Oh, he telling me, Oh, it's the worst. I hate. It's annoying. Yeah. People don't want to hear it. Nobody wants to stop it. Thanks. Now you are also into my Tele Novella. My abuelita watches her tele novella before bed. I got, I mean, I blame Diaz and I'll tell you, I, you know, anything did Joey Diaz tells you you're like, yeah, okay buddy. Like you know, you're out of your mind, right. He um, he was telling me when I, when I saw him last, he was like, you know, we're talking about different shows and how much I love narcos. And he was like, Oh, you have to watch the show hot, the hotter. And so what is Ho to hoe to me, Jj, so the letters in Spanish. So I'm like, what, what is he talking about?

Speaker 4:          00:13:06       So just out of curiosity, a few weeks ago, I, uh, I pull up this show. I see it, I think, I don't know if it was like a new release that time. It's called Soco. UBN though Escobar alias with the hotel. Which means surviving Escobar. So I'm like, and I've been on this Escobar, um, you know, rabbit hole as have a lot because every, every time I pull up Netflix there's like a new show about them. So yeah. Cause I pull up your profile and it's like Escobar, Escobar, murder, murder, drugs, murder. Yeah. It's the whole thing. And they have a new series, a new series just came out about, uh, uh, drug, uh, you know, cartels and more documentary style though. So anyways, I pulled up his show and it's a Colombian show. It's a series. I pull it up, I watched the first episode, I get roped in and it's about, um, Escobar's righthand man has hit man Popeye.

Speaker 4:          00:14:00       That was the is the guy's nickname I love on gangsters. Have cool names, pop by baby name. Kinda think papa. He personally killed like 300 people. That's it. So he's a mass murderer. He's free now, by the way. He's of course he did his time. So weird. Like we get, so in this country you associate your experiences like certain crimes aligned with certain punishment and then like you start going around the world. It's like sometimes in countries like look, this guy murdered a guy, he did his five years though and like he's like all right, the value of life is significantly changes diminished is he? Where is it Columbia, he's Colombian and give a fuck about life there. But the series is so good because it basically picks up at the end like the last day or two that is alive and he and Pop I part ways Escobar tells him he's his right hand hit hitman.

Speaker 4:          00:14:54       Like I know this is coming to an end and they say no, just the feds are close. Yeah, yeah. The search bloc is, is, is, is closing in and all his guys are dying and it, it's just not, he knows it's so he tells Popeye like go ahead. Like you're, you've been invaluable to me and basically go for it and cause Popeye's. Like I'm going to turn myself in. Like, I know that I'm either, I'm going to be killed, they're going to keep searching for me, so I'm just going to go, go for it. So he turns himself in and the series starts with him basically arriving in prison. God Damn, now I have to watch this thing. Yeah, but here's the mini episodes behind you then becomes the most unbelievable story of him turning himself into a crime boss from prison. Of course the dramas in this prison of the different cause.

Speaker 4:          00:15:47       There's like the paramilitaries and there's the gorillas and there's the narcos and they each are unsafe, separate sides. And they each have, you know, different storylines of trying to get each other. And then there's romance and there's relationship anyways. You know, sometimes when you start a series on Netflix, he started watching it and you're like six, seven in and sometimes you're like, Ooh, like how many do we have left? Like we were watching Ozark. You're like, how many are left because you want it to be longer and you'll check and there's nine let's say, or a 10 and then relief washes over you. He's a relief. No, there's enough. Yeah. Or like, or you go like, Oh shit, that sucks that this is about to end. So I'm like, episode seven of this show. I'm like, this is good. I wonder how many are left?

Speaker 4:          00:16:31       I back out of more episodes. 60 what are you fucking talking about? How many seasons today? It's considered one season. It's just the way that they have have it uploaded on Netflix. I th I think what happened is this is a, an original, like a Colombian series and that's what I think. I didn't, I didn't, so I think it aired there over however long and then they bought it, licensed it for whatever reason, they just call it one season. So it's 60 I'm, I'm 32 episodes. I'm wondering how long have, well, Lisa is going to be watching her shows because every night I sleep and I'm going to get super depressed because I know that if it's 60 that's the series, you know, it's 60 episodes. It's not like they're gonna be like, next season we'll have 60 more episodes. It's gotta be the, you're done. Yeah. But I'm super into admin and I wake up every now and then and I look and there's the ugliest motherfuckers on that show too. Shit. This fucker's on TV. Yeah. Uh, yeah. Well, it's exciting. You know, the problem with my Korean show is these bitches are always eating this delicious Korean food. I cannot believe you on this. She's watching this Korean show and then every day it's Soondubu Bulgogi

Speaker 3:          00:17:51       eating all this shit for days. And I'm like, are you serious? She was like, well, I was watching it. So because they have good food, they have the real stuff. Yeah. The Kimchi and the, the noodle soup. Oh, I love it all. Kalbi I see them eating and then I want to eat the same shit. Fuck. Speaking of Netflix, uh, the reviews are in. Yeah. Yeah. And disgraceful. Yeah. Hundred percent. Everybody loves it. You're kidding. Well, congratulations. That's really hard when everybody's on board. I've never had something where it's only love. Unanimous. It's unanimous fans. Yeah. It's pretty exciting. Well, I'm so glad to hear that. Yeah. I've never had anything like it where everybody, everybody likes it. Everybody. There's not one person left out. Well that's wonderful. That's kind of the goal of a good comedy show, I think it sure is. Well, listen, if you're a comedian, you gotta be able to entertain everybody at all times. You don't want to upset people or a polarized or fed. Let make anybody feel bad that this guy's show. I mean, my show, that's what I usually begin my shows by going like, I hope each and every one of you has a great time and I hope each and every one of you leaves here feeling good about everything. Yeah. That's kind of how I do it. You know? I was thinking today, are there any topics that nobody can take offense to? Like even think so, but let's say

Speaker 6:          00:19:24       going into our five o'clock hour, it's going to be a lively conversation. I expect we are going to be talking about Tom Seger. Huh? That's a radio show. Yeah, he is a standup comedian and on a recent Netflix a show, he did some jokes and he did some stand up about specifically here in Lafayette, Louisiana as a whole, any Cajuns. And so it's pretty Bulger. He has some vulgarity in there, but you don't stand up comedy. It's vulgar. Uh, and there's been a lot of people watching this video. A lot of comments about it. A lot of people very angry, very offended, very upset because he really goes after Cajun.

Speaker 3:          00:20:12       I never thought this would be a thing really like of all the topics you cover, isn't it surprising the ones that kind of catch

Speaker 4:          00:20:22       dude, I'm beat. I did. By the way. I heard somebody talk about, um, I think it was on the show. I got sent the link that like this guy was on there being like, oh yeah. Um, I know, I know that he's talking about a specific guy he met in Louisiana. I'm like, what? Like I met a guy in Louisiana. No, I met a guy from Louisiana in Kansas City in the first, like during the first week of 2017 last year. If you were in Kansas City and you came to one of those shows? I did. I'm, there was a guy in the meet and greet. No. Okay. And that's what I say. I mean, I don't say Kansas City in a special, but I say like I was on my first week of this tour is where I met this guy. Yeah. I just thought it was weird that some, somebody like he met a guy here.

Speaker 4:          00:21:13       I'm like, that wasn't even, why would that even register? I'd be there anyways. Um, uh, I think it's funny, like the backlash of like people from Louisiana being like, I mean, first of all, I have to say, I've never gotten so much fan mail in my life ever for anything like a half for this special. Like I've been bombarded with this, you know, just amazing fandom and, and support and people telling me that they love the special, which I tell you, it never gets old. Like I totally, I, I can't tell you how much it's crazy how much it has come in. Um, and I've gotten a lot of it from Louisiana, so I don't want to make this sound like only people from Louisiana are upset because a lot of them are like, I live in Louisiana. I love the bit, you know, like they, they've been very supportive of it, but people, the ones who don't get it or who don't like it, it's like, you know, this is a joke, right? No, it's not a Joe. I feel like there's so many people out there that are, I dunno, they, I think they're taking, it's like they're holding people on like what they're saying on stage as equal to what you would say offstage. But you know, that's the same thing, right?

Speaker 3:          00:22:33       Well, I think there's a thing called context, right? Yeah. So if you're going to a comedy show and you're all agreeing in this social contract, then what we're going to have in the room is called fun. And it's not meant to be taken literally or seriously in context. It's called a joke, I believe, unless you were giving a lecture on, you know, geography or one of my favorite parts of it.

Speaker 4:          00:22:56       This is, these guys are going to discuss this thing for like a while. But then this is one of the comments I have to say,

Speaker 6:          00:23:03       uh, when I heard it the first time I was a little oh wow. Man, that's pretty, that's pretty rough. Yeah. But it is funny. It is funny. It is funny material. It's just that we are the, the target of that.com. Oh, okay. So a lot of people don't like that.

Speaker 4:          00:23:24       Yeah. I mean that's, that's how jokes work out.

Speaker 3:          00:23:27       Well, you know, every joke has a victim and I feel like you can get upset. You know, you tell jokes about cats in the cat. People get mad. Yeah. Told you about the dog dog. People get mad.

Speaker 4:          00:23:38       Just so you know, a couple things I'd like to point out a, um, the joke, did I tell that it's, you know, has Cajuns in it basically ends with my saying that we should build a wall. Uh, if it's around the state of Louisiana, um, and, uh, we have a build a wall shirt. It's build a wall shirt and um, the wall is in the shape of Louisiana. Very nice. That is item number one. You can go to the store. I'm offended. Um, they're using bricks then that wall. Yeah, my cousin was a brick. And here is the other piece of news that I'm super excited to announce. I didn't say it at the beginning of the show, but I'd like to say it now.

Speaker 2:          00:24:28       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:24:38       to show you how much love I have for the state of Louisiana. I took the very first available date going to the civic theatre in New Orleans Saturday, September 29th. Oh, uh, the, the tickets are on presale today, the 24th of, um, of January, beginning at 10:00 AM is when the presale starts. Um, so you can get tickets to that. There is a code word if you're, if you're participating in the presale and the code word is Cajun. See a j u n perfect Cajun is the code word. If you want to get tickets. Again, I'm coming to New Orleans Saturday, September 29th. It was the first available Saturday at the civic theater this year for us. So it should be very interesting show. I'm very excited to be going. I just wanted to let you guys know that. Um, and again, I can't thank you guys enough for watching this special.

Speaker 4:          00:25:39       I really appreciate it. And I know that, um, you know, it's, I've been getting a lot of back and forth how it's always, how this works. These things trigger other things. People watched the special and then they have watching your special, cause I keep getting messages about your special really. I've been getting so many complimentary texts from our friends and family and Twitter messages about how fantastic yours is. So I'm, I'm really happy and, uh, I, I just, I wish you would just tell jokes it didn't hurt people's feelings. I know. Can we make a list of approved subject matter? Well, yeah. I mean, can we do a consensus of, of what's a okay. O'Hare talking about it's a bull here. I don't want to hurt feelings anymore. Um, grapes. Grapes. That's good. Remember yesterday we had, there was grapes in that, like the lunch for a Lj. Yeah. Who would say, oh no, no one will take offense to that. I don't think so. Right. Yeah. Fruits. Let's see. What about wine makers? Uh, there are probably going to get upset about cause you stopped grapes. Yeah. Oh that's true. That's hurtful to the grapes were not taking grapes feelings into consideration. That's true. Whether that doesn't seem to agitate

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       people. Hm. What if you live in a bad weather area? Then you're like, why are you boasting about how good your weather is as what I always hear from people that live in shitty places. When I tell them I live in California and they're like, I fucking hate Los Angeles. And I'm like, but the weather's great. And they're like, so I live in this shitty place and we have shitty weather, but I like it more. You know what I mean? Like it kind of, I feel like it gets people in a bad mood. Now I'm going to, I, you know what I'm gonna do for your next special, I'm just to help you here is I'm going to start making a list of preapproved topics that everybody can get onboard with. I liked that a lot and that way people don't ever get mad. Yeah. All right.

Speaker 3:          00:27:20       I know. I know from experience that cyclists get very mad, I think. I think you're right. I remember that was one of the first times, um, you'd ever received hatred. Significant amounts is, it's so funny cause you really can't predict what will set people off. No, you really don't because let's be honest, we both have said pretty inflammatory shit about lots of other people and both of our specials and yeah, it's always surprising. It's always surprising when you're like, you know there's a comedy show, right? I Dunno actually. I feel like most people do understand that most to what happens is the people that are upset are very vocal. So yeah, they're so angry. They're so emotional that they like the person that loves your show usually will message you. I love the show. They don't then, right. Like eight more messages to better, you know.

Speaker 3:          00:28:11       Well and I also think that people have always been offended and upset, but now because of social media, they are given a platform to kind of Bob together mentality. Yeah. And it's just, it takes on a bit of a life more so than it could 10 years ago, 20 years. When you have a mob, they'll also like not actually, uh, watch the thing or they're not reacting, reacting to a, like a story that they heard about. I heard that you talked about, yeah. You're like, you're not even paying it. You're not even going to give it its due diligence. Yeah, no. Yeah. They just feel it. I've heard enough. I got, I got messages like, you know, I don't need a watch it, I've heard enough about it. Okay. People got mental problems. He got it. You got to get your life. Get your ass in a therapy. Let's talk about something. Don't worry about it.

Speaker 5:          00:29:01       Oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:29:18       What do you think of that? Well, that's kind of a good message. It's kind of what the self help movement is all about. If you're going to give a blow job and you're not cool with yourself, you'd feel probably really depressed. As you're doing that. How are you going to love that come if you can't love your own comp lit. That's way more than I was thinking. What's up? What's, what's even the ball's lately. You seem to be on a ball thing. I mean, I just opened the folder here. Oh, it's blue bands on a ball. The ball's right. Send it to him. He's to get in his balls attached and licked and stuff. Yeah, maybe he is.

Speaker 5:          00:29:51       Yeah. Bird balls.

Speaker 3:          00:30:26       That's true. Yeah. I don't know how people have indiscriminate sex or licking indiscriminate Coxson balls. Like a lot of people do that. Like a lot of girls will opt to give a blow job. Oh, you have to be like, I don't, I don't give it up on the first day. That's a good one. That's one of my parents is like, Hey, I'm not easy and you're just going to get in my pants. I was sucking on your balls though because to me that's way more intimate. I know intercourse. Like I've heard this, what are you doing? I've heard this from you and other people that graduated college that, uh, that, that's a pretty intimate thing to do. So yeah, put your mouse on someone's genitals is, is, I mean, that's their everything, you know.

Speaker 5:          00:31:13       Thanks. You give us a demonstration. Who she fucking 12. We know this.

Speaker 3:          00:31:28       Here's the thing. Who's saying bite my ball? Nobody. Here's the thing. You know, bite fucking balls, man. Sniff, sniff. Let me put it right. Bat your eyelashes and no one buys. No one says bite my balls. But this is so fucking seventh grade. Of course it is. We covered this shit in junior high brow. Like, you know what I'm saying? Like welcome to this podcast. Are you talking about, I'm saying that girls have been talking to each other about this shit since like seventh or eighth grade. So like bitch, you're too old to be like making these videos. You can fucking cover this and junior high, the finger banging and you know, maybe she's, maybe she's just like really good at this and people keep their jam. Like maybe like how about every guy she hooks up with is like, you gotta make a youtube tutorial because he's so good. I need, I need other girls to find out about how good you are at this. Again, she can just be like, remember the grapefruit lady? Uh Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Got It. Great for your man. Stupid show Dick. Between your legs out Dick, between your legs and stomp the yard.

Speaker 5:          00:32:39       Want to take

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       them shot here. I'm just focused on for today. Oh, ah. It's actually an ad for her to get laid. Yeah. She's welcoming customers. Her inbox when, when this, you know what I mean? Like if you're, if you're putting that out there, this is what, this is one thing that I'm annoyed by as somebody that is not participating in the back and forth of a meeting, people online. This is somebody who will put out a video like this and then their next post will be like, do I have to say that I don't want your sexually suggestive messages in my inbox and you're like, you put out a ball so I can post a video of me sucking on some borrowed like cherries, like balls and how to be about me. It's my form of expression. Look like you want to suck dude's balls. They're soliciting Balsa. They want to get their balls sucked.

Speaker 5:          00:33:39       You're putting in by now too many jewelries, too many bracelets and shit. You know it's not too weird. I mean

Speaker 4:          00:33:49       that's the everybody is, this is what I mean, but I feel like everybody knows how to do that. Like isn't that kind of intuitive? She's not really giving me any new skills. Not Everybody knows how to do that. There's people out there that are definitely washing like, but if you were to suck balls, isn't that fairly? I think she's introducing of that to people. In other words, there's ladies out there who are watching that like, I don't really fuck with bowels, you know? No, I mean going around the world and that really kind of, you know, yeah. You know, there's not, there's not everyone's a triple d slot wife. Hey, we've, how about fun? Is it to call slots, slots? Man, we've been doing this for a long, this is a fun way and you got to do it by the way, don't be like the fun is to do it with your, with your friend.

Speaker 4:          00:34:42       Don't be a jerk and do it loud. But it's for now it's in the car windows up. It's just the two of you. And like a girl walks across the street, maybe a jogger or just like a normal girl in jeans and assured the more normal or like the more professional, the less uh, promiscuous or sexual her attire and look is the better. So when you see a like a pant suit, just executive woman with a briefcase crossing the street, you just go in your car, you go as a slot right here. Total Lily Slutsky sluts walking into work right now. I also like to do it, um, to like, like young teenage girls. I only say that because I can kind of get away with it. They're not, they're not slides by any stretch, but it's funny to be like look of sluts over there walking sluts.

Speaker 4:          00:35:40       I Dunno why it makes me laugh when we do it all the time. We laugh too. Yeah. Get some inappropriate or if they're like, if they are dressed super slutty, then it's funny too if it's on the line or if it's just like a nice looking, but it's like when they're like, if also if it's like two 80 year old women and their slots Taylor sluts, that makes me laugh for me when they're like older, but like when we're in a restaurant and like couple like girls walk in and you're like, oh, it's a couple slots are going to go have dinner right now. That makes me laugh. Well you like it when I say it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It's more, it's funnier when a woman says it. It's one of those things where it's like the origin, the source of the line makes it funnier.

Speaker 4:          00:36:23       Yeah. Contacts. Tom, you know, one of those things, I'm just learning about this like context. Um, I'm learning about like how reading the words isn't the same as like hearing and seeing somebody say, oh yeah, it's all these lessons. It's so fun. I mean, I didn't know that like a certain expression can be said satirically ironically sarcastically. And that then changes sort of the intent and the meaning all of this stuff is, I'm going to comedy camp right now and I'm learning so much. So yes, I do. I do appreciate that. I like to do a Mac when we are in the brown stuff. You'd done it in awhile. Whenever we see a pregnant lady, you know, it'd be like, what's wrong with her belly? She so fat. That always made me laugh too. Oh yeah. One time I posted the uh, a lady on TV who was like seven months pregnant and I wrote like, hey, how come maybe next time don't have like four beers in 1870 [inaudible] before you did television.

Speaker 4:          00:37:25       And all these people were like, she's pregnant, she's so pregnant. You know, she had a small frame. It was so clear that she's pregnant. One of my favorites, another one of my favorite games to play in the car is there's your dad. What's your dad doing? What's your dad doing? Is another good one. Any guy eating out of like a trashcan and he guy with like, you know, six shopping cars, shit fallen off of it. He's barefoot, he's white, but his skin is turned black from walking on the pavement. Black soils. Tell me Your Dad was here once your dad doing here is my dad is a super mean joke because I mean he can't hear it and neither can anybody else, but it's not cool. It's not okay. It's not funny. That's not funny cause someone's feelings could get hurt theoretically. Like if he was in the car with us that we were like, Hey, are you my dad? And he was like, what? Why does milk and ham not taste good together? And we're like, what? Get out of here right near radically. We were having a conversation with, um, a mother yesterday who were acquaintances

Speaker 3:          00:38:35       with over the phone and uh, and she was talking about a nanny. She had with our son and and something. She says something like, you know, I don't teach my children to point and laugh at strangers

Speaker 4:          00:38:49       and both of us, Tom and I looked at each other. We're like, yeah, no, no. Wait, what are you talking about? Yeah. How many? One on one people. That's what you're supposed to do and it's how you get a sense of humor. Definitely. She was like, you know, we don't teach them to look and laugh at somebody for their appearance called funny. I don't understand. What do you teach them? Yeah, isn't it? Like, what do you say when you see someone if you don't point and laugh. All right, what's the point of life now? Our kid yesterday, not like, I don't like, you know somebody like pointing out like at the thrill of seeing a Porsche and I was like, Oh really? Yeah, one of those, aren't they awesome? I thought they were. I liked stuff. Hello stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:39:43       The problem with being a comedian and a mom is that I laugh at a lot of this shit that our kids doing right now and I should be disciplining him. Yesterday we caught him, he got into my red lipstick, like my stage lipstick, like the shit that I wear for 10 hours state like it's really saturated color. Yeah, just dark as red, red fuck all over his hands. And of course ware on our white ass wall.

Speaker 4:          00:40:10       Some for like 30 seconds cause he's at the age now where like, you know you could be in this room and you hear him dragging like an Amazon box through the halls and you're like, all right, that's what he's doing his thing. And then it was quiet for like 10 seconds and then you're like kid over here and I'm like, come on, you have to see this. He was smacking the wall and he was like, do you want me to get the other wall now? And I'm like, Oh yeah, smack, smack, smack. Just so happy.

Speaker 3:          00:40:44       And of course we start, I start laughing and then he's laughing like, Oh God, this is cool. I guess I'll keep doing the other walls. So then he starts to take off to go the other way.

Speaker 4:          00:40:53       I scrubbed the shit out of that though. We got it out. But that's a good woman balls. We got an email. Always eat the scrum. Hold on. Mommy's just an Fyi. You can't spell scrumptious without strong, therefore the scrumptious scrumptious and there was no reason to be afraid of it. Just think of it as a delicacy. Slow cooked in the cock pot all day long. I marinated in all the feral pheromones. Pheromones. You fell in love with Alexandra. Wow. That's a lady who I think is probably Tom. Don't slut shame her. I know, I know. It's a lot. Oh, there was like women marching this week and they know it's a lot of slides. Marching, right name. It was like a slippery. Yeah. Um, I don't know. Hey Hitler on a recent podcast, Christine mentioned meeting, I forgot my different, so for every part of the body I have one bottle of shampoo that I use for everything.

Speaker 4:          00:41:47       Why can't I wash my balls with shampoo and beat me? Kind regards Johnny, because somebody beat me. Uh, first of all, Johnny, I'm 100% on board with you. That shampoo is soap and you don't need, so if you have shampoo, you can watch every part of your body with shampoo. All you need is suds. Uh, it's not different. Nasty. I've survived for years before I met you with just a shampoo bottle, shampoo suds up. Do you do your hair? Do your beard, you do your underarms, you do your, your butthole, you do your crotch. I mean, it does it all. I mean, I bet technically you're right because the detergent is a detergent or soap is a self. However, I think it's more of a text textual thing. Is that the word I'm looking for? Texture, all text, texture. You know what I'm saying? It doesn't feel good and I don't think you should put soap and I mean a shampoo in your vagina because women, we have to, we have to wash, not up inside of our Vaginas, but you got to get in there and I'm thinking that it might burn.

Speaker 4:          00:42:56       It might hurt my badge. So that's kind of like a utility thing, you know? That's true. Um, like a mint shampoo probably wouldn't be good down there. Uh, another, are you still doing that by the way? Shampooing was not. We have soap, so I'll split it up. Yeah. As long as the thing with you is you'll adapt to whatever, whatever's there anyway. I swear if I, if it was fucking 409, I would claim myself with that. It's just whatever's there. So adaptable. Yeah. Uh, an email. Hi, Mommy's, I've been thinking about this theory since I was the brown master of my house in middle school. It seems more and more clear to me that my body gets certainly a weekly brown cycle here. Me Out. So I'm currently a college student. In the past semester I decided to try out my theory every day. I would pick up precise time varying each day of the week, whether I felt I needed to or not to make some chocolate soft serve.

Speaker 4:          00:43:52       Sometimes it would be difficult to hold it in, in some shits for a few hours after taking 10 to 12 Benadryl. But after one or two weeks, my body seemed to have regulated to what I now call the fecal cycle. I have now been able to find tune this weekly cycle to a time that fits my needs. So is he saying he can dictate the Times that he, that he wants to go. You can train, you can train your, your asshole. It's absolutely tribe done it with when I used to work a nine to five so he's as good as anybody to do that. Congrats on little jeans. Two Point Oh yeah, try it out. Piss on me. It'd be nice. Um, yeah, I mean I feel, I guess I know that, I don't know that I dictate it, but I do feel like it happens, it happens at a regular time and then would always fucks me up is you know, travel or schedule, but he's saying you can retrain your duties so that you're like for instance, let's say you start a new job and you want to take a dump before you go to the office, but you're, you've been unemployed for a month, so now you're taking your dumps at like 10:00 AM you can retrain your bowels such that you're shitting at 7:00 AM versus 10:00 AM.

Speaker 4:          00:44:59       But I mean the, the training involves but also just intense training. Well, the training involves also changing your probably your sleep cycle because if you're getting up, if you're shitting at 10:00 AM every day and you're like, I want to be shooting at 8:00 AM, you can't get up at 8:00 AM and do that, you know, you're going to have to like six or something. I mean, you have to make some change. You got to wake up. I, you know, if anyone out there listening is having and struggling with this issue, we both Brown, I would say you brown quicker and earlier than I do every morning. You're like up and you're like, I got to shit. Well, yeah, I mean we go downstairs but within 30 minutes you're 45 you're definitely like, as my body is trained, even just the smell of coffee can induce. That's true. I happens to Brown, but I, I usually shit about an hour after you, I'm telling people I'm trying to get valuable life tomorrow.

Speaker 4:          00:45:48       Tell him, tell him if you want to train your dumps, I recommend you wake up two hours earlier, drink your coffee. Like for those of you who aren't drinking a high powered coffee and then complaining that you can't, shit, we'll get your life, man. You gotta drink high octane coffee. I mean, daddy jeans here. I greatly appreciate my French press that you got me. Yeah. Tell me a review. How do you feel about it? I love it. I love it. I love it. I was intimidated by French Press. Can I tell you how fucking not smart. I am. Well, I didn't know and didn't think to research making my first pot of the French Press. Yeah, he went on intuition. Yeah. I looked at it like, oh, this is obvious. Yeah. So I put all the grinds at the top on top of the press part and then like press out there and I was like, that makes sense.

Speaker 4:          00:46:43       Or like, no, it was like between the, uh, you know, there's like a screen and a and a Ma, whatever. I put it in the wrong place. The first day I made it, I still drank the cup and I was like, was pretty good. Then I was like, I should probably just, it's amazing with Youtube, you just type anything in. I type in the actual brand that you got me and make it. And then like in two minutes I'm like, oh, I was doing it completely wrong. Yeah. But now I make this brown lightning and I drink, uh, like basically one of those crafts. I got a moderate sized one. It's not like a crazy size, but it's uh, it's delicious. And I love the process. I love the ritual of getting those beans out in the morning, grinding them, uh, finding out, you know, what size grind you're supposed to go to for a French press and you know, even the ritual of you're supposed to stir with a plastic spoon because a metal spoon can crack and scratch the glass. I did not, I mean, all these little things, I'm like, I feel like I'm a Barista when I'm doing it. Yeah. That's the whole point. And then, you know, you're waiting for that, the coffee to steep and I don't know, I love trying these different coffee be like what I missed. We were doing the pods, you know, they're very convenient, but I missed that ritual and I miss the smell of the beans and grinding it up. So now I'm buying coffee beans again and I love it. I love it.

Speaker 3:          00:48:12       Originally I was so opposed to the Nespresso machine. But you're hooked on it. Well, because that's what I'm saying. But I loved, I missed the PORTA filter and locking it in and putting the grinds in there nice and fresh. You know, I miss that stuff too. Cause that's, that's a real cup of coffee. Oh yeah. Whatever's, you know. No, I don't have to fucking time for it. I got a kid crying. Yeah. Cooking another one in my belly. And no time to fuck around making coffee gets your life, man. I know it's time for that shit. Do you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 4:          00:48:43       I know there's, um, let's see, there's email, there's looking at the different emails that came in, uh, the infinity wipe no. Solved. Yeah. Tell me how mommies, I've struggled with the infinity wipe all my life. Every once in a while life eaten. Some Moose suit might be whole. Behaves like a dirty bitch. Heres the high and tight solution. Once you've identified that the cleanup is likely to go into infinity, simply flex your pooper as if you were trying to squeeze out a little dingleberry and proceed to wipe when you're, how you say asshole is in the slightly flexed position at hand with toilet paper, toilet paper can reach the hidden Brown and Hitler's, your life will be changed forever. Try it out. Nick from Boston,

Speaker 3:          00:49:34       he's saying if you push push out, basically you're pushing and you wipe that you will get the, the remnants that are

Speaker 4:          00:49:42       causing the anesthetic and he's saying flex that whole push push and then when it's fully flexed, reach back there. Yeah, oof.

Speaker 3:          00:49:52       I don't know the problem with my be whole, it's still got it's tender or from like hemorrhoids from pregnancies. You know what I mean? Like I don't like to get in there. I don't like that. I like the water of the day. You do. That's what helps. Yeah. Or the shower. If you don't have a day. Sure. You can get a fucking Badass on Amazon for like 50 bucks though. Guys are 40 bucks a tushy so great. You got to get one dude's. It's really great. You know, I know everyone loves a squatty potty. I tried it. It's okay. I personally, I think a day is way more.

Speaker 3:          00:50:29       Get one, try it out banner. It's really, it really is the whole, the best thing ever. Um, it's like a fire hose. The tissue one is 60 bucks or something. Yeah, maybe that's right. I mean cheaper ones and you just hook it up to your toilets. Super simple. And then now your whole life is transformed. You're not, I think it's so gross now to mash toilet paper against shit on your skin. It's so fucking gnarly. I know. I go, I got a minute. I, I finished browning now and I just let water run courts. Oh my God. I've been telling everybody about this shit. Do you ever have a poop where you sit down and you're like, that was it. And you're like, there's not going to be anything to talk about. Like I'm going to just go be, I'd be disappointed. And then I looked in the bowl and you think it's going to be a rabbit pellets or something that was so fast?

Speaker 3:          00:51:24       Like nothing came out of me though. That happened to me their day I sat down and after Korean soup and I was like whatever. And I looked down and it was the most gigantic brown. I pro like a one top 10 of my life. And why does that happen? Like sometimes you think it's not going to be brown and then the real big one. Well why did I come out so fast? Like it was so big. Love how you asked like a little kid would ask you asked exactly the way it kindergarten or when I was like, how come I didn't think it was kind of be anything. There was a lot of chocolate in there. But you what? I'm, but you have that too. Of course we are like, it doesn't feel like much. But then I looked in the bowls are amazing, but what is that?

Speaker 3:          00:52:10       The mystery poops. Those are mysteries. Yeah. Then there's the ghost. Shit totally disappears. No, I consider it go shit. When you shit and you wipe and nothing's on the, how is that even possible? And you look, you're like there's a big shit in there and you're like, wait, is there shit somewhere else on my body? Like you reach around, you're like, no, she's on the cheeks. There's no how is there no shit. It feels like you, like you won a lottery. It doesn't it feel special or the best day. I think part of that too, I think you can prompt that a little bit. Somebody told me he's was, if you spread your cheeks before you sit, so everything really goes apart. But I still, I think God could fall on, you know, that's counterintuitive honestly. Because if the hole is bigger, you're not pinching it off. So that to me would create an infinity wipe. A scenario actually. Yeah, I disagree. You want it pinched? Well, interesting. So many different theories, you know? Um, let's see. The world is a mysterious place on a United flight. They just suggested the seatbelt be low. And tight. This goes against all my beliefs. Should we start a campaign to educate?

Speaker 4:          00:53:25       I'll love no hate. F all the haters, Nick. No, I'm offended. Yeah. I want to be high inside is the only way to live your life. I mean, low and tight. So terrible. Now. It doesn't feel good. No, it feels a little tight. God, air travel is the worst in this country. Yeah. It's so demeaning. It really is. It really is the worst experience. I was watching this show.

Speaker 3:          00:53:50       No, the new one I'm watching, I forget the fucking, this is us. Yeah. There's a surprisingly good show. So good for a network show. And um, there's a character on there who's battling with her weight and she's, I don't know like what she weighs, but she's really large and she gets on an airplane and the woman next to her totally eyeballing her and she's like, don't worry. I bought two seats. And then the, you know, the flight attendant comes by and he's like, I got your seatbelt extender. Like totally loud. She's like, thanks. I got it. Like I'm already fucking embarrassed enough. Yeah. And then she's like, I know how to do it. You know, like, and I just felt so if you feel so bad for her, cause you're like, ah, like you did the right thing, you bought two seats that you're not like ruining anyone else's day. But it just seems, I just feel so badly for those people. The seatbelt extend nerves and everything. Yeah. I mean terrible being fat. I imagine it's hard cause that's your addiction, you know. But everyone gets to see what your addiction is.

Speaker 4:          00:54:45       I know it was so hard on a flight actually with um, Bert. Yeah. And the flight attendant to like a discreet seatbelt extent. Like they to him, to him, they gave it to him. Yeah. And he was like, hey. And then she came back, she was like, you did anything? He was like, fuck of sort of like, Gosh. Yeah. But it was the thing I've seen them, I've seen it done discreetly, which is nice to do it that way. Like they do it kind of like, like walking by like the dropping something off, you know, like not make a scene of it. Yeah. Don't be a dick.

Speaker 3:          00:55:22       Okay. I mean, they're embarrassed enough, I'm sure. Yeah. It's terrible to have to buy two seats on a plane. She's, yeah. What? Bernd does it all the time. Yeah, he does. Or he just flies first class. Isn't that why? Because the seats are beggar.

Speaker 4:          00:55:36       [inaudible] do I does it? Yeah. A little bit of room. He barely wedges into those seats. I know. Hmm. Drank in the whole time. I Super Fat. So another email here. Um, this is one for you. What do you think of this? Why don't you read that out loud? I can't. Okay. Hi, Mommy's congrats jeans. My aunt and I have gotten into heated discussions about what pre prenatal prenatal vitamins due to your nose picking. She thinks that because the vitamins make your nails grow so long hinders your ability to pick. I completely disagree and used my claws as shovels to grab that shit up from, from up in my brain. My question is obviously for Christina, queen of personality, do use your prego

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       clause to your advantage or do you cut them? These are the thoughts I have after my husband has left for work and I'm picking my nose waiting for my coffee. Thanks. Mommy's love you Sarah. Well, Sarah, I have to tell you, you're right that your nails. Do you know that like those crazy people that we play videos. So you have to, I like them short. I think it's disgusting personally to have long nails. Well, think about how somebody with long nails feels hearing that right now. I mean, seriously even see I prefer long or short nails. You say those people are disgusting. I mean, it's disgusting. Not The people. It doesn't matter. Do you think that they, I mean I got to, you got to think about everybody's feelings all the time. No, I find it unhygienic cause I personally get a lot of people with poor hygiene feel when I make fun of it. Yeah, man, that's not okay because somebody beat me.

Speaker 3:          00:57:24       Oh, the trauma. Oh, so sad. So, uh, anyways, to answer your question, I keep them shorter because actually I found that nose picking is enhanced with a shorter nail. You're going to do more damage with a longer nail and you're also going to introduce more bacteria in your nose, which is how you get sick. Now, apropos our discussion earlier, how I avoid sickness. I'm a compulsive hand washer. I washed the backs of my hands like a surgeon. I sing happy birthday. Happy Birthday Song three times as I wash. That's the rule. I do not pick my nose if I know there's sickness in the house. This is truth. I will use a Kleenex instead because that's how you get cold. This you pick your nose, you, you rub your eyes, he put it, you put your fingers in your mouth. True Story. All right? Don't touch your fucking face.

Speaker 3:          00:58:21       That's how you're not, that's how you avoid sickness can, you're not a nose picker like me. You're a thumb picker. I've seen you. You do this. You do this. Yeah. You pull out a scrawny honor roll and then you flick off the bat, but sometimes I dig with the index finger to I'm seldom seen. I've seen you do with a pancake. Thank you. I'll do it too. He used to roll your boogers in my car and I flipped the on the floor. Yeah. Thanks for doing that. It's really cool. Click, click was so nasty, man. I'm into picking my son's nose. It's a fun game, kind of the best thing. And he's like, he'll, he'll raise it. Hey, let's you, and then he doesn't know what you're doing. So whenever you're doing man, whatever, it's just as gratifying to pick your son's nose as it is to pick your own. I had no idea. It's one of the joys of parenthood now. I don't like picking your nose though. I think it's disgusting. Yeah. Um, but our son, I love it. You remember last week, I think it

Speaker 4:          00:59:21       was last week, there was a, there's this big news story that dear leader Trump, um, so supposedly in a meeting referred to African countries and Haiti as shit countries said like, why are we getting all these people from these shithole countries when we could be at one? I prefer to get people from Norway. I mean, oh boy. You tell me if there's any subtext. But, um, yeah, so obviously, and then, you know, he came out, said, I never said that. And then people confirm that he said that. And then, uh, I think Republicans that were in the meeting said they couldn't recall what he said. Either way. Uh, there was a, this came in that some big words were said on CNN by somebody who was trying to make a point about Oh, offended. He was by hearing the president say, or the alleged comment that he said that there's people from Chicago never takes responsibility. Nothing ever happened. Never his fault.

Speaker 7:          01:00:29       Well, Mommy, get the, your reaction to what the president said about these brands to want to come to the United States from countries like Haiti and Africa, because I'm going to give you a reaction if it's personal. I'm a proud shit hole. My family was called Watson macro leaders. We came from the Italians and Irish who were regarded as people from shithole countries. Oh, a century ago. We call people slamming eyes, Chinese immigrants that were now ashamed of speaking about it in those terms because they came from a shit hole country and now they're our backbone of this country. In the 1940s we call people traders because they came from a shingle country. We call Japan and we're ashamed. We call people who fled from conflict and set full America spics and what backs and we're ashamed growing this country on the backbone of bigotry that comes from when I saw my family called Styx waps and macro leaders. We should be ashamed, man. We've learned too many lessons and history will.

Speaker 4:          01:01:30       Okay. What's a macro eater? Macro eaters. Is he talking about like macaroni macaroni, Saudi saying Matt girl like the fish. I Dunno, I've never heard that one before. You learn something new on this show every week. Just like macro you dog can't. Yeah, Mackerel. It was a oh a macro what? Linked off the fish, right? It wasn't a sectarian slur for Roman Catholics. Oh right. Cause they eat fish on Fridays or, oh, that's funny. That's hilarious. What about Hungary? I'm fine. I'm a shit hole country. Yeah. About Eastern Europe. I know what other slurs, but Slovakia or, or you know, whenever Ukraine, Russia or we all shit hole my anti anti sing Hungarian sediment. Oh, let's see. Uh, it's called Hungaria Phobia. Anti Hungarian ism is dislike, distrust, racism, xenophobia directed against the Hungarians. It sounds like it could involve hatred, grievance, distrust, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Do to Hungarian background.

Speaker 4:          01:02:36       I'm trying to see if there's any, uh, yeah, no. Um, Hongos I don't see any like list of slurries and patriots in English. Oh, a Bolo, honk, honk. And he's a combination of Bohemian and Hungarian. Cool. And hunky derived from both hunk. It's in the movie 16 candles. It is long duck Dong says oily, honk. The Dad calls her fiance about hunk. Hmm. Let me see if there's a, yeah, so it was hunk here. Yeah. No. So He's hung out. No, but I'm saying that's, that's one of the, it's like the slur. Oh, cool. You are a SPEC, right? Pretty much through and through. I mean, you're a, you're a Christine, the bow hunk. I think that's pretty accurate. Yeah. I got called Polak a lot growing up. Did you that makes sense. So it's more common. Uh, yeah. This here spic as defined here is just a person of Hispanic descent.

Speaker 4:          01:03:41       Um, theories include no speak English and that's where SPEC comes from. Oh No, SPEC speak English. But as it believes that it's the abbreviation of Hispanic and other ones. Interesting. So, all right, let's speak English. I no spic. I no speak English. Everybody says like that though every a Taco head cause a Mexican person never heard Taco this as that's from born on the 4th of July. And that's where it was. It's not real. It's kind of a made up one. Spics pretty good pics. Pics big or spaghetti. It sounds so mean though. SPEC SPEC sounds harsh. Greaser, isn't that a Greaser greaser full metal jacket. The see grease ball. But that's an, that's an Italian, right? I guess you could also have Italian grease ball usually. So what they say right? Tele in Greece. Are you fucking me? Guinea grease ball. Yeah. Yeah. Then that guy goes on, uh, uh, Don Lemon, same guy. And he, he puts these conversations that this is economics. So let's be clear. Phillip mud from Norway can come here, but a black dude from Haiti can't. What does that tell you in an America that one in one generation called you a nigger. What does that tell you? Dot. Whoa. Big words. Very big words, but he's just throwing, throwing all of them out there. I didn't know you were going to go straight to that. Holy Shit. I've got to kind of big words. It's very fired

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       up this to tell you that. What? That tells a honky like me, we're no different than we were a generation ago and we're learning the same lessons that we learned when we call the Chinese man a slanted I, when we called the man from Guatemala spic and a wetback call a black man in the Sam Hill. I think he likes to run through his knowledge of that. Yeah. He's like, I got good one guys. Gimme a gimme a country gimme a gimme one. That is kind of a real gift he's got, that's what it tells me. We got a ways to learn, but we can step back and say we're proud because I spoke this on CNN 30 to one the emails I got were saying, you speak for us and we are not from Africa and we're not from Norway were from Italy, were from Ireland. Okay. Wow.

Speaker 3:          01:06:03       Well, are any Haitian, speaking of all the Chinese man a slammed I, oh my God. God. When we call the man from Guatemala spic and a wetback. Holy Cow. I got Ya. That's such a beautiful region of the world. I don't think Trumpers has been to a t I t Dominican Republic. That is a beautiful region. Conan. He went down there to do his show, you know that.

Um, no, and, and our president will be glad to accept them as Australians. Why is that? I don't know. It's weird. Um, anyways, this rapper might have a cease and desist headed his way. Oh, because guess what he's using as his m c name, his artistic name? No, he is going by top dog. No,

Just knowing me for 12 years to married to a technique, the way that he goes from the duck is cadence kind of set himself up for the next line. No, no. Uh, facial hair. Um, just knowing me, wait, let me, hold on, let me watch a little more and I'll see if I can come

Speaker 8:          01:09:42       really hard to watch. Not a snitch, man. Joe Beach. But baby, you know what I mean? I'm the craziest man you'll ever see.

Speaker 4:          01:09:53       Yeah. Wow. That's um, yeah, it's pretty good. It's pretty good. It's hard to, it's in case you haven't guessed it.

Speaker 8:          01:10:02       The teeth, you're rich. It's hard for us. I think you're a snitch man. Joe Beach. But baby, you're not crazy walking down the street, walking down the street, walking down the streets. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:10:21       See I think our machines where they guy just has a little more passion. I Dunno, this guy seems pretty passionate. I just, I'm, this guy's got more technical ability but our guys like I just feel it more for, I think again, you know what he's missing is just a great producer as always. Can we get Jimmy Ivan [inaudible] as I wasn't even on the phone. Yeah. Oh let's go get, let's go down to Malibu. Find Him. Could be and get him to produce this guy.

Speaker 8:          01:10:48       Cause I am fucking one day. Definitely one day. Slay the AK. Yeah, this is my day. Get those days.

Speaker 3:          01:11:03       Well, he definitely, I mean, he definitely wrapped a lot. He raps. I mean, it's good. Again, it's so distracting the mouth. I can't, I can't get past the team. There we go.

Speaker 8:          01:11:12       Rocking shoes was

Speaker 9:          01:11:14       walking down the street, walking down the street. She had the worst day.

Speaker 4:          01:11:21       Yeah. Yeah. That's good. So that top, what were you fixated on? I got it. Teeth? Yeah. Oh, I didn't think about that. They're really bad. Uh, I mean, yeah, but that could be part of the hook of the like, you know, just be called Dj bad mouth. Right. Dj Dad Mail. That was great. That's really good. We should suggest that. Yeah. I mean, that was terrible. Let's see. Here's the thing, if you embrace it, it's like you embrace, so yeah. What's The lady? She has kind of crooked teeth. Which one? Uh, she's the, you know, talking about jewel. Jewel. Oh yeah. Snaggletooth yeah. So there was a time years ago when she was going to fix her teeth. Oh yeah, no, no. And her fan base flipped out. No Way. Like Barbara Streisand's knows. Everyone told her get a nose job. She was like, no fucking way. And that people love it.

Speaker 4:          01:12:22       Just like me with my quadruple d tits, super slut, 15 d tits. Yeah. I really, the more pregnant I become, I've, the more I feel like dog, the bounty hunters wife. It's not a good luck. I just feel like I look great. You look great. But you know what I mean? The, the bigger they get, the bigger I get. Yeah. You got a big Ole knockers, you're going to feed a whole bunch of babies with those titties. Yeah. Yeah. You got, there you go. Oh my God. We were watching dark. Aw, Jesus. Cry. I can't watch missing kids. Do you? Okay. So if you haven't seen dark, it's on Netflix, Dork, Dork. It's Dork sided, but it became, it's kind of been this international, you know, sensation. But I've heard a lot of people talking about it. One thing I'm fascinated by, I've never seen this on Netflix or really you don't see it that often.

Speaker 4:          01:13:10       Uh, if you are watching programming at all in the United States when a foreign show has dubbed as opposed to subtitles. It's rare, but I have a theory on this. My theory is this, well, because they have a lot of subtitled stuff. Yeah, like Netflix. It's not uncommon to see subtitles. I think my guests and I, I wanna, I wanna research and find out if this is true that they dubbed as opposed to subtitle because through their own research found that Americans didn't want to listen to German. It's a beautiful English. I think that's what I really didn't dairy, I'm offended. I studied German and college is a beautiful other because why would they? Because there's a bunch of shows with house in high school. Like why would they do that if that's not the case? Why is narcos all in Spanish and subtitled? I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:14:07       I mean, my guess is narcos a biggest show as Dork. You want those? Is it bigger than Dork? Oh yeah. I don't know, Dude. I mean it's fucking great. I don't like it. It always reminds me of those KCLA morning movies where they used to play Pippi Longstocking and then they dug her shit over and I don't like going to lips not moving. I don't like watching things not match up. I admit that or follow you ended up being lost. I mean, but there's so many Latin, I mean so many Latin people in the u s yeah, maybe we're just more used to hearing set on the same. And I feel like Americans for the most part are like what? Or maybe they found that people were clicking off the show because it was subtitled and they're like, no, this is such a good show. We need people to be watching.

Speaker 4:          01:14:55       Actually the first time we tried watching Dork at the subtitle feature wasn't working. Really? Yeah. We tried watching it twice and they just weren't coming up like it wasn't working at all. And it was all in Houston. It was all inspections. The yeah. Yeah. He should be nine Belinda shots. Shites well it's a bond. You know, he really bad. Why don't we just wrap it up? Oh yeah, try it out. Try it out. Piss on me, beat me because one of us beat us. Try it out. Uh, thanks as always for listening to the show. Thanks for watching on Youtube. [inaudible] tubes. We have some great guests coming up in the next few weeks. Your emails are always appreciated.
