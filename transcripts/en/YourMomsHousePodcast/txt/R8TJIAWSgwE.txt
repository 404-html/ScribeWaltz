Well that'd be here very shortly. We've been friends in the area for a long time. He's been our guy long time. Arie Shaffer now he's all east coast area. East Coast airy and a strange ranger. I can't wait to hear what he's been up to. Definitely got a weird something going on. What's going on? Well, let's start this show. Let's get into, sure, sure, sure. Jean shirt. Play with our genes, our genes. These chicks. I'll do anything for a buck. Horny. Bored housewives are waiting and you watch these bitches. Big Black Cocks. How do they do it?

Speaker 2:          00:01:20       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:01:32       try it out. You made such a dad face like you are like a dad playing a guitar. I was jamming out with because Lou reed. Hey Lou reed. I don't hate him, but um, I love the velvet underground. I likely read and were affected when he died. I was, cause I, I like the velvet underground more than I liked his independent stuff. Yeah. But when he died you were very disrespectful. Oh, you were so disrespectful. You were like, fuck Lou Reed. I don't know what put him, I don't give a show Ballou poker room. A bus driver from the Bronx. Now you are pretty much like that. You're like, fuck that guy. I don't like his fuck his shit. No, I wasn't wearing, you're very, I don't like his fucking Shit fucking shit. But you were, you're just very like, ah, I don't care. That sounds more like me, Lou Reed, whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       I don't care. That sounds like, I think because you don't like good things. Like you don't like good music. Right. The way I like good stuff so far, so far argument. We were in the car and there's like two songs in your whole iTunes library that I really like and the rest I'm like, is this real or do they just pull one gifted me tones. But you listen to like mall music, like the shit they play an h and m, that's the shit that's in your iTunes like Rihanna or fucking like, I know a lot of people like, and I don't, I'm, I'm ashamed to say I don't, I couldn't name tell me the story again of me that waking up last year, the worst. You're such an asshole. You're the worst. So our child, our infant was crying at two 30 in the morning. First child was crying it one hour before you and I being super, super preggers at we, we sleep upstairs, the baby's downstairs.

Speaker 1:          00:03:23       So I was like, I don't want to get up, go downstairs. It's hard for me to lift him at this point. So woke you up on the first cry in a fucking deep sleep on that one. You always in a deep sleep. Okay. So, oh no, I'll throw up. And um, so the second crying fit of crying comes and I sleep light. I'm immediately awake. The dogs are up there like who's crying? The whole house is up except for you. You're in a deep snore and I can't reach over to touch you because I have that pregnancy pill that I'm in Cayston. I can't like touch you too far from me. And so I'm like Tom, Tom, Tom and I keep getting louder and I go, Tom Segura, Tom Cigar, Tom Cigarette. I'm like screaming. The dogs are like jumping up and down, like freaked out and you're just sawing away. I'm like, this is on fucking bully of all. I didn't hear a thing. No, because you're in such a coma. And thankfully he stopped crying. He put himself back to sleep. But I was like, this is

Speaker 3:          00:04:29       the thing is you get a little adrenaline when you first jump. Like when I went down at one 30 you have a little adrenaline to get up out of sleep and go down to, you know, to pick up your kid. Right? So I went and I went down there. I was like, Ooh. And I remember when I sat in the chair with him, I was like, Oh shit, like I'm half asleep right now. And he went, he, he chilled back down pretty easily. But when I got back to bed, man, that really,

Speaker 1:          00:04:59       you're so ridiculous. I, I sang it just as easy as I have no recollection of this obviously. No, I know. And I was like, I can't believe he's sleeping straight. You were ripping through it. I love it. You said my full name course. Thompson Thompson hoping that maybe you thought I was referring to. I had indifferent Tom in the room and you were like, that can't be me. That's not my thought with me here. It so fucking crazy dude. How you deep you are. You're such a deep sleeper. But it's good cause I get up every hour to p practically and I'm like, Oh, I'm just waking this poor guy up all night. Don't remember fully disrespecting this guy. When he died, he did not like him. How would, I don't even know Yana, any super fans. I think

Speaker 3:          00:05:43       I, I know I have a somewhat of recollection. I think what happened to be fair is that when he died and was like, what's he known for? I was like, oh, I don't care for that. Like, whatever he did, I don't care for. So,

Speaker 1:          00:05:56       oh, it doesn't on the wild

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       side. And I don't look at it, I'm saying I, I'm like, I don't care for it. It doesn't affect me. No. And therefore his death is like, you know, I'm not happy he's dead, but I'm just saying like, you know, no, you were a little hostile. It was that. Yeah, it was a day for you. It was an off day. I think maybe you were taking it out on Lou Reed. Really Yanas out there listening. Uh, if y'all could reference said episode and question super fans out there, we could dig up that audio blue band and we could replay your reaction to Lou Reed's dad. I don't know how this came to us, but this is from, oh, you're just changing the subject just so that this is a Lou Reed. Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I don't know how this, this video came to us, but this is a special feature from the thinking triple x DVD featuring Lou Reed, very reading various taglines from tricolor triple x movies and advertisements.

Speaker 4:          00:06:49       Right. Cool. Why this is in our inbox, but I like it. Yeah, you like it. There's no reason for me to read the title of the piece. I love the title. Welcome Lou.

Speaker 1:          00:07:47       real nice when they do the voiceover with a toothpick in his guy was just thinking that that was very distracting. I mean, you know, you know what, honestly, not enunciating the way you should be with to in your mouth. No. You know who hates toothpick users? Your dad hates them. Yeah. Like, since I was a little kid would point out, look at this fucking asshole with his fucking tooth. Picky thinks is cool. And he just had the such disdain for this Kinda toothpick thing. Like where it's hanging. Yeah. Yeah. Hanging out of your mouth. He said you look so stupid to picking the food out of his mouth to the fucking toothpick. Why? Why there to stay pluralize it toothpicks. Why do you think you're still upset? I don't know. He must've had some early childhood experience with toothpicks that stuck with it. Excuse me.

Speaker 1:          00:08:31       That's pregnant vomiting and my own mouth. Um, I don't know. He, he just felt it was very American and very crass. You think I'm not a big tooth pick user or, you know, I mean, I, I will, if I'm leaving a place as I'm leaving, if I feel like I need it and they have them, I'll do that for that moment. You know, like if you don't know, I feel something here, but I'm not always getting toothpicks. I feel like they don't really do adult job around with them. Like this fucking jackass. Oh, there's a disdain, right? You go there it goes. Yeah. I don't think they do much. I feel like they just pushed the food further in between your teeth. Level of disrespect for the people that asked me to come in. I'm gonna do a voice over with it. Toothpick in my mouth.

Speaker 1:          00:09:12       I agree. Well he's Lou Reed, man. I know, but why don't you start chewing gum? I'd be like, I'm going to do the fucking voiceover chewing gum. Quiet.

She's alleging I like to, I, Hey, you disrespect. I liked, we read a lot. I thought it was very sad when he died. Yeah, I didn't care. Wow. I can't wait until Skinner dies. And you start crying rivers. Who? Leonard Skinner. I cry about that. Well, remember we were pulling up and you were like, you had, first of all, I've never heard a full Leonard Skinner and song in my life. Yeah. You played it for me. What did you play?

Speaker 1:          00:12:07       Can I hate that shit? That shit is like, yeah, but you think that I would be emotionally affected. They have some like that favor. You're always playing. Scanning even know the name of the song you play WWE, we parked, we were parked in the driveway. I remember a couple of days ago. And you're like, this is Leonard. I know, I know what you're saying, but you're saying that I would be affected. Yeah, he'd probably cry. Cause I remember, you know, every time I hear one of your garbage music's like that in your iTunes. Really, really disrespectful with this shit. I imagine you in college in South Carolina, North Carolina, same thing and the two, and you, you and your friends are sitting in lawn chairs and you're drinking your beers and there's like a barbecue and then you're like, I read, I turn that Skinner up. And then you guys all shares each other and then you go raping or Oh my God. Hogging. That's what you called it. When you go find, you know, big checks. Yeah. And then you'd bang her. Didn't you go hoggin?

Speaker 3:          00:13:02       No. Who had hogging this kid? Craig told me about this. I told you the whole story. He said he was going Haagen what does that? And he's like, come on man. You know what Hoggin is? No, he's great. You just go try to find the fastest check you confined Fucker, you know? Yeah. It's like, whoa. You've never done that? No, of course not. No. Make it a game to hunt for fat chicks. No. Rapey isn't as I bag thing to do. And this guy was your best friend? No, he's a guy that lived in the dorm. There's a lot of weird fucking people in that place. Oh

Speaker 1:          00:13:39       really? Yeah. In North Carolina. No Shit.

Speaker 3:          00:13:43       We used to call this one kid. What did we call him? Gray. Here we go. I call them like n word. No, what we call them. Like something. It was something revolting, like vomit or something like that was his nickname. He used to sleep on a mattress with no sheets. It was just like gray with stains and just the most just vile, really gross people. Yeah. Yeah. There was definitely gross people all over that hall and this guy with his hoggin was pretty gross too.

Speaker 1:          00:14:17       I, it's so funny, I can't even picture you living in north cal. Cackle Acca is, as you say, I can't picture you being, I don't mean that there's gross people in the Carolinas. There's gross people everywhere. But I was saying specifically my dorm hall, just gross people there. Yeah. There was this one Italian guy, I don't know if I've told the story on this show, I don't want to say his name, but he was an Italian foreign exchange student on our hall. Yeah. And one time he woke up in the middle of the night and a friend of our saw him washing his penis in the men's bathroom and they're like, what are you doing dude? He's like, go ahead to wash him up INA soften to the sink, wash your Dick off work because he has an erotic get a wet dream. Yeah. And he washes pinner off in the all boys' bathroom or something.

Speaker 1:          00:15:03       It's weird. I always thought it was weird to have coed shitters in um, colleges. They do that. Yeah. We had a separate, yeah, sort of way. God see the girl next door of being pounded. Ron wanted to shoot it as wide. All over my big boobs. I finger myself at the same time, watch the glory hole and these bitches don't care who they suck. Titus has pounded hard, wet change, homeless black women beyond that. So awful. Even for me. Jeez. Yeah. Homeless black women. That was his breaking point. Yeah. That's funny. Yeah. That's what we liked. That homeless black women.

Speaker 1:          00:15:44       Yeah. He's a racist. Right guys? We need to boycott Lou Reed. He's a racist. It's a really bad thing. Black cocks. Wherever the social justice warrior. Yeah. Buzzfeed. Come on starting article. Zoom his body and stab him. Stab him for laughing at that guy. Shouldn't laugh at certain things. No, you should not. You should be told when it, it's okay to laugh and when it's not okay to laugh. I believe in that wholeheartedly. Guys. Are we mocking the black female homeless community out there that, I mean the privilege of that man has and is unaware of. It's just, Ooh, I bet he used a gender specific restroom before he read that too. Yeah, I know. Yup. How dairy? Somebody said they had a lung infection, a picture

Speaker 3:          00:16:34       mommies. I was listening to episode four 51 when something big dawned on me. I couldn't believe how big it was. My brother wouldn't believe it either. He has no neuropathy issues. He believes me now though, and I'll start when you, Hitler's began mocking that God's given him raw art form of scatting only to turn around and praise a lung infection. Ramblings of a desert BG. It occurred to me that the desert BG could in fact be scatting. According to Wikipedia, scatting is a type of vocal music that involves using nonsensical syllables to sing non vocal dance tunes. In my opinion, the desert bgs, lung infection loaded singing is largely, if not wholly comprised of nonsensical syllables and non vocal tunes. What do you think? Anyway, my moose soup is ready. Got to go. Thanks Zach. Zack Hitler.

Speaker 1:          00:17:26       Zack, you're, I see your logic. However it is flawed because we all know that he's trying to sing, staying alive. It's not nonsense gibberish. It's his version of staying alive. Yeah. He's saying the words in his mind. He's saying the words right. He's trying write scat. There's no agenda. There's no plan and scheme. Yeah, he's a beeline. Stay be ah, ah, AH, stay beeline. That's true.

Speaker 1:          00:18:11       Well there you go. There it is. Who would you rather hang out with? The No neuropathy guy? I'm talking like a hang. You guys go to a coffee house and you have just a cup of coffee and you have to talk and listen to what this guy says. Yeah. It's either the known rob Athey four strokes. Yeah. Or the try it out guy. Oof. Like you have to really talk to him. Um, or better yet you're stuck on an airplane and it's a cross country flight. And do we, who are you sitting next to try it out? Or No neuropathy,

Speaker 5:          00:18:47       man.

Speaker 3:          00:18:49       I don't know. For stroke. What is this for? Stroke. Anthem deal, man. Somebody gave me a fourth. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:19:00       you're not answering my question. You're distracted with the soundboard. So answer my fucking question either for stroke guy or try it out. Oh, definitely. Hanging out with for stroke. I first. Why definitely you make it sound like it's a no brainer because it is a no brainer. Why you could tell that

Speaker 3:          00:19:19       for stroke guy has like a level of politeness to him. He's, he makes points like I'm not trying to make you do anything you don't want to do and you don't believe in this. Don't do it. I'm not saying to do it anything you're not uncomfortable with. Like he really, he has awareness, social awareness if you will. He does the, the other. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:19:40       Guy Ipad. Any kind of direct tau disorder problems.

Speaker 3:          00:19:45       I mean this guy, he's even more articulate. It makes me feel like there's more, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:19:50       we don't think the try it out. Guy would be fun because of the rambling. Yeah. He'd be like, it's scary. Here's the deal man. I got way, he's way. He's way scary. Right. I kinda, I gotta have this peanuts man. I got my other,

Speaker 6:          00:20:03       it really smoked with me. He put his dick. I can't believe how big is stabilized. He jacked off boards. Yeah, and shot the most coffee every time. But

Speaker 1:          00:20:12       here's the problem with this here, the neuropathy guy is that I have a feeling he's going to be fixated on this subject and you're going to have to hear about the entire flight. Yeah, but the other guy can't get off of it. It might snap. He's really, he's really fucking freaked out. You know, he's freaked out. But he might have tangent, tangential thoughts and like interesting studies. Gross. I think he's pretty gross. I think bad things happen when you're around him. Let's try it out guy. No fucking way. I take the try it our guy. You know what? Why don't want to hear about him jacking his deck for four. He's only going to talk about Dick Jacks. That guy's going to talk about pissing on him and beating. It's more interesting than the known neuropathy needs. Know your app and your app and he knows the mind his business when it's time now near apathy.

Speaker 1:          00:20:59       The other guy does not really doesn't. Yeah. Oh uh, oh God. You're disgusting. Tells me that. Anyways. Do you think he's right? No, I don't think that guys right. Zach's not right. It's not scanning. No, no. He was singing a fucking sending a scouting is nonsensical. It has no plan or rhythm. It's random, but that guy is clearly singing a version of a song. You know what I'm saying? Scat. There's no agenda. It's like free form that this isn't free for him. This guy has a plan and here's another one. Dear Tyler, Christine and I got to pay him.

Speaker 3:          00:21:35       After recently being the wedding, I received a thank you card from her that ended, you are the reason my husband and I started fighting in front of each other. I managed to accomplish just amazing feat by bringing up my friends, horrible gas to her. Then boyfriend, when I first met him, now they consider me the hero of their love story. Oh Wow. Seeing as releasing bottom burbs can be an important milestone in a relationship. I would love to hear about the first time you floated Airbus gets in front of each other. Well, we've covered this for sure. You're covering the last episode and it says, do you think it's possible to go to entire marriage that letting your mate here a single, but I mean, this is literally what we just talked about. Um, well everyone knows the story of me farting in front of you. I don't even remember your first part,

Speaker 1:          00:22:18       truth, nor do why mine was obviously really impressive, but I don't recall. But I, you know, we've been astounded by couples that don't and don't Brown. We don't brown in front of each other. That's the last boundary we've maintained. Really? Yeah, but we talk about it constantly. We do, but we don't actually like browns. We just like, yeah, no part, but I'm not going to shit in front of you. I personally look, it's not so much about the farting per se. I feel like it's an intimacy barrier. Like if you're not farting in front of each other. Yeah. Like what else are you lying about? There you go. It's like lies to me. It's a great thing to bring up to the next person that doesn't want to Fart in front of you. Like, why are you lying to me? Right. It feels like it's not real. I agree. How do you not for like 20 years, people hold in farts. Nasty. You Want to take a quick pee break? Yeah, I got to go see. I see. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:23:12       And we'll wait for Aerie. All right. Uh, we did it and it's great. We're back with

Speaker 1:          00:23:18       one and only Joe mother fucker. Yo are, you should be here for a second. We've been so excited to play that drop all day. I was like, why are you pausing? That's a weird, oh that's it for hatred, hatred. I mean what's better than that guy? Yeah. What is that from? That's from Grifols. From Casino Casino. Okay. Nice talking to cm. Rosene fuck you mother fucker. Yo.

Speaker 7:          00:23:46       Fuck me. Fuck me. Fatso I can't wait for the, for the fucking liberal movement to find the, all square says these old movies and be like, wait, what? There's so much to boycott. We were just talking about that. We played a clip of Lou reed reading a porno descriptions and I can just see the social justice warriors pain cause he lacks zoom his body and stab him. He laughs at one point he's made laughs uh, black on black homeless women and they were like, well now they would just be like, you know, hates Titus has pounded hard with change, homeless black women beyond that. So awful. And now they'd be like, is it, is it awful? Awful though? Louis a woman who's black, marginalized by society and homeless is something to laugh at. Oh, so we laugh with people getting downtrodden. Okay, I see what you're saying.

Speaker 7:          00:24:37       I see what you're doing that cause you're rich to think everyone downtrod is worse. I got it. Bad side, something to laugh that pull all of his albums and ruin his career. I mean are you, are you kind of going like what the fuck with how outrageous that shit is now? Some of it's like naughty and it's the pressure that's put on everybody to react the same all the time. Right. The guys. Because then we'll know what team you're on. I know, but it's like, it's like with normal people have to in silence go. I can I talk to you? I'm sorry. No worries. What happened to that one guy? I'm going to see people coming and pick up your fucking pick it. Yeah. Well that's crazy. With Elise, the Chris Hardwick thing is that that girl, the accuser just wrote like a blog essentially. Like it wasn't even a vetted article in a print.

Speaker 7:          00:25:24       It was like, Hey, here's just what I think and then everything's gone. Everything is just gone. His careers, everything else. So I don't think he did. Even in her wish she wrote it is sexual assault. It's just like I really want to fuck all the time. And it's like, okay, well no deal from it. She said within two weeks she was doing everything he said. So if I'm to believe that there's this sexual assault that was, he must have a power over here. So Chris Hardwick must be some sort of demon or a wizard to be able to, in two weeks for somebody, maybe he's a pimp with longterm pit. It's like crazy. It's walk away. Whether or not it's, it's, it's like not even vetted. There's no due process. It's just like this girl says it and now we don't know her mental state. She was an actress. They're all morons. Every one of them. Even the ones who made it, they're all fucking loopy. Dipshits some of them are well read cause they get a lot of scripts in front of them. They are more Roz. You guys have met actors, actresses, the guy, actresses of justice, bad solipsistic garbage. Everyone's world where it was just them. What about Johnny Depp's thing? Have you read the recent interviews of him and being broken? I that, that's crazy.

Speaker 7:          00:26:36       That's an actor. You fucking moron. How would you broke? You broke and part of a franchise. They have the, he got 30 million a flick

Speaker 8:          00:26:44       for though. What the fuck you talking about broke? No, that's not an option. They uh, they have an email in there from him, from his business manager to him. Uh, it's like from when they were obviously still working together and he's like, Hey, I got to give you a warning. I got to give you a heads up. The holidays are coming up. I need you to keep your holiday spending within reason. And he writes back, thank you. Uh, I appreciate what you're saying, but also what am I supposed to do? It's the holidays. Have a family. People rely on, they need $5 million. He needs boats. I don't know what else to say to you. Um, and he's like, do you want me to sell art? If not, what do want me to sell it? Like eight question mark. What do want me to sell more? It was like, oh, I need something. Let me pause this. Just a rich version of pawning, something to be able to afford something else because of what I can sell it. Lord. I know his, his is, it really is though. Like a psychological disorder, I think. Like legit. No, no, no, because they said, you know, it is compulsive. Like 2 million a month. Just Bandanas.

Speaker 8:          00:27:54       2 million, $2 million a month. Wow. I mean, we're talking about spending $25 million a year and he's just like, not enough. I spent like two months, but we both were in a Hong Kong and bought suits. Huh. Uh, I don't know what you spent on the road I spent, how much did you spend? I think 300 okay. He went to Singapore. Okay. He dropped 110 grand on suits. Well, see if he had just gone across the water. Hong Kong. I, by the way, when I heard it was 300 I was like, what? Tom Road? That'd be like, yeah man, this is the guy who worked from, now he's going to fuck you, make you a nice suit. That's way less than a thousand. You're like, oh. I thought it was like 50 bucks just to a hundred grand on suits. My favorite is 5 million on shooting hunter s Thompson, his ashes into the sky with a canon. How much you spend on that? They claimed that the article claim 3 million and when he was met with that, he goes, that's bullshit. It was five to shoot. You can just get one of those fucking to shirt cannons. Yeah. I mean if, and any type of business owner, and Johnny Depp comes to the room and says, Hey, I'd like to do this thing that really hasn't been done much, can you do that? And I just, it my eyes turned to cash signs and they go, yes, it will cost 5 million.

Speaker 8:          00:29:25       Try something to cost you 250 bucks. And he's the guy who's, who's definitely like whatever you say. He's like, we got to do it all right. Yeah, because he also had emails to her. His manager was a busy manager, was like, you know, we got it. It can't do this, this is your behind on this. And he was like, I need that house, make it happen. We have to have this house because he bought like all these properties all over the world. I mean, how many houses? They were like, can you sell your villa in France that you don't go to? Like, no, I heard somebody say, this fucker for first sound like rockstar. It might've been a beetle, might've been someone else, but someone like that. And um, he goes, oh, it was a rolling stone. And he was like, don't have too much of a nut.

Speaker 8:          00:30:11       Don't have your costs be too high because then you will have to do things in order to pay for that nut to a hundred percent what he does. And he goes, not for me. I have three nice houses, one in New York, one in La, one in London, and I have to do some shitty commercials sometimes to pay for it. I don't want to do those things. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now this is a, it's they, it's crazy. How was he broke? He is the guy on the thing you just talked about. It's like get an allowance. He is doing that. He's like, they said like the whole thing is always trying to get him to do work, which he's happy to do. Yeah. And he's like, I'll make a fuck load of money and we'll be all right. And then he'll blow it all immediately spend it all the crazy.

Speaker 8:          00:30:55       That's why you see them also in those like weird. Um, you know when you go to Asia to, he's everywhere. That's all so crazy buying his fucking bullshit, man. Did you get a suit? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow. Yeah. I went to, yeah, it was in Hong Kong. Yeah. It was great. From Rhodes Guy, rocky. No, but in that pavilion, Danny's suit district is to district. Yeah. You walk out of there with a soup, you're like won a suit. I'm like, I, I have over my shoulder. Like come on, come on, get another suit. You know what, back to the, uh, the Hardwick thing. But one thing that's kind of, I realize is the difference now in culture is, um, the, when you fire someone, like when you're done with them, that's what they judge you now on is how swiftly. Yeah. And in absolute and complete that is done.

Speaker 8:          00:31:44       So it's like, it was that day. I think the Huh. It's crazy. Cause I'd like to see what happens. It's not my money, so I can't really tell them, but it's, I'd like to see what happens of a network. Just refuses to comment, not says, not such, which I love. It's like, Hey, we've actually been working with this guy, we're friends with this guy for a while. Um, while we figure this out, if it's, if it's right, that's terrible, but we believe in the sky. He Says No. So right now he's our buddy and if we find out that it's that he's lying, then you know, we'll take actions that we have to, but for right now that's been a part of our life for a long time. We're going to stand with them instead of just ruin a dude's life without any, to be honest.

Speaker 8:          00:32:22       That's all I'd want from any network is just to shut your mouth and let me take the heat, let the fucking heat come at the person and say, you could take our job at comedy central for all they do. Good or bad. They are great at just fucking shutting up and they don't get, they don't get involved. In fact, when Tj had his thing and people were like, comedy central, cancel the show, they put out like, oh no, no, that was canceled six months ago. Don't put this on. Put this on us. We actually did not get involved, which is, that's great. That's all you gotta do. Yeah. Just be like, don't go to you. Yeah. Had an article is really, oh my God, it's, it's strange.

Speaker 1:          00:33:00       The uh, you know, look, and I'm not questioning the validity of her claims. I'm not questioning factual, whatever, but at least for the public's sake, you know, at least if it's in print, they have to vet these people are all idiots. No stupid for us to be so kind of fact finding flying with this shit just happened. What, can you give me a trick? Last spilled coffee?

Speaker 8:          00:33:23       Is it a hot no, it's not hot, but I've got to think like coffee. You're going to stink like shit. Ah, oh. Well to fly home with a rotten milk on you. Thanks buddy.

Speaker 1:          00:33:32       Hey. But to not even explore the claim, even explored sure that they're right and that she's of sound mind and that this is true. It's just like off

Speaker 8:          00:33:42       McCarthyism. It's a form of a social McCarthyism accusations. Enough. Aye. Aye. Aye. Yeah. I'm on the side of these accusations aren't even up something. Fireable I don't know what you're saying from the article. Yeah. It's like what she's saying easy. Even as like, I don't know, he pressured you a lot and by the way, when he says the first thing he said after she had her surgery was going to have sex, if he said that in front of your mom, the fucking, come on guys. What sees a sociopath? Suddenly if he said it, it was a complete joke. Yeah, no, I, when I read it because I read it, I'm like, that's funny to say. Yeah. That is such a harsh overboard thing to say. I'll never forget he said it. I'm like, oh, come on. Yeah, that was definitely a comedian making a joke to release some tension in a room. Right? You just had surgery. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34:28       I think what the problem is is that there's no sense of context context anymore. It's like you, you said the word that nobody likes and now you're in trouble. You did the thing that nobody likes and it's like, well what about,

Speaker 8:          00:34:40       and they're going for like, there's tons of ways to interpret anything you say or do. Yeah. So what's the worst possible way I can interpret this? Right and no one, what's the worst to me is when comedians don't even look at that and go, hold on, hold on, hold on. Yeah. Can we look at what may be a positive way he might've meant that? Yeah. Like instead of just straight to like how dare you. Yeah. It's fucking horrible. It's scary. It's, it's kind of scary. It is. Yeah, it is. But, but like, I dunno where I didn't know. You just got to keep your head down. It's also a form of like ultra conservatism. Do you know what I mean? It's no better than being like on the other end of that ultra liberal ultra liberals are out of their fucking minds. Yeah. Yeah. The far left is they are far left.

Speaker 8:          00:35:24       That's a good way to say they are crazy as shit crazy and they're completely without any reason and they don't care. And a big reason I think that they act out in this way right now is because the lies with the other side. So Trump is in office and he hit him saying bad daddy. And it triggers the shit out of other power sources. A group mentality, group mob on the Internet saying, we want this guy gone and having it happen. That's, that's more powerful thing Trump is right now. And he's saying the motivation is because the leadership is so, it's saying like, we don't have the control, right? So what can we control and trusting that control to not like leaders of that side, but to fucking dummies. Yeah. I don't want people who are the same people that were beat you up because you like the fucking writers instead of the 49.

Speaker 8:          00:36:11       Right? Like that's a sign level person from sports to fucking politics. It is like really, it's really bad the way the, the conduct of, of what has become the, the f I mean, obviously both extremes are extremes and they act like complete fucking lunatics. The far left would eat their young and they'll do [inaudible]. If you don't, if you don't respond the way they want you to respond to every situation, that's it. They're there. They're fucking, they're that far left. When you get your, your father, when you get your partner pregnant, um, the number one thing they're hoping for is a trans baby crawl and then the far right. The funny thing about the far right is that they, they coined the term snowflake, you know, like that's what they, and they're the biggest snowflakes. No, right. For sure. The most sensitive, easily offended. They'll just lash out at you.

Speaker 8:          00:37:10       Again, not sharing a perspective. Then they're like, fuck dude, obvious people are double standards. Totally. No, they totally are. Comics do that too. It's like they, they shit on all these people for, for, for taking like pride in their victim hood and then they talk about some Twitter response to what are their jokes for an hour. It's like, all right, fuck it, get on with it. I feel like I don't exist in this world. I feel like I just observe it, you know what I mean? Like matrix style, but like what you're saying like, oh, the victim comedian, that's like doing the hall, I, this thing happened to me and I'm the victim and then how it, but then it's how dare you. Oh yeah. No, not even that. I just mean comics talking about like, I mean you had it with retard, you know, like at some point like, all right, get back to jokes.

Speaker 8:          00:37:53       Let people don't, don't us also be the ones saying, well, I had it hard because of this. Yeah. He's like, came at me after this joke. It's like, let them just go on with it. Go on with it. Yeah. Yeah. It's fun for promotion, but like if it's a real, like how dare they, it's like, it's fine. Let them, let them, let them act like people walk, walked out of my shell and like, yeah, Eleanor, you're harsh. You want a couple of people walking out or it's too safe. Right. You need those people. That's true. They make the rest of the people enjoy it. I tried to not engage this long time, you know? Really for sure. Well, you know what, my dad always told me what could ignore retard by the Holocaust. You guys, you've got to allow that. My Gosh. Yeah. I

Speaker 7:          00:38:36       do wonder

Speaker 1:          00:38:37       what the actual numbers are of people that are genuinely offended by things or

Speaker 7:          00:38:43       I want to ask me about like are you okay? I'll, I'll stop it, but let me just tell me the truth. Are you offended? Are you trying to get offended? Right? Which one? Is it here or do you wonder who's pissed off? Do you want to feel the applause of the people who hear you say that you're offended because then they think of you as this righteous. Yeah, Christina. Yeah. Yeah. When tig goes, I don't know what Louis Ck was thinking. It's like, well you could, I mean you have his number. The better way to find out who's doing an interview. It's just a call the guy. Look, what were you thinking? When you have a direct path to an answer, you find fucking climbers. Get the fuck Outta here. Shut up. What are you in food? No idea. The whole time you fucking heard everything we had, we heard whether you were doing your fucking show with them and get your show on their fucking bull shit. Well, now that I know, I'm glad my show is canceled. You can always just cancel your own show. You're just saying, I'm not doing my show anymore. Yeah, you have that power. I'm so glad this is now. It's, I'm able to fuck shut up. Shut up. Everyone's a hypocrite. Yeah. Well, yeah, that's interesting isn't it?

Speaker 7:          00:39:50       I mean, I'll go by, but Janeane Garofalo who was like, yeah, I heard it. We heard about Louie. I was at that fucking festival. We all laughed about it. You've got a different time and it is a different person than he was then we heard about it and our response was laughter. That's Janeane Garofalo yeah. And now you're a bit like, how dare you. It's like we heard it them, uh, during the time it happened, we weren't as harsh as you guys are now. Right. So like, it's suddenly we're supposed to be mad about something that happened a long time ago.

Speaker 1:          00:40:13       I'm trying to think of when the started and I'm texting with a friend of mine who's a professor in university and he says to me today that the students are now asking him to give them trigger warnings. Yeah. His lectures and asking if they can read their own books cause they don't want to read what's being assigned. And that some woman wrote an open letter to the dean open letter complaining that they were, they were assigned to read Shakespeare and that, um, that, that, that, that is part of rape culture and you go, well how did this get slick work? Is this, is this because of this veal generation, this millennial generation race? So, so stringently that now they're adults and they don't understand how the real world functions because their parents have fucking Molly coddled them and put helmets on them and made everything safe and secure and now they're in the world and they can't fucking deal.

Speaker 7:          00:41:02       I don't think, I think I'll just start doing that, I think. Have you ever known safe space rooms meltdown? No. Like that. Oh, is that what they're called? Yeah. Yeah. Safe space rooms. I thought that was all comedy is that there's a high overlap for sure. But, uh, there's, there's a meltdown was a safe space room for a while. They had it as a safe space for him and it was a called that it could just be the individual shows it got gut book. Yeah. That's the genre almost. They have like urban knights, they have six space. Nothing is going to offend you. Yeah. You just can't do anything there. I don't even, I mean sure. It's, it's funny.

Speaker 8:          00:41:34       Is it two hours ago I guess, and thinking about his, his catalog, Chappelle stopped in to meltdown and did like that first round like trans stuff. And that's where that like big blog, oh yeah. Blew Up, came out. She was like, I was here and I was initially excited to see who I thought was a great comedian. But then you wanna hear something funny about that. Um, a friend of mine was like, yeah, I was there. Uh, when he did that, you know, cause it's half comics. Yeah. And he was there. I was there and I was sitting next to the person who wrote that blog and she was dying laughing the entire time. Yeah. And then later it's like, well hold on. How can I get, well, I mean, are you thinking that with the amazing race and stuff? And people are like, how dare you?

Speaker 8:          00:42:21       And if I, if I like actually right on pathway to human, I was like, come on, come on. Those aren't, that's not real. It's fucking calm down. They'd be like, well, I have to admit I kind of kind of where from the provost when I saw it and then he went to a fucking raise and say, well by die from, from laughing at first. Yeah. So it's all ridiculous. Are you going to say about the safe space room? Oh, so they do these, what was I gonna say about it? They do these sat scores. They're fine with me to to put on. It's just like, I don't know if that's, if you're really kind of don't want comedy that infringes on that at all. It's fine to have those rooms. So colleges that safe space room, but just know that if I now go to a club, I'm not going to get that.

Speaker 8:          00:42:55       So like once you're out of here in college, you're going to, it's going to be real world again, but it's okay if you just want a nice fun bubble to like, you know, it's kind of silly that they even provide that for you though because it's not, it's not preparing you for the real world at all. Well, in other ways it is. How so? I mean, learning how to put put memos and your boss's desk, it prepares you for like legit things. Well yeah, but I'm saying it doesn't prepare you for the safe spaces, safe spaces that doesn't prepare you. It's just a safe environment which you can learn, I guess when you're like Yale or Princeton, a few years ago who was like, I'm like screaming in the professor's face because he suggested something that, you know, I'm also supposed to be safe. It's a safe thing.

Speaker 8:          00:43:40       And what's not going to trigger somebody? Let's say I one time choked on cookies as a child. And you mentioned that you had cookies for lunch and now I'm triggered the fuck up. Yeah. I always want to know what the line was. What percentage of people, how to have been through something before you can, can you talk about murder? If someone's been murdered, can you talk about like what, what's not triggering to me? I know a lot of things trigger and it's also like, you know, you might get triggered, I dunno what's triggered a memory of something emotional. Yeah. And emotional association with something. Maybe I went to see a panorama last year. I went to see, uh, um, the, the festival Panoramio Sorta went right from Montreal and nine inch nails was playing. I just had a friend hang herself like three weeks before and he started doing hurt and he does it so well.

Speaker 8:          00:44:28       And I, I'm balling just because of the, are the lyrics because it's, yeah, yeah, yeah. Everyone loved goes away in the end. Just like, it's just so sad. Fucking pick Jay's daughters right next to me. Just stare at this adult fucking crying with flip flops on and uh, but like, yeah, I guess I was triggered into thinking about people that were important to me and that made me sad. But like, it's so bad. Yeah. Like what? You're allowed to be true. It's okay to be that you can be what everybody wants to feel. I think, you know, part of this is a generational pushback on the fact that care about different things. Well know that the generation before us, like our parents were raised and the whole world was like, yeah, I'm like, it's not fair. This is hurting right now. Me Emotionally, they're like, what are you fucking stupid?

Speaker 8:          00:45:18       Like yeah, that's the word they use. Stupid. Yeah, that's for sure. The word that they use, it was like magnet but different. I'm the negative. Like it's an, it tells you a mag. And partially because they, you know, they didn't know. They didn't, they never knew to be emotionally aware, basically. So if you're like, something's bothering you, you wouldn't express it. They wouldn't get it out of you. They wouldn't coach you through it because they weren't raised like that. And then we'll move into the era where they're like, hey, you can be really in touch with feelings and emotions. And then that gets heightened so much to overcompensate for an entire era where nobody did it. It feels like that's almost kind of pick up. Then the gen x or is have raised the millennials, the Gen Ed, we're gen x. We were raised by that generation that was like fuck it soldier on.

Speaker 8:          00:46:07       Put your head down. Don't talk about your feelings. So we fucked up the world basically then. Cause then we raised our kids to be like, you need to have feelings. This safe place. We a helmet. When it's an extreme, it's too much. It's too much. It's just terrible. By the way, don't call me again. I was born in 88 I don't know what you're, you're on the, you're not not millennial gen x. That's nirvana bras younger than you. I don't know what you're talking about. 79 or 80 is the cutoff. Okay, so 84 so that means for my ass, definitely younger than you.

Speaker 8:          00:46:41       I was born in 1993 I check it out. Look what I'm growing up. Your Jew Curls? No, I thought that in there and I was like, that was kind of racist to point out. Why are you doing that for? I'm doing this hour and Edinburgh. Oh, for your two hour play area. So we're trying to grow them out a little bit. My girlfriend hates it. She's like, what? Get a girlfriend. You have a girlfriend? Yeah. Wait, how do we not know this? But I don't want us, I don't know much about her. I don't want, we just had a very cutting. Tell me this. God. It's been a while. How long has it been? I don't even know. What does she do? Art Curator in New York. Yeah, you can text me this. What am I going to do fucking in the conversation and let you guys burn on me. Just fucking send me a message. I have a girlfriend. I love her so much. Gave her kisses all the time. I would never ever do that.

Speaker 8:          00:47:40       Do you guys living together in sin? Okay. First of all, the point of all this was look at these jokers. Wait, is she Jewish? No. What does she think of it? She really hates it. She's like her garbage. Does She Christian? No. Why would, I wouldn't want her to convert for me. When you guys get married getting married, he marries you. Yeah. They used to do that thing. We were like, you hit your own back, right? No. Flagellation and then you tie the tie the box you did. We tried to tie the box so tight. This was our, what? We are bad asses. We would be time. So tied that to see how many periods that would last. Like the annotation with last. Once you take them off you have to go through breakfast and first period like check it. Oh, what? What era were you the most hardcore you think in your belief? Like if somebody would ask, if somebody were to stop you and be like, Hey, are you into this? You'd be like, the fuck are you asking me? Like, of course I am. Yeah. Yeah. When I was in Israel and your Shiva and like how old were you then? 20 Oh, so 20 your your die hard. Die Hard. Wow. Died pretty. That's pretty grown up. Fuck it.

Speaker 8:          00:48:48       You were convinced to this is your path. I mean, I hadn't really thought about it. Yeah, but like for Shai, what age are you like, no, of course not. This is 21. God Damn. During, I think after I turned 21 I was really like, I think I might be out and then just done what the hardest conversation to have with family. Yeah. Probably. I remember when I had to tell my dad about being a serial rapist and that was difficult, but this was far, far harsher when you tell him that this is the worst thing to tell him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This was Harvard. I didn't believe him. He's not as hardcore as you were at 20. Right? He is. He is that hard core about that hardcore. He's sly. He's, he's like loosened up a bit. Um, like he was like, get a fucking burger if you're around me.

Speaker 8:          00:49:40       They don't curse. I'm sorry. He's, but he's like, you can get a burger. It's okay. Yeah, yeah. But like, yeah, he's like, why, what am I fighting for? You know, people, it's calmed down. Yeah. It's funny, my parents used to, I mean I didn't have anything that was intense is what you were doing, but you know, it was just never a question that you would obviously go to church on Friday obviously. So whenever I came home from college on Sunday, it was like, Hey, are you ready to go? Not even like you're coming today, right? Oh, you're ready. Ready? And like I would just go and then it's like out of college, you know, conversations like, yeah, to get phone calls. Like are you going to church out there? And I'd be like, yeah, all the time. I'm an ally. I didn't want to do the line anymore.

Speaker 8:          00:50:23       But then they came out and that would have to like find a church to go to and, and then, and it was like Christina would come with Christine would come with me home and we would go and there would be things like we'd sleep in let's say when I came home to visit. Yeah. And then it's like, uh, you know, they're like, well, you missed the, you know, the 11 o'clock and you can still make yeah. And I'd be like, yeah, we're going to try to go later. And then they would kind of check on that. Did you go? And I was like, no. And then he'll look, what am I doing? Can I just say this already? Then he would never go, well they did this thing where they would bring it like, you're not going to go to church this week or something. And it would be like, I don't think so.

Speaker 8:          00:51:09       And they were like, okay. And then locked it out, see how it played, plays, look at them. And then there was, uh, the one when I knew I would, I had actually done it, made the leap and that it was like not an issue anymore. I mean it was, this was years obviously like, you know, cutting down the time, but it was just like Sunday and they're like, or a Saturday night and they're like, um, I'm gonna pick up a coffee on the way home from thing tomorrow or like, do you want me to bring you a coffee or something? I'd be like, yeah. And they're like, okay. And then no, uh, no mention of it. No guilt. Like they would just show up and be like, got your coffee. Need, why? Argue with them? Like, do what you want to go see a movie today.

Speaker 8:          00:51:48       Like they're just not a big moment. That's a huge, where I was like, I don't have to pretend anymore. And then now like they used to, you know, always be like, are you my mom? Not My dad. My mom be like, are you praying? I was like, yeah, and now she doesn't, she doesn't even know. Sometimes she'll be like, do you think God for like all your blessings? And I'm like, oh definitely. I definitely never think my agent so, but it is funny how, I mean it's really like it does, it does. It is, you feel kind of Shitty when, when you feel like you're breaking their heart. I know it's us, but then at some point like I just can't do it for you. Kevin Meaney and my podcasts before he died, talking about coming out of the closet, a 50 years old and it was like he didn't want to hurt his dad when his dad died.

Speaker 8:          00:52:32       He could come out. But it's like she would place your entire sexual life yeah. For not being free because of offending or hurting the, but did he die of, is it cancer? Uh, I don't know. No, I'm not sure. That was like two years ago. Yeah. You don't know what he died of? I don't know. It sounds like aids. I assume it's, yeah, I think he just thought, I don't know what he died of fat too. Not like huge fat, but like, but like I had a belly on him. He's been gaining a lot of weight. Bert? Yeah. They called me and he's like, I'm getting so much. And I go, why? He was like, I ran that marathon. That was so long ago. How long do you think the afterburn last? He's like, I know, but um, hold on. This is coming out of the closet was hard on my parents.

Speaker 8:          00:53:30       But you had to do it to your parents? Yeah, no, I mean a about religion. I thought you meant it for you guys. And what were you going to show me? What he could show me? You know, I just saw that he had posted this thing. He did that, the tour with those guys over the weekend. Oh yeah. Where did he post a? Just like 48 but like, oh my God, look what a piggy Jesus, this little piggy went to disease. See it. It's like, that's big man. By the way, Canadian Berg Gatsy love this picture because they're like, oh, I'm fine. Oh, they're like, what am I, one 50 this? Yeah. I mean, it takes up most of the screens. Look, CGI is distended and everything. Yeah. It's really, it's really sad. He's real big. I mean, he must get out of the chair the way Chris Christina gets out of a chair, like pregnant belly first and then let the weight push you up. You've been going hard. I bet if we did the Wayne's right now, you'd be like, Oh fuck. I bet he wouldn't weigh on publicly right now. No, no.

Speaker 8:          00:54:28       I asked him about it recently. He was like, it's just bloat. It's bloke, it's bloat from liquor. And I'm like, so that means if you, if you stopped within like a couple of days to be back to normal. One is a bloke and he's, I don't know, become subject change. Yeah. Well that's the thing is like, it is probably directly related to that. Yeah. Which is directly related to touring right in the road. You're never going to stop. He's never going to stop touring. No, absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely not by the way. Um, I know a lot of like when Ralph, he got the stomach stapled, people were like, he needs to go see a therapist. Now sometimes it's not enough to cover up what's wrong with them. Sure. So I think a lot of what's Burt gaining that weight? It's because of the guilt. Those children.

Speaker 8:          00:55:13       I mean, cause he was working out a lot and running and then suddenly he gains weight. Right about the time he refused to give that money that he owed to the children. Yeah. Sad. We all donated for him. Yeah, we did that. Does that the uh, children's hospital. Children's hospital. Yeah. If you guys want to donate, it's a go fund me.com/evil Bert and uh, we're trying to raise the $10,000. Did he said it was going to, now he's saying, I guess now he's saying that he never even intended to give that money. Crazy. Yeah, I remember him saying and it calling me on and telling me about it. Yeah. Yeah. Oh wait, when are you doing? Uh, Edinburgh's is it August? All of August 2nd pool. Have you done it before? I've done it twice before. Do you like this? I love it. I mean, I think I'm the only American, but sounds like Bronston or people like that, that like that.

Speaker 8:          00:56:05       Like it sounds joyous. So yeah, I'm definitely one of the Americans that doesn't because I would hate to be somewhere for a month. What? What? Oh, okay. I see my beautiful. Um, they would hate to be there for a month. Yeah. Okay. Imagine I wouldn't hate being an Edinburgh, but I'd hate to be anywhere for a month. Do you have a place though? It's like a new home. But you're doing what? 30 days in a row? 25 days in a row in a row? No, I don't like that either. One day off. Ah, Monday the 13th. Why is it every fucking day, man? It's just, but it's just only an hour a day. You're free.

Speaker 1:          00:56:38       No, but you're not, you're, you're never relaxed because the whole day or thinking about your show that night, you're never really, you can't do anything at time. Where are you doing it?

Speaker 8:          00:56:46       Number for both. You are fucking faggots. There's no way. Pablo. Um, I, I did eight shows in a row like a year ago somewhere. Oh, no, no. Some were here and I was like, dude, it's a marriage. And I was like, come on, it's a marathon. It's a marathon. It is like a thing you've got to get up for, but you don't barely have to get up. And then you're, and then you have the full range of shows. Right. I guess if you're doing 25 yet, you have a heart. Do you have train wreck shows? Do you have like there are better and worse shows? For sure. For sure. For sure. Yeah. Um, but I saw those guys out there doing their fucking crazy UK theme hours. Yeah. And I was like, I saw the first year I just did my storytelling show and the next year I did my own. But just regular American, you're transitioning to a European guy and then it's like, no, I'm not sure. This comedy, you're transition. Yeah, he is. He's dog dot Tran's comic started growing your hair out.

Speaker 1:          00:57:44       How? Who would be an uglier woman? You are Tom [inaudible] or Tom, who's the Uglier Trans Woman?

Speaker 8:          00:57:50       I mean, I know what the answer is. What is it? Oh No, you do know it's done.

Speaker 1:          00:57:56       No, no, but you're so tall and you're so lanky. Tall like Grace Jones. Yeah, but your bro, like your shoulders are bony.

Speaker 8:          00:58:06       Yeah. Let me see. Hi shoulders. That means it only show weight. Do you think you'd be an attractive woman? If you are trying to think. I'd be a five and a half and me, I'd be like, I take it. You wouldn't have, you wouldn't have to be drunk to fuck me. You would have to be buzzed, but not to. What about me? No, you wouldn't have. It would be a fetish. It would be like a northern type of person. We're hideous. Yeah. Would be like, it'd be like, oh, people want to punish themselves. The same type of people who want you to shit on their chest during sex, but also want to fuck you. Have you ever, by the way, because we know God only knows the nightmares you've been involved with in your sexual history. Then with one of these absolute, have you been with a woman that's a total fucking surprise.

Speaker 8:          00:58:44       Mental case with what she likes. Oh, what she's into. Yeah. Yeah, because I imagine that you have been with just the full drags, right? Cogging come on. Do you ever go hogging what's hugging? Like where you just go out and just try to find the fattest check possible? Like AAA stuff? Yeah, it definitely allows that. Does that? Yeah. Just as a way to that. I do not go hogging. Ah, no I do not. I've wound up with a hog not knowing how it's happening at all, but I've been pheasant hunting and wound up, so wait a minute. Have you been though with a real fucking, oh my God. Yeah. I mean I almost hooked up with somebody in, in Scotland a few years ago that I was like, hmm, this might be it, dude. Oh really? Yeah. Where I had to start showing once it hit my brain, I started showing people like pictures and they were like, I could go out of the way.

Speaker 8:          00:59:33       I don't know Asian. Wait, but you saw there their junk, right? No, I didn't get, I didn't get that. Oh, have you ever had like a request though? Like I'm saying as far as, you know, not necessarily shitting on, but something where you're like, that was fucking crazy request. Uh, like bossing them around in a way, like make him crawl around on the floor and do chores for me. Ask for it. Yeah. Yeah. And then some of them, I can't give that to them enough. I'm like, I can only to meet you so much before it gets weird for me. I'm fighting Ari's a better woman. Cause he's a little nervy saying it's not a question. Yeah. Now wait a minute. Who would be worse and worse as a woman? Me? Yeah. Or Diaz. Oh, okay. Oh, this is easy. This is easy. It's, he has to be a worst woman.

Speaker 8:          01:00:18       Oh Man. Going to be the worst of all time. Maybe grow his fat is a male fat too. It's not like a, it's not, it's pushed out. You look honestly, Christina, you look like a how to draw things to see jaws shape. And then another smaller circle, circle, circle like leg circle. I'm in the very end of it. This is my due date is uh, is uh, they're doing this new thing where it's, um, well, okay, this is a fake one, but then I'll give you a real one in a second. But that were men are trying to be closer to the uh, baby by drinking the fluids, the salary, placenta. We've heard this. Yeah. This is disgusting. Can I tell you guys the most baller thing to do? The best way to show your love? Yeah. Okay. Having a baby together. Your sperm. Your Vagina. Yeah. Um, that's an a great act of love. But so sexual love, which is part of it. It's how you get there. The most baller, most sexual thing you can do [inaudible] is while Christine, interesting is giving birth. Like when she's like pushing out are fucking the baby back here. Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:01:39       Sorry. So you're saying you guys don't love each other. This is so disgusting. You say it comes out in my terms that the relationship will always be about you guys hooking up and they have to, oh, well back be quiet at the moment. How would you do it? Get under her maybe like split level bed with one of those, um, those, um, massage head things. I mean, just what is, it's very, the one take me up on, I'm going to write a blog tonight. I, social justice warrior Aries art meets him. I don't understand why you won't, it's it, just show it to me. Then the three of you closer as a family. Oh, Mike, this is pretty gross right here. Somebody wrote in, let me tell you, tell me if you ever done anything like this. So here's an email. Hey, Mommy's, uh, I recently had something new happen with my girlfriend when we were having sex.

Speaker 8:          01:02:35       I had to pee really bad before we started having sex. Oh, we'll start to get into it. And I was like, fuck it. The peak and wait, I've got a boner and it needs attention. So we start to bang and after about 22 to 24, good through us, I shoot my load into my girl's vagina immediately following this in voluntarily start peeing and her as well as you would expect. She was not happy that I emptied my urine load into her and we haven't spoken in days. I'm pretty sure she's getting ready to move out. If you ever heard of this happening before, does it have a name? I told my friends and we settled on all nerd, an Arnold Palmer half and half, half p half come to any thoughts on how to avoid this happening? Case series. Thanks. You guys are the best. Try it out.

Speaker 8:          01:03:21       Dr Nick. Yeah, I have an idea on how you can avoid this out of the bathroom. Just take a leak and uh, that's it. That's the end of my explanation. Joy to paint is oh no, no, no. I mean I wonder how bad he had to pee. If it was like if it was a 10 and he rejected it and then his body was really like, you have to empty this right now. That's the only way I can imagine not being able to control. Once you do it, can't pinch dreadful. Let it all go out. Right. Why did you say your food? You're pissing, can't you just pull out and pee on the bed versus ego like, Hey, that's a lot of calm. A lot of conflict may be filling you up. And he's like, hold on, don't move. Which is like, um, how gross would it be to have BPD a shit rude. It's rude.

Speaker 8:          01:04:11       I'd be so upset. I mean, you know better than, because it would probably, what would it do to you? I could give you all kinds of infections. I'm shutting her out too. Yeah, we could try it out. Yeah. It's like athlete's foot of the Pussy. That's a piss on it. He's done it before this. Inside a vagina. Yeah. No, but I have docked with a dude and piss. We've both pissed inch in each other's holes. What ice cream cones together with rocky road is put on a peppermint. Does this, that year 20 in Israel? Um, no. I've never pissed inside a woman done that. No. You have to make a decision. Like I maybe got lost in it. I'm like, well this is already going in there. I'll keep going. How would you empty at handstand? Walking with her legs up to the bathroom to empty. Yet afterwards. That falls on the bat, but then why? Why not just pull out in the first place? That's what I'm saying. I mean I think we're all in agreement. This man made an error just as a bad thing to do. You don't want to do this. I mean I could see this breaking up. Your question

Speaker 7:          01:05:18       for your area, would you, if you're super broke, what'd you sell your shit to somebody like would you shut up his bag and then like sell it to somebody or would you shit through a hole in a hammock and led that person eat your shit. Do what I'm saying like a really all you're doing is something you do anyways, but someone else's really enjoying it. Listen, I don't want to like be a broken record on this podcast, but it's kind of the same as that fucker. Would you rather with big retarded. I mean I want to do that anyway. I want to shit in the stomach. You do. If we could get a hammock situation where you get somebody pay me all the better because then you're a good crowd. You know you got free tickets, you're not as good at crowd but you pay me and I shit in your mouth. I went have to be broke. I'm saying I'm down for that. Would you let someone shit in your mouth and absolutely not. No. For 100 bucks though.

Speaker 7:          01:06:16       Sure. Blocks? No, no. Come on. Sit down. They have my card is McAfee got sick. I didn't agree with that. She's talking about Hardwick. Yeah. It's a no brainer for you. I would for sure would you not the first time I'd be embarrassed at first she likes it and never had done that. She texts growlers till you can sound to shifting his mouth. I feel like every time is that easy but yeah, there's money on the table. Every time I take a shit without somebody there and you save water on water flush constantly. I think also she probably got to the point that one was probably like, just have breakfast. I got to get over it. Mcafee's house.

Speaker 7:          01:07:43       Is he jerking off all this happening? Well, they don't talk about this, but we always assume that has to be tight. They'll reveal secrets. Tiger lover. I think it has to. It has to be yes. So yeah, cause I can't just be the joy of having it in your mouth or I could be, it's good to be that fantastic. But isn't there some sexual gratification there? Hassle if he's not jerking it in front of them as they share. Yeah. But then he's waiting, I'm sure a later jerk off course. Yeah. I wonder how you'd, how you build that fetish. That's what would that one really, I mean, you would have to happen by accident. Like this guy, that word in. I mean that was all, that's all he could do. This is how girls, that's interesting. So it's, it's an accidental thing and then you're like, oh wow, this is a doorway to something I'm really interested at. My name is

Speaker 9:          01:08:27       John McAfee.

Speaker 7:          01:08:45       Is that a fan? Yeah, somebody, man. That's great. Could you use your time

Speaker 9:          01:08:51       escaping dad? He always missed John. Man. It was fucking readmitted. Make

Speaker 7:          01:09:04       good ones. That's, um, yeah, he's nasty. He's fucked up man. You just net bro. Ever done crystal meth? Ari? I would like to you can you live in the city? They sell it. Did we found a bag of fucking drugs at this festival last weekend, two weekends ago. And it was just like, oh, what are we going to do? Did you take him? No. So we have to find it on the road back to camping at, at firefly. So we're like going back to where everybody camps. It's guy's such a psycho stopped. They're just hell. I was a miserable. It looked down, there's a Baggie full bag. And I went to tie my shoes and fucking palmed it did, there's powder pills, everything powder. This powder. It's one of those little tiny drawbacks, you know? And uh, so our, our buddy that was there with us, he's, he's just the trier.

Speaker 7:          01:09:55       So we're a luck. Let's give it to him. Let's give it to him and see what he, he tried. It goes, it's either really shitty coke or amazing coke. Oh. Like he didn't know and we didn't know what to do with. Should take it or not. And what happened? His girlfriend was like, do not take it. We have other drugs. We brought other drugs to do, we don't need to do this fucking street drug. And um, we ended up just doing the other drugs. Yeah. I wouldn't take drugs. I'd found on the, on the ground. I normally would not. What do you, do you stick to just like psychedelic stuff or do you fuck with it too Molly? Sometimes ketamine once in awhile. Yeah. That's more recent. That's pretty fun. One. I Dunno, but I want to try heroin. Would you want to try heroin?

Yeah. I get what you're saying. Don't you want to, so are you going to have, but what about just another opioid, but why don't you, why don't you go straight to heroin? Just try something else. I mean, what's a, I'll try shit. Was it methadone? Methadone's right. So I'm saying I don't want to do oxy and say it's like, just like heroin. I'm like, let you fucking try heroin and tell you what's like heroin needle and really start going, no bro. No, I don't want to go needle right away and like smoke it. Smoke done that accidentally

You just piss on your courtship Porta potties. They're everywhere. I know. Civilized people do. I'm asking you about. Oh yeah, they all do that. Or I'll pee in this in this actually this fucking thing. Yeah, that'll MTL later. Wash it out.

Speaker 1:          01:13:19       Oh, why not? And then drink water out of it later. Not right away, but yeah, later. Shove your Dick and misty. It's wide mouth that gets right. Okay guys, you've got no, you've got no vacuum. Splashbacks situation. Yeah. Are you one of those guys at pease and cops in your house?

Speaker 8:          01:13:35       Oh, hi guys. I'm a fucking grown up. I pay one of the house too and it bottle. You got the toilet a lot of times. Yeah. Most of your ps are in toilet. Oh yeah, those at all.

Speaker 1:          01:13:47       Now do you fart in front of your girlfriend?

Speaker 8:          01:13:49       No. But will there be a fart barrier that you break at some point you think [inaudible] I try to time shit and the shower. You and I are both in the same boat on that? Yeah. The shit show crew. Does she know about that? Uh, not completely, but she says, she mentioned offhand that like what's your morning ritual? Why you in the shower so long? If I almost that just running cold water while I fully shit and then so you can't the fucking gone,

Speaker 7:          01:14:12       they might come out and you know, then I cup a handful of this is maybe different from you. A couple of handful coat it with toilet paper to catch the blood droppings and then make my way to the shower, turn the hot on and then bleed out in the shower. Did she know about, has she seen the Juke lamb? She does not. No she doesn't. I would tell her not to watch that. All right. Yeah. For Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown bread. Oh he's got that Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown. You know what you need. You need a washlet Bobby Kelly for the first time, just like yours. And I really used it. I used to it. You move it up and down, you've shifted right? Left like a claw for your ass. It's great. But the only problem with that is as a bleeder, I don't know when it's just water dripping back down off it or it's still bleeding out.

Speaker 7:          01:15:12       Well then you can take an exploratory. Why do you ever check that thing out with a doctor? He said it's cool to go, good to go. We don't mean good stuff. Yeah. Then it slows down, but sometimes, most of the time, sometimes it just keeps going. When does that happen? I don't know. I think it might be spicy food and mature and so I'll walk around often with just a plug up my bud. What do you mean? Yes, like a Tampon, but just rolled up toilet paper half in. Mostly out, soaking up the fuck you. So is it soaked with, uh, I was on jury duty last year and it soak through to the pants. Underwear. You gotta try Maxi pads or at small Tampon? Try Maxi Pad. I'll do, wait a minute, is that okay? That was not okay with to my doctor. I'm like, are you sure we shouldn't do something?

Speaker 7:          01:16:24       And goes, it's a operation. So fucking annoying and awful, but I'm almost to the point where I'm like, I'm just going to get it. You gotta you gotta get it. Might not even doing anything. You could do a new European hour on it, you know, trans, trans, trans comic hour. Do you know what they're trying to get people to say now instead of trans, because they're saying trans is or like, uh, it's like, uh, they're saying one just do short and things. It's like negative. They want everyone to call them.

I mean, I wouldn't give up spots for it, but it was a daytime thing and a city I'm in and I start our radio day. Yeah. Oh, maybe you'd go, that's a little bit

Speaker 11:         01:24:00       borough North Carolina. Are you still live there? I mean it's from all over the world here. This is the largest,

Speaker 7:          01:24:06       he lives in Greensboro. Yeah. So fourth grade. Huh?

Speaker 11:         01:24:10       First herb meetup ever

Speaker 7:          01:24:13       Marie meetup as global. Cause they got one, one lady from Afghanistan I this harmless. Yeah. You think so? One of us. I mean, except for the extensive abuse that what if that would, if they were abusing them, like the fucking Michigan State guy was somebody to meet me up at this beautiful, nice thing and it's like, oh no, it's ruined.

Speaker 11:         01:24:33       I've made these tails right here. They make their own trails. Don't tell anybody. They take me over four months. My Tales of our range from 2,902 her gown tail and it gets swimming.

Speaker 7:          01:24:49       Wow. You think it's hurting anybody? Oh No, he is hurting anybody. I mean, I think it's, it's beyond absurd. I wouldn't see that walk. I don't want to see them like they're like, ah, oh yeah, sure. I could walk in this thing that's been taught by grand for it. I mean it's for children, the children for children, but a good, that's an adult

Speaker 11:         01:25:10       weighs 50 pounds, 50th neutrally buoyant. That's important.

Speaker 7:          01:25:18       What do you mean? How many fuck ups do you think happened during the day while they're deciding to do? It's like, oh right. It was 90 pounds. We did lose a few people. Yeah. When people were drying up, we didn't pay her last merger mania. We lost a few of our fellow Mermaids, but what did they do? They just put on there nice couture gowns and then swim around with each other and then look at each other and that's the whole point. But he's just a convention pool, like a bunch of fucking nerds in a pool. That's what it is. Four years ago I discovered that there was other word bracelets. People bad. We're in love with Mermaids as I was as easy as the girls. You see a mermaid, like everybody's like, oh, how beautiful. But you see a guy and there they're kind of, yeah, of course. Yeah. Yeah. But also like how often

Speaker 8:          01:26:04       are you seeing people see mermaids where you're making this decision? Yeah. It doesn't happen all the time. Yeah. I feel like your data points are not enough. This guy, he really, I mean the crazy thing is you get this level of heterosexuality in the Merman industry. It's very weird. I still don't know how people have time for this shit. That's always a thing. As an adult, you don't have a fucking job. A mortgage. Kids like I have the answers for your mermaid. Yeah. Where are you making time for these kind of hot Megan Megan Tales for four months. I mean even for him to go down to the pool with the fucking crown and they make on and you've got to rent out the whole pool or can you, this seems like a giant pool and you get half and half with my kids. I don't know. Seems like other like serious swimmers Beck.

Speaker 8:          01:26:49       You guys got to get the fuck out. It's five o'clock now. Get Out. We're doing laps. Yeah. Take your, your come fins Outta here so I can work out. Yeah. Yeah. This is just a different version of wild, wild west. Get them out of, he's clearly, he's straight, so I think, yeah. Well do you think he's there? He's in it for the girls. The in which case that's a good bracket. It's a good, how are you going to get laid when everyone's wearing a fucking tail over your vagina? Yeah. It's not, it's not thought out. It just comes when they're like, when it's time to like, hey, let's, let's go look at our tails together in my room. It's a flop around like wherever the water,

Speaker 11:         01:27:22       other Merman

Speaker 8:          01:27:24       have the world talk to share the love of the seat in it and a bunch of dams. Yeah. I'll have to do is it, don't like kids doing this. That's cool.

Speaker 11:         01:27:36       When I first started doing this mermaid thing, there was no one else in the world that was doing it as a freelance job. And it is a child to look around and see that there's hundreds, thousands of roommates around the world. How do you know that I'm living? I agree. How would you know what no one else is doing it? Freelance. We have something super positive to awesome.

Speaker 8:          01:27:54       That would be so disappointing about like meeting her. There's no fat mermaid. She's a murderer. Met this girl at a bar or something and you have no idea. Yeah. You like, she's cute. Oh that's articulate. Yeah. And then she's like, I got this thing this weekend. I don't know if you want to come check it out. And you're like, yeah, what is what? I'm interested in your interests. I'm a mermaid. And then like all yours, you're a fucking red flags. Kinda going like fuck you. I'll be like all your fucking hat. I have a male ready to go out and it just flags up flags up. This is, this isn't going to go anywhere. This thing. Well and also she claims to be the world's first freelance mermaid. But yeah. How does she know that? Well, because before this, it was only people who did it for a living. They got four one ks and no one was able to really shift this around a time where you up time, all freelance. She's a freelancer.

Speaker 11:         01:28:46       Thousands of roommates around the world now.

Speaker 8:          01:28:49       Hundreds of thousands. I don't know.

Speaker 11:         01:28:51       No living from doing this beautiful art form art

Speaker 8:          01:28:55       form. I mean, Pete, how does she know? She's the first machine still drown at every convention, but every week it better.

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       Yeah. There's a big one there. Big Old Merc.

Speaker 7:          01:29:07       Wow. Back to the birthplace of all life itself, which is the Ocean Mermaid accent.

Speaker 3:          01:29:19       Well, no, but wait, we need this to reconnect

Speaker 7:          01:29:24       with water. You know, you can just go ahead. It also doesn't give you breathing ability. So scuba diving is nice as well. Uh, snorkeling, swimming. I just want to say you're both jerks.

Speaker 3:          01:29:37       That's a nice thing. People were getting together for a nice time and you guys were just were just bullies. Yeah. You're just, you're just terrible.

Speaker 7:          01:29:48       Seems like it really, I think what angers by five another Merman is going through a 65 five another merman. And the kid was like, Yo you sorry your buddy. I knew you were here. I didn't choose to say anything. It just anchors me that it's adults like grown people wasting their time with this horse shit. Do you think it's the same as a kickball league or dodge balls? 35 year olds. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:30:16       So you know, uh,

Speaker 7:          01:30:18       bangs on, it's like stop it gross.
