It's different, but I think it's a gallon of any fluid shouldn't do that and so I was going to knock it out. I'm just drinking like I don't want to drink. Oh Bull Shit. Bull Shit. I've known you for so long. So look at this. Look at the Burke shaved.

Speaker 10:         00:11:41       He looks worse than I thought. You got it. You got to grow it back, dude.

Speaker 8:          00:11:50       Got To get that mouth, Huh? Little checklists and then he's got a one big one though. No, that, yeah, that I tried and stick in the front. Yeah. That thing. That's how you start your apples right there. You got that. You going to get anything going? I think he has two or three on the bottom and that's it. It is amazing that this guy decides that he is going to motivate people to strive to be that best. He's not even motivated to get his teeth fixed. He's not motivated for shit. He's only motivation was to turn a camera on. But that's the thing, right? He's clearly got a lot of things to work and you got really fired up in this thing. You know he's real fat and sweaty. If you do not thrive, thrive, or strive to add some more teeth, we know the answer cause you're supposed to strive to be the best when you're missing teeth versus, and you strive to be the best. Thrive. Thrive. If you do not drive fry her, don't be the greatest tape. We'll accomplish nothing. That's true actually. Gladly. Do you cause this guy? Where'd you find him?

Speaker 7:          00:13:19       On Instagram. And I don't even put it motivated the shit out of me that day I was sitting around in the hotel and wet and that sac and I go, I'm gonna hit the gym. Yeah. And the dentist. Yeah. Did you make that boy, I bought some floss right away. Jesus. I'm not as bad. Look, there's a lot to go over, but we should point out the fact that we got new shirts on dude.

Speaker 8:          00:13:42       Oh

Speaker 7:          00:13:43       we did it. This has been a dream and we finally achieved that. It had happened were wearing double pipe of classic shirts. Look at that design. Very rare. Very rare is the tag. And um, this is no shit. You know, a top dog obviously contributed to, uh, this, this design coming along and sharing his, his expertise on them. Yeah. And then last week after we recorded the show, right, we had lunch downstairs, sat down. And if you go to Christina's Instagram, yeah, you can see me. I got a thumb up and a thumbs down. It happened. I had a double pipe classic in front of her. And Ah, I mean, I watched you cry for anything. So station. Yeah. It was [inaudible] son was there to witness, you know, that I looked at the photo and I realized I'm in shock in the photo. Right. I go like, oh, like if you can see my face, I'm like, why? Right. It just happened. What's just right. And I noted the time, even on the Instagram post. Yeah. Uh, that it happened. It was incredible. Really incredible.

Speaker 8:          00:14:46       Well, and what's funny is that it, you know, like with all double pipe classics,

Speaker 2:          00:14:51       it's a surprise. You know, you think you're just going to burp or you're just going to fart and then it happens and it, you know, and it's like you don't really, right. Yeah, that's right after it happened. Look at your posts. Right? 3:17 PM. June 20th, 2016. I witness Tom having a double five classic. They're extremely rare and you can't force them. You can't make it rain. Look at the shock. Yeah. The Dutch is, look how thin you are there. Look how skinny you look. I know some people that don't look, that is um, that's the moment man. That was right right after it happened. Yeah. So we now have a double pipe, classic shirts. They're uh, uh, your mom's house, podcast.com there also, uh, in, in my store, Thomson [inaudible] Dot Com if you go to the shop page, it's also there and it's just really exciting. Now, do you remember, I remember you were kind of leaning over because you were, I just think how did it have such a magical moment?

Speaker 2:          00:15:49       We had, I think it was towards the end of lunch ordered Sushi and um, just finished wrapping it up. And I, I remember feeling which was what did I feel coming first. I think I felt the fart brewing and cause that's when you leaned over and it looks impressive as I leaned over, came out of the top of the same time. And it was, it wasn't, you know, that's the thing. It's not burp fart. It's not fart. Burp both. Boom. That's why it's so rare. That's why we wrote very rare because gas usually chooses a path that goes, I'm going up or I'm going down. Right. And the thing that happens with every double pipe classic is that you don't immediately know it happened because you're in shock. So when you did it, hence like you did it and we both went, oh, that was a double pipe.

Speaker 2:          00:16:42       Yeah. Yeah. They're just, they are so rare. And it was so neat that it happened right after we had just discussed it. And Yeah, I dunno. It's an amazing thing for me too, is that it's really even more rare if I could say so to have a witness for one, sometimes you're alone and it's like, oh, you did. Yeah, sure. Yeah. But when you have a witness, there's no one can take it away from you. That's true. You know, it's like your college education and your double pipes. Yeah. People are there for it. So it was really, really something and we're very excited. We're very excited and wanted a double pipe, classic shirt. And then this, this is the one man, this is very rarely nice material off to it fits like a glove. I love it. Shipping is included for all domestic offers. That's true. That's true. I have, what's great about this shirt too is that it's on the down low. You know, only other monies are really going to get it right. And it doesn't say like Fart on it. It's kind of subtle. Some people, when I picked it up from the shirt

Speaker 8:          00:17:50       place, the guy was asking me, he's like, is this like a like an x games event or something really, really bad. Did you Clinton? Yeah. What did he say? It was like, oh, better the next games. Yeah, you should send this to Tony Hawk. Alright. Alright. Pipe. Right. So they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Similar, but not really. I bet he's probably like, Ooh, I wish I could have one of those. Wish I could have a double pipe classic. Maybe you will sir, if you live long enough, if you pray hard enough, he just has to live long enough. I think that is the secret. And don't force it. Just be open to what happened. I want to say I had one in 2015 and I want to say, I don't remember when it happened. I don't think you did. Well maybe 2014 2014 yeah. So that's how long? Two years man. Yeah, he up anyways.

Speaker 11:         00:18:39       Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:18:39       You know, it's just because I just, I think you're really lucky in that you married someone who thinks that burps and farts are super funny. But I really like when you burp and make a sound like you just did, like, like when you go, Yup. Or like, just, especially when you're doing in front of your mom in Florida or when she's around, she's like, ah, and she's coming, you know? I know. Yeah. Yeah. I love it. Cause she gets mad at you for Bourbon and then she gets mad at me for laughing at your birth. So it's like we get a double upset. Charl yeah. I'm going to try to get her in here just to talk to her for awhile. Yup. Yup. I'll do some verbs in front of her just to get her to go. Because when, no matter how much I hate, no matter how much I hate you or we're fighting, if you go, Yup.

Speaker 8:          00:19:34       It makes me laugh every time. No matter how much I hate. Look how you might get for fighting or something. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Oh No, no, no. Um, so who was this guy? This guy you're going to fall. So in love with it, I promise you are so toothy old old TUPE tubes. Oh, got me thinking about motivation. And then I also saw this guy, oddly enough also on instant saw part of this. Yeah. And so I had a blue band pull it, just, um, just give him a lift. And His name is Daniel Pena and he's a businessman who also is a, uh, a coach, like a mentor to people in the business world. Okay. And this is that one of his seminars.

Do you get people that want to leave? Do you get people that want to cry? Just talking about, so this guy, he lives in a castle in Scotland. Oh cool. In your opinion. Does good for the winter. That's why. And people pay a lot of money to go and sit in like that room that you, you heard him telling people you're fucking poor that's at his castle. I love it. So these are people who, you know, his story is that he turned, uh, I think it was $8 into 430 million so that he had, he was some high ranking executive and an oil company. And I dunno, he's been a, he's been a coach for business people, but he just has this persona, you know, sort of some people cause you can tell not to push him.

She's putting this lady grocery bags all over trees. You understand him? Horrible. Must not look in her house. You got to give some to to the animals. So that's the way it works. It's like animals get away with that shit. Squirrels. They're probably suffocating. No, I'm just like, oh, thanks a lot. That's how I live. I eat. You're so funny. So she's got a crazy tree with bags on it right now. Oh yeah. What a fucking not yeah, immigrants, man. They don't give a fuck. They do everything crazy style by the way. Funny salivate. You have a lot. I, there's a strong, there's a strong backlash against you in the the water championship. How are we going to fuck up? Yeah, I think we should. Um, so we put a poll out there. Oh fuck. Off to see on these losers. A bunch of fucking losers. I answered you. Okay. It's fine. It's over. Now. The 69% time, 31% jeans. Um, why don't you ask fucking Daniel and your Lincoln Den. A lot of people feel like you know that you can't be trusted for a number of reasons.

Speaker 7:          00:35:02       Here's an, here's an example. Uh, Tom is the best. He's not a big fat liar. Like the non main mommy. Eight oh eight. Remember that wasn't a lie. That was just misinformation. I did not know. And then deliberately lie, obviously bigger gulps. That's cause you're bigger. You're just a bigger animal than me. Big, stupid, stinky, dumb bear. The water champion drinks more water necessarily because you drink less frequently, uh, than I do even though I sit all day. But how is this even a debate? The hair? Is this even a question

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       Tom was taking bigger steps? No, hence what this is the tortoise and the historical evidence. Your honor, your honor. Look at the physical evidence. Your honor. This is what's known as a, it's a long race. It's a marathon that I run. Okay. You do your sprints and I'm in for the long haul. Bitch. The tortoise wins says put genes. Key is the SIP chain, but pure water intake, it's buns all day. Go Fuck yourself and your, your stupid fucking Twitter followers. You know what? I actually feel like I actually feel like maybe, okay, maybe you agree with them. I think you agree with them. Now I'm not even going to, I think you maybe that I am the water champion. I think you think I'm water champion. I think here's the evidence. Are you hydrating after your boxing of at me? I have two liter and a half of water.

Speaker 2:          00:36:31       Got To hydrate soldier. You know, hydrating isn't just for graduates. The Florida graduate. Oh, people want to hear that you drink like an animal. That was one swag for Tommy, that that amount that you just drank. And I could never do that in one. Not In one swoop. You drink like a bear. Okay, so what is, I just said that now and that's historical. So what you're saying, Tom, you're the water champion. Did not say that. I said I could not do that because I'm, I don't weigh whatever it is. You and Bert collectively way I don't have the big stomachs like you and Bert. So you're not drinking enough water. No, I am. I'm just, it's a slow burn. What did I tell you? It's a marathon. You're sprinting. That's what fucking dilettante water drinkers do. Like yourself? No, you could never drink as much water.

Speaker 2:          00:37:21       Well, let's over the course of a few, your honor, your honor, maybe a few days. Let me allow me to introduce my evidence from Twitter. J at big Jay savage rights. If Tom had enough water, he wouldn't be Dj dad mouth. It's because you're so dehydrated and smelly from drinking coffee and not enough water. That's why our Dj Dad mouth. That's not true. It's not true. I'm the water champion. First of all, I appreciate you voting me the water champion. I'll never let you down. I'll continue to drink far more water seen it could ever drink. This poll is rigged. I don't believe for a minute that that the listeners thing at the end of the day, your rig at the end of the day though, who has drank more water, this is nonsense. I swear to God I do. Can I tell you why? Last night before we went to bed, I had by my bed stand to full avi-on bottles.

Speaker 2:          00:38:11       What did you have next to your bed to drink at night, Tom? Now you're just showing off. This is all for the cameras. You know that he never does this when the cameras are off. Tom, how much water did you have next to your bed last night? I guess it was like a liter and a half. No wrong. A tiny little shitty cup. A mug. You could never drink as much water. Okay. Okay. I just had another report and from uh, someone who went to see you in west Nyack. Okay. That Tom didn't drink water at the entire time. He was on stage and that's at least an hour that had gone by. No, it's true. It's on Twitter versus well you must be severely dehydrated because you're sweating up there and you're moving and you do your routine where you pretend to have sex with a stool and you like Bruce Bruce.

Speaker 2:          00:39:02       Do you have the towel? You're always sweating. I drink so much water after sets. As soon as I get offstage I drink, I dunno cause you're dehydrated. Severely notes from all of the talking. I'll drink like 16 after a show and people, those of us that hydrate properly, consistently throughout the day bring the water on stage. You need to work on your concession speech. That's it. I competed. I lost. And your nominee is, can I send you a photograph? I sent you a photograph but I'd like to pull it up right now your honor. Okay. This is the photo. That's what you're saying. That's what the word photograph is. Shore photo is a shortened version of photograph. What the fuck is this? This is a picture of me when I was born. Could you please pull it up as evidence of what's happening? What does it show you?

Speaker 2:          00:39:52       What does I do in the minute I came out of my mother? What am I doing? Yeah, you have what? You're holding a bottle of water. This is so unnecessary. Why? Graphic evidence? This is me being born and I already have water in my hand right now. Don't believe that. I don't believe it and I'm going to fight this verdict. You're fucking Bernie Sanders right now. I have the nomination. You're George Bush. No, I have the vote. I have the votes. This is Florida. I demand a recount are in. I demand a recount. This is the Chad. This is a hanging Chad. I don't know who these people are and it doesn't. There's not enough water. That's you. That's you right now I will give you this puny fake Twitter fan. Loser. Victory.

Speaker 2:          00:40:45       Fake. The the, the voting. No, that was, that was real. I don't care. Listen, I was like 1200 people but 1200 listen, I'll give you your stupid loser Twitter poll. Like everybody, 1,348 votes. You lost by it a lot. Okay? You know what? I'll give you this bullshit victory today. Why is it a bullshit Vic? Cause it's fucking wrong bro. You don't know the truth bomb. You know why you're a fucking loser. You drink water with losers. Okay. At least I drink wine. I don't know where your office is locked up. This is all for show guys. His his bullshit water jug. Which blue band picked up for you on the way in? Don't think I don't fucking notice that because I, that shit was cold. It wasn't in our fridge. No, it wasn't in our fridge. Not True. Hello?

Speaker 8:          00:41:35       I always ask who gets the Sparkletts in the house? Who makes sure that shows up? Who orders bottled water so that you can hydrate properly. So sad to see somebody just treading water that they can't drink. There's a video. I have a view in west Nyack. This is for now to, okay, well I'm just letting you know that someone saw you in west Nyack and they took it again. They took footage of you. He didn't know you were being watched. Okay, here we go.

Speaker 9:          00:42:37       Tom,

Speaker 8:          00:43:05       why you that lady's car? I want this lady. I've never said this, but I want her to get eaten by a bear so badly. She's trying to reason with the bear. This is the most part. If that camera could of kept rolling and he'd just devoured her mind. That funny documentary we watched hilarious dot Timothy Treadwell. That's right. That's how I know you and I would be married, but it was retarded you. When I went to see that documentary when we were just dating and the Timothy Treadwell, what was it called? Grizzly man. And we saw it in the theaters. Narrator, the director. I remember the German got Santa hats on down now. And there is a part where the guy goes, yeah, we thought we just thought Timothy was retarded and you and I laughed out loud together and no one else, no one else lives here.

Speaker 8:          00:43:50       And when he got mall, we were dating. It was a dating period. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I was like this guy, the whole time he was talking about it and so many bears on that, like he'd make those videos were like, this is fucking down. And then Verna was like, there was a special connection, no Canadian in the bank. The connection was the bear was going to eat you this guy. He was like, yeah, this is my little Fox Fox. He had one of those things like a fucking eight year old woman that gets a bird and calls it like Birdie, you know, this is bear bear box. He so dumb. He was living on a bare reserve and he thought he was protecting the bears. Frog will fight for these barriers. It was a crazy person.

Speaker 7:          00:44:32       Totally agree. Yeah. Being out with dangerous bears and then he got eaten by them. Yeah. What a shocker. Yeah. Big Dummy. Big fucking dummy hanging out with losers and he got eaten by them. Absolutely. Um, let's get into this real quick. A update on Burton and his fatness. God, no. So never, never. It just keeps morphing into something better. You know, we owe it to the listeners and everybody to play a lot, uh, uh, of Bert. Yeah. You know, people think that we're, you know, we're best buddies, man. I think people need to know that this is not a one sided things. Right. We're bringing you the other side of the coin. Here's Burt on a, hey Jay hawks podcast, the hot cast, uh, Kinda filling him in on, on some of this stuff.

Speaker 14:         00:45:24       Incompetence. I tell him I'm the fattest I've ever been getting. Buns shares that with everybody. God dammit. Burt looks like Gerard. Depardieu so to be, that's right.

Speaker 7:          00:45:35       That was a few months ago. But to be fair, I want to say this. He did not say in confidence. He started making videos. I'm the fattest I've ever been. Right. It was public about it and he was weighing himself on, like weighing himself on videos. Yeah. Sang that. So it wasn't, that's the bird has a way of twisting, you know? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He was making, I'm so fat,

Speaker 14:         00:45:58       trying to lose weight. My agent called at one point it was like, hey, you're trending right behind Kesha and Amy Schumer and fat shaming.

Speaker 9:          00:46:08       Okay,

Speaker 14:         00:46:09       Georgia might, my 12 girl pulled me aside and goes, Daddy, people say really mean things to you online and I go, baby, it's not real. It's not. The Internet's not real. I go in my head, I'm like, I go there. My fans too, but then part of me is like RNA.

Speaker 9:          00:46:25       Okay,

Speaker 14:         00:46:26       no. Here's the thing. Here's the thing you can do right now is I am overweight like I am. The second fatness I'd ever been in my life. The second by second bedroom. Oh, only second to the time I told Tom Campaign, oh man, she's a hammer and booster. Like Liam's got a lot of one that's like bird looks dark. Gerard Gerard Depardieu. Apparently we have some similarities.

Speaker 7:          00:47:02       Remember that naked? It was a nude photo, nude photo where they, they did look, he has a similar bloated, distended, swollen. Now Gerard is a little bit bigger. I'll give him that, but not by much, but now by a lot, maybe five pounds. I'm six feet. You're six one like that kind of thing.

Speaker 14:         00:47:20       Yeah, I think they put the meme together. Would it put your face on his bottom? And there are barely a lot of fat babies that look a lot like God. It's Co, you know, Tom and I find it more funny than not, especially when like a publicist is like, hey, you're not getting a lot of good feedback on the show. And I was like, really? She's like, all anyone can tell yourself that is they don't technically fat shame the fattest people, big fat shame. The people who were on the fence of like notes happened. No one really says it to me, but he's not just talking about us. I think he's talking about fat shaming. People get fat shamed on the cusp of obesity or people who you know, shouldn't be fat. That's how it goes. I mean, that's all the stuff. Like when I get, I've got, uh, a lot of fat comments over the years and people who are like, you're a piece of shit. You should be, you shouldn't be this fat. Not like you're 400 pounds. They're just like stop being lazy. Cases that are like well into four or 500 people, you're dying. You don't see people bombard those people because they already feel like shit and I imagine when you're, that big shit goes down and I just want to eat.

Speaker 14:         00:48:52       That's a guy who doesn't get it. Why are you, what are you talking about? I want to get this to stop it. I want to get skinnier than Tom. I am skinnier than he is not. He is not skinny in good shape. Oh my God. Everyone who was here and I go, hey, we weighed the same. Does it look different? He's, yeah, he's in such good shape. He's never been out of shape. You know what I mean? That's a lifetime of never being out of shape. Does Burt actually way, like what do you, what are you guessing? What do I think he was? I Dunno. Three. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Boys weights now probably three ten three times. You're putting all this morning now. I feel bad. I don't know if many people, I haven't heard much from him. He had me do a little promo. Wait, look at Birch reaction when he finds out though. This is the best. So you're putting all this, I mean, now I feel bad. I don't know if any people I haven't heard much from, he had me do a little promo for Chrysler. Chrysler burnt. Yeah. There's more, sorry, how old is age? He's probably 32. 33. Did they look amazing? Yeah. You keep saying, you know why I keep saying that in relation to bloated alcoholic bird is what I'm saying. No, of course he looks amazing. He's a professional athlete. He's right. But that's

Speaker 7:          00:50:27       clean living, that's not drinking wine and like being in like, he, you know, started playing sports probably like in, you know, elementary school. Right. And literally at the 32 year old man has never stopped. Wow. That's being like on sports teams. Like, yeah. Just, uh, just, it never ended up, that's what I'm saying. Remember in highlights magazine? Goofus and gallant. Yeah. One's doing the wrong thing. Oh yeah. That's definitely this. Yeah. Yeah. And it's so apparent who's doing the right thing here. Oh, it's all, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 14:         00:51:00       That latest blog he did was so damn funny. There's a moment if even go to is I didn't give it to his youtube page, Thompson era. There's a moment where he gets on a scale, just looks download scammy goes 200.

Speaker 9:          00:51:16       Oh,

Speaker 7:          00:51:22       you guys should watch that blog. It's great blue boy. Or is it a shot and edited? It's on Tom Cigarettes. Go to Youtube, uh, into the Thomson [inaudible] Youtube page. Hilarious.

Speaker 14:         00:51:33       I said to my therapist, I go, if I had a nickel for every time. I said, it's a joke guys. It's a joke now you say it so much that you start going, is it a joke? Is this a joke? Are they my fam?

Speaker 7:          00:51:45       They are, I think it's loud. People love them. Some people was, look, I've gotten a little bit of the reversal, so people are really cutting and like me and you're like, Jesus. You know? Yeah. I've gotten a few of those, but most people are kind of clever. This is what comics do. They shit on each other all the time. This is part of the, it's, it doesn't mean anything. Not yet

Speaker 14:         00:52:07       called me. And he goes, he goes, hey man, I gotta do something because I really, I'm starting to feel bad. And I go, don't, I go, Tom, don't do any, I can't have you. It'll make it a mouse. I can't have you come out the front door. What? I'm going to fight with my mom and an apron and be like, guys, split it up or I'm going to have to call your mom, you know? And so I go, Tom, this has, I go, we've got to take this to the end. And you got to ride this all the way to the fucking ground. And if it means our careers, it means our fucking weird. We're taking this all the way, right?

Speaker 7:          00:52:39       I did. I felt bad. But then there's, yeah.

Speaker 14:         00:52:41       And my only goal right now is to beat Tom, is to be skinnier than Tom.

Speaker 7:          00:52:46       Oh Wow. Is that really, you think he's really gonna how long do you think that's going to last until he goes on the road again? Oh Man. And then he has to drink. Well, he never is off the road, so I'll always stay ahead of them. Of course. Cause even like, of course I'm on the road and you know, my, I tell you my regimen, like I call you, I go, Oh, you know, I got the show in a few hours going to the gym. Yeah. Spend like an hour there, shower. It's never going to, that takes discipline. Right, right. Yeah, that's a FIFO dreaming. He also went on punch drunk and uh, it was really funny with Jason. Jason Tebow. Yeah. And uh, he had some pretty funny things there. Every has like a running

Speaker 14:         00:53:26       gags and running jokes. So I didn't know crab feast. I did, I don't know what this was, but everyone was like, hey, please ask Bert, why are you so fat and that maybe I got 50 of them.

Speaker 14:         00:53:41       Please ask Bert Way. He's so fan. And then Tom was like, hey man, I really am sorry. Like I didn't mean for it to get this big. And then I was like, he didn't mean for that to get that bigger you to get that bit hilarious. Oh Man. Yeah. Just thank God and I go and don't ever forget your fucking fatter than me. That's the funniest part of the whole thing is Tom is like do 70 to 80. No Way am not. I am at least 30 pounds lighter than bull. No Way. No Way. And by the way, no way. Even even with those numbers aside, body composition wise. Yes, I agree. You know Burt's got that hard fat belly. Yeah. No, no, no, no. That's a different balance. He's got this amazing self esteem. Unbelievable. Like the fact that I have friends pulled me aside going, I don't think you're fat when clearly I fucking am like the second fattest I've ever been.

Speaker 9:          00:54:38       Nope.

Speaker 14:         00:54:41       But I have friends pulled me aside going, I don't think you're fat when clearly I fucking am. Okay. Um, yeah. So there's a couple more things I want to play, but obviously he's also admitting that he's very right. Yeah. Well, birds never had a problem admitting that he's mad. I know he's always known it and then ignored whatever steps to take to, to not be so fat. Right. You know, there's pictures of him. That's what I shot. My Special Ed was two 35. Okay. And, but shirtless and oddly enough, still very overweight. This is the band is that in the midst of this bird is fat campaign. He's going to have a special come out where he's shirt. Right. Oh, that's going to be great. I mean there's, look, I won't even mention it when that happens, but it's going to explode. Yeah. Like shed a bunch of pallets to be, his body will never lose weight.

Speaker 14:         00:55:35       He does not have that kind of body that the weight will just, that's not trail. That'll never happen. Whose only goal is to turn into a power lifter and just get bigger. Okay. Wow. Yeah. Um, what was I saying before you really interrupts me? I forgot, I'm sorry. I completely forgot my thought. I'm sorry Tom. Like we go out to eat and you just watch Benji do. Oh, he fucking murderers. Food Israeli. Oh yeah, he's, he bought her stuff. I've never heard of like why I use the first person that introduced me to this is makes me laugh so hard is his impression of me is so far off. Yeah. But his commitment to it is amazing. Squid Pasta. Oh. He was like, we went to his place. He's like, no, no, no, no, no. You've got to get the ink squid bots a little bit of a little bit shaved.

Speaker 14:         00:56:22       Uh, uh, what are the mushrooms? Trussell's truffles, truffle tremor troubles are going to love it all. And I was like, really? He was like, oh, it wasn't fucking greatest. Same. Get one of those. You know what we're going to get? Let me just run it for you. And then he just orders two things. He wants him throwing you under the bus by ordering you a bunch of fatty foods we can keep shitting on. You know, this was a while ago. We went out to every time we've gone out to eat, he just thought, I murder booze. He murders.

Speaker 2:          00:56:48       Okay. Can I, can I finish that sentence? He should say I murder booze. He murders food. I also murder food. Yes, he eats so much sound like it's so much faster than anybody I've ever seen in my life. In inhales his plate by the time I'm in one bite. That's why he thinks other people are murdering food. Yeah. Is Gone. I know. Remember when we went out with the Chrysler's right before I delivered Ellis? Yeah. Literally like a week before. Yes. And there's a video of it. The blog of course. Go ahead and look at birds like yeah, he orders. So five entrees for himself. Yeah. Yeah. And then orders all the desserts and he, it like two bites and then bottles of wine. Yeah. Every one of every dessert. I'm not even exaggerating. Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead and let me look at birds. He keeps me,

Speaker 14:         00:57:31       he's not a big drinker. He'll have like a glass of wine, like a woman. And then I will drink w I'll go get a bottle and they'll go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then it'd be like my wife, I give them a glass, I drink the rest of the bottle and then he orders, well, you know what, we just got a couple deserves. So we'll just go get two forks and then you're like, oh God. And then he just was like, that'll order three key lime pie who don't want to kill it. But I don't think calories, I don't even like sweets. So he just eats them all.

Speaker 2:          00:57:57       Oh Wow. God, look at, look at birds Vlog. He's to look at it when he go hard. When we all went out to dinner when I was like about to pop. Yeah. And it'll, it'll show you let the record show that led to register order five desserts, burnt Chrysler burned Chrysler ordered five desserts, five bottles of wine and 10 entrees. I'm real this guy. Could we, I think we should really set up some sort of comedy battle royal. Like Ari was saying, no salmon are you are going to fight. I didn't know that, but we might be able to get an undercard of you and they're going to box. What are you talking about? Why do they have beef? I think so, but like, yeah, like, like people don't know that burnt and I don't have any beef and there's no animosity. No. Zero could we, I think we should really set up some sort of comedy battle royal. Like Ari was saying, no salmon, Ari are going to fight, but we might be able to get an undercard you and Segura maybe just a half rounder before you both have fucking heart attack

Speaker 14:         00:58:57       heavier than I am. But I'd be afraid to, cause it's like so much foundation there. You know, like he's just thick. Like I'm a light frisky to third 40 he's like, God, he's like a solid two side. Like you can't move that. He is the mountain and I'm the young gay guy that dances around and almost winning.

Speaker 2:          00:59:15       Yeah, he's right though. Your meat and cheese. You're solid bear on this year on your way.

Speaker 7:          00:59:22       So what about, what about a j hawk? Yep.

Speaker 14:         00:59:23       Oh, he was like, yeah, I feel bad. I'm gonna cut some promos for sucker on about how fat you are. Really. I go are you should be two steps ahead of me in all of this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well he's got time to do. He's also playing it like a gay man. I'm going to call off the dogs. You're good. And he's cutting promos with aging, allowing burden into a false sense of security. Huh? The best. Yeah. I had a four egg omelet before I came here to hear it. Like, yeah, I got, I got two hungry.

Speaker 7:          00:59:58       So anyways, the bird is fat stuff. Look, I don't even push it anymore. I'm just giving you the updates. The main thing I wanted people to know because I feel like it's not understood by some, most people get it, is that that there's no animosity that we are really good friends. We talk almost every day. But people sometimes they get comms for people that are like, whoa man. Like I can't believe like why are you pulling him? I'm like, it's called comedy world. Yeah. So anyways, um, yeah. By the way, we've had a, you know what? I gotta take a Piss. I've had so much water. Oh, that's probably because you're not used to drinking so much water. No, it's because it's so much more water than you'll ever drink in a week. And I just had it in like 30 minutes. Why don't you share the back of your neck too funny.

Speaker 7:          01:00:42       You Talk Shit and then you went and peed yourself. Well that's because I thought I should, but I didn't have to go as badly as you did because you're obviously showboating and it's not normal for you to drink this much water. There's totally no color. Was it? What do you think? It's always just the color wall. Shit I've smelled or as, you're such a liar. I can't even believe it. I swear. I wish I had smellovision when you and I shower together and you pee and it's out. Was Dark Brown like the coffee and it's smells of cough on Hobos. Shower, shower. It's every time you shower with me, you're so disgusting. I swear to God this one wire and you're a liar. Anyways, so this morning you made an explosion smoothie. Well, I should credit and I regrettably don't remember his name, the chef at wet nap sack.

Speaker 7:          01:01:36       Really Nice Guy. He knows you. He remembered you. Oh yeah. He's real friendly and he's like, there's only a few clubs were like the chef will come in the green room. Be like anything you want. That's so nice. So nice healthy eater. I'm like burnt Chrysler. You probably were like, feel so welcoming. And so you know, there's, there's a few kitchens like that first night I ordered this chicken dish was great. And then actually a lot of people were even tweeting me that there they were like, we actually have it working at a club where the food is good cause it's nice, really good food there. Anyways. Then somebody else mentioned it, they're like, oh if you had one of those smoothies and I didn't know what they meant. I thought they were talking about something sweet, you know, like what kind of smoothie? Oh he just throws a bunch of fruits and vegetables and I go, oh I'll try that.

Speaker 7:          01:02:20       Because I had just literally on the road I tried to maintain this thing where I go work out shower show. Right. You know, because if you, if you do it in that order, it's a, it's a good time of day. Do you started at? Well, let's say I have a seven o'clock show, I will try to work out, uh, between four 45. I'll try, I'll try to start in the gym between four 45 and five. That way you have like a good, however long you want to work out, 30 40, 60 minutes and then you're not rushed. So you, you go back to your room, you take a shower, you can do, you don't have to rush there. She knew casually before shows anymore. That's old. No. What happens is those workouts give you that energy boost that cause a lot of times if you drag, you feel lethargic on the road.

Speaker 7:          01:03:06       Yeah. But if you go to, if you do your workout right before take your shower, you get dressed, you kind of feel like, oh, I'm really like awake right now. Alive. Yes. Alive and energized. And then you arrive at the show. I also like to get picked up very late. Yeah. So that I can arrive. I don't want to wait at the, at the nine years. So I do that, I arrive and then at showtime and it feels great. Um, but the only thing that becomes kind of hairy then is if you had worked out, you're going to go to your show, you get hungry, you don't want to eat a lot of times comedy club food. So this option, the smoothie, I was like, this is excellent. Anyways, I asked him what he, what he, how he makes it and he tells me, you know, cucumbers, lime juice.

Speaker 7:          01:03:47       Uh, he goes, you don't have that. Maybe if you don't have the cucumber, you use Kale and avocado apples and just, it's just a mix. Mash of like of fruits and vegetables. Right. So I just asked you to pick it up while I was gone. I fired it up this morning for you. And right away, first of all, I did the, um, cause it was the first time making it, I did the taste test. I go, let me see what it tastes like. After two sips of taste test I got, I gotta take a shit that was two sips. Yeah. Explosion came back, uh, added a little soy milk water. We didn't have ice, so to make a call to put cold water in there. And then, um, gave you, you had about what, three quarters of it? I saw you as a little bit,

Speaker 2:          01:04:33       you gave me a nice healthy tall glass and here I am like, yeah, this, this tastes great. It's going down super easy. I'm feeding. The kid were laughing and then we take Ellis up for his nap, his morning nap. And I'm like, well why don't you put them down? I, my stomach hurts a little bit and I had already taken my morning shit. I drink my coffee in the morning, I shit. And then she usually it for the day. I don't, we'll shit anymore. But I felt a rumbling and I was like, I gotta go. I gotta go. You never do two in the morning? Yeah. And the pain, the cramping, I was doubled over and I was like whole Mike. God, it was a six, a hot six. Yeah. But now I just shower immediately. And by the way, the day it wasn't enough. It was back to shit to shower because of this.

Speaker 2:          01:05:24       Wow. Now did you discover that because you use per day wiped and then you're like this isn't enough. Yeah, so I a date it. I read brainstorming sprints, brainstorm insurance. I left it extra long and I went to wipe and there was still brown on the paper. Ah. And I go, it's time for old school. What a story now do you think now you don't think obviously that what I made was, was bad. What do you think is, it's just so intense. It's not bad. What did it, what it is is you've got your Kale and then you put like 10 lines in lime juice alone will make me shit apples. I saw you throw in apples I saw is high, high, high fibrous and you need something like a banana to pull it together cause there's nothing on yogurt or something to pull it because it's all like high fiber, high acidic, orange.

Speaker 2:          01:06:16       You had orange in there too. So I mean eating one orange alone will make me shit dynamite like already. Yeah, it's gotta be tempered jeans. You hear me? How should I have done? Okay. Here's what I would do if I were you. Half a banana, a little bit of Yogurt, like Greek yogurt. You do, you're a like a peach. Maybe some stores, some berries, blueberries, strawberry and maybe some Kale and cucumber. And that's it. You can't do all acidic fibrous. I mean, sorry, we what? Okay, I'll, I'll, uh, I'll tone it down. I'll go pick up the banana is going to help because the banana binds it. You know what I'm saying? Okay. There's a lot that was really intense. I think I lost weight though. Today's my weigh in day on weight watchers. So you'll look great. I do, you know why discipline, I don't need anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:07:11       I just stopped eating at night. I don't eat at night. I stopped eating by five o'clock. I try not to eat. I try not to drink a lot too, but I got to say it was different, you know, it was, it was still a morning sort of explosion, but it was, it was a healthier one. I felt good. When are you going to see the doctor for this IBS? This is week. Yeah. Oh Shit. I wish we could live tweet the event. Maybe blue. Can I come with you and live tweet? What is it Tommy? Are you afraid you missed your appointment? I don't want to miss my appointment. Is it today or tomorrow? It's Thursday. Okay. Yeah. What are you looking at? What? Nothing. I'm just thinking about it. That's all you are. You're excited to go to the doctor for your IBS. Of course. Are they going to make you shit? They're like we have to bring in a stool sample. Um, like with Theo and we have to take dogs. Might be, he might be getting to know you kind of sit down. Oh right. Tell him all the brown stores. What did he goes away about what you're going through. And I go, could you just download a few episodes of your mind?

Speaker 2:          01:08:20       Can I tell you something though? You need to start making I shit diary and a diet diary so this guy can have a good picture. Okay. Cause you have, and I don't mean this in a mean way, kind of a skewed memory about what happens to you because you don't really put cause and effect together very well. The, you're saying that like I'm a, a patient who maybe doesn't have all his yes. Brain cells working. Cause you do the same thing over and over and then you get diarrhea. And I have to be like, Babe, you can't have fried food. It makes you shit.

Speaker 15:         01:08:50       Hmm.

Speaker 2:          01:08:56       You're such a show off. You're such a show off right now. You're not even that thirsty. You're just doing this for the cameras. They can't even see the truth. This is such fucking bullshit. Are you done?

Speaker 15:         01:09:11       That's one step.

Speaker 2:          01:09:16       But you do that like twice a day, but you don't understand what it is to be the water champion.

Speaker 2:          01:09:24       I consume so much water. Okay. Can we talk about something else? Sure. Um, we got, uh, a request on Youtube from, Oh my, are you ready? Yes. Nick Hawk. She wanted to get us on the copyright infringement and say that we're playing a song as it, it should be taken down. Isn't that amazing. He didn't like that. We weren't talking about his music. His music. Yeah. It was very upset. And guess what? We fought the law and we won. Well, we didn't really fight it. No, he didn't. So we just didn't get taken down because there's no infringement. Yeah. We didn't infringe. We explored and discussed it and gave him credit for his horrible, horrible music. Yeah. I mean, he actually filed the copyright claim. This is what they wrote back to us. If it was a few episodes ago, where right. We played some of his songs. Um, let me, uh, let's play them again just for old time's sake. Well, I, cause I feel like they're all so terrible, but then what's the most terrible Nick Kok Song? I don't know. Yeah. Well, you know. Yeah. What's the most unpleasant STD? They're all pretty bad dude. Yeah, I bet he was. What's the worst Steven Seagal movie? They're all pretty terrible, but that's what you're asking when you're asking what's the worst? Nick hawks, his, his album is really, really atrocious. So here is a, but it's the best worst.

Speaker 2:          01:11:08       So it is the best. Worst though, by the way,

Speaker 8:          01:11:14       a lot of people didn't go to it. They didn't really try it out. And then, I mean, it says here's the comments under it. Hey, Mommy's checking in high and tight here. Um, you should stick to fucking old white women really over it looks like he hasn't found the come low and Louis no common. These balls thought it was pretty good. High and tight. Just like my jeans got a fan. Okay. We're not just discouraging people from becoming a fan.

Um, and it begins by him walking and it looked like a in the desert. What? Twirling a sword or some fighting instrument in a, in a manner that a martial arts expert would. Right. And now he's walking around a fire shirtless and shirtless. This is very to Sigale by them. I'm predicting he ends up fighting himself. That's what we're going to see.

You know what I'm saying? So a brand new case of foreign accent syndrome has come about. My favorite disease, um, it's one of the Oh gee topics of our show. And you may remember the first time we ever

Speaker 17:         01:26:12       later

Speaker 8:          01:26:18       Brianna, that is a British woman who woke up one day with foreign accent syndrome and now it is attacking a woman in Texas. You know what accident she woke up with jeans? What? British. Oh, cool. Yeah, let's hear it.

Speaker 18:         01:26:39       Well, people who've met me before, they shot first and then most people say, oh, I love it. But for me it's a lot different. Wow. Listening to this mother, you think she was from London but uh, she was actually born and raised right here in Texas.

Speaker 17:         01:26:55       Strange but true. And it's an extremely rare case called foreign accent syndrome. But doctor say it actually happens and now actually happened to try to get her normal speech.

Speaker 8:          01:27:04       There's like 15 cases worldwide report is so rare. It's like a double pipe class for language as paper logs.

Speaker 18:         01:27:15       Oh, not from England. Sorry. He is 100% Texas painful. Who Don't know me that, hey, where are you from? Oh wait, where's that? I'm like, Oh, you talk like that. So that's when the whole story comes up.

Speaker 8:          01:27:31       I don't buy this. Do you buy this? There was the one that was fake. Remember the fake one that was clearly fake? We played it a long time ago. This lady claimed that she had it and then she walked, the camera came and he saw her walking in the parking lot. They stopped her talk to her and then when she walked away she walked sideways. Like she was doing a little bit of a, an app cause she said it was a whole neurological thing. And I tend to think that these people need attention. It might just be bored and wants some attention. But it does happen though, right? I mean, I don't know. Oh, you're saying you don't believe it at all? I don't know. The, the one, the one lady who and four year now that one, she legitimately was a bit tortured by it. She seemed towards me. She was like, I just want, I want to talk the way I used tall, tall. She was like that. She's like, she really was. She was like, yeah, I'll watch the way I use that to talk them or she talking like that. That's how she said it. She said she did. So you do it. You're the master of accents. Do her doing the accent.

Speaker 17:         01:28:40       I challis voice in the conversation and combine nearly for Ya know, for, you know,

Speaker 18:         01:28:47       mom is probably the one word I noticed right away on kitten. They think I'm talking about a baby cat and I'm not. I'm saying I'm just kidding. But it's kidding. I'm just kidding.

Speaker 8:          01:29:00       But how would she have mastered the

Speaker 7:          01:29:02       accent? I mean she's, she's watching TV, man, she list into your shop. But she's like, you know, fucking lady from, I don't know man, the man, because they played, remember when they played the reaction? I was the British ladies answering machine. Are they going to judge? And they played her before she had the foreign accent syndrome and she was really sad when she hurt herself. She was like, Oh I wish I could talk at this away again. She did. I remember, I remember he was like, Oh, if we shot could talk like a decent yes. Talk on like, Oh this are now.

Speaker 7:          01:29:42       Yup. This one, I don't believe anybody that has clear braces to you. That's what the other lady was talking. Yeah. I don't like it when people do the clear, but what I do, the Invisalign, you know, people can still see him, but then you don't have, you know, nerdy ass clear braces, gold school man get, get the metal. Do you think the clear braces are just worse than the old school metal ones? Um, I dunno, cause you're not fooling anybody. We still know that you have the brace from a distance, but actually their mouth's still kind of, that's what I'm saying. You can still tell that's a piece so badly again.

Speaker 7:          01:30:21       Well, well your honor, could that be because like his show boating around with a lot of drinking because she had not accustomed to drank in this much. Are they going to think I'm lying? Are they going to even understand how I'm speaking? It doesn't sound, here's the thing though. A lot of these people, I think the fakies sometimes you see it, you hear it dip, you know, like it doesn't, it doesn't sound like it's, they're all Chinese accent lady had it one time. Her, she's like, are they going to think I'm lying? It doesn't sound 100% she's speaking like cockney she's not think I'm lying. Like she kind of does like a lower class. Oh Wow. Interesting. Winner of the poll. Let everybody see that he can't hold his water. We'll look at which I've drank because it's not accustomed for you if you drank this much water.

Speaker 7:          01:31:09       You have to, Pete, what'd you say? No one's a of meaning you because why? This is an out of the norm for you know, it doesn't matter or you drink the every day. Wait a minute. You don't drink this much every day, so I do, and your body still has to get rid of it, but if he drank this much every day, we never have to break twice for you to pay. I'm drinking more this episode at this moment, but that doesn't mean why. Why are you drinking more this episode? Why letting them know what I normally do after the show? During the show? Okay, sure. That's the only difference. Go ahead and urinate again. Oh Man, who's exclusive now. As soon as he was super abusive and I'm like, I turned her just then. Now here's the part that I feel like I feel like you just don't get it. No, you don't get it. No, you don't. Let me explain. You're like, oh, you're not used to it.

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       That's why you picked that are not used to drinking as much water.

Speaker 7:          01:32:04       That's not true. How has that been finished and not true? I'll explain it to you cause you don't get it. You don't get a lot, but any lievable, any body that consumes as much water, whether it be the first time they ever did it or they do it every day, your body has to get rid of the flu. Yeah, so you're saying like anybody who just down's half a gallon and an hour's not like I'm used to it so it doesn't have to come out. Not just that. No, not true. You don't get it.

Speaker 2:          01:32:35       You don't get it because you don't hydrate as much as I do. I can drink an entire, you could not drink as much long skinny from trader's Joe car and sit in traffic for an hour and my bladder accommodates because I'm so used to drinking so much. No. Expands and accommodates the, the p the urine. No, you don't get it. Nope. You don't get it. First of all, you don't drink a lot of water. First of all, this is all theatrical.
