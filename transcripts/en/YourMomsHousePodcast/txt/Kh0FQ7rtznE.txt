Speaker 4:          00:03:18       Hey, here it is.

Speaker 2:          00:03:43       oh is Randy. Don't bring anyone in loving. Well go to your mom's house.

Speaker 1:          00:03:56       Someone didn't get the right order there, Huh? Well, you know, we've been talking about people who are so rude when they make their phone calls on speakerphone and public. Probably my greatest pet peeve, it is mine to only, I've, I've gotten a new one. I'm going to tell you about in a minute here. It's a, it's in my act now. It's bothering me. It bothers me too. But it proves, I think a theory that we might be having, that people that are doing their phone calls in public on speakerphone are either mentally ill or on drugs. Um, do you know what's funny? What you haven't seen? Obviously you don't see these folders, even the files. Right, right, right. Uh, one of these clips of this lady has called drugs or mentally. Yeah, that's a new game. We're gonna play on the shot. Yeah. And I'm gonna have Dr drew come in and then he's gonna verify from that.

Speaker 1:          00:04:41       I'm going to put this on the drew list before we go even further on this. I want to, don't forget what your pet peeve is. Yeah. I want to congratulate my, uh, friend, uh, last week's guest finesse Mitchell, a an alum of the University of Miami on his teams, nausea, getting wind this past week. They at the semen halls. I lost the bet. So I'm wearing his shirt. I'm wearing his shirt. Congratulations. Finesse and congratulations to the biggest piece of shit. Fan Base in all of sports. The University of Miami Hurricanes. Oh, you're, oh, you're saying the fans or even pos, they're the worst. They're such garbage people. Seriously, I've spent so much time down there. I used to go to the orange bowl, their animals to the biggest piece of this. And now I don't know much about sports, so I can't really, but I've heard that Raiders fans are pieces of shit too. That probably be a fair thing to say now I, but only because their behavior is bad from, that's what we're talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:05:35       Yeah. Okay. Well here's the thing too about, because I know you don't have 12 words. Every, every single fan base has garbage people in it. Sure. Every single one. And people when they, people act like that, their team doesn't and they're full of shit. You know, especially when you're talking about a sizable fan base, right? I mean, maybe if you're like, I, you know, I go to the University of Northern Idaho or some shit where there's like 800 people enrolled. Okay, maybe you're fucking fan base doesn't. But once you're talking about like a national fan base, of course it has every, you know, you told me about tailgating parties. This is where people just get together and drink and parking lots. Well, of course you're going to act like a holes. Some do, some don't. I mean, I've been, I've been in tailgates where people were really decent and like welcoming and nice.

Speaker 1:          00:06:23       Um, sure. And look, I mean some of my best friends are Emmy graduates alarms. Uh, I have friends, good friends that live in Miami. It's not an anti Miami thing. I'm just, first of all, I know you do, it's a, it's a sports writer, but you're supposed to talk shit about your rivals was supposed to say that they're garbage. Um, that was a really good burp. I was pretty good. Sound was good. It was crisp. Here's the cheap thing that I did not, I thought that was good burp. The thing that was super lame about sia talking shit about Miami. I talked shit about them online after, you know, on Twitter, just after the loss. And they're like, I had people who obviously don't know anything about me. They were like, why don't you say what you really mean? I was like, what do I really mean?

Speaker 1:          00:07:08       And then they implied that I'm talking shit about Miami, calling them garbage people because I'm racist. Like, oh, interesting. One Guy and one guy implied that I was racist against a Latino people. Oh, sure. Sigora yeah. I didn't even have to answer him because everybody just like your mom's Peruvian. Yeah. People attacked him for me. Stupid. It's just, I think that's one of the cheapest, laziest, most idiotic takes on criticism is that you can spin it to that. It's like a cop out to, to talking shit, Talk Shit. But also I'll also say it right. It's like, I know you guys are garbage people. And then to be like you're saying that because we're like Latin, it's a, not only is it cheap and lazy and idiotic, which are three traits you find very often with Miami fans. Sure. But, uh, it really takes, it takes the banter out of it.

Speaker 3:          00:08:04       It takes all the fun away from talk some shit. You know what it is? It's because the social justice warriors, uh, they're just no fun and they're out policing all the fun in the world. Uh, these are the new puritans. They want to make sure that whenever there's a whiff of a fun and levity and busting balls, we're going to stop all that good time because it's an prout. Bring it out.

Speaker 1:          00:08:28       They're the same thing in November, dammit. Also something in November about gator fans because it's a rivalry. You hate the gator fans. That's the fun of sports. You talk some shit. Those gators I know nothing about. I grew up around surrounded by gator and hurricane fence, so I talk shit about them because of shit. That's the fun of sport. Who's dumber? The gator fans or the Miami hurricanes. They're people. There's just

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       garbage people. I mean, you know who's worse a Mussolini or Hitler, you know? It's like they're bad guys. Yeah. That's interesting. Yeah. Should be fun for you when you do your shows in Miami. I have nothing lined up. All right, so let's go. No, but seriously, um, there was, it was ridiculous game. It was so crazy and a finesse. I will say, obviously wearing a shirt smells really good, by the way. You got to smell this shirt. I've never smelled that bad on finesse. And we spent quite some time with him in a very hot country and he never smelled bad. Um, and also, congrats. Don't forget finesses special. The spirit told me, right? The spirit told me to say comes out October 19th. I'll cover 19th. I saw him on Instagram. He's aboriginal thing I'm going to do for him anyway. What's that? I think I'm going to have a promo cut to the seminal war chant for him, for his best idea.

Speaker 3:          00:09:49       Just to like get the word out. Sure. You know what I mean? Sure. Just to help them out. Help the right people like his stuff. So I'll just a dumb the denim, I'll plug it for him. I'll, I'll send this kit for him and then that way you know, it'll be, it's like a promo and black. Yeah. Um, so this lady, do you want to talk? Wait, tell me what you know. Here's the deal guys. This one's really horrifying. I like, first of all, I like where our fans are going. I like where this show is going. Every now and then we pick up a meme, a swell, and right now we're policing asshole behavior in public. And I think this is a public service we're doing. So I went to Bark Williams and I was getting ready for my mass asage and they encourage you to use their facilities, right?

Speaker 3:          00:10:37       You get your steam room, you got your, your fucking Jacuzzi full of disgusting coach Broth. I won't even go in the fucking Jacuzzi, get your life. I saw a woman with really hanging tits hanger than mine or Nay. Like I w in there just baking. I was like, no, I'm not doing that. But I go on to the steam room cause I can sit on a towel. So it separates my vagina from other people's Shit. Right? Yeah. I'm in the steam room. I look fucking over. There is a woman with shaving cream and a razor and this nasty bitch is shaving, fully shaving her legs in the steam room at and that's that. It's right. What is she doing with each? Like I'm users swipe, flicking it onto the floor. I'll know this isn't your house. I cannot believe it. I was, I almost vomited right there.

Speaker 3:          00:11:29       I literally went, Oh hell no. Like I saw her, I sat down, I looked over, I went, Hell No. And I got up and I told one of the staff, I was like, dude, there's a lady fully shaving her legs. I don't know what she's going to shave next. Can somebody like educate her on etiquette? This is completely inappropriate. Discuss. So I got to, I waited, dude, like I'm fucking waited outside and I waited for the manager to, Oh my God, you guys are so disgusting. And I waited for the manager and I was like, are you gonna go talk to her right now? Like, I got all excited. You know, like I just told I tattle tale. And then she came out and I was like, how crazy is that woman? How crazy is that? When she's like, well, we get all kinds. And I'm like, did you tell her?

Speaker 3:          00:12:06       She's like, yes, she's been, she's been told not to do such as, I'm like, yeah, it's nasty. It's so nasty. Why would you even need someone to tell you not to do that in a public steam room? Flick your hair. It's so disgusting. Well now I'm totally turned off to using any birth boys' facility or any spa facility now cause I'm like, oh imagine what this nasty persons doing before you got there. And then I had someone else tell me their day. A acquaintance of mine go, you know when I'm sick with a cold or a sinus infection, I go to Burke Williams and I use the steam room and I feel better and I'll like what? Well this way too that can see my germs leave my mouth and my face and I watched them enter other people and I can ruin everyone else's week basically.

Speaker 3:          00:12:54       I was like, get the fuck. I mean you think you try not to think about that stuff when you use spas, like how many people are clean and it's not, I know it's disgusting. I'm going to a clean, sterile, no sanitary, no safe, relaxing, wonderful place. Now, how many dudes are peeing in the Jacuzzi to oh, every two piece in that she cozy or jacks off in there and yeah. Yeah. And there's a sign in the bathroom at the spa that's like you have to shower before you gave, you take a shit. Basically you have to shower before you use the spar. The facilities know who's doing that. Nobody. Nobody being gross. Everyone's being growth. We also have that thing in those spots by the way, where they'll go. Some of them will be like, it's European style here. And you're like, what that means?

Speaker 3:          00:13:39       Um, trunks are optional. Yeah. But basically most American dudes are like, no, we're trunks. But then you'll see guys who are like, they'll give you the, the San Francisco, the San Francisco treat eyes and they'll let you know that like, I'm not really in the trunks. Are you? And they I bank serious. They give you a signal and the Jacuzzi or some no, that'll give you a signal. I'm just saying that there's people that own it, you know, it's like the guy that goes in the steam room and, and does towel. I mean, everyone would go in with a towel and then there's the guy that opens the towel. Like I just feel comfortable. Like I just, I'm just comfortable like this. And then there's the towel closed, which is like, it's not necessary. I wouldn't say it's necessarily etiquette, but it's just, you know, are you and wants you to see what he's doing. Of course, when he wants you to see now Europeans don't give a rip obviously different though here it's just more modest here. Americans don't show their junk unless they will not inviting you in. Yeah. Or, or, I mean there's, there's different guys that show their junk. There's inviting you in. There's truly, I don't care.

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       Like, and you'll see it sometimes with like a really disgusting body. They'll give be like, yeah, I don't give a shit. They're, you know, they're like, everything's gross on the, which is the most, I like the most, the one rating. It's the most liberal. It's actually the guy that has like zero self conscious kind of shit going on with them, which is great. Yeah. And then, and then there's also the proud buck where it's like, if, if you're, you know, six, five totally ripped. You've got a 10 inch hawking. Yeah. It's peacocking where it's like, it's like they're not necessarily inviting you there. Just being like, I'm a specimen, so shit. Yeah. My shits. Nice. Now what do you do? I think I'm fair. I'm not like hiding. Right. You know? Um, I'm fairly modest wear. Like I don't, I don't, I mean, I, I'm kind of like the guy who's like, I'm gross. Yeah. I know no one wants to see it, but I'm aging so I'm getting more into, I don't care. So I kind of hide my body and everything, but I'm also like, I'm fucking gross. Yeah. I'm a dad. I'm, you know, I'm like, I don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:16:01       See, I think you and I are the same way. And the spa, because I'm kind of, I'm like, yeah, two babies. This is racks. This is all fun. Yeah. Like I'm never going to be able to be single again and beyond the market. Like nobody's gonna, no one's gonna want this. So I wear a towel like in the steam room or the song, like I'll, I'll, I'll be naked under the towel and then all kind of sit in the towel. Maybe unraveling a little kind of thing. But I'll go, you know, before this last encounter, I would go in the Jacuzzi nude. Yeah. But you're quickly, quickly, like I'm, you protect the robot just quickly go in there.

Speaker 1:          00:16:36       Yeah. I mean know I've done it. I've done it before. I wasn't like, I dunno, it wasn't a big,

Speaker 3:          00:16:43       you made a brown and then they know there's brown probably all over the, remind me, remind me of that. Especially dudes. They're fucking nasty. Dee Brown dudes who's are nasty, nasty. Brown's. Yeah, I know. So there was that nastiness and then, um, there's like a waiting area where you go to the spa and then you wait for your misuse to come out. And they're like, Christina, like they're supposed to kind of whisper your name. It's very quiet environment. Yeah. And next to me, I hear this older couple, just like, what time is our appointment? Like full volume. Horrible too. That ruins, ruins it. Yeah. And that's, I can excuse that. Cause the wife did go, Oh shit, I think this is the quiet waiting area. And then the husband, he goes, oh okay. And then he gets on his phone. Yeah. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick whoop. I'm like are you fucking joking? And then the phone rings and it's extra loud cause he's, hello, hello. And he's, it's extra loud cause they're old as fuck. Yeah. And um, yeah. And then the phone call, we're at the spa like are you serious? We're in the quiet,

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       we're in the quiet room, the quiet room. God, I know what is wrong with people gets your life. He's just like, you just want an assassin on board who just watches it and immediately fills those people. Can I tell you, cause I've been to the Gaylord hotel and Hungary and Budapest, which is like the most premier beautiful spa and you, you know, you get naked. Yes. You go on the thermal baths and this and that. You would never fucking see like a Hungarian like Oh God, I like talking rudely. It's just, they don't do it. You will be will be. Somebody would fucking slit your throat. That's what I'm telling you. There's no way dude, like this is a perfect time. Like what this full clip is. I love it. In the context of this here, this video was recording in a Starbucks employee asked the woman has stopped having her call on speaker phone. She loses it. Craig crazy hoof man, this, this, this gets heat. We just showed you a frat show. Here's where it started. Kind of.

Speaker 5:          00:18:59       Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          00:19:02       First of all, the audacity to sit and I've been in a, um, before I had, we had, there was somewhere we didn't have internet when, I mean it was like more than a, maybe we weren't even living together. It was like there's areas in your life where you don't have Internet for whatever reason. I think it was in Hollywood. He had no, I don't even think of it. We were dating, I didn't have a computer and I went to a Kinko's or old, you know, old FedEx Kinko's, I'm sorry, where they have the Fedex and they have the, they had like the internet room and a lady like, and then we were all sitting at computers doing different things. This lady who was on answering the phone like she was at the office, like her office having full fucking conversations and you see everybody turning around with their bitch. Are you out of your mind? Like this isn't your sweet, it's just a public space. No, this is her world. She's the, her Starbucks. Oh Shit. This may, she may not be stable. I'm thinking, I'm thinking anybody that makes phone calls on speaker phone in public, isn't it?

Speaker 5:          00:20:30       Look at this woman here, not even looking at

Speaker 1:          00:20:45       gives the first time anyone's told her to hang up the phone

Speaker 3:          00:20:51       or do you think this is something that happens every day in her life

Speaker 5:          00:21:00       time.

Speaker 3:          00:21:13       She goes here, take your shit and leave. Go get the forgotten you. Help you out. You know? I know Starbucks has this policy where they call Starbucks your third place. You got your home, you've got your, what does it work? And then Starbucks is your third place. I think they should really discontinue this logic of like come and hang out for hours and surfing and do your fucking office work here and waste to be like you. You can come here to have a drink and take your shit. Shit. That's all we're here to do. Take away all of this extra desk space and put more toilets in. They should change. Let's just say we're not your third home, but you can shit here. That should be the well, cause that's a flaw of mania. Starbucks is, there's often just one toilet for the entire is Starbucks lately. It's inhumane. It's wrong. We're giving you [inaudible] juice and we're giving it to all of you and we make one too. Cups of bowel torture and they're like, Nah, go shit somewhere else. It's completely wrong. It's completely wrong. Completely wrong. I know

Speaker 5:          00:22:11       I got it.

Speaker 3:          00:22:21       Yeah, lock it up. Good. Good idea about things like this. No. Aftermath, like not knowing what happened. What happened next in the cops come, she come back and throw a fucking brick through the door. Like what happened that somebody that's worked? I've worked a lot with the public. I've had many, many jobs. I've worked at Starbucks and the summer of [inaudible] 97 we've gone over this. The point is, and I've waitressed many times, there's like once a day there's something like this. It happens. Some person freaks out or if gets crazy, the manager comes out, throws them out. They might yell back at you a few more times. They might throw something Majia and usually that's it. And by the time the cops come, they've they're long gone or maybe they get a talking to from the cops. Yeah. I mean there was a guy that jerked off every day next to the retail store.

Speaker 3:          00:23:15       I worked out on Melrose every day. We called the cops on him every day and he'd show up in jerk off every day. The cops would come every, it was like this routine. She's like a working professional though. You know this lady. Scary, Huh? Kind of job is, she's not like a vagrant, you know. No, no, no. A lot of times it's not vagrants. It can be, but just people who are just having a day, she's having a day, who knows? She's having a drag. Good day could be like, you know, we said it could be the dog, could be as little guys. Yeah. She's off her meds. Um, by the way,

Speaker 1:          00:23:45       it's October 9th when we record this right now. How's your a sober October cause there were October. Um, well, you know, silver October affects people differently and there's different challenges for different people. Yeah. Um, I mean, let's go through it. Well for like for instance, and by the way, I highly encourage anybody to take part in this in whatever capacity they want to take part in. It's just a great exercise. Meaning like some people go like, I just want to give up drinking for the month, but I don't want to do that. Uh, or some people go like, I'm just going to not smoke pot. Just do that. There's no set of rules. The rules are yours to make. I just think it's good sometimes in life to engage in an exercise of discipline. This is your lent, so to speak. It's sort of our law and it's just, it's good.

Speaker 1:          00:24:36       It's like, hey man, once a year, it's something to mentally focus on and there's just rewards mostly for yourself to see what you're capable of, you know? So for me, for instance, I'd be lying if I said the sobriety part. Was it challenged because I'm just not a big drinking drug guy. Right. I mean, I enjoy them, I enjoy it, but I enjoy it. Usually in mild doses. Right. You know, like I'll, I'll sometimes go two weeks without anything without thinking or trying. When I was pregnant, I don't think you drank alcohol once and that wasn't just because I wasn't taking around you rank but see dinners. Yeah, stuff like that. I mean, on the road, honestly, I'm usually, I'll pick, if I'm doing a three nights out, I'll have drinks, maybe one night get wrapped. I just drank like normally what? What's your, if it's at dinner, if it's at dinner and like the night's over, there's nothing, you know, it's not pregames done.

Speaker 1:          00:25:40       Depends if sometimes you want, I like wine with dinner. Red Or white usually read. Um, peanut, peanut, peanut. Sometimes. Sometimes if it's like a steak, I'll have a cab. Sometimes I'll do a mall Beck. Sometimes I'll do, yeah. Pinot noir. But yeah, I like wine with dinners. Um, sometimes if I'm like, ah man, just nice as weekends over I'll have bourbon. Oh shit son. But I do, I'm saying it's not, it's not that frequent, you know, I just don't have the, I like, I like beer with Sushi. That's outstanding. Yeah, it's kind of rough. The older you get. I just farting, I dunno. And then as far as getting high, I like weed, but I like, I've discovered over life now that I just like mild doses. I like being able to function and not have like paranoia. And for me that means getting paranoid well for me.

Speaker 1:          00:26:35       Yeah. I think that I have a low tolerance. Like I've just, I know that I do. So for me it's like, it's not a fun endeavor if I go over the line because then I'm like, I just gotta get in my room and cry alone so can, yeah. So I like a mild dose, so I'm saying the challenge for me isn't that part. I work out separate from, so Rocktober regularly. Every week I do a couple of sessions with the trainer. I do some stuff at home, but so far we're on the ninth year. I've worked out every day. You're doing no days off, like on three days off. You bragging about that. Why aren't you bragging about your new date? I'm doing so far. On six of the nine days I did two workouts a day. Yeah. So that is the, for me, the fun or the challenge and the part that's rewarding is to go, can you actually do that?

Speaker 1:          00:27:25       Can you work out every day for a month? Because that's a departure for me. That's not something I would normally do, you know? Right. For me, a busy, like a heavy workout week would be definitely probably five days. So I'd be like, Holy Shit, I worked out five days this week. I'm doing every day right now. It's a lot. Here's the current standings. Got Ahead. Now this changes and this is just standings according to our point system that this app awards us. Um, for people curious, it's the Maya zone APP. It's a attached to a heart monitor and it basically gives you points based on the percentage of your Max. That's basically like a cardio reward. As of right now, as we're recording this, I'm in first guide for you have gene Ari's in second. Okay. Burnt is in third and Joe's in fourth now. Well I'll tell you, this is like, he's gonna make that shit up today.

Speaker 1:          00:28:21       He could make up today. He is annoyed by basically the fact that I got this thing at the gym and that's why I suggested it to these guys. And when you go to the gym and you see your points and you want to move up, you work out to get your points. Well, the sort of shortcut, it's not really a shortcut, but the thing we figured out is that well, you can just get your heart rate up by doing cardio, like elliptical bike ride. And it wasn't the intent. The intention originally was go workout, get your points to rate a workout, meaning cheat you guys. Well, you know, you still have to put in the time and you still have to get your heart rate up, but it just seems like a, a way to get points. So he's like, whatever. I'm, he's like, you know, I could smash.

Speaker 1:          00:29:12       Like I said, we were like, yeah, he was, um, you know, he was like doing two hours of cardio when we started this. He was like, this is just easy. Like I, it's not, I'm just annoyed at how much time I'm having to put in doing this time consumer. So I think what, what, what he's going to end up doing, because we've talked about it, is that he'll just go back to doing his regular workout and get his points that way. And then, because he basically just wants to work out like that. And we will do whatever we can

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       to be in points. By the way, we're all very close when I just did that order there. It's all within a couple of hundred points of each other. Well, Joe works out a lot. He normally normal normal routine is five days a week. Oh my goodness. All of those five days, uh, I dunno. Most of them are like brutal, intense. I've seen it. Yeah. But he doesn't do no days off. Now that's a special kind of, yeah, no lunacy. No days off. People really hurt themselves. Uh, this is, this is no days off, no days off.

Speaker 6:          00:30:14       Oh, Jesus Christ. Last Day of shooting skyscraper here in Vancouver. It's been an incredible experience of this city. It's the Rock, by the way. Thank you so much for opening your home to me. Treating me like your one of your sons.

Speaker 3:          00:30:26       This is his, uh, traveling Jim. Oh Man. This is his gym. He goes to every set.

Speaker 6:          00:30:31       The anchors that makes the experience so special is every morning at 5:00 AM I get up and I come here to my high on paradise. This is my traveling carnival. The traveling circus. There's only 40,000 pounds of twisted steel sex appeal and heartache. A lot of harvest. Mainly my own message of gratitude to the small group who sets this gym up. Every location I go to the next location will be Hawaii when we shoot jungle cruise. But this is a lot of shit to move around and stuff. Plus I'm a pain in the ass because I'm like, the energies has got to flow this way and you can't keep your head that way. Big Pain in the ass for guys. Thank you so much. It's my anchor. Plus traveling in a gym like this eliminates all the bullshit excuses not to get the job done and get to work and so I think you the studios. Thank you. You guys are the best. My anchor. Much love. Thank you guys.

Speaker 3:          00:31:16       You know what I liked about a Miami graduate? Oh Wow. You know what I like is that he's got those rhymes down. Yeah. That people have in the gen like teamwork makes the dream work or whatever. Like yeah, yeah. He's got his rhymes down. Madeline's steel. Keeps it real. That's right. You got a pump. If you don't want to be a dump or wa he's got it. He's got the right. It's definitely got it. So for those of you who aren't watching the show on Youtube, would you really should be?

So he's got to keep that shit up. He's completely fucking yoked.

Speaker 3:          00:32:43       It's crazy. A mess. No days off, no days off. No days off. I have to tell the most disgusting thing that's happened to us where you work out or the elliptical machine is in our home. Uh, I come to find out there's been a little friend who's living in our AC unit. Yeah. There's a, there's a separate a sea, it's like a wall. It's a wall thing that has its own, um, condenser outside of the house. And it's just for this room because the room was an add on to the house. Yeah. So we'd been smelling something I think for like a week, maybe kind of in denial, like, oh wow, that's a smell. That's interesting. And then uh, yeah, come to find that there's little droppings around the AC unit. Little shredding of stuff like chewed up bits of air conditioning falling out of the air conditioning unit.

Speaker 3:          00:33:37       And uh, turns out we've got a little rat just eating through the wire is living. What we did was cocked up every motherfucking hall. Now it's fucking dead in there. And also it smells much worse. Well here's the thing, here's the cool thing we have to replace absolutely everything course. It's at fortune tire unit, a whole new condenser. It's really fucking hard. That's all you do is the joy of home ownership. So yeah. Well first fucking so I'm, I wake up at, you know, six in the morning, find that this rat is in there. First thing I do, cause you're, you're not in town yet. I text our rat guy because we have a rat guy. Cause we live in an area where there's lots of shit and he shows up an hour later and he and I go around with the cocking gun and just seal it up.

Speaker 3:          00:34:24       He puts poison and the AC unit did all, there's so much poison in there. If that thing's not dead by now, that's like a bionic rat. I mean he just, he loaded it. He broke it up into pieces and if I can throw it, I mean we killed that fucker. I can't wait to see it's fucking carcass to nasty rat is going to be really fell by the time you see it. Thank God it's not so hot. I was kinda worried if it was old. I think it's going to stick to this. Dear Tom. I tried to see if my wife was ride or die chick. She is not without blinking. She said she would turn it in to protect our kids. So I girl, what if our son committed the murder? I saw her eyes start to twitch and her brain fucking exploded cause she said she would help cover it up.

Speaker 3:          00:35:08       What the fuck? She said she would still turn me in immediately, but no way in hell she would turn it on. This is your wife as terrible as mine. Jared, I think you have your answer already. I kind of agree. I kind of, why don't you think? Why wouldn't he tries to kill his mother is very rare. How many serial killers killed her mommy's? I know they need their moms, but how it happens for sure. Listen, to protect your child, I would do anything. I really would. You're an awful person. I would protect him. Awful. Both of them.

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       Hey Todd and Krista, last night I had a very strange dream that I met Tom in the airport. I was very excited to meet my favorite comedian whenever said, hey Tom, just wanting, you know, I'm a big fan. Tom and sat down in a chair next to me and asked me to sit down in the chair beside me. He's put his arm around and show up my shoulder and simply said, go fuck yourself buddy. It sounds about right. Quickly stood up, walked off. My question is, are you as huge a dickhead in real life? Thomas also, have either of you had strange dreams recently? Keep those jeans high and tight. Bird is as fat as he is. Racist. Austin. I like, I love this new racist to me with his comments are full of them and there's basically every other person is what did he do? What did he say? Ah, it's so fun. So much fun. First of all. No, I'm a sweetheart. You can ask anybody that walks up to me in public anywhere. I always take time. I always talk. Yeah. I always do pictures, whatever. Anybody wants to sign anything. Um, but I do think your dream is highly amusing and I love that I was a shit deck to you and your dream, but in real life it wouldn't go like that. No, you wouldn't do that. No. Hell No. I could see you being a bigger deck. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:36:49       The fuck out of here. I am so nice to people when I meet them. Are you crazy? Really? I am so nice to any, if anyone goes, hey mommy, and I'm out in public or yeah, I'm so thankful anybody even listens to our, our nonsense. Are you kidding me? No, I'm never have any crazy dreams lately without them. Yeah, you have. Well, I'll tell you one weird. I don't know if I mentioned this the, the night that Anthony Bordain died, I dropped about him. You told me that already. Yeah. I don't know if I told him on the show and this is before I heard about it. I'm saying simultaneously as he was in France, you know, and I woke up, I just dreamt about him and my friend texted me that he had died. I was like, well that's Kinda, that's a crazy one. Why? What is this a setup for? No, no, no. That person just said they had a crazy dream. They ass. I always have crazy dreams. What I'm saying? You always do. Yeah. What I dreamt about something I dreamt about tailgating and I woke up thinking how stupid it was. The people do this thing. Yeah. I don't like tailgating. Yeah. I jumped about, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:37:45       I don't like crowds. All right. Um, one here before we got to take it. We have a guest. We have two guests.

Speaker 3:          00:37:54       Okay. We have to, yeah. Sorry, go ahead. There's a few topics I want to get to before we break because they're very important.

Speaker 1:          00:38:00       Uh, hello shitless. I got a little insight into the be whole munching. My old lady always wants to eat this grim and I always say no, Jesus, I'm not a prude. And I do actually quite enjoy it just like the gays, but couldn't figure out why I didn't want her to. So with some long hard thought while Browning I came to the conclusion that I respected her too much as my wife. Yeah. No, she's a dirty Ho. I don't need her to spread open the swamp for my pleasure. She has no fucking idea what she's getting into. Thanks. I love you guys.

Speaker 3:          00:38:33       Isaac. Yeah. Cause he and loves his wife and would never want to subject her to the horrors of his Biehle piss on me. Beat me. Try it out. Try it out. Yeah. What does it fit? It's a foreign. Yeah. I don't, I don't feel that way. I um, no, you're just mean. Not Mean I'm making a request. You take advantage of my admiration of you. I love you. I admire you. Yeah. Like FIFO admires, get in there. No, get in there. Can I bring up one topic before we break very quickly. Very important by the way, that's important. Yeah. Okay. So Tom and I are about to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary. Come November 8th that's isn't that crazy. 10 years already. I knew Yaz Anus and, but we've been together 14 cause we dated for four. That's right. And the other night you go, hey, I wonder how many farts we've had together.

Speaker 3:          00:39:28       How many, how many fights have we shared as a couple over the course of 14 years? Yeah. And I thought what an interesting topic. We should save it for the show. Clearly our listeners would be very curious to know, let's do the math. How many times do you def, here's your farting. I'm going to do you're farting average. I'm gonna calculate. Okay, I'll pull up the calculator here. Okay. You fart every morning. Every morning. And I fought every morning too. So let's rack up. It's one in the morning and then you definitely do a nighttime fort where you, oh no. Yeah, there's a foreign in bed. There's a Fart when you pee. Oh, he's always talking about how many times did we fart in front of each other in 14 years. Yeah. But in front of you? Yes. That we participated in each other for, I would say let's go through your daily for, I would say that like on average there's probably a just woke up fart and far that you do.

Speaker 3:          00:40:20       Right. So then maybe like I would say like two in the bedroom area, maybe one in the kitchen. And this is, are we still in the morning? Yeah, we're still in the morning. Coffee break. Yeah. Yeah. You fart at breakfast and then I would say there's a mid day fart for sure. And then the lunch for the, again, I would say a two day is probably on average. Okay. Let me go through my morning. Okay. So I started in the morning and there's a morning for when I get up. There might be a fart slips out as I'm browning or peeing. Okay. There's definitely, if we're together, it's an after lunch fart. Yeah. Especially on this Paleo Diet. Yeah. And then I'm going to go for like an in bed or watching our bravo. Sure. You'd ever, they don't hold back there. I'm going to go for like half year daily war ever time at four. You're at eight. Let's do the math on that please. Okay. 365 but we're not together through 65 but we're just going to act. What's average? What's, what's a three 60 let's say doctor. I would say the date. Sorry, 350300300 days a year. But

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       let's say it together. Okay, let's, let's do that. So, okay, well that's easy for you. So that's 1200 parts a year for you. And then 14 years. 16,804 yeah. Wait a minute. Wait, hunt. Well, I'm 1200 a year of farts. And then what are you, you're double that. You're 2,400 yeah. Okay. So this is a yearly you fart. This is how many times I've probably far right? Yeah. 33,600

Speaker 7:          00:42:03       Oh, did you?

Speaker 1:          00:42:06       Okay. So you did 2,400 times 14 yeah. And that's how much? 33,600 and what's mine? I'm half of that. Yeah, right. Yeah. Well, it's half of that 16,800 I farted in front of you. Approximately 16 can we redo our vows and then incorporate this knowledge into our wedding vows? It's very possible. It's a lot of farts. A lot of farms.

Speaker 7:          00:42:34       Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:42:36       Can you believe there are couples who don't Fart in front of me? General. We're just talking to somebody about it. Just talking to somebody who's in a similar, I mean, two kids married. Yeah. And he was like, no. And I go, well yeah, I just hold it and yeah. And I, and he's like, it's happened. But then we asked like, what about your wife? He's like, never, not once, but think of all the fun you're missing out on if you're not farting in front of each other. Yeah. But maybe, maybe because of that they're eating each other's scrum or something. No, they're not. You don't know what about burps? That's the next tally we got to go to. Yeah. But he's real decent. You can tell he's way more mattered. Yeah. He's real deep. Yeah. He, he saw Hamilton and he likes Hamilton. I'll never fucking see that dumb shit rapping, you know, like rap.

Speaker 1:          00:43:19       Like let's go get our guests are our first yet got to get this going. Okay, Mommy. Okay. Now joining us is somebody who, if you saw me last year on the, uh, the no teeth, no entry tour and a number of cities, this young fine young man was with me. Um, to a lot of those, you saw me a tape to special in Denver. This young man was with me, young man and a, if you saw me in New Orleans or most recently in Eugene, Boise and Sacramento this past weekend, this was the opener who were very happy to say we'll also be helping us a lot more on the podcast with some production stuff. And uh, he's just an absolutely hilarious guy. It's Josh pottery. Hey Josh.

Speaker 7:          00:44:13       Oh, she was such a good song. This part's redundant by the way. Oh yeah. She was. Oh, what course are getting muddied by the whole damage once you do find Derek, how you doing? Hey, that shit true. It sounds like you've been really analyzing the song. Well, mudded is a gang. Bang. I didn't know. I didn't know that either. Yeah, it's an other songs too. Really? Yes. Little Troy talks about mountain girls. Wow. Yeah. So you can't, you can't Mutt a woman without the whole damn crew. Right. For those of you wondering why do they have Josh around? There you go. That's exactly why we bring Joshua. It's redundant. Yeah, I heard you saying, is it t e d o Oh, interesting. Another layer. Not mud and like, no, I, that's what I thought too. I was like, oh, it's anal sex.

Speaker 7:          00:45:23       But no, when I was in Florida as a kid was just a big tires driving through the mud. Like you want to go mud and go Medan yeah. That's also like hog in or what? I'll pick up like a gross. Uh, but this is, so you're telling us it's mutton. Mutton. We might ease go mutton with the cause. I don't know what it was either. At first. I want people to know how we met. I think like they're owed a little backstory. I met Josh in Buffalo, Buffalo in Buffalo doing uh, a club week, a few years ago, and then we did a bunch of gigs sense. Um, you were on the radio there too? I was. And so you know a lot about these mics if you don't have a lot of talking to him and stuff. The tall, that's deep, bro. We did an episode of that deeper.

Speaker 7:          00:46:15       That's right. Yup. Right when I moved here, that was like three weeks into living here. Oh my God. How nervous were you? Big Time. Nervous to let to live somewhere new. But now you're here. So how's it been? It's been like a, has it been a year? It's been a year. A little over a year. And how has your experience been? It's been quick. It went by way faster than I thought it would go. Yeah. You took the leap, take the leap. You took the leap. Yeah. It's been a lot of back and forth. Ups and downs, the whole roller coaster. I'm not mutton. We almost, we almost muddy this weekend, Bro. We talking about right. That's why, that's why I go on the road. What's up with that sex life? Are you getting your stick wet? Not In la, no, not yet. Yeah. Fenny any seventh for crew ladies are out there. We'll stop. I live on the first floor I lived on first. What is your Twitter handle at j underscore potter? Will you take or do you accept nudes? Fuck yeah. Okay. Okay. Checking.

Speaker 7:          00:47:16       I think a regular, um, nude recap. I think a nude and a sex report on how your sex life. Well, I don't want people to think if they send me nudes that I'm going to expose them. No, of course not. No. No. So you send me nudes and you'll have full, you know, discrepancy, confidentiality, confidentiality. That's the word I was looking for. That's right. Yeah. And I don't send Dick Pics. There you go. No, I don't know. I do if I get requested them. But you have to send five first five nudes first. Jesus. How is this going? How does fee, if you aren't worried about their dicks ending up on the Internet, like you're not afraid. Like one day you become like a huge comedian and they're like, oh, here's Josh potters cock back in 2000 part of my brand could be part of your brow.

Speaker 7:          00:48:01       I'm the Dick Guy. So now I would, cause I was never the single guy out there on the road. Do you ever, I mean, sometimes you know, we'll, we'll do our shows. We part ways. I'll be like, all right. I mean, do you ever go out there and you know, try to hit the bar that people might've been at? I wish, I mean, I go, it's so weird when you're alone in a place I don't have, like, I don't put off good vibes being alone in a bar. So it's really difficult to, you know, like who's coming up to me? So when you're in a city all alone, it gets weird. I don't know. It's not feel lazy, you know what I mean? Just thinking about it probably is better. Even though the statistically the numbers are less, probably is better. You better odds at Club after club clubs are insurmountable.

Speaker 7:          00:48:53       Easier to music though, because your intimate days. Yeah. Yeah. You know, you're drinking in the lobby after they're like, you can run right into them, right. Theaters. You're like, you kind of, it's really, it's like the Gazelle are all in the lobby in the bar area. And if it's like a Friday, you could be like, Hey, I'm got two more tomorrow. Can we drink or something, you know? Oh, right. You can hit them up multiple days. So have you been, are you a somebody that scores on road? We go, I wish, I mean, I, it's not for lack of effort. Uh, I just haven't, there are times, I mean, don't get me wrong, the only time I've ever gotten laid was from comedy. I didn't lose my virginity until I started doing comedy. That's hilarious. Isn't that wild? Like a killer? Like how long ago was this by the way?

Speaker 7:          00:49:39       I was 22 when I lost my for, yeah. Now he's like, after the Eugene, you're 20, you're 22 and j like a really good set that night. Um, no, it was, I had to lay the groundwork like I always do. They probably had to see multiple sets, really get a feeling for how I was not on stage too. So, but crushing in front of a girl is like my favorite thing. That's got to be great. It is dude. It's the best. So is it the best? What's the best? Is the best if you kind of meet someone before and, and you have no, no, that's the worst. No, I'm saying, and then you blow him away. Is that you at that it depends. I mean if you meet someone before they have preconceived notions about you and then if you have a set where you're talking about wild shit, they're like, Ooh, you know, they might get kind of freaked out by the best scenario

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       is just killer set. Meet somebody. Yes. And then they come up to you afterwards and they're like, you were really funny. And like, hi, Tom z did a girl, Josh, I saw you up there and you're really funny. We'll assess. What are you doing later? What's up? Uh, nothing. Uh, my, I left my panties in my car. Oh really? Let's go. See we're going to find now she'd have like drunk girlfriends and stuff too. Yeah. Oh definitely. He's probably had, she's like, have you had like the uh, the deal got fucking sidetracked by the Bachelorette?

Speaker 7:          00:51:02       Yeah. Sometimes. Well also like Tiffany, no, he's crazy. Obviously you went last time when you and I do shows together, it's a different vibe than like say if I did a show with a single comic, right. Whose only purpose is like I got to get laid to yes. And then I'm usually the guy that has to play the defense for those friends. You know, he picks the target and then I'm the one who like taking out the bogeys, you know, that feels like it's a skill though in and of itself, right? I guess so. I mean, you just have to distract them. You really just have to lower your, your own standards for yourself. And he's not in terms of like the like how they are just like in terms of like not having any, any sort of preconceived things going in, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:51:47       Yeah. So you actually, what you're saying is you will actually spend time doing, speaking to someone. You have no interest speaking. Exactly. Yeah. She's such a sweet guy. Yeah. You're so nice that when I'm out there looking at it for a second wife, number two, we're going to have it. We're going to be, I'm just saying you're going to meet her on the road. She's probably anybody's plan. That's the best place. Me and my friends think you're totally, hi, me and my friends. They always say it wrong. Yeah. Growing up, how would you, you would have a wife number two as opposed to just having hoes in different area codes. Smash city for a run right away. You're no, Josh, you're asking, uh Oh, I'm dead. I'm gone. Yes. Oh yeah. I have hoes in different area codes. Wife, a mom. No, I'm not going to wife up immediately. It's smashed city for a while. Yeah. And then the one who's like, I'll eat your, but I put the ring. Oh, stop it. Stop it. Don't you dare bring those hose near my children. Is that a sticking point? Fuck you. You want it. And you won't give a, it's constant. Yeah. But it's also we just learned from an email or a listener email, it's a sign of immense disrespect to ask your spouse. It basically, this guy was like, my wife wants to and I respect her too much. Wow. This animal like,

Speaker 7:          00:53:08       I mean, that's true. Actually. That's a good point. It's gotta be tough. You're his wife, but you get to a certain point where you're so close that it's like,

Speaker 3:          00:53:17       who cares? Yeah. Nope. Right there yet. You have to get to that point. And that's what Josh, the problem is, is that I, I have intimate knowledge

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       of his dumps and his farts and what he's capable of. And I hear it every morning through the wall. And it sounds horrendous, but would you be deterred if you hadn't had that? Like wouldn't you still not do it if I didn't, if I didn't hear what? You didn't have any of that knowledge? No, I would not do it. It's just like nothing you would ever, it's not, it's not for me, but it will say Ryan Gosling's like eat this booty from scrum and I floss with his fucking pubes. Yeah. So you're not against the act. It's just kidding. I want to lane, but he looks cleaner than, you know, if he was like on all fours and he was like, hurry up and reach under and do the

Speaker 8:          00:54:03       yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:11       Gosling. Gosh, I do like him so much now. One of the things, I mean I, I love about Josh. He's a great comic. Everything about he's great, he's great, but we always have like, you're not here. We always will like laugh at, uh, you know, just fucked up clips, things that, that we, you know, we'll show each other things, sending each other videos. He's like your friend that's ground zero for all the weird shit that man. So I go look man. So, so to give people more information, we've been working on a, uh, transition to expand our show. Um, there's, there's a transition. I thought you're talking about your own. I am. I am transitioning into a man, but I do think like, I grew this hair this weekend. I'm looking more and more mail every week, but congratulations. Thank you very much. Um, but you know, we're trying to expand the show.

Speaker 1:          00:55:05       We have a studio space that were outfittings to, uh, to start doing the show from hopefully without dogs. Dogs are part of the show, but, uh, she's going crazy over there anyway. We want Josh to, uh, to work with us in this new space and pumped, so pumped. And so basically, um, I need that to stop. Can you please do something about that? Hey, I know she's off of it. Uh, she was going to go back just giving him, how about we just pick it up? Do you mean, how about you? How about you picking? I'm asking you so stupid. In order to introduce you to the show, the idea was that you would pull some of your, pull some clips, whatever you want to, you know, introduce it to the audience. And I thought, why not start with something? I'm very well versed in pornography. Okay. Um, here's all I know. All I know is that I have four files. Okay. These are separated into four files for us to genre genre's. Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:56:24       Um, I'll let you direct. I haven't seen anything. I just knew that like we're going to introduce Josh to the audience that Josh is going to introduce clips to us. Is there anything I can, should I, should I just play them at random? I'm not at rent. Maybe an order in the order that they're, so the first one I see is died. I did I do that. We can start there because I mean, here's the thing. Yeah. I mean maybe you don't remember this because you're married now and yeah. Got It. You got to do all your business calls, but most of the day I am in a hotel room and this isn't stuff that I TJ's to necessarily, but when you just, you have a lot of time after that to kill and there's so much stuff. These websites are like target. It's one of the most interesting things is like there's, there's stuff that you like and then there's the curious stuff.

Speaker 7:          00:57:17       Yes. It makes you go like is that really a thing? Right, exactly. And all these sites, they put them there for you. Like I said, they're like target. You go in getting what you need and you come out with a whole bunch of other shit that you didn't even know existed. It's pretty amazing. All right, so I will start, I'll play this. I have a feeling that a lot of this is going to be blurred out. Yeah. Well this one is a pretty self explanatory. Let's see what it says. Let's see what we got here. Uh, Josh Potter. Target. Yeah, no, that accent sounds familiar by the way. And then she does see what's this over here? That's a, that looks like a Binky, right? I mean, I'm not familiar with baby toys, but I think that's what she's using it for. Yeah. So in case you didn't know that she was going, uh, he or she is showing you a better angle to know that she is definitely gone 100%.

Speaker 7:          00:58:15       This isn't just a pomp and circumstances for people not watching this, showing you too. There is a pretty attractive blonde Chang. Rub It in there. She's wearing and she just peed in the die, die and she's showing us just making sure, you know, she also rubbed her at her anus specifically. She's getting the pee all around there. Yeah. So important. And in case you really didn't know, so you really needed like definitive proof that she really could. I don't know. I don't know if I believe that she writes. It can all be acting. Yeah. And I don't like acting. I want the real thing. Oh. Oh, oh, uh, accent is very familiar to me. It sounds like my old step mom sound like her. Yeah. Yeah. It does. A vet. A vet diaper. She would do that. Uh, do you think she would do that?

Speaker 7:          00:59:05       Yeah. No I would. How much money you think that I don't understand why every girl doesn't have an Instagram account for their feet. By the way. That's something that's easy to get that money. Do you think they get money? Just, no, not just for posting them. Sure. You get the build the followers, it's like, oh, I'm going to start selling. And you put like a bottle of tide next to your feet or something. Product places. Yeah. But whatever they, whatever's selling ads out there. That's right. Like, so then Ford's like, Hey, we've got a new f one 50, or will you put your feet on the steering wheel? Yeah. She was like, yeah, of course. Hey guys, you want to come in a Ford? Yeah. I think you're right Josh. I think every woman should have of feed account, uh, pissing in the diaper account.

Speaker 7:          00:59:52       I Dunno. I think it's a big leap. You got to really jump to peeing in the diaper. That's more than feet. I mean, Hey, if you can do it, do it. But yeah, if he can do it, I would do farming and paying in the diaper easy. Yeah, no problem. Easy, easy. There was some things in between those. I would love Josh, if you were a hot check and see this stuff pull off with your knowledge now. Yeah. Um, yeah. So that now are, just out of curiosity, are you into p I am not into p this is this. The thing that's weird about that is that they're appropriating paraphilia. Oh, oh, oh, right. It was like I went potty. It's weird. Right. And the only thing more evil than pedophilia is the n word. Oh, okay. Okay. Good segue one up here. I might be, because that next, there's no video. That's okay. Okay. There's probably a reason for that. Let's see. Okay. Oh dear.

Speaker 9:          01:00:54       So I have a funny question to ask you guys. Is it cool if I say the n word? It turns me on. Just say the n word. I'm young Nigga and nigger day. Oh, okay.

Speaker 7:          01:01:15       What's she doing? She's not showing her love. I just see audio file. Yeah, there. There's a lot of loving going on in those lessons

Speaker 9:          01:01:27       right now.

Speaker 7:          01:01:34       My favorite thing, by the way, genre, it's a genre. There are two facets of it. Easy. There are the women who enjoy saying it, and then there are the men who enjoy getting the women to say it. Oh, fascinating. Yeah. So, so there's basically the reluctant woman. Yes. This woman. That's why she's like, are you have any questions? Oh, right. I have a funny one. Yeah, it was a silly question. What's hilarious question.

Speaker 9:          01:02:04       Fuck you, nigger. Hello.

Speaker 7:          01:02:08       So what category is she? She's, she's the one who loves them and loves saying it. That's what turns her on. It's saying that word. That's what we've done to the word. We've made it so evil that it's now so taboo that it's turning people onto stuff. Genre. Like I wonder how many people really are into that one. I don't know. What do you think? What's bigger demographic? Bigger audience. The pissing in the die die or the n word saying probably pissing.

Speaker 10:         01:02:38       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:02:42       Oh, you're the expert, Josh. It's a brand of cause that's something to be decent links. Oh my gosh. Yeah. Accents

Speaker 7:          01:02:58       foreign. No, I think it's like that accent is like Jersey isn't, yeah. Yeah. Just whore. Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

Speaker 10:         01:03:08       Shit. Oh Man. I just love nigger juice. Geez. Wow. Dark Shit.

Speaker 9:          01:03:18       Pretty physical by, uh, say the n word.

Speaker 10:         01:03:23       That cool.

Speaker 7:          01:03:27       Dumb like that. I didn't really read a lot growing up. Oh yeah. Creation. No worries. Where she says, uh,

Speaker 9:          01:03:32       is it called by say the n word

Speaker 7:          01:03:35       that that Dan Lauer the defense. You can't see her in that moment. She is skewered. So there is a, wow, just one fella there. There's a couple of them. Oh really? Yeah. She's a pretty bold to ask such a question. I think it was cleared before they record it. That's the fun part though is when you don't know. Yeah. I have a funny question. I have a silly, funny, quite frivolous thing to know. There are some that are like God that are just like urine and word and then they're like, oh shit. You know, like they get mad but it's ultimate reparations cause then they punish the girl for sure.

Speaker 10:         01:04:18       That's also the fun of the video. Yes. Gotcha. Wow. Wow. There's so much shit. Really Nasty, nasty, nasty. Um, she talks just like you're dumb girl. Impression. Do that as I have a five a class done that I'm wired

Speaker 7:          01:04:38       and then you have to go up on every, the out of fun to you are now I smile. You smile ear to ear when I come across those for sure. Not because of them saying the n word was just special. Do you know what I'm seeing here? Oh yes, this is a gentleman who is a real, you know, these people that go around to homes. And so what happened by the way, is blue bear of a blue van prep these so that he didn't have to blur them afterwards cause this is all I have in this is just a single shot. Well that's, this one was pretty rough according to hit him. So, um, according to him, you know, there are angels in world who go home to home their caretakers. They take care of people who are in need. This gentleman takes it to another level as you can see, servicing a woman who is a disable the disabled, disabled, extraordinarily disabled I would say.

Speaker 7:          01:05:36       And uh, he is just, I mean if you got to see this video, you wouldn't know. It would be like he was servicing, uh, uh, a supermodel the way he is, his vim and vigor, you know, he really gets in there. Yes. Which is just pure. I mean, his heart must be so big. I wish we had some audio from it. So is it, um, you can imagine there's really not much dialogue happened. And she's, I mean she's, it's obviously like a, an advanced chair that she, it is some wild apparatus that is difficult to understand how it exactly operates being a layman but incapable of movement, incapable of her, her lower body movement yet. Do you think she, I don't know, deserve Eugene at work work? I think she's feeling something. Does she make noises? Yes. That are conducive to enjoying something like that? Yes.

Speaker 7:          01:06:42       I'm surprised you didn't have any video. I thought there would be a little bit, but it is is great. Gray. The blue band, it didn't put anything in here. This is all shot clear. That's all he cleared. He told me it's a bit rough. Wow. And that guy sees everything. So is this, by the way, in your churches, did this all, was this a genre, did you find it was, I mean people, there are so many different varieties of disabled porn really. There are people with limbs missing in my life, things like that. Like the ones that the limbs missing, they, I think they really found their lane because a lot of them use tools that they then screw on to their stumps, for lack of a better word for it. And then they can have sex better with these tools, if you will. But yeah, there are all sorts of, and I think those people, if you have a fetish for disabled people, you shouldn't be looked at as a monster.

Speaker 7:          01:07:48       You should be looked at as a hero because who else is sex and those people up, right? For sure. What do you do it? I don't think I have the bone or stamina to, uh, maintain something like that. Not like that superhero that we just saw. That guy was real full boar. He was, God bless him. I Dunno. I really don't know. I haven't been put into that scenario. I wonder if women feel that way when they sleep with me. They're like, oh, there's a man. You're sleeping with a blind boy. For people that don't know, Josh has very poor vision. Yes. I'm sure they can see, well, I dunno. He can't hear that. I'm blind. But yes. No, I always wondered that if the women feel like they're doing it a service, when they sleep with me, does it bother you to know what the whatever they need to get through it.

Speaker 7:          01:08:34       You know? And I've had the same thoughts. So charity work, I'm like, I'll take the mercy. I don't care. Yeah. Hell yeah. People listening, Josh isn't as in totally blind. We're not saying that. So explain your cause he has to be able to see these clips. He's wonderful clips that he's bringing it. Yeah, I can see right there. Yeah. Yeah. But also to be clear, he's well on his way. I'm not flying a jet anytime. Okay. Um, so that leaves us with one last clip was, is this the save the best for last kind of scenario? I think so. I thought that one was going to be last. Gosh. Well this is the, this is all I have. I have a couple of clips here at the end. One is the n words pretty big. Which one is the most wild too? So far? The diaper stuff.

Speaker 7:          01:09:21       I'm like, all right. I think the n word stuff is just bizarre to me. Like I get some that toll sex thing, like it's mental stimulation. It's weird, right? It's taboo. So maybe that's why there's some, but I guess it's connected to hate. Yeah. I don't know what the connection is there. Dad clearly didn't love and words. I think the PA get cause it's all the infantilism or whatever it is. You get that one. That's the one I least understand. You know why? Because I changed diapers every day and I maybe there's some connection to your mom or your dad lovingly taking care of you as you, as you were if you were a baby. So maybe they want to be cared for, like they're small babies or something. I don't know. Uh, yeah, I mean I think the p one I just kind of go like, Nah, Piss the disabled one makes me think like, well actually, you know, everybody wants some love and so, yeah, right.

Speaker 7:          01:10:17       Everyone needs something impressive that the guy can do it like this. Because I saw an interview with a porn guy once and they asked him something, they would ask him about this, but they're like, what happens if like you, uh, I don't know, don't like the girl or something, something like that. And he was like, oh, I always try to think about something else to get me through the scenes. I see. So there are different place. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, but, but to be able to do that, I want to know that Santa is not real in this case. I like to hope that one's homemade and that guy's just a hero that goes around the community. The n word one to think about that is that, you know, it's very taboo, which may be for everyone in that room adds to the excitement of the situation.

Speaker 7:          01:10:59       Like makes the Adrenalin kind of pump. I feel like if I was the white camera guy, I'd be like, he needs to chill the fuck out girl. Be like, because like I said, some of it is because obviously this is a white woman, some of it is the African American gentlemen telling her, I want you to say that. Oh, right. Right. And then, but my favorite is when she is like out of nowhere. I don't know where like, hey can I asked some of them don't do that. That's interesting. The one that's down ass, that's when we know they're all like what the fuck?

Speaker 7:          01:11:36       But then they deliver a punishment. Punishment. Yeah. That may make it, yeah. This last one I think is just fun. It's just what happens here. This is the last one here. It's everyone's scariest, uh, scenario. US military forces are on their way from what I understand. And um, we plant our seed in the belly of the infidels the way, although we'll grow with it within, so this is like, this is, this is nine 11 porn baby that is supposed to be Osama bin Ladin is running out for us. So some people don't, they can't see right there. It was like a summer look alike. And another guy indicated in a cave delivering one of those, you know, anti-American message, like look in the production is great on it because it's all grainy and they did it in a Web Cam and then Veronica cane is live from Afghanistan. I can't believe she got that assignment so crazy.

Speaker 7:          01:12:43       So she's reporting back about it. Um, he'll fall into the hands of the Northern Alliance and the special forces. I don't think so. Veronica. So Veronica says that, uh, well she's just reporting on this live store. She's just in Afghanistan. Yeah. Covering the news, covering the hunt for Osama female newscasters have long hooker nails. I'll tell you right now. I'm going to ask you for the link to this one. Let's see. Oh, they got, oh no. First Daniel Pearl now her. Oh, touching our woman's boobs. Yeah. Uh, I like how they speak. I wonder if that's actual three quarters of the, what's going on, a whole bunch of stuff. I wonder if this is the diligent lane birch. They are, they've captured or they're torturing her for answers. Most likely. Do you think that's the real life? That wasn't really blurred out. Well,

Speaker 7:          01:14:03       hovered three quarters of the screen and left just a vagina and a dildo. Do you think that was the proper translations for the language? Think so. I think they were like, we're looking for authentic speaker. Must speak Arabic and it's true. It did sound just like, wow, I wonder if they let Ronica go after that. I don't know. I mean what's worse? Getting beheaded by them or that's the, I'm all spitting on her. That's the torture. Who got off better though, right? Man? That's gotta be a fun scene to shoot that one. Oh yeah. Really Fun.

Speaker 7:          01:14:46       I think I'd rather get John Mccain, John Mccain. Do you'd rather be like John Mccain like, uh, I, I think, you know, I didn't check. He got a w I'll have to dub him that. Yeah, get captured by the VC. Oh, they torture this shit. Seriously. Then be raped by a bunch of terrorists like that. I don't know which one I would prefer. You want bamboo under your fingernails or Dixon? You don't want the Dixon? Me. Okay. How about this scenario? Would you rather, you're going to be with the VC and they're gonna beat the fuck out of you. Break your arm, fuck up your shoulder, break your ribs, knock you out a few times and keep you for a year and then you're freed or three guys spit on. You stick Dick's and Dildos in your hon, but then they let you go when they're done. One instance. Yeah. How often are you getting beaten? You're getting beaten once every, you get some form of beating every week. Okay. How would take the Dix from the Arabs? Yeah, for sure. 100% over a year of beat down. You get to leave after? Yeah, but I feel like I'd be more traumatized sex. Really?

Speaker 7:          01:16:02       Man, I need to rough you up a little bit. What would you take all the dicks one day? A beat down every week for a year where they shit on you. I'm just getting beaten today. It's a year, but then I wouldn't be able to be intimate with somebody after something like, well you just go to therapy. That's like how long is their dildo session on? It's like three and a half hours. I could do it. They spit in your face, you know, they call you an infidel. I can't do it. And then they go, this is like, this is a message from my law, and they look unloading. You really ended up three of them. Okay, here's the bad part. The three of them, they want to empty their balls multiple times. Here's the thing, what if they empty their balls and then they liked liked America afterwards? Your country is saying, I can single handedly stop the conflict in the middle of the sacrifice myself. Yes. They're like, oh, blonde haired woman, and then they're like, oh, America's pretty dope actually. Yes. Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:17:10       I would sacrifice myself for America. Yes. Oh, well I want greater good. I would for the grant. Yes. I didn't realize you had that in you. I would. Would you? Are you taking for fun anyways? Yeah, yeah, yeah. For Saturday night for you to answer sounded fun. Hell yeah. I'll look at you two pigs spitting on me and they're like American and for that I'm like, yeah, what's up man? I'd be like, I have a funny question now. What would be, do you think it be? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:17:40       Worse that if all those guys um, empty themselves in you rectally.

Speaker 10:         01:17:47       I have a good one too or in the throat. Ooh Damn.

Speaker 7:          01:17:51       I would prefer a rectally proud I yeah, because you can fart all that shit out of you. Right? You can basically shit ges out of you. You can't get it out of your,

Speaker 10:         01:18:01       I have to check with a doctor friend of mine weight. But here's the thing that can give you, like I say that. Here's the thing though, they can give you like, but herpes and stuff. Do you know what I mean? Like he knows better than mouth herpes. Yeah. I would rather get the in my, but then in my mouth. What about, yeah. So I have a funny question to ask you guys. I would rather have, but herpes and mouth herpes. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Cause at least you can kind of hide it from peeps. You can really hide it and I kind of hide it. That's probably the best place to have herpes is your, but I know is it, uh, I mean, uh, as if you had to have herpes anywhere, where would you, where would you prefer other than a doctor? A doctor friend,

Speaker 1:          01:18:45       uh, told me that, you know, he treats all this stuff and he said that, um, a lot of times guys are embarrassed or just ignore to course all of this stuff and we'll wait until it is like a raging inflammation. Yes, of course. What do they ignore? A genital wart. All the signs.

Speaker 7:          01:19:07       What are they like, oh, there's a wart on my dick, but that's okay.

Speaker 1:          01:19:10       Going by the time they go, they, by the time that he sees them, it is completely covered. There's a stench. It's like, it looks like, it looks like, um, like, like a feature film Fx, like for, you know, an alien on there, Dick Shot. And then they're like, is this something? And then they go to him like, this feels like this should be looked at it.

Speaker 7:          01:19:32       This is why girls need to, where you need you to not have sex with dirty dudes. Yeah. I, uh, I did my fantasy football draft a couple of weeks ago. I know you like, would you rather is my, uh, high school friend posed one to me that I thought was very interesting. I think you'd particularly enjoy this one. Ah, okay. So I'll pose it to you. If you had to sleep with Tom, but it was your father's brain next whatever the other one is. Well then it would be Tom's brain in your father's.

Speaker 10:         01:20:05       Ah, then that, oh

Speaker 7:          01:20:07       gosh. At least I could close my eyes. Tom's brand, my dad's body, unfortunately inside of the shell. And I would, yes, I would just block out in the vessel and just thinking of Tom, people would think you were crazy. Some people don't choose that one, isn't it weird? Fucked up, right. Wait, what would you guys choose? Yeah, I would try to choose the vehicle over the brain. Oh, you would choose, I would choose the brain over the vessel. I think you have to choose the, the brain. But that's your mom. Exactly. Talk to me, Dude. I'm about to come to know because you have to start talking. You'd have to keep reassuring me. Like, don't worry that it's these voice me.

Speaker 7:          01:20:54       I'd be like, oh, shut up. I will leave if I keep talking. No, that's fucked up potter. Oh, sorry. That's so hard. Are you today are pouring discussion? Both of you guys, would you rather do the porno Middle Eastern thing that we just saw? You're just an actor. You're the girl. Okay. And all those guys fucking jet on you. And it's just like what we have workday or you do the n word scenario thing. You're the girl, but you're doing it in real life. Like you're with two black dudes and you're a blonde girl and it's real life. And you're like, excuse me, I have a funny question. And you just kind of roll the dice and layers to that one because I think a pretty girl could get away with doing that and I don't know. I really do. They would be like, oh, you want to say some shit?

Speaker 7:          01:21:48       Huh? Take care of it the same way. I feel like it wouldn't be very different than the porno Sydney. Right. Am I wrong? It would, uh, a switch it and let's turn the tables. You're a white guy with a black girl. Okay. Yeah, that was, I have a question for you. Yeah. Do you mind if I call you the n word? Here's the thing though, because this, this, this applies to every time the scenario was brought up. What type of person are we dealing with? Because if you're talking to talking about this as a straight up animalistic sex act, like there's nothing that sexy thing I think you can get away with a lot more crazy. But if you're talking about like, I went on a date or dinner and were like, I got a silly little questions. I you, yeah, I don't think that would fly.

Speaker 7:          01:22:36       Uh, I know this might turn you off to keep this one for third day. Yeah. That's a scenario. It's this nice girl. Like you take everything you want to call her that and you gotta ask, man, if it's really your kink, I mean, it's a bad one to volunteer. I think you would, what you would do is you'd probably, you try to find a way there. You'd have to with uh, without being, you can't just be like out of the gate. Say it. Yeah. You got to start like playing music and get her take, you know, maybe you watch something that you watch some w Kamau bell show and be like, what do you think about all this? Where do you stand? Where do you stand? And she's like, I mean, it's cool. And you're like, cool. Who are you? Like an activist? Cool. So what you're telling me is you, what would you rather do?

Speaker 7:          01:23:26       The Porno, Middle Eastern thing. You're a girl or a real life. Well, I need to ask this check if you can say the end. It'd be terribly, you've got one day, it'd be terribly embarrassing for it to go wrong. Obviously horrible, horrible. But even that shame is not as bad as being spit on and filled up by like in a porno world, a bunch of terrorists. Your job. Now this is just your, and the other scenario of the Middle Eastern scenario. You're quite literally just like the actress that day. So I get paid. You get paid 50 old dollars, so you get paid to do the the porno version of that, what you saw or a girl that's your life or in real life, you take the girl out and ask her. Correct. I think I would still take the real girl and and risk being humiliated. I'll take the payday.

Speaker 7:          01:24:15       50 bucks. 50 bucks. That's it. Ah. Now you're making me think about it. Realistically, what do you think a girl gets for that fit that 1500 bucks? I'd take it. It's like 1500 bucks. I'm, yeah, yeah, yeah. I would take the real life scenario and risk just because I don't want to be in and be like on this date with this nice guy. I've got to ask you a silly question. Side question. I think a lot of guys would be, would tolerate it. I think it would fare better for you than it would for us. Get Away with, we can, we can talk some shit. He can say some crazy shit. Yeah. You can be like, can I, can I call Your Dad Fag? And he'd be like, all right. He might think he might be like, it's kind of hot guys think everything. And also what happens to a guy who was a woman?

Speaker 7:          01:25:01       Like if you go on and ask a guy, can I ask you a silly question? Can I call you the n word? No matter what, unless he is really like his whole life is doing the right thing. He's going to be like, this bitch is going to be the freakiest of all time just for asking me that. She's going to be such an animal that probably most I think it would be like, yeah, sure. And then they might even take a thrill in like you were saying those things where like they just didn't punish you. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Now saying it as a guy to a woman, that brings up an interesting different scenario. I might have to look up that kind of see if that porn exists. Yeah. That would be a totally different dynamic though. How unbelievably different scary dynamic. Now what if, uh, what if you went out with an African American woman and then she asked you to do that? I would. I would do it, but I would be hesitant still. It would take a lot. I'd have to maybe have a few glasses of wine, you know, it's so loosen me up a little bit. Yeah. I don't know if I could be like, and she's like louder. Louder. You Bitch. I'm like, I don't think I'd have that Alpha in me to be able to do that.

Speaker 1:          01:26:19       Yeah. Good stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:27:50       Okay. So Boyle Heights. So it's a rough neighborhood. But I grew up in like in the intersection where most of the housing projects were in Boyle heights.

Is it, is, is doing standup for the first time tied to you getting out of Rehab was like, you know what I mean? Connected

Speaker 11:         01:37:56       in some way. Yeah. When I was in Rehab. Um, how old were you? I was like 21, 22 years old. Okay. I was in Rehab and um, I never, I never really spoke in public. Oh actually I did. And kindergarten, but like, you know, you have an assembly with some kid or read in Spanish wanted to do in English, I would read in Spanish. And um, there's other rehabs, so they were like a bunch of men, heroin addicts, everyone. And this guy named Tim for the separately and low value mission. He was like a Catholic priest? No, no. A brother, like naturally. Then he did like the sad work for the priest missionary.

Speaker 11:         01:38:36       So he will talk and come up with crazy games. And then he asked everybody, write down your dreams in life. So I wrote down, you know, I have a dream where I wake up with no money, but I have money whenever, you know, or a nicotine class, he'll know. Not those kind of dreams, your goals. So we wrote, okay, I want to be a comedian. I want to go to Italy because I love olive garden. Three, four, and five. I don't know. I love all the garden plan I know for to get the bread and salad. That's awesome. Until you really, you really, at that time though, you're like, I want to be a standard. That dream. Like I know you said you first heard delirious, but from then did you get into standup a lot more after that? Yes. Um, it was like during, like we had a VCR and in the back of the days of your borrow movie for somebody, there's like six movie attached to it.

Speaker 11:         01:39:30       Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, it was Paula. Mandy, you then because he was a Latin guy. No, we know, we know who we'd like to hear more because we leave, we related to him or his drugs were silly, you know, funny for us. We couldn't remember. I'm better like kind of like Richard Pryor. Like I'm like, I never heard of these jokes, but my friends were, I remember, um, poetry. You were performed at Beverly at a Belvedere Park, at this annual Latino, first of all, for Mexican Independence Day during the 80s. Like it was deep man. Like, like if you went there, you knew what gang was there and it was mine or via mobile via projects because of the fair was in the minor be a projects bothered you ever connected to the project so that we're Columbus here grew up those projects really, but their gang is deep Monrovia projects, right? Like, I'm going to be a gang, but it was like a clash of so many gangs there. There was always a fight, but I would never there I was too young to go. But my friend will tell me, yeah, Paul [inaudible] was there. He throw it to tear the everybody can do to control it, but he goes up to tears. It was true. Or the audience would do it. The fight come are backed up by the Mexican frisbee.

Speaker 11:         01:41:09       That's hilarious man. So that's, I saw and then they shop boy needs to lay in my neighborhood. Were you tempted to get in gang shit at all? Like being exposed to it? I got, I wasn't like I got a job. You did? Yeah, without, cause I used to hang around with these kids that were break dancers. Yeah. They became gangs and we started selling crack and that was where the heck is wrong with him. And what's that? We were jumping a bunch of people because they were doing bad and I started jumping over to somebody say, man, we do a jump your ses. So then they got jumped in. Oh Shit. So then you were in, yeah. Which gang? Gang of the projects. So they do run with them after that for a little while to attach with a big fight with my neighbor, one of my neighbors when neighbors called because whatever, I was like, I'm out of here man. Like I was on PCP. Wow. No, no, that's the most popular drug in my neighborhood.

Speaker 11:         01:42:19       Who would drive up and um, the goal at this 15 [inaudible] a little vial and dip like a new new port or a coup cigarette and they had their own pores and they'll be like, okay, here's $15 all day long. Get Wet. Yeah. Yeah. So what does it feel like to, let's say incredible whole cable? Don't grade like a woman, like lift a car. The parents, you know, if you're like already crazy and you're mad when you're doing it, you're going to go and do crazy stuff. What if you're in a chill state of mind and you do it? What does my friend Eli, that guy was a guy that he fixed everyone's card, the neighborhood, he'll start smoking PCP, PCP. So I was fixing somebody Volkswagen and he'll stay like, you know, holding the wrench for like two hours straight without moving. But what happened to me was I just put it, watch it terminated to oh shows pumped up the APP man. Shit, I was cheeky. One of those sports bottles, you know those sports bottles, NPM. But I fill it up with long island ice tea. So I was ready when it got to the neighborhood. This guy picked a fight with me. He had just came out of prison. I was like, I was like, because his old man, what do you want to fight me? He was like 30, I was 22. Why you want to fight me? Did you ask him?

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       You got into a fight with him?

Speaker 11:         01:43:53       Yeah. And um, because they call me Batman but he'll call you be like fat man or Whack Matt or Huh? Hello? Just, yeah, bad names. What are they ignoring him? But he started pushing me and they're like, I'll take chuck away. Then he pushed me, then I went for the sucker punch I have missed. Oh, how'd that end up? Oh bad cause out. He caught a punch, be it, I'll paste, my notes are bleeding and my mother immediately punch me again. I but then I started like, I don't know, he was killing me. You know, he'll fucking be up. But oh he got, he got rid of just like in a choke hold one of those holes, you know? Yeah. I guess a UFC hold they will call him now to hold. Yeah. Yeah. But you know people was talking about, you know, this is what you good move.

Speaker 11:         01:44:45       This is what you do if you are going to do is move, not matter. This is what you do. You bite them off earlier off, go left, go right away. Yeah. For good about whatever they touch you anywhere else. Yeah. You buy through her off they let go man. Yeah. I've been happy with can you let go ahead right there. She started crying like a little girl. Whoa. Cause it's always pinging him up and you don't matter. That's one of the, I want to see that quarter of Carter fight. And though, you know what happened afterwards and how it, what led to it, that's a real fight. Even ever been pudge. You don't, you don't know what I'm talking about. Yeah. So the adrenaline was going and PCP was in my head.

Speaker 11:         01:45:26       Is it a full bottle? It took me about it. I thought a whipping him look up like an idle board with a belt. Yeah. Wow. It's when meg who call on his face. Yeah. Nice. But I blacked out after that other than no anything have a, but they told me that, um, his brother's jumped in and I felt both of them and they beat me up because I knew I had more helicopter blood on my tee shirt. Whoa. He paid his fucking ear off. Yeah. The tip. Did you taste the blood? It was, I don't remember better. What's the, is the feeling in PC? Is it body high? Your whole body? Like you feel very slow. Very slow. Hmm. But, uh, but uh, I guess the anger triggers it. Yeah. Well, they say sometimes, you know, talk to cops about, you know, uh, fights they've been in and how like a guy who's really amped up on PCP can, they can have like 10 guys trying to take them down. Yeah. We'll fucking keep it.

Speaker 3:          01:46:29       Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this one LAPD started using Taser guns choke holds because of like PCP, PCPs. I want to say no, I'm serious. I think you might be right. They couldn't like restrain people and they had to start shooting them with the Taser guns. They might be, you might be right and if you even got shot with a Taser on a PCP, you'd be like, wow, like you was like your favorite drug. Then

Speaker 11:         01:46:51       the, the last time I did it was then. Yeah. Oh Wow. Okay. Well, yeah, you put some guys you're off. It's pretty wild. Yeah. But it's funny, like people would just pop out a PCP joy anywhere. Like birthday parties. What? Yeah, man, I was at a birthday party, like, come holy the goats, you know, like behavior gold with rice and beans, tortillas and birthday cake. They, somebody got a Batman that it goes to poke a PCP, joy over there that's said, all right. So I, my foot two bites and a little of their red smoke, the smoke with it and dirty with it later through in the car.

Speaker 3:          01:47:32       Ah. They're like, Holy Shit. What about, did you ever do math

Speaker 11:         01:47:43       crystal meth? Not like, um, everybody, you know, when there was some old dead yeah, I didn't know how to do that. Like I thought it was for losers.

Speaker 3:          01:47:54       Yeah. Well math was popular in the 90s if I recall everyone highs. It was cold ice, right? Yeah. Or, yeah. And you're a stepsister. Yes. Yes, that's right. Had a little problem with it. Yeah. It was pretty popular in the 90s and it was always in the clubs when I was a goth girl. Ever. All the goths are doing, you can get into that. No, I didn't. I was afraid of it. I was afraid of it from the stories are what I just, I from Nancy Reagan, the dare program yet, but I did other stuff. I did LSD. I did, you know, pot, other shit. I just thought it was nasty. I just knew it was synthetic, you know? Yeah. I didn't know how it was made. That's what scared me about math. It's like just some dude in a basement or whatever about mushrooms. Yeah. Well that's, yeah. You know,

Speaker 11:         01:48:37       the material for the first time, like three years ago, really as an adult, I've never done it before. I wish I would've done it earlier. Yeah, it's hard. [inaudible] earlier, they don't know the drugs because you enjoyed it that much. Yeah. Yeah. I was watching the other watching clothing culture the first time for the first time I'd ever seen him before. And you would do it on mushrooms. Yeah. I loved it. It was awesome, man. It went numb when he's building that mountain out of play with my kneecap.

Speaker 3:          01:49:08       No. Um, we've had this ongoing debate going on here about ride or die for God's sake. This one, the weigh in on it. Yeah. Well, here's my scenario. Even married before. Let's start there and married now know you, man. Okay. So, yeah. Okay. There you go through and you've got children, so you're, you've got, yeah. Yeah. You're fully an adult. Okay. Perfectly. He's a grown ass man. Go ahead. So am I asking him if he's going to tell no, but just whatever.

Speaker 11:         01:49:34       All right, let's say ask him if he thinks I'm right or wrong, but what his life would, yeah, it's a good idea. How about that? Well, I'll say this. Let's say, um,

Speaker 1:          01:49:46       tomorrow you're hanging out at the house. Your wife has some things to take care of. She comes back home and she goes, what's up babe? And you're like, ah, I gotta tell you something while you were out today, um, Amazon [inaudible] dropped off a package and you know, the, the box was all torn open and uh, it was all broken, so I ended up killing the driver. Um, so anyway, he's in the trunk of my car. I just need to go like, handle this. Now do you think your wife calls the authorities on you or does she help you hide the body?

Speaker 12:         01:50:28       Super. Call the authorities really damn oh two. And what it would put out to kill it too. You'd have to kill her too. Well, why is that? Philippe? Walk us through the logic. Go ahead. Yeah. Tell us why you think she would tell it. Turn you in. Because of the murder, man. You know what have you killed her?

Speaker 10:         01:50:48       Ooh, that's what I've been saying. That's magic. Because if he's going to turn on the Amazon delivery guy for nothing, he's going to turn on me. He didn't turn on the Amazon delivery guy for nothing. The package was torn open and got it. Everything was broken. So he's going to say it, but now you think he's going to get me next and my kids, I got to protect the children.

Speaker 12:         01:51:05       Yeah. Yeah, man. Look at that. You don't know what's going to happen next.

Speaker 10:         01:51:10       Oh, all our time was two of them. Yeah. Yeah. And what did you learn

Speaker 12:         01:51:19       man, when you were up a carpet? He's got a bird. The floor.

Speaker 2:          01:51:23       Yeah.

Speaker 12:         01:51:26       Have a buddy. The carpet isn't a burden of the Lord man. Fibers behind. Yeah. Little hairs. Especially the project has curly hair. They were still unfortunately curly hair.

Speaker 10:         01:51:37       That is the quote quote of his show is never kill a person with curly hair. Uh, this says that Diaz

Speaker 1:          01:51:49       his ride or die. Let's see what this is in a file, Joey. Yeah,

Speaker 12:         01:51:53       this is rather die.

Speaker 2:          01:51:57       I love you motherfuckers. All right. Have a phenomenal day. Don't let nobody fuck with you and it's your world, these motherfuckers and visiting. All right. If you don't want to eat, you don't eat it. Don't do it. Just because, well, my baggy. Fuck. Fuck them. Fuck them and get rid of them. You got to get good people in your fucking solid fucking savage. Don't give a fuck. If you stab that mother fucker at three in the morning and you call them, they say, fuck it. I'm going down to the belly out and I'm going to stab him again. Those were the fucking people you want. If you don't have those people, they just fucking acquaintances. You know what I'm saying? I love you. Stay black. Boy, that didn't come up McCullough. Bingo. Bingo. Bingo. I love you motherfuckers.

Speaker 12:         01:52:44       How much do you love Joey Diaz is the best, but I'm gladly, but he sides with me. You're the first guest we've had. So I don't know that flip his sides with you. He does, but Phillipa has said that he thinks his wife would side with you. Well, well, but, but he said that he has, she has to turn. Oh yeah. But he's always, he's going to fucking kill her next hit when she doesn't know that. Yeah. He said I got to kill her too. I think she wouldn't have turned me in or getting me at a two hour to get away. At least that's the nice thing. Now here's the thing that's a ride or die move. Totally right. I would give you a two hour head start. And that's what writer guy, sorry, tire up. Wait a minute. Don't get my yes. I wouldn't say what'll cause that'd be kidnapping right there.

Speaker 12:         01:53:28       But you're already a murderer in. So now let's flip the scenario. You get home, you're like, hey, I got some pastries. And she's like, I got to tell you something really bad while you were out. Uh, I kill the air conditioning guy. Do you, uh, do you call the authorities on her? It's your wife who's going to take care of the kids all around. I'm asking how was that for the air conditioning guy is she goes, I stuffed his body in the closet, so are you going to help me get rid of this or what?

Speaker 12:         01:54:02       Nah, man, no, let me make an accomplice. Right. Wow. So He's thinking he really is realistic. Turnberry. Really? I like it. He's actually putting thought into it. Yeah. Being very grounded. Is that what we call it? Calling the Popo or why? I was like, oh no, we'll call it lawyer first and sort of what to high. What's we'll do. Oh, get to the heads. Oh, smart. Then call the cops. Then I called the cop cop that I know on Facebook and then I'm asking what would you do? We just give them a hypothetical. Imagine if your wife just have a funny question for Fred here. What would you do? He'd be like, Philippe, what are you asking me this for? I Dunno. I'm just curious. No, I liked the way he thinks. Lawyer up. Number one call a lawyer. That's actually the smartest one we've heard.

Speaker 12:         01:54:50       Yeah, I might do that first and then give you a two hour. I think that's a problem at all. You're right at the lawyer where he wants to do. I say, you know, we know where to go out there and go eat what you want to eat. Right. To solve it in an hour. Right. Yeah. He probably wouldn't tell you to go get that last meal. I never thought of that part. Yeah. The food ain't too good in prison. A real like a tried through and through lawyer with experience would be like get laid. Yeah. Get laid, get paid, get. Yeah, get something to eat and uh, we'll go, we'll go after that. It's kind of stuff I was going like that if I was gone like that, even though I'm Vegan now. Yeah. I will fucking just eat like three fucking big males. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         01:55:32       Are you Vegan? Really? Yeah. No Shit. How long have you been Vegan? So like 2012. That's how long ago was this a were you prompted by your wife? No, I was, I was, I'm doing the Atkins Diet and I was just eating cheese and meat, but it, those shit over the Gig or no water. He'll just soda cheese and meat that I was constipated because they, the shit sure. Went to the mosque class and they're like, fuck a rip. I will play a lot of shit lab blood really owe to the people. I felt like I was raped by a goes. So you're saying that the Adkins Diet, you couldn't take a shit so then yeah. You were like, I should probably go to Bama. I will do the vegetables now, so I want to be in a, um, I started eating just of bishop shoppers with no more meat. Yeah. Yeah, man. Yeah. I guess which door to our Vegan. Wow. Well, good for you now. You feel better now? I feel better. Yeah, you got it. Like nothing but Greens in you. It's great. How are those dumps now? Stick you. Yeah, but easier. Easier. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:56:39       That's good. Um, so somebody messaged us the, they said, I've been reflecting about your studies of gender transitions. I was especially intrigued a couple episodes ago when Ari was a guest. Christina asked who would make the prettier woman between Ari and Tom. And then again on the episode with, uh, Christine Hazel Decker, when Christina wondered if town would make a beautiful woman after transitioning attached as a graphic I created that help you better visualize what the transitions of some of your favorite comedy pals might look like. Okay. Definitely some handsome ladies in this bunch. Uh, enjoy. Thanks for making me laugh. Genes, Chloe. All right. Here's what Chloe made up here. Oh my God.

Speaker 12:         01:57:17       Oh, whoa. There you aren't Tommy. I looked like such a slut with no facial hair though. I know your eyebrows are not on fleek. I mean, Ari does. He does. Joey, Joey's aerify, Frito Flintstone. Burt looks just like a fat southern lady, right? He looks like the, um, the ghost whisperer or wait, no, the second theme. Yeah. Yeah. I was kind of something. Yeah. Let's also kind of like the, what's the fat racist holiday holiday kind of that race a chef. Yeah. I could see him being like, I gotta tell y'all something really medium. Yeah. Medium. That's right. Um, and then Joe. Oh, Joe kind of looks like a slot. Who's been through some shit, right? Yeah. She definitely only knows to blow you on a first date. That's what she said. That's her compromised. Yeah. She's like, I had a good time. I blew him.

Speaker 12:         01:58:10       You. I also think it has to do with the highlights. They made her look sluttier. Yeah. Your makeup. All your makeup's terrible. Ari is like made to be a woman. Yeah. He looks way better than you guys. Joey actually looks like some Cuban women. I've seen it and has heard that lady that a booklet party show called how many soda you drink? That was soda to drag already a man. You look terrible. I look like I've been through some shit, I think Bible where people, yeah, let's rank them on the ugliest Joey. I'm sorry Joey. I love you, but not a good woman. He's number one. I'm the ugliest. Then probably now I'm going to go to birds. Terrible. Yeah. I think because of the fillings. You know what this looks like to skin tones. You know what this woman looks like to me? The, the Burt woman, like a really sad woman who puts out a positive vibe.

Speaker 12:         01:59:07       Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. More like GCF for the manager everywhere she goes. Definitely. Yeah. She like she asked for the manager, which is also like, I just feel like she's like, oh, y'all, uh, how, how are things with you all doing right now? And then you find out who filed for bankruptcy. The inside is chaos. It's all, it's all fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and I are pretty tight. Pretty. You're number one for the ugliest, ugliest, first place. Joe Eds. Okay. Second place. Bert Kreischer. Yeah. Burnt Chrysler. Sorry, Tommy. I'm going to give you third place for the ugliest welcome for us Joe Rogan. And then the prettiest is Ari. So Ari was right. She's the prettiest, prettiest transitioned woman. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You feel like it? Yeah, go ahead. Would you rank them for leaping ahead? Exactly like that? Yeah. Tommy, what do you think? Yeah, I mean I will go like, I will go wah, like prettiest one, two, three, four, five. Who is the other one is here. One is Ari to his top three. Yeah. Three store Forzberg five five, five. Yeah. That's the order. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Joey's looks amazing.

Speaker 12:         02:00:23       Yeah. Some Shit, Huh? Yeah, she was, she was rode hard, you know, in her, in her younger days, messy. You are kind of like a girl, but I also looked at it a little bit like a burn victim because they had to like pencil off my beard. Makeup's not great for any of you guys. Yeah. But they are able to find a hairless photos of the other guy. You look like no bullshit though. You know what I mean? You're kind of a means. I've been hurt. I've been hurt. Yeah. This woman's been hurt a lot and you know what? I'm not, I'm not going to get hurt again. You're in law school too, you know, fucking shows. Oh yeah. Yeah. I learned to read as an adult. Yeah. I'm teaching myself the law. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're no nonsense. You're a single mom, so, oh, this is total single. You're single mom. Yeah. Yeah. Ari is just that college slut. I'm like, don't you feel like he, this is a women's studies he gets, he gets muddied by the whole seven cruise up. Yeah. The whole crew's there, but on the download. Oh yeah. But he's a fan. Yes. He's in feminine style or women's Studies. Yeah. Everything's okay.

Speaker 13:         02:01:30       I'm not going to his dorm or holes, bounce of that ass all over our floor. Nick new tico modest in the seventh floor. Seven train. All of them. You so don't bring on

Speaker 12:         02:01:40       lasers. We're gonna run a seven man train up all in you. All up in you. Yeah. Jeez. You ever heard of that damn seven floor crew? He sees some shit. I seen some shit. Some Shit, man. Yeah. I went to a swingers bar and um, Phoenix. Oh, I didn't know they had that many, that many. I feel like Arizona is a lot of swinging a lot of shit out there if he makes man. Yeah. Florida clovers shit. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:02:05       Uh, the PR, one of the, a friend of mine told me that he was hanging out at a club one I comedy club and place shut down. So it was just like a green room hang out and an orgy busted off. No. Wow. Yeah,

Speaker 12:         02:02:17       the happened or that happened when the orgy, but people get a lap dance after the comedy show at some place. Some show. I didn't think Scottsdale Low Scottsdale here in la somewhere. Oh here. My promoter.

Speaker 1:          02:02:28       Hmm. And it just kind of went from there a little while to get our lab lap dances. We haven't even got paid. I left a show one time and Ontario and the next day that the guys were like, why'd you leave last night man? She got really crazy to hear that. And I suppose I'm saying that Shit. No, it was, the staff was like, yeah, I got, we had to forcibly ask people to leave because they were doing some not so legal things in our green room. I was like, Oh shit. Couple of our friends were there. Wow. Okay. People we know like not going to say anymore on that. I think I should probably not. It was a long time ago. I'll tell you off

Speaker 12:         02:03:06       Florida is fucking weird. I've been Hartford, you know. Hey, there's a hot tub back at our house like by the owner and his wife. If you want to join us in the hot tub. A lot of swingers in Florida. A lot of swingers. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:03:17       Hot Tub is always the move. That's how you get people to fuck thankful for, for people that want to fuck more as I got hot tub. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         02:03:24       It's that by like, oh, doing a show. And that's the city by sure. There'll be a lady with three. Terry's their prosthetic, I guess. Yeah, but she just put a fake TV. Why? But they'll tell you what she's going to, she might go to the show. She didn't go to the show. Whatever. I got to see her

Speaker 1:          02:03:45       like in what movie was that? Total recall exactly that. That, yeah, but the third teddy damn. Unreal. Unreal man. Be Great for breastfeeding. I know. Right? Um, and then you also, by the way, I didn't want to forget this. You're one of the few guys I would feel like, I feel like there was like, I'm probably underscoring it, but you did last comic. Yeah. And I dunno, I feel like there's probably five or six people that that show was actually designed for. In other words, good comic gets great exposure and then capitalize on it. And you're one of those like five or 6:00 PM because a lot of people in the like, you know, in the execution of the show you realize you're like, oh, they weren't ready for this show. Yeah, they were just on the show. But it, but it had 30 minutes. Yeah. But you're one of the people was able to

Speaker 11:         02:04:38       make, was that a fun thing to do? Yeah, I thought it was fine. Like a lot of the top five comedians, they already been the real headline before there had been a Letterman, they'd been on stuff that didn't have it. They even had what, six, seven and who like who was in like your final few? And my final one was Roy was jr, he's a very funny Mike Kaplan. Yeah. I know my homies from Mike Destefano. He, he died rest in peace and um, Tommy John Again. Yeah. Good comics in your final five. But the people that were like at the top 20, top 40, they were also did well like Christian alone. So she got up, she got her show and Tiffany Haddish and no rail and they were all on your episode. Yeah, that's a good lineup. There's some, there's like over the years, I mean it always stood out to me like people who were ready for it.

Speaker 11:         02:05:35       I think Ralph, he was obviously somebody who was perfect for him. Uh, Bowden was really ready for it. Um, uh, you, I didn't realize him. Rod, man, he's ready. He's been doing it forever. Yeah. I can't name him after that. The last winter wasn't even announced on television. Seriously. That's true. Who else do we know of us? We sit in my email was a bunch of claps emojis. It's pretty good. I didn't know like TV so thorough. You know, they check everything, the background check I was going to get into the show because, um, they found out that I had a bench warrant. I didn't go to, I think I failed to appear at court three times. Ooh. So that they're looking for me still. But it wasn't me. I told the cop, I told him private investigator for NBC and the lawyer looks at Man, I got arrested one time and the only person who knows about that as Canada when they go together, then you got to rest in Canada?

Speaker 11:         02:06:38       No, but it all, it only shows I got to the outright. Right, right. That's the only one that it comes up. So it was my brother and my brother committed those crimes, not me. So I have to go find a photo of my brother and then they compared the first one, I lucked up with a person who didn't get locked up. They let me go, no shit. But there was a comedian on a show that I know personally, they cut him out of the photo because they were going to kick him out of the show anyways because of a criminal or something. So when they took the photo, I saw that they grabbed him and put him on the left side and they cut him on a other shit. That's fucked up, huh? So what I want $250,000 back by son's mom filed for child support. Go light material. She be, she be killed. The lab baby mama standing, he followed next day, the next day she got like $140,000 tax on that plus the after like 10% of all that I felt like in that movie with Tina Turner, I just walked by name.

Speaker 11:         02:07:52       So we may have a $250,000 winning prize. Yeah, two kids. And um, that's what I don't understand how like you could all just $25,000 in child support, but um, every month you don't pay, they add another 300 and it keeps adding up and if he's adding what you keep up the two 50 you, you kept like, like a hundred or something. You got ID at 90. It's all good. All right man. Well yeah, but here's the thing though, for you, that wasn't like the, that's what I'm saying. It wasn't like the one off you want and then you're done. You were able to like parlay it and we went on a tour on a 85 city tour and I got paid like extra more than the contestants who did it win. Yeah. And I got paid more than them, so I got 85 serious. It was like an extra chunk of money.

Speaker 11:         02:08:39       That's awesome. But I mean you've also since then, just never stopped working. I never stopped working. I'm very busy. Yeah, it's great. It's awesome. But then my special ed data on showtime, it did well showtime. But then when the people saw it, but then they sold it to a, to Netflix and that did really well. And then you also did an HBO one. Yeah. Yeah. And um, I got to think the Netflix or the new president, he is the guy from, I think Montreal comedy festival. So that guy, when he joined [inaudible] he put my special backup on Netflix. That's awesome. I have, I explored and athletics. So congratulations. I'm working on doing another one, man. I'm going to do a, hopefully I'll do a half hour special and Spanish. Do you performance the Hell No. So when I learned how to speak English at four years old, so he spoke fluent Spanish for four years and now and now I'm not fluent in Spanish so I don't know all the words.

Speaker 11:         02:09:38       Can I ask you this? If you were going to do a half hour special, would you do, um, you, would you work your act out in English and then just translate it? Yeah. That's how you do it. Yeah. I've thought about trying to do a set in Spanish or thinking of doing the set from my old special cause easier, but then now I just want to do it all new. Yeah. But he's going to be tough man because I don't know what, I didn't even know what they like or what's going to be offensive. I think it was, was his, who's Trey Hill? And I just Google the other. I just wrote down my bits and have Google translate it. Oh and you had the uh, yeah. Did you do it? Yeah, I did it. How'd it go? Did it went okay? I got to look at word like Hermaphrodite I'm intimidated by it. I'll be honest. Cause I just feel like it's not the, uh, the language of it, which I definitely

Speaker 1:          02:10:33       would have to, you know, practice. But I always feel, I feel like is the way that I do stand up. So in tune with American culture that, that, you know, like then I'll say it and there'll be like, this is fucking weird bands. It's not about that.

Speaker 3:          02:10:49       Yeah. I mean standup is all about cultural contexts, old knowing the boundaries and knowing it really well. That's why it's such a miracle. Understand that sensibility. Right? Cs a non native English speaker do stand up in America and you're like, how the fuck did you, there's this Japanese girl, um, I ego, I think her name is. Anyway, she does Sam. She's hilarious. Yeah. Is that, do you know, I'm telling you, I go right. Hey, cool. Yeah, she's great. And I'm like, how the fuck are you doing? She's a, came over as an adult, I'm assuming. So, yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:11:21       Then how do you figure out what, what I gotta do it? Are you going to do the I, they asked me, hey, Susan asked me, uh, uh, what's his name? Francisco Ramos. Oh yeah. They've told me that they both do like to all Spanish shows. I got to try it.

Speaker 11:         02:11:35       I did Spanish. I'll put together like a seven minute set once for us by the television show. They went well nice. But it was all my joyful in the first measure. So last set of punch line. Yeah. I don't know what you call [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] per day, Huh?

Speaker 3:          02:11:57       Oh Man. It saves the team but won't have sex with you.

Speaker 11:         02:12:00       I met the woman that I have stayed asleep with bootcamp and he sex, he'll write it tomorrow morning

Speaker 1:          02:12:07       cause you're getting no food. Yeah. I think your style will actually is better for translating. Yes. Because you are very clear cut, set up joke. Right where like I ramble and like my joke might be here in a three minute long thing. You might be able to pull off joke, joke, joke, joke, joke. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         02:12:26       But I want to do the special, like if I get a chance to do this better, I want to do it just for like American and Spanish speakers. Yeah. I don't want to go to Mexico. Dude. Over there. You know I'm to Telemundo style balance, right. I'm getting old Spanish. So if you get a ghetto ghetto Spanish people who barely speaks English like you know like the people that we see all the time. Yeah. Those guys like the people who sell the bootlegs, those guys. Yeah. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:12:53       yeah. Cause there's such a different, the Latin culture, what's a show we watch that's, it's not called Sabado Domingo, but I love it. Come on man. When we were in Florida and Miami, we were in the hotel room. We were sick. Nah, still been Domingo. Which one? I like Domingo. It's on for like six hours. And that guy,

Speaker 11:         02:13:10       yes.

Speaker 1:          02:13:13       Right. See that sense of humor. Like I kind of, I could kind of, it doesn't translate. I forget his name. What's his name? He's been a forever. Yeah, he's German. He's German but raised in Chile and got caught by the way guys worth like $4 million cause yes, I know that show and he's been doing it forever. But he, I'll go on, I'll turn that on and literally feel like I don't understand Spanish. Like he can be too. Half of his, why? Why is that? Because of his accent. His references is also like, like what he's like, where is it? Show films, where is their building? Miami I think, but he's to lay in. But it's like, it's so ingrained in like, you know, in the now of what's funny and also, you know, you can joke with expressions and terms that it's, it's that are kind of on the out outlying, you know, border of, of the lexicon.

Speaker 1:          02:14:14       Right? So if you start saying like, even something like, you know what I'm saying, you know that that's, that's not how you would learn English, but that's how people speak English. So he's doing the equivalent in Spanish and like making reference to, uh, you know, maybe a, a soccer star, his wife that everybody knows in Mexico and like a politician. It's specific. Yeah. Is references you don't get. And it's also phrases that I'm like completely out of touch with. Right. So, because even the slang varies just like here and in, and in Britain, the English slang varies. And you have to remember in Spanish, the slang varies from country to country. From Mexico, Guatemala to Columbia to Peru and Argentina. All the slang is different things. Yeah. Town to town, man. So I dunno, I, I watched, I've watched that guy for an hour before and picked up on like two jokes of a hundred. I bet. And you know, it's cool that that show is it, they'll do like comedy sketches and then they'll do like a paternity test. Yeah. Yeah. It'll be like super serious. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         02:15:21       Then the next segment, then the glow light, the new glow, like Maria [inaudible], most dual mama, like I'll quiet Medea Mama. And they both are at the moment, 35 years. They'll tell you that she left, her daughter hears Oprah adoption to be wonderful. Her mom was, and then there's little patchy look bar comes up poor as hell. Like the girls like rich, now that we well, okay. That was really good. Okay, man. She, she's, she has to give her her daughter, man. She don't want to be like this. Yeah, yeah. It, it was dusk. Dads would I choose here on television? Funny Man. Yeah. Pour the tears and he's, he's a kid. Gloves where product placement. Yeah, he's a smart thing is for sale in Nashville. I didn't, did you do, have you done that show that I did? Um, yeah, that's worth it. My step. Me, I think it was Joe Diaz, you guys did that show together. Maybe you look at the video, he's talking real fast. If Georgia has forwarding, is piracy. Wow. Deep two top poppy. Yeah, that's a Ito, Papi. That's like him. Say it over and over. He's fast too. Yeah. Well you that you play dude, here's the other thing. They put you aside,

Speaker 1:          02:16:39       pull you aside and they go, Hey, uh, this is a Latino television. Like yeah, no, no shit. Yeah. He's like, so you have to do everything bigger, right? You have to do everything bigger. Which also by the way plays against my instinct for comedy in English, which is to play everything smaller. Right. And you let the small stand out. Right? So it's like saying something and you're not showing it, right? Like that's kind of your instinct. So you know, they had did this thing where we played this game and then they pour beer down my pants. Yes. And so when they like they go, the first time I reacted, the guys like react bigger. He's like, Yo, it's for Latinos, like you have to. So, so then I did it like jokey. So they poured down

Speaker 10:         02:17:25       like Hawaii and they were like, that's perfect. Like keep doing it.

Speaker 1:          02:17:31       Or they did a, we did a game where they bring out like a beautiful girl in a, uh, in a zip up in a, like a gold. One piece is zip up and they're like, uh, we're going to put items hidden on her body, inside her zip up and you put your hands on her and you guessed what the item is and they tell you ahead of time, we're going to swap her out and put a guy there. That's the joke is that you think you're touching a girl. But again, they were like, but overplay it, overplay it. So like you put your hand in and I'm like, yeah,

Speaker 11:         02:18:03       oh cool.

Speaker 1:          02:18:06       Deanna, like that stuff. And they were like, so, and then of course when you find out they don't want you to go, it's a guy you have to go like

Speaker 10:         02:18:15       hi.

Speaker 11:         02:18:18       So it was, it was, that's what I learned in Spanish class in high school. Okay. Lasting mark. It was like no one says that shit crazy. That's, it's hard to do all those stuff because you go in and tell you something, I don't do none of this shit. Yeah. And I did one love his show, but a of another show that could test and I was, it was these two, like these two girls, they were actresses who were real pretty. There would a kiss sitting next to me and our heads were sticking out of this little cage. And then I guess dumb stuff on top of us if somebody gets it wrong. So there's the w the pretty one of was both pretty, but they thought she was alive. Expected. She's like makeup Dodd looking all cute. They dump dirt on her fucking dirt, bunch of fertilizer at grass and then they put a bucket of crickets down.

Speaker 11:         02:19:21       Damn right there. The other growth that what the hell she is. They dumped like hot sauce is beginning songs. Chips. They must have been so pissed about the directly. Okay. It can't be that bad for me. Mad the tub like all like teen dirt that we're it. Goggles, fuck this. I don't want to eat none of this shit. I closed my mouth and I looked down and there were like 30 scorpions. Why hasn't even started looking for this bad fuck. I'll do it for 300 bucks though. So a real fucking scorpions and I don't even know like a Scorpion will have their own agenda, you know? Yeah. Cause they said fuck for Lipez eyes this night that this book is Cobra was talking Shit to me. Left bucket bucket toward students. They go free these fucking like they would add each other bad like it was like a prison. Inmates getting let out of the hole is the only chance to fight hold. So those go, it went out and they left me alone. Oh my God. You thought is screaming like you did. I went big Bro. Ah, they love it. It has been one of my mouth. You Scorpions crazy, I guess are the ones you eat. I guess. I don't know what fucking show is is again, that's the Neato TV

Speaker 1:          02:20:41       10. That's brutal though. Yeah. I didn't realize I got that wrong.

Speaker 11:         02:20:45       They're the blindfold you and they slap you with a Burrito. Is it again? What, what type it is? I saw that. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:20:52       but that seems funnier. Like lighthearted. Yeah. Not Putting Scorpions on poor guys. Hey, crickets crisis. We get, he saw that. Sue them for something like that. It's pretty crazy money to sign something before you did that shit.

Speaker 11:         02:21:05       No, that was coming, ma'am. Liberte asking me back and go listen man, because I don't want to get slapped by loaf parish. I, it would've put out, I don't want to put my face in the quarry of foot of lobsters. No Way, man. And they're like, [inaudible] it up. You're like, I got it. Yeah. I don't want a boy. I don't want to be thrown at me. Unreal. Mosquitoes, mosquitoes, caterpillars.

Speaker 1:          02:21:31       Um, somebody asked here, they said, uh, can Tom point out where this guy went wrong? What should he have done differently? How would Tom go about this? Let me show you what this is. Gene, maybe you have an opinion on this too. Okay. We'll leave a shocking case of a customer behaving badly at a fast food restaurant. New West police are searching for a Sass back to got way out of hand, throwing a drink, allegedly assaulting a customer and damaging retail equipment apparently. Okay. Over a frozen beverage. Is that you Tommy? It doesn't shock me. I have very strict guidelines for my drinks. You know, at coffee shops. This guy, I think when the men in pink is about to lose it, when words are exchanged, fingers are pointed and that glass that just got cleaned, it's about to get really dirty. This September six fast food restaurant assault or the peers should be sparked by a Tim Horton's ice camp. I guess the order was wrong. It was incorrect. Oh, you think

Speaker 10:         02:22:25       you're the only coffee blended drink over the counter. This irate individual begins kicking and yelling, stopping briefly to check his phone before moving off screen to let off even more steam.

Speaker 14:         02:22:37       The reportedly punched and kicked somebody who tried to intervene after he was insulting and degrading the staff.

Speaker 1:          02:22:44       This guy, he's cute. He's got it together. It looks like he's got PCP that works out

Speaker 10:         02:22:49       PCP. Yeah man. Good steroids, eyes, five foot six man wasn't computer printer and gift cards. Go Fly. Police want to id him

Speaker 14:         02:23:03       to us. It's concerning that somebody could become this I rate and this upset over workout

Speaker 1:          02:23:12       over incorrect order. I think it makes a lot of

Speaker 10:         02:23:14       Tim Horton's employees have had to deal with a lot lately in May. A woman desiccated and tossed the mess inside of Langley. Tim Horton's now the newest Smith's g man eventually took off leaving one heck of a mess. You know what they say about the customer? A little lazy and he just told her totally Sinjun Alexandra, CTV news Vancouver. What's that? Lazy that they lady right there doing there now did you be filling it up with food or something? The Lazy like pretty sure that guy probably tired of her lazy ass. There you go. You probably goes into it all the time. They keep fucking that up. Yeah. They have a personal gripe with him and he went to go too far, but I can see it. They don't make lazy employees. Thank you. I tend to agree with you. I mean it's like I've asked for extra ice every time you're going to come from Burger King and you, you, you got your soda like four ice. I hate that shit. Like [inaudible] where he could feel it

Speaker 1:          02:24:09       swishing in there. He could just tell how lazy, what to just grab. Yeah, exactly. He just tapped it. I do that thing where they go like, uh, they're, they're kind of dicks about it. Sometimes when you go, I always ask for extra ice in my car, my ice coffee. So they'll either put five cubes and where I go, hey man, is this extra eyes? And they're like, yeah. I'm like, okay. Or the person goes, oh, you want extra eyes? Okay. And they pack it so full of ice that you can't put a straw in rude. So I have to actually remove some. And they're like, I thought you want an extra ice. I'm like, you know exactly what I'm fucking asking for. I'm asking for two scoops. Size. It's a little extra ice anyways. I could totally see. Got a Tim Horton's. I think they should.

Speaker 1:          02:24:52       They should find that guy to give him whatever the highest award as you give to a citizen. Like hey, thanks for straighten out these people at Tim Horton's. So tell you know like if you're like at a restaurant, he took it out on the waiter was not really his fault because he was going to grab the food from the loser as cook. Right, right, right. So you really can't take it on her weight or, but right here the latest was standing right next to the, the middle or drink or soft, you know this, she is responsible for that drink through,

Speaker 10:         02:25:19       no, I always side with the employees. I've had never do that to

Speaker 11:         02:25:24       an employee. I worked there. I had a new tire man. I take care of that of people. So I used to work at a restaurant and this guy came. Yeah. Adding that the hot dog was under cook overcoat on the cook and then I saw the hot dog cook, actually kicking the hot dog playing soccer with they, with the other cook. What I did, he picked it up and they, they, they put it back on the grill and then, um, it got the little bird and they give it back to the guy and that guy gave him a $5 tip for having an extra burden. But then we'll kick it now other than a floor earlier. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         02:26:00       Never actually witnessed that kind of, you know, revenge.

Speaker 11:         02:26:05       I don't know. I've never done that. I've never done it. I, you know, I've shortchanged people, but I never done that though right there I've kept extra change. Like if I get extra change and like, fuck yeah, dude, that's your problem. That's a wipey not an MP, but those are mistaken. I will tell him to give this guy less money and they're looking at his 20 and that's it. Well, he took it.

Speaker 12:         02:26:27       Um, what are you looking at? I'm trying to find the, uh, I have to pee really bad. Excuse me. I'm trying to find the, Oh, we got to get them out of here soon.

Um, maybe the the night before. Okay. And the, the girl is like painful. I know the girl is like 18, 19 in college and this guy is obviously much older and she wakes up to this video on her phone. This guy sent her this video, the next good morning, Julia. Meet Gel. Just wanted it to say hi. Wish you a great day. Tell you that meeting you yesterday and getting a look at you was probably one of the greatest moments of my life. He's in her house.

Speaker 15:         02:30:50       This guy. Okay,

Speaker 12:         02:30:52       we'll do this. How'd you get a message is hilarious. This guy just met this girl who was like 20 years younger than I am at least. And then it was one of those things where that she probably like, we're going to find out the details, but like met at a bar somehow, probably hour. Everyone was drinking and then he fucking, instead of texting maybe like nice meeting you made a video or like where he like so embarrassed and it goes on and on and he's like, you'll find love

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       you like you never been loved before. You know they'll cherish you. Yeah, I'll make you look good. 90 Day fiance please me. But it's like, it's cringy right? You're like bad. Yeah, it's bad. So anyways, we got this message today. We've been playing this, this video. So a rich Vos. Yeah, that's hilarious. So somebody said that. First of all, congrats on the new baby. My boyfriend and I are longtime listeners. Living in San Diego is listen to your mom's house to the day. Almost spit out the water. I was drinking when you started to play. None other than goatee. Joe's full trato monologue to Julia. If video during which Jude York titties man. That's right. Yeah. That professors his love for his one and only Julia with multiple shots of his many ceiling fans in the background. I've had this exact video saved and favorited in my phone.

Speaker 1:          02:32:11       Oh my God. It was sent to Julia the morning after she and Joe met briefly at a bar when were city naturally upon receiving it, Julia sent the video to everyone she knows, including my best friend who I was living with at the time. I have laughed for hours and hours over this video as it is quite honestly one of the most unreal things I've ever witnessed a grown man do. After knowing someone for less than 24 hours after getting over the excitement that my own world just collided with the world of your mom's house, I knew what I had to do. There is a follow up video. Wow. Surprised after she did not respond to Joe's initial video. He sent another. I have attached to it in this email. He really does seem like a decent guy, but I do believe the followup video was a mistake.

Speaker 1:          02:32:56       His on me and beat me Kelsey. Hey Kelsey, come see me in San Diego. Added a second. Show the blues. This is number 24 here's the real story. Oh Wow. So, okay. Here's the real story of how they, the Good Morning Julia is. Jim requires you to sign your name before going tanning. Joe saw her going to sign in. He then looked at her name when she went to the tanning room on the way out, he followed her out, yelling, Julia, wait. She stopped thinking she may know him. He then started hitting on her and Julie explained she was attempting to get back with her ex show. Then called himself from her phone and the next morning he sent the video. They never dated, never seen each other since. That ain't no Uber story? No. Barstow. How did he get her phone? Yeah, that part does, that part doesn't really add up, so that's what somebody's saying. But anyway, here is the followup video. Oh Christ.

Speaker 16:         02:33:48       Just want to say good morning Julia. I flower. Oh my precious. My soon to be my everything. Have a great day. Love.

Speaker 1:          02:34:04       That's it. That's creepy. As fuck though. I don't like to, I don't like when people do videos when they're driving. It's very dangerous. Very dangerous. That's what stands out to you. It's not good. This guy is going to hit me. Wow.

Speaker 12:         02:34:17       What do you think? Have you ever done a video like that when you were younger? A younger man? No. You never do anything super embarrassing when you're like, so in La stripper on the way to a Bachelor Party and I live my company card or a car that's really are aligned us. No, we are. We're just as damaged if not worst and strippers, man. Damn noon. Oh fuck your heart to make in your arm to me. Let's go full throttle north Bergen. George, let's go full throttle. Full travel. Full sweat. Yeah. He's trying to say throttle throttle. Yeah. Got that full travel cops or you could still, he's talking basically.

Speaker 12:         02:35:32       He's really, he's really crazy. I mean, here's the thing. Every guy knows, every guy has done a mini version of this. In other words, you say that you are embarrassed by, you know, maybe you send a text, maybe it's something in person, but the degree to which he went is, that's the part that's crazy to go that deep on a video on a video too. So you're like, oh, they can just watch this over and over. That's incriminating. It's like sending your day. It makes me shiver inside to watch. I'm like dammit. Because I feel that humiliation, it's hard for me to watch because I felt that way for people to, you know, I've left a voicemail as a comedian, you're watching the whole thing going is this whole thing is just bombing. It's bombing. Exactly. That's exactly, exactly, yeah. Still doing it. That's the common to be doing the same open 20 years at the Alex Dies House on Saturdays.

Speaker 12:         02:36:32       You not shouldn't do it. And he keeps hitting those videos, but he'll keep sending them. Right. So he gets thrown in jail. I guess probably this is the kind of guy that would re he would actually use our love together. I think he's delusional enough where if she goes, uh, the thing is I just, um, I'm just, I don't want to date you. And he'd be like, he'd be like, you know what? It doesn't matter who you are seeing right now because the love that I have for you, it's unparalleled. And she would be like, no, I just don't want to see you. And he's like, I'll wait for you. That's sad. I want to be says one for every holiday. Merry Christmas. Yo. Full throttle.

Speaker 10:         02:37:17       I, let me tell you, I'm not looking for know how get your body, oh, Christmas as Mother's Day. He could be my mommy. He's so fucked up. I mean, thanksgiving, I've had a few jet. There's, what's his name? Joey. Yeah. I've had a few of these guys in college. This is before the video era. They don't take no for an answer. You have to be so explicit over and over and over. Like you have to be really like Julia. She needs to just say no very loudly. I think these guys ever responded or have a male friend be like, if you fucking do this again, I'm going to break your legs and how you do it. He doesn't love you the way I love you.

Speaker 1:          02:37:58       Oh he's, he's real crazy. He's got, he's got to up. So let me let, let me wrap this up. Uh, go see Philippe this weekend in Houston and Dallas.
