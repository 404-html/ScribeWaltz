It's not that. Okay, so here it is. Um, now we, we feed our video and audio via htmi into this television and then the, the television shoots back the audio into this board. That's how it's working. Um, I'm already preparing for it not to work out. That's about as exciting as the microphone guy, the way you described. I know. Hi, I'm the Evie, my guy that I almost blacked out. You did right. And you explain all that. God Damn you're Schnitzel. I hear. Yeah.

Well then should we just do audio clips today so that we don't have to go through the aggravation of the visual being fucked up? I Dunno. We'll see. We'll see. Let's see if you can

Speaker 3:          00:18:48       You know what's great about you and I really admire the most is that you're so dedicated to this diet. Yeah. And I went to whole farts. So this was so mean to you. Cause I know you're dedicated. You haven't had a sweet treat. I had like Thanksgiving, we all had, I had, I had a couple of pieces of Pumpkin Pie. Right. But that's not, you know, that's not going to break it. That's the only time you've been bad this whole fucking time. You've been so good. And so I thought, I buy you a whole farts chocolate. I got one on the primal diet, it's primal friendly and it's no sugar and it's only has a coconut oil in it. What it tastes like.

Speaker 2:          00:19:26       No you're not, you're not getting into it. So you go, oh, you got to try this chocolate. And I go, I can't, I can't have it. And you go, no, no, no. I, I um, it's, is Paleo and Keto friendly. I checked and I go, you sure? So I was like really trying to be good. Yeah. Go. Yeah. Yeah. You go look, just, just try a little bite.

Speaker 3:          00:19:44       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:19:45       And I put it in my mouth and I actually thought you put a piece of dog food in my mouth. It was the most fucking disgusting thing I've ever had. And you were thrilled. Well, cause I actually shoot and then I, I not only did I spit it out, I spent time just,

Speaker 3:          00:20:04       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:20:04       Spitting and washing out my mouth for a couple of minutes because it was so disgusting. It tasted like something you would

Speaker 3:          00:20:10       bake with. Yeah. It's like baking chocolate or something, you know, in the Ra. It's like when they said no sugar, they met no fucking sugar. It just tasted like a hunk of dirt out of the earth. Yeah. It was really, shit was so damn nasty and I was so excited to have a treat on my fucking diet too. And that primal thing. Did she tell you about this or you just happened to stumble bum? No, it's on the list of things I can have. Yeah, and so I thought, oh, this will be exciting. I'm a primal chocolate or whatever, and it just tasted like such shit. Yeah. That's the thing. When you're on a diet, it's like not even worth it. You're like, yeah, fuck it. I want to, I just don't eat because I'm so miserable. But the idea of eating, eating so depressing now that I'm like,

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       once you get really, really into your diet, then what happens is, I dunno, you're almost, don't you? You look forward to saying no to things. You know what I mean? You look forward to not indulging in things. You're like, well, it'll be exciting to not enjoy things today. That's how it feels when you break the rules. You just know that you're fucking yourself setting yourself back. Yeah. So you're like, oh man, it's going to be so good to not enjoy stuff today. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hear. Yeah, true man. Um, I'm glad you liked that chocolate. I'm going to get more for you. So obviously you remember the biggest nerd ever. I got to show you this glass and guy. Uh, no, this is fine.

Speaker 7:          00:21:24       Point of order. Yeah, Dude. Fuck her for a signature golf Europe, my friend and her speech. But I heard her to say a word that I know is distinctly on parliamentary and I think she may want to withdraw it. The word was f a r t

Speaker 2:          00:21:40       nerd. Yeah. Big fucking nerd down nerd. So her name, her name is Elizabeth May and I guess, and, uh, some of the Canadian circles and you know, politics.

She didn't even realize they weren't having, cause this is obviously like some type of gala, so kind of nerd event. Yeah. But I mean, she's wearing pearls and know people are, it's black times saying, you know, oh, she got her gown.

Speaker 7:          00:23:50       I'm the oldest one. I think you know this, but I'm also the only leader with artificial parts. You do know this? I don't mean my boobs. I mean my hips. Oh my God. My hips are both artificial. Right side has a consumer malfunction park. The security guards [inaudible] you can tell them I squeak. I walked through the floors to parliament and the guards have told me it matter may you can not sneak up on anyone because this is a part they don't use anymore because it squeaks.

Speaker 3:          00:24:22       I thought she was about to say your pussy squeaks. Oh, I like that.

Speaker 7:          00:24:25       It goes some days like a chirping grasp popper. God, the grass plays like a really bad squeaky screen door. I'm not kidding you. Some of you know this is true.

Speaker 3:          00:24:40       I love it,

Speaker 7:          00:24:46       but the thing is I'm the only woman party leader and I know what men immediately sank because the poor boys, they really bought into fried that whole sexual maturation thing on the Friday and scale and we go from the oral. I'm not going to eat the mic into my God, the anal got it. I want to think about it or the genital.

Speaker 7:          00:25:33       right? Honorable member for us. If offended by Fart, you're rough. My friend in her speech, but I heard her to say a word that I know is distinctly on parliamentary and I think she may want to withdraw it. The word was f a r t thing is I'm the only woman party leader. And I know what men immediately think because the poor boys, they really bought into Freud. That whole sexual maturation thing on the guys get stuck on this Friday and stuff. So they immediately soon that I'm envious of the things that boys have that I don't have. They assumed that I suffer from classical Friday and dip bait envy. But I know logger praise the Lord free at last.

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       And so when someone else does an in parliament maybe that upset her. I want to say f a r t and then she, you know chastises the other does not. Interesting. T F a r t

Speaker 7:          00:26:56       lately deranged and not, there is no sequitur. This is a non sequitur. Ever wake up with old theme songs from former black and white TV shows that you never thought your kids would ever see and they're running through your head like every now and then I wake up, they got hydrate. Lisa. I don't thinking about horses. A horse of course. Of course. This morning I wake up thinking this,

Speaker 4:          00:27:53       they're trying to walk her off. Dan is embarrassing. Yeah. Wow. Well, well isn't this interesting? The one who's a tattle tale, a little tattletale has the most shit going on. That's always how it is. Shit. Face it ladies. There's also, if she was cool, like if may was like, oh, people like her and cool, this lady would come on and be laughing with her instead. She's like, get off the fuck off. Yeah. Just like Ted Haggard and all of these people that were here, the gaze. Yup. They've always got some secret thing going on. Of course. So repressed this poor woman. Wow.

Speaker 7:          00:28:31       Welcome back Kotter. Which spells k h a d welcome.

Speaker 4:          00:28:39       They're drag. She's being okay if you're not watching, this lady is forcibly removing her from the stage. Like it's, you know, when like someone's done something it cringeworthy. That's the way it's being. It's embarrassing. I wish I knew more about her. If I was more into Canadian politics, I would know exactly Katie. I mean we have good politicians, interesting ones, interesting ones, interesting ones. But the Canadians, I think I'm much more interesting. Remember the mayor of Toronto? What was his name? Oh, Rob Ford. Is he dead? He's dead. He was interesting. Interesting is a spin on maybe rob Ford. I don't know. I wasn't with May. Interesting prime minister too though. I think he's a cool dude. I mean he looks like you might want to start training with him. Have you seen that bod? He's regular bodied. No, he's not. What is e Trudeau? Let's look at him.

Speaker 4:          00:29:37       Oh, hey. You can look at them all night. You're going to probably put them on your phone and look at them when you're in the, he's got more class in my whole fucking cabinet. Thank you. Wow. An effing again, I think again. And look how unamused this lady is here. Let me pull them up for you. Don't look on your phone. I'll pull it up. Please do. I'm trying to tell you, man. Wow. This is like the Canadian Kennedy of course. I super cute. I thought you knew this. Like the Ryan Gosling of a prime ministers. This one. You didn't know this about him. I listened to MPR. So I hear about Trudeau, but I don't see judo. Let's see if there's a, Americans are very self obsessed. We don't actually show anyone else's leaders. Well, here's him. Here's him, just glass and look.

Speaker 4:          00:30:26       He's doing. Yeah, look at this yoga pose. Here he is. Just glassing. Yeah. Holy Moly. Look at him. Jesus. He's doing like a, what'd you call it? Like you suspending himself in the air with like an underneath. So Yoga pose. I guess they're calling it, but like a Cobra. That's raised fun. It was like, Yo man, this guy's like staying. Yeah. Let's see. I typed in, let's see if you can see. Want to see this bod? Look at this bod. Geez. Huh? He's got an, Obama has got a bad like that. Oh, I would say Trudeau's got one up on the more reps. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Damn. Look at his family. They're all fucking cute and a good looking family man. I'd like to see him make another baby with her. I'd like to watch right from the, from the corner and then just go. We leave VVV. Alright. Say Madam. There's diamonds on the Kravis Tub. You Pussy.

Speaker 4:          00:31:32       Look how look have said this lady is the lady that escorted Elizabeth May offstage did it the way did it like if you were at a wedding and somebody gave a an insulting drunk toast and you were just like, I'm so sorry. So that's my aunt. Did this happen before or after the f a r t incident? I wonder. That's a great question. Cause I mean then you, she's really casting stones. Fart stones fart hard fart stones. Unreal man. Unreal. Unbelievable care. Do you care? These new ergonomic chairs? Yeah, I tried years when I was recording this deep bro. And this one feels much better. At the same, I must have been sitting wrong. And now I'm one I did share, I'm changing the lift on mine. You can change the words if you want to lift how high and low it goes online to go lower. Okay. It's a little too high up. Oh, interesting. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:32:39       yeah, there's uh, there's all kinds of good stuff to show you. A, you liked the pussy tickling and did not really like it were a fan of that. And now I have a lady who is very upset. Oh, I should tell you this first. This was great about, um, about breastbone beach this week. So one of my good friends, Steve came and he's one of my best friends. We were best friends in high school and you know, we've remained friends all these years. It's crazy to think about. Right. I've been friends with this guy since I was 14 years old. 14 years old. Yeah. So that's a long time. And that's when he knew you when you were at a compulsive masturbator yeah. 20 plus yards balance. I know. It's nuts to think about that now. Yeah. So whenever I'm close, he tries to come to a show.

Speaker 2:          00:33:29       So he comes to this show and you know, you're old friends or really give it to you real. So like, you know, I remember like a few years ago, he would come to a show and be like, that's why, you know, it was pretty funny. Um, are you going to do a sitcom or what? I don't know, man. He was like, man, whatever. I'm still a fan I guess. But you know, you're still impressed by you. Yeah. Yeah. And then you know, every little achievement you have, he's like, well, like kind of check off a box for himself to you. Yeah. So this time he's like, wow, man, there's a lot of people here to see you. And I go, yeah. He goes, I mean, is it, this is different, right? And I go, what's good? You know, there's a couple things going, it's good. People are at the show.

Speaker 2:          00:34:12       And he's like, yeah, all right, that's good. And then he loves the VIP treatment. So he's like tests like free alcohol. Oh my God. It's his favorite thing. It's so funny. Like he's just like, hey man, tell him I'm here and uh, tell him to keep the drinks come. And I go, okay. So I tell the staff, hey, take care of them and I'll take care of you. And, and then, you know, he just kind of like indulges and he's like, let me get two steaks, like shit like that. So that's really exciting to get free French fries. Yeah. Yeah. It is free. Is Free is just amazing. Mozzarella sticks, like my parents entered with me and I think they're most like, the part they were impressed with the most when they came to a show was they were like, we got escorted in. They were like, they were like, that was cooler than the show.

Speaker 2:          00:34:55       And by the way, being a comedian and those are the only parks free green room, free food in the green room, which is like everything fried free booze, free booze. If you're a bird, that's like a lot of money. Thousands of dollars. It really is. Uh, but, but those are the only parks. And then the, they let you in on the back end, which is usually in the alleyway next to the dumpster, always next to garbage. So you smell it, you smell garbage as you walk into the club. I mean, I don't know. People do that. They pull you up in like a nice town car if you're lucky that week. And then they let you out right by the dumpster showbiz guys. And it'll be like, they're like, oh, this is actually where we just, we'd collect garbage here. This isn't even actually to throw away.

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       We just keep it here. It smells so bad. So I walked by the, yeah, the vomit pile with them. They watch the show, they hung out, they left. So Steve comes in and he's like, you know, we're just hanging out in the green room. Glassine just hanging. And uh, then it's time. It's like, what do you want to do? And I, you know, he came down to see me. I go, well, next door is a bar that the club owns so they have more pull there because they own it, right? It's called copper blues. So they go, we have a table for you next door if you, if you want to go and just blown what VIP you have a table. But they also send security with, so nobody harasses you. And he's like, are you feeling, are you feeling, are you fucking crazy? It's just fucking for real.

Speaker 2:          00:36:32       And I go, yeah, but you know, it's just like, it's there, it's their place. So it's not like they're not sending security with me to another venue. It's the same. Yeah. It's like a security guard at the club, which is what they do when you have meet and greets or something like that. So anyways, we go next door and he's like, he's like, this is fucking cool. Like, this is fucking cool, man. You got security, you know people are at your show like this is cool man. You, you're doing it, you're doing it. Who? Okay, thanks man. And then I pull up my phone and he's like, how many people are following you on social media? And I go, well, you know, there's different ones on different platforms. Instagram, Facebook. He goes, you don't like Facebook? I got, I, I'm not really into Facebook. I prefer Instagram and Twitter.

Speaker 2:          00:37:20       And he's like, I like Facebook. And he goes, oh, oh, I got it. Put a picture of me on Facebook and tag me. Ah, Shit, you want me to do that? And he goes, yeah, I go here, I'll do this for you. So I pull up, let me pull it up for you. I, um, I go, yeah man, this is going to be really cool. I'll show you what is it. If you really want to have a good day, post a picture of yourself on social media, especially on the Comedians, if you're any sort of, if you're in entertainment or whatever, you want to feel validated by strangers. Definitely post a pic of yourself. I pick, I take a picture of us and I said Yo, and I tagged him cause he asked me to tag them. If you want to feel, I just wrote, if you want to feel good about yourself, check out the comments in those picture of us.

Speaker 2:          00:38:10       It has been commented on how many times here? 144 so it's reached 36,000 people. Um, how's he doing? Is he getting a lot of love is just one of those porns where you fuck your ugly real estate agent because you have shitty credit. Um, it sounds about right. It says that he's a real estate agent, so it's, and it says, uh, I hope you're better at selling houses in your choosing. Barber Barber is you fucking slobs. Um, it looks like a mediocre real estate agent with a crack addiction. One. I slightly art. Uh, let me see. It's all positive, right? I don't know what's going on here. It looks like some guy went to Tom show, they took a selfie and Tom posted the photo. He remember the dude's name. What is going on? Um, Tom, you're not that fat. I hope that guy dies in front of his family.

Speaker 2:          00:39:04       Jesus. Relax. Let's see the two of you together. Probably way less than one fart. Chrysler does truth. That's true. Uh, I just had a bunch of gay guys react to this picture. We ran out of lube. Um, God, that's the one compliment so far. Yeah. Somebody said, I just saw you at the Improv. Apparently the camera doesn't add 10 pounds. Jesus, you're fat. Oh, nice. Anyways, it is. Um, it's a lot of that, you know, so it's, and it's, it's, they're all, there's not a nice one in here. They're all, you know, no, you look Tom to discuss, screw you over. And some real estate will amaze whatever. So he texts me, please take that photo down. I cannot handle the comments. And I was like, nope. I said exactly what you asked for. Welcome in the spotlight. Yeah. So you asked for this. So I'm giving it to you. It's neat. Um, anyways, pretty cool. Just wanted to tell you about that. And another cool thing that happened. Jeans. You know how I meet black celebrities a lot. I met method man. I know I dated him in the 90s. You did not. And he had a show called method and red pets. Right, right, right. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:40:23       Absolutely. 100% is what then is dangerous your neck. There you go. Um, my mom's a big fan so I'm in Fort Lauderdale airport cause that's where I flew it cause it's direct on this six something flight. I mean it's fucking early. Right. And I had two late shows Saturday and walking through security and who do I see to cow Johnny blaze, you know, the iron lung. So I look and I just, I, I've tried to figure out what am I going to do, what am I going to do? We're insecurity. I just kind of leaned forward. I see him and I stick out my hand, my fist like that. And he just gives me, he was like, oh yeah, yeah. And he leans forward and knots and I was like, that's perfect. Yeah. It was like, it was like, it was a, I, you know, I'm a big fan of respect to you, but I didn't even say anything.

Speaker 2:          00:41:15       Just a little fist bump and it's like, feels good. We get on, I get on my flight and uh, he's in my row, but across the aisle, so I'm aisle, he's across the aisle but window. Right. But same row. So I'm like, shit man, it was fucking method man. Dude. Some girl boarded the flight and ask them for a photograph. Oh No. As they're boarding Paul, big foe, the, uh, the fucking lady sitting next to him has to get up so this girl can go sit down. Anyways, the flight's a long ass shitty flight, right? It's Lauderdale, la. When we land, I get out of my seat, he leans in and whispers something to me and I'm like, I'm like, wait, what? And I, and I really want to know what the fuck he just whispered to me. So he gets off and on the jet bridge he waits a second so that I can walk off and I'm like, wait, what'd you say man?

Speaker 2:          00:42:10       And he goes to that motherfucking never shut up and he goes, dude in front of you, man, I felt bad for you guys. Shut the fuck up. The whole flight. He talked to whole flight, he talked to the whole flight. And you know when someone like that says something like when somebody does that, who you think is cool. So what you do, even if you don't know what's going on, you just agree with it like I did. That's exactly what I did when he goes, he goes, you know what I mean? He's like, he's talking to him. I go, dude, some people never shut the fuck up. Like I made it my problem even though I had zero problem with it, cause I never heard the guy. And then when I said that he was like word and I was like, yeah man, you guys would have shut the fuck up.

Speaker 2:          00:42:50       Like I totally exaggerated that. It bothered me and I felt like such, you know, like disingenuousness because I was doing it to make the bond, to bond more with them. Anyways, I ran it and then we walked to the luggage together. I'm fucking friends with mathematics, his phone number and stuff. No, I asked what he was doing shows and he said he's shooting some show TV show with John Singleton. Um, but yeah, man, it's, it's nuts. I have been a fan of his legitimately since 1993 he's pretty big. I've known him as long as I've been. I've been a fan of his, as long as I've been friends with Steve. Wow. So anyways, that's cool. That's very cool. I wish I had more of an interaction with them, you know, but I took what I get. I'll tell you though, I've, I've seen rappers and airports, fist bump.

Speaker 2:          00:43:38       Yeah, perfect exchange. It is with a rapper or an athlete. Just the fist bump because it's like, oh, I get it. You get it. And I was texting friends, obviously I was touching, you know, my, my, my good buddies from college and they're like, you're getting a picture right. And I was like, no dude, you can't ask this guy for like, can I take a picture with you? I mean, I could have, but just his vibe was like, not like let's, you know, like, hey man, put it on selfie mode. It wasn't like he wasn't in that. And plus when you're traveling, if it's early, you don't want that stuff, but you now you have a memory. You don't need a picture, you know? Exactly. Exactly. Kind of know by the way he looks like exactly the way he looked 20 years ago. Wow. Like method man hasn't changed his physique, his face. Isn't it amazing? Yeah. I hope I get like that. Probably not. I mean, I wonder if we like, let's just see a comparison method, man. You think he works out a lot? Uh, yeah, I think so. I think actually he takes care of himself. That dude is like,

Speaker 3:          00:44:43       that's the secret to their lien. Or when I see older people now and I'm like, Oh, you just don't take care of yourself brown. Like it's a fucking, it's voluntary to look like shit mostly. Right. I mean, unless you have some sickness or something. Geez.

Speaker 2:          00:44:58       Yeah. I mean, I'm trying to think if he, uh, this looks like, this looks like probably what, what I saw him as right here, you know? Yeah. I mean, good looking dude. Yeah. The dude doesn't look his age. You know, this is 93 I remember. No, but I mean it doesn't look that different men, it looks better now. Yeah, pretty wild. It looks much better. Well, I think get I shit, I wish I had an edible on me. That would have been the move. Like, oh Yo man, you weren't like, it's like you and me. That's how we hang out. He'd been like, Tom, you don't know me and you don't know my style, man. Yeah, man. I'll get all three stars to cow. I'm not very cool. In the radio station that I managed in college, so that was like the heyday, especially a breakout years of Wu Tang stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:45:53       You know, it was late nineties. So he has so many Aka haze that we wrote in permanent marker on the wall every time an Aka of his came up. So it said method man and there was like a poster. And then in permanent marker on the wall it would say, you know, to cow Johnny blaze hot nick, whatever, iron lung. And it was like, it ended up being like fucking 20 long watch comedians did more of that nicknames. Yeah. Yeah man, that's neat. That's really neat. Jeans. That was pretty cool. [inaudible] posted a photograph of myself on Instagram this morning. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:46:30       Uh, meet Sean and the studio here with the two dogs. Yeah, a week ago. And it's really nice to read the compliments. Like it look like a total mom and yeah. Nice mom shoes nerd. What kind of fucking shoes are those? Sweat pants loser. Like it's, it is nice to hear that kind of stuff, but I'll show you these slippers or actually the fucking coolest thing. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:46:52       You talk about these constantly. So I was, I was in the airport,

Speaker 3:          00:46:58       I don't know, two months ago and I saw this like 50 year old lady on the tram that takes you and she was wearing these just glassine and I'm like, Bro, those look like the coolest shoes, most comfortable shits I've ever seen.

Speaker 2:          00:47:12       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:47:13       And she goes, oh, they're called. Mohave us, this is an English thing and I looked it up and I ordered it immediately. Scores and this is the dope as part of these are house. You can wear these out and about in the world, but I wear them around the house cause we don't have carpet and I, my arches are fucked since I had a kid. But on the inside it's soft and then you can take off the soul, which is cool. It's plastic and you can wash this part. That's the best fucking part. Wash the insides. Cause I hate slippers and they get all sweaty and smelly and then you know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? If I'm on a time out, I know exactly what it is. Yeah, I know exactly what you're saying. Anyway, they're all sponsor the show or anything. But it's great to have like I'm always looking for ultimate comfort shoes. Of course I love vans, but there's no arch support in it. Slip on Van Gogh, like fucking tying shoe laces, man. You've had them now for a few weeks and talk about them constantly. These are the best purchase and it's expensive.

Speaker 2:          00:48:06       It's like a, excuse me 80 but almost throw up $80 or something. But I've had him, I love him. Good. Now we need a slipper for you. Yeah I do. I want to get it cause right now you've got the Ugg slipper with the open back style but you don't like that. Why don't you like about that? I like slip in and out. I liked that. I like being able to just walk in like an Armenian guy. I don't want to have to pull up on the back. Right. But what don't you like about your current? Oh those are just worn. Those just worn cause that it's not that good because it's flat footed too. You need some kind of arch support in there. I like a little warm and I like ease and comfort of getting in and out of a, I'm going to find it for you.

Speaker 2:          00:48:53       I just found some aliases going back to mathematics for just for a moment. Okay. Okay. The ghost rider, Johnny blaze meth. Mr Meth, meth. Mr [inaudible], hot Nichols, hot Nixon, big John Stud. Shaquan got a law to cow, the iron lung metaphysical man to Cali and stallion. John, John McLean, John John blaze, Ini, Johnny Dangerous, uh, the Shaolin Assassin, the blended one. John Blaze Ini, the m e t h o d man that he meister. Okay. I just wanted to remind myself of those. This is college memories. All right, so you guys make your own fucking Aka list and um, will you get me some slippers then?

Speaker 3:          00:49:40       Yeah, I mean I like to, I feel like you, you're wearing some bullshit right now. Right now I'm wearing flip flops because I can't find my slippers. Yeah, man. Here's what I do. I'm going to get you some on Zappos. What you need is a material like soft on the inside and then free.

Speaker 2:          00:49:56       Yeah. In the back. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I need. Okay. I'll get it for you.

Speaker 3:          00:50:02       Good pair of slippers can change your life. It sure can. I'm telling you because I don't like to walk around in socks because my feet fucking hurt. Soccer flag dirty and then I got to take the dogs out to shit and Piss 500 times a day. And I don't want to wear normal shoes around the house cause then they tracks and dirt and everything.

Speaker 2:          00:50:22       By the way, if anybody knows it's listening, why? Um, this htmi makes the, I'm like, why the screen goes blank and then it pops back up.

Remember that story about the girl that went to go bang the Wu Tang clan or had all of them? Oh yeah. Oh, you're down her throat. And by the way, I knew. It's funny you brought that up. Uh, did you ask him about that? Well, I thought you were going to say that and I imagined that like dozens and dozens of comments, we're going to be like, why didn't you bring up that blow bang. Most importantly, yes. Why can I tell you the reality of it? If I would have brought up that to him, he would have been like, wait, which city? Right. Uh, you know how long I've been famous for? Right, right, right. Like world famous have the Wu Tang clan or

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       a him in particular because he's also considered like the good looking one of that group. He's handsome. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. So like he imagine like if I would be like, Hey, do you remember where you got a blow job once on a tour bus? He'd be like, oh, that one time. Yeah. Yeah, I remember that. No, he'd be like, uh, that's like saying like, Hey, remember that time you had tacos for lunch? And he was like, yeah, no, I remember. Who's The guy? The, the sweet baby. Jesus. Big Baby. What was his real old dirty bastard like? Yeah, that guy was in the band too. He's not a looker, the hottest ones method. Oh yeah. Yeah. I mean he's getting all of it. Yeah, you could, you know, you can make, obviously it's subjective, but I think, you know a Kappa Kappa Chino. Yeah. So you're like, why did that happen right there?

Speaker 4:          00:54:12       Why did that just pop the spirits? Yeah. Cop Kappa. Donna's definitely not cuter. Well No, I'm saying that like he's also not even an original nine, so he's going to like trickle down post who's not getting the, which can't be bad. No, if you're hanging out with them all the time. But if like one of them was like, I want to blow method man though he's busy right now, he's got his dick sucked by second aftermath after him, you can fuck blow who's second in line? Well you know, you're, you have like the um, the CEO of it all also carries a lot of weight, a lot of power because he's the architect of everything. No Rizza. So like if you were like woo obsessed, he would actually be the, the real achievement. So let's say I'm going to the Blue Tang clan, right. For a blow bang yet.

Speaker 4:          00:55:03       So the first gentleman I will approach is the pyramid of the hierarchy of rappers in that group and that group here. I think it depends on it. That's what I'm saying. It depends on what, if you're talking about the most powerful male Rizza okay. If there is a well know and that's not necessarily true. I mean some people like, cause I'm a fan of the liquid swords. Oh, I gotcha. I gotcha. Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense. And then a lot of people, you know, a lot of people, hardcore Wu Tang fans or feel like there's just a supremacy, dedication and just, you know, something about Ghostface. I forgot. So he would definitely be aesthetically I'm talking, I'm going aesthetically. I mean, you know, I would say you would probably have TJ's a and method as the top two, probably more traditionally handsome guys. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:56:06       And then I blow method. Okay. And then I blow Reza. You could face killer. Okay. Still got a lot of dicks hanging around. It's kind of waiting to get sucked out. I mean, you got inspected decks just hanging out there. You know, Ray Quan, just like, what about me, man? I'm having some ice cream. I can't get my Dick Sag. Right. Um, you know, a lot of decks, if you go on and you got to go all in, you God, uh, he's suing them right now. There's a, aren't they always suing someone in the Wu Tang or he's in the Wu Tang clan. He's suing the Wu Tang clan. Okay. For royalties. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of guys in that band that there's, I don't know how their band's money. He's got a bad bite. Yeah. But, um, how do you make money in a band with fucking 20,000 dudes?

Speaker 4:          00:56:52       That's a good question. It's gotta be a bad, bad bite. It's a bad bite. It's a bad back, bad, bad, bad bike. Got to Pat Pyke. I Dunno. There's 20. Yeah, there's nine guys. But then there's all these side guys and that's what I'm saying now the, now you know what I heard the guy in the rolling stones is pay to play the drummer. Yeah. Ronnie Wood. Yeah, I heard that. Yeah. What were we talking about? That yeah, we were in thanksgiving. I told you that. Yeah. Which is so interesting to me. Yeah. Because basically royalties question, right? So these pay to play, it's pay to play. Yeah. He gets paid per gig. I mean paid handsomely. Sure, sure. But like rolling stones is only Keith and I'm mic. That's great. Yeah. For those two bros. Yeah. So like they get the writing credits there, that that's them, that's their empire. And they get the residuals. They get all, all that stuff. Yeah. Brilliant. So Ronnie Wood has got to be worth the fucking pouring millions. He's getting paid. Right. But uh, but that's the way to do. I don't know if the Wu Tang structured their deals the same way. I don't know what their deals are. That structure would be all, all in [inaudible] hands. I bet. So he's the owner. So I blow him first for sure. Okay. Yeah. Wow. Interesting. Well, thankfully, only hundreds of thousands of people here this, so maybe your dream will come true.

Speaker 4:          00:58:13       Could you imagine me in the Wu Tang blow? Bang. No. Hey guys. No, cause you're not like that guys. What happened? I would not even know or not. Gosh, goodness gracious. This little little bitty blurb. They really bad for me. Hey guys. Anybody else? A mom. Yeah, they would really like that. It's like your jeans high and tight.

See where that last? I think the game was in Seattle last night. So, so did they name, I don't know what the name of corporate oppressors. I don't know. It is something corporate oppression. It's definitely, there's definitely a score. A score. Starbucks, Kentucky Fried Chicken. Mcdonald's Burger King venue. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:04:49       Peep up. Nightmare bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bloop.

Speaker 4:          01:05:11       oh, century link field. I say. That sounds like, can we mommy, can we go to the century link field? God, what a bummer. Can we go to the Kodak? The Kodak Gallery Auditorium? Uh, so many are named after banks. I know they chase national stadium guys. The Wells Fargo arena. I know we did this fun and I forgot. Okay, here it is. Okay. Kansas City is still awesome. That's Arrowhead stadium. Thank God. The cowboys play at a t and t. The panthers play at Bank of America stadium. God, Seattle is century link. Oh boy. Jacksonville plays at Everbank Washington Redskins play at Fed ex field. Fedex. Cleveland plays at First Energy Stadium. What a bummer. Detroit plays at Ford field, which makes sense.

Speaker 4:          01:06:13       Yeah. Atlanta plays in the Georgia Dome, which is cool. It's still called something normal. New England plays at Gillette Stadium. That's neat. Miami plays at hard rock stadium. Hard cock. Pittsburgh plays at Heinz field. Well that makes sense. That's from Greenbay Lambo, which is the only one of the only traditional ones. San Francisco should be our favorite. They play at Levi's stadium. Those jeans, man, the Levi's companies there too. It's right. Philly plays at Lincoln financial field. Oh boy. That's a bummer. The Lincoln financial fee. Now the rams are playing at Lee Memorial Coliseum, but that'll change when their things done right. Cause there who bought that? Well, no, I don't remember. But they're, they're, you know, they're building a stadium for them. So that's definitely, I wonder who, I forget some horrible fucking, the colts play at Lucas oil stadium. Oh my God. Yeah. There's Mercedes Benz. There's Metlife, new era field, Nissan Stadium.

Speaker 4:          01:07:12       God, what a fun, authentic experience is. The only other school ones are Oakland Alameda Coliseum. Paul Brown is where the bangles play a Raymond James where the a plays and soldier field in Chicago still plays a soldier field. Um, God, yeah, they're, they're terrible names. Absolutely terrible. It's, it's a, it's just shameless. Is nothing just cook named and the Rose Parade? No. Like we have to call it the Citibank Rose Parade. Yeah. They pay so much for naming rights. I mean, it's unbelievable. We're talking nine figures. Oh, I bet. Just to be able to call it because they know. Yeah. And then every week when they go, we are here live at a US bank stadium. Yeah. Yeah. You know what your mom's house needs to by naming rights and auditorium or maybe a public restroom facility. No, I know. We need to, do, we need to sell naming rights to this place that's up to the studio.

Speaker 4:          01:08:09       Yeah. Look and do another episode of your mom's house live from chipotle, the studios, you know. Great idea. Yeah, that'd be really cool. Right? You follow me? A great sponsor. I like to, no, from Armand Hammer Studios, right? Colgate, if we should have a tooth sponsor and all Colgate's he knows, or what does that toilet paper we get? We can do that. Sharman Sharman studios that even has a nice ring to it live from Sharman studios. There's so much toilet paper here, and we say it at the, at the very top. And then they go, yeah, of course. We'll say it. You guys give us $100 million and we'll say it every week. Welcome back to Sherman studios back from a break. It's live from Sherman studios.

Speaker 4:          01:08:56       I might not show. This has nothing to do with, it just reminded me, we happened to catch that show. Uh, outdaughtered PLC about the quintuplets. Yeah. And that the woman that stays home with six kids, five babies, one year old babies and then like five year old daughter. I mean, and she's really got such a better attitude than we do about child rearing. You and I are exhausted at the end of the day with a one year old with one one year old and she's like, well, they're challenging by the way. We had an amazing disposition. They weren't like, we're fucking wreck. Oh my God. Twins would have just put us one of us in the hospital. And they were just like, well these five we feed and eat. And they were like, fine. She's very spirited. Oh boy. You're really, it really makes you feel lazy. I do.

Speaker 4:          01:09:49       I'm like, fuck. I guess when you're in that position though, you're like, this is my reality. You surrender because you can't be like, this sucks. No, no. You have to be like, oh, that's what I do. You can't, if you're five babies deep in the game, you can't even acknowledge that it sucks ever. Cause it's too late. You're all in. You're all in for the rest for the 18 years. Five. So it now imagine if they had our arrangement where I had to get on a plane. And you have live in help live. Yeah, because we have our lovely, wonderful nanny, but she goes home course and also I don't like to have my kid raised entirely by another person. I like to spend a lot of time and you want to take away that pussy too, right? Right. Yep. Did you see our Sassy Sassy nanny shoes today? Yeah, she had real Sassy. She kinda highlight, choose on raw Mustang. It was quite a thing. Do you find girl tickle you? I don't need this drop crevice. Can we play? Finally, I've been dying to play this. The guy who sent in him doing the Starbucks, what is it called? The the challenge called the mommy challenge. The genes coffee challenge and this is how you do it.

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       The way this guy did it is exactly how we do it. Tom and I do this every time you order from Starbucks or from a fast food place, do this. Let me see where it to start. The revolution. What, uh, you forwarded it to me and me, ma'am. Tell you to your, uh, personal, my personal, oh, here we go back. Me and me, me, me, me, Betsy is such a jerk. Last night we gave them both t r e a t s is Huh? And Fif was chewing his chance. His bone. Yeah. And Schnitzel was just hot and just glassing it. Yeah. Remember she was right. Not Scared of him. Not Scared, not scared at all. She should be. So what we did is we told everybody when we got drive throughs, especially, we go to Starbucks a lot, we order our coffee, we always call the person genes and mop and mommy, mommy, we say both, you know.

Speaker 3:          01:12:14       Um, but the way he does it, this guy, he really nailed the right way to do it. Right. Because you're supposed to do it like you're supposed to go kind of, you know, kind of fast. You met, you make it sound like you're saying the right thing. It's almost like you're saying sir or ma'am, right? Yeah. Yeah. Excuse me, sir. Like you do it like and then you make it hard. Yeah. It's all about nonchalant and, and just make it a throwaway. You don't, you don't want to draw too much attention. Right. You wouldn't go like a mom. Me, hello mother. No, no, no, no. Yeah. I want to get, yeah, right. Very chill. All right here. It does a great, let's see. Good work.

Speaker 11:         01:12:51       Hey there. What's coming up for you? Hey Mommy, can I get up 90 ice hazelnut coffee with cream coffee with a grenade bold with a cream and two sugar in the raw figures in the that. Yeah, and I was an MP Para Grandad, grandad. They polled with two sugars in the round to do pay cream. Yes. And anything else? That's all. You're going to have enough nice jeans. Nice jeans.

Speaker 3:          01:13:29       Yeah, that was fantastic. Perfect. It was absolutely fantastic. Thanks gs. That's exactly how we do it. That's exactly how we do it fast. Yeah. What's a bold, bold? He ordered a boy. I have no idea. Is it like a drip coffee flavor? Maybe. Maybe come, I don't know if you know this, but in the summer, who is this a [inaudible] 97 I was a Starbucks employees. Tom, sorry. Tom Is the one who sent that. Thank you Tom. Yeah. Really good work. Great, great work. Um, uh, he goes, hey mommy. That's exactly how many. Yeah. Yeah. Hi Mommy. You know what's really insidious that they started doing through it, our Starbucks drive through is they go, hi, would you like something to eat today? Yeah. And they enter the fee to any

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       person and you're like, a course. I'd like something to eat today, but we're trying not to be fucking fat fucks. Yeah. But there's also this thing, they know that people order drinks at bars, but now they're encouraging food. Right. Cause so they're like, and there are so aggressive. It's recent. Yeah. It's the last few weeks where they'd been like, where you pull up and they know you're going to get a coffee. So they just start, they go get you some food today and you're like, no. They're like, you sure you don't want anything to eat? Come on fatty. And then when you're done and you go, that's it. They go, you sure you don't want any food? And you're like, that fat fucking piece of shit did to me last week. I was there with Lj and the car. And she's like, you shoot, you shoot. Don't want some, you don't want like a cake pop or a pace.

Speaker 4:          01:14:57       And I was like, dude, you're so sneaky. I'm like, no, I'm trying to be good dude. By the way, I just saw on our, on our cheat sheet here, the tickle pussy guy is Orlando Brown. He's the former star of that. So Raven, no, no wonder he's so handsome. And he was arrested in February, 2016 for hitting his girlfriend while park police station and also having a meth on him. And now he's at the full finger ring that he makes videos with the, what is it called? A full finger ring of full finger ring. Yeah. Cause it goes, it tickles pussies with that. So he was on that. So Raven, yeah. He's got those actor. Good luck. That's for sure. Yeah, you notice that.

Speaker 4:          01:15:37       So we have uh, another, uh, a couple other emails. Can we want to get into a couple of other ones? Um, water champions solve that said, Oh boy, I dunno. I don't even know the car. It could be you. I don't know. I don't know what it says. I'm mommies. I was masturbating the Fart porn this evening. She's and began to wonder where's the com, which naturally led me to wonder about the evening, the never ending debate of who the true water champion is in head to head sports that are combat oriented. Traditionally gender weight, stuff like that are considered Christina piece. Clearly the female water champion. Well, Tommy's undisputed male water champion, right? So the female astro is unfortunate from Mami te or is it there is a loophole. Tommy and alias Dj Dad mouth are both openly nonbinary. The fact that they who's Pronoun is currently unknown are openly nonbinary excludes male. Considering the rules of gender fluidity, Tina has the option to become male long enough to simply the killer. They're both feeling me male, female, male and female titles within seconds of each other. This would also make the fluid champ in several respects. Tom does not have this option due to his rigid stance on being nonbinary. Neither gender Tom may have the title of genderless water champ Chatam choose to claim it in order to keep his Brown's violent and his jeans acceptable case close. Sincerely Jesus Christ. Wow. So that's um,

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       yeah, very interesting dissertation on it. So what he's saying is I can claim the title if I claim my gender fluidity. Now hold on. It's what he's saying. I don't know. I mean I've got, I've got an an email update. You, I've got a report on you. Uh, from wet balls, beach from wet balls, beach, Tom Tom's water intake, this, this weekend in wet ball speech. He writes, I am proud to say the champ stayed hydrated his entire set and topped it off by annihilating an entire bottle in one step. It was truly inspiring and I in turn went home and drank an entire gallon and stuff like that. Truly enjoyed the show. I can't wait to hear next time in South Palm Beach. Now I will say Paul to my friends. Cheers. It's the first time you've drank water this entire show. Let the record note that I've been drinking.

Speaker 3:          01:18:03       I've been hydrating this whole fucking time and I have two primaries to be fair though. Nope. This and that. This is my 38th glass of water today. Liar lies. You know, you always say you drink water off camera or you only do it on camera. I know. I just wanted to say that this is the probably the very first positive, uh, Tom Drinking Water report that I've had. Yeah. So it sounds like you're deliberately doing some water out of posturing. You're not even proud. Well, I'm just saying it's about time you stepped it up and pretended that you are the water challenges. Be Proud. I am. That's why I fucking, I'm encouraging you to drink more water. You need to pee clear also. Can I read another one? Sure. Just an interesting thing. Just wanted you guys to know that there is a town in Oregon called Brownsville. Interesting. Now I think, isn't there one also in Tay Hos? Wow. What a neat world.

Speaker 2:          01:19:02       Well, we know where we're going to retire, that's for sure. Speaking of bee holes. Dear Mommy's, in my 34 years of life, I've been doing something we all do every day wrong. Apparently it wasn't until I saw numerous times on the television actors wiping their be whole in the sitting position that I realized I must be the only one. If you didn't guess already I wipe standing up. I don't know why. I don't know why not. When I realized this was a situation I asked my wife, she was astonished and bewildered to the fact that I not only wiped while standing up, but I also thought that everybody in the civilized world also wipe standing. So I tried to do it the normal way and found an incredibly uncomfortable stand up, grab a cheek and spread with one hand and wipe with the other. That's how it's been. And that's how it will be. My ass is clean. Don't judge me. Your thoughts, rob

Speaker 3:          01:19:53       coon unique. What do you think? I'll tell you what I did before the washlet. Well, I would also ask him, are you seven? Cause I think that's how they do it. To Jesus spread and then wipe stand. Can I tell you what I used

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       to do real talk before the washlet three 50 okay. I would do a combination of both. If it was a difficult why now this is before or in lieu of the shit to shower. These are hard to fart on. Hard to Fart on. Hardest. Sit on it doesn't feel good. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:20:21       I know. Sorry. I had to get that out.

Speaker 4:          01:20:32       You know you look like the cars, the cosmic your face was like when the cause what? It will be eating a Hoagie and then Clair would catch him and then he's like, you know, he pretended like he didn't see it. Oh, he's pretending to you. Hear that one or no? Barely heard it. Yeah. I don't think they heard it either. Please continue. I don't know what I'm talking about. Oh, you said that before. The specificity. This is if I don't do shit to shower. Yeah. Before the washlet I would do a combo of both. Meaning I would do at exploratory. Yeah. First going on anyway. What's going on? If there was a lot happening, I would do some sit down wipes and then I went to state and then do more wipe standing. So I would do both.

Speaker 1:          01:21:20       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:21:21       What are you saying? Yeah, I mean, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a mostly sitter. Here's The Times that I've stood to wipe. If I'm having a real itchy ass whole day and I'm, let's say I'm out and I'm, I don't know, I'm in a department store, right? Like Jesus, right. When I go to check, I won't sit down to check. I'll check standing, wait, wait, wait, check the paper. Like you'll get like, I'll be like, I'll be like, my ass is itchy. Right. So what I'll do is I'll go in the bathroom, I'll wet some paper. Yeah. But I'll do a standing wave that's like, yeah, I won't sit for that one. No, because you're not shitting though. Right. But if I'm, I won't stand to Wyatt and this guy's obviously, he's mentally, oh. But yeah, I, I disagree. I've often done a sit and then stand to finish up the cleanup.

Speaker 4:          01:22:08       Yeah. Yeah. That's not that crazy. Oh, he's good. Somebody wrote, you know, we had the, the NFL but whole debate I talked about Josh Potter. Right. He also did um, wet balls, beach with me this weekend. I had great shows. Yeah. We were talking about what position has the cleanest a whole, yeah. Um, this guy writes the cleanest a-holes has to be the center. If they stink, the quarterback will let you and the whole team know because your hands are on. That guy's taint makes you self conscious. Can't wait to see in Atlanta. Thanks Mitch. Um, interesting thought. I mean I myself played center for um, you know many years. Middle School, high school. Oh um, yeah. So you really have an interesting perspective on that. Do your, and he is right. You are, you are more, your butthole is in your head. Sure. Because you're, you lean forward, you're butt's spreads a little bit and, and the quarterback puts his hands under your ass hole and on your toes.

Speaker 4:          01:23:02       Interesting. Yeah. You know what? I've been thinking about my asshole. Cause now I do polities twice a week and I'm like, I really like, I like to shower before and after PyLadies because she's right there. Her nose is so close to everything as I'm sweating and everything. I feel bad for this guy writes long listener with a short response. Be whole debate. I feel like you're missing a major category here. I feel like the worst butthole category goes to the coaches do. That's really funny. Just picture rob and rex, Ryan, Wade Phillips, the list of disastrous old manholes goes on. I want to thank both Eugene's for my, I'm making my variable. Interesting. Tyler. Yup. No, that's there. It read it. Read on the meter. These chairs are not optimal. Farting tears. They're not good forwarding chairs. They're knocking 40 chairs. This chair or this show was made for forwarding, so I kind of don't know what will be an optimal chair for farting. What's that?

Speaker 1:          01:24:05       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:24:05       Uh, elementary school. Plastic chairs. Well, you know what happened, you know, I did it again. I sat on that step stool and I, I spread down and I sat and I farted again. It was crazy sounding. Those are great steps. Steps because first of all, it puts the plastic, but it's also the deep squat. Cause you're, you're, you're squatting down all the way in our, it's an art shit on a child's room. Yeah. Yeah. Isn't that interesting? Yeah. What a neat thought. I haven't a dental update. Do you want to hit the music? Oh yeah. You've got to prepare me for this more. I told you I had one. You didn't tell me that before. I just thought this was interesting. And in lieu of our, okay, we have a lot of contractor, uh, people around. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:24:54       Is it a listener? Dental update? We'd do me a favor. Will you encourage me that night to do my a whitening trays? I've, I've tried for a year. I'm asking you to tell me tonight. I feel like bitsy has whiter teeth than you. I want to do it tonight. Will you encourage me or no? I remember. Okay, so this comes in, uh, Mike writes in, I thought this was pretty fucked up. I'm a construction worker and I was recently working for a contractor who's denim as the lowest and loosest imaginable after asking for the correct tool for several weeks because the one I was using was unsafe and someone was going to get hurt. It finally happened. The socket blew off into my delicate chompers and blasted about four of them

Speaker 4:          01:25:44       into, how do you say oblivion. Whoa. Right. Luckily enough, I only have to get one fake one. Oh and this Thursday I am getting the other three composite and crowned and wait, how did this happen? What kind of tools? He just says he was asking, he doesn't say what the socket flew off of, what? Like is he working? He's a construction worker. He's been asking, he says, he just said I was asking for the correct tool and he doesn't say what he was doing. Wow. Anyways, three composite and crowds. So I only have to walk around looking like a cousin fucker for a few more days. Bam. We'll send more photos after my tea. Firs are high and tight. That is unbelievable. Heritable. That's crazy. Oh, I'm so sometime around March I will get the fake one after the implant has healed up and up jeans up. I'm so sorry Mike.

Speaker 4:          01:26:30       That is a terrible, terrible. I'm sure you can sue the fuck out of your boss though, by the way. Yes, I know, right? There's probably, he's the kind of guy I'm sure like on a, a guy, they're like gay people get two teeth knocked out here. This is what we do here. But he's, he asked for the proper tool that he needed to get it. That's why you should fucking have someone pay for that. Um, I have one. You have a dental update. I was flossing very hard around my crown on the side and I think it's, I think the crown, it's time to be replaced. Genes. We got to go to the Goddamn damn time we can, we haven't gotten the dentist now look after the new year after we've settled a bit. You don't want to get to the appointment. Mental work now. I know. Life is chaos right now. Let's make the appointment. Yeah, I am. All right. We have a closing song. It was submitted by Dj boy butter and it's called Mommy Fart in your face. Okay, thank you. Sounds like it could be pretty good, but see, I have not heard it yet, but here it is. Here it is. Goodbye guys. Hi, Mommy's
