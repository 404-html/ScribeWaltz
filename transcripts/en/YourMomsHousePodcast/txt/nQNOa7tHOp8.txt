Speaker 4:          00:06:43       you find them hideous. That's why you don't fuck your friends.

Speaker 3:          00:06:49       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:06:53       Don't bring in one loving to this. Well, go to your mom's house, Christina visits. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:07:45       I tried something new with the sound earlier. I was told that if I did this quarter inch to eighth inch line and set up, it would be better and it didn't sound as good. So I went back to the old setup. We also don't have the habits of the new board yet either. Oh, should we got an old barn? Oh, I see it right there. Yeah. Yeah. Well, why don't we hold it for the new studio? I mean, why bother setting it up here? We're just going to move in like three weeks. What if this, this is a p this is, I don't trust this thing anymore. I wanted to burp and then there was barf under it and I didn't, I don't trust this anymore. Why is that? What failed us? Yeah, that's the, Oh, the cable did the cable did we got a new cable in there, but it's not.

Speaker 3:          00:08:23       Yeah, but the board is, but well, it's a cable that came with the board and this board is kind of Dog Shit, Huh? Yeah. Then I guess we got to set that shit up. I need an engineer to come over. Yeah, I'd like that too. Yeah, that'd be great guys. We're so stoked. We were going to move into a new place. Yeah. We're going to have fucking dope ass studio and it's a little while here. Way better than we are. Way Better. It's much more advanced than what you guys are going to shit when you see it.

Speaker 3:          00:08:51       Yeah. No. See that's the kind of Burp I thought I was going to have. Yeah. And then there was too much vomit under it and I didn't want to push it. Yeah, sure. You want to keep that couch in that room in the the room. Why? Because you can't put like, you can't like kicky foot up. Did that couch, just so you know the sound studio we're getting. Yeah. It's a real studio. The Guy, the guy, the guy who owns it owned. Is it? He's a composer. Composer and he scored movies and famous people. He told us Michael Mann said on the couch. I Richie diarrhea. Richie Guy Ritchie. Oh, I'd like, I thought you said diarrhea. Richie ice cube. Ice Ice Poop. Yep. Can you believe Guy Ritchie was married to Madonna? I know. How horrible would that be? Yeah, he's the right Khan. He's a right cut a fire.

Speaker 3:          00:09:39       Yeah. So every ball is a right can't, but that couch has like stories to it. Right. And ice cube farted on that couch. Yeah, you're right. It's got the wrap or foreign. It's a weird stain on one side of it. Did you see it? Yeah, there's a weird stain. What color? It's just like a, it looks like it has some type of water damage or something on the left arm. Right. So you're telling me you don't want the couch? Well, not because of that. I was just thinking of being able to relax. You know, it's a relax room. Oh, you want to go in there and dad down? Well, I thought we would, we could watch movies in there also. Like, do you want that to be the movie watching couch? Well, here's a good point that our real estate lady said is that that couch fits in there and you know that it fits there. That's true versus the unknown. But here's what we can do. The day of moving. We bring our shit there. Yeah. And we test it out. And if we don't like it, that company that we use, they take away to stuff you don't want. Yeah. So like no harm. Okay. No harm. No fart. Yeah. Oh my God. I was going to say it the same. Yeah, I know you and I are like,

Speaker 4:          00:10:41       you know why you don't fuck your friends? I'll tell you why. I'll tell you why you find them hideous.

Speaker 5:          00:10:49       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:10:50       That's why you don't fuck your friends.

Speaker 3:          00:10:52       It seems like he really has thought about this. It's smart. You know I love her, but you know what? She hasn't thought about getting a haircut, a haircut and a proper support Bra. Oh, cause you can see her tits are not harnessed in, yeah. Maybe the whole new shirt [inaudible] magical. It's again and off. Yeah. There's like, I don't know. It looks like it's been, it's like that spray paint style, you know, like a mall. Yeah. Like a mall made shirt and there's stars and shit. Nah, I don't like it. But her tits are real sloppy and they're moving around. Let's see what she has to say. I think she might have more to say. Oh yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:11:27       Lie to them and say, well, my family, you move.

Speaker 5:          00:11:35       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:11:36       Why don't you fuck me?

Speaker 3:          00:11:39       Do you think that the thing is that she's desperate? Like is she making this because she's not getting laid? Yeah. It's kind of angry. Right? She's on the receiving end of that fight. Just like, why don't you fuck me? That's really the agenda here. Yeah. Yeah. What'd you fucker fucker? No, I'm being don't, don't just why not? Of course. Cause like she said she's hideous. What if it's her? I'm giving you permission. Yeah. You have to fuck her. No, I got it. No. And anybody else? Do you have any other suggestions for fucking are Guatemalan Nanny Bay? What is wrong with you? That's the whole point. It's a hard one. It's a, would you rather, it's the essence of it. So fucking horrible. Horrible. It's supposed to be black hoodie. A bank. She's like, look at her like a grandmother. I know. That's the point. Which I couldn't, I couldn't, I'd take this animal to doing these videos. Animal. That's such a dad old dad thing. This animal. Well she is, my dad says this fucker animal. That's what I,

Speaker 4:          00:12:44       yeah. Friendly relationships with people. Look, you're two adults. You're not related by blood.

Speaker 3:          00:13:02       It sounds like somebody is not returning her advances. What she's doing. What happened? Here's what can I tell you? My theory on this woman, she has a, a friend, she's attracted to attract a friend. This is all her inner thoughts coming out that she's never, she's wanting to tell this one friend who she's been dying to fuck. Yeah. And for her it's like this makes sense. Like the logic is there for her and that's why she's spewing this out. But that friend doesn't want to Fucker, you know, at all. Like there's not even any reciprocation. It's such an easy fix. I think. Just a little bit of makeup for this lady at a support Bra. Yeah. Maybe some therapy. Yeah. Clearly. Yeah. You got to work. So he got some shit you got to work out. Especially if you're posting this on Youtube. Yeah. It's real bad advertising. Yeah. This is real. Like, uh, like it's like a bad Facebook posts, but worse, cause it's, it's you actually on video saying things. Imagine her, all of her friends that see this, they're all like, oh God. And he's saying it or whoever. This is far. Yeah. I don't want to use pronouns. I don't want to assume. Well if I were to guess pronouns, I think she's talking to her. I don't think she's in the, he's, I don't think Zur is in the Sims, if you know what I'm saying.

Speaker 3:          00:14:29       Hey, I'm wondering what's your Pronoun but this cute little thumb rings. He's one of those dudes with summaries. What? What's up Russ respects somebody. Do you know that we've gotten some emails in the academic world. Um, hold on. Hi. We're doing one wide shot today, which is why we're like, we got to say something. Hi. Hello. This is how we're doing it today. We have no blue band of blue band is working on another project and this is to kind of save time in post. Hello. Anyways, we've been getting these emails from act people in academia and now it's, it's becoming the norm. Somebody signed off so you got like professor of the psychology department, Pronouns, Zim or he his whatever the fuck. I think the craziest one. I'm going to start doing that. We saw him one, it was like Roger and something and then it was like pronouns.

Speaker 3:          00:15:32       He him his, yeah. That's what I thought Robert. That is typical of a cisgender. It is, by the way, in some privileged, I don't know if you've seen this, but for a while now I haven't made any anything about it and I don't really get any attention for it, but I've been very high. This is my look at my, uh, this is my Twitter bio. Oh, I've seen this comedian tweets from Tom signed fart. I love it. You know what? They always do that for super famous people. It's like tweet from Tom Cruiser, sine t, all the, all those like really famous people have like their team manages it, but like if Barry Obama side, it's like, well those will be signed to be, oh, you know what I love is when people think you're famous enough to have someone managing your social media. It gives me a thrill.

Speaker 3:          00:16:25       I know. I don't know who manages your Twitter account. I'm like, gene, either do I get in touch with them? Like I said, on Facebook all the time ever really reads this. The truth is, I don't know, because I hate Facebook emails. So I checked them like once a month it'll full inbox. I'll skip over them. The worst, the worst Facebook message, you got to see this and a link. I go, Nope, I'm never gonna look at it. Because for some reason the video never loads quickly like it. It's like, uh, I also don't want to take that chance. What's the chance of, of like spending time seeing something I don't care about. So if they describe something in a meet an amazing detail, but when it's just like, this is hilarious, don't care. Yup. And nine times out of 10 it isn't, it's not something I've been sent. Okay. Jesus Christ is my n word. We've been sent. Oh my God. We get sent that daily to the show, to your mom's podcast@gmail.com and that's a fake thing. So we don't play that because we are aware. It's stupid. But I'll tell you the people that send us videos, big words to the show, they're funny. Yeah, those are great. A lot of good ones. Not like you're dumb friends. You know. The Shit. What was I going to say? I don't know. You got to see more of this lady.

Speaker 4:          00:17:46       People pretend to care about like you know, it's like these poor people who have down syndrome, you know, like, like, like eat all, they're put into this world and nobody's going to fuck with him. You might have people who are like high function, it's not true. And yet these people go, oh I love these people, I take care of them every day. And I have a good friend who is, who's east high function you has down syndrome and I feel like saying um, did you find them? Did you bought them? Did you, did you blow it? Did the guy could probably really use a little below.

Speaker 3:          00:18:20       Did you see a movie? She's, she's got a lot of dark. Let anger and see only cares about blowing down. By the way, that's our biggest problem. I was sent a link to, I think the show's called born like this and I watched it. I was, I can't believe how misinformed I was on like the, your assumption of all downs people that like the how articulate and and and high functioning to, to borrow from are our friend here. These people were like two of the Lane married one. The guy, they were like, are you interested in dating? He's like, I don't want it. Like he talked like that I'm not interested in dating a girl with down syndrome. And they were like, why? He was like, honestly I'm not attracted to it. Like that was the level of the conversation that he didn't talk funding at all? No, there was no like a affectation. Nope. It's pretty nice to you to take it there though. But that's what we're having. We're having a nice time. And then everybody listening is thinking because you ordered, cause you're talking like you're talking normally and everyone in their head is translating it to retarded when you straighten your arms.

Speaker 6:          00:19:36       Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:19:39       That guy's, that guy's, that guy's not retarded. That's, that's the best part. Let's go guys functioning. And he just,

Speaker 3:          00:19:53       he just makes himself returners. Nice, Nice, Nice. Everybody's thinking. I'm just saying what the listeners? No, no, the answer is no. They were like, he talked, he talked like Tom Segura. I mean, I wouldn't take it there. It wasn't like guys like you're all, would you fuck a down syndrome? No, no down syndrome girl or her. Honestly, this, this lady really scares me. I think there's some real severe look out. I mean that that looks like when you see somebody that killed somebody and they do a mugshot and you're like, especially when it's a woman, you're like woo. And they show that. I'm like, Oh yeah, I see that Eileen Warner, there's, there's just darkness and her man angry. You know what this is like a, like an East Coast d like, you know, some of them are just so angry just because they're born the east coast

Speaker 7:          00:20:48       and they were like, we don't have Starbucks. Really have Dunkin donuts and there's no sun. No Sun shine here. Oh your mom's con. Yeah, the citrus is terrible. I know she's mad cause she can't get a decent avocado on the east coast. Everybody gets mad about that. Fucking blow him. Did you fuck them? That's really, that's a really look for that to be your genuine perspective. No, not at all. On the normal regimen. And that's probably on the list of things a downs person is concerned with. Like they fall by the way. That's the other thing you should've put. She's wrong about, it's wrong. She didn't she have a lot of sex. No, I didn't download caffeine anyways. Every time this thing goes asleep, I get 25 messages. Get Caffeine asshole. I know. And I keep forgetting. Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:21:38       So

Speaker 7:          00:21:39       or so grumpy today. I know. Um, I, I've had my foot up here. Okay. Uh, yeah, she's, she's, she's grumpy. Uh, very [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          00:21:49       Normally how many sick a straight women, straight women who, who write the trying to understand core lesbian. Do you want to understand what you want to help me? Okay. Do you want, you want to help me? Any straight women out there link my con, lick it until I calm in your mouth.

Speaker 8:          00:22:13       Didn't

Speaker 7:          00:22:14       do it for you is a really, this is the equivalent of some really sexually repressed dude. Yeah. Women are fucking assholes. Something like that. Like it's a lot. She's that aggressive. She's like, she's like a dude that's upsetting. It's like a bummer how upset she is. It's not attractive to the what part.

Speaker 8:          00:22:38       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:22:38       Is it all the physical features that are thrown together? Oh, is it the attitude? It's the attitude. Yeah, because honestly somebody in the world would find her physically. She's not physically, she's talking about after an adventure and like maybe like digging through some caves. There would be someone that we could find that would fuck her. You said somebody in the world, I'm just saying that they're not around probably that much, but if you kept searching and you got like a like a group of people together and it was one of those things where you went, you know when they have like 70 people walk through the woods and they each have a flashlight, like a search party, then they can find the one person that would fucker. I got what you're saying. Yeah, you're right.

Speaker 4:          00:23:15       You want to be helpful. Straight women open up a nice little lesbian sexual clinic. Go in there and dress up in a nurses out there with the shortest skirt and you can come in and go, hi honey. Time to get your spine reach back. Then you wouldn't be kicked out of your rubber Mommy fucking rubbing my face.

Speaker 7:          00:23:35       Yeah, so attractive and she's really crazy. I feel like I need to tell her, you know how you're going to get laid. Not that like I need to help her. How's, how would you help her? First

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       of all, right

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       lick Kublai Khan.

Speaker 3:          00:23:52       First of all, she's a positive attitude. Lesbian or not? No one likes a Debbie Downer. Like it doesn't matter what you do. And then maybe change the tee shirt. Maybe we're a bra. Yeah. I mean I don't think she wears deodorant. Do you think she would be like, you know what? How about I buy a new t shirt at all? Fucking wear some makeup and then all you gotta do.

Speaker 5:          00:24:16       He's like my country.

Speaker 3:          00:24:18       She, she really throws it out there. She does. Yeah. She's aggressive. Do you remember that one time when we were in New York City for my 30th birthday we were with Shauna and Joanie. Thank you. And we were in the, what's their park park called? The big core central park and dumpy. Remember it's been stuck in my brain for 10 years. It's a woman who walked up to us and she wanted to, she bumped you want to bum a cigarette and she was wearing a shirt with the shirt tee shirt with no bra. And she was young too. Right? That's what stood out. And she was young. She was in her 20s. Cute. But there were like sloppers I remember just being like, I bet like for 20 bucks. And he's like, Hey, he my asshole for 20 bucks. I bet she'd be like, all right.

Speaker 3:          00:25:06       Now she's like, can I bum a cigarette? You're like, if eat my ass hall. Do you think she did it for a cigarette? I think she was uh, you know, down enough on life that you could have been, you had to ask her anything. She was down online. Oh, she looked really, really like she was bummed out. Like she didn't belong. It feels like a runaway. Wow. You really remembered her. Yeah. Yeah. Cause I was like, oh my wished her team would take a walk so I could see what I can figure out what this chick, you know, cause her tits. What was neat about and why it sticks out in my mind, it's the way that they moved. Like you ever seen when the ladies, the burlesque ladies with the tassels. Yes. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Just from walking the walk. But they went like this boom, boom.

Speaker 3:          00:25:53       Until they didn't, they didn't sync up. Right. It was also one of those things where the four of it was the four of us, we all are to turn crazy. Everybody saw it. And it's rare when four people notice the exactly like triple J's on a 21 year old girl and like Shauna and I, the bus station for days now I bum a cigarette. She did not say that. She looked like it. She did. She looked like it. And I was like, why don't you give me a fucking blow job? Jesus. No, I, you're so aggressive, bitch, sitting over here fucking lick my can.

You were talking earlier about, um, Dan Amoss a Ma, you know, and how standard must on a mall, how it's important to have stand on my, um, the standard. My kid put together some raps. Oh, cool.

All of these nerds going to tap it Victoria secret and they complaining they don't have money because they spend money on these twitch hose because they can't control their desire. But then the minute you call them out, it's politically correct. You're a woman. Hated massage. Dennis. This is political correctness up the ass political correctness.

Yeah, maybe just work on it. He talks about words in the second verse. Okay. All right. Let's give it a listen.

Speaker 9:          00:40:42       I can't even, I can't even look on my computer screen because they want to castrate me and crucify me over some, and political incorrectness can't even use the word slow anymore because it's wrong and they need to take it out the dictionary for these people want to take everything out of the dictionary because everything's offensive to them.

Speaker 7:          00:41:00       Okay. Do you know what I was thinking and a correct me if I'm wrong. Yeah. The one thing you really need the rap is flow. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:41:46       and says, hey jeans. I just wanted to pile on the heap and the Pooh story debate. I am inclined to believe Tom because on boy scout outings we would do something similar. You were supposed to dig a sizeable hole. The being fascinated by fire and fucked up stuff. As teenage boys we would use sticks, leaves or we would, we could find a sizable sheet of bark to move the poop and do a mound. We would then set the very flammable methane life shit stack ablaze best Ben Jeans.

Speaker 3:          00:42:18       It's not exactly, it's not exactly the way you described your poop pile. It's not exactly the same, but name is similar. I'll tell you why. You at one point lied and said that you had a ladder and that you guys would climb up the ladder. I said, ally and hang your ass is over the ladder and then shit. Awful ladder, which is almost impossible to off of a ladder. A ladder on a tree. You know, it was like, no. There were steps. Someone hammered into a tree, you could climb up a makeshift ladder and then on the tree there was a like a seat, like a ledge. You could sit on and shit from the tree or you find that this is so stupid and that you keep adding to it. Adding till, I'm not adding. Why would you do that? Why would you go through the trouble of building a makeshift ladder on a tree? Yeah, so you could climb up it and then she boot pile. That's a lie. You think, ah, I like that. And then people would, they would drop with either the children would come running for miles, they would on the poupon. They loved it. The kids loved it. And neighborhood kids, you'd see it. They would drop their ice cream just to do it, you know? Okay. It was really not, I know. He was really fun. Yeah. Officially line. I'm not guys don't believe Thompson Gora. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:43:37       I'm leaving this guy. You got another email from a listener that says, Hey, I know my, my husband is now using a double pipe. Classic excuse to Fart all over the place. Thanks guys. I played me both. I want this to stop. No more double pipe. Classic mythology is low and loose, Jess.

Speaker 3:          00:43:58       Okay. Wow. Yeah, yeah. This year it. See I can't do that with moving on to the room. Right. I feel like it's too, it's too much for him. Yeah. I'm his mother figure. I feel like he can't see, can't handle it. Not, yeah, he doesn't have the standard. The standard. Yep. You heard it first here. Sorry. Blue Band.

Speaker 2:          00:44:19       No farts. Hi Mommy's. I'm a huge fan of your show as well as mommy jeans. That's deep, Bro. Weekly Jam. That keeps me sane. Thank you. Normally I wouldn't chime in, but after that, after listening your last podcast,

Speaker 7:          00:44:32       I had to say something you guys were talking about naming your next born Carl's Jr. Well, I am a woman. I forgot about that. I have a one and a half year old daughter who's exclusive. Nickname is just that I nicknamed her car when she was just a newborn and somehow it morphed into Carl's Jr. My super uptight mom always has to throw her 2 cents in about how I'm screwing up my kid and giving her gender identity issues because of this, I say in an era where people name their Kids Cherries, waffles, tennis and apple race car. Whatevs this nickname is totally acceptable considering she has a normal girl's first name for all intents and purposes, which I typically call her in public. My hope is that you guys can weigh in on weird family nicknames you were called and ones you plan on embarrassing your kid with also.

Speaker 7:          00:45:23       Am I fucked up? I fucked up. Parents were calling my kid this hilarious nickname. What's the long term damage? Thanks. Love y'all. Zooey um, I have to say you're talking to nicknamed fanatics 10 nicknames for everybody. If it's a problem, we're in trouble. So we have a lot of nicknames for ourselves, for each other, for drugs. Yeah. I mean, you know, we actually, many of you know our good friend Ryan Sickler, I started calling him sickle cell 10 years ago calling him sickle cell. No you didn't. And I called him a with, sorry. Sorry. You need to get your life because that was mine. No, no, no. I've called them sickle cell the longest mine. You're lying. No, no, no, no. Not you like your claim things that I did. I called him sickle cell after sickle cell anemia. Dave. I know what it's named after.

Speaker 7:          00:46:17       I know what I had called him. Of course. Of course. I remember when I told it to you. You do not remember when you told it to me. No, you laughed and then you go, we can't call him that. That's so inappropriate. That was fun. He's a comedian. It's fine. No, you're so crazy. You're going to, you're so crazy. What are you talking to? I came up with sickle cell. You don't even know what sickle cell anemia was at the time. What are you talking about? Okay. Anyways. Oh my God. Okay, let's ask sickle cell. Okay, let's ask him. I'm going to call him right now. Yeah. All right. But he doesn't know who invented it. I don't think maybe he'll have a recollection. I think he's going to say it's me. Well, that's what you're claiming. So I would assume that you think that, but then how does he know who invented it? Cause I could have told you at home and then you could have said it first to him and then he thinks you came up with it cause you were the first to say it. You seem you have a reputation and we'll just, your or your reputation is a shaky memory. So I don't think it's, first of all, that's so fucking bullshit. What? You're such

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       a bullshitter. Your list smiling because you know you're lying right now. I think it's so funny that you, everything that I say you're like, I thought of that. I said that for her. It did say that first. Okay. All right. Oh my God. Fucking hope he answers be does too. How come? What's going on?

Speaker 10:         00:47:49       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:47:49       It's horrible. It's not going to answer it. Some weird Skype.

Speaker 10:         00:47:54       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:47:56       Dammit. You're so, so full of it.

Speaker 3:          00:48:01       I named him that. Tony's been four. I thought of sickle cell. Okay. All right. Okay. So I'll just give you, I'll just give you that bone. So Christina, oh my God. Heard me say something and then said that she did it. Oh my God. You're such a shitbag. Next you're going to say you came up with El Chapo. That was mine. Oh, though is mine. Chap Pito is yours. El Chapo. I called him El Chapo first. The baby, right? Oh John. I'm the queen of nicknames and songs. And you even told me that you're good at it. Yes, thank you. But you didn't come up with sickle cell. Oh my God, you didn't. Oh my God, you did. That is one thing I know I came up with his sickle cell. You did not. You're such a shitbag. You are liar babe. Oh my God. I'm embarrassed for you.

Speaker 3:          00:48:49       Oh my God. I'm embarrassed for you. Where's your fucking water? Water Champ. What are you drinking? That's not water. Yeah, it is. It's salted flavored water. I'm the real watershed. Zero Sodium, by the way, by the way, zero sugar zero. By the way, when I, I got a lot of tweets from people who saw your shows in Texas reporting back to me. You had no water on stage. Okay. I did have water on stage, but you didn't talk but you didn't touch it. Right, right. So, okay, if it was 2100 sets, so what? I don't go 20 minutes without hydrating.

Speaker 3:          00:49:23       Well look at your Yorkie sieve. It doesn't matter. I do frequency. Now let's talk about nicknames. Did you have any embarrassing? Let's go back to this and not about all right. You named them and say go sell. Um, so the point is we call our friend sickle cell. Oh my God. Which is for people that are, that don't know what's going on. And then they hear you go like, hey sickle cell. Like believe me, we've seen people turn hell. Even one of our friends heard the nickname, ended up working with Ryan somewhere years ago. Saw Him and yelled out in an office setting sickle cell. And she said this guy popped over the uh, there was like a cubicle and you went like sickle cell. And then Ryan was like, uh, that's what they call me. Like had to, cause I came up with it. You thought it was so offensive. You wouldn't say it for the longest time. I called Ryan sickle cell first and he went and then you hopped onboard. Okay. That's how it worked. Okay. Okay. Remember, remember Moreau when you went to the, and then they're like, as a lot of cabinet dabbling. Me Too. Oh my God. It did happen to ruin you. Studied in Spain for a semester. And I know I did not do that.

Speaker 3:          00:50:43       Such a dad laughed. Now can we talk about this topic though? I like this idea. I know what your parents called you. Let's see. Last year, I know you're coming and turning into your time. Starting at the top dog. I know your parents called you the king of the dumps. King of the dumps. As My, my dad calls me, he calls me big dog. Yeah. Uh, for a while was it like when I was a kid was Kaka maker. Uh Huh. King of the dumps.

Speaker 7:          00:51:14       Um, yeah. You know, stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          00:51:19       They call me Chris Tucker. Yup. Christa law as in a horse. There's some rhyme and Hungarian. She got, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Oh, that's right. Tell people what that song means. It means the snow is falling. The horses are farting and the the littlest or worse taking a shit that's a Hungarian like a, it's like a children's song. Yeah. So, uh, there is a time where we call each other little at the end of it, like crystal low, poppy low. So they call me Chris Crystal. Why? Why did they call you that? I forget low. We just add it because that song was around our house and she got home, Christy low and we were just singing a lot. So I became Criscuolo could he see low? Oh Krista, Krista Potsy, which is a horse to [inaudible] low energy. You do like a lot of times you walk kind of horse like not true. Yeah, true. We kind of have a go.

You saw me doing them this morning at 5:00 AM yeah, we got a lot of nicknames by the way, for our son. I know, and I just ate what I did. And guys, if you have children, I recommend doing this.

In a, in a Ziploc bag and then put them in the freezer.

Speaker 3:          01:03:10       So your freezer was just like full 50 Ziploc bags of lemon juice. And you're like, what? So my father, we had a lemon tree back in the house we lived at, this is when I was a teenager and she lived in Canada at the time and she grew up in Hungary where they never saw citrus cause of communism. There was no fruit. So she came to La to visit us and also the climate, right? Climate. Yeah. She could not believe we were wasting free citrus lemons. So she juiced and I mean it took days and she juiced every single lemon and then put the juice in a Ziploc bag, a regular old zip lock, and then put it in the freezer. Now she used the freezer that was in our garage that my father used for Fresca and beer. Like, you know, he only has like a fresca and beer. It's a real dad move like that. And she took out all the fresca and the beer and just stocked it. Oh, I didn't realize it was that much. I mean I'm not, it was bags. What'd your death thrilled when he found out live it?

Speaker 3:          01:04:14       Fuck, are we going to do the fucking lemon juice? I mean, I don't even need the shit. But what happened was, so she took the lemon, she made lemon cakes, lemon juice, lemon bars. She uses everything. And then she went back home to Canada and we had these bags. And sure enough, my dad actually ended up making lemonade a lot. So it was a good thing. And we used them for years, like years later. Fresh lemonade is delicious. Certainly is Tom.

I feel like, I feel like the way Christina says it, I feel like I've heard it more, but I really felt like you started saying it first.

Speaker 7:          01:14:25       Yeah. That's how you feel. Cause I do a lot of times I know my therapist has to go with my feelings. So I feel like, I feel like he just spoke and dairy Ryan, I invented it. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:14:39       I'm going my feelings right now.

Speaker 14:         01:14:40       I feel like it was t bonds. I might, God, sorry Christina. But am I wrong? Yes you can. But here's the thing, I'm malleable so if you can go, we'll remember this. I could go, oh yeah, yeah, I do remember,

Speaker 7:          01:14:52       cause I feel like I invented it and then he was too chicken shit to call it to your face. And then I did at first me, I'm chicken shit to call it. They call him sickle cell. You didn't want to, you thought it was,

Speaker 14:         01:15:05       I'll tell you the, the best way to solve this. Yeah. After call, call pudding. No, we're definitely not going to do that. We're a APP. Do you remember when I came to see your, uh, to Brian screening? Yeah, the screening and I walked into the movie theater. Right. And in unison you both screen Circleville everyone including African Americans in the theater looked at me. So I feel like maybe it was a joint venture. Really

Speaker 7:          01:15:38       better answer. That's good answer. The maiden voyage or we were going through all nick, the reason, and we're going through nicknames that we have for family, for friends, and that's how it came up. And you actually just brought up one you didn't even bring up was buns. Obviously you call me, you call me buns sometimes fun your buns. Busay bunzee sometimes. Yeah,

Speaker 14:         01:15:58       yeah, that all up.

Speaker 2:          01:16:01       Yeah. Bonds a bond. Fun. I remember those. He used to leave me voicemails. Ryan would call me and it would just, it would go to voicemail and I press play and it'd be like, okay, I'm calling for bonds. And he would leave a long message about like, I'm out on a fishing boat and this guy, this guy taps me on the shoulder. I mean, I couldn't believe some guys swam up to me and he said, I'm looking for buns. And that would be the [inaudible] Leo. Yeah. You leave me these elaborate messages about looking for buns. Tenets. I got socks and balls and dicks and taints. I liked that one. Um, t bonds came from Tommy bonds, which comes from the movie belly where Dmx, Dmx plays a character named Tommy buttons. So in College, Huh?

Speaker 14:         01:16:51       I'm going to ask you back. Yeah. When is the first part you said Tom, you say you created, yeah, pickle here are the originator. So when, when was the first time you remember calling me that and same question for you, Chris.

Speaker 7:          01:17:03       The first time I remember calling you that I honestly can't remember. I mean it would be like, it would have to be back around.

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       Oh my God. Probably 2004 or something. Three or four. No. When did you start dating? You and I started dating around that time. Yeah. More. Your and I started dating more, I would say Ledo for early oh five. Interesting. And right around the time the nickname originates. Yeah. Interesting. Well that's right around the time I started, you know, hanging out with Ryan a lot too, so, oh, oh you guys weren't friends before? Yeah, we were. Okay. I said, Oh, three Oh four, I think it came around the Putin time, the Putin era, putting another nickname of a great man. Um, yeah, more nicknames.

Speaker 14:         01:17:49       I can't take credit. That's our high school football coach.

Speaker 3:          01:17:52       Do you remember that? I love that. The story behind that is one of my favorite nickname stories. It's just that basically Ryan's old roommate was playing high school football, goes to his coach, which is, it's better if you really imagine how pathetic this is that a player went up to a coach and was like, all these guys have nicknames. I want to nick. And then the coach looked him up and down and goes,

Speaker 14:         01:18:17       well it gave me, he gave an elevator look up and down and then just went poorly.

Speaker 3:          01:18:24       And then he was happy with that. Right. Wasn't he happy with pudding?

Speaker 14:         01:18:27       I mean, you gotta be fucking happy what you asked for.

Speaker 3:          01:18:31       Do you have any other nicknames? I mean, sickle cell is your best nickname. I'll go ahead and say that. Yeah, but do you have any other ones? Huh?

Speaker 14:         01:18:38       I'm sure Beth goes to a, an individual preference on that. But yeah, there's been up. Christina says you stay oh three Oh four Putin was oh two so Christina statewide might've just might've just on a sentence here.

Speaker 3:          01:18:56       Wait, wait. I'm confused. Wouldn't put in half that putting God his nickname in high school though, right?

Speaker 14:         01:19:03       Yeah, but what I'm saying is Christina said she sickle cell originating around that time, that time would have been 2002 which precedes your o three o fours.

Speaker 3:          01:19:14       Interesting. I'm confused. Meaning I'm right. That's how they originated with sickle cell. Burkina falls. And I'm saying wait, meaning I the, I say the name origin dates further back in time. That's not true. Meaning that's not, I'm right and you're wrong. It doesn't update date back to Otu. That's what Ryan's saying. That's what your BFF is saying.

Speaker 14:         01:19:34       Chris, I asked you when you first remembered you said, oh three Oh four I asked Christina when she said quoting top, beginning of putting time

Speaker 3:          01:19:42       around the pudding era. You weren't hanging out with Brian and putting an old man, but listen, Tangier was happening and I would book you and Ryan every week when we were doing Tangier. And that was right around Oh two oh three and I saw, I know them guys were done in Atlanta. Yeah. He says one of his favorite rooms he ever did and I know it wasn't that fun. Yeah. And I remember Ryan seeing you at the cat club and that and round there,

Speaker 7:          01:20:08       that era came sickle cell. Okay.

Speaker 14:         01:20:17       That night was when it was really like, I feel like you guys had just been saying it's a meaty, but that's what it was born

Speaker 7:          01:20:23       well walked into Brian's screening and we saw him. My favorite sickle cell story is when I was working that writing job we were talking about this

Speaker 14:         01:20:38       Dina's friend coincidentally happened to work on the same floor to fill side of the building in parenthesis down the hallway screaming sickle cell and this little feminine black to that sat across from me named Kendrick, who I love all. I could hear him say, well say it.

Speaker 7:          01:20:56       I laughed so hard. I didn't know what to say. I was like, isn't that a terrible nickname?

Speaker 14:         01:21:08       So that I can phrase the how, how we, I say it like that. Back to that guy.

Speaker 7:          01:21:14       Yeah. It predates other nicknames. Yeah. Do you have any other nicknames, Ronnie? Ronnie love?

Speaker 14:         01:21:24       Um, that's really it. I mean my last name, so a lot of people just short. A lot of people have shortened sickle cell probably cause they don't want to look like the idiots that you guys do to sickle. Not comfortable screaming across the crowded fucking

Speaker 7:          01:21:47       if I got you like a jacket with a badge that says sickle cell on it, would you wear that? Definitely. I would never wear that. How about a hat? Yeah. What if it's a real nice jacket though? Like a nice jacket or a nice hat. I thought you just meant like a cheap wind breaker. But if it, what if it was like, it was like a $1,500 leather, you know, Gucci Jacket and we just so sickle cell on there? Yeah. Embroider it.

Speaker 14:         01:22:23       Yes. That a badge. Like I'd be sheriff.

Speaker 7:          01:22:28       Okay. That's pretty cool. We got to get that for him. Christmas is right around. Um, do you remember Vinnie Jones? No, Vinnie Jones was a, a British footballer, right as we would call him a soccer player. Um, and here he is in a scene from the movie snatch. Oddly enough. Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:24:57       That's him right there with like the big mug.

Speaker 7:          01:25:02       Great Movie Guy Richie as you mentioned.

Speaker 8:          01:25:12       Hmm.

Speaker 15:         01:26:24       You don't have to second folks

Speaker 7:          01:26:25       guys good though. Oh, he's amazing. Um, that's how good I am too. So second, but the funny thing is he's known for being, you know, he was uh, like I said, well known, not just soccer player footballer, but he was one of like the, you know, intimidators aggressive types on the field. Fuck people up, you know. So anyways, I guess now he's doing some coaching or something. It's like he's coaching and we're trying to see where he's coaching here. See if the leads, anyway, there's a video of him, given what it looks like. Obviously people are younger than him. He's coaching them up. Like what the fuck was that? Oh God,
