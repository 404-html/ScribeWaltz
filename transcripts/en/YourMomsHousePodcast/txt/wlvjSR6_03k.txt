Are douchebags dip shits. He's like, fuck these people go fuck tweet. Fuck with fuckers. And then these guys are the idiots that paid a $12,500 to go. How much it is. I think it's around that. I get the emails now. It might be, um, I try and 12 grand to go to his castle for a few days seminar in Scotland for a week, a week seminar. And he's so funny. He's like, everything I have is written in my queue, what he calls it, the quantum leap advanced or something. The QLA that's his program. I read his book online. It's unintelligible. It's got like random sense and that's like lol, exclamation mark. Every other third sentence in his book it says that, yeah, it doesn't, I tried reading and it just doesn't really make a lot of sense. It's not very cogent. It's like not well written, but he would tell you, cause you're a fucking mongoloid. Yeah, I'm going to youtube fucker. Yeah. And he also shoots on people watching him on Youtube. Mongoloid is watching me. Yeah. Here. Um, he's just an old military guy

Speaker 10:         00:10:40       now. Apple have, you know this, and I'm being sarcastic and I'm being a cheeky, uh, the Sally and I, uh, I've lived all over the world. We used to live in Monte Carlo. This is how they dress.

Speaker 9:          00:10:52       So if you're listening, he's wearing like a velvet, uh, like dotted Tuxedo jacket without a massive black bow tie and almost like a floral patterned shirt underneath it tightly.

Speaker 7:          00:11:11       Yeah. World. He, oh, he usually wears a Tuxedo to class. He looks, it looks, that's crazy. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:11:17       The pigs, you know. Oh and I, uh, I have lived all over the Woolies live in Monte Carlo. This is how they dress

Speaker 7:          00:11:26       pigs, you know, and this is my, this isn't even dressed up. Okay. Yeah, yeah. No, it's dressed up there. That's how my dad used to talk all the time. Everything has to do with gene. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:11:39       Yeah. Jeans. Um, I remember when I did my semester abroad when I did Spain. Yeah. Their main thing, they didn't really talk about American behavior, you know, cause a lot of kids were louder and more obnoxious Americans

Speaker 3:          00:11:53       that went over. They were always like, we know an American cause you guys dressed like shit. Shit. Yeah, it's true. When I go back to Hungary to visit my family, yeah. That's the first thing. They talk shit to me like, oh the fucking blue jeans and my parents, both my parents, if you went to the doctor, you dressed up, you didn't wear a fucking genes. Right, right. My Dad hates jeans. Yeah. So does mine. Yeah. I hate, well good genes don't like jeans. I know. Doesn't either. Okay. Just look sloppy. And I used for years, he used to be like, you got to shave that when I had more just like scruff. Yeah, go. No, let me just look scruffy scruff. Yeah. I don't like it. And now he likes her. He would say that too. We're going to go to this dinner. You can't wear jeans.

Speaker 3:          00:12:40       And he would get excited. Kind of excited to say that. No, you can't wear jeans. How does he feel about your beard now? I think it's so many years, I think. And it's, it's bigger. So it's accepted as part of, yeah, it looks good now. Whoever that guy that fucked you grew back nights is that his plan? You think I'm going to give you a haircut that in three weeks you're going to love. That's his formula. It might be what are your next three weeks looking at it because you're going to look like shit. You know what the irony of that horrible thing happening is that you've been performing in these enormous venues where it's not that the audience is intimate with you, you're up on a huge screen. Right. So people are looking really at your face more than jumbotrons. Yeah, like stadium size jumbo trons right. So you're getting scrutinized more now horse than ever before. Let me, let me see what my love Dan has to say.

Speaker 10:         00:13:31       And I know you think that somehow designer jeans, I don't know what that means. I have some, in fact, how many got genes in the last four or five years and my kids think it's a riot when they see me in him. Yeah, a designer jeans. I guess it's because when they cost seven, 800 bucks, I guess that's um, uh, you know, that's the definition designer. Did you probably don't have to pay seven, 800 bucks from genes. But anyway, uh, I hear at Costco you get James for 80 bucks or 80 year olds or 40 year olds. I can't somehow, for some reason women's jeans cost more than men.

Speaker 11:         00:14:01       Does anybody know why?

Speaker 10:         00:14:04       Because women are stupid.

Speaker 3:          00:14:12       Yeah. Keep it playing. I know.

Speaker 11:         00:14:16       Ain't know why?

Speaker 10:         00:14:18       Because women are stupid and they'll pay more. That's why there's less material unless you got, you know, some big fucking hog of a woman. But the, uh, the mortar love I guess. But, uh, I don't understand why women's jeans, anybody on Youtube, you little fucking wimps. Uh, email me and tell me why women Jane's class more when there's less material. Unless you've got a big hog.

Speaker 3:          00:14:44       He's such an old military dude. Yeah. Yeah. His background is that, so he just lives like he's still in the military. His philosophy basically, I'm going to say whatever I say and you can go fuck yourself. He believes it. I think I believe that too. Yeah. I think I might hold a similar philosophy if you were more famous. In other words, if he was part of the mainstream, it would be really funny to hear, you know, these talking head news shows, interviews you just said, and he'd be like, fuck you. I wish, I think that's why he's not more well known. He just doesn't give a shit. And that's not as refined as a a Tony Robbins, let's say. Oh yeah, but he, by the way, I watched, I haven't finished that, that flicks thing. [inaudible] he curses a lot more than I thought he does. And he says he does it to jar people out of their everyday.

Speaker 3:          00:15:30       Yeah. But he's also got a refined, and he's a good communicator, refining refined message. And this guy has done, unfortunately. Yes. You a fucking hog. Like Tony Rap. Yeah, no. Yeah. Tony Robbins is more of a feel good. He's kind of crazy. You know, he's just an old military. He's kind of nuts. Absolutely. Out of his mind. He's absolutely, but he made a ton of money. Most of it, I think doing these seminars. He has, uh, this, this inflated a number floating around out there, you know, I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I know that he made a lot of money as a CEO of some big company. Yeah. And then he was fired as a CEO, and the next day he started the seminar. And I don't know what his actual value is. I think the $50 billion thing is when he was a CEO.

Speaker 3:          00:16:16       He made that much for this company. Right. But I don't know if that's his actual, you know what he's worth now? I don't know. Yeah, I don't, I don't definitely got money though. I don't doubt that. I don't doubt that he has money. I don't think that he's a worth $50 billion. He's never, never been mentioned on any of these. No. That's what I'm saying. The $50 billion is when he was a CEO of some company and he made that much revenue for the company. But he personally didn't do it for like his own company. Right. Why? No, but so, but that leaves in the question, what is that guy? What is he worth? It's not out there. I don't see it. Oh No. He calls himself the $50 billion man. Whatever. We just a couple of Youtube fucks. Anyone you should listen to his podcast. It's so funny cause he answers people's questions. That's the whole thing. And every answer is like, I dunno, it's on my fucking website. You Fuck, look at it. Tweet. Fuck it. Like fuck it. I don't care. So he's the worst podcast and the audio quality's terrible. Good. Good.

Speaker 8:          00:17:19       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:17:21       I love it here. You do by loves you. But yeah, but in my case, yeah, I love you, but I don't want to have sex with you, you know? And uh, and I just, I could live just on lust, you know, and I'm 70 so I mean, but I love your youtube.

Speaker 8:          00:17:37       Okay. Okay.

Speaker 10:         00:17:39       Hey, Chinese got any Chinese shit to say?

Speaker 3:          00:17:42       All right. Dang. When Jane,

And he's like, Hey, Chinese got any Chinese shit to say. Dang Wing Jing Ping. When gene, he does that a lot. Yeah. He just fucks with you like whatever your race is, whatever your thing is, he'll just fuck with you like they do in the military. You know he doesn't care. No, he definitely doesn't care. Oh Man. And he out. He talked about it before on youtube where he's like, you fucks can write in the comments. I don't give a shit. Fuck you. Like he doesn't care. He's like, I'm not politically correct, but Chinese thing, their access to soften this clip earlier and then a girl, a Chinese girl actually that's who he's talking to you. Yes. Yeah, yeah. And somehow for some reason women's jeans, they, um, so far are we supposed to be watching it? Well, no. So I'm expecting a fuck up then the next day or two because it, it's gone. I want to hear her talk on girl and I haven't had to pivot yet. So it's, it's obvious are important because at least somebody in the team and the way I show up on Youtube, oh my God, I love you. You too. Bye. Love you. This is a, but in my it misunderstanding, I'm just asking if you have any comments and you're, he's got any Chinese shit to say. Dang. When Jane, uh, please say it again. Slowly.

Speaker 7:          00:19:39       That's a Chinese girl. He says that to their fence normal and there's like, I saw one clip with like a Chinese dude and he's like, I could change John. Ding Dong. What do you have to say? It's like, actually I have a question like he did. They don't care. They're used to it right there. It was that a retarded person could, you said you have a question. Is that what you're meant to do? Chinese retarded. I'm a huge damn pain your family. I just, I can't get enough of this guy. It's hard not to be or not to be. You know what he really preaches though. I'll tell you what the, if you distill it and I've read his website, I've read everything. Yeah. He really breaks down people sense of fear. Um, his whole thing is like, do one thing a day that scares you because if you break down people's fear, you break down the fear of failure. And the fear of success and you'll do whatever the fuck it takes to be successful space. So that's what he's doing. He's like, stop being a fucking pussy. Just do it asshole. You know, who cares whatever you are. Chinese, a woman, whatever. Like he actually does like women. He said that he, he refers to like, um, female CEO's the crater of Victoria secret. That woman in

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       some other video I saw like he, he gets it, but you know, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:21:07       It's one of the best songs you've ever had made. Ching Chong. Yeah. I think there's a good one that came in from Jenna. Oh yeah, she submitted one. We played this on patriotic, but we put that shit down. Overlooked it for your mom's house and we know it came in after it came in afterwards episode. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, yeah. Let's see. It was all types. We, we never fully get to explore all the great music you guys send in cause you do send an incredible music and um, yeah, this, this latest one was from Jenna, is that her name? Jenna, Jenna. It's water champ song. It's really good. Yeah, she did the thing that I think uh, um, ob one did once was that she pieced together things. Setting conversation, right. To make it flow like a slog. Actual things we've said. Yeah. Jenna. Uh, uh, this song is called Watergate. You want to hear it? Yeah,

Speaker 13:         00:22:15       I'm standing there and I smell what smells like somebody just dumped an entire container of coffee in the shower like somebody took, I don't know what that is.

Speaker 3:          00:22:30       Okay.

Speaker 13:         00:22:30       Like do you think you could drink water today? Dad always been a big water drinker. Oh, bull shit. I have your P is like Brown.

Speaker 7:          00:33:47       I mean, I'm going to ask you just fire it up. Unless these are select clips from a bigger piece that we're not seeing. All the information is just, she's got the marbles, the toilet paper, six butts to tits and a private investigator. It sounds a little paranoid.

Speaker 15:         00:34:03       Come over and look at antelope project. How come that's fallen down already? Go look at Harris Bridge. I got a funny look and Harris Bridge. Why do you already have structural damage? Because you can't put crappy, crappy material in the concrete. But you guys let it all happen and so you know what? I'm going to be here every single time there's a meeting. Cause guess what? We're going public, aren't we?

Speaker 3:          00:34:27       Okay. How much of a bomber or would it be if every time you're on city council and you have one of these meetings, you see her in the, in the seat, you're like, God dammit. I know. What did she, did she bring like a fucking a fishing knife today? I know. Yeah,

Speaker 7:          00:34:41       but I got a feeling these city council meetings, this is the majority of who shows up. Yeah. Oh, like lunatics because who the fuck goes to these like, yeah, just crazy people with nothing better to do. Right. Like you would, you and I would never have time cause we're too busy leading normal lives. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 15:         00:34:59       Well, you know what I'm supposed to do. I was supposed to give Roger Fire Guard some panties. Got In pink. I won't say what goes with pink. These are for Mickey Esposito. Since everybody's panties getting a wad when I come up here. So send them to her. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:35:13       Wow. I like that she went shopping for this appearance.

Speaker 7:          00:35:16       Yeah. This reminds me of my mom. My mom had a problems with everybody like that. That's, that is she would have um, gone to something like this. Yeah. If my mom had a beef with the city, yes. If that would have been her target of choice versus like my Stepdad and um, a few other things on the Internet. Yeah. I feel like could have like, I kind of wish she had this outlet. Yeah. I feel like this is really good for this one. Do you think your mother would have led out four letter words? Maybe? Yeah. Oh yeah. I'm calling them Edwards and you fucking these up piece of shit. Fuck you. You fucking cunts. She loved to call people. Consequently, I never heard an n word. Really? I only had a few meetings with your money. Yeah. You needed to come around a little more.

Speaker 7:          00:36:00       Oh, really? Went to clean out her apartment. There was a black security guard lady there and I was talking to her and uh, and, and she goes, yeah, I know your mom eat it. He was quite a character. She goes, uh, you know, she was always nice to me. She never called me a nigger and I was like, I'm sorry. She was like, she called other people that but not me. So you know, that is a nice testament to my mother's a manners. Wow. She called her and she called the front desk lady at con. My mom tell, yeah, you dropped a big word, but it was in the context of a story. Yeah. Yeah. This woman's clearly paranoid and angry and yeah, it's pretty great though. She seems together, which is misleading. Right. And like she doesn't look that crazy together. Might be the wrong word. Yeah. She bought panties, toilet paper. And what else? She brought one more thing with her. She had marbles. Marble. Yeah. Yeah. Panties for a man. Pink panties for men. Yes. Yeah. So there's a lot of victimization.

Speaker 15:         00:37:06       Did you see me in a book? Not a porn book either as a Cindy. Okay. I made a lot of money in a book and guess what? My Dad called it dental floss. And guess what I did with it. I put it away for something like this and I made a lot of money. There's a lot of men has that book.

Speaker 7:          00:37:27       Uh, yeah. What she needs to meds. Yeah. She didn't take her shit today. Well, I have not seen, shouldn't take a mets. I'd only seen the first clip before this, but this is the, the clothes. You already see the clothes. Oh, what's her clothes there? I can't imagine it gets better

Speaker 15:         00:37:44       and so you're not in my city. I looks pretty good now. I'm fat as a cow now. Remember I have six buckets, not six boobs. All right.

Speaker 7:          00:37:55       All right. That's it. Yeah. My mom would say things like that too. We were like, wait, what do you mean I have six bucks? Not Six boobs. Fuck you. Fuck. You know what? My mom picked fights with nuns to when I went to Catholic school, fucking bitches. I'm like, okay, you're picking fights with nuts. You're crazy. Yeah. No, I mean, I wish there had been, that was so crazy and it's just, it's too hard to follow because we just really out of her mind, you know, I wish I had a little more focused, like I don't know what she's after. Well, AH, yeah. That's the thing is that when there are that spun out, they're really sick. Citing a thing

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       that could have been like what? Her beat her prime, right? Yeah. Usually it's that someone's out, it sounds like she's thinking that they're all out against her. I think the private investigator stuff, like that's another layer. She, she's being persecuted by all of them. And the concrete company. I got to tell you this, so last night. Yes, sure. So I was in, um, San Jose. Yes. The odd ball tour. Yes. And

Speaker 9:          00:39:00       we ride up from the hotel. It's Swardson, Diaz and I. Right. And they're just driving us. Everybody else has their own trends. You know, people would come different ways. So, but when we want to go back a ds, and I want to go back at intermission is, it's just he and I, so as a driver who works for live nation and Diaz and me as we get in the car, at first we're just talking about this, talking about that. And then, you know, sometimes when you're on particularly longer drives highway drives, there's just moments where it kind of goes quiet and you feel the feel of the highway beneath the, the tires kind of has that rhythm. It's kind of peaceful. Yeah. To do. Yeah. To do at night. You know, you see sometimes you could see stars are like the way that the, the highways lit up. Right. There's kind of a tranquility to it. Yeah. And we hit that moment. There's no radio on, so you're just hearing the truth. I'm staring out the window and that silence lasts about 15 seconds or so. And then Joey goes, I would tell you about the time I saw a guy's stomach

Speaker 3:          00:40:10       put on the tenderloin, 1979 I go, no. And I see the driver's eyes in the rear view. Like he goes like, oh yeah, it was cut open from side to side. Yeah. His blood was brown. It, that's how long he'd had been bleeding out. People just stepped over him. Oh my God, what a fucking up that guy. It was a crazy time. So those days I was like, yeah. And I just keep looking at the driver and he's like, oh yeah, guys stab each other. Starting knife fights other than know what the fuck is going on? Running the other way, guys just stabbing each other crazy shit back then. That's just from a dead silence. Yeah. Joey really has a net for those moments. Yeah, man. It's amazing what a life it is. A magazine had a crazy life, Huh? Yeah. He says a lot of funny shit.

Speaker 3:          00:41:02       So much of it is not even repeatable. Even in the context of our show, I wouldn't be able to set it up. Right, right. Yeah. He's so outrageous. Yeah. He's not even outrageous. It's just like you can't, I don't even know. I don't even know how to prepare someone for it. Hey, literally have to experience it. He's out of his mind. T do you know who McGruff the crime dog is? Course doesn't. Joey Diaz kind of sound like him? Um, I don't remember her bite out of crime. Oh, right. Um, I think, I feel like McGruff the crime dog is Joey Diaz and you be right. Could be,

Speaker 16:         00:41:35       uh, that's Jenny. Jenny's dad. If he could send it that car and maybe the last time you'll see Jenny. Oh my rough. The crime dog. He knows kids every day in his country disappear. Oh my God, I'm running runaway, but a lot are kidnapped by strangers or even by people I know. So. Right. The McGruff and teach our kids to protect themselves. Love the shop by picked up by that I cry. I mean I could, I can hear the

Speaker 3:          00:42:05       molarity for sure. I think, um, I love these ads by the way, that they just terror terrify you. I have a bit about this now in my act about how we raised ourselves in the 80s yeah. And commercials like this. Yeah. Like I, they just scared the shit out of you into compliance and that's the way you should do it. Like, hey kids, you'll get snatched up off your God damn bike. Don't talk to strangers. I think Joey would be a little different than, than the McGruff dog. I think he'd be like, you see this kid over there? I can take that kid if I wanted to. I could get now like yeah, you can just tell you about crimes that he could commit. You want to do more crimes? He's committed before. That'd be [inaudible] guys dealing drugs. I got drugs to eight kids. Yeah. And then Joey will be a great McGraff. Oh yeah. Really, really fantastic. What's his Dad Boehner thing? Dad boners things about abstract painting. Do you know about this? No. What does that mean?

Speaker 5:          00:43:01       Page?

Speaker 3:          00:43:04       What is that? I had, I didn't send that to you. That's terrible. That's horrible. Can you please play the guy, the touch therapy guy? Oh yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:43:13       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:44:27       Of course. Honestly, I don't even want to split the word coddling. What do you like going to name this therapy? I would call it alternative touch, I guess to kind of touch like everybody loves when the, at the salon, they shouldn't pull your hair. Do like that. I like that. Okay.

Speaker 17:         00:44:48       No. So con schedules one cuddle session a week through cuddlist.com $80 an hour. So he has one a week.

Speaker 3:          00:44:57       Then he charges $80 so he makes $8 a week doing this. Is that a ton of money for New York City? There's gotta be more. How many of those people are just dudes that are like, oh look, a cuddle on my mouth. I like alternative touch right around my asshole. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. There's a spot on the back of my ball bag, like some alternative touching too. If you could alternatively use your tongue and then exactly mouth, they'll feel good.

Can you even believe that this nice looking girl has to pay for cuddles? No, she doesn't have to pay for that. She was so thrilled to see him though. I think it's a friend. I think she likes him.

Cause he years of being with you, you've broken me down. How, how you've been saying that for years because it's true. I was a lady before. I mean not totally, but more of a lady. No, I think it was this hot chick. Um, why don't you use the ginger is your favorite. Yeah. Why don't you tell them what's going on? No, I think you should do this one. How come?

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       Because this is your jam. You are so excited. You sent this to me like two weeks ago. A potty mouth Dunnville teacher who slipped into foul territory before facing the new charges. Dunnville secondary school teacher. English teacher, Jennifer Elizabeth Green Johnson allegedly told a student, why don't you lick me where I fart?

Speaker 8:          00:53:50       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:53:53       Why don't you lick me Fart. That is so good to a student. Yeah. That's not that bad. Right? It's not that crazy. Yeah, it is. How old is the kid? Um, I dunno. It's elementary school babe. Yeah. I think my mom told me to do crazy shit like that didn't tell you to lick. You were, you know, she'd be like, go fuck yo smell my farts. Who really not lick me. Yeah. She's say crazy shit to me. Smell my farts. She would say, um, she would fart on me and stuff and she fired in the closet and push me in the closet and stuff like that. Wow. Wow. Your mom didn't do that. Your mom did that. Oh, stop. No Way, man. Lick me where I love the, is this an Ontario and Canada? Hey, my birthplace birthdate. Yeah. According to the, what is it?

Speaker 3:          00:54:40       Brandford expose expositor Green Johnson has been a frequent flyer at the Ontario College of teachers and the Grand Erie district school boards, that disciplinary committees, she's been suspended for 30 days last January for professional misconduct. Among the most recent allegations that data 2015 she slapped a student on the head, called him an idiot, told him to grow some balls. She allegedly called one student, a bloody pedophile, told a female student she looked like a frumpy old lady today. She slammed on her students, has stupid idiots, gay and a bitch. Jesus. She's got a lot of it. Um, so this time, let's see. I feel like we're going to see her at the next city council meeting. Yeah, I feel like she might be a fan of the show. I think she was at that a live show. We didn't Toronto a couple of years ago. She's a mommy. Uh, I think so. Dan Pena is not a mommy. That's really good fans. Um, appears that students aren't terribly fond of her on rate. My teachers, um, most commentators slam her although several are favorable. One comment was awful. Teacher bully to all students. Um, swears that students all the time last. If you don't know the correct answer, very unprofessional. She is the worst than a bully. Immature.

Speaker 3:          00:56:07       I think this is totally unrelated. This, yeah. I'm like, wait, what does this former Ios applied teacher, Mary Beth Haglin famously had sex with one of our students a hundred times. She's, she's not stripping. Um, she's now working at a strip club. Woody's

Speaker 9:          00:56:24       just a few miles from where she taught.

Speaker 7:          00:56:26       Oh that's nice. That's a nice little button to the story. Has nothing to do with this story. I think it's there. What do you think they put that there? Cause they were like, hey, who's this girl and panties anyways, Ligonier, I fart. Really cool. You know what? I do regret that we don't have audio because it could be another kiss my pussy. Right. I suck as it suck my pussy on a bloody day. That was another good one. Yeah. Yeah. Like me where I fart

Speaker 14:         00:56:53       ass.

Speaker 7:          00:56:57       Yeah. But I wish we could get a lick. Me where I fart. I think that's a really neat phrase. It's really cool. It's really cool. Speaking of phrases, oh I'm the patrion show. We were discussing how you and I have used a phrase around this house for like a couple of years now. Yeah. Which is same shit. Different toilet. Right. And we never really do it on why image, but it's in our private lives. We are, well it came from why IMH though? Originally. Yes. And then it, it's, we say it almost daily around the cigarette

Speaker 9:          00:57:31       was interviewing Adrian Broner on Hbo and Boxing Fighting, you know, as a whole UFC even. Yes. Some, sometimes you hear outrageous shit, but boxing especially lets people get away with saying just the dumbest shit. And the most, like they don't have any, I mean, it's kind of a, it is refreshing because you see such a cookie cutter stuff in the four major sports. It's always like we were trying to find our identity and I hate that. So boring loop. It came with it. We did the best we could. It's always the same. This is from that. This is one of the Oh gee clips we played from that. Kellerman Adrian Broner. Yeah.

Speaker 14:         00:58:11       Marco, as it were. Just one of the reasons you are as hot as you are right now. What do you feel about this? Which is after all the followup performance to that masterpiece, you know, same shit. Different toilet

Speaker 7:          00:58:27       chewing gum. That's such a good line. Yeah. Oh, you know, same shit. Different toilet. It's a great line. Yeah. What's this guy's name is Adrian Brody runner. I love that. And I love talking about practice. Those are my two favorite athlete clips. Yeah. Tuck. Talking about practice. Not, not, not, not a Sunday. Those are home run clubs, man. Run Iverson. Allen Iverson. That's right. You finally got his name down after 15 years. Yep. Adrian Broner. Yeah. Yeah. He's a shit different times. He's been on the show a few times, actually. He's done some ridiculous shit to, um, who's the guy that decked out his van with $100,000 worth of like Versace, Louis Vuitton. You're talking about two or 300 guys right now. Not that pacifically. There's one player and then Allen Iverson documentary. Yeah. That he refers to. He's like, oh, that guy is fucking crazy. He decked out his van. Like he bought a fucking van. I Dunno. Maybe it's Allen.

Speaker 9:          00:59:25       That wouldn't be surprising to me. It's not an outrageous claims with me. Gosh, by the way. So I see this here. You know, we just

Speaker 7:          00:59:35       played it. That's your hero. You know that, right? Of course. I know who that is. He and I go way back. We have an intimate relationship.

Speaker 9:          00:59:42       Apparently there is a, uh, a new documentary coming. Oh, all about Rocco. God,

Speaker 7:          00:59:55       I don't think, I don't think I need to know.

Speaker 3:          00:59:59       Very interesting. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:00:01       Uh,

Speaker 7:          01:00:01       he told me some crazy stories. Yeah, he did. Yeah. He and I were talking when you were filming something. I'm serious. Like I was shooting. No, you're doing a Russell Peters presents. That's where I met Rocco behind backstage behind the dumpsters and yeah, in between. Um, now he did tell me some crazy childhood shit. You told me that, which I'd be fascinated to see if it's in this documentary.

Speaker 3:          01:00:33       My mother always dreamed up roadmender like my father or your parents struggling month after about what do you want from life to give him something better. That's what I dropped out. I told myself, you must do something to help your mother or did it. So I used my cock, helped me out. I told myself he'll help me. God.

Speaker 9:          01:00:58       Yeah, there you go. Hmm. Um, so anyway, interesting. There's an article in vice about his, uh, this upcoming film and these, I guess these guys followed him around for pro while they asked him at one point, why do you call your penis the devil between your legs? And he says, uh, because the devil takes your body. It's not you taking him for so many years. I use sex for my convenience when sex is using you, however, that means you are addicted and it's the devil. It's the same if you take drugs or alcohol. All of this is what I call the devil. He makes you do anything he wants. He makes you do things. You don't really enjoy it, but you do them anyway. Um, it said, oh, because we've mentioned this before, it's not the first time he's talked about retiring. Yeah. What happened when you were 40 and you said you'd be working just behind the camera as a director, he said, I tried to retire from my children. I wanted to stop performing in front of the camera. By the time they were teenagers and were ready to have sex themselves, I tried to do things on the other side of the camera in order not to hurt them on the other side. I fucked up so many times. First of all, I hurt myself by stopping. Secondly, I started to go to hookers two or three times a day, so three times a day, hooker, hooker, hooker, because I was used to having so much sex. Wow.

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       So then he went back to performing for us. It's got a real problem. Yeah. It sounds like he's got an addiction a little bit. Um, this is something that I wanted to, uh, show to you because it's, um, yeah, it looks like we have a picture of the poop pile. Uh, possible file ladder. See?

Speaker 7:          01:02:43       Yeah, I saw that. Come in. Let me see the top of it. Is that what that looks like?

Speaker 3:          01:02:48       It was similar to that. It was similar to that. Okay. I just want to show if you're, see there's the steps up here. See the way that we had it, few steps were nailed to the tree themselves. And then how so how did you shut off the steps then? You, you didn't set up the steps. There was a ledge like this off the side once you climbed up high enough so that you would face the tree and your ass would hang out the other way. Sure.

Speaker 7:          01:03:12       You know what's funny is that in all the years I've known you a, I've never seen you climb steps up a tree you, that's like worse for the last, I'm saying that you're not a climbing agile person. It's not your stairs to climb up anything and Shit to do anything. It has everything to do with it. Cause if, especially if we're taking a dump, you really gotta be committed. Anyways, I got this interesting email from the poop pile. The poop pile itself emailed us. What did it say? It says, Dear Tina, I exist. Fuck you.

Speaker 3:          01:03:46       Love poop pile. See

Speaker 7:          01:03:50       I guess I guess you're right.

Speaker 3:          01:03:52       Yeah, yeah. I guess the poo piles it real. Yeah. See he emailed you the guy speaking of gross things, we got an email that says, hey mommy's, I just wanted to ride to say I just got done licking my first asshole and it was pretty, pretty amazing. I've been dating this girl for a few weeks and decided I would steal her heart by um, by eating her ass. Yeah. We talked about it over text and she was totally excited. I was extremely hesitant at first as I've heard Tina's thoughts on poop coming out and all that jazz. Yeah. But she doesn't even hydrate properly. So what would you be not about eating? Yes, they go hand and hand. Alright, so overcoming my fears of the stinky abyss. All I asked was that she shower right before and then came the fun. I had her face down, ass up and I just went for it. I was pleasantly surprised of the silky feeling. It gave my tongue and was even more surprised. There was not a shitty taste or smell. I won't bore you with my technique as I'm an amateur currently. Overall I would rate it 10 out of 10. She loved it and I have to say I enjoyed it also. I highly recommend Tina. Give it a try to Tom. Yes. No Way. Your power from Salt Lake City, Utah Johnson. No thanks. Thank you Johnson. And yes, Christina, hopefully this, uh, makes you think, first of all, you

Speaker 7:          01:05:18       would have to have your butthole totally waxed. Like baby soft. Yeah. And then you would have to have it steam cleaned, steam cleaned. What's that like? You were seen on like the Braxton's they went to get their vaginas steamed. Yeah. I want you to go get your butthole steamed so that it was thoroughly clean and then maybe I would do it. Your shits are fucking nasty. You love town the other day and you left streaks in the toilet that I couldn't even believe how many it was. It was light brown, like real diarrhea. Well, I'm not going to do that right before I go, you know, before you go to tab your lunch, I'm going to clean it up. You know when you have your lunch too. When's your um, colonoscopy. I have to change it again. I do

Speaker 7:          01:06:07       because of a gig though. I'm gigging man. I'm gigging Bro. I am though. It's interesting bro. I'm Gagan for real. Uh Huh. All right, so how long are we going to put this off? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. How long are we going to put this off? I need a new day. A new day. Oh Jesus. This doesn't look real. This is out of habit. Tantric Orgasm all by herself to throw off, bring them into your being and he looks like Baloney. Have we played this guy before? The rest take care of itself? No. I'll show you how it was. Remember, I feel like we have,

Speaker 7:          01:06:39       yeah, cause the guy just breeds, I remember this and then he like goes, well maybe it was audio back in the day. Video. I remember a guy like, looks like he's no chest hair. I'm going to fucking puke. I hate why it's turned on. It's like watching a guide jacket. I don't want to watch her. Oh, it's great. Look at them. I'm going to throw up. I just don't like it, but I want to know who's not teaching me. He just watching some guy imaginary. I want to, I want the lesson. Well, it's like a wet dream. Yeah. It's all in the mind, right? Yeah. Oh look how hard he's coming.

Speaker 11:         01:07:21       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:07:22       Thanks for making wine.

Speaker 11:         01:07:26       Uh,

Speaker 7:          01:07:28       some tight jeans on there. You have it under one minute, but here's the, I don't want to see anymore. Oh man, I don't need anyone. I don't want to see him in speedos either knowing it. I'm trying to get out of it. I want to see his erection. Here's he had a boner. Better tantric orgasm and under one. Does he have a boner first? Get a little high. The guy did a couple of minutes ago so he's out. Sit back. But he's not teaching us. Hello? Somebody you want to pull into your energy field. Okay. I can't, I can't do it. You went over number one. One comment. Somebody hand me a trash can so I can barf. I don't want to hear him coming. Can you not? My friend today is master shake. Oh yeah. I don't want to hear it

Speaker 11:         01:08:21       bro. Bro.

Speaker 7:          01:08:28       Can't do it out of this one. All right. Okay. That's just grow. I hate hearing dudes do nasty shit like this. Yeah, he's a nasty. Why you gotta you gotta be so nap time. Why? Why you gotta be some nasty. Can I read you an email? We got of course, but I need you to really pay attention. Your focus is very important. Sunday. All right, let's do it. This might be the most interesting email we have ever gotten. Are you ready? Yes. No, you have to listen. It's very interesting. Okay. Hi, Mommy's. Do you think if a human eight only dog food right and or wet, that their shifts would start to smell like dog shit. And you know that very distinct dog shit smell.

Speaker 11:         01:09:13       Yes.

Speaker 7:          01:09:14       What an interesting, interesting topic. This might be the dumbest email we've ever gotten, but I like it. It's really dumb. So dumb. But I like it. Okay, so that was down. But listen to this part. This part is not dumb. It really does give me pause. Okay. Okay. Also, why is it that animals don't need to wipe after browning? Why doesn't brown stay on? They're buttholes like it would ours if we don't want. Hmm. We maybe we need to call in Brown lock to investigate. I would love to hear your expert Brown opinions. Well, you know, I haven't, I haven't a couple of thoughts. Love you, Jen. Thank you. Jen. What an interesting question. First of all, thought provoking. Couple of things. If we just eat dog food dry and wet, it will smell like dog should I think. I do think so. Yes. So you think?

Speaker 7:          01:10:11       Yes, it would see using his dog food. The legs, the dog shit smell like dog shit. Well, why don't we try and experiment? Why don't you do it for a couple of days? I'm traveling a bunch, but your home, what? Just try it. Try it for like three or four days. You could eat a little bit of dog food. I smell Betsey's every morning at her. Smells horrendous. But FIV has a nice wet food. His smells real good. Would you eat it for a few days? Chicken gravy. We need it for a couple of days. I could. I want to try it as an experiment and then you should try the, other than that, no carb thing. It's perfect. The other thing, I'm sure there's carbs in there. Not In the wet food that Fifi. It's this chicken. Well the other thing is, um, what was the other question? Oh yeah, so it's a white paper.

Speaker 7:          01:11:00       I think that part of it is they squat so deeply when they should. Oh, like squatty potty. Yeah. If we start, if we started chatting with one of those and squatting down more, like the way you were meant to actually poop, I think there'd be less to clean up. That's really, really interesting. Answers. Tell him. Yeah. I think number one, that means really onto something. Number one, it's not the food that dictates the dog shit smell because dogs get into trash and they, they eat people's food and they're shit still smells like dog shit. I think it's the bacteria in their guts. Number two, uh, sometimes it gets stuck in there for like Betsey's had shit stuck to her for. I think it's cause there's no hair around the right thing. We need you to do the dog food thing to get a real answer because we're just both, we're just spinning our wheels where you give it a shot for us for the show.

Speaker 7:          01:11:50       Of course. I'm going to start right after this show. A lot of people listen to this show. Do you want me to eat the kibble? Betsey's kibble. She hasn't. She's on a special design. You're repulsed by it. So why don't you start with wet food just to get into like the flow and maybe day two you get into some dry food. If he's got some nice wet, it does smell good. His smells like Chinese food kinda. It smells like a Moo Shu chicken. It's good. You should try it. You should try it. I just lick my fingers after I opened the gate. Know there's no smell worse on your dog's back before, right? Yeah. Come on. Milk bone and the heart treat. It's not good. It's not good. It's like a cracker. That's my good is not good. Have you tried this or this? So foreign it does.

Speaker 7:          01:12:35       No good. It's no good. Have you tried it? Oh, um, no. I've never tried one. Oh, it just tastes earthy. Shitty. Their, their, their taste buds are not advanced like ours where people and where people, we like people. Yeah, I agree. I totally think we're people too. Um, wait, what did you eat dog food for a week so we can do this? No, because you're the one that's got to do it. Okay. Would you rather? Hello? Would you rather eat FIFO? Is Dog food for one day or I take you to the dog park and that's where you shit all times. All Times you have to shit. You have to shut like a dog in the dog park with the other dogs. You got a squat and then I come around with like a plastic Baggie. Each one to experiments. No, I mean one day of dog food versus one week of shedding the one week because it has the stakes have to be Sam to dog food will make you sick.

Speaker 7:          01:13:40       I don't want to make you sick for a whole week, but I would him humiliate you for one. Why would you want to do that? Cause painless. Humiliation dies emotionally painful. All stop. You'll see your shrink. You'll be fine. What is wrong with you? He'll be fine. So what do you choose? Dog? Shit. What would you choose versus one day of eating fiefs would you do I need fiefs food. It smells nice. It's got that gravy to it. You would vomit. I will record you vomiting and play it back to wait, but isn't it people you could eat it. It's like poor quality means you can't eat anything. Did you know that? Like you don't have to but you can. But I'm saying that how far off from, I mean there's some dirt outside, you can't eat it. How far off of from people's food is dog food? Really? It's off. Not The nice canned stuff that we give fif that's off the kibble. Forget it. But that gravy stuff, it's nice try by Scott [inaudible] for the show. No one bite. No. Why? No, it's got peas and carrots. No, no, but you're saying it's not that Michelle. Yeah, just for the show. Will you give me, what do you want me to give you?

Speaker 7:          01:14:55       Can I think about it? How about let's make it happen and I just take a taste. But how big of it to is the Lupus, but you cannot today though. But you can't just do, in other words, there's the, the liquidy kind of part. You can't just do that. You got to get it signed out. Like, okay. Like, like I'm a veggie chunk. Can I not eat the meat part? Okay, that's fair. Well, you buy me this, uh, this ring I was looking at.

Speaker 7:          01:15:22       Okay. It's not that expensive. All right. It's like, it's like a hundred bucks. Sure. All right. Good deal. I'll try the dog food. When can we have this experiments episode? We'll try it on the show. Oh yeah. Okay. Yeah, absolutely. You just made a commitment. I know. Okay. Um, I'm going to, I have to prepare myself emotionally for it. All right. I'm really, really happy that you're just doing this. Do you think it will make my brown smell? I think it's too little. I think if you eat the whole can and it would make it smell though. Yeah. What if it's really good and you just go to town on it? What's the song that came in? They sent me, I haven't listened to it. I couldn't download it on my iPhone. Try it. You want to call it out? Let's see if it's any good.

I said she doesn't have the stamina stand them up. I don't believe she does have the stamina to be president of this country. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:20:29       that's ty berry. So a couple of people and we actually have a couple more. It's not that then. Oh, I love it.

Speaker 3:          01:21:23       He knows names are dummies. What's your Pronoun Right now? Quick. Your Highness, Your Majesty, Your Highness. Was that a university? This is big and college is now. So what happens is when a student, when a student signs on for a, you know, a new semester classes, you know everything, a lot of it is electronic today, right? A professor emails his class. So now when you see those sign offs, the signature of the professor has their pronouns. They allow students to email in their pronouns. A University of Michigan did like a whole campus wide thing where to be inclusive, name your Pronoun also as you can name anything. One of the students there did, um, your highness and he said it was to point out the absurdity of being able to imagine a teacher having to memorize everybody's Pronoun and if they fluctuate every day. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:22:23       How has that have that professor supposed to know? Yeah, I agree. Um, we've got, uh, somebody wanted us to rate their jeans. Oh yeah. I like this game. If there's deer mountain has, I have a couple pair of denim jeans that I've had for about six years wearing jeans nearly every day. At this point. They have worn to the point they have gotten lighter. Some have phrase on the bottom. What is your opinion on denim that has gotten lighter from age? It is not very light, but it's definitely not dark now where I live, or at least in my childhood home, the darker jeans were worn by dads. It was always dark jeans with nowhere tear, nearly new looking and the bottom hem, the fat, two or three inches above the shoot. I know exactly what he's talking about. So for me these Lijing seemed more appropriate. I have attached pictures. Yeah, for reference. I know exactly the type of, they're like, just remember this

Speaker 22:         01:23:24       and I know you think everything has to do with genes. Well, I've been on all, I know a lot of billionaires and to the best of my knowledge, I never saw one wearing a fucking pair of jeans

Speaker 3:          01:23:36       just to remind you. Um, okay, so here are, oh Lord, here are his jeans. Oh, get your life. No Bill. Bill. No, no, no. That's it. That is a no, right Tommy, those are two knows the one you got on the one you're holding. Um, no. I mean the ones you're holding, those are bad. I know what you're saying. I just think you need that. You said two and six years, men, why don't you just get rid of these? I know the dad jeans you're talking about, you know what the other thing you're, but you left out those dark dad jeans are real thick and they look terrible. Like they're cuffed too high. Right? Like you said, they get them hemmed like above the shoe to get them hemmed above the shoe. How dads do it if they official dads. But I'm saying he should get a darker wash.

Speaker 3:          01:24:28       Yeah. But have it tailored to fit for your sneakers so that it's like perfect course to don't don't, I mean there's a, there's a light Jean, the kind of works, but you know these are too loose or too baggy fitted, right? Yeah. They're not fitted and I don't think this color is good. Just don't, I think it's too, it's too light. I tell you, I got a pair of light denim recently from lucky works. A Little Maggie's nineties style jeans. Yeah. So, but you know, it's questionable. I kinda, I like them. No, they work. I think for dudes, darker is the way I feel like I want to take this dude shopping and now where do you live? I'll go to the mall with you, Jeff. I'll go get you. I'll, I'll buy jeans with you if I'm in new your city. Yeah. I don't like these.
