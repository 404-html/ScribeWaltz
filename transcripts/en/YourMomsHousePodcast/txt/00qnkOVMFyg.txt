Speaker 1:          00:07:06       [inaudible] those guys. I came over that

Speaker 5:          00:07:49       we went on a weekend getaway with baby jeans. Oof. Yeah. Not, nothing funner. More fun than travel with an eight month old. She's a staycation. Jesus Christ. Yeah. Yeah. We, we drove there, but um, it's, you would, you would get me a glass of penal grease every night and every day you always do this. Whenever I go like I want to go get something, you go. Wouldn't it be crazy if you said you were going to the bar but you were really just going to meet someone. I was like, like a guy in the bushes and you're like, well yeah because what if that that's really what's going on. If that's a crazy scenario. I know I am crazy by the way are also a real serial killer because she laughed maniacally at the thought of killing a squirrel. That was so funny. I was like I only as much.

Speaker 5:          00:08:44       It was like no cause you were like, cause there was a, it wasn't a scrolls, a rabbit. The rabbit that's, we were sitting outside and we saw it. Adorable little rabbit just stayed there and stayed there and eating and you're like, how would I kill that? And I go, you probably should snap it's neck, trap it and then snap it's neck. And I was like, no trap a rabbit. Just sure. No, because at first I go, what should I go? I wish I had a 22 so I could to bed too much. Fire Him. No. For a rabbit that's true. Is a fucking BB gun to kill a rabbit. Well, I mean the 22 is not much more than that. That's my point. So I go at 22 and I was like, Oh, I wish I had a rock right now. Then I started just laugh, just imagining my mother being there because I was upset. She would be like, you have a rock to kill us. And also to ask her, do you have a rock? Like here's a thinking of the dumbest ways to kill that, Randy. Like first of all, why would you kill the rabbit meat? There's not a lot of meat. It's like eating a pigeon. But what made you laugh the most was the idea of throwing a rock to stun the rabbit and then running over there and snapping. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:09:49       Was like, I'm crazy. I'm a maniac. Yeah. But that's why I laugh at that stuff. Like that guy talking about, see that's Henry Portrait of a serial killer,

Speaker 5:          00:10:12       but that wasn't a, that was a person's neck. It's a movie. It's not real guy. He's with the hooker and he gets it. And then the guy goes

Speaker 8:          00:10:22       Henry, because he just snapped.

Speaker 5:          00:10:29       You don't want to snap a rabbit's neck. Let's pull up that, you know for fuck's sake. No. To, what about your grandma here? Oh yeah. We'll get to her in a scene. What it is fucked up to even thinking about killing a rabbit. There's no reason the meat's not that good. You gotta be real desperate to kill a rabbit. Jeez. And then, and then we ordered room service for breakfast and then we didn't, we forgot to have them clear it and we ate outside. So there was all our food outside and then we're sitting out there and we saw our raccoons coming and we're like, oh, these motherfuckers are going to eat all our food. And then we came back. It was gone. It was like shitty hard potatoes and stuff. Where's the funny scene? What's growing potatoes that the rabbit too. It ate it and liked it. Is this the scene here now for we don't know. Yeah, here we go. Oh, I just got it. It's the funny,

Speaker 8:          00:11:22       it's not funny. It's the funniest fucking thing ever.

Speaker 5:          00:11:27       So at Henry's in here, go with his buddy and they each have a hooker. Tell me that his friend's reaction isn't fun. Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:11:40       [inaudible] what's going on? Oh, that we're going to keep her quiet. What is snaps her neck? You don't think it's funny

Speaker 5:          00:12:13       what? Rabid person? Killing a heart. A little cute rabbits to me is just, it's hilarious cause you outweigh it and you're so much bigger than was. Yeah. There's no reason to like snap his neck. I'd rather snap 20 hookers. Not Correct. But then a rabbit I would too. They're so cute. Rabbits were super cute. Okay. Does grow on trees, right? Yeah. Right. Yeah. Are you with me? Hi You. Where are you with me?

Speaker 8:          00:12:39       Oh

Speaker 5:          00:12:41       anyways, so my grandma, we opened with a clip of her doing her thing and stuff like that. And um, I'm here. She is, she's great. She is great. Um, so this is like, cause this is always the thing you didn't know, but remember when you first sent out as a kid and not even as a kid, I think it's a little bit older. You hear about sex lines and then I never actually called one. I just heard recordings of them, you know, like, cause they're super expensive. Yeah. It's like, I once had a roommate in college. We lived with one guy and it was like four of us girls and we all went for Christmas vacation and he stayed behind. We came home, he spent $600, no phone, sex, phone, sex. And he paid it. But we were like, really? Dude, really? It's a lot.

Speaker 5:          00:13:24       It's a lot. But back in the late nineties, that's how you, you jacked it was that or print. And then you find out that there's call centers and that nobody would you speak to ever. It looks like what you think they look like. That was the big rub about these. So they have a, yeah, this, she looks like Mrs Kuhner is my first grade teacher. That is Mrs [inaudible] didn't look so good. Why don't you just drive her? Yeah. Uh, well, number one, there's definitely teeth missing. I don't think she has any. Yeah, she's got the big Ted Bundy glasses from the fuzzy glass. They have big glasses. Oh. Um, no Stevie, maybe Stevie. Stevie, definitely the glasses and then like a real feminine kind of cool haircut. Soccer player. Yeah. Tennis player, haircut. They kind of the kind of cut that says it's shut down. I would say it's really shut down. Don't touch my vagina. Soccer, tennis player. Russia. Sirica 87 88 yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:14:23       Santana, sweetie. Bye. Hey Baby.

Speaker 5:          00:14:28       Yeah, so this is kind of stepping in her. Well it looks like she does it from her home and that she checks in with the car like so they patch her in and then calls are routed to her. You know what a cool job I think you make.

Speaker 7:          00:14:43       Hi, it's me. I'm getting ready to launch the APP. Okay, thanks. Well now this is web cam from bitch. That was bitch. Are you? Are

Speaker 9:          00:14:51       you touching that? If right now,

Speaker 5:          00:14:54       I mean look at this right here. Imagine this is what you're jacking off to. Yeah. Oh, this is what my grandma used to urinate in this bed pan. I don't even, that's a bed pan that, you know what? That was so traumatizing me. You told me that. That I've actually blocked it out. Yeah. Why wouldn't you walk over to the toilet? Because this is old country. This is, this is how they did it back in the old country. Yeah. But during the day, she saw how awesome the toilet was. Right. But at night the thinking is, I'm so tired. I don't want to lose my sleepiness by getting up and going to the toilet. Oh, I just put the pad next to me. I piss in the pot. Wait, what's, tell me like the real mechanics of it though, is it on the floor? She kept it under the bed, so she would like urinate in it, but I mean, in the middle of the night.

Speaker 5:          00:15:39       And so what would share the bed? So let's say she gets, she would stand up obviously. Yeah. And then you just squat down. I'm guessing. I never, I never slept next to her, so I don't know. But she liked the bed pad and then she would dump it. My Dad would just beg her to stop doing it and she, she wouldn't, she sold school. But that, that, that does look like a bedpan. Yeah. Yep. She's just, you know, she looks like, to me it's just looks like, uh, I mean, and I apologize for ever this offense. There's like a white trash piece of shit she loves. She has that to get that real scumbag smoker. Smokers looked to her like really? You know, really just really looks like shit. There's no real like, you know how Chloe Savini seven Yay. Can play white trash. Perfect Sol in bloodline, right? Like she's such trailer trash and then she kind of looks like bloodline. It's Chloe's mother like she's, yes. Just the eggs. The exemplary piece of shit. Like trashing. Yeah. This lady has got, if you were an actor should get an award. That's right. He's really looking like it. Right.

Speaker 9:          00:16:49       She's not here. God Damn fucking asshole. If you're pressing oh boy. Yeah. I want to take this God damn fucking Dick and I'm going to read it straight up tomorrow. Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:17:00       Wow. I bet she got a lot of guys off back in her. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's some dude isn't, can you know what I like about this though? She is a vet. You can tell. She knows like if you're comfortable enough to be describing drinking coffee. Drinking coffee. Yeah, laying back. She's reclining in her house. She's not nervous. It's just got the bad parent next door. She knows that. Oh, this is old school. Yeah,

Speaker 9:          00:17:19       15 years. Funny Shit. She's doing jigsaw puzzle right now. I'll tell you one thing for God damn fucking shirt that you can know, like that guy gave him fucking shit. That's our, we'll have you suck his dick.

Speaker 5:          00:17:32       I love her. She pretty great. It's her name. Do we have a name or

Speaker 7:          00:17:36       hey inches long. Oh my. She's knitting. Yes. Oh No, I don't think I should catch it plays all the different, I know she's a sweet grand and a shower and that's about it. No, I didn't have, he would have my things right before another camp. Campex not nap. If you don't meet my back door here,

Speaker 5:          00:18:02       she can play submissive or she can be, this is a real talent. I mean, I could never do this. It's probably depends on the call. Right? Right away. She knows if it's from this number of that line, like the dom, the missive, the granted that call like I'm logging in. They're probably like, this is a dollar number. Right. When she's like, you're assholes, your pussy and like I'm going to fuck you in it know. It's so fascinating. Now do you think that they gave her scripts and then she memorized? Probably back in the day somebody was like, how this is how you do it when she started back in the 20s now just note back on the Oud phonograph or are you coming? Are you coming? Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:18:51       Yeah. I tell you one thing for sure baby. I wish she were here right now so you could see me. I think that Pussy Lips, this got me pretty worked up getting me all wet.

Speaker 5:          00:19:04       His eyebrows either. It's troubling now. She has no eyebrows. It's rather there. Is that a choice or covered by the glass? The glass glass or a large, yeah, it's really hot. Crazy neck too. Interesting a lot. But if you were desperate, this would be 100% option for funding to pay bills. And they were like, just talk to people and talk shit. I tell you what, I think this is way more dignified than that thing we saw. That was just an ass with the two holes in it. Remember that plastic guy showed us where he reviewed it and you fuck fucking in here. You put it all together, clean out the chamber is and you're like, Whoa, wait, what do you mean more dignified? Dignified on whose end? The man. Oh, I mean I'd rather you call it if it was you, let's say. Yeah, I'd be like, please call granny.

Speaker 5:          00:19:53       Versus like us having to conceal this look at her and still call. I mean there's no percentage, but you mean just call phone sex people. That's just more dignified. Why, why versus fucking that thing. Fucking that thing. Okay, so here's the thing. All it is, but that thing we're discussing, it's like a woman's ass and her thigh. So it's like a chopped up women, which you like already. I know this is fun. And then it's an asshole and a vagina and there's clean up. So where are you going to clean that? You're going to put that in the dishwasher with all the other crap. I guess you could leave it in the shower and the shower. So when I'm showering I'm going to fucking step on your girlfriend. Well I mean I could, I could matter to the wall or something. That's disgusting. It's so undignified. So people understand it's a, it's a toy to sex toys like a fleshlight, but it's actually sculpted to look like a woman's ass bitch. And it's called, I think it's called like fuck my ass or something. Yeah. And then they made a black one so he knows where the fuck my big black ass. And the guy was looking at the difference between the fuck my ass in the fuck. My big black ass. It's just color tone.

Speaker 5:          00:21:05       Well, I mean I'm all for like the flashlight. I think that's more dignified than the asshole cut up. It looks weird and look at it. Keep it under the bed, like your mom's bed pan. And then where do you keep it? We've got a kid. How are you going to conceal that thing? You know, walk in and he's just like fingering boat. It's a neat toy. My buddy. And most people don't do that until they're much older.

Speaker 1:          00:21:27       Oh yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:21:32       That him and I do it together. We're tag teaming it like which told you want pal? I think. I think for me, just the cleanup sounds disgusting. Whatever. One of those things. Yeah. How the fuck do you clean out something? You just didn't like that he said you just, they're connected. So you flushed with water and the one guy's going to do that. No, I, I imagine a lot of loads stay in there. Yeah, of course. Just the coagulated mess that is pretty raw. Yeah, I did imagine sharing it with nut, like sharing it. You're all just like, Bro, just happening right now.

Speaker 5:          00:22:10       Come due. There's dude sharing one of those things right now. They're probably already, you have to share it. Fleshlight right out there are 100% gnarly. It's normally when you see it in the movies. What do you mean? In the movies? There's movies where guys share flashlights not flesh. I probably, they're probably, yes, the probably are movies that share that, but there's movies where they share women, they'll dump inside to get a little more natural. To me it's more natural, but it's kind of grody. Right. It's not cool. I don't know. Like a guy finishes and then another guy goes right in there and he's like, ah. And then another guy and another guy. Yeah. It's a lot of com. That is a lot of time and that's a real, that's pretty gnarly. Like you're super green, you're in a special class after that, you're in a very, uh, does that excite you at all though? That idea,

Speaker 5:          00:23:11       having a just miscellaneous loads in me. Yeah, of course. Of course. The more the merrier. Right. I picture a lot of guys kind of waiting behind us a lot of times, you know, excuse me, picture like 20 guys waiting their turn, you know, I don't know. That's not a thing. I can't wrap my brain around to think for me. I really, because I never even had like one night stands because of that because I don't, I don't like the idea of just some, some stranger ejaculating. You picture like a prison group though. Not like, oh, I guess like duct tape, duct tapes back there. He's talking a lot of shit. Stevie and yeah, yeah, yeah. Areas has turned. It's duct tapes. Yeah. Who's up next? All right man. Go ahead.

I wonder if I can dare just no insertion this video. Thank God there was an assertion with grandma this a night. This is pretty intense. Okay. Um, I'm trying to see if I can play any of it, but how about just the audio? Okay. I don't need to see it cause anyone else. Yeah, I think I would be really heavy on the porn today. It's very porny today. Yeah. Yeah. Let's, uh, maybe we should maybe not listen out loud

No one's doing it anymore, so it's good to have somebody who's committed to the game. Um, poor guy. It looks like he's just as committed and aggressive as ever. His films, I don't like that. He's so rough sometimes. He's got a big hog on him. I like his attitude. I like his enthusiasm. You know, he married a Hungarian lady, Kevin with that. Yeah. I mean, is that Your Hall Pass Guy?

She's too much plastic surgery, but she didn't need, plus she was perfect before. She did not need that. She looked like somebody actually drew her and she was pretty weird. Um, Charlise tear on.

Speaker 1:          00:33:07       man.

Speaker 5:          00:33:08       Yeah. I just, I wonder,

Speaker 1:          00:33:10       okay.

Speaker 5:          00:33:11       I mean I have, we've asked this question before when we had jewels, Ventura in here, how it affects your personal life. Like you fuck for a living and then you come home and doesn't that kind of ruin it for you and you're just, you know, it's like Cami, you and I don't watch sitcoms. We don't watch comedies cause that's what you do for a living. You've pride rather vomit than watch. I agree. So who knows?

Speaker 4:          00:33:32       They have member at the uh, um, take a joke. What's it called? Can we take a joke and we take a drug from here, the guy who I was like, oh, that guy

Speaker 5:          00:33:43       who asked the question. Yeah, that's him. Oh. So we did a Q and a for, can we take a joke premiere? And this guy had a question for me. I guess what the for us, look what he found it. He's the founder of evil angel. He had a second amendment question. Yeah. Oh, that's so interesting. And I'm not a huge fan of evil as a brand. I'm just not interested in like [inaudible] crap. Oh he's, he's also known as black man. It says, oh, I know, but man, the button man, I'm thinking of Fart man. Nevermind. Well he did for him. He,

Speaker 4:          00:34:16       he also used to, I guess employee are good. Betty Yoshi. That's right. Who's been on your lot and Yoshi does not like them anymore for sure. Oh God, no. Well, here's, here's why he's so big on that. In the end, 2008, he was indicted on federal obscenity charges, um, by a federal grand jury in DC. Hmm. And he launched a website then all about, you know, that and then a federal trial began with him as a defendant, but all charges were dismissed. So he's a very, um, you know, proac

Speaker 5:          00:34:44       he's, he's really at the center of all that kind of exactly. Debate. Wow. So yeah, he was, he was at that premiere. Wow. I know. Cause right away it's interesting how you know who the, the famous porno people immediately, you're like, I know that guy. He's in Cornell. Yeah, of course you do. He's behind. He's an owner though. Yeah. But that guy is so he does a lot of press. He does interviews all the time. He's not a performer. I pro stock performer by stone. Oh yeah. He can get hot anywhere. That's what Yoshi upset it. But what about him? But I tried to bait him in to that. The guy is like, he can get hot and wet as this big thing. Yeah. That guy can fucking any condition and strong performer. That's what they're always looking for. [inaudible] it's hot out. That's it. Get hard. It's hard, I guess. Yeah. I mean difficult. We should say it like that is probably the most difficult thing. Yeah. Cause you have to block out all the other stuff. The cameras, the lighting pressure to come.

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       Okay now come like that's, that is a talent that is really a talent Molly. Wow. Things got really dirty today. Yeah. I that happened dad. It's your fault. My fault. You open with that. No, I did an old lady. I love that lady. She was a sweet lady. Um, this kid, have you seen this? I wanted to show you this, this kid. Well actually I want to tell the story first about, about, um, cause this happens sometimes. What happened when I went to the bar last night. So that did, yeah. Before I met that dude. So this guy, uh, I walked up to the bar and he goes, hey, I know you and I go, yeah. And so I got to tell you, I never want to presume that somebody like that definitely knows who I am. Like I don't think like that. Like this guy probably really does know me.

Speaker 4:          00:36:32       Cause sometimes people don't know you and they think they know you. Right. But still, this dude was adamant that he knew me. Right. So he goes, I definitely recognize, you know, it was, it was funnier than that though. He goes, I definitely recognize you. And I go, yeah. And he goes, where do I know you from? And I said, I don't know, because I don't want to assume that it's what I think, you know, and you can't be a Douche bag and be like, have, I'm a famous comedian. No, it's so gay. So it is, and you, it would program. Sorry. It was, yeah, you shouldn't say that. You're so non-binary. So he goes, um, he goes, did you play college football? I got like such an erection. I wish that's what you knew me from. You know, it was like, God, why can't that be true?

Speaker 4:          00:37:16       So I go like, world's biggest cock. And I know he was called trouble. And I go, no. And he goes, did I paint your hot rod? And I go, no. And he goes, did I pave your driveway? I go, oopsie yeah. I'm like, no, sir. And he goes, uh, we play the poker league together. Nope. Very colorful life. And he goes, are you a marine? And I go, no. He goes, shit man thought was one of those five. I guess not. Yeah, I'm pretty amazed. And then I, I still didn't go, well I'll volunteer. What I think he goes, he just stayed there and he goes, God, I fucking recognize you. And I go, no man, that's, that's, I, I don't, he goes and have you ever been down to like you spend a lot of time in Long Beach? And I go, no. And I saw it like that. He was really trying and obviously he tried all those, you know, that his different guesses. So then I kind of go like, cause sometimes you just go like, all right, and you just walk. I go, I go, all right. He, cause he kept looking at me. I go, uh, I don't know. Did you have to have Netflix? And he goes, yeah. I go, well I have, uh, a couple, uh, stand up specials on Netflix. And he goes, Nah, that's not it.

Speaker 5:          00:38:37       I go, okay. He goes, it's gotta be something else. I go, I mean, I guess it could be something else, but that would be the biggest exposure I've ever had. Nobody believes you when you tell them where they know you from for the longest time. But I know you and I'm like, it's from road rules 1999 that's not it. I'm like, Eh, it trust me. I know we didn't go to high school together as soon as I said that. And he goes, that's not, he goes, I go, you sure? And he goes, I've met you personally. And then I go, then probably the Marine Corps.

Speaker 5:          00:39:08       I wish you guys did go to. And then did you blow him behind the Bush or after? After that 21 minutes. Yeah, we pounded some booze. I got blackout and you know, anyways, there's to do that on the down low on family vacations. They, naughty boys do that. They cruise and they look for other dudes. Yup. To blow. And then they blow him. Really? Naughty boys really dad it out. We went to the pool, we took our little jeans to a swimming pool. I'm going to post the picture on Instagram. Um, it's so funny you put sunblock on your face but you forgot to do under your eyes. So it, it was like caked on white, white, white, and then just your eyes and your under eye circles were like perfectly cut out of it. Like you look like a raccoon and you're such a dad and that was so white and creamy.

Speaker 5:          00:40:01       Like you hadn't even rubbed it in and all it can even try soundbites. Sankin burned bad. I want to get a burn. Uh, so cute. It's so hot out. How can you, but you didn't think to like rub it in and that's how far I rubbed it in to that level. Yeah, I didn't care. That's what happens when you're a kid. You don't care. Yeah. And then I feel like you should acknowledge me for my fart. God, there was so obscene that you did that. I mean, there was so many nice people just enjoying their day. Christina walks up and she just goes like, it's like five feet from these people at the, they're eating lunch by the pool and I'm like, he's us. And she's like, well, fucking deal with it. Did not say, well, deal with it. She goes, smelter, bat like that, and I was like, Whoa, no, I blamed it on you.

Speaker 5:          00:41:01       I went, Tom. Yeah, Dad. It was really not cool. It was really gross and I was wearing a wet bathing suit, so it had that special kind of snap to it. Little pop. He did it twice. Then another one, I know you did it this morning too, right? I've been fighting a lot, but whenever I eat in restaurants and I eat a lot of meats at restaurants, I flirt. Yeah, it's pretty neat. You don't see it all the time, but then sometimes you do. What was that stupid movie you were watching last night? Oh my God.

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       First of all, for the guys that I meet out in the, in the parks and in the, just wanted to show this. Oh, the Senate certainly can bring about a censure resolution and it's a slap on the wrist. It's a bad boy. Bill Clinton. You're a naughty boy. The American people already know that Bill Clinton is a bad boy. A naughty boy. I'm going to speak out for the citizens of my state who in the majority think that Bill Clinton is probably even a nasty, bad naughty boy. It's the weirdest, the greatest thing ever. And then of course, he famously was trying to get a B Jessel's in the Minneapolis airport and he was arrested Bj's, Bj's, blowjob. Yes. So he was tapping his foot under the stone. That's him. Disgraced senator. Yeah. Yeah. That's what they say. Those who call out the other ones or I like, oh, and here's the two pastors that do it. It's the worst. They're always like that. Ted Haggard was homophobic, hating the gaze, and then he was doing the same shit.

Speaker 4:          00:42:44       I watched 13 hours last night, or most of it, I think that's what it's called. It sounded like it's equivalent of a chick flick for dudes where it's all just like talk and macho. It's about a horrific and terrible thing. You know, it's the, the attack on the, um, on Bengazi, right. The, the, the attack that happened in 2012 a bunch of people died. Embassy, right? Yeah. Um, and I hate it. Didn't do well. Uh, it was bad. It was, it was weird thing was they took this real story, but they laid a blueprint of a, just a regular action flick around it. In other words, you've seen a million action movies that there's no reality to it. I said, but this time they go, this is about Benghazi, but we're going to make it like a fun Bro Action Movie. And it's a battle, a real thing.

Speaker 4:          00:43:39       And they all had, um, the Afghanistan beards, like they were out in the shed, the, uh, special ops beards and they, you know what the guy shows up who's not part of the inner circle, who are you? And he's like, we're fuckery Taylor. They'd be seal. And he's like, he's a good one. Fuck that guy. And like all that stuff. And then, um, yeah. And then, uh, it was also throughout the film, uh, an on again, off again, commercial for Mercedes, five different new Mercedes model cars in Libya post post revolution Kadafi fall into a brand new, uh, g five 15. Yeah. Okay. All these new Mercedes. And it was to the point where you're like, this is a Mercedes commercial, like this is getting uncomfortable, you know, like they wouldn't even swap out. I have some different cars. Um, and they said fuck a lot.

Speaker 4:          00:44:36       Like very superfluous use. Yes, he's fucking windows. You can't see fucking shit out of here. Like, why did you even need to say fuck? And my fifth establishing scene was main character facetiming back to the house boy. And his wife was like, hey baby. And he's like, how are the girls? And the girls were like, Hi Daddy, he's looking at miss. You guys really miss you guys. And then you see him in danger and he's like, I'm just my girls, he's making a video to send back to me. This is all I fucking, then the wife was pregnant, I was pregnant, I was pregnant. And the guy's like, oh my God, I'm a dad too. And like, it's just so dumb. And you realize, I don't know, once you've seen, you know, movies for 30 years like I have, I feel like when you see the blueprint, like when you see how it's done, you're like, this is just the same fucking, why would anyone feel entertained by this if it's dummies?

Speaker 4:          00:45:30       Just the formula. So Warren, the same reason sitcoms over and over, people like just formula according to this, I don't know if it's 100% true. It says the movie was made for 45 million. That sounds really low as a small budget for a Michael Bay movie that says box office was 69, so that's not good. That's not good. $20 million. I just, I saw one scene before I went to sleep where they're checking out the embassy security and the guy's like, he's fucking breaches in these walls. There's not enough. We're sitting fucking ducks right here. It's a lot of like macho deck slaps. It's really dumb. It's a really dumb make. Slappers um, he and all his movies, he did Pearl Harbor. That was the same kind of thing. Even facetime and that, you know, God damn it. That's right. It's like 1940 this isn't working so good. Cause I got bad was I love you too. Fluffy Jacks. Yeah. That's awesome. Speaking of awesome movies. Yeah, let's check out the new C

Speaker 10:         00:46:36       [inaudible]. You see what they do now for him

Speaker 4:          00:46:48       is that they, they cut in lieu of showing him moving. That was an action sequence, right? It was, instead of showing him doing the thing, there were like six cuts. So you don't see his enormous body trying to do this complicated. Yes. They fake movement with other people. Moving. One, two, three, four, five, six, six cuts. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. That's incredible. Yeah, and they're like, he just kicked that guy's ass. I saw it in six different frames.

Speaker 10:         00:47:23       [inaudible] I throw blows comes in small black dress.

Speaker 5:          00:47:35       I have vocal fries and tends to man, that's, by the way, he's a million years old and the girl's like 19 yeah, it's a million years.

Speaker 5:          00:49:04       It's always bad guys too. He's always fighting the bad guys to see how little he was emoting in that statement, that plan to get that money is bad guy like that. Like there's nothing behind those eyes. There's no emotion. No dead for me. It do you have a plan? Do you have a plan? Steven Sea Gal?

Speaker 10:         00:49:25       Don't get the money.

Plan to get the money. I don't. Or Latin. Maybe you get the money like a Cholo. He does like that. He blacks it up a little one. Oh, he does that. So he put the black on the end of that one.

Speaker 5:          00:50:20       cop. She looks like a, he said she right, right. You think they would take that line again? I mean we got to

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       roll guys. Maybe Caresa clearly. Right? She looks like a cop. She, let's see. Yes. Makes it

Speaker 12:         00:50:36       for a man and a woman. She looks like a cop. She looks like this trooper,

Speaker 4:          00:50:42       why would you, why would you leave that in the trailer? This is a major thousand dollars production. You're not going to shoot the lines, right? Or place the audio afterwards in post or something. That's a quick, that's because the girls editing this himself on his iPhone. I'm looking for a man and she, she looks like a cop. She looks like a stripper. Oh my goodness. Unreal. On real. I cannot believe that that

Speaker 12:         00:51:13       good for a man and a woman. She looks like a cop. She looks like this stripper.

Speaker 10:         00:51:23       Okay. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:51:28       Do you think when he's in the, this is clearly in Europe, right? Shooting in foreign countries. This is for sure. Oh yeah. This was a Middle East actually to no, come here and look. Oh, right. That was supposed to be, yeah, that's probably right. Yeah. So when he's there that people think, oh, this is a major production, this is a huge movie. And then, then he's like, no, we're making this for like $30,000. But I mean, to his credit, he comes out with a movie every five months or something. More than that. Yeah. Every three months he comes out with a new movie. Absolutely.

Speaker 10:         00:52:04       It's similar in structure. Money. All right. Now like kill me.

Speaker 4:          00:52:15       Isn't this the exact premise for the last year that we watch? That's what I'm saying. It's all the same. I mean, exactly. Exactly the right. There's some girl and, but he didn't do Kung Fu with her yet. He hasn't had the scene where he's like, oh, he fingered. Yeah, they fingered. That's why they're attacking.

Speaker 10:         00:52:30       Sure.

Speaker 4:          00:52:36       Hello there. How can up, I know, but will they do Kung Fu together? Oh, shutting seems like this as time. So you think it's creepy to shoot a sexy with him? He's old as fuck ain't even cute. We still get to that up. I bet that widow's peak. Oh, it takes away Agra. Just all black ink. Do you think he comes black ink? Because it is so it is now and stuff. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:53:07       Do you think could have walked through where we the money you'll pick up balls. Sense.

Speaker 4:          00:53:27       Thank you for noticing.

Speaker 4:          00:53:30       Wait, if he's about the honor, why would he steal 2 million in the first place? Does it makes no sense. There's no trying to break down our fucking premise to this. Just roll with it. Okay. He got Lionsgate though. That's pretty good. Theaters, theaters, production value on this one is definitely, it is much better. It is way better. There's a lot better to, somebody stepped up on this one. Maybe they saw our last podcast about what if a, they're like, oh shit, this house is on us. Um, I wonder how many movies he's in pre production on 37 a movie a week. Well actually you know how many came out in 2016 we're in 2016 yeah, right. 2016 there's one, two, three, four, five, six. Wow. Six wow. And next movies. That's a movie a month. Killing Salazar. Sniper. Special ops code of honor in connection with the Asian connection.

Speaker 4:          00:54:30       Yeah. End of a gun contract to kill his filming and attrition is in preproduction for next year. What did, but he is just, she found some investors and he has crank and then which ones did we just watch a gun? You know what? I bet they did. Cause I think Lionsgate gate picked up Tyler Perry's first few movies as well. They bought like 10 Tyler Perry movies for like a million each. Bundling them. And that's how he became so well known. And then this guy at this point, you take your guys like him take it off the top right. So what happens is a studio will go like, oh, we're going to only gonna give you like $2 million to make this movie. And he goes, my fees a million. Right? And then he may have to make the move. Makes it for $10,000 the whole movie, my fee is $1,000,989 yeah. But he's smart. He's doing it. He's maintaining his own career with these, you understand that there's a, there's a demand. And then I've always loved his imdv bio Stevens, a gauzy strikingly and somewhat boyishly handsome, often with a ponytail action star tense. Right. He definitely wrote that Shit, man. Of course he did. Of course. He was like, let me see was the most beautiful way. Striking. Yeah. Shit. I'm striking. They speaking a Kung Fu. Speaking of teeth people we've talked about, talked about a frosting with, uh, and how there's a whole push again, push. I know, but there's some new information.

Speaker 13:         00:56:22       Now you might be wondering what is oil pulling? Oil pulling is a very simple thing. It became in a high quality vegetable oil. I prefer coconut oil because it's other healing qualities. Taking it about a tablespoon of it, swishing it around in your mouth. And as you're swishing around this raw fat, the enzymes in the fat literally pull bacteria, pass and toxins from your body.

Speaker 5:          00:56:48       What's Your Pronoun? Uh, like, uh, uh, I'll be like, hey, what's your product? What's wrong? What's her pronoun? What's its prolean? I don't think it's a straight hair. Zoom. Zoom. Which Brent in the fuck is she talking about? I think it makes sense. What does Zim talking about? Got To wash your two fees with animal fats.

Speaker 13:         00:57:15       So let me show you real quickly how you do it. Oh, please do. Here's why. Coconut oil, coconut oil, coconut oil. I'm going to vomit already. Put it in your mouth. Fuck off shores. You're swishing around. Do not swallow it because you'll be in basically adjusting the toxins that you're pulling. So there we go. Put it in your mouth. Five to 15 minutes. Five to 15 minutes. And that's on the low end. I've been saying some that say 20 minutes. Can you just swish it around your mouth for 20 full minutes or just switching stop

Speaker 5:          00:57:45       or you can just floss. No stupid. Can't just floss. Fucking idiot. I love all these urine therapy. Coffee enemas. Swishing coconut oil. Why? Why do we need these alternatives to systems we already have in place that are working pretty damn good.

Speaker 4:          00:58:07       Last works. Cold medicine works. There's a knock on, on your whole floss though. People are saying it's bullshit. Yeah, but what about just getting food particles out of your teeth like after you eat statements though? True, true. Um, a lot of people were so gross, so, so, so in love with top dog. Oh Em. Gee, his last joke. Oh Man. Let's revisit some of the highlights because it's so funny. Yes. I've, I've spent time just reminiscing over that just alone, you know, just hanging out, thinking about how epic it was.

Speaker 14:         00:58:47       Hey Buddy, stop dog Kate, buddy. Stop Dog. Take Buddy. Stop. Doc. Do you need to wipe down the top dog?

Speaker 4:          00:59:03       Um, he really goes such a good call with a top dog was on the phone. We called and we just, I know that he loves street jokes. So we started reading. I'm blonde jokes. Oh my God. He lost his mind. He lost his mind. He laughed. So he said stuff that was so just him, you know what I mean? Like, it was so genuine to who it was. So authentic on that call Tom Bride. Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:59:33       Loved it down broad blind Joe. Yeah.

Speaker 14:         00:59:37       Ah, I love blonde jokes, by the way.

Speaker 4:          00:59:40       Yeah. And he laughed so hard in this so hard. Yeah.

Speaker 14:         00:59:46       Love it. His laugh is the best. Love those jokes. Oh, I got a little pod junk

Speaker 4:          00:59:59       for the easiest, just simple as broke. He said, do you remember? He's on that call. He goes, sometimes I'll just say a joke like that to myself and laugh. And I'm like, what?

Speaker 5:          01:00:10       He uh, he really likes telling him too. He kind of stretched them out a bit. Like he adds more detailed than you need. Yeah. Cause that's how much he enjoys telling him. I think he wants to talk.

Speaker 14:         01:00:25       I mean I've never had money.

Speaker 5:          01:00:31       One job when I went out, the only time I heard him laugh like this

Speaker 4:          01:00:35       was when we went out to, we went out to a uh, a breakfast I met, I went with him and a 90 year old man, I'm like 90 years old. Those two were telling each other street jokes and my dad was laughing this heart and by the way, the 90 year old man was too. I thought I was going to watch him die in front of us. I've never seen something. He was like, oh like shaking. And then he was like, now you do one. To me that was the old guy who I was like, I don't have jokes like that. And he was like, why? He didn't understand

Speaker 5:          01:01:05       comedians don't, when you ask them to tell a joke it's cause we don't tell street jokes. Right, right, right. That's from like the old time Shecky Greene and shit like that. Exactly. Red Button. Yeah.

Speaker 14:         01:01:19       Oh I got

Speaker 4:          01:01:20       you thought that was really funny. You know

Speaker 14:         01:01:28       that's really funny.

Speaker 5:          01:01:32       Are such corn cornball jugs too.

Speaker 14:         01:01:35       I told her that only coaches going to London. How are they against? Hilarious. Yeah. Good Rod.

Speaker 5:          01:01:53       That broad as really dates as you know who he is. Yeah. That's my favorite part of that joke cause it's some dumb broad would find that really tickles him. That really when women are dumb really gets is get some broad. Yeah. Like, like when your mom does something silly, he just loves to report the news back to us. Yeah. You know what your mom did today. Bribes are different. He says that to me. Sometimes you don't if you're talking like, yeah, you know my sister did it and he's like, Tommy brands are different. Yeah. That's like his loves that Shit. I love that expression

Speaker 14:         01:02:27       and the blinds. So did I, but I thought you might change his mind. How does it answer? It's hard. I think that's hilarious. Oh my God. Wait, that's so funny.

Speaker 5:          01:02:51       And the thing is, he's told these jokes and countless times, this is not the first time that your dad's regaled us with these blonde jokes. He tells me that he's been telling me these for you and he still laughs this hard steel screws up. Usually the setup and the punchline. Yeah. Then they got the guy, he wants to know he the other guy. The other guy came in, I'm like, it's over. You already fucked it up. And he's like, Huh, that. It's really funny. I can't remember how it goes. What episode is the full conversation and blue band that people can listen? The 59 yeah. Is it? Yeah. The last one. It's not in three 58 [inaudible] 59 actually, no. Yeah, you're right through 58 three 15 okay, so if you guys want to hear the whole conversation, listen to episode three 58 he also, you can hear the, the horrible jokes that were telling him didn't understand the concept of these are set up punch jokes. So I would say set up and you just got to go like what? It's like the knock knock who's there. That's all you gotta do. I would ask him, I would do the set up and then he would try to logically figure out the answer. So I asked them like this Polish joke, you know, how do you know if you're in front of a Polish firing squad? That's true. You spoke about how

Speaker 14:         01:04:06       the guns are faith. If the guy, dad sad, do you not understand how these jokes work? You're not supposed to actually try it. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:04:16       answer them any and he did it multiple times. Like right after that he does it again. I know, I know. He has to guess the punchline. You can't let the biggest revelation was him thinking that this is my act now. Right. You thought you were asking like 10 jokes into this and he's like, these are good. Like I don't know if you should do these, but these are shooting my way. What? Like you think this is how I do stand up now, but do you think your dad laughs this hard at your acne? No. No. Never laughed as hard at math.

Speaker 14:         01:04:52       This is, you don't give any one liners like this for, this is good stuff here, buddy.

Speaker 5:          01:04:58       What would you please? Oh my God. It would kill your career.

Speaker 14:         01:05:05       I heard that one before. Yeah, that's a funny one actually. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:05:11       That's crazy, right?

Speaker 14:         01:05:15       Hey, he's laughing so hard.

Speaker 5:          01:05:22       Corny jokes. He corny Blonde Joe. Straight up joke, but just the loves them, man. Yeah, it's a different time. I guess they used to love, I mean, that's how people would do. Take my wife please. Here you see the people just fucking fallen out of their seats. Yeah. They're killing. Crushing with that Shit. Unreal man. How times have changed, haven't they have? I've remembered a Polack joke. I'm gonna. I'm going to tell her that's pretty offensive. I'm a pole. Like I can tell those jokes. Okay. You can say it. Tell me, how do you know a Polish girl is on her period? Oh, she's only wearing one sock.

Speaker 14:         01:05:59       Oh, that's funny.

Speaker 5:          01:06:07       Got Anymore. Let only think about it. Okay. I don't know. Okay. I know you got some racial ones floating around in your head. Of course. I rememorized the truly tasteless joke book, but they're just, they just feel mean now. They don't even think two different times. They don't feel funny. Yeah. You know, we're in a new era. Yeah, man. All my life I was born in that. This always be a man, but I don't understand that binary. You're just man or woman. People say about being nonbinary via you're complicating things so much. It's really not that complicated. Why don't you just pick a gender? Did you pick a gender? You can't just make up words. Do you think where it says grow on trees, all words are made up so you're gay, right? My sexual orientation has nothing to do with my gender expression. God, which bathroom do you use? Probably the one that I'm less likely to get harassed him. But you wear suits but you wear dresses. Yes. But you put on makeup while spotted. Why did you transition then? Why are you so ignorant? But what does it say on your id? Oh, and that has none of your business so vital to pick agenda. There you go. And why do I agree with all the shit people are?

Speaker 5:          01:07:25       Cause I watched it and I was like, I agree with everything. My impression of the 80 year old third world. Yeah. What, why are you complicating stuff? I totally agree. But you're born a man, right? You wear suits. Here's a news flash. You're a fucking man. We can't. And we gotta be real careful with Ellis. We have to call him baby self. Yeah. Maybe cause he can't choose his gender and we're in it's child abuse. Tom. I know. If we dress him in blue, I gotta be real cognizant of it. Yeah, I know. Maybe self, toddler, so very um, non gender specific clothing and colors. What does toys? No, no, definitely no gender toys. I just give him plastic balls and sticks that are yellow or green. Well you know, I get him. Everything I do, I get him stuffed animals. I get them trains, I in books.

Speaker 5:          01:08:21       I don't know. Yeah, I really do. I even see gender and I don't know, I was at the store, we went to buy buy baby to get a new stroller. Yeah. And the girls section is terrifying though, cause it's all like easy bake oven, how to cook things. And then there's like, it's a toy mop so you could start cleaning sooner. The girl's section was, it's really gender and the boys, the boys too. I'm sorry. Yeah. See, oh, game. And the girls is like, how did keep a house clean? How to blow the CEO, right? Yeah, it was, it was really bad. The girl stuff is pretty appalling. Yeah. Yeah. Dump rods. I can you press pause? I gotta get the groceries. Yeah, sure. Oh, I dunno. Anyways, so hydrated. Uh, did you get the food? I did. I have groceries delivered so I don't waste my life at the grocery store and I guess I'm so lazy.

Speaker 5:          01:09:14       I get them to leave them out front. Um, and so we pick them up. We got to pick him up. Listen farts. Yes. No. How to, do you want a fart? Can you really fart? Do you want to Fart? Bark. Bark with me. You think of this kid? We, uh, this was, did you discover this kid or is it, was he sent in? Um, I think someone send a man. Okay. The Fo this kid is kind of interesting. It's not always the, the, the physically strongest who wins the battle. No. And it's not always the fastest. Right. Or the smartest. Right. Sometimes it's the person with the most stand Hima yeah. You know, that's the stand on my guys. Yup. Wow. It's generations. Do you think so? Yeah. I think with the, um, like I said, I don't know if I mentioned this, I was a top spelling bee champion in the state of California to, you've actually mentioned it quite a few, top 10.

Speaker 5:          01:10:24       And part of the problem is this shorthand texting. I, I'm guilty. Do you have it? I don't write out the word your anymore. I write. You are, you know, Idk. I don't know that was an accident, but it's still like, this is great. Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think it's a, it's because kids don't read as much anymore, I'm assuming. Right. Well what, um, what gave you that clue? Dan Anima. The Anima. Let's see, what about that? Again, I've mispronounced words that I've seen written for years, you know? Yeah. He does not remember I, what's the word I fucked up on our show? Pretty recent.

Speaker 5:          01:11:08       Con Con. It was a, yeah. Sounded like that. Oh, combative. Combative. Right. You're like, I've been reading that in my head is combatitive. Yeah, it's combative, right? Yeah. But then my mother would mispronounce words and I heard her wrong for years. Children of a foreign English speakers, foreign accent syndrome. So we get it. We get it bad cause it's your developmental area and you're hearing all these things set incorrectly and your case by both parents. Both of them. Yeah. The what tomorrow. Yeah. Pretty great stuff. Good words. Sometimes it's winning a battle map. Part of it is to get your rest and get your energy and your stand up going before wait, before you enter the ring, the ring called real life. You're not going to win in real life if you're standing was so low. He sounds like he almost got it right. Stamp Stammer when in real life if you're standing was so low closed.

Speaker 5:          01:12:28       What's interesting is that we shame people like him. No shame for all these other dumb things, but we don't shame people for just being straight stupid. Right. If we started a stupid shaming campaign, I think it would look cool with that. I'm cool shaming a this kid over, since Stan Stan stand up. That's how he's going to learn that word when in real life, if your standards are so low, if you shame him enough, he'll learn how to say it correctly for the rest of his life. It is interesting. The idea too much more. I don't know why we stopped shaming. No shame is a, is a good instrument for change. I agree. You should be. She had to write this down. Testing how this guy is doing kind of self help stuff. Interesting. Like Tony Robbins, but look at him. You know, it's kind of interesting.

Speaker 5:          01:13:31       It needs the help. Yeah. It looks like he should maybe read more of those books. That's why rest is important. Right. Important. So if you want feel like taking a nap, you should take a nap. Yeah. Gloves. Oh, you should stay down until you get better. Yeah. See that's it's always a sign of intelligence is fingerless gloves. It's just a, I think it's just a side of really hard time taking a nap bad. You should stay down until you get better. That's good advice that you'll win the bet. Match Mat or how about this? Like if you, if you stammer through your video, yeah, maybe recorded again. Right. Make it better. Nope, you don't have time for that. This guy doesn't, he's a guru.

Speaker 15:         01:14:24       Stop worrying about losing all these fake girls because you know why? Why, why they're diamond doesn't true. What one real woman, one real woman that's going to love you and respect you to the Anton is worth habit. Maybe sometimes it's best to wait it out.

Speaker 5:          01:14:43       That was good advice. Good advice. Yeah, that's actually good advice.

Speaker 10:         01:14:46       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:14:46       that was good. Here's what I want to know. Are you talking to yourself?

Speaker 10:         01:14:51       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:14:55       How old is this kid? He's never had a real woman I know. Talking about. So come and dock. Dave should hang out. Okay. Say you win this girl shop at hot topic and you find some similar item. You Buy Similac. You know something interesting to talk about his girl shop at hot topic and you find some similar item. You find a flannel, you know there's something interesting to talk about. Yeah. You know, wearing the same shirt. I assume Ila item a similar, I tell him in La, maybe his parents were foreign. Look, I'm not a pickup artist. Huh? I'm just some wait a mirrored who knows the lighting? Who knows a little bit about gay? Okay. Oh, I'm going to know who guy. I'm just a regular ass. Do you? Okay, bad boy. Get your bracelets. You know what? I always think about the brain and I know his comicon and, and, and you know geek girls and I'm gonna tell you a geek girls have the same run the same way as other girls do. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:16:01       Right there at the friendship. Yeah. That is a, a friendship did to get your bad boy bracelets. Yup. Yup. Yup. Tom, have you been working on your bad boy accessories? Are you a fucking bad boy or not? Yeah, I think so. Get the bracelets. They up. The stay on and all this shit's jumping on different screens. Yeah. They should really start shaming people for misspellings and uh, you know, and saying things wrong medically incorrect things and uh, like intelligence things. People should be shamed for their lack of intelligence. I think so. Absolutely. Because are you can kind of control only if you're trying. I think you should be shamed if you're trying to tell somebody what's up, what's up and then you're the dog. In the case of these videos, he's the preacher, right? He's informing them, telling you how to live. You're allowing us to up our stand on up stand alone. Yeah. I don't know. I think across the board, which just started shaming campaign and here's the most important thing ever. Respect.

Speaker 16:         01:17:10       Don't let someone take advantage of you or make you spend all their money on them and just act like a little bitch boy. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:17:18       Think he's done that. Yeah. Yeah. Now you realize that these videos are for himself. Well, yeah, of course. Of course. Yeah. Poor guy. I understand his money. Just remember to follow you on advice. You're not going to win in real life if you're standing was so low. True. Get out there. You have the Dan Umma Stat. Stamats Stan, Emma, my nose. Um, a lot of people really impressed that your mom's house was featured on 60 minutes and it's not every day that a show of that caliber features a podcast. Um, but with us it happens and we were very proud of it. Um, if you didn't catch the little segment they did, um, it was on the anniversary of the Cincinnati Fart and it really was pretty substantial. It was surprised that Morley safer covered the piece. Yeah. I didn't think they'd send him. Is it because he's dead? Exactly right. Yeah. Well, he came back from the dead to do this. Do the piece. I know. Yeah. No, he, they did one thing about morally, it's that he, he, he really does have that shaver and his face was melting off of his skull and he died the moment after he

Speaker 9:          01:18:44       retired and I met him at the door and then it happened. It shut the room. I've never been around anything like that before. It's a little loud. I got a dad that really far. It's good afternoon. Thank you for just coming to Venice on Cincinnati downtown. How may I direct your call? Hi Ya. Um, do you get to consume one book, a room to commemorate this Cincinnati Fart that happened last year to commemorate what? I'm sorry, could you repeat that? The Cincinnati fart anonymous caller at our hotel.

Speaker 4:          01:19:20       There's

Speaker 9:          01:19:20       something called the Cincinnati Fart. Right? It sounds like you're familiar with it a little bit. Yeah. Well, I, I went on this river cruise and they had a really big buffet and I was six months pregnant. So like I ate way more than I normally would. Lasagna, chicken, pork, Broccoli, garlic, mashed potatoes, two helpings of bread. I had four desserts that day. And then I took a nap right after. Yeah. I mean, after dinner I went back to the room and you know, she greeted me and I was just expecting to have a normal night, but it was anything but normal. What did it sound like?

Speaker 1:          01:19:58       Oh, by the way,

Speaker 9:          01:20:05       Caitrin wasn't that good and that's why I farted so big. The food was garbage. It was like a garbage buffet and I eat every piece of garbage on the table. True. I mean me, look at me. I really had some great farts in my life, but nothing like the Cincinnati Fart is legendary. The longest fart I ever had in my entire life. And it was amazing. I mean the, the carpets changed color in that room. Painting started appeal. It was really, really disgusting. Oh my God, you guys are so disgusting. This isn't any far. It was a legit 25 second plus Fart. I think the room was still smells. I'd be surprised if it didn't. Yeah, that room does have this, but they do make me do my drains, but it still comes back. Not sure what it is. It was like garbage on top of vomit and on top of shit.

Speaker 5:          01:21:04       Worst thing I've ever smelled. People ask me, Christina, how can I fart? Like you eat bad food. It's just that simple. I'm not your Fart Guru, but I can tell you what you can do to help yourself. You can eat

Could you spell that for me? Yeah. F A r t like passing gas. Um, can I put you on a brief hold? Sure. Yeah.
