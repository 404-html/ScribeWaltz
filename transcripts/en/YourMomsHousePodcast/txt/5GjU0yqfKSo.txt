Speaker 4:          00:05:57       that. It's twitch.tv/your mom's house podcast. It's cool. I, I, you know what, I'm very not cool. Yeah. And I went on there and I'm like, oh, what a great way for fans of the show to kind of chat it up, chat and, and, and go along with what's happening live. It's kind of weird, but I don't know what this kid, this kid does have a really long neck. Danny, long neck and Anita Lane in a lotion. One neck like this. Yeah. Now do you see, I do think it's really long or that it's an angle. It's really long. I was going to ask, do you think that the length has anything to do with his voice being Danny Lung, neck in, in, in, in their vocal cord stretched out? Yeah. He's got, is he not? He's not American, right? What is it? He's definitely American. Oh really? I thought he sounded like New Zealand, New Zealand. Oh No, no, no, no. Maybe in US mom's truck. Oh my God. The baby just kicked right. You have a baby. Oh my God. I was so painful.

Speaker 4:          00:07:00       Shit, man. There's a person there and forget. So ladies, if you're known to newness, they knew this comment, comment and uh, you know, I know when it is, am I in marks around what is happening? Long neck one lions, Dram your lists. You know what, I can't help but think when this happens. I mean, obviously, you know he's an odd bird. Yeah, it's an ostrich. But what's great about the Internet is that he's putting out a call out there for someone to rub lotion on his long ass neck. Yeah. It's a, it's an odd thing to do. He sounds weird. He looks different. Um, someone's going to do it. Someone's going to be like, I'd love to rub lotion on your neck. Is it about us being all connected? It's someone is watching this being like, I want to rub lotion on their kids. That's the one unifying element to the internet.

Speaker 4:          00:07:55       The rest is divisive and hate and you know, horrible comments. And then there's times like this where some freak can get somebody to rub lotion. That's true. Yeah. Do you think the vocal fry is a result of the length? I don't know. I don't know if he is, I'm making it so that it sounds like that or if it's really, um, just something that's, you know what I mean? I don't know if it's a big forced thing. It's forced. That's an aspect. This vocal fry shit. I know, but guys don't usually do this. Is it usually a a girl, a teenage girl thing or a younger girl? Yeah. Yeah. Dad. No, I don't know.

Speaker 5:          00:08:35       Megan and I have been together for nearly three years. She's a beautiful go who I'm very much in love with and I have a lot in common with. I can't wait to get home and jump in the pool.

Speaker 4:          00:08:46       It sounds like he's laying down when he speaks, right? No, it does nick down. Notice the dual desk. He have vocal fry

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       and also again an accent and affect the dual dis as he's talking like gangster. If y'all got a Laney no new on the side of my neck, you know, tell him to hit me up. Got Up, got it on nick. Manage. But it, now this does have the elements of a great, your mom's house. I'll tell you what's, what's striking me though, I think I know what you're going to say, but I do think what I'm really enjoying about a damn long neck or Danny long neck, whatever his name is, Danny long there that um, he's at least feigning some sort of confidence. You know, it's very easy to be down about yourself if you have a 26 inch neck. Yeah. But he's like, you know what? I'm owning it. I'm going to go with the nickname always. You know, you always have to accentuate your flaws. Yeah. Rather than try to hide them because everyone sees it and that's really success level when they call me big pop, you know what I mean? It's like saying mushy perps you know, my tits aren't getting any smaller. Yup. But we just got to address the fact that they're getting more and more enormous everyday. Big Daddy Stag Dick. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:12       Put it out there. It's one of your sad traits. Really bummed about having a big old stinky deck. Yeah. Everyone used to point at it and laugh like fun of me. Yeah. I get caught on things and people are like, oh, you got a big Dick. And I was like, no, I talk about it. Was that hard for you to change after football practice? Everybody hated changing after football. I went to a, a weird school with regard to that. What do you mean? Well, I remember, I mean it's weird because you should be a little more comfortable with it, but when I went to school, I'm an underclass. I'm a freshman high school. The upperclassmen were changing what towels around their waist and and like wearing boxers into the showers, not Jesus. So you don't want to break the mold of what the upperclassmen are doing because then you're like being extra weird, you know, queer.

Speaker 1:          00:11:08       But it was weird that they were doing that. It is weird, especially because they're upperclassmen, they're more developed. I think a big part of it was that it was a very small school. I think if it were a normal size, high school go, you know, or a big high school, I don't think that ever would have happened. I've always felt that showering at school was just so cruel and I know it's hard on a teenager and adolescent. Your body is just for Octa and then they want you to get naked in the middle of the day and then when I have practice at the end of the day and then just go home dirty, can't you do that like in a jam or something? Yeah, I don't know. Football you get really funky. It's tight stuff. You know a helmet, you're sweating and it's Florida. What time of day were you practicing? I was going to say rehearsing three 30 to five 30 and just fucking go home

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       and shower. Why do you have to shower your disaster after football? Just such a mess. Amelie. When one kid walked around flaunting his deck and he had a big old, yeah, he's black and he had a big Dick and he also, you know what he's looking for the dudes. Oh, he was looking for the dude's. Yeah, he was looking for Dee Dee found any dudes in high school in high school, but I think outside of high school he definitely met some dudes. It's so crazy. Yeah. Guys are such animal. He liked showing it, you know. But I feel like I would too if I had a big old begging me too. I didn't have a deck like that. Oh who does vary? My Dick would hide and especially when I was active. Yeah. Brought it would like invert, it would like grow into me, but that's, I think it's not like natural cause you're, your body's protecting your, you're tweaking berries natural. If you have a little Dick.

Speaker 4:          00:12:46       I never showered after, well first of all I didn't really do PE as a kid. I would like fake run the I do, I do like a 15 minute mile. So I would never really break a sweat because I was golf and then that meant that my makeup will get all messed up. So I was just kind of fake ticket sizes. So traumatic for boys mean he's still thinking about those decks, Huh? No, I'm thinking about like the what, how traumatic. It's like titty size, but tiddy size is traumatic for us girls. Yeah, that's true. I can see that. I almost feel like Dick size and periods are traumatic, different, you know, but then you get your period and like you want to hide that kind of from the other girls who maybe they don't have. There's really, yeah, I didn't like it. Yeah. Cause then it's, that's embarrassing.

Speaker 4:          00:13:26       You could bleed all over your shorts or something at school, like the first time you get it. That was my big fear is that I get my period at school and like I just bleed everywhere. I mean it didn't, didn't go down that way, thankfully. God. But um, yeah, but you guys are always into your big Dick Sizes. I feel like it's a big deal with guys deal. It's a big deal. Can they, I mean they have the science yet to make people's Dick's bigger. They do, but it's not, um, it's not like breast implants. Yeah, you figure it. See that's the thing is that usually do, and here's the thing about a breast implant that doesn't, let's say isn't perfect. You're like, ah, it's still a tit or whatever, a dick implant, or like, you know, a fake Dick that makes you make it bigger, could affect bodily functions.

Speaker 4:          00:14:12       It could affect definitely performance. It could affect sensation. Like it's totally not worth it to do that. I feel like they could just put like a mold dick over your tiny deck. Like you've got a small like can we just put like an implant deck over your regular Dick? I don't think they do it like that. Like I would never sign up for any type of surgery on my Dick. That wasn't the mandatory, well of course. I mean, yeah, I mean like I have a normal sized Dick, but I'm saying if it were, even if it were like micro penis, I still would be like, no, no, no. I agree. That's so, but here's the thing is that men have invented like vaginal rejuvenation and boob jobs and cellulite sucking out. You'd think that the guys would start inventing penile growth stuff. Like, I don't know if they can do bro.

Speaker 4:          00:14:59       I know they do employee, they do peanut, well they do male, female to male surgeries. They do. Yeah, they do an enlargement surgery. It exists. Right, right. But not like a big, it's not good. I don't think it's, I mean I've seen some shows on it. It's like, I dunno, it doesn't seem like it's, if it were a really effective and well done, you'd hear guys be doing it well. Cause I've seen those penises that like a, when a woman transition, they basically grow the clit out through stop point. So you just have an enlarged and enlarged clitoris or whatever and it's not, it doesn't look like a big all painter. I don't know. Dude. So crazy between your legs. That's basically what I would, I would totally get badge rejuvenation now. Snatch tighter just cause it gets blasted with kids. Like I'm gonna have my second baby and this kid's already big. They're like, it's going to be at least eight pounds. I think the doctor takes it fucking blast my badge for a test drive. That's how they know if it's done right, I'm going to have to have intercourse with you right now. Check your oil and you wake up. You're like, what happened? He's like, feels good. And it was a great time. Are you in the room too? And he's like, this is great. You're gonna love it as a field. Oh really? Nice. Cool.

Speaker 4:          00:16:22       But I have to because it's all blasted. It's all fucked up. Yeah. No. What disaster down there. And I don't think so. Can be even bigger disaster after the second boy. You think so, dude? Yes. It's all, it's all trashed. This vessel is trashed. I need to get my eight tits done. I could get my badge. Don, come on. My tits are all fucked up now they're below my got big nat Geo titties. When I take my bra off, they just hang to my belly. I look like I'm ever seen like those gorillas and the zoo that I've given birth. You're, you're kind of going overboard now. Naked, pregnant. I'm saying I take my bra and it looks like Coco the gorilla. I mean, she's just, it's been alive forever. I'm surprised she lived this long, long time. But anyway, I have gorilla tits and then this belly, it's fucking disastrous. Yeah. Cocoa knew sign language. How Rad was that? Raised a bunch of kittens. Coco is a little kid. We saw a fucking hummingbird getting fit. Maybe humming birds nest right outside our kitchen window. It's the most exciting fucking thing in the world. Another 10 years. I would weep at that site. I think.

Speaker 4:          00:17:38       I know. I feel like it's really special, isn't it? It is. It's hard to be cynical about baby hummingbirds being fed by their mommy. I know. It's so fucking cute. I got my little feet are out there so little the baby. I know. Tiny little farm. I get so excited when I have a customer at my hummingbird feeder. I just love it. I can't believe they're using it. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:18:01       here you are here. Speaking of Moms, check this out. So this girl set up her mom. Okay. By just having an aggressive conversation on the phone, like God, like the mom is sitting there and she set up a camera and then she's talking like someone's talking shit to her, you know, so that's the Mama.

Speaker 6:          00:18:22       Hello. Do you could pull up, I got you to address already.

Speaker 1:          00:18:31       Oh, I seen this. She's like, what is the grandma says [inaudible] has comedy that Sousa Trump

Speaker 6:          00:18:46       you can put up right now. I'm here.

Speaker 1:          00:18:55       That's such a mom move. Right? That's, that's your uh, yeah. Your inner baby bird. I know. Check this out.

Speaker 6:          00:19:08       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:19:18       she got her good. I mean that mom went from zero to 60 fast. Somebody calls our boy and says they want to talk some shit. We talked some shit. Yeah, call me. Call me right now, mother fucker.

Speaker 4:          00:19:31       Gary and consulate yesterday. I have some affairs in Hungary. Still a little bit cause my mother's death, blah, blah blah. And you have to call to make an appointment, right? They don't just take fucking walkups. Of course, I called a week ago and, uh, the Hungarian person answers and goes, ah, VR eating lunch, call back later, click and doesn't even say goodbye. It's so crazy basic. Not really. Cause that's how shitty my tribe is. And I have the phone and to Tommy, I go this fucking bitch. I mean, why did you answer the phone then? If you're not going to take my call, let it go to voicemail, Bro. You're eating your lunch. I respect that. But then to just be like, we already think, launch a call back later, he can hang up.

Speaker 1:          00:20:18       That's going to hear what you have to say. No, not nothing, 100%. Exactly how I imagined the Hungarian consulate to behave. You have the unfriendly,

Speaker 4:          00:20:29       it's my culture and I listen. Uh, we have many wonderful things about Hungary. We were once a great empire, culturally, a lot of cool shit. But you know, my shrink is trying to convince me. She's like, you know, not, not everybody. And not every Hungarian is like this. I go, yeah, but as a culture were pretty rough. It's a rough, I would say it's accurate and there's, there are nice people. That's true there. I mean I have wonderful people that I then, by the way, you thought that that tracksuit girl was one of your native cause like we were. We were. And so we find it. So anyway, the point is two months they're booked out. She has one appointment I can have in two months, which was yesterday. Tommy and I rolled down there and I'm sitting there and as blonde chick roles in wearing track pants and the track zip up and I was like, that's what's up.

Speaker 4:          00:21:15       That's my girl right there. She's totally one of my tribe. I of course do, you know, rude is shit like not very helpful. Sit Down with Uva and it's kind of not. And we'll have a video that plays the passport photos. Yeah. That shows you how to go about entering to get your passport information. So fucking weird family enter. And in the video the family sits show, they show you the family entering, sitting across from the Hungarian consulate, we employee and video and then uh, getting their photos taken. And then fingerprints, you know, they show a guy in a cast, like his arm's in a sling and the cast hang walks in. He never even semis smiles. He walked with a measurable kind of face children looks like look like they fear him like they stand back from him and then when they're like take a photo and it shows him going just a grimace on his face.

Speaker 4:          00:22:19       That's what it would be like when you come to there. It's an off video. Yeah, just misery thing. Optimistic. How's that now? Most people would like even with just show a family walk in, hey whoa, it's so weird that they would cast a guy with an arm cast and then two of his fingers and a miserable look on his face. Miserable. Yet. It's so funny. Very weird. But it makes me dread even like I was fucking dreading having to go there and deal with this shit. Cause you know the Hungarian government is like not, they're not. It's not actually what government is easy. That's true. Having to do us stuff sucks. But man, you can't even smile. Like they can't even feign being human. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. So I'm glad that shit over with. This is like the last thing I have to deal with from my mother's death.

Speaker 4:          00:23:10       Nobody tells you when somebody dies. It's just paperwork for fucking two or three years, man. It's just a legal nightmare. So if you can get your affairs in order and get a will in place, a living trust before you died and make it easier on your kids and your family do do it because it is a such a bomber if you don't have any of that. Um, so anyways, you got a new show. Well here's the thing, I talked about it last week and I've done a lot of messages. People are into it. So this is a spoiler alert. Spoiler alert, the staircase,

Speaker 1:          00:23:45       spoiler alert, it's 13 episodes, so you might be behind and if you don't want to hear this, I'm giving you fair warning. Scroll ahead a few minutes. So that being said, here we go. I have been obsessed with this thing. Um, they recently added three new episodes. So I guess this thing came out. I missed it when it came out. Originally it is an old ass show. Well it's a documentary series. How long ago did, they probably originally aired it, I don't know, at least a few years ago. And then they updated it with three new episodes, but it was, the whole thing was new to me. So I'm, I've been tracking through 13 hours and I even enjoy it when I wake up and I was waiting for the twist, the turn, you know, and uh, again, if you haven't seen it yet or you want to see it or you're halfway through it, I'm going to give it to you right now.

Speaker 1:          00:24:35       Um, but if you're not, I'll tell you this. The, the fucking show gives you, I would say eight episodes or more where you're like, dude, this is, where's this going to? How is this going to turn in any way? And then it's the biggest fucking turn that you don't expect because there was corrupt officials within the system, um, who withheld in perjured themselves on the stand banana people in the SBI, which is like the State Bureau of Investigation. I didn't even know there was an SBI. I've never, I don't know if every state has it, but they have it in North Carolina and you know, it was a big, big murder case there. So they send in the, their officials and their experts to, you know, test everything and uh, you know, uh, they, they didn't do a DNA analysis. They had a guy go on the stand and make claims that they turned out that other experts said you could never make.

Speaker 1:          00:25:39       And this dude just blatantly lied. He just lied on the stand to convict the guy who, you know, the whole time you're watching this thing and you're like, there's no way this guy has not done this crime, but they end up placing if, if he's getting a fair trial, you could argue that there would be reasonable doubt in some way and therefore that's what you're, you're, that's what you're going for as a defense. You want to, is there a reasonable doubt? Well, they didn't give him a fair shot at it. And what ends up happening is because of the corrupt government people, this guy actually a gets a new trial and then has to decide whether to go for a plea or take it to trial, some terrible decision. It's a horrible choice to have to make. And actually, you know, things became more favorable to him, um, for the new trial, like and looked like even more evidence would be withheld because of some of these circumstances and the time had gone by and I'm like, baby, this search warrant wasn't valid.

Speaker 1:          00:26:47       Maybe they shouldn't allow that. So all these things would have actually led to a more favorable case for him. But then he's like, you know, at this point he's like 71 and he's like, you know, I've already been to prison for eight years. It's been great. It takes on you. And he has one kid who was like, go to trial, fucking vindicate yourself. The other kids like, are you out of your fucking mind? Like this is too crazy. Take the plea. You don't go back to prison. Yeah, it's on your record. But you know, you only have this much time left and it's been horrible. Let's just end it. So he ends up taking a plea and he does take place. So I woke up, I wake up to eat snacks occasionally and watch a minute of your show and he was at home with his family, uh, drinking champagne and celebrating and listen that.

Speaker 1:          00:27:34       And they're all just like, yeah, Daddy, we know you're not guilty daddy. It's like, how do you, how do you believe your parent who's clearly guilty? I don't want to believe it. I mean, look at, you can believe that he didn't, I know there's people obviously that believed that he didn't cause people would think, oh, Jeren isn't, it's, I know. It's so crazy. Yes. So many similar behaviors to him, especially in the early days. See this, they actually, what's incredible is the, the actual just accomplishment of filming this documentary, they filmed it for 16 years. That's amazing. Um, so it's, it's an amazing thing to, you know, a product to even come up with like what a project this is. But you know, you see him in those early days when she's, you know, freshly dead and he's smoking his pipe. Look. Yup. But I loved her so much.

Speaker 1:          00:28:26       I miss her. And you're like, there's just little things that are quirks. What I learned also, or what I came to think over time is that it is a bit unfair in a way too, man. He goes sympathizing with the murderers. We'll know. It's like you try to be objective. You try to watch these things and go like, it's a little unfair in a way to to judge people's behavior under stress and be like, that's the only indicator. I mean I feel that way, but I'm saying if you're somebody you go, oh, he's acting like this. You shouldn't act like that. That's not a hundred percent accurate. People process stress different. Yeah. No, it's true. People have odd reactions to death. They do. You, you're in shock for a long time when somebody dies and who knows. But I will say that the words I've many times I've watched her show when he's talking and it's a lot of horse shit he does. He does. Spin yarns. He is full of Shit. And you know what he never fucking says, right? I never did it. I would never kill my life. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Well, every time I'm eating a sandwich and watching watch like eight minutes of it, 13 hour documentary. But if, if, if someone had accused me of killing you, there's only one fucking thing to say. I love my husband. He's my pride and joy. I would fucking kill my husband.

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       It's still saying that you guys were even saying, I'm gonna kill me. I love my husband. What would you say? You'd be like, I'm glad she's gone. Time to get dead. Time to date. Can we look at your Netflix queue

Speaker 1:          00:29:54       and I want to make it, I just think that it's, to me that nine one one call reads so false. I think this is my interpreter. That's a, that is a totally, it's like bad acting. You could tell when you try to act with someone and you're like, you're not good at pretending to do this.

Speaker 4:          00:30:10       And it reads, it reads like her. I didn't hear it when I was laying trying to sleep the other night. And you played that and then I won. I had panic in my heart for him. You didn't can't tell, but I don't listen to enough. Nine one one.

Speaker 1:          00:30:23       Oh, I thought it was horrifically bad acting. I'm not an expert. The other thing or the crime scene photos and you're like, I'm really supposed to think that this is a fall. Like from the stairs. I Dunno. Is it possible they have experts testify that it's possible that they see it as how much blood is that? There's an incredible amount of slough fall, fall down the stairs. I fall down the stairs. I mean it's like lacerations to the head, blood everywhere and she fell.

Speaker 4:          00:30:53       Oh, can we please just pull up your Netflix queue so the audience can see what I see when I open Netflix and I have to click on to my profile and thank God we have separate profiles.

If you make the mistake of clicking on like one dumb show, the Netflix forever is like, do you like this other dumb shit I saw that you liked? It gives you this category. Quirky TV shows featuring a strong female lead look at that. But I don't like any, I wouldn't watch any of these. I'm not interested in, you know, it's just interesting that they have it broken down to that door. They do working with a strong female lead.

White shirts are for fucking nerds and Europeans. Eastern Europeans. Um, Yup. And Oh, tomorrow the don't forget it's, I'm on hot ones. Um, that should be fun. Sean Evans. Fantastic. Thank you sir. Um, how hot was it? Be Honest. I know. Everyone wants to ask you that. How hot we're the wings. They got hot, they got hot. So how does it start? It starts like super, like, oh yeah. Like where you're like, that's not spicy flavor. Yeah, yeah. You go, that's nothing. And then it goes a little bit more and you're like, oh, maybe this is, it's your fear of it that's going to be, and then I think, I think actually they get the hottest one is like number eight.

Speaker 1:          00:38:03       They say it's 10 but it's really like you get to 10 I did all of them. Oh yeah. I cried at one point. Did you drink milk? Yeah, we got, we got chocolate, soy milk or chocolate. I don't like regular milk is disgusting and terrible that drink milk are disgusting. People discuss. If you're not a baby, there's no point drinking if you're an adult and drinking whole milk. Yes, you're a total fucking pedophile without question. You're disgusting. You're a bad person. Absolutely. Don't you have a friend that's drinking cups of whole milk? Oh my God. Ordering it in restaurants.

Speaker 4:          00:38:37       Does it come warm to having this? And he's like, he's like, oh, and do me a solid Darlin go ahead and bring me a glass of milk. And she's like, I'm sorry, what gross does your parole officer know you're here? Yeah, I'll give him a heads up when she's like, okay. And so she brings it nice and warm. Temp to room temperature. Right. So it's all fucking warm. Like it just came out of the cows tits. I Dunno. It just seems drank a glass of milk. It's like, ah, it's just flat. Did you do that in private? Do it in private or don't do it at all. It just looks like it's a glass of mucus. It's just fucking disgusting. It's gross. I mean there's no reason for you to be drinking that as an adult. You're a grown adult. You're not a baby. You don't need milk anymore. I agree. Can I use to hate it as a kid? Even like give it to you as your lunch. It was like part of the lunch program or whatever and he'd be like, it smells because it would come in like, you know, a plastic container with all the little milk cartons and it would just smell because it had been sitting around and the, and the spare milky deal. Rose fucking nasty. Let's put on something nice.

Speaker 6:          00:39:40       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:39:54       Hi.

Speaker 6:          00:40:01       Oh Shit.

Speaker 4:          00:40:04       Yeah. Do that also reminds me of somewhere?

Speaker 6:          00:40:14       Yes.

Speaker 7:          00:40:19       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:40:27       Oh yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:40:32       They had the same dentist. I didn't really have this same kind of, well, she's got equipment. You see she's got the Janet Jackson headphones. Do you see that shit? Well, she, yeah, I mean she's obviously a little more advanced. How did she get that art? She's like, I have it lubricated my instrument. I don't know. I wish the guy would have had a huge coffee at the end. You'll see like black tar come up. Yeah. You don't have no cough. He knows what he's doing. Practicing that long shift for days. Ah, man is the rectum I've done night. Not How do you get that crazy? Like what happens where you just don't give a fuck anymore, Tom, how do I get there? That's what I'm saying. I don't know. Alcohol and then you'd just booze. Yeah. You really got to go hard daily. You never fuck around. You never skip days. Always drinking. Never. Not Drinking. Now we got this message. I haven't even read it yet, but it says, um, dear mommy is an epidemic, has been brought to my attention. Started a few months ago when I was showing up. Buddy. Tom's special disgraceful. This buddy

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       of mine had the subtitles on early into the special. I suggested to turn them off. He said, no. He watches everything with subtitles on which is true and that was that 10 minutes or so go by. I began to notice that he was laughing at punch lines before they were being said no. I paused a special on laid down the law. He didn't. He didn't and still doesn't agree with me that subtitles spoiled, joke's ruined. The element of surprise and timing and overall just distract from the actor performance. We don't watch specials together anymore and it's my mission to find out what kind of person people are and quizzed them on this. Get this. A lot of people watch specials with subtitles on. It drives me nuts. I like these clowns are just being pretentious. They are ruining the experience for themselves and also watering down your guys' comedy. My best denial analogy is it would be like reading the last sentence of a chapter before the last page of the chapter as Comedians, I would like your input on this matter. Am I overreacting or these people? Monsters, grass casino on your machines within. Thanks for booking Boise. Tom. Look forward to seeing you perform. Notice you two haven't had any play on words for Boise yet. Thanks for all the laughs Trevor.

Speaker 4:          00:42:41       Good point. Trevor Boise, why is he Poissy noisy, noisy, noisy. I Dunno. Boys, boys, boys, boys and holes. Ease boys inside me. Yes. I'm like that kind of work on this, right? Well sir, I think here's, here's the problem titles. If you don't have a hearing problem. Well here's the problem with the subtitles is that they're not always accurate. They're not always accurate. But he's also right that with, with regard to especially jokes, right? Words will appear before their set of course. And so that, and also you're missing out on comedic timing, facial expressions. Uh, maybe cause we work on these punchlines, right? For instance, uh, you just do a gesture to go with a word and now the laugh is even bigger. So you are fucking with what we do. Maybe the people that are doing this that don't need to have the subtitles. Maybe it's a little bit of anxiety.

Speaker 4:          00:43:38       Interesting. They don't like the element of surprise. They they want, like he said, you know, I want to read the, the end of the thing first because I know some types of anxiety about it. Well, because people have tons of anxiety. Well yeah, the yellow, the key to good comedies, the element of surprise. So either you're right, maybe it's a control freak thing and this guy doesn't want to have a good time. In which case I would say give your friend a drink, have a fucking beer. Like chill the fuck out. I don't know why. I want to know why he wants to come on if he's not having trouble hearing. That's true. I don't understand it personally. He wants that. But it takes the fun out of the sand up. Maybe he feels like it's a little more insight or something, you know, he's like a little more ahead.

Speaker 4:          00:44:15       He's a little ahead of it. But I'm telling you, because I've seen how they subtitle things. It's not always accurate. The words, uh, and the wording is so crucial to a joke. Why don't you say Tom? Yeah. We, we think about words. And how many words and word placement. It's very crucial. So I don't, I don't see why anybody would want to spoil the fun. I agree. I, you know, I'm watching that show Rita, and it's in Denmark. Well, language they speak. Is it Danish? I think so. It's not American. So anyway, uh, and I know they're fucking subtitling it incorrectly. It bothers me. I wish I knew about subtitling from another language they fucking fuck up. But even in this, in our own language, they fuck it up. I'm sure

Speaker 1:          00:44:59       one thing that's so true, it's like so inappropriate now, but in the Narcos, which is filmed or it takes place at the previous seasons where Columbia, I think they're going to Mexico for the new season. Those guys are constantly, constantly saying, Maricka always. Yeah. Mighty guys like a short, shortened version of it. Um, so it might've Gone Liz, the full word, mighty guys like fag and they say it all the time and it's in this uptight all the time. This show, it feels like if it was an English, that's just not acceptable to say. Now Tom has honor percent. It's 100% how everybody that I've ever grown up with in South America speaks. They're constantly calling you. I mean, more so than I ever experienced growing up in English. They're much, much, much worse at that.

Speaker 4:          00:45:52       Well, this whole Social Justice Warrior Horse Shit, you know, it's a very wonderful American thing that we're doing culturally now. Policing everybody for every little fucking thing they say that's remotely offensive to them. Listen, same in Hungarian. Do you think they've stopped saying faggot or whatever because a five people are upset by it or whatever. I mean, come on, you're going to stop. You know what I mean? It's just, it's silly. You're not going to police the world into making the perfect world exist to everyone gets their needs and their feelings or was going to be nice knowledge. Yeah, guys, this is a safe space. That's my favorite. It's a safe space. There's no fucking such thing as a safe space. Okay? You're always under threat of being your feelings misunderstood. Are you not communicating clearly? This fucking generation is, fuck you guys are all fucked and you're creating this puritanical dog shit place is.

Speaker 4:          00:46:45       You never going to sterilize the world guys. It's never going to fucking work out for you so well. The world is a fucked up place. I know that. Everyone's nice. No one did. I don't. You want to prepare your kids for that inevitability that there are fucking dickheads out there. Either fucks racist people. Avoid that guy. Don't talk to someone like that. You walk away from them. The best thing the preschool teacher ever said to us was that he, she says, your son is a great kid. Nice kid, doesn't play with everybody. And I said, that's right. That's how I fucking raised him. He's an elitist when you did, but I did say to play, but he plays with some people he doesn't play with good. Why should he play with everybody? Kids he doesn't play with or just Tan. They're not what you think. Have a little bit of fun, more Melanin in their skin. No, she did not say that. He's just blondes lump ones in their eyes. Make sure the light, I don't know. It's just, do you teach them that? That's not what we do, but, but I am proud of him. He's discerning because why shouldn't she be discerning with your friends? It is great. You wanna hear another prank call. I loved hearing other prey called another one from, I think from Fort Simpson. So he calls a tattoo shop. This guy's got talent with the uh, God. It's so funny what he does.

Speaker 8:          00:48:09       The, the Sissy.

Speaker 4:          00:48:13       A Fremont Street. Remember that? How can I forget? He's like, Hey, I'm a sissy. Gemini. How can I forget? Oh, he's a sissy. Gemini. He's such a fucking freak. I'm a Gemini too. Did you know that I'm a sissy? Geminis this guy, just in case you're a, Oh, we can't forget cause I like white. We'll see like our son. Right. You know?

Speaker 8:          00:48:49       Thank you.

Speaker 4:          00:48:51       Yeah. Okay, so that's that fucking guy. All right. No, the great. Tony made a, a prank call using him to get a tattoo. He wants to get a tattoo. Okay,

Speaker 9:          00:49:04       so he sets it up. My Dad was looking to get a tattoo. Can't really figure out what exactly he needed. If it's all right, if you have a sec, do you mind if I put them on real quick and you can rx. Okay. Like a sailor. Jerry was kind of style traditional. That's awesome. Come on down here and check it out. And so like that. Make an appointment, bitch. All right. That too. On what? Gemini? Yeah. Special white slept. Um,

Speaker 10:         00:50:28       which is, I love of the Tattoo Guy. Laps and laps. I also think it was great that, um, that's so funny. Tony did a, he goes, he's like, come on, dad. Plays against, so like the Tattoo guy. What's going on? It's brilliant. It's this guy got a real talent. Yeah. This guy is a real talent. The fact that he's trying to temper dad is just fantastic. Another great call. Thank you so much.

Speaker 1:          00:51:01       Let's stop here for a moment and we'll regroup. We'll be back with guests very soon. Okay. We're back here with Comedians, writers, actors, producers, Jews,

Speaker 10:         00:51:14       wrappers, wrappers, shoes. Yes. Yes. It's both Jews. No, come on. No. Are you kidding me? Here's the thing. You fucking converted. Oh wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't love the vibe of that. I was, I was saying like, you haven't converted. That would be nice. Oh yeah. There's a, how do I say it? It was more like a, Oh, I didn't mean that like that. Let me rephrase it. Did

Speaker 1:          00:51:39       you convert it?

Speaker 10:         00:51:42       People needed those facial expressions? I think so. I think they do a lot. Ah, yeah. Why not? I was Catholic. That was humiliating. What are you were Catholics? Oh yeah. Yeah. You guys, do you guys come on over? Hard to mass on Sunday every week? No. But see in Judaism you can still have a Shabbat, which is today, and we'll light some candles and sing a song. And you're still part of, you know, deep tradition. What's that? Oh, first of all, was it it? Was it a demand? Oh, it wasn't a demand. It was a, it was an ultimatum. Was it really? It was a, how do you bring it? Was it like an expected ultimatum or was it wasn't an ultimatum. I would never. Right, but you were like, I would prefer this. Well, you know, the problem would be, hmm, no, I mean obviously there's a subtext of every Jew that's like, I would prefer this.

Speaker 10:         00:52:25       Yeah. It's like the obnoxiousness and chauvinism to say like, and now you can join. My culture is, I would never have explicitly said that she, Natasha volunteered. Really? Wow. And you knew, but you know it would be meaningful to him though. I mean is that I went, well, yeah. But also I went to Catholic school and I was not connected with Catholicism at all and she has, she had an entertainment lawyer, so she was familiar with the culture. He been in Showbiz for another year and I really did like fall in love with the traditions. I could see how that gets done. Think it's all about like there's a holiday where you just eat outside for a week under a tent under palm fronds and told me that this is a blue band. Yeah, he's our producer. He told me about it wrestling. Right. There's the red band expanded universe. I know about this. When we left, when we left red ban, we hired Bluebay.

Speaker 10:         00:53:18       Well, we also have a producer for our podcast, but it's a Jewish podcast, so it's gold band. That's great. Great name for our are real name is and the Dov. Oh, he's okay. He's cold. Ben Himself. He's from the old country. Yeah. So, um, yeah, no, we're big fans. I just think the Jews are great. So great. I feel very welcome now. Yeah, kind of did that yourself. You don't even have a producer here. Yeah, that's right. I just pushed the button all by myself. That would be bad if that was one of your saved like drops.

Speaker 10:         00:53:53       I approved. The sound effects are actually totally negating the double lightening bolt flag that you have in front of your house. But now I'm kind of going, okay, I'm, I'm more comfortable. There's a bunch of save stuff for every Jew. Well, that one says I approve Jews. Jews are great. Jews are funny. Whose voice? That's it from an interview that Yoshi, you know, Yoshi, Yoshi did an interview once where he talked about a lot of crazy things. Those were some of the things. That's Yoshi. He also says this in the same interview. Fuck the girl with no arms and one leg necessarily. Have you say something good like, yeah, so I mean I, you know, if I have somebody coming to the show and I go like this might be funny to drop with them, I'll prep it, I'll get it ready. So Natasha converted. It's so fascinating. I really do. I mean I was raised pretty, I wouldn't say like intensely, but like pretty Catholic grade school and a Catholic, all girls Catholic school for high school, I was the first challenge.

Speaker 10:         00:55:29       The Jews were more rational because I grew up in the San Fernando Valley. It just made a little more sense, a little more intuitive. I mean the two main tenants are 24 hour period ideally where you turn off your phone to Saturday sundown and you like candles and have a dinner party and then the next day, Saturday, what does it mean is converting you right, don't fucking call me no cell phones, but you know about that. It used to be Saturday. They literally, I'm not kidding. They literally, they shifted the day by one day. I mean, the whole thing about Christianity was that

Speaker 11:         00:56:24       it was self conscious about its connection to Judaism for a long time. So they did a lot of weird like adjustments to say we still have a sabbath, but it's no longer on Saturday even though it's pretty obvious that it's, that it's all good test to mentors. I mean I'm not even a, well there are three, Natasha didn't say it right. So there are three main tenants of Judaism. Procreate, keep Shabbat. And then you remember the beginning of ducktails where scrooge McDuck is swimming in the pool. Right?

Speaker 10:         00:56:46       Cool. Why don't you, yeah, that's the third major. Third Nights of tenant points. I love swim and background, but we invented that. You invented, that was a gift that we gave to you. And the reason why I know the tenants is because I had to take 19 four hour classes in order to, you're good at it. The other thing I love before a trio of rabbis told me that if I went to Paris with my baby, they, you know, if it was Jewish it might get like, you know, hurt. And was I okay with that? Oh Wow. And did you, when you menstruate, do you have to go sit in, in the every time? Yeah. Yeah. I don't touch her for the full week. Do you know about that though? That's not a joke. No, that's Orthodox Jew.

Speaker 11:         00:57:24       Jews don't touch you. Not only for the week that you're menstruating, which obviously every normal person doesn't touch their white while they're meant straight up. Of course, the week after also it's two full weeks until ambulation and then we fuck when you're fertile. Right. I mean the, the argument, it's pretty barbaric and cave manage, but the argument is kind of like, well, if you don't touch wife for two weeks, then you're like so horny for your wife all the time. There's something about that, which I haven't felt horny for my wife and I would, I would say seven years and we've been together for six. No, you're right. I love to hit that cooked. You also totally love the fact that, I mean, other cultures do this, but like in Jewish culture, it really like Jewish people will support each other, you know, like, yeah, that's definitely true.

Speaker 11:         00:58:05       Knowing like in businesses I'm serious. Like, you know, I don't like where you're going with this. I'm serious. But they w people will support each other. It lifts up a community. Like you don't see that in every culture. Well, I think that any culture that has been a subjugated to weird forms of oppression become black, tight, tighter, and more and more connected and more supportive. I was thinking about this, about gay people recently, like, uh, how it's like homophobia so awful. But it also creates this like interesting culture of like, you know, this fiber community. And if homophobia literally went away then, I mean, imagine what gate the gay community wouldn't exist. It wouldn't be a gay community parades or nothing. That would just be like people in the suburbs fucking each other, right?

Speaker 10:         00:58:45       Yes, it would be good. I'm not saying it'd be bad, but there'd be something, there's something vital that's created from oppression, which is why I'm

Speaker 11:         00:58:52       Oh, ardent homophobe not cause I don't like gay people. I like to push the culture forward.

Speaker 10:         00:58:58       Mother fucker. You appreciate that. That makes me feel like a member of a community. There you go. Is that also what that guy said? That's Joe Pesci touch it. Did you get any kind of emblem or necklace or what do you get when she got her clitoral? When they removed it and put it on kind of the value. You get a name? Yeah. Oh yeah. You're allowed to say it or you got a special like it. It's not like a transcendental mantra or you're not allowed to tell him. Can you share your TM mantra? It's Natasha, Coco Diaz.

Speaker 10:         00:59:31       Tell him your name. What's your Jewish name? Oh, that's good. Dot. Oof. The guttural are, isn't really flowing off the back of your throat, but, but which means tree and I don't remember what that light of light because of Ligero. No, but yeah, that's why you went with Ora. Yeah. Okay. I gotta tell you, I know I'm really into the fact that you're not like, yeah, I did this thing to fucking, I don't know, pray with him and sacrifice kids, whatever. Jews, dude, you're like, I'm really on board with it. Yeah. Well, I mean I can't say that I'm fully, oh, actually we got to run. Okay, thanks. But most of his brothers a rabbi, so, and he's moving here, so he'll also help us, you know, continue to celebrate the big holidays. You know, it's nice. They're all at night, the holidays and you're already drinking and eating. You know, you're on a good team.

Speaker 11:         01:00:19       You know the, you know the old, there's an old Jewish joke, which is that every holiday has the same theme is a, they tried to kill us. We won. Let's eat well because that's a classic to Joe.

Speaker 10:         01:00:31       Nice. I like a celebration. Then like Easter Sunday, it's a bomber I fucking hallway. Bummer. But Easter is also based on a Jewish holiday. What are the, is it the crucifixion of JC? And then he rises from the dead to the station.

Speaker 11:         01:00:45       Fucking cross. Chuck bomb was a Bummer, but Easter is Passover, right? So the last, the last supper was passed. So it was a Passover Seder. Straight up.

Speaker 10:         01:00:54       Yeah. Where are you like have to get blasted drunk?

Speaker 11:         01:00:57       Yeah. Well, no, you, oh, that's four cups of wine. That's true. But there is actually one holiday in Judaism where you're literally supposed to get drunk. Oh, right. That's a different one. It's called Purim. Oh, Pam. About that. It's like, it's Ju Ju Halloween and you are literally commanded to get so drunk. There's a character in the, in the story called Haman who was like the bad guy. He tried to kill us. We won. Let's eat. And uh, but this is, they tried to kill us. We want low. Let's get back. Let's get fucked up. You guys are really putting on an appealing,

Speaker 10:         01:01:25       do you tell your choice? They're Catholic. Not yet. I mean, he's only two and a half, but we're also not, yeah, we're not really, I mean, maybe you could argue where culturally Catholic, but it's also at a man. I mean it's like there's lights. Did you, how'd you baptize them? Remember we did at the urging though at the, almost almost ultimatum of, of my parents. Oh yeah, yeah. Oh No. I didn't want our child to go to hell either, but I wasn't going to, I mean like, I don't remember you saying it. I remember getting multiple calls. Okay. Do you want to hear what was it in July? And I was like, ah, yeah, setting it up right now. All right. Are you having a girl? No. As a boy. Oh, nevermind that. Wait, what was it? Well, it was just one of the other great things is instead of a baptism, the girls comes out of your coach, a naming ceremony, give birth out of their vaginas. But no, isn't it? Um, if your mother, you don't have to get their debt cut. Oh yeah. That too. Automatically you're in the club,

Speaker 11:         01:02:18       you were in the club or you get jumped in or fucked in. That's the other, it's like, it's like [inaudible] basically you'd have to do 19 four hour classes. Uh, welcome everybody to the orientation for ms 13. Um, but, but that would be a good clip. That would be great. I would love for you to use it. Yeah. Unless people think it's racist and it goes viral on that level, then I would like you to not use it. So there you go. What's called Coulis. That's my favorite line in that. Um, okay. Judaism where we got it. Yeah, we got it in 1994 our costs. I'll tell you what's funny about the conversion classes. It was like, it was a couple of couples like Natasha in me. First of all, it's all, it's all I didn't have to, but I did because it was nice. It's a nice husband and there are no, no men.

Speaker 11:         01:03:10       By the way. There were some like people like me, but there were no men converting because the men have to get circumcised to like God be adults. They have to get their, did they do for real though? Yeah, they got a little ritual Dick. For Real. That's why historically Mr Teen Orientation, I'll take out our dicks for the ritual. Yeah, they cut it right here. The head I, I don't know. I think it's a great question. I actually think it's, Oh, definitely. It would be on the head of the Dick. This is like a blood spiritual, you know, making your day is like gang shit man. Yeah. For Real. Yeah. But that's, that's why historically men have been much less likely to convert to Judaism than women because even if you're 40, you still have to get the circumcision. You got to do it well.

Speaker 11:         01:04:01       You raised a orthodox or, yeah, I was raised, well, I was raised in Oakland with my mom who's like an atheist Hippie, but my dad, when my mom and dad split became, uh, he got a, became very religious. He joined up with a group of Hasidic Jews known as the sophomore who are literally the most religious of all the Hasidic Jewish groups are like the most extreme of all the acidic juice. It was pretty, pretty crazy. They don't like my dad and mom, my stepmom and my dad didn't sleep in the same bed together because of the, because of the monthly, it's really intense. Yeah. Yeah. You wouldn't want to accidentally wake up with like, you know, menstrual blood on your, on your pajamas, like the Godfather when the horse head is in there. You know what I mean? They didn't share a bedroom. They shared a bed room, but not a bet. They had two single beds.

Speaker 11:         01:04:48       Exactly. Like Lucy and Ricky. I think that would, my dad would say, you know, Lucy, I'm home. And he would walk over to the other bed. He would smash, he would probably pump for a while until it got like really close. And then he probably, he slowed down a bit. He caressed her bed, then he started pounding again and then it'd be like, Daddy's coming. And that's what I remember. Yeah. Fuck through a hole in the sheet or no, that's a truce. The Handmaid's tale. That's a true rumor. Uh, a false rumor that that is so pervasive in Judaism that Jews believe it about themselves because the, the, the, the air, uh, refined air of Jew Jewish observance that my dad was at. 90% of American Jews that you've met have no exposure to that in real life. But I do, I mean, I have, I have cousins who spoke, speak Yiddish as a first language and speak English with an Eastern European accent raised here, raised in America, third generation Americans.

Speaker 11:         01:05:42       But they have, they like if you met them, they'd be like, Hello Tom, how are you? Love or whatever it needs to do. They sound like Cardi B talks. Yeah, dude, I have family honestly that I wouldn't be sure that they knew who are raised in New York. I'm not sure. They wouldn't know who the Yankees were. Not Positive that I'm not, I'm not, I'm not joking for sure. They wouldn't know who Cardi B is. There's no, there's no, there's absolutely no question. They would know who Cardi B is. Awesome. I know some Dominicans that, uh, okay, I'm listening. Were born and raised in Washington who don't know who the, the square Rebbie is. Definitely know the Yankees are, but they, uh, have, uh, accents and you're like, you're born here. Well, yeah, yeah, definitely. And heavy accent. You're like, oh, you came when you were 12? And like, no, no, I was born here, but this is it.

Speaker 11:         01:06:33       Yeah, totally. You know, they have a heavy, and they sound yet they have like a Danish. I had, I had a cousin one time when I was, we were in the hospital when my dad was sick and uh, and my dad died eventually. Anyway, I just wanted to tell that story. But no, he goes, he, there's a wheel at the story of him fucking right. Well he fucked my step mom and a death. And that was, I mean he told his dad he would put the jacket. Well, he actually ejaculate. It's so hard. He turned inside out and that's how he died. Yeah. He just kept coming and coming until he wasn't there anymore. But I still have that jar of common. So every, when I need advice, I got it in the talk to it, like raises into a figurine, you know, turning brown.

Speaker 11:         01:07:18       He pops up out of the, out of the thing and just like, what, how can I help you? Nobody. But my cousins come jar. My cousin goes, I, uh, cause he knew I wasn't religious and he didn't have much exposure to people that weren't religious. You know, and there's this thing that happens when someone's sick. Do you have to kind of guard their deathbed kind of, sort of has to be like a religious person there to make sure that all the rituals are done correctly, whatever. So it was very odd because it'll be like me who's next to his dad and then like a kind of tertiary family member who's not really that close to the family, but it's just there to like be a ritual guy. So he turns to me like in the middle of the night and he goes, hi, I have a secret I have to tell you.

Speaker 11:         01:07:55       And I was like, what? He's like, cause you're not religious. I feel like I can tell you. And I go, okay. And he's like, I've always wanted to. And I go out to be gay, be gay. You willing be gay, you're gay, it's okay for gay. I'm thinking to myself. And he goes, he looked, he goes to be a lawyer. Oh that was really big, deep, dark secret is dig deep. That's how religious they are to be a lawyer. It would be like so secular. They only, they only to be rabies is that it there? What are they supposed to do there to work in some, uh, you know, business that the family owns and to study their whole lives. It's like to be a lawyer as to like have aspirations to connect to the outside world. And there's just that. There's nothing there. Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:08:32       Fucking through a sheet though. Fucking through. So you know, the Jews have the prayer, uh, like the, the, the thing that they wear. Have you ever seen it? They Dang, they have the dangling like little fringes. So that's a garment Poncho. Yeah, it's exactly like a Poncho. That's a garment that's a square with a hole in the middle that they put on in the morning. Every Jew, every or the docs who wears though sometimes if they're less religious, they tuck them in. So you don't know that they're wearing them. And if they're more religious, they put them out so that the world knows. So historically those garments would be hanging on a laundry line in the old village or whatever, in the Shtetl. And Non Jews would walk by unaware of what the thing was. They would look and I go, why is there a big sheet with a hole in the middle? Somebody said, oh, they must, you know, the most logical, yeah, those logical things that they must have walked through that hole and then everybody starts to believe it. So much so that like, I would say honestly most Jews, you know that think that think that about them. Their own

Speaker 1:          01:09:25       doesn't party. You though, when you hear like in any religion, like let's talk about, you know, Christianity or Islam, when you think about someone's level of devotion being that high, you're like, man, that is just too much. Oh, give your life to this. I mean, I just go like, but I, I mean I respect someone's dedication to it. I'm like, you're making your whole life about right.

Speaker 11:         01:09:48       I really under beliefs, I really understand it though. Yeah. I really get it because my, I think what it's about is that like the world, if you're not religious, if you're paying attention to the world, it's so obvious that the world is, that life is chaos. It's terror. It's fear, it's people killing each other. It's like meaninglessness. It's careening towards death. It's like it's empty and alone. And religion is this thing that goes, no, no, no, no, no. It's totally meaningful. It's completely, it's completely enclosed. There are answers to all of the questions you think are unanswerable and you don't have to worry. Just join this totality of a religious system and like there isn't any becomes comfort. It's total comfort completely. Of course.

Speaker 1:          01:10:28       I, cause I know it's my mom's pretty pretty religious, you know, not like dedicated in the type of way that your father was, that your child would have a bad life if it wasn't baptized. Love it guys. Yeah, I thought Catholics had a waiting room for that type of situation. But like we're saying like, you know, like my mom prays the Rosary if the, if a car rides longer than 10 minutes. Oh, you a religious, she carries a Bible with her. She doesn't carry a Bible with her. But I mean, you know, she wears a necklace with a bit of a Virgin Mary or something on it. So your mom's house is a church. It's the house of the Lord is the House of the Lord. One thing about her is that like when she does get stressed out, she's a very overwhelmed, it's very

Speaker 11:         01:11:14       anxious. But the only thing that kind of like brings that anxiety down a lot of time is prayer or the thought that like it'll be taken care of. Oh, it works. It's not up for debate whether or not prayer and being religious meditation or whatever the fuck.

Speaker 10:         01:11:30       So these two Jews have a uh, hey, hassle out. It's fantastic. It's the honeymoon standup special. You have to look great. I did a gorgeous, I was eight months pregnant here though. That's fine. Well yeah. Great. Yeah, but you're not that great. I just did it thing eight months and I look a lot bigger. No, no, no. Um, I love how you guys, you both your sets and then you had the Q and a thing that's kind of fun and couples grows.

Speaker 11:         01:12:00       Did talks, does a half hour of stand up than I do have are set up.

Speaker 10:         01:12:03       Daniel Tosh it. Yeah, I dunno.

Speaker 11:         01:12:07       It was weird because he, you know, he's got his own thing. I guess to be honest, I wasn't familiar with his work right then. We just knew it'd be a funny play on words. And we, I'm a Texas by the way. You did it in Austin. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, and yeah, so Natasha did a half hour, I do a half hour and then we do the, this is what we're doing on the road to the last hour, half hour is us bringing couples up and kind of like troubleshooting their relationship and just basically roasting them. Yeah. It's really fun. Thank you.

Speaker 10:         01:12:35       So you toured with that, with this show though for a while, right? Yeah, we uh, we went on a tour and a, it was really fun, as you guys know, do to her together. No, no, he won't. He won't even get a couple's massage with me. That's true. Why will you get a couple of, but have you seen his Netflix queue by the way? That'll explain it. Well, it's the Netflix Queue. It was just mostly things about murder and drugs and shooting and you won't get a massage to a couple's massage. Couple's massage. What? What? Why does it remind you of his murderous now? Because he's a psychopath. This is just part of the ones that have to do with Netflix. Queue is like that but he likes couples miss. Not a psychopath want a couple's massage. He'll pretend like he does but this one is so in tune with that side of himself that he is going to close up the wound.

Speaker 10:         01:13:17       What's the issue though? I'm the, I don't like, I don't like that. Okay. When you go into like a treatment room and you're there, it's like it's all you, you, you, you pull apart, you want to fart and stuff. I mean I do want to force someone to breathe loud. I want to grown and I don't like any other distractions. I don't like, you don't want to hear like, so Christina was [inaudible] that shit irritates me and I don't want to hurt her. I hear you want to be able to like with impunity, slowly move your legs apart and push her to wars and just to do an a silent negotiation to you do it. You have to put your, I don't know, what are you talking about? I figured your legs cause he knows that even talking about massage, how do you ask that? It must be or you want to talk about that?

Speaker 10:         01:14:01       I mean it is it your legs up and scoot your butt down. Okay. I've heard from other people. Yeah, I did not know you did that. I didn't, I but I've heard from other people. Sure. That part of it is like they're doing, they're giving you the massage and then there's like a very, there's this period of silent negotiation where the person will be like rubbing and then they're like sorta errantly like sort of flinger your balls, you know like sorta flick finger like this. Just a light grace and if you close your legs then the person massage, oh this dude likes bodywork. Okay, he's here. He's a legitimate human beings. A little swipe. Then you slightly just a little bit open and then open a little, just a little less because if you turn around and flop out, they're probably going to be like, this is uh, like a cop or I don't know what. Right. So yeah, it's a, there's like a, there's a dance. You don't want to have your legs straight forward.

Speaker 10:         01:14:56       What will the Cummins in the balls or actually it's in a jar filled with my father's ashes. A good drop. What'd you say? How many times have you done this? I've never done it, but I watch a lot of documentaries on Netflix about this. There is, there are a lot of Daca. Yeah, there are. You learn about, anyway, the point is I like traveling with Mosha cause I'll be about, I'll go get a massage, I'll come back a lot more like sort of reasonable and in my, in my, in my mind, I honestly don't know how we'd do it with the child on his birthday. When is it? July six to Seattle and gets available cash or.com we sold out the first show. So there's only shows available for the late show, but it'll be fun. Columbia city theater in Seattle.

Speaker 10:         01:15:46       We're going on a big RV trip with the baby and we're terrified. We're terrified that you bought one. I have one. Yes. Yes. This is awesome. My plan is to just try to not cry, not cry. Hello. This alarm is going to be hard. We're driving from here to Seattle because I have a wedding in a, I'm actually marrying another woman, uh, after my birthday. It's a birthday present for me. Judaism. No for, we're going to drive all the way up the coast like all the way to sat up on the coast. That's a long ass dress. A long. How long? How long is this going to take? We have like 11 days. We'll be good to only drive three hours a day with the baby. Going to be that going to bring a helping hand and he's coming in the RV. I sense you have contempt for this trip.

Speaker 10:         01:16:36       Well, if you can believe it. I'm really into camping and for s and if you can believe this and Natasha's not as into camping. That's hard to believe. It's hard to believe she's a rugged Kinda, you know wild. I've always noticed that about her. She loves hiking, Birkenstocks, her Hilton Garden Inn. We had a severe anxiety flying with our son. I don't want to you bring the car seat. Uh, yeah. You bring everything. You fucking bring everything. You do it alone. Because I was planning on doing that personally. I, there's some women who for, it's like not a big deal. Yeah, the baby's fine. He sleeps on the floor. Not with my kid. He's a boy. He's active. It would give me so much diarrhea, anxiety to do it alone. I can't even imagine if you were the one that shit your pants. I promise. I actually do have so much anxiety when we phone a couple times with them. We've, we've sworn it off now until he's like 10 what's the weirdest thing that's ever happened to you guys on an airplane? So weirdest thing. A memory. It was always something horrible. There's so many weird things that have happened on airplanes.

Speaker 10:         01:17:49       Don't have a great story, but I do have a story. There was a time when I got on a plane, I start flirting with this girl pretty hard, like I didn't know where she was just sitting next to me, and this is actually a very pathetic story, but what ended up happening was we ended up holding hands up to New York and that was the end of the stuff. That should give you a massage after a no. I adjusted my legs open slightly and she didn't respond to that at all on the way to Africa. That's true. That was a long flight and I ate tacos in the Atlanta airport. Bad idea before like a 19 hour flight. Oh, they don't have bathrooms on the African polite pair of panties with me and my carry on. When were you there? Yeah, we flew to Africa together. It seemed like the kind of couple who goes to the bathroom in front of other in front of me.

Speaker 10:         01:18:56       Did you give each other but no brown, Brown, brown a lot. I was a woman. I can't even begin to entertain this, but like as a guy, when you have to Fart, you always had to deal with this problem. I leave the room, you know? I don't think so. This is a central issue. Our listeners care about the topic they want to know about, so hold on. So you're watching a movie, Natasha? I don't know if I, if that's true for me, I'll either hold it. Wow. I mean it's like why do I want to breach that? At this point you're, how many years in six years have you been holding it that long then fart in front of each other? Like friends? Yeah, definitely. Do you fart in front of your guy friends when you're out of the house? I put the girls, don't I do, I don't know.

Speaker 10:         01:20:18       We got to hang out more. I'll get you to start farting. Tell him after an afternoon that closer to the friend. Definitely the more, I mean if it's a really, really close friend, I'll sit on them and fart in his lap or something. If it's a really close friend, I'll slide my dig into him and I was, it's really about farting, but it is that I'm gay and I had a secret that I have that I'm, I'm trying to reveal on this podcast and my wife Natasha. So you never want, even when you're pregnant, you never had to Fart or what do you do when you have to farm it? I didn't, I didn't. Uh, I mean I just, I don't ever have to, you don't ever have to Fart. No. I mean, this is a lot about number two is, well, what do you do when you have to remember too?

Speaker 10:         01:20:58       Mine are white and I don't do that either. Hers or Velvet Velvet, Hawaii, reality. Believe this. Tasha is on brand. It's exactly what you imagined the topic. I know they're white. I never heard that before. But that is because I'm anal sex. That is why they're so white. Yeah, that's a lot. Do you guys think this is funny? Just be honest. I had to do with shit. No, not yet. No, not definitely do it. Shit. Oh, for fuck's sake. Those guy climbing a tree, he's going to look like you just got to treat food. What's he trying to do? He's trimming a tree. A tree trimmer. Okay. It looks unprofessional. It was like a little buddy has some boring shirt. No shirt. He's got the straps in the robe. I don't know. Whatever. You should have like a machine to do that I think. I think you're probably right. I mean that just,

Speaker 9:          01:21:48       Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

Speaker 10:         01:21:52       Moshe thinks that's funny. I don't, I don't think it's funny either. We're kind of the same now and Natasha, why don't you create a real funny, let's talk and I'm over 14 right? Also, I love trees and I know how they should be trimmed, so right away I'm like, so I know there's a man at the bottom of that three screaming and agonist. He's like just saying it was a giveaway, like I knew what was going to happen and you'll surprise I got you. It was, I was surprised. That's a very surprised if that wasn't going to end well. That was a long drop. And the Adelaide, the agony at the, I didn't like the fall, but the screaming at the bottom, that was pretty funny. One more thing. That tree doesn't need to be trimmed. That's what bothers Natasha doesn't need it. See, I'm a big proponent of like, the screams can be funny. Oh yeah. The shout. Oh, you know, can I hear that again? Sure. It did seem kind of good. Yeah, just the end. Good. Alright. That scream. Let's see where is, he sounded painful if I remember. I mean, that guy might not be alive. Yeah. And that makes it even funnier, right? Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:22:55       Oh my God. Hold on. Hold on. What happened?

Speaker 10:         01:23:00       What happened?

Speaker 9:          01:23:03       Go ahead. I don't want to get,

Speaker 10:         01:23:08       he broke a bone that he's hurting. He's in pain. Yeah. He might've popped the liver. I mean, and it's hilarious to my husband. That's what I'm going to have a very refined sense of humor. This is obviously funny. I mean, it is cut this part, maybe my husband, ear to ear. This is the happiest he's looked Tommy. We're having a baby. No smile. Definitely out of a tree. Yeah. So you're going to have two boys. That sounds really hard. You got him to, it's all digital. This is why, but this is why. This is why she's not farting and you're not fighting cause you have girls. Two female dogs, little Pablo are the only male forces. That's why I'm out numbered by dicks and balls and Fart. You got more clips, Tom? I've got all kinds, all kinds of shit. Trying to see some clips. Watch his videos like this all the time. I've got my home pages or are CNN Kook Slam meal on Instagram likes Dr Phil like molestation videos. Why that? Why that is what used to referring to what she's referring to.

Speaker 6:          01:24:30       That's way better

Speaker 10:         01:24:33       not the mothers are like, I don't, I just want your my son because exactly what my reaction was funny was that he was so close to the ground and hurt himself so badly, so badly and the parachutes open like it didn't know what went wrong. I Dunno. It's like he didn't have it fully open. I don't know what's going on with it. Okay. Would you guys marry your mom? Wait, what? You're asking me if I would

Speaker 6:          01:24:55       Mary, my mother? No. No.

Speaker 10:         01:24:57       Why? Because she's my mom. That's, I find that kind of off putting, get around to calling my mom. I mean, let's say, why would you marry your mom? I don't know. I just putting it out there. Are you queuing up a clip right now? Tell her mom and you're my son and I fall in love with him. He said, yes I am. He said, you know what, I was scared to let you know too. I am too. We're both consenting adults. If, if it comes down to it, it's just like the gays there, you know, as long as they're over 18 everything's fine. Yeah. You know what I'm really glad for is that this is subtitled cause they're so stupid that I'm saying, it's like why are they talking to cameras? Like marry your mom. But that's, we thought on this is like just don't tell people that you married your mom.

Speaker 10:         01:25:52       That's why I watch those racism videos on Worldstar with, it's like the old white lady got like, go back to your fucker. It's like the minute be racist, by all means. The moment the person you're being to poles, the camera, it's like walk away, you're going to lose your job, you're not going to work at quickie mart. More enraged. And they are also so used to phones that they don't realize they're being recorded. But he definitely know he's a, he's at an interview. Let me say this about this couple. You know how Wise Cup, teardrop, apple, it's kind of full circle to your ms 13 no, you know, here's the thing. You know how like when you have, when you were single and you would have sex with somebody, you shouldn't be having sex was, it was like a little hotter, right? This is probably so hot. Like when you get to tell mom fucking, I mean, it's probably so hot, right? You know, if you're down because you know it's, it's literally the ultra, the, the, Oh gee taboo. That's true. And it's gotta be kind of awesome.

Speaker 1:          01:26:48       Also led to my favorite listener made songs

Speaker 3:          01:26:51       of all time here. My son, I'm your mom. You're my son. I'm, your mom told me you're asking when you ask them when you see your mom. Oh yes, I would hear my son. I'm your mom. It's just like the gates. Just like the gates

Speaker 10:         01:27:17       fell in love too before they had sex, it sounds like. That's right. What was cool about it? Because they had a relationship from their previous relationship of just being a mother and son. They're able to really communicate openly their desire before they consummated friends for. That's actually,

Speaker 1:          01:27:32       we were so fascinated by this. We found out that there is a common thing amongst, uh, parents, even siblings that are separated for a long time. A lot of times when they're reunited, the feelings are so overwhelming. It can be confusing that they'll shift sometimes into sexual feelings. Oh man, that's so intense. It's very intense.

Speaker 10:         01:27:51       So would you, would you like hook up with your mom? I would rather just to kill myself at this moment right now. Even that have entertained this conversation. Yeah. Even as a bit, yes. Great. Okay. I accept that, but yeah. Oh man, that would be, see you afraid, you know, base it damn these afraid. Do you play this video for every podcast? Not Very podcast a while. Here's one. Hi Melanie. I'm Scotty with ecstatic hearts, Tantra, which just want to share that there are many ways to orgasm. She's acting like he's going to John Waters movie sucks. You can't put that style acting. Yeah, like a over, I just played it cause you're a couple ice. Any sex right now? They're this ever going to Oregon. He just came on on came hug. That's so funny too because not rubbing. Well, I mean it's like in the touch and I had been having sex for years and you've never ever had an orgasm. It's like they're, they're just hugging. That's funny. Oh Man.

Speaker 1:          01:28:53       He like yelling. This just came in. I haven't seen this one.

Speaker 12:         01:29:03       It's this therapy to yelling. It was the primal scream in the burning man I've seen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This doesn't appeal to me because it seems like it would hurt my voice, but I think most of us should do this. Why? Because I think you have more rage than I do.

Speaker 11:         01:29:14       Rage. I don't have any rage. Do you have more than me? Like when you get mad where people park. Oh, that's true. Really? Well, we live across the street for an elementary school and people are always coming to pick their kids up and parking in my driveway. Oh

Speaker 12:         01:29:28       No, no, no. They don't park in his driveway. They parked like two inches out and I kind of plot out a little bit. Blobby he could still get out and I was a school,

Speaker 11:         01:29:37       are y'all done? I go, that's a driveway, and then she's like, this lady was like, well, it's too big. I'm like, I didn't pour the fucking concrete. I didn't establish this property. I bought it and he's yelling this, throw a, and then she goes, she goes, well, I'm just going to go and I go, well, I'm going to call the police. And she was like, go ahead and go. I'm going to key your car. She got back in her car and drove away. No, no. She's picking up her kid from school. What am I going to say? Really respected. [inaudible] name's Maggie or car. One of the great things of greatest minds ever had was I was in in Berkeley. I was going to park and someone cut me off and, and pulled into the spot and the lady was just like walking away and I just go, I said it exactly like this. I go, I'm a key. That car, have a nice time in the bank. I'm a key that car. And I just drove away. Of course I didn't key the car. I went to bed about my day, but I do yell. I'm a key that car, really the street. I just, I loved the idea that there's no possibility she would be in the bank, not freaking out, not enjoying her time. Yeah. And I and I, and that was the price of entry for that. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         01:30:38       That is also the opposite of, you know, spreading love and joy.

Speaker 11:         01:30:41       That's right. It's like spreading that key, that car.

Speaker 12:         01:30:43       That is what I miss about Christianity. I liked that you did it. Yeah. That car, it's good because it's you that car threat, it's menacing, but it's like you just as an empty threat and then you're not going to be, you are fucking her day up, which I like. I loved

Speaker 11:         01:31:01       that. I was just like, okay, now I'm going to go on my day. And at least she got punished for taking that spot. You'd almost be a bitch more pleased with having done that and not even getting the park like I could. Oh No. Yeah I think so. Just feel good about, I would never do that dude. We had a, we had a funny situation. Speaking of conflict cause I sometimes am prone to conflict and uh, we were driving back from the air from lax. We got picked up by an Uber and we just watched, um, we just watched drugstore cowboy wait at midnight, midnight cowboy cowboy. So we were kind of thinking about that. And um, the car, the guy and the Uber, he looked like kind of a professor and he rolled his eyes a moment. He saw. So I should have like known something was up, but I didn't quite, why wouldn't you roll your eyes?

Speaker 11:         01:31:43       I mean just cause what we look like snobs or whatever. I don't know what, what his process was. Whatever we get in the car, I might've been wearing two hats. That's true. Possible. So we're in the back of the car, we're talking about the plot to midnight cowboy. We're like, you know, what was that? Were they gay? Was that a gay love that situation? What kind of analyzing the film and he's Kinda like heroin thing a little bit. Just the littlest bit. And then, uh, it's like an hour ride. We get back to my house and we're kind of, we're kind of going like, okay, Natasha goes, you turn left here because our entrance is not where the, where the address has a, he kind of snaps at her after he goes, like, he goes, I'm a turn left because the thing says to turn left. And I go, all right, stop the car.

Speaker 11:         01:32:23       We're getting out right now. And uh, he's like, I can't stop the car. And I like open. I had already opened the door and uh, and he's like, I, I do that. I pulling over. So he pulls over into our driveway and I, and I'm like, at this point, like, I think I did, he starts screaming, so I pull out your phone. So I pulled out my phone. It was just like click, you know, and I was like, say goodbye to your job at Uber, you know, whatever. And we get out and he's like, cause he, oh, that's right. He called me a jackass. He's, he swore he took it to the swearer zone and I'm like, that's when I started recording. I was like, what'd you just say, be it? I didn't say bitch. Uh, and he's like, he's like nothing. I didn't say anything and he wouldn't give me my luggage.

Speaker 11:         01:33:01       Right. He's like, she's eight months pregnant. At that point, I think it was actually on the way back from the special actually, and he wouldn't give me my luggage and I'm like, give me my fucking luggage to get the fuck outta here. And he's like, nope, no, I'm calling the police don't know why he's calling the police. He goes, you go in the house, I'll give your luggage to your wife. I'm like, I'm not leaving my pregnant wife out of the way. It's because I was being cool. Yeah. Yeah. Super Cool. You know, often people would say being cool would be supporting your husband, not an Uber driver, but uh,

Speaker 12:         01:33:27       just knew what to do to get him to leave, I guess as opposed to like starting to film him and activating him and making him really mad in our drive.

Speaker 11:         01:33:34       Well, he walks out and he's pacing back and forth, calling nine one one. And I'm like, give me my fucking luggage. So I go distract them to Natasha. She's like, what? I leap into the car and pull the trunk open. Now I go to grab my bags. He freaks out, runs over slams the car shot. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         01:33:49       First you told me eight months pregnant to go pop has a trunk. Okay. To be honest, we're all in the front seat.

Speaker 11:         01:33:55       All right. Well we do. And where to be honest, I'm not really in a good mental zone at this point. Yeah. And I popped the trunk. I go to grab the thing, he slams it shut. Finally we negotiate a settlement where he does take the bags out and I'm like, all right, now get the fuck out of my, off my property. And, and he's like, I know way I'm waiting for the cops. I'm like the carbs for what dude? Like what are you going to tell the fucking cops? And he's like, I'm going to tell him that you were, you know you were obnoxious. I go, okay. And, and he's like, know? And I started walking away and goes, and I'm going to tell him that you didn't understand the plot to midnight cowboy. That's really funny. Absolutely. He Won. I will. No question is a consumer knows where we live. That's true. There's no question at that point in the interaction. I was kind of like as a comedian, like you're like, this one's not, this one's yours. You take the w one whites

Speaker 12:         01:34:45       on that. That's fucking I, it's almost unbelievable that he could come up with that. I know. Yeah. He looked like a retired history teacher. He's clearly a set, like he was like 65 70 they so funny.

Speaker 10:         01:35:00       It's almost like if I saw that in a movie, I'd be like, that guy would not be able to put that together. Was funny. It was very much, obviously it was driving the car. As we analyze this film that he clearly thinks he understands more, that he's just going like, oh my God, these insufferable hipster scar in the back. Think they understand this. Just like driving angrily. Maybe he was like a, um, like a film critic or like I bet he taught at La Community College. I did threaten to shoot him. You did? Yeah. As I was walking in, I was like, you better get out of here. I was like, I don't have a gun. I think like, you know, or you know, I'm gonna go get my gun or something. I don't have a gun. There is no group said that to him. I think so. Would you put up with this type of behavior in your yard and my yard, like right in your driver for it not to be on your property so that guy fucking knows where you live. I'd be afraid he's going to come back and Jack me later. I did feel that we got into a fight because I just felt like he was escalating it in a way that my issue is that she should be like on my side.

Speaker 10:         01:36:07       Stranger swears at you and tells you and it's like not giving your luggage. Wouldn't you be fired up when he said when the guy was like, I know when to turn left and then I would have just been quiet about it. Exactly. I wouldn't have been like, let me out of the car and open up the door or what pissed you off about that is what I'm saying. Was it like being disrespected but he disrespected her wife cares. It didn't affect me attitude. Anyway, let's roll the clip

Speaker 13:         01:36:46       me shape pig mediation, dehumanization. Who? Those bottom teeth are just taken away.

Speaker 10:         01:36:59       Um, this is kind of bothering me. Well, first of all, I like a lot about, this is a Bobby Lee character TV and I'm very proud of it. He did say, ah, that's a shit turnover over here. Well, wait, what's bothering you? Uh, first of all I liked, I don't want to, it's very close up, close up. About my, like my, my submission fantasies. I'm not going to shave fully. I'm going to have an extremely shiny face and not, not trim my nose hair framing and the bottom teeth are just so proud cause he's in this like wait, he's looks like he's on the toilet because he can see his shampoo bottles. He is definitely in the bathroom. The cool thing is is that if you need to go to the bathroom, he's okay with that walking on the street shout hey shit. Big stuff. I love that. He goes into a bit of a

Speaker 11:         01:37:56       piece, he goes into a pit of a bit of a character. It goes, if you see me walking on this street, stop me. Go Hey shit. Big. Like it sounded very New York. It did like who watches a lot of movies? Uh, and then I'll come to you. I have latrines. Your pace is just shit and your, your verbal mediation PSL from me. You can shit off of me. It didn't show up.

Speaker 10:         01:38:21       Well it's very expensive to have people come to your house and do that. So he's probably trying to get is extended for free. Cost effective. I like how you, I do wonder if how true this is. Like if I did see dude on the street and I was like, hey shit pig. And then I just shit in his mouth. If he would hit this guy, he's down. He's down. Yeah. Wow. Yeah, I think so. Definitely like $300 to have a woman come over and do that. Yeah. At least. Yeah. Well I don't think there's a lot of women doing the shit pig videos. Yeah. Dominic. No. To come over and shit on you. Oh saying he's doing it to try to get free people to shit on him. Right. But I think he's gay and I think our men, I think it's free in that convenient, but he tells you if you want to meet him, you meet him at the bus station. No, he has a a desert area. Let's not listen to it again. Yeah, he did say that you can meet him at the bus station. What site is this from? A, I don't know. The site that it was pulled from. Please don't tell him. No, I'm just curious what he's in Norway. Oh, so he's not sort of directly available. No, he's not. Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:39:21       We were looking at the by

Speaker 10:         01:39:24       there, it's even not dirty. Boy. He's a bit of an outlier there.

Speaker 11:         01:39:29       Dude. I was in Norway once, uh, and I went to the, they have a comedy show in Bergen and the local comedians found out I was Jewish and we're like really kind of titillated by that. And they're like, oh, come with us, you'll love this. Look, look. And they brought us downstairs behind the comedy club into this basement. And they go, this was the room where they tortured the Jews. I swear. And I'm like, why would you think this is a tourist destination that I'd be like, Yay. And then they pointed up and there were swastikas on the ladder. Ooh. In the balcony across the street. And they're like, yeah, the Nazis were here and they, this room, they would interrogate the Jews and torture them. Like, Ooh, thank you. You like it? Yeah. You are shipping big, right? Yeah, that's a, yeah. It's really intuitive over those guys to show you that? Well, you know, comedians really get human instinct and human and the humanity. So they really knew that that was a thing I would like. Weird.

Speaker 10:         01:40:19       So weird. We were looking at this kid. Oh by the way, have you noticed that? Do you know that some people watch comedy specials with subtitles on? They do sometimes, yes. Okay. Wait, because his mom is deaf, so sometimes we have settings. So that's different. That's totally different. Sometimes our subtitles or just on. Oh, okay. Right. But you're saying something different. I'm saying that we got emails about, this guy was like, I was watching a special with my friend is subtitles were on. He's sitting there laughing at things before they're said, cause he's reading. Right. And, and then he's like, you know, I've noticed that a lot of people are doing it and people

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       who are not hearing impaired. Why was like an odd thing to do? You mean specifically comedy specials or just stuff? Specifically comedy especially. Why? I don't know why they're doing it, but I am of the thought that it's gotta be kind of ruining it a bit. It's like stair step ahead. I'm very used to that because I grew up with it. Something my parents being deaf, but uh, I wonder, I would like to watch my own special with, I mean I can't ever watch one of my own specialist. Definitely. But I talk so quickly that I wonder if the subs had a person, actually I'm telling you there's no way they can get it right. No, no, that dear ms, ms, whatever. They're missing a beat. I mean, they're misquoting, they throw it up. Wait before you say it or, or, or, or it's late.

Speaker 1:          01:41:36       It's not matching up. Kind of fucks it up. Especially if you are, if you are, if you can hear the reason why, why would you do that to yourself? I don't know. I that's bizarre. What's the reasoning? Maybe it's a comedians. You sometimes miss punchlines and so they want to watch it. I guess I, my theory on it was at this guy's doing it because like maybe he goes, he's just like a little anxious and doesn't want the mystery of where does this going to stay like a second ahead. So it's like true. Almost comforts him. It's bizarre. It's bizarre. Hey, maybe we could have them weigh in on our Yani debate. Yani, there's nothing to talk about. We know. What's the other word? The Yani. Yeah, the Piss on me beat me guy. Uh, he's saying I got you. Just a good point. Okay. We'll just wrap up on that. All right, that makes sense. Okay. Um, so this guy, no, we would do it. That's okay. Do you think this is terrible? Um, so this guy is the biggest celebrity that this show is ever created. Okay. He's legendary. He's amazing and he's contributed so much, but there's a mystery as to what he's saying in one part of this video. Okay. Okay. You can give me your version of what you think he say. So I'll just start it off.

Speaker 14:         01:42:50       Black. God's love the fuck. Fuck good. Look if you're a hot black guy and you want to fuck me at 2195 if you want to move in, you can move in.

Speaker 1:          01:43:19       And there it is. Wait a minute. Oh yeah, it's clear what he said. What does he say? A whole minnow. Oh No, no, but that's what I understand that there's a controversy about what he's saying. Right. The last part, the last thing I hear it again. Of course you can hear it. Many times

Speaker 14:         01:43:35       he rented Elisa in the k fuck me piss. Somebody beat me at home, Ya know?

Speaker 1:          01:43:40       See what saying? What do you think he's saying? I'll tell you my version of, and it's, it's, I don't want to taint their opinions and tell me what you hear first because I feel like, well here's the audio, just the audio,

Speaker 14:         01:43:52       all them, Ya know, piss on me. Beat me home. Ya know,

Speaker 10:         01:43:58       I, I ain't got nothing really whole meadow,

Speaker 1:          01:44:02       the right lane. See what I think he's saying is that's been submitted I think cause he, he tells you about what he wants, literally gives his address out. He says, Piss on me. Beat me home here now. And he's in such a frantic excitement that it comes out of here now. Yeah, I'm home here now. I'm home here now. Okay, let me so

Speaker 14:         01:44:24       piss somebody beat me at home, Ya know?

Speaker 10:         01:44:26       No. Oh No, no homie. Now some people are saying, he's saying, whoa man out hollow man out. Oh Man, hold on, hold on. Hold on guys guys. I mean, I know he does. He has an affinity for black guys, but like, he's not really street. It'd be crazy to pivot at the barrier and be like, Hey, hold this man now. Right now. Right. People have said, that's my argument to it doesn't, it's not consistent with the rest of the speech. Now that's so cool if can be this restaurant. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:44:54       By the way, Trejos Tacos. There's so many different versions that people are, I mean, people have said he's saying a homie on out, hold me down. Hollow me out. Um, uh,

Speaker 10:         01:45:07       in and out, like you said. Okay, so this is a clip you found. This isn't actually a person. Oh yeah. People, we found this and it's been talked to him. We don't know that you have his address. Write him a letter and no, but it's really, I write him a certified letter. He's not, there's no way he remembers what he fucking said. That Watson, I'm telling you. Crazy true dude. I tell you what, I challenge your mom's house to write a certified letter with half. You rip a hundred days in. I Dunno. He says it's a drug rip a hundred dollar bill in half. And tell him if he could tell you the accurate answer to this, you will send him the other half of the hundred. There's no way that dude doesn't want the other half of the hundred or actually, if you want to save your money, say that you are a black guy, a black top, but loves the fuck, but one thing he does when he's going to respond to it, I don't think cash is the incentive here for this. Find a big black guy home drive to his house and be like, Oh, I'm here to top you. But first,

Speaker 12:         01:46:04       you know what I love most about him is there's an unwrapped gifts, right? There's the red bow. Oh, there's another light present he has left. Oh and looks like there's another president. It's like his birth.

Speaker 10:         01:46:17       You know what's inside of that present, right? Oh, this was one present. That's the boat of the presence. So he's not that popular, but you know what's inside of it, right? A whole me now. Oh man, that whole minnow. There's so many people that are trying to figure it out. We do it one more time. Just a quick reminder that the, what's he saying? Oh, I'm here now, homie on out hold here down all the different groups of been a tee shirt. Does he know this is the third tee shirt?

Speaker 12:         01:46:41       Yeah. Wait, I'm saying how could you possibly probably

Speaker 10:         01:46:45       not send this guy a letter you have? Well I like pull me out. We have, there's, there's other people that we've featured on this show that we've actually contacted and offered goes, well we'll offer it some substantial money. Much more than a hundred dollars. No they won't. They won't even answer us. Yeah. Sometimes they want to answer sometimes. Uh, what getting like, what's going on? Wait, how many know we've had, we've respond how much and and he was like, go fuck yourself. No, he was like, uh, he basically goes, I dedicated a video to you. Like he dedicated a video to us and that was his response and he got overwhelming like contact from our listeners. Wait, how much did you offer her, this person and for what? What's subsist to interview? Just in it. Just to make fun of him on your podcast. I know. We just wanted to interview him. This guy on it will be a probably a very respectful, like absolute dateline, you know? Wait, so, uh, what did, what did you offer that person? What's substantial money like? Well, yeah, like for over we're over $500 to 500. I mean, I'm just going to offer him $500,000. Half a million. No, but I mean I also was like, or just get back to me with what you want or can I hear it one more time? I'm going to weigh in and finally my final way. The final, your final version. Okay, here we go.

Speaker 10:         01:48:11       Fuck me. Piss. Somebody beat me at home, Ya know, come see me when I come. Come home here now. Don't hold me on out homie on now it sounds like it's today and try it out and try out and wanna fuck a pitch. Let me try it out. She has to apply it only as fuck, man. I'm looking at the hardcore guys and meaning wanting to do it and I want to deliver it. I'm a hot swap. My trash come down. Let's fuck screens over here. I don't think it's, I'm home here now because it doesn't fit with the theme of what he's saying. Fuck me. Piss on me. Shit. It's like he's like, you want to come over? Do you want to come over? You want to come over drugs and forgot what I forgot. Like he's just talking gibberish. That's a very good, that's a very good point.

Speaker 10:         01:48:53       I think you're right and I think you are reluctantly being the lead detective. Well she's got the right jacket for it. Wait, so it's like, oh. So he's going like fuck me, piss on me. Like he almost is doing that. I almost see saying hold me down. But he's saying hold me now or whatever. Right. It's too fucked up mess. Right, right. Yeah. Just got like a bottle of Tequila. He doesn't drink liquor bottle behind it and pull me on y'all. Come on with me on the, y'all holding me on the call. Palm, Ya Know Harlem. It's Stephen Hawking the horn. It's a good point. I feel like it's hollow man out. But you're right. It's inconsistent with their own neonics before calling me on that street. He's

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       not a street. No. I want to tell him Natasha, before I forget. Oh, I'm so bummed for, I was going to do the thing for her, but that you play drunk so well. You're such a great actress and every time I see you do drunk, you think I'm really drunk. No. Yes, yes. Like you. You see you do this in, it's brilliant. Where are you? Don't overdo it like you do it the way drug people really do it or they're trying to hold their shit together, which is so funny and so good. I just wanted to tell you that I've been to a lot of practice. Her Pr, her drunk is amazing. So funny, Huh?

Speaker 10:         01:50:21       Pants less drunk on burning love is truly one of the funniest things up. We laugh out loud. Funniest things I've ever seen. Right. She's kind of like street a little bit too. Yeah. Well she's trash. She what she is. She's calling me on now.

Speaker 4:          01:50:34       Yeah. That's so funny. And your trash boys. Well thank you. Tasha would make funnier ear relatives. I love that too. I like Tata. Thank you. My family. I'm part of, I think what a family is here for is to make fun of them. Yeah. Yeah. Moshe said I could make fun. It does. Does he care if you make fun of him? Tom, to make fun of Tommy? I do all the time on stage. He doesn't care. Is there anything that's off limits? Uh, not yet. You got to make fun of her. Yeah, he does all the time. Talks about my loose Vatche my big floppy tits.

Speaker 10:         01:51:06       Oh yeah. You're loose badge and big floppy disk. It is. Tom Tells me first. It's not like, it's like we have a quarterly. What's so what's your, what's your off limits? We got no lines. No, they, when it comes to the stage, there's no lines for sure. Right? Yeah, exactly. Well, I'd like to have, I, I'd like him to not say negative things about me and I'd like to say negative things about him. I'm sure vice versa. But I mean what in interpersonal communication at home I'm brittle and I have a hair trigger. But if she gets on stage and makes fun of my deaf mom, it's all good to trades or no, no. I will say though, the way Moshe acts with people, with their cars and with Uber people, he doesn't do that to me. No, that's good. Yeah you will say that. Huh?

Speaker 10:         01:51:46       You will say that. Cause that's what I coached you to say on the drive over here. But it's what, I don't want people to think that he carries that into our relationship. I know how unstable it seems. I am. I just have a thing about being disrespected and it's not good and I don't like it that I disrespect you sometimes, but you don't act like that. Yeah, but it's not people that I know disrespecting me. It's like strangers. It's different. It's way different. I'm getting better. I'm a lot better than I used to be. I believe it's called righteous anger. That could be

Speaker 4:          01:52:11       right. But this is a dude thing. Let me tell you though, cause I know that you had fucking choke a man out for snapping at me like that too. I think, uh, it's just, it's like, dude, it's testosterone. I did Tasha. I know you're right. And I also didn't look at it like he was protecting me because it seemed like he was endangering our family because of your volume. She was letting people know where we live. The guy might have a gun, like why go there?

Speaker 10:         01:52:33       I did analyze and uh, I decided he did not have a gun. I mean they were probably correct. We're no, remember he had like a weird pace maker, a wire coming from his neck. I was like, I could just grab that and Yank, you know. And he's just,

Speaker 11:         01:52:46       you just unplug them. Yeah, like commander data.

Speaker 12:         01:52:51       But it's also the testosterone that sent Moshe into a rage where he thought it was a good idea for me to climb pregnant. Eight months pregnant into his, the guy's front seat without his permission. And when Moses did it, the guy goes, are you fucking car? But like, he was so pissed. So it's like I almost did.

Speaker 11:         01:53:06       Right, but if you had done it, I would've been back at the trunk. I would have grabbed the whole main out and gotten the fuck out of there.

Speaker 1:          01:53:12       He said, are you my fucking car when you went to pop the trunk?

Speaker 12:         01:53:14       Joe, she'll get into, his friend was all he wanted me to. He told me eight months pregnant to, to, to slither my way into the guy's car. Cause the guy was saying was holding our luggage hostage in his trunk.

Speaker 11:         01:53:26       Yeah. I love this story.

Speaker 1:          01:53:29       I liked the design. Are you on? Well, here's the thing. I definitely understand both sides of it from him. I definitely get as a father though, what would you have done without a father at this point? Yeah, that's true. I understand you feeling like, I feel like it's almost like a very, very defined male female storyline because you're, you're being, you're being composed, you're being rational. You're, you're thinking ahead. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         01:53:53       Trying to make it go faster. Well, annually.

Speaker 11:         01:53:57       Do you use our intelligence to get out of potentially physical on the island? Just use my brute strength, right. Sort of gorilla, I'm out of my driveway. But it should be because men size each other up right when you get into it. Right.

Speaker 12:         01:54:10       Did size up this handicap 70 year old with like an old suit on with a, you know, elbow what he did, he really did. He did. It was like, I could probably win this. I, you probably wouldn't have done that with like a guy who was like, look like he could kick your ass.

Speaker 11:         01:54:23       That's the great hypocrisy of like, I just can't stand to be disrespected because if the motherfucker was like a thugged out like six foot eight body filler, I would have been like, all right, listen man, um, uh, I'm sorry. And anything I can do, I don't understand the plot to midnight cowboy. I'll tell you,

Speaker 12:         01:54:39       just say that the woman he yelled at who had his car, their car, it was like a, I'd say 65 year old white woman would, he told the woman you were like, Oh, my key, your car. Oh, you weren't there. I will.

Speaker 11:         01:54:51       She was. And so I felt like I could take her, but see, that's, yeah, but that's,

Speaker 1:          01:54:55       we almost the only people who don't think about who they're saying things like that too are literally crazy people. Right. That's why they're crazy, right? Because they're like, yeah, I'll say that to the fucking six, five, you know, 300 pounds. Like, yeah, dog barks like dogs that are way bigger than you. They don't know what they're doing. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, it's how you stay alive. That's ape shit. Like literally that's ape shit. That's what monkeys do. So ultimately we'll get out of my little jungle area. He helped out because, you know, he felt threatened, uh, disrespected and I totally agree.

Speaker 12:         01:55:26       I understand that you understand that. But ultimately in this court

Speaker 1:          01:55:29       side, are you on, well, Hey, I,

Speaker 11:         01:55:34       I'm on her side as a survivor of the feminine instinct is to be like, let's not start some crazy shit. Let's just go get inside. I mean,

Speaker 1:          01:55:41       when I'm vulnerable. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

Speaker 11:         01:55:44       I, but the thing is like, I identify with what he thinks because done it depends on it. He might've done it. It depends. It depends. I mean I think the older I get now, like you said, being a parent, I do think about things like that. Like my behavior. Um, you know, my incidents or have gone way down, way down. I mean, right. You got admit that you buy people suing me. Taking my money. Yeah, totally. Therapy. This is therapy for us. I love it. Oh yeah, I've been a oh yeah. I mean I'm not like an angry dude. I have a weird thing about strangers disrespected. It was like a child thug reverts back to like, I've got a little on the streets, right? I've got a little part of, of my from Oakland. Where are you from? I'm just kidding. It's a fun area for me. I don't mean to say you were from the town. I'm from the town and I, and every kid in Oakland thinks that they're like a thug. Obviously. I'm not an idiot. I know what I look like. It's not like I think I actually strike fear, look like [inaudible].

Speaker 11:         01:56:52       I don't even know who he is. A rapper too short. Anyway, but there is a little part of me, Natasha calls it old motion. That's what that's her name for that get that character. It's still there. It's still just a little, and it doesn't comport to who I am. I'm obviously, I mean I get that I'm a little hipster fob but uh, but it just comes out anyway. And I said to Natasha and me and my friend Jacob joke around about this, anytime I mentioned the fact that I grew up in Oakland, I'm in a very bad psychic zone and I need to like, if I'm in conflict with a stranger and I say, oh, I grew up in Oak, I'm from Oakland, I got to go like, yeah, I'm in trouble. That's the trigger where that's how, you know what, I've reverted deeply into my old persona recently.

Speaker 11:         01:57:33       I won't go into the whole thing. It was too long. But recently I was disrespected by somebody and I had homicidal fantasies. I was sitting there and I, I imagined myself beating him so badly with his head exploding against the cement. It was very satisfying to go there after the feeling all the rage. But I just left. I left the situation. I fantasize about people dying. I don't care how they die. I just want them out of my life. By the way, I, the last time I got no fear, let me go into a physical fight. Like A, I don't know. I can't remember last time I got in a physical fight, uh, probably 10 years ago. That's kind of a recent two recent two recent. Um, but, uh, I was really ashamed of myself.

Speaker 11:         01:58:20       Yeah, probably. I have a whole bit about it in my first special. Were you working like, or like, you know, on the road I was at, I was at a comedy show. It's a whole thing. I don't want to do bits because there's so many bits in it, but it's a whole thing. How it literally couldn't have been funny or was that a Hanukkah show? I had a drill in my hand, like I disrespected me. I literally threw the Dreidel at his head. That's how the conflict began. The traditional Jewish way to start a fight. And we like went outside and I, I won the fight. Uh, but, uh, you are being hired by a comedy club. I don't love the incredulity and your voice. No, I always had a, it was at a show at the Edinburgh Castle in San Francisco. Uh, it was like a bar show before you were like a touring comedian.

Speaker 11:         01:58:59       It might've been just before I, yeah. It might've been just before I was a touring comedian. That would've gotten back to your agent then. Maybe it was more than 10 years ago. Maybe it was too. Yeah, it was probably 11, 11 years ago. Yeah. Something like that. But, uh, you guys swung on each other. Yeah. So fun. It was a whole thing. Where you, so you never watched my special? No. Ouch. Uh, there was a whole thing where like, he was in a show who's disrespecting the performers that used to really make me mad when there'd be somebody disrespecting another performer while they were on stage. And so he laughed and I started to applaud when he finally left the room. He's like being loud and obnoxious. And then he said some shit to me through the dre Latam classic and then he's like, come outside.

Speaker 11:         01:59:42       So I ran outside. I didn't know what I was doing, but he uh, everything, it was kind of weird actually because he had a third friend and um, and he, he is, it was me, the guy and the third friend and then, and then Brent wine, Bach top kid. Yeah, the last person you need to lock up your back. Let's talk some shit. Yeah. Talks to see. Exactly. Uh, so it was kind of weird actually because we were going back and forth, you know, yelling at each other and then things are calming down a bit. Like I got control of my senses. I was like, look, I'm not trying to start a conflict. You were just being super disrespectful in there. Everything was kind of calming down. And the third guy who was like playing the mediator was like, it's all good. Let's just calm down.

Speaker 11:         02:00:20       All of a sudden at the end of the whole thing, as things were about to like be over snatches my hat off of my head and he's like, that's a cool hat. I mean, as I used to say in the, in the bay, this was a line I dropped. I go, look, I'm not black, but I'm black enough that if you grab my hat off my head, we're going to fight. And uh, so we did, we like ran outside and the dude I had been training, like doing boxing training for like a year at that point. And it kind of interesting. I never threw a punch at the guy like, which has come, I think of that as like, maybe that's good. Like maybe if I punched the guy, like, I don't know, something could, a bad could have happened. But what ends up happening, we started wrestling around and I like, like kind of when a headline, I've got him in a headlock and I like choked him out.

Speaker 11:         02:00:59       I literally like, he literally tapped like, oh, and uh, and, and at the end of it, you know, and he goes, I go, are you done? Are you done? And this is from the bay. I go, are you done? Are you done? And he goes, I'll never be done. It's like I'm fighting a night. I'm fighting at night from the roundtable end. He finally, everything calmed down, everything conflict over end of thing. There's a whole thing where he had cut me and also bled on me. So it was like, I was like, and he looked in that moment as I looked at his body, I'm like, Oh wow, you're like, you are a gay heroin user. Like everything about the moment there was blood. I was thinking to myself like, oh my, this dude is like, was he around the same age as you? He probably was, but smaller. Like I hate that fucking disrespect to the other performance man. Almost got in a fight at the three clubs. Yeah, totally. Yeah. This lady was sitting in the front and it was the, there was two shows back back to back shows and she was like, yeah, and like

Speaker 1:          02:01:58       talking over people. And I was like, and so I was, I wasn't on that show. So when that show ends, people leave. She stayed and then I went to host the second show and she started to do it. But because I was so worked up from watching her, I immediately was like, shut the fuck up. And somebody was like, don't talk to her. Like, ah, you're the asshole. Like, Hey asshole, I've been here. And she said something anyways, I call her a cunt. [inaudible] people were like, whoa. And I'm definitely like,

Speaker 11:         02:02:23       just super, what is the occasion? Is it, it's a showcase. Is it a Montreal showcase? A showcase that I'm, I'm not showcasing, I'm posting for them for the other comments and I'm so mad that she's ruining this for them. It's funny though, is that the guy who was going on first, I was mad at you. Like why is he ruined it? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:02:38       I know they weren't, but then somebody was like, some woman goes, don't say that to her. That's my friend. I go, that's your friend. Then you're a cunt too. And then people got up and left. Then the show kind of actually started to kind of go together. Well the friends, the friend who was like, that's my friend. Her son walks in with a backpack. Anybody who goes out with it

Speaker 11:         02:03:02       backpack, that's bad news right there.

Speaker 1:          02:03:04       And he was like, just staring. He was like, cut, talk to you for a second. I was like, all right. And I go outside. He's like, you called my mom crying and I go, who's your mom?

Speaker 11:         02:03:16       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:03:18       any points to like the friend. I go, I didn't really, I didn't call her. And he's like, yes you did. You said Blah Blah Blah. He's like, I want you to apologize to my mom. And her mom's mom was like looking all like up at me. Like, you know me can, she was like, what happened? Why were you so angry? I go, cause your fucking friend is tea. They're like, well she's been drinking and this and I go, exactly like get her outta here. And it was, we have this whole thing and I go, all right, I'm calling now. I'll say this. Sorry, I said that to your mother. I'm not sorry. I said it to her though. [inaudible] and they were like, okay,

Speaker 11:         02:03:50       fair enough. They shook on it. Yeah. And the kid you could see like he was like, he was so fired up that I had said that. And then he just kind of like, it's so funny too, cause it's like conflict. It's so ridiculous. It's like the guys like mad, like you said the word to my mom. Like what? In what? Who Cares? Really get your car and drive away and you're right. I have no defense other than this. At the end of that fight, I was like so ashamed of myself. Like I was as I like, the whole point of that bid is that you can't really win a fight as an adult because even if you win, you still feel like a loser. You know, you're not, you don't get that triumphant like playground feeling anymore. That's not available after 30. Uh, but my friend Jessie, who, who I grew up with, a kid I probably got into a lot of fights with when we were in middle school.

Speaker 11:         02:04:35       Um, it's like the, at the end of the day, like we're all a society and humanity is real but it's also an illusion and a mythological, like a fake thing that we're living in. In reality we're all like monkeys were, were, were Simeon with testosterone and we're just like, it's amazing that we don't come at like sometimes there's just so many people around each other that it's inevitable and in Vr that conflict will occur between two males and you just have to hope that your developed enough and enlightened enough to avoid that, that you don't like die. Yeah. Yeah. Just hates your mommy and Daddy. That's probably where the rage comes from. Do you think so? I that I don't, I think at a certain, at a certain point, at a certain point, like avoiding conflict as a skill and an unnecessary one and one that I'm working on in a much better at than I used to be.

Speaker 11:         02:05:26       But at a certain point like there is just a, there is a, there is a testosterone, a chemical reality that when two males are in the same zone and they're challenging each other, like it's difficult for there not to be conflict there. It's possible to not be physical conflict. And that's not about like, no, that's not about your mommy and Daddy, but your wiring, that shit when you were growing up and you're like, people used to fucking get on me, dude. Like that's like your primal, that's your, your blueprint for the rest of your life. That's always going to be a trigger. You know what's really fucked up about being good at avoiding conflict is you don't feel like a winner. It's not like when you walk away all peace and love like brother, it's all good. Like you owe your lifestyle. I'm a bitch.

Speaker 11:         02:06:08       I just, Oh, and if you, so if you fight, you're an animal. If you lose your, if you acquiesce, you're a bit as hard to be happy. I get that. But I also think you can feel like the enlightened smarter one who avoids things. You can and you still feel embarrassed or I still feel it. Even when I'm in La. I recently had a conflict with it, with a person very recently. Uh, this isn't like a stranger person. This is a person who was like trying to get my goat and talking shit and I, and he was at such a low kind of area in his life that I could have like really kicked a man while he was down. Yeah. I mean, it's very easy for Comedians to do that. And instead via Natasha and some other people searching, I was like, you know what, I'm just going to like walk away from this and just like check out of this interaction. And in the end I felt like, damn man, you know, I had all these good comebacks. So it's like, it's hard to even feel like you win. It's gotta be hard cause you're close with Brent [inaudible].

Speaker 11:         02:07:00       They're low frequency and they're drunks at your show. Like it's fucking drunk. Pops off dude. I get, I see red. Like I want to fucking kill you. Relish children. I want to fucking kill you. Let's say you have to remind yourself like, this person's life is so shitty that they started drinking at whatever time they came to the show. They're, you know, they're sabotaging. That's something to remember about the Internet too is like the people that are in common with me on the Internet, just everybody's upset. What does the jeans, I know what it is. So what's wrong mommy? No nothing. Let's remind people that, uh, the specialist on Netflix, if you haven't seen, it's fantastic.
