I don't know why you didn't watch. You haven't done that shit. Like on the road, the gripe had a fever of like 102 and performed or like violent diarrhea and then they call your name no sick. One time I went to, um, my doctor, our doctor, Doctor Dick, who people know from my stand up. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:10:55       I was so sick. And he, he, he looks, you know, doctors, when you go with a cold, the check out your notes, check out your ears, he goes, woof, you got an ear infection bad and your left ear when I go, so what do I, what can I do? I have a Gig. I still remember I was playing in Indianapolis to Planar sometimes cause you can't, you can't go. And I go, I gotta go. Cause I used to have the mentality that like, yeah, your health doesn't matter. Yeah, you go right. Your show is number one. And he's like, well I want, he goes, I'm putting in the file that I told you not to travel. And I go, okay, I'm going. I go, is there anything I can do? He goes, well, yeah. Um, so in your left ear, so if you get a left window seat, um, when your eardrum ruptures, it'll go all over the window. You could do that.

Speaker 6:          00:11:49       I got it. Thanks. [inaudible] you asked me what you could do. Yeah. And then he gave me a steroid shot, you know, it helped. It was, now he put that in my head, the rupturing and that whole flight, it felt like it was building right to the end of, yeah, I could feel the pressure growing. And I was like, ah, ah, ah. You know, and then I mean I performed that week. I couldn't hear, I couldn't hear myself. I couldn't hear it through the monitors and the speakers. I remember I did radio and when I left radio I got up. Somebody else sat there for a segment and he goes, uh, hey, is your hearing okay? And I go, why? He goes, these headphones are so fucking loud. And I go, I can't hear shit right now. It was

Speaker 9:          00:12:33       the word. Remember that weekend I remember telling you not to go.

Speaker 6:          00:12:37       But that was also the, that was also the time where I thought if I don't, not only why like not work again, but I also need this money. You know, it didn't need it bad enough. Right. But it was like it would have made a difference.

Speaker 9:          00:12:51       Yeah. That's a time in your career. You don't realize you can just cancel it. Staff if you have to. You have your second, you're dying. I actually had to cancel one thing. I did have a legitimate illness. Remember a booker doubted my how sick you were and I was like, Bro, trust me. You don't, you don't light heartedly cancel a week. Like

Speaker 6:          00:13:08       there was that flight. I puked on the whole, the whole flight. And then I spent the night there puking and then flew back and then they gave me like, so what

Speaker 9:          00:13:17       going on, right? Yeah. Do you think, yeah. Like look at my track record. Do you think that the kind of person that I just go like, well that's why we're so reluctant to cancel because these assholes do go like, yeah, oh, come on man. Are you really bleeding out of your ass or what's happening? I don't think so. You can still perform. Come on. Monkey dance. And you're like, no bro. Yeah, I know. Hey, I remember the guy was like, you cancel on me last second. I got, I'm throwing up and shitting. I'm on both ends. Yeah. Puked that. Sure. Flight. I've gotten sick in a Boca Raton. I did the New York City Comedy Club. It used, it's no longer there. Uh, it was a front for something else, I'm sure. And I had a fever of 102 and a flu and I was like shaking and performing for a bunch of blue hairs and I was so horrible. What I do it like I should've just stayed home. I don't even know if I got there and I was sick or what, but oh, that's the worst man. You can't even remember. You don't, I'll never do that again.

Speaker 6:          00:14:16       So now, um, we have a blue band on Mike. Just a little, uh, introduction to some people listening.

Speaker 10:         00:14:24       Uh, I was always fascinated by the Jewish people. They seem to be everywhere. They have a lot of power and influence in this world. Although lighter skin shoes like to claim to be white when it's convenient for them. Jews and whites are in fact very different.

Speaker 6:          00:14:40       Would it be known that blue band put this file in our folder for this show? This is the, this is the girl who got kicked off of Youtube. Yeah. For Making Hitler wasn't that bad.

Speaker 7:          00:14:52       Yeah. So this guy re uploaded on it. Something from somebody else. Yeah. Oh good. Well let's learn more about it.

Speaker 10:         00:14:58       109 countries throughout history, so they have picked up on all kinds of various genes. In this video, I'm going to teach you guys how to properly identify who is of Jewish descent because Jews particularly are so mixed. It can be very difficult to identify who exactly is a Jew. I like the little girl

Speaker 7:          00:15:19       she is. That makes it extra sweet the way she does it. Do you think Ari Shaffir ears? Aries is so fucking on point with Gigi. I know all of these guys look like Ari. Here's how saying here's how Jewish looking Ari is. Yeah. I could tell somebody, hey, meet me at the staple center. Right. Um, but first meet, I want you to get Ari and bring them down to our seat. Right. You know, they're like, who's that? I'd be like, he looks real Jewish and they'd be like, come on. And then they would walk up the Ra and be like, I found them the course. He's an exemplary ju. Yeah. Not under the radar at all. So it's just so exciting because now this opens up Jew jokes in a whole new way for us. Yeah, sure. I feel like we couldn't really go far now. Yeah. Yeah. This is a well, can we see how a new identified you? I'm sorry. Sorry. Um, she, uh, so anyways, this girl has been kicked off of tragically, tragically kicked out. Hmm. Let's see.

Speaker 10:         00:16:21       More Jewish. Glad somebody has, the easier it is to spot them to successfully, you have to examine all of their facial features. You have to look at their facial shape, eyes, mouth, and listen to their voice. People with Jewish glad always have more than one Jewish feature. I personally look for three or more features to the side. If somebody is Jewish, three or

Speaker 7:          00:16:41       more. Um, one thing Jews. Oh, nearly all Jews have naturally curly and coarse hair. This is due to being in a mixed with negroid blood. No boy, more Jewish jeans. The darker there. Harris Jewish men tend to have chorus beards. You know, we're about to find out. We both have a, what I call Ju Ju rumors. Tumors in our family. Yes. We may have a Jewish blood. So we did the DNA testing 23 and me, it takes like six to eight weeks and we're gonna find out 40 parties. Yes. We both have juniors in our, do you really have a tumor? Yeah, absolutely. From the code of the Spanish descent that there's, um, no Spanish too. Yes. All right. God Sephardic, sorry guys. I know my juice. Hello? Whatever. Um, there's the other type of Joe Has Siddiq nope. Tom Ashkin. Ari. Oh, she figured that would be your fucking line right there. Yeah. That is a shift. Or you're a Jew. Yeah. Um, my mother thought she was a Jew, so we'll see. Okay. Um, this is uh, quite the video. Yeah,

Speaker 9:          00:17:51       I think I'm pretty, yeah, pretty full on it actually. She has, she, she's like, I personally like to go with three. Wow. Oh really hate the Jews. It's so weird. Yeah. There's a few that aren't too fun. I never understood this one. Uh, me too man. The other races, it's so easy to process. Oops. But the, what are the Jews? The don't do anything except to be successful in proximately. All Jews have naturally curly and coarse hair. She's going to read now what I just read. I mean every other group that you spot, you spot the hair. Yeah. Oh my God. A classic ways. Looking at the nose. This is so racist. It's really that and look at her. I liked the drawings and that drawing looks like Ari. Yes. One thing that kind of sweaty and greasy cause like ori eyebrows arch. This is not happening.

Speaker 9:          00:18:51       We got a lot of stories. That's really good. Wow. Thank you. Thank you. Blue van, Betty free. Dan, I didn't know she was a here. So jeans, a lot to cover today. Two genes. Genes. What do you have for me? You have something, there's a lot in our world. Where do we begin? I mean do you want to start off with, let's just do some personal news first of all. So the other day you and I, well this was actually last night, I was in the bathroom. You were in the baby's room and we both burped at the same time. Yeah. That was really weird. And different rooms and profit and it just kept together. Yeah. And I, and I asked you, I go, what time, what does that call, cause you famously named the double pipe classic. Yeah, that's true. And I know people give you credit for that.

Speaker 9:          00:19:49       I appreciate you. I appreciate you for saying that. Yeah. When, so lovebirds burp or fart in different rooms without seeing each other. It's called synergy synergy. I feel like that is what we have. I mean mine, I was just walking out of that room and then I write yours at the same time and we fired it at the same time too. Unprovoked. That's cause you have to be really connected to somebody for that to happen. It's like when you pick up the phone to call someone and they're on the line, you're like, what are you doing? And they're like, I just fired it. I thought about you. Yeah. So synergy now synergy. Neat wine is interesting too. It led to yesterday. You, I've never, I could, I thought this was a magic trick. You smelled my beard and you nailed what I had for lunch.

Speaker 9:          00:20:46       But I mean to a t, right? So we both have our talents, Tom. Yeah, but my beard, so my beard normally just smells like farts. Right? Like whenever I eat something that smells like garbage parts but, but so garbage and fire, it says accurate. Yeah, I came home. But right now it's a little more trim when the, the bigger it gets, the more, obviously it's, it's really, uh, traps, the traps things. Yeah. So I think you go to kiss me or something and you go, you hold my face. You're like, you had at first I go, that's a guest. And you start listing the details. You got, yeah, you had garlic chicken, you had onions, you had rice, black beans. I'm like, what? And then you go and you had planned tans. What? You nailed it. I know. I mean that's the exact meal ahead.

Speaker 9:          00:21:37       I know. We went to Versailles. A Cuban place. Yeah. And you named everything that I ate. Thank you. The thing is is that I, you know, I don't know if I can do a blind smell. Yeah. But if you give me an area, cuisine, I can tell you which items you ate. Uh, just off the smells. It's unbelievable. Yeah. The smells. Usually this, the strongest ones are right around your mouth. You tend not to wipe that clean enough. No, I'm serious and I can really smell what you ate. What do you mean? I tend not to wipe out really clean. You're not like a hygienic. What? The person that's so wrong and misleading. You're a liar. I'm not hygienic. Not really. What your beard always smells. That's life. My beard smells like life. It doesn't smell. I like, I am hygenic that smells like go ma.

Speaker 9:          00:22:25       Meaning that he would say that it's not true anyways. They're not anyways. I am hygienic. Not really. Like, what do you mean always in your beard? Is there a product we could buy that would get the food smells? I think I can take a shit on your fucking face while you're sleeping. I think it's called soap. If you used soap on that beard, you're such a liar. Oh, by the way, I'd like to thank you. I didn't get a chance to, but thank you so much. Uh, you left a like a poop smear as a bottom of the ball this morning. Yeah. And it was a nice surprise when I went to go pee to look down and there was like a layer of fresh shit. Do you think that was, what was that from, do you think? I think it's from your turn and you didn't flush. You just left. You left like the poop cart drove through and left streak. Yeah. Well that happens a lot. It was heavy. That happens.

Speaker 8:          00:23:20       Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:23:22       Yeah. Hey, this is another clip. I'll say different things to different cause a different clip board. If it's, that was not the same clip. Uh, that was fun. That was fun. I enjoyed that. Very, you know what made me laugh hard this weekend is when you came in the room. Yeah, you're right. I think it's time to admit it. You Go, I have IBS. Do you really? Yeah, it's been 10 years. I've been telling you that something's wrong, something's wrong. And you're like, it's an, everyone has diarrhea all day, every day. I'm like, no, something's wrong. It's in your act. It's in your fucking act about how you shit. And I'm like, do you need to go to the hospital? That's real. Right. So what, what's the tipping point for you that you find

Speaker 6:          00:24:39       somebody else talking about it and they were like, yeah, you know, if I eat that, you know, I'm going to just shit.

Speaker 9:          00:24:47       It's going to be pretty immediate. And you know, I have IBS. That's how I think every day. If I eat that, I'm going to shit everywhere. So magic three, three syllables, three letters.

Speaker 6:          00:25:02       Yeah, I'm, so then I started to do some research and I was like, I got this. And then I started to Google treatments and we started to read the things you should eliminate and you go, you eat all those things.

Speaker 9:          00:25:19       It was like chocolate, caffeine, artificial sweeteners, carbonated drinks, fried food, like everything that was on there, I'd be like, yeah, that's an Asus rotate. Every day you wake up, the first thing you do is throw some sweetener and some coffee and then it's sugar parade and then it's crap. And then it's so does [inaudible] all day long. Yup. Yup, Yup, Yup. Any other buddy? So are you going to go to Doctor Dick?

Speaker 6:          00:25:50       Doctor Dick? Yeah. Maybe I'm going to, I'm going to go to this food specialist that he, food allergists person that he recommended.

Speaker 9:          00:25:57       You're going to start, they're going to start this. I read somewhere that there's two blood tests you can take that will determine if you have IBS and then we can medicate you. Or maybe you could just not eat sugar and caffeine all day every day, you know? And there's that option.

Speaker 6:          00:26:14       Yeah, I mean the thing about me is I always, I'm alert. I would say I'm a quick learner

Speaker 9:          00:26:21       and something happens to me. Not at all.

Speaker 6:          00:26:25       6,000 Times I'll pick up on that, you know, and I'll be like, I'm going to do something about that. So that's, I finally, I figured it out way faster than most people.

Speaker 9:          00:26:34       Yeah, you're not, you know, you're not big on cause and effect.

Speaker 6:          00:26:39       So now we know I'm not big on hygiene and not big cause and effect.

Speaker 9:          00:26:44       It takes a while. Got It, got it. So that was kind of neat that you finally admitted to having a stool problem. Yeah. Now when you, you said that there's red in the bowl too, right? Is there a red, there's red. How often? How often is there red? There should be no red. Sometimes there's red, like a not looking again for me once fool me once. Shame. Oh, not everybody for me twice. I'm not doing it yet. Okay. So No, I'm not, I'm not even going to look over there. I'm going to look at the people at home. Watching people at home was, there we go. Um, I'm not looking. I know what you fucking frozen. I didn't freeze it on anything. Yes you did. I can see in my peripheral vision cause I've perfect peripheral vision is probably on her barfing and I know that it's not. Yes it is. No, it isn't lying. I know you're lying because you're laughing. You're like blind person right now. They're like play the piano.

Speaker 9:          00:27:47       Okay. Can you please come back to the show? I am on the show. You can take away the still of her barfing and then I'll return to the shell. Not Looking. All right. Do you see how I got you? I got it. Yeah. Are we done? Yes. Yes. May I bring up another item? Another one of your movements is, um, I like these notes that I keep on our lives. So I think we should play a game where I smell your beard and guess what you've eaten today. That should be a segment on the show. I was thinking about that. Maybe he's pretty good and you can try to trick me. We took a shower again, so we resumed our marital shower takings together.

Speaker 9:          00:28:50       So horrible. And you had boogers hygienic, everything that day. Anyways, we were in the shower briefly this time. I don't make the same mistake of showering with you the whole time. So I was getting out and you came in just as I was about to leave and I am standing there and I smell what smells like somebody just dumped an entire container of coffee in the shower like somebody took, I don't know what that is. Correct. And just it's so pungent, like black coffee and I looked down and your p is like Brown. It's so thick. Like do you think you could drink water today, dad? I mean you complain about dog, but it smelled so strong. You said that. First of all, I've always been a big water drinker. Oh Book Shit I have. I've always your water now it's right behind you. Shit.

Speaker 9:          00:29:51       That's my one or liar. I've always been a big water drinker for from the day we met. I've been somebody that has a bottle of water on them all the time. And since that day I thought about it and I've been balancing water to coffee more. You really need to. I have been. That's my point. Smelled exactly like fresh brewed coffee. We should measure who drinks more water in a day. I, I do in a second. I think it's me more than two to one. No, absolutely not. I hydrate so much more. Okay. That doesn't mean anything because I'm prepared for the show. I knew I got it just means you have one right now. Hour and a half of water. I dehydrated and I hydrate. Same. Oh my things, Lee, Bro. That's what I do. Wow. That's what I do. You're going to lie like that. That's the truth.

Speaker 9:          00:30:38       That's not the truth is the truth. I drink more water than you and then I got a backup water that I keep here just in case the primary is not there. Don't even drink water. You don't even drink water. Get your life compared to me. You better get your life liar. You don't drink water. Seriously. Wow. That's how little you drank. Okay. All right. We'll see. Why don't we do a water challenge? I'll fucking challenge you right now, Bro. Okay? Okay. Let's do this. You'll see how much of your water hell to the, no, seriously. Why don't you love her? You want to, why don't you get your own Goddamn fucking bring one. So drink my old ass water. He may get their fresh fresh one. Know your why. Smells are all over. I like, I've even wash your beard since yesterday. Since you ate Versailles, please God, give me the old one. I don't trustee you steal it from me now I have more. You're the worst. Stop it.

Speaker 7:          00:31:38       You're the baby.

Speaker 9:          00:31:41       No. What am I going to do for the whole show? Have plenty of water. You got water in your hands. Me. That's not enough shit head. You're the worst. Hope your IBS gets even crazier shit in your own beard.

Speaker 7:          00:32:05       So great.

Speaker 9:          00:32:08       I had a really interesting question I wanted to ask too. I never know what it is with you. Go ahead. Okay. I remember a long time ago, first of all, we haven't even played the song to let people know that we're talking about Brown. It's kind of, it's a little late for that. Why don't we save that one? Okay. But I have a really important question I needed to pay attention to me right now. Really important. So remember when I asked a long time ago,

Speaker 7:          00:32:40       where's this going?

Speaker 9:          00:32:42       How is it? How come? Sometimes you make yellow and then you make brown and then there's more yellow like yellow road. Yeah, I remember, but okay. And then remember, okay, then why is it like you can be full, like your stomach feels full. It give either you take your shit, right? Like let's say you take like a hardy shit, like a hot hardy one and then you're hungry again. Like how does that, that's the question. How does this, because what's in the condos? There were some like, do you think they come out faster? No. Lynn, how are you hungry again?

Speaker 7:          00:33:29       Probably because if you take that big hardy shit that you talked about, right? One that meant that your intestines were removing, right? Right. So if you take that big shit, maybe they get a little more activated. Juices start flowing, which kind of sends a signal to your body that the digestive track is going. Therefore, maybe what's in your stomach is starting to move down and then, hey, since this is moving, let's get some more food in here. Okay, so you're saying that the biggest digestive signals to your, to your brain, maybe your body's like you just lost a lot of food or eat more now. Yeah, maybe that's an interesting theory, Dr Oz. Yeah, but it was a really scientific questions. Yeah. You know how you make Brown and the yellow and then there's more yellow and then you know how when you take a stinky hardy shit, then you got to eat.

Speaker 7:          00:34:22       But doesn't that happen to you a lot or you eat and then, I mean, I mean I do feel like sometimes I'm about to eat and like I got to shit and then I go shit. And then eating as much more satisfying. It's the same thing. It's not the same thing. What I'm saying is sometimes you'll feel like full and then I'll take a shit and then I'll be like, dude, how did I just get hungry again? Like I just ate? Yeah. You know, that's one of life's great mysteries. I, the good thing is you put it out there too, a lot of people, so I'm sure we'll get some really interesting answers. Okay. The good thing is someone's job here to go through those emails. Now, um, you have an email or excuse me, a voicemail that we should, oh my God, this came in as we were preparing to do this show is breaking news late breaking, uh, [inaudible] a friend, the Persian lady. We call her guys please or have, uh, our Farsi listeners. If you could really pay attention to this one for us, it is the most aggressively worried, one in 30 voicemails. Um, here's what sound the Ma is listening to right now.

Speaker 9:          00:36:54       That's it. And this way to go back and forth on that, the plot thickens and I mean I'm kind of glad that day we didn't get to talk to her and it just went to Miami on the outer voicemail. Yeah. Cause we can't put a stop to this. Unreal man. This is crazy. It's getting, the stakes are getting even higher. Okay. Someone needs to translate that immediately. We find out what [inaudible] is doing. Yeah. Oh Wow. Awesome. Interesting. In my cell phone news. I got another, um, you know, sexting offer. It says hi. How are you? I just got back in town, just looking to hang smiley face. This is from Nate. I remember a while back. Yeah. It was like, Hey, what are you doing? So let's see. I mean, I haven't answered him and he's still persistent. Nate. I never took up on his offer last time.

Speaker 7:          00:37:44       Hey. Um, you know that a bird is so fat stuff really took off. You know, I know he's been just getting bombarded hammers and then I got some audio. Uh, he's his shows back. It's coming back. Bird the conqueror. Yeah. So He's been doing radio, um, and you know, just call in and like promoting the show. And it's a great show. So it makes sure you record, it's on travel channel called a birth the conqueror. And he does like adventurous stuff. Guys. This who were fat guy. Shit. So here's him on a, I think radio maybe today. Bert,

Speaker 13:         00:38:22       what's up? What's up with you? Oh, I'm fat.

Speaker 9:          00:38:28       That's what you had to ask you. Bird. Chrysler. Why are you so far?

Speaker 13:         00:38:33       Dude, I'm getting fat. Shamed beyond belief. Why? What did you ever do? You know what you guys know? She does know Tom's a girl, right? Yes. And Tom just as a joke said to somebody, uh, they was doing one of those morning TV shows and he was like, Hey, do me a favor in the middle. Ask why Burt Chrysler's fat. And the woman messed up my name and said, why is bird Chrysler so fat? And Tom just said some answer, but it just went viral. And literally, I mean, I get a hundred tweets a day. Same Burt, why are you so fat? No, really Burt, I have a lot of questions. Why are you so bad? And it's so, this is what the problem with fat shaming is, is that when it's true, it hurts. I mean, you should see my Wikipedia page. He is, he has taken it upon himself to just I, and he find, he called me up the other day and he's just giggling. He's like, have you seen what they did? Their Wikipedia page? It is, it is literally a page. It says, I died. She says, I'm allergic to giraffes, that I enjoyed digging holes that I'm uh, related to, uh, the Lee Iacocca Chrysler people. And then I changed my name because I was so fat.

Speaker 7:          00:39:43       It's got to stop. And so now we have to start thinking of something to come up with four Secura.

Speaker 13:         00:39:48       See the problem is that that's like, that's like threatening to burn the devil. He doesn't care. He loves it. He loves it. He loves it. He enjoys it so much. He kept laughing. He goes here, but it isn't real. I go, the problem was all of it is he is 10 times fatter than I am. He is borderline obese. Like not even joking. If you saw both of us naked, you wouldn't for a second say, oh, it's a tie. You'd be like, well Tom Ziglar has got them by, by at least 40 pounds.

Speaker 7:          00:40:18       Does he have, does he like his beard? Like is he proud of his beard and said this shit?

Speaker 13:         00:40:22       Well, let me tell you something. He didn't have a beard until he saw me and I had a beard. You got the beard idea for me to do. You look so fat. I was like, dude, you cover it up. If you don't have a beard, it looks like your Chin as balls. You've got to grow a beard and cover that up.

Speaker 7:          00:40:39       Birds such a liar. He had a beard before birth horse, way fatter than you buy them. And he's, the fat is comic working today by the way. It didn't just go viral. It went mommy. Yeah. Yeah. I think he was BTW it went up. They went m o m m hello Bernd Chrysler, the Wikipedia thing. That is just hilarious. I don't know who got it into them to do that, but it is so fucking outrageous. Um, and find it. He thought that, that we, I go, we didn't ask people to do that. People just did that. No, we don't. We don't really encourage that either. Uh, changing somebodies Wikipedia page. No, no, no, no. Not at all. I mean, we'll see if it's still, it's still right now. Okay. It says he was born in

Speaker 6:          00:41:33       [inaudible] 78 in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and then he died today in the coastal waters. Off of France, possibly from AIDS.

Speaker 14:         00:41:46       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:41:46       He was born in Wyoming. As a kid, he would dig out, dig for hours, each tray, each day, the trial, the other side of the world. Sometimes you only food. He would, he would eat for the day. We'll be worms from the ground. He eventually gave up after a water spout, the, that dug up knock crusher out briefly.

His mother wanted bird to create clothes for Jurassic and adult. But vert was allergic to your ass. I don't fuck it is so fucking silly. Um, it's, oh yeah. And then it says that on this podcast that we talked about him, um, about how the Chrysler Company, uh, you know. Gotcha. Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:42:36       It's really, really funny. Well, I'm glad that it's hit. It's hit the mainstream media now. It's a, it's a real thing and it's all because of my eyes.

Speaker 6:          00:42:43       Yeah, it really is. You guys really, really, really got him. Uh, wait. Actually it surprised me. I remember we made the thing of the plea, we're like, hit them up with a bunch of tweets today, but it went so much further with the Instagram, the Facebook, and he said that on his Facebook page, people will be like first fucking year. Why are you so fat? And that people that know him will be like, hey, that's rude. And then they'll be like, hey, fuck you. I just want to know why he's so fast. Oh my God. Anyways, it is probably the best entertainer,

Speaker 15:         00:45:24       Duty of a comedian to find out where the line is drawn and deliberately cross over.

Let's see what, what was the, let's take a listen, but I kind of, yeah,

Speaker 9:          00:49:53       could be, I don't think he wants to be set up. I feel like he's just happy living in him and his farts. You have any cell in his food and his Manet's yeah. This guy is, you know, he's not,

Speaker 15:         00:50:06       he's not, oh, there's so gassy. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:50:13       She seems like so much sweeter than him. So much sweeter. And he's not like, Ooh, he's, whoa. You know what I want though? And I know it exists. I need a woman. Cause this sounds a little fetishy like, oh, I can't believe. Yeah,

Speaker 15:         00:50:27       like phony. Like I want those stinky farts I've been doing all day long. Give me the girl that just does it for the love of the game, the way the ass rapper does. See, I think I should stop eating eggs for breakfast. Like, no, no, no. I want someone that's in it for the love of the FARC. Yeah, that's good. But better work is good little booty.

Speaker 6:          00:50:57       Yeah. You know when it's good. It's good. Yeah, that's true. She's doing good work, man. If we could see her, we could at least identify if she was a Jew, but let's move on to now we have something alarming to talk about.

Speaker 9:          00:51:13       You're what? We're doing it. I just had my, yeah, my stomach lurch. Like I have something in the pit of my stomach. It's nerve wracking. So upset about it already.

Speaker 6:          00:51:23       So last week it was obviously a huge episode. Speaking of farts where somebody brought into question the authenticity of this isn't any part, we ended up calling the hotel. We went through this whole ordeal with them. Then we made an addendum that we tacked onto the episode. There's a video of it where we discuss it and we break down in that moment that we figured it out, that we were in fact in eight oh eight and we're so embarrassed are considered not even doing what we're about to do right now.

Speaker 9:          00:51:58       But we have to be honest with the Mommy's. We can't, can't lie to them live a lie. I know, I know. It is not about lies. Talked about. We were like, should we just let it go? And then we decided no important Tom Board.

Speaker 6:          00:52:08       And we have too much respect for you to make you believe that it's, you know, okay to do this and it's not. So we're going to tell you right now, cancel your reservations for Roommate Oh eight, because the Cincinnati fart happened in room six 18. Oh my God,

Speaker 9:          00:52:35       I'm so ashamed. I'm so ashamed. I'm embarrassed. Look, this is the water gate of your mom's house. This is a massive scandal. But Tom and I want to come clean with you guys because we respect you. We respect those of you who are making pilgrimage, uh, to your Maca, which is the redness. It's stolen. The Renaissance Hotel, the Cincinnati farts still happen. Here's, here's how we just, the room number I'm afraid we should have done was detective work. Obviously. Sorry it in the moment, but here's how we figured it out. Okay. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         00:53:04       Okay, so I do see a reservation that we did have for you in room 18 and your arrival date was August 19th

Speaker 9:          00:53:12       six 15 1618 six 18 girl there though with the same name. I just want to make sure I'm not, because my dad also stayed there under the name

Speaker 11:         00:53:26       Tom Segura. So do you see a second? Second, a different date of arrival? August 21st

Speaker 6:          00:53:37       okay. Here's how we figured this out. Let's walk through this. Let's walk through this. Okay. The reason that the eight away wasn't making sense to me because of the arrival date of August 21st so I looked in the phone August 21st was Friday, the day of the wedding, and I go, well, nobody came in town the day of the wedding. How do I know this? Because everybody, US and my father were at the rehearsal dinner the day before August 20th your honor. Right? So August 20th that's rehearsal dinner day. Everyone's there for that. And I remembered that. So I go, no, he was in town for the rehearsal dinner, couldn't be him. And then it hit me the wedding day, August 21st my dad would have checked into the hotel. Why? Because the days before he stayed at my cousin's parents home with my mother in Cincinnati, in Cincinnati, went to the rehearsal dinner, went back, but the wedding was closer to the hotel.

Speaker 6:          00:54:41       So the day of the hotel, instead of driving back out to the suburbs, he checked in on August 21st stayed in room eight Oh eight the Cincinnati fart had to have happened in room six 18 and I know this is mind blowing to a lot of people. I'd honestly upset us quite a bit. I mean we considered, I'm embarrassed, I'm embarrassed. I know that people have been writing reviews and, and you know, saying that they crawled on her hands and knees to the room and just smelled under the door. But listen, eight oh eight is not now in the, in Diff, in defense of room eight Oh eight Topdog did stay there.

Speaker 9:          00:55:22       Yes. And here's why I made that association with eight Oh eight state the band. Cause I, here's how I, anyway, in far breaks and here's how I know I remembered the night of the wedding. I went home early with top dog. And your mom, you stayed behind. Okay. They drove me home and then we went into the hotel in the lobby. We went up in the elevator, they dropped me off, walked me to my door. That would be on the sixth floor. And then they went back, took the elevator the remaining way up. So now I remember that's correct. They were in room eight oh eight not us. And we were in six one eight which is my birthday. So that, the problem is, those are two numbers that had,

Speaker 6:          00:56:02       and the mistake was in the early episodes, people saying 1618 that's why it said it's not [inaudible] it's 6.8 I mean this is just, I'm sorry. I know it's, it's beyond upsetting us, but we had to tell the truth, but did you want to keep this alive? I can't live a live with these with our, with our audience, with the Mommy's this, it's too important to us. Draw a line through it.

Speaker 7:          00:56:25       Six one eight draw a heart around it and that's where it happened and that's for sure. Now we're, we're priests are sticking to six one eight this is the Diane, if you already made your reservations, I'm sure you can cancel eight oh eight and get transferred over to six 18 there was sure they'll accommodate. There was a guy that recorded him making the reservation, really was a good trails off at the end of the day and then he explained to them why he wants to stay there. No. Okay, so Cincinnati fart and they're like, okay, well let's amend it. It's not 808-SIX-ONE-8618 that's a final, final answer. Finally answer, look, we had to come clean. Would you? You know what? You want to live a lie? No. Did the listeners want to live a lie? When you go make your pilgrimage, when you plan your summer note, it's upsetting. It's upsetting to a lot of you right now. I know your summer plans just got ruined, but I think it's better to just tell the truth. You know? And now you know that. Now you know what, what really happened? It really happened. Ashamed. I'm embarrassed. I feel like Nixon Watergate scandal, the newspapers Thursday

Speaker 9:          00:57:38       all going to be like you thought it was eight Oh eight wrong. The mommies are wrong late breaking me late. Breaking news. That's happening now and I know it's fine to this news is find a devastate the mommy community, but I feel like we can heal. I don't even know what to do. We're getting g all we're going to, we're going to move on. And I still believe we all sell the way we believe. Guys Hashtag we believe Hashtag burn it's man man.

Speaker 7:          00:58:16       Unreal. We're not perfect, but we know what's important and it's important to be honest with you. Um, hold on. I do have one more piece of interesting news before I forget. We had a celebrity, a double pipe class. Like now a lot of you have been tweeting us that you've had your first double pipe class constitutes a double five classic. There's a lot of chatter on the Internet about, you know, when, what, how, why. Uh, but we got a celebrity tweeting that, uh, the, the singer of panic at the disco. Yeah. Brandon a Uri. And is that how you say his last name? He tweeted that he had a double pipe classic. Pretty crazy. There was a lot. It's a famous one and there was a lot of attention around it. I mean, he got, wow, I think over 5,000 likes and a thousand retweets people. Most of the first 50 comments or just what his followers were. All cute girls going like, what's that bread?

Speaker 9:          00:59:23       I love the socks. But then some of them looked it up and they were like, it's a bourbon. A fart at the same time in case you're wondering. Yeah. Brent, Brendan, Uri, Uri. Yeah. What did you say? I don't know. I'm just making sure I get the guy's name right. [inaudible]. It's Brendon Urie panic at the disco exclamation mark because he's really, he's a cute boy. Yeah, he's really handsome and girls will just watch this guy chips on periscope, the girl, some girls, not all, not some 40 year old married ladies with babies, but he's really cute and that took a lot of courage for him to come through. It was very brave and say that's the main thing we want to get out there. You know, it's like coming out as nonbinary coming out as a double pipe. Classic Person. Somebody else you've, I'm going to keep mocking the gender spectrum. The answer. Yes, yes. Well, because that spectrum is a little blurry. There's a lot of dog shit bullshit blurry because I don't know where I fucking land on it

Speaker 12:         01:00:34       and I'm crazy obsessed about my rap. I love rats more than I love people. I do. I do think crazy girl. I can't live without them. Sean top piece and breeds rabbits. This is huffing. Arat smells good. It smells like,

Speaker 9:          01:01:00       looks like you liked those too. So you get a lot of your two favorite things. Jesus. I'd be terrified to be in her home. I'm not going to lie. I don't like, I mean I think the pet rats a little more sterile than the oh definitely. Definitely. I'm not into it.

Speaker 12:         01:01:24       Sometimes I suffer from G Gmr I to get more rats.

Speaker 9:          01:01:32       G G L N get less nauseous. You're right though. A beard would greatly hide. Yeah. Oh it looks like a Louie Anderson Right now. Baskets. That's why he's so amazing in that role because he's so fat. He looks just like a, like a nice fat lady. Like a nice older fat lady. So good as a woman was fucking so good. Cause it looks like bird. If he shaved right bird without a beard right here, man. The Rad thing is no good though. That's no good. You're, you're going to definitely die alone. Why can't tell one or two is acceptable? I think a house fall is probably not wise. Tall has nine 1972 bedroom.

Speaker 12:         01:02:20       Any animals or children? Each of the Ras have different personalities. He doesn't like the exercise. Janice and lily is my jumper.

Speaker 7:          01:02:34       Sweet. He's like our dog breeds bothers me the most. Janice, I'm not a fan of Janis. You have big, this whole tale is how big that is

Speaker 12:         01:02:45       right away. Like for children. Each of the rats have different personalities. Burger likes to eat.

Speaker 7:          01:02:51       Do you ever get so scared your eyes? Water. That's what just happened to me right now. Can I tell you though? I used to be afraid of them too. And then my cousin had a pet rat for a while and when they're, when they're your pets, there are a lot cleaner and it's just like having a rabbit. I would be in her home and just with a golf club and just beating these rest today in front of her crying. You're not jumping anymore. That doesn't bother me as much as the, the, uh, the terrain, Angela people really, I, that makes me, Matt makes my asshole pucker.

Speaker 12:         01:03:33       That's not as filled. And I've had them pretty much ever since then, I'll never be without them. And we know both of my siblings and they were rats. We get to know one each other.

Speaker 7:          01:03:44       Oh boy. Yeah. Yeah. He's like, I like rats to, I don't, but my fucking mom made me live with rat. That's one of mom's crazy things. Could you imagine having to live with that? About bringing girls home and tried to finger him, whether it's fucking rats crawling all over the place on the couch, you know, he's like, yeah, I was watching movie. No Lily, don't worry about having like a Boa constrictor or a python as a pet. You know those people and then they're like, whoops, the snake God out. Yeah, no, no, that's not it. No. Why? Why are you doing this? Stop. Just, there's, there's rescue centers for a reason. Animal Wildlife Center, and then you hear those idiots in Florida. They get pet crocodiles in their bathtubs and then they grow up, you know, they caught on video that we're in that's been in a golf course for 19 years.

Speaker 7:          01:04:33       Easily 500 pounds. Man will tell you they need, you need to take that, that gator and put it somewhere else. It's not, okay. Not Okay to have that. And it's terrifying. What do you think the deal is with the 19 rats? I mean, I do think people get the exotic pet for like it's an attention. She's the same thing as this is filling an emotional need. This is like a hoarder. 19 of 19 of any animals. Something wrong. 19 of a rat. Like when you get an out of the norm pet that many times. Yeah. You could tell someone's got a lot of emotional. It's like eating diapers and stuff. It's like eating diverse. Yeah. Do that. That's it's one of the, yeah, eating the diaper. The eat the diaper. Dirty diaper. Yeah. It's a strange addiction episode. I haven't heard that one yet. Eat the mattress. The mattress phone line. Yeah. Nail Polish and then they go what's really going on there? Like I was abused and like, okay, can we talk about that? Yeah. That's what you're feeling. The whole molest. I never dealt with it bad. It's bad. It's bad. Yeah. I saw I was, I think two dogs is even eccentric, you know? It's enough. Pretty cool. Now I'm saying came in, you want to see it? It's been awhile. What's popping with you? Yo You more, you more low key, you more low key. But Yo, I listened to your mix tapes.

Speaker 7:          01:06:03       You know what I'm saying? We just out here. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? God Shit working on, you know what I'm saying?

Here's a really intense, and I mean in tents, vocal fry. How? Boy from a man, usually vocal fry is more prominent in women, young women and the car dash in effect and Steven Seagal and Steve and C guy. Honest, honest.

Speaker 7:          01:07:27       So I got this guy, this guy does it so intensely and for so long, you know what I'm saying? Hi, I'm rob was xy car today I'd like to introduce you to or latest humidification device, the humor fan, the human fan. He is our humidor air circulator. So your first question might be, what do I need a humidor air circulator? And the reason for that is that humidity actually rises and it's lighter than air. So inside of your humidors, especially if it's a lump, you're wondering what's, uh, what's so crazy about that? It's because you might not realize it at the time, but it's a deliberate, it's a deliberate choice to make do that. Your voice doesn't do that on its own. You have to make it happen and you can do it so much that it becomes second nature that's actually really harsh on your vocal cords. Yeah. But that sounds like he's just being lazy. Like, maybe he doesn't want to a nonce. Yeah. But he's actually, yeah, it's a lazy way. This is that because of the APP and it wasn't, I develop this thing and I'm proud of it. You know, you'd think that they would also,

Speaker 18:         01:08:43       humidity actually rises and it's lighter there. Throw inside of your humidor, especially if it's a larger humidor, might have to have a higher humidity level.

Speaker 7:          01:08:53       Uh, a more inspiring guy to do the video for the product. Probably insisted on doing it. He goes, I have the best global fry. I want to do it. Um, what's this thing? Oh yes, I have it queued up. So I bought a new mic and we tested it. Yeah. And it's so great that we're buying a second one. It was too good to put on the show today because it would have been, yeah, it would've been one mic and then only you sound like you're in a tin can and I sound amazing. So what I did was kept it that way. I did radio a couple of weeks ago and I remember, and the guy was saying, oh, what do you, what do you use for your podcast? For the, for mic. So I told him these, sure as I'm sevens and he goes, he goes, well, the best ones are these Evy, uh, Ari 20s. And I didn't really, uh, remember entirely, I remember that somewhere in the number was r e or, or you know, 20. So I just pull up the company and they have an ar [inaudible] and an [inaudible]. And I go, well, which one should I get? Oh, and then I realize I could probably just Google, you know, a comparison. And then I realized I could, and then this is what I got. It's really, I think it's really interesting

Speaker 18:         01:10:07       here. I have the capsules from each, the Ari 20 and the [inaudible], as you can see, they're quite different. The Ori Three 20 uses the same capsule designers in the already 27. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. I already 20s or external tubes and the Ori Three twenties are integrated into the capital structure.

Speaker 7:          01:10:25       I meant for a microphone comparison. This guy says a lot of stuff that a lot of people maybe don't understand about Mick

Speaker 18:         01:10:35       cre, 20 users of standard gas magnet to create a synergy and [inaudible] uses a neodymium magnet to create is voltage. So the Ori Three 20 I'm like, well which Mike should I get? We'll have a brighter and higher output. The Ori 20 sensitivity is 1.5 millivolts for Pascal and the Ori Three 20 says 2.5 millivolts and they both have humbugging coils to eliminate emi. Oh the already 20s is an enclosed Bob and wire directly below the element and the Ori three twenties isn't exposed coil wire on the outside of the capsule and do achieve it's brighter top in the Ra three extra resonator dome, which it excites me. Shop around nine k, just shoot me in the and what makes the ori three towns capsule, new diaphragm. It's geometry and low mass, high velocity mylar wherein exceptionally fast I go, I think I want to get the Ari 20 but then transient response and vivid detail. So those are the differences in the capsules. Okay, but what else does she have a close look at? The switching differences. This is what I wanted to, if you already, 20 contains a dual position switch for filtering in the left hand position. The mic is flat from 80 Hertz up to six k with a broad two and a half db rise between 16 and 18 K and it's balanced out with a minus three DB slow

Speaker 1:          01:11:57       80 coach down to 45

Speaker 18:         01:11:59       the right hand position engages a base till curve throwing four and a half db of attenuations see 100 hertz down to 100 so then I thought the Ori three 20 switching effectively creates two different mics with completely different personalities. Stop it and presence. There's a form. Okay, I'm going to die. That goes on to compare on paper. Well, I'll show you how they compare and sound. That's what I, okay, I've got the mic set up and ready for comparison.

Speaker 7:          01:12:26       Great leg. You think you would do this earlier? Like we're three minutes. I know I did actually. The guy does a very informative video obviously, but Jesus, when he takes that thing apart and starts talking about it, check a wise and canisters and tell me which one to buy, asshole, asshole.

Speaker 18:         01:12:49       You know what I mean? Which one's a good one to mention that because the ori three twenties output is hotter than the Ari 20s. I've got the microphone preamps balanced on the console.

Speaker 7:          01:12:58       So did the game. Is he talking about he like, he's doing a good job buddy. Good job. Yeah, it was a lot. All right. Um, so now you know, it was seven minutes to just tell me which ones, you know, how are we hit? We, we played Joey Diaz. I'm talking about shitting in a bathtub. Yeah. He said that the reason that he stopped was because of his wife. I knew it and this is, I'm so happy to hear that.

Speaker 1:          01:13:25       Do that no more. That's when I was an animal. I've done was way before the baby, way before I got married. Yeah, you don't Shit in the shower. My wife caught me one time. She caught me tossing this shit and she goes, what was that? It was a bit as she's quiet like, Oh shit, this thing flying off and it was rolling in the air with the scanner and it just bless it goes. What was that like? Why that accent? You have an accent no more. You're too old for that shit. And that was it. My wife gets it.

Speaker 7:          01:13:55       That's it. Wow. He threw a log. Yeah, I heard it from the shower and a toilet. Yeah, he did you imagine me walking in on now and just imagine what, let like how much of a barbarian that guy is where a regular practice for him with this pick it up. Woo. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. I don't even think I can understand that. It's a lot to understand. It is. It is a lot to understand. Oh man, there's not, there's not a lot traumatized. I know. No, no. Um, thanks for sharing that. I'm glad you brought that back. I just forgotten about it. You know, I got something else for you. Okay. What'd you got

There is this super advanced Chicco watt machine in front of me, so I'm actually going to look that up real quick. Um, he doesn't represent mom's Trillia that he was born in Peekskill New York. Oh, okay. Then they, his folks

Speaker 7:          01:29:02       moved. Yeah, that's, that's what I understood. Um, let's see. Lucky mom's Julia is nice. Yeah. Nice place to like, exactly what happened.

People are always like, yeah, big, but because he doesn't musicals and all that stuff. Yeah. You can throw in Steve Erwin, Paul Hogan, nausea wine member hand. Okay, so let's talk about what you do is we want to, I think we've probably done Russell Crowe and maybe he hasn't aged. Well let's take your mail out of it.

Yeah, not a fan. Well what are you feeling?

Speaker 9:          01:34:14       I mean they look the same. They don't look the same. Similar. I'm going to vote for that panic at the disco guy. Is, is he didn't play what? He's not on the list. He's not Australian. Same. Okay. I see. So this one's like Cla, little cuter. You're cuter. A little more Fay and the other one's rugged.

Speaker 7:          01:34:33       Yeah. That one's a little more rugged but like rugged because he just bought fuck you so hard that he built up a sweat. This guy's definitely making you eat his ass and you're never ever sang. I don't think so. It's always clean enough to get in there.

Speaker 9:          01:34:48       Now the other boy is a little more emo and he might have to talk about feelings with you, like write in his journal and I dunno if want all that

He's, he's not, you're right. He's not going to take no for an answer. The other one is just, he's going to talk too much about feelings. It'll make him all my questions. They go out the window because he's got all the answers. Right. I like that. Yeah. I don't have to be like, what do I do now? He's just going to take me by the back of the head like 50 shades of grey. That's Chris. He's that guy and he's going to put you in his fuck done, Jen, and you have to sign a contract where you exercise. It's going to turn a week. I just don't care. Right Chris, you know Luke is going to be like you sure your eye with those and I'll be like, dude, fucking wrap it up.

Speaker 7:          01:35:46       You know, let's go. So I'm definitely going, I guess. I think these might be the three brothers right here is if I end. There's always one brother. That's the really odd ball. He won like two brothers got the good looks and then that third brother, not so much. Didn't really sucks for him. Dribble all the way down. I'm going Chris. Right? I'm going Chris. Maybe we could do it three way. Let's ask him. That'd be great. Let us know. Fill her up. Sealers shot. If you go to our Facebook page, facebook.com/your mom's house podcast, there's always a pole that links to the filler up. Sealer shuts. Now it's time for the ladies. A lawsuit tale. There is, there's Nicole Kidman. We know that. Kate Blanchette. Oh, I love Q love. Cate Blanchett. Naomi watts loved Naomi Watts. Rose Byrne. Don't know who that is. Rebel Wilson of Wilson Phillips of Wilson Phillips.

Speaker 7:          01:36:47       Here, let's show you who's who. Who's that. A lot of guys, honestly, and I mean a lot like big girls too. Oh, that girl. She's really funny. Very funny girl. That's rebel. That's her name. Rebel. Yeah. She was in the pitch. Perfect movies. Bunch of movies. She's, she works a lot. Really funny. Let's see what Rose Byrne looks. She's a pig. Yeah. Gross. Oh, I love her. She's talking about my asshole. Yeah, she's great. She's actually my favorite and she's been in the neighbor's movies. She plays Seth Rogan's wife and the neighbors and the neighbors sequel. She actually has really good comedic timing. Excellent. She's really funny. Here's some movies she's been in. First Class, the internship I saw. She was getting the punch. What got him to the Greek. Yeah. Get him to the Greek. I love that movie. That's the kind of such an underrated comedy. I think it was so funny. Um, and let's see, hold on and so forth.

Speaker 6:          01:37:56       Is She married to spell? Oh, she's with Bobby kind of volley. The Guy who's, this guy is such a good actor. You know this guy. I did tell you my answer already. You know this Guy

Speaker 7:          01:38:11       Oh yeah. Duties in a, he was in a Jackie nurse, Jackie. Yeah, exactly. And he's on a vinyl right now, that HBO series. Oh, he's great. He's a great, great. Yeah. Uh, well here's the thing. So that, that girl, the, the fat ones married to him. No, that's Jackie Queue. Right. Gotcha. Yeah. So that's, yeah, that's her. Listen, I can tell you straight up now for a lesbian affair, I can't do the big girls cause the sweat and the smells. But you do big boys. It's different. Vaginas are different. You get it, you know? Yeah. What if she just cleans it up? I don't know. You have to really, really be on top of it.

Speaker 6:          01:38:50       Okay. I know my choice, but go ahead.

Speaker 7:          01:38:55       I'm Jackie who I love her. I'll explain a little bit. Well, I'm still a huge fan of her work and we could talk and her coach, you know, won't be a sweaty. That's what I'm thinking about. If I got it down there, sweat, smells, things like that. See, I'm kind of into that and I think, oh boy, I'm going rebel all the way. A couple of reasons though. First of all, I really like rose. I like her work. Yeah. But I feel like with Bobby, see he's dropping the hammer so regularly that her standards are real high. You know? I'm going to have to have like my best day to equal maybe his worst day. Right. You know, and like he's really, I think he's probably just a savage fucking Italian pig. So I just feel like there's a lot to live up to rebel.

Speaker 7:          01:39:38       She's happy if you go like, Hey, I dropped this on the ground. Do you want it? But I know what you're saying. And I think in normal world terms, that's correct. Yeah. But she's famous. Doesn't matter. She's just really getting a lot of d thrown at her. Yeah, absolutely. Famous people get way more love thrown at them though. It's different. It's different with women and different with women that are overweight. It's chick hat. Yeah. But you have to understand there's someone for everyone. And now with the Internet, she can find whoever is into her styles and types.

Speaker 6:          01:40:08       Listen, it's just, there's something you don't understand. Um, I know what's what here and I want to pig out on her. Right. And, and she'll be, she'll reciprocate so much more because she'll be like, oh, you're a fucking, like a awesome looking guy. And like you just ate my box so much. Right. Then I didn't even pay the day, but you don't care. And, and then she's Australian. She's so cool. She's going to have the best personality. I know. She is. Yeah. But I just feel like then I'll be like, you know, you reminded me of this, uh, one of these big trees and I like to get every week that it's like this puffy kind of pastry, but then inside there's so much custard and that's what I'm going to you up with right now is all this custard and then she'll be like, is that it? And then we'll go for like round two

Speaker 9:          01:41:00       and then I'll just keep just telling her up. Yep. But you're saying she's custard flavor? She was like an eclair. Yeah. Vlan. And Yeah. Yeah. And I think I'm going to just really, she has hardened her. Okay. Um, anyways, I just wanted you to know that. All right. I just feel like you should appreciate it a little more. Can I have a threesome with a Jackie Q and her husband though? God, you're such a liar. I like him too. I like them both, you know, huge fan of her. You trying to his fine.

Speaker 5:          01:41:37       You,

Speaker 6:          01:41:44       there you go. Um, yeah, that's, that is. What else? Is there anything else to cover? We have, we went through and find a shirt a lot. It was a really fun episode.
