I bet that looks like some Versace shit baby. I think he isn't he a designer or are you thinking, oh no, inherited this money. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:11:00       I don't, I, I googled him and it said like, he's a lifestyle guy. Like I don't know what that's supposed to be. Doesn't that mean a swinger? Basically style. Okay. Sounds like a lifestyler Luca. Jesus Christ has taken the world by storm since dancing his way onto the scene in a now viral video with his wife, Georgia. Gabriella, shut up. What do we know about him? Well, aside from the fact that he's friends with Zac Efron yeah, the handsome Italian tycoon heads up the manufacturing company and he a, um, but he's also a big fan of Instagram. He uses to showcase everything from all his, you know, activities to pajamas. So here's everything you need to know. Well, it says that he's, he's really good friends with Ron. That's really funny. Um, they enjoyed shirtless horseback rides, um, back in the day. Okay. Here's a video of him riding a moped underwater. Remember that? Yeah. And he's like, this is a throwback from 2000 to 13, and there is a lot of posts of him and Zach Efron. Really? Yeah. They had to go deeper on this guy. I mean, I could only handle so much. I felt the vomit rising about few scrolls down. Get your life him.

Speaker 2:          00:12:26       Um, I dunno. It's so funny. He's diving off a yachts. Here's him and Zach again.

Speaker 7:          00:12:36       Oh God damn it. Oh No.

Speaker 2:          00:12:42       Can I go over and over? He's a lifestyle group. I don't know what that means. I don't know either. When you branded your lifestyle, you're onto something, right? I don't know. I guess it's like the way he presents himself. Yeah. And then that's it. His, his quote brand, this is, is this Douche bag image, but all he's doing is like, to me when you say I have my lifestyle is, is like over the top luxury and decadence. It's not really, like, that's not, I don't know if that's something to say. You're just saying I have a ton of money. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:13:11       You mean a show off? Yeah. It's showing, you know, and can I tell you what really bothers me about people like this is like, okay, I get it. You're, you're having fun every day. Every day's a party. Yeah. And then he'll put a post of like, you haters can, hey, but I'm loving my life. It's like, well you're kind of baiting people cause you're like nanny, nanny poopoo look how great my life is. And then when people shit on you for being a douchebag, you're like all don't be a hater. You're baiting. You always have the defense of you're just hating. Right. Which of course we are if you're shitting on him, but you're baiting it cause you're telling me,

Speaker 2:          00:13:44       yeah, sure. You know, I mean there's something really tacky about showing how much money you have. It's totally tacky. It's, yeah. Yeah. I mean you see it a lot like Floyd Mayweather does that, you know, he's a slow clap. Look Glasgow's money, actual money. That's money I got man, like videos and like it just stacks and stacks and he's like, I'm just counting money today. It's Saturday. Okay. I mean that's kind of boring, right? Yeah. This isn't boring. No. Is He for real? This dude is

Speaker 7:          00:14:15       Danny on a motorcycle. Oh my God. Really? Wow Man. So sorry.

I still, I mean I guess he runs that company that I don't know what that company is. Yeah. But um, it's kind of interesting that somebody is that well known, got so many followers

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       and you really don't know what he really, what he does. Yeah. I know he's all over the top. You know who I like. Who did it cool was like Richard Branson. He would kind of be over the top but in a cool way. Like there was a photograph of him, um, what's that called? Waterskiing with like a naked model strapped to him. That's eccentric, but interesting. Like, oh wow. That's really bizarre. Well, I think the other thing of its kind of annoying about this dude is that this stuff seems very calculated. Yeah. That's really, yeah. Maybe that's like not very authentic. Yeah. He's just like, look at me. Very set up. Yeah. You know, this is a move from a Danson. Okay, well enough of him. Let's get back to this lady now. I feel like this is the lady that did the coffee. Yes. This is the coffee enema lady heard her hair's a little longer. Yeah, but she's, she's given us the new business here. Yeah. Man, this is a really exciting stuff. Um, let's see. We, we, we haven't had her in a while. Let's see what she says here.

Speaker 8:          00:15:58       Hello. Everybody Ran Florence. Welcome to my channel. Well, today is all about gargling with urine.

No. But will lie. I am plan to because I have a cold. Like what the fuck is wrong with you? You're so natural. Yeah. And she's also very sickly. She needs to drink a little more urine because yeah. Or a little more than urine I think. Right? Yeah. How come they are Vbl that advocate? All these wacky things. They always look like you're dying. Yeah. Well it's not good. Not a lot of not good going on with that coffee enemas and the p drinking. I don't know why people have to sign up for, for doing, for drinking urine as if there's, you know, there's a lot of other things you can do. You can detox, you can do kind of fast and you can do all kinds of shit and you got to you to go like, you know, I'm gonna drink my own pissed.

Speaker 4:          00:17:30       Like, why you have to take it there. Well, I'll tell you this, I do know that you're in therapy works for cancer patients, but that, but there is no medical evidence to show that. No, no medical. Of course not. But uh, but just to make it clear, people have, have done it who have cancer. The medical world does not support it as a treatment. I'm sure. Yeah, I know. But do you do feel like I'm one step away from that right. Hundred for 10 years I'm going to be like Tom, we have to do the urine colonic. I'll, it'll be something like I'll have like a sinus infection and then you'll be like, you know, I don't have one and I kind of really wish you would give it a try. It's really changed things for me and I'll go like, I don't want to drink, I don't want to drink any piss.

Speaker 4:          00:18:16       And you'll be like, well it's not as bad as you think it would like that. Well cause I'm into meditation. We know that in the new house they plan on building a meditation hut for me a year. But that's really where it stops. I drink my smoothies in the morning with Kale and spinach and carrots. That's fine. Uh, but I feel like that's the boundary right now. As of now. Yeah. I have some new age crystals that were given to me. I don't buy them. Let's see where else this goes. But I could, can I have some your coffee? I got so much water here. I usually don't have coffee, but May. May I borrow some of your dirty brown liquid to drink? God dammit. Why is this not going over? I guess because I'm a dad.

Speaker 8:          00:18:59       You're in has toxic, right? Basically, whatever's going on in your body. So your body does have antibodies that can fight off this illness. And if you take a little swig,

Speaker 4:          00:19:19       no, you're a liar. What if it, if, if what's on your PP is the bad stuff, the ammonia and the toxins that your body has flushed out, then isn't it logical? You shouldn't be reintroducing that back in nearby. If you're close minded, fucking 18th century person. Yeah, but if you're welcome the loser, drink your pants already

Speaker 8:          00:19:48       first time.

Speaker 4:          00:19:52       Oh God. That made me fucking gag in my mouth. I don't know what her fucking problem is. And also can we do a little different audio set up for her? Well, look, as we all know, these youtube audio quality's Piss poor at the background. She's against a mirror and then a dirty room. It's like the sheets on her floor and you heard all this background noise. We need a tutorial for these youtubers to make decent videos. Sound quality. The music usually bad. Why doesn't this go over when I click it? Why is this thing here? Okay. All right.

Speaker 8:          00:20:32       There you go. So this is what I do is I sleep in the 10 at night. And so what I hear,

Speaker 4:          00:20:45       okay, what I is, I sleep in a tent at night and so there are mosquitoes here and so I urinate in a container like this overnight.

Speaker 4:          00:21:02       I don't know why she sleeps in a tent when there's a bed behind her. I know she has a cold. She was like, I'm going to take it outside while the sheets are ripped off. They're down here in a pile. Oh, what the fuck is wrong with sleeping her team and not only she outdoors in her tent but that throughout the night. This is overnight. It's not like I'm going to pee real quick to do this. This is what I pissed last night. Like I wouldn't even drink water that's been sitting out overnight cause it's right. You guys are. Why wait? I like French. She goes babe, she goes, I peed in this 10 like even she can't believe it on some level I've been paying and the mud from my tent.

Speaker 4:          00:21:55       There are mosquitoes here. She can't even point to it. Yeah, she's going to drink it. You have to let it separate. I've read about this though. The year end drinking. You have to let, only if you take a normal sip, don't show boat and Chug it. Cause this is my water supply for this entire, this is my water supply for the entire show and I'm going to mark it. Don't, don't be a jerk. There's an ant in here. All right, I'll drink the fucking head. Please don't show boat and pretend you are a big showboater.

Speaker 7:          00:22:33       Okay,

Speaker 4:          00:22:35       that's a sip. Oh Bullshit. That's a sip for my Yorkie sips. I'm a, I'm a marathon drinker. We did drink the aunt.

Speaker 7:          00:22:50       I pee

Speaker 4:          00:22:52       in the t and m in the Tan. What the fuck you remember? Um, do you ever go to Europe and they would have the pots next to the bed. The p, the piss pots. My, I used to do it. Why not know? Even when she come to visit us and America would pes and like, uh, what's it called? A night pan. What? Yeah, what do you mean she would piss enough fucking night? They're called night pans and we keep them by the bed. It's European styles and you piss in the pan. And then I swore to God, did you go to the bathroom because she's fucking old country. You guys from Hungary? Of course we would. My father was like, what are you doing? This is totally fucked up. And she would just still, I like it this way, but she would also wear a wet bathing suit and sit in the kitchen.

Speaker 4:          00:23:41       And in the summertime, disgusting story. Of course. I don't know if did a number two in the night bucket, but she wouldn't piss in it, but wouldn't it five feet from the toilet. I mean, we lived in doors with indoor plumbing. There was a turtle that right next to her, but she preferred the piss in the rooms. Just sleep in a tent. She did actually and the summertime we had a tent and she was living in the backyard. My none. I did provide for the tent. Why? Because it was cool. It's cooler outside. In the summertime you're not as fucking, she's dead. But when my father was too cheap to run the air conditioning at night, so my Nana would sleep in the backyard in a attend and Canoga Park. I know. I know. Fuck man. This is what we talked about this on the, I believe the Patriot episode is how running the AC as a sign of having money when you're like, I didn't get false, but $100 a month one air conditioning.

Speaker 4:          00:24:33       That's true. Now my dad, he got the swamp cooler, so the whole place was damp. Agree. This way it's kind of warm. Is it would be like one degree down. He'd be like, dude, I mean, so we're open and close the door. All right. There's to drain out, right? You don't pay this bill. Oh yeah. Yeah. My parents the same way I closed the door, the air conditioning is on. Well, I mean, some of it's going to leak, bro. I know if I can relax, but at no, at nighttime, my dad would just make us sweat in the valley. Dude. Fucking hot as balls Canoga Park. And as the same time that the night stalker was going around climate into kids' rooms and stealing them and shit. So I was all scared of that except our windows open when fucking night stalker was out. Really? Hell yeah. I'm scared of that. And my dad was so cheap. He would rather me get stolen by the night Stalker Dolan. You've been killed right then he wasn't into stealing.

Speaker 4:          00:25:31       Yeah. Yeah. He was like, well, I'm a big deal that's on the, yeah, that's okay. No big deal. I'll find it like you love it. There's hot nights men hot as balls and he was just run a fan. No, we didn't even have fans in this house. What? Why not? You mean overhead now? My father had like some kind of stand up bullshit like you sleep with a, but that was it. And we'd have to just like sweat it out until he married my stepmom who was like, if I don't, you'll have air conditioning. And then he got the swamp cooler and then the swamp cooler made everything down. So you wake up, it's the morning and it was just damp. The carpet was all dark, like wet and cold. And then she was like, how about we get some real air conditioning? Nope. She just settled on the swamp cooler.

Speaker 4:          00:26:13       That was as far as she could push him because he was cheap. And then eventually the next house, the house he lives in now has ac. That was the first house that had ac for him when I went to college. He moved into that Nice House. So that was like, so he was 50 when he got Eric. What the fuck? Yeah, that's real crazy. That's fucking old school. Hungarian kidding me. There was a kid, the only thing that I could take it further than that was in high school, I went to this, a buddy of mine, we went to this other kid's place, the lived in Melbourne, which

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       is, uh, in, in Florida, like little north of where I was in school and he was summers, you know, it's so humid in Florida, right? And like swamp man, it's like at night it's full. 100% humidity. So you're just dying. And we get in this kid's house and you know, it's like a Saturday night. So we're just hanging out drinking and we're going to crash there. Well, I'll walk in and I'm like, dude is fucking brutal in here. Why is it so hot? Well, he's half is half Vietnamese moms, Vietnamese, Dad's American. He goes, my dad just likes it to be more like Vietnam. I go and he goes, he just, he loves Vietnam. He loves everything about it, the culture and everything. So he doesn't like to run any AC. And I'm like, oh my God, I just turned them off. I go, I think, I don't think I can crash here.

Speaker 2:          00:27:40       And I mean, I was like, this is fucking it first and only time I've ever, anybody likes, I went into trailer parks where you go in the trailer and they have 60 degree ac in there and I go, do we, I don't think I can crash here. And he goes, well we have, we do have a unit in the um, like the guests. There's like a guest house thing here. You could stay there and go, yeah, that's where I'm standing. And I go in there and I'm, I guess the fan on and I'm just like, it's a ceiling fan. And I, I pass out, I just pass out and I wake up, the ceiling fan broke, you'll the night pieces of it everywhere and the kid turned on the heat instead of the AC. So I accidentally had the heat cranked. What a dope. So it was 105 and broken pieces of a ceiling fan on me.

Speaker 2:          00:28:30       Oh my God. That was dangerous. I know. Yeah. My Mother didn't run the AC open the windows. We lived in an apartment complex and so you could hear everybody like this drunk woman and cry, just open, open the window and I have to sweat it out on the sheets on top of the sheet has kids too. We're back. So it was in $1,000 on this whole thing like, is that why we're not doing this? When you and I got together and we lived on Carondelet and he would run the AC all summer. I thought it was the most extravagant thing I had ever seen. Yeah, you go just fucking let it run all day and all night. And I was like, wait, what? Yeah, Tom, that's going to cost us a fortune. And I was like, never turned it off. Just let it always did. And like the freon leaked and we had to get it replaced or whatever. But that's the only thing that sucks about living in like a poor. Oh, there's a lot of things. But one of the things that sucks about living in a Shitty, poor building is when the freon ran out. Right? So all of a sudden one day the air's running and there's warm air coming out. You're like, oh, and we call that guy down.

Speaker 4:          00:29:44       He's like, it's not so cool air coming out. That's why I fucking called you down. That's why you're here. And he's like, yeah, it's not going to be cool at all. Right? It's like, so you need, you need free on it and make it cooler. Gary and I go, okay, this is like Saturday, let's say. He's like, yeah. He goes, all right, well, okay. I had the guy come out Wednesday. I go, no, no, no. It's uh, it's, you know, it's too long. We got it. We got to have him come out today, tomorrow. And he goes, no, he comes on Wednesdays and that was it. He was like, okay, you call another guy. Nah, this is the guy. And that was it. There was no negotiation. We were stuck there for five days. Like this downtown La Cooking. Cooking man. Yeah. That was a weird apartment. And then sometimes one time we went for a trip. We came back, the shower was just running full blast hot. It had been running for days. Just hot foam last water. Right. I know I didn't leave this shit on the turnout in itself. No.

Speaker 4:          00:30:55       Plumbing's wacky and it turn itself. If someone came in there to fix it and left it running. Yeah. Hi there. A common thread. That was the other thing is when the sink was clogged up. Yeah, no it was the, it was the, the tub. So you're spending and take a shower, you know you're standing in like three inches of water. You're like this is disgusting. So after awhile we call him, he goes yeah, it's all backed up. And that's why the water is not going down. No, he came over because the sink, it was the sink. No, I thought it was the tub. So maybe you weren't there that time cause he, that's the first time I noticed that Jose wasn't, there was a couple of screws loose cause he kept saying like the elementary, you see what happened here is the clogs still does champion. That's Obama is the president here now. He made this announcement. He was talking about Trump this week and he was like, somebody asked him and then he just goes, you know champion. Yeah, I knew I loved Obama. It's so weird he didn't mention that he's, he made that for me. That's really nice. Thank you president. What? You just said it in a press conference. Wow. Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. I don't know about that. You must have heard you say that.

Speaker 4:          00:32:16       I repeated it cause it was part of the show. He just wanted to say that one day the preacher said that and I thought it was absurd. That wasn't the matcher. No, it was a half ounce or half ounce. Yeah. God does not say that word. God does not drop any bombs. Yeah. Yeah. God bless Nigga. So dumb. Yeah. God blesses a naked. Yeah. I'm drawing big tits on drafting. God is real. God blesses a Nigga. Oh my God. I mean, it's right here. I said that like years ago and there's still punishing me from, oh here's by the way, I couldn't fucking find this last week. God dammit.

Speaker 4:          00:33:16       God dammit. I'm licking your balls or your penis or anus or something. Go ahead. Go ahead. I love the beacon for shyness. Okay. Anyways, go back to what you were saying. So that's the first time I noticed Jose wasn't that bright because he kept explaining. He goes, zoo will happen is it will drain is clogged and the water won't go down. Yeah, that's what he said about the tub. It's clogged up. And I was like, yeah, I did. Yeah, yeah bro. I'm going to have to put a snake in the pull everything out so then the water will go down. Thanks. Could you get on that? Because I'm like, yeah, cause I'm standing in it. I'm always standing in it and he's like, yeah, it's because it's backed up more drain. Yup. And that it's not going to go down until I do this. So I know now he, he and his wife Linda Sweet people, Linda was, she had, I love it.

Speaker 4:          00:34:21       And she'd come over and I'd had just made spanakopita from trader's Joe. Yeah. And she would eat half the tray. She would, she was a tiny woman. So I let her, I'm like, gosh, she needs to eat more than I do. But I went to their apartment one time on the first floor and it was an exact replica of ours. The layout, except they were clean, super clean and they had trails like liner trails, like plastic. I oles you know what I'm talking about? That's a real immigrant thing too, to have like a pathway of plastic. I put Hosanna horse deck on him. Yes, I bet he did. I bet he did. Yes, we should call Mary. Oh, she's like, yeah, Mario and I get married. He goes, it's a pet name if I, his cat, he had a long order break cause he has a Puerto Rican guy and he had a long ponytail.

Speaker 4:          00:35:08       My really long real for him. I remember one time he goes, hey Tom got a ball you so bad. I go, what the fuck is that? It's a bag full of soup. And I go, Oh yeah. I was like, I'm having to tell him what that's called. Did you know what is that called? The garment bag. But I mean, I was like, what's a suit bag? At first I thought he was saying soup bag, right? And I just, I was like, I don't think I have that man. I asked him like had he had to say it five times? Yeah. Well, so I really liked them though and I will say once, once Hosanna, Linda left the building went down, then these fucking dirt bag, Russians brought it, fucking bought it. The scumbag brewskies came and then the building went down and that's when we of the about this.

Speaker 4:          00:35:56       Some people will know if you live in cities and you've moved from a Shitty neighborhood to just a better one. The first phone call you get that you don't expect is a for car insurance. Your car insurance goes way down. Way down. We moved to a good neighborhood from a bad neighborhood and I had thought about it. I, I was talking to our insurance one day after we moved and they were like, Oh yeah, your payment is now half and you're getting a refund. Because I didn't tell him we'd move. You're going to get like a $600 I was like, what? Why? And they're like, well you moved from like a horrible neighborhood. Uh, where a car jacking sacrifice all the time to a decent neighborhood. I was like, oh this is great. We just kind of scream. Of course if you think of it, cause if you're poor or more poor, you are not going to get the insurance sucks. Uh, wha what are Carter, you know? Oh my God, she's going to drink it.

Speaker 9:          00:38:38       Listen man, I had to make this video because too many niggas is talking against the beauty of e and s with all these dumb ass arguments about your shit in there. It isn't that man. I think if you could eat pussy, Yuki, e s e n asses right around the corner like right around the corner from me. So later. Yeah, you can go one place. You could go to the next door neighbor. It's not that hard.

No, it's the same argument in different parts, but it's the same argument. Babies, am I eating pussy? Is that timeout second deck. But I'm, but I'm saying you could interchange that. Absolutely not. Absolutely not. Why that my anatomy is significantly different than yours. I don't know if you know that what I'm saying. It's the same thing as the district. Do you think it's right around the corner? No. No it is not. Your Dick is far, far, far from your butthole. No, it's not a ball. Separate the Dick from the bottle for a reason because my mouth wasn't supposed to go there. Thank you. Yeah. That's a case. Horrible argument. Come on. The balls are the buffer so that I don't like your butthole.

Speaker 9:          00:39:44       I personally think like in um, biology and anatomy of God. Yeah. We're like, who's clearly mess rusty ass. That's why I asked is fat. You got the cushion, you got to look at the cushion. So when you put your head in there like you'd be safe. Like no harm could come your way while you eat and ask cause you'd be safe in the cheeks for me.

Speaker 4:          00:40:04       Yeah. Cause they seem like a nice guy. Yeah. Like a sweet guy.

Speaker 2:          00:40:07       We also got this email today as um, um, uh, typing this. We, we, we got this today. I'm a huge new found fan of yours. I heard Christina snort when she giggled and burped and thought to myself, this is the type of woman I want to be listening to. Wow. She's just so real. Wow. Then, uh, your mom's house or who she met, your mom says, I've been hooked to both your uh, that's deep bro. Ever since. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:40:32       yeah. Listen to that. See pro guys. Shit. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          00:40:35       She, so anyways, lots of, she said that I'm coming to see it to come on your comedy club next month. My boyfriend surprised me with tickets on my smurf day. Uh, can you say he got some gray fruit and ass eating action for that? Anyways, fantastic show. Oh, and Tom, I always heard how enjoyable ass eating is for you guys. I've offered it to my boyfriend many times and he keeps saying no. How do I convince them to say yes? Jessica?

Speaker 4:          00:41:03       First of all, you and I were on the same page. Yes. Until that last, yeah. I'm not sure. I'm not sure anymore. I Dunno. Maybe a little wife swap because uh, I mean how, how could this son of a bitch turn that down? What is wrong with him? What's you, what's wrong with you was what's all with all this ass stuff you want lately? What's going on? What I just want, you are like six guys. Uh, I dunno man. I Dunno. I've just trying to get, can we just with a finger calling on? Yeah. Yeah, let's do that. Can get you need to be patient with me. I feel like you always rushed me and scare me. You don't let me take my time with stuff. That's a deal. It's a deal. You got to let me get, cause it's awfully hot around there. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:41:51       I get scared cause it's hot. First of all, and smelly. I'm totally onboard. When's your colonoscopy? October. No, October and the date I do because I want everyone listening to hold you to this one because now that we've rescheduled it so that you, the reason we rescheduled you just everybody knows he's not a chicken. Because I had some listeners come up to me at the comedy store and go, all the buns isn't going to get a colonoscopy. He's a chicken and airy Shaffer texted you, you know, but look, look, look chicken. It's not because of that. It's because Tom had some tour things scheduled. It would and it would kind of fuck up the colonoscopy because you need time to do that. It's October 27th okay. 30 am that's close to when we moved to genes. Boy, you're gonna. You have to take that drink the night before.

Speaker 4:          00:42:40       So 5:00 PM on, you're going to be shitting your brains out the night before. We'd postpone it because it was going to interfere with the live podcast. We just did. We, it would be today that you would have had that colonoscopy. Yeah, but not only just canceling, but it would have screwed up probably last night. Yeah, so October 27th guys, everybody lock buttons and to this one there's no getting out. Old me to it was, let's help this lady out. How did she convince? Don't ask me. I don't fucking know what I would do. I would actually use some of what Christina just said. Baby steps, baby steps. If he's resistant, maybe you kind of ease back there some taint plague, get some, you know, kind of creep on, creep, creep little bit, little bit at a time. Then maybe some, you know, just a little finger licked and kind of edge around the outside and then all of a sudden he's like, oh, he's into it.

Speaker 4:          00:43:36       And then you hock a luxury in there and then you know he's, he's so turned on by then you just bury your face in. There you go. Crazy. I disagree. Okay. I think that's, this is the right way to do it. Okay. Tell him, put him in on all fours. First of all, you put some alcohol on it. Yeah. Fucked up. But that to be fucked up. Ripped. Just buzzed. Have a little wine, have some candle so that he's not embarrassed by what it looks like. Cause I'm sure his ass holes not as pretty as Tom. Put Him in the dog. Yeah. And to shove your face in there, but that's not how you do that. Put him on his, on his belly and be like, oh, and I give you a massage and then put him but his knees up and then I guess do it that way.

Speaker 4:          00:44:21       Give him a rusty trombone. Oh, I think, I think you gotta slowly get into it, but tenants a massage, a back rub, and then then just shove your face in there, I guess. True. Sure. See that's what you kind of do with me. You've always done the surprise attack. Yeah. You sneak attack me constantly and I'm not comfortable doing that. Yeah. And then you'll be like, boom. Yeah. And that's how you've tricked me into many a thing that I wasn't ready for. Um, so this is the one that's right. You're not going to address it and you just going to act like they didn't say any of that. I forgot about this sneak attack. You said, I sneaky fag here. You've sneak attack to me every time. I'm like, I'm not comfortable doing that. Then you just force it on me anyways. That's rude. It's true. That's not true. It's true. You sneak attack it and then I'm like, Whoa, what? Yeah. And then afterwards you're like, that was pretty cool. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:45:14       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:45:16       You're never, no, that's the thing is you, you can always read me and you kind of know how far to push my boundaries and hope. Yeah. You had to push the guys boundary a little bit. Yeah, that's what, that's what I was telling her. He's on back there. Yeah. These on bag jiggle the twins for a minute. Right. And then kind of read back Jayla twins in with your thumb like that. Maybe that's reverse grip. Oh, that's interesting because she's checking the oil that way. But see, I think that we could end everything. I know. Yeah. But that's when she shaves her face in there quick before he has a chance. Yeah. That's a risky, yeah. You're, you're kind of playing the high risk reward game right there. That's all I know. Yeah. Yeah. So let me show you this serial killer lineup. So this guy, Arthur Shawcross was there. I heard of him. Yeah. Will you and I have watched a program about him? Is this that funny, funny thing where his mom molest him? Yeah. But I say that was funny. He brought this up at the live show yesterday and yeah. The audience didn't seem to think that part was funny. Oh yeah, I remember this asshole. Yeah. Yeah. He's a real fucking pos. This guy. Oh yeah, man, this is on Netflix now,

Speaker 7:          00:46:29       dad. Oh, just do links a lot. Yeah. To take, it's called guilt. Yeah. More or less after they just relax your body. Relax. It doesn't fight, so he knows they're dead. I don't take it both for a minutes. Problem not interested in got these eyes. No thanks. Don't feed it on my lunch.

Speaker 4:          00:46:57       Yeah. Anyways, sorry. Why did you show that to the audience and to me? Well, there was part of our comedy show. Was that appropriately the suit as we were talking, what were we talking about? And I brought it up. I brought it up and you wanted to bring it up. You forced that on me queued up. Yeah, you did. Right.

Speaker 7:          00:47:16       Oh, for fuck's she talking to the killer? Yeah, man. Yeah. Yeah. You want to get to the subsequently found out that he did hang out at a Dunkin donut. Oh boy. You want to do the no, no, no, I'm

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       good. I got it. Like a bunch of playing cards here. We took the stack and like, oh, is that right?

Speaker 8:          00:47:35       Do they come and we're able to verify was

Speaker 2:          00:47:38       put 'em under a hypnosis. Um, the shrink did after he was caught and then she starts, you know, getting into all his history.

Speaker 8:          00:47:46       The fact that he was a horribly mistreated sexually as a child part is funny for the, in the course of the interviews, he, we lived with some of that experience, which was out of his conscious awareness. Dr. Lewis, let's sure

Speaker 4:          00:48:04       cross your series of interviews, some conducted under a form of hypnosis.

Speaker 10:         00:48:11       What are you doing while you're moaning and peanut? What happened? Wow,

Speaker 4:          00:48:24       great. Can I not see this ever? I don't want this. Okay. Okay. Look, we gotta move on. I'm going to throw up. I hate this kind of shit. I got a son. So one listener wrote in saying that they agreed with you that the last episode we watched where a man got his legs crushed, violently thought of it makes you happy. A one person wrote in saying that they agree with you. Actually I won't, I won't exaggerate exactly. Three people email the show saying that you are right. But that was funny. And then they submitted some horribly violent videos that we can watch and, and judge for ourselves as it funny or just horrible.

Speaker 2:          00:49:05       Yeah. Well, um, hold on a second. It's at the bottom of the cheat sheet. No, I know. I know where it is. I wanted to first say that you're not telling the truth. I have the emails that came in. Hold on. I was talking about his podcast, jl.com posted this on, uh, what's it called? On Facebook. I posted the video of the guy getting crushed by the car. I asked everybody to watch it on the page and I said, check 'em out. Here's what I want to know. Do you laugh at this a lot? A little or not at all? The posts reached 50,000. Um, there's hundreds of comments. Uh Huh. All of them being like, you're mentally ill. No. Here's the first comment. As an Asian, I must say this is the most aes and Shit I've ever seen from the bad driving to the yell to the cold gays or the man staring at the director, Brian Yang posted that they've lost Asian Shit. Yeah. You see, that's funny. He wrote, it's this weird Asian mentality. If you get some, if you get hurt somehow it's your own fault. I bet everyone in the shop was like, why the hell was he standing back there anyway? It's right. Um, and then finding right underneath that a woman Sheena rights as another Asian I secondness

Speaker 4:          00:50:23       so it's an Asian thing.

Speaker 2:          00:50:25       Yeah, that's what they said. Um, so let's see. I laughed a lot. There's the next comment from Russell, mostly at the dis disinterested asshole. Glancing down at the dude's fucked up legs. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:50:38       well see that's the thing is that's different than the guys pain. Are you laughing at the sound of the man's pain?

Speaker 2:          00:50:47       Okay, well, there's a lot that I'm laughing at. I mean, the, his expression, the sound of the sound of his pain. There's like a way you can break it up, detach yourself from the real pain to find it funny, you know.

Speaker 4:          00:51:01       See that maybe that's my problem is I have what's called empathy. No. And so when I see other humans being heard or animals, I don't feel like it's fun. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:51:09       I don't find it ever wait for him for animals to get hurt. Um, and I, I don't like if you told me like someone's, you know, like a really, I don't know, like one time this guy told me this bathtub got dropped on his neck and it shattered it. I laughed so hard, but it's not in his faith. I laughed in his face. I couldn't even control myself. And he was like, I know you love this shit. He used to come to work. It'd be like, Oh, I'll tell you that. He was able to be like, Tom, I know you'll love this. About this time I was working at a site in this ladder, fell and broke my leg. Um, and then I was just laughing, laugh. So yeah, I'd say, I don't, did you get here? He's due July. Dan Hughes wrote. It's definitely funny.

Speaker 2:          00:51:47       I'm like Ben, I laughed almost as much as I did from the lady falling off the grape stomping back. That was different. That was funny. But he said, he's saying he's saying that he left because her al is like, oh, I like, it was a funny sound. Yeah, well the guy said I laughed. It was little. Daniel says, I laughed a lot. The sound he's making sounds like he's mocking someone in pain. Couldn't help it. Um, Tyler road. I'm still trying to find my balls because I laughed them off vigorously watching this. Chelsea writes a lot. I showed a few friends who laughed but didn't find that as funny as I did. Oh, that's interesting. Well, Bryon Byron Brian writes, it would be funnier in person. Uh, Jose, I couldn't stop laughing. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:52:31       like all these people are just trying to suck up to you. I don't think so. No, because a few people told me this isn't funny. Okay. Can we watch the video again, please? And then I'd like to see the other videos that were presented to us and we can watch for ourselves and see if it's funny or just a sad, okay. Okay. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:52:50       Okay. Why a little taste of loud? I'm like, God, I love the taste of Alaska. I hate when those four commercial is that form.

He lit that from, how would you be that dumb to light that that close. That's what I'm saying. Why hillbillies, Bam. Yeah. Not Bright. Yeah. No, they're not smart. It should tell all of you guys that if you ever, if you ever, you know, now it's just, cause I, I moved this year. I'll stop for a second. If you ever decide to do a bonfire or set off a bomb of some type, get really far away from it, you know? Yeah. Or just don't do it or get really far away. Yeah. This one's so careless.

Speaker 2:          01:02:17       Yeah, I did. Um, when I was in, in middle school, I went to was Lake Michigan. There was like a part you could go to the lake by our house and it was pretty isolated. And I put together, made a little bonfire and I took spray paint cans and I put them in the fire. But then I backed, I mean I ran back up this hill after it got to a certain temperature, they exploded and the color of that spray paint would go up in the air. Yeah. But I got really far away from it and,

Speaker 4:          01:02:50       oh, that's number one. If you're going to do Tom foolery like this. Yeah. Get the fuck away, dude. Yeah. Don't stick around. Did you know that my dad blew up a bridge when he was a teenager? Yeah. You told me that in Louisville. Small. Yeah. Damn. Yeah. Like one of those not, not a bridge, like a major, that commuting bridge. It was one of these wooden email, like when he was in denning or something. No, no, no. He did that later. It was like 13. He went and uh, there was like a little wooden tea for a little, a small crossing the pond kind of thing, you know? Yeah. And he put a stick of dynamite in there

Speaker 2:          01:03:25       and uh, blew it up and then this is how old's call that shit was, I forget, I think the sheriff found out, came to the House and talked to his dad and he was like, well I'll give him a talking. I'll talk to them.

Speaker 4:          01:03:41       That was it. Yeah. And they were all like, you can't do that, don't you go blown up bridge no more. Yeah. He was like, I'm tired. Cause like now if he did that, what happens? You get sent to jail or oh my God. Well we are 13 what happens? You get at, first of all, I forget the story of how he got his hands on dynamite, but that would be the story. Like how'd you get dynamite, right. Well they sold it on the side of the road back then. Yeah. Really crazy man. Really crazy. Well it's true though. Isn't that weird? How he did kind of grow up and then blew up a bunch of bridges in Vietnam. Like he found his life's calling early in life. It's neat when you do that.

Speaker 2:          01:04:17       It is neat. Um,

Speaker 16:         01:18:39       Okay. This line is sitting at a bar in Chicago watching the, yeah. The one of these bars where they had to TV buying the bar and uh, there's some guy up on the ledge getting ready to jump. So this, this guy sits, sat next to her and he says, sure, this is the six o'clock news. And, and uh, he says, uh, I bet you he jumps and a blonde says, I bet you a drink. He doesn't. And all of a sudden the guy jumps. And so the, the guys at the blonde says, I guess you owe you $20. And he said, no, I really can't take the money cause I saw it on the five o'clock news and the blonde says, so did I. But I thought he might change his mind.

Speaker 16:         01:20:47       Got London. Yeah, so she's just climbed on board and she sat in first class without a first class ticket and the story says, I'm sorry miss, but you're not allowed. You have to go back and coach. She says, I'm blonde, I'm beautiful and I'm going to London in First Class. The stewardess never had anybody talk to her like that. So she went to get to the copilot. Copilot came out and said, miss, he got to go to the back of the couch with everybody else. You don't have first class ticket. She goes, I'm blonde, I'm beautiful and very busty as you can see, I'm going to London in First Class. Well we call it pilot. He didn't know what to do. So he goes up and tells the captain, the captain does, don't worry. I speak blonde. Captain goes back, whisper some interior. She pops up and runs back into coach and the other said, what did you say to her? I told her that only coach is going to London.

Speaker 4:          01:28:16       Wow. That was possibly one of the funniest calls I've ever had with him. That was unbelievable. Definitely didn't want to get into killing people. No, that was, I felt bad for me to like, oh, should we not have asked that? But he brought, but he's talked about it before. That's why we talked about it on our show. No. Why Charo was there. No, no. Charo was there and maybe that's why he didn't want to. Oh. Oh, I see what you mean. Mean we've, we get, um, without her in the room. Yeah. I could of, I felt bad. I felt bad too. Yeah. But I do like the blonde jokes. He was really, really, really amused by them. And I love the Polack jokes. I think Poland jokes to the best. I don't think I've ever heard him laugh like that in my life. No. It's funny cause he knew like the long blonde jokes.

Speaker 4:          01:29:00       Yeah. He was like, what do they sit down at the bar usually stammers through them, by the way. Yeah. So he was focused energy. Yeah, he was. And I know that he got that punchline a little raw. Yes, but he got it kind of, would you like how he tries to answer? I'm like, dude, just justice. Just knock knock. Who's there? That's it. You don't try to answer those. The bear, the barrels of the guns are playing back. What are you talking about? Jesus that punch on it. Have you ever laughed that hard at anything? No. Now the other thing is, uh, with your pops, enjoy these, some of the blonde stuff. Yeah. Yeah. He likes it, but he likes a more racist stuff. Yeah. He likes the old school truly tasteless. Like if you were to open up one of those black jokes, Jew jokes loves the blonde jokes. Loves Pole. My Dad loves those Polack jokes. I had heard all of them cause my father, but in Hungary they would tell them about the Russians. Oh, snap poll ox. It's the Russians, how stupid Russians are. So I grew up hearing dumb Russian jokes, which is what

Speaker 2:          01:30:02       origin of why a Polish joke is it, you know what I mean? Is it, why is that a stupid?

Speaker 4:          01:30:08       Personally, I think it does come from their military being bad. I remember I asked my dad this question when I was a kid. I think it's because they're military was so bad that that's what it's, it started like, they like an emasculating thing, right? Yeah. Like you notice that one of the jokes was about the Polish military. Yeah. A few of them were. Yeah. It's because they're, they're notoriously bad at knowledge. I, that's what I heard. Not sure. Why are they getting poked and prodded by everybody? You know? It's just, you know, everyone gets chosen for something. Yeah. And that was that. That's their thing being dumb.

Speaker 2:          01:30:38       Yeah. I remember the first time hearing those and I was like, hm, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:30:45       Yeah. People are going after. Does that make sense? Well, at least they got some Hungarians don't even have anything. Yeah. We don't even have a stereotype that's a shitty, or like a tree is, by the way, did we read this email of the guy who agreed with me? I don't think we did. No. Oh, okay. Oh, I just wanted to point it out that this guy, the one, the one person who took the time to write it, go ahead.

Speaker 2:          01:31:08       Uh, he said, I love, uh, all the amazing videos do you turned me on to, I must agree with Tom in regards to the man getting crushed by a car. There was something wrong with you. If that doesn't make you laugh. It's those who can't see the humor in those things that are the real serial killers. Not sure if you have seen, uh, interesting theory there. Must see will. Thanks. We'll interesting theory will know. Anyways, I just wanted to point that out. Okay. Um, oof man. That uh, that was unbelievable. That was really crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:31:43       Yeah. We should just read him jokes all the time. Fuck man. My Dad, my dad likes the harder job though.

Like how your parents like I love, I love, I love it. No, it's not stupid. That's like the highest. Why his stupid face? I compliment a stupid face. I like his stupid face.
