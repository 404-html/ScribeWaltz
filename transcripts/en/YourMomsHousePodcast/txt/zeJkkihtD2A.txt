Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Well. Well, well go to your mom's house.

Speaker 2:          00:00:19       We're rolling. And it's, it's funny that you mentioned that, uh, our very special guest today is the delightful and I'm tremendously help you still feel that way. Okay, go. I'm done by four. And um, just, just as an absolutely. Uh, I would say tremendously tempting torso. Dr Drew the body Penske many years ago, we got a peek behind the curtain of your upper body and I gotta say I was the long time ago. You mask that. You deliberately do that, don't you? On on TV, like not anymore. Seen Him. And I was like, what? Because I'd seen you for a while on TV. Then I see you shirtless, uh, at a pool and I'm like, what the fuck? This guy must have had a towel around my waist or something. I just had my provider. I mean, was that something that you got into a long time ago? Weightlifting? Yeah, long time ago when I was 14. And you'd say you did have almost never stopped. It's weird, but now it's become my, my, like my meditation now. Now I get weight lifting. I do. Well, it's not even when it barely weight lifting anymore, but it's, it's I lift. I listened to a podcast and I just sit and I just, I go into it like a meditative state. And does your wife talk during this podcast? Just he mesmerized by his body.

Speaker 2:          00:01:40       And O eight Tom and I were living in the rampart division. We were engaged in a one bedroom apartment, but celebrity rehab was the glue to our marriage. When you say like we're huge fans, they seen every episode. We were obsessed with you. I've listened to you since love lions since the poor man days. That's kind of weird. CHARAC crazy boy. I can we go back to his body? I want to know. So one thing that stood out the most is that it really felt like a, nobody would know that you were this in shape dude, which is kind of like an interesting thing. A lot of people that are really into fitness would like make an effort to go. Like, I'm going to show everybody and I'm going to show him because I've earned it. Which then you go like, oh yeah, that's a good point. But I feel like none of the clothes you wear on celebrity rehab or any need to flaunt it takes away from you.

Speaker 2:          00:02:37       Took credibility as you'll be aware. Early on in my career as a physician, I always thought that be kind of weird. I remember I used to wear green sometimes when people, where did you, where did you have to shop for? Like oversized shirts? Is that what was that party? No, but I always had problem with shoulder and arm fit. I've always had, it's just how I'm constructed and if I weight lift, this stuff gets big here. Yeah. And I remember nurse coming to goes, that's that doctor arms thought, oh that's weird to cover that all up. Okay, so you wait, you're saying you were Green Greens, you know, surgical grains and in your, you looked, excuse me, ripped and I didn't look like a rest. Everybody else. So I was like, oh, that's weird. I feel like after, I mean I'm probably, I'm probably the one that just outdid you, but I think for the audience you're going to have to post some some thirst trap.

Speaker 2:          00:03:20       I will lose about 10 pounds first. My wife's of why we were in Mexico last week and my wife posted a picture of the two of us in a bay that she, she's biotic, she has some insane jeans. It's all just natural with her. And uh, God bless her and uh, or bless her heart as they say bless. Uh, and she took this picture. I'm like, for God's sake, at least make me sit up. I look like, I'm like, I look like I like ms or als and this barrier. It's a longstanding thing where it's like you take a picture of me, I'm, I'm reviewing first right of refusal is nice outfit and make sure he doesn't look homeless or we're good. Yeah. Yeah. You need that cause the man, you don't think about that now you got to make sure somebody loves you. That's what we say when we say a sad guy out there that's dressed all fucked up. It's got, the wife doesn't love it.

Speaker 2:          00:04:11       You need love in your life. Somebody who's a celebrity, celebrity doctor. But yeah, it's weird. I'll tell you the off the top of a long story, but we were not, we were talking about stern before we wrap up show, which is, which is these days equally as, as an honor, I've sat in the real seat, the Howard interview. See that's reserved now for like Gwyneth Paltrow. Yeah, no one gets in there anymore. But when I was in there, I will tell you it's very interesting seat to sit in because he, it's like he hypnotizes you like you're in a truth serum. He just got to go with them. It just got to become abject honesty and he just has this amazing way of just, just getting into such gifted and he follows his nose. It's from all his strongest therapy and stuff and all his, all the tributes him.

Speaker 2:          00:05:03       But I was a, this is the story I wanted to tell you. I was, um, my mother just started recently. It should very advanced age. No, no. Certain life should be celebrated when if they live into your 90 [inaudible] you had a good life. No is fine, everything is fine, but I was cleaning up her basement. I found a stack of my old mad magazines, 1960 to 1972 I'll be a whole cache of them and I thought, oh my God, Howard loves these things. I bet he loved this. So I went and I wrapped it up in butcher paper and I went and got bought a car. They'd wrote a handwritten note and I gave it to him and I was just totally crest fallen when, when the next day on the radio, he was just going off about why would somebody send anyone this piece of shit is crashing garbage, the spider web.

Speaker 2:          00:05:47       He goes, he goes, I'm going to wipe my ass and send him. I use toilet paper. He went off for 20 minutes about it and then it came up again. Today. Went off again today because apparently I brought up with Corolla. I'm the Adam [inaudible] podcast and a, and I told him I was, you know, I was looking forward to him hearing that, hearing that he liked this gift and I was just, just, it stung pretty bad. Of course it wouldn't be good radio if it didn't sting right. It had to be real. And uh, he, he would have been a mentioned became a 20 minute bid. That's his genius. Right, right. Uh, but it stung. It still stung. It's so Adam called Howard told them that I was unhappy. So that came up on the radio today. So there you go and you're going and Gary was talking about the area that sent me a note.

Speaker 2:          00:06:28       Listen to this Gary, something that tonight he got a text from somebody demanding an apology claiming to be me. And I was like, Hey, no, no, no, no, no. A million miles from that. I'm fine. I understand you're going to hurt though. If it didn't hurt, I also know, yes I was, I was crestfallen. I was stung. I was disappointed. But then I thought to myself, if it didn't sting, this would not have been good radio. It just has to be that kind of truth. You, you really just worried him to be like, I wouldn't have to go. I'm like, yes, yes, I thought of it. And really 20 a moment. Then again, it wouldn't be Howard stern if he wouldn't take something awesome and make it a neurotic. Absolutely. And gear. And Gary just goes, I sent him an email or your gear goes walking to why we're all good.

Speaker 2:          00:07:06       No good deed goes unpunished right here. And I thought that's true. In 30 years he's been dealing with that every little thing. He's like, I thought you'd like that stern boss. They're always talking about, that's the only place where if you do something good, it gets turned into. Whoops, hang. Just text me. Wow. That's from Gary. Pertaining to be demanding an apology. That's crazy. It's crazy. That's crazy. So the long story, it is crazy talk. Um, the, the long story is, uh, I, let's see, I think it take it all the way back. I was a third year medical, fourth year medical student and I was here in Pasadena living less than a block from what was then k rock k rock back in the day when you were 13 was this little shit hole or like a dental office. It was really a horrible, like I wish we'd taken video and stuff of it cause it was never will be recreated this, this kind of an environment and um, they're, they're kind of working on a documentary on it right now.

Speaker 2:          00:08:08       So yeah. Then they're interviewing everybody and Ron of course. And so, so it was, I would just, I was really getting frustrated with music and people started talking about the station and I, oh, it's up the street. How interesting. I started listening, getting gibbering got kind of excited about it. People I knew that live nearby where it's starting to go over there and new people. And this guy calls me that it was hanging out over there and he goes, hey, they've got the show in the middle of the night. Apparently two guys were just taking calls about relationships and their program director told them they need to make it a community service show. Right. They needed to make, cause they'd had be service hours. So they gave them midnight Sunday night to 3:00 AM Monday morning. Fantastic. And uh, but then they're trying to figure out how to make community service. And my friend, I guess suggested me or I'm in medical school, so maybe I could, and they call me and they go, Hey, I'll tell you what I want you, I want you to do a segment called ask a surgeon.

Speaker 2:          00:08:59       You'll use big words. It'll be really fun. What are you talking? You know, so they finally, long story, they got me in there. I brought my textbooks at my gynecology tax, my infectious disease textbooks. I literally carried textbooks up. They're really not having any idea what I was getting into, but I was freaked out. And, uh, Lo and behold, I heard these just amazing things coming. Being presented to was the poor man and the Swedish Eagle in the middle of the night. And Scott Mason, they'll still around. Yeah. It's all in the series and I thought, uh, I should, I should come back and, and what stucked out, what really stunned me was I was dealing with a lot of aids patients that and continued to the next five year thing, tons of aids work and no one was talking to young people about it. We'd just been to the sexual revolution where the adults, the perpetrator that never contemplated that adolescents would engage the sexuality.

Speaker 2:          00:09:46       Sure. Condoms were behind the counter yet ask the pharmacist for them. Now the term safe sex hadn't been coined yet. People were not talking to adults, young adults about this at all, about what was going on. I was like, Dude, so I was 24 I was like, Hey, I know what 19 nine year olds are up. 18 nine year olds are up to we gotta we gotta talk about this. And no one had ever heard, in fact, we just were transitioning from calling it grids to eight. We're, yeah, we're calling it aids then, but we weren't calling it, we had an identified the virus yet. Wow. We had, we had just were getting htlv three remember that? So the GLB three did you suggest talking about this on the air is that they came to him and so I just came in there as to do as little segment for Amenity Eagle and I was like, oh my God, this is like, I got to keep coming back and said hang out.

Speaker 2:          00:10:29       So it's sort of hang out in the hall and if something came up or if I was not calling and I'd stay there for like midnight to two or something to hang around. And finally I was started sitting at the table with them and being a part of it. And it was, he was, became a parent to meet early that it was a two man thing, like yeah, sort of a parent child kind of conflict thing or funny and strange and um, and I just thought it was important and I have for 10 years I was doing what I thought was one night a week community service. We really, I thought it was just interesting. It was like my social hour, I beat her sick people. We'd have guests in there. And it was just interesting and fun that my wife through there. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:11:04       And uh, and after 10 years of doing it one night a week, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. For free, for free. They put it on five nights a week. Cause I remember what happened was, I remember they, they, they got to re we, they moved it to like 10 to one at that point because they kept people. It's still had a buzz around. It was late cause it was sexual conduct. Yeah. Yeah. Years. I mean you had finished your internship and residency. Yeah. Oh yeah. I was on practicing and stuff. General General Medicine. But I was also doing at that point, let me think about this. 80, late eighties, I was doing running the medical services in a psychiatric hospital. So I was also doing, I was doing an acute care inpatient thing. I was doing medical services, a psychiatric hospital and then an outpatient medical deal. And um, but it was a lot, I was way work on two podcasts a week.

Speaker 2:          00:12:00       No, I was away. Workoholism like sick workaholic or like bad, bad, bad. Uh, and um, in 91, so now it was literally, I guess it was eight years now. So it was eight years of five nights, 10 nights, one night a week. They, they got a rating book on this show. They don't do the weightings book. Normally I had to ask for it or pay for it. And I'll never forget this. We got a 28 share. What this is like, is it a market where if you get a 0.3 are doing great. And I, I remember I called the program director, I go, look, I'm, I don't really know much about this, but I think we're all participating in something here. I didn't really know, but 20 it seems like crazy to me. He goes, I'll never forget this. It was [inaudible] who was the general manager, Kerrick.

Speaker 2:          00:12:41       He goes, cause if I had any balls, I put this on five nights a week, that's what I'm going to do. I'm gonna put it on five minutes a week. And I thought, oh cause I, you know, I was, I was working from five in the morning to 10 at night at that point to where it's very severe and um, and Susan immediately then got pregnant with triplets, triplets. And so she goes, she goes, if you're out five nights a week, it's not community service anymore. You got to get pay. So she sent me in to see somebody loved me, sent me and I hadn't handled it. Could you please, can I please get pay? I can't even, we're having kids and stuff. And that's where it all got started from that first offer. And I don't imagine it's going to be crazy, but like was it a decent offer?

Speaker 2:          00:13:23       $50 a show cause is show 91. Yeah. And but, but, but they sort of promised like we'll have a real contract at this goes how long does he stay at? $50 a shot. It didn't seem that long cause then it got syndicated and seven started to get paid a little bit, a little bit of that. Uh, and then in 95, these television producers turned up and I was doing with Ricky Rachman then and these and they were like, what's the TV show like? Aye. Aye. Aye. Interesting. It's all, it was all kind of an exploration for me. It's like I still thought I was doing kind of a community service cause there was nowhere for it to talk to kids about this stuff and I thought there was just so much encouragement of bad, unhealthy behavior at that. Well, we're just going to be here and be this advocate for decent behavior.

Speaker 2:          00:14:14       And uh, there's a long story there too. But eventually, uh, Ricky bowed out, he couldn't make a deal with them and they turned to me and they go, who do you want to do with this? And I was like, I have no idea. I'm fine. Just leave me alone to practice medicine if you really want it. I can do this on Friday afternoon and Saturday afternoon and that's it. Otherwise leave me alone. And I went out running one day and I'm, I was in a spot, remember the spot where it was when I thought guy, but that guy that does Mr Birch them in the morning could do this. We had met once before and I thought, I bet that guy can do it. So they, how much this many details to get into all of this. But they brought him out, they tested us, everyone seemed to like it put us in a makeup booth and they go, you guys work out your relationship.

Speaker 2:          00:14:50       We'll start filming in an hour. And I will, and we filmed for like nine hours, the pilot for love line that ended up on MTV, which by the way at that point was a fox show. Long story there too. She got canceled and then picked up by MTV. Well Auntie Annie was I think a decent home phone. Perfect subject matter. I think it might have failed the Fox. That's absolutely right. And, uh, but, uh, one, one sort of memory I have about that first day of filming the pilot is our stage manager, Tracy came up just who she became our stage manager that we went did it for like five years. And um, and just with your partner there was with Adam live TV knows this MTV and he hadn't even started the radio yet. We were just doing, doing this podcast, this a pilot for the TV show.

Speaker 2:          00:15:31       And we started doing the TV show before he came over to radio. And um, and Terry, she goes, how many years you guys were working together? We looked at each other with a, we met this morning and I thought, oh, that must mean something significant. Yeah. I even think that probably Miss Chemistry. I always wondered this like without like knowing, you know so much about the show, but you being a doctor and having to, you know, think about the advice you're giving out, whether it's being like healthy and you know, ethically, right. Yeah. Did you ever have those moments even though, you know it's entertainment where somebody asks something and Adam being comedic gives advice to your like you cannot say constantly, but yeah, I don't know what I mean. Like not just in like, hey, no that's bad. But I mean like where you get serious about it.

Speaker 2:          00:16:21       We let, it was not so much without him because he really had a pretty good instinct on things, but Ricky and format more, more of that. And I actually got an almost almost in a file and fight with Jon Favreau over this. He was in fabric fabric director, the director, he had just done a swingers. Right. It wasn't that a big breakout. That's right. And he was the guest on Loveline the TV show and this guy calls in and he was clearly schizophrenia and dangerously psychotic, like in danger of self harm or harming other people. And uh, complaining about in a paranoid way about people who are trying to make him take his medication and fabric goes, don't tell, don't let anybody tell you what to do, do not take those medicines. And I went, Whoa, Whoa, you got to stop. This is dangerous. This guy is actually sick.

Speaker 2:          00:17:06       Who Do you think you are? I'm like, oh dude, don't go there when you're talking to a sick person. And we got into it and a yeah, see that's the shit I want to see. I want to watch that. And then I had done in the next, so we would film show up to show after show we didn't know any better. We should have six shows a day out of my reach changing clothes and uh, and the next year I had a panic attack and, and I had to leave the stage cause I was like, I didn't realize because I was still upset from this fight with John and Adam comes into my, my dress stream. He goes, Hey, get the fuck get back out there. If I have to spend one more minute in this goddamn studio, then I have to because of you. I'm going to kick your ass, get gas in there.

Speaker 2:          00:17:46       He was like it. Ever since then he's like, you see, I cured your panic attacks anyway. Oh my God. So well that show love line there. I mean the early the radio show taught me everything about banks have anywhere else to go. Yeah. And My, my idea was the same in addition to being willing to talk about aids and things like that. My naive notion that 24 when I started doing was I wish I had, if I had had something like this, if I knew somebody with this fund of knowledge that I know how have no have, what would I want it to know? And I retained that sort of naive posture for about most of the way through the run of that. They've got a little more involved once, but towards the end of the nineties people were kind of more sophisticated. I think they're getting information from different sources and things.

Speaker 2:          00:18:30       And then the Internet just, let's see out of it in entertainment, because you live out here, you're involved in entertainment and you also know so much about, you know, mental health is, are, are there more like actors and comics and whatnot that are prone to mental health issues. So, so, so I told you I ran the psychiatric medical service. We'll then I transitioned over to running their addiction services and I really, a lot of my time was spent doing running an addiction unit for 91 to 2011, essentially. So 20 years I ran a drug unit. Uh, I used to hang out there for a long time before I started running it because then that's how I sort of learned about it and stuff. So it's about 25 years in addiction medicine. And um, slub your rehab came out of just somebody, a really good producer named John Irwin just came to me and said, do you want to do this?

Speaker 2:          00:19:18       I'm like, wow, what a great way, this would be really great to teach me about this, but this cannot be done. It's just not possible and you're, you're, you're kidding yourself. And he went to the hospitals and they've looked him like, she gotta be nuts. And we finally figured out, I figured out a way you could do it, which I took my team and I put them on a residential facility. I knew the director there. And he wanted to do it. It's a long story, but in the course of all this, I'm a professor at sc and the business school, he's actually a behavioral economist specialist. And I put together a questionnaire. He was interested in sort of the business of a entertainment. And I, and I, he and I had a conversation when he's my neighbor and I said, when you really shouldn't understand the people that are the product, the people that are the celebrities and the mattress, and I said, and then they're all sick.

Speaker 2:          00:20:03       I know they are because I've talked to him every night and they have an inordinate tendency, OTF trauma and other things. And he goes, well, let's test that because it was not published anywhere. So we sort of figured out a way to do that. We use something called the narcissistic personality inventory and everybody that came on love when filled one out for two years. And so we, so we collected 250 profiles on people and it was, you know, significant celebrities and reality, a good mix of reality and comedians and musicians and things. And we analyzed it all have malignant personally. No, like that definitely did it take to that, well the Melinda was the female reality show group. They were laughing at them, a liga personality ran Tom the politicians. We wanted to do politicians. That's our next frankly, because we know it's gonna be the same.

Speaker 2:          00:20:49       Uh, comics had more trauma. Musicians had more substance addiction. Yeah. Uh, and, and we were able to show that overall somebody who pursued being a celebrity was more likely to have narcissistic personality traits and narcissistic injury and trauma and substance abuse. Do we sort of, we didn't publish that data. We just published the narcissist and things and it became international press. He became, it was, it was spread all over the world. We ended up writing a book about it called the mirror effect. And so, yes, the point is somebody that look up this book now, it's called the mirror of fan and someone that, I mean it's very, you know, we wrote it in such a way that was pumped for general consumption

Speaker 3:          00:21:29       of this industry that we're in participate in. Yeah. As in large part. Like, you know, it, it is like the, the thing we wanted to do, we do it, we do it for a living. We enjoy doing it. Yeah. But part of me always goes like this overall might not be the healthiest well business to be in.

Speaker 2:          00:21:49       We were able to show that it was a bid to solve those traumas, connection between the the, and so, so it's a bid to solve. It's, it's, it's supposed to fill our emptiness, supposed to fill what's wrong. And of course it works when you're up on stage and stuff doesn't work. And then the other thing that my dad always brings us up to me about like his, his, uh, there's also college.

Speaker 3:          00:22:17       No, no, no. But he'll, you know, his, his outside observation. Yeah. Especially when, like, when, what was the, here's something when, when, when, uh, there's like a suicide or, you know, overdose or something like that. He'll be like, you know, he always talks about how, you know, it's such a struggle to make it in this business. Yeah. But he's like, man, the struggle once you

Speaker 2:          00:22:37       has to be, right. So we started looking at all that. And you've got to remember, you know some people, you know, people who become actors and say have you have no discernible skill other than kind of acting. And they put it all on this. Yes, you're willing to risk it all to be celebrity. It's like that's a pretty heavy bat and they don't back it up with any other training or any other disciplines or work or they just, I'm going to be this. And that's, that sounds really dumb when you break it to you. Right, right. Well, but stupid decision. There's a road and a discipline procedure and we were also able to show that celebrities that had skills were less narcissistic. So like a cello player, pianist, craft, craft, professional craft journalism salad on the street. That's right. And so we were able to show that.

Speaker 2:          00:23:24       So, and again, the reality shows the worst. Hey Matt, it's me. That's it. Just me. You can just be the way now, right? No psychological training. You can pick that up from realities. People. Hey guys, I was on road rules and the guys didn't come up with that whole group, came on our on Loveline of the TV show. You were a part of that. I wish but no, uh sorry. Um, but, but the other thing is it doesn't fix the emptiness and it also exposes people to shame because there's a disconnect between the adulation that they're getting from the outside and how they feel on the inside. And then they are fearful that people are going to see that inside stuff. And then if they are really famous, they have a group around them that insulates them from consequences. This all the time. Yeah. And so, so the, they don't get more addiction than anybody else will.

Speaker 2:          00:24:12       They do a little bit more but per our data, but they are not worse addicts. It's just, it spirals out further because there's no one there to bring them back. Is there any, cause I was thinking how unnatural it is to become a really big celebrity is you think especially about it. Anything else? Think about that. They have no other job. How would you have a real real, when you see super super celebrities, like there's almost always these weird personality traits that you see in quirks. You know like the Michael Jacksons where you're like Jesus Christ, but you also can't wrap your head around how famous is, I wonder if there's any healthy way to approach prepare yourself. Not really prepared because most people aren't going to have it, but like how to deal with that level of celebrity. It just seems like it's so, most people that I've met that are semi saying had some other career before really making it later.

Speaker 2:          00:25:07       It seems to be a health and later. Yeah. I'm even thinking of like Tom Jones and Julio Iglesias, so when you meet them they just go, hey man, I was just a soccer player and then all of a sudden this weird thing happened to me. It's like, but I'm still that. Just that guy like playing soccer and I like singing and I was good and look there. There's bewildered as anybody as opposed to, hey man, this is me. This is what it's all about. Which is a different thing. We talk about too with like with comedy, really the best comics in the world, um, are like at least 40 and usually late forties. And I think it's a much healthier example for comics to see that. Like, cause it doesn't happen usually at 22. You know that Eddie Murphy? Yeah. But like basically comics work for a long, long time. I think that prepares a lot of them for that exposure. A more grounded, it's a discipline. Your bed, you've been, we're a crap. And you're also treated like shit for so many. Actually. It's quite hard to get an ego from comedy. It's very humbling.

Speaker 2:          00:26:09       But you're working on that new hour, you're gonna eat shit after five minutes. So it's this constant thing of, of suffering really built into standup, which is great. Which is like, you find it's more like blue collar and then amongst entertainment, but it's also the new rockstar in a weird way for five years or so. Yeah. It leads been like, I'm very interesting. I'll even though the millennials are screwing that up, I'd like to talk to you about that too. Do you think our president is antisocial? Uh, I think it's just straight up. Narcissism isn't, well, we have so many people we'd like you to analyze, but I, you know, it's the politics to me and, and even just questions about what are the right and wrong ways for it to function stuff to me is so fantastically complex. I just go, I, I don't, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:26:58       It's humoristic to think I would know the right thing to do. I started worrying about Trump and I started thinking, okay, this is probably where, well, where else would we seen guys like this? Okay. We'll Andrew Jackson for sure. Very much. It's a duck at Andrew Jackson was Yosemite Sam. I mean, he was, oh, you're ready? Think about him. He was nuts. Yeah. I mean, it worked out okay. And that's a good for it. Some of the Indians and the southern area of the United States, but it worked for the country when we're done. Okay. Uh, and I thought, oh my God, Teddy Roosevelt was a malignant narcissist. They and bipolars hell and, Oh man, he never took a meeting sitting down. And you have to follow them through the park or he marched through a park and climb hills and stuff and everything was outdoors and moving and shit and blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 2:          00:27:38       And I thought, well, that he's my favorite president. I so I don't know the narcissist bipolar is good, bad. I have hell, I don't know. That's scary. I, um, I, I didn't consider this as a kid, you know, as a kid, presidents are just kind of like God's. Yeah. As I became an adult, I remember one time this conversation about presidents and personalities came up and somebody said something along the lines of, can you imagine the ego you would need just to run? Yeah. Just to say, I wish to that, you know, why did I do that? I promise. I remember thinking about that and that having that, having one of those like, Aha affects where I was like, Jesus, I've never considered that. That they all have to be pretty. Absolutely. Maybe Jimmy, Jimmy Carter not, and he didn't work. And it works good. It didn't work so well in the office.

Speaker 2:          00:28:27       It's a greatest, really think you're the shit. And I have a weird preoccupation with reading presidential biographies because I just one day at a similar kind of epiphany, I was looking at the Pentagon had a guy, the pennies, not just a profile. It's a person. Yeah. And I know it's something about how people work right now. What happened to that guy? His childhood, I need to know. So I started reading and dark red like 20 Clip Lincoln biographies and I'm reading grants biography right now, but Chernow's new thing. So good. So, so, oh my God, what's that? Lincoln severely depressive and well does an interesting wrinkle in that. Yes, he was, uh, he was sorta bipolar maybe too, but, but he, uh, really an interesting wrinkle if finally started making sense to me, cause I, yeah, all kind of fit together in my head the way I know how people are. I keep jumping out of you.

Speaker 2:          00:29:16       So, uh, a guy who wrote, uh, wrote a book called the Lincoln marriage, uh, discovered a whole trove of, of letter correspondences between Abraham Lincoln and a doctor in Springfield. We started seeing before he married Mary Todd and he found all these letters were Lincoln was convinced he had syphilis. I think that's why he broke off the first engage with Mary Todd. He saw a prostitute, became convinced there's all this syrup, but he went by the river and is all this. That's where the prostitutes hung out and uh, became convinced he had syphilis, dropped the marriage with Mary Todd. This doctrine letters, reassured him, take this mercury, you'll be fine. You can go ahead and give it Mary Mercury's, how they treat syphilis back. They treated a lot of things well and, and there's all this correspondence going all the way into the White House. He remains on the mercury most of the way through his presidency.

Speaker 2:          00:30:04       Do you know what the main side effect of Mercury is? Depression. Depression. And I thought, oh, that's why he had severe vegetative depression. There's a story of him pulling a willy, I think it was willy or tad down the street in a wagon down Pennsylvania Avenue. And they said he, they found him at the, at the Capitol building still dragging the wagon upside down with tad like a mile up the street and he was just going these vegetative depression by the way, that I feel like severely suicidal at one point too. They, they uh, what's acoustic? I used to sleep in the same bed with a, I forget his name. He had to go, Wah had put on watch with him. But I'm sorry. Another thing that I think you know, I've always heard about and obviously you get informed with these things, you know, little by little and more and more, but especially since podcasts and you start to hear from fans and P is, I can't get over how at least it appears to be, how many people suffer from depression?

Speaker 2:          00:31:03       Oh, it's 50% of stuff. Some sort of diagnosable. Hi, very common, at least at a lifetime will have a depressive. I had depression, I had severe. I kind of probably have a tendency towards it. I had panic and anxiety disorder and all that bullshit and college. Terrible. I'm okay. Yeah. Cause you can go on despite these things. They're treatable and they're part of life. The thing is you got to, I'm fearing now finally, and I was a real advocate for this forever, but now I'm thinking we've over medicalized it. We've overdone it now we're where you're not allowed to solve these problems through living and ordinary misery is no longer an acceptable component of life. Ordinary smile all the time. Right. I should be happy. Sigmund Freud when he arrived on this continent was asked a question, doctor [inaudible], what do you expect to accomplish here in United States?

Speaker 2:          00:31:53       I said, well, I hope to be able to finally distinguish between true mental illness and ordinary misery. Then that's a great quote because where's your misery? Part of live are living. Yeah, and we just, we just don't tolerate that and you should see real somber and sad. There's loss, there's misery, there's anxiety. This shit that stress. Life is stressful. It is part of living. But I mean I, I meant to say like when I brought it, just that like the, I guess the amount of the frequency with which it occurs, the, the a number of people that suffer from it, from podcasts, I swear I see so many messages that say like, you know, I suffer from depression but like I, I find some relief in listening to podcast people. Right. All that, that's great. That's it. I'd rather they do that to take her medication. Yeah. If you could do with that, that's, that's overcoming ordinary that that's being, you know, dis depressive. That's not a major depressive episode. You know, and, and again, people I think are not schooled on the fact that they should expect,

Speaker 4:          00:32:47       feels down some, exactly. The life is suffering a lot and there's, shit sounds the Hungarian, but I do feel like eastern European thing too, it's like we suffer, we suffer, they, they take, they take great pride. I should look up Hungarian insults. Oh creek cause of life. We are, we'll never eat and death is upon us as their regular party and we love and we make porn that is there. That's, that's their main export. That's the Paris support check, check, check. Girls will come over all Hungarian honeys. Um, so we had this kind of game we want to play. Okay. So we have some classic, we play a lot of, usually we have a lot of quick, we'll just play it at the top. We play video, audio clips from all over the Internet. People submit, send in like you know, watch. It's like just some, some content to basically address. Um, well we were hoping that you would maybe take a swing at is do you think the person involved in the clip is a, is taking drugs? Is it one a youtube? No, it's not. Okay. Or perhaps mentally ill. Perhaps both. What do I think is going on here? Why do I thinks going on here segment

Speaker 5:          00:34:25       before you have sex

Speaker 6:          00:34:28       that's going to be horny for two or three hours. Like you never been in your life. Any of access to marijuana

Speaker 5:          00:34:34       too good. We'd listen to me.

Speaker 6:          00:34:42       True. We'd alone can get you really hornier than normal, but it's been on drill. Take about 10, 12, Bynum girl before you want to have your sexual fun with your partner or whatever you do or masturbate. All right,

Speaker 2:          00:34:54       so what do you think? So I'm just looking at the environment. They're out here. He's got his jacket living in Versailles. So there's, there's, there's like he's, and he's sitting in an old, uh, sort of, uh, angry grandpa recliner and he looks like a young version of agriculture. Angry grandpa. They're younger version. He has some Cop d and if you see if you, you could see his, uh, the upper chest. He was using his accessory muscles to breathe, which means it's got some product, lung disease. Um, when he takes this balloon, which I imagine is nitric oxide, I feel like you have Steven Seagal, a pill and it just look at it and break it down. He does his pupils blow. If you'd look at dilated pupils, dilate, which night just can do that. And he's also got stair, which means you see the white above the IRS come back every week.

Speaker 2:          00:35:46       So this is all when you see the white above. But you know this, this, when you see white above that's drugs or hyperthyroidism. It's about the only two things. We'll do that with math being them probable cause. So this is now I'm putting and nitrous in the same dude with the tobacco problem because he's got emphysema. How does 10 to 12 Benadryl affects somebody? Is that a good idea that makes you agitated? That actually goes the other way? It could. It could delay ejaculation, which is what he's talking about. Yeah. I don't think he really understands his, what he's talking about, but that's what he's talking about. You recommend somebody, I would not recommend it because you get something called anti-cholinergic delirium from that where you really can get very like delirious. You get really well. Some of the weirdest psychosis I've seen a bit cynical and Miller anti-cholinergic delirium from drug overdoses really?

Speaker 2:          00:36:32       I mean they just get like, they just get white and that could be from Benadryl. I take a nap, anticholinergic side effect dependent. It's, it's what anti-histamines do in high doses. The culinary check system gets plugged in, right? So it's anticholinergic and, and it's, it's a really serious side effect. I mean, you can get sick so you're get it. We would never went to label anyone a legend. I don't know this guy, I don't know nothing about him, but he put this video up and I'm just analyzing when I seen, I'm just guessing opinion. There's a probability that maybe drugs are involved. Yeah. There's a reason why 10 to 12 Benadryl, it'll make you agitated. Yeah. Which I imagine too, which helps you. Well that's what you want me to finally have an excuse. And so and, and so, uh, you know, people think because too bad, it just makes me more tired.

Speaker 2:          00:37:26       Maybe three it makes him for, and then you got about four and you're getting into trouble. I get, I get exploding head from a two. What's the 50 milligrams panics? Floating head syndrome. You've heard exploding head exploding head is, you're, you're in, you're asleep and all of a sudden you get like this exploding sounded, it wakes you up. Like somebody knocked you on that really so weird. His thing. Yeah. It's going to explode again. I totally, by the way, not to be killing me. Sorry. But I really thought you were talking about your deck when you said that an hour later when you fill it, just kicking and smoke your weed, honey. Wheat is the least of my concerns was like millions and time. What is the, we like billions of times better from a professional standpoint. What is the deal with weed? Like the deal? Here's the thing.

Speaker 2:          00:38:18       I mean like, you know, we, we grew up in this era of like, I mean, when we were kids it was like, you know, you better watch out the dare program. It's still schedule one. People go to prison. Schedule One was a bizarre, it's bizarre. That's bizarre. You Go, you know, like I'm saying like in the, in recent years you had this whole medical, yeah. You know, movement. Unfortunately a sham, I'd rather just be legalized. And then now recreational has, has been evolved coming. Uh, so you, so there's no medical value. Uh, no. There's some, there's are some, but, but that whole sham, yeah. Yeah. Everybody's gotta have lights. I never, eight years of my career, I had never treated a single patient without a marijuana prescription. So No. You know, when you go in there you and ask if you have addiction, but treated for addiction before they just, here's your marijuana prescription.

Speaker 2:          00:39:04       And so that's bad medicine. I just, I just care that it's bad medicine. I don't care that this medical marijuana, it has some utility for some people. I've recommended it for people. I just recommended it last week for someone. I'd much rather see somebody on pot than, than opiates. Sure. Yeah. And I think our laws are insane. You know, alcohol and tobacco are good, right? Really good. LSD shouldn't ever be touched by human hands. Like what? Yeah, it clearly has clinical utility. I mean, end of life. LSD may be very youthful and cannabis is just cannabis. I mean, why is that one day there'll be, there will be problems and Colorado is sort of founding and finding its way through that. Um, but in terms of also just significant problems, adolescents care their hands, people getting stroked, getting addicted here and there. People having an untoward side effects from it, from, not very common, but I've treated a lot of it a lot.

Speaker 2:          00:39:56       It's very difficult to treat. Is it more, is it a psychological addiction? Addiction is either you can stop or here's what addiction is. It's a biological disorder of the brain where you cannot stop, you can't stop, you're addicted, you can stop, you have an addict, you're an addict. If you can stop, you're either not an addict or earlier in your disease process we, you still have control. Please get control over it. Don't let it get out of control. Oh, okay. So you like, you can also spot somebody in, in, during going down that path because addiction is a spectrum disorder from, you know, predisposed to incipient, mild, moderate, severe and then, and stage. Yeah, cause it's interesting like with, I mean I think we see it most probably most people are familiar with like alcoholism, alcohol. I think it's a little clearer. Alcohol has the unfortunate, the other category of the binge intermittent alcoholic, which is kind of a weird category that Bert, I'm not sure it's even a written anymore, but he's, he had sober October and all went well.

Speaker 2:          00:40:54       Yeah. I was competing with them know, and he was very concerned that the plane rides would be difficult. But you know what, he, I knew he didn't care cause he's, he and I talked about it. He's in that more earlier stages of it. He's not out of control. I didn't say it earlier and it's an early stage. I said earlier, she still has some controlling. This is what you should nip it in the bud though. Yeah. You gotta be careful. Yeah. Why did they consider alcoholism a disease? Well, yeah. So, so what is the disease you need to define disease first before, you know, I'll check the camera for you here. So you, you have to define disease and then decide, oh, this, this particular condition or disorder meet criteria for disease. So have addicts. It's cancer. It's when the cells go nutty and Joe's, so it's an abnormal physiology.

Speaker 2:          00:41:43       Cells go nuts. I had no biophysiology but you can't will yourself out of cancer, but you can't go home early in the stages, but later on you can't. Uh, but keep going. So He'd say it's abnormal physiology words, Everwell, physiology come from, we're going to reason our way through genetics. Genetics. Is it strictly genetics, genetics and environment interact to give you an abnormal set of cell biology? Right, right. Okay. And that cell by, how do I know that cell biology is going on? The abnormal biology, the pathophysiology. How do I know that happened out of I'm a comedian combined. You can reason.

Speaker 2:          00:42:17       There's signs and symptoms. There was signs and symptoms of somebody like me comes in and goes, those signs and symptoms mean pathophysiology here mean let's look at his jeans. Let's look at his environment, see how that occurred. What are those signs and symptoms do over time and breakdown or they grow, they progress or their resolve or they become product. They have, they have a what's called a natural history. And then what does somebody like me try to do it? Natural history. Well you, you try to alter it. We tried to alter, we tried to treat it, we do treatment. So disease is a complex relationship between the substrate and the environment that results in an abnormal state of physiology reflected in signs and symptoms that follow a predictable pattern. We call it natural history with a predictable response to treatment. Well, addiction fits that model perfectly.

Speaker 2:          00:43:03       I chat where people freak out is where's the cancer? It's in your brain. The cells are abnormally functioning in your brain. The pathophysiology is there, and we know a lot about it now and it's, some of it's chronic so it doesn't get better. And so it's always, they're loaded up, ready to go if you re expose yourself to the chemical. And so it, and it goes. And once you have real addiction, I mean bonafide addiction, volition has nothing to do with, you can't choose anything malicious, could be sideline, not treatable. At a certain point it's treatable, but you have to get somebody in a place where they can't use their volition, where they're there, where they start to understand that any thought, any impulse and he, any what we call stinking thinking and he desire I have is my disease. Cause it might the, all the, all the wonderful functions we have rational prefrontal and all that stuff, all those under the influence of distorted motivation which is as opposed to survive and thrive and protect your family, it's use.

Speaker 2:          00:43:59       That becomes your sole motivation. And that's a broken state of brain. But can I get back back to, we were talking about Bert, I don't want to talk about, let's talk about, let's talk about bread but I don't want to like you know, a bash them bash burst. But my question about someone like him is like, isn't there like people will use him as an example who like he's a late night guy, he likes to have fun. He, you know, he, he can party, drink a budge but then he could also, yes, yes. He does not have a, what we would call a high biological genetic burden. Right. Okay. There are some people they start and Kaboom, you go, I'm, I'm reading this book on grant. Grant had real deal alcoholism. He was like, Andy Dick, I mean real deal. When he would drink, he would just go all the way to the mat every time, every time.

Speaker 2:          00:44:44       And he could not, he couldn't do anything about it. There are grades to this, there are different biologies to it and there's grades to, it has, it has it, but he could be, I mean from, so that you can all end up in the same place as the bad part. Birkin go. I'm saying Burka go south, but he could also be fine, right? Yeah, yeah. He can live his whole life like this. Does he go, he can stay at this level for his whole life. He could just, sure. It doesn't have to progress particularly takes periods of abstinence and stuff like I was doing and he felt good during that. Abstinence. Great. And it was reinforcing to him so he might have more periods like that. Yeah. He felt great. It felt great. It was, I mean, I think it was healthy for everybody, but even Joe Rogan was talking about how he felt better when not smoking pot, which is like, yes, dude.

Speaker 2:          00:45:19       Right. You can't take them no mind altering or brain affected substance every day and not have it affect something. Plus we thought we did a bunch of hot yoga classes, so that also made us feel good. Good. You know, we did 15 in a month. Good at 90 minute classes. Yeah. Um, yeah. So did you go on Joe's a think tank? It's sensory deprivation and sensory deprivation, but, but I mean like it was, it was a fun, it was, I think, uh, exercises and discipline are just healthy. So like, even if you're not somebody that goes, like, let's say you don't, like, it wasn't hard for me to not drink for a month, but it's still an exercise in, in discipline. So I, I enjoy challenges and I like doing it is, but I push back a little bit against thinking about people or consume excess alcohol is not being disciplined because some of the most disciplined people I know can still have a problem over here with the alcohol. Again, thinking of grant then grant stuff. Sure. Super disciplined. But man, if you got exposed, yeah, watch out. Yeah. So and he would, and he would spend long periods of time. He was committed to the essentially early Aa, which were the temperance movements. He actually signed temperates agreements and stuff cause he knew he knew what he's dealing with. Yeah. And it's funny when people have the real deal, alcoholism. Yeah. They know. They know. They know exactly what's going on. Yeah. We think is going on here.

Speaker 7:          00:46:38       Hi Melanie. And I'm Scottio with ecstatic hearts. Tantra. Oh, I was just wanting to share that. There are many ways to, or NASA, oh Geez. You don't actually have to be having sex. You can orgasm just from hugging.

Speaker 8:          00:46:55       Ah, ah, AH,

Speaker 2:          00:47:01       drugs, delusional, delusional, mental illness. Well let's, let's go three data. We analyze the people again, here's the day he was not having an Oregon. He was pretending she might've been having an orgasm. I don't know how she got there. He might have been holding a vibrator or something. Everybody knows. Um, but first of all, we need to teach her both how to look into a camera. Yeah. That's a very disconcerting with, I'm looking off camera like that and it's not like they're bringing everybody, somebody they're way off camera. And then in a like a convention

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       center, like this has been some sort of tantric sex meeting, which is gross. It's gross. Weird. Right? It's weird, but he looks very happy that they're there. Yeah. She looks full of Shit. Basically full of shit stare. Yes. Like I, to me, it's just full of shit. He's just happy to be there. He's like, yes. I mean, yeah, he just wants to get laid. That's right. If you find a path to get laid and it, and like you hadn't been laid in a while. This is taking that pat, you're a male, are you kidding? But that's really what's happening is she's into it and then he's just using this coming along. So she's delusional, right about this horseshit. Is it just to get attention? Is that, is that what we're doing at the comm? Hugs, I'm guessing was called come hug by the way. I am guessing that, again, it's some sort of weird gathering.

Speaker 4:          00:48:23       The thing, maybe it's her friend that runs it and she's just a good example of how her friends or maybe she runs it. Maybe she's trying to commercial and the other thing is like you draw people in, you get attention, people sign up and then they're like, I keep hugging. I'm not coming though what's going on? And they're like, then you feel like you're not doing it right. You've got to pay for another, another set, another conference, or you start through the perfect scam or they start blaming yourself. Pretend that you're coming. Then you are part of the delusion, such bullshit. I mean, look at this fucking coming, look at his face. He's cracking up and he's like, really? He's just, and you know like he's this, his neck muscles contractions laughing. That's total bullshit. It's total bullshit. We cannot three of us kind of standard.

Speaker 4:          00:49:17       If somebody else's happy, you can't stand it. I don't like it either. I it bothers me when people can get joyful about things like that. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this one. I can't wait. God's love the fuck. Fuck. Oh, you're a hot black guy and you want to fuck me. If you want to move then you can move. Fuck the fuck the lot man. Free Food, free rent and everything else, man. He hasn't GL man. Oh boy. Hold on. Hold on. Jail, homeless or rum or thug. Want to come move in. Frankenmuth you too man.

The circles are run at the eyes.

Speaker 4:          00:50:08       Look, well it was the biggest draw. Slept in a month and then I just smell math. I can smell that. Yeah. Well the first time we play is interesting. I said, you know the funny thing about this play this over and over again. This is a regular clip, not worried about your soul's down. Forget is we're ruined. I know, I see that he really, I'm going to bring up my questionnaire but this, I was like, you know, just us some part of every man's brain that has wanted to like express these feelings like fuck me. But I'm saying for someone to actually pull out a camera and going to be this disconnected, all of it. This was somebody who was severely beaten as a child.

Speaker 4:          00:50:57       That's just all I see is just abuse, abuse, abuse. Again, to try to solve it or whatever. Whatever our brain does, it makes us do that. What's with the ball at his head? It's very dark. It's not his spot on analysis. It made this sad for me now and yeah, that's why I could never go to strip clubs and things cause I like all these women are supposed to be empowering. That's what they say is you guys don't get it pissed. Let me try it out. Fuck man. I'm looking at the hardcore guys want to, Julie and I wanting to live with it. I'm a hot white trash. Go do your five bucks. People just send this into. So that's nice. I'm so glad I'm talking to your fans.

Speaker 4:          00:51:51       Very nice. Laughter. At least a varsity level. You don't have to give me college. What do they call it? Fort with the big level football though. Division One Asian one. Don't give me a division one varsity highschool bar. Ready for that. There's so much to show you. I'm so glad you're here because we clips. We laugh. I laugh. I'm glad I get to see this. Do you know what the door shut? Yeah, it's dead. It's deeply troubling. I told, I told her this before, every time I go, I've met porn stars immediately. Like I don't see them as sexual beings like you, cause you, you make it. What's going on? So I go, I mean, I totally understand. Did you see the sex rehab shirt? We did. So Jenny Ketchum, penny flame flame is now just graduated from social work as an MSW at University of Washington. Maybe getting a phd. She's amazing. She's getting married, pregnant. She is phenomenal. I ask a only if it's like, like a public thing. I would say I'm trying to say about

Speaker 2:          00:53:25       the patients. Yeah. About, about her or if it's not known or public, then I'm not, I can't tell you if it's not, but like uh, so was she traumatized we, he's talking about, or everyone's trauma came out of the show, but for some reason people either watch it or didn't get amplify. There were specified enough. I mean like Jeff Conway is trauma was so profound, so unbelievable and ritualistic and people are like, I wonder what's wrong with Jeff? It's like you didn't hear him talking about he was dragged into a child porn ring and he was beaten.

Speaker 2:          00:54:01       Yeah. I feel like every one of them I don't treat. I always tell people if you have bad enough addictions that you need to see me as a hundred percent probability of childhood trauma. Really? Yeah, a hundred percent now I'm not saying that all addiction has childhood trauma. I'm saying if it's bad enough that you need to come to somebody like me, it's this childhood trauma. And it's bad Jenny and horrible stuff. Well, that's what I learned. Watching celebrity rehab. I think that's what I, right when I started getting a therapy is there was that trend of, I mean we discussed this on your podcast. Person would go in and drew and be like, how was your childhood? It was fine. Yeah. Oh yeah. Except for the part that my dad beat the shit out of me and my mom. No, I, I'd have to go.

Speaker 2:          00:54:39       I'd have to go. I'd have to go. We'll, do you have any physical abuse? No. I go, I go. Did anybody ever discipline you? Well, like anybody, I got this and then I go. Okay, good discipline. So they hit you? Yes. Oh, of course. I needed it. I everybody like anybody. I needed it. I go, did anybody ever pick up an object and hit you buy belts and did they use the buckle end? You all? Of course. The BUCHLA. Oh yeah. It was one time it was a bad oh yeah. And the hatchet. Oh yeah. And the bow and arrow. And then it just starts and they think of that is normative and they needed it. That's how they get it and they internalize it like I was serving at that which is, which is the child feels so powerless that they flip it into an causing this.

Speaker 2:          00:55:18       I'm making this happen to me because I need it cause I'm bad. So Ron and daddy can't be bad now because I need them to survive. That's right and what happens is those unresolved feelings of trauma turn into not like you just said, sometimes addiction, sometimes they manifest what later in life is something but can be treated. Yes. Right, right. That's the big highlight of this. I thought you were to tell us something specific. I just want people to feel, I don't want people to feel hopeless listening. Oh Shit, I was hit and am I screwed. My fundamentally, the way I think about, the simplest way I look at it is that you need closeness of other humans to develop the mechanism for emotional regulation. That emotions if you've been traumatized or to trow prolonged, too intensive to negative and the way that is healed is in closeness with another human.

Speaker 2:          00:56:04       Unfortunately when you've been traumatized, you don't trust other humans anymore and you exit the frame of closeness and you never go back until somebody in therapy finds their way back in with you and that person that holds that frame and just listens to you and racks. How hard is it? Cause this is one of the things I think maybe I don't know that a lot of like the amateur audience watching a show like that would, would have difficulty processing is the the level of distrust from some of the people that you're treating. All of them. I feel like though like aren't they? Isn't it hard to break down? Yes. Truth from this, how it turns me into a gigantic mind reader. It does. I got to the point, I'm a little out of practice with it right now, but where I could, I could just trust whatever came out of my mouth without thinking about it.

Speaker 2:          00:56:53       You can trust whatever comes up. When I could, when I was really skilled at this, I'm a little bit rusty right now, but, but I, I would just, I would, I would do what's called, I would listen with my whole body. I would not listen to what they're saying cause I know what they're saying is all bullshit. And I was just listening to the whole body. If I felt something or heard something or smelled something, I would immediately go, I immediately go, hang on. I'm just, I'm not sure if, does this have meaning to you? I was smelling like, Oh that's my dad was always making bacon when he'd fucking throw grease on me and burned me out there. Okay, well I just happen to smell some bake. I don't know why because people, it's so, it's all compartmentalized and I'm literally picking up on disavow, disconnected parts of the south that are crying out for attention but, or disconnect from that human consciously.

Speaker 2:          00:57:37       But it's there all the time creating all kinds of commercial turmoil in that person. And I sort of, they sort of, they pick it up like that fried thing of your unconscious reading. Another person. Yes, yes. That's what it is. But I, but I think, but I think it's that sort of a, it's not a evolved enough way of thinking about it. I really feel like there's so much information going back and forth between two bodies in proximity. It's really not just the brain, it's our entire central nervous system, including our autonomic system. And we just, we just can, we send stuff back and forth to people. And if you really listen, if you learn to really train yourself, and I, and I also trained myself to be able to know when people were not telling me the truth and I would just go, that's very nice, but you're full of shit.

Speaker 2:          00:58:20       Stop it please. And I could just trust it when that would come out of my mouth. And, and most of the time, most of the time they would go, oh, how'd you know? Yeah. And they'd go, I don't even know what to bull shit anymore, but I'm glad you helped me. I need to know what I'm, cause I still have worked with some master manipulator. Oh my God. And I had been manipulated and I've been had and whatever, but, but you, but, but I can, if I do feel it, I can just go, Eh, you want to work in the or not shut up. Reminds me of, by the way, this I mean to say the skill set you're talking about is watching like detectives in um, not a lot different. And then you see like we used to watch a lot of the first 48, uh, and um, there is certain detectives that that was the hook of like that was you get excited about you.

Speaker 2:          00:59:04       Like she is amazing. She would like, there was this one, yeah, Sergeant Mason, I think in a, in Tennessee. I still remember her name and she would go in and the guy be like, I didn't, I didn't do anything. I wasn't there. And she had this ability to connect. Yeah. And five minutes later you just see. Yeah. And then they would confess. It was amazing. Did you see behind Hutter? Yes. I'll watch the whole thing. You got some of that stuff came out in that too. Oh, it's fantastic idea. Yeah. Yeah. Fantastic. I remember even when he met that first guy, he was like, well, how'd you feel about it? It didn't feel right. Well there you go. Listen to this. You're were. We're perfect instruments. We really are. And if you've been injured, that perfection gets expressed in crazy ways. You like women that repeatedly go for abusive guys.

Speaker 2:          00:59:50       If you're attracted to the guy, definitely that's going to be an abusive guy. If you have that path, do you have that pattern? If you were abused as a child and you have that power as adult and you will, you think that's a great guy? Guaranteed that guy's gonna be, I know he looks nothing like an ax. Nothing like the other ones. Still. That's going to be some guy guarantee like I've been, you know, we've all have interactions with like bad dudes. You feel it. You feel site like Predator dudes. You know what I mean? Guys? You're like, this doesn't feel right right away. You feel like sometimes you can, I don't know. It could be out in public. You can be introduced to someone and you'd be like, I don't want anything to 3%. Yeah, good times, Huh? Yeah. That's what I have to watch. Videos.

Speaker 4:          01:00:29       Oh, the women practice on the egg. What did the men do? Okay, the Amanda first thing, the have to practicing that we call sharpening the knife. Okay. The whole key. So we caught a egg, the baby oil oil and you put the in and now put up eat peanuts to warm up in the cold winter. You warm them up, you get a hot power, okay? And you'll make it a one. The what? The hand you put your hands and then make sure order blood flow on your penis. Okay, now you'd get the penis out. You pull the skin. A lot of people, they never succumb. The horse had skin to skin and you get the oil in the hand and your hand going ids to rob, rob, rob, rob, especially on the Klan Penis, 50 time Ras, because you make them strong and not sensitive to the time.

Speaker 4:          01:01:26       Once a [inaudible] 50 times left side. Phil town from 50 times, 50 times I three feet. Okay. How often am I doing this? You have to do every day until you can control every day time consuming. Extremely sharp knife. Okay. All right. You're done traveling at night. There's the number one. Number two, you have to learn how to contracting the prostate gland. When men, it's accolation the pressure of the circulation if from the prospect and contracting. Okay. Exercising exercise one and four people have positive land stolen up a problem. This one who solved the problem and now you do it until you feel okay. Awesome. Oh really? Yes. Okay. I call orgasm without ejaculation, right? Yeah. So you feel, so you see when you do, when, when you get it, it's very quick to two times. You can

Speaker 1:          01:02:29       yep.

Speaker 4:          01:02:31       When you squeeze it all guests, I'm coming up. Oh good. So what's happening here with him? He's a teacher. He's a tantric guy. A D two pieces, a lot of things actually. What else? Well, he, he also teaches women, um, you know, to rub their nipples and um, and I think it puts an egg, well, he size up your vagina, muscles are loose, then your door is open and all the energy leaks out of your vagina. So you need reminds. Is he a yoga guy? A tantric guy that's been around for a minute. Like we, we, after we, this was the first thing we were exposed to about him and then we found what's his at this, I can't figure out what you guys think. He's ty. Ty. Yeah. And then um, then he did like a female one in the same interview and then somebody found a like a 25, 35 year old clip of him and he's been doing, this is like your kidneys are Tega do testicles.

Speaker 4:          01:03:25       You got rubbed your back. Like, oh my God. So wait, you said that's not right when you said the orgasm is in the prostate, prostate doesn't move. He did the, the pelvic floor musculature contracts. But that's not through your prostate. The seminal vesicles are what are holding the semen, the prostate, just to gland. That's sort of slowly producing fluid and story at the seminal vascular. It's, it's not really any other activity. Mm hmm. And what about sharpening the knife? Is that an effective feel about times? Rob, Rob, rob? I think the whole point of this was about control. Yes. Yes. And that's why it sounds her a tantric life. Yeah. But then like 300 times 300 strokes a day. All I kept thinking was 300 times two seconds, the chart, because it's about 600 seconds or so. Who the fuck has time to do this every day?

Speaker 4:          01:04:08       And I'm worried about that person's soul. Again, I'm worried about the souls of all these people that you're showing me because their priorities don't seem right. If that's what the practice by with doing every day there's better mindfulness then sharpening the knife. So I'm saying okay, not a priority. Seen better mindful practices. There's a possibility that this guy is a bit delusional. Although as a no, I don't think this guy is mentally ill. I don't think. You don't think he has? No, no. I just think he's a Weirdo facing straight up here though. That's the thing. There's a thing as evil, bad weirdo that they exist. Oh, I'll raise you one. Oh Jesus. And when we got to Varsity, uh oh no.

Speaker 9:          01:04:53       Oh, I just want to let you know there is really the two my dex or release, yet they're on a shrimp Scampi boat and uh, like they are like getting turned into Lasagna. So, um, I need your help getting a rescue boat over there and, and a day they really need your help getting rescued. So could you, uh, please, please say yes.

Speaker 4:          01:05:23       What did she say? She's talking to talking to Hillary. She's blogging to Hitler. He's asking for the fear. She's asking him for a rescue boat. Two friends that were returned to the Scampi. Gabby boat. They're trying to get into the zone yet. Okay. So, but Hitler is the guy she's talking to that she sings happy birthday to again, I always leader of the third one. I always like to look at the environment and I look at all that stuff, but she's a really big fan of that. A one direction. Yeah. Reminds me of people that set up, you know, sort of shrines and things to people. They go and try to murder them. It looks like that kind of thing. Yeah. And when you, if you close your eyes and they'll look at a radio listener voice, she sounds like she's about six years old, which is an interesting thing that happens in severe trauma survivors is they've, their voice stops, talks about this on a and the sex stuff. Second, maybe we should, uh, have a new title for our cash and if, um, no laughing matter now if, and if she's not just sort of being bullshitting, she's severely psychotic.

Speaker 4:          01:06:29       When you close your eyes for a second, close your eyes and that what he's wanted of you to hear, Hey Hitler. So I pushed that. Hey Healer. No. Oh No. Hey Him. So severely psychotic. Yeah, because of the eyes and no, I don't see it in their face. Right. It's just what she's talking about. Oh, so disorganized and almost, it almost sounds delirious. Like she's like, well, why don't we lighten things up a little bit. Good. Yeah. Um, varsity, low

Speaker 10:         01:06:57       old. Are Your thoughts on this? Not Somebody talking, but just to see like what you find funny, what you don't find funny and steel reaction. And then maybe you can, he's going to zoom right through there. No, he's just sent me

Speaker 11:         01:07:22       car. Oh No. Okay. Why? Except I know what that injury is. That's bad. That kind of a correction really bad. I mean it's funny, but it's not funny. Could be dealt with in a few minutes.

Speaker 4:          01:07:50       Thank you. Okay, so let us clue you in on what the debate is. Crush injuries like that. Those are common and they, they ungloved they'll, oh, it's just the worst. Worst. Often the leg will just split open and ungloved and Tara, the skin comes off entirely. And then depending on how bad the crushes, you know, whether or not their kidneys fail because their muscles crushed and going into their blood system and how bad the blood supply is cut off and how much orthopedic injury there is there. Yeah. It's just those

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       are catastrophes. People often amputees. Yeah. Right. And that's really funny, right Tom? No, but let me be fair. Let's be fair about something. So I've always had and I've admitted to it. I think the way I deal with with physical injuries to people should laugh. I laugh. Yeah, and I've, and I've done it for 30 well she thinks I'm psychotic. No, I think it's a red flag too. I had a nurse, remember Sasha. Sasha would laugh in the most horrible situation. She was all of a sudden started giggling. There's nothing she could do about it and she was, she's a great nurse and really compassionate, but she had this weird nervous thing when when things got really rough and said terrible things start happening, she break out like full laughter. I was like socially and find that clip. So funny when people are like, he's a second path later, we see it in front of him because I've watched the clip several times and we've had other guests on and I can't laugh because I have left, said how funny it is.

Speaker 2:          01:09:17       What's called empathy. It's funny if it were the three stooges, the whole, the whole problem is, it's one thing that bothers me about physical slapstick humor is you. You believe that that's just funny. Or if somebody gets hit in the head. It's just funny, funny, mild head injuries. Fuck people up for six months. Yeah. Yeah. One of Moe's or just the fingers in the eyes. Of course one of Mo's box on the head would would be six months of trouble and I, and it's, it is funny when it's the three stooges, Laurel and hardy in this case. What's funny also is that his reaction, I think also because it's foreign, like you don't understand what he's saying. Yeah, you can. You can be, there's some distance you can get from it. You get distance from it. It's a, it's an almost comical reaction. So there was a quality of the reaction that was like, oh my God, that's funny.

Speaker 2:          01:10:06       And that was like, oh my God, that was really a pin. A pending pending against the wall. I remember when I worked, I worked a construction one summer in high school and this guy had a sewn in a like morphine drip pack for his neck and I was like worst. I go like, why do you have that? And he started telling me like very seriously, he was on this site and they were removing a bathtub from the third floor and it, it fell out from the, the, the lift and it crushed his neck. I laughed so, so hard, les. I love that. Well, he was just looking at me and then he got, he realized that he started telling me all these other injuries stories and then he got to the point where he'd be like, ah, I just remember you're going to love this one. So he would do it to entertain me. Like one time it was on the site and I broke my arm doing this. And I've always found that's how I process. How can we bring the guy around with you all the time? I mean, it just, it just, I don't know why you should become an orthopedist. He would never stop laughing. I laugh all the time. Wait, so why do we do that? Because I laugh at things that are inappropriate as well. Well, you're now you're asking me what's the nature of humor

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       and laughter, which is a really complicated question, but his, his reaction to that man hurting, being harmed and possibly dying is, is laughter. Um, and that is numbers that evil exists on the spectrum of EOP on mind hunter, is that what you're saying? I'm not sure it's that kind of problem, but, oh, and what about this drew on? Something's really wrong with me. Oh yes. He's dark, dark sided. Dark side. What about the fact that my husband Paul, incredibly compassionate. Okay. When I'm falling asleep at night, he'll watch TV and he'll watch. It's all, if you look at his Netflix Queue, it's murder, murder, murder, psychopath, serial killer, drew. They make all those shows just for me. Yeah. Isn't that neat? Yeah. They go like really deep into post production for me. We'll talk later. Yeah. Yeah. What's going on? So just for you, it's just me.

Speaker 4:          01:12:06       I've talked to them. They've said it was just for you on orders, just for meeting all that starts 48. It's just all me likes that. Should I be concerned? I think I got to go down, but he's such a gentle, yeah. The thing is he would never hurt a fly. Yeah, exactly. What'd you do as a kid? Were you twisting rabbits next and all the people, I do it now. Let's see if I can really stock, you know, God, pick someone and I go fallen you. Oh my God. You gotta get to know their habits when I go to work. Okay. Anyways, anyways, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:12:46       Here's another one that's not like those other ones. I swear. But I really want your opinion on this and then, yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:12:51       he didn't want my opinion. All the other ones. No, no, no. I'm saying like, this is interesting one, I think seriously. Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:12:56       Sweden is the most food thinking country in the world when it comes to questioning gender. The gender neutral Pronoun Hen is now commonly used by most Swedes,

Speaker 3:          01:13:06       so that's just a little intel beginning, beginning.

Speaker 7:          01:13:09       This is Nikos Drum on how this Nico, Nico is two and a half, almost five and a half. Mika and Nico were both assigned male at birth and this family, the sex you were born with does not dictate your gender identity.

Speaker 3:          01:13:24       So then, so we're giving you just a little context for this.

Speaker 7:          01:13:28       We use key for them. Sometimes it's next and it depends, you know, because in Sweden we have hen the gender neutral pronoun in Swedish. I think Mika has always said when I've asked it's been she or Ken, uh, changing pronouns in book instead of it always being mama, we say Mama and mark par. What's the matter Sweetie Yak [inaudible] it's so dark.

Speaker 3:          01:13:57       So just to give you the full thing, what, what did the next clip is also what I want you to weigh in on. There's this family there in Sweden. Um, you understand that, that they were talking about the pronouns here and then these very young kids are,

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       uh, how they're getting different, um, hormones. No, they're just daily being given the option to choose pronouns and it switching over to a half and five year olds or they're being asked, hey, what would you like me to call you?

Speaker 7:          01:14:28       Okay, that's a pond. And they ended up, that's not something I always have to say, but it would be good to note to Dave for the film, The Sky Hone Ella him. Just Mika. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:14:43       So the kid answered, um, just by name. Yes. Do you think that there's anything, uh, odd to asking? Very small children their gender pronouns? I don't know, cause it was, it's unusual. We're not used to that, but you would have to be really studied, have to see what the outcomes are. Right. I'm a little concerned with the biological reassignments. Uh, the crazy American Academy of Pediatrics just came out strongly against it. Um, is that being done? Oh yeah. Wait, what do you mean reassignments? They're born, they're being, if they say, I feel like a girl today around, I've, even though a boy, you better get on those hormones. We're right away keep the three year old and uh, the j the concerning and we don't even know the full medical consequences of that either yet. So it's all, but people are doing that. Oh yeah. My crazy butt. But I, this part I, I'm sort of agnostic about. Yeah. It's like, it's like maybe it'll be, I dunno. Maybe would be good. Okay. I, I'm more worried with the way this guy's treating his children. It does not feel very connected or empathic. Yeah. It feels very,

Speaker 12:         01:15:51       yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:15:52       Tutorial. Everything's very like weird and formal. I mean babies just because the camera's there, I don't know. Right, right. Oh yeah. But it would not feel comfortable being his, was he dad or mom? What does it, oh, you would not feel comfortable having him as my mopar. Right. I mean feel weird if you're that kid, that's where she's like, Hey, shut up. Calming Mocha. Yeah. Stop asking me comfortable. Do you think something mental is going on with this type?

Speaker 7:          01:16:17       Um, don't understand like why you bitches and people is May this because I say I'm black and Andrea to Dakar. Sam Let, but at the end of the day, what is the race anyways? Your family. Cause like we outlined, we are here on this world's supposed to be equal. It just in the past people was messed up and stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:16:44       Oh honey, what's going on here? I feel so angry at our educational system. Sometimes I really get angry substance stuff. I don't see anything metal. Why? Nothing mental health wise, other than the little angry, but, but just like, come on everybody. Let's go back to school. Wait, let's be able to function in society. Yeah. You want your

Speaker 13:         01:17:10       daughter to stay at a fuck bitch. Why would you with somebody you don't know this real sad and obviously you can see I'm not ugly bitch in my head. Go down. Might be a little fat. Never claim to be skinny.

Speaker 13:         01:17:37       and I don't see Nancy and I don't see Nancy anyway, but as soon as I get it for you.

Speaker 4:          01:17:55       Yeah. You know he'll, he'll talk about it being raised around that. Oh really? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Louisiana. He does not have good feelings about what was going on there. Really? Yeah. It was pretty good. Stuff's going to get me in trouble with the racial stuff. Tommy, what's that word that you taught me? Where you choose your race? Oh, trans rate. That's interest. That's, people are like saying like, like it'd be like me saying, you know is I was born. I know, but you see, but I'm actually Filipino.

Speaker 15:         01:23:34       And I don't know it was in the drink, but I blacked out.

Speaker 15:         01:23:39       She had both of my legs over her shoulders and I'm, she was numb sucking my asshole. Like there's no tomorrow

Speaker 4:          01:23:46       numb sucking. What is it? I'm sorry.

Speaker 15:         01:23:49       I tried to find it. I tried to get away, but I was restrained. She told me that I liked it. You probably, Jay told me not to worry because she used the good jelly. The shmuck says, I mean, is this something we don't know who this, nobody's paid me to confess this now, and I've kept it under wraps for all these years because I knew that no one would believe me. No one will believe that Hillary Clinton. Oh my asshole.

Speaker 4:          01:24:18       Oh my gosh. But doesn't his, his. I feel like there's something going on and tell him the truth. I can't tell. I can't tell what he's not telling the truth. I don't know what's up with [inaudible]. Ryan sickler. It's very funny comedian. Oh, is it? No, no, no, no. I thought it was him. I'm looking for my favorite picture here for you guys and the Juggalos. Yes, my check a little picture. I'm going to find it. They could really use you in that community. Yeah. Maybe I just don't want them to kill me if I show up. No, you think that this love pops. We've had a bit of a rest time now for some triangle or assaulting and Templeton few pop place seems really simple because most people just get huddle hobbling around and going more for, for buck buck. But it's really so much more complicated.

Speaker 4:          01:25:08       But that guy started this pup play training in New Zealand writing training and he's got all these guys into it there and he was, um, basically like, oh, it's a fun, get together. You know, like, well first he was like, just a bunch of guys enjoying each other's company and then later it's like we also ejaculate in each other's face. And yeah, that was a big secret, you know, after we, so, so that's sorta like the furbies furries. Yeah. On that video there. It's all like, you know, on the up, like it's like we just hang out and I treat them like dogs and then we found videos of him online in a different light where he was basically like, run your finger along new. Correct. If your ass, you don't need to figure your home. You don't want to come back with shit on your finger.

Speaker 4:          01:25:57       No, you don't want that. Yeah. But he was instructing people in a much more graphic way when it wasn't a news piece. Of course he didn't want to. Yeah. What's that? Oh there we go. Oh my gosh. Violent J and Shaggy. So drew, show me a picture tonight on love line. You had these two guys on level repeatedly. The insane clown posse. These guys are many times ICP, they're my buddies. I've heard them on a stern before they, they're seen front and they're fun. Guys like come to studio like this. They never seen anywhere without either a Mexican wrestling masks mask or that a comic upon ever. They've never been seen is a lot of work. Yeah, that does seem like a lot of work. Do they do it themselves and imagine the guy with the hockey mask wearing that makeup that then he starts to make sense, does it, right, right, right.

Speaker 4:          01:26:45       That's what he was looking at you, what's your take on, you would look like shaggy or you know, people make fun of Juggalos a lot and like ICP and all this stuff. But then I love them though, bring about how business savvy these guys are with this, you know, the brilliant and, and there, there's a whole philosophy of stuff and it's hard to argue with them. I mean they really are conditioning guys and it is positive, right? They're all about this. A little bit too much aggression and violence when they gather, but, but other than that, I have no quarrels. All right, well we'll look, we want you to go home and have salmon. I want to see support for videos. Oh, okay. Right. Oh my gosh. Your mom's house. We got 'em. You asked for it. Yeah. Oh, same girl. No. Do you think?

Speaker 4:          01:27:28       Do you think she really does this or somebody playing with a video or sound effects over is a rooster in the background? Do you know who you chat is the best idea? You think? Do people pay for this? That's the thing that we're trying to figure out. Is it sexual? Yes. Yes. It's super get off on this. It's not just comedy. It up. A while ago a guy wrote in and he was like, well, the whole thing is seeing a pretty girl do the dirty thing. That's what he gets off on a dirty thing. Well, you know why the rest of us just laugh? I don't know. Some cake farts. Who has, come on, let me see if I can definitely had a bad child. I mean you don't find on the Internet cause things were good and your childhood, you know, there's, there's a high degree of secondary enforcement. What's that? She gets paid a lot probably to do, it may just be one of those things. It's a hundred dollars a hundred dollars, I think. Uh, Susan says she's tired and she made a crappy dinner. Oh, that'd be like, I'm glad I'm not there. Should I put her on the show? Get on the phone. Yeah, we're watching fart videos. Do you think something's going on? Um, we're gonna show you the king real quick.

Speaker 13:         01:33:07       No, before I, after I bleached my butthole, make sure you listen to this podcast the doctors do about forest or my counter would just depending on what kind of mood I'm in. The dark [inaudible] podcast, Adam Admin, drew podcast and weekly infusion. Oh, it of course. Calling out with Susan Penske, which I'm resurrecting. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:33:28       Oh, I'm not sure you want this crowd over there, but okay.

Speaker 13:         01:33:32       They've already been on the show, honey.

Speaker 4:          01:33:34       No, no, not these two. I mean the people that did find them amusing in their current mom's house. Okay. All right. Well I'll be home soon enough. All right. Love you too. Bye Bye. Just, it was beautiful. Yeah. The your show, what's it called? Sorry, I've forgotten the you live. How do you have time to do all of this shit? What the hell doing? I'm just to crank them out. So you're like a pro podcast or, I mean, I'm, I'm like, it was a serious workaholic though. So everything seems easy to me since those days. Yeah. This is the fighter, but he also does gluttony videos. Three fucking Oh beef and shut her sandwiches. Slop with fucking manager.

Speaker 4:          01:34:18       He's in Brooklyn too. Full complete disappointment. You don't like to eat anymore. It's hard to watch. Yeah, but he, but I love how fucked up people are. Very weird. Right? There's, there's also videos. He gets out a bunch of this food and farts on it and then he said, I want, I want, I'm not interested in him. I mentioned that. Who's watching him? Yeah. Like who we've brought him to a lot of people. I mean a lot. Dual. Yeah. Yeah. It makes you want to throw out. Do you think this is like a fetish thing? Yes. All this is off of it. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:35:03       Any, anything that's sexual that shouldn't be sexual, you know what I mean? Why? Why do you think gluttony? How does that turn someone on? I, I've, I don't, not an expert in this area, but I've always had the sense that it was something to do with being force fed as a child or something. It was two gratifying or maybe the breastfeeding was done at two an aggressive away or something. So they always feel like they're overwhelmed by it. Yeah. Just do fart videos and then a, then he started doing the glider evolved as an artist. Yeah. He really did evolve. Paid for these things, right? I think so. But you know, we've never really found his pay stuff more fucking gluttony already know.

Speaker 4:          01:35:45       Yeah. Gaining leading community. Yeah. I'm wondering if it's my channel, gluttonous slob and go to the pig out checkout button. I'm wondering if it's so we know you guys asked me for cash is gay or straight gay? There's no women that are interested. No, no. I'm other heterosexual men. It's all, everything weird is mad. Let's face it. A heterosexual men or straight or gay man. Maybe that's why he won't answer US genes. I think because we reached out to him so many times and I think he needs to keep his business in tact. I think it's gay guys that are in there that he, uh, he goes also by, I fart in your face. That's a, but he, we really, this is him here. This is like him and his hard drives to the Florida, our dresser to Fart on, you know, and he would just post these

Speaker 1:          01:36:34       videos.

Speaker 4:          01:36:40       Camera Quality. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:36:45       God,

Speaker 4:          01:36:47       Oh, everyone has their own towels. You know, there's a big scandal about those five videos with him was that he'd handle, but people didn't believe they were genuine. He was shooting heroin to himself. Okay. There will still be genuine in a weird way. Well, yeah. Well, let me ask you this. Medically speaking, I mean, is that really possible? What that guy's doing or is that fake? It's possible is that the bacteria can produce a lot of gas. Right? They split that I tried to do is waste. Are you writing this down then and so the methane that's produced by the bacteria, it can be high volume and if he holds it in for periods of time and then films it when it's time to go, yeah, I can see where it'd be. Probably probably knows what to give him, feed himself to get the optimal and sometimes swallowing air. Sometimes people will swap out of air and some guys could suck in air. Yeah, they could actually suck it. Like will the party, it's kind of a trick, a parlor trick in not a real thing. So it's like inserting air. Well, let's be fair. What is it you actually want from this guy? I mean, does it really matter how it got to that point? Does that violate your sensibilities, your delicate sensibilities? The Geneva Convention on Fart has to be pure bacterial Beth production. We'll have no above air for below. The judges will rule for me.

Speaker 4:          01:38:05       I want him to eat that. Rbs. Yeah, but if it's swallowing air as part of it, his gas production, some people the air goes through. And why not give them that if he has that talent? I mean, I, I understand. Like I'm just saying, the judges say, I feel like they couldn't be the judge. I feel like the committee would want to review this. I feel took worthy of worthy of a throwing the flag I want. I want to official review. Yeah. I have another very scientific, oh my God. I don't know if I could take anymore, I'm sorry. My mother used to tell me she used to, I used to Fart a lot and when sometimes I'd complain about the farts. She would say that you should be grateful for the farts farts. Push the shutouts. Now is that true? That puts the farts out as far as and shit or a center sort of disconnected phenomena.

Speaker 4:          01:38:53       Yeah. There's sort of, this can be a little connected, but they're obviously, there's some connection there, but they, they're independent. They're not just still push the farts out. They eat a shit. We'll a fart. We'll come out with the shit, but this shit is dope. Yeah. And the, she said the FARC push the shit right. And it's a little different and the farts just come out. They just forget. There's no causal relationship. Not really. I mean, it may give you more of a sense of a desire to depart, studying and being, did I ever think I'd be on this show? Any show talking about this and you never, I not, that's not something I expected. If he's talking about, I thought we, I thought your wife was really smart and I thought we'd talk about Kierkegaard, Kierkegaard, Thomas Aquinas, Kierkegaard on top of it. Well, I took a leap of faith by coming on this show and I'm here to work here.

Speaker 4:          01:39:51       I was wrong because it has done so much work out there. It's for, is required to get here. But, uh, I think, uh, Heidegger was a little close to the proper analysis of the extensional phonology round. You're the best man. Thanks for coming on. Thank you for letting us torture you with these plants. Are we really done? I have a weird sort of like desire to continue. Oh, I'll get the weird like weird, like I feel attached to all this. I've traumatized traumatic attachment, trauma bonding. You're going to associate beards with this for a long time and it's stalking behavior and I'm not going to know when to leave or go. Give me one more. Give you one more. Okay. Gimme a gimme a high grade? No, no. Violent medical injury stuff that I'm to be thinking about the surgical suites without the dad excitement.

Speaker 4:          01:40:43       The trans. What about one of your other guests? Have extra, had extraordinary reactions to extraordinary high level reactions to two guests that should be able to take it. Is this thing, I don't know. Is this one of them? Hold on. I want one. They did eventually meet Ken who shares her sexual preference. Oh, not this Belgian until I was 29 years old. That was to follow him. No, no. Zolal file. Yeah, I know. Shit. I'm doing it on the fly. But then bomber. What about the, what about the transition? Savannah Trans Canada highway? No, that's not weird enough. No. You know, my radio partner and Mike Catherwood sends me where it's stuff all the time. He goes on the dark web and he's very fascinated with a dire people that diarrhea on each other. I, I buy, I need to connect Taran breakup clearly. Uh, they diarrhea on each other.

Speaker 4:          01:41:43       It's a sexual thing. You can't really do it on each other. Only one person gets to be the receiver. Oh, I got to go. Well for you, I've got to go look for you to see it. It's really awful. The vomit every time and he finds great gleer delight. People have a strong reaction to this. Ah, here we go. Tom, your moms and your, my son and I if falling in love with him. Oh, he said, are you really? I said, yes, I am. He's thinking, you know what? I was scared to let you know too. I am too. We're both consenting adults. If, if it comes down the way, operate it, it's just like it is a whole phenomenon and everything. Everything's fine and a way. There's a woman I ended up in interviewing several times who was in recovery from this. And so she can talk about what the delusion is like when you're in it and how people get into that and how they get out of it.

Speaker 4:          01:42:32       So you're saying because of the separation, the, the bond was, it's distorted. Yeah. It gets all fucked up. So He'd be, how do you develop a, a romantic, you don't see them as a maternal figure. It's just a way. It's just all you get sexualized inappropriately and stuff. So should you be able to marry your mom? Know, cause, cause whenever, but everyone's just like the gays though. What, what? That's what that guy says. You saw that. But he goes, it's just like the gays. What are you shooting? Yeah. Yeah. It's like if we're both adults [inaudible] and producing kids that close, you can do that. But uh, I, you know, I have a question about government overreach too. We should get involved with that at all. Yeah, no, I heard in a college that you can have sex with your eyes forward. No, not accurate. This is University of San Francisco.

Speaker 4:          01:43:22       Okay. A lesser school. Yeah. And I, I, I was told that you can have offspring with your cousin that you won't have a, you can with your siblings are and with your mom. But it, but the risk of trouble is they're really hot. The lessor lessor because as you get further and further away, it's less, our cousins is not that big a risk. Right. Like royalty used to marry the Egyptian royalty. You were married their kids. Oh yeah. That's pretty good. Brothers and sisters and things they did. Horrible, horrible, nasty. Hell. That's a very bizarro

Speaker 5:          01:43:54       the kilometer marker. 7,128 and this is where I believe with a 90%, uh, no mic, that 95% chance that this is in fact the very place where that Trans Canada paid dates. Last section. Oh yeah. Right here. Yeah, that's me. That's me

Speaker 4:          01:44:33       there. And he's based, he's really good. He Really,

She's got later for them. What do you think she looks like drew? Like just on the voice. Hmm. Granny from Beverly hillbillies. That's pretty accurate. What does she actually look like? A granny from nailed it.

Speaker 4:          01:46:23       Did we get to see her? She blows them all later in a different video or a floor guy. Yeah, that's great. No, no Tom, no, this, she really look like the granted, you know, we never say no. No, no, she does. Cheryl Tiegs she doesn't no, no, no. She looks, she looks like she's a mass bill. Yeah. Like she has most of all time. Jesus. All right, I'm ready to go. Alright. Okay. I'm dying over here. Is done. Tapped out, tapped out. This has been awesome. Thanks. I wish I had, I wish I had had a clip to play. They would top everything I was trying to, you know, get me a winter. It tells this video. I'm actually pretty amazed at how not phased you are by all of this. I mean, you have seen it all.

Speaker 2:          01:47:06       I have seen it all. Trust me, I eat mostly what I, when I see Albert behavior, I'm either sort of Zig Wadley, you know, sort of, uh, intrigued or I feel sad. Those are the two feelings I get are like, like really? People do that and then I get sad

Speaker 4:          01:47:24       cause I know how fucked up that you're sad it, but you're also empathetic. Think we should go on strike against, come uh, come stripe, keep going. I'm only going to swallow the calm of a man or put on my by the come of a man who's willing to touch it or kiss me afterward. She just felt like she's good for her and she plays a little Chopin and Beethoven. Oh yeah. Yeah. That we'll attach this calm. I won't either bolts that. She's my favorite. She's probably still was piano teachers. So it's a, it's extraordinary stuff people put on line is that, that's our whole, that's our whole show. But I mean the stuff, the stuff they send you, I'm impressed. I got to get Kathy when in your, in your my radio partner in, in, in your world. Let's do it. Cause he goes on the dark web and he's a genius at finding horrible stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:48:21       Oh, please hook us up. Please look us up. Okay. Yeah. I have to just constantly erases his texts. Just fucking, let's do a group text. One last thing, just as a societal question. You're a smart guy and you seem to analyze stuff and where it's all going. I do feel like this lack of shame that we're now experiencing in our culture, like people posting, come strike videos, et cetera. There used to be an element of like, hey, this is private versus public. Oh, that's all gone. Right. What are the consequences of that psychologically as I, uh, society,

Speaker 2:          01:48:56       I, I'm less worried about the, the mechanism of this manifesting as much as it is that people are running at it and using it all the time. In other words, they have no personal boundaries. So this is the perfect place for them to be boundless. It's not the technology's fault. That's an internal phone. I didn't know what you guys are putting on line, but I'm going to be looking, I'm imagining it's not going to be this kind of stuff. Yeah. Hoping Tom Left. No. Okay. Uh, and so it, it's, you know, we live in a time with people who have been abused. Their body boundaries have been violated. They have no personal boundaries. They've come from no fan, unstructured family systems. And you know, that's, this is it. And shame is shame is the sort of, either they're, they're overcome by shame or they're totally avoidant of shame.

Speaker 2:          01:49:45       Those are sort of the two versions we have today. And avoidant shame avoidance are narcissists assess exactly shame of, Oh yeah, there's this refuse to feel ashamed of anything. Yeah. There's a real famous guy right now when you get to see him every day. No, but you know, really was like, that was Clinton. Oh yeah. He was very slippery with shame. Right. And we're just be, you know, be these horrible, shameful things. It just depends what it is in super narcissists, Uber narcissist and that I'm surprised that has not come crashing down more. Yeah. So that's like, there's a push for it. More like it's coming now. It's, it's, it's starting to comment and it's been the, I always thought that was the most extraordinary exploitation of an underlying, you know, just extraordinary in a, in a place of business. Can you imagine that the person in the highest level of authority take advantage of the person at the lowest level?

Speaker 2:          01:50:41       Hmm. Yeah. That guy would, that CEO would go to jail, right? Not only be in a civil problem and if his wife came out and then tried to abuse the intern, she'd be in trouble too. It's like, yes, I get it. It's just not okay. But I guess, yeah, because like we said at the beginning to be a president, you can't be all that healthy. Yeah, for sure. Oh, it's for the record. Drew thought that the car crusher video was funny, so that's just something off the record. I muted both of your mics, muted both of your mics. Yes, he did. Yes, he did. This is Tom signing off. You said it was funny. I said there's a funny Pete. Part of it is stuff I that for the three stooges to be very funny, if it were in the context of fiction, a lot of people have sat there and said it was funny.

Speaker 2:          01:51:25       By the way, I understand why. I understand why, but I know the reality is people are psychotic, right? No, no, no, no. I could see why somebody would say, that's funny. Let's put it this way. First of all, they were not female. They were all male, which for sure, right? Maybe we should. We find violence funny women. It's all w you know, three stooges humor, because they're dumber. Why is the defining line between men and women is three students. Humor stupid. Why women just looks at it. It's cause it's stupid because we create life and you guys destroy it. When you're a mother and you make life. The thought is is pretty much we don't kill. We just destroy her name or different name. Yeah, it's my child. I think we'll wait to, your son gets older. Oh God. Oh my God. You'll see it. You will see it. The destructive nature. Oh wait, your kid turns 40 I can't wait. I want to be here to do a podcast with you. You'll think it's great coming back to come back. Yeah, let's schedule it. Let's schedule it. All right. All right. All right. Thank you so much. I'll talk to you later. Thank you.
