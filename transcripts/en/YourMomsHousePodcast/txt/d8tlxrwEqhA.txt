Because this mirrors are real life. Yesterday on the way home from my dinner, it was pretty bad. Walk me through what happened. This is a liquid ass pranked by the way. You know it's that spray. Oh yeah. We've had, we've people have said to us that one. Yeah. It's not nearly as volatile as what you've got in your real ass. Well, yesterday was an interesting day because it was a travel day. I'll always a recipe, cross country travel day, just bad things happen. Sure. I'm at the hotel early, eating some breakfast, having caught, did you have for breakfast? I had a mom lit okay. With veggies. Uh, yeah. There was spinach, onions, mushrooms, and you don't eat those very often.

Speaker 4:          00:05:23       It's very volatile. It's not true. I ate that, uh, had some bacon. Coffee. Oh yeah. Then you were up early, early, too early. Just does something to your guts. I know what it is. I know. And then I shit at the hotel. Then I drive more than an hour. Get to the airport. You have another like half coffee, another coffee and I just started now. I just started, honestly I get, I got on the plane with it. I gave it to the flight attendant. Right. Can you just throw, someone's going to say, because usually I drink my morning coffee and then I, shit, I don't really want coffee right away. I was like, I don't really enjoy this and I slept for a few hours. I don't know. But your whole, your whole digestive track is messed up that day. Yeah, it really is waking up super early. If it would mess my stomach up to her and my stomach would just hurt.

Speaker 4:          00:06:15       And then I got back here eight something here, I don't know. Then we went out. What do we have for dinner? Oh yeah, I had that um, salmon, salmon, salmon, the hardest. I had the salmon and then, um, yeah, on the way out of there, just, you know what's fun is because we say Saulman as a joke and that when we're out in public, so many people say Saulman with a hard l and that it's not right. Including the server. It's a correct. Yeah. Look, do you want to Solomon? And I go, I do. And I go, can you make it medium rare? He's like, they don't make take temperature. Change it for the Salomon here. It was like that. And I hear library a lot too. And there's a lot there. Sometimes it get tweeted you directions for things. So we sit like it will be like intentionally to, to really say pacifically.

Speaker 4:          00:07:02       Yes, it's jokes. So, so wait a minute. So we, I remember this, we had is we had our Saulman I had some seafoods too. And then on the drive home. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. So I farted. Well it's not just a fart. It was like an atomic. Yeah, that's what I'm saying though. And you had your head out the window. You're like my husband, he farted. First of all, here's the shit thing you do is you don't give me any heads up. There's no warning, and then you don't cross ventilate, which everybody knows. If you're going to fart in the car, all the windows have to be down, passenger and driver. You got to cross ventilate that fucking thing. It was hot. It was hot. It was hot and it smelled like a dirty diaper. Like it smells like our newborns farts. I got to give it to me, give it up.

Speaker 4:          00:07:48       To me it was real nasty. What did it feel like coming out? Was it hot? Yeah. Yeah. No, I knew it was as it came out. I was like, this, I told you I'll go, this is going to be bad. Oh, I know. And I was saying that before I smelled it too. I just knew by the feeling. I was like, oof what you're telling me. Did you tell us on this show? Some guy you, you saw him dancing with headphones on and then he farted. Did you say this on the show? Said it was so funny. I'll never forget that. That was in DC. It was on a lunch break. I was working with another guy named Tom and he was really into music. We went to a record store and it was back when the record stores, they had the listening station and the guy was like, he just ripped a huge fart and we fell out turn.

Speaker 4:          00:08:34       It was like, I think he really thought we were laughing at his voice. Well you didn't because you think people can hear what you're, what you're doing. And he was a big guy. Yeah. And I think that that fart escaped without him. You wait a minute, Tom, this is a bit Eh, sizes to view. Are you saying that fat people have girthy or or smelling your farts? Cause I don't know why a smelly or but maybe girthy or in media or maybe you think the fatness is directly proportionate. Maybe has a, it's a factor. Maybe. Maybe they're eating more garbage, but your mom's got monstrous forest. That's a good point. He's like 80 pounds. Great counterpoint. Yeah, the 40 as far as I've ever heard. Right. And smelly. Very slowly. This is a question for science. We have to ask a doctor. Yeah. Yeah. It always real here late. Let's, let's examine this dad's reaction a little more to this, uh, smell in his car. Sure.

Speaker 2:          00:09:28       What God did you shoot it so it's not all farm? Just like fucking dumb shit. They were us yesterday. I am expelling here. Yeah. All right Kate, how far looking? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:09:55       I feel like these words come out of my mouth every week of my life with you. That can't be a 5,005. I've said this exact thing over and over.

Speaker 2:          00:10:04       What is that? Since we've been together. Now you're just going to help and then he eats his ramen or whatever the fuck.

Speaker 4:          00:10:18       Great spray in there. I was there ice cream in there. He's not eating top ramen. I don't think that's wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:10:26       Oh, smell anymore. Well, God know I love this guy. Oh God. These guys believe that came out of here. Now I'm nervous now. Somebody somehow like that.

Speaker 4:          00:10:43       That's like every married couples discussion. I mean that is, that's ultimate dad too. That's a real dad. You know, his dad is, the dad should fart. Well. Yeah, but I mean that's a bad reaction. I remember as a kid, we would take these road trips, especially my uncle Dave, he'd be like, oh, he's like Jesus Christ. What do you piss pots? Just because this spots and Ding dongs Jesus go to the bathroom. Christ stinks. You guys stink. Do you rip a Fart? You always said that. Cut apart. Cut. You cut a foreign ramp. A fighter. My favorites. Yeah. Cutting a fart. That's social foreigner thing. Oh my God. Yeah. Um, here's another dad here.

Speaker 5:          00:11:25       Take it to the east coast. Hello son. Hello Butch. You're gonna fuck up your stinking dirty. Pasty. Yeah. Yup. I'm a big smelly fucking Turd, which didn't, can do get it busted.

Speaker 4:          00:11:41       So I'm going to talk to our children to see exactly how can fantastic talking to her.

Speaker 5:          00:11:47       That's sick. That drill. I'm not getting that. No one looked at under a place. You the top. Oh Man. No, I'm not. Fuck No, I'm not getting in there. You big dirty corn. It's good though. As he fuck gone. It doesn't

Speaker 4:          00:12:02       see. First of all, this is way better way to communicate with someone or your children devil. Yeah. The way that he calls his kid a dirty, rotten ginger headed con. Yes. I mean, I just love that so much. He rarely find American parents like that. No, I know this is a foreigner thing. My parents used to curse at me all the time. I love it all the time. I immediately smile when I see somebody to talk to their kid like that. This is more normal to me then you know, oh sweet. I actually feel like that means you like your kid even more. Yeah, I agree. I don't like that. I agree. You don't think of them as an experiment that you're raising? No. Like if I would farm, my dad would be like, oh, so, oh real hardcore. [inaudible] like you've rotten whore mother kind of and like, yeah, I think I was normal.

Speaker 4:          00:12:50       Why that never got mad. You know? My Dad, he was always like, he's just, he's like, Jeez, wow. It's like you do that. That really stinks because you probably need to take a ship away because your dad doesn't like lay blame. He's so sweet. He loves it. He loves the game and loves shits. He does. So as soon as you are like you've rip one, he's just like, wow, that's really something. Now you saw it ever gets mad. You saw him in breast, a breast balls, beach. He saw him. I saw a top dog and Charo and any updates? Um, no. I mean it's pretty much same shit. Different toilet, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Did he tell you any poop stories or anything? No, not really. Okay. So it's consistent or good? Yeah. Uh, oh, I have a hemorrhoids update. Oh, we're not done with this though. I'm sorry. I didn't know.

Speaker 5:          00:13:39       All right Jordan. I'll save it. Oh, come on man. There's no throwing him on. There's no

Speaker 4:          00:13:48       up God. It sounded like it was Gunna, no, he's just grossed out by his sons. Fart

Speaker 5:          00:13:55       dirty Boston children.

Speaker 4:          00:14:04       I love this guy so much. That's it. That's it. Sorry you have a hemorrhoid up to, I didn't mean to.

Speaker 5:          00:14:13       It's a little late on this queue, isn't it? We've been talking about shit for the first 10 minutes of the show. Well I just want to say it [inaudible] Huh?

Speaker 4:          00:14:25       Or late than never. That's right. So anyways, I at first of all, thank you for the outpouring of emails and concern about my hemorrhoids. I really appreciate all the thoughtful advice. It is really nice guys. Yeah. So, uh, many of you recommended a Tux medicated pads. Um, I got a recommendation for this Chinese cream you can buy on Amazon to that's coming and if high fiber or things of that nature, but, which I tell you I already have pretty fiber's good dumps. Um, and I started using talks. What I would do is I like if I knew I was kind of sitting around for a minute, like to breastfeed the kid or something, I'd take 'em a tox pad and kind of fold it like a Taco and then just put it up against my hemorrhoids. Like just kinda like a, like a pad and have it soak on my hemorrhoid. You know what I mean? Like just sitting there. Good News. It's already worked on going to dry heave. There's no more pain. It's the pain has gone and, and that must be the power of Tux. So thank you. Thank you. It's gone. I mean it's not, the bump is still there, but there's no pain. If that makes sense. Is that how that's supposed to resolve?

Speaker 1:          00:15:32       I guess so. Like does a bump go away or it's just, I don't know. I've just done an expert. Yes. You are in hemorrhoids. No, I'm not. You have them. Don't you have, I mean I've seen blood before, but that's not it. Those are internal ones, right? Yeah. But I don't have a your issue, the external ones. No. Ari has the internal ones. Ari's issues are vast. Yeah. And series should have asked him. I can't believe he's alive after seeing what his asshole looks like is so horrific. Everyone's seen his butt hole. I almost passed out when I saw it at the fire. I swear. I've never though. It's like, oh, you so nasty. It's so nasty. He's so nasty. Um, poor guy. He really has serious ain't home problems. Real serious problems. I did also want to point out, um, I'm doing a Conan tonight.

Speaker 1:          00:16:27       Come, so that'll be up by the time you hear it or listen to this. Yeah, that's it. I've been there a few times. It's always fun to go back. Burt was there last night. Who, uh, Bart. Yeah. And uh, I didn't get to see it, but, uh, that was sent, uh, just a small clip from his appearance if you guys want to listen to what he did on the show niggers. Oh, all right. Well, you know, we each have our own different way of performing. I wonder if Conan and brought him out as the world's fattest, most racist comedian working today. Good thing to look up. Yeah. That's really caught fire and I'm pretty happy about that. Well, obviously, I mean, he is. Yeah. Was that, that was his opener, right? He sat down, I guess. And you just did that. Yeah. Conan was like, oh, okay. Hey Conan's not racist. No, no, neither is Andy. I wonder how they dealt with it. Yeah, no. Um, interesting. So I think these are the same guys, by the way. That made that, um, my dad, he never made us ashamed of a heart penises. Christ. Yeah, that was terrible. Another clip. You want to see it now? Here it is. Oh, thanks.

And Gay guys don't care about that. Oh really?

Speaker 4:          00:20:25       Wow. They just fuck out in the streets. When I lived in San Diego, I'd see guys to see this fucking, this is in the height of like the 90s though. Wouldn't when, you know gay guys ruled that place. I don't know if they still do. Now it's more yuppies. But I'm telling you, one time I saw two guys just butt fucking on the street. Uh, clubs everywhere guys. So fucking quit putting their dicks through holes and other guys just going to suck. I'm their savages, dude. They're awesome. They used to rule it. It was like awesome. Well this gay Mecca, like if he were a gay guy, you should, you should live in San Francisco. You want to make, it makes me crazy. When gay people write to me and they're like, I live in fucking Alabama and they hate, they hate me because I'm gay. I'll get the fuck out of there. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:21:05       Not just the gays who are doing the butt stuff. Do you want to know something that's really amazing. Oh, what? A couple who were desperately try and I can see they'd been having sex the wrong way for four years. No kidding. Yes. 26 and 24 years old. Oh my God. They were like, we keep failing to get pregnant. The sex on a regular basis. During the appointment, the woman admitted that sex was usually painful and uh, they were very young, very healthy, hilarious, couldn't conceive. They were having a lot of stress. And uh, the doctor discovered that the couple had mistakenly been having anal intercourse rather than vaginal conceive four years of marriage. And either the husband or wife knew how to get pregnant.

Speaker 4:          00:21:56       Goodness. Porns banned in China. Right? I Dunno. Maybe. Probably the state controls, you know. Yeah. I mean, these people aren't being educated. I doubt they teach them about the birds and the bees.

Speaker 1:          00:22:11       That's wild. That is wild.

Speaker 4:          00:22:13       Oh yeah. It says sex education faces great challenges in China. Djing. John, a professor of sociology at Beijing's, I don't know how to say the Tsing Hua. I'm fluent in Chinese university at Tang. Ha. Students take sex education to you? Not even going to comment on me on my beautiful pronunciations. St Claw. Yeah. Take sex education classes where they learn basic melanose any condoms. Okay. Anyway.

Speaker 1:          00:22:39       Huh? Wow.

Speaker 4:          00:22:41       Good stuff. Bad stuff for, for for how many years? That's terrible. But now that that is, I mean this has to be a stupid couple. I mean, why would you put it in? That's where the chocolate comes out.

Speaker 1:          00:22:58       It's pretty, pretty. Uh, pretty wild.

Speaker 4:          00:23:01       Oh, is it time? Hold on one second. I might have 18 seconds and my timer, go ahead. Let them know. Ching Chong, Ching Chong. Where's that one? No, you want to fuck with my main memory that I remember. Just singing what? I know. I'm just singing what I know from this show. I'm not making fun of Asian people. That's an actual drop. Okay. There you go. Alright. Okay. There you go. So there she is. So I dug it up. [inaudible] I was referencing a song and you know, come on guys. It was

Speaker 1:          00:23:41       a really back in the news heavily. These last four hours. Is

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       that one? Louis Ck. Great. He did too. That was an actual audio recording of the incidents. Right, right. But he did two appearances, this, uh, this weekend, one at the comedy cellar, a famed New York City Comedy Club. And one I think out in governors in Long Island at the comedy club. And uh, both were surprised sets and these are both a new, these are his first appearances doing standup since he admitted to, um, jerking off in front of people without their consent. Yes. And, uh, that was a huge bomb drop. Yes. Uh, it was a huge bomb that dropped last November and everybody, you know, at least in comedy, has been like, ah, will he come back? Like, just jump the gun, just what will happen again. And He, uh, he's doing spots. It looks like, you know what's interesting is that huge backlash, by the way, people aren't exactly applauding this return.

Speaker 4:          00:24:54       Most people are not. And it's interesting because we've had conversations with other people in our business. Like what's the timeline here? Right. How long do you think he's gonna hold out before he comes back and it's been nine months. Yeah. I have to tell you like I didn't hate him before this. I was kind of like them on the scale of shitty things that have happened. He's not a Weinstein. He's not exactly a Cosby. He sucks. That sucks. But it was not on the scale of Shit. Shit Bird. Yeah. This makes me not like him cause you're like motherfucker, if you don't know to stay the fuck away for at least a year, you don't got no sense. He has no sense. And talk about the sense of entitlement. Like dude, you're clueless. Like if you're coming back this early, that's just my take. Wait at least a year. Don't you think?

Speaker 4:          00:25:43       Uh, you know it's funny, I didn't really think of the specifics of it because it's not my life. You know what you mean? The specifics like how to come back like was, I didn't like lay out a plan because I'm not anything that I deal with. Not your concern in life. Yeah. So I mean I was always of the mindset that I believed that a path to redemption should exist, not just for him. I mean, just for most people in, in life, like people who do bad things like Cosby though. Well, okay, how has it really bad? My point was that is that, you know, somebody gets arrested, let's say goes to jail for any number of terrible things. You could be accused of assault, armed robbery, murder, manslaughter, all these horrible things. Eventually some of those people get released and it's like, you can't just be like, that's it. Like you don't get to, well, you're back in society now. You have to figure out ways. So for, for a lot

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       of people, they go, you know, let's say somebody is accused of a horrific violent thing. They're locked up for 20 some years. They go, well, they did, they paid their debt to society. So they're entitled to whatever now, even though people don't have to hire them. Right. You know, so this is obviously not the same thing, but there is some parallel to, um, there's a bad thing done. You need to pay some type of price. There's pennants and yeah. So the, you can make an argument that, you know, part of the penance is the public shame of it all. Yeah. Part of the pennants is losing, you know, your, he had big television deal with FX that went away. Touring business just stopped. Obviously there's monetary monetary punishments. Sure. Then you have to go, well, um, if he did, you know, he did admit to doing these things. Like the probably, I mean there's, again, this is just an opinion needs to be some type of interaction with the um, people that you or you know, uh, let them dictate some terms of making it okay. In other words, some woman that he jerked off in front of gets to say, you know, it'd be great if, uh, yeah, if you were to donate to this organization or, I dunno, I don't have the answer, but I'm saying you need to at least consider probably some of those peoples, um, feelings in this.

Speaker 4:          00:28:17       Well, I think what you're saying, which is I agree with too, is like the way the law functions, right? Like there's no real due process with what's happening. People are being accused and then it's like you're gone off with your head disappear. Whereas there's no like legal system being involved. Yeah. Um, if we could have, I wish gotten legal system, maybe there's a way to get, if the legal system had been involved, it's a much clear cut because path, right. Because the whole point is to make somebody whole again, that's the whole point of the legal system. And it was also like a direct punishment. So you go, right, you're going to jail, you're paying a function. Pennants dependents. Yeah. And I, and I think that might be the, the biggest flaw of the me too movement is just like, okay, I get it. Like we're not victim blaming. If a girl says I should happen. Yeah. Okay. It happens. So let's get it. What are the next steps? Let's be very clear and specific about punishment and, and, yeah. And we weren't, and that's why this shit is not fucking working now and now he's back. I think he should,

Speaker 1:          00:29:15       um, you know, you, you can't stop someone from doing whatever. I mean, no, he, you know, seems like illegal. Seems like he's, I dunno, it seems like he's going to keep doing spots. I imagine what I think is crazy actually. Is that so crazy? I do think it's crazy that the clubs, um, let surprise droppings

Speaker 4:          00:29:39       the [inaudible] case. Somebody should have been the gatekeeper here and been like, oh no, it's not cool to have a polarizing person. Surprise. Poppin right. Because there must be, yeah. Cause then you're basically saying that people who are in the audience who's night might be ruined by it. You're like, so it's like, dude, let them let the person, I'm all for the market dictating what, what's okay and not sure. So if you go, Louise, on this show tonight, you're allowing audience people to go, okay, I support the venue and the comic. I'm spending my money. Um, go ahead. Right. Let me show me what's what. Right. Let the consumer decide whether or not there, because you're not really letting that happen. And I know some people were like, yeah, but they can get up and leave. It's like, yeah, but no, they don't want to get up and leave.

Speaker 4:          00:30:33       Let them figure out whether or not that's the place they want to be. To watch that. It's so funny because we were talking about this yesterday, even before this happened. So fine. Why don't we just talking about Louis before this story broke like yesterday at dinner and uh, and we were like, you know, at the end of the day, a lot of people don't give a shit what people do in their private lives. What's that director who lives in France and he was fucking left Polanski. Hollywood's still gives that guy, you know, the, the high five on his work. I made a documentary about how great he was. Yeah. A couple of years ago called wanted and desired and I watched it and everyone in Hollywood was before me too. Stuff took off. Everyone was there. Like, he's a great, amazing men. Like you fuck a 13 year old girl, the hot tub. Like nobody fucking cares.

Speaker 4:          00:31:19       Yeah. People were like, he wanted Oscar. He wanted an Oscar. Years later, a few Oscars. Woody Allen's been shipping his stepdaughter for what, 20 years now. People are like, oh, talents. And now they're like, no, no, no, he's no good anymore. But it took all the other stuff. But no one should be marrying his fucking adopted. I mean, look and, but the point being that yes, there's more awareness draw bought, brought to it, but people still can separate. There's still came from the art. I mean, and look, he's going to have a massive audience. Of course people still want to see him do stands. He's so silly to go out this early though. I just don't think it's, it's not, it's clue. Can I tell you what it is? It really shows to me an arrogance and an obliviousness to the gravity of this movement and the gravity of what he's done.

Speaker 4:          00:32:04       It to me reads very callous and like my younger chefs going to do what I want to do and you know, it's interesting his approach to it of like, I'm just going to show up and do this and he doesn't bring it up on stage. He's like, Oh, is this okay? Very similar to what he was doing to women. Right? Like, I'm going to jerk off. I hope this is okay with you guys. Like it's the same fucking approach of like is there's, okay, I'll a too late. I'm already doing it. Like there was no, there's no consent in both of those scenarios. Right. Him showing up, doing a pop in and then him taking his deck out and asking if it's okay and he's already come. You know, it would have been amazing if he did his like top in 15 minutes set and then the host comes back out, you know, take the money and just start streaming. Hey man, good side. And then Louise like, oh come on man. And he was like, oh no, I'm a big fan. Yeah, that'd be fantastic. Everybody knows, hey standing ovation. There was no clapping.

Speaker 4:          00:33:01       Everybody give him around a jerk off. Yeah, he didn't bring it up. He didn't even bring it up. I heard in the set. I Dunno. I Dunno. I heard that he didn't, I heard it was like the usual stuff like waitresses, donuts, whatever, the subways. Terrible. Wait a minute, are you not going to fucking address? That's the thing is it's kind of, there is a, I'm fascinated by what the step must be like what the hour will look like. No. Cause who's buying that one? That is are not Netflix. No Netflix. But he's going to, I may probably the best business solution for him 100% would be to like do his old model, put it on his site and whoever's on board is on board. He'll still sell a ton of them. I mean saying for him that works and that leaves it to, you're not surprising, uh, any body with it.

Speaker 4:          00:33:57       It's just here's content. Do you want to pay for it? Yeah, I dunno. I want to see too, it's like, do you open talking about it? I would get the elephant, like to not address it. Here's the other thing is like as a comedian, do you want a somber apology at the beginning of, uh, I mean, no. You know, it's like, no, but don't, you can't go up there and not address it. You would be like, so anything happened in the news lately and he just starts jerking off. Do you think he should do like that? Um, the drop curtain where they show the silhouette and then he just turns and starts going like that and he's like, what's up guys? It's me again. He's back. Well there's the trailer, it's, it's a silhouette of him jerking off and it's like your favorite jerk off comedian.

Speaker 4:          00:34:45       He's bad. It was called. Do you mind just kind of gesturing like, do you mind if I come? Yeah, I have to say I was more partial time if I come might, if I come, oh, I'll make you come. I'm sure you will. For stroke comedian. Yeah. I have to say that I was more on his side kind of on this thing and now I'm more like, oh, this guys doesn't get it. The fact that he, he thinks he's welcome back. It's like he doesn't get the gravity he doesn't get, that's the opening sentence right now. I'll make me come.

Speaker 4:          00:35:30       That's the next hour I can make me make me come. Jesus. Yeah. I mean by that. Here's, okay, here's what somebody else's thinking. Because like I said, I didn't lay out a plan for him so I wouldn't know. But it's like you go, you go, this is, you shouldn't have done your spots now. Okay. When is he supposed to go do spots at least. But that's a few more months. So what at least waiting for the holidays for some other Creepo to come out. One other big fish, one other big fucking creeper that Asia Argento story's pretty great. I kind of, you know what, maybe that's what did it, cause that kind of minimize the movement a bit is having that thing with Asia and she was paying off the guy who accused her of sexual assault teenager who was a teenager if for those of you don't know what happened. And so Asia Argento was one, it's like one of the leading people and Rose McGowan.

Speaker 4:          00:36:27       Right. But I'm saying so we're talking about Asia buddies. Yeah. But they just been like, one of the faces of this, she was also was dating Anthony Bordain and it turns out that she was accused by a guy who had just turned 17. So a kid who was 16, like the week before, uh, so nasty. She fucked him. And she's like, I didn't know he was a teen or something. She was 37. He was 17. He, uh, came after her and he can't enforce drugs for sure. The story at least, you know, what is being reported by some people is that she then had bore Danes, lawyers and um, money to pay him off. Right. So that more Dane actually paid it came out of board Danes pocket 380,000. But who knows? I don't know. The, I don't know who knows what the fuck is really happening there.

Speaker 4:          00:37:21       But I do think that that deal legitimize the movement a bit. Having one of the people, like one of the big people is full of shit accusing Weinstein. Yeah. Right. Which started this whole thing, which by the way doesn't mean that why it seem, didn't do that. I'm sure he did, but I'm saying it, it definitely lends itself to de-legitimizing a lot of this movement. So maybe that's why Louie felt a little entitled. I don't know. I'm just speculating. I don't know. But it seems an odd choice. Um, why now? Why not? I, if I were him, I would stay underground a little bit longer. Yeah. I think, I think seeing it happen and um, the reaction was not positive from what I could see, at least online. Everybody was like pretty heated about it. Um, I mean from, from people in comedy now, nobody was like, it seems really tactless and clueless. And honestly, like Cosby touring right after his accusers, it's a little, that was super checked out. So, yeah. So it's on that scale. You're right. I didn't, I didn't think about it. You know what people ask me, they're like, you a Rachel one mother passed. He was like, I'll be at the club tonight.

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       Yeah, yeah. Walking out of court, being like, bye. And then he did, he did after he was convicted, he was like, aw, yeah. Aw, yeah, that's, yeah, but that's what I'm, is this so far, craziest thing that's like level 10 being like, it's fine. I can just go out there and tell jokes like I always have and I'm not going to address it. I'm just going to, it was on nine months ago. Big Deal. Like, dude, I dunno it, it definitely reads is like I'm oblivious to the reality of the situation and you're right, there's no pennants, there's no closure for the women, and he did put out a press release. It was kind of bullshitty going back and forth on this. They're like, what if you're him? You're like, what is the game plan is supposed to be? I mean, you know, I'm serious.

Speaker 4:          00:39:28       Like I mean, so it's like I get that we get to say like, no dude, this is not the good time. Another good strategy. But a lot of people don't know what the strategy is. That's the whole point. You know what the strategy is? I'll tell you what it is. It's what that director did who fuck the 13 year old, you moved to France. That's what he should do. He would be accepted and pull that one too. You go to France, go to France because they don't give a fuck about kid fuckers and master baiters and and uh, you know rapists. You say funny. How'd you say come guy in Mexico. He comes how you joking? Joking. You come, they invented front.

Speaker 4:          00:40:20       They don't give a fuck. So you moved to France for two years. That's your penance. You leave the country, you, you disappear. You just have to disappear. And that means don't check on media to see what's up with your name. Like fuck off the, let the French embrace you. And then once they've embraced you and then you come back to it. This fucking that director do did. Yeah. Yeah. Leave the country, Bro. Take your fucking family and get out. Why do you want to be here? Would you want to be here when your name is being off? I had gone through what he went through. Oh my God. I feel like that has to be psychologically so devastating. Oh my God, I have to have PTSD. If you go from being so celebrated the way he was celebrated to being just destroyed. I mean, and you earned it and this thing it's out of no, not because of anything but like that going through. That's interesting point you make too. It's very traumatizing for going cause I was just thinking of Monica Lewinsky who was like one of the first people to be really publicly shamed for a sexual thing. Right. But that she wasn't very celebrated before. I'm trying to think of what that must be like. And also the, that's the second part of it. First, don't forget that he wasn't just like thought of

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       as like he's a funny comic or he's a guy, he was thought discussed and spoken of like, like a, an artists like Monet. I mean people talked about him in an almost unnatural way in the comedy world cause he was just iconic and he was just associated with being brilliant. Oh, he's like the car land, one of those timeless. Yes. Yes. So it's like if you, if you, you know, if you go from those types of conversations about you and your name every time your name is said, it's like people are like, oh, that guy's really something else. I mean, his comedy is, you were talking about your, your jokes as if you're talking about poetry, you know? Oh yeah. And then to be, just to be torn down, thoroughly torn down and discredit a couple of other perverts. Jerry Lee Lewis married his 13 year old cousin. That's true. Elvis Presley was a shipping Priscilla 15 we have a long, rich history of pedophiles, perverts and rapists who are beloved. It's true. Why the public? It doesn't fucking matter. Ooh, yeah. Oh God. Yeah. Oh, isn't that nice?

Speaker 1:          00:42:44       Women Bait. Ah, Kevin Lord, what is happening in this world? I don't know. We are in the upside down this, this last couple of years. It's just been bonkers, right? It's been nuts. Yeah. It's a great time to be a comedian now, that's for sure. Fuck, man. Yeah. But it'll be fun. It'll be interesting to see where this storyline goes. I'm fascinated and that kind of fascinated if he keeps, if this makes them go like, ah, it takes a break. No, no, let's put bets on it right now. Do you think he's that clueless and oblivious and checked out that he's going to persist? I think, does he have the self awareness to go, I better take a step back. I think he, he accepted that he was going to take his lumps when it started. Like he knew when I, whatever the, whatever, whatever time I come back, there's gonna be some backlash.

Speaker 1:          00:43:37       So it's like, just go with it. So I think it's going to persevere. I think he's, well, I think, I think he's going to go, I knew this part was going to happen. Just stay in it so that it kind of, you know what I mean? Stay the course so that the initial blow back is the worst part. And then just you keep doing it. He's going to Trump his way through it. I think so. And I think, um, it'll be interesting to see how, you know, reactions go with the clubs because you need a platform to do standup. Yes, he did. He the venue. So, um, obviously a couple of clubs just let them do those Poppins. Will the other New York clubs go through or some of them going to be like, fuck no, it's just interesting to see how it is and what I brought up. The, whether you're not you announced or surprise people with it, I think is a big, big difference. I say announce guys, I think you should give the audience and I agree with you to let, let the market dictate. That's what we're all about in this country. He let the, let

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       the market tell you whether or not it's working. But man, I don't know. I don't know if I'd be interested to see it. Only if he talks about the truth. Only if he addresses it. Am I interested in hearing about, you know, uh, the stuff he was talking about before and now all I want to know about is what's life been like for you the last nine months? It must've been fucking horrendous and there's a way to make that funny. You talk about the lows of being a pariah. Many people don't get to experience that. That's pretty fucking fascinating, right? It's true. No. We'll see. Yeah. Who's on board with him? Definitely not Hannah Gatsby. She's got a lot more to say on this. She's got her work cut out for another hour right now, but just I'm writing frantically writing. She made that. She did an interview where she said if Louie comes back, my work is not done. That's what I'm saying. She's just pan is at home writing right now. She got her a whole hour. It just written. She'd be great to be having that seat right now. Where does she live? She, she's English and Australian. Ah, we got to get her anything. She was in New York for a while. She might be in New York right now. Well that'd be great if they were on the same line. Oh my God.

Speaker 4:          00:45:45       She's like her head just exploded backstage and these came out and was like, the biggest piece of shit ever is back. I would just be here to ear smiles at that show and that's head explodes. Oh my God. She was just like, just straight up. I've got fucking cunt bag. So Matt, just shit on everybody there. Oh Man. Yeah. You know the world is changing and by the way, that is Donald Trump's um, method. Whenever some huge shit breaks, like the stormy Daniels and this last one was the Guy Colin. He's just like, I don't give a shit fake news fuckers. Let's go. Wow. That was brazen. Like don't give a fuck. I just attacks whoever he's like, like cone was his lawyer, his personal lawyer and fix her for years. And then he's, he tweeted out, if you need a lawyer, I would not hire Michael Cohen. He's terrible lawyer.

Speaker 4:          00:46:45       What are you talking? Just like he sucks whenever someone gets turned out of his thing, there are a piece of shit like I'm a row set too high or that piece of shit like you did. Hugh did Weirdo. Weirdo. Very fucking crazy. Yeah. I'm excited to see what his next move is. I am guessing more obliviousness more entitlement. That'd be more mad at me. I'm moving along. You guys ever noticed how, you know, we talked about how much we hate people that uh, speak on speakerphone in public. Yes. This, this guy wrote in, hey water champ. I found another level of, of noxious public behavior and this also makes me crazy similar to the talking on speakerphone. This guy

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       in this video attached decided to double park between two spaces. Ah, half his car into the lane and uh, so that he could do his scratch off tickets for this while he waited for his party to run into the store instead of, you know, parking like a human being. Um, can't wait to see you. Philly Burt's do specialists. Good. But he's still fat. Piss on me and beat me. I'm a hot white come hot white trash come dump right after that. What was it? He goes, I'm a hot white trash. Let's fuck. Let's fuck. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:48:06       New level of ass over here. Double Park. Two spots of his legs. Still waiting for his to go into the grocery store and a, he was just doing the scratch offs like half parked in the spot. There's still sitting there and the guy just got in the car, Bro. Yeah. Double parked in the grocery store so no one can pull through and no one can work in either one of these spots. Really even go this lame right now cause he's still like half out. Totally. Oh my God. Parking space. So

Speaker 1:          00:48:39       it's total asshole. This guy gets a bullet when he thinks oh to two to the head for sure. This, I'm somebody in front of us. His family to somebody emailed this, which is unbelievable. It says all our mommies to take the cake during my sister's burial, my grandmother answered her phone as my family was standing around the grave site crying. This was, as you could imagine, disturbing. But what really upset my family was when she loudly said, yeah, they're putting her in the ground now. Love the show. Keep up the great work. Love the Sissy of Maryland. That is so fucking funny and terrible. That should be a scene in a movie. Oh my God. Answering the phone at her. Uh, I guess granddaughters funeral. It's crazy. It'd be like, yeah, they're putting her in the ground right now. God, human beings again up, Olivia says, shit, we're doomed.

Speaker 1:          00:49:38       You know, we're, uh, we've been talking about it for the listeners. Uh, we're coming up on 10 years of a marriage. Oh, I thought you meant the show. I was like, really? Yeah. You and I have been married for 10 years almost. We've been doing the show. It's going to be nine years pretty soon. I think. That's crazy. Yeah. Um, it's amazing how we've evolved. I know this show, it was started out as far it's and mentally ill people know. Anyways, there's, you know, you're, you're always thinking like, what can I do to keep this spice ally? What can I do to keep it going? Oh boy. Um, and then you, you, you start thinking of, you know, I want to do something special for the 10 year anniversary. So good for you. So get it. It makes you happy and excited. So I found, um, what would be like a boy, I guess a seminar of type so

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       we could go to and just see if you like it, you'd have to check out. I had a feeling

Speaker 3:          00:50:33       making sound together is one of the natural ways to have intimacy. Bill 82. Right? Yeah. And there's a continuum of it where, you know, there's a really, really casual way, like the most casual way. He and I were just going lab, Nah, Eh, you know, we're just start playing

Speaker 4:          00:50:54       just like vocal. Yeah. I got intimate. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:50:57       All the way up to what Debbie does know, teaching. Really teaching a structure. Yeah. Lots and lots of schools. There's a lot of education to be had, so I totally love and local and from, because you're trusting the moment. It's whatever wants to come out right in here right now. Really, really believing that what is going to come out is going to be,

Speaker 4:          00:51:24       I'm going to file for divorce if you do this.

Speaker 3:          00:51:32       It's pretty cool. I want to go. I'd rather blow my brains. I rather watch Lisa Kate, your golf all day, every raising Rasta. Kristen. That's a cool necklace. Huh? I'm going to get to that necklace where you don't have to remember what's going to happen. No, that makes a lot. It gives me a different relationship with the future resident.

Speaker 4:          00:51:59       No, it's just really tough. I just, the world is fascinating with how many different types of people there are. I mean, dumb ones. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:07       But I also just mean, wow,

Speaker 4:          00:52:10       it's good that these people found each other as a group. I know there's that positive spin and then the, I mean, I hate them. I'm saying terrible. I just can't believe they also exist in the same world I live in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, these are the people that you pass and the trader Joe's. Yeah. It's guys at Ralph's right now. It's fucking dumb necklace. There's a way that, you know, there's a

Speaker 1:          00:52:29       chance you could start a small conversation with this guy. Like, Hey, is this that peanut butter that has the uh, yeah, natural oils. And he's like, yeah. And then he goes, uh, he would try to vocal Improv and you're like, what?

Speaker 4:          00:52:45       Like, you know, I have the group tell you about it. Yeah, no shit. I don't know. He's like, just give it a shot. No, I don't. I don't think that's for me. Oh, I think, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:52:56       Whoa, whoa.

Speaker 4:          00:53:05       This is the worst. This is worse. This is worse than scanning. Is it worse than the, I was just thinking about that. Uh, the boner that guys got handloading a little more skill. A little more like I've got a lot more skilled and he's got the most scale of the stain align guy saying that United States United States stay United. Yeah. This is, you know what, this is, I need attention. I need so much attention. I'm going to inflict this to horse shit onto another group of people. It is that who needs so much attention to what else it is. I don't have a real skill or talent, right. For music and see, but um, you'll let me feel like I do and this thing, can you sing? No. You want to act like you can say, you know it does remind me of a, used to have a bit where you talk about how toddlers tell you stories. Oh yeah, this is, this is akin to like it and you're like, nobody wants, okay, that was cute. Yeah. This is a horrible, here's the right through their plug.

Speaker 3:          00:54:16       Hey guys, you want to sing together Bob, this is kind of how you do it though. Coming to a space near you or maybe later cause I'm kinda tired.

Speaker 4:          00:54:37       They listen to each other. Do it. That's the part I don't understand. I don't know. It just reminds me of when you sign up for an Improv comedy troupe. Yes. 100% and write it. You know, usually the comics like the standups and up going like, oh tapped out. No, you can't really do this. This is real. Cringy no, I know. Cause I did like a couple of Improv and I was like, I'm out. This is not for me Bro. This is not funny. Like this doesn't feel good. No, it feels wrong. Stupid. We fill out like I'm going to be embarrassed, but I mean they all want attention individually. I'm saying like how can they have the patience to listen to everyone else's bullshit? I Dunno. Do you have to learn how to listen really listen or no,

Speaker 3:          00:55:18       you are. You can I go with that? Can I really listen? Oh Shit. You asshole. Are bringing, so we're weaving our sounds together in the moment and it's absolutely just soul satisfying. Oof. Embracing that vulnerability. There you go. It's like acting class I don't like that I don't like long ago. And then being able to do it with the others is definitely coming together. Miss of vocal in spirit, mind and body.

Speaker 4:          00:55:49       That sounds like fun. Like I like that you like his pitch. Well, I like the idea of all that, but that doesn't feel like that's going to get me there. Do you know what else would make me make my asshole? Pucker what I drum circle. Oh yeah. It's like similar. I've seen those live a few times. I've been invited to a few and I was like, no thanks. I think I know myself. I'm surprised you didn't go. It's usually Spanish guys or I was a Puerto Rican guy. That environment horse. I know my people. I know, I know he was, he's married, but the big Puerto Rican guy and he goes to other fucking married guy. Yeah. And he goes, come over on Sunday. We're doing our drum circle. You're really gonna like it. And I go, what's a drum circle? I kind of knew them in San Francisco and he's like, we all, we just get high and drunk, whatever. And you just, you just bang on the Bongo. And I go, I don't play the, this is the million years. I was 24 oh boy. Now I found out later surprise. He and his

Speaker 1:          00:56:42       wife were swingers. Yeah. So what were the drum circle would have come out at some point? Yeah. Just come over you inviting this coming through other married, spic friend. Like you're like, oh, he's Spanish and he's married. But I mean, I just talked to him on Facebook sometimes.

Speaker 4:          00:57:00       I said, good. We all went to college together. So a cage, I'm telling you once every few sky here. No, this guy's a grown man. This was an adult person and I was 24 this is the other guy. We all went to college together. I'm saying,

Speaker 1:          00:57:13       oh, every one to four years there's an update about, oh, you almost, that's being almost a lot boy. Oh. Or Gall FTT RTD artwork coming in. This one's by Jake. That's what's the carrot about. Oh, you haven't ever seen that now. Oh, there he was in like Ukraine or Bruce or something. And the president handed them a carrot and he was like, thanks to getting the carrot you never seen. That must have been like a cultural, like in Belarus, it's a symbol of fertility or something stupid. He just starts eating his carrot. It's a very popular meme. Pretty good stuff there.

Speaker 4:          00:57:56       Wait, can I, can I give you my update on the discussion we had about Forrest Gump in Gma? Yeah. I really liked this. This was a

Speaker 1:          00:58:06       Janna.

Speaker 4:          00:58:10       So a couple of episodes back, we had a discussion on whether or not it's ethical,

Speaker 1:          00:58:16       uh, to make love to a, what do they call it? Developmentally challenged person. Tom, what about them? What are they called? Developmentally challenged. I mean, what's the PC? What am I supposed to call him? Okay, so I don't, you know, I don't want to ruffle feathers by not using the right PC term. The certainly this is not a feather ruffling type of show. So I would hope that you would respect the feathers. So,

Speaker 4:          00:58:43       uh, it was whether or not it's okay too, if they're really attractive to have sexual relations with somebody, have to have diminished mental capacity and we can the conclusion that no, it was not because Forrest Gump actually is a movie. The whole premise is that Jenny has sex with forests and that's really not ethical. It's not cool. And I ended up being one of the most beloved movies, so Steph to death on Twitter, at Steph to death rites to add to the Forrest Gump slash Jenny conversation. As much as I love the film. If the gender roles, we don't like talking about gender on there, she certainly don't resent that triggered if the gender were reversed and it was a guy coming back and taking advantage of a mentally challenged girls, it would be a much different movie. True. That 100% movies, that's just a porno.

Speaker 4:          00:59:34       I also was a red one really, um, well-written assessment breakdown of the film that I don't have with me. Um, about how she was horribly traumatized, which I didn't remember. She was abused by her father. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. She's basically, you know, a broken person. Ah, yes she is. And she was traveling around as a hippie doing drugs, trying to find her way in the world, which gives you permission to have sex with yes. Developmentally disabled person and get aids. So it's all excusable. Right. It's almost a, somebody else wrote in mommy jeans while talking about Tom Starbucks experience, only mentioned one LJ little jeans that she waited in the truck with. This begs the question, did she actually give birth to a second LJ or did she really just have a huge dump? Oh, you guys think it's a conspiracy that there's no, no tiny baby around here. Want to know, hey man, these tips are feeling it. Well, we just didn't take the newborn out that day. We left the newborn, uh, in a crate, right? Tom Left it in the crate, some water and some food, and then now the did the newborn was at home. Some other FTT RTD submissions. Forget girl troubles. Rim, the dude's Ah, four GT rally truck drivers. Yeah. Fun Gun tricks. Rallies the Democrats. Finding God's teachings replaces the demons.

Speaker 4:          01:00:59       Wait, wait. Fighting guys. And finding, finding God's teachings. Teachings replaces the demons. A failing. God's teachings replenishes the devil. Fabulous golden tweens. Resist their DNA for good times. Remember to dance. Those are all of these are, and here's the thing about f, g, D, F, g, t RTD, is that it's open to interpretation. That's really the beautiful thing about it. Yeah, that's really, there's no one definition of it. It's just, it's all these things. Guys. F Gt RTB. Pretty good. Uh, good. What else are you got a, I'm sorry. I was just, those were all of those who were just mesmerized by your thoughts. Yeah, I kind of was so hard out. Oh, my back hurts when he going to give me a back massage. Hey, speaking of our 10th band a Smurf, Ernie, we do have to celebrate it. Yeah. What do you want to do? Just fart real big. Oh my God, I forgot what. Oh Man, I totally got distracted. This, uh, this guy, um, was in the news. The security guard.

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       Yeah, he got fired.

Speaker 7:          01:02:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:41       So you get the point. I love it. Yeah. It's good to hear. I heard he got fired. Um, and I'm trying to see if I can actually get them on the phone. Do you want to see if we can, I would love to speak to him because this man is the people's hero. Yeah. He was doing the Lord's work here for us. He really is. I forgot that I, um, said I would, let me press pause real quick and Tri Muggle peachy. What do you do that? Okay. I'm just gonna do this and we are back. And the clip you just saw of course, um, was from the actual footage that was recorded by and released by one, Paul Florida. The security guard, who in my opinion was unjustly fired from his job for simply singing a different way. Um, he just, you, you, you, you made funny in my opinion, just short 32nd clips of yourself at work. Yeah. Farting. Um, and did, did it start out of boredom? I mean, is that, you know, where you just like, like when you first started doing it?

Speaker 8:          01:03:51       Um, so first of all, if your video froze for me, I see that that's not, that's not a big deal though. Um, but yeah, I mean it just started off, uh, just the acoustics in the hospital lobby. Um, you know, I let one rip one day. Yeah. I didn't want to hold it in any longer. And uh, yeah, the acoustics just, you know, gave it, this is life, this volume. And so the next time it happened, um, I sent a video to my group chat and they, they loved it, you know, just some guys from home and another guy was down here and yeah, they love this raptor a couple of times. They were just like, you need to share this to the world. Yes. So after some brainstorming and stuff like that and came up with, uh, uh, Paul Flirt Moniker, you know, which was just fantastic.

Speaker 8:          01:04:32       And I'm a security guard. I got the hair cut, they got the mustache bat, you know, all the, all the key things. And so we just, you know, boom. Went with that. I started posting the videos right to the Instagram. Um, it's been about six months. Yeah. So in that, so you're doing that, are you doing pretty much videos daily? I'm guessing. I tried to do on every day. Um, I really wish that I could fart on command and just, you know, have that going for me. Or for your daily farts? Did you have a diet and it was just, no, I just, you know, I just, you know, I'm fat. I eat food. I love food, like food is my thing. I love to cook. I love to go out and eat food and all that. So I would just hope that, you know, in the amalgam of crap that I ate would produce, you know, you know the fart factory by the way,

Speaker 1:          01:05:14       it was not lost on us that you had uh, wide range

Speaker 8:          01:05:17       of farts, little squeakers and big bulkers and you had the engine revs and you mean you really are an artist artist. That means a lot. Yeah. So I mean we definitely enjoyed it. So you're doing this for a while. It's, it's harmless fun is what it seems like. So how like everything came in the news like a week ago is that when the employers took notice, like somebody took care of it. So this went on for like six months without them. Any, anything with nothing. Nobody knew, nobody saw it, heard it. Smelts it, anything. It was just me doing my thing until, until it got picked up by a, I think barstool sports on Instagram and then, you know, slash Sunday night and my Instagram just blew up. I went from 500 followers Sunday night to 5,000, uh, by like midnight that night. Yeah. You're going to have some more, some more.

Speaker 8:          01:06:14       So, so I also watched, we haven't played it on our show yet, but I watched the footage of you getting fired. Yeah. Which, which was amazing that to see that take place because that guy, it was funny, like your superiors like turn that off. You're like, I'm not filming you. And he's like, and you actually go like, are you firing me? And he's like, yeah. You're like, okay, then I'll just keep this role. What are you gonna do about it? Yeah, we've got fire me again. Um, now can I ask you, is there a Mrs Flirt and your life? There is not a missus Florida. No ma'am. Well, maybe after this era as you might find your nose. Yeah. I've been getting hit up by people saying, I don't know why, but this is sexy as hell. They tried to talk to me. Honestly.

Speaker 8:          01:06:58       That is something. Yeah. So of course what everybody you mean, you know, obviously, uh, I created a petition to have a statue of you erected in DC. Um, I'm hoping that tonight when I do Kona, they let me talk about it in the preinterview they said yes and you can't always dictate how those things go, but hopefully that will get on the air. Um, but what I guess what everyone also wants to know is like, you know, the, the, the simple fact of it all is you were a guy with a job who lost his job. What's going to happen now for you? Are you going to pursue this lane as this great farter? Like what are you going to do? Yeah, so I'm keeping the content going is number one for me. Yeah, just try to keep people love it. Why not? Why not keep giving them what they love regardless of anything else, mummy or whatnot, that content needs to keep going.

Speaker 8:          01:07:52       I've got the Patriot and set up, which I'm still not 100% on how all that works and how to use that accurately and efficiently. A lot of people were afraid to use patriot. And a lot of my followers, they never heard of it, never saw it. It was confusing. So they were like put up a go fund me, put up a go fund me. But uh, I didn't want to beg for money and I feel like go fund me is more of like a, just throw your money at me, you know, whatever happens, happens. We're patriots like on creation based stuff. Sure. So I set it up. People are donating. Um, so that's something, but you know, we're going to keep puff weren't on vacation coming up, so we're gonna, you know, throw in a Hawaiian shirt, traveled around to well known places, you know, let them rip all over.

Speaker 8:          01:08:27       Oh, that's a great idea. And if you thought of a website, maybe you have a website going, I don't have a website. You got locked down that URL, dude. Yeah, man, it's probably already locked down. Somebody, the amount of like the Internet, you know, as you guys know is a crazy. It is. But you have, have you checked? You've got to go check. Yeah. It's, um, puff fort.com is definitely taken already. Um, I could probably get that from whoever owns it though, maybe. Or just take of a variation, you know? Yeah. You know, the fart authority or something. And so, uh, I'm fine. I have to la next week to do a TV show came to talk about, you can't talk about it not next week. Thursday actually. So quick, so quick. I can't really talk about what that is yet, but you know, so things are in motion. That's great. You know, we're trying to get shirts and all merchant stuff like that. Just out. That's where something, let me tell you Paul, we love your accessibility because there is another fart person and we play it on the show and he's very at reluctant to be in the spotlight

Speaker 1:          01:09:25       if you've never looked up king ass ripper. He is. Yeah. He's um, he is your brother from another mother man and a very impressive work, but he's not a media savvy.

Speaker 8:          01:09:39       Yeah, he doesn't want it then. You're like the people's farther. That's right. The people is harder for white people. Kind of a elusive, mysterious, just Kimbrough cause you don't want to lose his job. I would be

Speaker 1:          01:09:53       so surprised if he had a job. This guy does not seem employable. Um, no, but we're big fans man. And um, you know, we wish you nothing but the best. So you know, if you get that site going, you tell us about it, we'll plug it, hopefully we'll get a lot more signatures on the petition to the statue that you deserve. And um, uh, your patrion if people want to know, is it just like at Paul Florida? Slash patriotic,

Speaker 8:          01:10:16       everything's, yeah. Patriot and slash Paul Flirt calling me slash Paul for Facebook, Instagram, all slash ball Ford.

Speaker 1:          01:10:23       Great. I think, um, I think our audience is really going to dig you and what you're doing and um, you know, it was a, it was a pleasure to talk to you man. Yeah, man. Anytime. Yeah. And keep us, keep us posted on what you end up doing. You know, if, if this travel thing goes or whatever, where we'd be more than happy to, to plug it on our show.

Speaker 8:          01:10:45       Excellent. Awesome. Thank you guys so much. All right, buddy. Take care. See you guys say, wow. What a real talent. You know, if anything, your mom's house is broken. So many talented people I know rappers charters

Speaker 1:          01:11:01       about um, you know, uh, crazy. Lokes. Yeah. Um, then there was the guy that likes smelling farts. We had him on machines within a machines within great singer.

It's a many a drive through and now Paul Flirt and now Paul, I got to say, I really like his person that he wasn't, yeah, I'm above it. He wasn't too cool. He was like, it is what it is. I'm going to keep doing it. I think it's great and I think he can have a very lucrative social media career.

Speaker 1:          01:11:55       Yeah. I think that this is a lane that a lot of people like and enjoy his talent and why not? Why not go to his patrion and help him out? And you know why? Why not people do it for just being good looking right? Like that camera Alyse kid. Dude, I can't tell you how many times have ended up on an Instagram and you're like, you've never, you've never heard of the person's name. And it's like 5.6 million phones for what? Uh, they're hot, they're in a bikini, then they're a shirtless flexing. They have great bodies. Like, okay, so they have great bodies. This guy has a great talent. What about gray fighters? Yeah. What about him? Why doesn't he does there? And then see someone will be like, well yeah, but I mean that hot chick, you know, she's super hot. Like, yeah, that's it.

Speaker 1:          01:12:36       But that's her God given innate talent and this is, this guy's God given and let him run with it. What is more American? Yeah. Yeah. Paul flirts quest. I agree. I agree. It's capitalism at its finest. I think it's great. Market demands him well, good for him. You know, getting fired from that job might be the best thing that ever happened to him because now he's going to go into this lane. That's true. Yeah. Good for her. I like how he's like, I'm just fat and I just eat a lot. Right. That's the best. Uh, the make come guy has another message. Nope. No thanks. Hold on. Oh, I hate him so much. Huh?

Uh, the television is not only on, but it's on full volume while you record a video message to post to share with people that you want to listen to you. Um, but Anderson Cooper today not right. Yeah. It's very interesting listening to some very liberal media. Um, took the teeth out. It's also a choice, but he shaped, so it's like, what do you like, what do you not like a framed up real tight and starting with, I'm tired of white women, so it's kind of a, Oh yeah, it's a kind of a, I'm triggered already. I mean, let's see what you got to write this guy in email. What I'll make it comes going to say right here.

Speaker 4:          01:15:03       a maybe or he's trying to be funny and it's just maybe I still don't understand the choice to not put your teeth in for a video that goes on the soliciting love. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:16:00       It's a lot. It's a lot. How do you get that way? I Dunno.

Speaker 4:          01:16:05       Your level of not giving a fuck is pretty high, dude. Yeah. No teeth. No teeth is serious. And then to be like, I'm sick of white women, I want to demanding shit.

And you're out and you walk down. No, I know. Great. I'll tell you when you come back in to work, when to get this order. So Brittany, she's a Joe. Okay. Loaner twain. Ours. Right week after she couldn't pay her phone bill number. We were discussing that. No, I just let her borrow $20 phone bill. Girl. I had to ask her twice for that. Finally she gives me $10 of it, right? It's correct. And then says, Oh hey, I got weed for sale off. Give you a front. I'm like pit, you can't afford to get fraud. You owe people money.

Speaker 4:          01:20:32       This is so great. I would love to hear this. I know that, I mean this dude had the right idea. Yeah. You know, I remember when people started, but with the cameras came on cell phones and everybody was panicked. Like, what's the world going to be like when you can record anything? Like the got pretty fucking awesome. Actually. You did the videos like this exist. This is the greatest thing. Yeah. I like that. Because this guy telling you about this. Not In the same,

Speaker 10:         01:20:59       yeah. I almost said to her, okay, give me an end guy away. But then I'm like, no, let me just see if she'll actually give me the damn cash. You know? I don't know. She had some low looking dude in the car with her yesterday. Yeah. Oh look like he's all there on the head. Well, I apologize for the way. How can I help you?

Speaker 1:          01:21:31       She got fired. No, too bad. Yeah, that sucks. It does suck sex. How would it kept for, on course will be better than having that lady represent the company? Um, earlier I was going to show you this footage of your dad. Oh yeah. Yeah. Let's see. I haven't talked to him in a while.

Speaker 11:         01:21:53       The best methamphetamine have anywhere in this bar. I would have to 55 gallon drum and I would pull a lawn chair in the middle and I would stack Budweiser this high and I would have to titty dancers dancing on the tables, stripping and having a good time and I would start drinking beer and the mainstream would be in here ready to go except for the aluminum and I will drink the beer and drop one lemon cane in this side and one in this side and continue until the bubble started jumping out of the camp and started tearing the skin off of you.

Speaker 1:          01:22:26       Pretty good stuff. How can we not talk to him? Um, my dad,

Speaker 4:          01:22:32       hi Deb participates and things I don't want him to participate in. Like

Speaker 12:         01:22:35       one day I had this girl been over the toolbox in the back of a pickup and she was screaming more baby more, maybe more. We passed by this buffalo, he had a dog about this long. Then the hand to the ground. I screamed at him and says, Hey, I love some help over here. She wants more. She looked over at the buffalo. She said, oh, I'd never leave. He had that. Awesome.

Speaker 1:          01:22:56       That's a good story. That's a good story. Do you like him so wrong?

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       This is what's wrong with our country. This guy,

Speaker 13:         01:23:08       I'm all getting on nap and everybody gets within that distance, gets stabbed. Anybody, anybody stay away from me? I want to die of old age and stage 89 I'm going to be chased out of the bedroom of the 18 year old jealous husband and I'm going to trip over fence made out of crank into the street and get hit by a Budweiser truck going 80 miles an hour. That's my idea going out.

Speaker 4:          01:23:34       It's pretty creative actually. He's not bad. He's thought about it. Yeah. I never, I wasn't. I don't think that was in the moment. I think he's like, this is my real fantasy is jam. Well good for him. I'm pretty good stuff, Huh? Okay. Would you rather French kiss and you got a French, that guy, God dammit or the stay United guy. Oof. I like to stay United so much more. His mouth probably smells worse than the next guy. I Dunno. Well cause he's always got mouth rot to. Yeah. But stay United. He's been drinking in the sun all day. Beer like hot beer breath. I don't think that the math master brushes his teeth in prison. No, of course not. But he doesn't drink beer all day in the hot sun. The beer breath is really what I'm thinking about. Yeah. And the rot. You got to pick one state. United Way United. I think I'm still going to stay United cause math guys just, he's never, he's real nasty. He's a really nice and he's violent, you know. Yeah. That too. Like the math master might be like, ah, let's do it. And then he just fucking shank stabbing you. Yeah. Yeah. It's true. Somebody said they made um, a studio g parody or something. Not Cool.

Speaker 7:          01:24:54       Well, I guess it's official taking a shit really wasn't sure about this at the start, but a friend of mine said something to me that made all kinds of stuff. Think about it as a conversation between the food and your digestive system. I like that and has some funding on my own. It's turning between my ass in the sewer I really liked that allows us into each other's lives or in this case, the rest of them. What I think about the kind of shits I want to take, want to take big shifts, smooth shifts. Most of the shits, I'm going to take her just rough shits like this. This is just who I am, so this is like an asshole. I say let the conversation begin.

Speaker 4:          01:25:39       Wow. Bravo sir. Good work is really good. Wow. Just a reminder. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:25:44       Has Anybody does that? I guess it's official. We're now on Facebook. I really wasn't sure about this start then. A friend of mine says just made all kinds of sense. So creepy. You should think of it more as a conversation. Okay. All right. I can only take so much. Oh

Speaker 4:          01:25:59       damn creepy. You know, we haven't watched that in a while. I forgot how like creepy he is. Let the conversation begin. Yeah, he is so weird. How do you feel about public kinks and stuff? What public kinkiness. What does that mean? Well, I know you're talking to they'll most normal boring person sexually. Do you feel like, um, he's too weird for you though, Garth. Garth. I think he's got demons that are darker as in anything you and I could ever muster our imagine. I think that guy is so fucked up inside. He's got all kinds of shit howling and his, I really like that and he's fucked up, man. Nobody Cosby fucked up. Yeah, it's a rapist and you're super famous. You know it's, I think it's so unnatural. No, I know. And this good guy persona, that's always the kiss of death. You know, it's the preacher that is preaching against gays and then he's blowing dudes in bathroom stalls. It's like, I'm perfect. No, you're not cool stuff. Slick stuff. Neat stuff. I just don't trust anybody that doesn't have a bad day every time. Oh yeah. Every time. Cool stuff. Slick stuff. Neat stuff. Just what made you think to say that? He's trying to be, he's trying to be perfect. He's trying to be awesome. He's trying to not be weird. Yeah. He's Goddamn weird inside. You think this is weird?

Speaker 4:          01:27:27       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:27:37       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:27:40       Did he was eating her food? So for people who can't see this guy was at a stoplight and like chowing on his wife's foot or some lady in his car. Oh yeah. Some lady. He's like eating it like it's a cheeseburger. Yeah, he's, he's chomping on. She's on her iPhone just like, anyways, she's recording it or I'll look at it. Something. She might be trying to tune out what happening to her. I mean, I'm not against it. I'm just saying like this. Do you need it? Like you need it at the stoplight? Yeah, sure would be like to be like, all right, we got, we got eight seconds ready and why is he jerking it? Like he's stroking it like it's a hog that's, I think his method is a little, I've tried to see if she's on her. I was recording it. I don't think she's recording.

Speaker 4:          01:28:26       No, I think she's checking her Facebook. She's like, oh, fuck this. Fucking Fred in the foot thing again at the stoplight to stoplight is my favorite part, and she's like, God damn and all right. There's just not much time headed over to handing it to, so he's like, yeah, he's shoving it all the way in there and then look it up, look at it, and he's like, I'll, I'll, I'll Blah la blah. She's like, Bro, what you doing? And look at their reaction. They're just like, yeah, what'd you do and how? I work van. I'm taking a shit. Yeah. He's like the trash collector. He's like the city. I don't know. It's like a van. Yeah. Yeah, Bro. Yeah. It's the best. When someone call someone out like that, are you done with that? Let's stop light. I don't know how to stop, you know, handle your business behind closed doors, y'all.

I'm going to fluid bond with Jesse. You're going to tell your parents about it. Yeah. Let me ruin Thanksgiving by telling my parents I'm bisexual. It's definitely ruining stoplights for some people. You know the problem is in our culture, there's no fucking sense of shame anymore. You know, there's no sense of public versus private life, man.

Speaker 4:          01:30:12       You know [inaudible] people always did this crazy shit. They just knew to keep it behind closed doors. Man. It's true. Now everybody's got cameras. They can video you being a fucking jackass. It's true. The shame is back. Well, that's true. That's a good part. Let's bring shame back. I want to bring it back just a little bit. Just a little bit. That's a little bit. Mm hmm. Oh, what'd you do? You do it, bro. What you doing? It's always us. It's always that voice that calls out, ah, in the car. They're like, roll the window down, leave. They're excited to say it, you know? Hey homie. So funny. Like in anything else, Jean, this is real because he's a real kiss. No, I'm good. I really feel deprived now.
