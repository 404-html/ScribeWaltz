It's full of vitamins and proteins that takes really strong into it. Sort of very, very happy.

Speaker 3:          00:01:09       No.

Speaker 1:          00:01:11       Well go, go to your mom's house. We're talking circle. Christina pushes it. Yes, yes. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:02:00       How's that Magma Manda Hey guys, sneaky became yes. So I think man, milk Monday's the best day of the week. What's wrong with your mouth? Yeah, what's wrong with her mouth? What's happening? It's a, she's doing it on purpose, right? It's like a sexy thing to do. She's over over pronounciating partner lunch, eating, eating, eating the word. Um, I see this a lot on, um, Instagram stories and on general, on the Internet. A lot of girls like to talk even sexier and they'd like to freeze their face. Only talk with our mouth. I was hot. I was watching, I won't, I won't call out her, but, uh, she was doing a video and her whole face was frozen comedian or no. Yeah. And uh, but it just, it's just the bottom jaw move. It was very creepy. Oh, I already know. I already know. Yeah, because you're talking about a guy that looks like her.

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       Here's a guy that looks like her and I, and I'm sure there's reasons for it. Oh, there's reasons which I do too. I'm not throwing stones cause I've done, I've injected things into my face, but, but the whole thing, I just so sexy, honestly believe that if everybody started their day with men milk, we could potentially achieve world peace. Because after you had it, you're just so happy and energetic triggers. What's up? Dude was boring man. Milk this. And he's funny because I, I do think a lot of women think that if they act this way that out, like they're going to win a lot of male approval. But it's, but, but she really winning your heart and mind or is it yeah. Is it working is what I'm saying. This works. We houses not working. What part of you thinks this is not working? I mean cause she married you based on her man. North Mondays are my mom. I'd marry her in a second.

Speaker 2:          00:04:06       What about your brother? Would you marry your brother if he was like this? Yeah, I want to be non binding at the top teeth and at the bottom teeth. Oh did she just bleach the tops? Look Kinda looks like it in this frame. I can't just for a dental. I mean I'm, this isn't it, this is not an official dental updates. I'm not Gunna, that's why I'm saying it's not official. This is off the record. You have a cleaning coming up Monday. Oh you're doing and you're doing the laser whitening the same day. Okay. How was this not an official dental update? I'm sorry. I mean, how is it not, sorry, I just got excited and I, my brain is working slowly today. I'm, I'm so sorry. Okay. I'm sorry. Do you want to search for the, I don't have to search for it. The Tanger, whatever it's called Stinger. It's right here. But I don't know why you would ignore or agreements. Dental updates are dental updates from dental time only. I know what you're doing is wrong. I'm sorry, who was well, because that's really your dental. I date not mine. That's why I didn't want to,

Speaker 4:          00:05:11       I like this.

Speaker 2:          00:05:18       I'm going on a kind of feeling it today. On Monday I'm doing a double whammy. Teeth cleaning and whitening. And I have cautioned you and I really wish you would take my word of caution that that's a lot of painful shit. And one day, I'm not a woman. I don't have bad days. That's my favorite thing that he's ever said. Ooh, awesome. Yeah. So I'm serious though. I should whites, you're going to feel it. You're gonna feel that laser whitening. You know why I'm doing it though? Yes. Cause you have yellow, buttery popcorn team. They're nice. But they're not. They're not. I'm not going to make two trips. I'm doing it for my own because I know myself. So it's like you have me there. I'm like, just sign, sign me up for it. And I made the same exact mistake when I had my crown put on and then I go, yeah, well I'm already there.

Speaker 2:          00:06:07       Why not? That's why I tapped out of the whitening early because I was overwhelmed with pain and why you were overwhelmed with him though. You haven't been having your mind to understand that not everybody is in a relationship, but get a boyfriend, get a girlfriend, how fun life is short, have sex, but of course be safe. Don't get an STD. I say protect yourself, but definitely enjoy life, man milk. It's so amazing. It's so amazing. Many of you have been saying, but it's not vegan because it is an animal product as humans are mammals. But if you look up, the definition of Vegan is actually about not taking advantage of the animals and not using their products, stealing away really their products for your own benefits. But if you don't a girl and you have a boyfriend and he gives you his men milk, you're not taking advantage of anybody.

Speaker 2:          00:07:06       If anything it is a win win situation. So technically it's safe guys. I kind of feel like I would like to start maybe that position, maybe start that movement that man milk is Vegan and it is harmful to the mammal and that you're taking my product, my mail. You know what, I can't help but think of our initial business proposal of calm gum and didn't we do on to like the pump station where you could go and you could have different races and they would come and then you could choose your flavor like a Latin guys just or black guy come gum or one of your own fantasies come jump was to have different flavors from different men in the middle of the gum, like a tight, like that title wave tools have this new pump station fantasy that, I don't know. We came up with this ages ago. I remembered the pump station, it's not called the pump station, it's called. It was like Jamba juice and it was like different come smoothies and it was different guys come gum is all these different guys have different races are dumping their loads can come out of it. And it's like mentos where you can buy everybody's race right now or no. And they're like, what about these two for new Sitcom?

Speaker 2:          00:08:28       You'll check them out and then we're talking about there's something not right, there's something wrong. Um, yeah. So I mean she's a really cool check though. I like her. I think she's cool. Yeah, I think the veganism angle is very important. I really, you know, I never really thought of the fact that you were totally taking advantage of me, but I will say that she is enlightening me in that regard. So what are you saying that you want back payment for all the free loads? Will I just feel like, you know, that you're just using me as an animal for this product and that that is a, I mean it's the level of disrespect. It's a level of manipulation and I just deserve, um, credit for and maybe, maybe I would like you to stop taking advantage of me, you know, I mean, that's what I'm saying. What if we used your product for, other than making, uh, our son. I mean, I don't really use your product for my child using Mondays to feel good, to feel powerful, feel strong, and nothing makes you feel as strong as you said, the best part of your week. I never said that. You've said that before.

Speaker 2:          00:09:49       It's really the most powerful way to start your day is full of proteins. That makes you really strong. Tug and loans all the time. I mean, less so happy. What is this accent she has? She says vitamins. So we know we're, we're talking Australia, maybe New Zealand, maybe England. So maybe, uh, who else has vitamins? It's like a British thing. Yeah, but she doesn't have the accident anywhere else. But she talks, she does talk weird. It's not American history. If you can detect something here and by weird, I mean not American at man milk, drink it, slurp, it's for Vegan. Enjoy that man. Milk, drink it, slurp it, suck it. Likud did I say lick it already, but definitely enjoy guys and have a happy milk man. Milk Monday. Hopefully you guys all get a little bit of milk out of your system and into your girlfriends or boyfriends and vice versa. Enjoy each other guys. My, my theory is that she is European, but she moved many years ago like Canada or the u s and so she has a hint of an accent. Maybe she moved when she was like nine or 10 yes.

Speaker 2:          00:11:02       10 minutes. So maybe to the Canadiens save the two men. No, I don't think so. No. I say vitamin D. Yeah. Wait a minute. I'm Canadian. I should know this. You are Canadian and Ontario. We didn't take vitamins. No, no. And Windsor. That's where I was born. SLURP it. Suck it. We drink beer for vitamins in Windsor. It's really the most powerful way to start your day. That's a stupid dummy. Cool. What are you talking about? Dope. What a dope and disrespectful. You're so jealous. I am. I'm so envious. I cannot stop thinking and we haven't been able to stop making fun of the Moose Soup Lady. Oh my God. That was one of the most amazing women people ever, ever to appear on the show ever. Yeah. Yeah. She's, Oh gee. People have sent in there a photo submissions of what they imagined that she looks like and they're out of control. I between you, the few of them. Amazing. Amazing. Have you seen what they've said?

Speaker 5:          00:12:17       Um, no. Fuck. Let me see if I can pull it. No, but it's really someone wrote in and they're like, we, um, in Canada we have these types of people, they live on the river and they're like, they claim to be broke, but they can afford water toys a lot, which I thought was, that's like, it's so indicative, right? Like I'm poor, but I can afford like a jet ski and a boat.

Speaker 2:          00:12:43       Okay. All right. Listen, I see. That was great. Louie Anderson from the, uh, what's the shared goals or something? Oh, Zach, but golf inaca show. Yeah, that's Sofa in that show is I like, and it like, it's perfect you guys coming down from this. So I feel like,

Speaker 5:          00:13:15       man,

Speaker 2:          00:13:17       I feel like, yeah, I feel like she could probably charge her the sex crimes. You know, I can almost hear the the prosecutor. Yeah. I'm saying like a defendant, your honor came over to my victim, forced herself upon him and did horrific things that frankly we do not want even describe here in this courthouse. Dirty Bitch. You know, it's like there's, you can, you can feel that she is so many bottoms. So many guys. They were like, I was real fucked up. I was a, I was damn it. I was having fucking moose suit back then with this lady. Just, it was the, what's her name? We haven't given her Cheyenne. No rush. She is kind of a Trish, you know. Oh, she's at trash. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:14:13       Calm down. Yeah. And Karen are a trend. Yeah. Seriously. That's what I picture when I'm waiting and that lady had it. Yeah. Oh my God. That's what this is. We found our treasure. You found tricks. This totally hurt. That's what she's, Oh my God, I don't even put that together. Yeah. And I looked up the recipe for moose suit. Okay. Cause I'm like, is this real? Yeah. Yes, that'd be real. It is. Real people put chunks of Moose. And now here's the thing. It's actually very similar to Hungarian Goulash. Lavish slash

Speaker 2:          00:14:43       that's what Goulash lavash Goulash soup. It's very similar except use moose meat and there's Paprika in there. Onion, garlic, Goulash, lie, lie. She's like I just said Paprika, onion, some kind of meat in there. Smokey pepper flavor. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I'm saying. It's, it's just a stew. But I think they put poverty Kennan. And that's what I read about Moose Soup. So it's very similar, Trish. Trish. God dammit that for sure. She's so nasty. She's not a nasty is you and your, um, acrobatic farts lately? Acrobatic farts. Yeah. I've been noticing and I don't know if it's because it's a summer dad time. And you're in your time. I got shorts on right now. I've got summer shoes on. Yeah. You're kind of like Velcro straps on. Yeah. You feel it free. I over those little shoes we put on our kids. They're like ugly sandals, but for kids you let it go, right?

Speaker 2:          00:15:51       Yeah, it's cute on he ripped them off probably. I took him outside and then he was like, ah fuck. He's like, he's a terrible, come on. I ain't no Quia. So I'd take them off our boy. But you've been taking a lot of license with your, your acrobatic farts? I don't, I don't, I mean I'm doing it the regular, I do my hand gestures. I'll do like a punch or like a gunshot thing. Sometimes a leg kick, but don't think it's any different than, you know, another time we were even doing a lot of the diaper me baby, where you pull your legs up on a cup back, but not a lot. A couple more now I feel like it's been a lot more frequent. Hold the legs up. I'm like changed me and then I, yeah, I did that one. I did that sitting up, which was different because I was up late.

Speaker 2:          00:16:38       I did it sitting up and it got like a real interesting pitch on it. Oh my God. The best one now. We were in the living room and the nanny was over and we were playing with Lj and then the nanny and LJ go out of their room and then you rip a horrendous fart and then you're like, oh, I gotta take a shit. And then you leave me there with the fart. And the whole time I'm thinking, oh no, the nanny is going to come back in here and she's going to smell this far and she's going to blame it on me. And I kept planning my story where I was going to, I was just going to tell her like Tom Farr did, you know she's raised three boys. She knows what farts smell like. She knows that those are man farts to you.

Speaker 2:          00:17:14       And she disgusting. You know, since we're talking about this figure, we should bring up this email. I'm Mommy's after originally hearing about your podcast or Tom when he was on Joe Rogan, I subsequently became addicted to the listening to all the Shenanigans Youtube provide for us. All your segments are hilarious and the way the sound board gets worked during the episodes makes my nip hard enough to cut glass or sorry enough to glass. I am touching base to provide a small jingle that I created for your brown talk segments. I love the locomotive theme that you use. I wanted to provide another sound file you can use in case you want to mix it up.

Speaker 6:          00:17:49       I took some of the clips you've mentioned over the past month or so in the podcast. Compose a small arrangement to accompany at. I'm a lifelong musician having experienced in both instruction and live performance. I'm a complete novice when it comes to mixing audio clips on my Mac. Oh good. I'm glad we included this solution. If the file for any reason doesn't sound quite right, let me know. I can edit and send it back to you. Well here we go. This is um, Levens a submission. He signed off by saying Tom is a personality champ. That bird is once again fat, um, Livan submission of a new brown talk theme. So you can see what you think. Okay, here we go.

Speaker 1:          00:18:42       Time.

Speaker 5:          00:18:52       It's got a lot of elements. I ain't no way it's got the Jane, Oh my God. You there's, Oh, disgusting. I liked it. I liked it too. That's good. Thank you. Leave on. Thank you, Lee.

Speaker 6:          00:19:01       Yvonne, not live on, on leave on. Hmm.

Speaker 5:          00:19:06       So you name emails. Can we go into some choice ones that I got? Yeah, absolutely. Um, let's see. Hold on. I wanted to see

Speaker 6:          00:19:14       there's a number of, um, interesting ones that came in.

Speaker 5:          00:19:17       Yeah, I know. I know. I know. I want to find the, we've been asking about, uh, blind people, um, and if they can, hold on, let me make sure. Sorry, I'm sorry. I thought I had this eerie go. She's a blind guy on the blind wipes. So we asked this question a two or three weeks ago now, how to blind people know when they're done wiping. And we've had a lot of different theories. Tom's theory was that you go bare handed and you smell your fingers to see if the wipe is done. And to which I reply, why would you use your bare hand? Yeah, just try the toilet.

Speaker 6:          00:19:52       Well, I think blind people are more, have more in like in touch with the real senses and they don't. They like to use.

Speaker 5:          00:20:04       Okay, so hey mom, did you find out? Yeah, I'm a blind guy and I believe I have answers to some of your questions. Yeah. First off, in response to your guesses, I can't stress this enough. You cannot smell the paper. Paper is unruly. You're more likely to give yourself a dirty Sanchez and anything else. How about that? Smelling your fingers while safer than paper still isn't viable. The paper act as a barrier. Muddying the results if you will. Second, as you probably heard, when you lose one sense, the others get better. Hey, now a blind person's sense of touch, much like Burt's current weight is off the scale when wiping. I can tell from the friction during the wiping process if it needs more amazing between the nerves and the brown eye, the crack and my fingertips. The speed and ease at which the paper moves and years of experience.

Speaker 5:          00:21:00       You learn what glass and a clean uncanny valley feels like. Yeah. Isn't that interesting? He had vision and then he lost it. So He's had both, uh, both sides of the fence, just unbelievable. Yeah. That's pretty interesting stuff, Huh? Yeah, that's crazy. I also got another Ge. We are, she's so good. God dammit, this guy, he's blind, but he can just, you know, he's got a great sense of touch. O m g so also we asked, uh, Ken Blind people be racist. Uh Huh. So, um, this person writes in, hey, Hitler's, I was just glass and then the latest podcast when mommy, Tina read the email wandering and blind people can be racist. A subject. I have some experience and I'm friends with a girl who has been blind since birth and me and my friends have made her guests the races of people in a room and she always gets it, right. Nope. I'm not saying she's racist, but blind people can definitely tell what race people are just by the way they speak high and tight. Fucking Anthony. Yeah, that makes sense. And the guy's name before that was ray. Thank you, ray for sending that email and about wiping. Very interesting. Very interesting. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:22:20       So I'm guessing she's talking about maybe diction, right? Like you can, she hears a voice. She's like, oh, that's a Asian guys.

Speaker 5:          00:22:28       Can I tell you that when I listen to the radio, I can often tell black people. Yeah, we can hear it. There's a different quality like I, you know, you can just big words. No I don't. I don't think that and I know that big words now babe. What? I don't, I don't, that's not what I'm talking about.

Speaker 6:          00:22:52       Hi Personality observation and water champ also. Hi Tom. Okay, that's, that's

Speaker 5:          00:22:59       it's a lot. Oh also I thought he meant in addition to all those things but he means, and then, hi Tom. Yeah, I like this email already.

Speaker 6:          00:23:06       Love the episode with our e shave her. He is a very funny non Jewish Jewish men. Near the end of the episode when talking about the houses you've done the podcast in, I couldn't help but inquire where these homes were. You know, on account of me being a complete creep of poly by non binary. I happened to notice on the googles map that silver lake is right next to just Glassell park. Have you ever lived there and why don't you live there currently? Thanks Jean. Rick and Canada. Um, where did we live? We live in

Speaker 5:          00:23:43       Glassell park. That, that totally

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       near, near near. No. Uh, but no, we lived in silver lake and he's right about that. I mean you want to say what streets we lived on? I don't know. I'm trying to, I'm trying to figure out where this park is cause I forget where it is. Glass Sell Park is the city, I think next to it. It's like a tiny little see Washington, that's where hipsters are now to Atwater. And then silver lake before our, yeah, Glendale Eagle Rock. We didn't live in just Glassell park. Silver Lake. We lived more, we're over here, right over here near the reservoir. Yeah. So yeah, I lived here once on Silver Lake Boulevard when I was dating you. And then I lived, we lived over here. Yeah. Yeah. That was fun. That was fun. I enjoyed silver lake. And the reason, I mean there's a few reasons we don't currently live there. I think it very, you know, for us, we just kind of got lame.

Speaker 2:          00:24:45       We got it. We had a kid and we wanted to have more sprawl to a look. I have a lot of cool hipster friends is too many. There's too many of that neighborhood. It's just too much. I remember being in my late thirties and going to the trader's Joe there and just seeing too many guys with ironic hats and mustaches and I was like, I'm done. I was never that guy. I could live around them for awhile. I can't run them. Yeah, they they. It's really kind of for some racist against hipsters. Are you hipster phobic or does fucking, that's how I am. Disrespect. Respect their pronouns. I should have been a little more respectful of it, but I just went for it. You know? I just went for it. Hey. Hi. How are you? What's your name? What's Your Pronoun? Someone wanted to tell you this deserves, he deserves Christina counterfactual.

Speaker 2:          00:25:37       Champion repeatedly claims in accordance with her mother's ancient gypsy wisdom. I'll turn it in fact, guys farts. Push the shit out. They do. This is fake news. Tom Has never once challenges obviously false statement. Shame on both of you. Think about it. Dummies. You Shit then far to bunch. No, you fart a bunch then. Shit. As far it's pushed the shit out. Listen. Therefore, obviously the shits pushed the farts out. Scientifically speaking. This is super fucking obvious. The poop makes gas and the gas escapes pushed along by the poop. I mean come on love forever. Double Pipe slot wife. Yeah, so what you're saying is farts. Don't push the shit out. Just it's a total mind blower. Wrong. If we're going out for the horse ever. We've got it. We got it all wrong. God dammit is right. Shit cannot believe this. Crazy.

Speaker 5:          00:26:45       Here we go. Hope we'll just change. Do you want to say it to your mother? If she were here, do you want to tell her mom? This whole time we had it wrong. You had a wrong mom. It's not the far to push shit out. This shit out. But you know what we can do now that we are armed with this knowledge. Yeah, we can teach our son the right way. Yeah, we can break the chain in the family knowledge tree. Tell our son the right thing. Train him, if you will. Oh, by the way, I'm so excited that our son has started making fart noises with his mouth. That's awesome. And he's really started to take to the fart humor. The fart bought books that I bought him. It's all coming together. I'm sorry, I just what? This is a super brown episode. There's an

Speaker 6:          00:27:30       male here.

Speaker 5:          00:27:34       My horrible first to shower. I just imagined him going so bad here. Hear it. Maybe I can coach this person.

Speaker 6:          00:27:43       Hey Mommy's. I originally had my first shit to shower experience, but things didn't go so well. I was having a day where even the softest of sevens were being put out to Shane. I'm talking straight up pissing out of my ass. So after I made Brown and wipe to no avail, I hopped in the shower to clean up some more. In the middle of all this, I realized I had to shit again. Obviously I'm soaking wet, can't get back on the toilet. So I decided to go straight down the shower.

Speaker 5:          00:28:12       No, no, no, no.

Speaker 6:          00:28:13       The worst part is I had to bend over and clean my fucking feet. I couldn't help but feeling low and loose for the rest of the day. I was so ashamed of what I had done. Any advice for this first time shower shitter? What are your, what is your experience with shower Brown's? Thanks Stu. Stu

Speaker 5:          00:28:30       and listen to this man. There's so many things you did wrong. Okay. Number one, you never shut down your shower drain. I feel like that's just a given and I should have been more explicit when I talked about my methods. Never ever shit in the shower. That's not the point of shit to shower. The point of shit to shower is to just clean up after you're done browning. So well you need to do is be patient with yourself, with your browns. If you know you're having waves, a painful sevens, give yourself some time. Why are you hurrying to the shower? You know it's going to be a longer time. So take your time with your brown. Yeah. And then when you know you're absolutely finished, then you go shower. And if not just dry off and get back on the toilet. I've done that before too. You know what I'm saying? Yeah.

The other day you were um, you were talking like an old black guy. I forget what you'd sell it to. Are you talking about? I think you were like, don't, don't look at the TV because I remember there was, I had no, I had a, I had an old boss, um, well he's like 20 years ago I used to work for it, Nate, and he would always be like, kid got all the kids over here looking at the TV all day. And I've heard that before. Like older black guys, they always say, look at the TV. Yeah. It's such like a specific phrasing.

Speaker 6:          00:34:01       Yeah. Right. Uh, also it's um, where you staying, right. Where are you staying? Staying as opposed like a, I'm staying over at staying in this neighborhood. I'm staying at this.

Speaker 2:          00:34:12       Oh, okay. Not like I'm living there. Oh wait. Right, correct. Yeah, that's right. The specific difference in mind. That's funny. That's interesting to stay, I stay over on the east side. Correct. As opposed to I live on, right, right. Yeah, that's, that's a very specific thing. But I always loved the idea of looking at TV, look at the quit looking at a TV, get over here and trying to look at the TV and I'm trying to look at the TV, which actually be, think about it. It makes sense. You are looking at the TV. Yeah, that's, that's I think grammatically and logic are staying on the east side. Correct? Correct. It's coherent. Yeah. I Dunno. I always made me laugh looking at the TV. Look at the TV man. Yeah. My old boss used to say that. It's like we were wasting time looking at the TV. This is so fucking cool

Speaker 6:          00:35:01       about to show you. Okay. You think you're ready and I know that you're not, but okay. The thing is this guy has given us so much and he never stops giving us.

And I think this might be the first authentic moment I've ever seen from Garth. Like he's truly in awe. He's truly, I look, this guy has so much money and fame and popularity in everything. Nothing dazzles him anymore. The fact that he's looking at humans in space, I think it genuinely is blowing his dad mind right now. Yeah, that could be true. Yeah, be true. Cause she can't do too many interviews out nurse. When you're, you know, hanging on a wall,

Speaker 10:         00:36:43       do you guys get used to that position or is there any time where the gravity is at your feet at all? Is there a room in there or do you have to wait to get back?

Speaker 2:          00:37:09       such a dad? Man, he looks like he's dad jazz and right now it's like man milk Monday. And I do think they're trimming his beard a little too short. They're doing it wrong. They're not doing like, he needs to see Alan because this is not okay. Got It. Good luck. All right, let's go get the Great Sam. Sorry Sam. He standing out. Sign as hot as balls. Good rescue. But wait, let's, let's keep exploring this because I don't want to, this is really funny. I think it's really genuine. Can I stop now? Yeah. Okay. I'm just excited. I like, but stop talking. Alright, we, we ran out and we, uh, we brought in something we found on the street, the Great Sam Aaa. He's got six trashcan. That's balling. I'm like six trash trashcan of all different colors, man. You guys don't fuck around. Did I wish we actually had six trash cans?

Speaker 2:          00:37:59       We have two trash cans. Oh, to recycling cans. Yeah. And to um, what is it green? It's like green, like poor people don't recycle and they don't give a fuck about Greenberg. That's fine. Baller status right there. I've never been like green, very green and recycling. I wash plastic and paper towel. I mean fucking plates man. No, it's a, first of all, thank you for coming. It's, it's, I don't know. Did we ever have you on before? Yeah, I did the other room and we played a sound body sound. Now it's something a black guy or Tom or back. Yeah, we played Tom or

Speaker 11:         00:38:35       black. Wow. And I did really well. Did you that, yeah, it's on my Wikipedia. We've had, we've had two people almost win it all. I didn't remember if you were, because we had two people get one wrong, uh, one or two wrong. That was, um, what's her name? Miss Pat and Rogan the first time he was on. And then one guy go, oh for 10 and as a black Guy Sydney Castillo, he got zero out of 10 it means something too. Right. That should be just as amazing. That's true. You're right. Fuck up that bad. Yeah. And to be black, not to know your name. Amen. I can remember when they tried to use it in the Oj Simpson trial, like it was a black voice and they're like, that's kind of racist. So it's got a black voice. It's not, we were just talking about, oh we're just talking about, I can tell like when I listen to radio shows, if the color is black, I know 100% or my favorite thing is, is uh, Jason Tebow always talks about this. They should just do a podcast of Mexican callers in the sports radio shows because they're so bad. And the radio guys have to kind of like pat do patty cakes with them cause they don't want to piss off their entire audience for us. Everything they should bring back. Colby Bryant. I was like, we're talking about the Dodgers here. I don't know man. I think in, they're like, hey guy, just talking him through. It starts with a d there's a black guy or no, I'm going to say black guy or a guy wanting to be black.

Speaker 11:         00:40:16       That's true. Uh, the gentleman, we were just listening to you, but the trap. Oh, to see if he can guess. Yeah. Can you just do the audio or you oh sure. No, I can do the audio. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hold on. Let me close this. I got to close it so that he so good. Yeah. So let's see. Can you

Speaker 7:          00:40:33       damn, that shit will be 1000 but ain't gonna be able to bounce sheet and we'd go to the screw glue. Cool. Oh, it was a mall there. You back to pull up or an edge rock talk more off of old fat Buddha Shit for same way to the side.

Speaker 11:         00:40:49       Can you guess the race? Definitely black. And I'm going to go, he's going to the club and he's throwing thousand dollars. Then everybody and his friend comes up in some bullshit car. Oh, it's not bad. It's an interesting interpretation. Correct? No, no, but that was, I mean, you hit, you hit some of the important notes. I think that's really all that matters. I don't think that guy was looking for you to ever see that video where the amigos were almost kind of fight it. The A bt or course. So good. First of all, uh, a black award shows are the best that she just lied, stirring backstage, stabbings and shootings. So it's like the two Basser obviously the Avs and any black horse show, whether it's someone's either going to get shot or, oh dean. So you know, something good's gonna happen there, but they had them on the morning show and these, the literally the black people couldn't understand what the black people were saying.

Speaker 11:         00:41:42       They see, hey, what you're doing so good. It was really amazing. And uh, yeah, this, you know, funny Ali Wong last night, she told me that she went to that and I assume, well, I assume that like, you know, she's a known person that, that she, she got tickets to it. Like she's like, I just want it to be there at the bet awards. I thought she was like, you know she's a performer. She went as like a celebrity. She was like, Nah, like I requested tickets and I got them and I went to it like just for fun just to be at that. That's great. Like that's what it sounds like. You want it to die. Totally. Look at these classes. Of course. I want to go to anything hip hop. This is how languages start. I mean at one point there were a couple of people, everyone's talking the same and then just things get weirder and weirder and now that you've got Chinese Spanish and all that shit because everybody just starts talking their own fucking way. I don't know if Christina extra saw the Migos Joe Button thing. Did you see? I don't know what you guys are talking about.

Speaker 4:          00:42:41       It's like a running joke. You'll be left off that and boots, boots, boots, boots because ever since when you went to jail even though. All right, we got to wrap this up though. Hey listen man, I wish I could talk to him. He goes longer. Man is one of my favorite groups. I've been coming for so long. Glad to succeed.

Speaker 11:         00:43:22       Don't they look like the black agent smiths from the like Black Matrix?

Speaker 4:          00:43:26       I mean I thought it was SWV. That's what I thought. It looked like

Speaker 11:         00:43:36       we're those bad seventies polyester shirts to Fred. Like people could make everything look good. They have a license to make everything cool. It's amazing. Anything cool and she's pregnant like still afraid of getting, yeah, she's going to try it again. God, they never pull out. There was a, I'd be afraid. Did you see, I'm trying to pull this up. I can't get pregnant twice. Wait, what? Oh No, no. I'm saying I just got that a terrible mom now the blacks do y nerdy. No, the video edit where they, they put up, pulled all the moments from that and pushed in on it. Like the, there's an an a cut of everything at that Migos thing and it was just like this,

Speaker 12:         00:44:32       the key, they zoomed in on everyone's reactions. It's like it's masterful, masterfully done and they were able to like isolate everybody's own reactions to what was going on. It was just amazing. Men See if I can find it. All right, keep going. Keep going. You're talking. I just love it dude. I just, I just love black people. Yeah. I'm going to get corn rows and I know you've had issues. You've talked about white people. Cornrows. I've talking about white people. The corn rows. Yeah. I think I might do. How much longer can I do corner? I think this is the end of any corn rows phase. I have. This is the last decade. You can do it. This is like last couple of years. He can't go deep into your forties with corn rows to do. That's the question. My big to the Mexican hairstyle says just grow the tops, the tops.

Speaker 12:         00:45:18       How long? What does that mean? Uh, like I have my hair right now. Just let this thing growing. Yeah, you can do that. Just go longer. And that corn row it up and look like Trey from grand theft auto. That is such a specific look that would really change your whole audience. Why? It would make it even weird. Like I used to have normal glasses when I went up and I thought it looked like Mark Marin and then I'm like, my act is, and mark and Mark Marin's, Texas, phenomenal, but we're just two totally different dudes. These glasses, Tom and I have discussed your glasses like just laying in bed at night. Last, Sam Tripoli's glasses are perfect, perfect. Talks about how perfect this look is for people get weird by them. They get really angry. First of all, they all think they're fake prescription. Oh No, they are though 100% I ended a podcast because I went to a guy, hey, are those, are those real glass?

Speaker 12:         00:46:12       He goes, no, I go, that's fucking stupid. And we just had a huge blowup and we never did a podcast. What do you mean? I had a podcast called the international bad boys. Our me and my buddy were on it and one day come in and I'm just like, are those real glasses? He goes, no, I go, that's fucking stupid. Why? He wearing fake classes and we just, it just kerosene on fire. Boom, exploded and we just ended it. What was his, um, his, I mean, his thing was I just liked the way they look or what I mean, nothing against him. I didn't mean anything by it. Oh yeah. And it just got really bad. Who Was it? Easy Guy Works at the store. He, we're way cool now, but I'm happy it happened because now I'm not in this new podcast called tin foil hat and I just do conspiracy theories about lizard people and deep state shit and creep.

Speaker 12:         00:47:01       You end up 100%. Really? I love it dude. But do you really like, do you really believe in all the big ones then? You're like 100% 100%. Look at building six. No one talks about building six. It's imploded from the incident. You believe though, that the US government conspired to make this happen to fuel a war like it was at one of those? I believe that the, uh, I think that there are, we'll call them the deep state creates problems in order to beg us to save us from those problems to drug war. Yeah. I mean, we find out that, uh, you know that the CIA and one of their assets was Pablo Escobar, how all the cocaine get here. You know, where it went into Arkansas, who's governor? Bill Clinton went at the time was smuggling all this cocaine and, and that fueled the cocaine, the crack wars, the crack, a epidemic of all that stuff.

Speaker 12:         00:47:58       So then they beg us to say them, the drug war against drugs, blah, blah, blah. I think it's, it's totally their moon landing. I don't know about that one either. We went to the moon. We have two options. Either we've never been passed the van Allen Belt and it's all bullshit and it's black ops to make the take money into putting other stuff or we're on every planet. I don't think there's any inbetween. I think Ron Moore planets I think were everywhere. Yeah. Why would we not say talk about it though? Because I don't think, I think in my opinion, if you start saying that there are aliens and there's stuff going out there, I think one religion goes out the door. Yeah. The thought of that. We're the center of the universe and that everything revolves around it. Now there's like Japanese lizard people running around, right?

Speaker 12:         00:48:43       Like straight up Asian looking mother fuckers that that goes out the fucking door. I think it causes hysteria. I think you're right because there's so many hyper religious people in this country they couldn't handle and they control them through religion. But here's my, my one reason that I don't buy into a lot of conspiracy theories. Have you ever done a military gig? Like where they flown you from country like the Middle East? Yes. Have you ever been on the flights where they schedule you like you're going to go from Kyrgyzstan to Kandahar if you've been on those military skills? Are they ever a organized or, I'm just saying that the military is so fucking disorganized and you're considered a VIP when you do those. I just don't think that the government has that much structure to be able to pull off these things. I just not that organized.

Speaker 12:         00:49:30       I understand that and I totally agree with that. But I think at the highest level, you always hear this a lot like a, you know, I've had discussion with Comedians, they're like, somebody would say something at some point you're like, well people have, and they kind of get discredited, but the higher up you go, there's less people involved. So the numbers like a, this one comic, I can't say her name did this, like she did, uh, the super special forces. Like we're the best of the special forces all come into one. And like every room she went to, she had to sign a new doc saying that she wouldn't tell anybody about it and basically, uh, they'd kill her if she said anything. Like that's how top just told you on your fucking Patt Air podcast to told me a dog park. But I, but the point is it gets deep and like we're in a, we have special forces like 130 countries. It's like I can name 130 countries, but I always feel like one of the, I mean the, the level of like for instance, people that believe

Speaker 6:          00:50:28       that the moon landing is fake. You would for it to be fake, the level of the amount of people that would be keeping a secret, it would just, it would be enormous. I mean, you'd have to be fooling either you're fooling everybody who's, that's their work. Theirs, they know that. No, it's, it's, it's kind of difficult to believe or that everybody involved for 50 years never told a secret.

Speaker 12:         00:50:57       I understand that too. I'm just, my whole p pain is, is the, the, the farther up on the chain you get, the harder and harder it gets there. And they do a lot of, a lot of analog analyzing you, your habits, they spy on you, they get, they get blackmail stuff and the higher up you go, the more you're in, the more you're in, the more you have at stake. So it's not like everybody at the bombs, let's say like you're at the comedy store. Yeah. Like there's a, there's the open Mike. Hers. Yeah, there's the regulars, there's the headliners. And then there's like the super duper like theater dudes who are all doing all that stuff. That's a very concentrated group of people. Right. And not everybody down here can go up to here and hang out there. It's like, it's very, it's hears of it. Yes. And like the good and within a structured environment to get up to that level is harder and harder. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:51:48       Now you post really great things on Instagram. I love your Instagram. What is it at, at Sam Triple Aaa, and you have a great Facebook feed. And I was at you who posted the other day that the elite, powerful men of the world are all pedophiles. Oh yeah, no, it's true. And here's old gay man. Yeah, yeah. And here's the thing, and now it's a right too.

Speaker 12:         00:52:09       [inaudible] was, listen, pizza gate was used to discredit the pedo gate. So everyone's like, oh, they're fucking kids and pizza parlors. No, it's, it's much different. And it goes, this is deep state shit.

Speaker 5:          00:52:23       Hold on. Before we go ahead, go ahead. Go ahead. The thing is, I would not have believed that had I not heard a woman on Paul Gilmartin's mental illness happy hour podcast who was a child victim of this exact pedophile ring. And they would torture her, keep her in a box, put roaches on her and rape her and she would tell she tells a story on Paul and I'm serious and she's an actual person. I don't think she made it up. It sounds horrible. Whoa. That weird weird shit does exist within the, this is I, is this more darker than I feel like I come into podcasts, change everything he was saying, well that was just terrible. It

Speaker 12:         00:53:01       gets ugly and there's a reason for that and it's like the higher up you go. Okay. There's a couple of, there's a big controversy going on right now and read it and that there are a couple of youtube channels and Daniel Tosh did a big story on it. The have over like 10 billion views that are basically like corporate child porn now. They're not like kids doing like, uh, but it's insinuation, you know, and it's like, looks like, so if you free something, it looks really creepy and there's 10 billion views on these legs, right? So what they do is, my opinion is, is this is how they start the gather people like they're, they're analyzing who are watching these head, these videos, right? And okay, that's great. And you're like, okay, we know this guy. But it's also other people with darker things going, okay, who's, who's maybe susceptible to this type of stuff that's secretly what they are into.

Speaker 12:         00:53:56       Maybe this guy's running for politics, right? So now they fast track these guys and they put them in these weird awkward situations, film them, and then they blackmail the fuck out of him. There was a famous producer, they used to throw cocaine and hookers shows, I mean parties and he would film everything. So if you are up for negotiation, they'd be, he'd be like, no dude, I'm not going to sign for that. That's bullshit. It's like, okay, let's watch this thing. You doing coke out some trainee hookers asshole. And then you're like, okay, I'll sign for that. It's like, I mean, as the money, you got to think there's trillions of dollars. Are we suggest, I mean is the idea that people in power are all pedophiles? No, just no, but there's a lot. There's a lot. Okay, dude, listen, I feel like I'm, okay. So in my opinion, within the conspiracy theory community, there's a lot of antisemitism and I like go in there and my girlfriend's Jewish and I go in there and I go, I go at it.

Speaker 12:         00:54:50       Organized religions. There's always this like, oh, Jewish guys run the bank. It's like, it's all bullshit. It's all like organized religions are to these very high up people are just Halloween masks. They wear them to move around us. And B, because the truth of the matter is it's, and this goes sound crazy as fuck. It's Luciferian Shit. It's like very, it's not like, Oh, hail Satan. It's like very dark art shit. Now in the Vatican there is a throne called the thrown of Lucifer in the Vatican in which the pope sits and behind him is this big demon. Do just go, oh. And it's like, why is that in the fucking Vatican world is weird. It's really dark, weird shit exists because there's so many whack jobs. I do feel like the older I get, I you realize just how crazy everyone is. And especially with the Internet, you can see how crazy people are all the time.

Speaker 12:         00:55:48       Wait, are you, please tell me, are you a believer that sandy hook is a hoax? I think there's interesting stuff to it. There's us. What are you talking about? If there's really, I'm not saying it did or didn't happen. Wait how I'm saying there's interesting things that don't make a lot of sense involved with it. Like what? Like first of all, okay. Do you remember Columbine? Okay. What do we see in Columbine? People knocking out windows like Ha, like shut, trying to crawl out to get away. We see kids running all over the, we see none of that. We see one picture of one woman leading a couple of kids out and it's a still picture. There's nothing out. The, uh, the, the mom who's supposedly died lake later on, she doesn't really exist. She's, uh, she wasn't a teacher there, then it turns out she was like a substitute teacher at another school somewhere else.

Speaker 12:         00:56:43       So there's just all these little things that we start going, oh man, that's kind of weird that, I mean like if you go deep diving into it and you got to go really deep because if you're expecting that the, the, the six of, excuse me, all the alphabet networks to tell you everything. Well, back in the 90s, the cleanse deregulate the media and we went from a 88 different companies owning 90% of the media to six companies owning all the media. So it's very, and those companies, they make more money off of other shit than they do off of the media. So the media is just used to fund their other stuff. So anyways, there's, there's a lot crazy. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         00:57:23       Well what about the fake moon landing? Garth Brooks, we saw him. He, he's fake then. Well that's the thing. Okay, so if the moon landing isn't real, are they faking? Like all these conversations with astronauts and shit. Like when we see them, you can't do too many interviews out nurse. When you're, you know, hanging on a wall, there are thoughts about it

Speaker 10:         00:57:42       guys get used to that position or is there any time where the gravity is at your feet at all? Is there a room in there or do you have to wait to get back?

Speaker 11:         00:57:53       Yeah, we uh, we have to wait until we get back. Man, I'm missing Nascar man. That's why barbecue up here, you know, saying he kind Kinda Husky for uh, an astronaut. No, he's stocky there. What's happening? So thank you from the bottom of my heart for being such an inspiration to so many and uh, making those words count.

Speaker 10:         00:58:16       Wow. Thank you. Wow. See crying. Yup. Thanks for hearing the music that says that's a cool part of it and thanks for letting me get to be a part of it.

Speaker 11:         00:58:26       So what's going on there? Do you buy those tears? He's crying. Just so those of you not watching Garth Brooks, that brought him to tears. Yeah. One of the two years that I guy was like, I love you. I like your music drawing that has, have you ever had someone compliment you after a show and then you're like, what's the greatest compliment? It's really dirty and you don't want to hear it. Come on, come on. Wilfy you already ruined my opinion with your Ms Pearcey so just tell me that they said it this, it's nasty. Somebody was just like, I want to fucking eat. You know this more. The most gorgeous chicks I ever seen in my life goes up and she goes, your comedy, he makes me feel the same way I get when I eat my own pussy. I was like, Damn. And I was like, that's pretty nice. That's very nice. And that is a couple of kids in wheelchairs that were very thankful to, I did a special Olympic shell and they were cool. Did Really? Yeah, I

Speaker 12:         00:59:21       did that. If that's a true, I'd talk about it on stage and wait. I remember years ago I saw you have a will. Do you do your wheelchair bit for them? I always get asked to do it. It's a, it's a young man's joke. I can't do it. If I go down, I can't come back. That's like, you know, it's like you have your memories of seeing stuff. I remember Sam seeing Sam do that in the main room, uh, like a while ago, long time ago. I remember you on the, I actually remembered the same on the same night. You know, you just have like, you remember bits and pieces of things. I remember seeing Aaron cater the same night on the show. We all got picked up the same time at the world famous comedy store by Mitzi Shore. She had picked us up because she wanted an uh, an Arab show and Dunkin was the, this is so true.

Speaker 12:         01:00:04       Dunkin Dunkins like Tripoli. Are you a Middle East? And I'm like, I'm Armenian. He's like close enough. And he taught me like there used to be the secret to how to get picked up by Mitzi and it was, you do a one joke about you're a family member, one joke about your ethnic group and then do your favorite bit. And so I had this bit that Joey Diaz loved. Then I was like, okay, I'm going to do that. Been at w I did a joke about my mom power walking. Then how me being furry, going to the mall on going to the beach and I just bit about Asians on ecstasy that you used to do about how their visuals are so much better because there's so much smarter, right? Like dumb people's vigils or like eight bit and their visuals are like Dolby, Imax, digital sound. And I get off stage and uh, I saw Paul Mooney talking to her and I'm like, aw man, he's, cause back in the day when you showcased the comedy store, people would hijack your showcases because, because they, they, they weren't getting spots, so they had to talk to Mitzi.

Speaker 12:         01:00:58       So she remembered them. Right. So, um, I looked down at Paul Mooneys off and I'm like, fuck man. And I'd had a weird running with Moonee like two weeks earlier and, which I was on stage at this show it at the Hustler, a hustler adult bookstore. They had a comedy show there and it was run by this guy named Johnny Montana, who's like coked out of his skull and he would just do jokes about his head shots for like every week. And I was due to joke about how, uh, how, uh, how hard it is to be a white guy. And I got off stage and Paul Mooney ran up Migos, oh, you ate white use Armenian user. And he dropped the hard and bomb Ami. Yeah. Wait, Whoa, we're not the word the m word. Which one? He, okay. He goes, oh me, you ain't white. Use a meaning.

Speaker 12:         01:01:42       Use a Nigga. And I was like, Damn. The dude who coined the phrase basically called me the ward. So I was like, I don't know. Is this guy like me or not? So I go, I go do the set, I do the set. And I see him talking to her and I'm like, fuck. Mooney's talking to her. Well, it turns out he really liked me and he goes, oh, Mitzi, you got picked. This guy is really fun, which is totally cool. And I'm always thankful to Paul Mooney for that. So I come out and I go, and the whole thing is after your showcase, you walk up to Mitzi and you kind of kiss the ring, right? So I walk up and I'm like, Hey Mitzi, thank you so much for the showcase. She goes, are you Syrian? And I didn't know what the fuck's hearing was.

Speaker 12:         01:02:22       And I'm like, Yep, I'm totally fucking Syrian wa I love Vienna, Syria and I love Syrian food. She's like, okay, I want you in the showcase tomorrow night. So Jay Davidson had a huge show called Dublin's and I don't know if you guys were out here during that board. Dublin's was huge. He said, go watch that show. And I remember giving Jay Davis a VHS tape, such a crazy time. I tried to do a doc on that move on that show. And of course it got completely fucked up by crazy people. But um, so he's doing a show the next night in the main room, I did a showcase. This is how cool Mazda Brown he is. He gets me in. He's a great guy. Cool. Stewed you offer me one of the guys is stayed real no matter what's happened to them. One of the most real dude you for me.

Speaker 12:         01:03:07       So Ahmed, Ahmed, Aaron cater myself are all showcasing eh Mazda's already irregular. So we go up when we do our set and we all have really good sets. Mas wants to give Brett Ernston so Mazda disappears. Mazda's like, oh they give it like we can't find Mazda. Like can we put somebody else up? They put him up, they put Bret Ernst stop. Bret Ernst does a showcase. All four of us get picked up that day. So on the same day, same day, what year was that? That was 99 or 2000 wow. Yeah. 2000 seriously. 100% fuck man, it was a year before nine 11 because she wants, she thought that like Arabs are gonna need a voice. Like that's how crazy it was. Wow. Because you picked this up, but she made us be regulars and worked a door like I had to work to door. And then, you know, four months after I moved to La in 2002 I met Sam.

Speaker 12:         01:04:01       We did the Groundlings together and he was so fast and like, I used to be a real knucklehead and you can leave it like a gun recognizes a gun. You know what I'm saying? Like you're like, okay, this guy's fucking good. So you get to be like, either we're going to be rivals or we can be friends. Right. And I'm like, this guy's so fast. Let's be friends. So I did to you what was done to me in that I joined an Improv troupe thinking it was a standup comedy show. I didn't know what it was. And my friend Victor Isaac, who lives out in la now, it's like, you're really funny. Come do standup. I'm like, you know, and I go, do you do stand up? And you're like, no. I'm like, you fucking should do stand up. You're really funny. So I took you around for like a week.

Speaker 12:         01:04:38       I could, it was, it was, you're responsible for encouraging young. Of course, of course. It's awesome Sammy. Like what was the other, what was like the Sushi restaurant kind of across from Dublin? They had a show there, a search without, um, shit. And I was just talking about the other day with a Doug Stan hope. What was it? Miyagi's yeah, and I was, uh, I basically was like, I don't know what to do. And he goes, you just do spots. And I like, I didn't even understand how that, what that meant. And I tagged along with Sammy, went to Miyagi's, we went to the comedy store, we went in one other place. And so I just

Speaker 11:         01:05:17       got to see like, oh, so like, and then he's like, you know, like, I'll just do this here. I'll try it here. And like, I'll watch them do like 15 minutes sets and he's like, just do it. Just do it. Just do it. But then you did a couple shows at that place above, um, the Improv school on libray. You had a show there, right? Room five? I did. I did a bunch of like those little, you know, like, and then we're off. Uh, I remember doing like I was, I started to know too, I got a, I started doing the Improv's gave me mc working. Oh for you move quickly. He did Europe,

Speaker 5:          01:05:57       man, you were at Thompson Guerra. I always tell people this, I ran a tiny room in Los Filez called Tangier. We were all open makers when Tommy started stand up when he was 23 years old. He was good. He immediately like, you are one of those assholes. Oh I hate it was like, are you kidding me? Yeah. He started and he was better than all of us and I was like, you gotta be shitting me. I had two closing out my open miker show essentially every week. Cause you were fun. You were the funniest one.

Speaker 11:         01:06:27       Okay. So, um, you were fast food. You and nick were fast and nick, by the way, Wagoner, we were also, yeah, it's also in Sam and my improv class. He's the one that introduced me cause he was also had done stand up. He introduced me to a booker as a comic. So he goes, you should put, he goes, you should a Tom's grade should have them. And The lady goes, Oh, you're a comic. And I just went, yeah. And then she goes, uh, all right. I'm sure April 22nd you want to do that show? And I was like, yeah. And that's how I did my first spot I ride and just was always, that's how I lied to get in the copy. So then there was cat, what's her name? Kat Wrightman. Right man. And then there was the trucker from a smokey and the bandit smoking hot daughter who's dating somebody from Lincoln Park.

Speaker 11:         01:07:20       Yeah, Lincoln Park that she was dating the drummer from Lincoln Park. That's right. So hot. Horrible at Improv horror. Right. But she didn't care know. And everybody was like, you date the guy from the apart. And she loved it. She was like, yeah, I do. I'm so into it. Then you just took off, man. I remember you're doing all these little spots and then you were just gone. So you were just doing spot and then you were just touring off of you, been, you and Sebastian both were row dogging right out the gate. Yeah. Yeah. Sebastian was. So, it's a funny thing about Sebastian. Sebastian was Sebastian from the drop persona was there. I saw him yeah. 10, eight plus years ago. Yeah. Doing an o our spot. I was just at the club one. I did the belly rooms. I used to do a bunch of belly room shows that weren't like official shows, you know, and popping. And that dude was exactly the same. Exactly the same guy. He honed at anyone out with guys for awhile. He did for dice.

Speaker 12:         01:08:16       He opened for dice. Never would have ever expected that dice lumped him cause he was like Italian dice is Kinda got the Italian thing going on and uh, just went off and he was just

Speaker 11:         01:08:26       so, um, this shit like Sebastian's new stuff feels like polished material is just a way of delivering and like, and, and like laying out with a bit is that feels like a finished product on the first take. You know, it was like the first time he says like, I was at the gym, he's talking about what happened at the gym today. It feels like, I feel this is a bit, it's like what happened today?

Speaker 12:         01:08:50       He knows like that Doug Stanhope in terms of that. And he would never say this, but a like he's been doing it so long, he knows his voice. He can anything happen. Goes Ray through the voice box and comes out and he's got a point of view. Yeah. Burrs that, burrs like that. Yeah. I'm sure you guys are like that. Yeah. I mean it's like if you've done it long enough, you know your take, you know, it's so inappropriate time. When I were sitting around talking about our favorite comics and I was like, my favorite comics are 50 year old white guys. Like I just fucking love the Shemel's, the Louis C K obviously like bill burr in that lane. All these white guys I've watched coming up and you're like, that's, to me, that's still the gold standard layer. Older white guys guys wrong with that. Oh, I just love them while their masters.

Speaker 12:         01:09:43       Yeah. I think comedy's going through something right now where it's like the actual humor is like the last thing they care about in a weird way. I feel like there's so many people getting pushed forward just because we need an APP. We need a biracial bisexual person and you're like, you know, I'm thinking about sucking black dicks in front of everybody just to get fucking something. Go and you know, just go on stage and just crushed Jamar neighbors dick in front of everybody. Just so somebody will fucking sign me the something. It just like so true. Right? There's a sissy. That guy's Tripoli's suck. That guy's not great for the new Gilmore girls. Why don't you sign on to that? You got to pick your pronoun or wrote me them like your pronoun a Pronoun. You can be a Zimmer [inaudible] you can be a man, a woman, a man. I don't know. What is your pronoun? I'm Zim. Why?

Speaker 11:         01:10:42       Because I don't want you to assume that I'm a male. Okay. You're being really presumptuous and you're, you're determining my gender. Let me determine what my gender I respect. There you go. I respect your non gender. Gender. Thank you amgen. So I don't want you to say what's he like? Okay, well when you say what Zim, like are they your they, yeah. What's Your Pronoun? That's interesting. Hey, by the way, I wanted to ask you this because you do your conspiracy theory, conspiracy theory podcast, which is called foil tin foil

Speaker 12:         01:11:14       hat with Sam Triplet. Do you ever address, there's this ridiculous conspiracy theory about like Armenian genocide you ever hit than that? Like they claim that like that, like the Turks wiped upon. There's a couple things about that. Is that like, do you address that when we go through that they told you like, oh, they put on this whole charade? Yeah, it was really, it was really great. They didn't boo hoo, they got a couple of tattoos, just made some shit up. So when did that supposedly like when's the salary that they happened? Five or something like that? Ain't no, no, no. It was way back. I went when though, what year? 2000. On the, excuse me, 1917. Oh Wow. And how many, uh, purported to a million to a million people. 1 million people? Yeah, but like come on a million. But do you really think that many people died? Why? Because, because, because people told me because the fucking let let her networks, ABC, CBS, Oh, I had, I had, I had an uncle that was involved in all that.

Speaker 12:         01:12:18       What did you do at kill by my mother's uncle. Excuse me? Your mom's uncle. What was a in a camp? Uh, he was uh, he had a fucking tattoo on him. Did the Turks do, they came in and kicked our dates. They did last suck our dicks in a lot of this. So like Dick's talk, what was the willow suck on the what? What led to this? Like what was the event that led to this? I mean, what's so interesting about Armenians? Man is I do ask about the law yet. They do smell good. We shower in Cologne, I do it. I have the longest running show ever at the comedy store is a 15 year charity event. Happens once a year called the Armenian bone marrow registry. And a cousin of mine had a bone marrow cancer and she couldn't, they couldn't find a match.

Speaker 12:         01:13:09       She Still Willis, she is still, she beat it naturally. But her mom, my cousin, my mother's cousin, Yep. Ah, couldn't find a match her. And this doctor named Dr Frida Jordan decided to start in an Armenian bone marrow registry where people would get tested and see if they're a Merrill matched. And it's like this event that's insane because you actually see the results of your, your actions. Like sometimes you do charity event, you're like, I hope somebody got that money. You know what I'm saying? But this one, like they built a giant hospital in Armenia and all that stuff. And the reason we have a unique genetic makeup is that, uh, we're basically inbreds oh yeah. Cause we're the only Christian country surrounded by most on all of those tell people. So it's like a, so we only hooked up with our own, you know, so it was like our hookup app was like ancestry.com we genetically, you guys are a disaster. Yes. Yeah. Basically, and that's why we have to have this whole thing going on. So, but the Turks who when they were like, suck our Dicks,

Speaker 11:         01:14:12       did they not this most of this? Yeah. They like suck my Dick. Fuck you guys. Is that, is that guns are, is that limp dicks just bouncing around telling two people the second you go back Mcavoy job, I just like, it's like a Turkey, Armenia, let's go at it. And then they just had a weird thing and there were war crimes committed. And it's so interesting that there's actually something called the young Turks, which is, and I love their political views, but you're literally named after like that region's Nazis, you know, they like, they went and slider a bunch of people and you're like, so this was like during world war one or this was 1917 that be, so that was, I think, yeah, right around that or a little before it. Right. I thought that'd be during that, is that wrong or right before 1945 was the items were war in 1914 to 1918 there then, okay.

Speaker 11:         01:15:08       So let's see. Armenian. You sound kind of upset about that. She seemed to be holding a grudge on that one movie that didn't do well. Yeah. And you also had a great, you had Christian, but yeah, we have one movie, Armenian genocide. Are you stoked about, does that eve even Steven? Well, yeah. I mean, they're like the most famous people ever worse. Kim Kardashians or her two younger sisters who just last life think a Pepsi can cues, you know, like hand people, Pepsi, everyone's thoughts fighting. That was amazing. So now they put it on a tee shirt. You see this unbelievable. The fucking Badass. These girls through their own images up over like the doors, pink Floyd, big Biggie's Stupak. And how amazing the backlash was so swift that there was, I mean 20 like they were testing like maybe we can get away with this.

Speaker 11:         01:16:02       Everyone was like, fuck no, you can't do like, sorry. Anyway, and moved on. Like it was just, it's a blink of an eye. They're like, we tried. People said no, but I don't know that they lost any of anyone that liked him. You know, because the younger the tweeny boppers who's baggy or who's whatever, they're ripping on basically what Djs do. Literally Djs do that, like puffy combs. That's all he did was he put like, yeah. At the club over like over like everybody doing real singing a police, which is all they did. You were going to take you and I'm gonna put you right here and now it's my finger. Right. I had never thought of it like that. Right. They're like, well it looks familiar. Thick. Yeah. Well I actually, it actually like when uh, Biggie's mom came out and was like soap opera, so about it, they could have been like, did you guys contact Stang you put out.

Speaker 11:         01:16:56       That's true. It's so true man. Cause that the hip hop dead, especially puffy who I, by the way, I love him. I loved that. He, I think he's a genius. That guy is like a mogul and brilliant in so many ways. But his era specifically was like, that's a hot, so I'm just going to go to it. And take that, take that, take that, and then people were like, that's an awesome song. And when did you come up with that? If people were like, that's fucking in the stones. Yeah. They may not get a, did he not get penalized when they bought it? They license it. They end up paying a fortune to do it. Yeah. That's the thing is it? I guess it is ultimately worth it. You make enough money. Yeah. Vanilla ice baby ice ice baby is just under pressure, but he got screwed on that. He was trying to say there's that great interview where he's like, that's [inaudible] Donna. Donna. No, that's not going to hold up, dude.

Speaker 12:         01:17:48       The take from like anything involving Freddie Mercury is, I like blasphemy. I mean the song is amazing. Have you ever seen Queen at Wembley Stadium? No. It is not just a music. The greatest performance I've ever seen in my life. Like this guy owns this crowd. Like I've never seen anybody own a crowd before. He's running around. He's got those bad British teeth where they're just like the, it looks like a gateway to a haunted fucking house. Right? It's just like the gays.

Speaker 11:         01:18:18       Yeah. Wait, we didn't finish our, oh yeah, we're still in the international space by the way. It says that Armenian genocide is a hoax. So, uh, moving along,

Speaker 10:         01:18:34       um, I noticed, uh, we've been watching you guys for a while. I notice a, the gentleman from Russia pop back there and uh, what's it like up there where there's nothing other than what you have in common is why you're together. That's gotta be a great feeling. And I bet you guys probably just forget that you're from different places.

Speaker 12:         01:18:55       Oh Gee. There's one. Okay. At the highest levels of like business, these CEOs, they love to go to like dominate tricks and just get the shit kicked. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:19:06       Yeah. Because they got to do this shit. Yeah. Not Him. That right now. Like, man, do you guys just sing about freedom? See, that's what bothers us so much. He says, Liar. I don't believe that this is authentic. I don't think he, I think he wants to be like, you guys take shits out in the space right now. Is that crazy horse? Yeah. Well the first question was a normal question. Do you guys ever feel like it's not gravity gravity? Yeah. It was the first question that that's like dumb. We'd ask now. He's like, everybody loves me. I've got to have some. Yeah. Yeah. Where he from? Everything's in. I'm just boy from Oklahoma. Yeah. Shucks. Shut up. Fuck it. Ask ask about the shits. That's really what I would ask them to come all over my face. How do you guys a jerk off? Why y'all eat yogurt? I want to know anytime y'all have pornography up there you'd have to beat off upside down. So shut up. Where's that?

Speaker 11:         01:20:12       Where does the come gold was up in space jacking my Dick Space Jack. There's so much of this in entertainment though in general, like the, it's almost gotten like politics where it's like you have to have this pristine image to get anything going. That's not bullshit. That's why these podcasts are great, right? You can literally make it so different too. Like, I just did an hour and a half of press before this on the phone radio for upcoming dates. And it's like, you know, you could tell when they're cool right away. It's like, it's like you just 30 seconds and you're like, all right man. And then sometimes they're like, Ma, you hear me married to a comedian and what's that like? And I'm like, fuck. And I just start like, you know, I'm like, like one of them was like, so are your wife coming on this joke? I don't want to bring her with me.

Speaker 11:         01:21:04       He was like, ah, I'm all right. I didn't mean to upset you. I'm like, I'm fucking kidding. And like it just, he was so, they all asked the automated questions, you know, what can people expect it? The show? And it's just, it's all corporate dude. Such a world out there that I think like, and you see happening in comedy right now. It's like I'm starting to like, you know, like I couldn't, ups weren't hiring me because I was crazy, but now it's like comedies caught up to what I'm doing. Comedies in a good place right now in a great place and like these clubs are still like, I need clean comedy. It's like, that doesn't exist and your world is not real. Did you ever do juniors and Erie? No. No, of course not. They knew what was up. They had a no cursing, no innuendo, no t bad top.

Speaker 11:         01:21:54       I did it twice. I did it as a feature and a headliner and I got one time I got off. She was like, did you say penis when you're up there now let me go. It's anatomically correct, and she was like, all right, but just please exist in the Mormon know ultra religious. That's the thing is the fear is that somebody won't buy a ticket to your dumb show or some sponsors going to pull out, you know, this guy sells out multiple arena, like 20 can we see more? Is that what it says next? Just forget your differences and learning those in yourself, or do you, is there somewhere that has all them? No, I put it in myself. Oh my God. There's only about 600 on this is 77 yeah, there's seven years of that. Money is never done drugs happy. It's been awhile. Yeah. G I do think that I'm not fussing with wet international culture. It's a one way or we're supportive of each other as a team. Worrying about what nationality, nationality. Just be defined on your knowledge of stuff and then sharing that with each other. That's a, that's a great message for these people is a great message.

Speaker 11:         01:23:15       So wait, what'd you rather give? The guy just said that lady with the dairy queen driving. Fucking you want out of it to be a large. That is, by the way,

Speaker 6:          01:23:27       imagine her, her telling you what you did wrong in the order. She would totally be your manager. Oh, like he did so many things around. First of all, he didn't welcome him. Right? Didn't say your name and the greetings. Why didn't you ask him if he wanted sprinkles on that? Wait, Tommy. Okay. Would you rather have sex with a moose soup lady? Loose soup lady or the female astronauts? Oh, well I feel like Sammy doesn't know what we're talking about and that's not really fair. So let's um, key him in on the Moose Soup Lady. The uh, there was a speedboat race and I think West Virginia and this lady was watching, she watched the Guy Wa wipe out and we don't get to see her, but she's the moose suit lady. We imagined her and her. We have imagination of what she's like cause you can hear her.

Speaker 13:         01:24:15       Fuck you guys are doing good. Is that Charlie Carey? Calm down. I come down here after I got those stupid everything. Alright, you guys are doing good. Hey, I got you on video dirty. Oh God.

Speaker 11:         01:25:05       Don't you think that she has a horrific sexual history from me? She was the town bike. There's no way. Pretty bows dagger, right? Tell right. Yeah. Just 30 seconds of video. He's a combination of like cafeteria lady would bus drive her ride with fucking DMV worker at somebody smokes a day. How many packs? All of them. All of them are helpful brand. What do we think of Derek? I'm thinking generics now. I think we're rolled their own. Yeah. Or some kind of native American ones. We'll see. I don't think two rolls around that because that's just too much labor. I think it's lazy. Gets packs. She buys the cartons at it. Oh yeah. If she was like CME, go get me a pack. And you, you brought back a single pack. She's like a pack means 20 packs. You fucking idiot. Like she would get on you for only 100% yeah. Karen, there's no way that does not involve a moment. Yeah. No. And like you're like both we all three guys on that boat or fucking if she, if they come over from moose soup, that is part of the equation. Do you choose the net that NASA astronaut take a look at her up here on orbit. We have kind of an international culture. Either her or who we imagine the moose soup lady to be. What are you, oh definitely this one. This will be horrible sex. I still think she's less disgusting ass. Not Chick all day. Why is that Sammy? What? I mean she's, she probably

Speaker 12:         01:26:57       everything together. She probably does Ph balance on her vagina. Like she puts a little Ph thing, make sure that the Cidex fucking right

Speaker 11:         01:27:05       Bob, do you that she doesn't like men are, that doesn't turn you off. I've looked up the lesbians before. I'm built like once a fuck. Have you really hooked up with a lesbian

Speaker 12:         01:27:16       dude? There was this chicken Arizona and she was, my brother used to run strip bars and I would always go do the gigs in Arizona.

Speaker 11:         01:27:23       I want to hang out with a triple e men sometime. I feel that you guys just have stories

Speaker 12:         01:27:27       more. Uh, my brother's awesome. I would say he's a little more conservative than I am. He's, we're for a guy who runs a strip bar. He's, he's a little more concise. He's one of those libertarian dudes, you know? So, uh, so we're kind of the same. I'm just a little crazier. He's more conservative and uh, you know, so he'd run these strip bars and I'd show up and there's this one girl was a stripper and she was just like, you know, I've been a lesbian for the last like five years or the first tick I've had instantly you feel like Jackie Robinson, you know, it's like you got to represent your people. Have you fucked this up? They never get a shot again. Right. So I just had to work my ass off. So yeah. Did, I've hooked up with it. It's not, it's, it's interesting. It's shit.

Speaker 11:         01:28:08       Well, wouldn't they be less responsive to intuit at all? She was into it. I did. I ever,

Speaker 12:         01:28:16       oh yeah. I told us the last time I was having show, but there was this like lesbian and Dana Point, she was like a lipstick lesbian. She was gorgeous and she probably got cheated on by right.

Speaker 11:         01:28:24       Boyfriend ran to the lesbian for a little while, you know, so it's like, yes, sometimes they're hot. I've done that. I've been like on gigs were lesbian couples come out and you know the ones that do and the ones to check and the chick is fucking hot and she wants to get weird, you know? So you're going for the astronaut? Yes. Over the fucking large Marge term. I think I'm going to go with this. The astronauts, I mean the moose soup lady is horrifying. Does she? She could take out her teeth, gum it, she'd be gumming Ya. But the thing is with the, with the NASA lady is that she is a sexual, I mean there is not a hormone, there's not an estrogen left. If she likes guys to begin with, shorty,

Speaker 12:         01:29:14       you know, she reminds me, officer. No. Do you guys remember the old police academy movies? Yeah, blond with a big rack. He's like militant, but still love it. She could be that. She'd be like, she could be like a mullet. You know what I'm saying? Business up here. Once. Camera's off fucking party back there. You know what I'm saying? She might like to get weird man, but like, she's like, I'm a woman. I have to work harder at, you'd be more serious. And then offstage, she's just gobbling Russian dicks. You know what I'm saying? Trying to bring people together. It would be why did you guys have Trump and just start sucking him off.

Speaker 11:         01:29:47       Oh Man. Yeah. It could be. It could be. I mean, I still think this is a far, far better option. Um, then calm down. I think so. I think that's a bad one. Mg USC. What happens next with Gartha? Yeah, here we go.

Speaker 10:         01:30:07       Native by him going to introduce you to my better 99.9%. Um, Michelle would actually make the trip. I was here today, so I want her to come to Trisha's here. There's Trish. Hey Trish. Hi. How are you doing?

Speaker 11:         01:30:22       How's that for a power couple is fucking power. Couple of this is, I feel like this nerd set it up and then the space ladies like, who the fuck's this bitch? Like? Yeah, like this whole thing you set up is all for you. Crystal. Leah mentions he might have a girlfriend onstage. All the girls are like,

Speaker 12:         01:30:45       oh, I know. She's like Garth Brooks. Oh, here's my wife. Oh fuck.

Speaker 11:         01:30:53       Oh Man. What's Trish again and say, what's your high gas man? I just love what you're doing for America. Are there any bald eagles

Speaker 10:         01:31:02       watching you guys and listening to both of you and just a thank you both for your service and on growth is probably said all that, but just honored to be here and uh, just I, I can't get over it. I'm just doing the spinning a microphone and the socks. Do you guys have socks or ongoing?

Speaker 11:         01:31:24       It's just a natural. How much money do you got to make to do that? Like be like him dump money on you and you're already making good money to start bailing the bean. Like the hat dude, he's probably, he's probably making like a right now with his touring, like 80 to 100 million a year. Would you do that for 180 million talking like that? You're like, Oh man, you got good cookies up there. What? I think so. I think so. How you got baseball, you guys catch baseball like America. I would love to be in that tuition. You and the people that like listen to this part yet. Hold me accountable. Like you like remember when you were like this and they show old clip of me and I'd be like, it was way back before cause shock. That was before.

Speaker 11:         01:32:14       Yeah. And I just go off and I just look at someone like shut that shit off. I honestly don't think I could even know what to say. Like to be normal to abnormal. Do you know, how do you even do this? How do you learn the script of what's normal? No matter how high you guys are, you're not higher than GC. So can you see God, you know God's Hough Avenue Right now? You feel like you're closer to cross. Can you see the angels? But you listen to like this. Like you ever heard that song they use in all commercials? Like follow me.

Speaker 11:         01:33:07       So song that this rock band and every fucking commercial. But then so one thought would be, might be good idea to play it live at some of that. It is the most dog shit song you'll ever, cause it's only meant for commercial, right? There's like huge downtime if you weren't exposed to certain types of music. Like I never knew that that like forward like a rock was a real song. That's a, what is that secret? I didn't, I thought that was just for like a song in a commercial. Then you hear in real life and then you can't like it like blow you Turkish Bob Seger.

Speaker 11:         01:34:01       Yeah, that's just a story. What was the one they just had towards bi? Gene? A Budweiser commercial. Disgusting. Gross. But then there are songs that are real that I can't believe are real. Like the other day we were in the kitchen and a shirt on their stand up next to you when new man here. Toby Keith. That's real. That's a real love. They love it. I like the equivalent of super clean comics you ever meet. They're so angry and they're bitter and they treat people like shit cause they made business decisions. You know? Gorgeous. Probably the nicest people to hang out with. Those guys are fucking West. Most deviant comedians are the ones that are like, to me the other day that Nick Dipaolo is the nicest guy in the world. I go, I totally make sense to me because he goes up and says everything he wants to say on stage. David tells like that Super Nice. The People Tripoli's like that

Speaker 12:         01:34:58       are, you should fear is like the nicest guy, you know? But then you look at the monster that Bill Cosby is, right? And he's up there talking about bullshit for years. Nice guy. No you're not. And then on top of that, it's like telling all their people, telling other people how to do comedy. Like that was really my biggest problem with the whole lives of slessinger thing was that she was like, oh, you're working dirty, blah blah blah. Low hanging fruits. Like you're not doing rocket science up there. You know, and I'd love you to death. But it's like, I'm just tired of like people who make business decision getting mad at people who go up there and just try to give a piece of their soul for their art. You know, I, you know, being the Carl Sagan of Dick Jokes, which I've often called myself, um, I just like to go up there and just fucking have fun and like, you know, financially it's, it's led itself to where it is, you know?

Speaker 12:         01:35:52       And I just like, do you want, don't worry about what I, if you want to be a businessperson, go do it. Just don't tell other people how they should be doing comedy. That's my whole problem. Don't, don't tell everyone else. Right. Yeah. It's like, you want to be a rapist who does clean comedy. Yay for you, Bill Cosby. Yeah. Right. Wow. Isn't that nuts? That's funny. He gave so much, so many unsolicited lessons to people caused me like how to live, how to dress, how to fucking remember that Wanda Sykes moment where it's like, oh, she's like, how'd you guys do back in your days? And he's like, we spoke English. And I'm like, everyone's like, oh yeah. At that, at the award show. And then you find out he's probably roofing everybody there. Oh man, there's a sterling sharp guy and not stir something Deron sharp.

Speaker 12:         01:36:41       He was sharper. He was a football player. Don't give that to sterling Sharpe. Jesus Christ. Oh, he's great. Yeah. The one guy who went to jail for like forever, he was like a hall of Famer. Good looking black athlete sharp is shit. Yeah. And you would be roofing girls so crazy. He could just stack change prison for a long time. Now it's fucking terrible. It was really crazy man that he um, but that dude, he was in the league for a long time. He was like all decade. And then like all the charges were like in, uh, the, the division town teams that you'd be like, oh, like he had like four in New Orleans and check the schedule and then the next day how many calls with Ecog, whatever piece of shit. That guy who said this years ago, they were like, the best serial killer would be as a traveling comic.

Speaker 12:         01:37:31       I mean, there was the guy who was a rapist, the famous comic who would like ever, he'd go play campuses and there was rapes on every campus where he performed, looked up his beard. Right. His fucking signature still on the wall at the comedy Magic Club. Yeah. It's up because everyone's signed things for years and they're like, that dude's in prison. Darrin sharper was on the hall. Fame ballot. Yeah. Oh yeah. Well, I mean we remembered after Oj got accused, it took like NBC like a month to fire him. The fuck go crazy. Let's hold off for a little bit. Vince champ. That's his name. The comedian was raping people. Is there any comedy of him on Youtube? I bet you hear a clean comic. He was the, he wants star search in 1900. Yeah. Proves our theory. Yeah. The biggest psychos are the ones who are pretending not to be, who were just talking about things. Everything. Like I don't think you have to work dirty to be funny. Am I right? Oh my God. What's up a Walmart? Am I right? Am I got cats and dogs are different. They are totally different

Speaker 6:          01:38:44       there. Is that, what's his name has been on here before? Brido Bryden Stein and he told that great story about Norm Mcdonald and Iowa 20 years ago where he went, um, and it was, it was built as a family friendly show and it was like three or 4,000 people and they bought and I'm Darrell Hammond went up, then Jim brewer and then norm and norms. First joke was about, he saw a video of a pig fucking

Speaker 12:         01:39:11       woman. Brido is at the show. He says as he's saying it like you just like

Speaker 6:          01:39:18       stand up. And then norm was like, what did you want to talk about losing your luggage at the airport?

Speaker 12:         01:39:24       I'm with you dude. Of course. For that they like this. I wish I do. There's part of me that wishes I could like that stuff. Oh, in the room. And then I could just watch friends, marathons and think they're fantastic. I want to love network television. Let me love this one of those couples, they're going around the world. That's crazy. And I just like, I go home, I like, my mother is like this, she's like convince Islamic rapist. Jihadis are everywhere in upstate New York. We live by cows. By the way, there's a cow crossing a block from where I live that the conspiracy theory guy can't believe his mom has a conspiracy theory about the most watched too much CNN, right? Yeah. Too much of that shit. So I like, she like, she wanted to come see me in Syracuse, has playing the funny bone and she wanted to stay in my hotel room.

Speaker 12:         01:40:16       Like I'm the only guy that brings back chicks. That's your mom after your fucking show. But she comes and she slept with her purse in the bed next to her like this. And I'm like, mom, the only person could steal that is me. That, what are you trying to say about me? But she, uh, all she watches his HGN and it's just every shows a, a gay guy selling real estate in fucking Manhattan. But she's pleased, right? She's had, she's contagious. Loves it. Yeah. She just loves it. But every show's a gay guy selling fucking real estate. Go ahead. The one show that I don't understand why anybody can watch are those like the Kelly and Regis in the morning that that

Speaker 11:         01:40:54       Kelly rip on whoever now it's Ryan Seacrest or they talk about nothing for an hour. Like who's who's tuning in? What Weird Shit do you think Ryan Seacrest is into? He's got a, he's big on that like Garth persona, so he's like, hey guys, it's like all smiles and we got the special kids from the Olympics here, Matt, and they really let us know we can do anything. We dream about it. We'll be right back with special kits. And then he turns and what do you think that the thing that he says that next is get this fucking Juda stop looking at him like he says he doesn't like to get pegged in the ass. There's no way he gets whatever weird chick he's doing a reality show with. Put a big fucking angry red deldot and just no lube. Just Ram it. Don't tell him. Heard him make him cry and that's how, who gets on the show? For sure. Being the weird shit. Allegedly. Yeah. So many of them do, especially with these, these phony personas.

I got some great stories about how I got away from a police helicopter chase a couple of gigs. I did it in the desert, some crazy shit, special Olympics show. And then the second album was called Friday night late show and it's basically me bombing for an hour.

Speaker 11:         01:45:15       I so admire the guys that do shit like that though. I'm putting it out there. Where did you record that

I'm going to put it out and see how it goes. And uh, about five minutes and I realized this crowd is not playing along and then just start ripping them a new asshole for like 45 minutes. And I had the best time. Really? Yeah. So I put it out. So it's like two hours of power

Speaker 11:         01:45:44       and there's like, there's, is there a major bombing moments?

Speaker 12:         01:45:47       Oh yeah. But even my bombing is entertaining. I go out in a blaze of glory. You know what? I'm going for it. Oh yeah. I'm going to leave a mark.

Speaker 12:         01:46:16       okay, the best way to describe it, you are the hundredth man at a 99 gang bang. It is. It is sloppy beat up, ready to go home and you got to somehow get a reaction from this crowd. Everything's been talked about a thousand times. They've seen every famous person they've ever wanted to see and you just got to somehow get them to not only laugh but you can't. You've got to entertainment enough that they stay for the next guy. So there's all this kind of pressure on you to do it. So I love it. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:46:45       On those late night spots to people ever like, do you see guys go like if

Speaker 12:         01:46:50       this sucks, they're just like, just sabotage the spot and be like, well fuck it and like not try. Does that happen? I think occasionally that happens, but I think like all the people at the end are kind of like friends with everybody and we kind of all got her like, we, I keep these people here for the next person. Do you really do? I think everybody kind of works together in this weird way and I have energy at that hour. Right. And it's, it's the comedy store. I mean, regardless of whether you're doing a, uh, uh, you know, uh, nine 45 or a 1:00 AM, it's still the comedy store and no matter how how late you are, you've still blessed. I have to be like one of what, 3000, 4,000, 5,000 comics in La to get a spot in that room and that time. So it's had like 40 people working that night, basically like, you know what I mean?

Speaker 12:         01:47:42       Like crazy. Like this, this size, it's good. Attrition rate is so crazy for comedy. Like when we all started around the same time, when you think about who we started with, it's crazier. It's harder than Harvard law. Like it's so hard. There's nobody left. It's basically comedy store versus New York City comedy. Like that's all. If there was no comedy store, I think La comedy be in Breely bad shape, but it's the one place, it's kind of Mecca. Whereas you go out to like New York, it's like such a different fun vibe out there and you can explore by think the comedy store is the one place where you can take, well, I don't know. The lineups are so killer now, but it's like it's Mecca. So it's like even if you're doing a one o'clock in the morning spot, you still want to do the best that you can.

Speaker 12:         01:48:25       Yeah. Because if you start tanking it, they'll take that away from you and they'll put somebody else in there who, they will watch it though. Okay. Keep an eye, keep tabs on and we'll get out if like, you know, like this guy's just Sam snitches to man. There's some snitches crybaby bullshit going on, which I've wouldn't ruled and never talk bad about a comic tool booker. I think that's just the worst fucking figure. The world. That's real shit. I think that's the low, I mean like it's just below stealing jokes. He goes stealing jokes and then shit talking. Even if I don't like somebody, I would never talk shit to them to a booker. But people do that. And so you get those late night spots. I think they're the only, they're the only spots and work on shit store. Those early spots, man, you got to fucking sling heat because it's just murder's row.

Speaker 12:         01:49:13       When you get like past 1130, it's like it starts to thin out, you can take a couple more chances. And that's kind of what I do miss that part of the comedy store where it was like a workout room. But I also understand that, you know, Adam and Eric and all those guys have to have that place sold out or else they'll knock it down and turn it into like a fucking condominium or some shit like that. And by the way, that uh, as far as workout rooms, I feel like there's really nothing like the belly room. That belly room is like fucking amazing. I'm starting a new new room. It's called the Dojo and a, I'm going to doing it. We're doing it Thursdays and the goal is to kind of get it going. So it's like you can actually go work on shit. That'd be great. It's right down the street from the comedy store. The show would start at eight. You guys could do your spots and then run down to your store set and, but you can do 1520 of just working on shit.

Speaker 6:          01:50:04       See, I like when it's, I like when the show, like people say work on shit at all kinds of shows, but I like when it's designated as such, like when it's advertised as such. So the audience goes, this is an actual gym right now that changes the dynamic of the show. You really feel like you can take real chances. It's not like you're doing a regular Saturday night show somewhere and they're like, work shit out. And you're like, okay. But it's like when the show was like, that's why I liked that, that stand up on this spot. And I love that show. And uh, use of new materials show. It's like, this is, this is not proven stuff. This is, you know what I mean? You really feel like you can really jump into half the

Speaker 12:         01:50:43       be able to fail. Yeah. And sometimes in la it's very hard. Like the Improv is like Pablo Francisco long time ago told me never work on new shit. The improv, like that's the office, that's where the industry goes. Hangouts. Now the comedy store is kind of that, but it's like, and then he used to be at the comedy store cause there was like 20 people in the crowd and everybody's doing coke in the back and fuck and having weird fuck weirdness. You could work on shit. But it's not like that anymore. So I uh, I'm working on this place every night. You sit fucking 50 people in there. It's packed out. It's a great idea. Let us know when you, when it's up and running Russia, my goal is to get gone Wednesday through Saturday and have this guy, my buddy TK him and I run it. And then you could show up every day and whenever you want to work on shit.

Speaker 12:         01:51:29       Oh wait, is it t? K? Um, what's his name? I forget tks last name, but he's like a calm around forever. Yeah. But he, yeah, he's a friend of mine and I cause it set this bar that I saw on like the use of an upstairs. I'm like disappeared. Great Place for Comedy Club. And I go there and Teekay's run room. We'd been friends for a long time. Like I want to do a new room here, so a new night. He's like, let's do it. So we've done it. It's been packed out the last two times. I want to start getting every week I want to get it so starts running.

Speaker 6:          01:51:56       That's cool. By the way, I think it's so funny that they had like the old cheat code to getting past for Mitzi was. I love that. That it was like ethnic thing, family thing, your favorite bit. I wish I had known that I fucking did not get passed for her. And I remember I was on stage and I look and she was, you know, straight back like we're Adam basically sits and um, I, I could in the middle of like first bit or like second bit and I can see her talking to somebody and I'm like, ah, getting hijacked. And like, yeah. Yeah. And I'm just like trying to like say what I'm saying and then, uh, you know, I'm turning here and I would look back and she was, I could see her still being like, no, no, no, like just, just having a conversation. I was like, fuck. And then I, you know, I'm like, what happened? They're like, no, I should know. Ah, man. But a comic the same night, I remember this opened with like, I know what you're thinking. Like I look like this past,

Speaker 12:         01:52:55       yeah, well she was old school, you know, and she's little, but she, she had a vision to, there's all these famous stories of like famous people coming up, calling her up going, hey, I'm blah blah blah mom, blah blah, blah. I'd love to play your club. And she's like, I'm gonna fuck, hang up. You know? So I, I, I get, she treated me well. I don't know what it was. I was getting tons of spots in there and it, I, it was a blessing. It was also kinda encouraged cause you'd like, you're getting like five spots a week at the comedy store. I don't want to go on the road. I'm make money here. I'm doing all these live shows, selling all the sad stuff, you know, I mean it's a, I'm making all these a sponsorship money so I don't want to go on the road as much as I did it and then it's like becomes this kind of false victory. So I think the key is to do a little bit there, then go out and practice your Kung Fu out there. It's like now you're getting a lot of spots there and it's like, it's such an interesting thing. And the reason I think it's one of the hardest rooms to do is because there's no host you have to go up. It can be like five o'clock fire, like Rogan just flame throwed that fucking room. And guess who has to go up right after that. You're right. And you know, it's so interesting, isn't it?

Speaker 6:          01:54:04       To up your game. You gotta you know you can't really fuck around and makes you focus on what you're,

Speaker 12:         01:54:09       I think I'm going to ask the file Joey Dsl the time just to see if I could crack that code. Cause it's just, I mean it's a combination of like funny, well-written, super energy. I, I followed him couple times for the first five minutes. I'm like Charlie Brown's mom, no one's listened. I'm like Mall Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah and everything show it is, it's uncle Joe. And then after they settled,

Speaker 6:          01:54:31       either way, that dude, especially for 15 to 20 minutes is a nightmare. Like you know, it's like that amount of time for him is like, cause he can really like just drop a grenade, you know, it doesn't have to like it's, it's

Speaker 12:         01:54:48       Rogan used to bring me out with them and I'd always have to, I'd have to fall Diaz. Yeah. Yeah. And one time in San Jose Dude, he opened up and did like 12 minutes of like next level as seating material, like next level. And I just want to go, what do I have that can fall back and it's nothing. It's nothing and you go rogue. You're, why are you making me follow this guy? I go following Joey Diaz at the Joe Rogan show is like featuring or middling for van Halen, but the opening act is David Lee Roth.

Speaker 6:          01:55:18       Yeah, I had it. I had a number of Rogan tour dates where I would follow him too and I'd be like, this sucks man. I used to be, you know what I do just settle in harder. The material, not tried to fight what he had done. Just try to like stay in the in the material and see if like maybe a minute later they'll kind of gravitate to you.

Speaker 12:         01:55:41       That's kind of what I've learned man over like at some point at the comedy store, my material was carrying me when I was like had Bambi legs, you know where I'm like, Oh yeah, just let the material carry me. Right now it's kind of like I can fall anybody. I've been fine. I mean like horse during my first two years at the comedy store for at least the first year I got bumped by dice every night. He just come in, he would come and find me on the lineup and be like, I want to go here. And he would just do an hour before me and then rogue and I had the fall Rogan all the time. So any week I was either following Rogan dice or Eddie Griffin doing literally two and a half, three hours.

Speaker 6:          01:56:18       I just remember, I remember seeing him do, um, by the way, way, but you know a work there just hanging out there. And he was like standing on room on tables in the Oh, are like walking from table to table smoking and talking about a Jewish conspiracy theories about how the highways or the roads in DC, how they design them. And I was like, what is going? And I wasn't a regular there, so I was just like stepping in. I'm like, this is what happens here. Have this guy, he's talks about these crazy theories and, and smokes and nobody says anything like it was bananas to watch, you know, like it, I was really, I was so floored by what I saw and not in a good way. I was just like, I need to stay away from this place. They get nuts.

Speaker 12:         01:56:59       Well, I was born and bred in that shit and then I will go on the road and thinking everything's the comedy store and just go nuts. And it was just like, Eh, it was like wrong thing. So I had to readjust myself. It's interesting to go out going, okay, not everything's a comedy source. So my style of comedy, I call a gator roll. It's where it's like, you know, alligators kill things. They, they grab it at the top and then they slowly drag it down and then they drowned in spin around. I started really simple with maybe some shit, my pants material, right. Bring them in. Yeah. Relatability. And then next thing you know, I'm doing a bit about smoking crack with his fucking black robot guy. That happened to me one time. There you go.

Speaker 12:         01:57:41       Perfect. Oh good dude. Gimme gimme the plugs. Where can people find everything? Uh, you guys check out my double album. The diabolical, it's on iTunes.
