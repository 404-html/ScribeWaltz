I don't know why. I feel like, cause it's going, this must be like, I dunno, some setting or something, something going through that board. I don't know. Is it volume too high somewhere? No, because it wasn't too high. It just was super distorted. Yeah. It's really weird. I Dunno. Well here come the emails. Here's what's wrong. Oh, I love watching. People are going to tell me right now. Oh No, no. Cause it's always, um, like when something goes wrong audio wise, yeah. People go, um, uh, you know, you get like, like when there was the, um, remember the, we had the, the old monitor here, I got like a

Speaker 5:          00:05:58       hundred emails and it's all like one guy was like probably that you're htmi cable is in plugged in all the way. I know that sounds silly that you should try it. And then the next guy goes, do you have this input? Do you have this output? Do you have the setting? It's not that, it's not like everyone tells you a different thing that makes you really upset, you know? No, it doesn't make me upset. It's, um, it ends up being like they ended up proposing 50 different things that can be, so what'll happen is that sounds a store did that someone's going to be, it's this channel. It's this cable. Yeah. It's this thing is this dial. It's, it's, it's going to be 50 different suggestions. I'm saying. No one can know without being here what the actual problem is. You know, luckily we have the Hitler therapist to help us. So this guy, um, I dunno, this is just what he does. He's a, he's, I like how these guys introduce themselves. I don't know if you saw this or not, but this is how they entered it.

I don't know who the most famous, maybe they are the most famous on the Internet. Yeah. Are they don't know. But they're exactly the coolest that you can claim to be. Sure. We're the most famous,

Speaker 5:          00:08:56       You know, I think if you're thinking with your brain, you just, it's just funny that like, I don't know if for the guy that I'm is the most famous physical therapist on the Internet, I don't know if you realize what you're doing when you put that on the Internet, like you're putting, you're putting yourself saying, Heil Hitler on the Internet. Let me know what's going to come to that perfect gift. A little Photoshop stuff's going to start your, uh, your outfit's going to change. First of all, familiar with swaps. It goes, but they're going to be all over the other guys like you are. That's the way to do it. You got a Heil Hitler and you know that. That's what he says in our private sessions too.

Speaker 6:          00:09:40       If you want that elbow to heal a dislocated shoulder,

Speaker 5:          00:09:44       do it Tom. You do it. You've been doing it. No, I'm making sure that my dislocated shoulder is back in shape. Yeah, there you go. It feels good. Can you lend a now?

Speaker 7:          00:10:01       I didn't say

Speaker 5:          00:10:02       I know. Let's say they called these niggas

Speaker 7:          00:10:14       always. Yeah, always setting me up. I'm not setting you up. Okay,

Speaker 6:          00:10:19       interesting. We should bring this up. So remember last week I put out a call to our English or anybody in the United Kingdom to let us know if they still say fags, right. For cigarettes. Someone, uh, Lee writes in, I'm writing to confirm that. Yes, we still call cigarettes fags. Quote, can I bum a fag off you translates to, can I have one of your cigarettes? I haven't actually, I haven't actual fag as a friend. The other day I asked if I could bum one of his fags. He was fine with that. No confusion. He gave me a cigarette.

Speaker 5:          00:10:49       Interesting. There you go. So it was, I held that position that it wouldn't change that, that slide. So I'm challenged. Yeah. Okay. Consensus is I, it's unchallenged because, but they also, they don't say he's a fag. She's a fag or something like that. Right.

Speaker 7:          00:11:06       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:11:08       I was waiting for this and I'm surprised it took this long

Speaker 5:          00:11:12       show up. So if we could review real quick, where is this photo even from? That looks like it might be from the, uh, that show that those two put on a couple. Oh, the super serious show. Super serious picture. Um, and so a good one for a while, I've been suggesting a hairstyle or Christina to stand out, to stand out from the rest, stand out from the crowd. And I know that she's been developing this hour and you know, working on, on getting an hour shot. And I go, man, how about, how about for the special than a year? No, I know you're going to end up shooting. Yeah. You do something that really pops like to the crap, right? You're scrolling

Speaker 6:          00:11:54       through. Well, who specialists that I watch and then, and then you land on this. Imagine you're, you're paging through, okay, who do I watch? Who Do I watch? And this is the cover art. Tell me you're not clicking play well. What's the title? The title is Farc Shit. Ah, no. You know, I look like their Benjamin Franklin. You do look like Benjamin Franklin. Yeah. Kind of similar. He did kind of, yeah. Yeah. Interesting. The coloring and the expression. So would it be electricity please? That'd be the name of your special. Yeah. Oh, how about I'm electric. Okay. Look at that picture. That right here. It says I'm, and here's the, now for the people listening, we're looking at, unfortunately it's Photoshop that I wish it were real, but it is the skull at style that I was encouraging you where there's no hair on top. It's completely shaped, but on the side, your full length, and you have an expression that says, I got something to say or something interesting going on. What? Anything married just fine. I think it's boring. And then I get to see a nice picture of me.

Speaker 6:          00:13:09       Tell me what's wrong with standing out with something like this. You know right now I go, Oh, you got a nice head of hair, so right here I go, whoa. Plus, then you're going to be like just another female comic, right. She talking about her period. I don't want to hear that, but this chick has shit. This is raw. This chick's a little out there. Yeah. I mean I wouldn't even need to put caution tape over the over my mouth and what's already there. The caution tape is, is, is, is there without being that I don't even need like a comedy shirt. Flames on it. Yup. It's a really nice look. Thank you, Tom. You're welcome. I'm glad that you finally could see why I've been, sometimes we'll be married. You, I swear to God, I remember I was talking about this yesterday. We were sitting in the nursery with our son was one year old now who is just winding down for the night and you're sitting in your robe and your dad boxers and your slips slips and it just a filthy shirt and your legs are open.

Speaker 6:          00:14:10       You're sitting in the one proper chair. I'm sitting on the fork chair and you're farting and you're, you know, your guts are hanging out and you go, who could meet married to you? I was like a lot of people when you were like, no, it Kinda, here's why a lot of husbands fart. Burb make photoshops of their wife with a skullet but very few husbands really unleashed with the fury that you do. Like who of your friends that are married? Yeah. Ha. Like who unloads as hard as you do on their wife in terms of like the, the burbs, the farts, the spread. You spread your ass cheeks and Fart. Oh, you did this, you got it from the dinner table. And our kid and I were sitting there, you bent over, you put your hands on the table and you bent over and you went and then you, you farted as you stood up.

Speaker 6:          00:15:03       Yeah. Do you think a lot of men do that? I think so. Yeah. Well wait, why did, I don't think many do, but many don't do that because they want to be seen as sexually exciting. We're talking about Ku Gaucher savage to their wife, and then we agreed that Bert, definitely, that's true that Burt takes it to that level. Well, what you, the stories you've told me it's pretty heinous. Yeah, no, I know that he clips his fingernails and then puts them on a piece of scotch tape and the tape. Some under a coffee to coffee table. Yeah. Raw. That's Herenton told me about one time he was toying with his asshole. I don't like the story at all. Oh my God. And laying in bed and was like, what's that smell? So she was like, this smells like garbage. And then he was like, oh my God, could you now that's really vulgar. Like that's, that's, I don't care if I ever get laid again. It was bart. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:15:57       But most of my friends, you're right, they do dial it back a little bit. They dial it back. Why do you think that is? I mean, it depends on which friend you're talking about. Some of them just have different, some of them, their wives will fucking kill them. Yeah. Yeah. But you know, that's what I mean. We get emails from people that owe me and my, you know, my spouse or like you and this and that. So we have people that definitely the people only know the the show version, which is not far from the real version, but I'm saying that they don't actually get to see you in your boxers with your nuts hanging out and not only that, modeling some pretty great behavior for our one year old. Oh yeah, he's really going to, because it's, it's in high gear now. He's waving hi and I'm laughing a lot now.

Speaker 6:          00:16:40       The little jokes that we have and it's coming where he's going to start ripping him and then laughing and then wanting to be like, oh shit. Oh we have to pick up poop word. We've been talking about that. That's the whole thing is when you have a one year old, you start thinking about potty training's coming down the line. I've been reading in a book about infant psychology that the way to lead into potty training is you come up with a word that signifies what's happening very early and you don't make a big deal out of it. So when you say that he's pushing out one, because our son grunts went out today, he got on all fours and grunted went out. It was gnarly. And you're like, well what do we call that? Do we say, Hey, are you making a Kaka Booboo, booboo? Or we thought Megan Brown Brown since that's, but then you think about him in school being like, teacher, I got to make a brown or mommy, I got to go make a brown. Actually thought today I realized if he can say dump, um, because I would love to hear a child, Yo, I got to take his job. Like it's cause it's not actually crude. It's not a curse. No. Yeah, I have to dump. I have to take, or do we teach them the whole phrase?

Speaker 6:          00:18:01       Yeah. Teacher, I gotta take a dump, excuse me. And he's like, I'm going to dump right now if I don't get to a toilet, here's what's going to make us laugh more. Because you have to think about how long it's going to take to toilet. Train takes months. Oh dump would make me laugh. Brown's also fun. Yeah. I got to make Brown and then we can teach them brown and yellow. Do you have to make yellow too or Brown? Is it yellow and Brown? Yeah. Now we go with dump. He talking about this size. I had a big dump. Right then what do we go with for PG? Do we say then like peachy. Peachy? Yeah. Yeah I dunno. It's interesting. That's Hungarian too. Well you say peachy.

Speaker 6:          00:18:57       Peachy only the same say in Hungarian. I like, well it's for Nina for me right now I've, I've narrowed it down to making a brown. I got to make Brown. Yeah or taking you down. It's funny making Brown is one of those that he can get away with it more because he's so small that people won't think that it's us teaching. Also figure out like it's going to be an extra beat cause no one else will say it, right? Like Brown, Brown. And they're like, oh, okay. By the way, this was saying, you know, make a brown dad. I haven't make a brown. I gotta make a brand. My Dad, I'm done. Browning come white meat. Wow. That's going to be fun. I can't wait for him to start saying this kind of stuff. Do you know, um, well, glass was quest. Let's go. Somebody sent this, uh, this video is a Hungarian guy. Oh, I saw that. I was watching him watch it part. It's really colorful. Is it? Will you explain what's going on? I'm trying, I'm trying to wrap my brain around how hateful it shit is. Is it really bad? Yeah. Okay. Well, a lot of the stuff you hear Your Dad, my dad sang and Hungarian growing up like this one.

Speaker 8:          00:20:20       Where's he, those are immigrants that he's running. They're called the tig and are Gypsies. He's

Speaker 6:          00:20:35       right. So there's like, these are refugees and cheese and he's a, he's a hung go. Yeah. What was he saying back there? Well, he's saying, you know, core devine. Yeah, I'd get the fuck out of my, he was actually trying to teach and he's trying to hit them. Yup. Yup. Well they'll secret some Hungarians are very racist. Yeah. I wonder if just a little,

Speaker 8:          00:21:00       they have travel. Travel

Speaker 6:          00:21:09       did play it again. I thought he said Midland Mamane. Oh, he's saying,

Speaker 8:          00:21:16       yeah. I don't know that word that he's saying

Speaker 6:          00:21:30       or some immigrant, I'm sure. But yes. But I don't know if that's a Hungarian word. A Latin or whatever. They are like, he's

Speaker 8:          00:21:40       here. Here's the children. Hello. So he's being a douchebag. Samar star. It's like sarcastic

Speaker 8:          00:22:01       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:22:10       The reading this for them. For the listeners. What? Yeah, we should, sorry guys. I mean, we're just reading it. Yeah. So there's a Hungarian driver, I think it's one of those dash cams and there's these immigrants and he's screaming like a, your wives pick up guns and fight isis. You just fuck around you. Filthy dogs. Parasite dickheads. Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. I was just like, I'm, I'm enraptured by this man's level of hate.

Speaker 8:          00:22:38       You fuck around. If you felt the dogs,

Speaker 6:          00:22:45       there's a lot of people walking on the highway. Yeah. This is usually, I've only seen in the Middle East. I've actually never seen this in Hungary, so it says it's in France. Oh, trucker Ramsar refugees. Geez. I didn't know people walk on the highway in France.

Speaker 8:          00:22:59       Yeah. Muscle build up.

Speaker 6:          00:23:02       He definitely has your fucking musical tastes too. I liked it. All this racism is through a dance like house music due to the dude

Speaker 8:          00:23:12       your address

Speaker 6:          00:23:14       fighting against terrorist with machine guns rotten, but I dunno.

Speaker 8:          00:23:24       It is insane. Those plastic craps on the road.

Speaker 6:          00:23:38       It's not necessary now because this truck jam is six

Speaker 8:          00:23:42       diagonal showing up on the IGA

Speaker 6:          00:23:45       translate. Really what it is is the immigrants are filthy. They make trash. They're horrible. They ruin everything. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:23:56       That's a gay session. Falash one bossman compulsive hair type person. There's so many people walking and they're like, I think trying to climb on the back.

Speaker 6:          00:24:15       I think we're trying to hitch rides. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:24:19       Oh my God. Come down from there. Come down from there.

Speaker 6:          00:24:31       He is behind me. Oh. So one of them jumped on his trucks

Speaker 8:          00:24:37       classic off the tractor and the trailer.

Speaker 6:          00:24:44       I liked the beginning. I was like, I'll go to the highway. I know what this is terrible. This poor, these poor people. Fuck man. Well that's good to know. You know, the Hungarians are super sweet and just really welcoming energy. You know, kind of have that rep in Europe. Yeah. A lot of anti immigrant policies. They don't like Albanians. They don't like to guidance. They don't like Gypsies. They call them Gypsies. They don't, they don't like anybody. That's not Hungarian. Not, I shouldn't say everybody, but slot. Yeah. Don't, don't like gays so much either. It's your tribe. I know.

Speaker 6:          00:25:28       Speaking of tribe, I got an email from a guy about, um, I fucked up on that crumpets thing. Um, this guy's Ronan from Austria and, and he's right. I fucked it up. The Guy I was thinking of, it's named a Sverre to Pete. Which guy you're talking about? Um, these European, why was Santa Claus white is what we're talking about. And I was like, oh, maybe because he's a Nordic st or whatever. So this guy from Austria wrote in and said that, no. So Saint Nicholas is actually from Turkey, so he may have been darker skin. Yeah. And then in the u s I think there were like caricatures drawn of him in the 18 hundreds that drew him white in the US, which is probably why we came to adapt to learn. My cousin who listened to I think a PBS thing that the modern day depiction of Santa Claus as in the fat guy in the red suit from a Coca Cola ad campaign in 1938 wow.

Speaker 6:          00:26:27       So before that he had been depicted as thin and just, you know, normal like whatever was Saint Nicholas is thin because I'm hungry. It's like a modern depiction of the fat guy in the red suit was in line with a Coca Cola. Interesting, isn't it? That advertising how we see it like a saint by the way, he's the same speed. The same. Yeah. And so also, so the, the black guy that I saw in Amsterdam, right ride toy, that they're like chocolates of him and everything. It's not [inaudible], it's the black guy is called severity Pete. And it's like Sanchez homeboy is what that is. It's like his companion and he's a more from Spain, which is why he's so Daro. The more, the more. So there's that and yeah, I've totally, I'm sure it's totally racist, right? It's fucking probably calling now. Um, okay. So then it's in November six St Nikolaj comes to your house.

Speaker 6:          00:27:17       Remember I told you this and you'll leave your shoes out. This isn't hungry. It's November six. And if you're good, you get candy and toys and your shoes. And if you're bad, then the devil comes. And that's named crumpets in Austria and some other countries, but I don't know what the fuck they call it a hungry and they put culinary shoes and then they hit you with a branches and sticks because you're a bad kid. And your parents tell the guy in the village who dresses up like the devil, the common hate. You and my uncle got hit a few years in a row. Yeah. Yeah. And then on, no, no. December 24th Christmas Eve. It's baby baby A's. Wishkah who brings you toys? Not Santa's. Oh really? Yeah. So the 24th is our Christmas and baby Jesus brings you twice. You hear it's different. Yeah. I know American holidays. Most Americans do it where you know the kid for the whole month is told, you know, saying it's coming soon is coming.

Speaker 6:          00:28:10       Yeah. You know, you meet him at a mall, he's just on break. How do you justify the mall? How do we explain that it's traveling? Dude is the only, he's only in town today and then he goes back to the North Pole and then on the 24th most American kids are taught that he's out now. Toliver world to gifts. Yeah. They look out in the sky. You see up there? Oh yeah. You see him up there. He's going to fly all over the world. So that's why you leave out the cookies in the milk. You do all that shit. And then he's supposed to come down the chimney the night of Christmas Eve so that when you wake up Christmas Day, the treats, the treats are there. Yeah, I know 24th and my house was Christmas, but he, my dad didn't tell me yeas which got brought it. It's Santa like just came on the 24th.

Speaker 6:          00:28:55       So we kind of meshed those two holidays. Yeah. And uh, we go, he'd be like, let's go for a drive and look for Santa. And then he'd be like, I forgot something. And then he'd run back in and put all the gifts out and then we come back for a long drive. You to figure out like 15, like 16 yeah. Yeah. How long did you, how long did you hold out for? I think by third grade there was a Jewish kid in our class, Eric Friedman, and he told all of us, he's like, Whoa, whoa. I went to a Christian school too. And he was like, guys, the Santa thing's not real. I saw the presence in my parent's closet and we were like, what? Who Ha? Who ruined it for you? Who Ruin it for me. I think, I don't remember. I really don't remember how it was ruined.

Speaker 3:          00:29:43       Um, probably Maria. Probably Maria. Yeah. Like, oh my God, he's such a kid. Um, guys, I didn't know what I do remember. It was one time Christmas Eve, she goes, I saw him standing out the window and I looked out the window. I didn't see anything. So I said that I saw him too when he was like, I saw my parents were like, really? And she was like, yeah, she didn't talk like that that you did. And I go, I saw him too. I was so upset that she saw him. Corey, he's lying. He's a liar. Liar face. And now here's what I couldn't imagine as a kid is being forced to sleep on the most exciting night. That was a thing too because the older the kids get, you know, a young kid you can just, you know, the kids passed out. But when you start to get a little older you can fight those incidents.

Speaker 3:          00:30:35       Yeah. So did you stay up till like I would stay up till four in the morning looking for him. I couldn't, I wouldn't be able to sleep. Yeah. Did you sleep? I um, I mean I remember crashing pretty hard, you know. I also remember actually when I finally knew what was up, having fun playing that game to my younger sister. Yeah. Like being in on it because it's fun. It is fun to do. Yeah. So we, we kept her. Sure. We tortured her for a few more years. How's it can be fine next year when Elis gets it a little more. Yeah. This year he doesn't know what's going on. Yeah. I liked that photo. We got out of, um, my, my niece, our niece crying eight months old, just terrified of Santa Cruz is like, they always are. At that day. We didn't take our son to meet Santa yet cause it was that new fucking Kylie. Well some stupid store. It popped up in our neurons are our mall here and it was just swamped with people. Yeah. And we couldn't even get in line for Santos. Too many people. Way Too many people. Lightweight too much. Yeah. I don't want to scare my kid. I'll, I'll wait till next year. Um, this, I know it was going to make you happy. So this is a from the Netflix.

Speaker 2:          00:31:45       This is a clip from Netflix. It's a toilet, toilet

Speaker 3:          00:31:50       and uh, in an apartment. I mean, how would you describe the toilet for our listeners and nightmare? Somebody made Brown a lot, you know, it's like the train spotting toilet. Yeah. It's pretty bad. Look at that whole area though. I wouldn't shit there. Even if I had really bad diarrhea. I don't think I would go there. Would you hold it? No, I don't like that. I don't like that shit outside. If I had diarrhea, I would go out of my living room before I shit there. Yup. Yup.

Speaker 2:          00:32:18       One more. One Hand. The toilet was all plugged. They said they haven't used it for a year, so I'm going to take this up and try to unplug it, see if there's something stuck in it or anything. It's called, here comes your lunch. And Mikey,

Speaker 3:          00:32:33       he stuffs it in the time

Speaker 3:          00:32:43       Yeah. Or they said these people said they, they didn't use the toilet for years. So why would you, why would you not? You know, how are you just going to neglect the whole a toilet for a year? I'd say that's priority in the house at the toilet's not working. Yeah. You should probably call. It's kind of a day one phone call. Right? Day Two at the latest. I'd say minute one. Yeah. Hey, the toilet's broken and all. He's gonna do his snake, that thing. So what? You know what I mean? You're paying to guide is to snake it. Well, let's see where it goes.

This new thing called hydration. I get it. You're, it's another level. I get it. Here's what happened, and this is also look at the toilet. I went to her talking spa. Had a massage. Yeah. Oh, stop at the story. God, why do you drink a lot of water?

Speaker 6:          00:37:25       I turned and I was like, yeah, it's pretty well known and she goes, your muscles feel very hydrated. I swear on our son's life. Look in this Iraj well that's what happened. I can't roll my eyes far back enough and my hand goes, you should just keep that up. I know. You know it was a real water champ at the House that we don't talk about is bitsy dog drinks. So much volume of water. Yorkie sips. She drinks out of her slipper in the crate and she empties it daily. I have to refill it and I'm not exaggerating every two days. Yeah. Otherwise. And you know who's not the water champ. Fif No drinking water. The other big time water champ though is our son, two pounds sippy cups because he's related to me. He's just trying to like give it to them in the morning. He goes boop. And then when he puts it down, it's down. I'm like, Holy Shit Man. My son, he kicks off his day like that. Just like his dad

Speaker 1:          00:38:24       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:38:39       wear a mask, you know it's going to smell.

Speaker 6:          00:38:44       That was fantastic. I think we have to get into the show. I know you don't call your ta provider to get the super today. And I think someone said they got it on Netflix. Uber off. You know it's going to stink. You know it's going to be dirty. Where I'm asking where your gloves.

Speaker 5:          00:38:59       Well, we are the shittiest show. You told me earlier that um, Hitler, Hitler Guy, let me a refresh everybody's memory of what, uh, an enthusiastic fellow. This guy is, uh, this guy here

Speaker 4:          00:39:15       exercise. Okay. In your shoulder and after you've been mobilized, it is, you're going to be just some range of motion and the range of motion you do. It's just up to 140 degrees of flection, which is like how the Hitler.

Speaker 6:          00:39:29       Hmm. Um, you, you said, you know who this guy reminds me of the Evie. Micah. Just how boring those two are. God, those two bores. And if you don't remember any, my guy, this is him, 33,000 views now. This was our blood is other views have like a thousand videos. Kevin writes, Hey Rick, thanks for the great programs. I'm really learning a lot. I'm thinking about buying an Ori Three 20 for my studio and live shows. Thanks so much for asking which take a look at how the capsule is very, here we go. Here I have no you already 20 and the three 20 as you can see they're quite different. You already three 20 uses the same capsule design is in the Ari 27 and d each had Barry will de fe sports do you already? 20 zero external twenties are integrated into the capital structure. Theory 20 uses a standard gas magnet to create a synergy, uses a neodymium magnet to create a scope three 20 we'll have a brighter and higher output. The Ori 20 sensitivity is 1.5 millivolts per pascal and the Ori Three 20 says 2.5 mommies and they both have humbucker coil. Microphone is best for farts and burps. The Ori Twenties is an enclosed throw non binary lines of the abdomen and the already have about his variable d explained video.

Speaker 6:          00:41:00       Yeah, Mike Guy. Thanks for watching. Reading through our viewer mail and came across this one. Virginia we can ramp

Speaker 6:          00:41:11       writes. Hey Rick, I love you series in my Ed Mike's. I keep seeing variable d mentioned in some product specs, but I'm not really clear on what it is or what it does. Help me out please down. Sure. Brent, that's a great question and thanks so much for asking. I want to know variable d is an exclusive ed teacher found on our Ari, Ari, Ari 27 d and r e three 20 premium mix. The quick answer is that it's a magical technology that stabilizes the Mikes tonal performance throughout an extended working distance. Yeah, there's a lot more to it than just that. Now to know more. First thing about polar patterns. Okay. If the core element of any Mike is fixed in the front of the element is exposed, right? You'll be the direction with the character sounds arriving from all direction. Got It. So Mike, yeah, that's what we want. He's so into this, which is that exaggerated bass response you hear when you get right up on the mic. Got It. Had proximity effect in cardio or just do it in some situations. Proxy queuing that I've done to these mix all three of the world show you, um, uh, they're flat, there's no additional Sweden.

Speaker 3:          00:42:14       And then, um, this, uh, so anyways, that's the evening Micah boring video in the world. Um, you know what, this reminds me of marching him. Hmm. Being in high school and trying to take chemistry. Oh yeah. Well you're just like chemistry and physics. I got big solid ds and ds. I dropped out of chemistry. That's how stupid. I was like, nope. One of my, my physics teacher had like chemistry, chemistry teacher. He liked me so much, like on a personal level and he was just like, basically he talked to me about one time. He goes like, are you retarded? Because I, I just, it was like this, it was like the cardioid actually, it's a covalent

Speaker 6:          00:42:58       bond. Oh my God. I'm ready.

Speaker 8:          00:43:03       Hi Baby. I love him. Oh my God. This is, um, lady money made. This is the Evie Mike Song Guy made a song TV. Evie, my guy, Steve. You, Micah. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.

Speaker 3:          00:43:51       Poor guy. I know he's just doing his thing. He knows someone

Speaker 6:          00:43:54       march about microphone. So now this is a cardioid dynamic like, and I'm going to get my lip right up on it. Now I'm directly in front of the mic with my lip is touching the grill and a, you hear what it sounds like. Now I'm going to come out about three inches on three inches authentic on axis, three inches off axis. When you go other side, three inches off actions. No, that's six inches off at six inches on axis, six inches off axis. I'm out to about 10 inches off as I back off of the mic.

Speaker 3:          00:44:25       Jesus Christ. Do you think Mike, the Mike Guy, do you think that sits in a chair with his legs spread open and boxer shorts and farts in front of his wife and son? Maybe into microphones. We've got to find out which microphone is the best to pick up farts, which is the best part. Like, Hey, this is a call to Rick. The Mica is the best part. Mike, if we wanted to set up a couple of Fart, Mike's in our studio, should we get a cardioid mic? Something with Variable d please, please let us know. And very important. Can you make a video? Can someone email him that question? So it's in his inbox, which is the best fart Mike, he's um, he's a good guy. This guy, I think he's a nice guy. Oh yeah, yeah, definitely a good person. Yup. Probably nice to his wife.

Speaker 3:          00:45:23       Probably does. What is your thing? Nice isn't push farts out and smile at her or stuff like that. You did give me a lot of head scratches last night. I'm very thankful for us, so thank you for that. We in our household, I make Tom buy me things for eating dog food and memory bought me the ring, but I also, my other currency is head scratches. Every time I ask for something you go, how many head scratches am I going to get? But you did. You should be more thankful. All you tell me you go, I woke up today and there was a lot of knots in my hair. Why don't you go like extra tank? You, I love you. I did. I did. No, you're like, good job, good job. But you get one a day. That's how it goes in this house. That was one good job a day.

Speaker 3:          00:46:06       That's true. You can't just keep giving him out and increasing your self esteem. Yeah, that's true. Good job. Good job. My Dad and his brother came over for Christmas on Christmas Eve and what did you think? Did you have fun? I enjoyed them actually. I really had a good time. I really respect. I think I told you this, that what your uncle went to learn a language and went to learn Spanish and he went, he did the program where you live with a family and he's like 70 years old. How cool is that? Actually, when he was telling me about it, I was like, man, I hope when I'm 70 I have that sense of adventure and you know what the best part is is that as my uncle was telling us about his experience in Nicaragua, my father's eyes couldn't roll far enough back into his head.

Speaker 3:          00:46:55       It was so funny. Really funny to him. My Dad's just like, come on man, this is fucking bullshit. Your, your, your uncle was sitting in the kitchen obstructing the walkway and Jack was get the fuck out of the way when he shoved the chair. I know my dad wore his Christmas track suit. It was a Ferrari tracksuit and he made no Kelly for the chicken Paprika. I should just really nice then to do, you posted a photo of him so he only side of his head. I should post a better one of him. I will eventually. Uh, but it's crazy to watch my, my dad

Speaker 6:          00:47:30       and my uncle now as, as a four year old woman with a kid and you're like, oh, I fucking grew up with that. Like these guys are, they're just so different world. Right? Like I feel like they didn't have it. Another universe. Oh, they're animals. Three animals are savages. Yeah. My Dad told me, he goes, Oh yeah, maneuver a Ellis his age. I one time I was cutting films together and you ate a piece of film and I go, did you call the doctor? He goes, no, we just waited a little bit.

Speaker 5:          00:48:00       That's it. Didn't call it then what? I just shut it out, I guess you're fine. You're fine. Uh, swallowed fucking cleaning solution.

Speaker 6:          00:48:11       Oh yeah. Swag it off. Yeah. Um, I think the, well my, the highlight of the dinner was that we got to talk shit about my ex step mom's cooking. That was actually really fun. And you really liked that part?

Speaker 5:          00:48:22       Yes. Because I, um, here's the thing. So you know, when you date somebody from a culture you hadn't been exposed to before, you know all your impressions and opinions about something and become specific to like what that person teaches you. Right. When we started dating, I don't even know if I had met someone who said they were Hungarian before. Right. And then, you know, you introduced me to a Hungarian traditions and obviously food is like the, you know, the big part of a culture. You know, if you start dating a Dominican person, they're going to cook specific meals and be like, this is what we eat. And same thing goes for anywhere, you know, German, a Peruvian, anything. So you, the, the big, you know, the flagship meal among Hungarians is, uh, basically chicken poppy. Gosh, that's, that's, you know, that's, that's the signature dish.

Speaker 5:          00:49:12       Yeah. Yeah. But I was only exposed to your, it's now I love yours. I always laugh, but I'm saying I didn't know what to expect. Like it, it's the only thing I have exposure to. So when you go like, oh, now we, the first time we went over to your, your dad's, when he was with your stepmom and you go, she's making shipping public hush. And I was like, Oh shit. Yeah. Because it, not only did I go do I love this dish. Yeah. But now I'm, I'm going to eat it from an off the boat hunger. Right. She's, she's from the old country. Yeah. It's going to be like him over 20 or 30 or something. Right? Yeah. So I was like, this is going to be off the charts. Yeah. It was

Speaker 6:          00:49:48       dog shit, dog sharable. I hated her food. I hate those hook land. Terrible. That whole dinner was terrible. Terrible. And there's no flavor in any of the stuff. She had no flavor, no love in her food,

Speaker 5:          00:50:01       just like, but the alarming thing to me was that even that they're split. See sometimes you know, people divorce. So they split up and then they go. And how about the fuckers cooking? Yeah, I had to live with that. We're having chicken poppy. Gosh. And your dad goes, you know who's a cause you were talking about your grandmother. Yeah. When you're like, you made a good one. Yeah. And he was right. He was saying he didn't care for it,

Speaker 6:          00:50:23       which is crazy because my Nana is, was the vest my, she was an e, like a terrible human. Yeah. But her food was really good. Sure. But anyways, that comes about. He hates his mother's, you love, you love it. And then he goes, I'll tell you who's was good. Yeah. Is x disgusting. And I couldn't because it was one of the things that I've held onto for like 10 years was, you know, I mean, I told you obviously, but I felt comfortable because they've been divorced for a while now. I go, I got to tell you I didn't like that. And he was like, really? I was like, no, I didn't like is it feel liberating to talk shit about the former step parent? Oh my God. I hated her food because I was to the point where it stood out to me. How bad it can.

Speaker 6:          00:51:13       I tell you other shit that she messed up like some, I'm not saying all her stuff was bad. There's some dishes she was really good at, but her stuffing dude, she used to, you know like the bag entered so that they give you, I know some people put them in there stuffing, but hers were like hardened giblets so it was like you'd be eating like awesome stuffing and then they'd be like hardened, I don't know, appendix or whatever. Acute like a cooking type. No shame. Like no loving, nurturing now. Damn. It felt good to tell him, oh my God. I also wanted to go like, why are you acting like that was good because his is terrible too. So my dad's so chicken public, gosh, it's just pepper, Paprika, onion, garlic. It's red chicken dude. It's not, it's a steal. It's a stew and all he does is put the chicken in there, some garlic and then Paprika.

Speaker 6:          00:52:05       Right public on there. And then it's just oil and then it just looks, it's oily, greasy cause the chicken juice and that's it. No, it's disgusting. Yeah. It's just Greece. Yours is the dog's minds to vest. You know why? Cause I got it from uh, this girl woman named Mcgee. M. E. G. D. I think she's on the Internet. And you guys can Google Mug these recipes. I have a book that she gave me years ago, but I know she puts out line pasta. Yeah. Cause the, no, Kelly's hard to make all my dad did that. Dumplings. Yeah. Good. Yeah, I like that too. That's my death row meal. I could eat that every day. Oh yeah. And Sour cream. Sour cream on everything. Fuck man. She could share. That's one of those meals to wear. So if you've never had it, you know, somebody who just is, you're like, what is all that?

Speaker 6:          00:52:50       What is going on? It's a lot first bite. It's cause it's poor people food. It's poor people. And that's where people, Hungarian stuff is poor people. Stuff like [inaudible]. It's all, it's all stu is the same as me. Like NASA. Mila Nasssa, right. Which my father loves stammered. A fried piece of beef. Beaner Schnitzel. Same thing. All the cultures fry. I think they fry the, it's the bad bits so that you can eat the bad bits. Taller fly. Same with stews. You can put anything in a stew and you know, we'll eat it kind of thing. I'm theorizing, I know you have these blue jeans.

Speaker 9:          00:53:26       Uh, can I get, um, uh, number four as a medium meal with peach sprite. Ooh. Peach spray a note. That'll be it. Okay, great. That a medium meal. Yeah. Right. Thanks. Lot.

Well, when the grilled one and then Halan and I used to have that when I was actually, you know, going there, I'm talking like 15 years ago and try and eat healthy. Get a grilled piece of chicken at you. Tell them nothing on it, but mustard. So you know that they're making it specific to you. Oh, smart. Or let us know two minute. And then I would just basically take the bun off and eat a piece of check. Wow. But that's a, that's that's a, uh, a move to make when you have no options. In other words, you're like, I'm starving or there's nothing around here are the to right late.

Speaker 5:          00:55:35       That's how I would go there. They have birth and salads now? Yeah, their fried chicken sandwich. You don't need the, the one that mattered. That's what I'm thinking. I'll eat the fuck out of that. Um, now the chicken that's on their chicken sandwiches, is it the same chicken that's in the nuggets? Like the poster mash shade. Chicken nuggets. Oh, all of it. I mean, one guy that worked at a fast food place told me never get anything but beef. Really? He said that beef the, he's like, if you saw where we're getting half the stuff, Ronnie goes at least beef, you know, he, he said it was better to get beef. Now when are you going to eat? When you,

Speaker 9:          00:56:10       hi, what can I get for Ya? Hi Mommy. I'll do venti iced coffee with milk and sugar and a Venti Mocha. Anything else? Nope, that's it. Eight 51. Okay. Thanks. Jeans.

She's like, you're welcome. Thank yeah. Well I think number one, the guy was like, Hey Jean, he heard Jean was my name. Yeah. Did you kept calling me jeans? It's hilarious. So what are you going to eat after the Diet? Let's talk about it for people that don't know, you know, the Bert, um, burnt Chrysler and I are in a weight loss contest and it's all about who weighs less essentially January 2nd and third is we're going to call it because the way it first, yeah, the first I fly back, I mean we could still win, but it's essentially going to be about January 2nd and third. And the reason we're doing back to back stuff like that is so that like if you did a big weight cut on the second, you know, you'd have to continue it for them. You have to do a two day wait. Cut. Yes. What you're saying, you'd have to dehydrate yourself. So actually like I think on the first we'll probably call in our ways like, hey, you know, maybe stand on the weight on the scale, take a take a picture and then you know, we go, okay, so now, now you know that you have to do with it for two more days. You have to weigh in.

Speaker 6:          01:00:00       It's yelling your mom. So he's starting to get fitness too.

Speaker 5:          01:00:04       Yeah. Well I've been a, I inspired him. He said when, when I saw him. Um, so dogs are really going on. What I know they're playing. What's your first meal? That's what I'm saying though, to tell people we're doing this big weight loss thing and I haven't fucked around in a while now. Like I haven't had many cheat meals or snacks. I mean, yeah. Even when you had those treats out on Christmas Eve, but you gotta try, I didn't even try it. He didn't try it. So I haven't had sugar starch. Any like real carbohydrates? No. Yeah, I get carbs from vegetables, but that's it. And um, no, I haven't had desserts. No treats, you know, none. I tell you, I think the thing, it's not hard to like, like, cause once you're focused on it you're like, yeah, I'm not having them that in that, I think what I really want to have is a waffle waffle.

Speaker 5:          01:00:53       What do you get on the waffle? I'm kind of a purist, you know, I like, I like a Belgian wall. Like a thicker, yeah, me too. I like real maple syrup. Yeah. No, I like aunt Jemima. Fake. I like it to be, have a little bit of crunch to it. Yeah. What I mean like, like a little bit, not burnt, but a little crunch. Um, and I'll, I'll even do something where like, I'll double up or I'll do the syrup and whipped cream. Oh, I like it like that. It's like a fucking cake. No fruit, no chocolate. I mean, I'll do that too. I'm not a, I'm not the biggest fan of fruit on, on pancakes and waffles. Right. You know, some people would think that's the big treat. To me it's not that appealing. Well, because fruit is like, it's good food. Well it's also, you're, you're wanting to be bad. I think it kind of takes away from the taste that that you're going for. In other words, I want the waffle syrup taste. The fruit then detracts from it. It doesn't really, it's not the thrill for me.

Speaker 6:          01:01:52       Now I know I brought this up to you probably a million times in the last 10 years, but we got to go to Belgium. Belgium. Yeah. That's spelled the M. Yup. Uh, to get a Belgian waffle. You've told me this. Yeah. Yeah. You will. I kind of want to fly there just for this and do it because you will shut your pants. How much better those waffles are than the American shit you have here. Yeah. Cause there though, their waffles are like really thick, crunchy and you get them on the street and the streets just smell that wonderful waffle

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       smell. No. Oh my God. Go to remind some other people. Let's see.

Speaker 13:         01:02:25       MMM.

So I have to buy tickets. Air Superbowl. It's expensive. Yeah, it's very expensive to go to. Um, so that'd be February 5th. And I also, if I lose, I have to shave my beard, which is such a hassle to hassle. I mean, I like having a beard, but he just had Allen trim it up. It's going to be so annoying. It's going to suck if he loses. I chose, I want it because it was about go to a sporting event. I've never seen Barcelona play soccer and they're like, you know, they're like the 96 Chicago Bulls. They are superstars. I decided I want to go see Barcelona play Paris, um, in this like, I think it's the one of the cup finals or some stage of it.

Speaker 5:          01:03:25       Um, February 14th, Valentine's Day, which we don't give a fuck about, so I'm fine with that. Thanks jeans. But, um, that means he has to take me to Paris. Great. And buy tickets to the game flight. And so to me, if he loses his shave his beard too. Oh my God. So we're going to see just how fat his face. Yeah. How long has he had that? He's always had a beard. No, he had a goatee for a long time. Oh, remember you don't remember? Yeah, I do. I do. I do remember. Oh Wow. That's exciting genes. So you love a football? Yeah. How exciting. That'll be fun.

They go to you, like you said, just looks like heroin around an asshole. Yeah. It makes your lips look like an asshole. Yeah. Yeah. Plus it cuts in the most unflattering place.

And then we looked up what it was, wait. And I had no idea of smart and final is like a grocery store still doesn't seem like a good name. You thought it was corporate, a corporate board set of a store that was like, yeah, you're smart for shopping here, but all sales are final. I thought it was like a final sales place. It was like essentially consulting their customers. Right? It's smart and final. No, like it's you're smart to shop here, but all sales are final because this is like a close out discount store. That's what I thought. Smart and final one is your last chance to get this item and then El Torito.

That's when he was a member of the tight jeans and the left. Yeah. Yeah. And he had the real, the [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          01:18:50       And I still remember women would lose their mind. I had a crush on him. My sister and Maria and her friends thought saw Ha's Sysa sets up by a lot. He was super high. And I was like, oh, that's what like, because in my mind, you know, at that age, my only idea of gay had to be a super feminine like that. So I couldn't comprehend. Yeah, I think most of us, not that I couldn't comprehend, it didn't occur to me. I was like, Oh that guy. But I think that's why we were so like a merit. We were so under there, we, he was so under the radar with us because we thought of gay dudes like Liberace was gay, exact, not George because George Michael, the women loved him. They loved, we all loved him. And so, and then his HBO had all the naked models.

Speaker 6:          01:19:34       Oh my God, that was the best one. They all said later like, Oh yeah, of course we all knew him. We all knew. You know, it's so funny cause back then being gay was such a big deal. Even when Liberace died, he died of AIDS and right. The couldn't even really say it. They didn't want to say it. So sad by the way. And I mean this sincerely. Rest in peace, George. My ground. It's very, it's very sad. He's 53 years old. So young. God, that's just fucking suck. We don't have many of our legends left. I think we have Madonna. Yeah, we have, uh,

Speaker 3:          01:20:07       is is uh, Boy George still alive? He is right. Yeah. As far as I know. Um, so this is apparently the United way. Do you remember Frankie goes to Hollywood, relax, don't do it. We didn't know he was gay either. Yeah. You want to come. He got away with saying that and it is Lou. Yeah. What you don't want to come because it used to be every fucking dad would play that. Yeah. In the car. I'd be like, well my dad and I let know Bob is Bob his head and then all of a sudden someone just tells you, Oh, do you know what this song's about? I Dunno. It was just real quick cause it's so good. That's the thing about catchy. Catchy. We'll lose you. Yeah. He made a hit song about busing nuts not busting that right? Yeah. I mean I bet most so Chris, you know, Middle America was like, oh it was such a cadre.

Speaker 3:          01:20:57       So relax, don't do it. It was a great song. And you get, wait when you want to stock to it or whatever. Why do you want to come? And he's all, and at the end he's all ah Hah, I need you Shira. Him, he fucking big ox at the end of the time. Sure. That was a little girl. Leah loved the song, the song. So those dudes were totally gay too. Yeah. There were just like the case and are like, would you ever want to marry your mom? So I was like, really good county. When did you marry your dad?

Speaker 17:         01:21:37       Oh, never easy. Um, it's something that, you know, as a team you just gotta Kinda, you know, I guess you want to take a breath and uh, you know, refocus and, you know, look back to what made us, you know, when those games

Speaker 3:          01:21:54       we're just going through, your nose is glass and he had some dip in his lip. He sure did. I used to ride her dip like that. Can't see you doing that. Yeah, I did. I don't like that. Really.

Speaker 17:         01:22:04       Yeah. Stay on the same level and, you know, get back to, you know, the simple things that, you know, made us win.

Speaker 3:          01:22:11       Okay.

Speaker 17:         01:22:11       Well I guess I haven't really paid attention, I guess enough. But you know, you always say like, you know, it's a score on the road and, you know, keep it simple and, you know, we should be doing that at home too. It's, uh, you know, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:22:23       Yeah.

Speaker 17:         01:22:23       I think it's just, you know, just for the whole team, it's just, you know, another, another guy that you know, brings, you know, leadership and you know, everything that she feels, you know, on the ice. He's a, you know, one of the hardest working guys. You know, a good center man. For us that's a, it means a lot. And just, you know, in every aspect of the room.

Vocal fry is when you do that, it's actually forced you, you don't do it naturally, but some people get so accustomed to talking like that, that they, um, you know, they talk like it all the time and it's prevalent amongst younger women to sound smarter. Like some of the Kardashians.

Speaker 7:          01:32:54       I'm Maureen Petrosky, I'm entertaining, expert

And they go like, oh, I'll go here. She does the exact opposite. She sees you and then steps in front of you in front of your feet. Slip on

Speaker 6:          01:34:58       her. I step on her. I'm always like, what the fuck are you doing? And she's like, ah, it's unnerving. And whenever the kid drops any morsel of food, anything Fitzy chews it up. Immediate doesn't choose feathers, plastic rocks, glass Christmas tree tree, and she barfed it right up.

Speaker 7:          01:35:32       I'm entertaining expert. Oh my God. These are perfect for cooking outdoors over the griller and open fire.

Speaker 6:          01:35:51       of how many calories is. I would think that a director would just be like, you need to stop talking like that when we were going to shoot this whole thing again, stop going by air. Sound like an idiot. Yeah, you did a really nice treat for your open fire would be to talk like a person. Just project. Cause what you're, you're, you're like intentional and kind of going down. You're right. It's intentional. It's lazy speed. Cause you're like, uh, it's like you just woke up. I'm just getting up man. So Lazy. So Lazy. Stop talking like that. You asshole. Oh there's more, there is more. Yes. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:36:31       Yeah. Don't have to stress out with last minute guest. Just look and see what you have and work.

Speaker 6:          01:36:35       No Shit. And the device

Speaker 7:          01:36:38       for me, I'm serving a Jack Daniel's single barrel. Select the barrel proof and also the Rye. So there's something for every taste. The batter,

Speaker 6:          01:36:46       the ride. You do hear that. The Barrow, it was ridiculous. She's a bad though. You know what, I think it might be okay, here's a theory because she

Speaker 7:          01:36:57       appetizers can be as easy as assembling some things from your pantry. It looks fancy but it's so easy

Speaker 6:          01:37:02       cause she's, she's actually talking really soft. Maybe cause that's an ADR. Meaning she had to go and record a voiceover. Maybe she's not used to being on a microphone and hearing yours cause it is louder than normal. So maybe it's just like being Tim and work with it. Oh our pantry pantry. That's bad. The really strong, the barrows way play the beginning of it. She got the Barrow and the Ry.

Speaker 7:          01:37:40       You don't have to stress out with last minute guest just and look and see what you have and work with it.

Speaker 6:          01:37:44       Oh stupid advice.

Speaker 7:          01:37:46       No Shit. I'm serving a Jack Daniel's single barrel. Select the barrel proof and also the Rye. So there's something high taste

Speaker 3:          01:37:55       a horrible. So we got oh funny youtube comment ready I, one of our videos about Steven Seagal. Oh yeah. So they sent us this. Who are these about us? Who are these two ass clowns? Exactly. They are playing the video of an interview conducted by someone else and interview, neither of them could ever hope to conduct themselves, even if they somehow did both would sit there silent as the grave, as Steven Seagal towered over them, reverberating the same answer as he did the real interviewer. Why? Because he is Steven Seagal and they are a couple of nobodies who hosted a no name talentless radio show that features talking about other people who have accomplished, seen and done more than they could ever hope to do. The entire premise of this video is ridiculous and I'm annoyed for even clicking on it. Oh, Steven Seagal could or could not be the biggest joke on the planet, but no matter what plant he is on, these two are far below him.

Speaker 3:          01:38:58       It's not even funny. Try getting a real show Bozos. Wow. So he's not even really at the end. It sounds like he's not defending weird, but just that we are below Stevens ago, so he needs to let us know. Thank you sir for letting us know and if I have any unexpected gas, uh, the Ra in there. Um, and then the, another comment was this is about you that big. It's like, I need to hear that that bitch was to throw up because the Stevens to Gaul.

Speaker 3:          01:39:49       I don't approve of it if I haven't read it. Oh, okay. I won't improve. Chris genes is a racist. Yup. Here we go. She said cowboys not diarrhea is the most racist thing mommy see us ever said when talking about Indians cowboy. Oh, right. No, no, that's wrong. I said diarrhea, not cowboy. Right. So if you're going to quote the joke, at least get it correct. That's not what I said, right. You were saying, yeah, it's uh, go ahead and so wait, where am I racist? Because that was the way you specify to which India and you were talking. Oh, okay. Thank you for pointing that out. Yeah. Maybe I could drank over I in the pantry pantry.

Speaker 5:          01:42:43       I want to address this. Uh, this is heartfelt. This really bothered me. The first round of glass and shirts that went out, I thought you were saying we're in Israel. I was like, I said, you're gonna tell me something. Put me on blast. No, call me a racist. Like that other person just did the first round of glass and shirts were below our standard. And it upset me greatly because we've worked really hard to establish a, um, you know, uh, a consistency where, you know, when you get a shirt from us, that is a certain level. And so now do I want to apologize. The people who got, everybody that has ordered one now, it's already been changed. It's been upgraded to a better shirt. We started working with a new company. They've done a fantastic job. So I'm not throwing them under the bus.

Speaker 5:          01:43:36       There was just a miscommunication when we placed this order because basically what happens is you get a design, you, you know, you email. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Order this quantity. Do this, do that. The previous of shirts had sold out. They sent me a thing. Do you want the same price for this? And in that we lost that it would be a quality difference. So it's super bummed me out. Um, I want to make it up to people that got the lower quality shirt and I've been trying to figure out a way to do it. One thing that I thought of was if you send an email, um, and maybe I'll set up a new email address for it, you know, so it's just for that, I'll do that. I'll set up a new email address for the next episode and I'll tell you what it is.

Speaker 5:          01:44:27       And if you have one of those first glass and shirts, that's a Gildan shirt, um, you're going to send an email to this address. It'll just confirm that, that you were, you ordered one and it was sent to you and then I'm going to send you a small makeup, a Freebie. Nice. Very good. That's what we're going to do. All right, so again, a hundred apologies if you've ordered, you know, if you're ordering now, it was restocked at a higher quality shirt and I apologize and we will make it up to you and we won't do anything like that again. There's that. Um, are you ready to go? Yeah. Your mom's house, podcast.com. Click on it. Shop around. Check it out. Come see a show. We love you. We'll see you next week. Buy Jeans.
