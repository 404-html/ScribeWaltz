Speaker 6:          00:03:15       I'm not talking to you. Why did you abandon this kid? What are you, do you want me to have a home? You want me to find it at home? You're not taking care of it. Don't you look at me like, what the fuck? I'm a drag. Take that Goddamn cat pajamas. I'll get as doesn't do it. Don't bring it to your mom's house.

Speaker 4:          00:03:47       You got the, uh, the cat lady here because Joey is a cat man. You know that he loves cats. I do know that. How many do you have? Seven. Seven. He's like, he's a cat whisperer. Like he really connects with cats. Yeah. I love my babies. Yeah. And this lady right here loves cats too. She's mad at this neighbor because she's saying that the neighbor is not taking care of the cat, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:04:12       I'm sorry. The middle with you. You're on my property bitching over things that are not of your concern. I get a fin because when she comes by your house, she obviously comes by your house and pisses you off. And I asked if that was the issue and it is he issue because you say that to me. Your goddamn kid. It's you. You're the one that said people should be responsible for your dog.

Speaker 4:          00:04:40       She's really upset. Yeah. She's saying that he's not taking care of this cat. This is how my mother used to yell at people like over really mundane shit. She be like, you'll fuck mother fuck ass. You fucking bitch the fucking, she hated cats. She would just come. I'm other people like that all the time. And she hated cats. There was one cat, uh, we live in an apartment complex. It used to piss on our, our doormat. And she waited for the cat to come and she kicked it. She would fucking open our door and she kicked it down the stairs. Jesus. No, it never came back, I guess. But then she'd find the owner and be like, Yo, mother Fucker, you're fucking cat pcs or low one of my fucking door. You fucking Cock sucker Gaga. Gaga.

Speaker 1:          00:05:15       Oh my God. No plane. No gain. No plane. No gain.

Speaker 4:          00:05:22       Yeah. Yeah. Well, what'd you do, Joey? Does your cat wander and other people's yards?

Speaker 1:          00:05:26       No, they'll let them out of the house. Oh, they're strictly house. I can't sleep at night knowing my little Fox or outside. Yeah. Getting attacked by a rack cooling or something like that.

Speaker 4:          00:05:36       Was it a, was it a like a thing for your wife to get used to like, or was she already in the cats too?

Speaker 1:          00:05:43       In other words, now we want to were together. She had a kitten. That was it. That was when I first started dating and she had a kid. And did you have a cat already? Thick. Oh, okay. Like cats. I don't even know. Really? Yeah. I didn't know have any idea. And then when, where we lived Hollywood, there was a lot of cats and they would die in the backyard. So I would wake up in the morning, it'd be three dead kittens. So we started saving them and call them different organizations and they'd pick them up and feed them. Oh, I didn't know how you got into it. Yeah, the one by one I started bringing them upstairs and they became middle. Somebody would go, I'm moving in a month I want, because it was Siamese. There was gorgeous, and they go on removing save me one. Then they call me back and go, well, my roommate has an elephant, so no, I can't have a cat.

Speaker 1:          00:06:29       So I get stuck at the fucking cat. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I let stuck with [inaudible] loving them. At one time I found homes for four of them, five of them. How would you find homes? Different people, different girls, guys, acting classes, whatever. And then I moved to the valley with six and I moved to the valley and there was one that started hanging around the house just hanging out with me at night. I would get home from the store and whistle and it would fucking come to me. If I would walk down the corner, it would follow me. Yeah, and the owner came through when, then she goes, I can't control her, but obviously you can. She pays attention to you and she got attacked by a possum and she couldn't staff side no more. So just said, just take her. Wow. She's one of my best cat.

Speaker 4:          00:07:19       It's so funny to me like, and I don't know why it's like this. Maybe it's like this to other people. Cats to me or just, it's not that I have any issue with them. They're like a foreign language to me. You know what I mean? Like I, I don't know how to gauge cats. I don't know what to expect from because I never grew up with them. I've never spent time with cats, so like to me like a dog feels familiar. Yeah. I kind of, I kind of know what to expect from a dog. I know how to approach a dog. I know, you know, I know dog behavior pretty much like having grown up with dogs with cats, I'm always like, I don't know what what I was supposed to do because it's all their rules. I feel like. Yeah, they got to tell you it's that they tell you what's up, right. You tell a dog what's up and cat world, they have to choose you. Like what joy was saying like that cat shows Joey. Yeah. And respect him and then they do, they pick a person. What's interesting is that it came to him later in life. Like I would have thought that he was like growing up with cats. No, but you just figured cats out like way later a friend. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:08:13       Growing up had a cat. Yeah. That was a fucking guy. He was a warrior. He was missing and here he was missing half his foot. His name was frisky. And I still remember one particular morning when, you know, when you get fucked up at your friend's house and you wake up the next day and you were on the floor. Yeah. Like I woke up and the window was open and we were freezing and he was in the window watching a bird in the tree. Like making that fucking noise. Yeah. I never heard that noise. I hadn't ever seen it where the cat sees an animal vets, he's about to attack. He'll make weird,

Speaker 4:          00:08:52       hey, hell yeah. Don't

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       make little weird noises. Yeah. And an hour later we got the mother made us all breakfast and gave us a lecture on why not to drink and you know, look what the would look, what's going to happen with you guys and if forget Christina opening the door. That bird was in shambles. Like he brought it to us as a gift. Then the mother explained, she's like, I don't know what he's going to bring. He shows up with fucking dead cats, birds, squirrels. Killer man. I liked him. Yeah, he wasn't mine. But I liked him and that was my only experience with cats. And then 30 years later you go to people's homes to have a cat. The cat jumps on you, they show you affection, so they call you, you get scared and you push them off. Yeah, that's, that's part of the fear that I had.

Speaker 1:          00:09:47       Yeah. Yeah. Then it's weird once you save the cat, they remember that they, they, they, they remember everything. I used to have a friend that goes, I'll fuck with cats because they're going to go to bed and they write it down and they get you later. They write it down. It's really weird. I was going through a weird time in my life and these cats would come into the house at the time. We both needed each other like it was the weirdest thing. Yeah. And when I come home at night and doing comedy, they're scattered. But once I go to the office and I make my notes about my sat and what I got to do the next day, once I go into the living room and unwind, they come out one by one and I got to give them all attention and talk to them and ask them what's going on with Dan World and seven, some of them don't come out.

Speaker 1:          00:10:35       Two of them. You, you'll never see the two girls. Yeah. Lou Levy. Evie lives by the door. So I touched her and touch her in the way in and out. That's my good luck charm. She lives by the door. She watches that fucking door. I wonder if I would just go into fits of sneezing and like, and weeping if I walked into your place because I have like, no, I brushed him. I really keep the gander, the dander down. Yeah. You know, I've been around cats where, um, I slept at a place, uh, in a friend's place. I crashed with her for like six weeks, uh, just out of college and he had two little cats and like my eyes would just start to, you know, water and I would just, I dunno, I mean I never, like I said, that was my first exposure and then they would chase each other in the morning and they would like run over my face as they're chasing.

Speaker 1:          00:11:25       So I'd have like cat scratches on my forehead. Like right now you guys have dogs and a child, you have to have the things that bring you the most love. You know, you just went to Toledo, Ohio, it fucking snowed Saturday, you were expected to sell out, but then you get to the airport and the flight was delayed and then Thompson grow. His flight is delayed and he was supposed to go to Burke crisis. Birthday party. Yeah. You get home and your, and your luggage is lost. And now the Uber drive race showing up and you walk in your door and, and you gotta take a shit and you have do all these things. But that dog comes up to you that first you really want to kick that dog. Yeah. At first you want to go, you know what? Do me a favor, get the fuck away from me.

Speaker 1:          00:12:11       What? He does not understand. No, he just wants to give you this election. Yeah. I tell you something when you bend over and just pat them. Yeah. All of those problems you had that morning and you're a human being. Yeah. They just disappear. That's true. That's absolutely true. Just go away for five minutes and you pick them up and you pat them and they look at you and the five minutes. Yeah, Tom's delayed. Right. We're not going to make birthday party, but it all seems a lot better. It's 100% true. It really even when your child, sometimes you come home, you didn't get the audition, they gave it to somebody else and you pick up your kid and you go, who gives a fuck? Of course I don't give a fuck of Ralph's blows up right now. Yeah. I don't give a fuck. I got my kid. Yeah. It's 60 minutes is on. I know. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:12:59       As well. We're both, we're both, uh, three of us are all prefer to be home. I think the three of us are like just get, get home yet our animals and play with our kids and watch TV. My happiest time in life, my happiest moment of the day is when we put the baby down. He's had a great day. He's in his crib. He just fell asleep. Tom and I are laying in bed with the two dogs and we're watching some stupid show. Yeah. That's my, that's why I live. Yeah. Everything else is like, man, I know. It's almost like you live the day to get to that model. No, it's really like you can, I feel like the, I can feel that clock counting down to that moment later in the day when it's 30 minutes away. I'm like, oh, we're going to be in bed doing our thing with dogs watching TV pretty soon. Pretty excited. We have three. We have to it too.

Speaker 1:          00:13:49       Yeah. It's funny how, uh, you know, we all became as comics and when you become a comic, you know, like right now me and Tom lost a lot of weight because when you become a comedian you put all your focus into becoming a comedian. Yeah. I'll figure it onion rings at the bar and you'll eat. Yeah. On your rings, you go back to the hotel room. Doritos. Yeah. It's so weird how we've evolved as Comedians, but at the same time now you're like family, like led Zeppelin was great, awesome legs up with the fifth Albert, he started spitting out kids. Yeah, the toys got delayed. Yeah. And you know, cause you said going, wait a second, I got to go on the road and do what? I'd much rather just play on the fucking floor with this child. Of course. Whatever the fuck it is. It's a,

Speaker 4:          00:14:39       yeah, no man, I know it's a being home is, it's like it's the goal now. Like you just try to design your life to be at home as much as you can because the first fucking 10 years you live on the road.

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       Yeah. It's horrible. I mean, my goal is to just not, first of all, to not wear decent pants. Like I always want to be in sweatpants, number one. Like that's the whole dream. And then to be home I like to do as little as possible. That's the whole goal for me. Like I want to retire at 50 have a fucking dog. Oh, he's had a really big respect for you as a woman. Comics. I didn't want to say woman comic is a comic because when you were around me, I didn't feel like I had to act really differently, you know? Yeah. So I was very concerned about you when you had your child, you know, I'm so glad you're bringing this up. I was very concerned about you and your career affect. Tom And I had a conversation on a plane that I said to him, how's Christine handling this?

Speaker 1:          00:15:35       Because I have friends like Joe Rogan that they'd give a fuck about the Mars and if the world is flat and look at this animal and I could give a fuck about that. I love, I love the mind and love psychology and I love to see the change of people. Nobody, nobody, nobody changed more than my redneck. You know, my wife present work. My wife was one of those people. That job was eight to five. That's on paper and her world, it's seven to when the job gets done. You know, my wife is one of those people that, you know, you took a job. Yeah, you took it for $10 an hour. You got to do the work. Yeah, you don't like it. Quit. But why are you making a commitment? There are Americans that people that my wife had no days off and 10 years as an accountant, she never took a sick day.

Speaker 1:          00:16:28       Never took a personal day. She took three hours one time when I was doing coke because I got like an 18 grand trek and she wanted to make sure the check made it to the bank and not like coke dealers house. It was one of the biggest checks I've ever got ever for residual. She left. You took a train, you know when my wife had the baby and my wife said, I'll be there in five minutes to help you cash that check and they'll put it in the proper. That was the only time in 10 years at the op, at the Walt, the center, she had the child, she had all this sick time. She had all this paternity time. It was like five months and I could see her going through paperwork at night, Gung Ho about it, and then she got to go back to work and I tried to help her.

Speaker 1:          00:17:17       I tried to, you know, what do I cook? Hamburger help. Yeah, I know how to make hamburger helper, but Joe, y'all are cocoa chicken. All the cocoa chicken cutlets with lemon and pepper and the jelly specialties. I know three recipes. I think everybody only knows three. When I saw my wife go from 40 hours a week, this gun loving toadying American who believes in a dollar a day, you know a day's work for a day's pay. I saw cut her hours to 30 then 20 then 20 and then she came home one day. She goes, I'm just going to become a consultant. And I go, no, you're not. You're just not gonna work your 45 this is never ever going to happen again unless some miracle, God gives me another squirt of good nut juice you are in. We were lucky we got this little squeezing that juice out with all the marijuana.

Speaker 1:          00:18:12       I smoked and I saw her transformation. So I was always real interested in Christine's transformation. I was very interested in what she got pregnant and how she was gonna react to it. And you know, do you have the child and I, so now she doesn't work right wife. I tell him what's to use. Yeah, what it, she came home two weeks ago with some story about a I AFI and a firewall for the six figures and she'll put mercy at the Catholic school over there. And as we were driving one day go take a look at the one on one. Yeah. Is that what you want at your app? Is that what you wanted your rights wrapped up at five you got to pick up mercy and then drive her home and then, oh, guess who's cooking at six? Chef Diaz, chef boy dick. Cause I know how to make steak comes and or Ida French fries with American cheese on white bread to stake comes shit. Yeah, we all did white trash.

Speaker 1:          00:19:13       Your transformation was, and it's so weird how he's so funny. I love women that are Gung Ho and one day the uterus costs. Yeah, once you lose, because that's it. That's the biggest call a woman could get. Everything goes out the window, everything. It's interesting because I thought about that the last time I sat down with him and I was pregnant with Ellis. I think you said to me, don't ever become a woman, Christine. Don't ever become a woman. And I was like, wait, what did you mean by that? Because I've literally been thinking about it for like two years. When you're a comic, you're a savage. Yeah. You're not a woman. If you're on the road with me, I'm not going to try to hit on you. But the one in the room, I'm going to Fart and you're going to inhale it and I'm going to take my shoes off and you're going to slow my feet and it just becomes a part of your life.

Speaker 1:          00:20:01       Until one day you become a woman and go, why am I sitting next to this fat fuck? Talking about eating pussy and giggling at his dumb jokes and smelled his feet and his breath because you were a comic tolerated it. But one day the uterus takes over and you're like, why am I sitting next to this criminal? Well, why? Why? What? What is what? What is my PR? It was a good point. Now I'm thinking, no, you're a woman now who's a mom and a comedian. Now you got three ads and now you have to balance that. That's right. Because if you do get a VAD ain't go on the road 40 weeks a year to pursue your thing. You've got to pay for this in 10 years. Pens or commercial member panels or you could me now you can pay me later. Yeah, so now you were in a tough bind. Now he has to know mommy does comedy and it all works out and if you squeeze out 10 weeks, which you'll be, you're going to walk to the airport those 10 weeks like, do you know what I'm saying? You know how now like all right honey, I guess I'll see you on Sunday. Those weeks when you're leaving. Once he turns four it's like, Tom, fuck you. Where's your ou? But I'm running to the fucking airport.

Speaker 1:          00:21:17       Sunday. I'm taking the late flight back. You and Joe Diaz with that 6:00 AM flight. Yeah. Fuck you. I'm taking the four o'clock flight. Well sleeping late. We talked to

Speaker 4:          00:21:27       about this the other yesterday that the thing that's great about the road now when you, when you're a parent, the really the, the the moment of it, like the thing you savor is that you have no responsibility while you're there. I'm not on duty for eight hours. You really feel like, yeah. And what we're talking about is that the best part is enjoying the hotel room. It's like it's watching movies, ordering room service, no row and like, and like you know you, you have all the freedom to just do nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:22:00       Yeah. And Friday night cause my favorite night on the road, Thursday we've got to get up a radio. Yeah. Friday you're not responsible for anything. That's when I go back and I cut my phone guy toenail. Yeah. And I sniffed from my thrown behind the beds and you rubbed by your feet with the thing and you scratch deep. He getting that sack. Yeah. You try to figure out why you have a lump next to eat balls. That's the time I got a theory on that. You go on like the Hotel Mirror. Yeah as a spreadsheet and that sack and you know that's Friday night. I love that. I love it. I don't have to get up Friday morning, I get up Saturday morning, I get the Hindu eggs, I get white bread, I gets a quote. You know, cause there's always said Indian people at the hotels. So the Hindu eggs, you wake up, you go back upstairs and you sleep till like one. That's great. You got up, you go the Jeremy, a little lunch, little college football you call Tom. How's, how's the baby? Yeah. Great. Oh, you have to see he walked through. That's great. Great, good. Yeah, we'll see you Sunday. I see.

Speaker 4:          00:23:05       Yeah. I mean, look, I have modified my life so that I'm not out nearly as much. It's like I'm out 48 hours and then I'm fucking home dude. So, you know what I mean? Like I just don't do as much bullshit. And you find that you don't need to do, I don't fucking need to do Wednesday through Sunday, Bro. Like it's not even going down. I don't even fucking do Sundays. Uh, because of you

Speaker 1:          00:23:24       actually more than days. That's what I'm saying.

Speaker 4:          00:23:27       I'm home bro. Like I'm fucking here with my kid. All my husband, my dogs. I think you inspired at all a whole

Speaker 1:          00:23:32       generation of people. They should call it like the DA. A lot of divorces. Yeah. Yeah. I saw people disenfranchised and really think about what, get on a Sunday. I want you to really think what you got on a Sunday. What kind of piece of shit? 20 years ago. We got people that have the room on Sundays because nobody would come to see us on a Sunday. We were opening for Joe. Joe would leave on Saturday and that would be the answer that stayed Sunday and try to sell tickets by myself. And then I asked myself why I was doing it, even though I was single. When I got off the coke, I realized something that no matter, even though it was a comic, I'm still a man. And even though I was single and I had a girlfriend and I had no responsibility to it, there's nothing replaces something they'd done it.

Speaker 1:          00:24:23       I agree. Replaces Sunday dinner. Nothing replaces Christine pass the potatoes. Tom, what's going on? Nothing. Nothing. Your kid, I don't give a fuck what you do Sunday night. I don't give a fuck of Sunday night. You go to a strip club and stuck your tongue up a strip his ass. All right. But there's nothing like Sunday dinner with your family. It's true. Whether it's a girl that you date and that's it. Cause it's not worth the paper. That extra little paper you're going to get, you're going to lose that girl and 10 years from now, what are you going to do? Sundays are so depressing the spend on the road. It is. It's absolutely as a feature act that used to kill me to wait all day seven o'clock show. Then you miss that red eye. Yeah. You can't get 20 minutes. You always met. Like if you do Vegas, Vegas and the show starts at nine and you're like, I'm going at all. There's no flights after eight 35 got to leave Lake Phoenix, same thing. You got like an early show in Phoenix. Tried to leave early on a Sunday night. You missed the flight by 20 fucking minutes as the worst. Every fucking airline misses it by 20 minutes. So you know what, let's just stay home on Sunday. I love getting home early Sunday, taking a nap. By the time I wake up at two they are alive and kicking. I got her all day. You know, we play no Sunday's the best

Speaker 4:          00:25:46       feeling, especially coming off of work, like coming off of shows to come home Sunday, have a Sundae at home, make Sunday dinner the best we do Sunday trading. Don't fuck up like agent. He's always like, you know, like going on the road. Do you hate it? I'm like, of course I fucking hate it. I did it for a decade. I've been done the road bro. Now he knows like, but now my deals are better. Right? Because I'm like, I'm fucking doing it dude, until my deals are, and that's also a lesson. Before you were even moving tickets. I remember like we were all, you know, like lucky to get work basically right? Or your workforce and this is like six, seven years ago and no, none of us are moving tickets. And then I'm talking to Dan, I'm like, yeah, he goes, are you doing Sunday shows? And I was like, of course. He's like, yeah, I don't do them. And I go like, how do you not do them? Because you just tell him no. And I was operating from a place of fear. Like how, what have you tell them I won't do it. He's like, what are, they'll give you the work. It's like that you don't

Speaker 1:          00:26:43       do it. That's fine. But then he said it no so much that. Then they'd be like, all right, here's your Thursday through Saturday. And I was like, yeah, how can you get it? That's all you have to do or I'll do it the old fashioned way. You want to fuck with me. I'll books the sun that threatened me with a Sunday and I'll take it. But I guarantee I got do their own movie that Monday. Oh right. I have to leave on Sunday and when then you fucked. Yeah. Cause I'm not going to drop it on you until Friday. Rob Schimmell style. Yeah. You know, years ago, nobody remembers this. Rob Schimmell had Thursday through Sunday at the Improv for like six months from Rob Schimmell was hot 98 yeah. But they created the show called like how to marry a millionaire or something and one guy was a comedian and he was a comedian from the early nineties who used to lie this pants on fire.

Speaker 1:          00:27:33       That was his opener opener. Where do you go after that? And he would go, is it hot in here? Is it me? Ain't no, he was a funny comic and stuff, but it revitalize his career. So what at the Improv's do they give loans? They took everybody's Thursday away and they gave it to him. So who would go, okay. You know what time Shim would cancel on Friday? Like 6:00 PM two in the afternoon. Oh, you want to fuck up my Thursday? Yeah, I'll fuck with you Friday. So who canceled on him? He did it three weeks in a row. They never fucked with him again. He was a bad motherfucker, man. He didn't know. He was like that dog. He canceled overnight with a fax. Didn't wake up on eight o'clock. They get the cotton for the Improv on Friday. Soul dot. Shimmel just canceled.

Speaker 1:          00:28:22       It looks like you're line lining Joey. Oh yeah. That's the way it is. And I've bumped into him at an airport once and he goes, sometimes you got to teach them a lesson and who know who know who the fuck that dealing with. They want to sell you out for money. They'll never saw y'all for money again. He was a smart, savvy kind, funny guy. Robert Schimmel and Hungarian. And I'm Gary. Yeah. You know, we, we live in the, uh, we've been, we were robbed for 15 years. Right. You ever go to check now and you look at it, you go, remember when we used to ask them for $200 more and they told us they didn't have it and now they're giving us this check, you know, whatever we got Rod. Yeah. So now you know, they, they really would do that. Oh yeah, they did. Yeah, they did. They wouldn't do a towel rooms. So yeah, he did a lot of Kinky shit. So now even an old dog gets a warm spot on the sidewalk at one time or another. Yeah. So now you got to fucking pay the freight bitch. Pay The freight.

Speaker 5:          00:29:23       That's true. And they all complain. The club owners are like, well, I mean, how, how come they, these big acts, they turn into Dick's. It's like, what happened? And I go, well, what happened is you guys treat us like dog shit on the way up. Yeah. Now there's no fucking love left bitch because you've been kicking us for 10 years. Yeah. So when you're at the top of the chain is time for you to get yours because you treat us like shit for so many. Learn how to be assholes

Speaker 1:          00:29:46       from you. From you buy a car. Yeah. Yeah. When you go buy a car now they give you two options. They give you what? I sold you a car. Whenever I sold you a car, I just didn't sell your car. I brought you back a purchase number and I brought you back a lease number so you could seat both options. Yeah. We have the same option that yeah, you can either take care of us at the club will go to the theater across the street. I won't make as much money as that with Athena, but I'll teach you a fucking lesson. Yeah. Yeah. So you better keep you, you saw a lot of cheeseburgers and Joey's onstage Herbie's smoked reefer. The Joey D's show. Yeah. So don't come to me with this. No. Gee, this left, this d, this lap. Yeah. And I want it. Yeah. And if I don't get it, I will sit at home. Yeah. Then then, then, then that's it. And that's just the way it is.

Speaker 5:          00:30:31       No, I know they, they really do. Fuck you so hard.

Speaker 1:          00:30:35       And I don't want people at home to think all these guys are whining. No, no. I want you to think, listen, it works also, when you're a mason, if I could become a mason tomorrow and I come to Christina, go, cause she didn't want you to teach me how to be a mason. She's gonna teach me for 10 bucks an hour, how to be a hod carrier. Hod carrier is stocking the masons, knowing how to put 16 bags of sand and making cement and making sure they all have some meth. They'll give me a raise every six months to, I love the $2 or whatever the fuck it is. But then they're going to come a time when they're going to go, I'm sick, jump in. And now I'm laying brick and I'm doing everything. But they're still paying me the short 10 yeah, and they're charging 22 for me.

Speaker 1:          00:31:22       You're right. Do you follow me? Yeah. Try and 22 on the bid. So this happens in every occupation. That's right. You know, not just comedy. I don't want it. This happens in plumbing where for two years you're getting fucked in the ass. Yeah. They go on, Christine, how are you doing? A will leaving you here today and you're like, yeah, wait. Yeah. You were in charge of Tom and Joey today. Make sure the pipes are up while the wiring is bold and so for two years you get fucked doing that too because he's out golfing and you'll get, he's getting the,

Speaker 5:          00:31:53       that's true. It's like any apprenticeship mean apprentice even to become like a doctor. Right. You're broke for the first what decade. Yeah. You're a student, you're doing your rounds and then you graduate and now you're a practicing physician. I think in our occupation, the graduation moment, it's not as clear. There's like a gray area where all of a sudden you're moving tickets and now it's like, and you have to fight for your graduation is what it is. You have to assert yourself. I mean, what's that great story? Who's the guy on the Sitcom? He's super famous now. Gardendale Billy guard down. I really got l. Yeah, he uh, he was talking to somebody and this is like, right when he became really successful. He goes, yeah man, those $1,800 a weeks, am I right? Like he was still doing them right. Even as the, he was doing television. That's right. So he didn't assert himself for the raises and for the graduation, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       so, so, so crazy. 1800 and he's like a big star. Yeah. But I mean, now he's, he's making a way more of course. Yeah. But I'm good for him. He busted his ass for a while. Oh yeah, absolutely. He's a funny guy. He was always on like the side and he was always put on a good show with his shitty sidekick. Yeah. Who would take down the show? He had 20 chances he was unlucky. Yeah. Guys don't remember. He had the NBC show with a black kid that was not funny. 20 million black people, but a funny, they gave him the other funny is black guys a World War II is black guy. Everybody, everybody's funny is black. I gave him the guy that couldn't be funny if his life depended on it. So true. There are so many funny black people, Joey. That's very true. Uh, so I'm fine.

Speaker 4:          00:33:26       I'm fine. I got my bed. Hmm. So, uh, thanksgiving was, um, was a blast. We had, we hosted at our house. We had people over. Um, we basically didn't do any work, but it was totally worth it. It's great. The outsourced all though to the Hindus have them cook for us. And then, um, I did the Wilbert or the Wilbur, the Wiltern turn on, uh, on Saturday. Yeah, it was amazing. Amazing. So Super Fun. Thanks everybody here in La that came out to the show. I'm also, this is one thing that came in a lot over the weekend was um, are you going to 69 at 69 till we get this thing up? My Dad turned 70, uh, earlier this year. My favorite thing that we had a big family reunion and my mom, you know with Florida? Yeah. That's when you went to Florida. My mom is Peruvian and she doesn't, she's not up on any of the lingo or anything.

Speaker 4:          00:34:19       So at this big dinner, I asked my mom, I said, you know, dad is turning 70 tomorrow. Are you going to 69 him tonight? And she was like, what? She didn't understand it. So we would all laugh and make and just joke about how, you know, just just make fun of her how naive she is. Right. So we told people on our podcast that you should do the same thing. Ask your mom if she'll 69. Your Dad when he turns 70 and they'd been doing it and videotaping the reactions to pass out. What a plan. I'm going to play a few of them. If for example,

Speaker 7:          00:34:51       well, the, the milestone [inaudible] 70th birthday, right? When Tracy is about to turn 70, um, his last night of being 69 years old. Um, what'd you 69 him? Oh Shit. No. Hell no, no, no. Tracy York, a little stone cold in the face there

Speaker 4:          00:38:53       It's hilarious. That was awesome. She goes, why does it have to end at six tonight? As I said, that's all I have one last time that when you see old people that still fuck all you think about, like when you see some old lady, what if she was like the most prolific Dick Soccer? Like, yeah. We were like, you assume like, oh, she's an old lady. She might've been like, I used to blow the whole block. Yeah. Like guys used to just drain. They're nuts. Yeah. But you just assume because she's old, but she doesn't have any, you know, sexual history, you know, but obviously,

Speaker 5:          00:39:28       or even my friends that are moms now do I have this one friend in college that was such a fucking whore, like just everybody dumped clip center and now she's super mom. She's got two kids. She's always on Facebook, like posting the activities again, like, dude, you were such a fucking whore. Like when I think of all the Jews inside of her.

Speaker 4:          00:39:44       Yeah. It's gotta be a lot. Ah, it's not even the same person now. No, I know. But that's the thing is that she's gonna, you know, few years later, right. 10 years from now, 20 years from now. And one day she'll be just like a nice old lady and someone will be like, oh, watch your mouth in front of her and don't say right. And then you'll be, you'll walk up and be like, Oh, I've known this horse and she's 18. Every guy, every guy on the fucking, uh, on the block got a chance to ride it out. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:40:11       Yeah. Like when you think about your grandma, like she sucked so many days. She might have, you know, she sucked your granddad's dig

Speaker 1:          00:40:18       for sure. Costume. Yeah. Well, it's crazy how my friend's mom, my friend, his dad died about two years ago and I talked to him a lot and I will always take growing up and I always ask them, how's your mom? He goes, my mom's a different woman. He goes, cause my dad was 15 years old and she was, and she married him when she was 20. So now he, she wanted to an old folks home and he knows his mom. They go out on dates, you know, the mamma like it's a complete goes out. There's days I don't talk to him. Yeah. She's go to Atlantic City, she goes, you went to see Hamilton, you know, they, they have these lives and 70 where they gotta be doing something. Sure. We've Viagara and if you've got a good heart, you still fucking, I just can't imagine what a pushy looks like at 70. And when it would smell like it smells dusty or

Speaker 4:          00:41:13       I saw a, when I've seen an old one, I saw what at 84 I saw hunter. You what? It looked like. It was pretty, it was pretty gnarly. How did you see an 84 year? I went and watched a surgery. Uh, I was doing this research paper on surgery, like just the history of surgery and they let me go to the hospital and then they're like, you're going to witness all of these, um, uh, you know, OBG surgeries today. And I was like, oh, okay. The very first one, they were like, we're going to remove a cyst from this old lady's purse. And I'm like, okay. And they're like, make sure you don't talk about it because she's awake, you know? And I was like, oh, okay. And then they post you up right underneath her spread legs. They undrape it and they go in there and there's like a softball size cyst inside of her and they pop it and it's shooting pass out and it, and everybody's like, Holy Shit. And actually it was good thing that they're reminded us not to say anything because your natural instinct was just to go like, what the fuck? No, but we got everyone kind of can be awesome

Speaker 1:          00:42:16       thug compose these bug up. But yeah,

If he ever 60 90 to have a heart attack, doesn't it drive you crazy? But one man's chicken is another man's fucking, yeah, so you have to look at it from that. You know, it's like when you take your kid to go see a, your Bob look at their face. Their face is fucking, this is God. You know, he's some dude making eight bucks an hour long for college degree. But you know it's weird. It is weird. What something, it's like when people come up to you and go, I want to show you pictures from my vacation. I don't give a fuck.

Right. But you can't call me out on something I did 15 years ago because we've all changed in 15 fucking years. Yeah. That, you know, you want to call me out because when we were shooting a student film, Christine in 1998 I smack your ass. Give me a break. You're going to ruin my life because I smacked your ass. Even though you had hot pants on. And we're talking about how hot your friends say you asses. How many times have you gone through his set and people acting fucking totally, totally fucking wrong.

I had to stop my come hug to write this email about the question of the advantages and disadvantages of being born with six fingers as a glass then moves to be made with six fingers. On one hand, I could answer this puzzling question. We in the sixth fair community do not acknowledge a middle finger. Also from experience. It is not an advantage in the fingering men, women, Zim, Windsor's, but I believe it does add to the experience when you rub, rub, rub. Thanks. Water champ and Christina machines within, please fuck my triple d slot wife, your boyfriend, the Trans Canada highway.

Speaker 4:          00:58:22       Sam, the rainmaker. Well, he got a lot of them in there. That's quite the answer. I can't wait. Sorry. I keep thinking about those too.

I guarantee we have way more listeners than they do or you have no idea what they just fucking did. I know they're going to fuck with the wrong people, the wrong people. Then they're going to have to, they're going to end up shutting down their Twitter, bio, terrain fury, uh, the wet butthole research. Okay. And Mommy's, I'm a regular shit to shower. Participant. Great. Do you do that job?

Speaker 1:          00:59:04       Oh, this is shit in the show, in the shower, every once in a while pieces fall that you're in there. You over committed, but you take a shit

Speaker 4:          00:59:14       mean you're showering and then pieces of shit.

Speaker 1:          00:59:17       Tom Did you take, sometimes you jump in the shower, you wake up late, you're late, you're not thinking and you're like, fuck, I'm supposed to take a ship before the shower. Or you're like, what am I going to do it dry off and go out and start from scratch? No, no, no. You're not around that shit. And then you take a stick and you push it down the hall. Yes, I did. I thought it would be three or four times. My wife caught me and my wife called me one time and throwing a piece. She caught you throwing a terrible one time. She caught me with my hand. Throw it into the toilet. Yes, she did throw up and then she got upset. She to live. We're done with that. I've never just pop a squat. Right. Pop a squat but thing and in hotels on the road.

Speaker 1:          01:00:03       Yeah. If they, oh I think a good shit in the shower. I don't give a fuck. And it has like those four things and the beauty of it is the shower has, the fourth thing is so it's like when you were a kid and you had Plato and you push the shot, the shampoo. Baba. Yeah Bro. I don't fuck around in Vegas at that big shout when the presidential suite and they got that big hole or my God on a regular day though. But I haven't done it about 10 years. I'm going to lie. Yeah, it's been about if you take a shit on the toilet, do you wipe and then get in the shower or do you just take it all right. Here's the day. Remember a couple of weeks ago when the plane went down because the guy farted and it was really bad couple of weeks ago for flight, had it go down because somebody farted and it was really bad.

Speaker 1:          01:00:51       Okay. I had the whole explanation to that. Okay. I'm a morning shit. Yeah. But I can't wake up and shit. I have to wake up, drink coffee, do a piece of nicotine gum that gets the interior going. Yeah. Then smoked dope. Then you smoke. Right. So I opened the back door while I'm smoking, the shit starts coming out of me, so I'm smoking while I'm shitting. Okay. So that's that first really, really good shit in the fucking day. Yeah. And then you go and then I take a shower. My ass is tip top Magoo and I have no other problems. If, if I shit, it's maybe like at six and before I go out, I'll take a shower to go to the comedy store. Okay. So that's, that's that one thing. I'm a morning shit. Who's a morning?

Speaker 1:          01:01:38       What happens if you don't like that dude that got on the plane that day? The plane had to be taken down a 10 I've been there because you got up at five you ate breakfast, Uber came before you can take a shit. You walk into the bathroom at lax, it's a tornado of shit. Odors. Have you ever walked through the middle of the men's bathroom? It's 10 guys shooting at once and you're like, I'm not going to take a shit on me. Then you have the oatmeal and you're going to have that fucking four hour flight and you were asked after two hours. Listen, only in animal cause shit on the flight has done it a few times. I've done it for emergency shifts and not like a casual show. If it's, I will hold it till it's coming out of my ear balls, eyeballs before I share on a plane.

Speaker 1:          01:02:24       That's disgusting. It's gross. It is not really disgusting, but they do the best they can because the structure goes up. Your farts smell, you know they do the best they can. They happen on that flight. He held it. He held did. He held it and then you get those pre farts. Yeah. It's like when you're driving home, you could drive home. You don't need to take a shit once. Your asshole processes the exit. Yes. Okay. One Laurel Canyon, but you hit violent as soon as you're asking your eyes connect with Laurel Canyon. Yeah, it's like two miles. Now Watch your asshole hits the ramp. There's a magnet on the off ramp. That bull shit out of your ass, Nigga. She goes, that first light. When you're going off that over that you pray to God, you go, Lord of there's a fucking God. Please don't let that be a red light there and there's always a red light because that mag needle pulls that, that last bump.

Speaker 1:          01:03:22       Now you're at that light, your foot's tapping. Think of that fart that comes out first, that the appreciate Fart is horrific. You can't even tolerate it. You got the windows open, you got the air on, it's thick, it's warm. It's really a, once you go, when you feel it slipping out of your ass, and that's tremendous. When you sit and that first 14 inches drop and you hear the water hit your ass her and be like, Ooh. And then he'll like little pieces like you have to go to a hot dog factory. You ever go to Sab Brighton hot dog factory? When I was an old CIO, he works study program that made us go there. That's what my ass hoes life. When you go to the Sab bread factory, it's a hole in the floor like the six by six foot circle and there's a bunch of Puerto Ricans with rules. All right, and this dream Puerto Rican with bags of 80 pound salt. I'm not making this up, I didn't want to insult you. You know.

Speaker 1:          01:04:28       So there's a duct duct, Christine, it's all pieces of the cow and the pig that are not used. The hearts, the eye balls. Did you just see him coming down, Blah Blah Blah and it smells horrible and you see like three Puerto Ricans put the salt on down and 10 Puerto Rican. They sweep it into a hole and that's where it gets processed and it becomes on. That's how the hot dog is. Probably that's how your asshole is. That's how your asshole, well I dunno, I lost whatever thought I had but didn't you recently have a huge shit you were saying last week when they came from New York it was four days. Eat for some reason, correct me, we take shits on the road but they're not really good shit. I have to look at them and go, it's like a nine inch. It's not a lot. This shit I take when you get home.

Speaker 1:          01:05:24       When I walk in that door you put that luggage down and I run for the back bathroom. The Shit I took was like a cane when I flushed it. If you could hear the cane breaking like they have like a bone in the middle. It was going to finally broke and it flooded and I had the pleasure and I will, the next morning I come back and I see my wife, she went and got a snake at Kmart cause I'm always fucking that bathroom up. I fucked that bathroom so good. You can't take a shower back there really? Because sometimes the shower over floods from this shit. I taken that batch. Listen, when I picked that house, I pick a house because of the bathroom. Everybody looks at living rooms and family rooms. If the bathroom a proper, you're not going to live right. I want my bathroom and he just spread my legs out.

You wouldn't know. You could eat off your ass. It's like it's beautiful and you take some water and then I, I took a loofa. Yeah. You go to bed, bath and beyond and you've got a big Lou for, you got a good one, but you cut it into little asshole loofahs. Oh, that's a good idea. I have an APP, looser loafer every night. 90 days I change it.

Speaker 1:          01:07:11       You dispose of it. One use and gone like every two or three weeks after the fucking know. But I don't understand. Listen to me, you take the thing and you let the big day, the tushy hit your ass, right? Yeah. And it takes all the chunks and fingernails and all the, all the big shit. Then you take Roland pay, uh, toilet paper. You wet it first and then you massage it and this, it's clean. Yeah. Now to exfoliate the ass. Yeah, because that's what nobody does. Everybody's washes and wipes, but nobody is fully hcs hall, the Loofa and you take the other one and you just, you know, exfoliate that little last home. Yeah. And later on, later on when you're driving, you go for a little drive and when nobody's watching you stick your finger in your ass and you scratch it and it smells tremendous.

Speaker 1:          01:08:05       It smells like that little Lou for like that little clam. I bet you joy as a really nice ass. Do you know why? Because I want somebody to look at, nobody's ever looked at, but if they really illiquid, I'm not saying no stop. No decent woman. No woman that's going to bury your children is going to fucking eat your ass. Your wife is eating your ass on the rag. No, no, but she showed that she really should date and she had to eat my ass one time. If not, I can bury it.

You think I'm going to tap you and go Christine, you got wagging your ass. I'm a soldier. I gotta either with that way cause he's a real commitment. Pled rocky bunny because we had a debate on this show that this guy was like, the only way I'm going to get a girl's butt is if it's totally clean. It doesn't smell.

Speaker 4:          01:18:16       Hmm. While waiting to be called with her number was called. She didn't turn off the music. You just set her phone on the counter. Well, getting helped by the employee. All of us there were stunned and no one said anything. I should have said something or let it pass. I really, I didn't really mind, but it was weird and uncomfortable. Thanks gs. Nicholas, I think you're insane. Yeah. If you're walking around playing music and then put your phone down and play music through it. I even think people are crazy walking around playing music when they're walking around and how loud for everybody, like we all have to hear your fucking musical preferences. I think so. We should definitely say something.

Speaker 5:          01:18:51       I did some great. I've been in righting wrongs. Don't say anything to her. She's out of her fucking mind. Oh, well you don't know what she's going to do to, you know, let her do it and just get on with your life. Those people have, are out of, she's done on another fucking reality. Dude.

Speaker 4:          01:19:02       My respect goes up 10 fold for people that say something in those situations. I've been in a waiting room where somebody was on a phone and there's one of those office waiting rooms where it says, don't use phone and somebody else in the waiting room and said, hey, get off of your phone. And I was like, ah. And the other person goes, excuse me. And she goes, don't you see the sign? It says you can't be on the phone in here. And so the lady was like, Hey, um, I think I got it. I loved it. I love all that shit. I get it sold. Say nothing unless it really affects me, but yeah, yeah, yeah. When somebody steps up like that, I think it's the best man. It really gets me excited. Um, so go see Joey Diaz. He'll be at the Sacramento punchline. You only have two shows left. You can get into December 7th, which is Thursday. Yeah, Thursday and Friday. Like the arrows show. The late show probably is one of them. So that'd be the eight Sacramento punchline. A checkout Diaz. Uh, Christina P, you can see a mother and fury on Netflix if you have not yet seen it. It's streaming on Netflix. She'll be in New York next few days.

Speaker 5:          01:20:03       Yeah, I'm doing the stern wrapup show on Thursday. So if you guys listened to that, I'm

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       so fucking excited. I'm such a huge fan and I can't wait to nerd out. Um, and then she has her dates available at Christina p online. That should come into, uh, uh, Short Lake titties. Charlene say that Port Portland Horrigan and Pasadena and then Calusa Colusa Casino, which I think, uh, I think Diaz and I did that together. Oh, stop. My favorite thing about, well, he had an edible with him before a flight and I lost my mind and he was just talking to all kinds of crazy shit. I thought I was going to pass out from laughing. Then we, we, we did a southwest flight together and he goes, go sit by the window. And I go, okay, why? He goes also by the aisle. There's no way someone's going to want to sit between. Fuck. There you go. All right. We said that worked for all those flights.

Speaker 4:          01:20:59       I remember that. I finally like started to come down off of this edible and I was like, man, that was horrible. That was horrible. And I come down and I go, I just, I'm amazed at his tolerance and I go, I just can't believe how much you can tolerate. Like I was really like having anxiety, I guess you don't. He's like, what are you talking about? I almost had three panels and I go and I go, dude, you don't mind that. He's like, what are you going to do? And then we walk outside and I'm like, thank God I'm coming down. He goes, you want to smoke a joint? I don't want to do anything. I don't want to do anything for a year. Yeah, he was just right back at it. How do you deal with the panic attacks? Cause that's why I can't take live, breathe, just breathe.

Speaker 4:          01:21:42       Do you talk to yourself like don't feel it and you're like, I chill the worst panic attack as if I eat an edible and I have to do something run upstairs or that's when I get panic attacks. Like something active has to be done. Oh yeah. Okay. But besides that, I'm pretty good. Yeah, that's yours. Okay. Do you do an activity? Do you ever like watch TV to calm yourself down? Sometimes when you're too high I just go to sleep really well. I'm too high. I just passed the fuck out. Yeah, it gets to that level where you just want a little too deep. Just take a little nap. I remember we got to Calusa, I still remember this, we've got the CALUSA and they're like, do you guys want to go to the buffet? We were like, sure. But I was still had that like after high where you know, you know you're not as hungry as you think you are because the weed is making you feel like you have much.

Speaker 4:          01:22:34       So I go to the buffet line and I come back with a salad because I'm trying to fight the feeling of just overindulging so I know I'll eat myself sick is what I feel like. So I, I show up at the table and then joy shows up and he's got like four plates of like all different treats. And he's like, who the fuck are you? And I go, when he's like eating a salad. What are you fucking Puerto Rican or something? Some shit like that. And I'm like, what? I go, I don't want to eat crazy. He's like, go get yourself something to eat. Come back. He would real fucking food. Then I go, okay, so go back. Yeah, we fucked up. Fuck. The weight watcher points with two stones were stolen out of our minds. You're the best dude. Thanks for coming.
