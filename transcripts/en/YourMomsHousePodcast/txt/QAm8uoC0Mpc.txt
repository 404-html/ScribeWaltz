Speaker 2:          00:02:05       You guys mind? I told the Jeff kind of the all time great drops from the show cause my pussy ladies this was this the original wells Fargo commercial from Wells Fargo? Yeah, she was there. She saw original spokeswoman share the half a million and they didn't give it to her and the Bank of America and you Chinese mother fuckers, um, Joe Murphy made this. It's really good. Thanks Joe. My

Speaker 4:          00:02:42       mom would get mad and she would say things like that to not kiss my butt. She would say it gives my buzzy was the kind of thing, if you're the person that you're like, um, yeah. Your mom probably didn't know how that came across everybody in the room, right? No, yeah, no. It was just part of the fun and being with her. Yeah. It's part of the fun of having a cool mom. Cool. Having a eccentric, her mom. Just kind of weird. Can I hear myself more? You can. I think you were this one right? It's good. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:03:13       I like your voice. It's very masculine. Thank you. I've been told that. I've been told, yeah, you've a real man's voice. Solar fans met a fan this morning. You did in the hotel. We, we celebrated our Banis Murphy Ernie last night. These best wherever any of, not just being married but also a raw dog in it does. Right. And uh, we're hoping to get more raw dog. We got some raw dog tweets. We did. I didn't get any, you must have just gotten really telling me the raw dog stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Go guys. Generally don't tweet me about their raw dog. Joy's, that's just for you. But we, we went back to the same hotel that we ride dogged in. That's right. A, how many years ago was that? 12 years ago? Yes. Around yesterday. And we got a couple's massage, which you're not a fan of. So I was really surprised that you, I booked it. Right. But remember last time I asked you a while back, do you want a couple's massage? And you went what?

Speaker 4:          00:04:19       No, no I didn't ask you. The woman did that worked at the SPA. She goes do you, would you like a couple's massage and your level of disdain for the very id. And I tell you something though, I tell you something about that was a huge upcharge yesterday and really it was really just to have two and two in the same room. But I mean like I think it's because the illusion of that being a thing like the, the marketing of it is something that's not compatible with the reality. Like we just in the same room. Yeah, nothing happens, nothing special. I can hear your lady going like, is that comfortable? And you can hear my lady going is that temperature right on the bay? There was nothing happening now. So how did you feel about it? Cause I didn't ask you, did you like the couples experience?

Speaker 4:          00:05:06       Would you do it again or you just seem like it seemed like the only thing that stood out about it was that I'm hearing a conversation going on. Yeah, that's it. That's it. I mean literally we walked in the room, they leave. We both get our tables and then I get to hear your ladies and then this is his pressure is good. And then do you want, uh, as you want the music louder and then when I heard that you don't like loud music, you asked her to turn it down. Now I prefer lab and use it. Yeah. I like to space out. I like to get weird, which is another argument for separate room. I agree. Well that's when we, when we went into the massage spa and she goes to for a couple's massage, I literally looked at her, I went, fuck you. No, I booked it and you book it that way. And then she goes, wait, I'm confused. And I go, all right, I guess we're doing it. Yeah. Well I felt like, you know, it's our band, a SMURF, Fernie, you do that to try it.

Speaker 5:          00:05:58       But I'm saying in retrospect to pay more for that, it's foolish. It seems silly to me. Foolish. They didn't do anything special. Like there's those champagne in the room. Nobody masturbated. No Bra, strawberries, you to come. A lot of people by the way, on board with the Shark Shark Bites, um, analysis and they're like, yeah, movies stupid. There's no masturbation saying, by the way, to everybody that always talks about um, pre show. There's commercials. This is pre show right now, right? Yeah. We're, we're doing pre show and you're already your borough. You're breaking my balls. You're breaking my balls right now.

Okay. Let's get into it. Okay. I was going to say, you were saying that if you are in a couple of yourself listening and you guys are debating who's the water champ, it's a great shirt to get to prove that you really are. Yeah, absolutely. Is that my favorite Dan Pena? Yup. We got all kinds of things. I was so excited for this interview. I was sweating out of anticipation. Yeah. I don't care. I mean, like I said,

Speaker 6:          00:11:54       we've interviewed major celebrities like brace from Juggalos. Yeah. Uh, Gloria. Stefan has been on the show jewels Venter, Aka Jules drools. And by far Dan Pena has been the most super exciting, amazing interview. I'm just so thrilled. Let's start the show. No.

Speaker 7:          00:12:12       Well, why aren't my favorite sayings is that got your fucking patty goes, you're trying.

Speaker 6:          00:12:16       Yeah. Did you start to use current more as you when you moved to the UK? Because I love it. Oh No, no, no, no.

Speaker 7:          00:12:25       Transition from cock vagina. I'm standing soaking enough now.

Speaker 1:          00:12:35       Don't bring in one love to this. Well, no, no. Go to your mom's house, Christina visits. Okay. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:13:27       Yeah. Concen vaginas. So many guns. He switched to vagina. He said cause con wasn't crazy enough. Yeah. Oh No, you turned my ears down. That's when your ears down. Yeah. Out. Okay. Yeah. What a treat. What end. Look, he's even wearing his suit. He's wearing a suit with his little pocket square and now adorable. He's in full panic mode, man. Full pain. Yeah. So why don't you talk about how did, uh, exactly you line this up. Okay. So as it happened, I subscribe to Dan Pena's Qla um, like newsletter. Okay. So I get emails from his center or whatever once a week. And we had just done Joe Rogan's podcast where we briefly mentioned Dan, but we couldn't get into it because Joe didn't want to, you know, get into any kind of trouble playing the guy's clips, right. Head off and shit down their neck. Yes. So I get this random thing and it just says, Hey, Dan Pena focus, uh, featured on the Joe Rogan podcast with Thompson [inaudible] and Christina fidgets ski.

Speaker 6:          00:14:32       And I, I look, I'm like, oh my God, that's me. Like, it was one of those spam emails. It wasn't directed at me. They don't, I've never made communication with them before. So I immediately just right back to this like spammy email and I go, hey, I'm Christina [inaudible] ski, huge fan of Dan's. We would love to have him on your mom's house. And not a few later I get a direct message from Dan Pena. Like, Hey, I heard you want to get in touch with me. And then Dan and I started dming on Twitter. And we, I got in touch with his assistant on email and we arrange this interview. But what a wonderful world we live in that he just ran like he hears us on Rogan.

Speaker 4:          00:15:10       No, just follow the trajectory of the whole thing. So like we were, what was the story I told you? I brought up something a few weeks ago and you go, no, it's not that weird because the internet like the Internet, the Internet, cause you brought it up. I bring it up. Bikes kid or the bikes could write. Right. And he ends up having his ex girlfriend and for this, what stood out to me was I was just on Instagram. Yeah. And happened to click a video with him doing the like your foot while you're fucking poor thing. Yeah. And that's how you found him. That's how I found him. That's how I found him. Pena. I sent that to blue band and I go put this in the show breakdown next week. Then like when I saw his name I go, I'm going to look him up on Youtube.

Speaker 4:          00:16:01       Yeah. And that's when I found, remember I go the first episode, I was like, oh, I can't wait to play it for you because I knew how much. And that's the one where he was like a, show me your friends, all your friends, you know why you're fucking losers because you have the fucking bumps, you're hanging around. So, and you were laughing. Like those are things I just typed in and I go, these are great clips. I know this will be great for our show. Then we talk about him on Rogan. That reach is so massive that it gets, uh, it gets back to him. Ben, and you see your name in a piece of spam mail newsletter. Yeah. Cause he obviously he blasts out stuff. Then we'll reach out and now he's on our show. It's amazing. Yeah. It's just, it isn't, it isn't.

Speaker 4:          00:16:48       Right. Like I said, like because the world now has shrank so much because of the inner webs. It's pretty, it's pretty Rad. And we could Skype with shrunk and shrunk. And is that the right way? I don't know. Actually. I just saw there, um, this is rad. And we could Skype with this guy in England who is eight hours I think. Fine, right? Yeah. Yeah. So first he tried to set up a Skype session at 6:00 AM our time. We we're like, um, no thanks. Not Happening. Um, but yeah, but first of all, sorry, sorry. Okay, go ahead. I just wanted to add an addendum to the massage story and we didn't really finish. Yeah, what happened, right. So on the pre show, on, on the pre show, you may have skipped it, but there's already the origins of a story, right? So we have a couple's massage, which Tom's vehemently opposed to, that's an exaggeration past.

Speaker 4:          00:17:43       And we do, I want to set it up. You set it up and we tried it and you fell asleep and started snoring, which was so typical and I started kind of giggling to myself and as you're snowing I thought, wouldn't it be funny when Tom Wakes up to tell him that while he was asleep, he farted so loudly that everybody started laughing? [inaudible] exactly. What causes that counterpart. So we both were done with a mom. Sij and I, I sit up and I go, oh my God, you farted so big and you're like, what? I did? I'm like, oh my God. It was so embarrassing. We all started laughing. You didn't hear it, you didn't hear it. Well then I go like, no, I got you, but you sold it so hard and you're like, you fell asleep. And I go, yeah. And you're like, I heard you snoring.

Speaker 4:          00:18:32       And I go, yeah. And you go, you farted. And I laughed so hard and then I was like, oh shit. Did I really? And, and you actually convinced me only because I remembered when it started. Yeah. I go, oh, I got to Fart in here. Oh, so the seeds were planted and what I'm saying, like I felt too far, but you know, when you, you clamp down and you go, I'm not going to part. Yeah. And then sometimes it will just go away. Yeah. But I was like, I must've fallen asleep. Where does the Fargo, and then, and I've asked therapists before and they're like, oh, farts happen all the time. Yeah. And I go, what are you doing there? That could be personal use to, it just led the biscuits fly. Yeah. They go, you know, it just happens. Yeah. Because people relax. It's exactly in that, in the scenario of describing, there's someone's pushing on you and you just relax.

Speaker 4:          00:19:19       Rippling. Yeah. He grew up at, but I can't, I got you. Good. And I was getting ready to apologize. I was getting ready to mention it and not apologize, but I was really getting ready to go. Like, oh, I heard about what happened. I couldn't let you do that. So then I told you what happened. You got me good. You really sold it. Good. Yeah. I really didn't think. And then, and then we fell off our primal wagons. Oh my God. Pretty fucking hard. Well, it wasn't Banis Murphy might convince me to go for it. Go for it. It's one night had alcohol, fried food. Uh, just that Mac and cheese. We did it. We did desserts. We back on the horse because I got a beat Burt and the fat challenge. That got a lot of work to do. Yeah. Um, but it wasn't worth it.

Speaker 4:          00:19:59       Honestly. Like that's the funny thing. You think you're, you're being bad and having fun and you're just like, I feel sick. Yeah. It felt sick all night. I feel terrible. And then there wasn't good. But the good part about it was that I had some really productive farts in the hotel with you. Yeah. And that made the Ana this banished merch for ne more special or you're very gassy, more specialists. You are a very gassy, I will say that. And you did give me credit, so I appreciate it. It was really, really enticing. Nothing makes me angrier or sad or rather when I fart and then you don't acknowledge it, you don't give me credit for the fart. Yeah. I hate that. It's like, why do I live? And yet a lot of thoughts to yourself last night that you really enjoyed. You were like right now, like you're enjoying us. Thinking about whether I enjoyed them last night. You did. There was a few thoughts you had that you enjoyed a dinner. Were you zoned out and you were like,

Speaker 2:          00:20:59       yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:21:00       And you let her know if they know that enough. The audience that we've talked about this before with you, that sometimes you think thought like, great, now see kelp. Caffeine. Okay, you, you think thoughts? I've reset this thing. I have no idea what to do. I'm not kidding you. This fucking thing I've downloaded it, I've used is anti sleep system. It's on. All right, well I'm gonna fucking know. Well, can I go ahead. You have thoughts that you don't share and you'll fully talk to yourself. Like we'll be like this and then you'll go, that's a kind of exaggerated. As soon as you go, well, I have to do with sound so that the audience just listening can hear it. You'll be like, okay,

Speaker 2:          00:21:49       yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:21:51       yeah, and you'll, you'll laugh to yourself like a crazy person and then I'll be like, did you just have a thought that you didn't share it? Sure. Yeah. I know. I don't deny it. It's true, but why? But share the fun thought because I'm aligned with you want to, I know if it's just keep telling you I don't want to, but it's just you and me. At dinner, it's not fair. Or today this morning we are having coffee in the lobby and then you are on your, I didn't have my phone and you were reading fun tweets and you were like, okay, good one. And I'm like, can you share the fun thing but you wouldn't share that one is a little different than what you're comparing it to though is that's reading something and and enjoying it. But when I have thoughts and you go tell me what you just thought. I don't want to, I don't need to know all your thoughts, but the ones that give you laughter when you lab, when you lol basically like how come you have to share if you're going to lool like no, then share the fun. Never. No, it's never gonna change. Well you know what, what?

Speaker 4:          00:22:54       I just had a fun thought. I know. How's it good one. Yeah. All right. That's good. Dan Pena. I am so excited. We talked to Dan Penn. Yep. Blue Band. Really turn these around quickly. Thank you. Blue Band. And here you go. Here's some of our conversation with Pena will also upload it as its own longer form. Just making you're recording. I was like, are we not recording? No, we are the red lights on. Okay. I can't wait. I can't wait. I can't wait. Here we go. I just love him to pieces. Uh, Dan, this is a use is so exciting to us. You have no idea. I mean, I know you've seen the footage of us. I'm talking about you were huge fans and this is just, uh, it's just a thrill for us. So, and you look amazing today. Do you love, so dap, you look like you're about one, two 25

Speaker 6:          00:23:46       and you can kill a bear without a fucking knife.

Speaker 7:          00:23:49       Yeah. Well I can't actually,

Speaker 5:          00:23:53       no, no, no. That's what he said in his video. His retort to Joe. Yeah. He got really upset that Joe called him old. He did. He didn't learn it like that at all. It's really interesting. He got real mad. What, what is the back story of you being the fifth, the billion dollar man? What? Well basically, I'll just summarize that one cause I don't think it's, you know, I don't need to play the clip. Right. Basically. So I was curious about it. I know a lot of people were wearing you the $50 billion man, you're not worth $50 billion. The number comes in, number comes from. That's how much men teas have earned collectively over his time as a business and life coach for people. Gotcha. So in other words, if you add up all the value of, of the people who have studied under him what they've earned for over $50 billion, that's why he calls himself that. So it's pretty, it's interesting. And that's why he's called that.

Speaker 7:          00:24:48       I didn't tell people then. It was harder for me. To me, uh, the money I did because it was, and I find it quite easy because one of the questions I'm often asked me, dad, why didn't you just continue to make a lot of fucking money for yourself? And I in quite frankly, and I told the kids at Oxford University and two months ago I found a pretty fucking easy. So it wasn't any fun anymore. Right. But I thought if I could go cause like you across the goal line. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that would be some fun. But what I grossly underestimated guys is how fucking hard it would be. Get people who are low self esteem, right. No balls. No. Right. Uh, no, no. Self competence. It had been raised by gifts. Your parents across the door.

Speaker 6:          00:25:35       Loving part. No. Yes,

Speaker 5:          00:25:38       yes. Um, that was one of the more fun parts of it.

Speaker 6:          00:25:43       Talk with them. That was great. And um, I don't know if what the, what you're going to play next, but Dan and I had a discussion about how you kind of do have to unlearn a lot of the stuff that you were raised with. There's a lot of stuff that your parents had just may have passed down to you. That's what therapist teach you to like, yeah, I'm learning the shit that doesn't really work in the real world. Yeah. And unlearning, you know, the essentially brainwashing you're programming. Yeah. Well there's a lot of dumb things. Like in the case we, you and I grew up in the Catholic faith. Yeah. There's a lot of stuff like turn the other cheek. If somebody hits you, give them the other cheek to hit right. Not the, Jesus would give them, offer them the other side to him as well. Which to me is the dumbest thing to tell somebody. No. If somebody hits you, you fucking hit back. You don't let somebody do that. Are you fucking Steve Spurrier stay a bed and the meek don't inherit the earth. Uh, they certainly don't know if that's something you tell them me so that they feel good. Exactly right. There's a lot of dumb shit. You grow up one anyway.

Speaker 7:          00:26:40       The only thing I do is if you want to be mentored, me personally, uh, you come to the castle and you pay. But uh, 99.99, 9% of everybody that had benefit of them cure late. I never met. I never skyped up Facebook or tweet funds.

Speaker 4:          00:26:57       Wow. That's a lot of fucking fucked with us. Fuck, fuck to the DM. Fucked and email fucked. I'm dying to know. Dan, why are people so fucking poor? Good question, Jean. Thank you.

Speaker 7:          00:27:14       Wow. Okay. I want to try and do my best imitation or Polish father telling his daughter

Speaker 4:          00:27:24       my dad retarded. You nailed it. He did his research. He did. He listened to us. Yeah, that was great. That is great. Uh, hang out with, oh man,

Speaker 7:          00:27:39       hotels. I didn't know that's what you did and how,

Speaker 4:          00:27:47       but somehow I bet I managed to stay. I stay productive. Then I stay productive. You know, it fuels my business. It feels my material. But see that's a very, it's a very smart approach to a conversation. I let the conversation began. Lithic is knowing a little bit about the people you're talking to. After you introduced me to the world of Dan Pena, I immediately got on his website. I read all the material I listened to, you know a lot about, he's got a podcast called ask the $50 billion man. And it's hilarious because he reads people. He's like, check out my fucking site. He'll be like, fucking shit. It's all on the fucking website. Okay. Like he gets, it gets upset, which is fine. Agitated. They tell you stuff, he'll, he'll tell he gives away stuff for free. So it's great. Fucking hilarious. He's such a wonderful treasure. Dan Pena. Well he was so, yeah, his dad was a cop so he grew up really hard, knocks plenty.

Speaker 7:          00:28:55       Uh, I had a broken a kid. Yeah. I smashed the guy, the glass window. The eye glass dries. Fortunately it was this site and the coup de Gras, uh, was, I dropped an aquarium from the second floor on my teacher and if he hadn't moved six inches, they woulda killed me. But it only broke his collarbone. Oof. Now my mother knew I was just getting started. I'm sure like grammar school, God only knows what I do by the time I got out. So she, she pressured my dad and we moved to the battle.

Speaker 4:          00:29:35       No, you go. That's, that's my story to that is your story. I grew up in a hard streets and then we went to the valley. Do you do it? You also grew up partially in the rough streets of Windsor, Ontario. Yeah. Did you start to use more as you when you moved to the UK? Because I love it.

Speaker 7:          00:30:02       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:30:07       Yeah, he's too funny dude. I don't even know what it's like now. You can't even dress your boy up in blue because that's considered a form of child abuse cause he hasn't decided his gender preference yet and it's, I fear how he's going to turn out under this

Speaker 7:          00:30:31       funny but ironic. It's your daddy wanted to give him

Speaker 4:          00:30:35       right. The key though is that we fired her, we fired her, fired her immediately got the boot.

Speaker 7:          00:30:42       I know.

Speaker 4:          00:30:50       I think we almost did. I really did almost blow a gasket on that. Yeah. It was funny too by the way. This is a total separate from this. I just realized that I reacted the same way now that I did in this video at the same moment. And I also saw you react the same way like in the moment to like exactly the same moment. Wow. That's cause they're genuine. I know. I always think about that when we play that go. Great to see you make him laugh. That was great. He was like Ha. And you could tell. Can you imagine if you worked for him and you were like, I'm going to do Reiki on your baby. But he would do, he would fire me. He hit me. He just said he would like to make an exception to it. Lastly, cause I know we don't have as much time as always, you look incredible. We wanted to know what's your position on jeans? First of all,

Speaker 7:          00:31:48       the kids that probably gets a write me an email me about that. You know, they say big, big airs or James at the bidding. I guy that I don't know what happened either seven or eight guys that I know. I can say that I know and uh, they don't wear jeans.

Speaker 4:          00:32:08       There you go. Dan Pena does not wear jeans. I don't do it for all the success I've had. Uh,

Speaker 7:          00:32:15       the, I have the least amount of followers,

Speaker 4:          00:32:17       right? Twitter kills me. It's weird. You should have linkedin and there's a reason. What's that? Cause you're a fucking punk. What his answer was,

Speaker 7:          00:32:35       most people call people a person to cry if they're a obnoxious, et cetera. Right? See when I call your parents for your fucking cow. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. Your brain to do what's right. Do you want to be liked by some other cons? Yeah, right. Absolutely. Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:32:51       There you go.

Speaker 6:          00:32:52       Yeah, he owes and just so you guys, if you do wanna know the answer, I think he, he said the reason he's not as popular in social media is because he calls people constantly. I mean, he basically, he calls you out, I'm being a pussy. Right. And, and fuck yourself. He doesn't tell you it's okay to be weak and shitty. Yeah. Which is really necessary,

Speaker 5:          00:33:10       by the way. I know it's been a week. Um, we have a new president of the United States coming to, and this isn't a political show by any means, but I do feel like it's necessary to say something. Uh, and it's, it's a pretty simple and we'll, and we'll move on. Everybody gets so fired up and hot headed and you came and talked to people. Very personal thing. Politics and religion, you know, and people get too fired up and you can't have, you can't have conversations. What I was going to say though was that, um, you know, uh, I don't, I don't know if it's not really a mystery. I didn't, I was not a fan, not a fan of, of Trump. Okay. Never didn't ever wanted him to be president and a never thought it'd be possible. But I will say that I think it's important, um, to now that he's won, you know, the, uh, the rig system, uh, came together, kind of worked in his favor. He won, you know, I feel like you have to give your, for the benefit of your country, give them a shot. And, um, just I, you know, like I'm sending, you can be disappointed, but you got to give him a shot and see what happens. So,

Speaker 6:          00:34:22       yeah, I mean, I agree. It's not, it's not the end. It's not the end of the world yet. Let's see. Let's not panic. And everybody's in their initial reaction is some of us are horror panic. A lot of people are really depressed and anxious, but let's, so, let's see. Absolutely.

Speaker 5:          00:34:39       So, um, we'll move. I do have, I did think I'll give him credit. I thought he gave a very nice, uh, victory speech, uh, when he came out. I have a small clip from that and then we'll move on. This, this is him, uh, moments, you know, after accepting that he is the president elect of the United States

Speaker 8:          00:35:00       Chile sheet. I know she's bad, but audit starving dog shit and the dust storms have you run it out of prince frozen burrito covers. Got a solution. That's what you said last time. Did I got a solution here?

Speaker 5:          00:35:32       There you go. So that was um, a beautiful moment from that speech and um, let's hope that America

Speaker 4:          00:35:39       America is great again. That sounded like we're, we've returned to greatness or we're all great. Thank you. We're back. Um, when do you, how long before he does start shooting rifles in the air during speeches you think could, I don't know, it could be the most entertaining for years ever, right? We're about to embark on, it's definitely going to be great for comedy. I think it's going to be great for a Saturday night live the great for the arts in general. Yeah. I think we're going to have another, a renascence if you will, with the artists I do freaking out. Cause God knows the comedy world is losing their mind right now. Yeah, they're fired up. Um, so do you remember a while back? Jeans. We had a, I love you. You love me. Can I just say that? I love you. Thank you. I do.

Speaker 4:          00:36:25       I love you. I think you're a wonderful man. I'm glad we've been married so long. Let's just hit you right now. It just hit me because look, if the world is going to fall to pieces because of President Camacho, then I just want you to know I love you and we've got a compound, um, built underground. We can survive the nuclear holocaust and we can love each other. Oh yeah. There's no problems. And our two dogs were all should be fine. Our bunker is, um, we got our water supply, we got our backup generator. Um, when the, um, the nuclear bombs hit, it'll, it'll be fine. Be Great. You guys have our podcast to listen to.

So do you remember a while ago we played this, um, this British hooligan fan who was like saying blood and Fam? Yeah, that's a good one. He's back. Oh good.

I mean I've, I mentioned fam, I've heard, but I've never heard it like you used a hundred times and write two minutes blood. I don't hear a lot about it

Speaker 4:          00:41:13       So many, it's so many. Yeah. It's, it's such a weird drop. I know. And I always love is when, um, somebody like that is being interviewed and he has to really treat that person like somebody of intelligence that has, I think he that I know. I know what you're saying in a general sense. I think he knows who that guy is. A, he's at home. Yeah. He knows that this guy was a good interview. Good in the sense that he's entertaining, you know? Yeah. And he has to be like, how do you feel? Yeah. Like blood for blood, blood time, Bam, Bam, Bam. Black. That black fab time. Nothing like the soccer hooligans. They really love their side. Do speaking of accents. Yeah. And the UK, we have a full tour of UK accents. Right. Oh, I love it. Let's do it. Yeah. This is something as a master, right. People have asked me, you know, can you do this one came through that one. The answer is always yes. But now to educate us further. We're going to take this tour of an, and I lived in England for a year in the 90s. So I feel like I can contribute to this discussion. I mean I'm, I'm no master. Yeah, and right. Yeah. Am I in a Prentice? Oh, for sure. Yeah, of course.

Speaker 10:         00:42:28       Perceived pronunciation is the great communicator. As soon as you deviate from that and you're going to London speech for example, then you lose a little bit of the communication. Courtney is based on East Anglian sofic. Norfolk came richer. This is often by actors confused with the West country where the hour has come in and then you get Dorset and Somerset get into Cornwall. Devon slightly definitely goes in the nose a bit more like that. Then you go up north to Yakutia. It's nice if you get the word that Scott, one of the predominant.

Speaker 4:          00:43:00       That sounds very Downton Abbey, Downton Abbey. Where was down? Well, the way he said I'm a good Yorkshire Lass. Yeah. You said Yorkshire Shoah. They, the aristocracy. The aristocracy lived. I just, they would always take the train into London to write. They were country people Downton, so maybe that is your, I do know that the, the royal to the ton to talk. This is true with the chin out and a bit of a more nasal [inaudible] and then you know, again the cognate people, they get it. It's like Boston Bro. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:43:38       Yeah. It's nice if you get a word that's got one of the predominant sounds in it like yard, then you cross the [inaudible] into action. Which Mall?

Speaker 4:          00:43:46       That sounds like the way he just said that. Yeah. That your sounds like the um, the farmers on Downton Abbey. Yeah. The people that work at the actual, so it didn't sound like the down the farmers. Yeah. Yeah. The people, the, the actual working class sounds like the downstairs people, if you will. Yeah, but that's exactly how they would say things. You know, I wonder, I wonder where land kiss shy or directionally or not. Does that take place? We can look it up on this thing called the inner webs to the Google machine. Um, where does Downton Abbey take place? Where, where did the porno take place? Remember the season finale was so crazy. I mean, the series finale, when they all had sex with each other and stairs and downstairs, it's in Hampshire. Help share about five miles south of Newbury, Berkshire back chart. That doesn't really help me.

Speaker 4:          00:44:43       And they're like, where the fuck is that now are you, are you googling where the actual building Downton Abbey. Yeah. Um, she see where the show takes place. It can be, let's see. God Damn [inaudible] come a hell lot of comm. And then Birmingham, Bam, Bam. Okay. Let's see. Where does Downton Abbey, I love it when our Internet's never work. We've, we've installed about four different lines in this house. It's in the Fictional Yorkshire County. I just read that. Yeah. Fuck your mother for Yorkshire Country Estate. Okay, so it's Yorkshire. So that's exactly where in Yorkshire? Yeah, North Yorkshire. Right there. You'll see how the master picked it up though. So good. You did? Yeah. How did I get Yorkshire Lad

Speaker 10:         00:45:28       word that Scott, one of the predominant sounds in it, like yard shear. Then you've crossed the pen eyes into lanky share where it gets much more flexible and fluid in the mouth live. The tool is there to, you know, it's scouse to mixture of all kinds of sounds. One of those keys, Northern Irish with the raising and fluxions, but you don't get the rising inflection stone on Joplin where it has that poetic quality, which is sometimes sort of as being not different from Highland speech, which is uh, uh, also, uh, quite poetic and almost Scandinavian. And then you come down to Glasgow and into the lowlands of school and where are you get clause stalks and things like that. And then you come down the west coast and you're in wheels north Wales where it's breathy like that and down into South Wales. Well, you've got too much heavier and Welsh people sometimes even sound a bit drunk.

Speaker 4:          00:46:21       Yeah. This guy is so good. So good. Did I feel like he could be, he could sign up for my, my master's program where he comes and stays in the house castle and uh, we just practice accents. Yeah. You know, you should invite him to your layer. Boy, he's got to pay. But I'm saying he's really, he's getting ready. I feel like to take the course. Can I tell you the Welsh accent is, in my opinion, the hardest to understand of these people. That shit is bananas hard. And then you have a few pints of beer and you, you can understand what the fuck these people are saying to you. Yeah. And by the way, uh, trainspotting two is coming out. Yeah. We talk about some accents. I'm super stoked. There's whole chunks of that movie. I don't understand a fucking word. Francis Begbie says, oh no film. And I'm, I'm Gareth Jamison. I'm an actor and a voice coach from www.londonvoicelessons.com. Cool. Harrison, do you, um, do you, can you believe it 20 years later though? It's so fun. It went by so fast. Yeah. I mean, I was in college when that movie came out and I was like my favorite movie episodes. You remember like beat the first time or you're like, wait, what? What'd he just say? Beats like beats in the movie moment.

Speaker 6:          00:47:30       Frances Frances Beg me that, that the sociopathic guy that throws the beer. I don't want to, I didn't understand most of what he says in that film. There's an entire scene where he's talking to like he's telling a story to spud or something and understand a fucking word. I know, I know was a bit out of that bed and he throws the pint of beer and someone's screens and the only real lunatics and then whatever. It's such, I can't wait. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         00:47:53       Tips for working on your voice and I'll the, I like those. Really cool. Real cool. The key to any accent. Okay. Isolate the sounds that are specific to that accent. So in the Welsh shacks, and quite often you'll hear people saying that it's a very sing songs sort of sounding accent. The reason for this is that in Welsh acts and what tends to happen is that vowel sounds are stretch out and stressed and there's a huge glide from high pitch to low pitch. The accident I'm talking about is the South Wales Act and there's actually quite a huge difference between south and north. We're focused on the south Wales. So listen to this sentence, John, what do you do when John, what do you do when no discharge?

Speaker 6:          00:48:44       You do and that's good. Do it again. A huge John, what do you do and can I get John, what do you do?

Speaker 11:         00:48:52       And John, what do you do when

Speaker 6:          00:48:56       John, what are you doing

Speaker 11:         00:48:59       there? Notice that huge glide on John. She's much more common in males than it is in other parts of being of the United Kingdom, but it's not exclusive to Wales. Keon what do you do when John? Notice that at the end as well to run than it sound in doing too. When we we're getting pit and when it hit and pick, it becomes more like an air, so that's and bet they have a better that please. Is He doing

Speaker 6:          00:49:27       American accent? That'd be great if this guy did American of this guy. He does how to do a Scott. He does American Dad, let's hear it. He's all California. Browse talk like this bro. He's like Sally girl. Once you want to do is sound old. Fucking stupid like this. Hey, hey man. Hey Man.

Speaker 11:         00:49:51       Drove your eye color that 80 Jamison. I'm an actor and the volume, you want to go to Mcdonald's and you might want to do an American accent because you're in a play or a film or maybe you want to impress your friends want to be done. Maybe you want to try and fit in better in the USA. Whatever the reason,

Speaker 6:          00:50:11       weird thing to do to try to fit in better on the US side. Adapt a an accident on a vacation.

Speaker 11:         00:50:20       Playing with accidents is a great way to stretch your voice and exercise your speech. Oh, now the key to doing any accent is to isolate the specific sounds that occur in that accent. But today I can only give you a brief overview of some of these sounds. Of course, the USA is huge and there are many different accents, so we're going to go for one that's called general American and start again with the sound Americans use for the letter arc. Okay. Now listen to this sentence. Are there more birds? Totally. Are there more birds

Speaker 4:          00:50:50       there? More birds? Are there more birds? Are there more birds? He's really, like I said it more American by listening to him. Yeah. Are there more birds? Clear? He cleaned it up for you and did he really did

Speaker 11:         00:51:04       are now listen to this sentence. It's right. Are there more birds? Are there more birds? Are there more burden? Can you adjust it? Every time there's a letter R it's pronounced and that's a good general rule for American. Every letter are in the word gets pronounced. Are there more birds? Also? It's a very dark sound. Might help you to think about this. A sound coming from right at the back of the throat that here are there more for terrible there nick.

Speaker 4:          00:51:31       The only sound terrible compared to the beautiful UK. It sounds. Do we sound fucking retarded? Look, I have to work on what I've been working on. You can be here for it, but that's your front line. Shanti. Oh. Shantay that's be asked to be on. That's terrible. Do that again. Be on Sir. No, no. Do you need to practice beyond sir? Beyonce? Beyonce. Pardot please. Macy BUCO MERCI book. I'm so much better. No, no, no, I did really well. So you're learning French now and the airplanes? Yeah, I do it to occupy my time. When do you have time in between the Strip clubs? I don't, well, what happens is I'll go into a strip club with headphones on and you'll then sometimes they'll go like, yeah, man, don't want to take those out. And I'll be like, I'm working on my friend. I'll say, no, I don't see beaucoup.

Speaker 4:          00:52:38       MERCI. MERCI beaucoup. Beyonce. Here's what can I tell you why I did this? So people know. So I finished Spanish in high school as a sophomore. I took the AP. Well, yeah, there's a little advantage. I had a little advantage, right? And I passed. I had to like A's or with everything. So they go, yeah, you just take a second language. So what I did was I signed up for French and I got a d and I was always really disappointed in it. Then a few years later, I, I forget online or something, I found a French tutor and I go, I'm going to try to do this again. And I met with her a couple times. She gave me tapes. This was when there was cassette tapes. Listen to these tapes of practice. I gave up in, I don't know, a week or two. Oh, I bet.

Speaker 4:          00:53:30       Then I signed up for this online course about somewhere between 15 and 18 months ago and I did it for a couple days and then I, the reason I never mentioned it was I was like, cause you, I quit again. And the reason I mentioned to you at this time is that I've gone further get free. So you don't, when you're like, it's like a diet where you're like, I'm not going to say anything until I know I'm doing it. So far you, I'm in the beginner stages, but I've done four or five beginner things. It's hard when you're not immersed, I think in the language. You're not forced to show up to a class or live, you know, live in France and France land. Yeah. For Awhile. But uh, that's good. Good for you. Yeah. I studied German in college and I almost failed by the time I got to German three almost failed out.

Speaker 4:          00:54:21       I think I got like a d, I think I'm going to try to do a few of these, you know, with the, with the languages that come more naturally, you can incorporate it and you're deejaying. He can yell out. You can be like that European Dj, dad mouth, you know, there's, there's that, there's also, you gave me this great idea to try to be a retarded comedian. And I was thinking, what if I did that? But in multiple languages, I, that's a duck. They're not going to hold me to this same vocabulary that enable minded person would have. Right? So what if I did? I'm retarded, but I do this in French, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian. Then you can appeal to all retarded people in all cultures. It's such a beautiful idea on your part. And I saw one of their credit you with that. Thank you.

Speaker 4:          00:55:09       It's the retarded people of the world. It's a global act. Now you can go ahead and your agent can thank me for that idea. Well, you know, you can give him a call. Tell him I'll, I'll, I mean I'll definitely give you credit. Um, also don't forget, um, by the way, today I was, we share a booking agent and we were talking about for Eit said Fort Lauderdale. He corrected me and said, Oh, you mean fart louder now. Wow. And I go, and he just turned your commission on the was a good one. Are you going to go to Fort Lauderdale? We'll see. We'll see. We'll see if there was to work out the deal, Tom. Okay. It's all about the deal. Um, don't forget. Uh, I'm standing there and I smell what smells like somebody just dumped an entire container of coffee in the shower like somebody took, I don't know what that is. When the RAF and just,

Speaker 1:          00:56:02       you drink water today, dad. First of all, always been a big water drinker. He is like Brown. We should measure who drink some more water a day. Why don't we do a water challenge? I'm fucking you right now, bro. Okay, let's do this. It's so ridiculous. Accurate, so much water or more songs during the show. So many great, but this one is of course about the water. She knows her shit about me being the water flowing and they can see the manipulation. He could never drink as much water. There's online support with Tom is the best done a big fat liar. Here's the evidence. Remember? Wow.

Speaker 4:          00:57:03       It's so great. So again, that's the Watergate Emami Distrac or gain. God, that felt good too. We had that Teresa mom let this morning and I really liked it. I forgot how much I enjoyed Theresa. Actually. You got me to enjoy soyrizo. Yeah, that's a good alternative to the nastiness of, of real Theresa. Um, so then we were sent a, a comment, it's on one of our youtube videos. Youtube comments are that usually most flattering. That's where people really let you know how much they like this is actually has made me, this made me laugh so hard. This is from a Dj dad mouth video. Okay. So there's two Trone wrote this Nigga gay as shit. He could say he's non numeric or whatever, but if you suck in Dick, you gay as fuck the fuck kind of a name is DJ dad now DJ dad mouth Bro.

Speaker 4:          00:58:07       The fuck. Also. He's mad corny, but really thinks he's really fly with that dead squirrel around his rusty ass. Nick. This is what hip hop has turned into. We've let too many white people in and now they've brought that weird shit. There you go. That's the best thing that I've read all day. Donald Trump, the hip hop world. You've ruined it. The fact that this dude thinks that this is a real Dj. It's really, really fantastic. That's it. Yeah. It's just, it's like he can't pick up on the irony of bad jewelry or for all the crazy stuff you're saying. Or the fact that you're a standup comic who was really well known. Well, I just think it's great that he's like, just is ruin in hip hop Tony Mann and agree with them though. I think Dj dad mouth is ruining hip hop. Here's an email that came in.

Speaker 4:          00:58:57       I've been listening to the classic jeans and much to my dismay I found out during a, would you rather it turns out, mommy, Tina is the water champ. The, would you rather consistent of eating a week's worth of your bathroom trash? Um, or being or only being able to bathe once a month and then having a drink. The bath water. Mommy, Tommy, much like a true Barry chose to eat the trash you floss and all but mommy, Tommy, mommy, Tina, like the true water champ. She is took drinking the dirty ass bath water like a true champion. Love you all. Please come back to go bananas and do a live podcasts. Keeping them high and tight. My big words Dan. Thank you Dan. Sounds like you are not smart. So let's move it along. Damn. Thank you for being a real champion fan. Thank you.

Speaker 4:          00:59:46       Jeans. Do you remember this? This is in our breakdown. Oh my God. Christina p fan site. That's like one of the first websites ever made. It's got that real html kind of build this website someone made back in my road rules. It's 20 years old and they still put, they keep it up. Sweet. Uh, this is the only the one and only true dedicated Christina piece. I can Christina piece, thankful for being rescued. This nice person put together this site. They took photographs of the television. That's how old it says, and they, uh, they put it up. Thank you for bringing this to my attention again, after joining us in the breakdown. I didn't know I couldn't do that. Now you can. It's silly. It's, it's really sweet at that person kept it up this long. I'm really, it's an angel fire website to hard core, hard fucking card fucking core.

Speaker 4:          01:00:40       That was a very fat are flattering and there's a guest book there where people would write things is before comments. Yeah. Really great old school guys. You know what's really crazy is that there's generations, there's like people that were children watching me on road rules now who they came out to my shows and I'll be like, I've been watching you since I was a kid. Like, oh no. I don't know if I like that. I mean I'm thankful, but we're thankful that you did it. No, I'm thankful that they've followed me for so many years, but it makes me feel really old. How fucking old am I? I'm only 40 how are you a child? When you started watching me, I'll know somebody wrote about Lion Tina. He said, how long do we have? Do we give it until Tina says she saw Cuba Gooding jr break up a fight in New York City.

Speaker 4:          01:01:35       Chris, I saw that. That's so funny. That is funny. I saw it in San Francisco. So fucking fun. It's funny for you time waiting on the Tom versus burr psycho debate. He says, Tom is hundred 50% more psycho than bill. Thank you. First, let's be clear. Tom Is definitely the water champ and stuff like that, but laughing your buns off to a guy's reaction to getting his legs crushed by a car is Ted Bundy level craziness. So Christina, I'm with you on this phone. Tom Has that blood loss boiling up inside and needs to go hunting with powerful Joe Rogan to release all that before the body starts piling up bigger than the poop

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       pile. Thanks for being awesome and helping me when I'm feeling bad. You guys are a fun couple of peace and love. Daniel Daniel, finally.

Speaker 5:          01:02:35       just for a little, uh, balance here. Another email. I've listened to burrs podcasts for a while. It's actually how I got turned onto your mom's house. It takes about five minutes of listening to that show to realize what a psychopath bill really is. Tom is not even close to that level. J fizzle. Jay, you seem like a really, really sharp guy and uh, I'm 100% in agreement with you. He is out of his fucking mind. So, um, somebody wrote, uh, what did they say here? Couldn't help but notice the Mousse spotting noise that hunter made and a great idea. Could this sound be in the rotation of chips in a bowl and the cat cat eating which sound

The idea came from mommy. Austin. Thank you mommy. Austin. Yeah. Really good man. Oh, Mommy's is a watch. Patrion number seven. It looks to me like mommy. Tina is sabotaging Tommy's hydration. She sits there with an open lacroix, the choir next to her, yet she was drinking Tom's Perrier, I call fuckery. If you see something, say something Sean. Well that, that brings to our attention that Patriot has been off the fucking chain lately and it's been really fun. It really has been. So, um, first of all, thank you Shawn. And she does pull a lot of bull show said when it comes to hydration, whenever dudes, um, I have my things I can flash is not cool.

Speaker 4:          01:06:31       She doesn't share and she's selfish and that's just, you know, that's just kind of what I have to deal with. So there you go. Happy anniversary, Tom. Happy Anniversary. Now, you know, look, I gave you the guys, sometimes you give me the eye roll, which we learned. Oh, contempt is content and we saw a documentary or a therapist, a marriage therapist said if, if that's a sign of contempt, if you see that and contented, that song of bad content means you're going to divorce. I said, that's a huge indicator of divorce. It's contempt. Yeah. And you went and sometimes you give me a triple I roll. I don't give you triple, quadruple. You do eye rolls on it like you don't do I rolls. Yeah. Oh my God. You have so much contact or I wrote so much. Really? Yeah. I had this clip from your, um, show that you were at last week. Okay.

Speaker 12:         01:07:32       I can videos post videos on Facebook, but this is for you because the last time, but the video was posted. You was meant open up my place. No such thing. I'll wait if you twice and I was Eric in today. Were you asked to meet me and were arguing? I do show my niche. You and I, lesbian crew is not here. No one's here.

Speaker 4:          01:07:51       There you go. Okay. I love that it's actually that the gypsy, um, calling out videos for fights has expanded to women. I didn't really, that's what this was. I didn't know that there is a bunch of Gypsies, which you openly are racist against. Oh, that Roma Keith [inaudible]. Yeah. Yeah. Everybody hates the Gypsies. We know that. And so that's what she's squatters. They're squatters. Yeah. They are squatting or Gypsies. I didn't know that's what she's calling out the bitch for not being there again. She's like a bitch. Just like the dude's dude. You know, the dudes are like, bye. Oh, phobia. But now there's a woman. The woman makes it way more exciting. Why more a woman fighting is more excited only in that you go, this is such a departure from the norm. Yes, of course. It's bizarre when a woman fights physically. Uh, but why works or that's from the Gypsy show. That is right. I think she just, she's got way worse. Uh, so very interesting. So this is a, an English gypsy. It's, it looks,

Speaker 12:         01:08:57       yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:09:11       Yeah. They're kind of, they're good, but her outfits good. I like her. I think she's dressed in a little too nicely for a, for a fight. I wouldn't wear white to a fight. It's going to get red. Yeah. Whether you win or lose. And it's also, it's kind of tracksuit, isn't it? This is zip up her cruise. All right though, man. There. Okay. Good looking moms. Yeah. I don't know about that. Women fighting is bizarro. I guess we're not, I'm not even like everyone else. Yeah. When it was really slow in the MMA and Mama, it was my low ascension and then they got a superstar to her, which she helped the business of female fighting really grow, you know? Yes. But I remember when it first started, people were like, no, I don't want to fucking see the appointment fight now. Now it's become a thing where people are just as excited to see people want to see stars.

Speaker 4:          01:09:59       They want to see high level. If you can get some higher level fighters, female tennis players on the streets. When two women fight, it's like, yeah, but can I tell? Yes. Having grown up here, um, I actually saw more girl fights and I did. Dude fights between gang bangers and public school. Like the Cholos would get real like Cholos get 100 and fucking and fighting each other way. Way More. Wymore all you had to dudes I saw. Oh yeah the girls. Yeah. Oh Yay. Yay. Yay. Yay.
