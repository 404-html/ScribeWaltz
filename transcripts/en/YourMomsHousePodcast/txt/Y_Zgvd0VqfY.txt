Speaker 1:          00:04:38       Look at this here. Look at this. I know. See that it says next. Dot. Brown tog et that it's my lipsticks and the lady. Well, um, it's official. It is official. And your mom's house is continuing to enlighten the audience with these hard to find men and they're irresistible offers. I thought this is the new art Kelly show. Everybody who is watching this is it, I guess you've never seen our Kelly before. So that's him. Yeah, he's aged a little. Just a little bit. Yeah. Still talking about sex, but going the grind in and, yeah. You know what's amazing is that like the perverts don't age out. You know, you're like these surely there's a time where you're like, I'm too old for boners. I would think that, yeah. Around 10 years younger than him. Yeah. You'd be like, oh, stop offering the eat girls in videos.

Speaker 1:          00:05:36       Or at least the point in your life when you put the chain on your bifocals, which is what he's done. Like when you've got a rope around your neck to keep the glasses on your eyes, the eyes always tell the story. And I think doctor drew would maybe say, something's going on in the eyes here. What do you think? I Dunno. It just, it's not a normal gays, you know? That's not well. And, um, yeah and I liked the way he phrases it. Can we see that? Um, just the whole, cause it's a whole nice offer.

Speaker 6:          00:06:07       Oh y'all beautiful wind. That's nice. You feel this? Let me eat you one term. This let me eat your one time and you're going to, I guarantee you you're gonna, you're gonna ask me to stick to your house. You got your, you got to sleep for three days. My beat

Speaker 1:          00:06:23       did the, the European [inaudible] then that's when his accident pop too. Yeah. The 30 days be blue. This but it might be from the islands. Jamaica. Yeah. Well I'll tell you, this has some of the makings of a great way. Mh Video. He tried to ruin the show with that. God dammit. The little dust in here. Jesus Christ. God Damn. Ah, well number one, let's go through it. Um, framing, how are we doing? Are Pretty terrible framing but I've seen worse. But yeah, I mean he would make, he would make the cut. Now I'm embarrassed to say this man has a shirt on absolutely revolting that he dared to send him his video. However there is a hole and a hole and he makes up for it with a Bandana on his head. The Bandanas. Weird Bandana gets you extra points. Sure. He doesn't have all his teeth.

Speaker 1:          00:07:18       There's a couple of gold ones, so that's pretty cool. Yeah, that's perfect. And the fact that he chose the goal is kind of, it's, it's switches things up, but subject matter is a one point. That's how he, that's how when you get, when you, when you open like that, it's fantastic. And also another checklist is location. Location, location. Yes. And this one, he chose his front lawn, which is bold. It's an outdoor video. Neighbors. Sure. Kids are playing. Yeah. It's what you want from somebody that is living in your neighborhood. Which by the way, I don't even know that he lives in this neighborhood. He might not, I don't think it's his yard because he and his offer, he's like, if you let me eat you, you, you'll be like stay. And I think he's like basically off he's bay. This is basically a petition to, can I sleep at someone's house?

Speaker 1:          00:08:06       You think so? I think so. And the trade off is, I'm really good at eating so we could match him up actually with like get Elise. Nikki, try it out. Yeah, this is his, this is the try it out. Try it out. Guy Was a beautiful woman. No, we'll try it again once a black guys. Yeah, but I had a jail. I don't think that tried out. Guy Would, I don't think this guy would enjoy, he might do the beat me like you know piss on me. Beat me. Yeah. He might try it out but he's not going to eat him. What else does he say? He says some more stuff. No thanks. He said some other things all done. No. Next to push. No Bush. Do you need to see more like we got it. No we didn't

Speaker 6:          00:08:42       guess what more are you sure you would time eat enough? I tell you they got a man up a whoa. I could cook for you. Clean up your house, visit when you come home baby. You just got a job in jumping

Speaker 7:          00:08:56       to toe with all of them. Bubbles.

Speaker 1:          00:08:59       Okay, so I'm definitely on point. He is looking for a place to stay. You're right. How did you know that he needs housing and he's not a dick. I'm going to cook. Right? I'm going to clean and I'm going to, he's basically, this is leading up to, I'm guessing I'll eat you right after that bubble bath, but he's saying be cleaned for me to do that and that's always a big issue is vaginal cleanliness to these guys. These guys are very picky about these guys. Meaning meaning every guy that puts out the cool car irrational. Yeah, I got you. Okay. But they don't seem to care about hygiene in themselves, but it's very important that she have hygiene, which is ironic. I first of all the two fees you could be missing to have your front too. It's always unique weight, but he's,

Speaker 7:          00:09:52       if you go back a little

Speaker 1:          00:09:55       more, yeah, I know. I saw for there's oof can really see it clearly. There I go. Dammit. And you can highlight the missing two fees because the one next to the missing is gold. So you're like, hey, that's gold. Oh Hey, there's no tooth. Well, that's the thing is that he sprung for the gold. Why not spring for like the real, the veneer, you know what I mean? Or the implant. Maybe he's living his best life and goes, he's not like, I don't need all these teeth. I see one or two people having a good enough life. I'm living my good enough. I, oh need real chief is, I'm living in. Okay. Like, yeah, Jean Jean, it's, I can't believe it's actually here. Okay. What it's finally happening at the top of the pad, if you can see behind us, we are in studio gene. We're proud of ourselves. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:10:52       House. Yeah. You look, we discussed the motif. It is steak house meets the People's Court. Yeah. We want it to be official. Yeah, that is true. It's masterpiece theater steakhouse and the People's Court, this is a long time coming. I mean the, the dream of it is longer. The reality of it is, you know, you were super pregnant. I went out and started looking at spaces right in around June. Yeah. All right, so that's six months ago. And then found this place. I think I, I I to say I didn't sign a lease until, I think it was September, October it, Elise, Nikki, yeah. I got to listen to key in September, October. And then, um, what happened next? Oh, I had a guy who was going to do everything. Oh, build the sets, do the tech, do everything. And like the day after I signed the lease, so like now I'm committed and I walked.

Speaker 1:          00:11:50       He was like, yeah, it's not really gonna work out for me. I was like, what? Totally screwed us. I remember I was very pregnant. It's floating around in our pool, trying to keep cool in the middle of summer. And you're like, this guy just, uh, just got pulled out. And you know, who really helped really helped me. The first guy I called with was Ethan Klein. It's right, um, you know, Ethan Hilo from age three. And I was like, cause I know he knows a lot about production and sets. And I was like, dude, can you, and he hooked it up. He put me in touch with Tj more who built this set and then, uh, Nadave or our very own bird, a little behind in the nests are, yeah. He, um, became very involved. And then we got, you know, the technical aspect going, um, pod or help with a lot of production stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:12:38       And then we hired Mel and this great lighting crew and then, I don't know, it all came together. And then after all this was set up, we were like, oh, it's not soundproofed enough in here. So then we had to hire top tier soundproof [inaudible], which we are actually halfway through it. So I don't even know how this, I hope this sounds good to you guys. It'll sound even better next week when they're completed with it, but it's, uh, it's been a whole, well, I will say, I mean, look, we used to film the show next to our son's bedroom when he was sleeping as a baby. So we've done the show in many different locations. Pilati studios was, that was like six. Yeah, I think the thing, this is still pretty good now. This is still great. It's still great, but you know, saying I would like to point out some old school features just so some of you I know don't like change.

Speaker 1:          00:13:29       My therapist tells me I'm not good with change. There's a lot of stuff from the old studio. If you'll notice we have our dog mask, our mascot GG Allen is here. I got Webster behind me. City connection, a Fifo with all the dog tits. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Blue Band might. One of my favorites fan submitted things of me as the Virgin Mary water bottles of water, toilets, all the stuff you know and love and behind me, right? The dog pup play, the terrifying pup play. Who's your owner? But last time I came out as poly. Yeah. And I'm proud to say I'm bisexual, but also I'm so excited. You're ready. I'm ready for this big announcement. Caddying kibble when other sounds

Speaker 8:          00:14:30       chips in a bowl

Speaker 1:          00:14:34       vegging out. Now I'm building up. I'm ready. Go for it guys. After many years of talk, I'm proud to announce, behold the fart Mike.

Speaker 1:          00:14:53       It's finally here. Wow. We've been talking about this for so long. We really have been. And I have to say so many wasted far it's okay but I want to thank blue band and Josh pawn or everybody for making this fart. Mike Possible. I don't think this audience understands the level of importance she put on this for today because I was more worried about you know these monitors working and sound drops and you know those types of technical problems and Christina was like if this fucking fart and Mike isn't here, why did we even build the studio? I agree cause I know how important the Farc Mike is tour listeners, I feel like they've been demanding it for years and if we're going to spend all this money and time building a studio, this to me is the most important thing. We should also point out that yes, right now it just looks like an extra mic laying around.

Speaker 1:          00:15:47       We're going to dress it up. Okay. It's going to have its own arm, couldn't have the label, are going to note for today for episode one it's merely a Mike, but this will soon have the appearance of of special of royalty basis. This is really going to be something else and hopefully we will on it's on the arm, will be able to pass it over to the guests and share it with one another. So I was a little upset because we usually, we don't record the show this early usually, but we woke up this morning and Tom had such great fart at home. I had a really, I took a disgusting shit last night. Yeah, I had, well I had an Omelet for dinner and then I watched the national championship game, uh, and uh, Bart and Arie came over. So last year we went to, at this time they came over to the house. I don't drink normally, I'm boozing it up cause I got this booze bag friend over and you know what I mean? And he was like pouring scotch to the rim of a glass. I was like, what are you doing man?

Speaker 1:          00:16:52       So anyways, that's sitting in my stomach and I had to take a dump at like midnight. Really? Where did you shit in our master and our bedroom downstairs. Downstairs. Oh Wow. Bold. I know. And then I, um, got up this morning, well you woke me up to be fair with the fart and then I had a few and then I was like, Ooh, this is not going to be, but it upset me that we didn't have the Fart Mike at home. Oh, it upset me that we waited so late to do this show. We should have been doing this show at six 30 in the morning. You know, I, sorry guys. That's the new call time. That's when it starts to happen. So you're throwing money out the window. It's true. That could have been on Fort Mike. It's very true. So the good news is we had a lot of bean dip while you're watching the game.

Speaker 1:          00:17:35       I'm hoping that there's still some farts in me from last night. We stopped at Starbucks, so let's hope that all that is going to create, I want to make a point here. This is a, an amazing studio. This, yeah. Um, you know, we're going to do, by the way, a behind the scenes, um, tour of everything, right? [inaudible] band and we'll, we'll, we'll show everybody all the ins and outs like to what level? Everything was built out. This is better audio. It's better video. It's all that stuff. But it's still your mom's house. And one of our listeners actually made a, um, a quick, your mom's house. Super Cut. Do you know who built it? Uh, Caleb is a Caleb. I Dunno. I'm asking God. No, I forgot. I forgot to look it up. Okay. All right. It's all very cold in here. I know you're happy about that. I'm happy about that. But uh, can we take a look at this? Uh, this is pretty cool. What he built here. All right.

Speaker 9:          00:18:33       Mona. Julia woke up so morning just wanting to say, can I change the locks on your doors? You want to move in? You come move here. Please don't ever go back in the past. I know, cause I need to be fucked a lot man. And I understand when having sex with a gun in the ass hole. Disgusting is nothing compares to in front of jail, homeless, not take fucking 30 Benadryl want at night. I'll make you feel like a woman or man after you experienced an enormous amount, even know who your ex boyfriend is just home, Ya know? You know what I'm saying? Let's go pull a tribe and a curse, but I want to fuck you pretty bad to get blowjobs and try it out. You're gorgeous. Let's go have some fun and let's get physical. Fuck me. I have a good day, mother fucker.

Speaker 10:         00:19:27       Find out who made that. That was fantastic. Those are all the gentlemen I forgot about speed and you can add, let me eat you mix. But uh, I forgot about how Ben is real guides sometimes in a bad mood. He's irate. He when, when he goes have a good day, mother fucker. He's alone.

Speaker 1:          00:19:58       Yeah. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. Whoever made that good job. Yeah. Really sorry. I had to see them all together. Like that was kind of jarring all scumbags, you know, celebrate it on this show. Yeah, that's true. Right? It's like, it's a lot really crazy. It is a lot. It's um, it's looking, they're all montage together like that. I think it's fair to say, I mean, I don't want to be like too arrogant, but when you see something like that, we've kind of changed the world. You know? In a lot of ways, giving people a platform to shine that would otherwise just some universe like we've actually helped these guys get. Yeah. Like what

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       if someone right now I was like, yeah, that like some woman is like, God, those guys sound hot. That's true. That'd be Rad. Okay. That probably is true. Probably true. Oh by the way, got to say this. So you guys know our good friends at Saatva have always been a huge supporters of ours, of the show. I talked to them about this and they're onboard and I think it's so awesome that this is going to be a reality.

It's going to be either the loom and leaf memory foam or the actual sock Saatva luxury firm. They're fantastic. And I want to thank Sam for, for doing that very much. Um, can I tell you this credit what early adapters they were to podcasting advertising.

Speaker 5:          00:22:48       They were our first sponsor of your mom's house. And Kudos to them for being so forward thinking. They were awesome. Yeah. I mean they still are, but yeah, that was really cool when they got, um, uh, got involved with this a while back. We have to talk about, by the way, before we move further along that, uh, over the weekend or before the weekend, I think before the holiday week, during our off week so to speak, uh, Louie had a set that was leaked, created this in the sane backlash in the comedy and the chaos. Why is it disturbed me on so many levels? I mean I'm, I'm serious. What, what was the worst? What was disturbing for you? Okay. First of all, the idea that, I mean especially when when people in comedy who know better act like they don't is what it, what bothered me is that this is clearly a workout, right?

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       Like the Guy Theater, it's like at a club in long island that's in governors and long gun and he does like a 45 minute set. It's probably his 15th, 12th to 15th time on stage. Since being offstage for like 10 months. And this is part of the process of how you build material. Like you do these Poppins, and then he'd take that material to clubs and then you work out some dates and clubs and then you take it to a small theater and then a bigger theater. And then for him, he can go even beyond that to an arena. But I'm saying the process is that you remove your feelings about what he's done. You're talking about comedy now, stand up. Now we're going to, you know, we're, we're going to act like the, uh, well, what, what are people saying about them? Let's start there. Well, that's the thing, it's like, first of all, the idea that you're judging a workout set is insane.

Speaker 1:          00:24:48       I get it. If you're from, from the general public and you're going like, what are you talking about? But the point is you do those sets to be kind of reckless. You do that, you speak irresponsibly, and then you figure out, like there's parts that let's say, really don't get a laugh or get an, uh, as you move along or you go too far. All that, that that broke, that didn't ban, and then I'm going to reign it in here and there of course. And then you fit, you reign it in and you kind of go like, okay, well this is how I'll, you know, I'll make these changes. But if you release, I mean you can release the 10th time you've worked out your set. Yeah. So that part's crazy to me that people in comedy are like, Oh, it's this and it's that.

Speaker 1:          00:25:32       It's like, dude, it's not done and you know better. That's sharepoint as a craftsman is someone who's been doing this for 20 years. Of course. What are you talking about? Why are you asking my draft? It's a frustrates draft and that, so that part made me crazy. Then the like, just the need to really beat the shit out of him. His comedy. I'm like, what are you doing? Why are you, why are you doing what you're saying is so people are now saying like, oh, he's so thoughtless. He's acting like an old grumpy man against millennials. And it's like, well, he was always that Pov. Louie hasn't changed his POV at all. It is exactly like, yeah, here's what makes me crazy. Somebody, if you go, there's people who go like, I've never found that guy funny. I've always said he's not funny. Okay. You don't have to like everybody that makes sense.

Speaker 1:          00:26:23       There's, I'd have, but people who are like, I was a big fan and now, now I heard this and now I hate him. I'm like, what are you talking about? Like it's the same sensibility. It's the same guy doing the same type of material. He's done it. It's like vintage Louis the same thing except now, you know, something so weird and dark about this person. Yeah. And can you still know that and, and like him. And I think what's interesting, and if you look back at all the artists, a lot of people that you've loved have been colossal pieces of shit. If you look at, well, Hey r Kelly who's inside guys now, right? The crazy stuff he's done. And can you listen to his music? Elvis Presley was banging on the syllabi. Presley who was 15 years old, Jerry Lee Lewis marries his 13 year old cousin.

Speaker 1:          00:27:12       To be fair, all those guys way bigger pieces of Shit, right? Like not even close. Right? But I'm saying can you separate the man from his work? And that's always the big philosophical debate. I personally like on the comedy side of things, listening to that and then hearing people purposely deliberately tried to characterize it as a alt right, right. Right now they're like, oh, he's a old washed up hack. What are you talking about? Like even, and here's the thing, it kind of shows you that if you decide to frame something as such and start telling people and they people go along with it, then it becomes a truth. It's like trailers. It's like when they were recording trailers with different music, like the shining and making it a comedy. It really is about Lens and point of view and framing except that here's the 10 here's the thing.

Speaker 1:          00:28:09       In this situation, like I, not in all situations, but in this situation I'm actually so well informed on a subject that I can't be swayed to believe something that isn't true. Like I am so well informed of how this works and what I'm listening to them, what I'm seeing that none of the, you know, um, opinions of others can make me see something that isn't there. Yes, I agree with you. There is not a hackey premise. Like what happens is people are going like, oh, he said like, uh, uh, these kids today are so crazy. And it's like, well if you frame it that way, then that's the premise. But if you listened to it and you actually hear what was said, you realize it was a much richer concept layered. Yeah, of course. And here's what I will say too, is that yeah, we all know what he did.

Speaker 1:          00:29:06       It's not right. Then it added that I listened to the whole hour and I laughed and I haven't had, cause he's hilarious. I'm telling you, and I know, I see Camila time aside from you and a handful of our friends, nobody makes me laugh. And I was like, this is, Oh, I'm so glad that he's back and I really fucking like it. And you know, you struggle with that. You Go, can you separate what the man did from the stuff he does, the work he does. And Hey, I'll tell you why he's fucking funny enough that I think I can. Yeah, I think I'm pro dammit. He's talented. And I was like, can I tell you something else? Nobody is funnier when they got nothing to loose and Louie has lost everything. And I think it's made him fucking way funnier when you're like, well, he said it.

Speaker 1:          00:29:50       He goes, what are you gonna take away my birthday? Fuck you and I love it bothers me. I it, they're like, you know, he's, he's had to like, you can't act like, just because other people have suffered that he hasn't, like the idea that this year has been just a peach for him is, is ridiculous to me. Yeah. No, it's like they're like, yeah, but what about the, I mean, you could still respect that there's other people that have been affected and still say like, it's not like this year has been chill for him. Like you've been publicly shamed. You have two teenage kids who see this and see you all the time. Do you think that's fun? But they're like, let's still kick the shit out of him for his workout set. Like what is going on right now? He's really taking it, taking it. I don't agree with it.

Speaker 1:          00:30:43       I don't like it. But I do want to point something out aside from the, unless you had something else that I was just thinking too, like when did it, when did we become such a bunch of fucking sissies that you like, you can't have sympathy for a group or you can't have real life feelings for somebody for a group and yet still make fun of them. Like what happened to that? You know what I'm saying? For instance, Joan Rivers, her husband was deaf, right? And so she would make jokes about deaf people. And just because you joke about it doesn't imply that you don't have sympathy for that group. Do you know what I mean? Like, well, we can joke about things that he might still feel sympathy for. Need something to do it all the time. But right now I'm saying people don't have that distinction in their minds.

Speaker 1:          00:31:25       They think as you make fun of it, that you're an, you're an asshole. You're not proline. Everybody who gets it gets it. In other words, people reasonable, they get that. And here's the other thing that people that don't get it, the only thing that's making us go like, what the fuck is wrong is that you hear them because they have, we all share this like these platforms. So you see them going like, what's wrong with you? How could you make fun of that deaf person? You know? And so because you ingest their nonsense, you go, oh my God, everything's fucking, my hands are numb. But what I was going to say, it's fucking kiss. My face is frozen too. It just, uh, let me put on my jacket. No, you know what's, what, here's my theory on these people that come out against the dark comedians, these social justice warriors.

Speaker 1:          00:32:14       To me, I'll tell you what the theory is. I think these guys are so afraid of their own dark sidedness. They're so afraid of the demons within them that they're going to call it out in somebody else. I you, you're bad. You're sinful. It's just like the preacher who's hating the gaze and not, you know, the homosexuals are going to burn and it's the same guy who was blowing other guys in the bathroom stall and doing crystal meth. Right? Like Ted Haggard. I gotta say you usually don't say anything smart, but I think you're pretty off the chill in the air. It's really chill in the air is making your brain work. Okay. I'm serious though. I tell you what, these fuckers that are co Colin Louie out, first of all, for those of you don't know it, standup comic code, it is just an unspoken code that you don't Shit on another dude for what they're doing creatively.

Speaker 1:          00:33:00       You don't Shit on other comics, end up not understand that we can critique on your personal life, but it is nobody's fucking business and free. And for people to call the general public become it's code. You never fucking do it. And the fact that these guys are doing it, it's I think despicable and it goes against everything creative. And there you go. There I fucking said it. Yeah, I just got, dammit. I was bothered by it. I think we're both potter. Do we have a minute? Oh yeah. So yes. What I wanted to talk about it was, it was so fucking funny the other day when you were telling me, Oh, I hear so much. Yeah. So what was going on? And you're like, I'm really having, oh, I was having anxiety about the baby and he was getting sick or something and I went to have dinner or we're going away and you're like, I just, you know, I just feel it.

Speaker 1:          00:34:00       I'm worried about the baby. I'm like, I don't think he's really sick. He's been coughing. I got to go to the dot. No, we just had a cold. But I in my mom brain, I'm like, oh fuck, we gotta go to the doctor again tomorrow. I hope he's okay. I hope it's not the croup, blah, blah, blah. And then I'm like, and I look to you for comfort and, and you go here, watch this. This'll, this'll cheery up. No, I just go, you gotta see this? Gotta see this. I set up my phone, I give it to him. Like, watch this, watch this. And it's the, uh, the trailer for us, the new Jordan Peele movie, you know, is that a Romcom instead of a jaunt? It's good for anxiety. Sure. Because especially about your children. Yeah. Perfect. It's um, but the, the trailers amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:34:46       And uh, I was, I was pretty stoked. He takes a, I got five on it, the loonies track from the 90s and slows it down. And so it sets this tone for this deeply disturbing thriller. And then you were like, what the fuck are you making me watch this for? I said, I'm anxious. I think the one thing you don't give somebody when they're anxious is a horror movie trailer. No. It really made me laugh about like losing your kids and stuff too. I'm like, it was pretty great. It was pretty great. It would be like here, watch the new Jodi foster movie on. I can't do this shit man. Thank you for doing that. Tom, you always know how to really make me feel good. You are welcome. Well look at gene, so excite. We should take a moment and we'll be back with great guest

Speaker 11:         00:35:38       right after these words. Your mom's house. We'll be right back. All right, and we are back. All right, pretty good and we're back with an all timer, a hall of Famer. First ballot. I'm you so excited. We're so excited that you're here. 11 your voice goes love when your voice that you're octaves and pitch change, but we're also not just excited that you're here to show you stuff, but we're also so excited to announce that you are going to be doing an additional you only you know you don't work hard enough or we have thrown your way. Yes, you're going to be doing a podcast out of here on our second set that we have here. Let's be fair. We should we be calling it a podcast. It's a youtube, it's a full on extreme. They, all this stuff you have here, it's going to be deployed for that.

Speaker 11:         00:36:31       Let's call it a pod for the moment. Sure. A show. It's a show. It's a show. It's a show. Um, that we, here's the cool thing. We, we respected that when you first came on it was just like, hey, would you come on? And it was, I was fans of both you guys. That's very nice. And I, and I kind of knew what your mom's house when I did not know what I was going to be subjected to, nor did I know what a sadist your wife is. So enjoy my discomfort or that the audience would really enjoy. Well, it's your audience. So I think the discomfort, I think we enjoy having a professional opinion on what's going on. To be fair, not just the clips, but I was uh, I was reflecting today when I was thinking about coming over here and how joyous I was and they were, and sort of, I wanted to congratulate you guys.

Speaker 11:         00:37:18       I'm excited for you. You have the opening volley with these guys was does far to push stool out or not. This is why we have you on the show. And I thought, wow, so here we are. Here we are. We're coming full circle that your medical degree, Oh, I've been to radio long time and sort of nothing surprises me. However that moment stayed with me, puts the shit out of shits, push the farm and then we played for you a tons of funny clips. Funny. Yeah. So, um, funny. That was funny, right? The guy that was a snake bite biting it. I didn't get to see none of that was just audio. Okay. Yeah. He's just, he's just funny. People's misery is funny, right? That what I'm supposed to eat seriously reflecting on all this this morning. The other thing. The other thing is, aside from your ugly at my discomfort, the other thing was Tom's genuine joy at people's misery.

Speaker 11:         00:38:21       He was like, yes, yes, this is joyous. And it was that, that likes a layer of discomfort on me that I almost couldn't tolerate it. So that's where the discomfort really goes over the top and I came back, I've made maintain friendships and, and not only that, I'm going to be a part of this, this shift pirate ship. Well, here's the thing I wanted to like in summary is that you came on, you didn't know what to expect, uh, the audience. So loved having your voice in this world. And then that's what led to the idea of like, what if you did a show here where it, it's a little mix up of like, you know, speaking of things that you want to talk about your in your own lane, commenting on clips from the show, which seems to be like a really fun thing to happen.

Speaker 11:         00:39:10       And then talking to some people to hold that comedian. Yes. Deconstructing them. Oh my God. After dark dude, I love it. That's what it's going to be. All the fun that you're talking about. Sex, drugs and rock and roll and crazy comedians. And I want you to psycho analyze all the comments. I'll do the best I can. So fascinated by that. Is it your own stuff and your husband now? Yes. I'm fascinated by human beings and I just thought about how we is my voice in this world is that, what'd you say to them in this world and this world and this world. And it is a, it is an alternative universe over here and you should know that your fans are quite enthusiastic. Yes. I was at a MTV movie awards. Did I tell you this story? And a woman flew out of the booth to like, I had just gone over and gushed at, uh, what's the kids name?

Speaker 11:         00:40:06       That shit's creek. Uh, it's, I don't know. Shit's creek is a great show here. Oh really? I don't like many comedy. Uh, Dan, I forget his last days. He's there anyway. And the Levy Dan Levy, it was gushing over at him is, he's the other ones. What's The dad's name? Eugene. Eugene's Day. The Dad and uh, and I was just gushing at him and then I was literally nearly tackled by one of your fans who was like a 35 year old female. I mean, not exactly what I expected, right? Of attractive 35 year old female who like, who, who seemed sane but was behaving insane. And I say this with peace and love, peace and love, peace and love. She was one of the lovely woman would not leave. I couldn't get enough like wanting to be a part of this world. We encourage that you, you did it him, if anybody sees drew body camera guy wasn't bothersome.

Speaker 11:         00:41:03       It was not bothered. She was, she was much like Christina. I was an observer of this human behavior and thinking, wow, this is a different world, but I become a part of and I better double down on our show on it. Our fans, let's put it this way, they have transformed Garth Brooks is social media, right? Tommy, what did you say? That we've taken over? We've take things by storms. So just be prepared but not be, there's, look, there's limited time with you and there's a lot of money. Here's what I want to, first of all, I want, I want to be your videos. Yeah. Yeah. So here's what I wanted to, uh, so this has been the latest like thing that blew up on the show and to set it up. I'd love to get your whole thought on this. Okay. So here's what happened. I feel like here's the setup. Let me just tell you. Okay. I feel like somebody who like either like needed major dental work, like revisions in their mouth going in. Now again, I'm like, okay, here we go. I'm used to this, but don't start drilling. I love it. Okay, so, so are like a cancer patient, get testicular cancer has getting chemo and going, Oh God, you're right. All right. Here we go. So I just went like, okay, I want to give you the setup because it makes more sense this way. Here's the setup

Speaker 5:          00:42:29       man. Was that the gym? Is that this guy? Yes. Okay. He was at the gym and he sees an attractive woman. Okay. Leaving the tanning room at the gym sees that she had signed in at the sign in sheet. Was this pre or post to be too? This is pre. Oh, so there should be a few years. But he's, he signed, he sees her sign in, so he knows her name. Okay. Okay. So when what he does with his, he's think he's on the spot. He goes, you know what, I'm going to follow her out into the parking lot. And he says her name. Do you want to be listeners and viewers?

Speaker 11:         00:43:03       No, he's behaving like one. Right. This is pretty nice. It's pretty, oh, advance keeps going. That's where your listeners cut off and the right videos began. That's right. So this guy

Speaker 5:          00:43:16       sees her, he calls out her name. Her name's Julia. And she thinks that because he knows her name, that we must be let me show. She's like, yes. And he's just tells her like, Oh, you know, I saw you here, blah, blah, blah. I'd like to take you out. Sometimes. She's like, well, I'm kind of thinking about getting back with my ex, you know, he's like, how about just dinner? Uh, can I have your number? And she goes, how about I'll take your number and one of those movies. And she shows her phone, cause it's in her hand. He puts in his number and dials himself, has her know. So, but that's where she goes, thanks. Good night. And then she goes home and the next morning she wakes up and this has been texted to her number, this video. And is she, she the one that sent this to you? Well, eventually it yet, but yes, we're listeners. And then we ended up meeting her and getting the story. But so I just wanted to get your take on this as a hello

Speaker 11:         00:44:22       as a, I met you yesterday or their body fluids involved. Julia. Just me. Joe just wanted

Speaker 9:          00:44:32       to say hi. Wish you a great day. Tell you that meeting you yesterday and getting a look at you was probably one of the greatest moments of my life. You were so beautiful. You don't know how beautiful you are to me. I mean just, you're gorgeous. You're precious.

Speaker 11:         00:44:51       There's more perfectly normal. Perfectly okay. Does he pull the gun up to his head? You're going to, you're going to go out with me or else,

Speaker 9:          00:45:01       but it's been sitting in my mind when you said to me, you want to go back with your ex boyfriend, please erase him from your memory. Don't ever go back in the past. I know, cause I've been there and I understand when you know you're trying to find somebody and you go on dates and nothing compares to Eurex but there is that better person out there and Giulia, I promise you it is me.

Speaker 11:         00:45:27       Perfectly normal. Perfectly natural. Does he hasn't threatened to kill the boyfriend? Yeah, that's okay. It's just pillow like you've never been loved before. I will cherish you. I'll make you feel like a woman, a real woman. I believe me. After you experience mate, you won't even know who your ex boyfriend is. Here we go. We're going down. We're going

Speaker 10:         00:45:49       down.

Speaker 9:          00:45:53       He these is this all one video. One video, but it's chopped up. Okay. Put up your heart to make in your ARVs. Let's go full throttle. I could see me falling in love with you. It just so I don't know. I just looked in your eyes and I just melt.

Speaker 11:         00:46:09       Oh yeah. So he's still open the pathetic zone. Okay. Okay. I feel bad. What are you waiting for? You're waiting for it to cross into. Well, hold on. So I'm expecting, I'm heading off. I'm expecting either some sort of totally sexually inappropriate move, which then will get disgusting or some sort of threat of violence.

Speaker 10:         00:46:30       It's expecting one or the other. So both are possible. Right? So if I were this woman, I'd be like, Oh, Jesus Christ. Paul cops are called the MCI. Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:46:46       Okay. Anyhow, I've had an off to work. This is my cute little home. Everything you see behind me, I built everything every square inch from crown mold into chair rail, the floors to lighting, to plumbing, doors, windows

Speaker 11:         00:47:03       speaking, have lighting. Does he have like some special like Instagram lighting in his kitchen? Did you see that? Yeah, they looked like pretty well, like weird. The weird lighting. Okay. Pretty unique. Yes. Do you want him to work on your own? No.

Speaker 9:          00:47:15       Does the type of guy, again, I'm a very handy guy and uh, I'd love to build you. Whatever you want. Oh, you're a sweetheart. So I hope this video doesn't scare you. Oh, sorry. How I feel sorry, dude, I just want you to that. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 11:         00:47:30       Now I look forward. I'm going out to dinner with you, so let's make it happen. Nah, dude, I'm so sorry. What do you think's going on with this guy? What's going on? What do you think's going on this layered? What's, what's wrong with you man? Peace and love. Peace and love. I don't know this guy. I don't know you sir. I don't know you sir. I don't mean to disparage you, but laughing. You guys don't understand something. You now have your physician on your platform. Liability comes with that piece and a law of peace and love. This is strictly in analysis based on a video and not knowing this man, but I mean, it's a kind of a narcissism, right? I mean, it's a, it's a, it's not really processing reality in that reading social cues. You worry that it flips into sociopathy where she's just an object for him. And so, you know, it doesn't really, yeah. Mattered to him. What she's thinking or feeling because he's decided she's the one now his defense. How would you say this guy is? This guy was probably 45 really? Yeah, I was hoping. So 27 well, I, you should know there's lots of this going on in the twenties really? Yeah. Lots of stock. This is stalking behavior essentially. Socking as always. There's no needles. They because they were you happy with this is fascinating.

Speaker 11:         00:48:59       So, so he, I have to breathe deep in this place. I love this house. Um, they are not doing normal sort of dating. They don't, they don't form and break relationships normally during adolescence. Right. We'd normally, you have them and break them and have them and break them and you date none of that. It's all sort of hooking up and hanging out. And so when they actually developed sort of a real attraction or an attachment to somebody, they don't know what to do with it. They don't know how to navigate that. A manager. So we get a lot of people going, males 27 or more like 25 going, uh, well I met the girl might, I met her at the girl of my dreams and we went out and she wouldn't so into it, but uh, that was just there and you know, she was, she didn't understand it.

Speaker 11:         00:49:43       So we became friends and we're good friends and I've been waxing her car and cleaning. Yeah. Carpet the last two years. And now it's time. And those two years I've been stalking. Right. Wow. He's hanging out stalking weight and now he's like, now you need to it's time. Well, can I tell you the full story now? Oh No. So he followed her. Oh, she found out where her ex lived. So it was real stock. And then he disemboweled that man on the freeway in New Jersey. No, just in your head please let it go. Let it, let us see where I go with [inaudible] to lie to somebody and let you believe that. Horrible.

Speaker 11:         00:50:30       It's like, that's my dad. No, I don't have the heart to torture you. I like, my husband didn't know that. That didn't happen the last, but he did send a few more videos. He, yeah, she was, she able to get rid of him. Now he is aware of his creepiness because at one point he goes, I hope this doesn't scare you. Like there's an awareness there is and it, but it's a dismissing of it. Right, right. It's like it's like you, you wouldn't, of course you wouldn't be, you know, you're not scared by me. Of course I, because it's me and I hope it doesn't do it because it won't anyway. Cause it's me. It's, yeah. And the duration of this stuff and the, so let me ask you then for a word to me, I get very sad when I see a car. He said usual when I watched your what?

Speaker 11:         00:51:15       See, this is why we're interesting. So when I see people get run into in a garage and their legs get cut off, I feel bad when I see this guy. Right. You're, you're, your production staff has probably never seen us in action cause they're laughing their asses off. He goes like this. I feel bad for them because, you know, it's interesting, I was listening to podcasts. Are you saying they're all like the persuasion has become a really hot topic lately I think because of Trump and that's all he's doing is using persuasion and uh, and people go, you must got to take other people's point of view. Let's see the point of view when I go, no, that's all I do all day is I try to put myself in there literally in their shoes, in their body and feel it not, not invade their body or be overtaken by it, but to really try to understand what that is. Sure. And so I automatically see this guy and I just, Oh, poor dude. Oh man, it's so bad. So bad. So sad. Desperate. Right. I ruined it. I ruined the whole thing. Now is even funnier. We've actually gone back.

Speaker 11:         00:52:19       Good Morning Julia, which is how this starts. God, let me ask you this. True for the women listening because I in my twenties had guys like this too who didn't seem to understand boundaries and that I wasn't interested. How should a woman deal with something like the guy to fuck them? You got a fucking guy. I was going to say that I let them know [inaudible] go get out of here. So that when you were going to say, sorry. No I was going to say from just very firm but non amo, not hysterical or emotional I think and, and, and then that'll ramp it up. Well any contact ramps it up, right. So you have to be firmed, deliberate, swift and sure. And then no more contact cause any contact.

Speaker 11:         00:53:07       How about a deliberate text back? Like let's say girl gets this kind of video, what is the text back to the texting or emails that kind of is a good idea because you have a documentation and just say any and really make it any further contact. Here is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna contact the FBI and the local police. You are freaking me out. I'm sorry. It'd be kind but firm at free and clear in no cracks in the wall cause they will exploit any crack and any future and they will escalate it. So no blowjobs nothing. Don't, sorry Tommy. I know, I know it worked for you a couple of times. That's why they keep doing it cause it keep working. Right. So um, oh okay. Yeah. So we've been really fascinated by Garth Brooks. And I want to tell you, oh, I here.

Speaker 11:         00:53:50       Okay. I'm not sure I understand why. And by the way, it's not that we're, we're not shitting on his music or his talent. It's nothing. Yeah. He was super talented guy who's unbelief has an unbelievable fan base, right? Yeah. But he has a dark side. I think so. And I also think that he has this really disconnected, um, sense of like how to interact with, right. So, so the, so Garth book, the human being is probably different than the guy. See what the hat up there on the day probably carefully protected that they manage. Right? Right. That's for your evil because of this like country music fan base where it's like, oh shucks, I just like it bacon pie with my daughters.

Speaker 11:         00:54:39       I think something, boom, here's the thing, the cracks in his real self show in these, so obviously his team was like, you need to be on social media and he's probably reluctant. I don't know if you've ever seen the initial, do you have when he, I've not, I've not gone down the Garth Brooks prep. Okay. With you. You have the initial announcement that he's joining Facebook or no, is that Qta I don't have that. You don't have that? Okay. Well then this, I want to see this. This is not well here. Well, this is a, okay, so this is, he has inside studio g, which is, uh, like his behind the scenes look for the fans where it's a studio and it's access to, you know, here's where it works. Stuff out, always with a smile. Everything's always glorious. Every, I'm always in a good mood, everything's great.

Speaker 11:         00:55:24       And his wife is Tricia. Tricia, or can you do this thing? Oh, oh, oh Jesus. Oh dear. Your cod. As she's doing that, she's very hard question. I don't know why women, but as he doing this segment for his, like behind the scenes show, I think it's like his Facebook channel or something. Uh, a door opens. Oh, he's just so we get to it. Like what was the Welsh guy's name that was on the Golden Globe with a heavy accent? Yeah, Christian Bale. Notice my name finding as I get older. Sorted your best Christian Bale, like a Christian Bale moment where we screams at the staff. Remember that? You'll see, you'll see certain, yeah. Let me just say, unfortunately what I'm seeing, just looking at the picture here, peace and love, peace and love. I don't know. Garth Brooks, a little bit of what we call Plethora Ra. I'm gonna pull through a little bit of little Billy, a little bit of parotid and large, maybe some booze maybe. Let's see. Okay, so here's this clip. Let's take a look at. Nothing wrong with that. Yeah, no, I know. I just don't want to say, yeah. Let's see. Let's take a look at this clip, but you just looking at this point, it's a small, small moment. I just want to get your thought. All right. Very subtle. So I got, is that supposed to happen? [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         00:56:51       happy birthday. Do you think he murdered whoever knocked on the door or no, he would have a, we're not a birthday. We'll be that. We'll look at that. That's what I'm talking about. Dart. Dart. That's supposed to happen. The rage, the quiet at a very, very good seething rage that's supposed to happen and that wasn't good this time. Last time was more, we'll do it again. Does that supposed to have, there we go. Yeah. Yeah. But you sense it too, right? Like he's seeding blink, SOS, Christina [inaudible] problem at all. He's just blank. I'll be her pretty tired. We every week on Friday. Okay. Um, no. Yeah, that's uh, okay. So he's got an aggressive side to him that we didn't know that for sure. Just check, check guy. But to be fair to him, I mean, he's like, he's like a crazy superstar. You know what I mean?

Speaker 11:         00:57:46       Who knows what he's used to and can't tolerate it. Maybe he's tired and so I'm willing to just go. Maybe that was a moment. Maybe I really like that. Does he smoke cigarettes now? But sometimes he'll talk real sexy and some of his voice, so he does other gutter of the fried. It's going to ask you tube. Have you heard of his alter ego? Chris Gaines. Oh my God, what is this? You don't know that. That's the Goth version. So he did this thing for a while where he put on a different persona called Chris Gaines where he was kind of golf looking and he even Photoshop his face to be thinner and gaunt and more and more sensitive and it was, it wasn't, I don't think its fan base appreciates it as much as they appreciate what gets it back story for it so that like Chris Gaines, his parents died when he was young.

Speaker 11:         00:58:31       Oh my God. So He's, he's trying to capitalize, he wants to be like a grunge artists. He went for it and he put out an album as this and then he nearly wiped the Internet clean of it after he decided not to do it anymore. It's pretty interesting. You guys have tapped into something. I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I think you found something for here. Does he have a civilization on the backside of the moon that Chinese are going to dig in mind? Let's, let's talk. He's Tom for his latest towards stadium, but he's a huge superstar. Yeah, that's a big deal. It's pretty wild. Right? And you don't know. We really don't know what that does to people. Right. But that's the thing is I think a big, like a big part of what we're picking up on with him and being kind of just weird is that I can't imagine what that level of fame does to you.

Speaker 11:         00:59:22       It just will. Especially there, there's sort of a confluence of factors is the kind of person that seeks that kind of fame. The kind of person that we as a society elevate to that kind of paint, paint, fame and then what it does to them. This was a confluence of factors. It's now it's not the fame itself, right? It's that seething rage. It was already there. I'm just saying. And the intolerance is probably, you know, just the overworking and the alcohol and whatever else. Where else, I dunno. Pills, whatever. You know, I feel like I've got, um, the insult dog behind you. What, what is this is for pup play. It's not sexual. That's not sexual at all. You seen those people that they wear masks and then they pretend to be dogs and smell each other's butts. But it's not, it's not sexual. It's just a, hey, I see that.

Speaker 11:         01:00:08       Please Tom, may I please you want to see this? I want to see that because we have seen furries and I imagine this is sort of a furry part, but when you got to the sniffing of this, but Christina, maybe that's your version of the dog. Do you have a dog mass clip? Uh, well on my show you'll have to tune into my show. I will, I will. I will, uh, look into this and maybe we should have a dog, but play every week, maybe something like that. They have a theme or professional counsel on this as well. The other day I was experiencing some anxiety on the drive home from dinner with my husband. You know the baby was sick was when we all went out to dinner. Oh my God, we're stuck with this guy. And I was like, Gosh, you know I'm experiencing anxiety and he goes, here, watch this. It's really good. It's really good. This is this, by the way, does Susan know you're putting out like you're doing webcam stuff alone? Is this you? This is me. Is that not you? It could be. Let's see.

Speaker 12:         01:01:15       You wouldn't be required to make daddy call.

Speaker 11:         01:01:19       What she recorded me. I didn't know. I didn't put it up. She did it

Speaker 12:         01:01:23       be done in a way, but you want to do either with your body or a friend of yours that's a girl that you can sell with picture and saved that he stroke to her.

Speaker 11:         01:01:35       Yeah, normal. Perfectly natural. Does it. Perfectly healthy. But he reminds me of like a Spiderman evil villain. He's like w w like I wonder what he's like. I would love to see him in his real life. You know what I mean? That's the part that I find fascinating. Like, this is such a, this, I guarantee you this piece of him is something that he puts way out over here. He had denies it exists. Oh, right. Then he goes through his life as a bank president. Right. You know what I mean? And then what is that doing that compartmentalize and partly it's trauma. It's true that this traumatized piece of himself that comes out in once while needs, needs attention, but he's like, it's detached though. It's disconnected. Trauma is morphed into a sexual as it is. Oh, is that right? It's one form or not.

Speaker 11:         01:02:21       I mean, let's put it this way. I'm sorry guys. It always has a, let's put it this way. I'm not saying there's a direct correlation between trauma and sexual fetishes. I'm saying that when you're traumatized and naturally it affects important parts of your life, like your sexuality. Right? And so especially when you have a cutoff part of yourself that may be injured and dysfunctional, I don't know what's there. That need is aggressive and angry and whatever, so it'll act itself out. Wow. Hey, good time man. It didn't seem like the healthiest message to put out. Right. Did this, uh, alleviate your anxiety? You saw this trailer for a horror film? It's a Jordan peals new movie. US that, that trailer just what do you think of that? Does that like Asperger's where he doesn't read the social cues or cues, how to document these things?

Speaker 11:         01:03:07       Because one day there will be a court case and child custody will come with the question, so you're going to need this. Just keep that licensed physician list. What? You know what's interesting? The last I was trying to show her that trailer all day, so I was like, you have you seen the trailer? And then that dinner, I was like, have you seen the trailer? And then we were in the car and I was like, you got to see it. And then when I showed, she was like, I'm anxious. Oh He's speaking of which can I hit burden my show immediately I sort of created bird. Do you know this? You don't know this. What do you mean the first time you told them that him? Of course he didn't do that. But the first time he told them the machine story was on love line.

Speaker 11:         01:03:51       I made him come back the next night and tell it again. Really? He said I should go out and tell this story in public. And he's, that was his career began when you ask it. If that's not the case. That's true. And I love him in the certain kind of way and I wonder his podcast to it. We should, I should go over and do his and promote all this stuff. Fantastic. I mean, we should all go over there and do it or something. That'd be great last night and drank a lot. He drinks. It was neat because most pieces of Tobar I have a, I have scotch or bourbon and a, you know, put it in a nice, they're like nice glasses for it. Yeah. And uh, you know, usually it's like halfway kind of pores have it serve. He would then he would do it poor and do it to the rim of the glass. Oh my God. Of the necks of the niceness and glad is rough. That is rough. I don't know.

Speaker 11:         01:04:49       There's a man that puts the car, the call out for somebody to be his baby daddy thing. Yeah. And then what's the woman like who, who's answering the call? It is also somebody injured who wants to explore to make money from injured men. It's a prostitutes is going to be somebody. It's somebody who was also compartmentalize, but as I will tolerate it to a certain point and fuck it. I'll just be interesting. And what about women who make fart videos? What's the deal? I could do that. And what's the, you'd be the cake Fart, I think, right? She was sitting in the cakes farting. I know her, right Tom? I got, yeah, I got it. Is it really that wrong? She always sees, you know, sometimes we played uh, like uh, dom videos and like there's this one where they like, they'll, there's some guys who actually like getting kicked in the balls and punching the them really hard to why? Yeah. Have you seen killing eve yet?

Speaker 11:         01:05:46       What's that? Oh, you'll go insane for this killing eve. Wow. It's like a nine part series, but it's what Sandra, Oh, won the golden globe for them. Oh really? Yeah. And it's uh, it is she eve, she's w they're actually in a weird way to Eve's, but she's one of the eaves and the, um, and I can't explain about you're seeing it, but there's a scene where a guy gets his balls clamped and like I said, I don't know. I mean we've, we've watched these for a laugh and it's, it's really crazy to, and sometimes I got to tell you there's, there's a lot of stuff that I just don't fully get what I mean, I'm like, like I don't know that you physically can, can get by or get Polish with. Yeah, me too. I don't quite get it. Every time we've watched these things, she goes, I could do that.

Speaker 11:         01:06:29       I could do, I could, that'd be fun to do it. She expresses show me one, I want to see your reaction. We'll see it in real time. Can you show me once we don't have a week, clearly I have to come back. You have to come back. Yeah. That's another thing for him. Yeah, we actually were having to, my truck is, we're actually running out of time, but there's like, all right, I will be back. I'll be back and come watch my show here on this platform. So we didn't even mention there's a fart Mike here. Mike, if you have a fire. Love it. Did she say my con? Yes, many times. Um, by the way, uh, we had a new hats made or no, if you like these. Oh, I'm not sure Rachel, and I'll let you have that. How did we get those emails working on the, the lights?

Speaker 11:         01:07:20       I think it was Mel. Yeah, the lighting designer worked on a show and he brought these in. So anyways, would you like one or no, it's okay. I want to give him to the fans. Okay. Yeah, we're selling them for like, do I wear the thing all the time. Oh really? Oh cool. You know, the last stand, if I saw you did, you spoke differently about your dad that I've ever heard you talk about? Yeah. Oh yeah. Usually I didn't know. It was funny cause I have Christina's idealised view of your dad, right? Yeah. And you were a little bit more realistic, let's say. Probably closer to I, I'm interested in that too. As time goes on we'll, we'll dig into that a little bit. Dad loved it, but whenever you say, hear me use the word Wunderman, it's, it's that I wonder, I wonder.

Speaker 11:         01:08:10       I'm thinking our money, whatever. Whenever I see right. That's how I know. Cause I've heard you say right, but even you know it, even when you know it, it still works. It still works. It works no matter what. I know it's one of those things. She goes, I have a fantasy that bump up by and I'm like, God dammit. Is that what I'm doing? And then she's great. She gets it every time. So how have you been therapy? 10 years? I did 11 years and I contemplate going back for a psychoanalysis. We love to do that. I'll tell you it. Yeah. Anyway, I've got a great lady I'd like to add or a psycho analysis, but I had to commit to like four or five times a week at staff would want to sit on one of your sessions to see, literally, literally I wrote my therapist and node years later I went, how the fuck did you tolerate that boring bullshit for all those years?

Speaker 11:         01:08:56       That's really no. Nothing like you can be. No, I think they get bored. I'm sure you get bored. I mean, no, cause she, she was very attuned and she's busy attuning to be, and that's what I needed and I'm still like, how did you tolerate all the droll and nonsense for all those years? Just like thank you for just sitting through that because there really wasn't anything to complain about. I have a good life. My parents were shitty. Yes. Oh, that's plenty to complain about. So I did it for 10 years. Yes, I meant, but that's how long it takes to get into that. I know. And I had sort of trauma light compared to what some people experience, you know what I mean? So, yeah. But don't. Don't minimize your trauma. Thank you Tom. Thank you Allen. But we celebrate trauma on this show.

Speaker 11:         01:09:38       Oh yes you do. Yes you do. Is there more video from me? Is there one more? I don't know it come. Daddy is, was that it? Well we want it to be cognisant of your time. I'm kind of running out and stuff but I'll come back to do we have two on the w on the books now? We got to do already. Yeah. There's a couple of things we definitely have to show him when he comes back. We've got to get deep into the dog thing cause I think, well the smell, it has a smell. It's important. Talks about smell and creating your own smell too. Like smell like Jesus, stop. I'll get to see this. But top was so gross.

Speaker 11:         01:10:13       When you finger on the crack, gas does smell it. Okay, so on these matters, that's different. That's a guy. What's he saying? That's only smells. Okay. He's, he's having anal sex with a woman pulls out and there's some shit on his day and then she's like, I don't want to do it anymore. He goes, it's only submit. It's just okay to get her to keep doing it. It just, it just speaks volumes about men. That is his kneecaps could be bleeding out, falling out. He'd be like, it's just, just keep going. You go and they do keep going. That's the amazing thing. He really, to me the more amazing part is not him but the woman that he's going like, what the hell? We also have clips of delusional men who are like missing teeth and clearly disheveled in, they're like, I want a virgin. I want a woman who 120 pounds only the best for me and what is wrong? Can you play for him real quick to see is like a minute, just today's opening clip. Just the first just to get him like [inaudible] properly. Well, just to see like what would you think is going on with this guy? I mean like whenever you open with that Tom, I get a shutter down my spine. What's going on with this guy? I just want to see what's going on. Yeah, go ahead.

Speaker 6:          01:11:31       All Yo beautiful women. You feel me? This let me eat you. One term is, let me eat your one time and you go, I guarantee you you're gonna, you're gonna ask me to stick to your house. You go here, you go to sleep for three days. My baby

Speaker 11:         01:11:47       and he goes on. I love him. He's pretty great, right? I haven't lovely offers to cook and clean. Oh my God, this is just take a bath when you get home. If I were a woman, he'd be Damn fucking bring him. He's my husband. Yeah. How could you not be? It's just overtaken by that and somehow somewhere really put together on buddy actually went for that. That's why he's able to do that. I would like to know who, probably a mirror image. I'm expecting we can find her in your video pile too. But now I'm wondering, I'm really wondering what's going on. Is He, is he on the streets? Do we know? It looks like a, it's kind of like that, right? Yeah, it's a yard somewhere. It's astonishing to me. There's this, this world of skis oid skis to effective schizophrenia, that sort of zone, the things they can believe about themselves and their place in the world is always just, just delusion, delusional and it to me, and it may be subtly delusional, like you can call this settle if you want.

Speaker 11:         01:12:52       Yeah. I call it kind of subtle. Uh, and it's, to me that's just, I just, I just, it's one of the, I have zones, right? Like I can't like process. This is one of those zones. You can't wait. I can't relate because I have low self esteem and I don't feel I feel small and that important and stuff. And to have somebody go, hey man, let's go. I'm the batch, I should be the president. And the truth is you could probably eat somebody real well, but you're just putting out videos like that and maybe hit it. He'd have to like build up to that point where he could actually gauge and said, behavior. Call me crazy, Colby. Fucking crazy. A good, bad for my soul. This is going to be bad for my soul. I know it. That's why I'm having this horrible thought. Like, Oh, what have I done?

Speaker 11:         01:13:36       Why? But this is why I know I've got a problem. Why do they not have teeth? It's always part of it, isn't it? Just on these videos, there's poor lighting and it's what topic did the teeth are missing? It's in a, usually you go, oh, that must be math or coat or something else, but it's not necessarily a drug addiction and it's in that schizophrenia, schizophrenia forms cause while effective and some of these people can be in kind of kind of in the world, they just aren't really in the workplace. Right. You know what I mean? They, they, they may be dependent on somebody and they may kind of look sometimes seminoma and these days they get caps and things and see you. If they have like a family that's taken care of you and you miss the teeth part, but the teeth is a, is a clue. Yes. I think so too. Yeah. How fascinating. Because part of not being in the reality. Right. Right. That I, this is all a mess and, oh, well anyway, let's go eat

Speaker 10:         01:14:28       this trip. Right.

Speaker 13:         01:14:35       We will. A doctor drew, I hope your fans are happy there. This is a, oh, that's fine.

Speaker 11:         01:14:41       That's amazing. And you're going to be here. I'm going, I'm going down. I'm going with them. I'm going, if I need to stop now, please go to Dr Com and give me your thoughts. Absolutely. Yeah. But as now I'm, I'm going with them. And where else, by the way, this, this pod, you can get a Dr. Carr everything. It'd be Dr Com. Yeah. Everything. So Graham, what is it? A doctor drew Pinsky and I'll do some Instagram lives and stuff and maybe we'll do Instagram live like maybe routinely starting these shows. Sure,

Speaker 5:          01:15:08       yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, I just wanted to say that the, uh, the new show he'll be doing will be available as on this youtube channel on Fridays. Um, and it also be available to download if you want to listen to it. And it'll be doctor drew after dark after dark. All right. G, D d a

Speaker 11:         01:15:27       dean, a Di Da Di da Di da Dad. It's going to be the dad bod. Okay. We'll be back

Speaker 13:         01:15:34       talking about floats and Dick's break.

Speaker 5:          01:15:40       So real quick, I know, thank you for sticking around an extra minute or we were about to just jump off. Yep. But, uh, but we couldn't resist one of our producers and, and a great comic and friend Josh Potter. Uh, we were talking about this the other day. Um, Josh, go ahead and tell what happened.

Speaker 13:         01:16:00       Well, uh, so Dr drew, I just want to preface this by saying my first job in radio was born hopping love line really when I was 19, uh, back years ago. Where, what studio? We've had many, many. I worked for one oh 3.3 the edge in Buffalo, New York. Oh, okay. So you were, okay. So you were at one of our affiliates. Yes. I was just bored hopping. Not Yours. It was a satellite. Yes. Have nothing to do. So I listened to the show often and uh, I decided I needed help with something, so I'd call in. Oh. And I called in and told my problem. And then you said, oh boy, another delayed ejaculation call. And then you hung up on me. What happened? What is the one, no, as a person who does radio, I understand why you did what you did. The show needed to move and you need it. I wasn't in control of the phones as well, so it wasn't me. I'm sure. No, I think it producer maybe hung up on it and it's a Corolla. But go ahead. Okay. Yes, no. So I, I never got the ants. All right here we can also, it's still well, yes, yes, yes, of course. Well, no. So I mean it is

Speaker 11:         01:17:10       still an issue and I have not, I have not read it. It is the fact that I can stay, I can maintain, I just go back, go over the top. What's that all about? So I, I'm thinking of it more of a biological thing that people want to make it a psychological thing that you're not willing to be open and free and new. Give of yourself to the person. Kindergarten teacher beat him mercilessly. Okay. Well there's that. Strangely, that's what happened to me. My kindergarten teacher grabbed me and shook me to my babies. Had I could have that done to him and mine kindergarten. They do. We're in the same kindergarten. I'm sorry, back to check on his dick. So, uh, are you ever able to I have like twice. Okay. So what of course went with myself of course. Right. So we did, unfortunately it has to do is bring himself right to the point, has he knows how to do and then include his partner in his head.

Speaker 11:         01:18:01       Then I really think it's, it's, it's, it's very hard to treat. And I think one of the reasons is where her treated cause he didn't so biological, it's just, I, I understand it. The guys that tend to be more on the premature side, it seems incomprehensible, but that's cause that biologist so very different. And uh, there is no, I mean people talk about treatments and things. I've never seen anything that's really very effective other than you got to work, you have to have a steady partner, you have to work with him or her regularly on this. And they have to be sort of willing to kind of go along with it. The big thing would be like a regular partner would probably, I just need someone who can push the right buttons. No, it's actually not that. It's somebody who's willing to watched you or listen to you or or, or have you do what you need to do and then get themselves involved in that in various ways.

Speaker 11:         01:18:48       We've got to start with a coffee date first. I think the video we learned earlier in the show. Send a video. Yeah, maybe with a full on how to and that they are into that. Do you have like really kinky little secret things that you do to get yourself off me? Yeah. No, not at all. I'm pretty mundane. I think I'm very mundane and whatever it is you got to bring that to. Then basically all sex though just ends without you finishing all of it all. All right. It can be very effective. Right, but all like here, every time Tom asks a question about it, so I keep thinking I'm fast, I'm fast. How's this work on fat Super Fan? I understand. I saw that every question you asked children. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, without kids. I'm still just like that, but that's my usual. I'm just, I'm just amazed though. I'm just amazed. I'm saying like, I want if the, if we can get anything out of this show, it's just for Josh to come. So the is it, is it possible you'll have to keep tuning in? Really? This'll be going so well. You help them out. Lead? Nope. No, I don't think with your head. But we talked to him. I'll talk to him. Can we just it, but will you talk through it more? She of course. Okay. I want Josh. Josh line would be that guy.

Speaker 14:         01:20:02       Drudgery.

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       I can't wait someday. That'll be you. One day. My Baby. Can't wait. All right, thanks. Thanks guys. Alright, and we're back. Uh, we have switched out guests. We tossed one into the trash. Oh my God. We picked up another one. This guest is a longtime friend who I would venture to say is even

Speaker 10:         01:20:30       a Sunday.

Speaker 1:          01:20:37       What am I? Good buddies. Good buddies, a great comedian, great podcast or Ryan Aka sickle cell second.

You clarified that it was a pup play mass that could have been a Halloween mask. No, it doesn't look sexual. No, it's just scared. Scared. A couple of friends, that guy. They're nice guys and we just hang out and we put any of these guys, like seven guys would getting cages. We put tales in and then a guy basically trains us, you know, an outside one inside a dominant one in or you got an outside, he's got like a sick outside owner outside the cage. And he commands owner. Yeah, he's an owner but it's not sexual. Again, it's guys to hang out, get to know each other and chill dues that want to just relax bit like I got it.

Speaker 1:          01:22:09       shepherd. You know, you have such a unique accent and no, it's like Mississippi or something like that. But we were, we were going over because Christina doesn't know how to say certain things. Could you tell me, I saw that you did see that? How do you say that word? The mini word. The full version. Miniature. Miniature Mina. Sure. Not Miniature. It's not the queen's English says miniature. What many? A Cha. There was no queen over here. Number one in jeans studio.

I, well, I did get crown a lot from kids in school, like, Hey Ryan, do you have any crowns? And I'm like, [inaudible] 64 of them right there. I'll be like, none of these are crowns. Now pray on, there's a word that I've been saying and correctly that I just figured out. It's dissociation, not disassociation. I've been saying it incorrectly for my entire life. I'll be honest, I don't even use that word. M B, a t I t you know, come back to combatitive. I was saying combatitive instead of combative like you're making, you're going to make me confess on, oh, there's a word where I add that extra eye and it's a all, what the fuck is that? I can't say, Oh, I've got to think of it.

Speaker 9:          01:23:57       It'll come to me. There's one where I add an I to and I'm like, there's not. That's not there. Fuck yeah. We wrote down so bad. It is with ks, plural.

She'll say she has to go home. I told her, I said, I ain't got no guy. I've got no time for that shit because when this digging, it's ready to go, man. And then it's like, how would you say he was probably in his sixties too late fifties he's like talking about the old [inaudible].

Speaker 9:          01:29:52       So we're in the car business. He just citizen. How old are you? 60 we're like quiet for a minute. And I'm like, all right. You know, just kind of like having one of those moments. He told me this crazy story and I'm just quiet and he goes and my, you ever notice when you don't come, how that'll fuck with bitches mind? Oh my God. Like I don't have that problem. Yeah, right. I'm like, yeah, but that's, that's his conversation and then we put the, he's like, have a nice flight. So crazy Tommy. I know. What did you say to all that? I was just laughing and like, or I would, did you record any of it? No. I thought about it then I felt this audio. I know I wanted some audio. He um, I'm sure I'm going to get him again. I'm sure they're going to, if the guys come twice, it's like, it feels like he came twice last night. He gives him old, old bitches.

Speaker 9:          01:30:50       I don't know if he'd go get him a good, he's always told me he sounds like he's just jog. I don't like this shit. He told me that and I was like, that's cool. The guy. Yeah, the guy that's got your life in his hands and the wheels on ain't give a fuck. What? He was like, God, I fuck all that to two shit. All these airbags, bags and shit, man. I didn't have any of that when I was a kid. Let's see what this thing is. Ready to dive right into a semi. Like it's all right when that man, he's a wild dude.

Speaker 9:          01:31:23       I don't give a fuck. I'm not, tonight I'm going to talk for by trade, by trade. He's a second Manco but you have a knack for psycho drivers. Remember the guy they used to pick us up and we lived in Korea town. Yes. He liked to smoke crack. I talked about that dude in a special. How did you find out or drop them? I like to smoke or there were usually actually pretty good. I was going to say they're pretty open. This dude he ran, I mean this is when like, you know, this was like the best option for us at the time for an airport ride because a crack at this, well y'all come long ways to studio genes.

Speaker 10:         01:32:00       So what is that? I get a ride like a car service from crack drivers. So right here guys, I'm proud of you

Speaker 1:          01:32:08       guys, studio g but if you have the, if you need to get to the airport and like in these are flights for like our middle weeks and you know like yeah, start starting to do no money. So he would be, he was for a long time, he was reliable cause I'd be like, I have a flight at 8:00 AM and I need to get picked on. He says, right. Yeah. Um, and I need to get picked up at like six 30 or whatever. And he would be like, I'll be there. I'll be up. Do you know why though? Because he'd already been up partying. It was up a neighbor cause that's where he bought crack. That, that, that neighborhood's really Latino and he won't say the name of the street that I remember. Carondelet yeah, that's right. That name has stuck with me for some, it's such a weird Carondelet. It's actually, I think you could name someone that, yeah, no,

Speaker 10:         01:32:56       you could maybe like use my girlfriend Karen sounds like a first team. All ACC safety or something. The little pockets right then Carondelet he'll shake. It's like corner. Uh, one of the,

Speaker 1:          01:33:15       he drove and he was like, I like, I like these girls. Then we pulled up and there were like young Latin girl. He's creeping up next to him because we were pulling the stop sign he can, cause I liked these. He goes, I love the little brown ones, man. I was like, okay. And he was in his sixties, you know, he's like, oh, I like these little brown ones. Man. I'm really like, okay. And then, yeah, a one time he was a, he's like, you want to, you want to hit like as of what we'd like, he's still driving. But first I thought you're going to say crack and drive us to the airport. He get high as he was driving us running the car service and never asked once if you're okay with that or the smoker. And he was like, I mean, he's like, are you cool or what? You know? And I was like, yeah, don't be a pussy.

Speaker 10:         01:34:04       Then he's like, this shit. You know

Speaker 1:          01:34:12       from like him talking about weed, I'm like, yeah, I'm cool with weed. And he was like, well, it really misses the fucking hardcore stuff and talking about smoking crack, I was like, really? Like you do that? He's like, I mean, every once in a while I'll do all the time. So I was like, oh, you still, he's like, I dabble. You know when it's time to like have some fun, you know, I'll, I'll fucking, I like to just freak myself. I remember he told me that I like to get real high. Just freak out. Looked through the people

Speaker 10:         01:34:36       look likes. Oh I remember. Yeah. We were like,

Speaker 1:          01:34:43       like about, I said, cause I, I'm like, what do you like about smoking crack? What do you enjoy? And he said, I, I get real paranoid and freaked out. And I, I like to look out to people and see his coming. I'm like terrible until this moment. I've never even considered

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       the fact of just the sheer volume of humans on this planet at any given point. The billions of people, a percentage of them probably do like to be scared and freaked the fuck out. And it makes sense. Maybe that's what, maybe that's what the crack addicts are, that percentage of people that really have a high, tall joy that yeah. But also I have a high tolerance for weed, but also I'm a weed smoker. I would smoke my weed of good. Uh, you know, probably two minutes after I dropped y'all off, I wouldn't be smoking weed alive. No, no, no. What I'm saying is this though, do you ever have, you did, does the experience exists for you where you've gotten too high and you're a little paranoid? Yeah. So one of my friends is a daily smoker. You pee, you know people who have like contraptions, like you know, you put this volcano thing and here wait to all of it, this motherfucker and there's like shovels and all kinds of, what are you doing?

Speaker 5:          01:35:53       It's always the newest way to get, and then the weed is never just weed. It's like there's crystals and they said this to the moon and they brought it back and it's got all types of Shit. And then you know, it was in the rain forest and you're like, all right man. It's like you smell it. You're like this unbelievable looks crazy. So this dude, I smoked a little bit and I go, yeah man, I, I'm way too high. I'm kind of freaked out. And he's like, yeah, me too. And I go, I go, don't you smoke every day? He's like, I do this every day. I get, I get to that like paranoid freaked out part. And I go, why don't you hate it? He goes, yeah, but then I liked going back there too, you know? So like I, I hate it while I'm this freaked out and then I go back and I do it again. So he likes to live in that anxious state. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:36:40       Can I tell you say I get it now, now that I think of it, cause you know, I'm just thinking about what you were saying like, you know, were here like done too much acid and you're like, oh I got to hold it together. Do this. Got It. Okay. But whenever you do too many drugs, you have to hold it together and you're just trying to hold together. And it's like all your focus is in holding it together. And there's something freeing about that. It's like when people rock climb or do something dangerous, right? You're so present because you're just trying to hold your shit together. You're in survival and when you're in survival, you're not thinking about bills, your divorce. It's a good point. The children, you're ignoring

Speaker 5:          01:37:11       whatever to smart things today. It's crazy. Do I get a star? Yeah. Well, you have this chart. I'm gonna get you a new hat. The hat comic, right? Yeah. I've got loads of, Oh shit. You got to put on one of these toboggans not what people call them. Beanies. Yeah, she's really cold. Yeah. You look good in a beanie, Christina. Yeah. Let me try it out.

Speaker 15:         01:38:09       The Alma twins come from a mixed race family in the UK. Maria has taken off to her half Jamaican mom with dark skin and Brown eyes and curly dark hair, but Lucy got her dad's fair skin. Good on it along with straight.

Speaker 10:         01:38:24       Look at the guy. He's like, I said, the way Mike Myers snapped his head when Kanye said, George Bush doesn't care about black people. He was like, wait a second.

Speaker 9:          01:39:34       And she says dark skin. She goes down and tell him what she says that. But she,

Speaker 10:         01:39:40       no, no. Yeah, I like your restaurant. Is this Australian,

Speaker 9:          01:39:45       I'm assuming? Yes. Yeah. Do you guys really an accent again? That was really good. Right? Go ahead. The other twin got, uh, her father's fast skin and complexion and uh,

Speaker 10:         01:39:58       ah, Gotcha.

Speaker 9:          01:40:37       How old is this? I don't know what you'll do with that red hat, but oh well. It's unreal. My life. Fantastic. I've read a good honor. Like I said, science and um, you can actually have two kids from two different dads who are twins. Like there's a, this is what I read. There's a small window where you could actually impregnate a lady twice, two different people and they come out the same day, everything like this. And by definition you're twins because you're in there at the same time and everything. Sure. But it doesn't necessarily mean biologically. That's the same. That's a real hoe though, right there, right. She's, it could be, well, it's a real slot. That one, you know, unfortunately gave a child dark skin, but hey, she made up for it. Yeah. Probably had sex the next day to balance it out. Yeah, that's true. It's been a three slides.

Speaker 9:          01:41:30       Could have been a threesome. That could have been Chelsea lately. Once we did a story where a woman had to uterus to uterus and both of them was impregnated. Come on by two different daddies too, I think. Yeah. And you can and then have both those babies. Yeah. Out of your pussy. Wow. Out of your mind. Not My boss. How do you pussy hole. Hey, by the way, uh, I love the bird made you think of anything. Uh, before I forget, we have the official, your mom's house Fart Mike.

This already start off. It's already started off. Good. Check this out.

Speaker 16:         01:42:45       No, I shouldn't eat so much, baby. Why is you could get into me. Yeah. Cool. You know,

Speaker 9:          01:43:01       seems like that something's going to happen, you know, doesn't it feel like it's about something's about to happen? Something like if I'm her, I'm moving,

Speaker 16:         01:43:08       right? Oh No. Rush to boot and they're giddy up. Bite my head. Okay, I'm ready.

Speaker 9:          01:43:21       What is going on with you guys? Must know she is not been put our mouth. No she's not. I thought he was gonna Fart. I thought he was going to Fart and accidentally shit all over her. That's where I'm at. Let's see what happens. Well, were at your mom's house. That ain't happened.

Speaker 16:         01:43:44       Right. And her full face Co.

Speaker 9:          01:43:48       Oh my God. What is happening? You know what's interesting? We fart on our dogs' heads and one of them does not like it and the other one does is again, yeah, I want to make sure I see this correctly. That's in her mouth. That's gold. That's gold veins, right? Lack of respect is what that is for yourself. She put herself back there. He didn't make it.

Speaker 10:         01:44:26       He wouldn't even ask.

Speaker 9:          01:44:34       That was her.

Speaker 10:         01:44:39       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:44:40       That's how you come. Okay. I mean it's rare that a woman enjoys the vets with Dessa. What stands out the most is that like you, I mean if that's the other way around you're like, Yep, there's just another sick fucking guy. Right? Like it's just, there's just endless, one thing we've learned doing this show, there's an endless amount of sick fucking guy, man willing to do anything. But when women do it, it definitely stands out more. It's special. It is special. It is spelled, she's a neat trick. She is, hey, she's making this guy really happy. It gets to go baby. I got a fart about, she was like, well hold up, hold on. Don't waste that shit. And then she gets him positioned face in his, told him to hold. Hang on real quick man, don't let that loose. I want all of that one of those like bite his lower lip kind of like she was all, that's what I like. God Damn Hillary Clinton never did that to me.

Speaker 9:          01:45:38       No, never did that to me during that. I've got the burps but not the farts today. Yeah, that's a tough one for me. Cause you could be the best woman in the world. But if you were like, if you were everything. Yeah, I mean a good person to my daughter. Great to me. I shouldn't say great to everybody. My daughter included. Not just good to her, great to me, but if everything checked off and you were like, I'm a millionaire, you don't ever have to work again. I couldn't kiss you. I couldn't. I'm sorry. What do you mean? I could know that the one hang up of all the shit on the list is like, I just like you to Fart in my mouth. I would be like, I can't, that's a deal breaker for you.

Speaker 9:          01:46:26       I have to disagree with you. Pass you pass. I does it have to be done on video or can be some shit private. Whatever needs worried. She's like, don't you go fucking wasting those God damn farts and she's not there. And then when you fart she fingers. I'll tell you what. Here's what, here's what's good. I'm already entertaining it. Yeah, that is so nasty. I couldn't think about, you've got my asshole there. You, I hope Hillary Clinton. That's me. That's right. I left you that message. Clinton eight my asshole. That was back when I was smoking and drinking whiskey row when I was in my sixties the way back to this. So this is awesome. This angel comes into your life. Yeah. And she does everything right. Right. Everything money to like unlimited money. I don't even have to worry, honey, you don't have to work. Come here and pocket left your daughter.

Speaker 9:          01:47:20       She likes to be, she's like, I love the ravens. I want to go to games. I just want to you a box about your box. Let's have crab cakes. She's, you know, she's just the best. You just love everything about her. And then she's like, just fart in my mouth. You know? Not even every day, every other day. I mean, look, it will be tough. It's all I can think about it. That's that one thing is all I can think about. Not everything else you just listed at all. Like we'd be flying to a ravens game and I'd be like, I haven't kissed this woman right here and I just farted in her mouth last night. I don't know. I don't think I could do that. I think you get over it. I don't think I can mentally get paid. I would try. Here's the thing, I don't that I have the stomach.

Speaker 4:          01:48:02       Okay, I hear what you're saying. That that part is kind of nasty. The the shit, the FARC particles and are barely nasty sparely now I agree is barely Nancy. You can fart through the fabric of your genes and that way the particles don't get in her mouth of poop. But, but here's my thought. In terms of fetishes, he's like, Huh, let's, and in terms of fetishes, it's a really easy one to accommodate. You're not really actively doing magic set for what you normally would be doing. You, you would normally fart anyways. She's just enjoying what you normally do. It's kind of a blessing in the sky.

Speaker 9:          01:48:36       You have, and always have had a way with me, Christina. So I'm going to entertain it and say, okay, you're not 100% wrong because it's not me that's getting the fart in my mouth. I am delivering the Fart. And when you say it like that, I might be able to power pastor for a few months. But what if you fart? You have to fart through. Could you imagine if I brought her over and you didn't know anything and then when we broke up your guys will be like, why did you guys split? I'd be like, number one, I just can't fart in her mouth anymore.

Speaker 10:         01:49:08       That's what she's doing.

Speaker 9:          01:49:17       Any woman wanted that? I don't. I couldn't get past it. I could seriously, is that the deal breaker? I just, why wouldn't know that? Like I don't have done that. By the way, I've never had that precedent set where I'm like, I'm not going to date any woman that ever. This is the first time it's ever been asked to me and it's the first time it's ever, well, let them present

Speaker 4:          01:49:36       threshold. What if she insisted on wearing this dog mask when during your lovemaking, is that a deal? Every time, every time it sort of thing.

Speaker 9:          01:49:45       That's a deal breaker. She wears it. That's a deal breaker every time. What do you, how do you see it? What about role playing? What if she's just like, you know, just call me like a Puerto Rican slot or something. But she's white, you know, like she has some type of like race play fantasy or something. What if she, yeah, and it's like horribly racially offensive for you. I actually was, I had that one time what I was with, I was dating a black girl who wanted me to talk to play that kind of shit and bed and I was like, nope, really? No, no way. She said call me names, yes. Offensive names. And I was like, no, like Carondelet I was like, I'll go Carondelet that is it. Okay. Just give me a ballpark. It was the n word. One of those was other ones were just other horrible just things.

Speaker 9:          01:50:42       And I was like, I can't, couldn't get past the n word, so I don't even remember what turns me off like that. But she wasn't saying it to say it does not turn me on. So she was like, call me that. That was one of the things and just other just filthy, nasty, horrible shit. And I was like, I'm good. Filthy by the way. Uh, the one who the one, no, they the girl who stayed at your house and like know that that crazy girl that was not her one, that was an email and it was all because of an email you and I exchanged and she got my password and read that email that you and I exchange and that's why she got mad because they're totally different. Girl is a totally different girl is not that at all. But um, I met this girl, she ended up staying at my place one night.

Speaker 9:          01:51:37       I left ahead of her and just was like, whatever. And she hacked my password on my computer and just went through emails and saw one that you and I had said and it was nothing. It was a simple joke. Um, and I really don't remember what it was, but she was just like, fuck you. How dare you talk about me like that. He's clearly hack my password. So I changed it and I was like, leave me alone. I'll leave you alone. And that was it. But it really wasn't anything terribly offensive. She just was pissed that we were talking about her. What kind of horrible things to the other lady want you to say? Go ahead. The one we were already talking about, she's like, call me the n word as we're doing it. I mean like filthy. You were that you up. How does she set you up for the race? She's like daughter, does she go like, wait, does she listen to this show your daughter? No, she will tell you. That's true.

Speaker 9:          01:52:25       How does she set you up? Like you guys are, is it like you're making out for a while? Well, if it was set up this way, it wasn't like this one time gradually got to getting crazier. Like it was, there was one time where she was staring me in the face so much and we were, we were done. I said to her, I feel like you wanted me to call you a bitch. And she goes, I did. And I was like, Holy Shit. And that's where it started. Like, she kept getting at it like call me names and I was like, I'm not going to fuck us cause if I'm wrong, uh, I mean that is not going to be a good thing. Sure. But who knew how wrong I was allowed to be and they do it. But I'm saying did, did the next time when it did it come up again like in the heat of pull them bitch just became a thing cause I didn't have a problem calling.

Speaker 9:          01:53:09       Oh really? Whatever. If that's, I don't mind bitch. But yeah. Um, for that slot, that stuff, if she was okay with that, I'm like, oh, that's your thing. That's fine. You're requesting it. But so you were going, you're going along with that part of yeah, we'll get a little bit. And then it got to like, when the request came in for like, for the tip top, was it, was it in like are you like naked or is it like you're just having dinner? She's like, Hey, by the way at night, what do you step it up? I think they were at Shakey's.

Speaker 8:          01:53:42       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:53:44       Yeah. Uh, I really don't remember, but I would probably say at that point we were just, I mean we're probably even at that point like still close on just making out talking and stuff like that and then she started like, you know, and I was like, yeah, let me just stop going. That's interesting cause like you can generally,

Speaker 8:          01:54:08       yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:54:12       Yeah. I mean can't eat generally gauge when someone is like game, like you know what I'm saying? Like it's kind of bad on her to not gay that maybe you weren't comfortable with that kind of stuff. I don't know. It's an odd choice. It's an odd choice. It's definitely an odd choice for good. It would've been amazing if she had said, what'd you do that? And you're like, I've been waiting the whole time but only at the grocery store.

Speaker 8:          01:54:37       [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          01:54:39       thank God you asked man. I was just like, I still to this day that's a, this the same graph said this before on stage and everything. This is the same girl that when we first had sex she said out loud to herself, but way out loud. I can't believe I just slept with a white guy. I'm loud. Yeah. This is hilarious to me. I laughed so fucking hard. I was like, that is great. And then it progressed and I was like, that is, this is turn not great here guys. That's what I fuck. I never heard this story. I forgot about it until you, uh, played this, this romance here. Get me all fired up here. And a studio. Jean's mother. Oh, before, before we, I don't, I don't want to forget about it. The new podcast. It's called the honeydew. Yeah, the honeydew. Uh, you can subscribe now. You can, you can start listening to it. It's a big group. You can get a prescription right now. Um, audio, audio is going to start coming out on Mondays, right? Yeah. So we're going to move things around. Currently right now through January audio only

Speaker 5:          01:55:44       until we get in the studio and do video is Wednesday. Every Wednesday through January, we hit February and we officially get in the studio. We're going to slide audio to Monday, video to Tuesday. Okay, perfect. And the studio or the video you can watch here on the y youtube channel. Um, you're going to be over on this set here. Studio. What's that set to set to set B? Yeah, I'm also native. Can you jump on for one second? You set up a separate, uh, channel for clips, right? So now people can subscribe to what is the youtube.com/your mom's house clips and that's like highlights and things like that of all the shows that we'll be putting out from the main channel. So full episodes on the main channel, which is the one you're currently subscribed to and have the clips channel is where all the highlights are going.

Speaker 5:          01:56:36       So if you want a watch, like the three minute thing or the clip or like the highlight of this, this call is animation or whatever, those will all be on the clips channel. Full episodes only will be on the main, correct. Now can I ask a question as an audience member and fan as well. So we will have one, your mom's house youtube page where all uh, shows will live. That's right. And then a separate completely clips from all shows. Yes. As well. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. So you can, you can just, you'll get, you'll get clips from all these shows. Um, so in February you can look forward to watching the show. I'm the honeydew on Tuesdays, right. Your Mom's House Wednesdays, Dr Drew Fridays. Um, I'm not sure about there's another show or two. We'll know soon, whatever. Um, but honey do, you did do the first one I did with, uh, Josh, he was my, he, so I'd like to have a rotating cohost at times that I vibe with the, I just think also I'd like to have promote and come on and laugh with.

Speaker 5:          01:57:40       But, um, yeah, he was the co host for that. Basically, I introduced myself to anyone who doesn't know what the fuck I am, which is pretty much as you did the crappies for years. Yeah. And reintroduce myself and I don't know that I've completely got, I don't think I ever really got into my story that deep on crab feast I think I did on other podcasts. Um, and it got a lot of a really good, um, response and reviews and even Karen Kogarah for my favorite murder, gave it a shout out and it was a huge bump. Yeah. So very excited for the things ahead and to be here in a studio, jeans at your mom's house and Christina, have you been, I'm stoked. I really want you to be, once we get cameras up, I really want you to be like number one, if you can do it, we got to talk about you and I always talk about it anyway. Might as well just record it for a fucking change. That'd be great. The premise is of honey do for those of you don't. So the premise of the honey do is just highlighting and

Speaker 9:          01:58:42       laughing at the low lights of life. Anytime you've ever felt thrown away or not good enough. Or it could be a life story, it could be an individual story. Maybe it's a divorce or a, a firing from a job or whatever. But it's all about the negative in life and laughing in the face of it and, and coming out on the other side. And looking back and being like, God, I remember when I thought that shit was the worst and thank God that happened. And why is it called honey deal? It's called the honeydew because a, I was eating one night and, and I didn't eat the honeydew out of my fruit cup because I never eat the honey do out of my fruit cup and I don't have a serious like hate for honey do I just don't fuck with the honeydew. And then when I walked out I saw it everywhere on the tables and I was like, oh I'm a honeydew.

Speaker 9:          01:59:28       I've been thrown away time after time and break people's hearts. I wanted to know. I want to laugh at that shit cause it's, it's empowering and it's therapy and it's helpful, sweet and delicious. If you get a good one, if you get a good one, there's nothing wrong with it. But since then I had a fruit cup yesterday. I've tweeted it. They didn't even bother with the fucking honey do there. What do we wasted our money on that shit for. People been tweeting at me like, hey, here's the fruit platter left at my work and it's like three pieces of cantaloupe and honey dew on a bed of lettuce. Someone's, I said, who the fuck's putting fruit on lettuce? I like cantaloupe but not the honey. I do too. I like cantaloupe. There's a small percentage of people that do like honey do. Just like there's a small percentage of people that want farts in their fucking mouth from their loved ones. So very small. The honeydew is the fart.

Speaker 9:          02:00:18       That's right. By the way, it's that woman of the fruit world. Let me put a call out. One time we put a fart call out to guys who have the fart fetish cause we were like, come on like are you for real? And these guys wrote in who really? They're like, yeah and they explained their whole thing. I just want to put a call out. If there's any women out there with the with do they really want you to definitely going to want to hear from them. You're going to hear from them the one, it's like shame her. She's, well no, here's the specifications. It's not like, do you like it when your Hubby farts? Are you around? That's what I want to know. Do you want to put your mouth up on it? It's a thing for you. It's one thing that Dutch oven somebody, it's another thing to just put the shit right in the oven.

Speaker 9:          02:01:00       You know what I mean? Like God, Oh God, it makes my stomach turn. Uh, by the way, do you want to give him, we were discussing before. Sure. What you would do if you could eat anything and never, Tom and I had this discussion a while back. You know, there's a point where you turn 40 or even your late thirties where you can't eat shit. Bass for me, like early thirties. But yeah, go ahead. Like you just can't fucking eat the way you did. And it's a bummer. Like, now we have the soda at the House, like Stevia, Shit. Like you can't even drink a soda because you're going to get fucking bad. So I was like, what would you do in order to be able to eat whatever you wanted and never gain weight? Like what would you give up? And so we start running through this stuff and I was like, Tom, would you give up a tooth just missing one tooth, but you can eat anything?

Speaker 9:          02:01:47       Hell No. She was like, what about one of these bags, grandma teeth back here didn't bother back. Whatever I want and never gain. I was like, yeah, yeah, that's a good deal. And that tooth Doug brought, it's already gone. You save them money all around. It's a win win. There you go. So we all agree that we'd lose a tooth. He's easy. What's the next one? Okay. Uh, would you live in Nebraska? Okay. And here's the stipulation. I know. Well, I'll say, here's my answer. This is what I look like right now. I don't live in Nebraska. I'd rather just look like this.

Speaker 9:          02:02:23       But here's the thing, you, you live in Nebraska. Nine months out of the year, you're allowed to travel. You can travel for catch spring training, go eat whatever I want. I was somewhere else. But you're eating everything you want in Nebraska. Keep in mind so you know it's American gravy and shit. Jury. Oh, you do as gravy. Mashed potatoes, like Vietnamese food, pot roast, garbage. I can't, Shit. One time I made a mistake. Somebody invited me over for dinner. I was like, make whatever you want. And they were like, I'm going to make pot roast and carrots. And I was like, I'm not coming. That's the one thing I probably should have fuck up. Put on my list. Boiled. No, I would not do that. I wouldn't live in Nebraska. No. Even Omaha. Well, no. Yeah. Again, this is what I look like. I live in Los Angeles. If the choice is to stay looking like this in La, I'll fake it. I'd keep these extra 20 pounds on me. That Katie's extra 40 live out here. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          02:03:25       You need that in Nebraska. Those nine must be cold in Nebraska. You're skinny like you're a Nebraska 10 but what if you in your mind are like, I want to be fat, I want to be fat. Then stay where you want. Exactly. Yeah, that's true. No, you're right. Okay, so we all agree we're not going to fuck Nebraska. That's right. Okay. What'd you sleep in the dog crate with the dogs at night like you know I put bitsy and fee for then goodnight Tommy. And you go in the crane and just get to eat what I want. Nothing. I'm good. I'm good on that. Will you clean up crime scenes like nope. Like really horrific, brutal crime scenes. There's a, then you can eat whatever you want. Yes. I wouldn't take that. Can I tell you a story? No, you wouldn't.

Speaker 9:          02:04:12       You would be vomiting every, everywhere. Every time will be some new shit. Like an eyeball on a wall up here. You're like, I'd seen that shit. This attitude of like, no problem is such bullshit. Then I can come home and eat lasagna and eat my feelings away. You would not even make it. You wouldn't. You would be so physically though. Yes. I feel like I got it. Just a woman torn open, like come desensitized. Know what you're talking about. Yeah. Become fucked up. Call. Not desensitized, but think how skinny I'd be in hot to who? The dead people are looking at you every day. They don't need me. They can't even say, Hey, you look nice lady. You know what? We get my, Oh, I'm over there. I like it here in Lincoln. You look, are you with Lincoln? 10 girl. All right. Well would you sleep on a dog crate with my dogs?

Speaker 9:          02:04:56       Hell No. No one's dog or a dog house. No, that's not easy. What about pooping outside? Like my dogs every time. Every time you have to beat your opponents. Yeah, a no problem. Not a problem. Man's great IP outside. Last night, a few times I peed outside. We were in the backyard. Yeah, having a cigar. You pissed in my backyard a number of times. Your boy, what do you think your boys are going to be paying? No, I know, but did the exam and then birthday too. Great. He drops his pants to his ankles to take a look like a child. Yeah. I'll show you your toddler. Um, so I, so you would pee and poo in my backyard. No problem. I do that even if I look like this. Look. Yeah. Cause that's, Oh my God. My friend did that at though. We went to a ravens game match the urinals for the men. There's like a lie to 10 deep at every one of them. Bob Buddy walked up and dropped his pants. There's God, they have ankles like birth did right there at the front of everybody just peed. I just could, I could not stop laughing. I was like, what? There's a hundred fucking feet one. Okay. Give three kids.

Speaker 4:          02:05:59       What if, what if you can eat anything you want, but every time you, you start a show, a standup show, okay. You just subtly say Heil Hitler. My Name's Ryan.

Speaker 10:         02:06:10       No, you mean the one time I get to say that I get the look like what I want for the rest of them. I'm good. But what if you got to say it on talk shows and stuff? Yeah, no, no, no. I know I'm good on that. Oh, I'll go 300 pounds. I ever do that shit. I'll be like, wheel me out. They said I'm ready. Alright. What if you just have to work a Heil Hitler

Speaker 4:          02:06:34       in conversation? You don't have to start with, he used to be like, you just have to find a way to work it in that organic. You would do that. Yeah. Yeah, you would. I'd be like, you know, funny thing Ryan and I'm studying the Holocaust Heil Hitler and a funny thing they used to say and I would work. Do you want to do that? That's easy. I feel like that blue band so far, shitting and trusting in your, uh, what'd you do? That one, and it is just Jewish. Just squeeze in a Heil Hitler, but to be able to eat anything you want and never gain weight. Ooh.

Speaker 10:         02:07:04       And all I gotta do is say, how is it that you have to find a way to say hi. It was gotta to be like, Hi Hitler like that. Hi. Hi. That's a high, that's a friendly, hello. Yeah. Oh Dude, dude, I saw a Chinese Hitler. I saw, I swear to God, I can't believe I, I don't remember

Speaker 9:          02:07:25       this when I was in San Francisco over the weekend. Uh, amazing by the way. Always amazing, amazing shows. I'm walking down a grant. Yeah. Chinatown. Yeah. There is a dude who like probably in his thirties, he had his hair pulled back into like a man bun. He's wearing like a throwback 49 or starter jacket. And he had a Hitler stash. I was like, this guy is, and he was walking with such confidence. He was like, I dare you to point out that I have a start. I'm Chinese wearing a jacket and 88 started jack. He had boots on God, a boots, military boots. Not like, no, no, no. He had like a, I don't know, like, you know Staci boots, like cool. The cool guy boots. I don't what the fuck you would call him? Martin's? No, not doc Martins, but they were like, uh, like Johnny Depp would wear.

Speaker 9:          02:08:24       Yeah, like that kind of boot. Right. And then, so then, and then jeans, throw back starters, 40 niners jacket. You sure it was on our logo, not a Nazi symbol and that you fuck close up word. I mean a deliberate, oh, he walked right by us to be deliberately, dude. Yeah. It's only deliberate. Your whole life's like I dare someone to say some shit to me right now. It's not like you can't, that's where I, that's where I thought you were going to go. I thought you're going to ask if I would shave the stash like that. No, I wouldn't do any of that to eat whatever you want and never so far I will shit and Piss in your yard. That's where I'm at so far. I'm sure you have more common. What if? Can you just say the n word to ones? No. Once a day you have to work. Even though your podcast, you will all, it will be me alone on that fucking desk filling the whole God damn thing goes.

Speaker 9:          02:09:33       I feel like, is she on her knees about do a gang bang? It's like 10 black guys pausing to have a conversation. Maybe I should tip toe lightly and say n word weed out this so it's just going to be seven of you then. Okay, so you wouldn't do that either? Hell No. No. What'd you know? You would know your life is ruined. The funny thing is to ask someone like, Hey, would you ruin your life? Oh you wouldn't. That's weird. Now you are a twin brother. Do you think he believe you? If you told him that you can come in forest routes for, okay, I'm, I'm being serious. I know you are. Okay. You smoke meth with your brother. You have to do this once in your life and you can eat whatever you want and never gain weight. This is a one time

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       you smoke meth with your brother. You masturbate and you ejaculate in four strokes and then he pulls his penis out and he does the same

Speaker 9:          02:10:44       and that's it. That's all you do. But you can eat wherever you want to watch each other do that. I'll smoke meth with him once, but as the keep my dick in my pants. You wouldn't do that just once. No. Why not? We shared. We shared a room growing up, so I'm sure we were doing it around it. Yeah, I know. I was getting my fix and and a bathroom and everywhere else. Yeah. Never once said, I'll walk in the bedroom, but you're just going to jerk this real quick. Why don't you get out of here and play some double dribble real quick and I'll come back. Switch. Call me fucking controllers in front of your brothers. I would not know. I'm sure he's listening right now. Disappointed in Delaware, but uh, I wouldn't do that though. All right. Serve yourself pretty sad for a square.

Speaker 9:          02:11:29       What'd you do that in front of one of your sisters? Todd's different that I bought your dad? Yeah. Okay. How about this? Would you watch your dad come four strokes and then you can eat whatever you want. If you could stand up there and be able to guess, it's going to say I'd never be able to keep it down ever. I think of my face. Yeah. That is so traumatic though, to see your dad. Oh, to me, I couldn't even imagine. I don't think you could eat. No, no, you're not eating. That's why he'd stay skinny. That's trauma, trauma and stress. The rest of your life like I can't eat. All right. Um, look, I want to make sure people know it's the honeydew. You can subscribe right now.

I think it's a, it's a really good line for you to be in. I think you're going to have a really interesting perspective on stuff. I hope so. We'll see. Um, I, you know, I'm nervous. I'm starting all over again. It's you get out of your comfort zone, which I like and that feels good. But also, you know, there's so much that goes, you know, there's so much that goes into starting something new and an ending, something you've been doing for such a long time. So I'm very excited and I really appreciate you guys making me a part of the family members. You're always can wait to shit and Piss in your yard. I'm doing that for free and you gotta check off of your brother and, and we'll picture your dad doing it. Oh God. So the show's about every

Speaker 17:         02:13:31       Monday and then two, the vignette beginning in February, February. Currently audio on Wednesday. You will get audio Monday video Tuesday in February. Wow. That's, it will be a we back momentarily. Thank sickle cell. Thank you guys. And we're back. We ate unfortunately, wasted a couple farts in the green room here in the lobby, but who knows, maybe some magical happen. That was pretty impressive. You just give us the heads up. We got to say who's here are our final guest for today's episode is the great and drew Santina. Thank you. Yay. Thank you. I might fart. You might fart. We have an apartment if I have to. You'll just pass it over here. That's so great that you guys thought of everything at the studio. Well if nothing else, she was like, there's no way we're moving to a new space and not getting apart my priority by the way off. So if you feel it, you got to grab it, turn it on. It's like a loft. There was no wind sock on there either. No, I didn't really want to get in there.

Speaker 17:         02:14:54       The fart Mike is ironically what every microphone is that any comedy club I've ever played. How disgusting that does a microphone. So I dunno what comics set it, but it made me laugh so hard. Someone we were at the Improv and someone was onstage like like spitting in it like yelling and spitting and doing a lot of that stuff and then the comic that was like in the booth by the Improv next to me, it was like, I wish I brought my own mic and I was like that's so funny. It's true cause part part of the time. You do get up there and you're like, Oh God, this fucking record. By the way, he realized how it wouldn't be. It wouldn't be that crazy. Sounds crazy, but the reality is it wouldn't be that crazy to show up at gigs. I'd be like, Oh, and I brought my mic and you're like, they'd be like, okay, and then you plug it in.

Speaker 17:         02:15:33       It'd be like a forgotten thing. Totally should do it. Bands who play, like when you go to see like a band at the whiskey, they all bring their own shit. They don't share the same many things, so they're like, I don't want to share that guys, Mike or or drums or they replace everything and no one cares. It's not like it's a good idea. We should start doing that. I think it would be even funnier if we just carried like a wind sock. We just put it over just to protect the shows at the comedy store where the guy before me sick sniffling and everything. I'm like asshole. When I first moved to La, Don Barris, who does the, the, the, the late night led, the last spot at the comedy store. He probably, and maybe still does, he would lick the mic. No. Wow. Yeah. Would lick the microphone and like rub it all over his body and it really start laughing.

Speaker 17:         02:16:19       God, you can get a whiff of a Mike and you're like, oh, that's what disease and death and just a horror smell like sad. A lot of sad. You know, it doesn't smell these mikes fresh. These are brand new brand we're going to do. We're doing ASM are right now where that is so weird that that's a huge, I mean props if that's your thing. But I tried watching one. I get uncomfortable with that Cetera. But people fucking love it. No, Nikki Glaser came in and told her, she was like, I'm one of those people. It sends tingles down my back. I can't cause cause I watched the one, um, there's this, she's actually kind of funny to this black chick on youtube who she has really long nails that she oftentimes we'll like touch the mic with her nails and shit and people, I mean the comments, it's like millions of people like love it.

Speaker 17:         02:17:08       But I tried. That's what she does. She does. That's her thing. I mean she also does, it's kind of like a podcast too, I think. Like she does, she talks and talks about stuff. But yeah, she just like analyze analyzes like a bag of Doritos and she's slowly opens it. She talks about you imagine that's your fucking lane. You're like, you see my new house, my fucking car. I'm like, what? What do you do? Open Dorito bags and I, I scratched the microphone and Tom Tom's making a lot of money doing that Dorito thing he does. We're just talking about it at the lunch break here that you know, the metrics involved like networks will have the Nielson family retreats, which I've never met a Nielson family. We'll navigate such a lie. I've never met one either, but I've heard of one. You know what I mean?

Speaker 17:         02:17:52       You know someone that knows someone that has one. That's the only, that's the closest I've come is my friend said that his friends were a Nielson family. I don't know who, you know what I think might be the Nielsen families. There it is. Yup. This is the Birkman. Oh, you need to, Oh, you need a separate burp and fart. Fart. Mine. I think the Nielson family. Oh, this is, I don't want a bourbon. This is too nice. I'm going to be, I'm going to be a polite guest. Yeah, you stare at her. You just burped in the bike. I think the Nielson family, those people, when you know, when you drive and you see a house with a huge satellite on the back of like a huge dish, you know what I mean? Not the direct TV, like a big one. They have like a radio, so that's the Nielsen Guy.

Speaker 17:         02:18:31       That's who I think that is, because I remember those in the 80s like people got like there's a channels back then was huge dishes and they're like sitting in their yard and I always was like, I don't know, that looks like it gets gotta be government issued or something. That's the Nielsen thing. Like I don't know anyone that's known them direct, but someone's like, yeah, he lives next to my uncle. He's that guy, you know, he like Moe's with the mower that's not automatic, you know, the fucking level. And when we were just talking before we were on like you worked at old navy, I worked at old navy and I was thinking immediate thought was like you had record sales. I did. I was actually a really good salesman at old navy. I'm not kidding. I really was. Well this is really funny. I joked about being the sandals salesman, but because like sandals at old navy or kind of like, um, $3, well not even, I think they're like two, two, two like they're like two for two for four or something like that.

Speaker 17:         02:19:20       They're right by the front register. So you, so like every time I was at checkout, I would always just be like, you want to go some sandals? Or you know, people like without thought would just be like, okay, the power of suggestion. Oh my God. Well they're there and they're just kind. Someone always goes, I guess I need sandals. Or you always do for summer or if you're going on a vacation, hopping around. I'm thinking of like those, those weird purchases because you do it with gum. Like you never really looking for gum. Just happen. If somebody says, and there's some good gum here, you're like, oh yeah, the socks. When you buy shoes, like you want some socks and you're like, you have socks, but you're like, yeah, yeah, but those are what goes in these shoes. So I guess I should buy those.

Speaker 17:         02:19:57       I should buy those too. They should make shoes that come with socks. And I was like eight years, man, man. Never taken them off. Let me ask you a question about old navy. My suspicions over the years, maybe fan, fan of the gap. I love it all. And Banana. Interesting. Two of the three is cool to me, but like, but like banana for some reason it's like bananas, like, um, j crew's like, Ya know, lame nephew. You're like, man, it's like office where I don't wear too stiff as close. Yeah. But correct me if I'm wrong, I feel like old navy sizing is this, everything's a size up the gap, but they make it appear a size smaller for instance. And Old Navy too is a reality for, you know, eight is really a 10. Do you think it's probably because of uh, well I think old navy is, volume is probably way bigger.

Speaker 17:         02:20:55       So they serve as more people than the gap does. Right. So I imagine it's because of the average human American body is a little bit bigger, but they do do that. Right? I've noticed that the sizes are bigger, but they say that there are smaller and I think it's also because like if they ever made a mistake in the sweatshop when they were like, make it a four and they just made a billion of them and they're like, okay, that's that now. That's what, that's our shirts now. I think they just have to like stick stick to it at some point. It's a mass. Yeah. Old Navy is basically Costco for a close. And by the way, Costco has great clubs, ironically enough. They sell like brick clothes. I had a guy yesterday telling me, he was like, dude, he had a huge chunky watch on and I was sitting at my local bar watching the bears lose and I don't want to get into it, but it's fine.

Speaker 17:         02:21:38       I mean anyway, and this guy had a huge yeah, except for that. And then it ends on a kicker missing and kick butt, whatever. Um, he, I said, where'd you get the water from? We go to Costco. I was like, really? That looks like a nice, nice. He goes, dude, it is everything. Yeah. He hits me in the face with it, but he was like, yeah, no. Usually these are, you know, whatever, 800 bucks, whatever. And I got it for one 29. I was like, how does Costco do that? There's gotta be some weird science to it. They're like, tricking us all ready? Here we go. Yeah, I love it. In the boots. They both nodded. Smile. That's exactly what we wanted to, I've been for,

Speaker 9:          02:22:29       well it's official. We're wrapping up the studio. That's it. That's the only reason why I am so proud of you. Your tears in your eyes. What is real love? Wow. She goes about to have another fucking baby. Can you smell by the way, easily for today, my worst fart. You know what I mean? Yeah. I had some rips earlier, but that was just kind of, that was the weekend. It was one of those like you guys soundproof. Did you smell, smell proof the studio. I would stay over there. How are you? I'm gonna sit right here. Oh my God. I was the best moment of my life. Just do you guys fart in bed together all day? Yeah, but not like you got to get a whiff of it. I mean, you know it's interesting because I, I know there's some couples that I've talked to that don't fart and bet the farm outside of bed in front of each other, but in bed they won't.

Speaker 9:          02:23:18       You know what can be interesting. Would you show our buddy cause that guy that in bed and tell me how you think you would handle something like this. So can we just address the fact that moment took 10 years to happen? I know, I know. And it finally just happened. Can I tell someone I'm proud to be here for that moment and we're proud to have you. Thank you. I just want to, it's really huge guys. That was major for me. I don't know. That was a big deal. Thanks. I do you want to make it? I make a speech. Well you know before I farted before on this show, but you got to stand up. You got to hold thing. It's a whole thing. And to have a designated Fart, Mike, I really, you know, you see it like Golden Globes last night. I really want to thank, I'm serious here.

Speaker 9:          02:24:03       You're 100% do the credit because when we were leading up to this, I mentioned earlier, I was concerned about the light and the video and these mikes and making sure the control booth was ready to go and the Internet and you last week we were testing video and audio and you were like, God dammit is that Fart Mike Ready? And when the dog was like, no, it's not really a priority. You Go, why are we even moving? Why are we moving if we're not going to step up our game and you really, listeners, it's important to me. I don't know how important it is to the listeners. Email us, wait to hear how many people are like please, this has to be a highlight. You're going to get a lot of the birth of my children, my wedding day. One, two, three. Yeah. Easy. Yeah. That's great. It's really something. I don't know. I feel blessed though. That's going to be at your eulogy by the way. Birth the children married and the FARC. Mike. That's true. I know. I love you, but I want to show Andrew this. So this guy, I already liked the image, he's videoing himself. Go ahead and give him a little taste of what's about to happen,

Speaker 16:         02:25:25       baby. What is you could get into me. Yeah.

Speaker 17:         02:25:34       So is this what you and your lady or like the way that he goes, you know, so we know that a poop who was coming comment and we just don't know what's going to happen. Like is she about to run out of the room? What's going to happen? So I'll uh,

Speaker 16:         02:25:49       go ahead. Sorry. Oh No. Rush to boot now. Giddy up. Ah, well bite my head. Okay, what else I'm running?

Speaker 17:         02:26:02       Do you see my fucking face? I did see an I, that's exactly why we play these. Oh my God. And then I genuinely am like, oh, this is so funny. He's going to shit his pants. No, no, no. And she's like, hurry up.

Speaker 18:         02:26:19       Oh,

Speaker 16:         02:26:27       Ooh.

Speaker 17:         02:26:32       Yes. Right in your mouth. No, no. Yeah, no guys. No right in their mouth. What would you do if your wife started this with you? If wanted me to fart in her mouth. That's it. Seriously. That is it. Do it again. Yeah. Let's see the yard in your mouth? Yeah. What's the problem? I don't see the big

Speaker 16:         02:27:01       no problem.

Speaker 17:         02:27:05       Phone is ringing an old time we phone. What kind of shape? What percentage of checks you think are are into this? Yeah, it's got it. Who to 2% of women into this less the no, I think two is a pretty safe number. People under some weird shit. Have you seen the videos on it? I mean you will have it. Have you guys, what am I, what am I asking? You've seen people that love to get kicked in the Dick as hard as it. Yes. We talked about that. That should be a way lower percentage and it's way higher than I think like I've seen the videos on line and it had like 40 million views and you're like well people like this and like there's the one we watched. We watched that like Argentine one where she was like suffered and she's like pulling, holding his nuts down.

Speaker 17:         02:27:42       She was like, I want to suffer, I want to see the blood and then she just like, like a fucking speed bag. Just drills him. It makes me nauseous when I source like penis stuff. That stuff just makes me laugh. But like anytime tugging, punching, kicking, pulling, penis, wolf, I can't, I don't know how but that that's repulsive. But good for them if they're in love. Yeah. If that's the, if that's their love, if that's what it is. I just also think, um, something is violently wrong with that girl. So that will be a deal breaker for you and your wife? Yeah, I feel like if you're going to eat farts, I feel like that's it for us. What if she's like so perfect and every other way and I've heard you speak glowingly of your wife. Yeah. And she was like, Oh look, all I'm asking is that when you got to Fart, every once in a while you tap me on the shoulder.

Speaker 17:         02:28:21       You let it, you let me know and I eat it. Um, ah, no, you don't need to do I feel like, you know, if she says, hey babe, I really want you to Fart in my mouth. And I would say anything else? Pick literally anything else, anything. She goes, do you want me to come or not? Not Anymore. Not if that's your thing. But she doesn't even look like she's getting sexual pleasure out of that. That's just, uh, that's just like a thing they do. Let's talk about this though. But what, what's the harm in it for you? If that's what she liked? Cause I have to kiss her mouth at some point. So Ryan, so Ryan was saying, well that's just the next logical step. What am I, am I never going to kiss her over again? No. What if we, what if you were pants or jeans or some thick denim so that the fart particles don't actually get into her mouth? It depends on, you know, I did some research after, after doing you guys a show and there's only so many genes that have enough thick enough denim to protect the FARC particles. There's only two made around the world. Maybe you had a whole whole jeans or one of them and then this company out of Alaska. Okay.

Speaker 17:         02:29:20       No, but I think, I think first of all, that's boxers. He's in boxers. Oh, he's got that. He's really pushing it. He's pushing boxers. Might as well be paper machete. So that part's the streaming right into her mouth or you about to go please, please. I feel like it's on the precipice, but we, you know how like light make someone sneezes. What makes someone far? What can you do that? I want to jump the gun here guys. Okay. Okay. Give me a minute. I don't do that to us man. I got real excited. I know. I'm sorry. You're on deck right now. We need to in the batter's box swinging a doughnut. I'm afraid I'm going to pee myself cause I worked the pushing. If you push too hard place to let God let it happen when he wants to or she, I don't mean to gender.

Speaker 17:         02:30:00       What gender do you ever, do you ever pee when you fart? Yeah, I, since I had my Second Child, I pee when I cough, I pee when I laugh. Ooh. It just happens because your muscles are so weak. I just gave birth five months ago so it's still kind of still tighten them back up. It's still, I'm still reeling back in. Yeah, I get that. Do you have, do you have is leakage of thing? That's a big deal. Yeah. You can buy panties that actually absorb the, the little amounts of pea that you create. All that. Don't do that for guys. You guys should have that. Do you have a little bit of leakage? Do you have a little bit dribble? Yeah. Isn't that crazy? And no one talks about that, like that's why don't you have a pad in the front? Oh, like underwear built with a little bit of pad for absorption.

Speaker 17:         02:30:41       We've got two ideas on the show, but I feel like we could sell, make billions of dollars. I don't know what the fuck we're doing. Yeah, I feel like that's the thing that nobody wants to talk about that men, as you get older, every guy has a little bit of drip edge, but no one, no one says anything. So you go pee and then the lows a little bit. There's always a little bit, even if you shake, you know, especially after we've been having a few drinks. Then if I shake in a Pete whatever, I still got some. And sometimes you walk away from like a urinal and you're like, oh my God, I think I'm pissing down my thing. I'm still just pissing, yeah, it's not dribbling. I'm full, full pissing my pants. Now when I bring this up because I imagine you have pretty

Speaker 5:          02:31:20       good game. Okay. It's just like a sense that I have and we have a, we played a guy, uh, we, we're not going to play in right now, but this guy became a, uh, quite a hit on the show for his very forward approach to contacting this woman, Julia. That's right. Okay. And then I'm excited we got, so we got ahold of this is just voicemails, voicemails, apparently, I don't know how long they've been around. They've been around a few years at least, but we've never heard them. So this woman release these voice mails that this man left on her phone and we'll play them in succession. Like how, how she received that. Okay. This is true. This is Julia. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Totally different persons. Different woman releasing voicemails that a different guy, but you can, you can hear the build. Okay. Yeah. Things changed. Yeah, it was such a good fart.

Speaker 19:         02:32:11       Hi Ashley. This is Davey is five o' clock Tuesday afternoon. I don't know what time you coming home. If you have time, maybe we can go right hitting Brandwidth. You can have dinner together right here in Brooklyn. You call me back please. Three mono line or one bye bye.

Speaker 5:          02:32:33       Okay. I know you edited that, but a piece of me is like, God, this guy doesn't even know how to say his phone number three one oh, he reminds me a lot. I remember. Reminds you of um, yes. Yes.

Speaker 4:          02:32:47       This is David. I'm, I'm guessing David's not as God given

Speaker 5:          02:32:50       Salah May. By the way. Solomon is a, they're a lady was late leaving extensive messages on Christina's mom when she switched her number.

Speaker 4:          02:32:59       How did she get your number? No, when I switched my phone number to a new, Oh, it was something I've done. I've had that before. Yeah, right. For a years I'll get, I still get like dry. This guy's a drug dealer. Hits me up if I want Xanax. And then this other one that's kind of Nice to be on drugs, it's like a gambling thing. He's like, hey, the Knicks versus the whatever you want in. I'm like, Geez, you adopt a burner phone number you've got to generate.

Speaker 5:          02:33:24       Never. That called me. She would get mad and calling me. She would leave most of the message in Farsi and then we'd have people translate and they were like, Yo, she's raw dude. She's like, tell this mother fucker to get the, she was telling her how to keep wearing pearls out of her fruits, like Thai plastic bags all around your training like crazy. So this guy keep going with this guy.

Speaker 19:         02:33:46       Hi, I see you said Davey is 7:30 PM Tuesday night. Oh, it's the same night call on my phone. I don't know if you were trying to call me back. No, I didn't. I missed you or what happened or just avoiding my phone didn't ring, but I have your number as a miss. If you did call me, can you please call me back again? Nice. 7:30 PM three one zero nine

Speaker 17:         02:34:16       eight imagine leave this guy two hours later. Hey maybe you called and wires got crossed to the operator, not put you through to the right. What year is this guy? I think this is my favorite move is like a, I see the missed call and I think that maybe it's you even though I don't see that you call, here's my number again just in case. Yeah. Jessica, just in case you saw me already bothered you before. Did I wonder if, did he send texts as well? I don't know if he sent texts. Definitely left more messages. Let's see.

Speaker 19:         02:34:56       Can you just call me for five minutes or I should just forget about you. I told you a decent human being but it seems to me is you are not so I don't know what to tell you. I taught you or someone I can talk. Then you are somebody decent so can you just call me for five minutes if you are not available so I can just throw you a number to the garbage.

Speaker 17:         02:35:34       It was very odd to just print out a phone number and then throw it in the trash. You picked up on the fact that as that message was ending, there was some anger building 10 throw to the garbage. That's how I pizza. You were a decent human being by the way. He mentioned that twice. I thought you were a decent human being, not someone who would call every two hours bugging you. That's a good person. We're on. Call me. Yeah, number three. So it's five seven 39 yeah, on a Tuesday. About Friday. Can't be that busy. You can't be that busy and a decent person wouldn't be that busy. Impossible. Decent human beings aren't busy. So do you, are you going to call me back or should I throw your shit in the trash right now? You can feel just the end. He goes, so I don't know what to tell you. It's like almost a murderer's ploy. And his brain was deciding whether to say something aggressive or not, and then he ended with like wood or do I throw in the garbage? Like he didn't know whether it'd be like, fuck you right back. But he, but he saved himself at the end by just saying, just come on. Call me back or month or do I just need to stop this? I wonder if you call us again. Maybe. Maybe this one's nicer.

Speaker 19:         02:36:48       I don't know what the fuck is wrong with your phone.

Speaker 17:         02:36:58       Oh, nice. That's great.

Speaker 19:         02:37:04       I don't know what the fuck is wrong with your phone. Every time you con you disconnected, I don't know what the fuck is wrong with this phone call or the way is, I cannot even talk to you. What is this?

Speaker 17:         02:37:17       What does he know how that works? Wait, so disconnected. First of all, he didn't leave a time, didn't leave his phone number again. I feel like the consistency is broken now and so now we know he's mad. Every time he calls his disconnected. What does that mean? The phone is disconnected? Yeah. We don't know what's going on. It's broken. You know how often your cell phones gets it's gonna disconnect it. That's such a common name. What the fuck you call it again? I see another missed call, Ashley. Yeah, so, so this is is, is this the beginning of the me too movement is this kind of list? This is how I start. It should be, but there's no way.

Speaker 19:         02:37:54       Okay. Ah, fuck a prostitute. So many fucking fuck you are. You're 14

Speaker 17:         02:38:14       and dismissal for motherfuckers to four, three, four, three or four prostitutes. I would love to have a counter on that. That it, that sounds like, you know when somebody takes Spanish 101 when like a white kid and he only learns a few cuss words. Yeah. And he says them over and over and over. Like he did that

Speaker 19:         02:38:29       fucking phone. Mother fuckers.

Speaker 17:         02:38:32       Motherfucker prostitute. Yeah. Yeah. Mother fucker prostitute. Yeah. Um, I mean this is good. Uh, let's go to numb. Yeah, that one, right?

Speaker 19:         02:38:44       Pardon me? I knew there's so many bad, so many still. Do you think I need it? I said you are beautiful. You are cops fucking mother fucker because you, I have to put it short. Call me anyway.

Speaker 17:         02:39:40       Cocksucker motherfucker. I got to say this could be a nice monologue piece for you. I like it as a performance because I printed out the pause because I have to put the pillow over your face. It just such a fuck. I mean it really emphasized. Yeah. You know, it is, it is very obvious when Rachel, yeah, that was a little mean. You can just stick to prostitute, cock sucker motherfucker. And then you've been good and necessary. Yeah, no, it's interesting. Is that what good morning Julia and this guy have in common with doctor drew was mentioning was that narcissism? Yes. It's the same thing of like he was waiting for Joe to turn ugly like that and said this guy ended up turning. Yeah. Yeah. So it drew analyze the good morning Julia Guy. He was just bracing. He's like, he's like, so it's, it's about to get violent or grotesquely sexual, you know, and yeah, it didn't go there.

Speaker 17:         02:40:31       And then he was just like, wow, this is, you know, this guy's obviously has like kind of sense of a grandiose, you know, feel really illusions of grand jury. Yes, yes. And, and basically most people like that and like this or without shame too. You know, you can't shame them. But this guy, he does it. He does anything here. That's very interesting. Let's if we psychoanalyze this for people that have no background doing this at all or schooling, I'll just say, he says you're a cock sucker motherfucker. And then he says, you can suck my cock motherfucker. And then he says, and then he said, you're too ugly to suck my cock. Right. He wants it, but he doesn't want it. He's playing real hard to get here and then go suck some black dicks. Maybe he's in the cooking. Maybe he wants to see her suck on the black cause that's what that seems like. Yeah. So you cock sucker. Go Suck Black Hawks. You can't suck mine. You should. You should suck. You're too ugly to suck. Mine. I'll cover your head but let you stuck up.

Speaker 20:         02:41:29       Okay.

Speaker 17:         02:41:29       This guy is full circle. He's all over the map. He's emotional. He's emotionally unavailable is I think what this is. Yeah, that's the breakdown. I think he wished he could be really more attuned with what's going on, his emotions and he just Kinda, it's a cry for help. It's a cry for help. Yeah. I think, I think, I think his last relationship ended very poorly. I think that's what really happened here. He's trying, could you imagine? But this is essentially the guy in the bar who's like in Brentwood, what's a bright white, but he's like, Hey, what's up? What's your name? And he's drunk. And then you're like, I'm not interested. Fuck you, bitch. Yeah. It's that. That's a real guy. You experienced that of your whole life? My whole life. But he's usually very drunk. Yeah. You can see them coming a mile away. You know it. You know what? The minute he talks to you, he's fuck it. You've had enough guys in your dating life experiences that have done it.

Speaker 20:         02:42:15       Okay,

Speaker 17:         02:42:16       that have done that to you, that have been like, yeah, you're hot, and then you're like, I'm good. And they're like, fuck you. Yes a lot. It had a cool tactic. That's, I mean, it's got to work all the time. It happens. You did it. Every one of those guys [inaudible] everyone, I'm married, I'm married one every like every time you're out late night at a bar by 2:00 AM that guy rolls, right? So alcohol plays a part. I am always, but see that's why la closes at two and that happens, uh, places like Chicago, they never close. So you kind of just avoid that to some degree cause those guys just keep blacking out on high closing time. That makes, um, it's that sense of I got to get it down pat. Yes. Yeah. Chicago bars or four or 5:00 AM they just end up sleeping there. They go ask a girl and a girl was like, I'm good.

Speaker 17:         02:42:57       And like, and they just keep drinking and then they just live there for a day or two. That's crazy. I've seen that by the way. I've seen guys sleep at the bar sleep, put them outside, put them in an alley or on a, you know, then wake up and they're like, hey, I got something to drink. Yeah, you want something to drink? It's seven. We started serving an hour ago. God, it's a good life. Hey if that's all you got do, that was our deal because that seems pretty, they just had a, um, they just had a vote this past session to put it to three, maybe to 3:00 AM and how'd that go? They shut it. They shut it down at lost by like a landslide. What? Yeah, because it was something about, um, the, there's a budget increase then in police force, uh, to deal with, to deal with assholes that are leaving the bar.

Speaker 17:         02:43:37       Black problems. Yeah. There's all sorts of bullshit. Such a like a bump of people spending money out that it would be worth it though. I don't, maybe not though. So you say that, but I think like a lot of times people get so fucked up so early. They, I think a lot, most people leave the bar before 2:00 AM yeah. Because they know it's going to close. Do you know what I mean? Like either go get more liquor and go to someone's house. I feel like it at 2:00 AM only on peak. Maybe a Saturday night is the bar packed when it closes every other night of the week. It's like, you know, staggered. I feel like that's, I feel like every time I go out and I see that if I've ever closed the bar, I look around, I'm like, we're, we're pretty sad. There's like 15 of us sad people here staring at each other.

Speaker 17:         02:44:19       The lights go on, you know, like we should go home. Everyone's like, yeah, this is a bummer. This is like a really pathetic underwear. England, it closes at 11 yeah. Well the British people drink all day, all day. So you started earlier. They don't really have, I don't think they care because they're like, they wake up and like, oh, grab a pint and eggs and beans. You can't last. If you really do that, you know, like your days where you're like, it's, it's morning. You're like, let's get drink and right now people do it and I'm so impressed. I'm going to be honest, if I say like, oh, we're going to a baseball game and I'm going to have a couple of beers, the night is called off, whatever I was going to happen that night. Can't, can't exist. It's over. Yeah. Won't exist. I'll be at home and people like you have to come out and you remember when you fuck that guy, Rick in Charlotte, he told me, we tell this story 100%.

Speaker 17:         02:45:04       So I met Rick in Charlotte. Uh, well I should say this. I met him in the Appalachian Mountains, right. So I met him in the mountains and we were both hiking. Yes. And, uh, what happened was, is I'm hiking during the day and I was a little bit sad and lonely. I was gonna have a big fight with my significant other. And uh, this guy, Rick, I was out of water. My camel pack had ran out of water and the ric had had a Campbell, pat had a one of the 12 gallon at first. It's just like necessity. I, well, I, I was kind of bending over co dry coughing, you know, and he goes, hey bud, you know, he's on another P, you thirsty? I said, I love it. And he goes, you can suck on my pole. So that's what they call them, suck on my poles, sharing camel backs.

Speaker 17:         02:45:42       So he walks over to the, you know, the other peak with me and you know, I'd give him, first of all, I give him a big, big hug. Yeah. Big Guy. Real big guy. Yeah. Kind of like I'm a real heavy, probably like three 30, three 45. Wow. But not tall. You know, he was a short for 10 for 10 but three 53 65 maybe. And he shoved his full in my mouth. Yeah. Big Guy. Shoved it right in my mouth is, you know, and just, you know, made me suck and I sucked it down. And um, I said, you know, I have a show tonight. I'd love you to come see me to stand up. And he said, no chance, but you can meet me at my hotel afterwards. And he's not a comedy fan. That's crazy. Yeah, it was nuts. It was nuts.

Speaker 17:         02:46:21       You still went and did your show bombed? Bombed two sets. Because I just was thinking about Rick the whole time and the moment I got off the second set, you know, the owner was like, oh fuck, I was all mad, you know, as I was like I gotta Roll Dude. And I went right to that Hyatt and just how fun was that? It was at first it was a little daunting to be honest with you, cause he is a large man and I just did, you know, there was never a discussion over top or bottom. It was pretty obvious. So you know, um, I was recovery. Uh, not bad. I mean not too bad. At least he made me an ice bath, which it's takes so many trips to go to the hallway because of the ice machines. Never ever, ever just a little baby bucket.

Speaker 17:         02:46:56       Yeah. So we borrowed a few buckets from other people. We kind of got, it was like a communal community thing. It was like pass the bucket down and everyone was like, why are we doing this? If someone's sick, if someone hurt. And you know, I bent over, I opened up my moon pie and I showed him what happened. And uh, I sat in there for about an hour and a half and everything was fine. I got to say, it's one of my favorite stories. Yeah. But can I update you on something because you've asked me a few times. Rick has fled the country. Where is he? You know, he said he, he, I got a suspicious email. Um, I have some weird suspicion email and it just said I'm leaving and I'm going to the Netherlands. So I think this fall is going to be my trip to the Netherlands to try to find Rick.

Speaker 17:         02:47:34       Wow, cool. You could probably build a tour around it, write it off, you know, I love that. I would absolutely love that. But then again, I'll be thinking about Rick not comedy the whole time. Yeah. Your Bom, Bom, Bom, bom. And that's pretty cool. Yeah, it's so romantic. It kind of is. It kind of is. You know, and in this modern age, no one really talks about, nobody really will romanticize every time two guys have like a gay joke and film, they're always like, oh, you know, it's, it's just, it's too cheap. This was real love. This was real cool. Yeah. For the first time in a long time. I gotta tell Ya. I remember when I met, uh, Saint Tino, I was like, Hey Tom. He goes, I'm just glad you're not named Rick. Oh, that's a weird thing to say. Sure. Yeah. But why? And then he told me the whole story.

Speaker 17:         02:48:12       Do you say it to everybody? And he's like, if they're not named Rick, I do. Most men. Yeah. Yeah. Well I don't trust most guys after experiences like that. Oh my bad. Yeah. So I just, you know, that, that, that, and that stuck with me and I know you brought it up cause it's the podcast, but it does stings a little bit. I'm sorry. That's okay. This is your show and a, that's true. I'm going to let it go. I didn't mean to hijack, no, come on. No, no, no. It's not disrespectful. Not at all. No. It's respectful. It's respectful because it's your, it's your house, your mom's house. I want to make something clear. We are overjoyed. First of all that you're going to the Netherlands to find Rick. Yeah. But secondly that whiskey, ginger, your podcasts that everyone should subscribe to, please download, review, thumbs up, stars, write a love letter.

Speaker 17:         02:48:57       Uh, also you will very soon be able to watch the watch his podcast here on this youtube channel. He's going to record it in this set over here. Yup. And the video coming up. We'll be coming up on Monday, starting in like two weeks. Is that right? Or something like that. Give or take. All right, so, but it will be a regular thing where you can watch the video on the youtube channel or you can download and listen to whiskey. Ginger, you are hilarious dude. So I, I'm super, super pumped that you're doing. Thank you. I'm so, I'm excited to, you know, like, uh, I know this sounds like I'm pandering, but you guys are kind of, I mean there's only two or three people that really told me to kind of get into it and you guys are kind of part of the reason that I did it.

Speaker 17:         02:49:40       I avoided doing a podcast for a long time cause I just was like, I don't know. I don't know. And I like doing other people's podcasts, but I just didn't, I just didn't feel like I was like, ah, I don't have anything to offer and all that shit. But you guys were kind of the part of the, the last thing that pushed me over the edge to do it honestly for Rick and do it for Rick, but I have this weird fewer natural man. You natural. Thanks man. I have this weird fear. He's not listening. That's the weird thing, you know? And that kind of eats me alive. There could be like a cool Easter egg in every episode for Rick. You know what I mean? Shout out to Rick, like maybe you get a camelback and you kind of do things. That's my, that's my Carol Burnett sign off.

Speaker 17:         02:50:14       I stuck a little bit of a cold. I can't hold back for Rick exactly. Or like, you know, I don't remember what you said. Was it a favorite food? But maybe we put a little bit, you don't remember? I said what? I said I forget. Are you serious? Wait. It was, was it pistachios or I as a chicken pie. Pistachio Mash. That's like some elaborate. I've told I've told you this 10 10 12 times Robert to have set up, you know, to get, I was looking at putting a little bowl of it on the, you have a studio here. We got. These guys can cook some shit up. All right. I'm sending a recipe and I want that every time. All right. That's in my writer. It's a chicken pie or pistachio mash. Wow. Have you never had that? It's a delicious dish. Well, Rick turned me onto it. Oh my God. Can we move on? This is going to really, that's, that's crazy. Bury me. I don't want to get you going, but I also have this clip.

Speaker 17:         02:51:04       Sorry ma'am. Rains and the corner. That really goes deep for me. I have a clip of Pristina haven't played yet on the show. Ready? There you go. You sound great there by the way. My older, my career before. How did you skip out on having the valley voice and super conscious of it? When I get with my BFF Shauna who grew up in the valley too, we, we are regressing to like, oh my God dude. Like fucking Bro. Like dude bro. Like Bro, but that, but, but, but Sally up, speak up, speak up. Speak that kid. That was a revival with Paris Hilton I think in those girls. But she did that Paris Hilton was kind of like the Nicole Nicole. That girl brought it back, I don't know, but there was big in the eighties speaking to come back. You know Lindsay Lohan is got a TV show now you guys know does MTV, I just saw a billboard on sunset and they immediately it, that's the name of the show that I googled it.

Speaker 17:         02:52:09       She has a fucking show on TV about rehab or something. Yeah, I imagine it's life. It's her life. It's just, it's a reality show. It's got to be sad though. She, she was so talented. I know. Isn't it weird that that talented goes the other way? Yeah. I like, it's w I never, that's so strange to me. So fuck, when you're kind of mediocre town mediocre and you fall off, like if what I ended up falling off, people will go, yeah, okay, that's fine. But when you like, when you're like huge and you're the thing for sure. Now look at them. I'm giving you, put Rick in my head. Rick used to tell me you're not worth it. That was kind of my favorite. That was turned me on. You're not worth desk. And he had this sweet deep voice. We have to get a search party.

Speaker 17:         02:52:49       We got to find Rick in the Netherlands and you toward another one 65 well we all get, let's can we go? So we get, maybe he's gonna stand out. Those people were all long and lean. You know, you'll find your, Hannah mentioned it. People are like, Oh, you're talking about like short fat Rick. Yeah, I know exactly know gay Rick. That's the name of it. That's the name of the tour back yet. Let's find Rick. Let's fine. Rick, the tour. I'll go. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm so down. I'm very sorry. Lindsay. Load hands. No, nothing. She, I feel she's doing a TV show and I can't, it's just so funny to think that there's so much good garbage television man. It's awesome. I think it, do you watch the bachelor bullshit or no? No, we're really in the bachelor of the bachelor. It just started.

Speaker 17:         02:53:32       We're watching 90 day fiance. I'm all over it. It's one of my favorite shows I've ever seen, ever created. Ever credit. You know what Brexit might have after lockup. I like it. But 90 Day has more drama you like, yeah. 90 Day has better drama for me. The kid, the kid, um, and the names are bad. I'm bad with names, but the kid who has the wife that has the baby over over in Russia that he had to come back. I believe their love. I actually believe that actually believe their love. You also empathize with him. When you see them getting angry, you're like, you're young. You just got to work to shut out. Totally take a couple deep breaths. Just kids like going through a weird love struggle and I buy that. You know what I mean? Well, so much responsibility at such a young who's loved by the most, uh, well there is no, there is literally no love between the, uh, the girl who has two kids from two different dads.

Speaker 17:         02:54:19       The blonde girl with the Jamaican guy. See, she does have two kids. Yeah, she's mentioned that. She's mentioned it. Okay. Another reason that I don't believe it's real love because this woman has two children. You never even see that this is what she mentioned, that I go like three episodes and you're like, shit, it's never come up again probably with their father so she can do this nonsense show. I gotcha. I see. That's why I don't believe in any of that. Also, like I think he cheated on the wedding day, which is a bowl that is a bold move. I mean, if you're going that far yet, we haven't made it to the wedding day. Sorry, I'm the, I'm the Queen Bitch. That girl who's like on the stairs, she's like, that is, I like you. You biggie. How sick and the Cottica we get to Biggie Pooley she's so great and she hates the mother. A biggie. Poorly gets a biggie booty and her teeth are enormous.

Speaker 17:         02:55:18       People know, wow, look big money. Her teeth are bigger than veneers, you know, bigger than those. She's like, yeah, like the big, the Steve Harvey's, she, she's good. And the um, the kid, the, that, that's the vague, that's Vegas, Vegas, Vegas. That's my favorite part that goes with this mom. And she hates the place that they live and he lives with his mom. That poor guy. I don't even, I, oh, I feel so bad for him. It's not even fun anymore. Do you know there's like some people on the show, you're like, I don't feel about you trapped yourself. Like the dad that disowned his daughters. Yeah. So the other girls, it's like, dude, I don't feel bad for you, but the Vegas Guy, I feel sad for him because he like, he loves Vegas, he loves his mom. This girl is like, Fuck Vegas, you mom is bitch and shit.

Speaker 17:         02:55:58       And he's like, I love you. You're my dream girl. He, uh, it's the, it's like, we always say like cool. At one point he's like, well, you're, everyone knows a boy's best friends. His mom, and then they have like a, a joint bank account. He and his mother, 33, 33. She's like, what about when we get married? What are you going to do as far as the bank account? He's like, just keep you on it. You know, all three of us, all three of us would be like a big happy family. Mom. My wife and I share a checking account, checking account. It's, so, imagine the fights that will come from that, that the mother is like fighting with a Brazilian over what she saw. She bought on their check. I mean like couples do that. Husbands and wives do that.

Speaker 17:         02:56:42       Wow. That was way better than yours. Wow. Yeah, that was, dude. Are you pushing off the leather? Are you getting lift? That's the best day of your life. Well, she did say kid's wedding farts, but now it's too far, so I feel like that it moves up. Moves up a little bit. It was fun. That's really good. Hey, can I tell you something here? Go ahead. You have great compression in your farts. Let's talk about it. It just sounds like a perfect bubble came out like a perfect fart bubble. Just, yeah. Tom's was more like, cause there's little Ripley. Yeah, there's also in there. Yeah. I'm so mad because I had such killer farts today. I know. And then you let them all go. They, none of them got captured. You know? It's like when you're trying to get a set and you're like, a fucking killed it last night.

Speaker 17:         02:57:36       Why don't you set up the camera? Nothing. Hey, can we say this? Yeah. Your farts are just as valid as her farm. Don't get down. You're far shaming. You're forced shaming yourself. Yeah, no, I know. I should just celebrate yours. You know, try and be happy for me. Yeah, that's true. Sorry, I'm sorry. That was a really cool fart. Next episode you're going to have some parts of your own. Yeah, I have a feeling that he heard that without headphones in there. That was up. You know what I'm really happy about is the people listening to this podcast wearing their ear buds. Now they can hear the FARC clear. Imagine someone with a good sound system in their car. The base on that.

Speaker 17:         02:58:25       Talk about new advertisers. Just opening the gates for marketing. Hello money. How many other podcast? You know who does have it? Your mom's house. That's fucking right. That's the only one. You're the only one I know. Let me build, I also didn't eat like a big enough thick breakfast. I'm really mad. I was on the run this morning, but if I had a big breakfast, this is about the time that I'm letting them ride. Like I had to go pee in there before the show run. You went for a run? Yeah, but, but like I had to pee before the show but like I thought another hour and I'll have to shit and I was kind of bummed I couldn't shit here cause I would have loved it. Chris in this place with my shit day one. Oh yeah, no I mean from my front, a personal level, I do like to make myself known and then place that I'm new to.

Speaker 17:         02:59:08       Yeah, sure. Yeah. Like every time I go to a meeting in Hollywood I always, shit, I'm not, I'm not joking. I have a Cappuccino machine in my house and I make probably three or four shots of espresso. Do you time it out so that you know, if the meeting's at 11 o'clock I'm up, I'm up at like eight o'clock to like do work, whatever. And I, and I have my last sip about an hour and a half prior to, that'll give you perfect 90 miles because I can show up 10 minutes before the meeting. I can go into the lobby awkwardly talked to them one, where is the bathroom? It's right here. It's in the office. Perfect. Do you let people know in the meeting what happened or you like, Hey, just so you guys know. Sometimes I say to the receptionist, I go, I've got a lot of stomach issues just so that might get passed down the line on one of those [inaudible] boards shitting here and he let me know.

Speaker 17:         02:59:51       Yeah. He had just had an hour move and they were like, that's definitely, I think it's a power move. I bring my own baby wipes wherever I go. Yeah, just in case. Yeah, I do. They're on your car during my car, just in case I need to clean up, you know, and I used to do, I used to have comedy deodorant in my glove box, but that's really smart. Before nice be so nervous and I would just put, just to put on an extra layer before standup, do you do, do you, does your sweat smell? Do you have a smelly sweat? Because I sweat a lot sometimes, but it won't smell it. No, she doesn't smell well then it doesn't matter. Then you get the rings on your shirt on stage. I'd be so nervous that I would get the sweat rate. Third idea we're gonna make our third product is shirts like trauma, sweat rings.

Speaker 17:         03:00:30       Oh, that's so cool. They're already there. Built in socks, sweat, ring. That's it. And then didn't we have something? Oh, the fart or, well, the big catcher in the front, which by the way will be our highest seller. I mean, so we just chopping up are like a billion. We just have like forklifts carrying the money around that we're making from these ideas. How can these guys, can you guys help carrying money in there? I feel like they can, they'll figure it out.

It would be nice if we saw his brother's side of it was his brother was like, dude, I don't support any of that shit. It looks like a skeleton in the background. Like it's, it's fun. It looks normal.

Don't be in the back yard. Cool stuff. Cool. What do we, what is this man's name by the way? Ted, this is Ted. I think so. It's done, isn't it? I imagine a Ted, I was going for something like he dropped, he dropped big words. He did, right? He did. He dropped it. He dropped quite big words. Yeah. God. The angle and here's the thing, he's already not a traditionally handsome man. Timeout. What makes you say what the fuck the fuck makes you proud? Are you taking shots at this guys? Looks, what is it about this guy that's not right? You're right. No, I should be in the sky. It looks fucking awesome. What are you talking about? Two things. Sorry. Give me two things. If you find that attractive about him just to see, what do you say no is it doesn't count. Go. Go once on the track of about this guy. Yeah. With your size. What's not appealing from this angle? Right. Go ahead.

Speaker 17:         03:04:57       I was like, is this Brad Pitt on a bad day? Maybe the angles. Uh, here's the deal man. Like if you are ready on that side, you know, why don't you try to make the angle flattering? It's like you just know, like not under here is never good. It's never going to be good from here. Never. I, I feel like this might be his most dominant. What if he's extreme? What if he's, what if he's an LP and he, this is his best angle is up. No thanks if he's an LP. I never thought of that. Yeah. Look at the door behind him. See the, like the bride of Chucky doll. It's so beautiful. Yeah. Gorgeous art. Yeah. That's just so great. Gorgeous art. Can you zoom in on that? That doll that is Harry Truman on that dog in the background? No, fuck it.

Speaker 21:         03:05:42       Well, it's up on my Instagram. Hey guys, I'm on a roll today because women are fucking stupid. Okay. They're fucking stupid. Why? It's so difficult for good guys to me to fucking saying woman. I don't understand why everyone was a fucking stupid idiot.

Speaker 17:         03:05:59       Could there be like some could there maybe be like some paralysis or something going on? Like just the way that, so maybe we should feel bad for him. The chest feel bad. You know what? If he's w okay, you're going to feel bad. What if he's legless? He's not like, how do you know we don't see any of his legs? He would make it an issue. He would make it an issue. That might be where this anger is stemming from. This is old legless legless Ted. I feel bad for old leg lists and here you are throwing shots at his looks. Hey guys, what am I looking at on the lower left frame there is that, is that a tattoo? I want to know what those tattoos are so bad. Yeah. Oh right. I want to know, it looks like a bird wing was probably right off. You don't see Christina, you big meaning it's the straw that he blows into. Make the chair move. You know he is fucking stupid bitch. I mean it moves another couple of years. Not, don't, don't you put that on me. Do you? You really funny. Are you going to be this mean to this man? Don't shoot you guys, don't you

Speaker 21:         03:07:10       the song. I just don't understand it. I just don't do you understand? We are in the situation we are in because woman ate the apple. It is woman's fucking fall. Gimme back my fucking rib and go back to her. Fuck you came from

Speaker 17:         03:07:24       dude, this is religiously informed as well. Dude knows what's up for sure. You telling me if this guy sent this video out and you saw it, you wouldn't think to give him a shot. I let them tell you what, come on. Oh, he does make some good points. Where's your first date with him? Uh, let's think about it. Hold on, let me, let's be real. Let's be, where's your first day? First of all, he is he going to call? No texts. Like they'll call, he'll call you from a payphone? Yeah. Yeah. He'll call. You find the one pay phone at the airport. It's we, it's gotta be a weird location. And then my brother's house, his brother and I'm going to eat, I got to take the bus down to see my car's in the shop in the shop. It's such a great lie. His car's been in the shop.

Speaker 17:         03:08:13       There's whole life. It doesn't have a car. Never had a car. So he, so he takes the bus and he says, how about we meet at the restaurant? Do you think it's a restaurant or do you think he's going to go Starbucks? I think it's what he calls. He calls everything a restaurant. How? How quick, how quickly do you think he goes from like, all right, we're like, so three o'clock. So like you're fucking stupid. Do you think, do you think it's a matter of, if you're like, that's three and he's like, fucking bitch. You're like, no. I was saying like three 15. All right.

Speaker 17:         03:08:44       On the edge of Andrea. What's his life like? This ted, once you're really good at Teddy, teddy, you analyze this last time, teddy. Well, here's the thing about teddy and the thing that I said that I knew that you didn't know what he is like less and that is, that is the truth. When Tom said about the chair. That's true. Okay, so he does take the bus and that's only because the buses are equipped with already uh, chair loading accessibility. How big of a side you should feel bad about that bus driver let when he sees the chair at the stop, Mike, the bus driver, Mike. Mike is Mike like, all right, let's go to take second. Like you think it's really annoying to him every time. But I can tell you this guy's chalk full of good jokes and he always tells a good joke when he gets it.

Speaker 17:         03:09:27       I tend to pretty good at your small quick stuff, you know what I mean? Like, uh, you know, he says, you know, like when he's, when he was rolling on the bus the first time Mike was annoyed and he's like, come on dude, you know, like speed it up. And he was like, you know, he goes, look, you've got a leg up on me. You know what I mean? You know, is fakies and Mike side I could sense. All right. So now he's like, hey teddy. Right. The second cub, second of times he did hold up the bus an insignificant amount of time. Yeah. Yeah. Cause there was a girl, the bust up, he was calling us stupid bitch and it was yelling at him. These rants are common for, for Ted. Very, very common. But it all stems from the fact that his brother has a bigger cock. Oh yeah. That is a big issue in their family.

Speaker 17:         03:10:13       Yeah. It's just a fact about their family. They live together. He and his brothers still, or does he live alone? Does this guy have his own apartment? Is it going to take me back to his own place? 10 his brother lived together. Yeah. Yeah. They lived in the halls and the skeletons and all the cool stuff. They share a room in a house in Tarzana, so it's somebody else's home. We don't really know those people to be honest with you, but they lived together in this room for short. Head goes like you like a doll's and artifacts and stuff like that. And if you're like no, see that. She's like, you fucking idiot bitch. Yeah. And you're like, I'm sorry. Like here, like here, like I'll be the girl and on the date with Ted, you guys go ahead and give it to me. Give it to me.

Speaker 17:         03:10:55       This is how I'm the girl. Christina, are you familiar with not really. What does have an extensive collection? Oh fuck you bitch. Is that what you're saying? Is that how that was pretty good. That was really good. Really good. Do you see my reaction? I went like this, but you know what? I really went like my pussy is wet. Yeah. The moment you yelled at me like that, I got to see it. By the way, that red is, I'm terrified. Where can I go with you? Yeah. You know, it goes back and then write in. That's what you were like scared. I'd be like, fuck yeah, that's what, that's Kinda his ransom. Why he does it. Because he said that happens so many times, like multiple, seriously. Where does he take, where does this guy go on a first date? Like let's be, well, I feel like if he could, so if you do, you know, you're, you get the call, you take an Uber, he takes the bus, uh, and, and he says, let's meet up.

Speaker 17:         03:11:46       He says, let's meet up at this. Let's meet up at a tire rack. You know, like a, the to change, you know, he's got to meet there. That's where his brother worked at the tire, the tire rack. That's a tire chain store. You don't want to tires. And He, his brother works there. He shows you some of the dopest tires that they've got that smile that month on sale. And if you're kind of not into that because you're not into that, he's like, all right, you're a stupid fucking bitch. Exactly. Do you not like Pirelli's like, fuck dumb bitch. What are you a Michelin Bitch? Fuck out of my life? He tells his brothers showed this bitch, she's p ones and she was like, she didn't get it for sure. And then his brother Bitch fucking dump bitch. I'm bitches. So that was, that was the test.

Speaker 17:         03:12:28       That's the test. Let's just say you pass the test. I love p one 50 tires. I should is tight. You dumb bitch. I love that. You love that shit. Fuck yeah, dude. You want to go to dinner? You fucking tramps. So it's a win. Win. Yeah. And then, but here's the thing, he says, let's go get something to eat. Where do you think he's going to take you? This is what I'm wondering. I can tell you telling Taco too easy. Too easy. No, because that's Kinda, that's kind of Nice too. I think it goes like this. Uh, do you wanna get something to eat? Yeah, I'm hungry. I'm not hungry.

Speaker 17:         03:13:10       That's it. That's it. Kick rocks. All right guys. I'll see you later. It's like, yeah. Yeah, you will. Fucking expensive. Dumb Bitch. Want to eat food all the time? Nope. He's got a blow. Oh yeah, he's got a blowout. You know where I think he might take you. You know what? I think he might take someone like you, someone like you because you're prettier than the average girl. Oh Wow. Average girl. He probably treats a little bit worse. Oh definitely. But someone like you, I feel like he would take you to a Johns, you know the other, not Vons, but John's, he would take you to a Johns to the Deli Department, let you pick out your own salmon. I'd be like, that's he like you build your rest a few meets. Maybe you're like ham and then like he's like hands on sale. Yup. Slice to ma'am.

Speaker 17:         03:13:54       Two meets tops. Bitch. You're like, can I get the Italian? He's like, yeah, right bitch and I'll let you get four kinds of fucking meat. Capicola and get outta here. Kind of Bryce not giving her brands give was a sliced ham sandwiches. You go out for hand sandwiches with tab. You don't need any bread. Bread, get fat. No one's a fat bitch. All right, let's roll. So then when you're turned on after your meal, he's rolling out of there and you've got to go back. You go back to his crib and you're down at, fuck, are you down to fuck at this point? I mean, aren't you turned off from the whole experience so far? He's talked to you. Cool. He's taking you to cool places. This guy is a fucking date, some sliced ham. You got two hands. You got to hand sandwiches. The sad thing is I can picture the woman that is under him like there's a woman broken enough please. She's like, this is what I'm worth. This is what she is. Yeah. This is nice. He gave me this me and yeah, and he's only called me a bitch like six times. I think he's just playing. Yeah, I think he's just joking around when he calls me a dumb bitch. Aggressive sense of humor. You get back to his place where his brother is there in the room. You walk in the room, his is curating some of the doll work.

Speaker 17:         03:15:06       What's with adults though? I'm being serious. Why does Ted collect the doll? That's their passion. That's always been something that him and his brother had been into. I don't know if that's something to laugh at by the way. That's really their passion. Yeah. Some people have like a bunch of Steeler shit. People will collect sports memorabilia. This is the same thing. This is their, this is their true love and passion investment too because sure are worth a lot. I mean, I liked football. Are you to mock me? Right, right. So you get back there. His brothers in the room, his brothers in the room and his brother is already disrobed. Oh, so he expects me to do, there's got working legs though. Nice thick working likes this. His brother can squat like five 50 it's insane. No, his brother's d road because that's how they work in the nude.

Speaker 17:         03:15:52       They work in the nude. They curate in the nude. You don't want to have all the paint and all the, all the bullshit all over your clothes. But he gonna ruin of your Nice Shit. That's why he's shirtless there. They're curating. Yeah, they're making stuff. They're making cool stuff. And so his brother and he says, would you like to disrobe and help us with some of them? Are you not going to get naked and help him cure rate? You put it that way. Yeah. I feel like that's an obvious natural to be nude and curate because you're trying to get it now that you're, I get it now. Sorry. I see it and you know what happens at the end of the night, Tom, do you know what happens? What happens? They're done curating. Yeah. He gets you a bus ticket home. He doesn't even try to fuck you. You dumb bitch that guys, that's really cool why? He buys me. But the last bus runs at nine 30 so he's already, he's got that down, but it's dark out. He doesn't know the bus schedule.

Speaker 17:         03:16:46       He blows and he blows you or he blows off to the stop first. You're like, he goes, I'll get you a bus ticket home, and you're like, oh, I think it'll be, it's like eight 56 I'm not giving you the money. You stupid bitch. I'm not going to let you spend it wherever you want. I'm going to give you a ticket so you make sure that you spend the money on the ticket, right pocket it, try to get rich off, which does sound like something that women have done to him in the past, which is why he got mad. He gave them cash. She's like, you'll just for your bus bitch. And they went and got something else.

Speaker 17:         03:17:16       Oh you go to Sephora, you fucking bitch. You bought some rouge bitch that was for the bus, for the bus. Use the money for what I fucking told you to use it for. You know some rules. But here's the thing, my mother used to call on your way home. You're on the bus. You just like lost it in that glow of love, that new relationship energy. And you're just like, wow, awesome. Do you think you're like immediately like I got to go out with them again? What? What's like the feeling of yes, I am in love and I think to myself, when's he going to text? When's he gonna call? Right. But he's playing the game too because playing the long game three days before any contact. So it's a game of chicken where I'm like, do I do I acknowledge that we had a wonderful night together?

Speaker 17:         03:18:03       Do I wait for him? That could be a risk though. But here's the thing, it's 2019 and I'm a progressive sort of gout. Okay? I'm not afraid to reach out and let a guy know how I feel and take initiative, so I'm going to send that first text. What do you think your first Texas at Ted. She's super cash. Hey, she's a thanks for the bus fare home. Super Nice meeting you and your bro. He's big into punctuation. I'm just letting you know that. Oh, so I'd want to know what the big curve balls going to be though. Matt, his brother ends up texting you on his own. Do you think so? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Squats a lot. Well, look at this as you're texting Ted.

Speaker 17:         03:18:45       Hmm. That's a new, open it up. Yo. What's up? Oh Shit. It's Micah. You fucking bitch. Ted's brother Mike. It's a biblical name. No Shit. He talked about God and it's right there religious. Then you have that moment. Now I have to choose between the two brothers. What are you going to choose? This is a big issue. Okay, well hold on. Let's go through it. The merits of both. On one hand you have ted, it was kind of a quiet introvert. Yeah. On one hand you've got this cool guy, ted, who we've discovered, right? On the other hand, Mike has got a cool job at the tire store. No tires front to back. I mean you'll never have a tire question in your life, sir, and your life and he's employed like the guy with a good job. Health insurance. You know what I mean?

Speaker 17:         03:19:42       To think about these things for you. The future children 401k health insurance, strong man lifts all day, right? Yeah. Ted took me to the Deli counter. He did. Don't forget that. I'm not forgetting it, but I feel like this blood you choose to meet to meet. Yeah. You didn't just get one because mica is known to be a guy that only lets you have Turkey. It's true. He's a Turkey Turkey, but I'm saying that Micah might take me to a sit down restaurant. I'm talking olive garden. Really? That's a big leap for a guy. I don't, I think he doesn't. I think Mike is more conscious of his finances. I think he, because he's making a lot of money, he's been making a lot of money and he sees some, some hottie blonde he come through and you know all your pitches like the money dude, you think he's going to take me? Where's Micah take you? You get, you get cooked at home and he makes you cook the meal for you guys. But we'll hold on.

Speaker 17:         03:20:32       Why don't you come over and go over and cook, but I can't. But then the brand or is there you fucking making, how am I going to cook? How'd the brother's gonna be there too? If I go back, he's got to take me out cause I already devised a plan to get Ted away from the house. He does this thing sometimes where he has a buddy who has a astro van number. The old astro vans drive him way up out to like Simi Valley and he makes them try to get home anyway. It's like a game that they play. He's like, you've got to get back to, so he's got a couple hours to kill brotherly love. It is there, but it's just for fun. They're just joshing around. But it does give him a good gap of time. That's true. So you're there, you're going to be alone with him. Then he's like, Yo come over and fucking cook dummy.

Speaker 17:         03:21:09       So you go over to Mike, his house to cook. I mean when you put it that way, it's like is it easier to pay it? Okay. And then I come home there. I'm also, we don't have pots and pans. Fucking stupid. Bring your own shit. Some shit on the way over here. Okay. He doesn't have weird sense of humor are so funny. Oh you guys are hilarious. So you go through all this breakdown. Who, who is more worth it to you, Mike or or 10 but that's okay. So like I said, on the one hand on paper looks better. Sure. On the other hand, Ted's a little more secure. There's more emotional security. What's head? He's not going to cheat on me. Mike has got a lot going. Hell No. Yeah, he won't. You're actually right about then if I'm a girl who was a little insecure and beaten down, like you know, I might go for Ted cause like have you watched love after lock up?

Speaker 17:         03:22:00       The premise is like you get somebody who is so weak that they're never going to leave you and that's what you want. A 90 day fiance, the Indonesian chick that comes over to Wisconsin, my favorite. How about he's like, ah, I left for a week. His plays is such a mess. Not Darn it and it's such a fucking dump. So sad. It's so depressing, but you, you end up feeling so much better than that guy. Like I always like just want to reach through the TV and be like, you fucking idiot. Yeah. No, but you know what he, a lot of those people ask for it. A lot of those people ask for it. They want it, they know it. Okay. You're on a TV show called nine yet you have to get married in 90 days to approve someone's visa. Yeah. You're rushing this thing you for no.

Speaker 17:         03:22:45       At no moment. Did you step back and go, this seems a little contrived, right? No moment. Well then you ask for it. If you're that into it, that you don't have the self awareness to go. This is a little crazy, like a little weird, a little crazy. If you have none of that self awareness, I'm cool. That's going to, I'm fine with that girl from Jakarta, right? She has extreme wealth like she comes from, which is very odd, but I think, what do you think it's to come here too. She wants to go to medical school. I know, but it's got to be deeper than that to get away from the family because medical you can get, they can get visas to come to. Yeah, that's what I was wondering. There's actually use that guy. There's gotta be something. There's got to be something that we don't know.

Speaker 17:         03:23:26       Something about like property or real estate. That's a big thing for people overseas to come and buy property and real estate or investing in something. There's something that we don't know that's happening. I like how depressed she gets when she realizes what his life really is. Like, oh my God. Oh we all get to press. It hits me harder than it hits her. It's rough because she's just, she's literally going down. She's smart enough like to have the analization of like how sad it really is. Yeah. But it hits home harder when we watch it cause you're like, you're in this, you're stuck in this thing. This is like quicksand for her. She's actually not a stupid person, which is so weird that you're like, it's not a trick. She's not like being coerced or she's not being pulled into something sad and gross. Yeah.

Speaker 17:         03:24:06       She is smart enough to use the system but also like put herself in a worse situation. That's why I think something else. It's fascinating. Something must be up to the surface. A show on TV. We have to wrap up. Yup. Sadly, you are always the best. Thank you for loving you guys. Whiskey ginger. Subscribe now. It's a great podcast. Sorry.
