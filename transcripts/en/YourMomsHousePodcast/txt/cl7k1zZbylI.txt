Speaker 3:          00:01:23       There you go. That was cool. It was called stranger bikes and it's by, uh, let's see. Snick and Steven Snick and Steven. But it says, I like that. There you go. You know, I like, I really like that. Stranger bikes playing off of the stranger things theme. I can't wait for that show to come back. It's coming back dude. When now I guess there's a big uproar right now. People are upset that they didn't renew since eight. Oh, I couldn't get into that. I tried and I couldn't. Did you try? Uh, I don't. I saw the pilot. That's the only thing I saw. I couldn't give it. Yeah, I, and they do it. Can I tell you we was a bunch of people all over the world, right? The different paths. Superpowers, like one guy can come a lot and then the other lady miss that episode entirely.

Speaker 3:          00:02:05       He didn't know that. Nope. And they all go on to come strike. No, I think you're confusing that with something else. One of them can talk to Hitler. No, no, no. I don't think so. Hmm. I don't think that can happen. We tried watching last. Rob, is that what you guys, did you do your exercise this weekend while I was away? Yeah, I did. I worked on it. How many did you get through? I got through 50, but that's getting, that's progress. Your first 50 strokes, you'd get 300 strokes and, and then possible have an orgasm. Just not ejaculate. Orgasm happened on the inside. How do you, I hear that happens when you, when you get snipped, Rob, Rob, rob that you, the beginning. I don't think you forgot anything. When you get snipped, when you get a vasectomy. Oh, that you might not, I don't think you make a buck in the beginning and then you make something.

Speaker 3:          00:03:03       No, doctor drew was saying that he doesn't have any juice that comes out cause he had, uh, he had, he had a, his testicle cancer. Sorry. None of us like to me. Oh yeah. Yeah. Because I mean, you still have seen it, but not the potent load. Yeah. Yeah. No sperm they'd know per minute sperms. Perms. Perms like shrimps. Yeah. Sperms. Sperms. Yes. People do miss pluralize that sperms shrimps a lot. I hate that. Especially if they just had an espresso. Oh, I gave that or they just came from the library. The Espresso one makes me the most upset cause I hear uh, servers and Baristas. Yeah. And they're like, and you want an ex extra shot of espresso in that? Yeah. How do you work here? You should know. And you've read it on the menu and overheard. Yeah. Stupid fuck sperms sperms. Um, so it was a, Oh, so we, we tried watching yesterday after porn ends to hoping, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:04:01       To find, oh, oh, oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:04:11       Hoping to find some gems in there like we did with the other porno documentary. Yeah. Where is, she was like, she did that hooker math section, a segment. And remember that was the best to a dye. I remember the math. Go ahead and math. We're not good at math. The math, the hooker math was you get like, I dunno, $500 to shoot a scene. Right. Going over it. She was like, yeah, but they offer you to let a guy come inside of you. Yeah. And internal surprise. Uh, an extra hundred dollars. Right. She goes, so you get an extra hundred bucks. He comes inside then, you know, uh, the morning after pill, the plan B, it was only $40 $40. So that's 60 bucks I got to keep in my pocket. It's a win win is all I gotta do is let this, it, I don't know, common me on camera.

Speaker 3:          00:05:05       So that's neat. It's immortalized forever. What's wrong with that? But you get extra 60 to 60 bucks. Huh? Like I was telling you if it, if, if she had been like, and then for like a guy to finish inside and I get another $400, we were like, well, you know, that's, that makes sense. Okay. That makes sense. $400 would be worth a guy doing that just to show you like what scumbags the like that industry is run by. They don't even go like here's 140 so the 40 you get the plan B, you get getting make $100. They're like, you figure it out, whatever. You got it done. You maybe you want the kid who knows so don't you. Yeah. Jesus. So we were looking for some gems, but apparently these porn stars, they followed or too smart and they figured out how they were going. I think we got to keep on, I think we should finish it because if you notice they would to uplifting

Speaker 5:          00:05:58       for me. Well they would go, they would go different types of stories like up and down. Right. So like they would do one person who was like, that was biased back then. And now I'm having, you know, I'm retired and, and yeah, and then so like that's a kind of a sweeter story. Then you go to the, the guys that I have aids and you're like, oh shit. And then they go to the lady who was like, I had a lot of fun doing it and you know, I was crazy, blah blah blah. So I think we should, I think if we keep watching, we're going to get somewhere. Yeah. You know, maybe fun. But it definitely wasn't hooker. Hilarious.

Speaker 3:          00:06:32       Yeah. Give me those hard knocks stories. I know his was like, man, his HIV story, you're like Jesus. Well to his credit he looks great. Like he really seems to maintain his body well and, and he's working out a lot and he seems happy. Oh my God, God that dude is like so extra yoked. But I think you gotta be juicing right to be on that. Have that body. Yes. Especially with an auto immune disease. Definitely.

Speaker 5:          00:06:55       My Dad was telling me about that. Um, about some of these bodies you see on people. So like if you don't know top dog who's obviously been on this show a million times, he was a competitive Olympic lifter for years. I mean from the time he was 13 till about 29 or 30 and he would working out six days a week, most of his workouts were like three hours plus. Like these guys were maniacs. And he goes, you know, I was in great shape. I was a two time state champion. I was ranked nationally. He goes, I didn't have like the body that you see some of these guys have. Oh Wow. Somebody who is lifting every everyday and eating steak every day. They can potatoes every day, every day. This was before supplements or vitamins? No roids he's just like I work out, I eat a steak. Yeah. Data. And that was what he did. But it's interesting because you see these days you see crazy bodies soap, especially in men like super, um, sculpted, you know statuesque bodies and, but it's also the era of like people taking growth hormone and and uh, and test out, you know like sure. Access. Yeah, access all these things because what with him, like I've seen pictures of him and his and his is like super competitive lifting days. It looks like a super fit guy, but you don't see like muscles kind of and a falling

Speaker 3:          00:08:22       down really defined and the veins and all that. You and your dad are built like brick shit house is, I say sure. Yeah. Not a shit brick house. I always get it confused. You do say that a lot of the, but you guys are built for a, that you're very sturdy and Ellis has that back to you guys have brought the shoulders and the back for it. We have the same blueprint. My Dad just took it in the direction of working hard at it. Yeah, right. Yeah. But your genetic, I mean you lift weights. We've got way too. Yeah. You Know Jim, whatever. No, I could, I could pursue it more heat. But like we were talking about his workouts one time and I was like, fuck that dude. I mean he was competitive. That's different. I mean I wouldn't, I don't have the desire to do what he was doing and I both have that lazy gene counteracts any sort of wanting.

Speaker 3:          00:09:09       I forced myself to swim and do pilates, but I hate it. He also had a group, this is the thing that they would lift a as like a team and he goes like if you left early or skipped any day, um, the other guys would ride you so hard about it that you were like, fuck that. Like they would only go on dates after, you know what I mean? So if it was like, Hey, I'll pick you up on Friday and you go like seven, I'd be like, no, nine 30 after I'm done. Yeah. When I'm done. Listen. Wow. So they were so into it. That's cool though. It's good fucking 30 sets of squats, like not to you, but your dad is the type of personality who really likes structure and discipline and focus and like having that, you know what I found a unrelated to this really interesting watching that documentary was like, she was an old lady now, but she did like the devil and Mrs. Jones or whatever that porno is the old ass one, by the way. She looked fucking old.

Speaker 3:          00:10:13       Oh, she liked the Rob Rob Guy. But uh, so they showed them a picture of her nude and I was startled by it because you're like, oh yeah, that's what human bodies looked like prior. Nice, normal bottom. And it was beautiful. But I forget what normal bodies look like in print. Human bodies with natural breasts that just, that that laid normal and they weren't enormous. Quadruple d fuck my triple d slept wife tits. I know in platinum blonde please, please, please, please, please send out face. It looks like it's drawn on like she's in like she's in shock, the photos and eyebrows and wonder what the aesthetic is the pop like how did that, how like looking at different looking women obviously, you know like variety. Yeah. And it's exciting to see, you know, but like hungry. Why did, why it went to like, as like that's hot cause I don't feel like that is, I don't know which committee decided that all porn chicks have to look identical because I mean like there are men who like hungry or tits and begged shots and different shape faces are interesting.

Speaker 3:          00:11:29       Different noses, different, you know, all that Shit is interesting. I know what I think it isn't hair. I think the beginning was Pam Anderson. Honestly, I think sometime around her era. You're right. People went, oh, the gold standard is blonde is fuck. Huge tits. Tiny, tiny waist and Barbie. It's essentially Barbie. Even actually know the porn stars body. Is it bigger tits than my Barbie had Barbie was like a c sure.

I was on Instagram. You know, I love Instagram. Instagram is my favorite. Silver isn't it? The best is I like photos. I like, you know, looking at a photo and deciding like, that's enough information for me. It's enough. I like a nice caption of photo. I'm done.

Speaker 3:          00:15:06       That's interesting. You know, there's that. That's, so that's how the guys do it. Yeah. Now the girls do the body, the girls do the, well, what's interesting about the body thing is that they take half naked pictures. What?

Well, I mean, yeah, I didn't mean to be so dramatic. Obviously.

And will everybody, everybody cross your sphincters for Tommy caused crusher be holes, so it's all good. Yeah. Big Excitement. Good. Good week for the Sigora House. Not going on. Yeah. What were we talking about before the surprise? Um, Fudge Oh, scamper. Snapples

Speaker 5:          00:16:17       well, where are we talking about? We're talking about while we were talking about the porno thing before the break bodies bodies. Um, and then I played this fucking guy. So do you want to know what that setup was for that, why that guy was flipping out? Yeah, so apparently there was this, uh, this is, okay. I'll tell you what the thing said here is that the guy there, there was a, an incident occurred at the International Longshore Warehouse Union in Longview, Washington. And reporters were there to ask about a hostage situation that happened weeks prior. So six guards were held hostage for a couple hours, um, after 500 or more long shore men broke down gates and smash windows in the guard shack. And this long shoreman is in no mood to answer these questions. So in other words, this is something that's been like in the news and this and this news reporter is just like, Hey, I want to ask again. You know, or ask more about the incident that happened.

Speaker 3:          00:17:17       I ain't called him macaque bite, which is really funny. I've never heard that one before. Right. It is amazing. Talk by, that's a great, yeah. Wow. I love it. You had that isolated already. You knew that was a winner. Yeah. Cock bike. Yeah. So this is a shark bite. This is how the whole thing unfolds. This is the guy showing up, the news guy going like,

Speaker 2:          00:17:39       oh, hi, I'm with you. And just wanted to know if there was anyone here want to talk to us about the situation from where actually you can go down and fill out talking to

Speaker 6:          00:17:51       egg. They'll tell you how they're fucking the longshoreman around here.

Speaker 3:          00:17:58       That's the gentleman who gets more upset and then I guess you see that the camera man, one of them starts filming something

Speaker 6:          00:18:06       printed out. Hey, none of your fucking business you cocked, bite miss you a trespass. You get the fuck out of here now. Get outta here. Don't fuck with me partner. You're not the PR staff. You,

Speaker 3:          00:18:22       I liked it. That guy maintained his sense of humor. I also think it's funny that the guy goes, unless you want trespassing, like not if you want to be charged with trespassing, like unless you want robbery. Right. He's just, he's, he missed conjugated is under stress, under stress and it's understandable, but I think he keeps saying it. You want trespassing? Like you want something to drink, wasn't trespassing on with you.

Speaker 6:          00:18:54       Trespassing. He might be drunk. Jammer broke you cock sucker. Just wanted to hear your by now or you're going to get trespassing.

Speaker 3:          00:19:07       You know you're going to get trespassing. You're going to get charged with trust or you know, I'm, I'm an, I'm going to say you are trespassing or you are trespassing. Trespassing is what you said. You're going to get it. You're going to get are going to give it to him. They're trespassing. You're going to give you a shot of trespassing. The shrimps. Yeah, the shrimps and the ESPRESSOS. All the shrimps. The sperms and the expressors are going to get you're trespassing and the library. The library. You guys have a library here doing a paper on the shrimp.

Speaker 3:          00:19:57       why is this guy fucking with him? I liked the, uh, he has. Here's a great disposition though, Cameron. At least he's like, I'm just doing this man. He's done this a 500 times. Yeah, he's seen people lose their mind. Like, I don't, you don't get to hear people yell like this anymore. You know, you don't really get to see it. Cock bites and stuff. I feel like I haven't seen people freak out like this in a minute. Yeah. I miss it. We just pull these all the time. People. That's exciting to me because I like seeing people get upset like that. Especially if we're funny. You know this guy is, he's upset because there is a buildup of people asking this that you don't get to see. In other words, usually when someone loses their mind, it's not over something reasonable. Right. It's, it's because something builds up over time. This guy has been asked these questions for six weeks. Original trigger. Yes. And he's mad at you. I'm mad at this guy. He's mad at the fucking man. The first for a second hundred reporters that came. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This is pretty good. It's so funny,

Oh, our old landlord, uh, one of our past landlords was a longshoreman and he was not, he was a very gentle, sweet guy, but he would tell stories of his, uh, you know, yeah. Coworkers be a gnarly dudes. Yeah. So my real gnarly, real gnarly. Where, why worser shit. Just got, why water? Uh, I was at the Arrow Puerto yesterday, bright and early and, um, I was listening to people talk on their phones and the rage inside of me is kind of like that, like the cock bite.

Speaker 3:          00:22:38       Yeah. Rage where you're like, what are you doing, asshole. You know? And especially in this era, people feel okay about watching videos on their phone at full volume in public, like who's, and nobody's correcting this behavior, but the phone conversations insidious because you're on the receiving end of one side of a conversation. Yeah. And I think when it's way worser is when it's in a foreign language. Yeah. And now I, I don't even understand what the fuck you're saying. And your language sounds horrible to me. And is it, I think the worst language, I don't know what he was, it may have been Vietnamese only because they don't have a volume control. I know. It's so loud. It's on like, dude, you know that you're in public. Yeah. Why are you fucking, it's it's and yelling in your language and it's, listen, we spoke Hungarian growing up in my house, but you know what? Yeah. What was that speakerphone feedback?

Speaker 3:          00:23:37       What we didn't do in public, you speak Hungarian because it's rude and it's, it excludes people. Yeah. You know what I mean? You speak fucking English when we were public asshole. The, the, the speaking in another language in public because you really have a secret to excluding. Yeah. Yes. It's disrespectful to the, you know, I see this shit all the time where people hold the phone in front of them. They're like, stop it right here. Right now. Stop it. Yeah. Go on at the airport. Yeah. Stop it. Yeah. Yeah, I know. And you're like, dude, like no one wants to hear this whole fucking thing. It's never about, you know, it's not, it's not about who won the Nobel prize or uh, you know, quantum theory. It's always like, we're going to meet you down at the baggage claim. All right. Yeah. Okay. Well, Susan gun to bring the cake. Yeah. She's going to bring the cake. Like what are you doing? It's total like it is that some people have, um, total disregard for the world around them and for other people. I don't even know if the book, I think some of it is conscious. I think it is conscious. Like they want you to hear what they're talking about. Sometimes feel like it's a something, you know,

Speaker 7:          00:24:55       it's like

Speaker 3:          00:24:57       I important you're standing there and you're like,

Speaker 7:          00:25:05       Yep,

Speaker 3:          00:25:08       interesting. None of us are sitting here minding our own business because that's the thing that stands out is that everyone, literally everyone else in those situations is considerate of everyone else. That's why that person stands out. You're the only one doing, doesn't care. Okay. What's your least favorite language though? Let's get into that. I'm going to go with, I don't like Russian. I have a bias though. We all have biases. Don't we can say is that I don't like rushing because culturally that's my tribe ish. There are cousins. Uh, so that hard sounding eastern bloc shit. Yeah. My shoulders go up around my years and never said, by the way, as someone who has no connection, it doesn't sound good to me. I don't like your brushes. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:25:57       I like hearing, I had to pick like, I don't mind hearing the romance languages. It just sounds soft, Freddie. I mean Portuguese. Yeah. Those are all like, when do you get to hear Portuguese? And Paul, I seldom get you hear that. But I'm saying like it's not, but when you hear like homicide it, I'm a halogen, Amazon, any language Israeli, go back to your fucking country regardless. Regardless. I'm saying I don't give a shit. I'm not talking specific cultures. Don't care. Drawful language. What's bothersome? Doesn't sound beautiful. I'm not at all just nice. That's not, is it terrible? Yeah. But uh, but I, I need to, yes. I know that somebody's Farsi speaking English. Like that is why it works. Or two awful, awful. Yeah. We're going to get, now that they're at the market, there's no onions and you're like, Jesus, dude, it's worse than you can't understand it cause you're like your conversations so dumb.

Speaker 3:          00:27:05       Yeah. God, it's so boring. People would just repeat the same things to each other over and over. It is, there is a split. There are people that are oblivious because you can look at someone with the fuck are you doing here? They're like, I don't know. And then there's people that it's a what it is. It's, it's a an attempt to show power. Yeah, because what you're saying is like, yeah, this is a moment where I can, I'm going to talk loudly in this room, dominating the space with my voice. You assholes have to hear when I'm talking about why time you and I were at a hotel, we were coming out of a nice restaurant and there was some guy on his speaker phone, I don't know if you remember it, but we were getting a valet. We're waiting for the valet and full, full volume, like from like sounding like Ivory Coast something and saw all, I mean actually I enjoyed him because I liked that accent, but the, it was just, he was so loud.

Speaker 3:          00:28:02       Yeah. It's so, it's just so deep and when you're tired and you're in the airport, you're like, I don't want to, I don't want to hear your fucking, I don't want to hear you bro. I agree a lot of, ah, basically I don't want to hear your conversation period or your video or the music. The worst. One time I was sitting next to a girl watching Korean soap operas. Here's how a Christ loud some people are as I'm on a plane a week ago and a kid has his iPad or whatever, or some toy, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. And I'm like, hey. And I look over and then his parent was like, Oh, don't forget that one. Like it was helping him be shit again. Yeah. And you're like, why don't you tell your kid to turn that down or lunch? Give them headphones. So headphones, the rest of us don't have to hear PPP.

Speaker 3:          00:28:50       PPP, it's obnoxious. You are obnoxious. One time I was on a plane and a guy was watching his movie, but he had his earbuds and, but the volume was pumping out full, full volume and it was a late night flight. And I'm eyeballing him, eyeballing and finally I go, excuse me, could you listen to that on your ear phones? And he goes, oh, I thought I was, I'm so sorry. And He, and then he plugged it in. That was the one time I did actually see a person last week do the same thing. Right. I didn't correct him, but what happened was a couple of sitting next to each other and star wars started. You can hear it in the cabin like Dun, Dun, Dun, and I see them going out with their headphones and they're like, and then, and then all of a sudden the guy goes, we're not plugged in.

Speaker 3:          00:29:37       I plugged it in, but that was, it's funny. Different, right? Like he's trying to civilized human people are fucking psychos though. It's it. It really is to the advent of the, the cellular phone. Yeah, it's the iPhone etiquette. We really haven't, we haven't figured out yet what proper etiquette is for the phone. I think that'll be, hopefully in the next few years, people go, all right at dinner. It shouldn't be on the fucking table. There should be an iPhone etiquette school or, or just societal norms that we should all adhere to from now on. Agreed. Or it's my first order of visiting anything now, by the way. Oh boy. Not going to answer that. That's a set up. Of course it is. No, it isn't. I'm reading a book right now. Red Notice, what does that red notice? Is there a lot of pictures in there?

Speaker 3:          00:30:26       Zinged you just reading it interesting. Uh Huh. What's that about? It's about this guy who has his grandfather started the communist party. Oh cool. And then he went on. It's a Russian basically real life thriller. So it's my enemy basically. Yeah. But as an entire spiel about the Russians. So I'm in the part right now where he's um, it was basically introducing how he came to work. He's a businessman, but in eastern Europe. Oh, very cool. So I didn't know you were interested in that. You should talk to my dad about that. He loves Connie and this stuff, but you're not reading anything right now.

Speaker 7:          00:31:06       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:31:07       Course. I read stuff all the time. But what are you reading right now? Uh, it's called the, the something of the gifted child. The, it's called the something of the gifted child. Yeah. I read a child psychology books, so I don't fuck up our kid. The drama of the gifted child. This lady has a review of that right here. Okay, here we go. I was reading it.

Speaker 7:          00:31:29       Hmm? Oh Shit. She's not even talking yet. That was my mistake. Okay, here we go. It's reading the book.

Speaker 3:          00:31:49       Yeah. Footage of me reading. I read kindles. I don't read that.

Speaker 7:          00:31:58       Mike is like a monster.

Speaker 3:          00:32:03       Pretty good review, right? Um, is that what the dream? That's the same thing. Do we get fart Mr Com? I think we did last week. I think we need to start doing something with it. I'm surprised nobody had fart mistress. I know. I'm really well, it just goes to show that the women doing the fart videos aren't that creative and that I could really put a dent in that industry. Really sell that to somebody. You know. Fart mistress. I mean to a real fart mistress. I would love to. Hey, anyone out there want fart mistress? This one owns it. I'll sell it to you for a reasonable price.

Speaker 1:          00:32:45       That's a long foof.

Speaker 3:          00:32:48       Whoa. That was a really good one. Really crazy. That's almost ass rapper. That's how my mother spoke English when she first got to this country. It's like she would call a fan of monster. I remember that little months took me, cause she didn't know how to say fan like monsters make noise with this lady said that her ass is like a monster. It's pretty neat and it's kind of accurate. I didn't, you have quite a uh, Brown day. I'm so glad you brought that up. You may want to hit the all board brown. Oh really? Oh okay. All right. He didn't know that was coming. Hold on.

Speaker 3:          00:33:37       So I went to a man friend disco this weekend. Thank you everybody that came out to my shows. They were super fun. It was really great. I had a lot of fun, met a lot of mommies and so anyways, on Saturday I go have Thai food by my hotel on the Embarcadero there and I don't eat fucking honkie food. You know what I'm saying? When I want flavor, I guess some God damn flavor will supposedly San Francisco. I mean you have so many great choices in San Francisco to head to like eat real authentic. Yeah. That loves the food there. So I go to this Thai place, I ordered my Panang curry and I was like, you make that shit spicy and don't make it fucking white girl spicy. Like I want legit heat on that bitch. I actually have a bit in my act right now about that is a seriously, seriously, is it because I ordered that way at Korean barbecue so much?

Speaker 3:          00:34:26       No, no. I demand that they give me spicy sooner. They'll go, oh, okay. Any hurdles? I order it and I ask for spicy and they bring it out and I'm like, Oh shit. Like they really, it was too much, but I couldn't send it back because I demanded it, you know what I mean? So I had to eat the dish anyways and push through the pain. It was hot as fuck dude. They, they didn't hold back on me at all. So like I have to do this, like I can't, I have to save face. So I eat it, I forget about it, I'm fine. And then showtime rolls round and the farts begin and I'd forgotten what I'd eaten earlier. I was like, why are these farts here? You know when you do that where you kind of are like, I'm farting, but I'm not sure why.

Speaker 3:          00:35:12       And then it occurred to me, I had that Thai food and it was like mystery solved. So I sit down to make brown and I'm having so many paint, it's so much pain because the farts are really violent, like hard farts and I fucking, I'm shitting, I'm shitting and it's showtime. Now I'm getting, I'm getting text messages from the club like, Hey, the show's at seven 30 you know that right? And I'm in my show outfit, like tights dress and I'm like, I'm shitting and it's bad and it's like a multi wiper and I don't have time to go shit to shower because it's showtime. Like I've, I just had to keep, rub, rub, rub, wipe, wipe, wipe, wipe, neverending wipe. There's, I've leaky. But there's so much toilet paper in the bowl, there's so much brown in the bull. It was so painful. So I flush and, and I'm like call it went down and then the water rises,

Speaker 5:          00:36:08       did the, the, the

Speaker 3:          00:36:11       starts to spill a little, little, little. And then miraculously it slowly goes back down. So it goes under when you told me that turns on the ground reminded me of Jacksonville. That's right. That's where tourists were on the comedy zone and that's where I had turns on the ground and I had to tell the hotel staff that there were two on. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:37:02       Classic. My Jam right there on the ground. I heard you on the ground on the ground.

Speaker 3:          00:37:30       Simpler made that. That was really good. So I got really close to tourists on the ground, but no turrets on the ground in San Francisco. But it was close. Dude. Tariff is bad and I didn't, like I said, it was just like a leaky but situation all night I kept wiping. It was terrible. Yeah. Do you get that too? I forget what the never ending wipe were like. You just keep wiping almost god. It's so upsetting. You know that brings up, this actually came in, you brought this up right now. This isn't planned. Look, this email came in.

Speaker 5:          00:38:03       I swear to God. How do blind people know to stop wiping? Hey Hitler's. I've been a big fan of, so this is mommy. Tina was in Fart next a few months ago. I've been binge listening you 40 plus hours a week having every second of it. I'm not all the way through, but I've always wanted to know one thing. I believe you're the people that helped me find out how do blind people know when to stop wiping. How have we gone this long without knowing this age? Old Question. Thank you for everything you do.

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       Look forward to the next time you are in Fart. Nixon. This is the funniest thing we've never discussed. I feel like we may have discussed it. Feels familiar. I really do think we'd discuss it but I think it's been a long time. They, I asked one time they wipe a bunch and then they do a bare hand wipe and they smelled it. They have a dog do it. Seeing eye dog. No, no, no. It's a reasonable question I think. I think the dog sniffs or be home. I think it was brown. I think you know, I think you just get a sense of it. Just like a a feel because you're so, you're so tied to your vision and helping you eventually. Like I think what happens is it becomes intuitive and they just go, I'm done. Now. It's a good theory. Well, if you're blind, I guess have someone write in for for you or you could write in how do they do it? They don't think they can take, right either. They don't type on an email. Sure they do. Are they have Braille keyboard type? You use your Braille keyboard. Yeah. Let us know. Let us know how you got all these mysteries and tell us about the learning curve. Tell us about bad times. You guessed wrong. Don't just be like, yeah, of course I know how to do it and tell us. Give us a little insight.

Speaker 3:          00:39:58       This is so important. The work we're doing on your mom's house, like when I asked if we're trying to, people knew they're retarded and now we're going to find out if blind people know how they're done wiping. That's pretty influencing. We're really helping society. We are helping a lot. We haven't yet mentioned that. Pretty soon we're going to be joined by a guest today. Mr Aristotle Schaefer is coming in really short for Aristotle, not his name. Definitely not. No, I wasn't Jewish. No, no. It's a Greek name. I know that. Um Oh wait, I feel like I have more thoughts on this blind wiping situation though. Uh, yeah. Okay. Do you have any more opinions on it? Are you saying that thinking about it, I feel like that's a wild okay. Oh here's what I was gonna say. Cause sometimes browns are misleading. Like the other week I had what I thought would be a disastrous cleanup.

Speaker 3:          00:40:52       Yeah. I think it was hot and I was like, oh this is going to be a nightmare. And I went to wipe and the paper was totally clean. Yeah, it's not, it's just not a, a shirt, a science, you know? Yeah. Are you texting airy? What's he doing? Just letting them know one time. I don't know. I hate when people are late. Let me to, Oh God, I just fuck you know what? I thought it was funny as an man friend disco that uh, the women were talking about, cause when I lived there in the 90s, it was hard to find a boyfriend cause all the dudes are gay now. Now they're not now. They're not all gay now they're all nerds. I here because of the tech industry moving up there that there's a lot more straight guys, but that they're all socially not adapt.

Speaker 3:          00:41:38       So they're all dorks. Big Old dorks. Yeah. You're, the whole tech industry has moved into that area. It's completely changes. It's also priced out basically the whole city. It's terrible. It must be hard. It was hard when I was living there and now it's got to be way worse than I ever want to move to another city though. Yeah. But then I go, not la like I just remember it's not la and then I go back here. But don't you ever want to live in a city city again though or no? Not with the kid. I think it's to get rid of him. Now, here's what's hard about SF. Is that just getting groceries? Like you don't have a car there cause it's so hard to have a car because there's no parking. You still want to live on the ocean though, right? Ocean beach front 100%.

Speaker 3:          00:42:20       You love Moraine. I live in Marin, Marin county across the Golden Gate Bridge there and would live in here in La County. If you live anywhere. Beach beach side, anywhere mountain Maribou. Yeah. Besides, uh, Santa Monica. Monica Santa. No. Redondo. Venus Manhattans for no, like Manhattan Man's to Broey. Sometimes for me it boils down her most is actually the mode that's to broey. Yeah. For Life. Yeah. Like maybe you're the fucking thing bro. Yeah, but now I like more seclusion. I don't like as many people at Palo Sverre days so far though. I know our Oxnard's too far north. I know the most desirable places are the ones here and they're so expensive. I know. Can I tell you why I want us to retire though? Maui, Maui, we're all like the, the nut bet. Like the Wayne Dyers, the Doreen Virtue's, all these nut bags that I like. Like we're all the, the meditation retreats are like with Ron doss again to Maui. I've never been there either, but I feel like you and I would really enjoy it. Wrote down. I think you and I would really dig Hawaii. It's like a retirement,

Speaker 9:          00:43:30       eh, Eh, Eh,

Speaker 3:          00:43:34       I don't really mind telling Nike. Yeah. That was crazy fun. Fuck yeah it was, but I wouldn't live there cause there was only like 3000 people on that, too small. Not too small, but I always got it going on and that's, that's pretty accessible. We can eat snack, a Damien nuts every day cause they're there. That's, that's where they come from. Row Out of the ground. They're there. You just walk around in their snack. A Damien net. It's everywhere. People just go. Do you want a glass of pineapple? Pineapple. That's right guy. You're so smart. You're so smart. Can we talk about our, Our dad's day and my smurf day yesterday. Yesterday you Sir Paul Mccartney. Yup. My niece Grayson. Yup. Some other kid, Isabella Rossellini all had birthdays. Yeah, yeah, sir. Paul Mccartney. That's what he likes me to call him. And Sir Paul and I spent the morning stuck on a plane.

Speaker 3:          00:44:29       I woke up, I slept for three hours, was fun and uh, but you got me this gorgeous ring. Thank you very much. It's a really outstanding, I'm going to wear it on my specialty thing. He did a wonderful job. You don't know when you buy jewelry for someone. You're like, did I do well? I love it. No, until they actually, you can tell by the reaction. You were like, what? You know why? Because I'm so eastern block that I immediately think, how much did you pay for this? I don't deserve this. I don't want to wear something expensive. I get that. Or a card or Ellis is college. Yeah. I'm glad we spent it wisely. Yeah. Well I get on him to go to Yale for four years or do you want to eat a ring? That's what I decided on. I know. I just get weird about jewel jewelry.

Speaker 3:          00:45:09       It's a nice ring jewelry. That's how you say it. Jewelry, not jewelry. Jewelry is free and wanted a contest as you get this shooting hoops. Yeah. Well then so you got me the super nice ring and you got me some PJ's like talking about Pj's and you put your pj's on at night. I'm not really a PJ guy. No. I like boxers, but it's one of those things. Do you ever have things where you go, you imagine you want to be that thing? You know what I mean? Like, yeah. I'm the same way with robes. Basically I see someone in a robe. I'm like, I want that row and then I get a robe. I use it twice. I know I lose it. I forget where it is in the house. Pj's I see someone in a and like an a catalog wearing their and I'm like, ah, it looks so comfortable.

Speaker 3:          00:45:59       I like sleeping in boxers. That's how I feel about high heels. Like I'll buy a pair. I wear them. Once you write the exception for the PJ's thing is sometimes they make like sleep shorts or the real loose baggy shorts. I like those to sleeping, but I don't like an actual Pajama Ensemble. You know, I don't wear it. It's a little corny for guys. Some guys are into it. You know, those guys are non your reward for those. Yeah, they're definitely challenging the intersectional narrative, if you know what I mean. I read that too. It's to cry. It's just like the gays that somebody, this orange is the new black actress is non binary and somebody for real mountain bike and she really is out and she's, she's really, how are you? What's your name? What's Your Pronoun? You're gonna die. You're gonna die. Can I read you what she wrote today? Her name is a Asia Kate Dillon. She's, she's one of the white girl white supremacists character. So your name again? Asia.

Speaker 3:          00:47:05       Kate Dillon. And she plays one of the, like I said, one of the white supremacist girls on orange is the new black. So she wrote, I think people receive my message of being nonbinary and feeling she's really pretty and she's a great actress. Uh, receive my message of being nonbinary and feeling gender identity as a spectrum better because I'm white, was assigned female at birth and on a super popular television show, Asia answers. Honestly, my friends who were assigned male at birth, people of color, particularly those who identify as Fem have an incredibly hard time. They're ostracized, ostracized, and there are very few safe spaces for them. I'm grateful for my visibility and the conversations that are happening now. And I just, I like the comment. So someone wrote, thank you Asia for complicating the narrative and keeping it intersectional. I don't even know what that means either as why I love it.

Speaker 3:          00:47:55       Oh wait. Okay. So she's on this new show. She's the new non nonbinary Jillian on billions. Yeah, she's on shift. You're calling her a she and we don't know if that's her preferred Pronoun, but Oh, you said her again to shit. But this person is on both shows. Yes. Billions and black. She's just killing it. They're killing. Sorry. They're killing it. There is this other person writes, there's also living in a country where the language doesn't gender neutral pronouns. So you have to invent them and that makes it harder for people to understand. All right, so, uh, what else you got other things going on? Maybe happening.

Speaker 3:          00:48:36       I don't know why it makes me laugh so hard on this stuff. I know that God love him. The God help these people. Remember that kid? Jesus Christ. Oh, poopy kisses. Memory. You wanted me to bring back poopy kisses? Yeah, I made a note of it. Who'd cases? Yeah. You said to me the other day, we got to bring back poopy kiss. It's a nice way to spin. So you're farting. Yeah. You're, you're farting poop because it's a pubic has for your face. Feel like I need to call airy call arrows. Uh, I don't know. Let me see. Because he doesn't understand. He doesn't like texts like a normal person. He has like a flip phone. Yeah. He's so weird. Yeah, it's super annoying, Huh? Cheers. I was joking with me. All right, hold on. He's not dying here. Oh, he's here. Let's stop for a second. Let's go get them. Let's challenge. All right. Yeah. We had to, we had to put, we mentioned it earlier, but it's official. It's now a thing. It's here.

Speaker 10:         00:49:29       Sorry.

Speaker 3:          00:49:30       Guest has arrived. You'll Joe mother fucker. Yo. Aristotle Shaffer. So welcome Mary Ari is that here's my ex and my son on, sorry. Sorry. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Gimme a second. Gimme a second. Um, wait a minute. Nope. Nope. How about now? Yeah. Oh, can you hear yourself? That's beautiful. Thank you. Now we got it work though. Is Ari a Hebrew for like, can I get a discount? What does that actually mean?

Speaker 11:         00:50:03       Yeah. Actually I hope a bloggers writing this. I will know blogger ever defend the Jews taking your piss for 15 years. Yeah. What is Arie? Short form? It's all pronounce Ari. Uh, it is a show for Aria. Arielle Eliahu Aria. It means RDA means a lion and Hebrew. Oh boy. A lion. Yeah. Wow. I on my hair was way more resembling. Yeah, I think you're meant to have crazy

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       hair. Oh yeah. It was great. Great Hair. I see people now with the bushy fuck, you know, yeah. Ball. And I'm like, God damn. Yeah. What's your middle name? David. And in English and in Hebrew it. So Ari, who already are you? David, if you ask any Jew if their name is not David, if you would like, what's your middle name? Just guest David. By the way, I always, this always makes me crazy when people are on as guests on podcasts including when I've been guest on podcasts and it's like hey I have something and then we don't address it forever. Yeah, so I think at least once right out of the gate, let's mention that on July 9th 18th 18th Ari Shaffir has a Netflix special set it called. I'll take those two pennies and it's coming out. It's a double special. Is that actually what that would be a good name for this special, I'll take those two petites and the double special that I would actually work, I didn't think of it is a double special.

Speaker 5:          00:51:36       Does it work like the way Chappelle's does where it's like a collection and like one place and the pills are like, I don't know why they do it like that. They're unrelated. Completely. But that is that yours is actually two separate things will play. Wow Dude, that's incredible. I really envisioned it that way. Does that sound through street? But that's where you really get to finish a special yeah. Start number two. Start. I'm going to take a break. Unreal man. So I don't understand. So you'll film I'm a year apart or simultaneous? No, I filled them summer tat. So I had, I did a cap city and um, I changed clothing. I finished it. Thank you. Good night. And then the claps and I was like, Hey, don't go anywhere. That's what got like a shitload left. And then I changed clothes on stage. You changed the, set it off.

Speaker 5:          00:52:18       She just said we left cause I want it to have a similar look. So I changed it to like the lighting switch, just like distressed wood background. And I changed the back lighting and the, and the foreground lighting. I flipped him for the second one and then I changed my clothes. Similar but different. I know, but like why don't you tell them the kind of the concept? Yeah. Half of it's about children and my feelings of it. So it goes up. Your cute, it's fun, right? It's not exactly a mystery. Why won't you let me touch him? Is it because of germs or, or to encourage a stranger? Strange men naturally good boundaries. In other words, some kids his age, uh, uh, somebody goes like, hey, like that. And they run up and hug him. Our kid doesn't do this. Trust people. Fuck are you looking for yeah. Yeah, it's great. Um, I as you know, have contacts at Netflix and I reached out and was able to obtain a clip from. Yeah. So here's a little taste better. The Jews of the Western Wall. No, no, it's not. Okay.

Speaker 12:         00:53:26       I fucking knew it. I fucking know. And this is not even an Orthodox Bar Mitzvah is a woman. Doing it on a lot in my upbringing is terrible. Wild. So talk more about your upbringing,

Speaker 5:          00:53:44       the way the children not having kid or your feelings about children is one. And then what's the other thing is about adulthood. So I give it up for kids a little bit. I understand small parts of them, but then the other side is like a life where you really just can't have, if you, if you have like a wife and kids. Yeah. Like can I give you a perfect example that like it just shows you kind of different thoughts. Yeah. You, I'm going to New York. Yeah. And you're like, why aren't you staying for like a few days?

Speaker 5:          00:54:13       And it's the, it's the normal thought for a single guy that doesn't have a family, but like any guy with a family would be like, what are you talking? Why would I stay there for a few days? I actually lived most of my life to, you said it once where it's like, Oh man, I wish I could do it. I think it was, I moved to New York, like, I wish I could do that. I'm like, why don't you, you're like, I'm married. And I was like, Oh yeah. Hmm. Yeah. I mean I wish I could do it in the sense that it's like I go, I wish I could fucking go parasailing tomorrow too. Right, right, right, right. It's an enjoyable kind of like, oh, that's cool you get to, but I mean, I'm not going to do that. You know? You know what's funny when I think about Ellis, there's only a couple of real things I I don't like about having a kid like, and this is so stupid, but I don't like not sleeping as much as we used to or sleeping in motherhood.

Speaker 5:          00:54:58       That is the only thing that really bothers me. Number one, I covered that in a special tiredness that all you guys, but it's then you weigh it against this thing called ambivalence where you're able to simultaneously have contradictory feelings. I learned about this and not everything is black and white. I didn't know those things are not and most people are not black and white. We tried to make everybody black and white like that guy sucks. She's great. Killed somebody like I know what the charity is still works. Of course, most people are complicated. It's all good to go to Fiji and that we're going to have to put off. Right, and that's something we could literally do. Why don't you borrow? Granted. I'm not telling how to parent your kid. You look, why don't you leave a bunch of food in a bowl and then just like cover up the sockets with his little covers, teach them resilience, self sufficiency.

Speaker 5:          00:55:51       Now your upbringing, you are orthodox Jews. We know now. Did your mom wear a wig? Like is it that Orthodox man? Yeah, my sister was away all the time. My mom would generally wear like a hat except like high holidays and then sure. Where we're going to had I thought, I think I wonder if she would kind of wicked anymore. Have you seen her naturally at home? She's fine. And what was she, a blonde or something? Naturally she's been dying her hair for so long. I think she's great naturally. Is that possible? Not, yeah, I think she's blonde. Crazy guys. What do you think I should take the 10 10 flight or the 11:15 PM

Speaker 12:         00:56:25       10 oh, what time are you trying to get in? Well, that's the thing. They get in about an hour apart, either our six 45 or seven 45 six 45 to traffic where you're going through. Okay. Okay. Okay. Did it take me an hour and a half to get to my hotel when I did got them? Oh, it's nothing. I don't know whether it's no good subway system. I know why it's a cabs and the union field won't allow the subway to go all the way there anyway. So do you think it's rooted in your, did you do, did you hate your childhood? Is that when you man, I loved it. I loved it. Seriously. Child is the best. What are you talking about? Oh yeah. I didn't have a crazy mom was there not trying to commit suicide in front of me because you think that somebody with my background with, cause I used to be like that too, where I was afraid of, I didn't want a family.

Speaker 12:         00:57:15       I didn't really think I would end up marrying. But now that I have, and I love it because I liked the stability and the security with most people though. Right. What's going to have kids? They're like, oh that is what I like. So how, what, what like where, what was the defining moment for you? Where you're like, I know for me I think it's more reason where I was like for awhile I was like, of course I'll have kids we're supposed to do. And then I lost my religion and then it was like, and I moved out here 25 and ask you this when you told me one time about no, no, about stopping the religious thing. How much you research that borrow Fatone I clip real quick. Sorry. Was it a light bulb moment? What was that like abandoning religion? Was it like a one like you're like fuck that dates back to a, to a thing that it took me like a year to like ponder in my head until I realized, oh, but you really did ponder for a while then.

Speaker 12:         00:58:04       And what was the epiphany? Was it that God doesn't exist or that this particular system of religion is not? I don't have a belief in it. I first, I was like gnostic where I was like, I don't know. It was cute. I was sleeping in a, in a dorm and he is Shiva in Israel. And, um, we had a light bulb over the beds for reading and, um, you could like twist it up and I remember this, I do see this is the story. Yeah, you can put a cup on top of it. So John at the light. So I was like, cool, I can sleep. But then the cop kept like sliding off cause it's like circular frame to it and it just keeps sliding off. And I was like, maybe I'll just turn the light off. But my, my door was like, my window was like right by the entrance to the, to the dorm.

Speaker 12:         00:58:42       So I'm like, people are going to see if I turn my light off and it's, everyone's like religious Jewish. You can't do it on Friday night. You weren't allowed to have a light. Sorry, I skipped. Yeah, you can't use electricity sabbath. Yeah. You can leave it on I'll all the whole time or you can turn it off the whole time. Oh, go on and off. So drowning it out as, okay. It's still on. You're not changing the spark. Uh, this is such weird shit, but like a distinction to make. Yeah. It's funny too how many of those things are like tied to a practice and they become symbolic but, but, but their actual origin is not like, no, but I'm saying like with food eating, let's say, right, like people stay away,

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       I don't know from certain foods, but the origin of that was like a practical thing, you know? Right. They would say, yeah, like some, like some foods wouldn't, you know, hold well for certain people get sick. So they go, we don't eat that and then years later they don't get sick. That sort of thing. Yeah. Yeah. But why did they become symbolic? I'm just eating

Speaker 12:         00:59:42       rob. I was always just, so the reason we don't need stuff is not because of like tape worm or anything, just because God said, oh well nevermind. Practical reasons that, but that's probably, if God was invented, that's probably one of the things that were in his epiphany though. I the thing wouldn't stay on, I kept thinking like, I'll just turn my light off. I just turn it off, which you're not allowed to do. But that was looking to get caught. And then I thought about it later where it's like, who am I worried about getting caught by man or God? And if I really believe in God, who didn't want me to do that, then I wouldn't even be a question. You don't do that. Yeah. So I was like, why am I questioning it? And it finally came to light. I don't think I believe in God. I don't think it's in me. And then once I figured that out, I was like, I think I should stop. And I went to Taco Bell. You turn that light off, Huh? Where were you at? A university in New York and like a Spanish Harlem one 85th and Amsterdam. You went to Taco Bell? I want to talk about I barfed.

Speaker 11:         01:00:37       Yeah.

Speaker 12:         01:00:40       What did you order? What was the onpro 20 Tacos for fucking $1 off, whatever it is. I don't know if it was because of shitty food or dealt. I'm not really sure. We've been such big fans of Neil Hamburger. Look that up. I'll pull it up right now. Neil hamburgers because he started to change.

Speaker 5:          01:00:57       No, the comment, you know him right? Uh, hold on. It's so funny. His Twitter feed is great. Oh really? He does this semi-regularly where I want to talk about this brown. I had no let's not, let's not lose track of his uh, his story here either. But yeah

Speaker 11:         01:01:16       you just mentioned this. Did you get so much stuff going on and got to like, yeah. So he finds people's tweets about getting sick from Taco Bell and research and there's a lot of them. Oh my God. So like go ahead and read it out loud. I want to talk, I want to talk about the last time I had it, I almost thought the Taco Bell I work at got mice and bugs all over this, their place, this sick fuck a Nigga got food poisoning from tuck about cause I don't know if that meant because or cousin I was for sure. I did a presentation today on back on the bacteria that cause food poisoning. I think I got food poisoning from talking about ironic as fuck. Talk about getting to cover, talking about, talking about for the food poisoning. The day after graduation, my boyfriend and I never had a wheel is Burt taco bell. This rope food endless, and he does this every few months. Wow. One day day. It wasn't like isolated over three years.

Speaker 11:         01:02:23       I found a roach in my food. Never went back there. Also wrote Shit. I'm mad at Taco Bell. I'm a cart. Had a whole fat ass ratchet, chill in the lobby. So the Taco bell diarrhea thing is true about here's what golf go a little Taco bell three years ago. Went to Los Lunas domestic. We'll talk about founder here in our food. Went back today, founder here on our food. That's for me twice. Yeah. My friend got to talk about it and went to the hospital when again the next day and got food boy. He's like, I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:03:00       Taco bell never fails to give me food poisoning. Your nasty ass food establishment gave me food poisoning. Taco Bell. Never again food. The words food poisoning I'm talking about. I think you just has to search.

Speaker 11:         01:03:13       Let's talk about that book comes up. No. Yeah. Food poisoning. Three different times. I done when I, so I wanted to talk about today in Mount Vernon and I'd done God pours like or some shit like God bro, really be shitting. I am crazy. Sean Fan Account.

Speaker 5:          01:03:34       Oh Fan. I that was her. I almost my heart but isn't in the uh, the amount of them astounding like this many people. This is countless. Well, you know, the meat is supposedly supposedly, supposedly worse than prison. This blessed one here

Speaker 11:         01:03:51       and Taco bell are good. That shit has a Nigga suit. Well accessed. I don't care for your choice of words, but uh, central med I can come up like, oh damn, that's great. Yeah, I love what are good cops like that? Just senators on top. Like you ever see Colin Quinn's like a tongue in cheek? Like, oh, we're conservative tweets.

Speaker 5:          01:04:10       Yeah. That's so funny. Oh, his Twitter account. It never lets it and I'm joking. Never know that would be like, yeah. And it's partly, you have to like really, except that, that, that there's gonna be people out there that believe that you're serious. And I think that's a real struggle for like a lot of comics. But I think that he is so that he fully goes for it. Also, if you don't fool a few people, it's just not quite as fun. Exactly. Any Kaufman how to get people to like get the fuck off stage or it'd be like, I like his spirit, his stuff. Like there's just nothing like hearing laughter out there healing the healing power of laughter like Collin tweets, that kind of shit. Yeah. That's a smart move. Done that with Rogan instead of covering them up. I don't know. I think that that might be true. I don't think it's made for that. Exactly. Your mom's stomach for those. Hey Dude, what are you doing? I'm sorry your mom has made for holding up my mark. Stern. Thanks. Glad you're here because you and I, we share a common bond that we both love to shit and yeah,

Speaker 12:         01:05:18       every time I mentioned it people like, Oh Christina. I'm like, Oh yeah. I guess we do have our kindred poos barely on. Yeah, we got this big day toilets. The US who goes straight to the shower. You saved money on toilet paper first of all, beside the point, but is it that flip thing? Yeah. Uh, second of all, it's the clinic you can get. It's the cleanest. No drawing. No John. Now what mud you to shit to shower. I want to talk about your experience with it. I believe the first time was kind of like my epiphany with Judaism where it was just like, it just sort of happens. You know? I was had no toilet paper. Oh, I looked under the sink. Oh I think I did. Yeah. I think it was in my old place on sunset and I looked into this thing and I was like, no.

Speaker 12:         01:05:57       I'm like fuck, what am I going to do? Huh? And then it hit me straight to shower straight down. That's interesting. Cause it necessity is the mother of invention. It is now with me. It was that I have what is known as the never ending wipe. I get leaky button where I wiped by wiped by wipe and the paper's always brown and I found that the only way to stop the breach is if I shower my butthole. Yeah. Then the brown stops coming down. You get like greasy, Greasy League rec league. It's just solid brown. No, no. It's like a mush. Just like a, like a s schmear. Oh yeah. Like I don't know. I don't know what that is. Like a sun dried tomato cream cheese. Yeah. Small. But anyway, we got this new toilet, this robot toilet that, those are great. It's a wash led. It's a big day in your toilet and you don't have to go into the shower physically. Right. Cause some of that's annoying. Like I don't want to

Speaker 5:          01:06:53       my pants off. Take a towel to dry off this thing though. This thing, what's amazing is you have different water pressure options. Oh, oscillating pulsating options. What do you mean water temperature options? Yeah. Cold, warm, hot. Yup. It's pretty amazing. So basically you can, you're done. Yeah. You can have a nice stream to kind of start. Kind of get your ass holiday it. Yeah. And then you can fucking gas it up and have a fire hose and wow. And really get, get it gone away that you couldn't be, you can let that thing run for a minute. Put toilet paper back there. Nothing going clean as a west side. And there's a drier cat. Barilla. Explain this to me once about wet, wet, wipe it as opposed to dry wine. You know what though? I find, what have he said? I don't think that's enough. We'll just in general using water. Water's great. Yeah. He said he's, I was like, no, I just use it was back then. And he goes, oh no, you can actually do the toilet paper. Yeah. And he was like, look, and he took some, a little bit of Coca Cola. Yeah. Put It on my table. And then he goes, okay, let that sit for a minute now wipe it up with a dry towel and that feel the table. I'm like, yeah, a little sticky goes. Yeah, a little sticky. Yeah. Get some water. I didn't know that he was such an expert that

Speaker 12:         01:08:02       questions for rem. So fascinating. So I'll tell you about Southeast Asia toilet. Oh, I can't. Okay, wait, wait. Hold on. I'll save it. Save it. Okay. Wait, wait. I've been dying to talk to you about this. Okay. Yeah. So now when you do shit to shower in your world,

Speaker 13:         01:08:16       do you do a cursory wipe and exploratory wipe or you literally dump your shit straight to shower without even a cursory wipe?

Speaker 12:         01:08:24       Okay. I'm going to ask you, you have your opinion later. What do you do? Occasionally I'll go. Nothing but cause doesn't really. I'll do it constantly wipe because it's like, what if you trip on the way? It depends if I have a bathmat. There you have it. I don't want to ruin a bathmat full dump. Fulled up. Just stand up and go in the shower. Well I can reach over from the tour that I turned the hot water on other places a little harder. Um, but yeah, just go full and then we get to watch all the shit rundown. The sick. I can psycho. Remember in psycho, which is bleeding out and the drain, the drain blood, you get that you guys have run down your leg, which is usually horrible, but it's not going to stick.

Speaker 13:         01:09:00       Right? It's your shower. What do you do? Okay. Now because

Speaker 12:         01:09:04       he's a little bolt, it's on all the time thing for me.

Speaker 13:         01:09:08       And I do live with someone so I try to be considered, I wouldn't put Dukie he's not in the bathroom. Yeah. But he's going to shower there after me and I don't want shit in our shower necessarily. Right. So I do an exploratory consideration. Why have now? Sometimes I have just known. I'm like, that wasn't a massive brown. There's not, there's nothing on my asshole that was a clean break. It's fine.

Speaker 12:         01:09:30       All right. We kind of stay here for this, uh, this noise. This is like the tickets, tickets as a journalist writing stories about, I was like seven feet,

Speaker 13:         01:09:44       but um, yeah, I'll only do it if I'm confident that there's no brown on my butt hole. I will just go straight to shower if I'm confident and, and sometimes I am. Okay. You have a bleed out of my vagina. Yeah. Oh, right, right. It's different. Yeah. That's normal. Yeah. Do you, are you still bleeding out of your asshole?

Speaker 12:         01:10:01       Not Through my whole chip in Southeast Asia. And when I got back the second day was full blood ago. No strippers. Really. He's talking about this. What do you think? Wow. Do you think that is an internal hemorrhoid? I've asked the doctor. He was like, you're good at that. Blood's too dark. Do you see any of this in Asia so far? Yes. Flute. I don't know what she was. Was putting your list the way you play flute? I know who the other people, oh, oh, holy shit. Oh, she's putting other two seem shocked or animate. Wow. Flute with her VGM guys. You do that. Could you push out air that way? No, I've never been able to Queef on command. Now he's loving it. She's like, what the, that's a real talent though. She's also playing a tune. She's not just blowing out anyways. Also hitting the keep.

Speaker 12:         01:10:55       That's right. Yeah. It's a real skill. Anything like that you see in your job. Last time I went to Thailand like two years ago, what's a, uh, a pop harm the street in Thailand at a women? These women, is that Bangkok, Bangkok. They gave you a rolled up piece of, uh, well first they give a balloon, like hold it above your head and you're like, why? Boy? And then they shoot darts out of the vaginas and pop your balloon. Wow. Then you applaud for that. I assume it's not sexual at all. It's just talents. Then you roll up a piece of paper into a funnel, hold that over your head like, what are you doing? And then they start peeling bananas and you're like, no. And then they ship it out and get it into the Little Cup you've made. What's the trick? What's the, there's, there's gotta be a circus trick. Their practice, they get to Carnegie Hall.

Speaker 12:         01:11:44       That can't be legit. No Way, man. That I've seen, they put it in there, pops out. Wow. I don't have a vagina. I don't know. Wow. Got to be able to suck air in before you put the object in. Because I've seen girls that can queef on command. I've had friends that can do it and you lay on your back and you suck in the air. I had a roommate that did that with his asshole. No, no, no, just the air thing. But like right on, like he would just get on, he could do it on all fours or lay on his back and just all day he'd go. Really? Yeah. Wow. What a superhero. It was really cool. Yeah. I wonder if they have like a wrestling style school for that, for shooting stuff out of your vagina where it's like you're not ready yet, but I want to get my accreditation. Let's talk about the toilets in Asia. Okay, so they have these, if they're not squat toilets, I hate those. They're pretty bad. I hear that it's better for you.

Speaker 12:         01:12:47       I love how much removed ourselves from people actually hiring us. No apology necessary to look somebody. It's an Asian person saying it so it's not an impression. Yeah, there's just giving out directions. Who knows? So they have the squatters, they had the squad, but a lot of times will they have toilets in hostels and stuff. They have toilets, but they have these bum guns, which is just like, you know how I want to sync, you'll get like the thing you get to pull out. And as a host, but without the, uh, the, um, what's it called? The spray. So it's just a street and you put that into your butt or towards your butt and you just spray it out. And then like you said, you've got that one wipe and it's almost clean. Did you like that? Did you prefer that to your LLC?

Speaker 12:         01:13:39       Yeah, you can't throw out. I got used to it. No Shit shouts the best. But you can't throw out your toilet paper in the toilet. Right? Cause they all still up. Throw in the trashcan. Fal is shit. It smells horrible. So one of my good friends is married to a woman from Mexico and when her family came, they would throw stuff out in the Trashcan, toilet paper like, but like I love it. Used toilet paper, toilet paper, and you guys don't have a bum gone. So like, aw yeah. So there's this big wads of shit. Not like they're getting one last white, they're doing the whole thing in there. And he was like, you gotta stop doing this. And they just so habitual, we're talking like their 40 years of doing this. So they put some, he had a type signs you put flushing. Yeah, that's, that's the, uh, the opposite of that in those hostile where it's like, Hey, I know you used to where you are.

Speaker 12:         01:14:30       You can't flush toilet over here. Uh Oh, hey, I had a question. Oh Hey, we had an email today. How do blind people know when to stop wiping? What are your thoughts on that test? And their sense of taste is higher than most people thought it was a thing where they eventually do a bare hand thing and then they just go, oh, there's nothing there. But they'd have to like, they couldn't go like half of that. I want to how close I am. Right, right. Like you look at toilet paper when you're out, when you don't have a shower, you look at it, you're like, okay, I'm about halfway there. You look at it three quarters of the way there. Yeah, that's true. You don't just keep going until it like, this feels dry. Oh, I've been way done. Right, right, right. Maybe you smell the toilet paper.

Speaker 12:         01:15:10       Why do you have to smell your bare hand? Oh, that's a great tweak. What you just did right? He just stepped it up a great, wait, what are you saying? Because I'm an observational person. Why? Why are you, why do they have to smell their bare hand? Like you said, why not smell the toilet paper? Oh, I see what that's like because one of them told me this what they do really well. So I got this for you. Park with a Ryan O'Neal and uh, I mean 10 middleware, Griffith Park, just walking around. Okay. And uh, 10 minutes in I was like, I didn't shut this morning and I have to shit. Ooh. He's like, really? I'm like, no, I'll hold it, hold it three more minutes. Like I'm not holding it, man. I got to go. He was like, how are you going to wipe? And I'm like, well, he had a full bottle of water. I'm like, put that. He was like, what do you, what? What do you mean no, don't do this? And I was like, yeah, I have. Did it have the sports top?

Speaker 12:         01:16:06       Just kind of like one of these arrowhead bottle and then, uh, I shit on a hill so it really squat shot, which I'm used to now I've got experience. You get away from people got out and went down the hill a little bit, cut to it. Got to like a big Bush behind me. So people that were on the road on the path that I could see. If you were way down and you looked up, you could for sure see a man squatters. They thought it was homeless. I didn't have my shirt on the squatting technique because I imagine what's problematic is that you might shit on your jeans. Absolutely. You learned to lean backwards. There's also a pull your jeans forward. Let me, uh, let the legs. Yeah, hold on. Um, I I want to watch, I don't need to see that. You pretty much get the idea from, you want to go around the corner there.

Speaker 12:         01:17:00       He's got his pants down right now. He's got some mushroom boxer shorts and he's standing and show, sorry. Pulled his pants down to his underwear. Dan, please put them back on for the lab. We have dogs in here. He's showing, please don't pull your pants down. Squatting right into the pan. He's squatting, but you're squatting straight. So everything's at a perfect angle. Yes. Okay, so you're hanging, your pants are now above. Okay, so you're really, the key is that you really squat back a little bit. You squat full shots, right, Tom? Oh God. The touching the toilet is a real issue. I have big long balls. Yeah. So that's an issue. But I was on a hill and Griffith Park. No big deal right now. When you were doing that at Griffith Park, what about the weeds and the brush touching your dick and your balls and your butthole and all that? Some dried leaves definitely touched it. Didn't care for it. So you're saying it's all about the lean, like what you kind of did the way you were squatting is how I've seen like Chinese guys smoking in Chinatown. Yeah, they're used to it. They always sit like that. Yeah. The slot, the Stud fullback squats up with Dan. Your balls are so big, so big. So then I poured water on my, my hands

Speaker 5:          01:18:21       immediately as it's wet, took it to the butt and kind of wiped. Oh you take, you did it with your hands and then it got more water. Wipe more water wife? No, didn't dig in with nails, didn't want to stick my nails and then I was forced by Ryan to wipe my hands in dirt afterwards. Yeah. And then you wash your hands later. I'm hoping. Yeah. How much? Like do you get a lot of ball attention when you're with like are they like, oh he's a great ball of like the big thing with a couple of times. Yeah. I've had a couple girls go like, man I love these balls really? But like twice now. Are you really into your own balls then? Like is that a big, like if you were making your list where you're like definitely like play with my balls. I think.

Speaker 5:          01:18:56       Comedically they're good weapons. Yeah. How saggy they are. Yeah. I mean if there were a nice tight ones it wouldn't be as funny as it is. It really a turn. I'm saying like if, if you were like, if a woman was like, what, what do you like what we're about to have sex? Where you'd be like, definitely play with my balls. Okay. So it's not like your thing I'm saying I don't mind it. It's kind of Nice actually, but it's not like I need that. It's not like you need it. You, I mean, I like it, but I mean it's not like I wouldn't be like, if you don't tell on my balls, we had a problem. How big were Ari's balls? They just, why not looking at all was like six balls. The left one has a lot lower. Like a, it looked like a half mad pizza dough kind of thing. There was just like, it didn't look too hairy. Got a glimpse. Kind of like a teenager's beard.

Speaker 5:          01:19:44       Just an occasional in who there you do a lot of trimming or no, nothing really zip. I got to do a lot of that. Really? No, no. What are you half Peruvian, Peruvian and I, you know, whatever. But um, it's a lot. I don't know. It's a lot of hair. I don't, I'm not like, oh, actually I have one of my friends who like him fall down. They're not bald. I like a good cleanup. I think that it's important to at least be a little hygienic. I don't like so much hair that it's annoying. It too much. Yeah. It can get away from you stop storing at some point though. Yeah, it does, but sometimes I look down there, I'm like, oof. Yeah. I mean I just need like a haircut. You don't want to Tuft. Yeah, no, that's gross. And then it's two velcro way when it's too long.

Speaker 5:          01:20:30       Sometimes it looks like the hedge, just like peeking out of the woods. You know? Like my Dick just heard something like, what's going on? Like groundhog's Day, a few weeks of winter back in polyps. Is that what you have polyps? Is that in your butt hole? You said you have and can you do something to stop them from Bono? He said, I could have surgeries is not worth it. He's like, it might not work. And it's just like invasive and you've never, have you ever seen Jew clam, excuse me? Or He's going to show or not right now. I can't do it. It doesn't sound really, it's so bad. I saw it in person. I was like, dude, I was in a capsule. I wasn't kept city. Yeah. Re we put that video out to promote my special. I saw it and I remember that I pulled, uh, I was so traumatized that I pulled Brian aside was like, he need to go to the hospital. I'd never seen anything like that. I know it's crazy and that isn't a problem. Like that shouldn't be surge or whatever. Is it just that you bleed a lot? It's like, I mean he really got to see it. It's like we already have to blur one puffed up facade. Yeah. It's so crazy. Like his basically his, you ever seen like a chimps ass? How it's like bubbles. It's like all big and yes. Yes.

Speaker 5:          01:22:04       That happens. Vagina. That happened to him on camera and I saw him turning and when I saw it I was like, I literally, I had never seen anything like this. I saw this swollen sticking out of him like peach bread asshole. And it, it looked like it looked like it wasn't like your real asshole. I been trying to push out a shit for like the last like three, four straight minutes and I thought that's what it was. That shit was halfway out of my book. So I was trying to show you, you saw it like, cause you knew what that was, what it looked like. I thought there was a piece of shit coming out of my butt and I was trying to show you that be the most disgusting me when you saw it on yourself, weren't you a little like, oh my God. Like okay. Yeah. Like it's a little scary, right? It's a little scary to see. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it was like I can search stuff has been there for awhile, but that's that, that didn't feel good to wipe it spine. It's pretty tough. And then it just kind of goes back in. It goes back hand. Yeah. All right.

Speaker 12:         01:23:06       I mean we've already said wow, is it when just got to the one not on Youtube, I think like live leak or something. Okay. Uncensored on censored Juke. Clam. But still, it's still like that, Ari? Yeah. I can show you right now. No, no, no. That's okay. Bubby. Yeah. That's a terrible thing to live. Bleached out. Punch drunk. Ah, I saw that on the, uh, I saw that Sam triple e's. How'd that go? Did it hurt? No, a little warm. A little little heat on it. But, uh, you get to see it before and after shot, like, so you could see I've seen it before or after. It just seemed like the, the parts that he didn't bleed, we're just darker. Didn't look like it was lighter. That's so funny that people are doing that. Is that real? I mean, if you're a porn star, I get it.

Speaker 12:         01:23:49       But otherwise, in civilian life, why would you need to have your ass hole? I mean, once we got into an accident and you badly burned inside your asshole, it's aesthetics, guys down. I'm just like, I'm trying to play it and yeah, but it just says, you know, so I go, hit play. I'm hitting play right now. It's all on video cuts. It's horrific news today. Must be over there. Just won't play. Uh, I wonder if this other one will play. Oh, here's a reddit link to it. Maybe this will play. This is fun. It's our pizza dish. I'm thinking of getting one of those big day. Thanks dude. Uh, Amazon, you don't have to, she don't have to like get in the shower. Did I haven't shit to shower. I only do it in hotels now. Cause there was the well yeah they don't now I feel like a diminished, degraded human when I have to shit on a toilet that doesn't have a bad day. I feel like it's, I feel like trash to use to it.

So now when you do that, then does a stop with a continuous wiping? Yeah, it's good. Cleans it up. Wow. The water is what I need to stop the leaky, but wow. I don't know why my butt leaks. Have you ever before you got that, did you ever wipe say, okay, I think I'm good. Then go out and go, oh, I think I'm, I think I've got to go back to wipe. That's how I've discovered my leaky, but probably, yeah. And then like hours later I'll be like, oh my God, why is there Brown there? These, these summer days by the way, summer. Oh Harry. You know like sometimes I'll be like, ah, and I'll just go sit down with paper to see if there's something there.

Um, one of her oh gee ones was about, um, shitting in and around. Yeah. I can't find it around and that's hard to find. Yeah. We could be looking all day for that. I know, but she had a great one about, um, what she was going to do to, uh, this guy when she, when she was going to shit in his mouth and not around it, but she likes specified where she was getting. Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hit Look, you're only get a hard, if you short on his chest was that, you should talk about that. Like he had a small Dick and that he had a, yeah, that's what I always heard when I was growing or latent.

Speaker 12:         01:32:57       Homosexual. And how was growing up around people who didn't like Hitler? Why you wear the most problem? I think, uh, they were just, uh, not fans of the EU. Yeah. I think that's what he was trying to unite. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. We should do, would you rather with Arie, what'd you rather? Yeah, like the historical one, the big one. Oh, okay. Well there's a couple I got. I just think it'd be fun to play with them. Yeah, sure. Would you rather only Lasagna for the rest of your life? Yeah. Or never have to never be able to eat anything with meat?

Speaker 7:          01:33:30       Nope. One day, one day, one meal a day. How do we live off your life or no meat for the rest of the top layer that goes and checking or toilet paper. The urine. Homeless. There's times by my butt. Sex with your sister. They the face grandmother walks on you masturbating, never have another orgasm. China, China, China. Would you rather

Speaker 12:         01:34:10       I want to hear my options again. It's either Lasagna, one meal a day for the rest of your life. Every day. Every day. You must eat lasagna high. Does that meat and veggies your choice. Your choice. Okay. Um, but you can't eat anything else. You can have like a little piece of Lasagna and like a salad is just as Anya for a meal. One meal a day. Yeah. You have two pieces, three pieces, but for the rest of your life you get other meals. Dinner. Yeah, that could just be lunch. Okay. Um, but you don't get to like have another thing that you have to eat it, it to fill up on it. Okay. That's a, that's a B, the formula or you're a vegetarian but, but you're saying no fish as a vegetarian. Yeah, no fish. So no protein. You basically have to be like a Vu may have eggs.

Speaker 12:         01:34:51       I see. I have to have that protein. I feel, I feel weird when I don't have protein. Yeah. I'm going to have to go with the Lasagna today. Wow. Cause I like Lasagna. Like I feel like I could do that. You don't feel like you'll be betraying Lasagna by eventually hating it? No. Okay. No. What? What do you say, Tommy Jeans? I have to do this right now. Okay. Our area. What do you choose? I didn't really think of what I said to love me. Pedal Saga every day. I know it's tough because you know when you make a Lasagna you end up eating it for three or four days anyway by day four you're just overestimate. So what was the other option besides a Lasagna? Be a vegetarian. No fish. You can only have, oof. I know. Well I think I'd have to do lasagna every single day. What if you just ate a tiny square that allowed?

Speaker 12:         01:35:44       Not Allowed, but here's the thing. The variety provided to you in the other meals, I think would would counter it. Yeah. I feel weak when I don't eat meat. I like meat. Did you go to a dinner party? Like we got Lasagna to the, yeah. You would kill someone? Yeah. Wait, what would you choose? I think I'd be a vegetarian. I think I would get real sick of Lasagna and I'd start to go crazy. That's true, but what could it, could you have different Lasagna is like with the best Sharm El Sauce one day or does it have to be the standard tomato Warfield pictured it was the same exact recipe. Lasagna. Like when you say you make a thing of Lasagna of keep eating it. I imagine like a 50 mile long one. It's always lasagna fresh or heat it up. That's the only variety your got. I put shaky cheese on it one day the next day. No shaky. I try to vary it. I think I would have to do that just to be, be able to have whatever I want for the second and the third meal. I agree. I agree. Okay. Ready? Oh sorry. Go ahead. This is probably one of our most favorite ways you rathers on the show. Very popular. It would you rather be retarded. Hold on.

Speaker 11:         01:36:55       I'll stop you there. I would love to. I, you're gonna give me another positive or be a millionaire that I don't know, but like I would love the lack of responsibility you must feel would be so worth it. You really need to throw in the towel. I mean, you know who's going to do that chore? Well for sure not me, right? Because I'm retarded, so for sure it's not me. However, you guys can decide who's doing it, but I'm out of this. Can I just go pee corner?

Speaker 12:         01:37:25       Thank you. Have a job like you have to go. How many jobs? I remember that commercial when you were little. Do you remember that? Like, yeah, we played it on the show. What you have to go work at the grocery story and have to bag groceries pushcarts stuff like that. When you get a retarded guy back in your groceries, does part of you feel like I'm part of the solution? I've said this is one of my favorite. I love doing this to people. I did this to my mother. We were at a grocery

Speaker 5:          01:37:56       store and they had a retarded guy bagging the groceries and he wa at this grocery store. They walk you to the car too. So they walk to the car and they load it in and so he did, he did all that. There's no conversation. And then as we're getting in the car turn on long ago, someone was different about that guy. Right? He's retarded. He also doesn't know like PC things to say and she's like, I go, no. She goes, tell me please. And I go, he's fine. But he was like off and he's clearly, and she's just like, just upset. I do that also when I see somebody walking, like, you know, fuck with her, like with them, with my parents, I'll be like, this guy's drunk still. And she'll be like, but they don't like, they don't go, they don't get that. I'm saying that as a jokes.

Speaker 5:          01:38:53       I do it seriously. And then there'll be like, that guy's severely disabled. Like he's, he's fucked up and they're light. And I'm like, oh, he's drunk, but you could sell it. I liked it. Then my friend's like, oh, look at this soccer on the 80 year old man I fucking asshole in to see somebody super hot. Like what Tom does is when he sees a pregnant woman, he'll be like, what's wrong with her stomach? I have a stupid, I posted that on Instagram before and it's almost like that Collin, when thing, we were talking about some people going to be pregnant and I'm like, no dude. I post with Adam West side. I was, I had this contract with our fans. A celebrity dies as soon as possible. I will shit on him as soon as they died. As soon as I hear about it, I will try to come up with a funny tweet shitting on them. Yeah. Not Respecting their death. Yeah. So for Adam West, because I didn't really have any problems at all with Adam West. Yeah. I was like, um, Adam with Fox, my grandmother tore apart my fat and my father's family, I saw that. I saw, I'll never forgive him. I'm Moshe Kasher was like, is that real? You fucking idiot.

Speaker 5:          01:40:00       Tore my family apart. Sorry sir. Would you rather be retarded or let your grandfather jerk you off on a Ferris wheel? But you get, you get a funnel cake to choose the Ferris wheel, a funnel cake. And all he does is he does, he drops you off on, no one finds out and you get an awesome fresh funnel cake. Go ahead. Does a funnel cake come before or after the jerk off on the first one after. So it's like you're done. You're crying. So it doesn't make you feel better. This is our thing. Like don't tell anybody here's a funnel. Yeah. Feel like the experience of having the funnel cake with Papa would be a sort

Speaker 12:         01:40:54       of tainted from the Turk off it is. It is by you. Here's the thing. But if I get the final cake before, it'd be a nice moment with my, with my, with my papa or my Saba. But then afterwards I'd be like nothing to wash down that bad feeling. Yeah. The cyber like a Jew means grandfather. Okay, Bro. Um, it is a tough one. See? Yeah. I can't imagine my Saba growing. I survived the Holocaust for this. We'll fill out would you rather from Christina, but okay. So, but you're either retarded your whole life. Do one bad incident on the Ferris wheel, but there's funnel cake. I approved juice and you got to consider that you might be get way into it and then want to have that happen over and over again. But it's not just a onetime thing. Sure. I don't, I don't jerk off to anime porn for that reason.

Speaker 12:         01:41:45       Why is that? What a five, I don't want to go down that road. Right. You know, and then be like working off the cartoons. It's too dark or road. So what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. I think I would go with my, I mean, is it now or is he still alive? They're both dead, but we're assuming they're still alive. He's alive. Yeah. Yeah. Take it up as core. He's old and he's like, let's go on this. Ferris. Well, this isn't an interesting distinction he's making because if it happens to you in your formative years, in your youth, it could do long lasting damage if it happens. At what age are we talking? You're a child and this happens. Are you an adolescent or are you 40 something year old? Also if you're an adolescent, if you're, if you're 17 you're going to come quick. Sure.

Speaker 12:         01:42:27       But now she's going to be jerking me off for a while. Like the guy running it. Like when you run that back, run that back. We got to go another round on the Ferris wheel. Well that's an interesting with his fucking hands I hope. Does their lube lube or is it just that rough? No, no GRANDPA had rob, rob, rob, rob. Now here's what I'm going to do with this one cause I hadn't considered the age. I don't want to scar you emotionally too much so I'm not going to do it to the, to a child from now on. That's great. 40 something year old. You're an adult and your grandfather is like a couple of years before he dies. His hands are all decrepit and also had 40 years of non retarded life. Go back and become always taught it. So you'll be born retarded like of mice and men in interviews talking about it. So why did you choose through a double special?

Speaker 12:         01:43:27       Interesting. Interesting. They're like, what's going on with you right now? I know the, yeah. Oh well my grandpa live the rest of his life retarded. That'll be crazy. Oh wait, is it not the rest your life? Well, that's what I thought. I had assumed that you'd be born. We'd go back in time and you're born retarded, but you got to make choices, right. It's all right now. So that's why I think it might be funnier if from now. I think it's better though. It's better. So let's do, let's do it from that. From now on. You're retarded from now on you. That'd be hard to cause I've gotten lead and then the amount of game I would not have and your careers destroy it or less. You'd become the retard it a comedian now. My intellect wouldn't be that. All right, the bits, but here's the thing we can start getting, do you start getting sympathy tail?

Speaker 12:         01:44:27       Yeah, for sure. How does it still look the same way people will remember you before you walk into a bar and then they're like, hey, I saw you on Netflix and comedy central. You would get a bunch of women who would like, we're already looked to me it was like whatever, like but not enough. Yellow is my favorite and then they're like, Oh wow, I've had a thing for Atar to people. Yeah. Also he was a funny comic wants this will be good. That's a whole new ones. A your sex game ticket, big dive. You would never think about pleasing somebody else, but you've got to also think I have retard strength. Yeah. So hard to libido. Don't forget they are very sexually, they took off constantly cause they don't know like you're not supposed to do this. Like why would you not so good you guys to try it?

Speaker 12:         01:45:09       Hate mail about that. Really? She said that and some someone wrote in, he's like, I work with in special ed and she's like, they don't all jerk off all day. You fucking, that's because you've done a good job. They were so mad. They were pretty upset. We're going to get some mail on this one to think, but it's so worth the hate mails. Never like, oh just so you know. Some of them do. To that, but generally that's like five, 10%. You're, you're off a little bit, but it's all going fuck you asked. Thanks. We're not teaching. Let me ask you this though. Now you're going to have a decision but go ahead. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Let's just tell us your decision and then tell us why you chose that. Yeah. I think I would go with my grandfather jerking me off. Wow. I just don't want to be retarded man.

Speaker 12:         01:45:56       I just don't want retarded and I fucked some gross people before. This would be way more damaging, but I wasn't that close with, with papa or Saba. How long do you think it would take you to finish what it would take? A while. One time I tried to jerk off in front of two guys in the La Jolla comedy store, the Condo. Um, I try to work it up like real hard in the other room and then come out and like Jews in front of them. Yeah. When I came out and realize how ridiculous it was. It was about to come and then it was like, you got a five more minutes now and I need to go back for an hour. Go for it. At the pressure of performance, it was just like ridiculous and funny. Were they laughing or were they one was laughing. One was in horror. I think I choose the latter. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to go grandfather jerking me off. Wow. It would be rough. It would take a while. It would definitely damage me. Um Oh man, it would definitely, the thing is that it's going to affect the rest of your life would have a definitely a new relationship with my parents. I have trouble looking at them, especially telling them like you have to tell him one day, you don't want your, you know what your dad did to me. This game

Speaker 5:          01:47:05       should really be called would you

Speaker 12:         01:47:07       lease rather? Yeah, of course. Leads us into one of the classic. Would you rather, and I know you're not obviously Christian, but like the biggest a celebratory day in your house would probably be like growing up. Would be the celebration. Oh, you mean like Jewish? Passover is more like a family thing. Hanukkah, Hanukkah. But everyone's together. Passover, Passover, Rosh Hashanah, passover, passover. Yeah. So it's Passover. Everybody gets together. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh my God was really fucking, Nah, you can leave the district. Oh my God, you guys are so disgusting. So

Speaker 5:          01:47:56       if, uh, you guys have your, you know, yeah, you sacrifice your baby, you do your,

Speaker 12:         01:48:02       no, the non Jewish babies died. Right? Okay. So Nikela dog, you guys do your training. You say your prayer, um, you know there's one drop of Jewish, non Jewish baby blood and that Motsa recipe. If that's your furniture, one drop. Don't fuck, it's not a whole baby. We for sure we killed the babies and put them out. But like only one drop is necessary. You're way off base. I don't know all of the

Speaker 5:          01:48:25       things, but you, you do your coin flip. Everyone sits there and then at the end, right. And is there like a big toast and everything too? Okay, so there's all this wine. Then you say to your family, you go guys, I gotta show you something and you, everybody goes from the dining room to the living room. I can already picture that. So everybody's like, oh cool. And they're like, what is it? Did you, did you shoot a new show? What, what are you going to show us? And you go, just sit here and watch this. And you put in a DVD and they're all like waiting in anticipation. And by the way, pastor, do you say happy Passover? Like what are you guys happy wife? Happy pays off. Piss off or could Yontif good. Yontif yeah. Okay. So that's for all holidays. So they're all sitting in front of the TV. You press play, your onscreen and 10 homeless guys are standing around you and they go, hold on, hold on. This is one of the options. Of course.

Speaker 12:         01:49:33       Video of both though. No, no, no, no. It's one or the other. Otherwise it's like continuing and they're getting divorced over it and then it could be late. Okay, so let's say it's homeless, but they're homeless. Homeless, right? Yes. And they all masturbate to completion on you squirting or no? One that, yeah, cause it could be like skirt and they're all like, they're all really loud about it. It's really uncomfortable watching. Yes. Wait, everybody, the last one ends, you turn to camera and you say, uh, how they pay us off. Yeah. Happy pay, stuff like that. And then it cuts to black and you turn back and you're like, what do you guys think? It's either that or when you put the DVD and you press play, it's just you alone looking at the camera and you masturbate to completion and you say happy. Yeah. It's the shame that it's either you doing the thing or having the thing done to you. That's shameful.

Speaker 12:         01:50:41       I mean there's so many different people in the family, so yeah. Well my mom and dad was most disappointed with me versus like I could explain to the nephews if we're always just masturbating. My sisters could be like, okay, you're going to have to learn this eventually. Yeah. What are we was doing was called masturbation. You'll do it when you get a little older. Yeah. Can we take the children out of the room? I think the children don't need to be privy. I'm going to take, I know what needs to be privy. Let's change it to just adults. I don't think it's fair to put kids in that. So I'm picturing me when I was growing up, maybe when I'm like 22 no one has shown us kids yet. Correct. Everyone's grown up. Adults only is what we change it to. Tom Children shouldn't watch the video, but it's your mom is your dad.

Speaker 12:         01:51:23       It's your grandma, grandpa, brother, sister. They've all, there's no children. Okay. Looks fine. It's all adults. Okay. Oh, can I say a problem with us? You can't use a DVD player on so I'm like I got to put this a DVD. Yeah, they'd be like, what are you talking about? Here it is. It's a live performance guys. One of my friends, they're all going to do this with me versus all right guys. And actually the way I got to come to the backyard and they're all waiting there. Or originally the way I, I like this one is to send out a company wide email. Guys come to my desk at 1230 and everyone shows up your boss and then you're like, and then you, that's a good way to masturbate. That's a good way to quit his job. But what would you guys do with grandfather or retarded?

Speaker 12:         01:52:09       I chose no, I'd rather grandfather a hundred percent wow. Yeah. I've, I've lived a great life. I've had all but my son, Shit grandfather, I have to raise my kid but I feel like it would like, now that I think about it and talking about it with you, it would take so long, so long go somewhere like focus so intensely on it. You know, you'd have to block it out. It's like so hard. It's a really big about sexual stuff and if you like at all pop up or if you get that smell Begay and every time he's like, oh throw it. And he's just just, you know, and it wouldn't be good at it. It's not like he's a fucking to lick his hand the way it does.

Speaker 10:         01:52:52       Okay.

Speaker 12:         01:52:53       Yeah. I ended up, if you're like having trouble, he'd be like going into your balls and you're like, yes, yes I do. I need help on my lap like old times. Yeah. You want me to do your balls to your bald man? Bald? My grandpa, I'm on airy. So what's it going to be? A funnel cake? Yeah. So jerk off in front of my family or have 10 girls kind of boot cocky you, I mean originally it was 10 homeless men, but I feel like we adapt it for male. They're really picturing men and women homeless. Okay. And they're being board said it had a whole book. Does it smell? Yeah,

Speaker 10:         01:53:41       that's what it sounds like.

Speaker 15:         01:53:45       Oh my God. This is the front of your face,

Speaker 12:         01:53:59       like in the back yard.

Speaker 15:         01:54:04       I mean just

Speaker 12:         01:54:06       going to watch or be like, Hey, get off now. Just watch their roads with, everyone just says watching it. Just like shock and so you're really thinking about the conversation afterwards? Yeah. Talk us through your thinking. Okay. You're thinking about afterwards how to deal with it. You're also thinking about if no one was there, which one? I'd rather like. I don't want to have homeless people jizzing on me. Like it's not just about the reaction. It's also like this is happening. Right. Interesting point, but can't you masturbate in front of your family? That's another thing. Looking into your mother's eyes, looking at your sister. Right, right, right. Oh yeah. Well I mean like the homeless people [inaudible] on you and squirting on you. That could be, would you rather if the family is not even involved because it's not even a good thing. Yeah, but the family adds a nice leg up for sure.

Speaker 12:         01:54:50       I'm saying it's a bad thing, but masturbation without my family is no big deal without your phone, but we are family. It adds a whole other level. That's why it's such an important. Would you rather, this is a seminal one, if you will. I think I know I'll get, my thinking is I could sort of throw it off to them as like I was forced to do this. I wasn't the one doing it. That's right. Now. That was the law masturbating. That's right though. It's a more normal thing, like obviously you know intellectually that I do this when you're not around. Right. And now the hall, man, I bet it's a shell it that way. It's a shame displacement. It's, it's either the shaming is done to you or you're responsible for your shame, so that's I think why it's psychologically very provocative. As I'm talking it through, I might have just switched. Yeah, I was going to go get, get just done. Right. But I think maybe now mastering, but then I can't, the conversation, they'd be like, no, you

Speaker 5:          01:55:44       were doing that. Are you were masturbating. Why did you do that? It's past. We asked you to stop. But we're saying, hey, please stop. The other way. It's like we asked the homeless people to please stop and they did it. All right. Get away from them, but I'm on the ground. Yeah, and they have, they take the responsibility, right. What's happened? We made him do this. Oh, they forced me. I mean, I lost a boy. This is a really on the line with the goals. When the ever you do it, would you rather not have people go, oh yeah. Hey, it's the dilemma. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:56:19       I, I, I think the getting masturbated on, do you prefer that one before? I don't really like using that word. It's your preference. It's what you find enjoyable. I think that there would be that conversation of like, all right, he masturbated. Why don't you that in front of us? But this is like, to what are you into? That's all. That's what is, was become ours of our sun. So That's interesting. The shame of what are your sexual preferences? Are you into, this is what our he's into versus we don't know what our he's into, but he's masturbating in front of us and that's in your masturbated in their house while they were there when I was an orthodox Jew. Right. Where you're supposed to not do that. Oh for sure not. It wasn't, there was no religion in the world that I know of except, no.

Speaker 5:          01:57:04       Even that that does, that allows it. Will you ever bring stuff like that up in that era? Would you be like, I want to masturbate or would they talk to you about stuff like that? No, no, no. Even sex ed was having or core or your folks Orthodox Jewish. They are, they have gotten to the point where if we're out and my dad's like, if you want to get a burger, you can get a burger. Oh really? But that like took a lot. How, how are they with your success? Like I like my success. They don't like the way I've achieved it. Uh, like when I took my dick out on, on HBO, my mom's like, why do you have to tell? I told people to watch we're going to be on TV. Why? And I'm like, mom, you shouldn't watch this stuff. It's, it's exactly not for you.

Speaker 5:          01:57:40       Well, they watch the special. Oh yeah, they will. Yeah. Geez. I got comedy central before they got cable just so they could watch me. Really? Yeah, they're proud of me. I asked my aunt once, I was doing some joke about like herpes at the DC Improv and they were there and then they left right afterwards when I was like, what did they, how did they feel about that? She goes, I think they just assumed you were joking about like the setup and this payoff. Oh, that it's all made up. Yeah. That's good. I'm joking about having it though. Not having it a fucking, excuse me. Making love to a woman. Sorry Christina. I love to a woman who had herpes. Oh. And they were like, oh, there's just like, it's amazing how many people like, well, they're like, and so you just made that whole thing up, right?

Speaker 5:          01:58:16       No, I just chose the funniest way to say it. The amazing one to me is when the, when people think you made up like a, a super detailed story, like a story that people give their like, so you may, like I had a story about meeting Mike Tyson and they were like, you made all that up. He just made that up. We really created if he could do that. I mean, you kind of want to be like, yeah, I think I'm creative, but like you think I'm mean, I made up all the beats of like converse. Like why

Speaker 12:         01:58:42       would I make that? Yeah. But I guess if they, if you don't do it, then you just assume now don't let them see behind the curtain. And guys, come on. I know, but it's just weird that like that a plant you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Now does your mom do that thing where she, when she gets her period, she goes to the water. The Jacuzzi? Yeah. I like that a lot. My mom hasn't gotten her period since before Obama for sure. Probably back in the day. 40 almost of natural water. Uh, that's an a measurement of natural water you need. Okay. After you have your period, you need seven clean days. So no spotting. No nothing. Count to like popcorn when it pops and you're like three seconds, you go want to pop. Okay, start again. One, two, three Oh one, two. You know what? So you've got seven clean days.

Speaker 12:         01:59:31       No spotting everything he got. Spot starts over. When you get seven clean days, then yeah, go to the Mikvah ritual bath. You could also use a lake or ocean because it's got plenty of water in their natural water, but not like a pool. It's got to be like a natural, it's gotta be rainwater coming up. I always think about whenever I hear these things like that, it's crazy, right? No, just the amount of effort, just effort. I guess we're all, well, let me tell you this. In terms of like what you said, like a practicality. Yeah. So period, let's say three, five days, but they had spotting dead seven clean days. Now Your Day 12 then the next day you go to the Mikvah 13 and now you're, you haven't fucked your husband in 1314 days tenure and you're at your most fertile. Yeah, it's great. It's actually a way of making sure and also keeps you like, yeah.

Speaker 12:         02:00:18       I think also like just relationship wise you go, he's got no road. So it's like when you're apart from each other, when you come back you're like, oh, I can't wait to see you again. Yeah, it's true. Versus you've seen a lot of couples. You should. I do. I liked what the Jews do. Good Shit. Yeah. But what are you Orthodox Jew symbolically anymore? Like did you do anything masturbate in front of your family? Some of the foods, I still get off on that because I grew up with it. But if I'm home I'll sing their songs with them. You know, that just sounds really at this point. But do they, is everybody, here's the other thing, how, how are they as far as they have, they accepted your zip up. My Dad wants in a while, says he's from coming to shoulder mild, you know, come with and I was like, no, I feel bad.

Speaker 12:         02:00:59       Last time I went home. So you would say the grace after meals? Um, there's this, if you have three or more men above 13 as an extra prayer say, and one person says that everyone like joins in. So you say like it's in Hebrew, but you say like bless it other for giving us food and then it was like, yeah, for real though. And then he's like, thanks for all these people here. I was like two totally. Yeah, it's just a back and forth a little bit. Yeah. My Dad is like, you want to, you want to lead this one? And I was like, oh no, I don't, I don't remember this. And he's like, no, you read another book. And I was like, oh my mom's like, we do it. And I'm like, ah, ah. But then as soon as they did and I was like, what the fuck is wrong with me? Yeah, just not converting. If I could have done it, if I was at a Buddhist thing and they said, can you read this thing? I would have done it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       So it's like Beth because it's family and children, but I mean like, I feel bad about it. Yeah, I understand. What, back to the fucking question at hand. Yeah. It hasn't chosen. Sorry. It's so hard. Just think, no, I don't. I've never had somebody. It's the before and it's a door it and it's the afternoon, the afternoon, the drawing explaining to them, it's like, of course they master it. It's like, why don't you do that already? Why is masturbation so, so taboo? Yes, it is. For you. Your House, it's not a normal thing. It's not a natural occurrence. Meaning that's the double thing of you having Orthodox parents is that that's off the table. Discussion wise, why trust. Parents were like, why are you doing that outside?

Speaker 3:          02:02:26       Right. What's your choice? What is it? I think it's the homeless people. Yeah. Yeah. No, I think I chose, the other one I show is doing it myself. He's got good parents. I could tell them afterwards, the halls, people like I wasn't into that. Right, right, right, right. No, I understood. I mean I, I, I got it. I just, I, so I rejected all the other column. I displaced the shame. I prefer to put the shame on the other people. What if want to be to them. This is the, Oh gee, would you rather, wow. It's great when you come across a good one. You're like, I gotta remember this for next time. Oh this one is like from, yeah, this is like a six or seven year old one. Yeah. I have one for you. For me. You could do this to Eric. Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:03:15       Tommy, would you rather, would you rather have your mouth smell like fiefs FIFA, Theo or dog? Her blind dog smells like food. Is it the other one I look at you. Oh you don't want him to like it. The halibut fucking, it's horrible. Yeah. Okay. So would you have either your mouth smells like feet or my mouth smells like fiefs yours. Why? What? Really? Yeah, but then you have to live with me and I have a, I'll have a garbage mouth. Yeah, I know you just have you. I just kiss other parts, you know, just ruined her. Her feelings. The woman you love like this will be easier for you. Right? But easier for me to have your dog. You don't have to smell his horrible. Now how bad smelling mouth anyways, cause Dad's get dad mouth. You're going to have dad mouth and like when you're 50 right?

Speaker 3:          02:04:09       Don't dad's mouth smell like shit. Like older guys smells like the deodorant they were putting on and they, and they look like, like older guys mouth looked like they were just decomposing. Like you look at your mouth, you're like, you look like a fucking, it's like a corpse already. See, I feel like it'd be, I'd be like, get it anyway. I think we would get to the point, I'd be like, you know how your mouth is. So you would be like, Hey, can I get a kiss? I'd be like, Hey, your cheek. You know, like kiss you over there smells horrendous.

Speaker 12:         02:04:38       You wouldn't be able to sleep next to me. Like I couldn't sleep with my head next year. Head on the pillow, bedrooms. I would just know. I'd just be like face the other way, you know? You know, you know you face your wall. Yeah. I would have used smell like fiefs. I would have the mask. Yeah. Yeah. The other person has it fucking day of my life. I want your life. I would be talking to people and you could, I mean if they had like my dogs, if I had my dog's breath, I know people would be like, oof Jesus man. You want a mint? Normally strong enough. You wouldn't be able to do anything.

Speaker 12:         02:05:13       I have a serious one for you guys. Serious was wrong. Would you rather never do stand up ever again or split up? Oh God, God. Cause I mean I put a lot of people don't know comedians. This is who we are at the core. So like split up but just did divorce. But we can still see each other like split up meaning or you're done. You're nice to each other. They'd be fuck once a year. Yeah, we split the custody. How's things going with you? Like when you drop them off, the kids fine. Sees both the parents. You guys are both amicable. I mean that would suck, but I'd have to, I want our family be together. I don't want my kid to grow up the way I did is terrible. It's fine. It's fine. It doesn't seem that bad. It's not good. Split up.

Speaker 12:         02:06:07       But why? Well, here's the thing, you make, you make a good living doing stand up. You would really have to find another, I mean the podcast is great too, but that would really ruin your livelihood and our livelihood jewelry. You know what I'm saying? We are split up a white diamonds. Of course. I got it for yesterday. Really Birthday. I didn't know when your birthday was coming. No one cares about in February. Where do you want to go on this trip? Oh yeah. Oh yeah, I bet the bet. Yeah, I heard you guys talking about your trip. Well I pes thank, thank you is mine. I bought it. It's hers now. Beautiful. There's tasting. Julie's amazing washed up. Fuck man. So I talked to Bart Crysler and the the the re obese. Yeah. Bark Chrysler. Yeah. So what is your opinion on his weight gain? Has His uh, man, I don't know. I was trying to spin the cause even when he took his shirt off for that thing and wait himself as not obese, he still looks obese as fuck. You mean at the actual way? January 3rd I guess that's what it was. That you saw him, you saw him with me a few days ago. What'd you think? He looked like? He looked, boy, he didn't look like a fucking workout guy. Right. But he said he definitely cut

Speaker 5:          02:07:35       weight for the way in. Right. Well we both call water worse, but like there's, you put the water back on and it's barely, it's nice. His face doesn't look much different than he did way before. His belly is just so gross. And like we were talking, we saw on the back it's pushed out where it's a hard, if he lost weight, you should have that fold that fold over. Yeah. Thing a little bit. A little bit. Right. Do you feel like, cause he was saying, I mean I'd like to get them back on a scale. Maybe I will during a, is it going a skank fest? I don't know where he's going. He's, he's on the road a lot. Um, if you, if you were to describe a, he said that, uh, he was really upset that people were saying he gained the weight back. Yeah. Well, he's, no, what he's upset about is that he came in the white pack. Right. I Dunno. Maybe. And I was like, well, you know, he goes, I have no, here's what he said.

Speaker 5:          02:08:32       Yeah, it's a lot. And I go, dude. And he goes, I heard you say you did tell me there was like just fucking Tom who's starting up again. That'll get the book. Yeah. And people have been tweeting him. Really? Yeah. Like why did you get fat again? Let's get him on a scale again. Yeah. Um, but I don't know, you saw him, at least for our audience, for me to tell the difference between two 20 and two 40. Yeah. You know, he's a tall guy. You would understand that. But he's a tall guy. He's over six feet tall, well over six feet tall. Well over six one you know, well into the six six feats. I think he's just under six one. Ah, you're just under six feet. But he's well over six feet. That's a liar. I can't believe. I can't believe after asking for the fucking measurement when you were well over an inch short of, and you said you're worth, there was no, I said I was six feet. You said you were six one I didn't say six one one one. He said he was 61 which turned out to be also not true. Yes. So then they had to do new BMS. Yes. But you guys both may have made it anyway, but that being said, he is fat ago. Sorry. He's obese again. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:09:43       Don't know. Don't know. Just look at him. I mean he's not doing anything that he's supposed to be doing to lose the weight, but he managed to before, I don't know how he did it before. It talks to people who only cram for tests and still manage to get A's. Yeah. This isn't the way it's gonna work, but he does. His version is, it's the Mickey Mantle Gene. Mickey Mantle on. Yeah. That was really funny about that bat was the phrasing of it, where you go, what was it? It was just cute out of obesity. Just get out of it. That's all you have to do. Just don't be OPB overweight. The overweight, just don't be a medically obese. And by the way, the lack, the lack of faith in either of us was also hilarious because he was like, only one or you can do it. I don't think your book do it in a way. Yeah. It's like if you really did have a good workout, I was like, yeah, for sure. But I didn't think either one of them. Can I ask you one thing? It's so dumb

Speaker 13:         02:10:34       and it's like such a minor dumb question, but I've been thinking about it. There is a time during their weigh ins were Joe called you and you were abroad and he kept calling you and calling you. And like

Speaker 5:          02:10:44       I was a, I was out with Comedians in New York. We're out eating trust Korea. I was, I left the next day.

Speaker 13:         02:10:50       Why did you not just answer the phone like you kept answering and then you'd hang up?

Speaker 5:          02:10:55       Oh, it's because of this, because I have this new feature on my phone that it just a, if I moved slightly, it'll just answering my pocket. Oh Wow.

Speaker 13:         02:11:04       This whole time I'm like, why would I do that? I can understand why you would do that to somebody.

Speaker 5:          02:11:08       Yeah. It was a day before I left was the first way. And, and I, and I waited till I guess midway through that second podcast. That's why I left. So weird. Yeah. That's all it was. And then when I finally saw it was like, oh, what? I was kinda drunk with the guys. Okay. And uh, I'm like, what a jerk. Why don't you just pick up the phone? And that was hitting me with it too. It's like, let me show you the way ads. Here's what number. I was like, wait, wait, I don't, I need to know what the BMS like what are they have to beat down. Slow down. You got word that that we were basically whatever add it or near it. What you like. Fuck. Like did you feel a little bit also fun but also like I'm all about competition. Yeah. So I'm like, I want the exact measurement.

Speaker 5:          02:11:40       Yeah, you're just like the easily did it. I'm like man, cause slow down. Slow down. Yeah, we do have the have you. You got it. Bye Bye. The way after your new weight, your new height of five something unbelievable. Unbelievable. This guy. Yeah. You were 0.15 of an inch above obese. If you were 0.1 5.15, if you were, if you were five 11.7 instead of five 11.85, you would be about obese. Yes. So for the next day it's like, hey man, if he gains, I'll pound back. Yeah, I win the bet. So I'm so I'll say like, let me see the fucking competition. Oh my goodness. I have never strict on a goddamn single bedroom, my life. So what are we going to do though? What should we do? Let's do something. Uh, August the iron man I'm through. I have a pretty good busy fall. That's my whole, let me ask you a question, but what about in November?

Speaker 5:          02:12:31       Me, n n Burt will be in New Orleans to go on that joker's crews we'll be launching from there. Yeah. So maybe something is November football season. I'll say it again. What do you like be fun? Um, nobody really, you know what would be right. We have to put it off obviously a little bit. Yeah. Would be in probably end of January. Yeah. I don't even know where it is. I look it up. Yeah. Uh, the national championship game, that'd be fun to go to basketball. No, wait, what'd we call it? Football. College football. Yeah. That'd be good if you're a huge college football fan. Yeah. Okay. That'd be fine. It's always on a Monday and the Oh, right. That's great. Yeah. Okay. Let's do it. We could do that. Was your team at Fsu, they have no chance next year or they do, no, I mean a, there'd be there, they're going to be a pre season top 10.

Speaker 5:          02:13:16       Yeah. So there's a chance. Yeah, there's a chance, but either way, be quiet. They also opened the season against Alabama. That'd be their show. They'll get there. They'll get a pretty good, uh, the jump up if they win that and they still have it. Oh yeah. When that, yeah. They'll, that'd be the talk station. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah, that'd be good. I didn't, I liked the idea of going to a, to um, Barcelona, I'll be honest to you. That was rooted in truth. I also knew how, how retarded it kind of went off. But then when it was like, actually like when we were like, Hey, let's do it. I was like that'll be super fun. Super Fun. Yeah. I'll stay in like a big like an airbnb together. I thought that'd be fine or folly cause they were playing the end of the games ended up being like crazy good game.

Speaker 5:          02:13:57       Oh really? One of the, uh, one of them was I think one of them, well there was a big shocker cause I guess they have, they had multiple, you know. Yeah. Yeah. So there was one big upset or um, I think Paris beat Barcelona but no one was expecting on the first one. And I think there's a game after that were Barcelona went messy play for Barcelona you guys. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah that would have been fun. It would have been fun man. But anyways, by the way, I had my plan set up cause you're like, oh I fly first class and I'm like, you know what, it is your flight. That's fine. And I was already had a set like you're flying first class and Bert and I are in the back by the way. I know they would have harassed me the entire flight bird. Oh yeah. He would have been like to be told you can't be up here. And he would have been so upset to be in coach. So upset plus the middle seat. I was going to get him. Oh God. It's the worst. Yeah we have to do, we'll have to do some national championship game would be pretty, we look it up just saying. Yeah. Let me see where it's got a lovely, okay. Is that soccer? Yeah. Jesus Christ. Fucking now definitely split up.

Speaker 5:          02:15:07       That would be a cool one for sure. And then I could finally stop getting comments on all my fucking, everything I post, I call me a Welsh. Yeah, it's an upcoming game. It will be played in Atlanta. Atlanta. Yup. January 8th hey, can we go to the vortex and get that peanut butter Banana Burger? Absolutely. Annotate a new stadium. A new state of the art. I'm really billion dollar stadium. Yeah. Fuck yeah. That can be fun. Okay. What is it? January 31st January 8th January 8th yeah. Is it cold? That seems way early. No, no, no, that's right. They do the New Year's eve stuff in Atlanta. It gets, it gets cold but not that cold. It'll be fine to go to, well, it's very jackets. Do you want to go want to do that? Yeah, that could be a thing. Yeah. Let's do it. I'll, I'll, I'll not scheduling anything ahead of time now. All right. We'll probably go for like the weekend. You got to go for a couple of days. Yeah. You don't want to just land and go to the national championship game, but yeah, we'll go for this. Even go Sunday and then stay Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday something. Yeah. Oh, too bad it's there. Cause we could be like go fishing or whatever. We can figure it out so much. Okay. Hell yeah, that'd be great. Okay. I hope I kill myself before that so I don't have to actually pay it off.

Speaker 5:          02:16:21       So, uh, I might have to get two seats for Bert if he keeps going at this rate. That's totally true. So enormous. I wonder if it's just that, you know, we always see him shirtless. We never see him. That was my theory, by the way, when those, true, when he told me, he goes, when he said like everyone's saying, I gained all this weight back. I go, dude, every place you go you don't have a shirt on. Yeah. Most people not even like forget obese, like the average person shirtless. It isn't like, wow, you look great. You know, what can I tell you what, maybe a retort to that? Yeah. I took my shirt off constantly around Manhattan or anywhere that's shorts off for sure. Suns out, guns out, you know? Yeah. And uh, when I had my shirt off, especially after I got back, people are like, Oh man, you're so thin, Andrew.

Speaker 5:          02:17:05       Lose weight. Right. And with him, they're signs. Did you gain weight? It's just cause the baseline product isn't good. Right, right, right. How right. So like no, same way as before, but I will say this, I will say this, if I walked around all the time shirtless. Yeah. It's not going to be compliments men. No, it's not going to be like, yeah, no one's going to, but like most people have the sense minus him. Wonder how much that weighs. I want to, I want to get a scale. What do you, what would your guess be if you had to guess? Right now? I don't know. Two 93 95 I don't think it's three she's like, is that's gotta be off by like 10 pounds. I don't know, man. It's gotta be like two 78 to 84 real. Even if, forget the way back. He's not above two 40 yeah, but yeah, I think to 20 yeah, no to 22 and you add two to 19 the well, the, the final day I was two 16 and he was two 20 I think.

Speaker 5:          02:18:04       Yeah. Yeah. I would have loved if I want to hop back and it the BMI and rugged and have to go, oh fuck the boost and boost seven grants per calorie. That's really hard to lose weight and drink. Whenever I see a woman, especially in the comedy scene and suddenly it's like when I'm seeing them in six months and it's like, hey you look great. Like what has been doing, it's 90% of the time stopped drinking. Absolutely. That's the one thing you can't, you can't do both man. You can't lose weight. I was gaining weight when I was traveling for the first month and I was like, am I getting [inaudible] this isn't making sense. I mean you're like no processed foods. I'm active as fuck. Yeah. And then my friend was like Chang wait drinking beers like 20 ounces for like a dollar. Everyone is a psycho though where he will go like you know if you, if you go on his Instagram it's like every night he's like 40 people and then the next day he goes and he runs. He does. Yeah. Oh, so Hayden, the gates, the damage, he does that self regulating thing where he's like, recall the four in the morning and you're running all over five miles. We, you crazy. You can't emphasize your liver though. Yeah. No Sim two years from now. God, he was so great. Yeah. Was a good guy. It's kind of at least she have a living memorial for him living funeral. He goes, thanks. So we can really

Speaker 12:         02:19:27       feel his friends come out. Yeah, we should have, we should do that before his heart attack. What? It's like how to live in more than in Atlanta, but book them for a show. You want to do this show and then when he shows up, just have like the big photo on that. You know what I mean? Yeah. The flowers underneath it. Yeah. Oh, that would be great. And have people just to have say some words, music playing. Yeah. It's the intervention. Is that it? Yeah, he'd be, he'd be like, you know, this is a real fucking bummer. He'd be so upset for us to map. It's too real though. It's too close. Yeah. Reality. Um, did you ever have like a horrible office corporate job? Yeah. Yeah. It's up to the health network. Do you guys ever do like cool from stuff getting to know each other?
