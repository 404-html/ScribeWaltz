I don't like Bob Dylan either, just cause it doesn't make it in the bag and Lizanne and I'm like, I just don't really, I just don't understand pretending to think it's good. I mean, the very first time I heard I was like, this is dog shit. Who is this? I was Bob yelling at this is what people talk about. Yeah. This guy is who celebrated. I'll tell you though, there's people listening right now that their heads are exploding because they absolutely, they love these people. They don't know what the fuck's going on. Who Was it? Hello? Frank Sinatra. Yeah. We hate, I don't hate him. As much as I hate the hate him, I just don't

Speaker 3:          00:06:04       pretend that it's like a real singing

Speaker 1:          00:06:08       that's not singing. It's singing songs. Yeah. He's just been a lucky guy. Be So lucky. That's shocking. Fog Up. Sing talking. Yeah. Yeah. It's that. Hey. Ooh. By my luckiest guy on the block prep pap pap. I'm like, okay. I know we've talked to him about this. There's a lot of stuff that people like that I hate most. Most current music. I don't understand it. A lot of it's done shit. Fucking get it. Every time we're in the, in the country club and they're pumping some shit through the, I'm like, what is it? Is this, I will say that I like,

Speaker 3:          00:06:43       um, new discoveries when they're good, like anybody would, right. It's like somebody says, try this food and you're like, Whoa, what the fuck is it? Like, so music wise, you know, like I, I got into Thundercat over the weekend. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:53       Play that for me. And I was like, this feels like Stevie wonder. It feels, it feels familiar, but to me it's a new discovery. I was really excited about it. You like daft punk lately.

Speaker 3:          00:07:04       I like that new, uh, Pusha t album a Daytona, which I'm, I mean I knew, I obviously knew who he was, but I'm saying it's like when something new comes out that you can get excited behind. I really much, I mean, Kanye made the beets and it just, it further prove my point when everyone was accusing him of like whatever. He might be going nuts or whatever. I was like, yeah, but they won't care if he makes drops that heat on the gun. Yeah. And those, uh, those

Speaker 1:          00:07:31       saying, oh, I like Cardi B. There you go. Um, she and I shared today. Thank you guys by the way, for tweeting her. Yeah. A lot of sweets and that is exactly what we want it to bombard Cardi B with tweets about, oh my God, you set up the pregnancy with Christina and she on Instagram posted a video. She's like, I just got to thank my baby for giving me this luscious hair and these big boobs. You know what I'm saying? Like she's, she really is all about it right now. And I agree. She and I are, you know, pregnancy besties, yes. For pregnancy. Betsey's yeah. I like, I love my hair to, my hair doesn't get that good. But anyway, it's interesting. She and I share a due date. It's very, we're going to have a, I mean a little different. She might do water births together.

Speaker 1:          00:08:13       She's going to fly out here. She might do a actually announced that gender. We're going a little different route. You know, what's Your Pronoun? You don't and believe on an inflicting that kind of thing. It's for them to decide. Yeah. Our, our nursery is totally gender neutral. [inaudible] yellows, Greens, orange. I don't believe in specific toys either. I also believe in asking every day. Yeah, let's do like today. What are you today? Especially starting around six months old, I asked for consent when I change their diaper. Always asked for consent. When you change a diaper feed, you know, pick them up, bathed them and then, cause that works, right. We're asking, we have experiences with, with one so far and they, they're really good at signaling when they want to do things that are for there or the word yes. We hear the word yes a lot from a toddler. Yeah. Yeah. It's one of their first word. Yes. I'm thinking about it. Maybe. Let me consider the options. They're very rational, you know creatures. Sure. So, um, well that's one of the reasons I don't have baby showers. I don't believe in having that binary structure. Yeah. On gender mix. Lots of people giving me gender specific things. Um, I will say it is rare

Speaker 3:          00:09:27       but always a treat when full. First of all, when to like for instance when a couple of weeks ago when um, the female listeners sent in there try it out videos, which is a really a spectacular treat. And then now when we get a video like this where it's a woman saying she wants the sex, cause there's, I'll, I'll let you know a little secret. There's no shortage of men out there who make requests like this, but when it's a lady, it's a very special thing.

Speaker 1:          00:09:55       Well it's a role reversal where generally not that, um, forward about our sexual needs and desires

Speaker 3:          00:10:01       forward is, is a understatement for this. I think.

Speaker 4:          00:10:05       Yeah. I want to get fucked meal. Okay. I should be able to get fucked when I want to get fucked. She's running. I worked so fucking hard and I never got no fuckin time to get no fucking Dick. Like this shit is.

Speaker 1:          00:10:17       Yeah. Well, she does have a point. Look, she's a very attractive woman. She works. I feel like women, it's easier for us to get lazy. She should be able to walk with her prop. Why didn't she should be able to walk into like a park and go, who wants to fuck? And then a guy that I think maybe she has

Speaker 3:          00:10:31       like a like is the problem that she's going after.

Speaker 1:          00:10:34       Sure. Unattainable men are like, no, you can't not get sex. She's going after losers. That's the problem. Losers. But she's not even getting it from losers. It doesn't, it. She's getting it from scumbags. My, my thinking is she's attracting the wrong kinds,

Speaker 4:          00:10:49       but she's saying, Fuck Neil. Okay. I should be able to get fucked when I want to get fucked.

Speaker 1:          00:10:53       Did she say she can't get it? Period? I don't know what's happening. I mean, is she going to the right places? Are you going to bars? I don't know. Are Willing to go to la. I deserve

Speaker 4:          00:11:03       to be getting my face fucked right near your face and my dope. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Suffocate me. Talking dot. You can go to fuck tablet and fuck who I want to fuck up there too.

Speaker 1:          00:11:14       Mm hmm. She might have some new doctor drew. Yeah. Fuck me lady.

Speaker 3:          00:11:25       Yeah. By the way, I always, uh, as always a huge thing. So Dr drew. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:30       I loved it. We love it. Yeah. I mean when he's here he thinks I'm, I'm being a little, is it sadistic one? Yeah, he was, I was really happy cause he was getting on you more than me. This, yeah. He, he really, he thinks that I'm laughing at his uncomfortability and upon further specular, uh, analysis analysis. I think some of it's that, but I think some of it is also the of having somebody so over qualify like a legit doctor. He's also been, you know, 40 years treating people with a DA, like he's really overqualified and having him watch are ridiculous videos of course, is such a joy for me and I get giddy knowing that we're asking him to analyze these ridiculous videos. It's just, it's my most favorite thing. There's one or two things going on here. This is either a smart lady who realizes the comedy and doing this and she's doing it because she knows it will get tons of views or it's a very mentally unstable person.

Speaker 1:          00:12:29       She should give out her address like the guide does and try it out. Guy, she would get lots of responses. You got to get up. You got to give back to her address or your phone number if she wants to respond. Let's see, cause that's your so far. I mean, see, here's my point. Like there's no way this lady can't get someone to, she's cute was Ding Dong in her throat. Yeah, that's easy peasy. Request that be a challenge. You know? She's like, no one will do it. Bullshit. You'd do it, but do it right now. If she was in the other room, I just walk in there and do it and be like, is this what you needed? It's, and it's a silly thing. That can't be true.

Speaker 4:          00:13:02       I can't do this no more. I need some fucking Dick like this. I can't live like this. Like what the fuck? I got some good at Olympian Olympian.

Speaker 1:          00:13:13       Hmm.

Speaker 4:          00:13:15       Yeah. Worldstar clips. Okay. There it is. That's the reason.

Speaker 1:          00:13:30       Oh man, she's an angel. I don't understand what, well, the, the, the overt crazy as a deterrent. Yeah, it might be the problem, but it's still, I would still go in there at least for one. One not cause she, you know, she's going to blow up your phone. There's going to be multiple texts. There's going to be followup call. She might find your fucking home and stock. You went, this bitch is too crazy. That's the problem. You go to her place to give her a fake number. I mean 35,000 texts girl 65. Oh Shit. Don't just leave 30,000 on the table. That's the problem.

Speaker 4:          00:14:08       That's too bad. Put It on my throat and he ain't going to fuck me from the bag. Love this girl. You love it. All that stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:14:19       You joke about. You love her. She's great. This is your second wife. This could be, it should be good influence. Great mom. Yeah. That's all I'm thinking about. Yeah. Now, speaking of love affairs, particularly yours and mine, um, yesterday you came downstairs. She had been fighting this cold, getting over it and in the morning we have some coffee before we pick up LJ from the crib and you were hawking and bringing up your phlegm in the kitchen as we were talking and drinking and I look over and I'm like, Eh, it's okay. All right. I held my tongue and then you got up.

Speaker 1:          00:15:05       I didn't when I did, when I saw you hawking a loogie into our kitchen sink, sink the bar. It's somewhere that we wash our hands, we wash glasses. The kid plays in like not really an ideal place for hogging like a sick loogie and I called it to your attention. I was like, do you think you could make me not do that in the kitchen and do that in the bathroom? And I swear it. The look on your face was like, what? Like you were indignant like righteous indignation. Like I can't believe this bitch is telling me I can't hock a loogie in my kitchen saying it was, it was, yeah, it was. It was, you know, it was kind of annoying. It's annoying. Especially because at that bathroom was like five whole steps from where you cock the five steps. I mean, here's the thing, you know, when you're, when you're getting through, fighting through and getting out of a, uh, sick a bronchial thing, worst time is definitely the morning for cleaning it because what happens is you sit there, I know.

Speaker 1:          00:16:15       And that stuff just drips all night. So you wake up and it's just, uh, it's like you're coming, you really come in through some, some dog shit. So you know, the first thing is you take your morning pice. I now know no line now with you, it's a medley of sound. I know, you know, it's interesting cause I know what you're doing in the next room just based on sounds. The other day I was like, oh are you scratching your nuts? And you're like, how'd you know? I'm like, cause I can hear it. I know the, I know what each one means. Like a deeper, that's about scratch. A lighter sounds, the front scratch. So when you get up to pee and there's multiple farts, that's a morning pee. Generally not at night. It's a specifically a morning. Sure. So when I got down there, I was ready to drink my coffee, but then I just kind of took a deep breath. I was like, oh, there's some stuff to bring it up. Then I brought it up in the kitchen. I wasn't really thinking, you know? No, I know. I know you weren't fun part I then, I know before that you had a paper towel that you would like, like a dirty paper towel you'd found on the kitchen table and then that one you were spitting into. Oh, I forgot. I block that one out. I almost vomited.

Speaker 1:          00:17:32       I almost vomited and I thought surely he can't take this further. And that's when you got up and you, while they were jumping over the fact that when my first got up I was like, I got a pretty big boner right now. Right. Which is kind of normal for you. But then your choice of like courting me and getting me on board with the, yeah. Was the Hawk and horrific and make these sounds and be disgusting. So like in your mind you're like, oh I got this bone or I love my wife to help me out with it. Like, and then every flower blooms differently. Yeah. Yeah. Color. I got this boner.

Speaker 1:          00:18:14       So gross. I like how you're like, why don't you give me blow jobs? I'm like, mom, you know, seven a half months pregnant. I just barfing to my own mouth all day, which I'm fine with. It's really not what I want to do that no, but I mean I don't, I wouldn't let it, I wouldn't be bothered by it. I would just have constant heartburn. My bad. Yeah. Anyways, that was our sexy life yesterday. Then we watched a sexy movie. Yeah. Molly would avoiding this movie. I know. I don't know why. I think it's just, I'm not a fan of the, uh, the artwork. I might have found a trailer. Yeah. Movies much better than the artwork or the trailer. Well the artwork, you know why you don't like it? Cause it looks like it's marketed to women because they use a pink font, I think.

Speaker 1:          00:18:58       And so I'm sure guys are like, I don't want to watch some chick movie. And it's not really a chick movie at all. Check movie. She's a woman who is doing extraordinary things and it's interesting. But yeah, they didn't market it correctly. It's Jessica's to chest day in and she plays, um, Molly bloom who was an Olympic skier and then ended up running poker games like exclusive poker games in Los Angeles and later in New York too. Dark titties. Yeah. And uh, anyways, it's a great, it's a really cool story. It's, it's really well done movie about gambling, but it's more about her tests. Well, her tits were spectacular. They were out the entire movie tire. There wasn't, there was one scene where they covered the up and I thought this, I wonder why they're covering it. I'm up now just to kind of, it's the kind of movie and the kind of tickets where you're wondering why there isn't a more in depth conversation about her kids in the movie because he does bring it up once her attorney is like, you may want to dress down for court.

Speaker 1:          00:19:57       Like that's right. I thought he was going to be like, that judge is going to ask the suck on her tits or something. And I have to say as a, as a cisgendered woman, heterosexual, I didn't, I normally don't. I'm not fascinated by tits. The whole, I was like enraptured looking at it only that you, um, right away started the conversation. You Go, do you think they're real? And my immediate feedback was 100%. I think they're real now. See, let's talk about this because she's very petite. She's very tiny. She was very clear to have such big cans on such a small body. I could tell that there was a lot of help in, in uh, giving out that type of cleavage. Other words, there was a supportive bra and tight, close up top pressing those two photographs of people watching can see what you're talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:20:43       She's, first of all, she's very beautiful. She's very made up in this film. I think every single scene. She's got full hair. Full makeup. Yeah. At a certain point. Yeah. She's super, super made up and every dress is like a titty showcase stress. Yeah. Even court. She's wearing like a titty. You can see there's her tits there. Her tits are there. See I do think they're real action real. I think the real, they have a natural, they have a natural drop to them. Yeah. And then they're just exposed more. And this bra is lifting them up and pushing them together. Which giving this, uh, you know the cleavage, which is really nice. The thing I will tell you, a big fan of her droop. Here's how you can tell by the way is the real good girl right here where the real girl and she's got big tits to yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:31       So the thing is she looks like she definitely is down. She's real pretty too. She's just the real girl is prettier than Jessica Chasteen I aren't there. See now here's is interesting is that that looks like a faker. Faker. Here's how you can tell if tits are real. If when you put them in at raw, they mashed together. Okay. That, that like fat lady cleavage where the tits are real tits mushed together cause it's squishy. Fakers separate. They're, they're a part, there's a big cavern between the two now. It could, it could just be her bra. Yeah. See I can't tell cause there was there it wasn't like real hangers. Yeah. Yeah. But then sometimes they look fake cause she's so petite. This is all the movie stuff. This is her at um, a premier right here and they look well. Is there any like casual tip pictures?

Speaker 1:          00:22:23       So this is her at a movie premier. She, she'd got the side spillage here. That looks like real tit meat. Cause my tent meet. We'll do that cause fake tits. You'll kind of see the bag like there are hard and you see those fall real. See how they're mushed together in the middle. They're nice. Yeah. Not the perfect. He's got real nice tits. Wait until she pumps out a couple of kids that we can get her on the show. Join them now I would love is the articles about her cleavage. Oh cool. Keeping it classy. Oh she's still 40. Damn. Really? She ain't got no kids. That's why they'll titties. Look all night if she doesn't have kids. I'm just assuming maybe she had him lifted after some bitches are lucky they have kids or tits. Pop right back. Hi Mine Minor, the state troopers for life.

Speaker 1:          00:23:11       I had to get something done, especially with a second kid. It's a disaster now. See that's, that's the outfit she wears in court and then there real, the whole, everything is about those tits. Molly's, Molly's takes ticket. But it was, it's a good movie. If you guys were looking for a movie, you haven't seen it. I think it's uh, it's definitely an entertaining and you like tits. These, this is the kind of show you're going to, like, you got a wife, it doesn't let you look at stuff. You can be like, let's watch Malia. I heard it was a really cool story. And then you stare at Ted's room. No, interesting analysis, Tom. But here's the thing. So I texted, uh, this fun of ours. He works as a stylist. He'd silo styles, all these celebrities, you know, I said, do you know Jessica Chastain? You work with her? He goes, I don't style her. I asked him, do you think those tits are real? He goes, oh, yeah, yeah, those are real. I've seen her before and he's a gay guy, so guys, they know this stuff. They really know.

Speaker 3:          00:24:13       Um, according to this, I don't, I don't think she has kids.

Speaker 1:          00:24:18       Yeah. That's why those titties look nice. Yeah. Yeah. She, she 40, she had tests like that.

Speaker 3:          00:24:23       I ain't got no kids. It doesn't say here. I mean, it says that she's, uh, she's married,

Speaker 1:          00:24:30       looks like to a real fucking Guinea. Gian look up bossy that, that see an actor and he's a normal person.

Speaker 3:          00:24:43       Just, uh, yeah. Anyways.

Speaker 1:          00:24:48       Yeah. But those tickets are, they're really something. And her teeth are nice and white too. Like she has really white teeth. I admire that. She has really nice teeth. Those are important, especially as a movie star. Now, you know, you're a movie star now. Do you think you'll get yours whitened?

Speaker 3:          00:25:03       Um, uh, there's still a little, oh, it was right. By the way, this, this Italian guy, he's the count of the Busey the, but at both Soulo noble family cheese account. Yeah. That's cool.

We learned something every time with doctor drew. Maybe. Sure dupe many thanks to him. All right. We'll be back shortly. You won't know. As always that we paused and we're back from the pause you never knew about. Um, and joining us as long overdue, um, is really long overdue. You may know him from standup specials, a television shows and a, you may have mispronounced his name for years. Um, uh, I've seen it. I've seen it live and in person. I've heard you say that before. Like people say, I was with them, I was with them on the street in Vancouver and they're like, that's funny when someone says, I love you, I love you Chris. Delea. Yeah, yeah, they still Leah, it's delete. And it won't matter that I said that though because it will still happen all the time. I say it. I make sure to say it. I said apostrophes are until you know it, message it. Really? No, it's Sally. Sally, come on.

Speaker 3:          00:39:46       I don't know. No, it um, it's Italian and they, they just say, I mean people everyday Dalon Chris long don't want to add an hell. Yeah. It's like there's one fucking, isn't that funny? Like someone sees a symbol and they're like, I want to fuck with that. Yeah, I know. I then you go like, just, it's phonetic dude. I know. Telia yeah, I get, I guess Delea I guess I could understand, but people fuck it up way worse. I mean, I've been on the phone with people where they go like, oh, you missed her a yours mine because they go, I think what happens is you don't, mine's not as intimidating, but you know, to some people at [inaudible] and they'll start to go like, I want to say this wrong man. And I'm like, just sound it out. It's exactly the way it seems completely phonetic.

Speaker 3:          00:40:33       Holy for now. Which of course that's why I go by p the letter p I always upset it. I, I always knew I was dating or for real. Like I was like, I liked this girl when I could spell it. Oh yeah. You're like, I don't have to look it up or something. I was like her diehard friend. My real friends can spell my last name. Now is your, is your mom Italian also? My mom is Italian. Yeah, but she's all, her maiden name is Dombrowski. She's pulling the Broski. She from the old country, her parents, her parents, parents and shit like that. Got that deep trauma. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know how much, I don't know how much trauma is and we, I don't know how much traumas in her family, like early, like way back when Paul locks. Are they Jews to no Polish.

Speaker 3:          00:41:24       Yeah. I met, I hung out with the delay is in Vancouver. It was when he shot his last passion. You were there the night before I, something like that. I might, yeah, the vogue, right? Yeah, the vote and I was there the day after you. Oh, you were? Yeah. So you'd shot your special like on a Friday. Got Your mind was Saturday and they didn't change the marquee, which was really cool. I did anyway, they gave her, they were giving me shit about not doing the alt show after my show. Yeah. Oh. And I was like, I'm done feeling, it gave me shit about doing it after shooting my special lights. I was like, well, I'm not, I'm not going to do that. You know? And the guy was like, we can't, we're counting on you. I'm like, for the alt show. Why? They are like a cause.

Speaker 3:          00:42:08       And then when, when they were like a, you know, like agents and managers were kind of giving shit back. They're like, you haven't even changed the Mark Key. All right. All right. All right. Are Bad on that. Yeah. I remember Josh or manager would always just be like, I remember he would just be like, you can do it. You know, they really want you there. They want you to do it. I'll tell him, no, I could tell, you know, I'm like, dude, I'm not doing right. By the way, by the way, by the way, though, me as me, by the way, he did, uh, I did. I was talking about him on my podcast and they apparently like every like week, like somebody like, dude, Chris Lou talked to like in the business, people like from ca are like, dude, have you heard this? He's like, I'm heard it. Alright. Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:42:54       Because he would always say, dude, every time I would pitch a fucking idea to him, he'd be like, well, there's a show in there. He would say and do it. And I'd be like, no, it's a fucking show, dude. It's their show. And they just want it. And I guess tried to do the work, uh, by the way, flush it out. Yeah. Yeah. It was a lot of years we've been hearing those fucking phrase. I mean me and you were like his first, yeah, two of the first I remember, I remember meeting you in front of the Melrose Improv. This has gotta be like, oh seven w and I remember asking you, I actually remember asking him like, Oh, do you guys, or do you work with him? And you're like, oh, he's like helping me out. Oh Wow. Was that long ago, Jesus. And I was like, what do you mean?

Speaker 3:          00:43:42       You're like, glad I even know what that meant. You're like, like he's helped me out, but I'm not like a clinic. So it was probably, so what happened was I, I had started doing standup in 2005 and uh, I, before that I was like, like a writer. Like I had made money optioning scripts in shit. Really? Yeah. Yeah. And um, and I, I started doing standup and my manager at three arts named Stephanie Davis, who was great. She would always be like, you should do stand up. And I would be like, yeah, I've always wanted to do stand up like that in Maya. Was your reaction in my, yeah, in my, ever since I was a kid, I was like, the goal is to be, do stand up. Oh yeah, 100%. But it was always like, I was always like, and I didn't know how dumb that was. This was then, but like, I was like, I'll get in, I'll get famous first, which is like, everyone would hate, hate me. Oh, I know. I

Speaker 11:         00:44:31       know. I know a few people you're talking about comics would hate you. Yeah. But yeah, no, that's like the worst thing to do is, is just you gotta you gotta you know, grind and, and hit the trenches. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         00:44:44       But, but, um, but so, so I, so Stephanie was like my literary manager and she was like, um, she was like try standup and I tried, I did stand up and I did it for a few months and because I was at this point, because also my things that were getting optioned, none of it was getting made, so I was like, oh, this your writing screenplays or yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like I had a movie, uh, Kevin Spacey was going to produce it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You must have been like, fuck, I was 22.

Speaker 11:         00:45:12       Oh my God. Yeah. And did you have, did you, I was wondering this like, did you, because your dad was in the, as a director, yeah. Did you had, had you read just dozens and dozens of scripts, so you kind of, yeah, I grew up in it. Yeah. So I knew what it was all about. What a shit script was and yeah, yeah.

Speaker 12:         00:45:29       But also, but also like, uh, like you know how like, you know, I go up so much, I do stand up so much, like when I'm focused on something, I'm like, I would, I would literally sit and write for eight

Speaker 11:         00:45:43       hours a day. Yeah. I know. I can't even fucking believe I did that. Do you still do this ever? No, cause it, cause it's all about stand up now. You know what I mean? Like I, I like if I'm pitching a show, like I'll develop the idea and shit, but I'm never like, I'm never like, I'm always like, oh, I got a show tonight. You know, I don't want to do this new joke or, or, or develop this or say this new thing. So it's more like I'm about your energy and just, yeah, exactly. My energy. Yeah. Can I just say, I'm so impressed with your, you're such a great performer. You're always up great. You're always great on stage. When I see like a pop at the store and I'll see you doing but an television too, like you've done these sitcoms and I'm always blown away, hey you look great on camera and B you can deliver. Sometimes these jokes that like are not technically hard jokes and they're funny and you're like how fucking hard is that? Because I took a Sitcom act in class recently and it's really hard. It's not easy to do sit calm acting. Yeah. Well first of all thanks.

Speaker 12:         00:46:41       I feel like, uh, um, I feel like it, the thing I, you know, I don't know, but I think that it's, it's, it's totally different. Like it's just, it's not, I think when you try to bring the same, like I was talking about this like cause comedian, because comedians will be like ha, cause they'll talk, they'll ask me about like social media. They'll be like, how did you get a following and shit. Like you can't like do the same tone on different mediums. You know what I mean? Like, like if you're, yeah, if you're a comedian on stage doing standup, like that's not the same thing as being a character in a show on a sick. I'm, even though there's an audience there, and I always think about this like, like when you're shooting is especially for me because I'm real animated on stage. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         00:47:21       But like when I go in, I do a show in the car at the comedy store, um, I know there's people in the fucking back. Yeah. You know what I mean? So I can be as animated as I as I need to be, but like when I'm shooting a special, I always have it in the back of my mind that most people are going to be watching this on their fucking TV. So I don't really change much. But like I know I, in the back of my head I'm like, there will be close ups. So like you can't like put, like I've seen Comedians, I've seen comedians who I fucking love. I think some of the top comedians and their specials, just, they, they're just like excited that they're doing the special and you can see it on their fucking face, on the clothes. It's two minute and it doesn't, it, yeah, it's not their best performance.

Speaker 12:         00:48:04       And so even in standup it's a different thing. Like if you're shooting something, so if you're doing something as a, an actor on a sitcom or, or even if you're on a show, you know, some drama or whatever the fuck it is, it's all different. And even on social media, like you can't do the same shit you do on stage on like, you know what I mean? Like it's all different. It's all different. So I think that when you try to bring the same energy but just doesn't work. We were talking about acting in a comedy versus drama and you're like, you said that the dramas are the worst because like you're there all day and then you're like, hey, what I cut. And like that's, that's the fun of the show. Yeah, it's, it's a, it's, it's really like, I mean, when you're doing a comedy like you do, you, you're literally like, I don't know, man, when I shot this movie called Flocka dudes and uh, it was with like all of these great comedians that are, you know, like a CML Hannibal.

Speaker 12:         00:48:58       Uh, I mean, Brett Gelman was in it. It was just, we were, we were crying, laughing, shooting the fucking movie and um, and then you do like a drama, like, you know, I mean, I was on the good doctor last year and it was just like, you don't have that every time you do a take on, on a comedy, it's like you find out, oh, this is funny too. I'll just this funny, we'll do it again. This is funny until you do it seven times, whatever. It's so funny every time. But you know, I'm talking to this doctor about like, I'm the doctor, his neighbor, and I'm like, oh cool. Yeah. So how was work? It's like, yeah, it's like you got, if you're not, unless you're doing like a real, like the doctor role is cool. You know what I mean? Like, cause he's like, it feeds them artistically and he's playing this real role and he's got like, but like when you're the neighbor in a drama.

Speaker 12:         00:49:45       Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and I, I did this, this movie every week to, that's what I said. I actually started doing it on stage. Like my, I started talking about how like my worst nightmare job is to be on like CSI and for eight seasons be Rich's shit, but be that fucking guy where you're like, I'm way I had to type in. And you know what I mean? Blow my brains out. I flew with a, what's the guy that played a, Chris Noth played Mr. Bailey and that sex in the city. So we were talking all about this stuff and he goes, he said, um, he's like, he's like, you know, that role is like, it was fine or whatever. And then he goes, um, he was on law and yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       How was, how did you like that? He goes, well, he's like, it gave me a lot of financial security, but he's like, every week it's the same print. And you just go like, you're like, we need to talk to that guy now. You walk in and you're like, sit down. And he's like, it's just repeat every week. He's like, there's nothing there. He's like, you know what I want to be on. It was like Downton Abbey. That's what he, he was like, you know where there's like actual real things happening. There's a, there's the drama swells and the stakes like, and he's like, it's just like brilliant writing and he's like this law and order bullshit man. And then he got, he got mad at the, uh, there's a, there's a lot of flight attendant who freaked out that he was on the plane cause like, you know, women and she saw me, she started to shake and he was like, God dammit.

Speaker 3:          00:51:20       I was like, oh. He's like, he's like, not with American Airlines. This is fucking Delta Bullshit. They're, they're obviously not professional. When she did that, he should have just said, sit down, sit down. And then they're asking him for pictures and he's like some professional, oh, the actual, that's hilarious. Tenants take a picture. I don't, we were talking about this, me and you. We don't cause Burt likes it. What were we talking about? When people come up we don't like it. Right? Yeah. I'm just not writing me to speak for you, but I'm like, first of all, I'm super nice to everybody. Of course. Like anybody says anything to me. I'm always nice. Of course. I'm saying that he relishes the courts. It, we went to the national championship game with a Ari and men. People will be like, hey Burt. He'd be like, do you want a picture?

Speaker 3:          00:52:13       Ask them if they want to take a pic. And then they'd be like, all right. You would be like, like, yeah. So it was totally, I don't like is that because it ends up on the Internet and you look like Shit for a minute? You know what I mean? I never think of it. That's I guess for a woman to fucking Yvonne, I'm always just like, I don't, I don't, I don't know what is. Um, I'm putting expectations of the person, I'm assuming them. So I'm always like wondering where, where you're expecting this to go? In other words like, oh like you know, sometimes I'll walk in, they're like, come have a drink with us. I'll be like, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're a stranger. Yeah. I'm just, I'm just going to say this is the one of the first things you learn. No. Well I'm Burt will like invite people back to his hotel. I'm at the Hyatt. That's cool. Yeah. One time he did it to the audience of the show. He was like, there was a performing and he's like, oh so if you guys want to come and they came in like drove. Oh my. Especially cause they like we can party with the party guy. Yeah, well that's the whole brand.

Speaker 12:         00:53:26       Then the bartender was like out of shit. Like what? We're not, we don't even have the alcohol anymore dude. I like, I have like in my head, I have like, I like these rules where it's like, first of all, I think I was telling you, I don't know what it is with me, but I think, and this is not an exaggeration, I eight or nine out of 10 times they come up, they say something insulting. Oh, right, right, right. Like they don't even realize, you don't realize it. And I understand, I understand. You know, we lose track because we're around people that we think are funny all the time, but they're like, oh, oh, this is the only, this is, I get to see a comedian. I like, I never have seen that. Right. Yeah. So I get that they get the motor mouth thing, but whatever you wanna call it.

Speaker 12:         00:54:08       But like, there'll be like, oh my God, like, like, um, man, oh dude. I always try to forget my friends fucking hate you and always, but I always stick up for you like that and you're like, and I'm, and I'm, and, and, and so if that happens, I'm not nice to you because you have to understand that what you just did. Yeah, no, I agree. Yeah. So I say, did you just come up here to tell me a bunch of people don't like me? Well, no, but I do. Yeah, exactly. No, I'm trying to say, aw, man, but just say your stuff. Then at that point just say, Oh shit, I'm sorry. I didn't know what to say, but that never happens. They're like, no, no, no. I just go and I know what time your mind, you know, you remind me of like, I'll be like, what?

Speaker 12:         00:54:50       You know, you remind me of who? That guy, uh, from the hangover. I'm like, Zach Galifianakis. Yeah. I'm like, why? Because we have beards. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know who's really funny? Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That's what agents and managers like to do too. But yeah, I don't even like, but there's also like little ones that are like, that kind of irked me. Like, oh dude, my fucking brother's a huge fan. Can I get a picture for him? Always. Yeah. Like, you know what I mean? It's like a friend loves you. He's going to be good. Crazy that I took a picture of it. I always say, Oh, not you, Huh? Oh No, no, I'm not. I like you too, but yeah, I like to do cause della. But um, yeah, agents will do like, hey, you sold out the wheelchair and you're like, yeah. They're like, that's great. Who sold out six?

Speaker 12:         00:55:39       I had a woman come up to me once after a set at the comedy store. I still to this day don't know what she was getting at, but she said, hey. And uh, I was like, oh, what's up? And she was like, you really funny. And I was like, oh, thanks a lot. I appreciate that. And so, so far, right. The compliments you really well. Yeah. Uh, she says, uh, yeah, like super real, super funny. And I was like, oh, thanks a lot. Like also, that's the other thing. How many times do people say it? A few times and you're like, listen, I got it the first time. You're like, hey dude, you're so funny. Oh, thanks. Like really? Oh, thanks. No, no, no at all. Like, seriously, I believed you the first time doing it. I don't know where are you trying to take this, right? Yeah, exactly. So, um, so she doing that, she did it like twice and then I said, oh, thanks a lot. And then she said, I mean, you know, and I said, uh, I said, uh, I, I said, what, what? You know? And she said, uh, I mean,

Speaker 13:         00:56:38       okay.

Speaker 12:         00:56:38       You know, you're not like,

Speaker 13:         00:56:42       yeah,

Speaker 12:         00:56:42       amazingly funny. And I was like, and I couldn't believe it. And I said, what? And she said, no, no, no, no, no, you're funny. You're really funny, but you're not like, and she would do that. And I said, I don't know what you're, what, what, what is this supposed to go? And then she, the way it ended was, I mean you're not like Eddie Murphy. Nobody's, that's what she said. And I said, okay fine. I said, you're just being rude. I get, why are you pointing this out? Why their levels? Just say the compliment and then the weirdest one I ever had it because it lasted too long and she kept, she kept not saying things and I was like, Whoa, come on, spit it out. But man, one time I remember this guy came up to me outside of the comedy store. Yeah. Yeah. Cause Cause I, cause I, he comes, he came, he came up to me is a fucking kid.

Speaker 12:         00:57:37       He was in his twenties and he was like, hey man, dude, my friends fucking always talk shit about you. They don't think you're funny but I think you're the fucking funniest. I go like this, fuck you right in his fucking face. I go, fuck you bro. And he had his phone out to take a picture and I walked in and he was like, oh, what did I say? He knows. Why do you think that bothered you? It sounds like the compliment of like the hate you, but I like it. That seems to be the one that, because here's what it is, here's what, yeah, because, because they think that they think that

Speaker 12:         00:58:11       there was, they're saying like, you know, there's that whole thing, like, it's Kinda like saying like, oh, that bans great. Oh yeah. I liked them before their album came out. I liked them. They want, they want to be in on the, on the thing that other people aren't in on. You know, that fucking bugs the shit out of me. Dude. There's one thing to say, I love your work. Thank you. You're great. That's it. And you know what, the other thing, the other part of this is that, um, that is lost on some people is that they don't make that same concession to their compliment to other types of artists. It's like if they saw the actor the thing, they wouldn't be like, you're a decent enough access. They would just be like, I love you. And Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No one goes up to the fucking band and is like, you're kind of a good band. Uh, there's another bay. Yeah, yeah. We're also out on the fucking patio and shit. Like I was starting to bred her and, and he was like, dude, think about like, if you love comedy and you're, and you're like, and you, and you live in Iowa and you're on Netflix and you're like, oh, these guys are amazing. You go to the comedy store, you can just be like, Hey, what's up? Yeah, it's true. It's insane.

Speaker 11:         00:59:22       Hit his lunch was saying, it's like, it's like you, you go and you fucking see, uh, you go, you go see Derek Jeter at the fucking, you're, you're at the Yankees game and then you're like, oh, hey, what's up Derek? And he's like, Hey, what's up? Let me just think. I'm trying to think from the perspective of the audience member who's like, Hey, my friends don't like you. I think they're trying to be like, just wanting to know I'm going against all odds here. Like, yeah, I'm kind of telling my friends to go fuck themselves. That's how much I'm going to bat for you. You're that guy, a positive way of thinking about it. However, you have to understand that that's not how it's going to come across. He's right though. I mean, you know Delhi's right? You're actually right to, yeah, you're right. But I'm trying to think like why would someone would be like that? Cause they're like, I argue with my friends, I defend you. You're my guy.

Speaker 3:          01:00:04       Also, there's this one, there's this thing that happens in people's heads that they're not even fully aware of when they meet a comedian in that is that especially one that they just saw. They're like, you just made all these people laugh. Um, I have a moment with you. Right. And they want to say something either really funny to you or insightful or memorable. And so they, they kind of go like this, it, and they, it's a verbal diarrhea and let you know I had one.

Speaker 11:         01:00:30       And Alcohol, alcohol is a factor. Comes up to me after this coffee goes, uh, she goes, Holy Shit, that was fucking hilarious. And I go, oh, thank you. She goes, but I'll laugh at anything that makes me mad.

Speaker 3:          01:00:47       Great. And then her friends are like, she's a fucking idiot. Yeah. She said that thing don't I got, no, no, no. I get it. It's fine. It's fine. Yeah. I've, I've had a bunch of those, man. I've had a bunch of those that you're just there just like you kind of want to go. Do you know, I also, my, my pet peeve one is I find it super annoying. It's like you walk, let's say, uh, from a club into like the shit bar room. Most people are gone. There's people you always, or maybe it's like the hotel across the street and like somebody will be like, oh. They're like, yeah, they go pretty funny.

Speaker 11:         01:01:19       Oh, bad. Rude. That, I don't know. I acknowledge that. I'll be like, yeah, that drives me nuts because it's like, Yo, they're in my head. They're like, I got shit to you. You know what I mean? Like I'm good at my job. Like, oh, you're cool now. I just bought a ticket to see me and you left your ass off and now you're going to be cool. It'd be cool. To me,

Speaker 3:          01:01:39       to me is the equivalent of literally looking at someone and being like, you're not bad looking. And you're like, what?

Speaker 11:         01:01:44       Oh yeah. Pretty good. As so dismissive. I get that from men. Men, men say what it is guys or girls and guys all feel like you don't want to feel like they're bowing to you. Right. You were like a reserve. I will say, I bet Chris gets it more because he's your eye. To me it seems like a lot of like young girls like you, cause you're, you know what I'm saying? Like your demo is, yeah, maybe like cuter, hotter. Not like Tom was a salmon. Mostly dudes. I get the guys that look like me and yeah, true. They have guys

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       that come to my show look like they have health problems. I always joke about, I'm like, I've never see, uh, there's, there's no crystal his audience. It's significantly better looking than yours. Like let's just, absolutely in court would be proven. Correct. So I'm imagining that you have these like cute girls in the club too, by the way. Sorry. In the clubs. So there'll be like delete was here. Whoa. I didn't know we had people that looked like that in the city. That's what I'm saying. They're all good looking. So the, the guys must fucking hate you. It's gotta be hate daggers.

Speaker 12:         01:02:50       I do get, I do get like sometimes like the guys are like, like 12 like do dudes come out to see me like together and they're like, we listen to you in the fucking thing and are like, Oh God, they think I'm like, Damn. I'm like so not that guy. You know what I mean? Like, but um, but yeah, biggest stabilized. Okay. Do you get into Twitter battles? Are you talking about, you're talking to the fucking grand slammer, right? Yeah, cause I don't pay attention too much, but I imagine you'd be one of the people that would engage. It's just my wife, he doesn't lash it slot. People say to me like, you know, you should really let that go. You know, like people are like, you're better than that. And I'm like, there is no fucking way I'm better than that. I'm that good.

Speaker 12:         01:03:34       However good you think that is. That's exactly the level, dude. I just, my one of my faith and people are like, you shouldn't let it get to you. It's not even that it gets to me. And I'm not saying it never does. Of course, sometimes it does, but it's, it's so fun. That's the whole thing. I think it comes across that you're having fun. Oh, okay. Good. Good, good. Me. It's good to know. That's good to know. What's your, what do you, what, what turns this is what I love about it, dude. This is what I fucking love about it because first of all, we live in the age of the Internet, which is fucking bullshit. Okay. Because a guy who's not even close to me, who I don't know, should not be able to say anything to me. That's it. The rule, he's not in the room with me.

Speaker 12:         01:04:17       I don't know him. He shouldn't be able to talk to me. Okay. We live in a world where everybody likes that can talk to me. Okay. And, and that's in my head fucked up. All right. So, so the fact that that person can just like, dude, you okay? And it's hard to do this without sounding like a pompous or whatever. But like if I, if, if, if when I was a kid, if I could reach out to like people that I like, oh my goodness, I, that would have blown my mind. Like I remember I met Jim Carey once and I didn't wash my hands for like four days, but now people are just like, let me just tweet him. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. You Suck it fucking in this movie. But so, so now, so now the fact that somebody can do that okay.

Speaker 12:         01:05:02       Is and the fact that I can tweet, uh, you know, whoever, uh, Tom Hardy, it's a, it's a, it's a luxury. It's a privilege. Okay. Yeah. So if you're going to be able to do that, they, ah, I'm just discuss, nor is going to see, you know, he's going to see this. No, fuck that. I'm retweeting it now you get to see how my life is, dude. Yeah. I'm retweeting this and I'm giving you a fucking, I'm, I'm giving you a shot or whatever the fuck you want to call it. And now everybody gets to talk shit to you. This is all dude. What the fuck is not cool? This is my life, motherfucker. This is how it is. This is, this is that you've entered, this is exactly what you wanted and this is what life is. This is the Internet. You get to talk to me. Oh everyone gets to talk to you now.

Speaker 3:          01:05:50       I always thought I was crazy too, when somebody will talk shit and then they go, ah, they talk shit. And if you put them on blast then they're like, it's really not cool the way you shared it with everybody. And you're like, yeah,

Speaker 12:         01:06:03       wait what? You shared it with everyone as soon as you tweeted it, it's the internet. The fact, the fact they are freaks you out the most. What gets under your skin on Twitter? Um, well here's the other thing. I'll, I'll go look at my name. I don't look at just cause I want to see the negative shit. So I'll just type in my name. I did it the other day. I look at my name because I was like, I can't wait to retweet some of these guys and like talk shit cause they don't fit because they don't think they have like 36 followers and they're like, I'm just going to say fuck it. And then I love to, I love to think of them going to sleep and then waking up and being like, what the fuck? I like having just replies and then, cause I know, I know they get, I know they're a hoe. They're heart beats a little bit. How, how laughter.

Speaker 3:          01:06:57       I've seen you do it tomorrow. People, obviously the biggest one ever was this Logan pool one, which I know you've probably discussed as an ad nauseum, but just to some people that are not really asking about, uh, that's the youtube guy. Young guy has like fucking crazy and he has like millions, millions of subscribers on youtube. Millions and millions of people follow him on social media. He's a very young demographic. Um, and he got in a lot of shit obviously when he went to Japan, he was filming blogs and he made one where he went into like the suicide forest, filmed the dead body and then, you know, made his video and then people around the world, we're just like, dude, you need to reevaluate your whole Evan. He know he went off for a while anyways, so he's, he tweets out that he has a video that like everyone needs to see or something. And Chris just goes like, no, they don't. And this guy is like, uh, this kind of goes right here. Oh yeah. I'm laughing because I know why your comedy career took a dive, which, so that's what this guy says back now when you see that,

Speaker 12:         01:08:08       what you called it on the top, we come back. That's the name of the is we can

Speaker 3:          01:08:15       come back. Um, so when you see it though, yeah, you see it, uh, you're, you're, you're adrenaline's going right? Like you gotta be excited. When I saw that, I was like, Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Like, yeah, I was like, so like, oh, I almost was like, oh no. Like this guy. Like what is he doing? So you had a very calm assessment. It was very calm. Yeah, it was very calm, but it was excited in my, in my, in between this and you w w what is soon to be the greatest? The Grand Slam. The Grand Slam of all time. How long does it take it? It was, it was a few. It was not like a few minutes to read it. Yeah. And then when you drafted it, you knew you had a fucking I, that was just the one I knew how I knew. I was like, that's just what I was like, this is what, this is what the joke is.

Speaker 3:          01:09:06       Like, there's no like, that's look at this. So this is what Chris responds with. At least when my career dies, you can film it and put it up on Youtube. Retweeted 150,000 times and liked 665,000 times. All right. So I got it. I didn't think it would do that. Anyone assumed? No, it was a good one. Yeah. I literally was like, ah, this is the right thing to say. It's funny. You know, I would think it was funny if I, I imagine someone else say, I'd be like, Oh yeah. Would be like, oh wow. It is like when you know, like when you've done roast roast, most of like the, like the real experience roast writers will tell you when you're gonna when you, what the approach to writing a roast joke is actually do the thing that you think of when you think of that person.

Speaker 3:          01:09:57       In other words, if you're roasting, um, uh, a giant fat guy, you go in there like if you, like, if everyone thinks of, well that guy's enormous, that's the wheelhouse because then it becomes a relatable joke. Right. You know, so if, if the person is, if the person, everybody knows the thing. So that's the people, that's how he was introduced to. Exactly. Yeah. So it's like, it's like a perfect, that's great gross joke. Cause it's like it's a put down, but it's not like a two aggro. Yeah. I didn't want to be person. I mean, I guess there's a little bit personal, but not really. But like I wasn't, yeah. Oh Man. Great. But yeah, and then I, and then I went to bed and then I woke up and it was like, you know, 200,000 likes and shit. And then like he must be getting texts from people and everything.

Speaker 3:          01:10:42       Yeah, yeah, yeah. Dude. It was like doing the tonight show in the 80s people, I would be walking down the street and people are like, hey man, got you back from Logan. It's like so funny, Dude. It was like a, but he tries to come back and then I started to be like, dude, I just like just like, don't, he's losing delayed. So I was like, yeah. I was like, I don't want to keep going. I didn't want to really keep going, but I will because I'm me and I'm like, I love it. You know what I mean? You are. Thanks. And how does it feel to have your name finally attached to something fun? Oh my goodness. Okay. But people, it was like, it was, it was, it was not even really

Speaker 3:          01:11:21       the credit goes to how much he, people didn't like him. Right. That was what people were retweeted. That's true. Not necessarily I made the joke, but it's, it's because it's attached to somebody who's done something fully unlikable and you're, yeah, but I mean, he, he was like, he like people didn't, people hated him before that Japan Shit. And now there was a reason where it was like, oh great, because you mean he would go in, annoy the shit out of people and be disrespectful and shit. He was like the, the, the, the Tom Green, but the tongue green was funny. You know what I mean? Like, but like what was like, okay, but be funny, any like followup to this whole thing and anything like as far as like somebody reached out to you from that knows him or anything like that or no, no, not really.

Speaker 3:          01:12:08       No. I mean, he, he, uh, you know, I don't know the guy for all I know, he's in, in the, on his phone just like, oh, this is funny. I was just fine, I'm having a good time, maybe years. And, um, if I met the guy and he was nice fucking, oh cares, like I'm, yeah, no, I'm not. And like, you know what I mean? Like if you do something fucked up, which that was pretty fucked up what he did. Yeah. Um, you know, may, maybe he genuinely doesn't, you know, he feels terrible and he's, who knows? Maybe he's a fucking reformed good guy. I don't know. But, uh, but like, I, you know, I fuck up you fuck up. It's of course, but it's like on Twitter, it's like, it, did you hear from anybody who you've never heard from in like supportive? In other words, he was like, oh my God, like famous. Yeah. Uh,

Speaker 3:          01:12:53       I don't know. I saw some people that retweeted it that I was like, Oh wow, that's funny. Oh, right. Like bikes, I can't remember. I can't remember who, but like, uh, um, you know what? I posted it on Instagram. Yeah. I posted it on Instagram, the screenshot and like, people like, like Steve [inaudible], Steve Urkel was like, wow, man. Oh, like, yeah, like that kind of shit. That's great. Um, yeah, so stuff like that, people are like, I don't want no part of you, man. I don't want any business with. Yeah. Like Dylan Mcdermott was like, Nice. That's so funny. Um, hey, so give us your, we were watching this. Tell your, uh, your assessment of, uh, what's going on with this girl.

Speaker 4:          01:13:31       I need some dick badly. I'm fucking tired of wasting this good ass fucking pussy. Oh yeah. I'm fucking tired of it. I'm fucking tired of my pussy. Just fucking white spin.

Speaker 3:          01:13:47       So do you feel like, um, would you ever have sympathy sex with someone? Like would you throw someone a bone that you're not that attracted to? Well, she's attractive. I'm saying I'm, I'm relating something that's not necessarily really do this. I'm just saying, would you, would you ever throw, I don't know. I'd never have. Um, you never like, uh, you know, not, she's not, but she's, cause that's not where my brain was going with this. And then I was thinking of like this real homely girl one time on a cruise that I was like, yeah, I knew it was because of personal experience. Some girl you bone on a cruise, some pink, and then you did it. I ignored her. I can't, you never told me this. I've known for 13 years, 14 years when we got to bring it up. We'll talk about are I want to know. So was she real fat? Was she, no, she was just like, Eh, I want to, uh, she was just kind of like lagging behind and I was like, I kind of want to talk to her cause she looks broken and talks about what else, what happened was the next day, uh, when homely was like, kind of like, hey, I was like, and then, uh, and then I, I got a direct line to the one on one to 10. How old are you?

Speaker 3:          01:15:10       35. 36. I was a 21. Oh Wow. Yeah. Very that my dad was on the cruise too. No, he, well, he kind of knew. He was like, he was, um, you could tell it was like he was keeping it, you know, he wasn't being like gross. And he was like, it's funny like to watch you like you kinda like lay back because he would see me before he would go, he would turn in real early, you know, but he'd be like, Oh, I see what you do. You kind of like lay back and you kind of like assess like a, like a, like a Hyena. Yeah. Yeah. He was like, and then he's like, and then you kinda make your move after you've assessed the room. And I'm like, well I'm alone. I'm alone with my dad would call vulture.

Speaker 3:          01:16:02       I wasn't one of these guys who was like, cause some of the guys, especially at that age, you know, really like talk, talk, talk, talk, talk to everybody. And I was like, wait. So, okay. So I was relating to you that I, I've never, I've never done that, but I don't think, I don't think I would. I Dunno. I Dunno. No. So this animal though, she, um, I don't know. We're trying to, I was first we were trying to, we were like playing, thinking about her as being real. Then I was like, maybe she's doing a bit like, cause she knows she would get, but then

Speaker 4:          01:16:34       I want to get fucked Neil. Okay. I should be able to get fucked when I want to get fucked. I work so fucking hard. I deserve to be getting my face fucked right knee. Okay. Big Cock in my throat. Yeah. Yeah. Suffocate me. Sucking dot. You got to fuck tablet and fuck who I want to fuck up there too,

Speaker 3:          01:16:56       but wouldn't that my pole whole thing with this is like how, how are you having a problem getting, because she's doing it for views. I mean it's a legitimate request for Dick's in her throat. No, I mean there's plenty

Speaker 12:         01:17:10       of guys that would do that. I, I don't, I, it's like if you're going to be a slut, BF slept for real. You know what I mean? Don't, don't joke around about this shit because this shit is real life. Real slots get offended. This is the game dude. Yeah. Yeah. If you, you know, you can't be all, oh, you know, go go to target and say this shit, fuck my face. They're going to see Dan. We'll see. Cause that's what I'm saying, it's not hard for a woman to get that. I get you want you want, you don't just want any guy to fuck your face. Sounds like she does. Yeah. But if she, but she would go, I mean she could go outside and just doing like a homeless guy or guys out of jail or even guys that she isn't feeling, you know, it's like she wants yeah that is annoying as shit cause it's sure for views and all that and that, that is just, I mean talking about the Internet did to me that's what's wrong.

Speaker 12:         01:18:06       That's another thing wrong with it. It's like just a little taste shit or whatever the fuck you, you've seen it a little tay. Yeah. Which is like nine years old. She's like, I'm nine years old. I got my money. Then you bitches. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. That was really gross. Will your parents, they're probably posting it. Yeah, they are. I'm sure. But like, what are you doing? What are you doing? And then, and then the, and then the, um, the, how about now? Cash me outside girl who saw her on Dr Phil and was like, Oh, I want to see her rap. She has an album now. 10 million. I looked at, I looked yesterday, 13.5. Wow. Who the fuck I get like, you know, you know, in 10 years are going to be nobody. But like that's generous. Generous. Yeah. But I mean like, okay, well yeah, maybe you're right.

Speaker 12:         01:18:53       But I mean, I hope so, but like, it's like, dude, you're the glorifying the idiocy of America, I guess. But it's like, it's so fucking weird, man. That's somebody would look at that, catch me outside girl and be like, what else you got? You're a real talent. That's so weird to me. No, it's too saying you wouldn't eff that girl. We just saw that girl. No Way. That will be a fucking insane. Well, first of all, she's crazy. Oh yeah. Uh, right there. She's crazy. No, because we see these videos so much. Then I'm like, I can't tell is it mental illness? Is anybody that would put that on there is a crazy person. Yeah. Yeah. Well I haven't dated since the 90s. Friendster was around when Thomas, right, right. Yeah. No, that, that, yeah. I don't know this shit anymore. Yeah. I was trying to find this one was getting it on cruises. Was it a carnival cruise? Might. It's a real bottom of the barrel today. And cruises are horrible. You know, I went on to, I had one good time. I was 21 and I went with a girl and it was so fun. And then I went on a fucking cruise on a bachelor party. I don't want to jump off the worst. You ever done the Gig on the cruise ship? No,

Speaker 3:          01:20:09       no, no, no, no. I came real close. Yeah. Um, I got a call and I, you know, I didn't have that much money and, and the agent was like, no, you'll have to do like this welcome aboard thing. Oh No. And then you'll have to do like to clean sets. Oh. But then you get to do one dirty set yet to and yeah, but the good news is, and it was like $1,000 more than I was used to making it right. And I was like, I think I remember this is like, and I feel like something came up like an international gig where I was like, oh, I actually can turn this off. It was relief. It was when I turned it down I was like, oh my God. Oh Wow. Cause I wasn't prepared to turn it down, really, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They were, I was this close to getting an offer to do Olivia cruises, the lesbian one. Oh really? This is when we were living rampart. Division. Yeah. There was talk of it and I was like, I don't know. I'm not gay. Am I

Speaker 9:          01:21:13       exactly what I'm talking about? She us out to God. Why is she screaming?

Speaker 3:          01:21:30       Love to see the person just shooting it. Just so like, man, where's her house? I don't know.

Speaker 9:          01:21:38       Nope.

Speaker 3:          01:21:43       Okay. But by the way, those people, unless her parents are rich, like she's not making that much money. She can't know. There's no fucking way. There's not, it doesn't. I like what, what it's like, it's like these, the girls on Instagram that are like, have like 10 million followers that are like, where they're like, buy this tea or fucking coffee, scrub body shit. It's like their, first of all, uh, their followers are all men. So then they can't sell shit to ladies. They're not making that much money. That what does, what does, what brand is paying her? Like what, what, what brand is paying her? What, what, what is his Windex paying her? No, it's brand. It's like, and there's no, uh, there's also that's like the, you know, the big thing is like, there's obviously no skill set there. Well, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, and, and I get, and I get that if you're 12, who cares? Just like, I want to watch that shit, but like this is the, the, the following of a spectacle. You're just watching this, right? It, that, that is just my God, man. You guys have kids. It's like, imagine ever going to happen to our kid. No. Yeah, no. I, I, I obviously, but I mean, just imagine if you had that kid that was like, okay, I don't want to go shit girl, she's going to be at the House of Blues. That's the thing is that they all have these tours. He's like, this girl.

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       Nah, Bro, come on, we're all going man. Nah, be just like the next day I'd be like, I bought you eight books last night. Um, yeah, so she said, you know what I'm saying a lot. This is apparently, uh, somebody who drops everything like that a lot.

Speaker 12:         01:23:24       Oh yeah. You know, we had our odd man rush there in the first period, which is not good for us, but I mean everyone had their nerves going and everything like that. And then, which we're glad to just keep them to want and everything like that. And then we went back and after a period in the locker room, just talked about what we need to fix and everything like that. Stick to the game plan, get back on it and everything like that. So that's one up deep trance and everything like that. Oh, anything like that? Oh No, come on. I'm coming in here to the tournament. I got nice shot long text from him this morning saying, don't let the atmosphere, uh, you know, get your nerve shaken up,

Speaker 14:         01:23:56       play your game, which is what I can do out here. And everything like that. Definitely helped for a moment. Anything like that, the big matchup.

Speaker 12:         01:24:06       Um, it should be a great game. I can't wait to play him. I know they're doing good. Only one last on the season I believe and everything.

Speaker 14:         01:24:12       I'm kidding.

Speaker 3:          01:24:15       He doesn't know. I know. Here we did it for him. Here's a bunch of your, everything's like that man

Speaker 12:         01:24:22       and everything like that and everything like that and everything like that. Everything like that, everything like that. Anything like that, you know, like and everything like that and everything like that and everything like that.

Speaker 3:          01:24:30       Jesus Christ, I guess, you know what, seeing that makes me feel a lot better for people coming up. Give him a backhanded compliment. It's like, you don't know what you're saying though. And especially, you know, with, uh, with, with people, with the athletes period. At any level. So like sometimes we, we expect a, uh, just a, a better a hero and also just somebody to be as articulate as a broadcaster. It's just the guy that fucking skates and bangs his head against shit. And then he's like, and everything like that. And we're like, how come you talk skin? It's like as I, I hit stuff and everything like that, it doesn't know what he's saying. Whoa. Is that a new thing

Speaker 12:         01:25:11       and everything like that?

Speaker 3:          01:25:12       I think so. Oh man, that's hilarious. Well, 2016, man, that's something that's so funny. His friends have talked that sock. Do you know what sucks if you're not famous and then you become famous for something that at least with like you guys, it's like, oh yeah, but we, I got a body of work, you know, might know me from, but like, oh my God, that guy just being being the fucking, or being the guy who like fell down and got shit on his eyes are like, that's your, you are being, I mean this is a more dramatic example, but this, this lawyer in New York who's a, you know, he was like screaming at people for speaking Spanish and like that. Now it's, that's you forever. Like you're the racist lawyer. No matter what he ever does, he'll never get away from that white lady who called the police on those.

Speaker 3:          01:26:00       Oh yeah. And she deserves it. That's even smart. People are like, well, you deserve that. You know what I mean? Like that's barbecuing with a man that when and then when, and then when everybody went and had the barbecue the next day, it was the, it was so that shit is just did that thing. But I think reminded me of kids where you remember when like when you're a kid you can tattle tale and then if somebody or somebody goes like, this isn't something, that's how you get emotional because you kind of know you did something wrong. Yeah. There's a camera on her. Someone's filming her when the police arrive and she's like, yeah, I know. She starts breaking down. It's like, I think it was breaking down because she knows. Yeah, she knows it. She's fought, she's fine. But she starts to twist it as I'm so scared.

Speaker 3:          01:26:52       This whole, the meme of that lady or the funniest man, like Obama and Michelle Kissing and she's in the background. Just the moons are the best. Uh, fuck. The Internet is so great though. Never lose that shit. Yeah. The royal wedding. We love those memes that came out. Like people were cutting in coming to America. Oh yeah. Oh, right, right, right. There was that one. Oh, the cause it had the black preacher and they laid, um, uh, what's his name? Uh, Arsenio Hall as the preacher's audio and it looks, it kind of matched really well. Very, I won't have Randy Watson. Fucking amazing. You know what sucks is like, I try so hard to come up with jokes and be so funny and it's just, I just feel like it. You'll never be, I'll never be as funny as some bullshit like that yet. That's a skill too. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. No, I know. I know. I know. Yeah. Fuck that. That's so funny. It's pretty great. Um, so wait, where's this? Oh, the check this. This is a lady who definitely has, I don't know what the fuck is going on with her, but she goes into

Speaker 12:         01:28:10       Taco Bell.

Speaker 3:          01:28:11       And when's the last time you ate Taco Bell? I know. I know the answer. I know the answer. Okay. I was 19. That's a long time. It was a long fucking time ago. And it was in union square in New York City. And what, what made it the last time I ate Taco Bell, I walked,

Speaker 12:         01:28:32       I ate it all at the Taco Bell. I walked out and I thought, I thought I wasn't that, that wasn't, that wasn't that good. And it doesn't feel that good. And I thought, I'm never going to eat taco bell ever again. And I thought, you know how everyone always says they're not going to do something, but then they always end up doing it again. This time I'm not going to do that. And I haven't eaten it in fucking almost years. It's been

Speaker 11:         01:29:01       19 years because that resolution to stop eating Taco bell too, had it in Wisconsin. After the shows in 2011 I drank three glasses of red wine and Taco bell was the only thing open. I hate when that shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I had a Mexican pizza and a bean and cheese burrito. Great. They're great. And I want, I tried to sleep at two 30 in the morning and I wanted to vomit all night long and I, I did the same thing. Never again. Never again. Never again. No. Neil Hamburger,

Speaker 3:          01:29:29       I don't know him personally, but you know about us. Have you seen the Taco bell thing? No. He's one of my favorite social media you're talking about. So what Neil does semi irregularly yeah. Is He will go on Twitter and use the search function to, and he'll just type in like Taco Bell. Yeah. And retweet what people are writing about Taco bell and it's all shit. Like I threw up a of Taco bell. Taco bell got me feeling, I feel like I've been poisoned. I think Taco Bell poisoned me. Uh, fuck you talking about just puke Taco Bell. I do like, it's amazing. It's funny. It's absolutely fantastic. Um, yeah, he uh, he fucking a man. Is that him by the way? Yeah, that's him. Jesus. I didn't know what he looked like. What he does that, um, is he the guy that goes hamburger knows that Hamburger Jones. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:30:26       Yeah. That's shit kills me. Yeah. I remember seeing that on def jam like the first time I saw that I was on the floor. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And I was like, I also had that thing where I'm like, there's no way he's going to keep this up. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then I came to find out like that's 100% is that, that's so funny. Cause he doesn't curse. So every time, really first he says hamburger. Yeah. I mean, yeah. So it's like he'll never be that funny. I won't never be asked to Ham Burger. They're like, yeah, I mean it's shit like that that makes want to quit. I'm like, all right, well I give up. Then we were talking about, um, earthquake doing a gig somewhere, and my agent, your agent to was like a, he's like, man, it was like so devastating the level he was killing it.

Speaker 3:          01:31:10       Oh. He was like, you know, it was like, like the building was going to call like fall down and he goes, you'll never kill that hard. And I go, oh, I know. And then I could tell he was like, I mean, I didn't mean like you won't kill. I was like, dude, I know exactly what you, yeah. And by the way, I will never, right, right, right, right. Yeah. I've been in rooms where, oh dude, I went to, you know, Donald Rawlings, right? Yeah. Like just, I mean, planes could be crashing into the Improv and you wouldn't notice. That's how hard he's killing. Yeah. Right. So I remember they wanted me to do and I, I, I, I don't, it's not my favorite gay, but I liked doing it. Cause I know sometimes the students want want like guys that they like and shit. And I, and I know sometimes they ask for me, but like the, um, the, uh, the rose bowl shows at the Improv, ever do those? Uh,

Speaker 12:         01:32:00       okay. So I guess people don't know at home, but like every, every year, whoever's in the Rose Bowl, a football team, the football teams, they'll have two shows, one for each team. And they're always at like 5:00 PM. Yeah. And, you know, they'll reach out sometimes, I guess if a coach was, the coach will be like, these are the comedians we want or something. And, um, so they asked me and, you know, if I'm in town, I'll do it because, you know, it's cool. The kids are there, students, you know what I mean? Like there, so I go in and I, um, and I'm like, who's on the lineup? And I don't even really ask this all the time, but, uh, I was like, who goes online? And they're like, Theo, Danelle, a few other guys. And I was like, great. I was like, uh, she was like, um, this is the lineup.

Speaker 12:         01:32:43       Tg sends it and it's going to be, I just remember last year was going to be Theo, me and then Danelle. And I was like, I was like, uh, oh cool. Uh, I don't want to follow down out. Right. Yeah. Cause that guy just murders. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but I won't, if, if the lineup were to come out and say, Hey, uh, it's going to be Danelle and then you, I wouldn't have said, can I go before Danelle? Because I, I, part of me is like, I want to see if I could do it right. Do you know what I mean? Sure. So, so, so I get there and I'm, I arrive and as I arrive, I'm walking into the Improv and I hear utter destruction on stage. Okay. So I'm like, oh, this is a great crowd because whoever's on his murdering here from the peninsula.

Speaker 12:         01:33:31       Yeah. And, um, and I go up to, and by the way, Theo is fucking hilarious. I followed Theo all the time. I know how to do it. I don't follow done all, all the time. Okay. So I've never done it. So, so I'm a, I'm on after Theo and I go in and as the destruction is, I'm, I'm like, oh, it's probably Theo on stage right now because I'm showing up almost at my spot time as this is happening. The destruction out of the showroom walks Theo. He's like, oh, what's up? And I'm like, Hey, what's up? I was like, uh, oh shit man, they're running behind, Huh? And he's like, no, not don Nelson. And I was like, Oh shit. So he got here early and he's, he was like, Nah. I was like, oh, so you're going on next? He's like, no. I went on and I was like, oh, uh, uh, so, uh, there's only one more comic and it's me.

Speaker 12:         01:34:19       Huh? And he was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you can crush them, man. And I opened the door to the Improv. Uh, I mean, every single all men 260 plus pounds because of the, there were football team, they're all standing up. They're standing up going like, oh, they're all screaming, jumping up and down shirts like this and Nell is singing. He's just like, it's like, it's like, uh, uh, it's like the joke of a black church, whatever it would be. He's like, Nah, Nah, Nah, Nah, Nah, Nana, Nana, Nana. That's what he's doing. And they're fucking, people are on shoulders are fucking losing their minds. And I say, uh, I go, I walk and read a company anxiety, right? Dude, Rita, Rita though, you know the Rita? Yeah, she comes up and she was like, she literally is like, you're going to do great. And I'm like, you're only saying that because you know I'm going to hit my fucking Dick.

Speaker 12:         01:35:24       I'm going to you. Nobody can follow this. I'm going to eat my fucking Dick. I was like, just end the show ended. But, but part of me is like, ah, fuck it. I'm like, I haven't bombed in a while. Fuck it. I'll just go bomb. Who gives a shit? But then like, you don't want these key, you want to like make these kids happy, you know? So it's like, ah, how fucking go up. And Theo was like, oh, you know what, open up with that, uh, thing about how, because it was happening. I used to have a bit about how one black people laugh, they relu locate and know to get up and they move around. Totally do that. And that's what they were literally doing. So I was like, oh, I'll fucking open with that. Thanks. The, oh by the way, I haven't done the joke in seven years.

Speaker 12:         01:36:04       It was my first special. So I was like, I'll just do that. I guess it's kind of annoying that I got to do that, but fucking, and I can't, I, you know, I don't feel confident enough. But, um, I went up in that, that bit ended up doing that bit, did really well. And then, but then it like, it like was like, I was like, thank God I'm only doing 15 minutes. Cause it was like, there's no way I could sustain it. So it was like, yeah, it was like he murdered, he murdered and it was just like petering out very slowly. And I was like, I had to do crowd work. I was doing crowd work. But man, I mean like aren't good at that though. Well thanks. I mean I had to do that, but do it, I mean, I don't think I've, there's been maybe two or three times I've seen something crushed out heart. I cannot believe what Donald Rolling does. Donnell Rawlings. Yeah, I've seen, um,

Speaker 11:         01:36:45       now there's no feeling to, especially when you're like, it's, it's so when it's like, this is going perfectly for that person. Like, yeah, like every line and like the audience has absolutely losing their minds and I definitely want to go like, no, no, no, no, call it. Yeah. Yeah. Well I'm filming this, the degenerates of comedy. Oh yeah, that's right. That's awesome. And they added the six person and you know how it fucking is Brad motherfucking Williams. And the first thing I tied to Josh, I go, I am not following Brown. Yeah. He crushes like that to where there's nothing. No, you can't follow Brown ones. There's no falling that you see. There are some guys like that that are just, I mean Joey Diaz, Joey to me, that guy too. They're tapping on the same night. Oh yeah, go for it. He's going to go last. He's got,

Speaker 12:         01:37:33       I mean like, yeah. Uh Fuck. I met him one time. I was walking. I mean it's funny dude, I've walked into the commies store wants enjoyed Diaz. He's just like, I know that you're a fucking pussy and everyone's just like, Nah. And I'm like, and I walk in and I literally walk in. I go, oh for fuck sake. Like cause I'm next. You know, it's so funny. I love that though. Cause it's so like I failing is so funny man. You know what I mean? Especially when

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       you're going to be the guy to fucking eat Dale, it's coming. You didn't know it's coming after you've done this a while. Like when, when you're like looking back, I feel like you, you, you think of more adjustments, oddly enough, earlier on for me, I totally agree with you doing like now if I'm like, if I'm after someone just lighten the place on fire, I'd be like, I'm still just going to go up there and it's either gonna work or it's not going to work. And I'm like a slow starter. So if I follow someone killing lots of times people will be like, I don't know what you're doing. Like it takes maybe for a few minutes. But yeah, always been like that though, is that you've always known exactly who you are and what you're doing. You don't adjust for anybody. I don't, I don't address it.

Speaker 3:          01:38:38       Don't make any adjustments. And like people who like, like my dad who doesn't know shit about company and be like, he's been to shows where he's like, uh, how come you don't like, uh, maybe try to make it for them. And I'm like, because I went to that strength and that's something I wish I would've learned earlier. Cause I, I'm the monkey that's like, wow. Well, I'm going to do it this way. How about this way? You know, I don't do it as much now, but oh my God, the hardest I ever bombed. I followed a black guy. We're basically doing a black guy compliment. But yeah, it was a guy in Canada and it was all, it was a Canadian show, all white audience obviously. And um, his name is tricks and uh, and in the, in like 10, 15 minutes into my set, somebody goes, bring back the black guy.

Speaker 3:          01:39:28       Like they actually yelled at and then it went downhill real. It wouldn't really, really bomb. Like boo booed me off. Really asked me to leave. Yeah, yeah, it was, it was 2013. It was a week. I always remember this detail. It was a week to the day that I shot my first special after. So I just thought was so interesting that like at the time you're a career highlight during a one hour special, one week to the day later booed off stage later. It was after. Wow. That's a neat part about standing. I know you can feel great about yourself and then you can feel like a total piece of shit then oh that's interesting. Great. Like showcase of what standard it can be to people. Shoot your special with the special like with the material that is your special. Oh that actually makes me feel better because it's like that's cause it's cause your specialist fucking hoe cause your hilarious.

Speaker 3:          01:40:24       But to be that funny and then to just have it not work, it makes me feel better. Like when it happens to me, you know what I mean? Like there's nothing like bombing. No one is never better than the room. You know what I mean? It's like, Oh the other, by the way, the other person who I've never seen anybody killed this heart in this room. I've seen people kill.

Speaker 8:          01:41:31       lady. What are lie? Yes.

Speaker 3:          01:41:46       Okay, so it was lady goes in there, there's a camera rolling. So she's, she's dead wrong. She's wrong. There's no youngest at this point. You Go, oh my bad. Yeah, let me get a Taco or I'm going to go find Burger King. Those are the two choices. All right. This is where she takes,

Speaker 8:          01:42:13       that's helpful.

Speaker 3:          01:42:14       Anything that's held by the way. So for people listening, she's wearing like a workout, you know, like a almost like a sports bra. Her, her belly is exposed. Right. It's got headphones around her neck, Adidas track pants and you're like, all right. I don't know. It's coming from the just do it. Her post workout, Taco Bell Burger King eating. But, but anyways, it's been the lady, the person working there is, but it has handled it correctly. Oh definitely. We don't have French fries. This isn't burger came so far. She's being held.

Speaker 8:          01:42:47       Just tell me, tell me what you guys,

Speaker 3:          01:42:57       okay. Also still she's like, yeah, but she's getting irritated. Yeah. Person. But she's also like, I like, I know this, this lady started to say, what do you sell? That's like French fries. I yeah, that is what you said is actually saying and the lady, the lady behind the counter is like, the menu is above my head as it is in all of these types of rights. And by the way, you don't have to read it. There's pictures, right? Yeah. There's no extra thing that we don't have that's up there so you can read there. Anything that's like a French fry that you think you can get that. Okay. Here to do. The turn is gonna. Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:43:36       Tacos and Burritos. So happy. Cause you had four eyes.

Speaker 3:          01:43:45       Pretty good. Pretty good come back or that guy? Yeah. The girl who was asking for fries said this is racism at its finest. Wow. And then other patrons of this Taco bell where like they have tacos and Burrito, that's what they have right here. So you know. Wow. And now this girl is, first of all, she's getting emotional about, is she on something? It's, it's either or. It's really a game of like, is it mental illness or drugs, which is a bad game show. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:44:16       Yeah. Every day you go to Burger King to laugh at you. Good. This guy's good.

Speaker 3:          01:44:32       Whoa. So again, the other, the patron was like, what did you go to burger king and order to lap. Yeah. He's pretty good. Yeah. Which I love. It's a very specific fish. He didn't say, he said to lap pretty good. Very light fish too. Yeah, it is very, yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:44:49       I don't have French fries, French fries to nothing to me.

Speaker 3:          01:45:05       There's something else I'm going to go mental illness, maybe not drugs. Maybe cause he doesn't seem manic, she doesn't want it to illness. It makes it less funny and uh, I just want somebody to know, oh, you're not familiar with the show. Sorry. I usually doesn't deter us. Um, yeah, I mean she's definitely going through something. Maybe. Maybe it's a, she's just went through a bad breakup and she's just, you know, that's funny then that's fine. It's funny she broke up with her or a guy who love French fries are always like, um, and then here's the best is that she asked somebody else if there were French fries. That's what she just gave away. And that other person was like, yeah, you're at Taco Bell. Okay. Now. All right. So if you were in the Taco Bell at this point, uh Huh. What would she be doing? You would be doing nothing, right? Just watching ear to ear smile.

Speaker 14:         01:46:00       You heard it. Your smile.

Speaker 3:          01:46:04       I would be praying that the guy that everybody yell and be like, I hope he's got something else.

Speaker 14:         01:46:11       That'd be

Speaker 3:          01:46:11       so excited. But you would stay. Stay away. Stay out of it. I think I would have to say something like, let's say like right now, because this turns like, um, unstable emotional behavior turns me off big time where I got like, I don't want to be, but I'm a true, I'm amused at the people interacting. If she said something really fucked up or insulting, let's say to the workers, yes. Then I would jump in. Right, right, right, right. Yeah. No. When I see crazy unraveling, I stepped back and I enjoy, just make time. If it's crazy, if I know it's crazy, then I won't engage. But if I'm like you, but she's probably crazy. I won't say anything. Fuck you bitch. Get me fries. I'd be like, Hey. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's no fries anywhere. Even on the block, like, yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:47:11       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:47:16       Yeah. Well she really handled it really well. Really have the cashier. Yeah, she really did. Wow. Wow. Wait, is that viral now? People are going to be going in acid for French fries though. Keep going at that, but yeah. Hey guys, go ahead and send us your videos asking for French fries now. Del Taco or Taco Bell. I think probably Taco bell's better del Taco. I, I've probably had in my late, in my early twenties. Yeah. But, um, I was, have you heard of the Burger? I don't del Taco. It was kinda good, but I haven't eaten fast food and I mean I've eaten in and out. But besides that clean, are you a pretty, I mean, dude, I honestly, here's what it is. I eat pretty clean until 11:00 PM and then I just, I, I, I'm hungry real comics. I was like, I gotta get something to eat because what time are you going to bed?

Speaker 3:          01:48:06       Usually relates to 2:00 AM that makes sense. So you sleep and usually I, if, yeah. If I have nothing to do. Yeah. Like even, even this, I was like, even this when you were like 11 o'clock Monday, I was like, oh good. This way I have a reason to get up to get up. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. But you have, you know, you have a young, yeah, yeah. That's all we've been making fun of. Scat singing. Oh yeah. You know the scat man right out of the things you need to do to learn to scalp. Right, right. Listen, I'm learning a skill, especially

Speaker 15:         01:48:40       literally even a skill, right? I mean, do you need to learn seriously?

Speaker 3:          01:48:53       And then my son does this. He's two and a half. He's a pro. Yeah. Wow. That guy is so serious about that. Super serious. And now there's, you know what hand boning is? Uh, I know that word. What is this guy's a ham boner. Um, and he also incorporates, I think he incorporates scatting into it too. Hambone it's just going to anger me. I know it. I'm like, oh, it's the combination. You're good at it too. It's completely useless skills combined. Uh, see the, the Internet people will just fight. I was like, Oh, this is, you can do anything and just have a fan base. Absolutely. No, you don't know what this is. I want you to be, don't be, don't be alone. I've seen this guy hit her or do this. I bet couple of minutes,

Speaker 11:         01:49:48       his ball smell better than his beard guy. I've seen this. I've, you know why I've seen this guy. Somebody made a meme about it. I forget what it was, but it was really funny. Oh, you can go fuck himself because I don't think this is a fucking talent either. Oh fuck off with the share sells more tickets than I do this size, this place, man. All three of us.

Speaker 8:          01:50:09       Oh, for God's sake. Oh fuck off. Oh, just hit them.

Speaker 8:          01:50:37       Yeah. But it's not,

Speaker 11:         01:50:40       it makes me so annoyed when they laugh.

Speaker 8:          01:50:42       Oh, me too. It's not a talent.

Speaker 11:         01:50:48       Oh No, it's your drunk grandpa at Christmas. It's not a fucking skill with this asshole smile. Look how impressed he is. That guy, that guy. It's his fault. What will like, I want to know what that guy sees all the time. That, that, that this makes him smile. What does he see? Just war all of the time. Just people getting hit by cars his whole day. People. Yeah, and then he's like, oh, not war. That's literally what he's thinking when he sees that guy. Oh my God. Fuck off. Yeah, here we go. What's so funny? You know what? Nothing. Nothing, Bro. I hope we get shot at the end of this. We think, I literally think an hour I could do in an hour. I keep going over this. I can figure out 80% of it. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:51:44       Oh fuck off.

Speaker 11:         01:51:50       Do you think you sell CDs afterwards? Here's all right. Here's the grand finale. Ready to receive those? Graph it out himself.

Speaker 8:          01:52:04       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:52:05       All right guys, I have a question for you. Okay. Who is more talentless? Yeah. The person on Instagram who's just like the model and then they do meet and greets and they make like Cameron Dallas for instance, he's millions of followers and they did these tours where they just meet greet, right. Or this fucking asshole, like who is more talent, who has less talent I think. I think we're just to remind you, God, I don't like what's more personally, I want bonus in the group. The ham bone. I'm inclined to like, Cameron's a good question. The Internet model like that. Okay. It's beauty is in an eight thing. You're, you're blessed with it. It's useless though. Just like that one's you, it's a, it's a good question. It's a tough question. Who's more talent list? Yeah. Like who makes you angrier? Let, let's go with the field. Well that's different. This time makes me angry. Yeah. He makes me angry. But I feel like the, the cute kid is less talent cause it's Keith all he said, but he said, and he's handsome. He's a model. He modeled, okay, let's put it this way. Mumbling to scale. Modeling is a skill. I think it's what people buy tickets to meet that kid to me. Him. Yeah. This people, people buy tickets to watch them do that. Do that fucking fuck.

Speaker 11:         01:53:39       Yeah. He, um, I think that, fuck this guy. There's this guy, I mean I'm just trying to find the argument here, but this guy at least figured out something to do. That's it, you know, um, the other guy and, and trick people into coming to see who's the real asshole, I guess. Yeah. I mean, I mean, ah, no, no. Three of us went like how we would be crying. I mean to eat an apple. Can you get through who's more talented? Him or the staying alive? Staying alive. Show Christina. What's that? You'll see. Oh yeah, that's a good idea. Well, in the meantime, you know, let's, let's go through the logic here. See that is, here's the other thing, like, um, Cameron Dallas, right?

Speaker 8:          01:54:29       His name that is cute. And that his day, United Day in those days, a Latin those days, even that I pay money to see this guy do this is here.

Speaker 11:         01:54:46       I think he lives outside. Uh, but I'm going by the, uh, the forehead lines and not all, not all of you two feet. Can I tell you, I feel like he's more talented than that. Fucking I like this more. Yeah. I like this was way more, put it this way if you were watching a movie. Yeah. And over the soundtrack, this came on be way more interesting. Yeah. Yeah. You'd be like, oh, that's cool. What is this? Or if you walk into a real guy, he'd be like, what does this fuck? You walked into a room and there's a small stage and this guy was doing this. You'd be like, I know that song and go, but if sold, I was like, you'd be like, fuck this. Got Men. Absolutely.

Speaker 8:          01:55:23       Well, but, but why? He doesn't know the words down low. Jajuan Bennett. So I by no, no [inaudible] United.

Speaker 11:         01:55:41       Oh God. But this guy, this guy has got charisma. This guy's got an angle. The other guy feel like he's a hoodwink. I feel like he's, he's been brutal with me. That's, that's a good feel. Jipped when I see this, the old fucking wire, the intention is, and you know, if he's doing it well, see, cause you know the song, you know the rhythm. So if say United,

Speaker 14:         01:56:04       you know what to say United. And so when you hear someone singing it, you're like, I like seeing you. But you don't even know if that guy's hand boning. Well, like when he,

Speaker 11:         01:56:16       I bet I, I guarantee you there's other ham bonuses that are like, yeah, this guy fucking suck. And then they're, they're more mad than we are. They're like, this is the fucking guy. Yeah. He never closed with the Po. You never know. There's another guy was like, you know, that is my thing. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. How long have I been doing that? A long time. Right? You're right. Yeah. And then obviously you just go, you didn't even pop on that one. Yeah. But the amount of it, this is intricate too. There's a lot of moving parts. He's got to sing the song. He's got to do the lung infection. Yeah.

Speaker 14:         01:56:52       Part. What's emphysema? Dr Juke came in and said it was, he's got, he say was upper respiratory issues. I don't think you need to be a doctor to know that. Wait a minute, how is this guy

Speaker 11:         01:57:21       that long and know what this guys, but that's why it's so amazing. He's a medical marvel. He's working against what he looks like the last guy. Ah, okay. Stuff happens. There is rhythm and he's like, he's one of those guys that if you saw, if you were standing there and you had loose cash in your pocket, yeah, he's doing this, you might be like, yeah, hell yeah, but not fucking old there. There's also a, just on a behind his face, you know, you're like, you feel for him. Yeah. The other guy is like smug and you're like, this fucking guy. Yeah. This guy you want, you are like, oh, I can see behind his face. He's like, maybe you know, I mean, maybe he's crazy, but like you're like, I feel for him, like he wants to entertain you. I feel like it was a warmth or something. Yes. Warmth. That's what it is. Yeah. Yeah. That guy. What? This guy wants to put on a good show. Yeah. The lung infection guy. Yeah, but the other guy, the other, uh, but yeah, the, the, the, Oh, for fuck's sake, dude. That's funny. Do you buy the, you saw that lady, the Tim Horton's on the right. Take a shit in Tim Horton. Oh yeah, I saw you. I saw it from your thing. You repost it. Oh really? Yeah. Crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       You know what? In my head I was like, I was talking to my opener and he was like, uh, what the, what the fuck you think happened? And I, I like, I was like, oh, she's saying I need to use the bathroom. They're saying, no, you can't. You need to buy something. And then just like the only thing we discovered, first of all, you're right, cause we looked at, is it? Yeah. Okay. But the thing that also came out, is it the reason that they said no to her specifically is because she was a known problematic. So like it's like she came in okay. And then like, hey guys know that it's then it, yeah, she's, well it's a crime no matter what. But if, if I didn't know that, if it was just me doing it and say I need you just let them know, I'd be like, I would, I, my thought would be like I should shit on their floor and then give him the business and we'll see what's up. Yeah. Yeah. So I could understand her, but if she was a known person than not. Yeah, that's crazy. She, I mean everybody has been, we've been talking about this. Everyone's been sending in their, um, their try it out. Um, videos. Do you know what I'm talking about? No. Try it. So this thing with your show. Yeah. Yeah. So this guy has a video that we play and try it out. Yeah. Oh yes. No, I know, I know about it. Yeah. What is it? It's this guy

So yeah, it's, it's been, oh my God, it's been so much since since that came in. So what was the thing you're trying to, people were trying to do it, we want people to use it as a monologue and kind of be creative with it.

That would just be true. Then you can move in, but you got a fuck or moving. You're moving. You get fuck. What accident is that? We've been trying.

Speaker 3:          02:03:12       That's right. Cause we're kind of place it is moving. It's east coast for sure. Yeah, try it out. Try it out. Try it out. Yeah. From a building. Do you want to know the big mystery? What? So we, we played this audio for a lot of people. There's one line where he goes, um, he goes, piss on me, beat me, beat me on me. I know that last part, whole minnow. So a lot of people thought he was saying how a man out like piss on me, beat me homie on out. Whoa man. Out Ho Ho Ho me on out. Like, he's like,

Speaker 11:         02:03:45       Oh hold me on out or Homey homey on it. Oh homie on outcome or a

Speaker 3:          02:03:50       piss. Somebody beat me at home, Ya know? And, and then there was just like all types of submissions to what he's saying. And then we, we, we decided that he must be saying he's like rambling through it and he's saying home here now, cause he gave out his address before. Oh piss on me. Beat me. I'm like, you can do it right now. No home here now.

Speaker 11:         02:04:14       Like, hey, a forensics on. Yeah, we have resumes on it. I tried different, it's like that Yanni a Laurel did you find out? Do you know what, what it actually was being said, but I know what it is. It's actually Laurel. Yeah, well it, well they say that if you're old enough you can't hear the higher frequency and the higher frequency he recorded. Oh, recorded saying Laurel. Oh really? So he on an interview, he goes, we

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       said Laurel, but you're right in that it's also a device. You Yanni, right? I was 100%. I was Laurel, it was a, and he said he's saying Laurel, but the pitch either that you naturally here or the pitch that your device is playing. So if it's a higher pitch, cause I put somebody played on their iPhone is like, wait, what? That sounds like Yanni.
