You let me know who you are. Is it, is it, is it, is it,

Speaker 4:          00:05:48       I chose to protect our children. You're not protecting your children and protecting our children. If you suddenly start going on a murder spree because the Barista at Starbucks got coffee order wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       You don't think that I have a right to protect our kids and turn your ass in. First of all, I just got upset with somebody else. They ain't going to sit with my family. So I don't see how the two are connected. Okay. Because it's something and I need your help and you're like, no, I'm going to leave you behind. Yeah, you're right. Gosh, I am just a terrible life. Well, that's the consensus for sure. I told you I would help you bury the body in cases of manslaughter. Involuntary, right? Yeah, but not premeditated. Only if it's to protect our family and if you, if we're hurting like a child molester or a rapist and I take joy helping the listeners a reality. Okay. They don't have, they don't have to children to protect the listeners. A lot of comments and messages, but we also got a bunch of emails. I'll read some of them right now. Please let me get this kind of be, look, here's the first email. Tom's wrong. If someone harms family, I'm all for events, otherwise runaway and called the cops.

Speaker 1:          00:07:06       Uh, is that what, okay. Just this coincidental that they mentioned that. Huh? Sidebar. This is what they mentioned. Hello. Tommy jeans and Mommy, Christine, my wife and I were listening to last week's episode and the question of loyalty was brought up between your marriage. Would you wrap me out if I killed someone? I expected my wife to carry the same piece of shit feelings as Christine but was done when she said that Tommy is 100% right. Sounds like Christine's genes can only become a certain amount of high and tight before she's the one that, that uh, the very valid she promised. Uh, it looks to me that Tommy is not only the water champ, but the marriage champ as well. Way To really fucked that one up. Christine. Todd is the psycho champ is what he is. More messages. Hey Man, Richard Kuklinski Aka the ice man. Earns a well deserved reputation as a cold blooded killer, but manages to keep his violent professionals secret from his wife and children for years.

Fuck you rock. That's my favorite email that's ever convert. These are all slightly weighted towards your, when you read the emails, they're all in supportive view. Let's just put it that way. I just, I put this together and I just see what kind of wife and mother would I be if I didn't protect our children from a psychotic believe the term is half assed.

Speaker 5:          00:08:33       Wow. Wow. Wow.

So it's that. You actually fart in my face. Could you imagine having this job? This guy's job? Yeah. You're going to be a reporter. We're going to send you out to the Jack in the box and you're going to let this chick fart in your face in the parking lot. This has gotta be just a joke set up for, for the new facility. Oh, you're right. This is like one of those porno. Yeah. Set up all this stuff better than me. He's a real journalist. Oh, I thought he was visiting America. I met a nice lady and she's like, I faced [inaudible]. He's like, what is this all about? It's how far and the far comes in. The next thing. He's like, you said it's harder here. Monday legs. She's like, yeah, show me. It's a little gooey. Stuff comes out. Do you think

Speaker 4:          00:12:25       she does? Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. He is. Huh? He's very, he's very dangerous. These because they see that we are in war. Huh? Oh my gosh. Eh. Deletions 40 aura. Your characteristic or your beauty this because you are a very, very beautiful girl. Butter

Speaker 1:          00:12:50       man. Do you think her dad, hey, here's a scenario what your dad's looking, I should try it. Your Dad's looking to jerk one day and he's searching for the porn he likes. Yeah. And you know how all the other subjects come up. All the other types. Yeah. Yeah. Is Your Dad and then like come to Christ and it's his little girl. How many times do you think that happens? Happens all the time. Yeah, but if you're, if you're the dad of, of the metro mistress at [inaudible], you're like, yeah, she's dropping farts. I mean it's, I, it's probably a different feeling than if you see your daughter in a blow. Bang. Do you think that's the worst thing to see your daughter do and porn? Let's, let's, no, probably it's double or triple anal is probably the worst. That's what, no, but blow bang. Maybe Blow Bang, wait, what's a blow?

Speaker 1:          00:13:37       Bang again? Like blow jobs. Yeah. But like it's, it's when there's like eight guys standing around her and she's like, like looking up. She then the shows I [inaudible] she loves it. I love it. I love it. How much do you think, how much do you get paid for the Blow Bang? Because the agents got to call her and be like, all right, I got you a gay. Normally here's the thing, I'm going to hook you up normally. You know how you get like 500 bucks for a blowjob? Yeah. Well I got you 800 bucks for 10 blowjobs actually for more it's less. Right. But if you stay long a dollar and you blow everybody there, yeah. You get $400. Yeah. Okay. Cause we're paying for your travel. Yeah. Free lunch. Free lunch and yeah, whatever. Whatever you want to eat after. I can't, I can't imagine.

Speaker 1:          00:14:27       I'm trying to think of what I would personally consider a way worser. Is it the blow bang, wait, wait, is it, what is worse to see your child doing? Hi. Yay. Ooh. Fufu cause see something about like five dicks over the face and just on the face seems really kind of degrading. Right? Seams, seams. I'm talking pure optics. So, uh, but then again, if you know, if there's two dicks in her ass, you're like, I fucked up. I didn't do anything. I did, I did things wrong. Right. So you're saying to me what you're asking essentially is what's worst parenting? What's the result of worst parenting, multiple decks in your mouth or multiple dicks in your butthole and virgin? I think, I think I'm going to go with the double penetration. I do think there's nothing worse. I imagine that seeing it then, I think it's the most challenging of the things to doing something away from your face.

Speaker 1:          00:15:24       For some reason it feels like these guys, they did something to your body, but there's almost like a, they did it to you and it's not, it's not on you, but the blowjob is a voluntary act. You can just lay there and take, I'd be like, it was terrible. But if you're like and she and she's going from one to the next around the circle, you know, oof. And then every guys are hold on and then she has to like let it go on and then then do the big smile. That's the worst part is that she's got to act like she's like, how was today? It's so much fun.

Speaker 1:          00:16:14       I was awesome. I was really the top, she has to pretend like it was a little, oh my God, you guys are so disgusting. Her life was as second all those guys off. Okay, so here's the thing now speaking of, I would rather do the fart face. I would do face farts all day over any of the other stuff in porn. If I had to pick a lane. I don't understand. He knows what it is. Definitely. I am very excited about, he ain't too dumb for face farts now speaking of too dumb to come a lot. That's also been very popular. Big, big issue on our show and we got this message. I think I found the right photo for the not too dumb to come shirts. Cool. Hope you find this useful, your ride or die, Chris rude. There it is. And there's forest and he's got his eyes closed. It looks like he's choosing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There you go. He's playing ping pong. Good job forest. Yeah. He's even got a dumb haircut. You know, I was just thinking that dumb, that hairpin persons cut. There's a certain look. What kind of luck? Well done. People have a certain look sometimes, I'm sure. Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure. Talk strictly hair if gt kind of an honor.

Speaker 1:          00:17:42       No, I got some bad submissions for FTT RTD. Yeah. People were like doing things like, oh, it's FTD RGT. I'm like, Dude, look at, look at the letters first before you submit. Um, so, oh, where's that one? I wanted to pull up this to you. God, I hate it for kids to porn, but for Simon, it's just as bad if your son does it. Then if you're a little girl as it, right. So do you remember our, doesn't even answer me. Sorry. Say it again. What's the way worser? What? Your son doing porn or your girl doing porn? Well, everybody always assumes that it means that you go, oh, it's worse than my daughter is doing porn, but I don't think, I think it's kind of jokey to be like, I'm really thrilled that my son's doing foreign. I don't think that really happened. I don't think a parent of a of a guy is stuffy.

Speaker 1:          00:18:38       Like, dude, it's great. Like my kid fucks a lot. Like I don't think that conversation really happened. There are more of a commodity in this business because they're so rare. Yeah. Guy That can do that on command is, it's a talent. It's a talent, but I still don't think the parents are like, it's really great. Where is our kid fell into that he didn't know how he can get hard all the time and now he gets to show Pete come on command. That's a bigger towns a lot and he comes down and eat them too. And just bigger town than that guy that's claps and slaps is actually, it is a bigger town. Kind of should be a little more celebrated, but I think it makes for a lot of probably conversations that, you know, I think there's a lot of parents in that, in that position that probably go like, ah, he's a, he paints, he's taking pictures, performance artist in La. Yeah, no, he's done some acting, but he really, he, he actually had making furniture and he loves it. They're doing stuff like that. Yeah. They're not like, he's rock hard when you need them to be. Yeah. I wonder if Rocco's a Friday's parents, were they proud of him? Um, well, didn't his dad die? His mother died when he was younger. I know his dad died when he was younger and the mother was alive and then when his mom died, he went over to his mom's best friend's house and put his dick in her mouth and came immediately and ran away in shame.

Speaker 1:          00:20:03       Yeah. Yeah. Just what anybody does when they're grieving grieves differently. When his mom saw him masturbating when he was a child, she winked at him and smiled. Oh Wow. That kind of, and he was like, this is great. This is a good thing on the right path here. Yeah. Is that what your mom did when she found you? Nope. No, my parents really were so fucking weird about sex. They kind of aren't they? Yes. I think looking back you go, you know, when you try to like analyze your parents, you realize they're just people. You know, there's just people out there and in most cases people are doing the best they can in most cases. I don't know. I mean, you know, most people's parents are doing the best they can be. People are neglectful and shitty. I'm trying to say that's the best thing.

Speaker 1:          00:20:50       Yeah. But I'm saying like in my parents' guys, they're not neglectful and shitty. We're doing the best they can. But I think that there was, you know, they were so uncomfortable with just, I think my dad would have been a little different about it if he hadn't been with my mom who was much more so an old school, Catholic Catholicism. And it sets South American breed of it where it's, it's a, it's kind of heightened. I mean she did boarding school with the nuns, you know, it's like, I'll tell you and listen, I wasn't raised religious. My parents were communists. They weren't coming for their raised in Communist countries. Yeah. So when we came to the states were Catholic by tradition, but not by practice. I didn't get weird about sex until I went to Catholic high school. Middle of the Catholics will do elementary school. I don't think I stopped feeling guilty about it until I got married.

Speaker 1:          00:21:42       I mean, and that's like not even from my home, not just from school, like stuff that I picked up, dude. My parents were like, if my mom saw like a woman in a bikini and she's like, are you watching pornography? Seriously? So I'll be like, oh my God. Like I thought just a woman's body. You shouldn't be, but it shouldn't be like, that's nice. You know, it's changed. It's changed in ladder. Like, you know, like as we become adults, it's not as weird. But when we were kids, oh my God. But no gotta feed. Everything's poor. No, like a woman's legs, Porno. I remember asking my dad, I mean, think about it now. It's also just a change in culture, like the way people talk to their kids now, you know, but I asked him if he masturbated when I was a a kid cause I was sorry, I'm not sure.

Speaker 1:          00:22:28       And he goes, no, I go, did you ever masturbate? He goes one time, like a one time, cause you had when I was 16 and I go, what happened is like that's it. So I just went in my room like, fuck yeah, you're the Weirdo. You feel like a real weirdo now. That's the kind of stuff I'm talking about where you were like, what the fuck man, it's not good. It's not good for kids. And then I tried to bring it up again. I told you that right where I came out of the shower and I didn't know how to talk. I was like 10, like, uh, um, uh, so can I talk to you? He was like, yeah. And you know, you could tell it when it's hard for a kid to say something. I was taking a shower. I remember this like it was yesterday.

Speaker 1:          00:23:03       I was taking a shower and um, I was washing, you know, my privates and um, uh, all this stuff came out and then he goes, next time, don't wash there so long. I was like, all right. That was it. And that was, that was the conference. I was like, I'm trying to talk to you about this and not feel weird about it. And he was like, yeah, you don't want to do that. Just watch what's on TV. Let's watch the football game. But that's the hangup about sex. And I have to say after having two babies, you really realize that it's just a part of the bigger picture of human reproduction. It's really not, you know, my, my boobs are food for somebody right now. My badge was a portal of, for some, for two people to come into this planet like you, the, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:23:55       It's not, it's no mystery and your sex and sexuality, it's like, what the fuck? I would have a whole different psyche about this. If I was raised differently, I probably wouldn't find sex stuff is funny as I, because it's so taboo, so taboo deep like it's in my brain's DNA that has, you know, well, cause I had the opposite. My parents were oversexed and it was so open all the time. We talked about sex, you know, my mother wanted to teach me and I was reading books about it when I was like in third grade and she would show me her edible underwear and her discussing sex toys and stuff. Like it was almost too much for me. It was over stimulation to our ninth. Now I'm totally not, I don't care. I'm like, oh well that's a body they fuck. Yeah. But I wonder where we both got our love of poop stuff from.

Speaker 1:          00:24:40       That's a difference to, well, my dad champion that. That's true. Yeah. My Dad's a big pen. I can't tell you like I didn't think it was, I wasn't like, this is awesome. But I did react. I loved more upset my mom. Yeah, that's, that was the, that was more the draw of it to me was that he was, he would be like, take a shit. He'd be like, yeah, he'd get all excited and I'd be like, yeah, I took it. I wouldn't be like, as excited as he was, but then she will be so upset. I was like, this is pretty good stuff cause it makes mom mad. Makes my med. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That makes my man I wanted to do talked about shitting a lot in my house. It was just constant. Every you just want to take a shit. You talked about it after.

Speaker 1:          00:25:18       Yeah. No, he, he 100% every day. Yeah. It's still how's, you can take a shit that was good shit. Yeah. I got to tell you, tell you ahead. Kind of, kind of sloppy, sloppy Joe every day. My mother liked poop stuff and it was actually my mom. That's hilarious. Yeah, she loved it. She's always, she, my mother had kind of what you would consider a low brow sense of humor and surprise. And she liked like they call it like a [inaudible] tumor and Hungarian, like a farmer. And I think that's totally where I get it from. And my dad too, like Cheech and Chong and Eddie Murphy and you know, we're not highfalutin folks over at the budget skis were no, definitely fucking dirt dogs. Speaking of this topic, do you want to, we actually had our question answered about queef versus fart debate. There's no I've answered no, no.

Speaker 1:          00:26:11       The debate, the debate was answered by a doctor for us. Oh, it's your life. So a doctor or the cock doc reiterate. What's the question again? If, um, the question was, I think you pose the question, you said, is it a Queef if it comes from your ass or is it definitely from, but sex? Yeah. So we're like, is it if there's, if there's, if there's air pushed in during anal sex when it escapes, is that a farm x scapes, x scapes? Is that a fart? And I thought it was not, and I think you said, well look, it's a butthole. So when anything, any air comes out, it's a fart is says, well or it's definitely not a queef. Queef comes from the machine. I get what you're saying. So let's do what the doctor says. Another category. This is a practicing urologist. I can't believe, I can't believe doctors listen to this show.

Speaker 1:          00:27:04       And this guy has messaged me and, and uh, and I've, I've messaged, we've sent messages to each other and he's a real doctor. Um, allow me to settle your queef versus fart debate definitively. This comes down to definition though. You might be right Jane. Okay. Queef is a vaginal expulsion of air your email or was raising the question of whether or not it matters what the origin of source of said air is. But the answer is that it doesn't matter. And here's why. Sex is not the only source of queefs. And not all queefs are expulsions of air that has been forced inside. For examples. There are diseases that can result in the formulation in the formation of a Fistula, which is an abnormal connection between two hollow organs. A Colo vaginal fistula is an abnormal connection between the colon and the vagina. This can result in gas from the colon being expelled through the vagina.

Speaker 1:          00:27:59       That's crazy. Even though the gas is a byproduct of regular digestion, since it's expelled via the vagina, it's technically a queef air coming out of the vagina. Likewise, air forced into the rectum during anal intercourse that subsequently expelled is a fart because farting is the expulsion of air through the anus regardless of its source of origin. Sorry, Tom. Christina is right by the way. Huge congrats to Christina for creeping out that baby. Also, please add some tampon Florida dates so we can come out and see you guys. Uh, this is the, keep those jeans high and tight. Dr Pecker checkers, MD. Um, he really is, I swear to some guy in Florida, I promise you. I promise you. Um, while we're on the subject, your farts and either way in two parts, do farts pushed the shit out or do Brown's push the farts out?

Speaker 1:          00:28:53       The answer is that it's both. There's only so much space and split test. Everything has propelled all together by the muscle action. It's possible that Eric and filter around the browns, but the browns and farts are both pushed along a by what? Paris. Dallas and those traveled together. Teamwork makes the dream work. People, this guy sent me photos from his practice of stuff that would just make your eyes water. Shall we see them? Can we see that? We could see them? I don't know if I should. I mean you can't. I'm sure you can't bro. I guess we could under the like, hey, we're studying medicine here, but okay. I mean, we're talking like disease Dick. Dick. Really? Yeah. Okay. Well let me set it up. Maybe I'll set it up for when our, sure. Maybe we could show our guests. Um, what a neat idea.

Speaker 1:          00:29:39       I can't believe it so far. It's the shit out. Oh, this is felony shit poses a farts out too. You're not even going to marvel at this revelation. It's absolutely fantastic. Thank you doctor Cock Doc. I'm just saying that from my whole life. I thought farts push the shit out. And then doctor drew came by and he said it was, what'd he say? Neither? Yeah. He was like, oh fun. I know they happen there, Eric, irrespective of one another and now this guy saying it's both. So it's like blowing my mind. It's like when you find out that light is both wave and particle, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, no, I know what you're saying. Pretty exciting stuff. Well, I guess I did think that she has pushed the farts out. You know, I thought the farts push the shit out. My thought, my mom was right about that because she would always love for those who don't know, my mother would say whenever I, whenever I'd Fart and I'd be like, Oh guy for it.

Speaker 1:          00:30:31       And she'd be like, be grateful for the farts because farts Bush this shit out without the force. There is no shit. Wow. Yeah. In a way. And she's right. Um, our guest is here. Should we go get them? Yeah. Yeah. And there's some really important stuff I want to get to. I mean, I'm serious. Really important. No, this is good stuff. Like really important. Yeah. Okay. All right. All right. We'll be right back Jean or back. We're doing a little mic tracking. Okay. Yeah. Where he sound different there Tom. That's, thank you. That's the guy that can't stop coming. That's, he comes at his dad's funeral a hundred times back in the news. No, you would not believe the sophos that was prepping today. And what happened was our producer thought we were recording tomorrow. Yeah. So usually sends me a folder of all these files of things to play. So he messaged me, he's like, I fucked up. I'm sorry. So I'm like pulling stuff on my own and it's not the same cause it's like, you know, it's usually organized and I just hit a button and it plays. So I'm going through emails and I see this thing about this. This is probably like the episode that I would say at least early on, best to find our shows them. Yes. We did a huge segment on this guy.

Speaker 6:          00:31:40       When you're on your knees at your father's funeral, at his casket, you were saying goodbye to him. And then we have nine orgasms right there by your whole family is standing behind. You never want to have another orgasm as long as you live. Why not just keep on com.

Speaker 1:          00:32:02       And it was like a documentary like thing they did on this guy who has this condition where he just comes all day, every day and it's ruined his life. But he orgasm, he did. He doesn't come. Doesn't come right every time. No, but it's the ability, he's like, can't go to like my kid's soccer games on the side, but you know like I'm like go. And then he's like, you just orgasm and he's got erections all the time and he feels it was horrible cause he's like, I feel bad being around my kids cause I'll just start orgasmic as I'm looking at my kids and, and he's like, you know, I can't, I can't, I feel like an asshole if I'm ordering dinner. And I come and like I'm just nothing. But what's the name of

Speaker 7:          00:32:39       the condition? Oh man, it's probably in this thing, multiple orgasms syndrome or something that's too clean. That's gotta be, it's gotta be a funnier one for persistent genital arousal disorder. That's right. Oh, pst. Yeah. I just remember that. I talked about it in my last person. Persistent genital arousal disorder. Yeah. Yeah. So there are, they're a wealth of people like this on the amount of wealth, but there are certainly, I mean there's definitely more than one. It's, it's, um, and they've had, you know, there was one last year, it was in the news, this woman was hospitalized and she was like, she just keeps like, you know what, this guys, he was so sad, which made it so funny cause you could tell offering was at his father's funeral. It's just coming. It's just like, that's what dad would have wanted. That's what dad would've wanted.

Speaker 7:          00:33:25       I just had nine rather powerful orgasmic sensations to my entire body. So names row, he would have shit like your parents' funeral. So you want to hear the big news? Could I imagine? I'm planning on it. Here's the big news. Okay. This guy was profiled on our, we were obsessed with this guy. This is a few, I mean a number of years ago haven't really, I had to go back through these drops to find them. It's like it's in the first like 100 audio things we pulled, you know, so it's like, it's back in the day. Okay. Here's why he's back in the news. Oh, he tran. Oh, nice. No, it's like he's following our show.

Speaker 7:          00:34:11       Wow. Yup. Well what that is is he wants to feel what it's like to come as a woman. This guy coming is only so fun now. She only climax is eight times daily, so I guess that knocked it down a notch. Maybe that's, I don't know if that's part of the reason. Maybe it is. How could it not Scott? He was like, I'm tired of common transition. He looks tired. He looks like he's just drained. I got to say when he was a man, that's a bad haircut, but can I tell you I love that guys. Hair cut. I think that's such a fun guy. Yeah. The bangs are always bad. We were just talking about dumb haircuts. Like it just, you look dumb. It's the same hair over there for us. Better as a woman. I've definitely fucked that chick. Yeah, I fucked that chick.

Speaker 7:          00:34:58       Yeah. Many years ago in a bar or someone, a dark bar somewhere, but then not having the testosterone not down the orgasm number to only 8%. Only eight a day. You know, how much, how much coming that is so come so much company doesn't come anymore. Like just, I mean maybe, let's see. I need more information. The transgender mother of two hit headlines. Having the hunter orgasms a day. Uh, here, look, look, I nailed it. Persistent general arousal system. Okay. Uh, Christine Decker, two rivers, Wisconsin ultra rare condition. Um, an accident triggered the illness. What's her name now? Christine. Christine. Christine Rivers. If you're out in Albion, Madison, Wisconsin. Come on up. Comedy on stage. Oh, it's a great club.

Speaker 7:          00:36:16       So wait, when he walks, if he comes, he has to like brace himself. Well, sometimes it just, it just, it just floors. By the way, you know, said that I've never had an orgasm. That good outcomes are just fine. Everything's fine. Yeah. All right. And they're unprompted. Like when you're, you wear a diaper, how does he see, he's got to say, you can't just rip through underwear. That's just tear through like he's out of come. You know what I mean? Like he has all gone, all gone. Yeah. There's no more come every time. No, but he gets, he gets the, he gets the feeling. Every time I hear this, this is actually, this is the audio from this moment.

Her wife stuck it out was a real g g we watched an entire series on this called lost in transition about people that have been married for like 15 years, have children. And then the husband is like, guess what? I'm a lady. What is don't. It's really hard to stay together, but the women try. Yeah, the woman, the woman here is sort of a ride or die chick. I would say. I think women, I think women in general assumably try harder if that's the other way around. Dudes are like late later within seconds, look at how forgiving, a lot of times our women are to a man's physical traits.

Speaker 7:          00:37:53       Totally. You've seen these super like these fat piece of Shit. Guys. I've known guys who were like no fat chicks and they're the fattest guys have epic, no teeth demanding. Demanding. Yeah.

Women are like, oh, he's, you know, he's a smart or he's sweet. Yeah. Yeah. And for this guy, he's gotta be a tide bud. Not going to fuck a pig.

She was impressed. He's nice to me. There was a guy last night with a really good looking chick at rite aid trying ice cream. You know how they have the right of the ice cream? Yeah. He's trying all the ice cream. He massive, massive, popular, skinny little tiny girl right next to him. He's just like, uh, give no, give me rocky road. Do you know? He's like trying all of them. And I was like, how does this, how does she get trapped? How does she end up in that situation? It's just low self esteem. Yeah. Coupled with maybe he's got something else off or you don't know what is hog looks like or what his bank account looks like.

Speaker 7:          00:39:12       Yeah. But there's, everyone's got a penis. It's gotta be money because the girl, you can always go get another penis. I'm telling you. But just someone that sometimes those broken, broken wings out there, those girls, if you're just nice to them. I mean that just got to find the damaged one guys. Yeah. Yeah. Tip for the dudes. Get the damage. Those are the ones you can manipulate. Yeah. You can own them. These are healthy girls broken. Yeah. You don't want them if they got their shit together. Right? Yeah. If they're educated and they're really got a good family, that's what a waste of time. Yeah. Look for tiers. That's who you want to. Yeah. Someone that looks like they always were just crying. Yeah. That's what you want just on white. Right. And they're like, I'm all right. And you're like, hey, then swoop in. But those are the girls that settle for the pigs eating ice cream in the writing. That's exactly right. Those are your double anal checks. DVD, A's.

Speaker 1:          00:40:02       Let's talk. Let's ask Andrew by the way. Fantastic comedian, actor Anderson Tino about ride or die. So last week we pose this question and it got a lot of feedback. Okay. Listen carefully. Okay. You're married. Yeah. Um, so I guess should I pose the question as to you or what do you think your wife would do? I'll ask you what you think your wife would do. Okay. So let's say your wife's out and she comes home and she's like, hey baby. And you're like, ah, I got to tell you something. And she was like, what? And you're like, Hey, you know, uh, you know that a FedEx guy. And he always like, he'll just kind of like pull the truck up and his is a mirror, like slap the, the mailbox. She's like, oh, that guy's an asshole. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, today I was across town, I was getting one of my juices and then I saw him in the parking lot and I, I dunno, pissed me, I killed him. But anyways, uh, no one saw it and a, I got the body in the trunk. So, uh, just want to let you know. Do you think she turns you in?

Speaker 7:          00:41:03       No. No Way. Because she's your wife. She's my wife. Yeah. She wouldn't turn me in. She would, she would have, she would first, cause it's me. She'd go, well, you're fucking around. And I go, no dead series. I'd show her the body and then she'd go, well, you've got a plan. Right. And then that's what she would want. Yeah. She wanted to know if I've got some kind of a plan. No, let me, let me be clear here. The motivation for the murder. Yeah. It was just that the guys w w uh, side view mirror dinged our mailbox. Like, can I tell you something at him off? Stop hitting my fucking mailbox. Yeah. Here. Talked to him about it and see, and we've already gone over this. Stop hitting the male parent and, and you saw you kill him and then your wife, your children.

Speaker 7:          00:41:40       No, no kids. Okay. But Christina, right there she is. She, that's her. That's her immediate response. Herniate. Ricky's been snitching. She's the fact that he would just willy nilly kill people. Kill me and on our children. That's why you have to put no, no, no. That's right. No, no, no. If I'm that kind of ans listen, wait, if I'm that kind of unstable guy that kills someone, went over nothing, then you better do the right thing and help me out because I will fucking kill you. That's what I'm saying. I'm saying if my wife was like, we need to tell someone, I'd be like, that's it. You're dead. You're fucking dead to you and Fedex guy will be buried together. Si. Si, Si. This thing that I think is nonsense. Right? How pissed I am at the Barista. Yeah. Yeah. It might be. I might be a hot head about it, but that's why I'm pissed that she's like, well, how do I know you're not gonna turn around and kill our children?

Speaker 7:          00:42:30       But Andrew just said, if she doesn't help me, I'm going to kill her if you, if you go against me. Yeah. That's my constant fear is me going, Jill's in. Why would you go against me? Why would you then I have to walk on eggshells for the rest of our marriage. So after this, are you joining the US marshals or what's your I've got to protect our kids. Tom, you're psycho. Well that's, but no, that's it though. I would, I would go fund, first of all, I'd have to find a backup wife. Then if you started questioning me, I find a backup life. Who's your second wife of choice? What am I looking for that might not a Dalmatian. What does your dumb dumb. A total bozo. You just like a 21 year old. Barely there. Yeah. And you're more on him back. I'll see you y'all next week.

Speaker 7:          00:43:14       That kind of thing. Give her, give her like a YSL person. She's like, you're the best and you're like, sit in this room for a while. I'll do that. Just give her some snacks or something. Give her a little cash. I'm going to give her, give her a buyer a, not an iPhone, but like the iPod that looks like the iPhone, but just tell her it's an iPhone, you know, just, she's like, it doesn't get it. The service will get connected soon. Don't worry about it. Okay, I see that. I love that girl Labia. I love you too. She's got some really young name that they don't, you know, I'm writing a book about river jobs and how you can blow jobs, but that's what that girl does. She does their time. Not Hands Watch Daddy. Oh my God. Totally. Yeah. They call you and they call you daddy.

Speaker 7:          00:43:56       They have to. That's just a rule. That's automation wife. She's just, uh, she's barely, they're being called Daddy's pass. No thanks. Hard task poppy. And I've had it, I've had it done once before telling them out from him. What do you think for me for fucking three HD graduate from a total fucking gutter slot. But poppies, poppies hot. If it's coming from a Latino woman. Yeah, but was it a Latino pig? Who Was it? Just some fucking Maria Jody sludge chaser Jodie. So pig course. Anyway, but it's okay if it's from, if it's a white girl that calls me Papi, that's what are we doing? What are you doing? Yeah. So you're saying that, okay, so you, you think your wife should be ride or die with you at the core? She's gotta be first degree. Okay. Let me tell you, let's flip it. If my wife is like, Hey, you know that bitch from the office that I fight with for the last fucking three years, I'd have to ask you what your answer is. I slit her throat. I'm like, gangster, where are we burying this bitch? You'd be like, yeah, dude, you want to drain it? And then I'm thinking about camping. I'm like, where can we put it? How far away can we get and where am I going? I gotta get the temperpedic. Yeah, you came home and you're like, I murdered someone. I'd be like, what are we doing? How are we going to do God? I would take so much pride in coming up with a cover story on me in the least bit concerned about my [inaudible].

Speaker 7:          00:45:20       You had a reason even at the time, if it doesn't make sense now, it made sense then. Now we've got to, you got to support. Female killers are way fewer and far between. True man killer. So I'd probably be pretty crazy. I mean, if you start looking at me real psychotic, okay, it's a little different, but I fucking kill you. Then I just want you to down afraid of me stabbing you in your sleep. Not unless you're taking it to a thing where you're like, like rocking back and forth, you know, licking knives. I'd be like, all right, something's rough with her, but if you just told me a story, you're like, I got real pissed off. I did this crazy thing. Yeah, I would totally be like, yeah, I'm with you. How do you know it's a onetime thing? That's my problem with you and I know you.

Speaker 7:          00:45:57       You're very impulsive and, and once you get a taste for killing, it's not going to stop. Okay. But you crossed that line. We're not talking about brownies, right? We're talking about, but once you cross that light, that's the one line. You're not supposed to Christ once you do and it feels so good. I know you're going to like, it feels so good. I know you, you're going to like the three probably does feel really good to take somebody's life. I also think it's probably, I think it's also like, well, I'm the kind of guy who so like meticulous about everything that the cleanup and all that shit. Yeah. That would probably deter me from doing it again. It's just so laborious. So you're like, oh my God, I don't want to fucking bloodhounds paperwork all the shit out now. It's like buying a house. I know.

Speaker 7:          00:46:42       They keep sending you emails. You're like, what is this? What am I signing? I don't want to do this anymore. I don't, I never will cash. I'm giving you cash here and I just take it. Well, the cleanup. Yeah, it has to be. It's to be a thrill to have someone tied up, I imagine. You know what I mean? Like in a base and just the control over them. I kind of get that. Oh my God. It is kind of, and it's kind of cool and it's kind of cool where you walking in the and you just shut the door. Just walk in and stare at him. Don't do anything. And I closed the door again. Just give them little glimpses of you. Help your wife listens to this Andrea. She's going to, she better stay in her cage where she belongs. Great guys. Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:47:24       Moving right along. I just want to see if come daddy has any more fun. Oh Yeah, look. Oh, she's dating somebody. They're cute. They're cute together. Full body shot by the way. I'm surprised. I thought that was going to cut off here, but it's got the golf pants and everything and I will say it doesn't usually work out. It's worked out for her quite nicely. I think she looks great, but that shot right there of debt, frankly arm that looks like literally me. If I put tennis balls, has as tits dead friendly. Armed with that little bit of red hair, that's me. That's me in a tank top. This condition was prompted for Christine when she was a man, uh, and had a back injury. Uh Oh yeah. Way makes sense to the hospital. In the ambulance. She started having orgasms and the next day, according to this article, she had 236 orgasms.

Speaker 7:          00:48:10       Yeah. The constant spasm is leaving her pelvis and agony. It'd be on my knees. All these people would be staring at him. He was humiliating. Jeez man. I've been lying to myself for so long. I knew I was meant to be a woman. Oh, I'm glad all these people are switching. By the way, if all these people that have wanted to switch for so long and now that society is like, do it, I'm like, go for it, man. Whatever. Yeah. I think it's good to, people want to switch, go for it. Whatever you gotta do, there's got gotta be nothing worse than feeling. Then honestly feeling like you're born in the wrong body. That's gotta be the weirdest feeling in the world. Terror feeling in the world is being you feeling like you're in the wrong way. Like a guy that's such a guy. Yeah. You transition is just always gonna look bad. You know what I'm saying? She always tells me that if I were to transition, I'd be the ugliest, ugliest, but you wouldn't be a babe. Yeah, yeah, you'd be, you'd be a solid. Uh, he'd be a big Husky Midwest girl, you know, cause you have broad shoulders, you know? Yeah. So much hair. But you see some of those, some of those guys say they got to be like a seven in Omaha. Yeah. You'd be a babe in Nebraska.

Speaker 7:          00:49:09       Just cutting trees and shit. I'd think I'd be an okay chick. I'd be, I'd be a sluts. I'd be wild. So just fuck Ricky redhead girl. I'd be a freaking red headed girl running around. I also have, my legs are kind of skinny enough where I can send them out. I could send them out and do hot chick legs. You know, here's the thing, by the way, all these guys, big guys, when they start to transit, we were watching that show and this guy who trains it was transitioning. It was like everyone thinks I'm a man and he just decided and, and he was big dude. It's like, dude, why aren't you running every morning? Yeah. I gotta lose the weight. Right. You can't, I mean going to commit, you gotta commit. If you're going to chop off the Wang are you got to commit it dude.

Speaker 7:          00:49:51       She's like, people say things like, I looked like a man. Like you're two 25 yeah, it's a big, big, big broad. Yeah. Stop. Stop benching dude. Come on. Stop lifting at some point. That's why I might switch just so I can stop going to the gym. I might just send out. You work out a lot. I do. Really? Yeah, I do. I've changed working out what I work out now. I just try to swim. I used to just be like, run, lift weights, run, lift weights. Now we just do different things to, cause I just, it's so monotonous, boring. And the people there are so boring. That's true. It's just the whole idea of it is just kind of grow. It grosses me out sometimes when you see people like, you know when you go to a gym, I don't have, I don't go to gym anymore.

Speaker 7:          00:50:29       We, I have one at home, which is great, but when I used to go to a gym and I see the same guy over and over doing the same things and you're like, oh yeah, this is like very like machines, like creepy. Like he's doing the exact same guy. What's up that guy and like, ah, fuck. That's especially weird when you see that guy over the course of time not making any progress. No progress. Yeah. Same Guy. And sometimes you'll hear that same guy complained like I just can't. He's like, you're not doing anything right. Yeah. That's why you're not making any progress. That's even more sad, stuck, really sad is when people post it on Instagram, their workouts, I think there's nothing more fucking boring. I don't want to call out anybody, but there's someone I know that post gym stuff all the time and I'm like, oh, and I really like you, but it bothers me so fucking much.

Speaker 7:          00:51:15       Does it bother you as much as people retweet and compliments or, yeah, that's Fred pretty parallel. It actually bothers me when someone I know comments on the gym photo in a positive reinforcement. Fucking snake. That's so self. So after it dog. Yeah, go get it brother Luke and Greg, Bro. Shut the fuck you phony. That's such a phony. Also the the gym people, the few gym people that I know, that dude that fucking shame, like that's the hardest part is they're not that good at, they're not even that good of shape. That's what bothers me. It's not like jazz when you're like, Whoa, the rack. Yeah, he does his big, big fucking grin, but it's the cocaine's Ma. Oh yeah. Is that how positive that guy really feels? No Way. Cause his smile and he's like, hey, he's like, feel good in my anchor. I'm lifting this morning, shot eight movies yesterday.

Speaker 7:          00:52:10       Shut up fucking films. That's for, I'm almost done with my first workout of the day. And you just see the smile just never fade. And he's like, all right guys, get after it. And you're like, he's 6 million views. There was an article that came out that he suffers from depression that he admitted he has severe depression and you're like, ah, I feel like a jerk. No, no, no, no, no. Because if you spend all this time working this and not your brain, something's wrong. I'm not making fun, but you're Gunna get depressed. Like you're naturally, if all you focused on was one thing all the time, it's like, I know what I think is depressing too. I've thought about this. I think it's naturally depressing. Those guys that get to number one, number one. Totally. I think it's gotta be, it's so much attention and there's so much pressure and I don't think it's a coincidence that all the number one's workout like lunatics. I think it's like, I think it's actually kind of depressing to get to get to that level. Do you think number one's always self sabotage or do you think that's just a pattern of it? No, I don't think they all self sabotage. I think there's just so much pressure to maintain it and there's a natural ebb and flow. Like you look at someone like Tom Cruise, he was the number one of number ones for a huge stretch. Then like obviously it's weird, personal stuff happens. It's all public, right? It's like these Scientology theoretical,

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       crazy jumping. I love this woman, all that shit. He puts it back together and, but he also is known for having like, I mean there's no kind of an odd point of view personality and it's all tied to staying in that top slot I think. Right. I get obsessed with being up top posts and I won't say who, but

Speaker 7:          00:53:48       people I follow, they're like number one, just grinding. That's all I know how to do grinding work and it's like, dude, what's you, what's your life about? That's it. That's all you're going to do. You are readily a multimillionaire and just take a break. I like reading that one. I'm not doing anything that day. That's my favorite shit. And you're like, I'm winning today. I didn't do shit. I feel fantastic. I don't know who said that. I think norm was talking about that. That's on something when he was like, yeah, sometimes my day is so consumed with getting a meal and a concern for the next meal than my whole day is just going to get food, having it, doing it than going to get new food and the day is over. And I did a whole day. I was like, as like I've had those days. Yeah. And then when I see people doing the thing bragging and I'm like, I feel good that I didn't do shit. I also think

Speaker 1:          00:54:35       that some of the, the grinding braggers, they're really, they, they're doing that for themselves. Oh, totally. Not just as a, um, as a show off. I think they need it. They need to do it to keep going because without the act of documenting it and showing and getting the reinforcement something, they lose something. So they need to go check out how hard I'm working and tell me how proud you are of me for how hard I'm working.

Speaker 7:          00:55:00       Well, I think there's two kinds of people though that like some people like when they get accolades, they have to tell you. Yeah, and some people are, I'm embarrassed of telling you. Do you know what I mean? Some people are so scared to let you know that sometimes when you find out something about a friend and you're like, I didn't know you. I didn't know you did that. And they're like, oh yeah. And they're kind of embarrassed about it. But then I have so many of the other friends, I have someone that will call me. I wish I could say his fucking name. He will call me and tell me of great thing. That's just that he's just acquired or achieved or whatever. We all know, Bert, what am I going to say? What am I like? I don't know what you expect the response to be awesome, right?

Speaker 7:          00:55:37       I think I like to brag online only like I like the online bragging is because it's there. If you want to see it gone gray. No. Uh, but you know what I just realized it makes me so annoyed about the workout braggers is that you're supposed to work out diff shit. I took a shower today. Hey, I'm fucking shower to brush my teeth. I took a shit like, no, dude, you're supposed to do that stuff to maintain your life. There's no reason to brag about or we're also all first. The grind always supposed to be, we should be grinding. They're acting like they work hard to maintain their life. You work hard, but that's, you know what the irony is the people that are like grinding the hardest. Like imagine the rock band, like on the grind. Just had my personal chef cook, my personal breakfast and my personal gym with meanwhile a dude is like, I'm on the grind, I'm on my fourth job today. I'm tired. I have six kids. I make 40 grand a year and the rocks, like I can't tell you how much that respect you.

Speaker 7:          00:56:37       Big Ass smile is so true, Andrew. It's like the guy that delivers my Amazon package. He's fucking grinding. By the way. If that is bragging on the Granby and like fucking on the guide, I'd be like respect dude. For sure. We need more of those grinders and those guys don't want, they don't, this is what they're going to ditch. Phoenix 115 shovel in the air grinder grinding. That's the real, that's for sure. Those people won't brag. That's because they're the false narrative of cool guys. Uh, do what the rock does. Then they feel like I got to get up to that to do the and watch an insane document. Viceland put out a piece about these people in Miami who rent exotic cars. I started walking. I got like halfway through. I don't want to spoil it for the fucking creepy cause I saw the text on screen. That was like quarter of the way in where they go. Sure, sure. I'm sorry. I was just drinking water. I'm a champion.

Speaker 7:          00:57:33       They're already saying, they're like, we could, we were not able to verify any of the claims, get this guy. And I'm like, that's not a normal thing to put up on screen. Like they're obviously prompting you to pay attention to this. Yes. And then they show him like doing coke and like, yeah, his friends where he's grinding. He said yes to doing coke on camera, like an ro one. I am about to hit this town and then I didn't get through it. I mean not, I want to see the rest of it. The basis of it is it to tie into what we're saying is like, it's this fake, like we're all winning, we're all rich. And he basically is saying how sad it makes him that he's got to keep up appearances because he can't, he literally can't. And he's like doing everything he can to do anything he can to lie, cheat, steal, do whatever he can look just to look like it's just a fake it. That's what's even more, do you know, do they cover this? I was trying to figure this out. So this, this piece is all about how, especially in Miami, the exotic car rental business is.

Speaker 7:          00:58:34       I am. No, without a doubt. I mean they're going to peak a Kansas. Even the guy who's like, he's like, if you come and you don't run a hot car, your piece of shit drive that narrative. So everyone's like, okay, and it's all crazy expensive card. We're talking like entry level 250 grand for these cars, Rambo all the way, most Ferrari's Rolls Royce, you know, Nutley's nothing, nothing. Just regular luxury Uber, same luxury car, like a s five 50 Mercedes. They like get the fuck out of here with that shit. But anyways, I'm seeing this and watching and you're like, okay, people will rent these cars, do those businesses acquire all that? That'd be way too much capital, right to be with buying. So it doesn't talk about it on there. But of course our brains, right. In the same, I started doing research cause I was like, there's no way have enough capital to buy 15 Lambros right, right.

Speaker 7:          00:59:24       And so there I found a few other articles so you can look it up about people that get these, um, the subsidies from major high if they're reputable from high end companies to like Lee lease and sublease from them. And that's how they do. That's how they, but they pay it, but they pay a super premium on the, on the leisure to be able to supply rented one as a prank on Bert like a year ago where I, you know, and he was like, you bought this. And I was talking to the people that rented it to me about this. I was like, cause they were cool and they were like, oh they, they follow like comedy. And they were like, you know, he's had in the car. I go, so you buy all these cars? And they were like, ah, yeah, like kind of like dodging around it.

Speaker 7:          01:00:07       I'm just curious, I'm not trying to get into the business with you. I'm just asking you. And they were like, yeah, these are all our cars. Like it wasn't like they didn't were forthcoming with how they actually are able to do. I think there's a million little sneaky holes. Like there's one on sunset. Um, there's one like right on sunset next to a bar. And one time I talked to the guy cause there's like three cars in the showroom. I was like, coming to you have, he's like as many as we need. I was like, no, that means you don't have shit, but you're able to find them somehow. I think they go find real owners or find, you know, companies that collect or whatever and they pay them a premium over what they're going to lease it for. It's just, it's got to make sure it's a shady business.

Speaker 7:          01:00:44       It's a crazy business. Tom, when you rented the Lambo, did you put your car insurance or did they go to jail for that? I take, there's what? I rent cars on the road. I'm like, my insurance is great. What did it cost to rent the Lambo? A G I, it was like a thousand, something like that. It was for a day. You know, it's expensive, but I go, you're not doing enough business to, you know, to pay off these kinds of car and make a profit. There's no way, man. No. They'd have to be literally conflict the second you bring it back. Every someone's, they're waiting and they have, they're busy moments and everything here in la too, you know, people, you always see those high end cars, Beverly hills and sometimes it's an owner of a car, but lot of times it's these exotic sunset strip stuff.

Speaker 7:          01:01:23       You know, it's all rentals, rentals, people from out of town. Although I was, I met this guy who was a liaison, you know these guys in La that don't do real jobs that you're like, but they get paid good money and you're like, well how did you get there? He's a liaison to this rich family from Dubai and he basically is there everything, go get it, go do it. You know what I mean? Like the, the ultimate gopher, he does literally everything for them. And he's like, oh yeah, they constantly rent cars. They won't just buy a car. He's like, so they'll rent a Bentley for like two months and then give it back and then they'll rent, you know, Ferrari for a month and then give it back in a Rolls Royce. I was like, what? That's, they just don't feel like buying. He's like, no, they just don't want to have anything acquired.

Speaker 7:          01:02:01       They just want to like get it, give it back. Like everything is at least everything is to rent. There's people like that that I think come to la that spend absurd amounts of money on shit like that, and those companies must make a ton of them, but they don't care because there's so much. They're like, no, I just want to give it back. My cousin came here to hear that. Well, they wouldn't you like, oh yeah, if I was that. Well there is that kind of money in La. You see, you see it, you're like, there's not, there's really rich people living in that area that you were talking about. Yeah. Well, no, I'm Beverly. It was at the Beverly Hilton. We were, some cab driver was telling us that these girls come during the summertime at the Beverly Wilshire in Beverly, Wilshire as Arab and like, you know, like Middle Eastern coming and it's like, before I forget what time of year for Ramadan maybe?

Speaker 7:          01:02:48       Or is it, yeah, I think so. Don't respect. Don't disrespect. Ron was a dare. Don't you? Dare, don't you dare. These girls come with like their chaperones and then their fathers and brothers are back home and the other gold country. And then they spend all this money on like Chanel clothes and all these labels where, um, and then leave them behind and you can't work. Oh whoa. It's a back into the country. That's crazy. Where did they, where does it go? Does someone like, they're like, I don't know, throw the trash. You see some, some homeless dude wearing a Chanel dress that's, he looks good. The thing is that the hotel was, we were there to have lunch with someone and we were like, oh, that's right. We were, here we go, uh, what is going on? Because it was so like so busy, but it didn't feel like a normal day.

Speaker 7:          01:03:35       And they're like, oh, I don't remember if he was robbing him. It was some time of the year. They're like, oh, it's blah, blah blah. And uh, this always happens. We'll get like thousand, you know, princes and whatever here and there, like armed security people and they're like, they're just nothing but lambos, Ferraris, Rolls Royce. And then you saw hundreds of shopping bags from all the rodeo drive cause they can't wear them back home cause they have to wear traditional gear or whatever. I don't know what that's called. Yeah. They said like, oh it's just fun. Like they'll buy it and wear it out to dinner. And then there's, there's, there's uh, he dropped the [inaudible] job. Is it? That sounds really nice. But you say with that face, I don't know if there was, I watched, I watched one of these youtube warm holes where people go about them.

Speaker 7:          01:04:19       Don't talk shit. Talk Shit. So if you want to talk some shit cause that wine box video, oh my God. Yes. That's so one of the best. I love that one. Um, oh I watched this video about people that go rent cars in the m and a, what does it in Dubai, in the Emirates or whatever. And they leave them at the airport. Like there's, you can look it up. There's this video, there's like thousands of cars that are like really nice cars because if you don't pay your, um, if you skip payments, it's a prison. Double offense in Dubai. Oh dear. So they'll, what they'll do is they'll drive them to the airport and they'll catch a flight out of the country and, and ghost. Wow. You look, look, look, look it up. It's insane. There's like Ferrari, Ferrari, beemer, Mercedes, because they just didn't make their payment on yeah. Were they just leave the cars? It's like a, it's like a car graveyard at the airport. When my cousin from Peru came here to study English few years ago, he was with, it was all foreign people from all over the world, his class. And he goes, oh, uh, he's like, oh, there's this kid in my class

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       from the UAE. And I go, yeah. He goes, do you know, they just gave him money to come here. And then they just bought him a place and he takes out the whole class, like in, he'll rent limos and like a sprinter vans and is like, let's just go out tonight, pay for everybody. And they're like, what the fuck's going on? You guys the best? And he's like, he's like, I don't worry about it. Like, uh, my government just pays for it. All my government. Yeah. He's like, they just gave you and he's like, he would bring out just like what could, wait, what school is this? This is a, he was studying and they were studying English at USC. Oh, in college. But it was like at a, you know, an adult study. Sure. Do you mean the government? Is this the ual you a, he, he said that this is my cousin told me that if you're a citizen you can go to the government and be like, I want some, I want some shit. And they're like, all right, and then give you money and uh, I want to buy a house. Here's the money for the house. If you go, I want to study anything at any part of the world. It's on them because they go, you're going to bring it back here. So it go study that thing.

Speaker 7:          01:06:16       It's a pretty flat, pretty black system. I want this. Okay. I like it. I love it. We should move the fuck are we doing here? They'd be like, give us the money. We want to leave. We, these could live there. Not me as a little after we murder that Fedex do, we might have to move. That guy keeps hitting the fucking mailbox. What do you want us to do? Yeah. Damn you to the first conversation is really nice. Hey Man, you missed the, you, um, you hit my mailbox. Notice that I've seen it. You hear that, that smack and then he and then his, but he does this to you and this pisses you off. He goes, I don't think I hit it. Aww, I saw. Yeah. Well, okay. Yeah, I'm pretty, I know, man. I didn't, I didn't hit it, but sorry about that many of them.

Speaker 7:          01:06:55       Yeah. All right. Okay. Second day hits it and then you go, hey dude, you were yesterday. You remember how we just, you know, I saw the truck hit a 10. Now. I did see it. I saw it too loud. I think you heard it. And then he says, and sticks out a little too far. If I'm being honest in mirror. No, no, the mailbox, it sticks out too far, so, okay, well maybe you go around it. I can't sit tight turned from the corner. All right. I gotta go do some other deliveries now you start, now you're cooking day three, day three. Now he really gets it. Now Tom's waiting for the guy you're waiting outside for me as they say. And then I say it to you. I go, hey man, smoked it today. Sorry about that. I, I clipped it bad. I clipped.

Speaker 7:          01:07:35       Took that turn fast and I'm a little hung over. I'm also one of your packages that you were supposed to get. It was a big one. Something important. I don't know. Um, it broke at the warehouse so, well, you know. Okay. You figure it out with them. Okay. Yeah. All right. All right man. Have a good day. I'll see you there now. You too. That's it. It's brewing underneath three days of this. He said, then I see him at the juice bar. Yeah. Here I am at the juice bar. I know, and I'm at the juice bar. I know the guy that works there. He's been waiting in line for quite a while. I Walk Right in. I go, Mikey, what up? Boom. He, he's got my juice ready. Yeah. I don't have to pay for it or nothing. He gets up there, wants his juice. I got the last of whatever the juice that he needed it.

Speaker 7:          01:08:13       Oh fuck is what now? I go see a, now I go out the stairs to the back parking lot. It's really like not even a parking lot. It's like trash cans and stuff. Dumpsters and I see Fedex fucking frank. Right? And he's just like, he's, he's like, God damn, this is good. He's like making a scene of it. He's bragging about it. God. It's like, fuck you get the best mango here. Best mango here. Why this shit in? And that's when I go like, Oh hey man, I noticed you fucking parked without hitting anything here, you know? And he's like, yeah, yeah. Oh, did you want this? These are good. He's like, ah, I use throws him, check it out. He goes like this. Oh Shit. Hey look, any hits Tom in the head with the empty one. What do you think happened? Yeah, yeah man. How do you kill him? I mean, I think there's probably like a, a piece of juicing equipment that broke that's in the parking lot. Yeah, there's a grinder type of blade. They kind of half, half broke. I luck out and that when I pick it up if feels like it's actually a handle for yeah. Like it's been made almost. It's made for this and I just, he's just like eat a dick man. Try ups or something like that. And as he does it, I just right behind them.

Speaker 7:          01:09:32       Oh yeah. Cause it's a lot of Blah, a lot of black. It's too much to be honest with you. I probably panic, you know, a good bit at first and then it just hits me that like the parking lot is not a parking lot. Like I, we're both in an area where there's no cars, you know, so I'm like, oh, there's no one's seeing. I look around, there's no cameras. I'm like, Oh man, I just, all right, I gotta I gotta get Outta here. Clothes are covered in blood. Yeah, I dunno. I feel like the way that he hit the ground, most of the blood is like that there is forward and it's going into a drain. You slit the throat from behind. Yeah, but, but look at like this. If you, if someone came like this oof. And his arms here, it went out that way.

Speaker 7:          01:10:13       So he slipped and push, push slit or the main thing I got to figure out is yeah. So I, I backed my car up, I pick him up, I throw them in the trunk. Yup. And then I looked at his truck and I'm like, ah, just leave it here, I guess. You know, I don't think he came here and it's illegally parked. I bet. Yup. What about the tickets? There was a lady with a dog walking by. You're not going to, you saw me do it. Of course. This is a new development. She goes, oh, is it that comedian from Netflix? Todd Todd. Yeah. I'm Todd. I love you. Yeah. Big Fan. Big Fan. You know what though? You know you got to do with her. Yeah. Her throat. Now he just got to hit her with your car. Oh, an accident. Oh no, that is true. You got to hit her with your car and then if she says my name. Yeah, hundred percent yeah. Yeah. She knows. If she knows you, it's just, oh, but the dog, you don't want to kill the dog. You don't want

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       to call it. The dogs are cool, but you definitely got to hit her and you've got to hit her hard. You gotta get her nice and hard. Now you got blood on the grill of the car and then you've got a body in the trunk. Yeah, but you're going to burn all that shit. Are you gonna burn the holes or the whole car or the truck? I'll be, I think, I mean at the truck, first of all. I mean that thing. Yeah, 5,600 pounds or something. I mean, it's come on 40 miles an hour. Even that, it's like, sure. It's over. Yeah, sure. Yeah. I just try to clip her, you know, if anything she lives, there's definitely memory loss. She's probably, you know, talking with her eyes, looking at letters where the computer sure. Hey, yes, one of those. So it was Todd Sikora that hit me.

Speaker 1:          01:11:50       It takes me like 25 minutes to get it out. Um, but I don't know. I then I just bring it home. I, I tell you what's up and I'm like, what are we gonna do with this thing, right? No, now, now that you present the scenario that way, like real talk, I, I might have to help. See, I know. Really. There you go. Here's the thing. Cause like I would actually love you again panic. It'd be like, fuck dude. Like I, what am I, what are we going to do?

He doesn't seem like a foresee, weird, creepy guy. Where does he live? What do you, what kind of digs does he have? He's in, he's just up by Bob Hope Airport.

Speaker 7:          01:14:53       Just by Burbank airport. Yeah. Yeah, like an apartment complex. It's one of those old dude. It's a, it used to be a house now it's a duplex, you know? Yeah. And he's got a, he's actually got the dominant side of the yard, so like the other side's concrete for the driveway, but he's got like a nice little patio with those little string lights that he's got. It's pretty chill if I'm not going to lie. It's kind of cool. He's gotten a cute, cute, tiny little fucking fluffy dog. Absolutely. Super Cute. Yeah. He's not that bad of a dude. I feel like he's getting a weird rap guy who's had a pretty decent job for 40 years. He's always got cash on him. He's got like, he has a cleaning lady. It was places. Nice Pacer. Well treats her well. No teeth. He did not have, I think he just had a lack of teeth. I don't think he had no teeth. I think he was, he was, I think it was, you know, two, three deficient. He's not new to the drug game. I don't know if you know like getting wet and rolling blunts like, yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:15:55       Well it could be double p when you dip a blunt in, in, it's formaldehyde. It's embalming fluid. We've been in the game in the game for a long time. Kill people. We've hid bodies to go way back. Yeah. We've been getting wet for years. I was fucking with me. No, that's real. Getting wet means dipping a blunt in, in embalming fluid for Formaldehyde or PCP. He makes you feel good. Feel really fucking cool dude. We got some nice, good, good. Yeah, so he's had a couple of runs. In fact he used to, before he got this desk job, he was working, he was working at a funeral home. That's how I discovered doing like getting wet regularly. It helps him not thinking about his first wife and those kids that he hasn't seen in a long time. So you do you do you get high like that?

Speaker 7:          01:16:48       You know what's so sad? Must Traction. She, Santa Clarita is not that far. It's not, and he should go up there more often, but he's working on himself a little bit right now. He can't go see those kids in this condition now. And on that child support that he's had to pay over the years. He can't afford dental work. No Way. It's pay the wife and the kids are fixed my teeth. Well at this point a lot of his kids are thinking, you know, do I introduced him to my grandkids? Yeah, he's great. He's great. And they're like, I don't know. I don't think it's ready. You know? But they're, that's the irony of the whole thing is he has a nice little Honda civic that he pumpkin and car to drive up there. But since he's ecofriendly he walks to work because it's only three and a half guys eco friendly yet?

Speaker 7:          01:17:23       No, he, yes, it's three and a half miles from his house to his office. So he doesn't drive enough. So they booted his car. So it's like, you know, one thing he does do Rago I can tell you that it does do wrong. He uses too many of those cars smell. Oh my God. It seems was like 15 of those like, um, it's like a evergreen wintergreen, wintergreen. Yeah. It goes overboard. Too many. Yes. He not only hangs the trees from the rear view, but also on his turning signal. Oh God, man. He puts the clips in the air vents and under the seat. Do you think when you ask him how his day's going that he elaborates? Like when he's at the checkout, at the group pens. If you're cute, there's a lot of woman. If you're a woman, yes. If you're a big booty girl that's looking to get wet, then definitely.

Speaker 7:          01:18:06       Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Got About his day. But if you're a guy, he's quick to brush you off. Yeah. If you're like, hey man, how's it going? He's like, everything's fine. Yeah. He doesn't know if you're a snitch or a po or what's your, you know what I mean? Yeah. He doesn't know your deal, dude. He doesn't know. He's just, you know, who would snitch right away? Prison. Chris Nicha. Although how you presented that scenario to me, you guys and I felt the panic, but you see how that might help them to say panic, but you see how that works because when you empathize with us, you understood where that pain came from. Do you think this has a similar vibe to you? This guy

Speaker 8:          01:18:43       just break my heart. Certainly. I agree. Good man. Merk hard. Good bye.

Speaker 7:          01:18:51       Yup. No teeth, no teeth. No, that's, that's genuinely no teeth. But hey guys, at least he likes, he's educated. He's watching Anderson Cooper. Yeah. Yeah. He's up on current events and I am a fan of full volume. While you're making a video, the camera, this is out there. Yeah. Framing wise. It definitely. Can I tell you something? It hasn't, has no idea. Anderson Cooper's gay and would turn that off if you found out. Oh probably. You know what I mean? He would be in such shock and called him. What? What? What do you mean gay? Like goofy. Like a weird guy. You meet a foo foo stuff. Totally is. No, no idea. I feel like I feel like that, you know how many, how many people like Kevin Spacey coming out, coming out to the world at a very inappropriate time when he also got accused of touching boys.

Speaker 7:          01:19:38       Yeah. So many people in middle America where like he's not gay, gay, no worse. Where are you from originally? Chicago. Oh, okay. Okay. But I know like funny, the epicenter of the Midwest is a city that's like such a diverse create like you don't have any. Yeah. But then like, you know, an hour west or south or two hours south, you're like, oh man, this is different. This is different words. Same in California though. Same thing. Yeah, same thing. Yeah, but, but, but the population of southern people in Southern Illinois, people in Southern Illinois, I remember as a kid going down there, they have southern accents. Oh, that's so weird. And you're like, wow, no one, no, we don't, not in Illinois. We don't have that. But people will have kind of like a 20 minute down South Korea and you're like, what did I know? But they say it like it's the deep south that's, you can, you can run into that in a lot of states. Yeah. They just have southern rural sense. Yeah. It's so weird. It's like you can run into it and like, uh, mid central California. Yeah. That is so strange to me. I don't know how that ended up over there. Really weird to really weird places with creepy names. Like Visalia. Yeah. My style. Yeah. Yeah. The way to San Francisco, right? Yeah. Bakersfield.

Speaker 8:          01:20:46       Oh, Christ. This guy. Straight up sex or play foreplay. Look at his eyebrows. Foreplay. No, it good. Damn man. You know.

Speaker 7:          01:21:00       Agree Dude. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Making more demands. Anything wrong though. He's clean now. This guy's living situation is significantly different. Yeah. What do you see? This guy's pretty unfortunate actually. He's, he has a house. Um, it's a, not really a house anymore, but it's like a, it used to be a nice little piece of property had in Tarzana and when his wife left him, everything left him the need to clean and take care of it and it's overgrown. It's, it's really, really sad. His neighbors have called multiple times to Hoa about him. Do you think he has animals? Multiple. Any cat piss everywhere and he doesn't, he lets them roam past tense. He had animals snip, but then they just die. You know? I think he drops on you when you come over. If he gets you to come over, you have to all do you take in all this shit.

Speaker 7:          01:21:46       He's like, mom, my mom is in the back. Your mom is that. She's real sick. You don't, you don't make much noise. She's real sick. You're like, all right. Yeah. And you're like, what's that noise that by no later. Yes. That kind of thing. And he's like, Shit, don't make you, don't make a fuss. She smoked. So will be here in the morning to change it. Don't, she's in the iron lung, you know, like she'll say she'll be fine here. That his lips are also a kind of a shade of purple. Yeah. To me could indicate the tobacco use or he's close to dying. Could be good. Could be inching his way towards death is about, he's just about a heroine. Wait a minute. Do you mean to tell me? Hold on, hold on. You don't think this guy lives a very, very healthy lifestyle? I feel like I don't, let me see him one more time. Nowhere. Bam. Teeth or in his mouth.

Speaker 8:          01:22:34       I am an on here. You know they get shit. God don't look great. No. Stay with you longer. Yeah. Cheat on. You worked another one. Okay. And won't cheat on you with another guy.

Speaker 7:          01:22:49       Now did he put in the top and the bottom? I'm only spirit. Bottom. Just the bottom. I feel like just the bottoms, right? Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:23:05       What's he watching today?

Speaker 9:          01:23:06       This is a game. I think it was actual high, low game. Full volume. Loud. You can pick up what's going on in the game. It'd be so great if he shot this behind the TV, like just sitting right behind the TV hadn't been even funnier. It's going to say that halfway in the DV, one of my biggest pet peeves is talking to somebody on the phone and like, let's say they don't get within the first few seconds. If you hear the background like that, you're like, hey man, are we going to talk a hang up? Yeah. I mean my dad's still, I'll be like, what's that noise? I'll try to like, yeah. He's like, Oh yeah, I got turned TV and stands up. I gotta find the remote. Turns it off. Hold on, hold on. You know what's interesting, so loud. This fake wooden paneling and the background and these beams. These are like old San Fernando Valley type household. Definitely an old ass. You're right about that. Yeah. Did. We didn't actually show Andrew how we were introduced to this guy. This is actually how he's known to us. It's from this video. Oh, last lady, 10 15 times. I even went Beaumont's wow.

Speaker 7:          01:24:11       Yeah. That's really good. Yup. Do you guys think he's lying? I don't know. I always think it's cool, like when guys brag about how good they are about on sex, I'm like, this is a cool guy. I think he needs us most got, yeah, I feel like I know how to flop. You're like, oh no. Probably guys knowing how to fuck really. Well yeah. If you're like, I think he's got like some form of are you super strong too? Oh, that's good too. Tough guys. Strong mark. When they brag being smart. I don't know. I think I gotta be honest. I think he's right. I think that sounds true. He'll make you gum. Yeah. Do you think that's his pitch when he meets a girl? Yes. That's like he's calm 10 15 times. How much time you got? Like, um, I guess I got time to come.

Speaker 7:          01:24:50       I would love to come 15 times. Okay. Well, but Tom and I were talking about this is that, that's not the, um, the lore for women. No, like make it, you don't want to come 15 times. I don't know. I feel like you're Josh in us. Like that's how a dude would entice another dude. Yeah. That's in the gay community that is letters the same pitch. I'll make you come 10 15 times. Guys are like, heck yeah, let's go to your house right now. What are we doing at this bar? God, it must be amazing. It must be so good. How much fun? How much fun? My neighbor, my old neighbor and the old building, he, he was a pump king. He was the pump king. That's what I called him cause he would fuck all the time. Always Awesome Fun Party. Common common new people coming by.

Speaker 7:          01:25:31       Just in, I'd sit there on my window, just stay Erin wave and sometimes it's some of the new visitors, you know, some of them up like, yeah, fucking good rid. What'd you do tonight? I did a spot. Yeah, I did one spot and I jerked off my, my wife was sleeping in the bedroom and I'm ate some cereal, but I watched you three guys tonight. Yeah, I saw crazy. Yeah. Sometimes he would. Sometimes he would fuck on the living room and I had a, he'd leave the blinds open a little bit. I wouldn't watch from for long. Maybe two or three nuts.

Speaker 7:          01:25:58       We got an email from somebody said last night my wife and I decided to partake in marital love. I had finished my part of the oral exchange and it was time to receive. Everything was going great until out of nowhere she starts laughing hysterically, which is never a good sign. I tried to stay in the game, but I wanted to know what's up. Through her laughter. She managed to cobble together a, I'm sorry, I was just remembering when Christina said that Tom's asshole is hot and gave me so thanks for that Brian from Toronto. You're welcome. That's nice. Yeah. Nice. Your wife. I don't want to give it to me. Does she touch your be whole? Is she a fanning or be home? No. You know, she's kind of, she's, she's, I think she gave it a whirl once and I, I panicked a little bit.

Speaker 7:          01:26:40       Sure. Yeah. And I just, it's like my no fly zone for some reason. I don't know why. For some reason the shit comes out of there. Yeah. But I mean, I, I'll tell you the hell out of her. I love fucking looking ass. I'm a big ass liquor, big ass liquor. So it's just, you know, that's, that's for when she doesn't have to reciprocate and eat your scrum. No, I don't know. I don't really want her to, you know what I mean? I'd appreciate a little bit more gagging on the old Knob, but uh, yeah, you could, uh, he could slob on it a little bit more, but no, the butthole is just kinda like, eh. Let it be, you know, you guys are so amazing. Yes. Listening. My has a couple of more, couple of, more of those and now the butthole is just kind of like, um, yeah, we gave it a whirl.

Speaker 7:          01:27:18       We can't, we know. We tried it. Yeah. We ate at that restaurant and if it wasn't that good, you know, so it's like, Nah, we're not going to come back. Maybe I want, I've already tried to get you to just like take a little test drive, you know? Yeah. Just to try to like your scrap. Yeah. But it's too hot. It's like, this is why I said it's hot and gaming where it's not as Gamey. You could make up for some, maybe like some a ball Chokan like some ball but like really, but through the, through the pop, that's not even real. Life is real. It's real. It's very real. I'm a Baja Baja Baja. Absolutely.

Speaker 7:          01:28:02       Yeah. Yeah. That's all I want you to do. Little Huff, you know, I mean just stop being so, so reserved about it. You know, just get in there. Are you a low hanging fruit? Got Low hanging fruit? No, I think they're pretty, I think that is fantastic. They're high and tight. Yeah, they're good now. He's got great balls. I've always complimented you on your balls are getting lower and I getting worried about it. Really. They're starting to swing. They're starting to, they're starting to swing. Swing a little there are we like, I won't say that this happens with any regularity but if it's July and it says it's the right or wrong toilet. Yeah, it will get some splash. It's a couple of swingers I get and I thought I got a little weird out back cause I asked another buddy and I was like, can I see are nuts.

Speaker 7:          01:28:47       Like how, how tighten are nuts. He was like, for sure. And he showed me his nuts and I was like, oh no. Like I think you're really there. Do anything like my dads, if that's all future. Okay. That's what I'm scared about because my dad's nuts are the, he puts him there on his knees and they're insane and that looks like a pig from like a pig's ball so bad. I was scared of that. He's never shy around me and I go, Oh God. I saw him from behind. I was like, Jesus Christ. He bent over to put on underwear. I was like, are those your ball? He's like, get outta here. And I was like, dude, crazy. Yeah, like grocery bags. So slumping philosophy on the cruise. When he lame, he laid on the bed with in boxer shorts and each ball swung his legs over and I caught a glimpse and then he called, he was like, come on man.

Speaker 7:          01:29:32       They're just my nuts son, your daughter. So she's seen that sound like your mother. I was like, I have seen a lot. I know, but I was like, do you think she wants to see your balls dude? And he was like, all right. I was like, all right man. A part of a part of him was so cool. Oh sorry. No, go ahead. No, go. Does it hurt when they get hang here? Like does it hurt cause my tits. Yeah, but that's so the weight differential. This is so light. Think about how heavy. That's heavy. That's like that's how these, no, this doesn't hurt. It only hurts when I'm only hurts sometimes in bed. Like if I'm in an awkward position sleeping and if I roll over a weird way and I'm like Ah, and I got him caught up a little bit. Or you can sit like especially wear jeans a little.

Speaker 7:          01:30:17       Yeah, that, that line we'll kind of, you'll be like, oh shit. Yeah, that hurts. Cuts your nuts and probably going to increase more as you get older for, she should make jeans for your nuts. Like the two little nut that comes through your genes. Huggers, not hug, none huggers. That's what the genes will be called. Or even like a stretchy panel for that area of the crotch? Well, they make, they make, um, they make night pants like that. I really liked like, uh, you know, like nighttime jammies, they make really like big cups for your nuts and your balls. I really love that. Yeah. It's really nice. Yeah. And where are these nighttime pants sometimes and my cock sits in this little just in this little bowl, like a little cock and buffalo. It's like someone holding it up just gently and it's nice and soft and it feels like this sometimes.

Speaker 7:          01:30:57       I love it. That's nice. Yeah, it's really nice. You do. Are you a fan of ball play? Do you like ball, golf? Everything. Do it, go for it. Give it, give it to me. The only thing I never over the years are, the only thing I learned is one, it takes me way too long to come from a blow job. That's just an honest fact and unfortunate truth. I remember being like getting my first one and I was like, wow, I'm never going to come. This is bad. Yeah, it scared me. And then I think it fucked with my head. Then for years I would swerve women from giving me a blow job really well cause I was like, can we just have sex? And like yeah, okay. Like if it was for play it was like let's just fuck cause I was so scared that they were going to be like, why can't he come from heard about multiple comics doing that as a like to like to Dalmatians on the road.

Speaker 7:          01:31:39       They'd be like, you want to know something? I can't come from a blowjob and I just got to stick it in. And then the girls be like, ah. And he's like, it's never happened. And they're like, you haven't had one for me. And it was just to solicit. Yeah, that's smart. Yeah. No mine's more pathetic. Mine's like I just am in my head and I just can't, he can't. Yeah, I just don't come that fast. And then I get conscious. I'm like, she's been sucking my cock for way too long. This is bad. I feel like a mean guy, you know, cause then they kind of look at you like you're going to come and you're like, I don't know. I don't think so. I don't know. I'm sorry. And they're like, am I bad at this? And you're like, yeah, you're pretty bad. That's the best is when you get into their confidence and they're like, what should I do?

Speaker 7:          01:32:21       You're like, try harder than that. And I don't like, I don't like, I don't like super aggro. I like ball play, but I don't like them when people like some people like hard, weird shit. I've seen those videos that's fun raise. He like to get some like smacked and like even this, that hurts, that hurts on your balls. You'll see people full on slapping. The pulling one is weird when they, you know, they wrote the bag and they pull it down is that one moves to watch, watch a Brazilian video. It was a, it was a Argent time and it was a, they love shit like that. The guy in the office, it was, the setup was, um, he's in the office, like waiting for an interview, you know, and he's like waiting for the job that she comes in. She's like six, two and heels like, like it looks like a real office worker and I'm here for jobs.

Speaker 7:          01:33:14       Yeah. And so she right away it's like how bad do you want the job? And he's like, and then dude takes his pants off and he has the underwear on for a while and sometimes with the underwear on you go, ah, this is probably a pad in there or something. Yeah. Then then the word comes off. She starts kicking this guy in the balls. So God, it makes me like inside makes me curl up. She pulls holes, suffer, suffered, his legs would shake. So then used to ask me to play, that made me laugh so much. Your lab is there. And then like what the fuck is this? I want to see blood, I want to see blood and they'd have that bad. Am I dick? No Lady. Don't make me laugh the most. He'd asked for more. I don't know how you can cause honestly the pain of much, much less than that makes me collapse.

Speaker 7:          01:34:12       Oh yeah. Like I'm at my dad's funeral fucking like, I won't be able to move one tap one. So how does this guy take this? It's, I think at some point it's mental that they're just like, they're so fucking deranged that the pain is so intense. It's like satisfying. You know when people do that, he's like pain fucking Mongols that are like the, the harder it is, the more that the less they feel in a weird way because it's like so intense. It, oh, it takes over. I can't know. Too sensitive. No, I don't like being hurt last week. Oh, go ahead. Go ahead. I was going to say, you made me think of like the funniest porn scenario to me that I see that I watched the video, but it doesn't turn me on is you've been steel. You see, I caught you stealing. You ever seen that one?

Speaker 7:          01:34:51       No. Oh my God. It's like, it's so, oh wait. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like the employee that's like, you're my new employee and she's like, I'm your new employee. And he's like, did you steal something? She's like, I don't think I took anything. How? How would I have taken something? And he strips them down and of course they have something like insane, like insane. It's like a laptop that she stole in her. Like in her, you know, and like her jeans. Yeah. He's like, I saw you still stole this. He's like, I'm going to have to punish you. I'll do anything. And you're like this, it's such a poor, poorly written scenario. Cause scenarios. Now we're getting like they're either insanely good and they turned me on or they're just so bad and so shitty and creepy. Like the brother sister shit. Yeah, that shit.

Speaker 7:          01:35:32       People love it. It's fucking everywhere. It was popular. I think it all incest things are super popular. Oh, I opened up, I opened up porn hub. Any of those right away. Stepbrother fucks step stepsister and they liked it. They always say it. I'm like, who the role is there? Like sis. She was like, yeah Bro. Like you would talk like that, but it's to establish like gives me sister mom said you were going to make lunch, which was like, oh I got lunch for you brother. And he's like, Whoa, fucking suck my Dick. Then then that's like the start to the scene and she's like, fine, if you'll shut up about it. Yeah. God about making lodge. I haven't come to any of those videos today. Maybe it's because, I mean I don't know. I'm just thinking about therapy thing. Like are, do you have to repress looking at your, I don't know.

Speaker 7:          01:36:15       I don't have siblings. Like do you have to repress that shit so deeply? No, it's not a, I think it's a, just an people love naughty. I think super taboo. Taboo. It's not even the idea that would never fuck their sister ever gross. Disgusting. But then they see that and they're like, it's so wrong. Like it's wrong to the wrong. It's also cause they're watching two strangers do it. Like your actual, like if a family member was even in your sexual zeitgeists then you really have an issue. But I think it's cause they're like, I don't know these fucking people right here just to Weirdos and I'm watching do weird shit is really fucking her brother. That's nuts. I definitely got to come to us. And what don't you think of your own relationship with your brother? No, we were sent this last week. Apparently I didn't know this, but I gotta show this to Andrew.

Speaker 7:          01:36:59       I got to see it. Um, this, this has been around for a couple of years. I thought this was new to us, but this video has been around for a couple of years. Um, I don't know if you've seen this, but this is what's been around. Uh, we played it last week. Oh God. And Julia made Joe just wanted to say hi. Wish you a great day. Tell you that meeting you yesterday and getting a look at you was probably one of the greatest moments of my life. You was so beautiful. You don't know how beautiful you are to me. So just, you're gorgeous. You're precious. The met her at a club and got her number and then she woke up to this, this nice guy. Inbox. Sweet guy. Sweet. So far. Yeah, you're gorgeous. He's got a good goatee. He combed his hair and he's got the fan running.

Speaker 7:          01:37:49       I like this. He's almost too, it's a great goatee. It's in the, in the, in the world of goatees. Got It. That's the one. He's got a cute little bunch and underneath there. So the more hairs growing in the crevasse, but it's been sitting in my mind when you said to me, you want to go back with your ex boyfriend, please erase him from your memory. Please don't ever go back in the past. I know because I've been there and I understand when you know you're trying to find somebody and you'd go on dates and not the compares to your Eurex but hold on. He was religious by the way.

Like just not a fully, just like a half the half Chubb, you know, like, yeah. I've never gotten one because he and I hooked up on the time of Friendster. Oh yeah. Never even, I've never sent my wife a dick pic. No chance. I got half little Haffey yeah. As a text. What was no, I think it was an email to be honest with Ya. An email? Yeah. I think it was an email. A picky emails. Both spots. Um, no and that probably is the nail in the coffin. You meet this girl and like, what's the shit? It was like friend of a friend type of shit.

Speaker 7:          01:40:44       Don't really know her that well. A lot of flirting. Um, I thought real horny. I'm going to send you this penis. Pick A, I got no response and got uh, nothing ever again. I think it was indication of my, my lack of skill. Really. Yeah. Was there? Um, but it wasn't like, you weren't just like, oh, I met you, here's a dick pic. There was like a lot of, there's a lot of communication and then she saw it. Ghost. Yeah. Not a cool penis by not a cool penis by, that's my name of my bio. Yes. Send me the pictures and it's a, it's just half. It's half. That's, yeah, but here's what I'm thinking.

Speaker 7:          01:41:29       People. I painted a little face on it. On the top. No. Do you hear people call your city Chicago? CHICAGO? Yeah, for sure. I don't like shy town either. That bothers me so much. Really? We don't say that. Right. It's like someone being like the big apple. You're like, no one's ever said that about New York. Who the fuck puts this out there? I was born and raised here in the big gamble. Uh, what about Illinois with the hardest? Yeah. What are you doing? Yeah, Illinois. Nope, it's not, yeah. Chicago. Yeah. Shy town. That stuff is city.

And I was like, no fucking way. And it's like I had never paid attention to it. Where does the art come from? They'd throw it in. Why? I don't know. I think cause Chicago sounds so Duh. I don't know. People's, a Chicago. So it sounds like the this in the city. No. Yeah, but in Chicago it's such like a thick, like Chicago is such a thick accent that the A's, depending on what part you're from, say Chicago, ah, to emphasis all in the APP. But when people say Chicago, it sounds like all, all there and our cargo, that's where it comes from.

I, I was like, dude, I was a punk piece of shit when I was a kid. Yeah. But he's like, he's like, yeah, but if I don't do stuff like this, they just do whatever the fuck they want. I usually take him belt until them, I'd beat to shit. Oh. And I was hoping he, I was waiting for him to be like, yeah, no, I'll crack them in a fucking high when you leave. But he kept saying it the way he said it to him, cause I told him he could punch you in. I told him he could hit you once. It's almost like he said that before and now it's finally going to happen. Right, right, right. Cause I'll let somebody hit. Yeah, that's fucking brilliant dad.

Like cause your footing, you're doing dumb shit as he, you don't think about anything. You're like, oh we're just fucking around. And you'd get away with one level, then you go to the next one. Yeah. Like I remember, you know, it starts with like egging something. Oh yeah. You're going to steal some shit from place. Next you're going to vandalize. Same with drugs or hooking. You know, you give out a hand job or a job, you start hooking wants start eating. Guy's ass is on the street, then I'm planting up, you know, planning, doing crazy shit and wet, wet angel.

Speaker 7:          01:55:24       I remember until I got caught doing stuff, he just keeps, it keeps escalating because that's normal. You're testing boundaries. What can I get away with? How much shit can I fuck up? Oh Man, I was such a punk fucking kid. We used to garage hop. You know what that is? That's such a Midwest. When people leave their group, people in the Midwest League, their garage is open, you know, like you know, cause they've drove their car home and they're doing something in her outside and coming and going. They just leave it up. Yeah. We would go in there and steal whatever they had in that. Oh Shit. Beer mostly is what you're hunting for. Cause in the Midwest most people have fridges in their garages. Yeah. You just hunt for beer. And then also if there's some other shit, take it off. Just take everything you can. Goes got nine iron.

Speaker 7:          01:55:58       I'm just going to take this. Yeah. Fuck. I like golf. Take it. You know, we were just pieces of shit. We've tried to break in, steal and do whatever we could use. Test the boundaries. Then you get hit by dad and, and you know that. That's great. Cause I think about our two boys. You're going to have to regulate dude, you got a God. If you got to let them get punched by a stranger. Yeah, you do have to let them be, you know, get checked. You don't do that. It's got to check them, but you have to let them get checked publicly. That's cool. I don't know why he trusted me because I don't, I don't. I look like I have it together. But for some reason like what would a bad move if he was like, go ahead, hit my kid. I'm like, fuck yeah, you told me to hit him Bro.

And that's pretty crazy because the conversation we had beforehand was pretty, pretty obvious. I said, yeah, he almost hit my wife in the face. He knew I was going to punch a kid with a woman with me, but if I was alone, yeah, you can almost hit me with a balloon. He'd be like, oh, okay, fuck off.
