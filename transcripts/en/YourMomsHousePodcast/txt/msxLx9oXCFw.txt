Speaker 6:          00:08:48       The fuck. Yay. Okay. And it's retarded.

Speaker 4:          00:09:19       Ah, Shit. Ah, shit man. Yeah, great. Was that, that was on one of those morning news shows which so painful. Yeah. The ones that I've been going on lately where they have, they always have a cooking segment. They're like, hey, this morning and this lady is I guess, uh, in town and she's has the, you know, the, they're making salads and then I guess she's a yoga person. Um, she's wearing a shirt. I don't know, it says seven Greens, I dunno. But, um, I, news guy walks over, she just, she starts to get kind of flirt

Speaker 1:          00:10:05       coming down to enjoy some salads. Might be you have, everybody wants a younger girl, right? Jason, I know you want me to toss your salad.

Speaker 4:          00:10:21       Those yoga girls totally shuts it down to he looks away. He's like, well no. He's like, he knows that that's trouble, you know, so it goes instead of like having fun with it. He just said that boss, I didn't say nothing. I guess a, you're not even allowed to laugh, right? Yeah. Cause that encourages the bad behavior. This is an adult and you can't even laugh man. And she's actually, you know, she didn't say it, I don't think to be like, you know, to make that joke. She really was making uh, making the other girl a salad. So when she tells him that, he's like, it's so funny to me that that exists in the world where adults have to restrain themselves. I just don't understand it. I have a real, I struggle with it. You know, I used to work in a law firm and that was the hardest thing in the world was to restrain myself constantly. They just really, really shut it down. Right? Yeah. You can't have fun. Yeah. No, you're not supposed to laugh at your job or be inappropriate, obviously. Very Sullen, man. I did. It's so painful. Was it? Could you imagine working on a morning show how fucking hard and horrible that would be for one for us. Wow. I can't wait to see this new salad. A big of this show is spending time just you.

Speaker 4:          00:12:00       You spend time fake reacting to things so they have to go like, that's me. Oh, it takes spending time with a toddler, like, wow, look at your salads. You how much that takes out of you. Just do that for a second. I know, but maybe some, maybe some people are like that and normally is that someone's real personality. Some people's, but even then they, it becomes their personality because they manufactured it for a while. Yeah, no one's born like that to go like, that's good gray. See that they got a new donut over on main street go. Okay. Is that, yeah. Is that socialization like I grew up in a house where if I'm not happy all the time I got in trouble is probably, or maybe it was just, yeah, don't show feelings. It was so bad in my house growing up. I overcompensate by being like, that's gray.

Speaker 4:          00:12:51       Yeah, because feelings are dangerous. You'll get it, you'll get in trouble. Well, they're like that on the morning shows a lot, you know? That's the, whether it's local or even national, the Good Morning Americas and shows, it's always like an maybe that's just puts people in a good mood, can know. You wake up and they're like going to work and they turn that on and someone's like, Hey, this is really neat. What's going on here today? It may be it for the non cynical person. Oh fuck them. Maybe for normal people that's like cheerful. Feels good. Yeah, it was good, but it doesn't work for me. I don't work for me. You know what I don't understand either are are people who want to be Miss America. That's another one. Right? Why? Why is that even a thing for you? I want to be with American. You're so going to win this year and we're practicing your answers. The best is when they have like the hardest part for them is answering one question. What was the big, it was with fucking Steve Harvey this year. No, no, no, that's, yeah, that's his friend is the best. What's the big fuck up with the answer? Remember the girl who lost her mind in the answer. No, you don't remember that. Wait, what do you like? She bluffs. She flubbed it or something.

Speaker 4:          00:14:02       She's like kill all the Jews. I'm, I'm, I don't know what I'm saying. Yeah know it's 2007 it was miss teen USA.

Speaker 7:          00:14:15       We're on pause. Have shown a fifth of Americans can't locate the u s on a world map. Why do you think this says, I personally believe that you had some Americans are unable to do so because some people out there and our nation and I believe that our education like such as South Africa and Iraq everywhere, like such as, I believe that our education over here and then you asked should help the US. I should help eyes

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       and should help die. I can the Asian countries able to build on our future so bad. It's hard. I covered my eyes for that whole thing. It's pretty well look at the screen. I wonder if you ask her the same question today if you'd have the same response. There's no way you think she's gotten over the correct response a few times. Yeah. Yeah. I think the next day it was, it must have been just genuine panic. You're a bit like just a panic moment. She didn't, she blanked and she had no idea. You could. I'm sure. Did you have that in stand up? The first years we were like, I don't even know what I'm saying. I'm so nervous. Course. It's like when you just press play on your act and you go like, I'm just going to just say what I'm saying. She up. She was nervous and she's young.

Speaker 4:          00:15:46       That's miss teen, but I know that the older broads they practice, she said the Iraq, they don't own maps such as uh, but the older broads, they rehearsed the questions, don't they give you worse so you're, you're rehearsed. And that to them is the most nerve wracking event is having a talk. That's, that's the funniest part to me is that's the challenge. I agree. I think the ratings would pick up significant Miss Nebraska, here's six guys who you start with first I missed Pennsylvania and I can suck six. Can I take the challenge? Wow. We really, there should be a porn parody of that where they think there is. Yeah. There has to be a miss America porns Google it up. It's a great thing. Miss America course, they're triple x parody where it's like if you want to win, you've got to blow the judges. Yep. That's exactly it sounds.

Speaker 4:          00:17:02       I don't see it. I see parodies, but, but you don't, here's the thing with Miss America, do you win like a, you want a small amount of money? It's not life changing. It's not like you win million. Oh No, no. But it's, um, the exposure, if you, if you play that exposure right, it's also dwindled. It used to be a big deal, you know, that was, that would be front page news the day after and they would parade her around on everything is, people just don't care about it as much anymore. And I think a big part of that has been that porn, but no, the feminist push of the last year, the growth, you know what I mean? Where they go, wow, it's seen as silly now because so many women go, this is silly. It's women. So we're saying, well, that, and I think, I think there was a time in America where the only, the only place you could see a, a hot chicken, a bathing suit, was during the Miss America pageant. You know what? Like maybe in the fifties you're like, oh shit, everybody get their dicks in their hands. The Miss America pageants on and now it's like there's porn, there's lad mags. There's, there's so much exposure to that. This isn't that what they're called Lad Fhn and maximum they're called lad mag.

Speaker 4:          00:18:11       I'm from almost, oh, they're called Chavez. Somebody wrote in those boys that talk like, like have horrible do their accent, master of accents. This car, it lifts off mate. This call moves columns. I've never driven a car. Like why do you have to make your teeth kind of bucked out? Cause they do all English people have butts. They're using the queen of England talk. Yeah, she does all, I'm the queen of England, England. Um, everybody, I started drag dead Tay. Now that what she does, she dictates tee time. Of course, every day she tells me and Drake, y'all fucking tight. No wait, what were we saying? Miss America, that porno. Did you find it? No, no, no.

Speaker 4:          00:19:14       But yeah, you don't win a ton of money and maybe, yeah, maybe the exposure for like a minute and people are like, Oh, you're who? Cool and you wear a crown. It seems silly now. So dumb. It seems so, it also, it seems antiquated. They feel like, I feel like millennials are like what I was Miss America. What the fuck is Miss America? Even bathing suits look silly like bikinis, the style of them they feel dated, you know, on the pageant. I feel like they just feel old timing. Yeah, they should wear like Brazilian. I say they should go topless and then just writing a song like Miss Brazil and there used to be topless and then a hole in the front of the front fantasy. You can see how they shaved their pizza, the gap close. But show the hair real interesting. My Fun.

Speaker 4:          00:20:18       What if, okay, here's how they should read you. They need to remix it to make it for today's audience, they need to have miss America like in revenge of the nerds belching contests who can light her fart best. That'd be cool. I have my money's, I Miss Michigan and then uh, you know like beer drinking and stuff like that. And then the blow bang thing and then that's the last event. That's the most important. And then we have Miss Idaho saying she can eat and she's never been with a black guy, but she's about to blow eight of them. Here we go, there's Idaho, go ahead. Or it's Miss Universe and Miss Amsterdam comes on and she's like, no, I'm gonna take this shit home. And she puts candles and or beaver and does cartwheels and stuff. Yeah. Pretty cool man. I'm just suggesting it to them if they want to get their ratings up, I think the more that we're exposed to this what I'm going to play, they're more that Miss America becomes like, uh Huh.

Speaker 8:          00:21:27       This is the newest video on my Oscar gender terrorist playlists on my channel. Um, I'm updating all of my playlist because they haven't been able to post anything on time. You would like to know why. Check out my asked Dakota life update and we can talk there. You'll find out. So anyway, this video is something that I have consistently said in my everyday life and I feel like maybe I need to reiterate and just maybe I just want to make a video that I can link people to when I was,

Speaker 4:          00:21:58       that's cool. I think it is going to reiterate, reiterate. I want to reiterate what I've been saying for awhile. He sounds like that Tyler Oakley guy that I love so much. Hey guys, I have absolutely nothing to say in the world. I got my haircut. Yeah Blah Blah Blah. I was like, well it cuts your out or not

Speaker 8:          00:22:17       dragging and I'm tired of their shit so my pronouns are not perfect. You're not a preference. They are mandatory for interaction with me.

Speaker 4:          00:22:32       Are you laughing? Sorry I wasn't, I didn't see him until you put him up. Well I'd say actually he looks a little like he's a larger dude. He's got a full beard, full beard, full must. You know we mustache, it looks like a Septum piercing safety pin through it, which is normal. And then he has your aunt Mildred head wrap arm after she takes a shower. And, and some taste, full eye makeup, shadow with the beard. It goes nice. And my favorite, I think here as I see either shaved eyebrows or bleached eyebrows, which is a sign of total sanity. That's, I've got my shit together. He loves horrified and he has a tank on. He has, he has manipulated. It's no longer the tank you bought at the store. He's, he's cut it. That's obviously with a scissors. Oh, to make it even lower. It's very low open tank on the front. Hasn't waxed the shoulders lately. Um, something I need to do to pal. Uh, Dakota. It's a really neat luck. So a look, this is America. How do you feel? So the code is talking about right now is that his gender pronouns are not an option. Right?

Speaker 8:          00:23:58       I just expect everyone in the world to understand my identity. I barely understand my identity, my salary.

Speaker 4:          00:24:06       That's kind of weirdly fusing. It's an equal to everyone ever to say. Like I don't understand that either. So then maybe, well then here's the thing and I, if you're not sure what what and who, maybe hold off on demanding that everyone stay updated with the pronouns to refer to you as like maybe hold off until you've decided and then make a formal announcement and then stick to it as an adult. You know what I mean? One way of looking at it, right.

Speaker 8:          00:24:33       I understand someone to respect them or their wishes so I don't have to understand what it is to be a black person to speak respectfully to black people. I'm pretty sure that you can do the same for trans people specifically nonbinary people. We're not,

Speaker 4:          00:24:48       that's what I'm talking about because I don't think there's any problem understanding trans people actually think there's personally. I understand nonbinary as a non binary person this week am and I wish you would respect my pronouns. I've been eating a lot of oatmeal and I'm identifying I'm oatmeal gendered. Okay. Just if you could respect that. I do respect it. Okay. Is there honey on it? Sometimes brown sugar, sometimes it just, but it, it just depends.

Speaker 8:          00:25:28       They're not trendy. We're not interesting or something that you can um, fetishize or try to, you know, just fucking some. It's just off. Just shut the fuck up. Just stop. We're not like so hard and difficult difficulty mean in inconvenient. Like imagine what it is to be me and then you want to tell me how hard it is for you to understand me and my pronouns. Like wait, what wage do you think that's helping and what way do you think that that's fucking appropriate? Stop prioritizing your comfort as a cis person over the struggles and the respect and the wishes of trans people. Your wrong. So shut the fuck up. We don't want to hear about how difficult being around us and knowing us is. He's

Speaker 4:          00:26:14       not a trans man. He's saying isn't he saying he's non good is a good point. I mean it seems like it's two different arguments cause there's a trend. There's, I understand transgendered, I am a man transitioning to a woman or I feel more like a woman. I'm a man. If you live on the loan for the, he's saying I'm opting out of both. I am non, I just didn't know that that was a neither. I didn't know either. And I'm so happy for you that you've found that, that thank you. That is kind of the thing that is nice for me to celebrate with another non binary person is that we get to finally say we are. We think you mean they know we might sell, but in your mind I need you. I hope you're not saying she and you're in your mind together. Are We? And we get to, we get to finally be in a place where people are so focused on genders. I know it's so exhausting that there, I know everyone's like noise. What are you, I'm nothing neither.

Speaker 8:          00:27:25       It's not going to house. Why don't you know that? Would that being said, change your language like no one is female. No one is born a girl. No one is any of that. Like we are assigned genders at birth by doctors who look at us and see certain types of Genitalia and decide what our identity will be from there on out. That's an act of violence that should be stopped. That's not my fucking fault that that happened and I'm

Speaker 4:          00:27:52       we, but sex is different than gender. You're assigned a sex at birth, he's saying, but the, the doctor doesn't assign you a gender identity that that's what you do. They certainly do. Well, I'm sorry. Maybe he, yeah, I thought it was the other way. I didn't know. No, I guess the doc,

Speaker 8:          00:28:08       there's your faults prices. I'm living outside of that, so

Speaker 4:          00:28:12       yeah. I told her I'm on board with you dog. I think that it is an act of violence. When a doctor sees your penis and testicles and says, you're a boy, you know? Yeah. No, I, I know what you're saying. Sorry. I'm not, I don't mean to offend they, it's, it's just like, I guess I'm being really insensitive here or a doctor pulls you out. He goes, oh, we got got a pussy right here. Has got to be a girl. Ah, no. Well, how do you, how should we messed up with Alice? We, we, we gender identified him as a boy. I know. I'm putting him in football outfits and stuff. Oh No. What shall we do? We're messing him up. We're messing him up. I conforming to gender em up the Hash Shit. Should we start referring to him as them? And they of course, I don't want to confuse the kid.

Speaker 4:          00:29:03       Um, I would keep playing this video, but I want to tear my fucking eardrums out so you can. Um, we'll put up a link to it later. You know, and here's this, no one, no one wants to hold anyone back. I don't certainly deny anybody whatever they are, but I think to demand that everyone keep up to speed with your gender identity at every given moment. Yeah, I mean, come on. That's a little unrealistic. I just don't know what the proper pronouns are all the time. I think actually the reality is these are just confused people, you know, they're confused. These, I think the, I think the folks that are like, I'm astral gendered. No, they need attention. That's different. I think when someone's like, I'm a man trapped in a woman's body that's legit. Like if you're willing to cut her off for some of you, but you don't even, that's a real deal.

Speaker 4:          00:29:51       Even have to go that far. I think people just feel like, I don't want it to surgically manipulate myself, but I am in the wrong body. I think that's totally, but I think it's kind of, it is a lot to ask for you to look at like me, like a guy with a beard and it'd be like, it'd be like be go, hey man, what the fuck are you? Why are you calling me a man? I'm like, oh sorry, sorry. Your acts of violence. Like assuming that I'm a man. Yeah. You kind of fit all the checkmarks so yeah man with eye shadow and it's still going to have you look at the person we were just looking at it. Most people would assume that's a guy wearing eye shadow. You don't go like that's probably a nonbinary person. No, you wouldn't know that. Why would you assume that? God Give us Allah, give us all a break. Give us time to come around to all the pronouns. We don't know. The mainstream doesn't know this stuff. No, no, you can't. How are we supposed to know? God Damn. It's a lot. It's a lot to ask. I W I wish we could show like my dad or your dad that video and have them tell us their feelings. I think I've pretty much, I think I can sum it up.

Speaker 4:          00:31:10       What's that guy's a fag. It doesn't guy does know it. Please. Okay. I think that's what everybody's dad would say. Yeah. P is, he is a, he's in a lot of pain and that guy, that guy pacifically looks like he's in a lot of turmoil. He does. He's not doing so well. And the nails were painted and he had a bunch of tattoos on his hands. Like tattooed. I didn't they, they're like weird marker drawings, you know, you can deduce that he's in a lot of pain. Yeah. So Real, real heartbreaking news for a lot of listeners of the show.

Speaker 4:          00:31:58       Not that, not Danny obviously, but the hey hit the hill ever wasn't bad girl that we played last week, kicked off of Youtube. What some people actually heard her very logical videos and flagged it as hate speech. Hurried him fucking boot. Just, I don't know if she was advocating violence, but she was definitely in the, uh, in the school of, hey, why does this Hitler Guy have such a bad, well, I guess it'd be like isis putting recruitment videos up on youtube. We really don't allow that. It's country. Um, that's, um, that's too bad. I was really looking forward to hearing her, um, her other work on Saddam Hussein or subscribe. Jeez. She's known as the valley on and she, she had uploaded videos of her singing happy birthday to Hitler and another video on how to spot a Jew.

Speaker 4:          00:33:05       I know we didn't, we didn't do that. One other charming videos include why Hitler wasn't evil, which is what we played and how feminists supported rape by causing the migrant crisis. That's her name and value on the valley on a l. E. V. A. L. I. O. N. She said to be an 18 year old girl living in Canada. And she, is she a patriots cousin? Uh, patriotic. I Dunno. Pet put that down like shit. The teenager openly admitted to being a Holocaust denier. Oh, cheese on April 20th. Oh Dude. She looks like a just a regular teenage girl, like a sweet blond, blue eyed. No, she's got a Brunette so she's obviously not as high up the food chain as she thinks. She should know that Hitler wouldn't appreciate her cause she filmed herself singing happy birthday in front of a picture of the Nazi shit bag as this is how this is written here.

Speaker 4:          00:34:02       Um, she had baked for cupcakes, decorated with swastikas. Um, she, the channel was terminated and then Youtube said that channel was terminated by us because it violated policies against hate speech. Thank you. I value one if I am.

Speaker 4:          00:46:49       hydrea hydrea hey, can we do my Persian voicemails? Yeah. So tell us what happened with the, with you got more voicemails, right? Well, yeah, they kind of kicked into high gear this weekend. I'm not sure what happened. I'm here, I've saved them. I've, I've actually had to put this number in as a contact now because I get so many, yeah, I've gotten one, two, three since Wednesday. Let's here it's called Persian legged. Out of that, take it out of the, out of the case. Yeah. Hold on. I've had, I call it Persian lady now because like I get so many, [inaudible] has been getting a lot of job offers in Texas and she's not getting those. What about atus? So eight is, we actually found out his real name because somebody tried to log in then you want them up and I looked, ate us up and he is exactly who I thought he would be like a, he looked how I thought he would. He's like a hipster do with Lego, you know, like a white guy with an ironic kind of t shirt.

Speaker 3:          00:47:45       Um, so the first one is last Wednesday, right? Come here. Yeah, it's, it's under Persian lady and it starts on Wednesday. She says here,

Speaker 9:          00:47:57       hey live. Which I dunno to add bacteria to be modest. Don't have it. Yeah. Anyway, I'm just telling you to take care of you. A 50 oh he don't be doing good. Still. Call him to them. Yes.

Speaker 4:          00:48:12       What the fuck man? How are you doing? Good. Ben. Solomon never calls you back. Never. Never. Never.

Speaker 9:          00:48:20       I know. [inaudible] some are in Arabic. Nicona Hall.

Speaker 3:          00:48:26       This is the Thursday one. When that was Wednesday before it. Before. Here's Thursday. Yeah. Thursday. Yeah

Speaker 9:          00:48:34       I am. Hi Mommy. Dandelion. We should jag. [inaudible] now that door we call Mikey cottages. [inaudible] a little snow badge. I'm let me know. What are you feeling? What are you doing? What's up? [inaudible] magnet going in and we can of, so then coming back to your homies and shit. I'm telling you man, call me [inaudible] you need anything? Call you. Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:48:59       but isn't there a point, this is what I keep saying is it isn't there a point through all these phone calls when you never get, cause you never obviously gets the call back. There has to be some point where he's, maybe she sees Salami and then at that point isn't it like, isn't there ever an exchange about hey, you know how you get my message about that, or yeah, my medicine or I told you that yesterday and then you know what might happen? Is it Salamay might be so sick that when this person see Salamay and mentions that insomnia goes, you didn't fucking call me. They go to me so crazy. Right now she's, she's got dementia. She's, you know, she doesn't even know that I called her earlier. Wow.

Speaker 4:          00:49:37       I see. I think Solomon is our age. Do you think so? Yeah. For some reason I think this is a maternal figure to Salome and this might be like a kid and that's why I've always pictured sodomy is all, no, I think [inaudible] is younger and that's why she kind of gives, I think it's a boy to a pass because all, you know, Silo May, he's always out having fun. And then here's Friday. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:50:01       Yes. Oh man, that ass, I mean Arigato Heidi, Daniel as one line. I mean n e m a new area clean only bacterial AskPat and maybe I believe in that software. Can I'm, I'm good. I'm back to normal again. I don't have any new [inaudible]. I know. Whichever one spending gives it up all in bacteria in your body and from the EEC is from inside you as no holiday. I'm telling you my little too. Okay. Do you get it?

Speaker 4:          00:50:38       Yeah. See it's, it's a, I think she's an attorney,

Speaker 9:          00:50:43       was going to give it up. All the bacteria in your body and strongly easy is from inside. You know, holiday. I'm telling you my little tool kit. Okay. Do you imagine Jack, he has lots of information again to give you a ride there. Can you take care of what one of you talk to some cause plants you shouldn't eat. Just how bad.

Speaker 4:          00:51:08       Crazy bright there. The answer's probably like, motherfucker, that's 400 messages. Well the thing is they're clearly communicating in between because she knows salamis not feeling well and it's a bacterial infection. Right? And, and she keeps asking about the lease. This is the second or third thing about a lease agreement. So maybe he's in real estate or something or they're renting a property. She's kind of all that bacteria though, man. You gotta you gotta get rid of that bacteria from the inside out. I like that. She specified that from the outside. [inaudible] Sullivan. Tallow may take the fucking bills. Jesus wanna know Solomon, you should tell your mom that you changed your number, buddy. Yeah. Should we call him personally lady back? I think at this point maybe we should just do it on your mom's house. What? We do it right now. Oh, I'm so nervous. What do we say? I mean, do you want to just, we shouldn't keep this going to tell them was sick. Okay. All right. Let's call the Persian lady. Oh my God. Alright. Hopefully what happens so nervous. Talk to her. I feel like we know each other. I know.

Speaker 7:          00:52:22       Do you speak Farsi? I speak for, I see it.

Speaker 4:          00:54:48       Oh, so weird. Is that my friend Sarah could be steroids. Are you doing this? She's a big meal. I saw them. Yeah. Make CD downstairs. I know. We got to play at one day. We've made that years ago. I know when we were touring. Yeah. We actually went into a recording studio and meowed songs with Sarah Burns. It was fun. They still remember me when I went back to record to to like do my comedy album. My second one. They're like, I remember you. You did the meal songs. Hey can we talk about my shit yesterday? Oh, okay. Uh, what you act like we don't talk about the stuff on the show

Speaker 1:          00:55:34       next door. Brown Todd Brown jar coming up. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:55:43       I just have a question for you. Sure. So okay, I'm going to explain the situation and then you kind of tell me your thoughts on it. Like I'm going to walk you through it. So I was alone with ls. It was Sunday morning. You hadn't come home yet. Right? And I drank, my company selling guy was out drinking. You were out getting hammered partying. How'd you come home yet? Hadn't come home yet. You're worthless guy. And then I drink my coffee so I usually get my cup of coffee ready. I drink it. I go in to get Ellis in the morning. I wake him up, I feed him, I diaper him, I bring him downstairs and then I feed the dogs. Anyway, I go on to Alyssa's room and I've already, I'm like three quarters of the way through my coffee. I don't really do that.

Speaker 4:          00:56:26       Normally I feed him and just as I'm about to change him, I feel the urge to shit. The problem is, and you know this since I've given birth, is that I have a really hard time holding in my stools and that they go, it's immediately, we'll have to shit now I really have the shit. And so I was like panicked trying to change his diaper and like I change him. I'm like Oh my God. Oh my God, I'm going to shit my pants. I didn't know what to do. My back was hurting so I couldn't just put them in the crib and go shit cause my backup fucked up in tennis. So I'm like, oh my God, what do I do? So I hurry, I diaper him. I, we know run downstairs, I put them in the swing, I strapped him in and then I go take a shit downstairs. Right. And it was a lot. It was like a number four and it was like two number four logs. Yeah. There, here's the problem. I went to wipe and it was like a fucking, like a melted Hershey's kiss in the toilet paper. It was so narrowly, I like, you know when you do that first why but, and you're like, oh my God. Yeah. Oh my God, that is so much. And now normally I would just go into the shower and fuck my stoma. Yeah. But thankfully the other day and I just bid day the shit out of it and then like shit out of my shit and then I wiped it clean. But why do you think that happens to me? Do you think that that's a uh, post-pregnancy thing? Does that happen to you ever?

Speaker 3:          00:57:58       Well, first of all, I just want to say I'm really glad you asked this question and I appreciate all the details. Um, that was really matter because it was, it was good. It was because I held it in a little bit longer than I normally would came out mushy. Yeah. That's interesting. Um, I think, you know, it's a real neat, the, that you, that you told us all those details, pool pool. Um, but that's pertinent to the case Brown lock. It's not like random. It's a good point. Um, yeah, I think it's a combination of you probably you were, you said you were holding it in, you're probably drinking coffee. Yeah. Um, and you know, maybe maybe a little bit of what you ate at the, at the previous meal. Do you remember? Do you recall what you ate? Yes. Counselor. What did you have? Well, Brown previous meal,

Speaker 4:          00:58:52       Brown luck. I went to a Vegan baby shower or vegetarian baby shower and I had a lot of different bean varieties and I think that may have contributed to my powerful for yeah. And the coffee too, definitely contributed to, he makes it different. Holding it in. I think the holding it in was really cool.

Speaker 3:          00:59:14       What you're saying is, yeah, it's a combination of things is holding it in. It's gonna make it worse though.

Speaker 4:          00:59:19       Wait, but why is the wipe, it wasn't diarrhea. So why was the wipe so unclean? That's like, I'm serious. Why am I not pinching off alone? Clean the machine. It was mushy. You didn't have just normal logs, right? No, you couldn't have, they were fours. They were perfect. I mean words are perfect, perfect logs. They were a little hotter than normal, but I don't know if that, yeah, they're an exemplary for like if you kind of look at this, they were a little hotter and a little more torn, but that heat means that they weren't perfect because perfect ones aren't hot. Hot indicates that it's a little higher up on that scale. You're probably looking at like a five and a five and a half, you know, broken pieces. There were a solid. But if their heaters like that, that means something's up that you know, you can always tell the heat factor means this is not 100% and I think it probably has to do with the fact that you were having a lot of veggies.

Speaker 4:          01:00:27       And I'll tell you what happened to me. I was in smear my juice and I went, I had three, four meals at a Vegan restaurant and I got to say I really enjoyed it, man. Really, really enjoyed it. It was, it was good food and I didn't do it because I was on some mission to eat that way. It was purely out of convenience and then it was good. So I stayed at a hotel and right next door, let's see, I'll see if I can plug the place, see what you get back to you. But what you're saying that the log was a little hot and torn and that's why it just wouldn't break clean because of the texture on hearts. A lark strong hearts cafe is where I went. But I'm asking you, it's the texture of the law. You're saying something that could clench it off and leaves behind Mush.

Speaker 4:          01:01:25       You held loud. He had mud but, and then I know those, I know those, you know the, the real blessing and in the skies was though. What's that? That you were home. I know I've had those in public cause then you're wiping and wiping and wiping. AndW and then somebody goes, can I eat your ass and go, you sure you want to do that, right? It happens every night. The Persian, he's calling back, calling back. Oh. Oh my God. Oh my God. Fuck. How did my phone just shut down? So weird. We're definitely going to have a voicemail right now, man. Anyway, so the phone starting, tell me more about your brand's story and then we'll go back. Well, so I ate these vegan meals. First of all, I just want to give a plug to Vegan eating for a second. They were delicious meals at, like I said, strong hearts cafe in Syracuse, smear my juice. And secondly, um, it has doubled when you eat vegan and it's good. You just feel good. I was feeling good after meals. That's so bad. Venus, you know, there's no bloat. There's no like, uh, hitting you like, uh, you know, when you travel. Yeah. Road food.

Speaker 4:          01:02:43       You can even go to a great restaurant and be like, Oh God. Oh yeah. So much, you know, heaviness to it. You know, the truth of it is the less you eat, the better you feel. And the lighter you eat. More veggies, more fruits. But his real, she left a voicemail. Oh, okay. Let's hear it. Um, fuck can, I do want to say this. I didn't have crazy dumps. Really. I had a lot of farts. Huh? Dude, it's shutting down again. That's weird. This so, but you didn't have a crazy dump after four vegan meals.

Speaker 2:          01:03:15       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:03:17       Isn't that crazy? I think you need to wait a little bit because you really react poorly to veggies. Right. But I didn't, I'm saying I had normal bowel movements, but a lot of farts. I mean, oh

Speaker 2:          01:03:32       Huh.

Speaker 4:          01:03:35       That's a neat story. Yeah. I mean

Speaker 2:          01:03:40       it was,

The baby kind of messed up my Medea watching. But you know, you and I got into a show and to the Americans and there's a guy on there, Gregory, who I recognize.

I'm a bisexual polyamorous bear with two boyfriends. I'd be happy to answer literally any questions also, I love your show so much. I would not hesitate to marry it and make it part of my poly pile. Smack Hound. Thanks. Smack Erin. Yeah. Can I ask you something? Polyamorous bear with two boyfriends now you refer to them kind of equally to boyfriends. I understand in the, in the polyamorous community you say you have your, that's his, he was looking right. Oh Geez. Am I my phone case?

Speaker 4:          01:17:12       Great. Uh, but usually they say I have a primary and a secondary, but I noticed that you kind of equate your two boyfriends. So how has that work? I would ask that. Good question. And why don't you read the third one? Yeah. When Christina was talking about European nudity, I was just chuckling, but I can say with a lot of certainty that Polish people both in Poland and living in the UK would freak out if you are walking around and just your underwear. Nudity is Devo, not normal. Maybe they were in it called hippie in the cult. Slash. Hippy. It sounds funny though. Piece and much love Malar I think. No. Yeah. Well listen, uh, me Milosh I am not a fucking Polak. I'm Hungarian and I tell you, if you go to Hungary and you go to the [inaudible] hotel and you go to a thermal bath, uh, which is the most popular thing you can do in Budapest, that you have to go nude budget.

Speaker 4:          01:18:09       What Mila is pointing out is then we're really adamant about European, European, European euro. No. Did any Europe in Europe, US Europeans in Europe. Here we are all naked all the time. And was telling you that that is not the case. Also too, I believe we're just more comfortable with nudity. And I say that because look, you try the TV at 10:00 PM in Europe, Western Europe, you know, and there's tents on TV and commercials for like, you know, fucking lollipop commercials. There's a girl with her tits out or whatever. So I'm just saying, and there's tits and magazines like normal magazines in England. By the way, those lad mags, yeah, they show their tits. Okay. Okay. So, uh, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:19:01       MMM.

Speaker 4:          01:19:03       Why don't you read the,

Speaker 3:          01:19:05       this one?

Speaker 4:          01:19:08       Hi, Mommy's here too. Hi, Mommy's, I noticed you guys talking about flippers on a few of the last episodes. So for those of you don't know what those are, flippers are like retainers. What is she doing now? Do you hear her course out here? Does she, who fucking knows? We just have a distracter uh, flippers are like fake teeth. Uh, it's a retainer with a tooth or two on it. And that's what people do. Instead of replacing teeth, they'll get a retainer. And I had a cousin that did that for a few years. So this person writes, I make a lot of these pieces of shit as I work for a dental lab. You would not believe what some trashy people ask for with these things. Some include gold front teeth with dollar signs. Some even want a picture of their ugly kids put on. Oh my God.

Speaker 4:          01:19:57       Like they're proud to show off how poorly they take care of their teeth. Feel free to ask any more questions you have in the dental world. I'm also poly by, and when I tell people how it worked, they look at me like I just burped in their faces anyway. High and tight. You fellow mommy. Nick. Hello. Oh, that's so finally hate Hitler. Yeah. Longtime listener from the days you lived in the ghetto and your neighbor's stench would come through your walls. Yup. It's been so long. That's how I remember the story. Being a gay man and having many bear friends. See, I would have to say Tom is definitely a California grizzly care. He is very comfortable with his primitive ways, marking his territory with his boogers and making brown ferocious. Yeah. Throughout the day. Otherwise we would just call him a Pooh bear. Yeah, because he is cuddly and likes to eat a lot. You sure? Oh my gosh. You know, it's weird. I was reading Winnie the Pooh last night to the kid.

Speaker 12:         01:20:55       Oh,

Speaker 4:          01:20:57       it has the noise box. That's one of them. One of them in the store, like Winnie the Pooh sees his friends and I thought you're the Pooh bear. You do remind me of pool. Yes sir. Yes, sir. Equine diarrhea, diarrhea. Is that on there? Oh yeah,

Speaker 14:         01:21:26       I would have added a died down.

Speaker 4:          01:21:28       Well, I don't know. Why is it just the music? I don't know. That's weird. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:21:32       First we have to understand the characteristics of normal equine to Kate fecal balls, loose stool Spico balls that have excess water before or after the application. Cow Pie, watery diarrhea or even projectile diarrhea, projectile diarrhea, projectile diarrhea, fecal matter or fecal fluid that's dried on the horses. Russia, crime, diarrhea. Wayne, diarrhea, diarrhea by an access of water or fluid in the horse's stool.

Speaker 4:          01:26:19       she got the all the pair on that, um, shout out to all the payer to all the

Speaker 3:          01:26:25       hair. Let's see if it's in this here. Hmm. Braxton? No, not there. Um, did I not texted to you?

Speaker 4:          01:26:33       Uh, you, I didn't see the story. I didn't have a minute too, but I, you've just had a tamer is leaving the view. I mean, yeah, I keep calling it the wrong show. It's the real, and I'm curious to know if it's cause she got a better offer or she wants to tour. I know she just on Instagram, she goes, I'm finally back and she was performing, singing. It is the real, but she was, she's like, I haven't sang in six months. I'm like, how far do you don't think for six months unless you're sick or something. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:27:01       Okay. Let's see. You had a bio pic coming out

Speaker 4:          01:27:08       lifetime called Toni Braxton. Unbreak my heart.

Speaker 6:          01:27:12       MMM. Smell my farts.

Speaker 4:          01:27:16       Were you in the creative process? You know, outside of writing the book, I didn't want to be involved creatively because [inaudible] is on the page. Okay. It says buy. Now. You probably have heard that Tamar Braxton has been cut from daytime panel talk show the real well, there has been major speculation as to why the singers says betrayed as to who betrayed her. Oh. Potentially leading to her getting fired. New Port shut may not have been any of her co host. After on the day before the day

Speaker 3:          01:27:49       before the joint statement came out, she posted on her Instagram that she trusted somebody that she shouldn't have, who betray, who betrayed her.

Speaker 4:          01:27:58       Wow. I wonder, according to the jasmine brand, all four remaining cohos were blindsided by the news of Tamar. His departure, a source said they were completely left in the dark and are devastated by the news since they all truly got along behind the scenes. The lady's allegedly didn't even know a show issue statement was being put out to the public. Also, even if they're remaining host band together to stop this decision for moving forward. They couldn't, since they each have their own individual contract, which causes them to have different compensation Blob, I'm guessing it's money. Yeah, it's always money. She probably wanted a lot of money. I don't blame her. She's kind of the the star, you know.

Speaker 3:          01:28:37       Right. Yeah. I mean, cause the, the joint statement came out and said, you know, uh, we're, we're parting ways and all this stuff and like we wish her the best and she was half, but it was one of those things where, see earlier, this is before she the the statement, I love you all, but I've been stabbed in the back by someone I stupidly trusted. Oh, not my man or my sisters. I am not about to be tried and tested to snitch. And it's not in a good taste to tell you who, but as you Tara [inaudible] no, you're very smart. You can figure things out on your own. Uh, and then it goes on and on. But, but the day after that she got the boot. Wow. Yeah. Cheers. Cause this is a bullshit statement here. Read this statement. This is, um,

Speaker 4:          01:29:27       okay. This is what Henry and here it says, the real and Tamar Braxton have mutually decided that Tamer will not be continuing with the show for its upcoming third season. She will be leaving in order to concentrate on her solo career. Everyone is so state of the Real, associated with the real appreciates Tamar, his efforts and the contributions she has made to the show's success and we wish her all the best for the future. Wow. Well that sounds like some bullshit.
