I don't want to sound excited. That's my level of excitement. You always make fun of me for that. It's so true. I think that is your general level of excitement. You've never really gone off the rails. Like I said before, the during the ads, like tell him he sold out the wheel turn. You're like, yeah, that's cool. Tell him I'm having a baby. Yeah, that's great. Tom, watch this video of a guy getting his legs crushed. What? Then you're excited. Well that's good stuff. Yeah, no, I've seen you get excited. I'm watching football like that's probably the most I've seen you. Yeah, go, go nuts. Yeah. I mean I get excited about like free candy. Every candy's exciting, all cheeseburger and I though, oh my goodness. You know? Yeah. Is You keep it inside. I mean I think what happens is I'm comfortable in a, uh, a certain, in a certain bandwidth of that of excitement and I don't allow myself to get excited in fear of maybe what that will feel like or maybe being disappointed by that feeling. Huh. I'm sure that's healthy. Right? I Dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:02:00       Heres your joy. As long as you know, it gives you joy. I know as long as something gives you joy. Oh for sure. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:21       yeah. It's good stuff. It's about right. What's interesting, Huh? Well I know what makes me excited and I know it helps me. Murder. What were you watching last night? It was another Spanish show. No, I didn't want to just be a no, no, no. Okay. I watched, remember the, the, we played it a long time ago. These poor girls in Belize who were like, I booked through the hammock. I watched that documentary. Oh cool. And it's about John McAfee, the guy who started the McAfee antivirus software. Crazy. Cause he doesn't look like a programmer. Like does this guy work for vice? Like he looks like a photographer that takes pictures of, I was like [inaudible] guy's name. You know what I'm talking about? Like a cool photographer or something. You're like, yeah, that was wild. I know he's got six different hair colors in his hair and he's got crazy shoulder tats and yeah, he's having to go shit in his mouth.

Speaker 1:          00:03:23       Oh Gosh. Why did I forget that? That's what we just said in his mouth. I just thought like just shit through a hammock and then just kind of shit on and around his mouth. No, and around, no, I just thought it meant around the mouth. I didn't really think he did. They say they said in his mouth and he eats the Pupa or he just, and by the way, that's the only thing he wanted with them. That's a deep fetish because they asked the girl were like, did they ever have traditional, gradual said, oh no, no, no, no, no, just poofed. And she was like, yeah, I like how that's offensive. Great. I'm not going to have sex with this guy. Crazy. And she was talking about how it's her first time ever doing something like that. And then one lady was like, I was really turned off by that.

Speaker 1:          00:04:10       But what an easy gig. I mean, if you're going to be a prostitute, I figured that's kind of one of the Kush or gigs. I think so. Yeah, I think so. Wow. You want to see if I can pull it up? That's a very specific fetish. My goodness. I mean, talk about the level of self awareness. You'd have to have to really figure that one out for yourself. You mean you really have to be brave to be like, you know what, I think I want to, I think I want people to shit in my mouth. Yeah. I mean that, that for me would be so deeply repressed sexually in my mouth. Like why don't you just repress that impulse like your whole life and never allow it to happen? I would never let myself indulge in that one. It's real crazy. Let's see if I can get this ready for you. I don't think I could indulge it. I don't think it's safe. It's definitely not safe.

Speaker 3:          00:05:02       She did all the girls name. Nice. They're beautiful and the right stuff the girls want to hear. I think there will stay there for the money at first and then, um, most of them eventually I had real true feelings for him. No, they're yellow too. It was exciting for them living in this big house and having chips and stuff that they wouldn't normally would have if there didn't meet Mr John drew ever lived like that before? No. Had you ever had sex for money prior to that or no, but those were first time I was ashamed, but then I got used to it. What did the girl sit down? This hallmark, they have my card as a whole and Patina Hamar. After that he lays on the hallmark.

Speaker 3:          00:06:01       Then he m he would've don't be shy now and he would sit there. That's what he used it cause he, he wanted to have like Scott Sec then on that. I didn't agree with that. What has got sex and when you [inaudible] and he used to make you should and Mrs Mouth. There she goes. She loves it, but she's accepted it. She's like never had done that before. And yeah, most people aren't told an experience for a man. Yeah, I seem to shit in his mouth. Did he ever have regular intercourse? Vaginal and knows. Wow. Easy Kid. That was only thing I did get. The girls are lucky. I think I was grateful because I wanted to finish school. I wanted to take the shit. He was helping me so I didn't care about what he did. I had to go anyway. So I figure why not going the Hammock and nice mine. But you know what I want to know from us. Got in person. How do you stop? How do you keep from vomiting? I don't know. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:07:20       that trigger not threat, right? Like they must enjoy the smells and the hotness of it and the, you know what's so funny? This reminds me of the piss on me. Beat me. Try it out guy. This is the same principle. It's like, do you want free rent, free rent? All you have to do is sit in this hammock. Yeah. It's kind of a great deal. I mean, if I were one of these girls and I ran this country, I had no options and some white guys like, do you want to shit in this hammock? And my mom's like, yeah, absolutely. Do I start? If you want to watch the full, that's a good documentary.

Speaker 1:          00:07:54       The dangerous life of John McAfee. It's on Netflix. Wait, but if you were a troubled, you know, like a girl who needed what I do this of course, of course I would was silly question. The only thing I think would be really hard for me is the first time when you're trying to relax and to doing it and then like by the 10th time it's second nature. But that first time it's gotta be the hardest. What if you have a real slopper coming out the first time even better? I don't know. Do you think he needs a certain, like a Bristol number for him to be into it? Like four or five? I think he probably wants like a four. Yeah. Most people do like an easy, but if you really grind one out and you're like, and you grind your teeth and he's like, he's like oof.

Speaker 1:          00:08:43       And he can see it slowly come out and it's like, uh, you know, like a, like an old Plato hard. But if you have a real blaster, like it just play a diarrhea. And this is what country, oh, this isn't beliefs. Did you see that all the time? Fed that tweet? Uh, people send it to me and this girl is tweet went viral where she is in the bathroom and she's just like trying to look in the mirror and she's in the women's bathroom. She's filming herself and as she like does this and is looking at her hair, uh, a woman takes a ferocious done. She's like, it's so ferocious. It's a woman's dump. Yesterday at the airport. I had the experience of, I landed at lax and the woman in the stall next to me how to full speakerphone conversation in Spanish while she was taking had a really crazy thing while she was taking a dob. A full answer on speaker phone. No less. It's really crazy. Yeah. I'm, I'm amazed that people's audacity course. God, aren't you fucking, I mean to quote Sebastian, aren't you embarrassed? Gotcha. Oh, my life. Let me see if I can, I want to pull this up for you because I laughed so hard and thought about, you know, here it is John. I live in the house and all I have to do is poop in the hammock. Here it is here.

Speaker 1:          00:10:10       Oh my goodness.

Speaker 1:          00:10:23       Uh, for women it's a great, it's a big deal. If we're guys are like, what's the big deal? I see that. And they're like, you can see she's like crazy. Yeah. Well most women don't let it go like that. Really know. You Kinda, you clench and you let it out piece by piece so that it doesn't make sound. You're embarrassed. Women are embarrassed of their bodies. And their body functions. Not like dudes. Why are you guys so open that I want to know what the differences, why is it testosterone? Maybe there's just less shame. What's up with the show properly? Oh my God, we haven't even done that yet. Keep telling me to go next hammock.

This happened down four times. It's just barely do it and you will shoot an enormous thick, hot,

Speaker 1:          00:12:32       well, what am I barfed Jesus. This guy reminds me of the 10 to 12 Benadryl

Speaker 3:          00:12:40       sat atop Benadryl guy. His base code is math. That's what Judy said. Hold on, let me put this on the drooling. What? Remember

Speaker 1:          00:13:10       what part? What's your favorite part right now and that you're Super India.

Speaker 3:          00:13:15       He's just too cool. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:19       Just Sharon is beauty tips. Sharing the story. Yeah. It's a nice story, right? Oh, there's more.

Speaker 3:          00:13:27       I Dunno. Can we just pause like I feel like, no, I can't. I can't. I can't stop, but I can't. First of all,

Speaker 1:          00:13:38       oh my God. Can we just say one thing now that he meets the criteria of a fantastic your mom's house video. First of all, the lighting is dog shit. He's got the ceiling in the background, the white facing up this true. Um, you can barely see his face because he's lit so poorly. He hits all the boxes for a perfect video. Now this guy is going to be in our world for a minute. I don't like hearing about as calm. Do you? I don't like the calm at all. That part really freaks me out. What? You liked that part? Math Dick Guy. This is on the list. Oh, my fucking head hurts.

Speaker 4:          00:14:24       More calm than I've ever done in my mind. And I know you get blowjobs. Yeah, I'd pay you what? I cannot wait. So back that been hot and Horny home, man. If I lay anybody off second, get me a blow job.

Speaker 1:          00:14:39       That's nice. Really Nice thing. The best part is right here though. Okay. Okay. Just, yeah, I know.

Speaker 4:          00:14:48       Believe me, my brother didn't go when he smoked with me. He put his Dick can't believe how big his dick was. He jacked off for by and shot the most. Come here every time. It's like he's only 49 and he's fine. He has no neuropathy problems at all, but his day gets even harder and thicker and even more coming believes me now

Speaker 1:          00:15:06       brother, when they were smoking meth together, nice testimonial. Well my brother did it and then his dad got hard and he jacked off in four strokes. That's the skies testimonial for smoking meth. I mean you want to see some come watch my brother Jack his dick. God, it's terrible. What kind of endorsement is this? Well, he's saying like you want a credible source. Well, my brother smokes Beth with me. His deck get so hard, he can barely not come. He pulled his big babe. His brother jerked off in front of him and he came in for strokes. It's so disgusting. It's true.

Speaker 1:          00:15:59       This guy is so fucking fucked up. This might be the most fun. I don't know. It's a close tie between the piss on me, beat me gay and then watching your brother Jack, his Dick in front of you. Here's the difference. I think the Piss on me beat me guy. Why he trumps this guy is because he just smoked right before we made that. So you're seeing a guy in his manic super high state. There's like, here's the deal myth. He's laying with his fuck. Come over here. This guy is actually not high right now. And that kind of, I mean, that could take this video from an eight to a 10. Oh yeah. If he had done this video. Hi. I agree. I wish you would've been more hot dot. Now this is a big problem in the gay community is uh, smoking math and doing gay sex.

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       Yeah. Yeah. Because they don't use protection in San Francisco. It was a big, our guest, right? It is our guest. Oh, okay. Let's take a quick break. Oh my God. An SF. This was a big problem. It's like a quick break. Okay. I want to talk about it though. All right. Our guest isn't here yet, but false alarm. We can, yeah, we can still play with this guy, thankfully. Thank God. God. So what's the hat? He's wearing a, it looks like the, um, the rim that used to be snug is all open now. Right. This has to be one of the weirdest ones we've ever gone. I just want to revisit what happened with his brother.

Speaker 4:          00:17:32       Believe me when he smoked with me, but at his dick, I can't believe how big his dick when he checked off for drove shot the most common, every shot 49 the Roxy problems at all. But he's dead. Gets even harder and more coming. Believes me now.

Speaker 1:          00:17:51       Who is part of his charm? I think he's in a public place. Do you hear the background noise? I think he locked himself in like a bathroom stall at a restaurant and he's like, I got to share this with work. I'm serious. Cause he's like, yeah, my brother shot. He's like, keep telling you it's sweet secret. Have what? A weird thing like and my brother shot come. I watched it and I want big, his Dick was, he dragged off in four strokes. You realize too that his brother didn't give in on this request the first time. His brothers like, you know, you keep asking me to smoke meth and jerk off with you and today's your birthday. I'm 49 I'm going to do it. It's probably year or sometimes just beating them down like, dude, are you going to fucking smoke meth and jerk off? All right. God dammit.

Speaker 4:          00:18:43       No, not here doing anything illegal. I don't want you to do anything illegal. I know what you're doing. Anything you don't feel comfortable doing. If you can find anybody you know that won't get you into trouble, smokes and man, the more you smoke up that bow hardier depot, get your big globe from Olympic too hard deck. I will do it this weekend and I'll videotape it from this. A small deck, very lamp and watch it and get harder and harder. That's a prison factor, right? Let me know. That bothered me a bit. If you say yes, I'll show it to you. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:19:18       it's okay. No blue band. Where's the, where's the followup video? Just going to send me this teas and not follow through due to now. It makes sense why this was a thing in the gay community when I lived in SF, because they would have billboards like, hey guys, don't smoke math on but fuck. Because what happens is you get all hopped up and then you don't have a condom, you don't use condoms. And it was like it was bad for them. I think it's not just something bad for the gay community. I think this is for the all all decks community. Anyone with a Dick, no matter where you want to put it could be. It could make, I mean if I smoked meth and I'm like this guy, I feel like I could have problems too. You know? It's a lot. It's a lot. I wonder why. So this is a question for the doctor or like why does the math make your dick so hard? That's why I love this shit. It makes it so hard. It's why the Benadryl, that guy loved it too much. Are you going to try this now? Now look in your eye like I could go there. No, I couldn't. Yeah, you kind of want to do the meth. Don't get once. No, no. Just to see what would happen. It is appealing when you, when you hear somebody say, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:20:27       yeah, kid becomes hope sensitive.

Speaker 1:          00:20:30       You know, that's nice, but you don't need lube or no bed or nothing.

Speaker 4:          00:20:37       Hot White Come,

Speaker 1:          00:20:39       oh my God, guys are so fucked up, Jane guys are, I've never seen a video of a woman doing something like that being, ah, it makes my pussy so away. Well, we played one or two, but they were real crazy looking at the old ones aren't even there. I think all of them are crazy. Like, yeah, they were.

Speaker 4:          00:20:58       You won't believe how good it feels. Good. You're straight. You won't believe how good it builds. You're declared becomes hope sensitive that you don't need lube. You don't need spit. You just do it and you would shoot and enormous amount of Dick Dick

Speaker 1:          00:21:17       hot fucking BARF. Can you turn it off? He's so nasty. Is the nastiest mother firearm. Why did guys, they all have to go into explicit detail. Just like the Benadryl guy. Here's what I want to know though. I don't know what I would have liked to ask doctor drew ready, doctor listening is does this in fact cure erectile dysfunction? Well, yeah. What are we doing? Because we're talking about all these, you know, the silly parts of this. What about somebody who's like, I'm really struggling. I've tried by Agra, tried Cialis, I've tried injections. It's not working. My Dick slipped, but wanting to get hard. Does meth actually help you out? And then that will be one of the medicinal values to meth. Yeah, bring it back. Bring it back, man. Try it out it possible. I didn't know there was any positives to math, but I'm glad there's one, at least that we know of.

Speaker 1:          00:22:11       I mean, besides losing all your teeth, which could be kind of good sexually to scabs, scabs and they do like to pick on getting picking. Yeah. Yeah. I've been around people that, that I've been picking at their skin and it makes me wonder sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of went out, um, a style I thought really? Well, it was big in the nineties and um, you know why, right. I saw, I didn't know people still were into that shit. We did remember we played that one really aggressive woman one time who was like, you eat that shit. And she was like Super Aggro about it. She was a lesbian. Yes. Yes she was. She was really aggressive girls to eat my, yeah. This shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I do remember that. That was the anomaly. That's not her. Yeah. Oh, here she is here. I think this is her. Fuck. My stoma is so, it's just so amazing that people's priorities in their lives, like got guys, I gotta tell you this. I smoked

Speaker 5:          00:23:16       [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:23:31       Oh, is it already there? But then there was kiss my pussy and the wells Fargo now was a different way. That was great. $1 million in this motherfucker. All right. She said that she had $1 million Bank of America. You Chinese motherfuckers. Yeah. Yeah. That was great. That's really great. Kissing pussies. Yeah. Wells Fargo. It's kissing pussy since 1782 there's so many posters around your presidential campaign on both sides that they prefer not to comment about this. Yeah, yeah. Sounds good. Yeah. That's my tribe. But yeah, there's a, like this guy really went for it though. Hmm. Wow. The brother thing. I don't think that's the first time they've jerked off in front of each other. I'm going to go with yeah, you think so? Wait, let's do it. Yeah. It's kind of a, that doesn't sound like a first time thing. Uh, those two are, yeah. You want to, um, by the way talking about the fact that Oh, uh, the cause the cause is locked up now. He's not locked up. He's going to be sent, but he's got convicted. That's fantastic news. I wish they would get the other creeps. I feel like wines, Weinstein and uh, Matt Lauer and a sea crest. And who else? Dustin Hoffman. Do you remember Kevin Spacey? None of these guys get locked up. Was last time when he was walking out of court. This crazy shit.

Speaker 6:          00:25:02       Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:25:03       Fucking real. For those of you who are just listening to the show? Yeah. So is planning a clip of Cosby walking? This is out of court. So He's been through it all day. Yeah. And this is, this one's from a while ago, I mean the same trial, but I think the, the first time they had a trial, um, that that resulted in a hung jury and he's walking out, it's a very serious matter. It's very serious Mike. I mean, you're coming out of court. Yeah. And it's a, you should look somber and worried. Okay. That's kind of crazy. But the latest so crazy is that he was convicted, at least fake is convicted. He's facing 10 to 30 years in prison. This is leaving the court house headed to his vehicle. And I don't know, just keep an eye on the cause.

Speaker 7:          00:26:01       Philadelphia home 14 years ago, a couple of key

Speaker 1:          00:26:10       he's doing his stupid fucking dance moves dude, is just stick on the way you just got convicted in prison. He's like, he's like, I'm bad. I'm doing what the cars will be playing. I have a Obama. Yeah. Yeah. Talk about

Speaker 7:          00:26:23       three counts of aggravated and decent assault stemming from allegations that he drugged and molested Andrea constand in his suburban Philadelphia home 14 years ago. Unbelievable.

Speaker 1:          00:26:37       Talk about a true sociopath. Yeah, he's crazy. He's so removed emotionally from what's happening. Like he did. It doesn't take this seriously at all. I'm surprised he's not afraid of a judge saying that. The judge, uh, and being like, okay, that's really, it's a good point. I wouldn't you be worried like, gosh, maybe the judge will see me. [inaudible] sentencing is still to come that. Yeah. And if a judge sees that they're going to like, this guy doesn't have this funny when you left. Yeah. Hilarious. He was making the crowd laugh. Yeah. Yeah. Well, he's still playing with the audience. It's, he's sick. Uh, it also a dug up. We played this years ago. My God, the guy's Spn had him on, oh my God, this is the best one. And he was just supposed to kind of tease the clip, like a tease. The fact that there was a match up that night between two teams. One was his, I think Alma Mater. This one's super weird. It's, this one is so bizarre. This is yours, right?

Speaker 3:          00:27:34       Mack football on a Tuesday temple. Most of the bobcats of Ohio, the call today from Bill Cosby, Paul nine don't fiber. But there's 10 hours, the Ohio, you a Chitlin legs villas down here and tonight. Ladies, we're out of time and having fun

Speaker 1:          00:28:07       and you know that the ESPN, I'd be like, thanks bill for that. A completely sane renditions of whatever the fuck do you think that was? Because I don't know. I don't know the actual team names. I'm assuming Chitlin legs. That one was a joke. Yeah. Yeah. That was the joke. But also the bottom of a river that was supposed to be, I think horns. Yeah. So the idea is that it's if you've got a live high school or college games, right, right. Have like the marching band. So he's like this is the temple owls proper for such fucking nonsense. I think I want to try to do that and make it my own.

Speaker 1:          00:28:43       If I get, if I get allowed to do that on TV, I'm going to do the same thing he did. Yeah. His eyes are all fucked up there too. He just starts to get blind right around there. Yeah. I this way when I lag, when I goes this way, when I goes that way. And this guy's like, what are y'all for me? I mean, he's checked no math and you can get dick real. Nobody's is checked out as it's bill Cosby. I mean, he's a total total [inaudible] off with that guy. Absolutely drug him. Yeah. He likes him sedated. Yeah. Yeah. Dick oak is so hard. You'll have pudding pops coming out of the tip, so stop it. I don't like his guy. His cadences. He's creepy. She reminds me of the Vegan Vagina. I didn't like him for the same reason. Can you believe it? He's, he's as checked out as Oj was. Remember when Oj got arrested and he said, yeah, well my mission from now on, I'm going to find the killer. I'm going to find the person who killed Nicole. I think we did

Speaker 3:          00:29:40       asshole. Tell me what might have happened on the night of June 12th, 1900 and let's just walk through them. Well, first of all, it's, this is a very difficult, I'm going to do this. Yeah. Difficult for me because it's hypothetical. I know, and I accept the fact that people will not feel whatever. What are they gonna fit, you know? Uh, wow. Uh, um, nailed something. Whatever. Whatever they want to feel.

Speaker 1:          00:30:05       Huh?

Speaker 3:          00:30:07       I mean, a book, the hypothetical is Charlene a pulse that laughing. This guy shows up. The guy we had recently become friends with and uh, I don't know why you had been buying them Cole's house, but it told me you wouldn't believe what's going on over. You've put on, well, captain gloves. Uh, this is hypothetical. I'll put all crap. The gloves and you're reached under the seat for a knife.

Speaker 8:          00:30:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:30:42       Huh. It's all, I mean, hypothetically speaking. Yeah. Do you realize how much, how difficult it must be for him every day now that he's, he's out of prison to know that his ex wives Keller's out there and like, oh, it's torturing. He's just trying to be like, man, I gotta get this guy. And we've seen him devote his, his finances his time. Yeah. Fracking. Keller. Yeah. He imagined that was the sociopathy on this motherfucker too. It's checked out as he is. Oh yeah. He's Super Jackie. Yes. The laughter and love the goofing off stuff. Yeah. That's the sign of a real cycle. The C plus laughter and you're more hypothetical. Would love to hear that

Speaker 3:          00:31:19       theoretical learning but not car for the crazies and stuff. Cause you can't travel with a gun. And I remember Charlie saying, you ain't bringing that I, but I believe he took it. Charlie took the knife and the book. Yeah. Yes. So the back gate, you go through the back gate, you realize that and it was open or broken the whole time he's got a Nicole. Yes,

Speaker 1:          00:31:43       we gay like hypothetical. And if you asked them like a real question, he's like, I don't know. Remember, I mean I have pathetic. We don't, some people saw this as, as a confession. Yeah. That's what it is. Of course it is. Yeah. But I mean, I don't know. Well anyway,

Speaker 3:          00:31:59       I go to the FARC and I'm looking to see what's going on. Um, and I can see that. Did the peers, like Nicole, I had candles on all the time. She really did to keep our overhead and music was on. And, uh, while I was there, a guy shows up. So Ron Goldman comes into the back. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:32:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:20       I mean, you said she had candles to keep her overhead down. Not because she was fucking that dude or cause she's like candles. Yeah. Like people would have candles are all like, man, he's electric bills. What is that Tom? You study sociopath's you love these TV shows. Like what, what is happening with, with he and the cause where it's, it's obvious they've done things they've been accused

Speaker 9:          00:32:40       of and yet there's so like, how do I know? I just like, what is that?

Speaker 10:         00:32:45       No, I mean the, they just, uh, they're shameless. You know, they're like, they're, they're ultra narcissists and they're shameless. So they do the thing that they want to do at all times. Yeah. And they don't process any feeling of empathy or guilt because they, you know, they, they need to be number one, they need to be the best. They need to be adored and, and they need to satisfy their own needs. In his, in his case, it was more, uh, I think, um, you know, the jealousy and the rage that he had. Um, he had to satisfy that nobody else could have Nicole but him. So he went there and fuck them up. And, um, and with bill, I think he excused his perverse, really gross, um, choice for like a sexual satisfaction because he drugged people.

Speaker 9:          00:33:44       Yeah. So they were comatose. Like they, they weren't dead body

Speaker 10:         00:33:47       defied what he did. He probably justified what he did and more than one way, meaning that, you know, if the woman showed up in his mind, he's like, first of all, she knows what about she, she wants a part of this just because she's here. So that's part of his mentality of justifying what he does. Then when she has a drink, he's like, man, I mean, his mind is probably like

Speaker 9:          00:34:12       there he's taken. Yeah, she's compliant because she's drinking the drink. It's the same way that pedophiles convinced themselves maybe that like, Oh, this child wants this because they're coming over here and there, uh, that he wanted it. They, they're flirting with me. They, they, they read the situation completely differently.

Speaker 10:         00:34:31       We thought there was, you know, and he might even really believe it. There's an unspoken agreement between him and everybody that he assaulted. Oh my God. It's so crazy. Yeah. I mean, it's totally different. Obviously things that they did, but they're definitely, you know, they definitely are not people that, that, um, feel badly about.

Speaker 9:          00:34:54       No, it's true because narcissists can't take any responsibility even on the lesser scale, like not the sociopathic types of narcis. Maybe the ones that raised me, they don't ever want to take responsibility for shit. So you can be like, Hey, remember that time you did x, Y, and z? And they're like, I don't what you're talking about. Like they'll totally pushed, you know, Amnesia.

Speaker 10:         00:35:15       Yeah. And they'll find something in their mind. Great that they did and that's what they want to,

Speaker 9:          00:35:19       right. Oh man, isn't that a, isn't it fascinating at the, all this stuff fascinates me.

Speaker 10:         00:35:24       Oh yeah. It is fascinating. I mean, the cause to it was, it's even, it's different now, but he didn't murder somebody, but it's so calculated that he had developed over time the perfect cover to do, juxtapose with what he was doing to do what he wanted to do. In other words, being America's dad being the, it's even sicker that he's, of course the suit and tie don't curse was he's always measuring people about cursing. You're lecturing people about their language and you're drugging and assaulting people. It's like, yeah,

Speaker 11:         00:36:01       he's the Dad, America's Dad. That was the sickest part. Yeah. Well that's because I'll be, I mean, maybe he's pushing away all the dark shit in his world, Ryan, and becoming the moral compass for all of us. He can't handle his own darkness. So crazy.

Speaker 10:         00:36:16       Yeah. Huh. Um, okay. Our guests or guests, it's really here this time. Okay. Let's take a quick break. So we're back. Uh, we were smoking meth. We were, dicks were so hard. Weird came a real hard and, um,

Speaker 11:         00:36:31       never done that before. Mommy smoke meth. Yeah. Have you ever spoken to you? I actually, when I was talking about in high school, um, you know, I was, you know, I went to three drug rehabs in high school and he's just smoke meth too as well. Wait, you went to rehab because of Meth, marijuana, math, LSD. You know, the suburban drugs that we got at the time. Three times. Three times I went to, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Where were you raised? I was raised in that little, I'm in Korea at South San Diego, South Korea. So this is San Diego. When you are raised in San Diego, right?

Speaker 10:         00:37:06       Yeah, Korean. Do you feel like, oh, like the world has a lot of Korean people?

Speaker 11:         00:37:12       No, no, no, no, no, no. Because I'm older than I look. Yeah, right. Like I, okay. So I grew up in Minnesota when I was a kid. You did? Yeah. And there was only one Asian, his name was Tom Roach and the, and the reason why his name was Tom Roach, he was the guy. Dad. He was adopted. Yeah, of course. Come on. And he wasn't full Korean because he was adopted. What are you looking at it going? I'm looking at the screen. Don't look that way when I'm kind of scares me. They're like, I'm getting a prank or something. Okay, sorry. So Tom Roach, what was it? Korean. He looked like us, but he behaved white. That's when I knew about his white behavior. Oh my God. He played baseball. Right. And then like white people, you go to his house, it smelled like three things. Coffee, baseball, Nimitz and Pi, some sort of pie. Rhubarb probably. Okay. Yeah. Was He adopted? He was adopted. I don't say adopted, I say abandoned, but we haven't even done it. Done a

Speaker 10:         00:38:15       proper introduction because we've been rolling. We've been rolling for a while and, okay. Sorry. No, no, no. That's how we like to do a little bit a pregame. And then here you have the great podcast tiger belly with you. Yeah. Your name is Bobby Lee and your lovely Khalilah. Khalilah. Yeah. Do you want to have a last

I know the main, but I wanted to shout out like Paul and John. You don't want Ringo and George. Wow. All right, so we've got the two songwriters. I feel like you need George. George was essential. See Ringo could have fucked off and well, George wrote like five or six solid songs from the Beatles, but you know, we were the main, you know, yesterday. Let it be. Come on man. Paul and John. Yeah. Yeah. There you guys are. What make that happen. Of course. Thank you so much for saying so Tom. I enjoyed coming on tiger belly. I had a good time. You know what? And I enjoy you. I'll tell you why. Don't can I tell you why I enjoy you?

Speaker 11:         00:39:18       Yes. I didn't knew who you were for awhile, you know? Yeah. Are you talking about, I know before though, you know he was coming up like a years ago. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Know I know who he is now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Famous Thompson Guru. But for years I was like, who the fuck is this guy? Can I swear this is the question. Yeah, it is. I bet the Cosby's in trouble again. What happened? No, sorry. We were in trouble. Like this is him leaving court. Yeah. Leaving court where you've been convicted of sexual assault. Yeah. Okay. Just keep your eyes on him. Okay. So he knows all that's coming up is sentencing that he's going to do a minimum of 10 years in prison for assault. Just keep your eye on and lasted Andrea constant in his suburban Philadelphia home 14 years ago.

Speaker 11:         00:40:16       Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's Cosby dance. Yeah. I have a story about him. You do tell us and then I want to know about smoking meth. Oh, got it. Yeah. Got To get back to you. I'll get back to that. But um, one of my first jobs I ever had an acting job. This is a back end, like the late nineties. Yeah. I had a makeup artist and she goes, my first job was at the Cosby show. I was an intern as a makeup artist. Hello. I have the big fan. I love Bill Cosby himself and goes dad. Right. Yeah. Great movie. This is why you guys are a great company. Yeah. And then, um, she goes, you know, he did the way he took his hand, he clawed my breast to the point where it was almost bleeding. Right. And he goes, there's nothing you can do about it.

Speaker 11:         00:41:06       Nah, that's what she said. She said he, that happened seriously. Yeah. And this has it. And she told you this story years ago. This is back in the 90s. Wow. That's not a made up story. Yeah. No, I, it may, it may, it may be, but it's like the fuck would somebody make up that story? Right. But I knew about his vibe. Yeah. Then you hear things right on the streets. So it's like, you know, whenever I got like if I got an audition for ghost dad too, you know what I mean? I wouldn't even show up. I don't want you, would you have not worked with him after that at that point? Not at all. Really. No. I, I can't do crazy. Yeah. I got offered a show with Christie. I don't say her name. Just say that when it was Christie. Fuck it. Allie Christie, Allie, I'm sure she doesn't download this party.

Speaker 11:         00:42:00       And I got offered a part in like a regular on a show for us. I can't do it really good because I know that she's crazy and I can't be around bear witness to that crazy and realize that every day. Another good question. That is a very good question baby. The very good question. Yeah, but I don't want to bear witness to nothing. It's like I don't want to be a witness to elect tragedy. My mind 100% goes where yours went because have you ever worked for crazy? I know it's a rollercoaster. You don't want to be on it cause you don't know what to expect every day. I just say press just by your confidence and boldness and integrity to make that choice. I also feel like being in this business, if somebody was like, Hey, do you want to a job on a show where you're working with a lunatic?

Speaker 11:         00:42:51       My instinct would be like, ah, yes, just because of the job and I don't have the, um, you know, the, the benefit of saying like, Nah, but I think you do and I'm going to correct you on that. Okay. I think you do. I'm going to correct you on that. You are Tom Segura, right? I saw you on a late night show the other day. Yeah. What was it? Cole Bear? Gold Bear. One of the biggest ones. Yeah, and when I see you on there I go look at, he's handsome. He's one of the funniest guys in the nation. This guy's going to work forever so you can make those choices. All right, well thanks. Now if you were like some sort of like open miker and you were just coming into the business, that's one thing. But you are a franchise. Alright. Alright. Wow. And you're a little racist when that Bruce Lee's sweatshirt.

Speaker 11:         00:43:38       But that's fine. This is not, no, I just really know Brianna look roots of fight. Who? I'm a big fan of. [inaudible] sent a whole bunch. You saw those boxes? They sent an unconscious thing on Tom? No, just a Bruce Lee Mohammed Ali. You had usually I should go change Allen Iverson. And you picked out the Bruce. I like a conscious decision. Maybe cause you know that Bobby was, who leaves coming here? Billy. Billy does this. Should I change it? No, no, no, no. You're fine with it. I like it. I think. I think you are trying to make me feel comfortable. I can get that side. You're going out of your way to make me feel good. That's good. This is a perfect segue. First of all, I'm not going to forget that math gets your dick hard. Okay? Order problems. I'm here to tell you, forget that

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       bag or forget about south. Let's forget about Dick and plants and all that stuff. Yeah. I don't know if you believe me or not. Yeah, that you'd like to see me. Smokes meth with a small limp Dick. The Dan get hardly any other way and watch it get harder and harder than Norris. Smoke harder. My Dick get.

Speaker 11:         00:44:49       Is that your experience? Yes. 11 it doesn't matter. We. Let's talk a little bit. Let's talk about the first time. Can we talk about the first highest one? How does one procure math smoke at the first time? How did it happen? Okay, here we go. Okay. You want to go down memory lion? Yes. I'll go down memory lanes. Okay. To you? Yeah. Number one, when I was in my late childhood in May eight nine years old, oh, eight nine years old, I was like, yeah, I was glean adult. I was molested. Okay. What? No, I'm saying yes. When you were, when you were 89 I was molested by a guy with downs syndrome. I do it in my act. Goodness. He's serious. Okay. And then my guys, the guy, I'm sorry, I don't mean his 20th I'm over it. Fuck man. It didn't bother me at the time.

Speaker 11:         00:45:38       I don't think, I don't really find your story to be like a real molestation. I feel like it was like a barter or a trade system because you kept going back to the same guy. Yeah. Yeah. You're right. Well, that's how they court you. I mean, I, I understand when you're saying your card or like you got something like, I got something in return. What do you get candy. But See, my dad and my parents wouldn't give you the other dips. Yeah. The dip stick ones. Yeah. They wouldn't get me at, that's my favorite one. Foreigners. Right. Therefore, he, yeah, yeah, yeah. That wasn't a question. They don't do it on foreigners, don't do it. No. Yeah, yeah. It's fucked up. And so I thought to myself, he has the dip candy. Right. And I said to myself, if I just, you know, all had to do is like touches junk.

Speaker 11:         00:46:21       Yeah. You're right. I didn't have to kiss it or anything like that. Just touch it. Yeah. And I get the good candy. Yeah. So I went by like every day during the summers. And how did it get disrupted? Like we moved. That's it. Yeah. So you would have been still going. That was really sad movie. That's a good buy. The dip candy I did. Fuck. Yeah. So, and then my dad was an alcoholic and he was very violent. Right. He was a rageaholic as well. A man alive or is he dead? Barely alive. Yeah. Almost sad about it. I love my dad. Sure, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're gonna love it when he's dead then. Um, so with those two events, as a young man or kid, it drove me into doing early drug use. Yeah. That's, we moved at San Diego and you know, uh, I was maybe 11 and I walked outside my house. I lived in this place called Green Valley, the suburbs, and this kid was riding a skateboard and he just parked it in front of my house. It just to be, he was there. He flipped escape would over and he rolled a joint and I walked outside my house and I go, can I have some? He goes, yeah, I did and I smoked pot and then I had met a guy named Julio Romero while you pointing at me.

Speaker 11:         00:47:47       Literally Helene Romero. Okay, thanks. Yeah, it wasn't you. You're provably Oreo, right? Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. You were a member. Goes a dude. What's up bro? He goes, dude, I got to go to Lucy's house. Lucy, I told you about this and so we could this lady Lucy, she lived in Rancho Bernardo. It's fine. Yeah. Yeah. It's fancy. It's pretty fancy and you walk in. No couches in the middle of the living room. Cool. Was a baby crawling amongst a meth lab. Oh my God. Train spotting. How old are you again? At this point, 1112 Jesus Christ, man. And then that's when I did meth for the first time. And what? So that you smoked it. Yeah. And does it hurt when you inhale? It didn't hurt at all. No, it doesn't hurt because the high is so good that immediate. Oh yeah. And you don't sleep for days.

Speaker 11:         00:48:50       You don't eat, you don't sleep for days and you know the guy was right. You do get erect it, you get Horny, but you're the things that you, the only way you can, can I say calm? You can say that. Yeah, I can. Yeah. Ejaculations [inaudible] is, you have to think of like really fucked up things even at that age really. So it's not just straight up sex, you're thinking. So it starts off with like, okay, a regular woman, whatever, and your head. Right, right. And then she's missing a breast. Right, right. She has no arms, and then like six hours later, you're just masturbating to a foot. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So it gets crazier and crazier. And then did you do any sorted, twisted, broken foot with blood gushing out? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tom, yes. Sounds out.

Speaker 11:         00:49:38       Yeah. So that was at a one off and that, or no, I did college. I did it constantly. I stoled like 15 grand from my parents. Save that. Yeah. Smoked a lot about the law. Why don't don't don't mention that here. So you were 11. I know it said, don't mention that you were sucking dicks to, you mentioned that, don't mention that hair. Oh, not on the baby and baby. I know. I don't know. But I wasn't even going to bring that fucking vibe and well, this guy, this guy was saying something. Tell me if this is true or not. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:50:08       You won't believe how good it feels. Good. If you're straight, you won't believe how good it bills. Your Dick Becomes so sensitive that you don't need lube. You don't need spirit. We this trip that dictated this up and down four times, it's this hot band and do it and you'll shoot an enormous amount of very topic. Dick

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       hot white castle. Okay. That's disgusting. How do you find videos like that?

Speaker 11:         00:50:36       Oh my God. Oh yeah. He's one of your, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's uncomfortable. That's not comfortable. Right. Is it thick? Is it fair? No, I have never heard of like math making your calm thick. Your promise thick from not ejaculate a lot. Right. So you might, he might go, you know what, I'm going to do math in May. Yeah. I say this right now it's January, right? Yeah. So I'm not going to masturbate until May. Yeah. He's on that. And it's all the explosions in the sky, but it does it. Now. Did you ever, um, did, did you partake in crazy sexual activity because of math?

Speaker 1:          00:51:16       See, that's the problem with your mouth. Sometimes the problem with your mouth sometimes is blame it on the math. Instead you're admitting to actually wanting to suck dick.

Speaker 11:         00:51:24       That's okay. But I don't even know right now who listens to this podcast is the demographic of your people might don't get, don't, don't judge me. I'm not, and I'm just asking, you know, are they children? No. No. Okay. Well then yeah, I did. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:41       Our, our, our audience is actually very empathetic. Very sweet.

Speaker 11:         00:51:44       Yeah. Very nice people. So I wouldn't know. Here's a, here's the thing, here's the thing. Can I just say this and I just want to justify my behavior? Yeah. You're on meth. Yeah. I mean, I'm not a math every day, once a month event. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:51:57       Acid. I did all kinds of stuff. Okay. Yeah, yeah. I used it to get drunk a lot. But the point is, you're not as, you're not of sound mind, so you don't have full responsibility for a child. You know, the don't feel responsibility. Well, thank you. Yeah. That's what it is. Then why would you decade, but also when you're traumatized, I swear to God, when you're, when you start doing drugs and you're traumatized, you're, um, development stops at that age level stunted. So you actually are going into the world as an eight or nine or whatever. 11 year old for like a decade. Dude, I listen to fucking doctor drew. I know you hang out with Bobby for 10 minutes and you're like, oops. Yeah. Emotionally. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:53:18       changes behavior. You Dad though. Yeah. It's not your fault. Your parents weren't on the list. And let me tell you saying my kid doesn't take a dump for a day

Speaker 11:         00:53:26       and I'm all over him. If your parent doesn't know that you're smoking math and you're out in the streets and you're doing stuff that's on them and they should have had, uh, an eye on you, it's not your responsibility. Like, how am I gonna go? I want to fuck with the Dick socks start head. Are you naturally good at it? Cause I feel like, oh my God, I feel like, I feel like as a guy you're like, I know what I like. So you have like certain skills, right? Well, it's silly. I just want to say this to you and I'm not going to go into detail about it. Okay. But when you're young you don't know what you like. Yeah. So I think it was pretty much amateur hour. Okay. You know what I mean? I would probably be like, I wouldn't go down to the sack where the taint. Right. And Go. You like that. Right. I think it was more like, you know, licking the tip and going, does that suffice? Right. What?

Speaker 11:         00:54:28       Yeah. Like if I am like how happy. Joyful. Yeah. If I was never a gay man and I was in, you were gay and you and I were having sexual out sexualities with each other [inaudible] you and I would probably be like, we probably know what we, we liked, you know, of course. And we would do extra things, you know, to, to please ourselves. Sure. I would like to please you. Thanks. You're welcome. I like that. But yeah, he was a kid. Baby kids. The kids don't know how to give blowjobs. Are you blowing adults? No, no, no. Oh my God. You can't let it go. Let it go. Kenya. And this is your fault. Do you like that? Yeah. It's your, it's your phone. Like, so check this out. This guy with his brother, something cool happened.

Speaker 4:          00:55:23       I'm rather man, believe me, when you smoked with me, he put his dick. I can't believe how big his dick was. He jacked off board, drove by and shot the most common with every shot. He's fine. He has no problems at all. It gets even harder, thicker, and even more coming.

Speaker 11:         00:55:44       This is a pretty good ad for math. I think it's, yeah, but it's a, it's a dangerous dog because you can go fast. Yeah. Or you start losing teeth really quickly. Yeah. No, because I didn't do it. I mean, when you're in middle school, he fell off. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like 40th crowd. I can't do it. No. If I showed you the inside of my mouth, it's crazy. Maybe, I dunno what the fuck you're doing right now, but you're calling me out and you're like exposing things. I don't want people in those days I can't use seriously. Yeah. I want to say this. Okay. This is that it on its own? Yeah. Can I just say this? Good now I'm defensive. Yes. Yes. Right. That I have a bunch of teeth missing and I can't chew steak, but I don't think that's from the math and then that's because they don't floss.

Speaker 11:         00:56:37       So when did those teeth get removed? It's been years of deterioration. Do you go to a dentist at all ever? I did. To get them removed? Yes. What is your pain? Well, you know Steve Simone? Yeah, his brother did it. Brothers Lawrence. Yeah. Have you thought about replacing the teeth that are missing? They wanted to do metal rods into my arm. Bone of your jaw. You know how they did implants and they screw it in, but I just said life is better with Maulers get these. You should choose to do it now. No, because I'll tell you why. I'll tell you why I know because I'm fine. Okay. Because you can chew with gums. I don't know if you know that. No, I'm not steak, not, yeah, but you can chew Brussel sprouts. You can, she do everything up front. Everything's, yeah, everything. You go to Korean barbecue and you get your Kalbi and you're chewing in the front. The front end. I have a couple of like rogue teeth in the back that you, that you know, like I'll have gums on top bone. Your bones.

Speaker 11:         00:57:42       Yeah. But yeah, I have that. But you know what? I'm on a Sitcom right now. They don't make it up. They can't tell. Can I see her teeth? I smiled like this and they can't open your mouth. Okay. I'll show you. But can I not do it in camera? Yeah, of course. You're going to look down here. Okay. Okay. Oh my God, I don't up here. Wow. You definitely can't tell. You can't tell, but I'm surprised. Uh, it just doesn't matter. You just, why don't you just be being around being real. I don't know what's wrong with you right now, but like it just whisper into my ear and then tell me you're going to be saying stuff and then I'll go, no, don't do that. Because it's like, now I have no teeth. You know what I mean? There's so much going on right now.

Speaker 11:         00:58:31       I'm being offensive by the way. Yeah. So, okay. Asians listen, I love him and he thinks my people are garbage. Filipino. Oh, interest. I don't because I know. No, no, that's not. Your inner skin is kind of a third world country. Colonial colonial life. We never really got a true independence. We're sovereign, but not really. So he thinks Koreans generally think Filipinos are shit. No. Yes you do. No, we don't all think I'm dating you. Why would I think I'm dating you? I don't think that you're a mud person. There you go. If I'm dating you, if I'm eating and me doing it, sexualities with you and doing, you know why he has a colonial

Speaker 1:          00:59:23       mentality. You're like the Spanish conqueror that likes to fuck the poor peasant Filipino girl. I could see that. Yeah. You could see that. You can see that I'm saying that that's a, that's a viable idea that she threw out. I'm not saying it's true, I'm saying it's, it's plausible.

Speaker 11:         00:59:38       Can I say this song? Yeah, yeah. You know. Okay. You two together. Right, right. You know that, you know, you know deep down inside, right, because you're out here in the country. Yeah. Right. You're on which lane road, whatever that thing is. I never even heard of that road by the way. Yeah. Yeah. Right. And you know that this is real love because you guys, you know, have your character defects and you're able to like, you know, forgive and um, you just love each other. Right. This was the same thing. How could it be a colonization kind of a situation?

Speaker 1:          01:00:10       Could you tell me everyday my people are garbage? What's what, what do you, what do you think is wrong with, if I do it as a joke? Oh, what's wrong with them? I don't know, cause I've never heard anything negative about Filipinos. Call it like what, what are the stereotypes? Well, they're more intense within Asian cultures, right? Like, well, Dave, it, can I just say this, I want to give you props probably the most talented out of the Asians. Really talented and what saying, oh, that's true. Singing, dancing. Yep. Billiards. Billiards. Yeah. All kinds of stuff. Okay. You know, and what are the negative stereotypes about Filipinos? We really don't know. Yeah. I think that we have any true innovation in terms of like creating electronics because that's what's, that's what Koreans do apparently on good yogurt. But what did, that's just the Koreans thing and not, you know what I'm saying? Like

Speaker 11:         01:01:01       I have a theory strokes. Can I hear my theory? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I think that, um, groups of people that they have climate, like the seasons change, what would they go from summer to winter? Yeah. Right. That they have to, um, create more technology to survive. So they're constantly in a mode of creating things out of survival. Right. And when you were at in a jungle place, right. Which is beautiful. Yeah. We go to jungles all the time. Right. Why Aloha? Yeah. To you, my column, I follow two of you in front. Right? Right. Yeah. It's just that they don't really have to do that. So they don't create know that's why you don't,

Speaker 1:          01:01:41       no, no, no, no. You're, you're logic askew because, okay. What about like the inner weights and shit? I mean, they don't have technology. They live in Igloos and they eat. I know, but he's saying me. Is she saying that they don't have a good day? They don't have a Samsung. Right. And I'm shit, but he saying that the cold weather is conducive to people creating tell. He's saying that the people that don't have a necessity all you're all correct. They don't have shit. I understand that. Right. But there's six of them. We need more.

Speaker 11:         01:02:08       Yeah. Yeah. If there was a hundreds and thousands of them, I think they would computers and no one would live out on the Tundra like that. That's a little ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          01:02:15       It's a little extreme. So do you feel like when you're done with him, you'll move on to like a guy are just like, oh,

Speaker 10:         01:02:20       stay with it. I told you that I would probably get with like a east coast Indian. That's right. Yeah. Indian from India. No, no, no. It's close to New York Indian, like New York Indian, native American? No, like from India. Oh, right. Okay. Sorry, just to clarify, I mean, yeah, but like like a Jersey guy or something. You know, it's interesting. Max, I don't know if I've ever met that Max. That's interesting. Yeah, they're good. Yeah. What's, what do you like about, there is a different swag about them, but not the La Indian. It's all planned out. This has been here. What was it again? You said your game was when I started dating. When you guys went on a few dates. You said my game was, what was it like? I pretend like he didn't know if the whole Tinder thing where you're like, is this working?

Speaker 10:         01:03:09       Oh yeah. He's like, how does this work? Lol. That's funny. You pretend that you don't know cause I get it every day, but I pretended, I always pretend like you're the first one. Yeah. I don't know how it works. That's kind of, I would say high twice. And then the third thing was it, did you say high twice, right. To make it like funny. That was pretty good one. I like it. I like that. That's endearing. Let me go to my agent question now. Did you follow the controversy over the prom dress? I knew what I know about it. Yeah. All right. So I could show their audience. So here's the, the dress, this girl, what's your take on it? Is that, I'm going to throw this out there, right? I should, sorry. The drama is that a girl, uh, went to prom and she bought a white girl, white girl, a white girl, but I guess you call it traditional Chinese dress.

Speaker 10:         01:04:10       She saw it was like, I want to wear this, the prom. She posted her pictures like going to prom and uh, anyways, somebody else, a Chinese guy to be specific, did a tweet where he quoted it and we said, ah, my culture is not your goddamn dumb dress. And that thing exploded. So then she's kind of in this middle of this firestorm about whether it's cultural appropriation and all this stuff. So anyways, the old white, so we have to ask Asians with the, I have two things to say about that. Okay. Number one. The only thing that makes me mad about it is she would never fucking Asian guy. Oh, she'll wear our clothes if she was knee deep in Asian Dick. Yeah. Where would it be one. Oh really? Yeah, but the guy with her was Asian. You'd be like, oh, I would be like, yeah, he's killing it. He's killing it. Here's my second, and I just thought about it and love it. I just thought about this. Okay. In Asia, this is how we used to dress. Correct. Okay. Okay. But this closing right here, all the clothing I'm wearing right now is more western developed. That's right. Right. So essentially I'm wearing western clothing, right? Which is white people clothing. Right? Right. So why is this okay? Right. Are you culturally appropriating the white guys? I know it bothers me.

Speaker 10:         01:05:33       Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I'll get, I'll, I'll start with dressing like that. You showed up like that, but that's my thing. And also on top of it. It's like the only thing that I had a problem with like girls that were like, look, I got a tattoo of like a Chinese symbol on their body. Right. And then they would never like fuck. Cause they'll have, you know, are I get it, are riding on them permanently. That would drive me crazy. I get that. Right. It's interesting that Asians perpetuate this, you know, they perpetuate it. They get angry when something like this, this worn, but they sell it to the masses. Right. So if you were to go to Asia, let's say for instance the, um, my, my Indian friend actually told me this. She goes, you know, when they were the jewel in the middle of the forehead, she's like, we sell them everywhere and then we, you're suppose you get angry when people wear it.

Speaker 10:         01:06:27       Chinatown in San Francisco, they're everywhere, right. So it's like our, it's true. You're supposed to, I guess. I mean to further that point. It's like if you are, if you the person are selling the thing and I buy it to wear it, you're also, you are profiting from it so you have a win. In other words, I gave you money to get this thing. She gave him money for the dress. So isn't that a nice exchange? But if she was, if I found out that she was a Ku Klux Klan member, oh Geez. That'd be hot right then. Yeah, we've kind of hardly, yeah, but that, that would have a probably with that. Would you, do you get off on the, I'm like, how did you ever sleep with somebody and the lamb? Did you ever ask somebody to, to, um, to like call you racial slurs as you had sex or anything like that or no? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Call me Glueck or whatever. Are there other, no, I know you put some adjectives before it call me pants phase goop. I, uh, I just, I put out there, by the way, that I hope everyone that's given this girl Shit, uh, gives Steven Seagal some shit too.

Speaker 10:         01:07:42       He's the biggest cultural center. Yeah. I met him once and he said to me 12 times in a row and he didn't see any other words. Nama stay, oh my gosh. Did they go, hey, this is Steven Seagal? He goes, no, I'm a stay. But there was other white people with me, other comedians at whatnot because this at mad TV, no, it was at some sort of like billboard awards or something like that. Right. I hosted at one year and went back when I was on that TV. Yeah. And he met all the other ones. You said hello, how are you? But you wouldn't look at me and go, Nama stay. Yeah. Even your culture. And also I don't even know what the fuck that means. He's, I, I used to make fun of him for this in my act about, cause I used to watch that show a law man, which was the reality show, followed him around like Jefferson parish. And he was so blatant about his, uh, how he would switch up for different races. So when, you know, he'd pull over black and he was like, what's up with job at night?

Speaker 10:         01:08:46       Getting into sho nuff he would really, really ham it up, back it up for them. Asian people, I swear he was like bowing. Yeah. Would bring up martial arts. And they're always like, I called you about a fucking, uh, there was a fire next door. Like, I don't want to get this conversation with you saying you would happen then, you know, with Latin Pete, like Hispanic people, he would start speaking. I know those kinds of whites and those kinds of whites, their heart, they mean, they mean well, oh, that's a good point. And you know that it's like he was on a flight, right? And there was this like southern Asian guy next to not white guy, me and southern white guy next to me. And you could tell that he was a kind of wanting to talk to me, but he didn't know how, what angle, because you can tell that he doesn't, he's not around a lot of Asian. Yeah. So he just said, uh, my daughter loves hello kitty. He said that to me.

Speaker 10:         01:09:47       If I did, I wouldn't be in the middle seat. Southwest Airlines. Yeah, it's true because my father is that white guy. Yeah, 100% and you forgive it. Yeah. I mean like I'm a, a rant, like I get to observe him, so I as an, I'm also as kids, so I get, oh my God, embarrassed and all, you know what I mean? But I know his heart's in a good place. If he were here right now meeting you, you know, he would only be able to bite his tongue for a few minutes right before he'd be like, uh, yeah. You go like, yeah, Japanese occupied and you'd be like, they're brutal people. He just tried to get you to go off. Well, that right there would be a, you know, a fresh of breath, of fresh breath, of fresh air. He would definitely bring up the current news. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:10:36       I liked that, that the Korean occupation of the Japanese occupation of Korea because that's never brought up. People didn't even know about that. So I would be, I would be engaged. Then he'd be like, look, chaps are nuts. That's, yeah. And I would be like, yeah, they are. You know, he would love that. Yeah. Yeah. I've seen him do it. It's, you know, as an ethnic person, and I want to tell people this, you learn how to survive in the world. Sure. And you know, I'm not as sensitive about things as like other Asian people in show business. You're also a comic. Yeah. That's another thing. You've been around dickheads for 30 year. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's you shit club owners, I'm sure

Speaker 11:         01:11:14       saying stupid shit. Crazy things. Yeah. Yeah. But you know what? Um, [inaudible] oh hell yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You've, you've heard all kinds of, I mean, shit in the parking lot of the story, you've heard the wildest shit anyone will ever say. Yeah, but you know what, I give it out to, of course you do. You know, it's like, you know, um, like if a black guy kissed me on the cheek, I go, did I just get sickle cell anemia? You, it just sounds like it happened. It did happen. Yeah. Yeah. And then you would like, um, I'm, I'm also very touchy feely with comics. I would grab people's junk. Yeah. Which you can't do anymore. So I don't do it anymore. But back in the day you would just fuck around with comics. I, I'm pretty strong when it comes to stuff like that, you know. Who are your parents the most racist about growing up?

Speaker 11:         01:12:01       What did they based, no, they based it on, they owned a clothing store called fashion Gal [inaudible] and it was basically like, you know, Lane Bryant or for ethnic people, so Samoans. Okay. But every once in a while Indians would go walk in and they wouldn't buy anything. So I heard that a lot. You don't, by not being babied, they come in, they look around, they look around, they look around, you know what I mean? Yeah. And you hear it, you're like, all right dad. But that doesn't necessarily mean that there are, you know, cockroaches or he did do a list of like, you know, one time he get made a list of like who the hierarchy, the hierarchy of, Oh, who's not, who's at the top? Koreans. Yeah. Well naturally. And then who's second place? The second war? Uh, uh, oddly enough Japanese. Yeah. Really? Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:12:49       The Korean to give them yeah. Because they give it in terms of like economic strength and their position in the world and all that stuff. Yeah. Number three was Chinese. Okay. Okay. Number four was, um, cousins. Snakes. Yeah. And number five was Mexicans. They were like animals in between it. You know what I mean? Yeah. And then my black friends go, where were we on the list? I got it. Only lists was up to 100. Yeah. So they, you know, they're pretty racist, but you know what, my dad's on the verge of death. Yeah. Yeah. Hi. Well, isn't that, but that's also generational.

Speaker 1:          01:13:30       Like I feel like, you know, we can't, we can't shit on them. It's like, that's the time they came up and it's like, what are you going to do? Change a 70 year old guys life around his brain, around you to this. I know you're about to give birth. I know you're a couple months, but I know, I know, but I'm saying like, I know you're in this thing. I know you're semi happy in a relationship. Let's say you're single. All right. Take yourself to a single place. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. It feels good. Right? And uh, this guy sends you a video, would you? No. Shit. Here we go. Would you go out, was this, would this play

Speaker 11:         01:14:12       for you? Basically? You know, we call this outdoor fuck. Okay. Walking Nate, I'm tapped out. Come on. Oh yeah. Oh my God. Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          01:14:29       All right, well, hey, I saw this as a public school. A lot acquire was in public school. Like dudes are just do this shit to you all the time, right? Yeah. It's fucked up. I mean, no one monitored it back in the day. Fuck the ground. I got to say, I'm just surprised. So nasty. Uh, uh, the reaction. I thought it was going to be real problem. Huh? I thought you'd go with, we're going to be like, what's his number? Let me get it. It's like that. It's never worked for him. You don't think so? No. You don't know that has that move has never worked. You don't know. But the why does he keep doing it? I don't know why, because I don't know why he does it all. Just more on my dad is a nice living room though. It's a nice house. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Oh my God. I like that. I contact her. Relentless. Sure. Yeah. Yeah, I'll do that. Yeah. That's exactly what guys did in high school year. Yeah. Joel Green, you would just flip his stick out and yes, he, Huh? Yeah. There is a kid that would just run out of the bathroom at my school and he would rub his crotch and go, Ooh, I got a boner. Like just stuff like that.

Speaker 11:         01:15:36       No, no. I actually, I'll be honest with you, I was very, um, I'm very, I was pretty Christian about my stuff. Really? Yeah. Because you have to understand in high school I was, you know, because I went to rehabs and stuff like that and I, it's a low self esteem. Yeah. That I would never behave that way. I was more, I would do all my sexual deviancy and stuff in private, but I was, when I was out in public, I was so shy and scared of the approval disapproval of, of just people in general. Yeah. I just wouldn't, you know, I wasn't outlandish in that way. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:16:08       I think a game time, you're pretty, um, you're, you're pretty square that square. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:16:14       It's only when I was 23 and I started doing stand up is when the first time I go, oh, this girl wants to hook up with me. Really? But it took that long. I mean, I, you know, aside from the couple of penises, I sucked as a kid. Yeah. Yeah. And then aside from, you know, I, when I was in my last rehab in high school, which is the Mcdonald's center in La Jolla, I met a Japanese man by the name of Donald Jasta Wachee and Donald Watch. He owned all this farmland in ocean side California. Yeah. And I worked on his farm when I got sober it my senior year in high school. And then one day he goes, hey, you want to, you want to fuck, I could not, you know, like let's go to Mexico. So he would rent out this hotel in La Fonda. How I like Lafond yeah, right.

Speaker 11:         01:17:03       The beach. And then he would have, he would have clients from like Ralph's and Vaughn's that pot vegetables from him and he, I was invited and so I would sit there with these like CEOs and like these people that own like with money and he would Katelyn like just 20 women and I was able to choose and I was such a hard worker. Yeah. That didn't have to pay for it. Wow. You knew that was sober too? Because I was diligent about my sobriety. Yeah. That there was like little gifts that he would get to shout out to Daniel. What? Donald? Donald, he hooked it up. He did hook it up. So did you go to town? I mean you were a young, sober, like a horny kid. I mean, were you just like, like a rabbit? We went through like that. Yeah. And then, um, we were pretty straight forward lovers what you're saying, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm pretty straight forward. I'm very Christian. Christian about bring out all of his deviants out of him. Well, the reason why I fell in love with her is because she was violent. I what? I was really,

Speaker 7:          01:18:00       well, he was just really Christian about his shit and he, he put out a completely different vibe in the beginning where I was like, oh yeah, this is going to, yeah, yeah, we'll come game time. He, you know, he asks permission, can I kiss you all that bullshit in this era. It is. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:18:15       But you know what she did? Was she, um, she goes, she smacked me in the face as hard as you can. Really? Yeah. And then she goes, yeah. Then she goes, put your arms around my neck, so hear me out. And then she goes, tell me what you want to kill me. And this is like two weeks in, right. What do you, and now this is where I expect Christina, it'd be like red flag.

Speaker 7:          01:18:35       Yeah. Yeah. I would have been like six times a day someone.

Speaker 11:         01:18:40       But for me it was like a spiritual revelation. Like an awakening. Oh, I went, wow, this is new stuff. Yeah. And then, but it's so funny with her is in the beginning she was like that, but then when she started falling in love with me, now we're Christian. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:18:57       Now does she ever eat your booty? You guys ever gotten offered? Really? He's not into it. I'm not into it. I just, you know, I'm not into giving it and Tom has been begging me for years and I won't. Beggar well, bag is probably, he's always making his case, but I'm like, it's so gamey back there. And I knew, you see how big of a guy he is? Yeah. Dumps or just gnarly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hear them through the wall, you know, and I just can't imagine putting a mouth on the bus because be compromised like ass. Also known as talking this out. I mean cleaning the kitchen, playing the rusty trombone, anal Lingus and Carlos sex is actually pretty simple. Step one, as your partner, if you can any interest in me licking your asshole the next time I go down on you, how would you feel if I made out with your butt while you masturbate? I want that Lazy Maya. Yeah, right. Her specifically. I, in fact, I only want her to eat my ass. I don't think I'd ever want, Bobby does. Yeah, I think I'm with you on that. Right. It just doesn't seem hygienic. Hygienic is, that's where you know mean disasters happen. The crown comes out. Right. I think in the first year it seemed like a novel thing to do, but after five years together, I don't think I'd ever put,

Speaker 11:         01:20:08       yeah, I'm not a medical man either, but like, okay, so even no matter how much they wash, correct. Right. The rim. The entrance. Right. Could be clean. All right. Let's suppose they like did a little analysis and they found 1% pool in the ring, 1% probably, and the wrinkles and the fall and the wrinkles in the fall with ride. The calamari part is what I like to say, right. But inside the walls of the inside of the tube may be even the little bit of the entrance, but if you go like maybe a quarter inch in right, it elevated, now you're getting 60 50% and at that point it's to me it's like no thank you. You turned down though, you turned down an offer, right? Well she stuck her finger inside me once I'm, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Thank you.

Speaker 11:         01:20:58       And she goes like skinny, like Iti fingers. So that's fine. You know what I mean? But if it was like, you know, Joe Rogan's to fingers, it would be like, oh my God, that's a Dick. That's a date which has your diet. I mean, we had Sushi, he had Sushi last night and it really affects his diet and where he gets diarrhea and stuff. I don't get that really. You said it was very runny. No Sushi. It was just 40. And, and they smelled bad. Right. Do you go to an all? You can eat Sushi. You guys go high grade, right? All right, good, good, crazy. Come on dude. Come on.

Speaker 11:         01:21:40       No, we splurge. We go to Hamas and little Tokyo and Gari. Yeah, like we, we spent some Duquette's top shelf, the Sushi man. Cause you said you get Ronnie and stuff. I've had maybe she stopped Nobu. It doesn't matter where I go, the fish, but I still, I still go deep every time it can. I tell your fans though how I really fell in love with you? Yes. Is it weird? Not at all. So I didn't, I, you know, I knew you guys were married. Right? But I didn't really know him. Right. And so I get invited to this thing called the, um, what's it called? Odd Ball comedy. Comedy disaster. Right. And I look at the lineup, it's Sebastian Dane Cook, and then I see Tom on the line. I'm like, oh cool. That's cool. I don't know him, but I'm sure he's a nice, right. So when I show up at the Berbick amp airport, of course we had to get our own tickets and I'm, my manager only got me a coach, but everyone else got first class.

Speaker 11:         01:22:46       So I had a walk through the sea of life. And Tom was so funny because he, when I was in coach, he would come back with a pillow from first class, throw it, throw it up, which in my head I'm like, oh, this guy's cool. Right. And then apparently you were supposed to, when you landed in to it, I don't know what city it was, Houston or whatever, you were supposed to have an arrangement, a car arrangement for yourself beforehand. Of course, my people didn't do that. Right. And so when everyone got off the plane, they just went straight to their cars. And I walked out of my, Oh, I didn't have a guy, I had to take a cab. But then I see Tom standing there and he goes, I just make making an assumption that you didn't get a car arrangement. And I got, I didn't.

Speaker 11:         01:23:31       And he goes, well, that's why I waited. You want to ride? And, and, and, and I'm about to cry, but I'm being real. But who does that nice people on the man. I married as a comic. That is very rare to do something like that. I, um, I'm selfish because I, I also did it because honestly, cause I was a fan and I will, that's ridiculous. No, it's true. It's true. I was like, I'm a Bobby Lee fan, so yeah. But that was still like, but also that you knew that I didn't have a ride, which is that goal. It's a clever of you. I put it together. Yeah. But, um, that, and then when he did that, those gestures in my head, I'm like, wow, this guy is legitimately a great guy. He's the best. He really, really, he really is, right? Yeah. Yeah. Well you're the best as well dudes in this business, especially in Chavez, were just talking about this at the very top of the show, how normal he is and how sweet he is.

Speaker 11:         01:24:34       And I want to say this about youtube. I don't really recall people sets ever. But one time I was at the Ice House in Pasadena and I walked into the annex. Right. And you were on stage and I think you were doing new bits or whatever. But I sat there, I was, you know when I walk into a room I just kind of hear one joke. Yeah. Paul was so fucking funny. Then I sat there for like 20 minutes and I had to go up in the other room. I said, fuck it. I gotta watch this girl. She's fucking amazing. Right. So do you two together as a wonderful thanks buddy for striking you guys. My smokes a man. You're very sweet, but no, but know you guys are sweet people. That's all we try. Well you don't like compliments? No, I think it's very nice. I'm, I'm a, I think it's very, I think you're a hundred percent accurate.

Speaker 11:         01:25:25       I've never heard a bad word about you. Like there are people in this, you hear stories like that as if I can douche bag. Have you ever heard anybody say anything bad about Bobby law? So I have some enemies that term at all. They do. They, if you just talking to the wrong people, well first of all, I'd love to find those people. I could tell you who those people are. Oh, give me their number. Well, I want to hear them talk shit. But there are people out there that dentists that they don't like me. You know what it is though. Can I just say this? This is what Mitzi, Mitzi always said to me. You know, you, you, you, you to become a star. Yeah. You kind of have to both people that love you and people that hate you. Oh, 100%. Right? Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:26:07       And so I'm not really good at trolls and people like ripping me apart like I want to show. Right. And, and you know, when the show premiered, people on Twitter were like, um, you're a terrible actor. And as a comic, you know, you, you're a little paranoid when you, I do acting work and ask her, I get really paranoid. Sure. I know. And I've, I've done movies, I've been on a lot of shows, but still, I don't really have the confidence yet to say I'm a good actor. Right. I'm passable and I've been, I've been series regular on things, so it's fine. I know how to do it, but it's like, so it's very like difficult for me to read bad things. But you know, in many ways it's just inevitably going to happen and I just got to, I have to grow past it. Yeah. It's, it is tough to read horrible things about you. I mean, who likes that? No, but don't you find that the longer you do this and you know, I mean, I'm sure you experienced it too because you come into it from not having probably a lot of it

Speaker 1:          01:27:05       public three weeks ago.

Speaker 7:          01:27:08       Oh yeah. Tell him I think it's even worse for me because I don't, I'm not, I'm trying to break in the industry at all whatsoever and I just do a podcast with him. So I'm, um, a few weeks ago, some guy decided to take something out of context about me and it became like the number one thing on Reddit and the headline was Bobby Lee's wife admits to being with him only for his money. First of all, I'm not married to this bitch. Yeah. And I can tell them, I can sell. It's not going to happen. Yeah, it is. But that's all I'll ever be reduced to is that because it's not like I could ever out credit that Internet, you know what I mean? Like I could never, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:27:51       Yeah, you will. You can. And you will. If you want to like it, it'll disappear. First of all, it being not rooted in truth that you will,

Speaker 11:         01:27:59       uh, out credit that, that claim that's just internet, uh, gossip. You know, it's like, it doesn't, it doesn't, it's not like a valid source. It's somebody saying something and, right.

Speaker 7:          01:28:11       And so the guy ended up writing this long essay of an email apologizing for using click baity headline and like, you know, but, but she lost sleep, sleep

Speaker 1:          01:28:21       over it. It was a devastating time. I should blood for a week over there. Yeah. No, I really did. That's terrible. Well, no, I know. I listen in the beginning it's you very sensitive to it and then you'll get used to the venom and the poison. Don't you prove it? How it used to it a little more? Yeah. Do you guys get that? I feel like you're just the most likable. My, my, my thing is just not reading it. Oh Shit. Yeah. Yeah. It helps not to read it. Don't fucking look like if someone had told me, hey, there's this reddit thing and I'd be like, great, I'm not looking, I don't even read comments on like Instagram posts. You learn to do that. I don't read anything, so therefore I don't get hurt. Definitely stay away from youtube comments. Don't even look at it. Yeah, know you don't want to know

Speaker 11:         01:29:02       if you've looked it up. There's like nine pages of how terrible I am. Oh my God. I used to be, you know, and I used to read them. Oh No, no one, I haven't checked in 10 years or whatever. But it's like, you know, let's take a wipe subject myself to that. Yeah, exactly. It was much easier. Oh I hurt. Okay. But it was much easier in like the eighties and nineties or sixties yeah, of course a comedian because like you could be on a show, you could be terrible, but where are you going to read it? No one says anything or they have to write a letter and send it to the network and you're never going to see it. All the, the studio or whatever. Much easier with that. So great. Have you realize these are people that are unhappy with their own lives? Whoever started that about you.

Speaker 11:         01:29:44       It's not about you. They're just looking for a target somewhere to put their anger and rage. And maybe this person's jealous of you and your beauty and your happy or whatever the fuck. And it's not, and not even to do with you man. Yeah, you're right on them because the thing about it, would you start a reddit about someone you didn't even know? No. About a fucking pot? No. Cause you're not, you're not a miserable can't, this person's a miserable, can't heal. But what makes people let, let me just say that we wish, she said, I know, but it's, you know, you know

Speaker 10:         01:30:14       it's going to hurt somebody's feelings, but usually they don't think that she's a person. That's why they're always like, there's a level of disconnect, right? So you don't feel like that talking about Bobby, the guy sitting in front of me, it's a guy who was on mad TV, a big TV show. They don't think of you as, as a real person. Right. And you think about you are not in a good place if you spend time creating that out there. In other words, if you're happy with like what you're doing, your life, your dating, you don't go like, I'm going to take time out of my day. Ruined this girl's getting life. You know what I mean? Like, so it's, it's people who are in a place that they're not happy. You channel energy into that. And it's like if you were happy, you don't have time to do that. You don't have any desire to do that. Yeah. If you didn't care for somebody

Speaker 11:         01:31:01       podcast or work, you would just go, I don't want to listen to this. Yeah. And then you click off all you would do. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Does it make sense? It's illogical and I think it would be easier if we knew who they were too. It's like you don't want to know.

Speaker 10:         01:31:15       I don't want to know who it was. The reality is you'd be like, oh wow. Like this is a pathetic, no, we

Speaker 11:         01:31:22       get out who it was and what the shy look she did research did, went down the rabbit hole and we asked her fans to find him and they found him. They found him. And then um, he wanted to come on the podcast. No, he wanted to be plugged his own youtube comedy channel. Was it? Cause he's a troll. See he's trying to profit off of it. Have

Speaker 10:         01:31:43       you, that's, you know, they always say that thing that the person that espouses that hate is actually, they love you and don't know how to say it. You know somebody that that is obsessed with you saying negative shit is actually somebody that kind has like a crush

Speaker 11:         01:31:59       on. You don't know how to channel it so they go negative, you know, comfortable with saying like, I think you're the best. The opposite of love isn't hate, it's indifference. Same coin. They're just haters going, hey girl, I got extorted for money on our podcast. You actually blackmailed, you paid. No, but they said if you don't send us 15 grand, we're going to put this thing out that I already said on the podcast that's already out there. Right. And so I just ignored it for weeks. Right. We got a bunch of emails, put it out. But then what happened was I got a commercial and I was on the commercial, like just sitting there and the lawyers came up to me and said, can we talk to you a second? And I'm sending that sitting next to it with Jane Lynch because this is her and I in the commercial, right.

Speaker 11:         01:32:52       It was before like some good money and I go outside like what's matter because we've got a complaint from you. It was that same person that was gay went out of their way to call the ad agency. Right. And to prohibit me from participating in the commercial. Will you give me that face for, I'm not allowed to talk about it. Did it actually stop you from doing the commercial? No, they go, you know what's so great? They said, you know what, we're just kind of, I mean we did get the complaint, but we will also want to say that we vetted you and we know that you see crazy things and that, so you know, you're doing a great job for our commercial. We love you and thank you. Oh Great. What's that? I don't know what that is. Our nanny texting me back about our child, but people go to great lengths to fuck you on this thing.

Speaker 11:         01:33:40       Yeah, man. I feel like it should be a separate diagnosis. I think that the whole science of trolls is really interesting and I think it should be like a new, um, diagnosis and psychology because they're faceless. But there are like dads and regular people who really live in inside the Internet. There's somebody doing that right now who probably teaches at a school. Exactly right. Yeah. Taking it out. Well, it's, when you think about it, it's such an easy outlet. I'm angry. I'm pissed off. I'm just going to throw my hate towards a stranger. Of course. Where's your baby inside? Oh, you're a baby. I don't know. I'm in the crate with the dogs. Right. Good. Lock him up. Who has the baby?

Speaker 11:         01:34:27       Okay. It's, this is not your first baby. This is your second baby, right? I think so. It'll be honest. You have another baby, right? Having his lunch pretty soon. But does he speak English and stuff? He does like mostly Korean, but he has like, he has, he's a boy. Yeah. Christina. Tom said that your ex was um, Asian, Chinese. Was he like the handsome Asian or was he one of these dairy? I didn't even know it. What does she say? She said what was he a handsome good looking at one of these are one of these. I'm broken. I got fucked up. He's very only Bible. He's clearly, he didn't have facial hair. He couldn't grow it like that. Well, there you go. Are you going to do the no. Seriously. What? Can you grow a beard? Can you grow a full beard? Yeah. I wanted to look like him.

Speaker 11:         01:35:36       I already told you my look. Right? In 10 years you're going to do the full beard. Going to do a full beard, right? Yeah. My hair's receding like yours. I've got, I know, but I'm going to grow the sides out to my shoulders and the have the beard and I'm going to have these like weird like doctor strange glove glasses. I like this idea and I want to wear Hawaiian shirts only open. Yeah. I want to be really Tan. Most every. Yeah. That's the plan. Yeah. I like your hair this length. It's, it's good. God bless you. It's quite nice. You want to see somebody trying to scare someone and they scare the wrong person. I think it's pretty great. Okay. Oh, go ahead. I'm sorry.

Speaker 2:          01:36:26       Ah,

Speaker 11:         01:36:31       oh my God. That's so funny. Oh my God. It makes me sad. That was me. What would you do? I go crazy. Yeah, I hate that shit. There'll be a, there'll be a problem. Houses. I don't like it. She used to do that on an houses. No, she used to like hi. Like I'd come home and she'd hide and you jump out and then tape it. I remember you did it like two or three times and post it. I did you post it over one time. She posted that. But she has a heart. She has a heart problem so I can't do it. Oh, that's not fair because if I do a back she could die. No socks.

Speaker 9:          01:37:20       Yeah. Nobody answer your question. He was a handsome, very handsome, a Chinese guy. He was, I met him. Sweet guy. Super Smart, super everything. Korean girl friends are saying Chinese men are the way to go with husbands. Yeah. Yes. Not saying she made the wrong. Tom's the best dressed. But here's the problem with the Chinese guy. I dated, we were together for four years. So we were serious. We were living together. And then um, there was the, that whole idea of taking care of the whole family, taking care of mom and dad and everybody. So I think that that put a strain on him. He was really stressed out and I knew that if we had a family that like our children would never be number one. You know what I mean? He was always taking care of mom and dad, the sisters and the,

Speaker 10:         01:38:00       it's part of the culture. But how did you meet him though? Because I knew her when they were dating, so we were all that's right. Open micros and then she would show up when she'd be like, here's my Chinese boyfriend and be like, hi. How are you liking it? Yeah. Yeah. It's all is just to, trainees gets a fetish. Do you like it? But did they break up before you made the moves or did you yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I got like, yeah, I got a phone call. Like she's single swoop in there. Yeah. Yeah. But did you like him when you were dating the Chinese guy?

Speaker 9:          01:38:32       Uh, I was, uh, I liked him as a person. Yeah. I didn't have like crushes or nothing. Yeah. But then I always liked Tom because he was so mature. Like when he, I met him when he was 23 and I was 26. Yeah. And he was just like a man, like he, he would carry it himself like a grown ass man. And he was so funny at 23, like Tom Ziglar has never not been good at stand out. Like the first time he did it, he was fucking amazing. And so I always was like, that guy is so special. Like you were so special.

Speaker 10:         01:39:00       I remember, um, that I would go to your, uh, that you use to run your show. Tangier and those fellows. Yeah. And like you were, you were the boss lady at at that thing. Yeah, she was, she was in charge. So you had, I mean, you weren't just doing, um, I always felt like, you know, when you, when you fart, when you start doing, you fart the first time, uh, when you part, when you're doing standup. That's funny. Yeah. No. And you start standing up and you're like, oh, this lady is, she's running shows. And I was, I was almost intimidated. You know what I mean? Yeah. Because you go like, oh, you're like a gatekeeper also. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:39:42       She's trying to make a buck, actually. Yeah. I was trying to get out of, we're going, we're going to day job. Was this after MTV and all that? Yeah. That happened in like 98 or 99 and I graduated and then

Speaker 10:         01:39:53       yeah, I started saying so funny that you, and you know who's similar to that as the Oh yes. Yeah, but you guys, it's so funny because you guys come from that world that was like earlier in your life, but you guys are legitimately comedians and like legitimately funny. It's so long ago, like 20 years ago. But it's hard to, I can't, I, I believe it's difficult to reinvent yourself in that way. Yeah. It took a break of that history. It's like for me, I was on mad TV, so it's kind of along those same lines of stand up, right? It's the same lane, but for you guys it's like, wow, you guys were really transcended the theory that I was only able to date her because I didn't watch. Oh, stop it. Absolutely. If you had been on one of the shows that like if you were on one of the real worlds that I watched and then I'm like, oh, I think I would've, I would've kept my distance. In other words,

Speaker 9:          01:40:47       you're like all those tricks, but here's the thing. I wasn't crazy. I wasn't great. It wasn't like a puck. Like I barely was

Speaker 11:         01:40:54       on the fucking thing cause I kept my distance weird. Just just um, feeling like, oh yeah, I, you know, I feel like I know her. It's weird. Like she is, I just know, you know, not played out. She's, I knew you're out there can deck. So yeah, that's what it sounds like. Hey. Yeah. I know you had quite the resume when it came to that. So good. I mean you were over there in Australia.

Speaker 9:          01:41:22       No, it's true though, because I did really work against me when I tried to get an agent because a bag then reality TV, we were in the dumpster. Yeah. People thought of us as like just used up fucking porn stars. Really? We weren't, you were considered shit. So, yeah. Now, now you can have an entire brand and be an a, a reality personality. But back then we were really bottom of the barrel. Even with me too though. Yeah. Because

Speaker 11:         01:41:46       when I got off a mad, I remembered a perfect segue, but it's odd because I, I remember there was a movie called dinner with smucks. Yeah, yeah. Steve Carell. Right. And so Ken Joan got offered a role. Yeah. But then he couldn't do it scheduling wise. So in my head I'm like, Oh shit. Well he can't do it. I'm going to get in and the casters or wouldn't even see me. And I go, we'll tell them why. And they go, cause he was on mad TV. Oh, he's like a clown. Yeah. He's not real. Wow. Right. So, um, I had it, I had to, there was a bunch of movies like that where I couldn't even get in because of perception. They say it's a perception thing. Yeah. It takes a while. It takes a while. And, but what happened was because of the success of key and Peele Barron halts will sass. So to a degree, all these guys, they've shaken that meant mad TV, you know? So I think it's helped now things are great, but it took me a little, very long time. Do you feel like there's too many Asians working today?

Speaker 11:         01:42:54       Well, you know, the thing is, is that, let me say something to you and then there's, what were you about to say? Oh No, no way. I was going to say is this though, is, is that you have a point there? What do you mean? What's my point in May? I'm, I've never been threatened of other Asian actors. I, when Steven Yeun was on walking dead, I was so happy cause he's number one, he doesn't have an accident. Number two is handsome and he's dating a white girl in it or whatever. Amen. And, um, I know him, he's a really nice guy. You know, I'm happy. But you know, when you have more Asians but you have the same amount of opportunity as you did 10 15 years ago, then it becomes hard. I see there's more, yeah, yeah. Same amount of slots, but let the same amount of opportunity or more opportunity you're think, I think there's a little bit more opportunity for us, but, um, there's a lot more of us. Right. And you know, and also you're not, I'm not getting younger, right? I'm getting old, but I'm so isn't the answer there though, or the solution to kind of get rid of some Asian people? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. How do you do that? What you're saying? How did you do that? There's no way to do it. Yeah. Just kick them out. The more the merrier to be honest with you. Build that wall. So here is, um, two deaf people, the pass gas real quick. Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:44:16       Is this real? Why would you put this in here? Can I get you really just foreign isn't the next round when he really stay there for a while. I don't want to smell that I'm pregnant. I'll fucking BARF. Smell. What are you eating? You're eating Kimchi or eating all kinds of fucking nasty shit. And you're Korean food. Does he eat Korean food? Do you eat wild? You know what I mean? Like the silkworms. No Korean food. I go, I go high class with that shit. Where'd he go? I'm a fancy Korean. Are you? Yeah. I'm not like working class. Correct. You're going to take us, we talked about this. Yeah. I told you whatever. You want to have any good ones around the one in the valley that's decent. Yeah.

Um, now I feel like I can really learn from you about being kind to your partner. I feel like he is such an antagonistic type of person that if I come hard or on the offense, yeah, he just rains down. Can I tell you something? That's your dynamic and it is.

Speaker 1:          01:47:41       You need to keep that a provocation and antagonistic side too. You're absolutely, and give him shit. That is what makes us look, you guys are happy, but he likes don't. Yeah, he likes it. I feel like if I were to be like a meek librarian though, he would have broken up with me four years ago. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. If I don't crunch his balls on a daily, here you go. It makes it stick hard. Makes us tick. How long have you guys been together? Five years. Yeah. So that makes her Schmeichel hard. That's it. So it's whatever fucking tickles. I know with him, if I get abrasive and Shitty, that's it's not good for us. The bare likes nice pets and treats and stroke. I take care of my bare that way. That's my natural inclination is to be kind and nurturing. But he doesn't know how to repeat doing.
