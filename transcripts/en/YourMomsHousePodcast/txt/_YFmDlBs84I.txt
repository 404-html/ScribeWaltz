I, I don't not see a resemblance. Right? Like if I were to gain a good other fifth day, those are my old teeth. Those are teeth I had when I was a kid. The space and then that bulging eyes. Easy. Yeah. Easy. If you had stayed after your semester or your year at my hair. Yep. Yep. This could have been Mississippi. Be you eating those sandwiches. You love curry chicken, mango chicken man Chutney. This bitch, man. I know it's not, it doesn't not, not look like me. I'm not going to lie. This would make, it could be my Dick invert grow into my body. What are you talking about? If this was like what? I woke up and saw in the morning, I'd be like, Bib.

Speaker 5:          00:08:59       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:09:07       Maybe she's talking about her panties though. Awesome. She's getting turned on. I am referring to the weather. So this is your confirming this every day for months and months. I'm going to do my whole set with a British actor. When you do it like a pirate from pirates of the Caribbean, like a fake British Pirate Crocodile Dundee. I know the difference. You don't know you're doing your British accent like Crocodile Dundee. Do it again. I bet you were invited to London was you didn't just show up. Demand this to invitation only. Bitch. Hashtag invitation. Invitation only. Yeah. We keep a strict code around here. Not just anybody can get on a bit of a Wyffels. Not a fucking phrase. It. Bob's your uncle in British town. Got All, what was your uncle and you know what? Put it this way, at the end of sentences, it's a little more proper.

Speaker 4:          00:10:58       You know London, isn't it? Cockney bangers and mash. I love it. I could, I could live there. You know what? You're going to love their bro. Real talk. English breakfast is kind of the fucking jail I remember. Yeah, I remember last summer I was in London and it's so long ago, but I was there with you also. Peter's invited wrestle and is a little place called the o two arena. Can you, can you even believe that you did that? I think about you doing that. And we went to Bam. We did London though too. And it was crazy. And he was to 10,000 how many people each show? I was shitting my pants for you and, and Russell would go up there anyway, so it was like, no. First we did a tuneup, his warmup show unreal was in, I guess it was in Birmingham, right? Or was it, yeah, it wasn't Birmingham. Yeah. Were we went to Birmingham. He's like, we do a up show before the arena show. I hadn't even been in an arena and the warm up show in Birmingham was 7,000 people. So he was just like, he's kind of get, you know, get loose.

Speaker 4:          00:12:08       See what it's like here. I bombed on that show. I ate shit and Birmingham, you're a lot harder on yourself because I remembered that didn't go. You did not bomb. I didn't bomb bomb, but I was like, Huh. And he actually, we were talking after the show. I was like, uh, yeah. I remember I was like, is that there wasn't great. And they're like, that's because this is what even he said, he goes, those people were off the boat like he's like here that you did it show tough foreigners. But in London it was a little more like art contemporaries. Yes. I remember it was such a unique experience of Russell Peters Shell because you look down, you look at the audience and it was just a sea of, yeah, it was my step. Dad put it that way. My step dad and his family and it was right, there was a huge, the Birmingham show, he was like, these people just got here and then London.

Speaker 4:          00:13:05       It was like, what? You'd expect a mix of everything to the culture and any reference, but the shows when really differently, very differently. I mean, I couldn't imagine being, I don't even know how far along comedy. Where are you at that point in your career? Uh, seven, eight. I remember I was shitting nervous for you and watching you up on these huge monitors and I was like, how is he doing this right now? I was just so impressed that you could even have the nerve to die. I couldn't. We showed her two weeks later I did a comedy central presents. Isn't that crazy work? Yeah. Wow. With a full charge. Right? Wasn't he charged Jay Larson. Wow. Taped or special? Very cool. I remember that when, when I was in London, I was like, man, we're pretty close to broke. Oh yeah. And uh, Russell, I didn't tell him.

Speaker 4:          00:13:57       I was like, man, but he, um, he had his personal wire, the payment to us. I was like, oh we can pay our, I remember that he was so generous and kind. He flew both of us out, put us up in a hotel, fed us, I mean, and his wonderful brother Clayton and his wife. And it was just wonderful trip. It was a wonderful trip. I'll always be grateful to Russell Peters because he kept us alive for a few years. Yeah. There's a few people, right. And so many people have that story by the way. Oh, I know. Oh Russell. Well yeah, we'll have a guest come I think. I don't know if it aired. Yeah. George Perez, Russell. Peter Stories. Well, very generous. And I've met like 10 other guys who have a story like that. Yeah. A lot of people have a Russell stories. Sweet guy, sweet family.

Speaker 4:          00:14:48       So we were at the country club, it the mall and um, I've decided as a married person, cause we've been together for 15 years. Um, I'm just going to start letting you pick out my clothes. You introduced that whole concept to me. Yeah. I never thought that way. You were like, you should pick things. And I go, why you? Because you look at me. Yeah. I don't look at me. You look at me and I should just start taking you shopping as well. I'm talking about how I'd never do that though. I do. I try to get you to approve things. Yeah, but I was so we went, I went dress shopping with you and I was like, just go pick some stuff that you want to see me in. And of course she brought back the shortest, lowest cut hoochie stuff. My teds were coming out of every dress. I was like, man, I got these monster Ted's, they don't fit. And like cute little girl. I'm a grown ass woman and you don't want to see what we got about to shoot a scene.

Speaker 4:          00:15:45       Keep those tits in that dress. But there has to be a of raw. Ah, what? What's the theme? What's your fantasy? Oh, you're like, oh, it was, I hope you try it on in the dressing room. Sure. Yeah. What don't we do that? Let's go back to the mall right now. Yeah, you're backed up. You are so nasty. What'd I say to you? I was like, when I go out tonight, you got to jerk it. Yeah, I can see that. The phone's ringing. I go, I got my, I got to the comedy store tonight. I can't make sweet marital loves to you tonight cause I'm working. I said, when I'm gone, I want you to clean your pipes. Yeah. And what did you tell me you're going to do with your pipe sauce? I said I was going to check off on your pillow so that you, when you get back home, you lay down.

Speaker 4:          00:16:33       It's just like, what are you five? You sit up, you're like, what's going on in your pillows? Stuck to your head. Are you listening to that? To Matt? Hello? Slowly just falls off. You're like, what is that? It's nine. He talked to your lady. That's how it turned. Tricks on what checks. That's what chicks like. Chicks don't like this kind of talk. Yeah, they do. Listen, I'm damaged goods. That's why I tolerate this kind of tall. I got trauma. Childhood issues. No normal woman. No normal woman will put up with this. No, no man, no, you got me. You got me at a vulnerable point. I was like, like a wounded, uh, what's the word? Gazelle snatched me right up before I got into therapy. You know, I like you. I, I love you. I love you. Are you anyways, I taught her three year old son.

Speaker 4:          00:17:26       How to say I need to take a dump. And you've not been happy with I don't think. I mean cause obviously I think that's funny, but you know it's good. There's context and like then you have our little boy in situations like, you know, looking like the animal. I just don't want him to, you know, to be, to say it to somebody and then they're like, that's really cool that, well listen, I need to take it down. But it isn't dirty. It's not, it's not little kids. I gotta make a poo poo. Poos dumb, boring. I know. But these three, man, what about Brown? Can we compromise? Can I teach him to say I need to make a brown? Yeah, I think that's okay. I mean dump has a little funnier. It's funny here. It is funny here, but we're not shooting up, you know, a video.

Speaker 4:          00:18:15       It's what's the point of having to comedian parents if it's not going to be fun for you. All right. You know what I mean? Okay.

He refused upon on his pull ups the other day at school. Yeah. And I was like a free ball and dude. And he was like, yeah, good for him. That's what he wants. I like that. I like a little rebelliousness. It's good. Okay. Well, healthy distrust of authority. I gotta take a dump. So one day I was like, excuse me? He's like, I take a dump. And I was like, okay.

And the guy looked at me and he goes, if you were to re do your paperwork, staple your birth certificate on them. Jose Diaz, let's see what happens. Let me put a word in for you though. The application wasn't even dry. I dropped it off. And by the time I got home at the time I had a pager, but I had a home number. Yeah, and they had already left a message. I, Jose, congratulations. You've been accepted to Colorado, listened to them.

Speaker 7:          00:29:33       I'm snorting coke with three hands. I'm about to go to prison. I go, no, no, not yet. I hadn't kidnapped the guy yet, so I'm taking clam selling cars, not in cold. I'm hanging out in the fucking see you weight room with Michael Pritchard, nor the football players that teach me how to tape ankles. I'm lifting weights with them. I'm happy. I'm living like a double light. I'm selling cars, robbing people, snorting blow at 90 plus c and then the date time at from like five to nine I became a fucking fag. He students, I had my little shirt on him and I go take classes and talk to people. I was studying political science because once they came at me with that program, but it was called to see you, Oop, college program. Are you ready for this? All you had to do was maintain a c plus and they kept giving you money.

Speaker 7:          00:30:26       I had become Joey cash registers because I had a friend that Halloween fresh, he had a book for all the money they gave Spanish people. See, this is all those fucking dumb white people. All they had to do was go to the border. As soon as the Mexican jumps the wall, they grabbed my key. Listen, no program or we're going to take it to her house. You're going to marry my stupid white daughter. You're going to have like a fake wedding, Guadalajara style, whatever. I'm going to give you 10 g's set. You think about the half milk, half million. They paid half of them. They could have paid twenty thousand thirty thousand married the daughter and now you're not Christina presents no more. You're Christina Hernandez and you walk right into fucking fucking stupid. How easy, how many loopholes you see the girl yesterday, the dumb bitch didn't even play fucking soccer.

Speaker 7:          00:31:16       Now did you say this? No. Yesterday the chip soccer, they went to the soccer coach and he said you couldn't make, this is one of the daughters. Yeah. Yesterday. Yesterday. It came out that the guy took a chick from around here somewhere, woodland hills, and they fucking made a fake profile that she was a soccer player and then made the captain, the chicken ever fucking kicked the ball. The coach was like, I never saw her. So it's rocket theory was they got the soccer coach at Ucla or USC? Correct me if I'm alone. Racketeering. I mean it's just cold blooded and they didn't need to go to Lowe's or treatment. Yeah. Why would you have to go to these extremes and doing this? You know how much money they would give him? Literally, every time I turn my head, I was getting that check for 25 of 100 to 5,000 Jose Marti, Johnny, and he's a Spanish guy that made more money.

Speaker 7:          00:32:10       They just don't donate and they have a fun to sit in for Spanish people and all you gotta do is just applying. They would give me fucking down and you're like, I don't know. I look nice. No, no, no. I wouldn't talk on this. And when I was on campus, I was like a Jap. You know how jabs come around with a camera and they buy nothing. I ain't, no, no. I don't know. You should've seen me. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? I wasn't the fat chicken and uh, and man, I'm fired when the heat log with Nina La Nina. They would talk to me. I didn't know nothing. I bow like a fucking, like I just came back from Cuba. You should've seen me from why. As soon as I hit the fucking campus, I was like, oh, I was like a half a retard and I kept asking even though I was like that retarded kid that has to follow everybody in school.

Speaker 7:          00:33:05       I get to school everyday because he forgets what the school is. You've had that got to just tag along. He's just waiting for you. I was like, Gosh, Shit. I held that fucking Monica for two years and when I would see people from the college, I'd just be shut. Sorry, what's that? I said, oh my God. It was fucking hilarious. When I was shocked. When they find my paperwork, they're going to put me under the jail with those dumb white people. Cause I think more money. I was taking money in prison when I came out of prison, the first place I went to him, and this is where it is in Colorado, they had like three checks waiting for me, but like 12, five, that's how I got, you know, not in the Mafia. They give you a boost. They gave me a boost, they gave me a 12 five boosts and then when I reapplied they said you can't come into the University of Colorado said felonies.

Speaker 7:          00:33:53       Oh really? So now they had me. So I had to switch majors from political science because this is going to hire me as an attorney. My plan was to get a coal plant, political history, history, major political science, history manager, and then get into the Spanish law school like a doctor. And that's where the big money came. That's when they started buying your cars and paying for your apartment. And let me tell you something. Uh, about four years ago, I got a letter in the mail from the US State Department. They Shit, me and my wife looked at it. We hit the drum roll and we opened it up. All they wanted back was 2,600 bucks. Are you serious? Out of the hall that they ain't and they wanted it back though? 26 25 a student loan. I had to take it out for 2,600 for 12 credits or something like that.

Speaker 7:          00:34:40       I just took the 26 and bought a car and then sold the car. I was flipping cars that on campus. Geez. It's going. I'm saying like this was a fucking money machine. It was a money machine. This is why when you're Spanish on, you have to do is go from where you don't want to be. You're not going to get into USC. They're not going to give me no money. We got 2000 Mexicans. This neighborhood. Yeah. You remote danger. We go to Iowa City, Iowa. Anyway with blacks and Spanish don't want to be, because they'll look at each other and go, why are we here? Because we'll get Mitch, whether it's Montana, Boise, Boise, you know those places. University of Michigan, the brass and the Brassica all they got, you know, so that's the mood. The mood. What did you do when you got out of prison to make money?

Speaker 7:          00:35:39       First thing like you're, I wouldn't pick up that check with 12 five I was like, I was like fucking Henry Hill. We got to go to Pittsburgh tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah. My wife's like, well you have a meeting with your probation. There's no worry. It's taken care of right away. I picked up the 12 five and I got a job selling cars cause don't let anybody out. You could breathe in through the bottom of the glass. Don't let yourself, so no, no, no. The first I could sell cars. I'm lying to you because I had to get my license. You have to get your license redone. Now my driver's license, but my car salesman license. So I got a job in the halfway house detailing cars, but I really wasn't detailing cars. I was selling below. What I would do is, so let's say I was coming, where do you work?

Speaker 7:          00:36:21       I work at Thomson grow industries. Six, six, six months in Berlin. I would give them the address, but I tell them I'm a detail, we don't hear the phone ring, so just paid me for the page. So why would I would be driving around, you know I have to drive until you're level four. Fuck you had a car parked two blocks away driving around town. When that pulled up next to a counselor at the light and I'm like, please don't turn around please. And she didn't turn it around and I got away wave. And this is in Colorado still. This is boulder, Colorado. I was slinging coke, selling cars. I was clean, but then I came up positive from weighing the coke. When you pick up the rocks and shit, this shit goes through your fingers and it goes into your bloodstream. So I piss coke and I told him the problem started now I had to wear gloves and a mask.

Speaker 7:          00:37:14       What happened when you, when you test the positive though? The first time they made me go to a 90 day out treatment like rd lanes. And you went, Oh yeah, I'm in this someone cold and get my big success. There was a chicken, the group that would suck the just by looking at night he'd give us a little break. We'd go behind the building, a little suit, color main because I go back then I tell him about my mother, how she beat me with a paper towel. I chick's name was Patrice. I don't forget that. I would just see her when she sucked. My daughter, she was in the halfway house with me. I would check in when you've got until the halfway house you'd have to sign your name and they'll always be a note come by my door cause it was chicks on the first floor and I would go by her door, knock on the door, give her a little piece of coke and just take my dick out of the door.

Speaker 7:          00:38:02       Like if I was talking to, I be hanging out like another thing is she'd be sucking my Dick, the counselor be on the other side. Boom. I shoot my son Ain't good juice. Put the helmet back in and I go upstairs and hour later she'd be fucking join up a stone downstairs by itself. I was selling coke at the halfway house. Jesus. I was loaning money. Really? I was a loan shark. Yeah, because your rent has to be, that's how they fuck with you. The system fucks with you. They know you don't get paid till Friday, but they would make you pay your rent on Thursday. You 75 bucks a week. So I would lend out 75 for one oh two I don't believe it. Ask me where I came up with the figure 75 for one or two on Saturday. Let them cash that check.

Speaker 7:          00:38:43       Now what happens if someone doesn't have the one or two ready? I will fuck with them. Yeah. I just say go fuck yourself or you get nothing from me. I've got three guys. You ever stop and think? Do you ever just stop about like thinking about where you are now in your life, right? You're this great comedian, you have this beautiful family, a beautiful daughter, and you think about how crazy you fucking were, like the shit you were doing. It doesn't it seem like it's a different person. I come to terms with it. You know that song by the talking heads, you know, you might ask yourself living in a shotgun shack like that. When I look at mercy, the Troll, I think about that song. How did I get it? Yeah, so to set that so I wouldn't go to a psychiatrist or whatever.

Speaker 7:          00:39:25       I broke it down into three categories. The first category was when I lived with my mother until she died. I was also on Tony. That's what she called me a, I'm throwing it. That's what my family calls me. They don't another about cold call or Joe, we fucking nothing. They don't hold trying to Tonio. And then when my mother died, it became coco and that was the motherfucker that was just out of his mind. And then when I was about 42 I became Joey Dennis. Wow. I came to add two more years or snorting coke, but I was on the upswing. At least it was like I was doing a little heroin. I was doing coke during the week. I would just do heroin on Mondays and just carry over for the week. And uh, that's how I look at it just so I could sleep at night.

Speaker 7:          00:40:11       Yeah. You know, just so I could sleep at night. There's something else amazing happened recently that I talked to you briefly about was that you'd always told stories about obviously the kidnapping and, and being locked up and getting out. And you would jokingly talk about how you, you sent a Facebook request to the guy who kidnapped and he wouldn't accept it. You're like, oh I didn't for years. For years you would always talk about it. He always made me laugh. And then recently you said you did a show and the motherfucker, he came to your show. I kept last last year really pissed me off because he was supposed to come to Tempe cause he never came Ken. And it pissed me off. Like I went back to the hotel room because you don't remember when you're there. Christina. I'm coming to your show tomorrow night. 10 o'clock all right.

Speaker 7:          00:40:56       See you then. And that was good drive on me. Like I didn't see Joey Diaz and somebody will go, he was there. He just left before you got off or something. Yeah. You know, so he didn't show and I said that's it. This is the fifth time he has to show. Then I would, dear friend of mine said, listen, the reason why he did this show was he hasn't forgiven himself. Worked with Southam. Yeah. Work with him on this. He hasn't really come to terms with what happened. You know, he was no innocent bystander. He was an deal pill. He just got double cross like I did. So when I went to Tucson, I called them the week before I said, I'm coming to Tucson. He goes, I'm coming and I'm sitting downstairs. I thought he didn't show and there he was and I just hugged him. I didn't say much cause we apologize for each other on the phone.

Speaker 7:          00:41:46       I just hugged him for white three or four minutes and it was like, Whoa, this hugs we'll, I didn't have to say nothing was just the way I was hugging him. It was like this, I'm really sorry about that day. I can't imagine what you went through, you know? I really can't imagine what you went through. It was a great day for me. Had a good time. I lived out some fucking wild fantasy. Do you think he really thought, was he terrified for his life in that, in that scenario? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know why he didn't stop. He got in trouble. He got stabbed in the face like six months later. Like he, he was on a roll. The same role I was on. Let's get something straight. The reason why we met someone cars, but then he disappeared for a while. He would get into a fight with the sales manager and leap was very good looking, very charismatic at the time.

Speaker 7:          00:42:32       And he came back in that time when he came back, when I met him, when he came into my life, he had a cast on like RV. Yeah. One of those like casts and I go, what happened? And he goes, ah, I got chased by the cops and I crashed into a tree and I got a Dui. But they took me to the hospital and why? He was in the hospital getting treated. He broke out of the emergency room, kicked the door down to the store pharmacy and took every painkiller and every bottle of liquid covad they had jumped out the window, three stories and ran away. And they called them two days later. So the reason he was in a position he was in was because he knew where the coke was hitting his partners. Coke was it. And he wanted to rob as partners coke and sell it that mate, do you understand this?

Speaker 7:          00:43:22       So what a tangle. Well, tail we, we, when we tangled to deceive, yeah, I had different plans. I'm not a fucking salesman. I'm looking to just take your fucking coke. So that's what went that. So he was not, and then after I saw when I got out of jail, he was even more fucked up. I bumped into him six, seven months after I got out of jail. I was already into comedy. I bumped into him at a bar and he was fucked up to the guilt. He goes, what are you doing here? When did you get out? I'm like, I'm sorry, like go sell me a gram of Makoko and never forget. Went into the men's bathroom and they had one of those pockets gales, and while he was weighing the Koch, he was fucking happened. It kept going. I can't believe you kidnapped me.

Speaker 7:          00:44:07       Tell him, listen, it was a bad day. It happens. It's a bad day and you put yourself in a bad position. We shook hands. We even did a blast. The bathroom, we went out and had a beer and then comedy took over my life and then one day when Facebook came along and I seen him on there and I from requests let me throw me to go fuck. He wrote me like he is shit. Then you know that secret compartment you have in your Facebook, there's like a messenger that you get messages on, but you never check it. One day I checked in, I had 2000 messages. Yeah, he was. He's like, you got some fucking pair of balls asking me to be your friend. You tied me up and handcuff me and shit. You know, I could move my hand for three days. I was walking around like I had a stroke and all this shit.

Speaker 7:          00:44:59       You're like, can we be friends? And I'm like, wait, listen man. You know what? I'm sorry you feel that way. I get it. You know, I wasn't trying to be rude to him. I just had this sense that, listen, let me tell you something. Hey, he's got that step that they want you to reach out and apologize to some people. When the fucking Christopher Moltisanti, he got out of the other Rehab Queens, the Sopranos, and he thought, and Tony's asked him, are you clean? Gann he goes, I'm even reaching out to some people. In some cases I sent some people money, some people flowers because of the biologies and, but it looks at me because there's some things you should leave a well, like I've reached out to as many people as I can. There's some people that are never going to get it. Yeah, I'm not even going to try.

Speaker 7:          00:45:44       I even reached out to my ex wife you did and said, listen, that was a different person then and then she went on this fucking diatribe about blow up about it and I go, you know what, I'm not ever going to get through to her either, but at least I tried. I tried and the reason why she's done that is because I've made a conscious decision that we both got something we wanted. She wanted to be a mom and she had the kid and I got to life. So I'm like fucking then Zell and man on fire. I gave a life, get a life, you know, and I've come to terms with it. You can do. Yeah, no, I got a beautiful six year old, I got the wife. There's no drama and here I am fucking rainy California right now and shit. Two favorite people.

Speaker 7:          00:46:33       Every time I talked to you, I feel like I'm about to see you like you're going to actually make that move though. You always talking about moving somewhere. I want a sense of community. I want somewhere I want this shit. The end like, you know, I just wanted to just want to be regular. Like I don't see a future for me here. If there is, I'll stay here though. I, they buried me, you know, they put me in that sag home. What do you mean there's nothing here though? I just, I'm confused by that because I feel like, I don't know, I have a future comedy wise and I love all that stuff, but let's face it, you know, the, the other side of the industry has great article came out about two weeks ago when, and I'm not saying nothing bad. I think the world would, I think it was a great, I like crashing, but we're crashing, got canceled.

Speaker 7:          00:47:23       A magazine put up that when is it going to end? That it's too late for America to accept different types of comics that the clean cut comic America has all want to see it no more. We've been pounded where they mentioned the guy from crashing. They mentioned, uh, John Malaney and they mentioned Sebastian and this artist guys. All do great, right? Hugely successful TV show would work like that because it didn't work because of that. It didn't work because America's ready for a new, and they even said it in the article. If I was a television studio, I be chasing the dirty bulge on the Internet. That to America really wants to see those people with a little bit more, you know, on regular friends, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I would like to re pitch a show or something like that. Maybe give myself a few chair, but if it's just the work the road and do a podcast, you could do that from anywhere.

Speaker 7:          00:48:23       That's true. A couple of weeks ago I went to toast, so I'm sitting in the back. Uh, Lee Wellington, the guy that runs their, a great guy and his little assistant. I go, I'm starving. Is Do you have any menus study? When the guy goes, look and taste them, it's a place down the corner. Uh, fucking Tacos. Bourdain went there and fine, I'll bring your menu. And he came back with a major, I didn't even look at. I go, just get me, carnitas. Get yourself some Tacos, get some fully and get some for Kate Quigley. I gave him $60 and I'm not a cheap guy. He came back with a box of Tacos to them and a bean and cheese burrito. He gave me back $41 it was $19 for fucking 16 Tacos, bean and cheese burrito. You know, a couple of weeks early, I went somewhere, Saint Louis or something and I got like a fucking huge lunch.

Speaker 7:          00:49:20       Salmon, mashed potatoes, salad, a cup of fucking lentil soup. I tea. Yeah, $12 I told the waitress she made a mistake and she goes, no, that, that's what the food costs. And you come here and when you, you see what differences. Again, I'm not cheap. I'm just talking about I want to go somewhere where I don't feel I'm getting fucked in the ass. You know, how much longer are we going to pay? $25 for fucking luggage. No, I don't, but I'm just saying, you know, you know how much law either yesterday, tremendous. The biggest deal in the fucking angel history and games, that guy, $437 million. And all these angel fans. What do you think's going to pay for that? Now your tickets went from 69 to 89 what if you and Christina and your w two little children want to go to a fucking baseball game?

Speaker 7:          00:50:11       It's crazy. It's four times a yard stick plus 50 for parking for seven for a to Disneyland. That fucking costs a fortune. I'll tell you what, Disney land justifies it. You're going to tell you something. When I go to Disney land, if I turned around and Mickey Mouse fucks me in the ass and I paid a one 19 I get my money's worth and I'll tell you why. You know you're not going to get blown up. You know you're not going to fall off one of those fucking rights. The places, Felipe Gum wrapper, not doing a fucking something does happen before. There's a little fucking Mexican dude with the sweeper with Mickey mouse ears on that comes up right behind him. Pick it the fuck up then don't fuck around at Disneyland every day. I went to Disneyland, pissed off this last year. First of all, I went to the Permian.

Speaker 7:          00:50:57       Listen to me tell you the hookup I got, I got, I went to the premiere coke. They couldn't find people named Coco, so the guy goes, how about Coco does I go, that's my daughter would definitely go see coke. So they took us downtown. Seriously, just because of your nicknames, because they took us downtown. They're like, this guy's totally friendly. Ooh, three floors, a fucking white people martinis mixed with fucking shoe Polish and CBD or with with my daughter and my wife and their kid comes up and he goes, Brian, I love you. Or Rogan like you motherfuckers are the real deal. If you ever want to go to Disneyland. He was my card. I got it. I got a few of you want to call. My wife wanted to go. I called the guy going, hey, this is your DNS from cocoa, Hawaii. I don't want to intrude.

Speaker 7:          00:51:49       You know, you feeling bad. You did say if there was a hookup for Disneyland, he goes, let me call you back. He got me to Joe Rogan package. The Joe Rogan packages drove it or was, it just shows up, give it, everybody gets it, but they take them from caves. He cuts through line. You know, the guy gave me that deal for people. I took my nieces and he brought his kid and me and my wife and the tribe, we stayed at the hotel. Awesome. Two, three days. They walked around. I walked around a little bit with them. You know, there's some rides. I can't do what? That ride that you sit and you see the world and you smell the dirt and they throw dirt and all that shit all around the world or something to say, oh my fuck. Are you cutting lines and shit?

We won't cut through and people want to be like, hey, we're, what are you doing right now? I think looking at, you know, they know, they know. People know. People know that you know you're paying a little extra. It's a lot of money. Yeah. It's not no fucking jokes. Oh yeah. Can you say? Yeah. How much? 400 an hour. 400 an hour. And there's a minimum for sure. Eight hours for scratch. But you know me and my little Jewish skills. Yeah. Cut Down in half. You know what I'm saying? You know what? It was the Netflix thing. Yeah, I took that Netflix, the first jacket. I gave it to my wife and I go, what do you want to do? Disney land the best. So let's go to Disneyland with no concerns. You pay, you go, you're getting fucked in the ass. But I gotta be honest with what they have left. That's a good fucking, I gotta be honest. I did not feel like I was getting fucked and he didn't because every day you see about these companies that are roller coaster falls. Okay? Yesterday on Carnival cruise, some fucking white dude. It wasn't the bungee broke. I'm taking my leg couldn't move. I'm fucking going. Not a cruise ship.

Speaker 9:          00:54:37       Okay, so one night only horse shit. It's like six nights and then, and they make you sanitize your hands before you go on the buffet because every nasty motherfucker, it's coughing, sneezing, touching, and then, then they had an outbreak of some orienting people every week. This last thing, every fucking week. And what are you going to do on a fucking boat for a week? Drink.

I go, first of all, I'm not a vacation type of guy.

Speaker 7:          00:55:45       No, you got to be for three days. You got my attention for three days. After three days, I start scratching. Fucking acting it radically. You know I've got to get the fire. That's why Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday is the Lord's Day. I love Sunday of weeks ago, I broke it. I went down to the stone on Monday. That Sunday night for an all things comedy showcase. Huh? And I ate a bag of Dicks is I was driving home. I was laughing. I go, I'm not Lloyd's. They type of cup in 1998 that Sundays we're going to be a problem and by 2000 I would just let people know. My favorite thing about it though, you, by the way, you haven't definitely set the precedent, but my favorite thing about it is you had the policy before you were really selling out. Yeah, no, that's the fucking baller thing is that you guys don't understand when once you sell tickets you can dictate things, you know, and people were like, all right, it's whatever you want to do both for.

Speaker 7:          00:56:45       You were selling tickets. You were like, I just tell them to go fuck themselves. And I was like, I would leave Rogan there. Yeah, you would. Right. He told me you left, but before I left them two or three times, you wouldn't talk to me for a month. I told you already I don't work Sunday. He's like, you would just be gone. Pop It on, works on this. Why you pop it on works. The last thing you want to do on a Monday, Bro. Just stick apart. Yeah, that's horrible. I'm telling you right now, what do you really want to fuck around? Take a flight on a Monday. You're gonna stay till Tuesday to go to a Yankee game or why is that? I get it. Yeah. You know, but there's no reason it works on this. Think about it. What the fuck do you want to do?

Speaker 7:          00:57:25       First of all, I don't Miss 60 minutes. Yeah, that's my mother fucking shit. I have it recorded. I don't miss it for nobody. I don't Miss 60 minutes for no, I don't want you to do it on a Sunday. I imagine you're sitting in your boxers. You smoke a little weed. If I get home from the road, first of all, I'd take the first flight out of wherever. Always it's called 6:00 AM 5:00 AM I get home. They go to church. Okay, so if I walk in the door at nine 45 I am Lord my suitcase. Set the sleep apnea machine up. Take a shower cause that slight filthy. The first thing I do though, because my ass home knows the compass and your ass on knows when you're away from home. So when I'm on the road I'd take minimal shits like eight inches, six inches, little torpedo, minimal. When I jumped in the Uber at the fuck, at that point, that's when my asshole starts calling me late three days of what you believe. And after you sent me photos, before I get into the plane, I drink a Cam boot. You move. Is that Kombucha? Kombucha, whatever the fuck he gets. Shit moving in your stomach of the plane. It dropped a little, went out on the plane. You drop a little. Uh, what do you mean you're shitting on the plane? Are you still free? Shit. Far to the started looking around.

Speaker 7:          00:58:50       So I dropped a few. Those get my luggage by the time I get to you. But I told the guy at midway and I got to pick a tremendous shit. So cause all of this fucking left lane and get that fucking the high hop, that Hov lane right now, cause I'm there. I ain't got time to fuck around. [inaudible] Laurel Canyon, those pre far to come up. I take the 20th I give it to the Uber driver. I fucking run in the house. I go to the back bathroom that has a door that goes into my back yard. I have three bathrooms

Speaker 9:          00:59:22       in that door. That bathroom is priceless because I opened the door, I sit home and there's a bong and a pipe at a table next to me we'd underneath. So I fill up the pipe and I hit it and as I cough the shit slides out like nothing like notes. Bresson I'm not going to die like GG and the sopranos backed up by Turkey pushing. You just call up her close and you just feel those blocks coming out and then you catch one of those midway ones that's long. He's got to keep coughing. She just feel it coming out of your ass. Sometimes I go to Wa and I don't put my ball sack and the thing you dark shit. Hi. You put your balls out of the toilet. Yeah, I don't never, I don't want you gotta respect your wife. What do you mean?

Speaker 9:          01:00:06       What do you mean you don't put your bottom? Put my balls because behind the toilet. That's disgusting. Next thing you know you're sucking my balls and get a piece falls. I don't put my, I don't put my nuts. I pick them up, put toilet paper and put it on my nuts. Acts like arrest so my shit goes up higher so it's got more room to go down like a missile. Then when I get up, I piss on it and the pitcher throws it down the hill. The lodge just goes in and then I wipe. I throw it on top of that and they flush. I washed my hands and I'm ready. Now I am to the suitcase. I said machine. I staple all the receipts to plant that bad. I can't imagine that your cleanup is easy. Do you have a washlet a bit day?

Speaker 9:          01:00:51       I have a bad day to day goes right the fuck. I was not the best one. You've been on the road and you smashing, wiping with dry paper. I love, I love it. I fucking pressed that. Then I got the hot water. You sit there, you go into one of those little fag trenches. When they start those poppers, you will see that Dude Katie from Katie La, the one that Chris Burroughs, they tried to hide this debt. Real sweetheart of a guy, but they found him in a hotel. When he died, they put two meth rocks up his ass and he had a mass crowd with no fucking eyeballs and they had to poppers and is known as the guys were Fist Fang him. No, the guy was assisting him in the fucking ass. Jesus Christ. Alicia use cocaine and nothing to really put your finger up my ass with speed.

Never. Neverland. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:03:12       The first out of my boat when I came from Cuba was Michael Jackson. ABC. Yeah. I love Michael Jackson with all my heart. I love what the Jackson five did. I still remember that last hour moving violation when Jermaine left and the whole, I mean I lived through all that shit. I watched both episodes with an open mind and most people, most Americans won't. People Watch that like, wow, I was the parents fault. Well again, we got, have you ever worked on a kid show animated? Have you worked on the kid show? I get Disney show. No, I didn't know what Hollywood was about. Two, I worked at Disney show.

Speaker 7:          01:03:54       It's not about the kids, it's about the moms. Okay, so the mom show up, they got the kids, the kids are acting. You look at the moms at rehearsal Tuesday, Wednesday at the table, read the whole thing, blocking on Thursday on shoot day. Christine's, you got to look at these fucking cleavages out. Miniskirt the registered around tits are out there here and made up, blow out. Everybody wants to be Kim Kardashian. And you're looking at them and they're living their life to that children. You know, I would talk to the moms and they would go, oh, we live in Weehawken because our kid was doing a play in New York. And I go, where do you usually live in? Look, come from Kentucky. And I'm like, where's your heart? He's in homework. We're out here living in Burbank in a studio apartment, trying to get roles, you know, and it was really like, it really showed me like, what makes a woman?

Speaker 7:          01:04:56       I could see a kid, but now you're pushing it. They were like, pistol Pete's father, pistol Pete Maravich. It would beat them if they lost like that, that we're talking about. Never, never land. When I got, when I did the longest yard, I got caught up when it's very tough, not too caught up. Went with like the Hollywood thing. Very tough with you say cut and everybody's laughing and you do the same thing six times and people laugh and people blow smoke up your ass and this movie comes out, you know, blow up. You know, you buy it at one time when this career, you bought it at one time you bought it and then it's gone away. You see it for what it is that they're all a bunch of motherfuckers. You know when you watch the Elvis documentary, he says, it is old father.

Speaker 7:          01:05:46       I said, we realize he was damaged goods. Our role, our role, our job was just to put 'em out bed so we died. Yeah, the captain, what were the criminals and it's about his own fucking where pieces of meat. We're replaceable. It's six years on new terms ago. It shows up in Montreal. Yeah. Nobody's returning your calls. That's, but we get caught up when you watch the documentary a, I do believe both those boys be, I feel bad for the parents because it was just taken dick, if we're in the business and we got taken, think about it. What would you feel? What would you feel like right now? Fucking, I don't even know was a mega star like that anymore. Took interest in your child and say your child had talent and we're going to take him to the top and I got a rehearsal studio right down the corner. Drop him off every day at three. You're going to come for a few days then.

Speaker 4:          01:06:45       I know, but knowing what we know about this business, like I, I would never put my children in the show business. Like who wants to have her kid working when they're four or five years old? It's not cool. I don't want that. Life is terrible. Take come to my child. I don't want it. They can't see it. But when you're from some, but they weren't. These people were from California. No one was from Australia

Speaker 7:          01:07:06       valley and the other ones were from California. Yeah, right. But still Michael Jackson come at the house and see me crazy. You got to remember he bought her a house. He loaned them money for AF. Yeah. And then he told her was a gift that they want the money back. There's so many different variables. I'm not mad at the parents. It happens to us as at the table when we come here, they give us a show. We actually buy, you know, how many people have we seen come and go this time? Oh my God. What do you think they left here with a sober mind. Everything is for me. No. Yeah. They left here with a smack to their fucking face. Yeah. How many chicks really did come in and blow? Nasty guys didn't get anything I could think of that have them, that suck my dick and then how to handle them. Well, I'll get you a spot at the fucking comedy store and next [inaudible] helmet got behind the car.

Speaker 4:          01:08:01       Another one reminds me of this topic. We just had, remember that that executive at what studio? And he was promising. Oh yeah. Warner brothers. Yeah. And he was promising these girls like, Hey, if you fuck me, I'm going to give you roles and this and that. And he never followed

Speaker 9:          01:08:16       through. And we were like, that's so cruel. Like you're a multimillionaire. You don't need to spit that game. You know what I'm saying? Like you could have just gotten your dick sucked just by being rich.

Speaker 7:          01:08:26       What if you have that vulnerable? Yeah, I went to a great place, but after a couple seeds and then they find that you were staying though. I had these girls showed up at the store. I'm like, Oh my God, you're so great. You have an agent. They'd never seen that as a college girls that watched met live. Yeah. I think Betty could clamp was shit. They love Reese Witherspoon, whatever. I could do a restart something.

Speaker 9:          01:08:52       The most popular girl, they come out here and you're up against all the popular girls and Reese Witherspoon's been enacting since she was a baby. Yet

Speaker 7:          01:09:02       you've got that and they come out here when they get caught up and agents, and I can't tell you how many I could name like four times a woman look me in the eye and said to me, I'll do anything to get an agent if you get me with your agent. And this is when I was like, what fucking low level studio. You call them boutique agents. Really? And I would go, anything, anything. Oh my God, I really want to be an actress. Ever since I saw the Hollywood sign, you know, they be able to have the right reasons. They don't even know why they're doing it. They just think that they're going to go from zero to four. How many fucking dicks? Marilyn Monroe side.

Speaker 9:          01:09:45       Oh God, I wish I would've done that. Jay. Ryan a fucking train on mountain. They fucked the eight. They fucked her to bet that didn't shadow with something. So she would shut the fuck up. She shot. She fucked so many people they killed just to listen to you can't, you can't. Harvey must've seen it to me is, well he was like three everybody fuck this shit out. They were passing her around all the way to the press. Man, this is depressed as fuck. No Shit. No sure. Those are the ones they want. They don't want the ones that are five Beta Kappas. You're not going to put it over on there. Yeah. That

Speaker 7:          01:10:28       grows at a goal you can go to. You ever go to even do a TV show or movie that you go to the party and you're just really want to fucking be there and you see people from the movie, you wave at them. But then there's this other 60 women that are, that that black, they're white, they're Chinese, they got Afros, they got tight suits on, and at one point in the night, the hors d'oeuvre comes by and just look at them and go, I don't remember me from the movie. I'm Joey, and though I wasn't in the movie, I'm just here because my from he gives me other sub deck. Yeah. When people telling me I'm there to support Tom, you're here to suck Dick. You're here to suck a dick in one form or another. You know, you have a showcase. The old days, if you have a showcase at the comedy store, sure.

Speaker 7:          01:11:16       They put an asterisk next to your name and comics would just go down and see what an asterick and they would wait till you were talking to somebody, come over and crack a joke. Let me do you. And you're like, get the fuck Outta here. Because they knew you had a showcase then they were trying to talk to whoever. You know, we will. We would, we had, we are instinctively whores when we first move here. It's not our fault. We're just horse, not literally whores sucking Dick, but we would do and put up with things we would usually put up with. Are you going up 12th you know, but it's nine o'clock he's going to be up about midnight, shit like that. And we buy into it. There's one day that you wake up and go, this is not going to happen no more. Right, and for me it was an Arby's commercial.

Speaker 7:          01:12:08       I did a Hardee's, what's the other side of the Hardee's? Carl's Jr. I did three commercials and the three weeks in a row, three nationals and I was clean and sober from coke and when I got clean I remember saying to myself, you know what? Before I was a fucking comic, I was a man, but slapping people enough with that dumb Hollywood game, if you got a common theme that I'm going to give it to you. And I remember having that frame thought, getting the Hardee's commercial and going down to Long Beach. The call was midnight and I play a mobster with this other guy and they put us in an SUV. We got to pull up to shoot a guy, but when we got there, the guy was eat the chicken Parmesan sandwich and there was saw something mistake. So he was passed out. We thought somebody got there first. So we get there. But my profile before I got the commercial like you're working with, you know Antonio and Gillini, this tremendous director, you know, he gets there with the assistant next to him. He's got the pepe Le Pew Hat, the shirt role. Does he see this tattoo? You know my new philosophy is if I could tell you the director, I don't want to be in the movie.

Speaker 9:          01:13:21       Yeah. If you've got that direct, the garb on and all that shit. I'm done with you. Yeah, I heard that man. If you got the costume on, I don't want to work with your fucking Douche bag. I don't want to work. So what happens on this? This,

Speaker 7:          01:13:35       Oh my God, I'm off the powder. I'm just, I'm referring, I'm a fucking savage. I get made pressers up and this is mafia outfits. They put lights inside the car so they would disconnect. They put the lights on there must have disconnected the break. So our job was to drive like 30 yards, stop, slammed the door and walk towards the car. Every time I slammed the door, the car kept rowing and they would take cut and the guy would go, what the hell is going on? Put the brakes on. And I'm like, I put the brakes, the brakes on it. On, sorry, let's do it again and again. And I put the emergency, I'm like, get out the fucking cars rolling. This happened like two or three times and the director kept saying, I don't know what the fuck is going on with youtube, but somebody better figure it out. And finally the guys went in there and tried to fix it and again, I put it on and the guy goes, you're not pulling it hard enough. You fucking dummy.

Speaker 7:          01:14:38       I turned around, it was about two in the morning and I go, what'd you say? Motherfucker just froze time. And I walked towards my, or would you say mother fuck. I'm like, listen, I'm not one of your punk white fucking frenzy. I'll knock you the fuck out right now. You ran from me. The assistant and the PA took them and ran them into his trailer and he closed himself in there and I walked to the trail. I've banged on the door. I go, you're not getting away with this one bitch. I go, come on here and talk to me like a man. He goes, I'm on the phone with the whatever. We're replacing you. I go, it's two in the morning. You dumb motherfucker. You're never going to replace me at two in the morning. Come out here and like a man. Then the came out, he said, walk away from the door.

Speaker 7:          01:15:23       I go and then the first day they came out and go, come calling the police to go call the police. Well, the police, what are you going to do? Nothing happening. It's just two men trying to talk. I go, come out of the fucking trailer and be a man. Then there's little faggy assistant came out with the feather in her hat and then he finally opened the door and he goes, nobody has ever spoken to about it. I go, that's what your problem is. We all put our pants, we all put our pants on one leg at a time. You respect me and I fucked him. Respect to you. That's what men do. But they blown you off to smoke up your ass assistant and all his people there. And I'm going, you got to act like a fucking man. Okay. You don't talk to people that way.

Speaker 7:          01:16:06       You talk to people like a fucking man. Why come from you get hit and that's it. Let's finish this fucking commercial. Let's go. And I turned around like I follow me very meekly. We'd get like eight takes and he caught me, you can go home now. And I walked away and I walked up and put my hand down and he was still a con teeth. He, you know, faculty put his hand down and I go, you got to act like a man. So okay, you got to be a man. Forget this director Shit. And as I got to the car, his assistant came up to me and she goes, thank you very much. Sometimes people forget what our main job is to be human beings. Thank you. And she goes, I'm happy you did that. I'm very happy you did that. You scared him to death.

Speaker 7:          01:16:50       I fucked him. Told him I was bagging him on the trail. It will come on here like a man. No fighting. This is about two men talking. Yeah, come out here but you don't call me a fucking dummy bitch. No, don't even ever say that to somebody on the set. You don't pay us enough. Yeah. And he worked with me like, like I said, it took one more here. He was saying we're going to work all night. Yeah. So just do the fucking cuts. Just do the trick and us, I'm not going to sit here all night and do fucking takes. Ah. You know, like when I did go daddy, they made me call the pizza up a thousand times. I said, that's it no more. If you didn't get it by now, go back to USD fucking acting school and got a camera again. And they all looked at me and I fucking went and sat down. That's it enough with this bullshit. You want to kill four hours, be throwing the pizza. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:17:37       go fuck yourself. You're never going to use this film shit.

Speaker 7:          01:17:41       And then you see the thing of this, you move on into like, I was there for six fucking hours.

Speaker 4:          01:17:46       No, for what? This business is so wasteful. This is the only business where everything is done last minute and they waste a tremendous amount of money. It's just gone down the fucking toilet. Oh we, we got to, we need a lama for this thing tomorrow. Let's spend 50 grand. Those find the wrangler. Let's change the set. You know when you are working on various projects, right? They don't have a call time for you until last fucking minute. So disrespect, fly him in and then it's like, God,

Speaker 1:          01:18:14       the waste money, we're going to, you're working all day tomorrow. Okay. And then you get through like Jackie, you're not going to work then like what? Yeah, I find that we'd decided we'd move some things around and we're gonna, we found this up. We're going, we're want to do this shot we got, but we got to bring in this special light and it's like 45 grand to use it. And you're like, yeah, it is very like just impulsive last minute and we're going to do this thing like, oh, okay. You don't, you don't waste a lot of, it's a fucking thinking about that in advance. Nothing bothers me more than that shit. Yeah. Ah, how do you feel, by the way, this is totally off topic, but we've been having this debate about, she, she taught our son who's three years old to say, I have to take a dump. And I'm like, come on now. He's going to say it. Teachers. Yeah, the smile on his face. I think it's funny. It's funny. It's funny to think about like people being like, what, you know, like adults treating him differently because he speaking Kras, here's the deal. Yeah. You don't why I got a potty mouth. Why? Because after three they thought it was cute. They really thought it was cute. But what it is is it's unrecoverable, what's that word I wrote? Everybody. Vocable vocable yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:19:27       So once it goes down that path, oh, I am teaching math. I tell mercy like when she takes a shower, when she comes out, like, what did you wash your monkey? She'll look at me. I go, did you wash your muffling? She'll say, yes, Daddy. And she knows, right? I don't think she goes to school and says, Hey, I washed my monkey yet. Even besides that, I'm no fucking angel either. Yeah. But I don't curse around that.

Speaker 4:          01:19:51       No. Well, listen, that's where I draw the line. I, we don't drop f bombs. I don't say shit or go fuck yourself. None like that. But I feel like dump is permissible. It's not really a bad word. It's, it's crass. As my daughter would call it. She say potty words that Heidi, she's sick.

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       Bollywood's I'm like, what type of words? You know, she won't say, she's heard me. I slept with a shift from dying. It's impossible, but nothing else like that. Nothing. Now I bet with your history of being an animal and the coke days, you've been with some real fucking animals yourself, chicks at are real fucking questionable. Right. There's definitely been some, but I want to show you this clip of this chick and tell me if she could get it back. And Joey Diaz is crazy days. Go ahead.

Speaker 10:         01:20:44       [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          01:20:58       I mean you could tell by her eyes that other just chicks off. She would leave you alone like you die. She's a stalker. Look good. Look at it. Everybody molested her. Her father, the neighbor. Look at it. Look in her eyes. She's got crazy eyes. Everybody. Everybody. Everybody. She bumped into did something to this. Grow a finger in her ass. They through holy water around. Look at it. She's fucking retarded. How the fuck are you going to lick a fucking toilet? See what the fuck man. That she'd be fun cause you could just tell, listen, stick your tongue up my ass and target. I'm going to jerk off like your hair and your all and she'd be like, all right. All right. Yeah, that's a good, that's what the animal looks at Tom. You're going to have an itchy assholes for two years. You'd have to go to the doctor and they got to put you in stirpes like they do the women in open public camera put corn starch powder in your ass because you got rashes and shit. That's a nasty bitch. Take that off. I'd rather see a woman he shit or something like that. Don't make a fuck. Yes. One of the nastiest things, I've never been with animals like I throw them out or give them a lethal lethal doses optimally shut them the fuck up for an hour. I mean, isn't that one of the grossest things you seen? We've seen a lot of shit on the show

Speaker 1:          01:22:28       be like top worst. Yeah. And by the way, I respect her. I think she's just cool.

Speaker 9:          01:22:34       What is the other respect? Respecting Brown. That's who fucking the owner of new English. Who the fuck do you see a girl like that?

Speaker 7:          01:29:02       10 years was the episode he had about the guy, about sleep. I that I was thinking about that episode yesterday. I was, that episode changed my life and that book changed my life. What is it so people can get it, uh, what's the book? Sleeping while we sleep? Something weird. I learned a lot from when I had the sleep apnea, but now I've taken up to a level. I got the same problem top man, you got home at 11 o'clock for the comedy store. Eat an apple, eat a banana. You try to unwind. You're not just going to go in and kick your shoes off and way down two spots at the store. You go down, you're going to have a computer and look at Twitter, thanked them for coming to the store. You look at your, I did good today. I got to change this joke around and then you have that low and I'm the type of guy, if I go in the living room and man on fires, yeah, that's it.

Speaker 7:          01:29:55       I get up, get the fucking cold cuts out. Yeah, I got a coke zero and I watch the fucking movie. I go during commercial for our stop and I go hit the bong and the things and now it's 10 to two and now we're at two o'clock. Guess what's coming on. Smoke gave the man. Now I gotta sit here and watch this fucking thing because how am I going to go to sleep now? How old are fucking my had to go lay down while I'm fucking police in class died and left me boss. Yeah, yeah. No, that was going on that I wasn't on the road and splash resigned, junk canvas best John Candy was just brilliant and on the road you'll watch it until like four C I love, I love flying in Thursday. Yeah. Doing that show Friday and then that Friday you just tell people like, people were like, what are you doing tomorrow? Do you want to do lunch at a little? Listen, go away.

Speaker 7:          01:30:53       I'll call you when I wake up because I'm going to go back and I'm going to have a film festival. Yeah, no, I got a little bit of food. I get those protein bars and I put them in my sax with those protein milkshakes. I put them in my sock and that's the only night that I go off the reservation. You know, sometimes you get so fucking high, like I don't do the vapor pens. At home. I only bring them on the roads. So when I go on the road with them, I get high in my room, you know, sometimes whatever. But when I'm home Jack, there's no 10 30 fucking main shows from my world though. That shit, because that starts at 11 it next, you know, I'm walking to my house at 1215 that meets to add in my house. You wake up at six 15 whether you like it or not Friday.

Speaker 7:          01:31:40       So in our position we got to get eight me. If I could do seven 1130 12 to seven sometimes I'll sleep till seven get up, jump in the shower, I have a cup of coffee, talk with her for 1520 minutes, and then maybe they go to school and I write for an hour. They're not going to kick at night. I do that shit early. You get it out of the way, you know? But the sleep has been asleep is fucking huge. If you're dieting and you're not sleeping, you know, losing weight. If you lift the weights and you're not sleeping, you're not fucking retiring. It backup. So if anything, I blame it on sleep. Yeah, that, that episode, by the way, I don't know what it is, but if you guys, if you just Google your rug and sleep expert, this guy in the, in the first few minutes of that episode, that guy has you thinking about, is that episode 1109?

Speaker 7:          01:32:33       That's what it is. Yeah. It's jre 11 or nine, I forget. I don't know what the guy's name. He's a sleep expert and a neuroscientist man. That, that dude, in the first few minutes he starts explaining what happens to your brain and grabbing people without having great sleep. Um, but that is asleep. Put dirty. Totally separate. Really for 27, I did blow out what our own, uh, Chris, who's working here? That was his professor in school. What's it really? Yeah, that was definitely my professor Walker. Okay. What's the name of the book? You know the name of the boat is the name of the book. I didn't catch that. Um, sleep. Look Up Matt Walker. Yeah. So I got to watch everything because if I drink too much water, then I'm up and down as the base thing. So now if I go to bed 1130 while we sleep, I could sleep till six so I pee.

Speaker 7:          01:33:30       I don't have nothing going for my blog. I go back, close my eyes, and I try to get one more out. The last two nights I've slept so well and I feel different. Yeah, that's, that's either you can eat well, you could do everything. But if you'll remember when I first started the podcast, I was doing it at 6:00 AM I was telling Tom that, Christine, you want to be on my show, I'm going to call you at 6:00 AM. I was like, ah, I don't wake up exam 45 I was getting up. So it was doing that. I was getting up at four 45 Monday, four 45 Wednesday for Thursday, the fly out and then Friday radio dude. And what time are you going to bed? Usually? No, whatever. No restraint was tools that flicks documentaries, this dat, you know, youtube concerts. Now everything gets shut down.

Speaker 7:          01:34:29       But why were you waking up so early if he didn't have to pick? Because I read the Howard stern book years ago and he said that when he did radio, he always wanted to get to you first. That's the reason why he did morning radio was to get to you first. I was trying to build a podcast, so I want to get to you first. Oh, that's interesting. I never got a reason why I was doing that for so long. I wanted to get to you first. It lasted about two years. We did it. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't it. I did it once. I called in and you were like, I'll call you at six. I was like, I was like, fuck. It was, I started thinking about it and it was too much. Like morning radio. Yeah. What I was trying to avoid, I had become, so now like I consider a podcast or why at the APP.

Speaker 7:          01:35:15       My podcast should be a why at that. I see always people wasting valuable time on a fucking podcast. I'm like golf. They play games, they do this. They called his talk. People just want to hear why at that. That's all we are, what we would say behind closed doors, but they want to hear for sure. They want to hear, they don't want to hear if you edit me out. Oh he said Chin Chin. He says this. That's not what they want to fuck it here. They want to hit a wire tap where they hear a fucking why for sure. A conversation between two fucking guys, woman to what we were talking about. Yeah, it's true. It's pretty fucking by the way. You have any interest and you kind of just watched from the sidelines how things are starting to gear up for 20, 20 elections and all these people are coming into the mix. Like different people are announcing that they're going to right now the pool, I don't know if you've seen the democratic pool. It is like, it's um, it's, it's huge, right? Every day announcing like all these different senators and former governors congresspeople. But there's, there's other people that are announcing that they're going to run for president to like, um, I don't know if you've seen this guy right here. He's, he just announced,

Speaker 11:         01:36:30       hi everyone. Did she scream my co Ah, Taylor jr I am a retire e I am running for president of United States.

Speaker 9:          01:36:44       Good fucking Brody hung up. So this guy still fucking walking around telling people, here's the problem with him. Oh, Brody rest his soul. And this guy wants to run for president. This guy can't get to the fucking store without falling down two times and he wants to run for president. And the fact that somebody taped him and let it this fucking Moron get the platform. Like if this guy calls you up and said, come over, I want you to tape me. And when they run for president, yeah, I'll be there in two hours. I'd send the mental health people over there like listened to go over there and just bandage him up. He's talking about killing themselves and take him out of fucking Rovs.

Speaker 7:          01:37:24       And then somebody had to upload this to youtube. Listen, you know what the thing is, when I came from Cuba, I looked at the prices. You know, you had your Nixon's, you had your, you had your fucking, uh, you know, I can't even remember for Reagan, Reagan, Ford Hall look like presence. And then Clinton came along and he got his dick sucked and something happened and that, that nobody else got the Dixon. Yeah. He came along and it became something else. Bushed it to have it. I think Bush had it, but he did. Then the sun, they definitely didn't fucking habit. We don't have precedence anymore. We got a bunch of jokesters. Yeah. No, nobody in the pool was exciting. Nobody's excited, but nobody has a presence. Joe Biden has a presence is 2000 years old. Once a you, you hit him with a challenging, you know, the Koreans are common. I can die. Would be, I never even had Korean food over to Korea town bastard. So these guys, you know, I need a 55 year old with a strong top barrel.

Speaker 9:          01:38:30       Yeah. He'd come across a guy like John Paul, like a throwback to like, uh, or like if a madness actually ran, you know, the guy, a general Maddis. I like that. Who's like, we haven't had a general in a while. I think that'd be, or you know, I want it. There was only, I don't vote. I'm a felon. Yeah. But that wasn't one motherfucker I would have ever voted for it. His name was Ross Perot. Oh yeah. I read the, I read his book. It was in

Speaker 7:          01:39:04       prison and I was never more impressed when you read his book on wings of Eagles is when, if you really, really, really are an American, if you really believe that we should fuck motherfuckers up when they slip. You know what I'm saying? Fuck. Motherfuckers up like parole was our guy primrose claim to fame was he owned this company. I don't know what his people got kidnapped and they uh, ran Iraq situation or something. Correct me. I'm not a fucking historian. And I read this book in [inaudible] 88 but he went to Kissinger and he went to all the heads of state and they said they really couldn't help him. And he said, okay. And he went to the people's families and he goes, I'm going to have your family back by Christmas Day. And he went and he searched for the highest ranking retired fucking killer that the military ever have.

Speaker 7:          01:40:01       Like you pay like 10 million. Give me the fucking coach. I want somebody who's killed a thousand Jack. He's killed everybody. Cubans. I want a guy with no conscious. And he took that guy that was played by the movie cause they did a movie about it. He was played by a tough white dude to train his employees. So think of you're an it guy. Like can I come in and go get up, let's go shoot a fucking grenade missile. He, she trained, this guy says trends his own employees because Ross Perot sold him on it. Those are your brothers over there. Can you sit on that fucking basket? Eight fucking crackers. Let's go. He trained them and Christmas Eve, the 23rd around there, they went over there and they saved his employees and he had the people back to their families. Shit. Something the government wouldn't even do cause they don't want to cause bro.

Speaker 7:          01:40:56       Yeah. Wow. Parole got in some trouble for it. So he had some backlash. Yeah. My world. I want that backlash. Went to a family and told them no matter what, even if I got to buy helicopters, I will go over and take them myself. It takes a certain type of man to do that. He was, he would have been a scary presence. Yeah. They would've been like two countries left. He was the president. He would have been like us. He would have blown everybody else up. Africa, I ran these real Railey's would still be around and see where the team that we've got team up with Jews. Every Jewish people know a thing or two. You know what I'm saying? I'm Palestinians. Just take them out. They would just been parking lots all over this fucking empty fucking places. Smoking. I remember like those, he wasn't going to fuck around Larry King and he was here.

Speaker 7:          01:41:52       It sounded like someone's uncle, you know, just shooting the shit. And then at the end of every thing, he was going, by the way, American people dead paying for this with your money. I'm paying for this money. I saw when he was making at one time guys, it was just amazing. Yeah. I one time they broke down when he was making a day. It's got to be insane. It was insane when he had that much money and he's still alive. By the way, did this guy have some platform that he was running on? Who? Ross Perot? No. No. The guy that announced his running for press, the fucking mobile platform. What did he once he actually say, who's this? Who's this? I don't know. Can you imagine the other four idiots now who's going to be his vice president, guy with a hat with a propeller on it.

Speaker 7:          01:42:37       Then they sit there all day. Yeah, this is what I'm going to do. Got The fuck out of here. You got to drive me crazy with this shit and freedom for freedom and I am taking the wall down. Oh, he's taking the wall. Okay, so he's got an immigration policy. That's interesting to know the wall. No need to be up and Masha cow, aeration dishes America. You're going to hell Tom, who's willing to have this guy? Can you imagine this poor bastard giving this first beach and all the sudden you just hear it happens that fly off and shit and he's still alive. I think we need a wall. Let me tell you. So they can put up 20 walls. Those Mexicans, they're worse than the Vietnamese. Don't dig up though. They'll dig it up, dog. You can't stop. You can't stop it. You can't. You can't stop people. What they've been doing for the last 200 years, they know shit about that fucking born that we don't have a phone.

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       You ever been to a checkpoint? Charlie in Berlin ever go to Germany and Berlin.

Speaker 9:          01:43:56       Oh, you should have seen him over there all the time. So I do. I go a little talk about Jews with the Nazis got to go to for led by top. Mother's the, when you think of those Jews that fuck is wrong with you.

Speaker 4:          01:44:15       End Up in Berlin. You got see the checkpoint Charlie. It's the place where you could cross between east and West Berlin because they built a wall. That's what they fucking did after the end of the war. Whatever. The crowds, the crowds. Yeah. Yeah. And you would see it's a mute. There's a museum right there and it shows exactly how everybody fuck the wall. Basically. Like people would sneak in, they build compartment secret compartments and trunks. They built secret compartments under cars and carriages and people still fucking snuck in. I mean there's museums dedicated to it. So you can't stop anybody. No, it's never going to find that you can't, you can't jump over and get shot. You won't fucking,

Speaker 7:          01:44:51       we'll just do it. Did you watch that last season of Narcos? Yeah. That's been it. Yeah. Yeah. Go Luna. Awesome. Amazing. Just tremendous. But it tells you that they didn't give a fuck. They'll build tunnels. Yeah, man, don't go down the, they'll figure out some marines that don't give a fuck. Yeah. It's such a, you got to pick your battles. Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah. I have nothing against the wall. The wall that discriminant but build the fuck on wall, but you're not going to stop it. You're not going to stop you though. And that money? No, I don't even like talking politics. No.

Speaker 4:          01:45:27       Humans are so resilient. They'll just figure out a way. Get through. My parents escaped from Hungary and 69 when the Russians were. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:45:35       For all those Mexicans are built on a hot air balloon as we speak right now. Horse. Do you think the fucking new flight with a butane lighter like three Mexicans by themselves, a little fucking thing that pops after the fucking an hour that just build this shit already countering the wall. They're already planning how the fuck they gonna zipped a little war. Oh yeah. And by the way, the, you know the way that people, whenever somebody faces any Perrier of something they want to do, there's always another, there's always another way, man. Horse. It'd be another way you can, you can put up a hundred foot wall and then a new way. Just a new way in.

Speaker 4:          01:46:09       Of course my parents figured out a way to escape from communist Hungary where kids were ratting out their own parents to the KGB and your fucking family would get taken away in the middle of the night and thrown into prison. And my parents were like, fuck this place. We're Audi. How'd they get out of it? So they, uh, they took the train to, took a train to Yugoslavia. They got caught, they got deported setback. And instead of getting on the train and going back to Budapest, my parents were like, yeah, yeah, we'll go back. And they got off at the first stop, you know what I'm saying? So he took a train in Yugoslavia. They get caught at the border. The guy says go back. But they don't, they got at that first stop after and then they pay a guys with the guineas. They find a guy in Yugoslavia, they can get them to Italy.

Speaker 4:          01:46:58       So they wait, they wait, they wait, meet this guy. The guy gets them over to Italy and then they're in a camp in Italy for about a year and change until the Catholic Church and determined camp until, oh and that the Americans came over to my parents and I saw you guys were from Hungary. Tell us what the Russians are doing. Cause my dad was in the military in Hungary and they said, uh, if you can show me a map of what the base looks like, he goes, of course, yeah, here it is. Here's what the Russians do. This is where there's today. And um, I think because my dad helped the Americans and whatever, I don't know, somehow we got taken to Canada, we got a pass to Canada. And a favorite part about that though, I was born there, she was born in Canada. And then one day he was just like, America, I want to go to America. And then they just drove in. And my parents, yeah, Noah, he got sponsorship to work at a factory in Detroit. He was still supposed to go back to Canada, right. And then one day he's like, fuck that. But that's immigrants. Does, dude, that's what Joey is a loophole and you're like, fuck you.

Speaker 7:          01:47:58       Mother went to a party with her younger sister.

Speaker 7:          01:48:02       My aunt was 13 Rosita and my mother was about 1516 they went to a party with two of the three of them brothers. My mom was dancing and she lost sight of the Rosie and she went outside. She went to rather thing as some guy was raping my head, no taxi drivers in my wife. My mom broke the bottle and stab them in the back and ripped his back apart. The guy died the middle of the night, so they had to get my mother out of Cuba. So here's my mother, 1516 years old. In those days you just went through the fucking airport and she went to Chicago first. She labored in Miami, went to Chicago to see your relatives. They didn't want to, she ended up in New York. We have no like Hong Kong, New York. And she stayed with, it caused me for a few days and it was a fucking nightmare. And she met a Puerto Rican girl. They would go eat and they started running numbers together when they were kids from neighborhood booky, even, they both got together and opened up like a little back and started making a little money. But my mother wanted to go back to Cuban. See are parents. So she looked back at the Cuba with [inaudible] mothers,

Speaker 7:          01:49:19       uh, identification. There was no passports at that time. Whatever the fuck they use, I don't even know what those passports. So my mother entered Cuba with the name of Sophia Cecilio,

Speaker 7:          01:49:30       stayed in Cuba for four fucking had my sister then had me stay in Cuba with that fake fucking thing. And 1966 he came back into the states as Sophia Cecilio and that name stuck. So she just went and got a social security card. She lived the rest of her wife, like so free as a CELIAC. People will call us or feel, you know, what are they calling yourself? Fear. She goes, just mind your business. And what was your real name? Denorah hilarious. Touro Valdez. I'm allowed that, but she switched it to fucking Sophie to Cecilia. But the lab, when my mother died, I couldn't collect social security because my mom didn't work though. She worked enough quarters but under a different name. That's why I want to apply for a passport because I might get stopped and said, wait a second. Especially now, especially with it you, you've never, you don't go to Canada and nothing old gods at this point. I don't want to do that. Do you do a border Detroit Buffalo, but I don't go nowhere. Just in case they do the paperwork. Next thing you know. Yeah, I got some families.

Speaker 7:          01:50:48       There are no dangerous. Even though I got to pay the fines if I want a passport, but I really don't want a passport to be sure I give a fuck. I'm never going back to the Seattle, Idaho, so they want to come down and get me be my guest. Jesus man. Unreal be my fucking guests. The immigration world is a really, because you have to listen to two sides of it. That's why you really, me being an immigrant, I have natural compassion for anybody. I, you know, look what's going on down by the as well. You, you want your friends to be a part of that. I mean you, you have lat time, you know, this is our blood. Look what's going on in the bed as well as same conflicts. There's some place in Syria they run away from, you know, I can't imagine, I can't imagine.

Speaker 7:          01:51:39       And listen, we have good and bad in every race. Sorry. You know, there's white people that are fucking doing anything for you. And then there's white people to pay a half really docile. They're retarded controller. I can get into a fucking ivy league school. So you've got to parties and say my little miseries that USC, she's a dumb as a box of fucking rocks. She's dumb as fuck. But she said, you were say there's some people were proud of that. And you know, you look at that and when I see that, you know, I feel fucking bad for saying it just this way. So nobody gets offended. I feel bad for SPEC. A little Nigga kids, a little Chinese kids who worked fucking hard do a thousand fucking things. And now somebody cuts and fucking line. I feel bad for them. I feel bad for somebody who really needs those. Somebody who came from fucking hungry, she just wants to fucking be an engineer. You don't remember when you started comedy, how you would go back after your first year and you wanted to do things and it was frustrating and think of of immigrants in mind.

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       There's about what no matter what and that Japan, China, Vietnam, they come here and they body American dream and they just want to get into a fucking college, any college and here comes fucking full house with the fucking husband and may see in his fucking cut wife and you know for 15,000 to put her in a room to take our sats. Let me tell you something. You take, you take a course to take your rest a day. There's a course and you take it and they, you could take it. How many times? Two or three year? I say yes. Then you pick the highest score. So for 15,000 you just threw away 15 four. So they had her in a room with a mentor that give a bullshit thing is to the um, the people who did that, the paid, they paid for their kids to get like near perfect scores.

Speaker 1:          01:53:38       I couldn't even sell it for like, these are pretty good scores. They're like make it, what's the perfect 6,000? Make It 1520. So now you're pretending that the kids are fucking not smart, like genius level, you know, it was like the, the boldness and the balls to have to be it, to take it to that level, you know, is it to me is like, I dunno. I think you're going to play it cheat like that. Smart. How did they cheat the grades? Oh, sorry, I interrupted you. No, no, no. I don't know how they treated the grades. I don't know. I know that they, there's different, they were, these were different cheats. One of them cheated the sat and the act and then when the learning disability and that they need, Oh yeah, that was, that was one of the cheats is that if you actually do have a learning disability, you can, you can get like a solo extra time for the test. Proctor watches, they bribed that person to have a solo room and then that guy corrected all the answers. The other one, there was more levels to it. It was like a real conspiracy where they were paying coaches and acceptors off it, like all kinds of shit.

Speaker 7:          01:54:44       He was, see that 1.3 million bribe. She's doing 20 years. Yeah. There's nobody who got around. That's 20 years. That's 10 years nonviolent. They put you in a house in Pasadena. You can't have a bag book no more. It's, it's, it's, that's what breaks my heart. Listen, when I, when I was doing my little scam at the University of Colorado, yeah, I was a little, I was a loser and I wanted a, I wanted an education and I fucked around a little bit, but I did the war. Didn't really want it. It broke my heart after I got the felony and I couldn't go back on campus. It really did. It would've meant a lot to me. You know what if I could have got a half a college degree, something, but I got to look at you guys and tell you I'm a criminal.

Speaker 7:          01:55:33       I've never cheated on a fucking test. Maybe like in the sixth grade, I wrote the answers on my hand, but besides that I did the fucking work. You know, I quit high school, but my senior year had to quit. There was no mommy and daddy had. It broke my heart put me in a different category mentally what it does to your psyche. It was just horrible. Where you working senior year, I know I was doing whatever I had to do to roll a truck, load a truck, you know, fucking paint. Yeah. I was trying to do things, work for a book. He, you know, but it broke my fucking heart. That's why when I went to Aspen, I tried to sign up for those Mike Glasses and then when I got arrested they forced me to take my GED because if you have a GED, it counts against your sentence.

Speaker 7:          01:56:18       If you don't have a high school diploma, you have points. If there's a point system, do you get, do you have a job when you got arrested, did you have a high school diploma? Are you married? There's all these points systems. So when I got arrested, my point system was one and a half. That automatically puts you in a halfway house, but it had a four year sentence, so you only eligible for a halfway house at the 18 month boy. So I still had to do six months to get it down to 18 months. I had already done two in county, so that counts for, so I pretty much got the prison I was before halfway house. Wow. Because I had my GED, I was Rhett working at the time of my arrest. There's all these different things that you have to fill out to get you, you know, when you go to prison.

Speaker 7:          01:57:06       When you come out. I actually just signed the box and been disabled. You do know that when you go to prison, you come out of prison. You claimed disability. Really? Yeah. Nobody's going to hire me. Mental disability. I got 800 a month in a parking spot, but the rest of your life, I didn't want to do that. You know what I mean? People do that a lot and they get the food stamps. Then they get the other rate and they'll walk out of prison with 1200 a month. That's all. There'll be able to remake the rest of the life of work off the books, but that's how easy it is. I know an eight, he's eight. It was maybe now you got to Piss in a bottle or whatever. They get welfare. You could milk it. Once you got out of prison, you could say that you are disabled, but you didn't want that.

Speaker 7:          01:57:51       That was 30 years old. Yeah. I wa I want it to never have a ceiling over my head. Like I could never work for a salary. I was always a salesman. You know this week we made 16 next week we'll make eight, but the week after the how I'll come back with a $2,000 week. I never wanted the ceiling over my income. That was very important to me, but I also knew I didn't want a day job in. Yeah, I always knew I didn't want a day job. I wanted to be able to have a job that one year I can make 60,000 and the second year I could make 90 and the third I could make one 50 because I controlled myself. Did you, did you go to prison by the, in Colorado it was, it was, there was in Colorado, a place called Canyon city for diagnostic where they fucking tap into your head.

Speaker 7:          01:58:40       They see going on in your head and they do all these testing and then you go to a certain facility. Was Your prison cause it was backed. I don't know if it was the same now is that, was it all super segregated? Like, like you hear about now you want me to whites over here. Latins over here. It's so weird. It was segregated, but I broke that segregation. Really? You had made the guys that hung out with me break that segregation like it's weird that I'm married to a Terry Clark because my best best friend in prison was a guy named John Clark who hated blacks. Trinks Spanish Jews. You Hungarians. He, he was white power. But when he hung with me and hang out with three young pups, cause I ran with three black dudes who I loved and gave my life full. So there was guy that looks like Josh Parlor was librarian.

Speaker 7:          01:59:33       He looked just like Josh bought him. Yeah, he was the librarian. He was from Buffalo, New York also. Jesus. Yeah, he shot his wife and the mailman. Oh, that sounds like a potter then to the fuck of the tenant to a federal. Yeah. So our crew was me, him, John Clark, who was like heavy duty white supremacy, but not really. He went between the bikers and the white guys. He had the tattoos and shit. Me and him had visitation together because we both were supervisors in the kitchen. So we wouldn't take visitation on Saturday's and Sunday's we'd take visitation when they thesis where I could eat some pussy. Yeah. Because then I thought I'd make my girlfriend at the time show up, we'll address with no panties on. You and your wife would be on the other side of the, it just be two of us took visitations on the weekend.

Speaker 7:          02:00:20       I got to sit next to somebody. I can't finger my wife or nothing, but on Mondays and Tuesday I was slinging Vic eat das, shooting the load, and then she would bring me groceries and I go back to my thing. So me and John Type, but I was tight with a guy named Spencer Antwan, a black dude who fucking, uh, sliced the guy up and he had a really good attorney. So he had involuntary manslaughter. He killed him at a party. He was tight with me. But the best Jude that was my brother was this guy, Eci, he was a professional bank robber. And if I think back about this, he's the first guy that talked to me about stand up. Really like he taught me about throwing your voice. This is a funny story. We were talking one that we couldn't do drugs in that cause they drug test to yet, but you could do acid.

Speaker 7:          02:01:09       So we would do acid meet at a certain bunker. Me The two black dudes. And we just had with John Clark and the librarian, the librarian was a deep guy. He liked doing acid and all this shit and he would talk to you about Venus and all this stuff. But one day we were talking and this guy, Eci was his name, he's like, man, my Mama, I been in here for too motherfucking long. It's shit. My freezers are slipping. I'm like freezer. And he goes, you my mother fucker freezes and I don't know, I don't know what you're talking about. And he was telling me that when you go into a bank or liquor store to rob somebody, when, how you say freeze is very important. And it's got to be very like foodies, like it's gotta be very intimidated because if you don't say it the right way, people get kind of fucking tough.

Speaker 7:          02:02:00       You know what I'm saying? And he goes, one time, me and my brother went in to rob a bank and my motherfucking brother had a cold and shit and he yelled, freeze. But his voice cracked and the motherfucker pulled out a gun and shit. I had to shoot him in the leg. I mean, I looked at his police report, he had shot like 80 people. This guy, this guy was a jail 80% of his life, but he was hollow iron and my freezers are slipping. So he would tell me, man, I got to work on my mother fucking freezes. I'm getting out of here like six months. It's shit. I gotta get back to work. So I go like, so what, what can I do to help you? And he goes, let me know when people are gathered and I could try my shit out on them.

Speaker 7:          02:02:41       You know what I'm saying? It's like, oh well we'll start in the cafeteria first. So he would come in and look at me and I go and like everybody would be online and getting that food and there'd be people sitting here and he would kick the door down and go freeze motherfuckers and white people would duck and shit and he would come up to me. I told you I got to work on my motherfucking freezes and shit. That I would wait on Saturdays when the black dudes or play dominoes in the laundry room and they'd be listening. Fucking who's Whitney Houston's husband, Bobby Brown. Brown. Don't be cruel. Like I was in prison with the album came out and the brothers would be dancing though, be cruel. And I would run over the ECI, no, actually I got like 20 brothers gathered. He goes, what the fuck off and go there in the laundry room and he would watch down there to the back door and I go in there and the front be hanging out with the brothers and all of sudden the door was kicked open and he'd go freeze and all the black dudes or duck go, you black motherfucker.

Speaker 7:          02:03:38       You almost gave us a heart attack and that she would put his arm around me and he'd go, man, if you could scare Niggas, you could scare anybody.

Speaker 7:          02:03:48       And I used to go and see you killed me. And he'd run that drill every fucking Saturday if white dudes or cook and he kicked down the door, freeze and then God dammit you again. And then he would come up to me. He's like, I'm getting my freezers back up if she, that's one of my favorite stories I've ever, oh my God. ECI, I'm working on my freezes. I'm working on my freezers and shit. By the way, you know potter. Did you know that he can't come where Josh Potter can you get it up and he kinda ejaculate with a girl. No. Tremendous. That's even better. He wants to, who wants to come? He wants to, I want to drill a hole near fucking eyes and they can't take it no more. You know what I'm saying? When you're fucking them and their one eye balls hanging out and they're like, are you going to come and get it?

Speaker 7:          02:04:38       Cause I come quick. Yeah, I come in a minute. So if I can come in right there with you brother, if I could come in 20 minutes and just keep giving it dick go from puffy, the asphalt, the mouth back to your fucking back to, yeah, but that's my fantasy. If I couldn't come for an hour or hitting you in the face, making your socket popping it out, hitting you, you're like confused. You don't know where you're going. So He's never come. He's right. That's how it usually goes. By the way. That's it. It's an hour of fucking speed, but he, he can only come up. He jerks off. Then when you want to come after the chickens laying there like she got shot in Vegas. Good. I'm saying like she's laying there, the one leg is hanging, you know what I'm saying? Her mouth was stretched out as asshole.

Speaker 7:          02:05:26       It's still open like a dragon's mouth. You know when you fuck him in the ass, he ass hole stays open and then just lay that drinking milk trying to recoup and shit. You're given them like Gatorade. Then you just drink off on the tits and call it a night. There you go, man. Why are we even trying to solve this dude? I don't think it's a problem. It's not a problem. Yeah, that Joe convinced me. I mean I want to just mangled three checks that you couldn't come there. You can give him each day for an hour. You can get all through to show up at once and just keep going. Like Donna Emily style. You ever read that book? You wouldn't work in this town again. It came out in 98 about a hooker wrote about her experiences and she wrote about Donna heavily that she would go to don, Don Henley with all four bitches and he would sit there and this table like this was this table and that's a fireplace. He would make them, Ben don't, don't, don't even look at me. He wouldn't even let them look at them. Just look towards the fireplace and bend over, do lines of coke and then get up, open up his robe and stick it in here like four times. Then he sit back down again. You can do a couple more lines and he'd have to be there for eight hours.

Speaker 7:          02:06:37       This could be your life, Josh. God, I hope so that someday do it. Like when you, when I was younger and I did coke, oh there was dick for fucking four hours. Yeah. You just give it out deck. They're looking at you like what is this gonna stop and then when you do come, it's one of those long loads. Yeah. You ever have those loads? Like I used to, I used to be on probation and there was a dude that was like a Gi Joe Dude that failed the police task. But his assistant was a good looking woman. Like she was Kinda cute if I was dirty, she was byte dirty. Nobody talked to him boldly because she got like a Woodlake leg was kinda like, she had like that little limp. But you could tell the bitch hack game. Like she could suck her cock.

Speaker 7:          02:07:19       I would look at the eyes and I could tell this bitch is deadly. But nobody talks though because of the fucking wouldn't like or whatever the fuck she's got. You got shot in Vietnam. I didn't know what happened to her and she was very nice. I forget what her name was. I'd see. I'd always flirt with her. But when I was doing and I wasn't on, I figured out how to fuck with the Piss test among circumcised. I would take like fucking pool, clean it and put it on my dick and then pull the skin over it and put like a tab over like a bread town, like a, like a fucking rubber band. And then when I would go pee, the guy would watch me and I would take my thing out and just pee and then pull the skin back and all the pool cleaner will go into the fucking thing.

Speaker 7:          02:08:02       And then that would zap the machine. They would always say to me, this mother fuckers up to something. So he asked her, he goes, maybe you could see what the fuck he's doing. So I would, I knew when I would call and go, I'll be there at four cause they would call you and then you had to call it machine that would tell you what color was up. And if the color came up that your, let's say your color is maroon and they go to, these colors are green, Maroon and black. You have, I have to call him and tell him what time you coming in. You had till five o'clock but you got to make an appointment. Then she'd tell, you know, if he adds it, that means he was a watch you while you're pissed. But with me, they hadn't mirrors around me. They couldn't figure out what I was doing. So they sent her in. So before I would go and fucking do a half a jerk in the car and get my Dick Nice and big and then I'd sprinkle it, the fucking, uh, won't clean their pool cleaner.

Speaker 7:          02:08:56       I still got scars. I got little holes in the my Dick and Draino. I would grind it up, I would fucking put it under my Dick and then pull the skin back. And they would fall into the piss test and Zap it. But before I would piss, I would take the hammer out and show it though. Like what do you think? What do you think? There's something nice and she would look at it and look around the room and not like I knew I was glad I ended up asleep or whatever. A swap and spirit cause I flirt with it. Nobody talked to the woman because she got her fucked up leg. So I'm off probation, I'm delivering Chinese food. I'm slinging coke at the same time at the Chinese restaurant. So I would have to, I will have you called the Chinese restaurant and say, I talked to Joe.

Speaker 7:          02:09:34       Yeah. What's up? Oh you want to even drop soup, whatever. The cocaine would be hidden under the egg drop soup so that if I got in trouble to train these people got in trouble. I didn't put it in the bag. This was when I was out already out of prison. When that I knock on the door and who answers the door, it's her. And she goes, oh my God, it's so great to see you. How have you been like, oh, it's quite to see you, man. I gave her a hug and I put the Chinese down and she goes, what are you doing with your life? I got to know them getting divorced, but I got the standup comedy and I'm trying to deliver food to make a living. And she's like, oh that's so sweet of you. You and her broke up. Oh you must need a hug. And as I started hugging and we started swapping spit and I touched a little monkey and I could feel nobody had even touched her monkey like that knee is themes started coming and I started fingering that motherfucker like a savage and spit with her. And my hand was nice and what? And I'm finger that I got a pinky surrounded her asshole and I'm working with finally I put it down slowly and I pop

Speaker 9:          02:10:34       up pants, I take a out, she got one fucking town mum fucking slow figuring out at the same time. So while I'm fingering, I take a pants down and I go, I don't want to see what the other leg is. So I took the leg off of a good leg and I left the fucking bad leg carbon cause I don't want to know one those. If she's got like a pole on the day, I one of those fucked up fee. Let's see. That's why I picked up a fucking leg or eat her pussy. The clit flopping was huge on sucking like a on like a piece of bubblegum. I look up and she's like this Christie, like with her mouth open, I ain't go, now's the time to put the helmet and that fucking mouth. So I switched up, I started to finger Lucina and I went around.

Speaker 9:          02:11:20       I put that fucking hammer them out because she didn't know what it is. She's like, well that was that time and at that time I was trying to fucking live weights and shit so I wasn't jerking off cause somebody told me that the jerk off that your protein, I was retarded and when I came in a mob it was one of those loads. Christine that don't stop. Yeah. One of those things, I know you're sucking it with your eyes closed and then after a minute you open it up cause you're like, what is this going to stop?

I was thinking like a hundred milligrams of Valium at night. Well I shot in the mouth with a religious rants. He was glassy eyed. She gave me a $3 tip and I left and I never saw her again. She was a tech Chinese for the slept for a week. Oh my God. Oh you got any dates coming up? You can still Twitter handle. You can still feel it. Not felt like I bet it was.
