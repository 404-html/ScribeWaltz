Speaker 4:          00:02:41       There you go. That is of all the songs we played on this show, I would say that is one of the most beloved people have just been tweeting and emailing about it. I absolutely loved the closing song, young past episode. How eyeglass produced by chef. Um, that was uh, yeah, I mean I got so many messages, particularly get them, uh, you know, a lot of songs, but my goodness, that closed out in the last episode, I think three 82 and uh, I keep getting messages about it. Yeah. It's really, and that's, that's rare. Just like a double pipe classic. Yeah. Way to go young. Patriotic.

Speaker 5:          00:03:17       Thank you for doing so. That's glass. Let's glass tilted to camera. Yeah, it looks tilted. It's tilted right? It looks a little. Yeah. Let me see. Hold on. That's weird. But the framing looks

Speaker 6:          00:03:37       it's not leaning. Alright. Right. Like when you look down at it,

Speaker 4:          00:03:49       I guess I can't really tell. It's tilted down. Okay. All right. Now and I tilted down. Alright. Um, quick listen to this for all my audio files here. Um, so you remember like a month ago when the computer took a shit man and it turns out like I, it showed no output. There was um, that's all good to apple. I had to replace a logic board. Yeah. I just went to a sec cause I worked with two computers now. Same thing. No output again. So weird. Yeah. And I had it plugged in and it was just doing like some crazy noise like no. Yeah. Oh boy. So I think the logic board is shot again, but I don't understand how that's happening. I don't know. You have bad luck with technology. Yeah. But I mean all I did was just plug into it. So yeah. I don't know dude.

Speaker 5:          00:04:36       You know what? My speaker on my, my phone is acting up. I can't hear as well. That'd be getting older. I like it really loud. My phone. You're like, I, I don't even know what, what you're saying right now. Tell you I am getting older. I feel as though there's like, by the end of the day I can't compute what you're saying to me. Like yesterday. You are trying to explain to me about keys and the door and which keys go in there. And I was like, Babe, Babe, save it for tomorrow. Yeah. You give up at a certain point. I think by eight 40 I'm in. I'm in my jammer. No, by eight o'clock I'm in my pajamas. Yeah. Hey, excuse me. And then nine o'clock it's lights out. You schnitzel. Excuse me. By the way, Schnitzel weighs about 10 pounds more than she did, but before we moved here. Enormous. Why she's so big. It's like, it's that is the heat on in here? No, it's not right. No. Okay, good. It feels warm. Well, I know today it's hot out. Yeah, I'm in a while. Yeah. Hashtag Betsey's fat Hashtag [inaudible] what are they seeing? They're, they're freaking out. Who knows? Jesus, nothing as usual. They're reflections. Hold on one second.

Speaker 5:          00:05:50       What you doing? She Nitze come here. Fatty. Come here. Let's see how fat you are. Come here, baby. Fitzy come here. Come here. Look fucking fat. She is, she's huge. She's, we're not, we're not assholes. Just kind of look your Straw for sure. Uh, it's that it's the cause of the baby. It's because of maybe some of, we were looking through pictures this morning and back in October, bitsy was like in the background of one of the pictures with Lj and she was significantly thinner. And what's happening is she's eating all of ljs food. When he drops or whatever, he, they checked for the tropics builds over. She is the vacuum cleaner. We've got to keep her out of the kitchen. I don't know. But see, here's the problem is that I'm lazy and I like that we don't have to clean up the floor. Naw, Babe.

Speaker 5:          00:06:41       Why natures? They're nature's cleaners. That's why you get dog, so you don't have to clean the floor out of your toddler's she's wound. He was like a little bird dog. She should bird on four legs. It's just like stilts. Well, cause usually you're like, we're the only people that have a 30 pound Brussels. She's too big. We got how much should she way Max? 50 dozen. What third? No, what do you think? She actually weighs probably like 18 or something. She's alone and she's a sturdy dog. Like they're not, they're not weak little dogs, Brussels. But she's definitely, we got to curb it. She's struggling to jump on the couch.

Speaker 5:          00:07:23       She does. She does. Like it looks like she has an OCB cause she takes like five shots at it before she does it right now. T three can't get up. No, I try. I can't. Well here's what I'm going to do because I'm not going to stop her eating the table scraps cause I, where are we going to lock them out of the kitchen then they're going to go shit all over the house. You know how they are. So I think what I'm going to have to do is like half her dry food. Yeah. Just half that so that she can just eat the scraps. You know, what are we going to do? And I don't want to clean the floors. Do you know? Of course. So this is the obvious solution. Cut back the kibble. Let her eat people's food. It's not a bad, it's not a bad solution. Um, how has fif not fatter though? Because he eats the same shit. It's usually quick on the draw. He goes, but I think she's beating him all the time. I think she's, because she's a little more savvy about food consumption. She sits right under his high chair, like right there. And then FIFA is kind of off to the side a little. He chills. Yeah. They're always looking like right now they're looking for crumbs. I don't know what's going on.

Speaker 5:          00:08:35       Should we do a proper show open? Oh Shit. Yeah, I forgot it. Let's do it. Here we go. Just like the gays ladies. I want to do a video about this fucking lady gars our water.

Speaker 1:          00:09:04       Christina, I don't know. Don't ask me. I just looked really annoying.

Speaker 4:          00:09:44       The uh, that this one just stop or is when all the audio is like, this is the, the treasure chest of audience. This is all the original, everything. Right. And I just had the logic board replace before that issue and now it's fucked again. It's so weird. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:10:00       Do you think it is, and this is so stupid and this is such like a person who doesn't know about technology and saying something, so don't get mad at me. I'm not mad at you. Do you think it's plugging in and plugging out a lot? Like the sound Kiki's we've, we're always plugging and unplugging. Like do you think be the constant polling of, of a thing in and out of the port hole or whatever it is. It, I don't think that should cause a problem, but yes, I think that's part of where is something down. Maybe over time. I know.

Speaker 4:          00:10:27       I Dunno. I Dunno. But here cute though. I love you. Thank you. I love you too. Very handsome man. Uh, thank you. Thank you. It's Valentine's Day. It is. As we record this, talked to my dad today. He goes, buddy, that's your mom cars in a flower. Well yeah. He goes, yeah, she tells me not to, but it's like you something [inaudible] and Lan ladies say, don't worry, I'll get me anything. They don't mean it. They don't, they generally don't. It's absolute truth but eyes. But he's also been saying that to me for like 30 years. But your mom is the type that she actually secretly wants stuff. Of course she won't ever be like, don't get me anything this year. I'm telling you, I got nothing. I got nothing to so you can be upset with me. I'm not upset. I have, I've done nothing for you. Absolutely. I listen. I got you. I got you a baby. I got you baby. That's the present. That's it.

Speaker 5:          00:11:27       No, I don't believe I, you know, I think you and I celebrate Valentine's Day all year long quite. And I mean that quite honestly, that I feel as though you and I have a good thing going. Three 65 so it's one day that I just don't like being told what to do. I don't like being told that we have to look

Speaker 4:          00:11:45       nothing. Yeah. I ate the pussy and always wanting us to love their calm, to just love

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       licking it and how she bodies and swallowing it. Who put guys are you dating? So we're that. She makes these videos, guys, card partner about their time. She got it sounds like a muppet or something like sesame street now. And here's the thing, I other, there's Beethoven and Mozart over Costco over her shoulders. She's super culture, urban culture versus talking about their car. And so anyway, she's got great teeth. But the thing is, and all the men that I've been with and had spent a lot, so many Cox, I don't know of any guys that have been like, I want you to really enjoy my cup. I need you to swallow it. Love it. Lap it up. Let me put it like I dunno, I dunno who this bitch is dating. She's dating some real fucking animals. Clear. Yeah. Like what kind of guy are you dating? Only like what does it, Tinder hookups. She fucks a lot. Somebody, what did we find out the story with her? Remember cause she got to her video, we played her another clip she did where she was looking at I'm and uh, I think she was married and then got divorced and then went on a com CommScope paid. So now she's on like one of these apps probably just banging out. Randos she's really jumping on those days, man.

Speaker 7:          00:13:16       That same guy will never even touch his own commerce, taste his own car.

Speaker 4:          00:13:20       Why would he seen this happen so many times? It's so important. Yeah, it's a really important, so board and the guys, the guys are of waiting. They're calm then that bothers you? Or do you avoid yours? I mean, I guess to a certain degree. I don't know. I don't avoid it. No. I mean I'm not repulsed by it, but you know you want to clean it up, right? Yeah. I'm not repulsed by it either. It's not. It's a non issue really going to taste it like she just like, that's a problem for her. I think guys are like, oh no, I don't want to taste it. Yeah. Well I guess her point is, you know, you want me to taste it? That's a big deal. Why don't you taste your com? But not all guys want her to taste it. She's just say she's in a different, like a very specific wheelhouse right now. She's meeting some guy just want to get it out of them and they don't care if it tastes like, just get it out. I don't care if you taste it, you know. I mean, why do you have, you don't have to taste it. I mean, I know that some people, that's their, you know, some guys who like to taste their own sure that too. But I'm saying that would it where it would be an issue like this. Yeah. She, she's making it big.

Speaker 7:          00:14:32       I'm rubbing it in and I swallow or add to all the stuff with it. Same Guy. If his head accidentally brushes against the kiss, come on, my body's like, oh, what's that?

Speaker 4:          00:14:42       Oh well then he's an asshole. Like it was fucking really young guys. That's good for you. But I think he's fucking really young teenagers that are like, yeah. I'm like, cause she's saying that that's kind of like a guy being like, oh my comes gay. Like touching your own count as gay. Kind of sounds like it sounds very juvenile. Does Donald, she's fucking college guys. So again, salute. But uh, you know, I don't think most like 40 year old guys are going to dump on her and be like, Ooh, I want to touch it at me. I'm scared of it now. I swallows come in and kiss him. He's like, no, no, she's fucking young guys. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Does that, does that the thing you don't think you care, you don't care about anything, nothing phases. You had all your, probably the least phaseable of all the dudes I've ever been, which is probably why we're married because nothing phases you like I could probably just take a shit on and around in and around your mouth.

Speaker 4:          00:15:43       Like Danny, Danny, and you'd be like, Yep. You just roll with it. Yeah, definitely. I'm ready to go. Ready to go? Yeah. Ready to go. Karen fresh. It's Trish now. We haven't, we haven't mentioned that on, we mentioned that on the live show, but not, I guess we should park for a second. Tell everybody holy shit. Thank you for coming to the live show. Oh my God. Uh, to, to, to back to back podcasts in Irvine. So fun. Sold out A's in crowds. Uh, second one had Yoshi, one of our all time hall of fame gusts, Yoshi Obayashi and I'm not, she'll got wild by the way. That was such, that might be our were filthy. That might be our filthiest show ever between the content, like the drops, Yoshi, having a microphone, audience members, wink, wink. It was a fucking disgust fest, but it was really fun and it's Super Fun.

Speaker 4:          00:16:37       But I feel like they want it to go on that journey. Of course it was like, it was a mutual thing. Whose House is it right to my mom's house. Like, yeah man, do what we want. It's fun. It was really fun. And just so that everybody knows, people have asked both shows will be available for download. Um, I think the first we're going to do the early show you in a week or two and then the late show will come out all week or two later and they won't, they won't be in place of regular episodes. They will be in addition to, so yeah, it's like a bonus. So like your bonus, it won't replace the regular no, no, no programming. Um, right. So one of the revelations we had a at the live show is that Bobby and Karen is now Jay. It's different. Yeah. Bobby and Karen were our, um, our, what's it called? Roleplay names when we make love and I pick you up at a bar and like you act like you smoke. So at the bar and I'm like, uh, I play Bobby, you play Karen and we do it. I throw you out. And Bobby's kind of a rebel, you know, he drives a fucking GTO and he's just like, you don't give a fuck. You know, he's probably

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       got a few families in different cities mean I wouldn't call them families. He's got kids in different cities and states, but that's who I am. I'm Bobby, your Bobby and you're never, I can't ever expect you to be monogamous or faithful are called call me regularly or even text back. No, no, no, no, no. That's Karen. By the way. Karen and Karen always wants to change Bobby. Well, I was sort of carrying more like a dump truck. Like she was just like us. So happy to have even a moment of attention. Yeah. Yeah. And then, and she was willing to take the abuse, didn't have any idea that, I feel like Trish is a little higher up on that. Like, yeah. Interesting. So maybe she can get Bobby to be an upstanding, well, what why we started with Karen is that I was drinking wine and you're like, oh, I liked that wine breath.

Speaker 5:          00:18:43       Like that's a real trashy girl. That's a Karen breath. And that's how that started. And then I was right, it was wine breath, it was wine breath and it's like, Barbara smells really nice. And then I left a note on your car because we were, we were leaving in place and we were parked in the same parking lot. And I saw your car and I thought it'd be funny to put a note on there. Yeah. Well I don't even remember what I was like, Hey, you want a date? Yeah, Trish, call me Trish. Change it on the spot, on the spot. Just the name change, change my game and it, but it changed mine too because yeah, Trish is a little more confident, you know what I'm saying? Like Trish goes after the guy she wants, she wants Bobby and should I go get him shingle and land them?

Speaker 5:          00:19:25       But Bobby might text her every now and they'd be, he'll be like, I'm up. You are down to fuck. Right. But Karen doesn't even get that. Karen's got to go find him in the bar and then he would never pursue Karen. Yeah, he's just like to go to sleep and Karen Lawson and he's like, all right, Trish is like the her games elevated. I think you have a little more respect for Trish a little bit, but I mean I have more respect for everybody. Then Karen, Karen's a dump truck and he said, fucking mop just to come up. What do you say to Karen when we're done? Get Out. Shut up and get out. Now you say that to trash, but Trisha push back on you just, well you thought get out, you fucking get out. And he's like, ah. They laugh and they, they're kind of e Karen, Karen. I mean Karen Goes, oh, okay. And Karen leaves. Karen is her. That's, yeah, you're right. That's Karen's is Karen and I'm like, get the fuck adding. Yeah. Yeah. This girl is a total Karen. She has no self respect. She's making her videos and I'll shit my pants.

Speaker 5:          00:20:35       So here's the thing, I think we should go on strike against calm when a neat movement, the fuck. Oh, I'm so proud of you. What a neat idea lady comes. She's so of herself for coming up with that. So here's the thing, I think we should go on strike against, uh, come strike. And we as in what all women, she's talking out on behalf of all the women. Am I right ladies? So really she's rallying, this applies the only people that are going to stand with her or like high school, college girls, you know, because this is not an issue for grown for women. This is, this is like the age where he's still read Cosmopolitan magazine and you're talking about doing the camaraderie and stuff like that. Yeah. When you're a grown ass woman, you know, care about shower. Yay. Yay Fam. Blood. I from now on, I'm only going and she's 12 calm of a man or put on my body to come have a man who's willing to touch it or kiss me afterward.

Speaker 5:          00:21:32       No, she do shit dummy. By the way. He needs to raise her fucking standard to make it clear for people not sitting in this, she's not, you know, a teen or 20 that this lady was like, what do you, what would you guess? Mid Forties at best at best you. She's right. She's newly divorced and she's like discovering the world of young guys. It comes through to touch this com. I won't either. I'm so proud of wow. Brave stance. Yeah. Martin Luther King of our era. Right. The Rosa parks. The coming world. Okay. That men hate their calm. It's ridiculous. Oh. And um, they got to just love their calm before I'm going to like it. Oh Wow. Wow. This is like all those Instagram things where it's like, man, you got to love yourself first. It's a lot of those sophisticated, this lady. I mean, look at the artwork here.

Speaker 5:          00:22:30       I said she plays obviously, I mean there's Bach, Beethoven, another, yeah. The bike. She probably is active and just sophisticated lady. And she said, you dummy. Don't know. It's a stupid cause there's, there's other things happening in the world in case you hadn't noticed. I know she's worried about her fucking come strike right now. I'm strike, don't take ice. Said, well then don't date those guys. I know. It's so weird. Date. Someone else, Karen, she's, she's, she's dating bodies and she's upset about it then don't they? Bobbies don't they Bobby? There's all kinds of other shit you can do besides Bobby.

Speaker 5:          00:23:18       Grow up a little bit. Speaking of come the 50 shades of gray movie. We were scrolling through the films, the Itunes, movies, God, and we were like, cause we were, I'm going to watch it eventually. We should make a point about this for his first, you know, obviously that book first came out and it was a worldwide phenomenon, right? Every woman bought this book in the world. It felt like, and then there was such anticipation about the casting of the original, right? Saying, right, right. The buildup and then, Oh my God, the movie is coming out. People thought this is going to be on par with the dramatic following and the, you know, the excitement around that book and that movie I saw, I was like, you know what? This book is such a hit. I didn't read the book but I'll see this movie.

Speaker 5:          00:24:05       Of course it was a pile of shit. Terrible, terrible mood. Well I'll tell you a little secret cause I read the book. To me the book is a pile of shit to really, yeah. It was like, you know s and m light. I did an episode about, about the whole thing on that. See Pro the first movie in the book. Okay. So if you want to, let's do it. It's in the back catalog somewhere. But I, it's not even s and m. It's like it's an, it's childish like their sexuality, the girls a virgin in the book and that's her first and then the movie too and it's her first time having sex with him and she has like five orgasms. I'm like shit like that. We are like, okay. The first time you had sex she had five orgasms here. Right. And like it's naive.

Speaker 5:          00:24:45       I don't know. Apparently it just seems it's very childish. The whole fantasy of being rescued by this guy. My cousin loves it, loves it. Some women. This is really, this is in their wheelhouse. It's the strong man who does everything for you. It takes care of you. Maybe that's, that's part of it. I don't know. Who knows man. I Dunno. I just remember that the, here's my criticism of that movie. It was just so boring and the story was so lame. I mean, nothing happened. Yeah, there was the, the stakes weren't there and just you could see that like, yeah, this young impressionable girl and the successful good looking guy and you're like, okay. And then when he would kind of play with her, it wasn't, you didn't go like, Oh shit. Like, oh, that's crazy. She's getting whipped again. And then, um, the whole thing was like, will she or won't she sign his s and m contract?

Speaker 5:          00:25:37       And then she does the end. He was like, wow. Fucking deal. Second part. And just the trailer. No sense. It makes no sense. It looks like they cut together some of their favorite shots. She's beautiful. That girls really particularly good looking people, but it's the same song. They just redid a gammy leg is so crazy right now. And then it makes no sense. And then the rating for rotten tomatoes, it got a nine a 9% which is fucking, it's bad. Your vin diesel movie, Vin Diesel, I think scored a 7% right. Not a lot of single digit. Not a lot. I mean, you see them, you know, teens means your garbage. And again, you can disagree with obviously a bunch of critics, but when that many say it's, it's, it's a Turd. Yeah. It's pretty bad. Well, a single digit single digit, really 90% people that saw that movie and we reviewed it, we were like, this sucks. Yeah. It's too bad because it was hugely successful franchise. Yeah. Well, the book, you know, I was one of the books, I'm just funny. I said I couldn't do

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       it. Yeah. I don't know man. It's definitely a card one. The book, it's really just sex scene, sex scene, sexy. And he's chasing after her sex xx, you know, but like s and m like, oh, but it's not even SNM. No. From what I understand about that community, uh, that, that is like s and m light. Oh my, it's like housewife. Snm Blindfolding yes. Super lame. Oh yeah. It was like when you watch those lame ass Skinemax movies, totally. 100%. And they're humping like super fast and they're like, oh, they're like porno girls doing softcore. So they're terrible actors. Yeah. And then that's, it's, it's terrible. He's terrible. There's all good one though. Yeah. We saw a nocturnal animals. Nocturnally missions. Yeah. Internal emissions. How's great. Tom Ford directed the designer. The, the famous designer who knew I had no idea that guy was making movies. Well, he did a single man, which was a really good mood, I think.

Speaker 4:          00:27:47       So it's really good movie. You ever saw a single man? I don't remember. I think you did Julianne Moore and remember, I like her. Yeah, it's really good. Okay. This was a man. I was more impressed that he wrote this. That's astounding. It was such a great script and stories and Jake Jolen Cox in it who's just a horribly unattractive and uh, Amy Amy Adams apples and I like her. She's really good. Yeah, that's a really good high recommendation on that one. I mean, it's entertaining. You know, it's a suspenseful. I liked it. I liked it. And the account and we launched that last week. We forgot to mention that one. Yeah. That was good to the accountant. Yeah. That was pretty interesting. Guy was like Asperger. Yeah, yeah. He had Asperger's. Autism. Yeah. Um, yeah. Well, Asperger is a form of autism. Yeah. Like a more mild, you know, on the scale.

Speaker 4:          00:28:46       Yeah. Right. Like they're, they're so socially somewhat functional. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Just like not there. They're not as good Asperger's, not as good as picking up on social cues. If somebody, let's say not on the, uh, you know, the spectrum, but um, compared to somebody with like, yeah, strong. I think there's a few comics, Asperger's that we've known over the years hold for sure. Yeah, for sure. Absolutely. Well, yeah. Um, would you ever date your mom? I would date. My mom is so horrible that I don't get to, uh, enjoy all these. I don't get to play my drops today because of that fucking technique. Oh, that's fine. I play that said, we don't have any drops today. We do have some, but I don't have that one. I mean Sirius Xm. God, we live inside studio G. We're waiting for Facebook now to catch up the studio to dude, can I tell you

Speaker 5:          00:29:41       saying, speaking of Asperger's, yeah. I would not be surprised if Garth is on the spectrum. Yes. Why? This is why. This is what I haven't been able to put my finger on. That's wrong. That's off about him. If you watch how he talks and how he is, he is not emotionally connected to anything he says it's, it's all an effect. I'm telling you. Yeah. I remember when he was, we watched a video of him with the birthday cake. I don't know if we're going to be seeing that. Right. Well, we'll watch it just watches. There's not a genuine emotional connectedness to him. Even when he was being interviewed by was a Barbara Walters and he was like, it's just like snacks. It was very, it seemed rehearsed like this is what people say. This is a shocking thing that people say, oh, I wouldn't be surprised, but he seems real phony Bologna.

Speaker 5:          00:30:28       He has. There's a room here that they've called inside studio g. He's such a Dad Boehner. He's like the most famous dad boner for sure. That there is, he's like the chairman Jesse and empires. And then over here cog love one another. Oh boy. Boy who is a big phony. See what I'm saying? No, it's like he checks off all the boxes of what it is to be a successful country star. Love it. I love everybody. I love my fans. Thank you for joining me is bullshit. Yeah. That's kind of bullshit. Welcomed inside studio g first here and a, I like it that way. Really cool. Yeah, but that's why we think he's funny. I think he's kind of autistic and I wouldn't be surprised when we think he's funny because he's autistic because there's something not connecting. I'm saying he's weird. That's well, yeah, let's leave it up on some things.

Speaker 5:          00:31:25       Definitely weird. Yeah, but he's not autistic. I think something's doing. Something's weird about them for sure. Uh, like a little uncomfortable as it was almost like this is a bad idea or poorly executed. Maybe it is. All his social media stuff is poorly executed. It's just like if you told your dad social media, that's why it's funny because he doesn't, he's uncomfortable almost doing it. Well, it's too contrived for social media. You've gotta be way looser, Bro. Like he doesn't need to be a studio g. Even this room, it doesn't feel like a studio because there's just three things hang in and a desk. But like in a small child's dust that he's sitting on with nothing on it. So it feels like they just put stuff in a room and they were like this studio g it is. I got, he's annoyed.

Speaker 9:          00:34:35       Watch this.

Speaker 8:          00:34:39       Just the instant cuts, right?

Speaker 10:         00:34:52       cool. Jesse says, cool. Gee, we just won't be sponsoring more that we won't be talking about one of the positions. Jesse says, well, what is behind the scenes stuff? It's pretty cool. Yeah, it is cool. What's that? We're going to have any insight. Studio g we just won't be sponsoring more of that. We won't be talking about one of the positions says, well, love all of this behind the scenes stuff. Thank you. It's pretty cool, man and [inaudible] and what I, what I find out, so let's see. It's cool to start texting me or telling me stories about how during the show they'll start to watch the crew, which is cool too because the crew is as much part of our show as again as a drummer. The guitar player. Yeah, it was Garth Brooks.

Speaker 5:          00:35:30       Nice. I'm Northbrook says I'm not special. I love this phony. The third person is the ultimate places. Yeah, it's the crew is just as important as the drummer, the guitar player, even as Garth Brooks is. So everyone's important. That guy, what I find out, so as people start texting me or telling me stories about how during the show they'll start to watch the crew, which is cool because the crew is as much part of our show as again as the drummer, the guitar player, this Garth Brooks is this crew, Garth Brooks as gee. Wow. As important as GE is such another country music thing of like I have, everybody's just equal. I'm just as important as the grips. Like some, some of them are, not that they're not important, but one of you guys, if one of you doesn't show up for the night, kind of ruins the whole thing. You know what? I'm happy birthday. So we missed that. That's what he said to Jake. He says he's doing himself happy birthday to g baby birthday.

Speaker 5:          00:36:32       So cool buddy. Sweetness, sweetness, sweetness. Such an old dad. It's pretty cool man. And then it's, it's neat. Such dad boner. He's, he, he is the greatest. He's an exemplary dad. Boner now. And you know, he's probably a pretty good dad. You know, he's faking that too. I feel like you have contempt for him that I had just, there's something about this guy that doesn't, it doesn't rub me the right way. I just think that we're going to find out in a few years some dark shit. Oh, it's definitely some dark shit. He's a little too Cosby, you know, like, you know, orchestrated and clean and everything's like, isn't this neat? Great. That's what I'm talking about. I know. Especially like a famous guy who's got access to tons of puss and whatever he wants. Yeah. Gimme a fucking break, you know, and I know he's got demons, Howard guy. Yeah, he's a weird dude. We're going to know about that stuff later. Um, do you see the spider in the sink? You saw that this, this is a couple that they're on vacation I think during mom's Trillia. Yup. And uh, they find a big, so there's some big ass spiders there. Lots of critters and mom's Australia and the, uh, recording so big. It's huge.

Speaker 5:          00:38:07       So she's, she's really scared. The recording keeps pretty, you know, scared too. But so he's got the, uh, they're getting a spray out, you know, they're going to try to just dose it. Dowsett I love the subtitle. The subtitle is a genius. I said, Vicky, maybe they there, but she's

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       obviously, she's not Australia. She's, you know, well, she has a, she has an Australian accent, which is so fascinating. Right, right. So she's learned English. She learned English in Australia. Right. But she's not a native Australian. Right. Was there. Um, so then she gears up and they line them up here. It's funny to hear someone with that accent. There she goes.

Speaker 9:          00:39:02       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:39:09       now she kind of dropped a big word there. She sure did. Never heard. I've never heard a Chinese Australian dropped that on a spider.

Speaker 5:          00:39:16       That's what I'm saying that, well that's why were at your mom's House special. Special.

Speaker 11:         00:39:20       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:39:25       I've done the, the lead up to something like that where you just scream for any of that. You dropped the and Bama. I didn't drop it in bond on it, but I dropped a, you know, a lot of

Speaker 9:          00:39:35       [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          00:39:39       That's kind of like running into battle. That's moderate, you know. Right. The spider that's domestic. It's domestic battle. Right. That's a brain farm moment. Right, right. Yeah, totally. It was like, oh my God. Like you just go for it. Yeah. She was terrified. I was scared.

Speaker 9:          00:39:55       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:39:57       Dad, do you have the biggest bugs, man? I remember back during road rules. Oh my God. So do I, sorry, sorry. So we used to stay in youth hostels. That's a secret. You never really slept in the Winnebago. We would check into youth hostels. Everybody's just drill on each other and those houses, no, no, actually no, we didn't. Nobody slept each other on my cast. So wow. The Lights, the crew lights would be on in our bedroom. We'd all sleep in the same room. In bunk beds. Yeah. And the lights will be on, so all the bugs would be attracted to the lights. So when the crew would leave at night and they turn lights out, there would be a layer of bugs on the ceiling, like a layer of huge moths and I would always get the top, the top bunk, because I like top bunk and the bugs would just fall on me all night and I would put the sheet over my head and just look. I'd feel them falling on me. It was so gnarly. Australia is just so gnarly.

Speaker 11:         00:40:51       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:40:52       That's your bugs are a keychain. Nothing to kill him. Why did they just had to fall on me and go away? It was horrible. I don't like, I really don't like that. I really know. That's not cool or neat. No.

Speaker 4:          00:41:04       One time I was in Lima and a fucking sewer rat. The house.

Speaker 11:         00:41:09       Ooh.

Speaker 4:          00:41:11       And they had a body guard, like security guy that worked there. He beat it with a stick and killed it. Damn. This big are fine with a stick. Yeah. He got like a mop or something, just like club the shit out of it. How big are they? It was massive. It was a massive thing. As big as Betsy. It looked like, I mean, no, not quite that big, but it was pretty big. Yeah. Dude and Cuba when

Speaker 5:          00:41:33       I did, um, that naval show [inaudible] they have those, uh, what are those called? And Rats. Oh yeah, they look like, yeah, like that. Those are nasty. I remember you came back with all those videos of them. Ah, yeah. And they were just everywhere. Yeah. They tried to kill them all the time cause they overpopulate so much. Oh there's a guy on base who drives around with a 22 and he's just supposed to shoot everyone and that doesn't even put a dent in the problem. Like he'll kill 20, 30, 40 at a time, you know, and they're like, it doesn't even put a dent in our problem with kind of a fun job though, when you think about that was a blast. Yeah. If you have a no ambition, what a great job. I mean, if you're stuck on an island and working on base, that's kind of the the truck and drive around and shoot these things like fucking awesome.

Speaker 5:          00:42:22       Did you and your bro just shooting these disgusting creatures that are overpopulated? That probably makes it easier because they don't know. Not Cute. Yeah, I do. Yeah. Ah, I got to be so nasty. Cuba. There is some island. I did a Gig on some military base here in California and they, they were overcome with a, was it raccoons? Yeah. Yeah. Raccoons just, Oh, so many dude. And you see these so many. These are, we could feed them. They come right up to you. They didn't give a fuck. You see these fuckers? They're big man. Oh Damn Dude. That is as big as our dogs all over the island, man. All over. Look at this motherfucker drinking, drinking those guys. Bottle dude. Yeah, so I guess, you know, maybe it's just a fear because they're new. Maybe they're sweeter. I know that they eat, they're not like 'em

Speaker 4:          00:43:15       are sewer rats, they just chew on but eat vegetation there. Oh, okay. You know, but fuck man, when you saw the first time I saw one, I think I've told this story before, uh, we pulled up to our first show and the lights from the van, we're highlighting them and they weren't, you know, skittish. They're just over there eating, but they're pretty close. So the guy was like, you can go take a, you know, you can look at them. So we all get out of the van and we start to walk over slowly and literally as we get, uh, I don't know, maybe five feet, um, from it, you know, you kind of squat a little more cause you're really taking in that you're seeing it in person. And as I do that, as I leaned forward to get like a kind of good glimpse of it, one of the other guys on the show ran his two fingers up my back.

Speaker 5:          00:44:04       Ah, and I let,

Speaker 9:          00:44:06       yes,

Speaker 4:          00:44:10       I lit up like a high pitched scream that they asked me if I was joking. You know, they're like, where are you doing a bit? But that's how

Speaker 5:          00:44:20       gross. All right, cause I had that that moment. Yeah, I know. Like the spider and they spook you. It spooked, man. Let the record show. By the way, I have one, two, three containers of water. How many do everyone's over this

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       right now? How many do you have over it? How many do you have? Curious. You have a disgusting soda and coffee. Only dehydrating elements. No hydration, no dehydration. Because this is water. No sugar, no artificial sweetener, no caffeine. Okay, but it's like sugar water. It's not sugar. Fake sugar water. It's Z via whatever we're switching. The House has switched over from liquid to Zv. Yeah. I hate this because I don't like Zevia. I don't like it. It doesn't taste good. I liked the clock right now I hire, we also had a revelation about liquid. What it makes our stomachs hurt, couple of them, and we keep drinking them and I keep drinking it them. You're done. Totally. I'm not into them. You're fully CVO. Now, here's the fun thing about Cvi. If you, if you'll allow me. Okay. Here's what I, here's why I'm in is eve.

Speaker 4:          00:45:19       Yeah. Yeah. I've gone pretty, you'd admit pretty hardcore with my no sugar into, yeah. Yeah. I don't fuck with sugar at all. Right. Yeah. You know, an exception here or there, but my day to day is no sugar. Zevia is like Keto friendly sweetener. Right? Yeah. Other words, there's some sweeteners are like fake sweeteners that have the same effect on your body that sugar does. Right, right. This does not, so it's a, it's kind of an indulgence. It makes you feel like, like I'm a drink drinking us doing a bad girl treat and that therefore it's more enjoyable to me. I understand. I understand the logic. Yeah. However, it tastes like shit. It tastes like just like a soda to me. It's just like the gays, but to me it makes me thirsty year and it makes my stomach feel weird. Both the Quad Moz via too. Why don't you marry your mound and then see you? Why don't you, why don't you, oh, awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Um, go ahead. See if this is here. I'm trying to see if this is, uh, I wanna I wanna find something. Oh man, that's what sucks about having that computer fucked is that there's been any the f word. I know.

Speaker 4:          00:46:28       Let me see if this is, yeah, this song. We would have so many killer songs lately. Yeah. But you know how sometimes from moment to moment you get one stuck in your head? Yeah.

Yeah. So we were sitting around at Korean barbecue last week planning the show and we thought, wouldn't it be fun to get some pup play masks? Uh, how's the audio? Hold on, let me help you.

Speaker 16:         00:57:31       I'm boring my fetish, man. I'm wearing mine now too. Yours is a little different, but the same idea. You know the same idea.

Speaker 15:         00:57:43       What do you think of a burn? What's your ass smells like? What'd you call them? Balls smell like?

Speaker 5:          00:57:49       Well, what do you think? Do you like the experience?

Speaker 16:         00:57:52       I understand. I understand the thrill of the tight laid techs

Speaker 15:         00:57:57       smell what your nose smell like at different times of the day.

Speaker 5:          00:58:00       Good. What about the smell? It smells really powerful in the, that effort, but I'm working on getting a more keen sense of smell.

Speaker 15:         00:58:09       Nice to different parts of your underwear.

Speaker 16:         00:58:13       Uh, feels right. I think I should take it off.

Speaker 5:          00:58:15       It's horrifying. Wait, it's horrible. Yeah, no, it's triers on. Yeah, try that. That's terrible. So Tom's got the original fetish mass for those of you just listening. These are, so this is the original black terrifying one. And then I got another one that's a German shepard with crazy mouth open and crazy eyes. And it is terrifying as well. Yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty crazy. If you saw somebody walk up and this you don't think friendly, you don't think like, oh that's pretty, that's a friendly guy. This is terrible. This smells so bad.

Speaker 16:         00:58:47       Yeah. Oh No.

Speaker 5:          00:58:50       Horrible. So we had the thing going about, which was more terrifying and oh yeah. People I'd be, we'll go black one because it's the fetish mask right away. But I still could feel like there's something creepier about the non fetish mask. I do. I don't think so. About the, the, the googly eyes. Cause you are realize or in that this has fake eyes in it. That's what, that's what it is. The dead eyes. It's dead. Fake eyes. Yeah. How many walks up in this [inaudible] you don't know what's happening. Yeah. But blue band made a good point about the original fetish mask is that there's no expression. Oh, that's terrible. Right? I know, I got it all. You're right. That's way worser. C. Yeah. Wait, try this again. Do it again again. Well, let me see. I want to see the contrast. So this is the original fetish pup play. Oh, that is just terrifying. See that's like a rapist or a serial killer. Like it's, it's traditionally scary, but it's like it's telling you it's scary, right? That one is misleading. Try that one again please. Fucking prop show today. I want to see. Yeah, that one could be, I'm robbing a bank or I'm raping you. Oh my God. Your beard is sticking through the mouth holes. Others, peers sticking in his mouth.

Speaker 4:          01:00:12       Definitely. We were terrible. Do you feel sexy though? I mean I get that people like some people just like wearing latex, right? It doesn't personally arouse me, but I understand why it's a thrill for someone. I do. I get it. It's a tactile thing. But wouldn't it ripped super tight on you if you were to zip it up? Cause we couldn't zip it over your head. Yeah. Cause it would trap your hair. Doesn't get caught. Tear. Your hair gets caught and then you have 10 Vaseline up, I think. Yeah, that would be, that would not be good, dude. I don't like those at all. I don't enjoy wearing that shit at all. No, I'm not. It's so scary, right? No, it's just not, it's not my world. We got, speaking of Garth, we got another, uh, Dad Boehner here. Oh, sweet dad Boehner video. Cool of a dad who was driving and he saw a funny sign.

Speaker 8:          01:01:01       All right. So I'm driving home and I'm heading down near the auto mall and I pass this strip club. I glanced up at it at the, I just glanced at it like I'm driving by and something that I saw come across the school made me stop and want to film this and I was fucking crying.

Speaker 4:          01:01:27       Let's see what it is. It's so, so funny.

Speaker 5:          01:01:29       Yeah. And it should be coming up soon. Oh, right here. Okay,

Speaker 17:         01:01:50       man,

Speaker 4:          01:01:51       he quit being a dad. Did you hear that? Yeah. Yeah. That was so funny to him that he wanted to quit battery. You realize that that's what's out there, but that's, yeah. When you're like, I wonder if this jokes good enough. Yeah. Right, right. Okay. That guy, I thought gluten free lap dances was the funniest thing he'd ever heard. Did you hear that? Yeah. So the sign is a scroll and it says gluten free lap dances. Yeah. And he hasn't looked over. I, I, I salute you for having a sense of humor. Yeah. About it. It's funny. Good. Yeah. Would you laugh? No, but that's

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       the thing with Dads, is it? Yeah. They really get tickled by stuff most of us don't. Like. I think what it is is like your life gets so mundane as we've discovered being parents that you just get excited about little stuff because you don't experience, the world is mine. At least I don't like Shit, man. I watch a Ryan Gosling movie, you know, and I think it's like the best thing I've ever seen. Right. I watched fucking no strings attached with Ash Ashton Kutcher and Allie [inaudible]. This is a funny movie. Yeah, I was, yeah, I really thought it was good. So your, your standards change when you're locked in the house. Well, yeah, when you're dealing with kids from, you know, you're, you're so innocent, your existence gets way more innocent. Interesting. I've never actually thought of it like that. No, I'm smarter.

Speaker 18:         01:03:05       Come on man.

Speaker 5:          01:03:11       Glue.

Speaker 5:          01:03:23       I like that a lot. Let me see if this came in while we were doing this. Free Lab. Dad says the funniest things ever seen. So stupid. You're my son. I'm your mom. Um, cause I wanted to set this up. I uh, I spoke to my dad. Oh, thank God. It's that what our guy, where the, Oh wait, the best part about our masks by the way. Yeah. Our pup masks is that you were out of town when they arrived there and I took him out of like Amazon boxes because I bought them on Amazon by the way, using our banner. You can find anything on Amazon. Yeah. I fucking fetish masks. You name it. So I had them out in our bedroom just like, Hey dad, I'm sorry. Throw him on our couch. They're like our goal seat. Yeah. And, um, our, uh, our nanny sometimes makes up our room and I came back and she had neatly folded both like fetish masks. Yeah. And I'll, I, I was like, Oh shit. You think she had any idea what's going on? No. Kind of like, remember the time in the house keeper put your cock rings and plastic bags. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:04:36       So she had to have noun. Yeah. That was something hygienically not a favorite part about buying those cock rings by the way. Well not maybe not those with the first one I bought cock rings was that I bought large thinking in my mind, large adult. Right. Not Enormous. Deg Large. Yeah. I saw Lars and I was like, oh, like, like a large t shirt, like the gays adult. Right. So I bought a shirt, a cock ring for like a giant cock. Yeah. I could fold that cock ring and to and still stick my fingers to the sides of it. Cause it, how'd they get a housekeeper? Must've been really impressed. No, that's what I'm saying. That was like, I'm s I'm talking about the first I ever bought. Oh

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       does she put was just a normal one. Yeah, but I think she probably thought, I don't think she knows what that is. I think she does because she put it in a Ziploc bag and put it in, kept it by bed. Go clean the bay in the bag as if to say, this is disgusting that you just left it out. There needs to be in a plastic container. Dummy. What if she was on a com strike? She probably is after that was on one. He's like, I'm not doing no come [inaudible] man, she's cleanup so much of your calm just does our bedsheets and stuff. Yeah. She doesn't realize she's doing it though. She knows she wears plastic gloves. That's true. She knows. She knows you're an animal that Lou, she doesn't, you know, make it a thing of it. She doesn't make a thing of, oh, make a thing of it, you know. Right. Are I talked to the top dog and I got, I got him to what? You wanted them to speak Spanish and try some Spanish. Now the sound is kind of shitty because he's on, he's driving and he's on his Bluetooth, but you know you can still hear him.

Speaker 4:          01:13:06       What about the museums and the artwork?

Speaker 19:         01:13:09       You know, I've been to all those museums after a while they all look like, you know, I mean, I did that when I went to Spain, which you know the grid really well. Yeah. Yeah. Why are you, Maria and I were going through all these museums and it's basically some picture of some, some guy being tortured by the Spanish or one of a thousand pictures of, you know, Christ in different, you know, religious pictures. But after a while,

Speaker 4:          01:13:39       Oh God, of course.

Speaker 19:         01:13:45       You know, the traditional paintings all look the same. You get the, I make the Salvador Dali museum in and spanked.

Speaker 4:          01:13:53       By the way, I'm super impressed that he even pulled that up and the fact that it goes, doesn't he have a museum in Spain that he remembers that I took him to one, but I'm so impressed that he, yeah. Yeah, he might, there's a brainer. Sophia has, um, I think modern artwork,

Speaker 19:         01:14:12       you, you know, some of that stuff is interesting to look at because you don't see my job, you know, after a while bored pretty quickly. Why I tell you the museums, I don't get bored. I like the, all the museums or Washington DC, the American district museum, Natural History Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, you know, so I like, you know, American history. I, you know, and I've seen a copy museum, I mean the gold museum and after a while it's all gold. Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:14:56       Yeah. Although they do have that nice torture museum there.

Speaker 19:         01:15:01       Yeah. I went to see that. What headquarters is Spanish. His Spanish are really good at that. You know, they, they had this rule that you're not supposed to draw blood when you charge you some money.

Speaker 19:         01:15:15       Yeah. I was part of the magic and you know, when, this is where the religious things, but they were really good at like Callie limbs out doing thing is that, you know, once you, once you call somebody, you know, use the rack. I'm somebody that is beyond repair hills people. Yeah. Basically. And they don't, they cannot be thinking at that point. Right. That's nice. They're basically, since I've been watching what I eat and I'm at a more disciplined, I am now, it's been, I haven't had any, you know, I stay with, I guess the best way to say it. I stay in the really the, the four to five range all the time now. It's kind of Nice.
