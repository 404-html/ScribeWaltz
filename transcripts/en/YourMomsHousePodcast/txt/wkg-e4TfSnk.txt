Speaker 5:          00:07:09       Yeah, of course the, but I'm so happy that you're filing on board with the velocitor showed up with one yesterday. No, I've been trying to ease you into this shift for 14 years. What does it take is fine. I just put it on. I mean, what a, there wasn't hard to convince me. I know, but I feel like I've bought you these things over the years. Haven't not full full Valore. I just know. You know why I felt like it was time. You're ready for it. Why? I don't know. I feel like now that your dad, your father of two, yeah, you're officially in dad mode. You're like, yeah, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. And I wore my three stripe just to commemorate. I feel like we're in it to get where we're like total eastern blockers now. We are. Um, so this lady farted and then all the knife on somebody or for talking about her fart.

Speaker 5:          00:07:55       That crazy. Really wild out of flatulence and a Florida store leads to police making a stranger rest. It's a lot of purple Chanetta Wilson notion. Their Shahada, she was arrested for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after she pulled a knife on a man who was offended when she allegedly passed gas while waiting in line. So she farted somebody who was like, Hey, do you mind? And then she pulled a knife on him. Fuck you off far one on one a fart. The Broward Sheriff's office says awesome. And the man got into a verbal dispute. Oh her, her quote, farting loudly. Boys on to say that on TV. Tang loud. And that is when she pulled a knife and threatened the mandible there. Laughter here. Yes, I did. Far Tang and loud. Loud play it again. Yeah, it was great. Far tarting. Loudly. Farting. Loud. Loud. Why did she get of a flatulence by the way, such a Dick. I have. Usually when they only, if there's a fart story involved. Does the anchor person ever say like there's the person when their image comes up like she did, she was like, they're like, they never do that. Well because it's fart related. They're like, there she is. She's mocking the credit. She's a serious crime though. She pulls a knife on fucking aggravated assault. Of course they're Chanetta. They're shutting you tick. Yeah. We know.

Speaker 5:          00:09:32       Like our son now, our oldest son is going Yay. Just out of nowhere. It was yes. Forever. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Jeez. Like your lunch. Yay. He sounds like the guy from sexy beast. Yeah. Yeah. He's um, loud. It's like someone learning to say the word loudly. Farting, loud. Farting, farting, loud. Loud. I fart loudly. A lot in public. I can't hold them in any more after two children cause I, you know, when you have a vaginal birth it kind of loosens everything up. Yeah, that's pretty wild. You're, uh, your farts. It's really been so hard to look at you because you've been cutting your own hair. Hey, let's talk about it. It's terrible. Let's talk about what happened. So I want to post the photographs on my Instagram, the Christina piece so you guys can see what I'm dealing with. So last night, is it the Christina?

Speaker 5:          00:10:39       I do the Christina there. Shanana it's the Christina p instead of the worst social media. Any huddles. I was relaxing last night. You always did this to me when I'm like having my glass of wine, I'm chilling down. You come downstairs and you're like, you're bald. You look like Bruce Willis. And I'm like, what the fuck did you do to yourself? Because you, you've been cutting your own hair with your clippers. I get impatient and impulsive and I just, sometimes I just, here's the thing, because my balding is in the front. What happens is like when you take it down all the way, you're like, cool, it's this, this, this is how it should be. As it starts to grow out, what stands out is that the front center is obviously thin, so it stands out that, oh, everything else is getting longer, starts to look bad. Sometimes it'll be like a second or third time. You look in the mirror like, I got to do something about it now. Oh, I see. So what? What's happening is because I don't mind that, that you, you're cutting your hair short. It's just that you're doing it, like you said, impulsively in poor lighting at night, so you're not, you're missing a lot of spots.

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       You're not really doing a good job. Yeah. You, why not wait? Because Alan's coming over tomorrow. He's going to be in your house and he can do your hair properly. First of all, I didn't know Ellen was coming over. I didn't make an appointment with him. Right. I just saw what happened was I saw how thick. Okay, so I start to see that. Then I start to see how thick the beard gets. My beard will get really thick. I'm also going to post that on Instagram, on the Christine and p. You guys can see what I saw in the bowl when I went to go brush my teeth the other day. Half your dirty disgusting whiskers. We're in the ball. It's, well let me ask you, I understand you take half of it now but, but the thought it doesn't occur to you like maybe I should maybe clean the whiskers.

Speaker 4:          00:12:36       I did. I did. Eventually eventually it did. If you go look in the sink, it's clean. It doesn't make you sick to leave it there. And initially, not initially because I'm not done yet. Do what happened was I did a pass on the beard and then I came downstairs and then I was like Ah, I got to do the head note. Went back upstairs. I think you saw it in between the two. Then I did the head, then I cleaned up. It was an all day thing cause I was in the afternoon or the kind of afternoon. No, no, no, it was both were in the evening. Oh, okay. Okay. You said you didn't notice the beard until you like I'm saying my beard change until you notice the head change, so, right. So what you, you call me upstairs and I'm already been drinking so I'm by drinking, I mean I have my one glass of wine palm juice nosedive too.

Speaker 4:          00:13:24       And so that's when you hand me the clippers and you're like, can you clean me up? And I'm like, Hey, no, because the lighting's terrible. It's nighttime be, I'm already a little bit, yeah. Sauced yeah. Okay. Uh, three I don't cut hair professionally. I can't do anything better than what you're amazing is how badly you have adapted to just neck trimming over years. Like I have neck and on my neck tremor, you know, it's just one of these like little, the trimmers, you know, I mean a wall or something, tremor. And you still hold it backwards and the wrong way. I'm like, look, it's either like this or like this. And I give it to you and I always see you go the wrong way. I'm like, how many times am I going to ask you? Because every time you ask me to do it, I'm already been drinking or it's bedtime and you're pulling me out of bed.

Speaker 4:          00:14:18       You pulled me out of bed last time, eight months pregnant to do it, nine months pregnant. And, and then you got mad at me that I didn't do a good job. I was tired, I was almost asleep. And you're like, come trim my hair. Well anyways, so last night I go and I look at your head and I see it in the end, the damn bathroom light. And I'm like, you got to see what you've been walking around with brow. Well block it around for an hour, but still it's bad enough. And I take a photo chunks, just long shocks, patchy scrap. And then I'm looking at your beard now

Speaker 5:          00:14:52       and it's not good. I gotta be honest because listen, just listen, it's patchy as fuck on the sides. And then when, and then you left a Brussels beard, like a schnauzer beard down here. So this is, it looks like a goatee. Good. It looks, it looks like you cut a goatee on your beard. It doesn't look good. People like it. Nobody likes it compliments all day to day. It looks terrible. It looks so good. And how the fuck did you do this? You did this with your dog. Clippers with your head clippers. You do this with your beard. No head clippers. I just threw on a different garden. Went. Yeah. It shows that you just read judges. You just Willy Nilly you wiggled your rest around and that, that looks awesome. Yeah. Well I'm a tell Alan the clean that beard up me really fucked that shit up. I did not really fuck that shit up com. It looks like you look like good morning Julia and the Frat. I don't look like Joe. You've got the, it's like a long schnauzer beard in the front. My flower, my every Tang. Me You yesterday. I can't stop thinking about him. It's amaze. I can't stop thinking about Joe. Come on and Julia, you yesterday. Meet me my soon to be my everything. My soon to be my everything. My flower. Ah, the kiss is just the worst.

Speaker 5:          00:16:19       Um, me, you, well, a couple of things. First of all, don't go back to your boyfriend. We didn't do this on the podcast because I didn't know if it would be a bad idea to do on the podcast because of the reach of the podcast, which is we held a screening for instant family in thousand oaks. Let me, first of all, my husband is very humble and sweet. Let me tell you what my husband really is saying, that when the oak park shooting happened and then the fires happened, it was horrible. And my husband bought out a theater so that people could go see instant family. You buy it up all the tickets so that we could host a free screening for the Community of Oak Park. That's what you did, Tommy. Cause you're a sweet man. Thank you. Um, what I was trying to say was that I did not do that.

Speaker 5:          00:17:10       I'm just being fair here. What I was saying was that I would charge people dub. I've, what I did was I wanted to do it in that community, but I, I, um, I only announced it on social media cause I didn't know if we did it on the podcast. You have a limited number obviously, of tickets for a movie screening. Right. And if I announced it on the podcast, I didn't want like too many people to show up and be disappointed because I felt like the podcast response would be even crazier. I just announced it on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook and we held it on Sunday and people came out. They were extremely

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       nice and grateful and so many mommy's such a respectful audience. And you know, most of them came up to me and told me they enjoyed the movie and the movie's a well done movie for the, uh, for sure. Like a family kind of came on the screen. Everybody clapped. But that was very funny. People would clap when my name would come up, when I would walk on swear. They were like, Whoa, that's very funny. Um, but thank you guys for coming out. I really enjoyed doing that. Um, it was very fun actually. Uh, we had our friends kind of weight. Yeah. Cousin Bree. Bree came, Ryan sickler sickle cell was there. Who Stavo who plays a horn and your movie was there and Rena and Matt. Yeah. That was really fun. That was a good time. Um, what else did I want to tell you? Oh, this other thing, I mean has taken off. If you don't know over the weekend, Garth's, Notre Dame

Speaker 6:          00:18:46       for fuck's sake. You're just going to walk into this. So

Speaker 1:          00:18:50       many, there's so many. First of all, when he was saying as the week was building up, Holy Shit, his Instagram is over. I didn't realize there was one thing where I did where I go, I opened one of his posts and I go, I want to scroll through the comments, see how long it takes to see a non related comment. I couldn't find, it was just like scroll, Scroll, Scroll through. I was like, Geez. I was like 50 comments in nothing to do with him. You know about our show and the people who listen to us. Yeah. Is this the best? Number one, there's nothing that compares fun. We have a common, we have a common target here. Come here. All right, so here's an idea. So you post this about his Christmas music thing. Miss your wood here was like, there's nothing bad spending Christmas together, right?

Speaker 1:          00:19:48       And then you open it up. Hey Hitler, will you guys be performing the classmate Christmas song machines within? If not, you guys should try it out. Keep them high and tight, right? No, there actually is real common, sweetest couple ever. Then it says keep it high and tight. Hashtag dedication. You are not Gareth and Trish doesn't look like either. Um, so that's one there. Now here's his Notre Dame post gene, high and tight. You want to move in? You could move it a try it out. Oh my God. It's just like, it's relentless fans of the podcast. I listened to troll Garth Brooks. I was starting to pick up, started to pick it up. Open your heart to me in your arms. Just like Joe, you don't need lube. You need to spit. Oh my God. You don't need, you don't need spit. Yeah, that's right. Um, here's his head. All you post. Well, it's official. We're on Facebook. I told,

Speaker 7:          00:20:48       Gee, and he didn't believe me. He believes me. Now it's just endless. It is endless. I mean, every post to every single post is like this God, what the fuck is going on here? This girl wrote, what is going on? I'm confused. Physical four strokes. What the fuck? And then someone wrote, he just wanted a poop through a hammock. I said, why not? It's just like the gays. That's their explanation to someone who was like, what's going on here? Are you planning to release B side version of this album with just Trish blasting carts into the mic? And by the way, every time I've seen, uh, cause I follow him, I'll just, every time a new post comes up, within seconds, it's completely, completely

Speaker 4:          00:21:38       just getting pummeled. Piss on me, beat me, try it out.

Speaker 7:          00:21:41       Or asking them, how often do you miss your would go full throttle. Jesus. Yeah. It's endless. If you really want to be amused by who is Julia? Good Morning Juliet.

Speaker 4:          00:21:54       I could see you use your lung disease as an instrument, maybe even playing machines within for the mommies. How you're only takes forester.

Speaker 7:          00:22:01       Somebody wrote $100 as Garth is a ball hall. I'm not sure what that means. I like the interaction though, like the confusion. Oh my God,

Speaker 4:          00:22:18       God, I got friends and mom's places where the jeans are tight and Burt is racist. That's hilarious. Yeah, so if you really want to have a good time, check that out. Oh God, no. But it's just, it gets, so that's just the beginning of my last few days with Garth on Instagram. So he's been promoting that CBS concert that aired on Sunday night. And let me just say it was the most unnatural video. Do you have that one? Can you pull that one up? Oh, the one where he like introduces that. He's doing a concert. We're going to fill this up.

Speaker 8:          00:22:58       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:23:09       here's my room again before anyone. Garth Brooks is undoubtedly talented and he makes millions of people happy with what he does. We're not crapping on this guy, his talent or anything, but the social media component needs to be managed where he's like, can you, can you believe this work? We're going to feel this.

Speaker 7:          00:23:32       Oh, it kills me is the fake, the fake humble pie of it. Like, well, we're going to, we're going to feel it. Like, of course you are your agent book to you in an arena tour because you're going to sell all these tickets, asshole. He was doing all this promo

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       for this, uh, you know, cause it was a seep televised event. Let's be crazy. And I saw him doing this interview where he was like, well first, uh, you know, you're scared because a, you're like, are we going to even be able to sell it? May tickets. And he goes, and then it sold out in an hour and you're like, so you're like, you dick, like so nervous. But then an hour later it was all sold out. Well, it's the, yeah, the fake. Like I just can't, I don't know if we're going to be just happy anyone showed up. Just humble pie. He's not the, the number one entertainer of course, in the world right now.

Speaker 8:          00:24:21       Yeah. That's such weird ever held at legendary Notre Dame stadium. Yeah. I got friends in Notre Dame stadium. Oh boy. Five at Notre Dame to knock after a 60 minutes.

Speaker 5:          00:24:36       And the thing is too, like it doesn't, he have other highly successful songs other than I've got friends. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that's, that's the, that's his anthem. That's the same joke over is that yeah, I've got friends in Notre Dame stadium. Yeah. Well they have to do, it's so weird too because you imagine like his, uh, his fans obviously like his hardcore fans. I think that's a hilarious, that's a funny joke. Sure. Yeah. They're like, Huh. Cause he's got a song called, I got friends the agile, see he did a joke about it like that. Huh? What's this richer reminding you to tune into CBS is Sunday a Sunday eastern seven central. Right. Don't miss live at Notre Dame. Garth Brooks is going to be fine. Gold. Yeah. He just doesn't know how to do it. Hey everybody, I just going to tell you, hey, he's so awesome. He's a great performer. Yeah. Amazing. Just like a weird social media guy. Yeah. Really, really weird. Really. And how are we going? Are we going to fill this up? But the thing that we all suspected is actually true. That's the last time you're ever going to see him perform a concert because apparently it's all over. It's all over. Okay. Because this came out this morning. Oh, okay. This was on the news this morning. Okay. You want to see it all right?

Speaker 4:          00:26:03       Yeah. I'm, I'm upset. I'm upset already. I don't know what to expect down opposite Garth Brooks in this interview. I want her and what he would tell me how hard it would be to get him to discuss his horrific crimes. What I found was that he was very forthcoming. He volunteered details that may be difficult to hear. I began by asking what he wanted from the men he picked up.

Speaker 5:          00:26:25       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:26:26       It's hard to comment on anything they do because if you do that, then you got to comment on the fact that yes, you do have three arms. I mean, just don't want to show the other one.

Speaker 5:          00:26:33       That's why you count them.

Speaker 9:          00:26:35       I'm the last guy that wants to see it over. The greatest part is the fun of it. Good. Um, you know, your time comes when your time goes. It

Speaker 5:          00:26:41       was two years ago in this apartment

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       in Milwaukee, police discovered the grizzly remnants of one of the most horrible crime sprees in American history. Confessed that he had seduced, murdered and dismembered 17 young men. He even ate some of his victim's body parts. That was not my first choice. Basically, I wanted somebody that was thin and beautiful and lots of hair. There it is. Wow. We knew it. We knew it all along. It's surprising, but not surprising. Not Surprising. He is a deadly psychopathic. Of course. Of course. Who made that one magnum meme one I think nagged a meme. I don't know if the one is there. Look, look for me. Yeah. Wow. Great job. Exposing the truth, but a psycho, that guy is, he really has killed a lot of people. Kid Ness. Um, that was so funny. Yeah. No, it's just no one. It's a magnum underscore me. My, okay. My Instagram again, I'll be reposting all the ones that roll in because I posted the initial, one of his horrible cvs and then I requested people make their own and remix them. We can't often play it all because of the song, but I can post them on social. So here you go. God Damn God damn be posting Tom's horrific hair, hair pics. I did a good job. No, I did a good job.

Speaker 4:          00:28:07       How are we going? How are we going to fill this big old, big old arena? You know some people aren't so happy that we tease Garth. Did you know that? Oh, I bet. I bet. Kind of upset. Okay,

Speaker 10:         00:28:21       well, well sometimes Sagora right? Vernon Brooks to third of the Garth called me up last night was talking shit. You speak fucking funny man. Messing with our ticket sales. Well, Tom Jagger ruined your wife, Christina passage and I'm going to tell you right now, I've got a jar of peanut butter bag full of broken glass. I'm a duck, my knuckles. Then finally time second, look at me. I'm shaking. I'm so pissed off right now. I've got Kim, don't tell me how tank. I've got to get this dumb bitch time. Sandra miss with my uncle. He left two tickets sales last week. Tickets up down. Ain't nobody coming to the big ass mother fucker stadium tour. The town stagger keeps on running his mouth. People are getting, so I'm going tell you one time time. Sagora you won't meet me a dark alley or you could close your mouth about my uncle Garth. He's a good man with trees are so sad and got a lot of fucking money. Piss me off. No more tabs. Sagora come on over pissing my mouth. Try it out, mother fucker.

Speaker 4:          00:29:36       This guys familiar. He's the same guy that did Billy. Good Morning Juliet and he was all battered

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       up and ray, the black guys related to Garth. But he's right. No, this is Garth's cousin. Yeah, that's pretty wild. Dam. Yeah. Sad. Gra. Yeah. This is so bananas. What do you think people love so much about Garth Brooks? What is it? He must be just, it must be just dynamite fucking shows. I have to be, I've heard people say that the live, the live shows amazing. They, oh, well you have to like the music first by country, right. His country. And then I see that he has a girls and like cheerleading outfits and they're shooting off guns of stuff in that CBS train. That's cheerleaders probably cause it's at Notre Dame stadium. Oh, right. So I imagine that's part of the fun. Yeah. Probably special for that. But I mean, generally speaking, he just puts on a crazy show. He sells out more than like lady Gaga.

Speaker 5:          00:30:33       Uh, that's a good question. I Dunno. I really don't know. I mean, I know the weirdest thing to me is that he's huge in Ireland. That's bizarre. Like huge. Yeah. He's, he's so fucking famous over there. I'm like Ireland. Really. I don't, I don't get it. Lady Gaga is, you know, definitely international superstars. So who knows. But there definitely both. Monsters gave me so much joy is the weird his weirdness. Uh, last week, you know, we had the, um, the guy who told you that, like, you, you make my eyes a telescope. Yeah. Yeah. The homeless guy. He wasn't homeless. The horsey it, what are you talking about? Hey, that guy's not normal. What? No. Why would you say that? Because he looks homeless. What's, no, he's definitely homeless. Tommy. I think I was not home. He's like a doctor or something. I don't know if he was a doctor, a lawyer, a lawyer. Was it last week or was it the week before? Uh, it's been the council for you remember this guy? He's my now he's super weird. You, uh, yeah. Uh Huh. Because honestly, there's really nothing that compares a black dude spitting game. Like they're, they're the ultimate, right. Well, for sure. Puerto Ricans to, yeah. I don't know. I think, I think brothers were the number one. So Geez, we have a segment now, this black dude spitting game. Right.

Speaker 11:         00:32:07       So,

Speaker 5:          00:32:20       so, um, because it's just, there's so many great videos of this. I haven't seen this yet, just so you know, a lot of times, a lot of times, neither one of us has seen we're, we're seeing it the first time you're seeing it. So I think some people think that like there are times, yeah, there are times where I'll see a and that I just want to like surprise you with it. But most of the time I haven't seen the videos and just let me be clear here. You're running under the assumption that it's black guys who spent the most of a folder for me. Oh. And it just says that, well, it doesn't say that black guys usually split the most game saying that this is a video about that. Oh, Gotcha. Okay. Claiming racially that they had the best game. Well that is what I'm saying.

Speaker 5:          00:33:04       The video that I'm hoping supports that. I'll see it. Another thing to point out quickly, stop fucking sending videos that you want on the show to anywhere, but the email address. Oh, right. I'm not going to open it. I don't watch them on Instagram. If you sent it to me on Facebook, if you send it to me on Twitter. No, that's why we have an email address. We have a producer that reads these and watches these. So if you want it to play on the show, your mom's podcast@gmail.com there's no house in that email address. Send it to my personal email to stuff for the show. We don't play it. I don't, you know, I think one out of 50 of those will make it like a half to happen to open it and want it to move it forward. Just send it to him if he wanted to play on the show. All right, here you go.

Speaker 3:          00:33:50       [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:34:07       well I will say this, that doesn't necessarily support what I was going for. A this guy is like mouth to mouth really close and the cording himself kind of whispering or singing I will say doesn't have the best teeth. Um, and which kind of is a distraction about it cause he, oh he has them but there's like they're not all there one. The ones that are there like candy, corn

Speaker 3:          00:34:41       cousin. But I love you.

Speaker 5:          00:34:58       Okay. A couple of things. This is not spitting game. This dude is just singing along to a song. He has four teeth, three are a different color, top teeth. So he might have some more bottom you. Um, but she's really into it. She is really, she really digs it. Summarize cares what we think. Exactly. Smell. He thinks he's the best. They can't smell good. That mouth. Can't Smith's a bad mouth. That is a bad mouth. But are you, are you really objecting to the blanket statement? Black dudes spit. Here's the deal and here's, here's why. I'm just wanting to challenge it a little bit cause I feel like Puerto Rican guys are up there too. Where you think they got it from pro? The black guys of course. Okay. You think they train has seminars and they train. It wasn't a seminar. Just they just picked up on it. Black. There's definitely split the most game. Yeah, of course. That's true. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:35:49       Because here's the difference. I find that like when I was a single lady, like I'd be walking through a parking lot just at like the grocery store. Yeah. And a black dude would yell at me from like across the parking lot like sub girl and like what's our bread or whatever. I got I red red hair or whatever your hair color is. That's how they would yell at him.

Speaker 5:          00:36:06       Sure. And then they start talk talking shit like how you know across a parking lot the Latino guy might, Latino guy might actually want to be face to face interaction different degree later. Yeah. Of Skill. Just like in any sport. Yeah. I mean the guy that yelled, hey red, he might be an amateur. Right. Or you put a professional in front of you. Sure you pay. These are coming off. Sure. Okay. Oh Shit.

Speaker 3:          00:36:32       Ah. Oh God.

Speaker 5:          00:36:54       His mouth is so bad. There's like there's also rotten parts. Yeah. He has like dump gum decay and Ah, ah. It can't smell good. God, she loves it. She really loves him a lot and he really, really ruined my pitch. I thought we were going to listen to someone being like, I turned it to a telescope again. Like that car man.

Speaker 12:         00:37:21       Darn it. Turn it to a telescope. You melt me every day.

Speaker 5:          00:37:26       Yeah. Fuck dammit.

Speaker 12:         00:37:30       I've been looking at your picture. So low weight.

Speaker 5:          00:37:34       Yeah. That dude that dude has got Todd this mouth thing is really, I don't like it. That mouth. Who? The fucking blue band. Why would you, ah, God mean. Yeah. That's pretty nice. That guy needs dental surgery to yesterday. Yeah, Bro. Dm it. So upsetting. So upsetting.

Speaker 4:          00:37:59       Speaking of upsetting, we were watching the Shahs of sunset last night on our bravo. Whoa.

Speaker 5:          00:38:03       Yeah. Catching up. We have a lot of our favorite word catching up on and you got so upset. It was a Mercedes was getting married and the, I haven't seen you this upset a lot. One of March. You were like, I'm so upset right now. I'm so upset. What about her wedding upset you the most? Um, I dunno, I guess I, I guess in my core I like certain levels of respect for certain events. Yeah. You so like, I mean they even commented on one aspect of it during it, she's walking down the aisle, she stopped walking down the aisle to s shake hands with people and say thanks for coming. Like as she's walking down the aisle until I was watching, I'm like, what are you doing? She was drunk. They were, they're both so, and then, uh, like she was like, oh my God.

Speaker 5:          00:38:55       And she's like, I can't believe you're here and hey, you came to this, oh my God. And like walked down the aisle. That's for after the right. So she's plastered that. I just started to cringe at, I was like, Ooh. Then it's their wedding. It's like this beautiful setup, right? I mean, yeah. Lovely decorations. And then the officiant officiant says, you know, whatever he says, and then he's like, will you take her? And the guy's like, apps a Fuckin lutely, you know? Do you want that for your wedding too? I don't know. To me, I mean, these aren't, it wasn't a punk rock wedding. It's like black tie. It's a nice looking. And then like what I, where I wanted to just crawl inside myself, I felt cringey or than watching my own audition was a, the vows, the vows exchanged. They didn't right and advanced.

Speaker 5:          00:39:51       Now he said something like pretty like decent, you know, for his mouth. I'm not criticizing the, you know, the writing of it. Um, like she kind of cut them off at one point, but he got out a nice thing and then she bombed so hard and she started talking to other people and was like, don't look over there. Okay. Do you not want valves? Okay, I'm not going to do vows that like during the week I was like, I hate this. It made me so uncomfortable. It made me upset because it feels like a disrespect of not only the event but like of the people there and showed up to come to your wedding, the whole thing. The whole thing made me, I think you and I are traditionalist in that sense. Yeah. I personally, and this is just me like I believe in wearing closed toe shoes to your own wedding.

Speaker 5:          00:40:40       To your wedding. Okay. Instead of like flip flops. I know sometimes people wear flip flops. Well, a beach wedding you got to where I'm at the beach wedding. Let's just say we've attended a ceremony where, Oh yeah, that was nowhere near a beach. That was weird. That's weird. Yeah. We weren't even close to it be. It was an indoor daytime affair. However everyone else, I would say that the, the audience was dressed more dress better than the groom. He was wearing flip flops. That was weird. Flip flops are basically not for most situations. Correct. We know they're the ultimate leisure wear. It's great if you want to wear them to run errands or go to the beach, obviously listen, even as a city dweller. Yeah. I don't really like wearing flip flops in the streets. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. I'm

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       a little even like, it's a lot of shit out there. There's no holes and shit. You're in Hollywood. You're like, I got to tell you the grossest is a flip flops in New York City. When you see people like Hollywood basically walking the streets and you're like, dude, this shit is nasty. Like there's fucking plague on the ground. Pretty much. But how do you know what I'm saying? Like have some respects. It's your one wedding dance. Fuck, it's a desert. Sure. But it's still like the streets are nasty bro. Line to vomit and garbage and you're walking around pretty much barefoot almost. There's a very thin barrier.

Speaker 4:          00:42:15       Yeah. I think you and I are are traditionalist when it comes to those types of things. I don't, I don't like being too irreverent on solemn occasions, like marriage, baptisms, things of that nature. Have some respect. Who told me about somebody thinks that I'm crazy at a funeral too. Oh yeah, no, we read it on this show. We write it on the show. It was a while back where somebody wrote in how they said that um, as they were lowering a casket of a family member that the grandmother has her phone and was like, I dunno, like around two I could be there. Yeah. Sandwiches are like just took a while. Calls during the funeral. No. What do you fucking do me have some respect? I guess that's my thing. I have a little fucking respect. Oh my God. Speaking of respect, I have two incidences.

Speaker 4:          00:43:06       I what the star, but I was at the Starbucks on my way home from man Diego and there was a chick watching a video, full volume, full volume, just sitting at a table, a young 20 somethings like lack of respect. Nobody wants to hear your crazy video. Secondly, there was only one bathroom at the Starbucks and I just don't believe in going in there and posting up and taking a huge shit. When you know that there's one bathroom for the entire Starbucks population, it's not fair to do that because there's a line that forms and then you know like you would on an airplane, there's two bathrooms sometimes front and back, so was like, okay, some guys shouldn't be here. It is shit fuel. That's what it is. All it is, it's bowel and and urine maker. Yeah, it's bowel torture and bladder torture and then they only give you one toilet to rotate at all code code.

Speaker 4:          00:43:59       Do you know the code? I got to shit right now the code is nine one one bitch, I've got to go down and then they're like, ah, the coat today. Today it's a, it's one one. It's one eight, one six I should be try it. Try. Yeah. And you're like, Oh God, you got to put pound. I think before you do you pound first one you're shaking and sweating trying to take a shit. But what I'm saying is, look, if you got to shit, you get in to Starbucks right quick, quick, quick, and then out. But I'm talking like this fool posted up. You know what I'm saying? And there's a 10 minutes of a shit. Don't do your 10 minutes shit. Oh, I know. There's a lot of people that just abuse that. Are you crazy? I think they just do an email. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:44:41       And He, you know, people are waiting asshole and they really got to shit. They really got to shit. Yeah. I got to shit and piss now. Second place is we were interviewing for a babysitter man. Farting loudly. Yeah. Anyways, so what I do is I interview people and I let them hang out with the kid with me around supervising and see how they jive. So this person was in our home, may be a couple of hours and I come inside from being outside and she opens the bathroom door and this, this flushing sound and she says to me, Oh, do you have a spray? And I see the I, the smell hits me and I'm like, this bitch took a shit in my house. Hey, one minute one bro. Bold, bold, bold. You can't just go to like a potential employers house. I got to shit right now.

Speaker 4:          00:45:33       Right now. No. How are you going to bring you to shit right before you got here? That's what I'm saying. Yeah. You don't shit day like right away. Minute one at my, you have a right to shit obviously, but you know. Well I don't even know you. It's a, it's a bold choice cause you're not going to hold your shit in, you know, but no, but I didn't fucking bring your own spray Jesus. Or I guess I just don't think you should have this amazing spray shit and someone's fucking house that you don't know. I ordered a spray that you're going to flip out. Yeah, it's amazing. The headed at the gym. Okay. I say the best spray. It's a shit spray. Well yeah, yeah. But it's like, it's not what you think is not one of those big error. So it's just like a, yeah, the smell is, so the thing is we have another bathroom that has those sprays. Yeah. There is a bathroom that contains those fucking know when to shit and when to keep your ass hole closed dude. Or at least courtesy flush that the smell doesn't. And it was nasty. Like she really, she said, oh she really shit. Aw, it's so nasty. Oh No, she's not going to work here. Yeah, I know. Crazy down. Are you shitting someone's house? You don't even fucking know them yet.

Speaker 1:          00:46:42       Yeah. That's Kinda wild. Um, look, the phenomena has also just exploded for us reviving this a good morning.

Speaker 4:          00:46:53       Julia has just been such an amazing thing.

Speaker 1:          00:46:57       Um, and everyone's getting involved. I can say that, um, people that you don't expect, and I want to give credit because we've made mention of this before, that you know, a lot of dudes are usually the ones that do to send in a lot of their things. You know, it's a lot. It's a lot of guys. But the ladies they came through on,

Speaker 4:          00:47:22       right. Let's see some lady, Julia's ladies want to Julia. So here is lacy

Speaker 13:         00:47:30       Juliette. Hi. This car here that I'm driving. Yeah, I built it myself eating that he didn't work when I got the car, but it's like I'm really handy so I was able to fix it. What else do am I really good at? Oh, fucking a lot of makeup. All comments. You know what I mean? Five Times minimum. Think about it.

Speaker 5:          00:48:02       Oh, I realize too that there's, there's gotta be no one that understands the creepiness of Joe's thing more than women. Of course, you guys are the ones that get bombarded by the guy who's like, I know how to fuck. I want to be with you no matter what. Yeah, it's, it's really never welcome. And here's the thing, the guy that you do want to date, it's never that guy telling you that stuff. Right. It's always the creeper who you're trying to, the guy that you do, you wish would say that to you, like probably you're not sure if he's going to call, you know? But yeah, just a regular, yeah, he's, it's never, it's never a wanted thing generally. Of course. Let me tell you a crazy shit like that. And what's this here

Speaker 14:         00:48:46       chose sex life. You know, he's really great guy. He taught me a lot about ventilation. One Hansen, he damaged his right hand in a fight with my first husband. But you know what? I had to deal with insurance money out of the past. You don't need to know about that shit anyway. So I think you should try him out. I think you should go full throttle. I think that um, one thing about him is SOM Yukata make sure he takes his meds on. So that's one thing. He's a guy of his pure heart, but you got to make sure he takes his valley. I'm and as valid tracks in a, and if he's not, he just give it to them on a piece of cheese. He'll never know the difference. But I really think the two of you should go full. Trotta I really do. You both like gyms, you know, I hear you both. They both have a lot of similarities and dumb. You know, I think you should do it. Okay. So get him the fuck out my life. Go for this. I just need to move on. You know what? I love the

Speaker 5:          00:50:09       fuck out of my life. No, she did. No kidding. A lot of friends. He built that place. One handed here is Rebecca. Good morning. Julia was me. Joe Ley, you know that meeting you yesterday. It's the best day of my, you're still beautiful flower. I know it was. Might be a little hard to hear for you right now, but I'm making a video. You know what she really nails is the intensity because he's so overwhelmed. She was like doing the thing which you solve. Rom saying it. That's what made the eyes closed. It's emotion. You. I love you. That's called a grounded performance. Yeah, I like it. Good Morning Julia. It's me. Joe,

Speaker 15:         00:51:07       on my way to work here wanting to make you a quick video. Just tell you how gorgeous you ask God. It's good. So gorgeous. When I sniffed your bike, see? Yes. Oh my God. The fragrance took me away.

Speaker 5:          00:51:38       Oh, that's good. She got the creepiness down real aggressive to the women. The women nailed as a creaminess intensity. Yeah. Yeah, you're right that they must feel that. Oh, we feel that and then say that they, Gosh. Oh, here's one more from Olivia.

Speaker 16:         00:51:56       Good morning, Julia. I miss you so much. I've been thinking about you every day since I met you and I've just, you know, I wanted to get you something, so I got you. What dog? Julie, guess what? I named her that Sariah I named after you, so anytime you're not here I can just come out and say good morning. Can't wait to meet you. I know she already loves you so much, just like I do. Right? I love you Julie.

Speaker 5:          00:52:33       She nailed the psychotic lost in love, but this is for you. She named the dog. Keeps saying her name. Well, are you ready for the thing that we've been waiting for for a while? Finally can try to do it right now. All right. We have been in contact with the Giulia from going to my God and I'm going to try to call her right now. Ready? I'm ready. Here we go.

Speaker 11:         00:53:11       I hope she, hello.

Speaker 1:          00:53:24       Good afternoon, Julia.

Speaker 17:         00:53:27       Hi, how are you?

Speaker 1:          00:53:29       I'm great. This is Tom Segura. I'm here with Christina P. And. M. We are so excited, Julia. So excited. Thank you for taking the time to do this call.

Speaker 17:         00:53:44       Oh yes, no problem.

Speaker 1:          00:53:46       I am. So I want to start with one thing. First of all, uh, you know, we didn't know that this, when this was brought to our attention, we didn't know that it was like a thing and then it kind of faded away and it was brought to our attention. Again, we've been mesmerized by it and there's so many different stories about the origin of, of you getting this video, a message on your phone. People said, you know, it was a bar. It was a parking lot. It was the gym. Can you tell us how this actually came about?

Speaker 17:         00:54:20       Yeah. So this took place actually it was about three years ago. Was it? 2015. Okay. Um, I was going to the gym, not to work out, but to Chan and I'm at planet fitness. One of the things you have to do is you sign in. Okay. So I go and I sign in, 15 minutes goes by, you know, I walk out and it's pitch black out. I'm walking to my car to here, my name's Julia Julia. I turned around and like with the house. So I started kind of walking slowly back over to this voice I heard. And as I reach this man, he's older, I'm probably 20 years older than me. I'm kind of like, all right. And he's like, oh, Julia. And I was just like, yeah, do I know you and you my hand him the maybe you know a friend, someone who works there, I have no idea.

Speaker 17:         00:55:07       So he goes, oh, I thought you were really beautiful and I had to talk to you. I looked at the sign in sheet and I had to wait till you came out just to say hello. So I'm standing there like, oh my God, no wonder the bargain. I like terrified. And I'm just like, okay, let's, you know, let's get this going. [inaudible] you know, he's like, oh, you know, can I, can I take you out for dinner or drinks some? At the time I was still kind of talking to an ex boyfriend and I was like, listen, you know, I'm still talking to my ass. I'm hoping something works out. Um, so probably not

Speaker 1:          00:55:41       as you're saying that to him though, you're basically just trying to like ease this guy down. You're like, ah, I'm talking to me. Like you're trying to be sorta diplomatic to let them know that, you know, I'm not trying to be rude, but I'm not interested. Right. It sounds like that.

Speaker 17:         00:55:56       Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

Speaker 1:          00:55:58       You mean things that normal human beings pick up on? I got it. Okay. Keep going.

Speaker 17:         00:56:03       Okay. Um, so he's saying, Oh, you know, let me, let me get your number. So my phone's in my hands. I'm kind of just like, all right, you know, I don't know what to do. So I just kind of handed him thinking, let me get his number so then he doesn't have mine.

Speaker 1:          00:56:17       Oh, okay.

Speaker 17:         00:56:20       Me. So instead of just putting his number and he called with my phone, his phone,

Speaker 5:          00:56:26       uh, Joe's no newbies. Yup.

Speaker 17:         00:56:38       I'm driving to work and I get a check and I'm looking, I said, you know, who the hell is this that there are no tax. It's just a video message. I opened that video and I am mortified. It's six 30 in the morning. I'm like, what the hell? So I didn't tell him, I didn't tell anyone. So I had, um, at the time, three girl roommates, I told no one for about a week and a half, two weeks. Cause I was just like, oh my God, I can't believe this happened. So I get another video a few days later.

Speaker 5:          00:57:17       The car one car one

Speaker 17:         00:57:20       the car, the bar one. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:57:21       This is like my flower.

Speaker 17:         00:57:26       Yes, yes. I respond and I said, Oh, you know, ha ha, you know, still not interested. Um, so little mold. I ended up telling my friends when that, when we're drinking and I'm just like, and you show you guys something really freaked me out and they're like, oh my God, this is hilarious. You just did. On the Internet. I'm like, dateline, like I don't want to go missing. And they're just like, no, no. I'm like, he's like my dad's age and I'm just like, you know, I feel bad. I don't want an embarrassing one time goodbye. My friends share with other people. So I started, you know, everyone just made a joke at him. I got flip videos from my friends, you know, people text me. Good morning, Julia. Um, still a year, a year ago is by, and I get a text from one of my friends and I don't have Twitter, but she does.

Speaker 17:         00:58:25       And she goes, someone's talking posted your video on Twitter. And I was just like, no way. I was like, no way. So that's how that whole girl who went to the bar in Chicago methods, creepy guy named Joe. Uh, how's that rumor got started? So my roommate and she was like, I'm getting, I'm going to tell everyone, I'm just like, okay, I don't care. Do whatever you gotta do. Um, whatever. So video dies down again until you guys can't, I have no idea who sent it to you. And the other day, one of your band messaged me, not sure how they got my Instagram message either they're just like, you know, we found you and uh, you know, I think you should get to the bottom of it and you should call them. And I was just like, you know what, why not? It's been three years.

Speaker 5:          00:59:09       The real story out there. Have you seen, have you seen the fans? Have you seen the fans making their versions? Good morning, Julia

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       videos?

Speaker 17:         00:59:24       Oh my God, yes. Are hilarious. Yes. And there's,

Speaker 1:          00:59:28       we just got through playing six more that were submitted all by women. So it's a women's women's versions of it and it's really hilarious. I mean, so

Speaker 17:         00:59:38       right

Speaker 1:          00:59:38       now back to the, to the, so this guy you, oh, so you told him like, oh my ex and I bobbled so that's why he was bringing that up. Did anything ever come about? Like did you ever run into him again at the gym or anywhere else?

Speaker 17:         00:59:54       Um, I stopped going to the gym shortly after that. They didn't want to run into him, so I ended up switching jam. Oh yeah. My, yeah. But I did find out, one of my friends was like, you know, I'm curious if you has a Facebook. So we took his number, we put it into Facebook and its profile showed up and she goes, oh my God, I went to high school with his kid. Oh, he's about, I'm, yeah. So I'm 28 hours to about 25 at the time she was 19

Speaker 4:          01:00:23       she was, wait, she was in high school with his kid. No kid is a kid. Yeah. With his kid. Oh my God. But he's 20 years older than Eylea that. Yeah.

Speaker 17:         01:00:34       Gotcha. Yeah, no worries. Yeah. So he's definitely a little bit, yeah, exactly.

Speaker 4:          01:00:38       Now, most importantly, Juliet, did you ever have him do the crown molding in your house?

Speaker 1:          01:00:44       The ceiling fans? Do you like it?

Speaker 17:         01:00:48       You know, I have some ceiling fans in my closet right now that I need to be put up, so I might give him a call.

Speaker 1:          01:00:55       The funny, you know, I gotta say it's like it is, you know, I, there's things to laugh at it in the video. Obviously it's so ridiculous. But then I do kind of feel badly for him because I see how desperately it's um, you know, it's unnatural to express that level of love for somebody you just met, but he's just mesmerized by it.

Speaker 4:          01:01:17       Mentally ill psychotic. Yeah. It's psychotic. I'm not, I'm, I'm not your Noah, you're going no, no. You Go Juliet.

Speaker 17:         01:01:27       No, not really quite. I'm not quite sure. I'm not really quite sure cause it's not like it was like a good day that I'm out of like out at the bar. Like I was literally hair up looking like a mess coming from canning. Yeah. I tried it. Two guys a compliment. But I mean he knew what he was doing because at the end of the video when you study, I hope this video didn't scare you.

Speaker 4:          01:01:47       Yes, that's right. Yes. He always stood out to us. He knows. And I'll tell you what's really great about this, Julia, is that because we've exposed this guy for a creeper, it's not fair. First of all, yes, we have empathy for him. But it's not fair that you've had to change your life and your routine, you a different gym and all. Yeah, because this guy doesn't know how to fucking reign it in. And he's so he's an adult. He has, yeah. A kid is his kid, by the way, a girl. Is it a daughter?

Speaker 17:         01:02:16       Um, I think he has two. From what I remember. I think he has two twins. I think one's a boy, one's a girl or boy, I'm not quite sure.

Speaker 7:          01:02:25       Well good. So he's a great example for both. Not quite sure. I know that when our sons, when our son's reached a certain age, I will play that video and be like, don't ever do this to a girl. Okay. Um, yeah. But I would encourage all the women listening to send us your videos of guys being creepy because this shit needs to stop. It's not fair that she has no fair. No, it's not scares. It's not course. No, it's not cool at all.

Speaker 17:         01:02:53       Know. I always found it like as people were before the store again, people were like hating on, you know, hating on me. And it wasn't even me who supposed and they're just like, oh, she would have been younger or the guy would have been is the guy would have been younger and you know, like more her type. Then she would have loved it and I always disagreed with that. I can't stand to come up to me at the bar and it doesn't matter the age or who were you is I think it was that. That's too much. I'm giving them the exact same reaction that I would give Joe. It's not that he's older than I am and why, you know, it's a big deal. It was just creepy, creepy and it was just too much.

Speaker 7:          01:03:35       His game is all so fun.

Speaker 17:         01:03:40       Hey, now I wish, I wish someone would build, build me a house now.

Speaker 7:          01:03:44       Yeah. I mean the thing is too, it's like there's a, we were just talking about the fact that the person that you want to send their love video is never the person that's like, you know what I mean? Like, if you saw like whatever the hottest guy ever is to you, he's never going to send you a video like that. That's the guy who, who you never, you know, he probably doesn't call cause it's just out of it now. What about dating now Julia, are you, are you a single lady?

Speaker 17:         01:04:23       Good. I'm actually wanting to get back together, you know, that's over with.

Speaker 7:          01:04:40       And what is your sense of, uh, what is your current boyfriend? Think of all this nonsense as he amused by it. I'm amused by Joe or what?

Speaker 17:         01:04:50       Oh Man. When I first, just so he's been around probably two and a half of the three years I've been going on. He thought it was hilarious when we first found out and he, he didn't know what he always said. He's like, Oh yeah, you know, go, go talk on a show about a few different places. And I was just like, ah, I don't know. I don't know. So what I told him that you guys, he's like, yeah, just do it. Do it.

Speaker 7:          01:05:14       Would you say that, would you say that you and your current are going full throttle or are you guys kind of like, you know,

Speaker 18:         01:05:22       okay.

Speaker 17:         01:05:23       You know, I shouldn't embarrass them, but I'd like if we went full throttle a little more. Ah,

Speaker 7:          01:05:30       wait till he finds out, we better get on it before you get more videos. So can I ask you to where, where is it, where is Joe from? Where is this region? I mean, give us the general region.

Speaker 17:         01:05:45       East Coast,

Speaker 7:          01:05:46       east coast. I would say jersey. I'm thinking he's north. Central. North. Central East. Okay. He's Darya. Okay. We don't want to give it, you give it four days.

Speaker 17:         01:05:59       I know. I don't want, I don't need gym now.

Speaker 7:          01:06:01       No, no, no, no, no, no. But, uh, okay. That's about right. Yeah, that's about right. Well look, I gotta tell you, oh, go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead.

Speaker 17:         01:06:13       yeah, I was gonna say, I think it's acting kind of gives it away.

Sure. Fun Things. But he really knows this stuff, you know, he does and yeah, I try diaper it talks about that diaper last time

Um, go back and get that one to listen if you haven't heard of that one and look up last time Josh was here, so this time gene, I said, Josh, let's go. Let's do a deep dive. Last time it was pornography. What have you got for me this time? I'll let him introduce it. Josh, what are we talking about?

Speaker 20:         01:14:34       Well, I thought this would be sort of a public service for you, Christina. You think Tom's going to murder you? Probably at some point. That's like a possibility. Yes. Well today we can compare him to some past serial killers and we can see some similarities. Perhaps. Maybe some differences. Maybe you'll be

Speaker 7:          01:14:55       maybe some differences. Maybe you know, a few hearing that maybe you'll be calmed after this, like, oh, I'm not going to get murdered. Right. Thanks. I appreciate it. This Josh. No problem. Um, Josh, who should I pull up first?

Speaker 20:         01:15:08       Well, I brought three cases with me today. Maybe you're familiar with some of them. Maybe you're not.

Speaker 7:          01:15:13       I wait, honestly, only one of the, well, sorry, one of the names is vaguely familiar and then one of the monikers I'm familiar with. Okay. So you're pretty well versed already. I thought it was pulling some obscure. It's still, I don't know a lot about this.

Speaker 20:         01:15:27       Well, let's start with good old. This is recent, by the way. Robert Pickton Aka the pig farmer killer. God a k a pork chop. Rob.

Speaker 7:          01:15:37       Well, he has the same beard shaving technique that my husband does. That's a similarity. That haircut too. I probably could, this front is pretty much gone. I could grow the back out. Ever think about that. Um, I don't know. That's kind of an interesting look. I will say, um, from this profile, it's a, you know, not the worst looking guy. I mean, he's not the most handsome man.

Speaker 20:         01:15:59       There are women, almost a hundred that would agree with you. Holy Shit. That many, well, pork chop rob here. Uh, would you guess that he's a millionaire? He really, he's a millionaire from which is the most fascinating farming. Well, yes, it's from owning a farm. His parents had owned this farm for a hundred years and they bought it for 13 grand in like 1963 and then in 1994, he's found out the farm was worth seven point $2 million on my life. So he sold portions of it here and there every couple of years. Keep that fund verse some millions of dollars. And needless to say, the farming went to shit. They weren't really doing that anymore, but he still had a lot of hogs on the farm, including a 600 pound boar that would like patrol the farm and, and bite and things.

Speaker 7:          01:16:53       Did he put his talents into another field when it wasn't farming? Did He do other things?

Speaker 20:         01:16:57       In fact, he did. He uh, made a non for profit organization out of his farm called the piggy palace. Good Times place. And it was a society that would hold events and parties for organizations so that, that farm of his became a party zone. Can I pull up this farm? Yes, of course. Yes. This is what the farm looked like. Very vast. That barn right there held many of parties for vagrants and sex workers and hell's angels. Lots of cool rad people were partying with the piggy palace boys

Speaker 5:          01:17:35       and our man here. Uh, was it the pork, the pork man porkchop rob door, chuck Robb. Um, his target though was lady.

Speaker 20:         01:17:45       Yes. Ladies of the night sex workers in particular. Oh. And uh, when you would hold these parties, of course it would attract those people. They'd come and do drugs and drink and then he would rape and murder them. Subsequently you, yeah. So eventually one of the workers of the farm kind of noticed, you know, all these women that are coming around here seem to go missing. So something's up. And uh, eventually, uh, an investigation was held. This investigation was so thorough. They called it the ground zero of Canada. Why? Because they had to bring in heavy machinery, excavators, things of that nature so that they could find human remains and they hadn't had an undertaking quite like that since Ground Zero in nine 11 oh my God. Because there were very few remains left DC. What rob did, the reason he is the pork shop king is because he would feed the women and their remains to the pigs. Okay. And then he would take the pigs and make bacon and things and sell it to the public. Oh my God.

Speaker 5:          01:18:57       Did you know about this? Tom? Why are you laughing? Psycho? Pretty crazy. Yeah. There was a name

Speaker 20:         01:19:05       or who is like, I bought Bacon from that guy all the time and now he has to live with himself that he aid basically. Yeah, a lady. It could you imagine just going about your day.

Speaker 5:          01:19:15       Wow. So he might kill and dismember and then feed that to the pigs. Right. And then tailor the Higgs and make Bacon and yes, I really, great way to get rid of evidence. A brilliant, right. I mean, I mean he's a millionaire. Yes. The thing is, that's a good thing about capitalism. You can always exploit something to your advantage. We've talked about this forever. What's the best way to dispose of a body? And I think we found it now feeding it to the pigs and then selling, well we have some clubs

Speaker 20:         01:19:41       they can. So they convicted him of 27 murders. That's a lot, right in this clip he adds to the number a little bit. So this is, uh, this is him in, he's already in, in a jail cell in a, in uh, his cellmate has been undercover for months embedding himself in order to get a confession out of him. Cause like I said, this investigation at the farm so thorough and also not really raising a lot of answers. They're spending millions of dollars to investigate. And so they need to this guy to get a confession. That's really, are you really all the darkest motherfucker? I know how much knowledge you have. Let's, let's, uh, let's watch these cloves. Tell me what's going on here. Okay.

Speaker 13:         01:20:29       Yeah.

Speaker 20:         01:20:32       Well it's kind of inaudible there, but just saying that he's, that he got sloppy. Yes, he got sloppy at the end and he's lamenting in that fact. He's saying, you know, I, if I woulda kept my shit right and tight, I would have fucking murdered more bitches, you know? Yeah. And the officer is saying, oh, but it's just like, oh, that's fucked up and stuff, you know? Yeah. He's not doing a real good job. The officer.

Speaker 13:         01:20:54       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:21:02       Yeah. Do you wanted one more? He said he couldn't, so he confessed to 49 and you want to add one more to make an even fig make the big five

Speaker 20:         01:21:08       zero. Yeah. So like what was Mayweather when he went did exactly like 49 all right. Sound is nicest. You have to get that 50 you get that big 50 spots. Half a hundred yes. Gotta be a thrill to do this. All right, here is, let's see, there was a stop so you can go relieve yourself of that

Speaker 8:          01:21:29       early 2007

Speaker 13:         01:21:30       Oh,

Speaker 20:         01:21:37       that's right, officer. It is math. That's good math. Yeah. They're just kind of reconfirm. He's like, yeah man. Fucking imagine if I had gotten 50 yeah. So he's just like, man, I'm a real cool dude. I, I coulda got 50 trying to talk to the officer. Like he's one of his, yeah.

Speaker 13:         01:21:59       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:21:59       It's a theme that will carry on through all this, by the way,

Speaker 20:         01:22:02       is injecting women with, I didn't, I, you know, you wonder how do they kill him? Do they strangle him, stab him and stuff? It turns out a lot of them were just injecting things like antifreeze into their veins or Windex was used. All these like in five to 10 minutes, they're dead. That's all it takes. And I didn't know that. I mean, yeah, you might want to write that one down. Don't write that down. Damn you. Where'd you find this footage? This is, I didn't know that.

Speaker 8:          01:22:27       This is your guest is fighting that if this footage, you gotta read this audience, they can't hear anything.

Speaker 20:         01:22:39       So he's saying, uh, the, the killer saying another party says, yeah, I mean all this, all, they fucking got a lot of stuff on me. Um, and then the officer says no. Oh Shit. Hey. Yeah, Canadian. That's yes. That's what, that's, that's why it's, what is it not part of it? I don't really know because, well, what's happened? Like I said, he was convicted of 27 murders. Oh. So he's saying like that's why it's here. He's admitting. He's like, that's why you know, I, I killed way more. Yeah. But it's not part of it cause they don't know. But I got sloppy at the end, so they found some, uh, wow. So now they're going after him for even while he's dead. He got he, he died. He's dead. He died naturally. Sure. Yeah. But just somebody kill him. Ah, Shit I should have, that's one part.

Speaker 20:         01:23:29       I didn't look it up. Hold on. Let's see. That's tragic. High. Are you really sad that that guy's dead time? Not Sad. He died at 69. Hey, nice. Say Hey and I'll have you know that a farm is being made to a children's park now. Yeah. Morbid thing to do, right? He's this Christ. Well, you know that murderer land is discount land. Uh, one time I had lunch with the guy bought the Charles Manson murder house. He ended up being a television producer anyways. He got it at a significant discount because those Manson murders murders happened there. Was he stoked that that went down there? Yeah, I mean, not stuck, but he was like, oh, it was cheaper because no one wanted to live here. I'm like, yeah, no shit. Also, I had to change the street address. That's terrible, Tom. So how hard are you right now having watched that?

Speaker 20:         01:24:15       Well, I'm glad there's a desk here. I'll just say that. Um, these next fellows, these ones you might remember from your childhood call one second. I just wanted to see. Yes, we had you so terrifying. Potter. I'm just looking to see like what his cause of death, but I can't really see just evil baby. No, I just wanted to see if there was, if he was, if he himself was killed. I don't think they have death penalty and they don't. I meant like an inmate or something. Oh, I see. I see. But somebody injected him with Windex. He probably died of some cardiovascular thing. Eating all that pork doesn't show that he's dead. Oh, okay. So he's not done. He's not that he could very well be living. I mean this again happened, he was put in jail 10 years. It was not fair though.

Speaker 20:         01:25:03       He got life in prison. Yeah. Why is that not fair? I mean, I mean, you know, like why don't you give the guy a shot to get out there and make some rehabilitation has been saying that for so long that the prison system does not rehab criminals enough. It's crazy. This guy's just a lost cause. Yeah, he is super smart. I mean his whole scheme was really intelligent. Right. To set up a non for profit to hold parties to get, I mean good on him for having that Shithole farm and getting a bunch of hookers to come hangout. That's true. I mean he was getting laid a lot, you know, so I mean maybe not take it as far as murdering them, but he was definitely getting his date. Then again, when you murder them, you don't have to, he's saving money too. We didn't think about it.

Speaker 20:         01:25:49       He's making money. Right. Oh right, right. It's going to feed them to the pigs. Pork meat. Yeah. So he's getting more out of the pig when, when I take that away from him, um, who we have next? Well these ones, like I said, you might remember from your childhood because these dudes were chilling in La. No, no, these are the hillside strangler and aware of them. Look at those two. Cool. Damn it. These guys actually they did all their dastardly deeds here in la, but there from where I live, western New York, a Rochester, New York is where they were born. So there you go. Product of Rochester, New York right there. That's Kenneth Biyanki and Angelo blown. Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:26:30       I remember it seemed like empty dark eyes here. And this guy seems like he's got a good sense of humor.

Speaker 20:         01:26:35       He's a real, that guy. I mean they're both real pieces of shit. Yeah. The guy on the right, uh, he's described as a are self described as a world renowned car upholster. Oh yeah. Which is actually hate this segment or pretty much goes with murdering people. I mean you gotta, you gotta read a pollster your car. So what was the, what was there? So they were western New York guys while Kenneth there was getting into a lot of trouble out in western New York and he thought, I gotta get Outta here. I got to find a new life. So he hooks up with his cousin Angelo there who lives in La and who's, uh, a real to do out here, a real mover and shaker, you know, real upholstering cars. Uh, he's a a real ladies' man apparently. And so when they arrived, they started, you know, hanging out together. They decide, you know, sense Angela such a ladies' man, why don't we prostitute women? Oh right. Natural, make some money to go. Yeah. So they started doing this, you guys, exactly. These guys are trying to make a quick buck and a, they know how to do it and so eventually it start pimping out women. And

Speaker 5:          01:27:43       uh, why, why did the sex workers always get it? You know what I mean? Those are nice ladies. Those are high a grade. He's just trying to make money. And then time and time again, I would date a sex worker over a regular girl. Of course, hands down. But why is your reasoning? Because I feel like I have the right frame of mind. I don't get jealous. I wouldn't like bother. I think you would actually come. You would be great. Yeah. It'd be great for dating like a porn girls dominate traits about him already. Like what would he, cause he doesn't want to because some of the things he just said, I think he would be like really? He's the guy who wouldn't be bothered. You know he'd be, he's so, he wouldn't be weird.

Speaker 20:         01:28:24       Get Jealous and like even on a lower level like a bartender or like a Hooters waitress or something. I would love to watch them work and like pray on some dude and be like flirting with him just to get their cash and then we take their cash home and like smoke weed and watch Netflix. You

Speaker 5:          01:28:39       kind of a cook thing you like, it's not a cook thing cause it's not like I'm getting off on it but I can just accept that that's rolls with it. I can accept that that's the way they make money and they can separate that from them. Loving me. Josh is also low maintenance and adaptable. Yes. So like whatever the circumstances, he's just going to go with it. I'm like water baby. I flow,

Speaker 20:         01:29:02       he flows. But I imagine I would have like a sex worker just because I imagine they've seen it all. They've done been there, done that. They're probably really sympathetic, kind BYO. Oh, of course. I've been through everything, you know? Yeah. He would be a good match on that level. And then every once in a while he'd be like, you know, why don't you eat my scrum? And she'd be like, yeah, because she'd be, and she'd be like, I'm the best of that. And Blah, blah. Nothing phases. I checked. No, no. True. And into what your point is. No one really gives a shit about the sex workers and that's why these two dumb dumbs got away with shit for so long because it wasn't. Yes, there's one of their dead holes. Jesus. Yeah, no problem. Strangled body. Yes. They found this body, I forget which, where that one was fun because they were littering them throughout La County and uh, they were found on the same days.

Speaker 20:         01:29:52       When did this happen? This is the 70s, late seventies. And it wasn't until they raped and murdered two sex workers. Oh. People started giving a shit. People are like, Ooh. And then they kind of connected the dots from there. And was it a, was the nostrils workers just like girls they met at a bar kind of thing? Uh, no. They were 12 year olds. No. What's the RFD line? Is that a bus line? Do you know that? Oh, our TTD. The rapid transit. I wasn't sure if that's what that meant or if it was like a short bus or something. No. Okay. Our bus system and then, I don't know what they call it now. Rtd, but yes, they found them. Uh, they got off of stop there last they were seeing and then they were getting into a car driven by one of these dudes and a, that was the end of them.

Speaker 20:         01:30:39       That's when people started that sniff and no kids though. Yes. But to them it was almost the same thing. These guys were the typical guys that like once they're pimping business went dry, they're like these fucking whores. No one cares about them. Right. I bet no one would care if they went missing. And then they started like laughing about that and then they started cruising around in their car posing as undercover police officers. That's how they would, oh my God. Yes, they fake badges. Oh my God. And then how did they get caught? They got caught because they were just sloppy. They were littering these bodies about no one really connected the dots until they murdered those two non sex workers. And then they were kind of like, Whoa, this is similar to this and this and this. And then through their, one of their, um, attempted victims. What was this chick's name? Uh, it was the daughter of an actor. It's a, her name is Catherine. Laura Baker. It's Peter Laura's daughter. Oh my God. So they attempted to kill her and they abducted her and everything and they aborted it because they found a picture of her on her father's lap and they're like, no shit. You're Peter Lauren's daughter. I love him. They let her go. Why?

Speaker 20:         01:31:52       They found a picture of her on her father's lap, like in her belongings and Peter Lorre from from m is for murder or whatever is great. I love this guy because he played like a killer or whatever. I'm also now, now I'll have, you know, I know this is a running theme. I can cry to fellows had their own ride or die and FTD RTD. Yes. Really. Victoria Compton's her name. There she is. This woman was so in love with Kenneth Biyanki. Oh my God. That she, once they were captured and they were in jail and on trial, she attempted to lure and uh, kill a woman in a motel to make it look like the hillside. Stranglers were still on the loose and we'll hack. And Kenneth even gave her some dude from jails Jizz to plant. So it looked like a rate and she was about to do all that. But she fucked up. She fucked up. Yeah, she got caught. But did she kill someone? No, she got like, it wasn't a test. She fucked it all up. Got got caught for it.

Speaker 4:          01:32:59       It was an attempt. I tell you it's how you wouldn't do those things that she attempted to strangle. Yes. I never understand what the, the attraction is. Is it women who like that kind of power that the serial killer has? I don't know. Is it the the perception of yeah, like strength and power. Cause a lot of women like Charles Manson, he had a wife before he died and he gets celebrity celebrity, average Ramirez. The Richard Mirrors, right? Yeah, the, the night stalker. He had chicks into him.

Speaker 20:         01:33:27       Even like, uh, the dude who shot up Aurora movie theater was like chicks were sending him nudes and stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:33:33       Oh yeah. Manson. All the girls were in love with Charles Manz even though he didn't technically murder anybody. Right. Tom, you're always bringing that point up to me. He told people look younger, but they followed his orders. Right, right, right. I mean bad guy. Worst Guy, but I dunno, it was worst guy. Um, but yes, Victoria would, you wouldn't do any of those things? No. No, not for time. I throw his ass in jail. She's still alive. By the way. Do you think we could at least send her a shirt and FTD? Our team. Oh my gosh. She deserves that. If anyone does, she's the real deal. He says she's the Ogf tea RTD men.

Speaker 20:         01:34:09       I mean, who's ges? Would you plant on a person? If you are going to frame them for murder, he was evil.

Speaker 4:          01:34:17       You'd have to extract the ges to, Oh, how do you even asking? Wow. What did they do to get it?

Speaker 20:         01:34:27       I know this guy, he got some random dude in the prisons jizz cheese money for it and I was like, dude, got killed back. A smokes all jerk off into this cup.

Speaker 4:          01:34:39       Really only probably had lord. I'm with like, I just like to drink it. Will you just leave it in a cup for me? All right, put this in a body. There's no way. He was like, what I'm going to do is smuggle this. Just have it planted on some. Thinking about the logistics, how do you smuggle ges out of a prison? Oh, there's tons of ways. What Josh,

Speaker 20:         01:34:58       what are you talking about? The little smuggle all kinds of knives and guns. Dope. Is is liquid. I mean you could smuggle that. You could just like smuggle it in your mouth. I'll and France. Nobody

Speaker 5:          01:35:10       get a Dixie Cup or something and he's little ball it out. All right guys. Okie doke. There's tons of ways. Okay, well, interesting. Well thank you. What a ray of sunshine you've been. There's a Jesus. Now there's one more gentleman is my favorite. I hate the segment right now. Let me get back to filthy porn. I'm so terrified right now. Bullies terrifies. Scary. This is not Christina crime. That last one was pretty. That was pretty bad. I'm so scared.

Speaker 20:         01:35:38       This guy is now. I mean, I don't even know if I want to tell you about this guy anymore. Sounds like it's going to be bad. This Guy Albert fish is his name. Oh, look at that guy. You think he could make some great youtube videos if he had it back in the day, right? He's just sweet. Imagine that guy asking you to come over and Piss on him.

Speaker 5:          01:35:58       Okay.

Speaker 20:         01:35:59       Sky Empty in there. Oh, you don't have to. No fucking idea. He's full, but not with a soul. No, she looks like a refugee. This gentlemen is a child rapist

Speaker 5:          01:36:11       and accountable. I can't hear this shit. I'm a mother of two, you know that I can't even walk. What's that? That, what is

Speaker 20:         01:36:20       that? This guy has a fucked up life. Okay. He was born into a terrible home. His mother was an alcoholic, a prostitute, and she sent him away to an orphanage where he was beat by nuns and shit cause it's like the 18 hundreds. And he started to enjoy the beatings a little bit too much. So as he grew up, this guy even got married, had kids at six fucking kids and it's uh, noted that he did never was known to attack or abuses on children, but he would have them and their friends slap his ass with that little guy right there with nails coming through it. Yes. Okay. And that is not even the expense, like mild for this cool dude and this far as what he likes. This is kids to do that. Yes. Hey Son. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, why don't you get your friend bill to come over and slap dad's ass with the fucking with nail nail pat.

Speaker 20:         01:37:18       Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hold this guy also enjoyed a little activity. Now I don't know if you've seen Tom doing this or caught him doing it. It's would be a red flag. But go ahead. This guy liked to uh, put rose stems up his urethra. Yes. I've seen them posing a mirror with it, with those in there. This guy, this guy right here is a pioneer by the way. He's like a g o d in the body modification community can be clearly. Yeah, he has, like I have noted there are five aspects of body modification people do for like enjoyment today that this guy was all about like a play piercing. For instance. Uh, this guy, you stick inserts, sewing needles under his fingernails as a game and he has to do with not only that, when he was a debt, when he died, they found 29 sewing needles in his pelvis that he would insert through.

Speaker 20:         01:38:19       I'll, let's see if I get this word right. The perineal. Do you know where that is? Yeah, yeah, exactly. It's your tank. He'd, he would stay those on them up in there. And there is a, I don't know if I included that picture. That's a crime scene. I might've, I did. I can't believe I forgot to include the picture of the x ray of his pelvis with all those needles in it. Now what is this letter here? Is this audio someone read that's an audio drama to [inaudible] of a letter that he wrote. This is how he got caught. Because eventually, like all of them, they get sloppy. Yep. But this, that's the time, by the way, the time to get away with things late 18 hundreds early 1,980 course. Oh, before forensic. Yeah. DNA. And so Albert's like toward the end of his life, right?

Speaker 20:         01:39:03       He has been doing all this shit. He's into all this like a torture and everything like that. He loves all that crap. What he decides now he reads an ad in a paper where an 18 year old gentlemen is talking about, he's like hardy stock looking for citizenship. You know, this is like the 18 hundreds classified. This guy's looking for work. So Albert answers the ad just to go check, Holla at your boy thinking like, I'm going to eat this fucking guy. Yeah. Uh, because he loves eating human beings. And so he shows up there and he meets the Guy Thinking, I'm going to murder this guy. But then he meets his little sister and is like, nope, I'm eating hurt. Oh Geez. So then he like tells him like, I'll come back and let you know about the job. I'll be back here in a little bit and we'll talk about it. So he comes back and he goes, you know what? It's my nieces birthday. Okay. You mind if I take grace to the party? And they're like, yeah, go ahead. Creepy old man. What? And they let him do that and they never saw her again. And then years later after, you know, she's been missing. I mean, they assume she's dead probably, you know, but they don't know have any answers. He sends them this anonymous letter, uh, which I gave you a dramatic reading of it. I really don't want to hear this jar.

Speaker 21:         01:40:20       My dear. Mrs Bud on June 3rd, 1928 I called on you at four oh six West 15th Street and brought to you pot, cheese and strawberries. We had lunch. Grace sat on my lap and kissed me, right.

Speaker 20:         01:40:37       Oh No, thank you. Taking her to a party, you said yes, she can go to

Speaker 21:         01:40:42       an named Dee home in Westchester. I had already picked out when we got there. I told her to remain outside. She picked wild flowers. I went upstairs and stripped all my clothes off. I knew if I did not, I would get our blood on them.

Speaker 7:          01:40:59       Oh no thank you. Push. No, no, no more.

Speaker 21:         01:41:01       Can't. I can't. I can't. Went to the window and called her and I hid in the closet until she was in the room. When she saw me all naked, she began to cry and tried to run downstairs. I grabbed her and she said she would tell her Mama, there's a twist. I stripped her naked. How she did kick by 10 scratch. I choked her to death and Carter into small pieces so I could take the meat to my rooms, cook and eat it. How sweet and tender her little ass was roasted in the oven. It took me nine days to eat her in time.

Speaker 7:          01:41:41       Shit. But

Speaker 21:         01:41:43       no, I did not fuck her though. I could have if I wished she died a virgin.

Speaker 7:          01:41:51       Well that is the nice solace at the end, Huh? Right side to all that. Cause you not fucking bring kid things over. Come on man. I can't hear this stuff. Albert fish though. Kind of a pioneer. He was eating ass before. It was cool. Okay. Right. Find a real, you find a real savage out there. You've got to get her to Albert Fish, ladies and gentlemen, Josh.

So we just wrapped up the, um, one of the most deprived and depressing segments, everyone of this show. And uh, we want to keep that energy rolling. So we brought in one of the most deprived human beings we could ever think of it to have on here. I will say this, man, I'm not always an early adapter.

Speaker 7:          01:43:21       I feel like I was an early adapter early fan of Kyle done against Instagram page, the funniest Instagram page. I think you might've been the very first. It was the first person that like posted something of mine that, that blew it up. Well, and did you send Joe Rogan stuff? Oh, so yeah, you started my whole, uh, Instagram year and Tom Talks about your Instagram feed to me and got me on it. Did you, were you annoyed or where you were like, oh, this is great Instagram fan. So when I saw your shit I was like, this is great. Here's the thing too is like the, I I've talked about this many times on the show that um, throughout my life, nothing makes me laugh harder still than getting a reaction of disgust or contempt for my mother on something. Like it's still the thing, it's like it's in the DNA where it reminds me of like, you know, burping at the table and being like chastised for doing that.

Speaker 7:          01:44:19       And it would make me laugh. And that video that you do where you do the chicken, but one where I was like, is this real? And like did you really first one was real surprise her. Sometimes she, but she'll know I'm doing something man. The, the fact that the shit out of her. Right. I remember this one. So this bit was like he's doing a character, you're doing a with Craig or, and, and you're going like, hey mom. And she was like, what? I guess what, what chicken button? And she's like, all right. And then like she's on the phone, mom. Guess what man? And she's like, she's doing that thing like I'm on. And You keep like, cause it feels like you know a kid basically like I know what you're talking. She's like, Oh for crying what? Chicken Butt? And then it just keeps building until you do it.

Speaker 7:          01:45:13       She was in the bathroom and then like in the middle of the night she's like, oh it's fluorescent. Had those two are set up. But that was perfect. Nailed it. Yeah, she's good. She nailed it. She gets nervous and uh, uh, self doubt, which I recognized that was you fooled me cause I was like Holy Shit. She's, it's four in the morning and she's like, oh chicken by. Yeah. So that was like its own lane of a type of video style. But then I think what's really blown up is like your face swap character. Um, cause you have, you know, like you do Trump ones, the Jenners the Kardashians. Yeah. Baby.

Speaker 7:          01:45:57       Yeah. They, uh, I first started just doing straight up and then I was trying to figure out how to get them to talk to each other cause it's people who have done it where they just cut back and forth. So I thought about the facetiming so can all see them at once, which works for the town. When you do that family, you're so good at the I put a new one up today. Yeah. This shit makes me why you left your house burned down for a minute there. I thought I was going to suffer the shame. Famous my nuts. Shack. You get all your, the first thing I did when I saw the flames just grabbed my crotch and my Alexander McQueen stiletto pumps. Yeah. Then I ran back to get my Louis Vuitton alligator duffle bag show. Beautiful.

Speaker 10:         01:46:50       Like demands attention shy 17 Jimmy Choo and my dog checkers. But there was only enough time to save tool. Those things girls. Oh, I think Sophie's choice. What's that? What did you choose? Oh, checkers is fucking dad. Yeah. I had at least she's got my old balls and stick to play with up us.

Speaker 7:          01:47:14       Oh Man. Oh my God. You do that? Vacant Kardashians think so, man. Oh yeah. Just put one up. Oh, this job one sounds great. Yeah. CAITLIN's, wow. I love when people jump in. I like when stormy jumps in on somebody's. Yeah. Really funny. Yeah. Caitlin jumps in on now and they're going to their magic and hit him from the lady I love about stormy two. Stormy's character is basically an invention in a way. Like it's not really that storming body. Yeah. I don't know how she talks about it's perfect. You're like, oh yeah, that's the perfect character. If they want you to imagine. Yeah. He's like, Oh, I'm not going to swallow. You can knock anyone fucking your whole cog. Gotcha. Halfway down. Can we watch this one? Yeah. Let's watch it. This is the, this is a, what do you call it? Hot off the press premiere.

Speaker 7:          01:48:00       Okay. And we got who we got here. Let's Dr Phil and Bill Maher. Bill, what the Fuck Your Bill Maher impression you always knew you could do bill. Uh, I've done it for a few years. Yeah. Do you remember doing him? Like did you used to watch, you know, whatever his show was? Yeah and I yeah I was auditioning for like mad TV or something and sort of try to get it done and someone told me once about like people who nail it, I've always like, you know, oh my God, I just got a flashback to auditioning for mad TV. Yeah, me too. I did a couple of times I feel, I feel the chill cause like I remember that I was doing something that was working like yeah, joke wise. And then she goes like, do you do any impressions? And I go like, Nah. And she goes, and I remember her specifically going tried Jack Black and I was like, no.

Speaker 7:          01:48:49       Okay. And I was like, I'm Jack Black. Hi, I'm Jay. I was like, Hey, what's up? Like just imagine something just spiraling out of control. And she was like, yeah, now that didn't really work. I'm like, yeah, I didn't come in here saying I do a Jack Black impression and your left, you left her with that impression. And then she was just like, yeah, that wasn't really a, yeah, yeah. Spot on. Impression, the Jack Black and I was like, I know a random person. To me it has to be hard about those mad TV auditions back in the day is that everyone was probably doing the same fucking impressions is it was the same. He was like Brittany Spears for walking. Yeah. You really have to blow people away with something original like that. It's so hard. I went in, I auditioned for, sorry live and you know they fly out to New York and everything and while ago.

Speaker 7:          01:49:34       Yeah, 2010 okay. And I, I like had evidence would be the most nerve wracking thing. Right? I was out of my mind because like you're in a hotel room for two days by yourself running. I just ran it over and over and I was like minutes and then I get there and I just was not in a place where I could perform. I was just so nervous. Seriously. Yeah. And I was like please not first. And they were like, first up is Kyle done again? God. And then they are miking man, I could tell I was, I didn't have my a fist. They can't get to your facilities when you're nervous, when you're really nervous. You couldn't even see the guy counting me in was this the camera and goes, I'll count you in three, two, one you'll write in your stuff. It was really intense.

Speaker 7:          01:50:17       Three to one. So I go out there, I'm really hanging onto this and I walk out there and like Lorne Michaels, everyone's on a table over here to the left. And I just walked down. I kind of stood there like waiting and nothing was happening. And then Lauren goes, hello, like hello? Like say hi to us. I was like, oh hi, hi. Sorry. And I just kept staring, waiting for that, count it. And the guy told me it was coming, it wasn't coming. And then Lauren goes, are you okay? Which is like the auditions now over the not started. So then I started to explain that, well that guy and that guy goes three, two, you didn't wanna get in trouble. And I couldn't, like I was trying to do, build, the voices weren't coming out of my mouth. I was just too nervous.

Speaker 7:          01:51:01       I'm scared. But they, in their defense, they have to, you gotta be able to perform live and yeah, it should be a nerve wracking, a addition, whole law. He's nice. And that's a nice thing to encourage young. The uh, I was talking to one of the Africa, one of the big comedy casting directors here in town and I just for something with her and I was like, you know, every time you're the best, like she's always super sweet. Um, makes, makes the situation, Juliet, Juliet might be great. It makes you feel really engaged and you know what I mean? Like if she goes like, do you have any questions? If you're like, I dunno. Do you have anything to add to? Yeah, we, the thing is I think they're really looking for it to be read like this. You're like, I've had, I have, uh, I was still used to her a few times.

Speaker 7:          01:51:50       She cast me in something and then I went to another one where I asked the same way where I was like, uh, is there anything that you want to tell me about it? And she's like, that's for you to decide. Oh, I was like, oh, so the answer is no. You're going to have anything to share. Like you just, you don't have to be a dick about it. Like, yeah, there's like a, I stopped going to auditions. I don't know why I have an agent. I write the checks and I go, wow, what's this? You got me zero things. Yeah. In like a decade. No, auditions even. I went on an audition a year and a half ago. That's the last audition. Yeah, I got it. And then never got another audition for you now I may got it. I should leave. That was just one of those things where it's on your to do list. Oh yeah, yeah. No, I usually leave today. Yeah, send the email on the way out. Okay, cool. I mean, seriously. Yeah, but then he gives you, you know, you go, well, what if something comes up? But no, but you get another agent

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       though. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, you're, you're not wrong. Yeah. Yeah. Um, all right, so we got Dr Phil, we got Bill Maher and we have, that's what I can do. I can be alone, not auditioning. You just make something. It's hilarious. Right? That's the thing is that you found this, I'm always so amazed at people that take what's given to them in technology. Like what you've done with face swapping and then how are you, I don't know what you're using to even, I can't give away my seat. Oh, how do I build it? Yeah. I'll just do the one who talks the most first and I'll, I'll make like a script. So when I'm talking I'll be talking in my mouth. So at times out when I have to do the other ones, I'll say their lines. I love this DIY entertainment purposes just for silly, but people, this is what comedians are so great at it.

Speaker 5:          01:53:38       It's like he's taking what's available. We've taken what's available to you in this time and space, the technology and then making it work for what you do and making it work in your favor. Like it's, I just think it's so great. I have a lot of free time. Such a great era we live in. Yeah, it is cool how open it is and the things that are going to be coming or going to be surprising. I'm not sure what to make it. If you want to make it, you're fucking making this show is fucking Megan. Just make it all right here. Here's the latest and greatest, the newest version, a from Kyle done against Instagram page. It's at Kyle Dunnigan one. Here we go.

Speaker 10:         01:54:12       Okay guys. I got someone to fill out a person for the golf game tomorrow, but it's a girl. Okay. Oh good. Is she a hot piece of ass clothes? She's older and use to have a penis. Oh, not Caitlyn again, if she hits from the ladies tees this time I'm not fucking playing. Okay. No, no, we, I looked great meds. Chased this time now big. Get her on the horn. Oh, Haribo eyes. I'm going to wear my Vera Wang Miniskirt tomorrow. Yap. Or as I like to call it, my Vira no ag Gabay man. Caitlin, we respect you as a woman. So we want to be delicate here. You're going from the men's tees. You've got dude DNA. Sorry. Watch your mouth. Ash. How well you were the number one male athlete in the world. You're not starting 40 fucking yards ahead of us. Okay. Why are you pushing his head from the ladies tees? And I'll hit from the pros and still kick your panty. Asher's we, I don't know. Is it weird that just gave me a boner

Speaker 5:          01:55:10       doctor Phil. Oh Great. I love it. It's so fucking funny, man. Thank you. Will you, uh, you started my uh, uh, W I don't wanna call explosion cause people have a lot more followers. But you got over 400,000, I think I had 19,000 when you've posted a no, I have like 407. So that's was wild. Then you start posting seven. My Shit. Do you feel like I owe you? Yeah, of course. Of course. Yeah, absolutely. Especially like after what you put me through and, um, where are we did odd together and you made me

Speaker 7:          01:55:43       go in your dressing room and like, why should you do all this stuff? That was a bad time. That's lifetime. That's what you owe me for. Um, I'll tell you later off my, I don't want to get her showing up for a lady's ears. Um, but the bill Maher one is just, I don't think sometimes there's public figures who you realize, oh, I've never heard an impression of that person. And then when you do it, that's the one that's, that's what, what stands out about Bill Maher? I don't think I've ever heard someone do an impression. And when you do the impression I have to double check. It's not him talking. You paypal, I went on a trip with him. You did. This is so random, but like military, well I was going, I was going to Hawaii with my girlfriend and uh, she missed a plane and it broad, so she a bitch.

Speaker 7:          01:56:31       It was Sarah Silverman. You Fendler God, Bill Marras good friends with her and he's like, just come on our plane. You know, he had his own private jet so he went on there and it clearly like he was bummed I was a tag along. Ah, Timmy. He was anyway. Yeah, he really was. He made no effort to make me feel at all comfortable. But look, by the way, Ron, huge shocker. I mean bill seems like the kind of guy that would go out of his way to make everybody feel comfortable. He had never heard a story where it was like, oh, and then build it this. I did a standup show with him ages ago, over a decade ago, and I was on the same lineup as him and he kept asking me to bring him drinks and I was like, I'm a comic. And I did tell him like two times.

Speaker 7:          01:57:19       I'm not a waitress here, bro. Like I can't even remember. It was so long ago was it was at a restaurant. We don't want all fair and bringing me a drink. Yeah. Yeah. How would you say you bring me a drink? Sweethearts. Sweeter. I was in a, he was in a dressing room and at the Pasadena Club was ice house and it's packed and there's nowhere to let go hang like all the comedians have to be and he kicked everyone out of the dressing room or I'll just stand there like he, he did, we're not, we weren't allowed her own in the green room. You know, it's weird. We're all standing in the hallway because bill needs the green room. Bill needs his space so it needs a space to read over what the riders told him to say tonight. Okay, fine. Yeah. Um, you know, it's always amazing to me when people are like that because it's so much easier just to be nice to people.

Speaker 7:          01:58:11       But then you learn their store and you'll, oh, they make sense. I get that. I didn't learn too much about someone because you always end up liking them, you know, you go, oh, that's why they're like that. Why is he like that? It's probably a combination of stuff maybe ignored by girls and he's younger and maybe a, I don't know. His Dad did something and we saw being tough is a way of getting respect. Sure. He looks at people who are nice as weak. That's what Trump is like a little bit, but that's big in my culture and Hungarian stuff. Yeah. If you're like,

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       Americans are like donkeys to them. Kind of like my step mom. Like if we go to a restaurant and the waiter will be super nice, like, Hey folks, how you doing? It was met with contempt. You calling goes folks, we got to fight and like it's seen as total weakness. Yeah. Interesting.

Speaker 7:          01:58:56       Yeah. Well that Rooskie culture too. You know the, you know the, if you see the like Putin a photo ops, it's always oh yeah. Oh yeah. Because they think were goofballs. If we go like, yeah, smile, joy. Oh yeah. Like what are you a fucking clown? Yeah. Like soft smiling. Why are you smiling? So say, yeah. Who's that? That's cultural. Yeah. These are always not smiling photos. Yeah. It started like, oh, right. Like if you look at early photography, I guess they just stand there for so long. That's why. Yeah, that's true. But it's every photo like early twenties thirties everyone's like, yeah. And that's, that's the lovely photo of the person. Just a marriage, like my grandparents marriage photo. They're just like, it looks like on a terrible time. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:59:43       Yeah. So if I, I try because I want to look cool. You know how some people, comedians can take pictures with fans and they keep a straight face and they look really interesting. Like it's like they're making a choice. I look so unfriendly when I don't smile. You always look on friendly. Really? Well, you didn't want to, oh, it's the worst. Like I just looked so depressed and like, what does he look?

Speaker 7:          02:00:04       Let me see. Well, it's very slight,

Speaker 4:          02:00:08       really. It feels very like eastern blocky and shitty. Some people have got formed around a frowny, oh, I don't have a frowny, but you carry, you look like you care to be look cool and no, that's the thing is I want to look cool. Yeah. And then every time someone wants to take a photograph with me, I'm so amazed that anybody wants to, yeah. But I'm like, I'm like, oh, yeah, sure. Okay. Yeah, no, I got to do it like I'm too excited. [inaudible] song on too long mirror,

Speaker 7:          02:00:33       like ready to go. I want to be good looking and I was still hanging on to that. I didn't, I've maybe peaked at a six and I'll try. It's just getting uglier every day today. Jane. Yeah. Yeah. We look in the mirror. I think I'm tired. Yeah. And then I go, no, you're dying. Yeah, you are. Yeah, totally. Yeah. You know what's nice is that we have some like, so that we're able to do things like this, we have some help, like a nanny at the house. Yeah. And a lot of times she'll tell me how tired I look. Yeah. And um, it's something that's new that like sometimes it was a thought of mine where I look in the mirror and you think they look tired, but then you're like, don't beat yourself up. And then I'll see her and she's like, dumb. You look very tired today.

Speaker 7:          02:01:13       And I'm like, I feel okay. Yeah. I'm glad I look tired. And is it, you're always, you always look like that? Yeah, I did notice. I think I was looking like that. No one was telling me that, but now I get to hear it all the time. That's true. It's nice. I want to Ne, I want like a night nanny just for me. Like when you're typing or the couch, you gotta get to bed and Floss, pick you up. They floss your teeth and lay it out or your bum. That'd be awesome. How do your bum,

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       yes. Maybe we could start this other thing about like falling apart as we age is that because I, I was really even really fat at 1718 you realize that a lot of your friends that weren't, they get fat as they get in their forties and then you're like, oh, you look bad now you got fat. But because I was fat then. Oh, that's cool. I'm like, I either look better than I did or I maintained. Oh, that's nice. Yeah. It was a silver lining for us. So if you're like young and fat, you have that to look forward to. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry, I forgot what I was going to fucking, God damn it. I bet it was going to be good. Here's the thing, as long as you can stay skinny as you age, I feel like that's the key. You don't want to be fat and old. If you can maintain your weight.

Speaker 7:          02:02:26       Does it give away the, for me from my body, I have an unusual body but I can very thin, but my gut will just come straight out like a pregnant man. You ever thought about just like skipping food altogether? Yeah, there's a family. They just eat off the universe and light and you see that article last week, it's gotta be a lie. But they have kids and they say they just like stare at the sun and you take the universe of energy and they don't eat food. They're called. There's also a group of people called breadth Ariens where they breathe in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, that's pretty cool. I do that too. Are you a food guy though? I mean, is that your indulgence? No, I, I love food. But, uh, I mean they had a lot of chocolate too much, but, uh, but now I'm not a fool.

Speaker 7:          02:03:11       I, yeah. I'm like, Nah, I have tiny bones in guy, but like my BMI, BMI is bad. Like my, my hips are really smart bike, which goes from like hip, stomach ratios. Good. Yeah. I'm an illusion. There's something very, uh, lives, a lot of weird things about my body. Like, don't look right now, but like, I hurt my neck one time. This is actually a weird story, but I was having a dream. I was twisting off the top to a giant coke bottle, can like a seven foot thing and I'm twisting it and I woke up in agonizing pain with my hands wrapped around my head.

Speaker 5:          02:03:46       Yeah. Twisted my own head. So then I know that sounds almost unbelievable. Yeah. And never happened again. Just one time weird thing. And you're like, ah, my fucking neck. I woke up just staring at the ceiling and pain. Aren't those dreams the most unbelievable. When you, when you are, it's so vivid and you get up and you're like, oh, and you realize you're not there. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like I want those more. I don't have it then. They're good. They're good. Yeah. You know what I used to do when I had head gear as a kid, I would rip off the head gear in my slack. Throw it across the world. Yeah, you too. Yeah. Yeah. And I wake up in the morning, I'm like, oh my God, I am not wearing my head gear. And it was like in the closet. I'd thrown it across to hop out. And the kit your cheek, did your, did your head turning thing actually resulted in neck injury? Yeah, I had a neck brace on my Instagram. That picture you can see a neck brace. Yeah. And I had

Speaker 7:          02:04:37       it on for almost a year, but the reason I could have had it on the last, what I realized is I, the muscles go around the injury and they like tighten around it. And I didn't, I didn't, uh, I kept tweaking it, thinking it was still hurt, but it was to the muscles that needed to be stretched out. But I went to the doctor, I've got an extra eye and the doctor was looking at my extra way for a while and uh, then he calls it another dogs. Hey John, come in here. Cause another doctrine, another staring at Max. Right. You don't want your doctor to look at your ex. Right. Like he's never seen. So I was like, what am I dying? Like what's up? And he goes, you have the neck of a seven foot man. Why? Yeah, lot. That's what they told me. And that was, that had anything to do with the injury or there now?

Speaker 7:          02:05:21       Oh, just in general? Yeah. Like your neck. Like uh, let me see that. Oh yeah. I know. I don't think it was seven feet, but I think it looks like a graceful neck. It's very regal. But my, I'm five nine so I have the legs of a 12 year old girls. It's crazy that you did that to yourself and your sleep because don't they say you can't actually physically like punch yourself or harm yourself because the body won't, your brain won't allow, but I guess when you're, yeah, you can, you can do it too. And if you're asleep you could do some bad things, I'm sure. Cause you're, you don't have that awareness. Oh my God, that's terrifying. I feel like I've grown out of, I was always like doing like things were like a dream. I had some treme issues, not sleep walking, but like moving around.

Speaker 7:          02:06:07       A lot of really active sleeper just kind of went away. That's good. Yeah. But uh, yeah, I grew up in a, I'm just gonna start talking about myself. So, uh, my name's Kyle and Kyle. What's your middle name? Anthony. Oh, it's good to eat. Galliano um, I didn't mean to hijack this show. We're talking to do it. No, we want to know more about you. I was just like, thinking about myself and started talking about something we love your commeddia. Um, yeah. What do you want to know about me? Give you a question and only child, no. Last baby of how many? Three total. Three total. Yeah. And those two older brother cop. And a hardest job by the way. Not hardest may have, but I mean he just goes, you go where people are being assholes all day long, all day. It's called racist stuff.

Speaker 7:          02:07:01       He just tested, keep taking it and you go on with the turn on the TV and the TV kind of tells you you're a racist cop. He said to take it to take everything. Is He east coast guy? Good guy though. Yeah. Good guy. There's some good cops. I mean cops do. There's, you know what happens is we highlight the bad cops cause there's bad people in there. Their stories. Yeah. Well yeah. So you know the stories about the bad ones are so bad that that becomes kind of the narrative for cats. But there's obviously good cops. The cops, especially the older I get and I'm kids and stuff, mortgaged property and a lot of them come over, come over. They got a lot of pressure on them and it's just a bear. You have to have a really strong sense of yourself and patients because even you go back to the precinct, everyone's kind of being an asshole because they're bringing in, they're like, we're done ride alongs.

Speaker 7:          02:07:46       Yeah. I've done a few in different cities and it's always an entertaining and learning experience. I've done it in North Carolina. I went out with a cop, I went out with a black cop. We wanted to go different experiences, you know. Then I went out in Tacoma with a cop. We, you studying it for a role or are you doing this the first time I, I knew the guy from another job I had to because he worked part time at cops can have sometimes multiple jobs. Yeah. Which is kind of wild. At one time was a fan of this show and one time it was for a research thing for a role and that, but that was here in Hollywood. And what I found was that most in all three different areas, the um, the cops dealt the most with just mental illness all the time.

Speaker 7:          02:08:30       Yeah. Yeah. Just all day. I was like, how much of your like day is mental illness? And they're like, like 85% of these people were either drunk drugs or mental illnesses and then like they're like fucked up things like the drop off. So somebody who's just mentally ill at a hospital and then they're like, he's like, I'll pick them up tomorrow somewhere else. I'm dropping off at a different hospital. Oh Wow. And that, that's there. You see the Ron Coleman documentary on Netflix, the Ron Coleman. Ronnie Coleman. The bodybuilder? No. And Mr, I've heard from multiple people. Unbelievable. He had a fulltime cop. He's a cop fulltime and mystery at the same time. Which no, he was a cop as he was Mister Olympia. No one has ever had a full time job and been Mr Lindhout move and be like with that. You know what I mean?

Speaker 7:          02:09:18       Like how did he run after somebody with that just giant such a monster? Well now he's supposed to be in a wheelchair. The doctors are like, you should be in a wheelchair. His back is so screwed up, but he's so strong. He's like willing himself around on these like crutches and he still gets up at 4:30 AM every morning and goes to the gym. The doctors are like, don't do that. Go. And he just keeps going. It's pretty impressive. I'm like trying to be wild and a lot like that guy. So you have this pig brother and then your other sibling, she is a, uh, pig mum. She is, yeah. She said, mom, mom, she picked mom, but she's not a cop. Oh, thank God. Just too two kids. I always wonder because like you have this quirky, it's a very defined sense of humor. Right. And then it's the kind of thing where to me, like the way I would phrase it, all these things are subjective and the way, but I would still check, I would describe it like, people who I think are funny would find you funny.

Speaker 7:          02:10:19       They, you know what I mean? And are your siblings, are they like, he's fucking weird? Or do they, it was, I felt very alone and like what I thought was funny when I was younger. Yeah. My brother's cool. And, uh, he, he makes suggestions are always about like farting or something. Sure. So we like him already. Yeah. He's cool. Yeah. But your big sister, my big sister does not understand me. We love her. We love each other. Right. I mean I always, I was an odd child too, you know, they didn't test for things back then, but I would apply a kite for hours and just pee my pants and just keep flying. I was that kind of kid focused and once you were on something, yeah, I would get hyper. I think it's a burger types. Your videos. It's my videos. Your videos are hyper focused.

Speaker 7:          02:11:03       You'd get distracted for hours. Yeah. I didn't make that just to show people kind of do that. And I think it's uh, I don't know. It hurts me in some ways. Like I leave my car door or open the other day, just I'll just leave my car running. Stuff like that happens. If I'm thinking about something else, it's dangerous. I probably shouldn't have a kid talking about before. It's dangerous. That's interesting. Are Our boys, like Ellis has kinda hyperfocused where he can do an activity from the time he was, I don't know, 15 months old, like he'll just play with water in the sink for literally the first time. It was two and a half hours and I just let him, yeah. What about on the love cycle? Are you a Tinder? The love I just got on some apps. It's going terribly. Yeah. But you just started, oh, Don, will you please tell us what kind of picture are you leading with and what type of bio are you putting up there?

Speaker 7:          02:11:57       It's very important. I don't have that many pictures of myself. You putting up a good big picture of, yeah, I'm the first profile pic. I guess they'll click a nine, nine and a half. Okay. Oh Wow. Um, second one's probably a little less than that then. They're not great picks. I didn't think a lot about it, but they're fine. I look fine. But you're not doing jokey pictures go? No, just like straight up whatever. But I had a breakup, uh, in early September and it was, we were long distance for a couple of years. Then she moved in and five days later we broke up. Why, you know, how it is to move an entire person's life into your, wait a minute. How long were you together? Long Distance. Like two years. And we're talking like another coast? No, Las Vegas. Okay. That's not too far. And I thought there was a, there was a little bit of jealousy and going through my things breaking into my emails stuff.

Speaker 7:          02:12:50       Which is not accepted after you moved in? No, this is before I justified like, oh, once she moves in because everything else was great. She'll see, I don't know, do anything and she'll like, um, not be jealous or something. But when she moved in I realized, Oh this is just how it's going to always be if my whole life maybe worse and five days later, yeah, this was five days later and it hit me at Starbucks and Whitney Cummings walked in in that moment oddly that sees you like that. Actually, she has a picture of me with like my hands and my head, but she gave me good advice. Should go back to the house, break up and then leave. Don't get to negotiation is good advice because I went back as a really bad, but I was like, you know, you stay here and you know I'm going to go.

Speaker 7:          02:13:38       And, but then she didn't leave. Like I was homeless for like nine hours. She didn't leave the house. She didn't leave. And then she texted me, okay, I'm gone. You can cut back. I go back, it's dark now. Lights are off. Cars gone. She's not gone. She's in the house hiding in my, no, no. You know, like a murderer. What sounds good. John Molina is like a murderer. You chair. Um, so I, yeah, I went in my house and my dog came up to me who I talked to like an insane person and I was, this just came out of me. I go tough night to my dog, which she must've heard here. Oh God. Yeah. And I turned the corner. It's like a hey, but wait a week. So she's a nightmare. And then tough night to my dog and then I turned the corner.

Speaker 7:          02:14:32       I was like, oh look, I made a, another um, feminine sound and then she kinda got up and got our stuff and didn't like, she tried to like join it a whole hog for a little bit. Like how did you initially realize that someone's, that you feel the energy or you hurt? Oh, I will turn the corner and I was terrified. You saw her? Yes. And you're like, fuck yeah. I was like, Huh? Like that. Did you go, like you said you were gone? No, cause she immediately started like trying to pull me down. They just hold may kind of stuff. I wanted to maybe have, you see Kay, maybe makeup, but I think top night and he made her feel like not that attractive. So she left. But anyway, since went on bumble, went on hinge and a, I've had, I try to smash dog, but why don't you get on Tinder?

Speaker 7:          02:15:18       I, I'm actually want a relationship. Really? Yeah. I mean I'm all forced mansion. Maybe I should say that. That's cool. Yeah. I like just banging. Yeah, Bro. Why don't you do a, why don't you do a bang to get, cause you got to get the relationship out of your system. Get a fresh bang, then go into looking for the relief. You know what I mean? Bang. Bang. My way to love. Well, I'm saying just get a bang out of the way. Yeah. You got to bus the first post relationship. You got to clean those pipes out. Yeah. You got to meet some Tinder chicks. You know Tinder chicks are cool. I have come all over my face, so just go on Tinder. Yeah. All right. Sounds way. Cray cray though. Yeah, she was. I'm what's up with your picker as a Patti Stanger but she was great in every other aspect of stalking and that kind of being, yeah, by allying.

Speaker 7:          02:16:03       Sure. Just two bars. He's hiding in the home as that. That was it. Everything else funny that you should taste the regs. I mean she can do the sunny side up going through. You're going, man, I ask you this because I want an a day and I think this is inappropriate with this girl. Oh boy. I inappropriate like bad at this stuff. So I try to be a good guy and like I plan the date and I do this thing. So you know you're here. You're supposed to do, that's enough. Let's see what it says. Yo Joe Mother fucker. Yo. It's kind of inappropriate isn't it? Yeah. I thought it was just me. So I plan this data at a paint and sip, you know, that is paint and drink wine. That's kind of a cute idea. That correct the date one date two. Okay. And we have a little bit, uh, okay. So I go, uh, it's texts ends with like, great, see you there. See you then. Great. You know, and so the day of I write, Hey, do you wanna meet there at some, uh, six 45? And she writes, um, are we still going?

Speaker 7:          02:17:05       Yeah, that's a weird answer. Like, why would we, yeah, see. And I said, what do you mean? And she did, I haven't heard from you. So I assume we just weren't having a read for how long, exactly two days. We'd shored up the day and the day of, I was like, how about this time? That's it. Hmm. So anyway, then this whole thing blew up. We, we, uh, saw each other again. Wait a minute. Yeah. So the date was fine. Like what did you end up going? Yeah. And it was okay. It just was, that was a weird thing. She was just being really insecure. I, yeah, I think no filter. And she felt insulted that I, that you didn't call or the day before all saying there's rules and I did so many things right. I think I planned the thing, I bought that there's like a hundred bucks. I mean I'm a okay.

Speaker 4:          02:17:50       You gotta check in though. You got to confirm the date. 24 hours. I would confirm, but it was confirmed it two days prior, but then the day before be like, Hey, are we still good? Was the day or maybe the day of, okay, are we still good for tonight? Cause that's what he did. He come up. Oh. And then she, yeah, I kind of, I might, sorry, I misunderstood. So I think you're getting two days before he's like, hey, we'll meet up on a couple of days. That's fine. And then the day of, he's like, we're still good. Normally that's where the inbounds, yeah, I fought mixed suddenly there's like months ago and by, yeah, that's silly.

Speaker 7:          02:18:22       So we had as followup day. Is this an interesting story because you guys can just cut this out. I don't know. No, no, no, no. Um, all right. So then we had this, uh, this is, this is my first foray into dating. I love it after this. This is what happens. So, um,

Speaker 4:          02:18:42       yeah, I'm getting too distracted to crazy girls. I could tell you right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Your pickers

Speaker 7:          02:18:47       fucked up. Yeah. Well, this is the only person that I've matched with, so it's really bumbled pictures. Wait, so this is the same girl though? No, yes. That I like. Are we still meeting up? It's been a fucking eight minutes. We're still going. Okay. I probably should have said right there. Okay. Cancel this day. And then we had a good time. And so then you had a good time. Had a good time. Okay. And then that data ends. Yeah. And then we had plans and uh, I wasn't feeling great, so I, you know, told her I wasn't feeling great and uh, I was like, why don't I give you 1%, uh, uh, are you free Tuesday, which is the next day, you know, the next available we had, we had a Monday date, two could, how about Tuesday? Cause I wanted to make sure I was 100% or are you getting Sunday?

Speaker 7:          02:19:31       Where are you getting sick? Yes. Wasn't feeling Sundays when you went to paint and drink? No. When did you go? A week earlier. Okay. And then Sunday you hit her up like, yeah, we'd been texting and it was cool. And then, um, we decided Monday we'd, we'd see each other again. But when Sunday came around, I knew she was sensitive up day of stuff. So I said, let me tell her now just in case I'm not, I'm feeling worse tomorrow. I don't want to cancel on her that day. It'll ruin everything. I'll tell her today, hey, I'm not feeling 100% well how about Tuesday? Just so I have enough extra day. I thought that was okay. She wrote to that. To be honest, I'm kind of feeling unsure about you and the things you tell me anyways. I hope you find what you're looking for. Good luck on your bumble dates.

Speaker 7:          02:20:16       He's sign what's going. So she thought that you were okay, so I'm also not wrong and that she's, she's wildly insecure, which is at a certain, especially at a certain age, you just really shouldn't. You don't have time for it anymore. You don't have the energy for it. You know what mean to insecurity, but she's also, that's heightened by a bit of loca. She's kind of crazy. [inaudible] she thinks that he's lying to her. That's what I'm saying. She's so insecure. Like I don't get get she needs reassurance every day and she feels like you were alone or off by telling her, hey, tomorrow is not good. How about the next day? That's normal. Okay. See, I mean, this story isn't over, even though we all want it to be, it's not, she texted me the next day, Hey, I just re-read your texts from last night. I think I misinterpreted the whole thing.

Speaker 7:          02:21:08       She said this. I thought, I thought it sounded like something else until I reread it. I worked 36 hours and didn't sleep much. I just wanted to talk to, I'm sure I'm reading it wrong. Oh my God, I might be an idiot. And then she called me, I didn't pick up and then she said, please call off. You didn't already, uh, block my number. Um, and then today she texted, now I'm sick. Karmas real. This all sucks. Is it me? No, I, now I have to give her some credit. Okay. I give her credit. She went back. She may be reacted emotionally. She worked a lot. It sounded like. Yeah. She had the self awareness to read it and go like, oh, I fucked up. That's a sign of actual emotional intelligence. Yes. And, and also being a big enough person to admit it, which is kind of embarrassing.

Speaker 7:          02:21:55       So you know, if you, if you were to be like, man, I really, really liked her and be like, well then that's obviously an indication that maybe worth exploring again. But if you don't or if you're like, I don't have, you know, she's just not, it was also the last time, but the paint and sip, that text, I didn't text her early enough at drink the paint. She was a drink the pain. Yeah. She um, apologize for her texts there too. So this is a path that is a path to like just live on. You're going to deal with this a lot. Yeah. I'm not dating anymore.

Speaker 5:          02:22:26       Yeah. And can I tell what an awful thing? I think what's also happening too is that in text message, when you don't know somebody well, it's misinterpreted. So you may want to consider actually calling and talking to someone so that they can hear your voice. It seems so intimate when you call them baseline now it's like, hey, we, we misread each other's texts. Absolutely. Yeah. Really sometimes. No, we've read, we've read text. You've read text where you're like, you think I'm being serious about something, I have to call Matt mad or whatever. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the thing is that you don't have a connection established. So when you're trying to establish a connection, that's probably why she's, but for her to fly off the handle and then come back again, that is going to be her pattern, not, not for me. I know the kind of girl she's, she's weird swearing. They light very light. Laughy girls' night and not like too insecure. You need the smash first dog. This is what you need to do it. Do it. I forgot. All right, go on Tinder. Yeah. Wait, I'm too old to be on 70 no tender. Let me have worked with my man for a second.

Speaker 5:          02:23:45       So go on Tinder. Throw up a couple like good pics. Okay. Shirtless. No, no, no. Nothing to nothing ridiculous with joke. You just like good picks up. Okay. Bio Line can be charming. Funny, but not like we're not doing a bit here. Right? So you just like, whatever. You keep it loose this way. It's like you're not, don't put, I'm looking for a relationship. Just like whatever you like to do for, I like to drink, paint and I like to blah, blah, blah, but you put that in there and then let it ride. Man. Just see what kind of work with my friend is bro. You get out there around a little bit, chuck it around, clean the system. Now you forget about the bed stalker. You forget about drink the paint. You get a few nuts out and then we clean the system. Then we delete Tinder and we go on more of a serious match.

Speaker 5:          02:24:44       Last relationship thing, classes. You need to bust those nuts first. Get your swagger. Yeah, that's exactly what I lost it. I had to get it back. Why don't we get it back? All right, I'll go on Tinder. Here's a scenario though. No one. I get no matches. I mean I'm running bumble and hinge and I'm not matching with anybody. Let's look at your photos. I got it right here. I'm not a chef. She's great at the profile that I see the profile, my profile comedian and a known comedian like, here's the thing, girls always do like the funny guys. That's what they say. You should exploit your celebrity for this tender. Absolutely

Speaker 4:          02:25:24       exploit your celebrity. I'm serious. Just fix what's your bio line and then.dot. Like 400,000 followers on Instagram. Anyway. Make it like, oh, okay. Here's my profile profile pic. I first of all this first picture is douchey. That's fine, but it's like some slots or texting you talking about what is all for fuck's sake, man. Oh my God, Kyle. This is how your dates are going. This is how my life is, bro. You know Bro, that's why you're not matching. This is why it's too jokey. Let's see, and the girls, the girls who want to just get laid are like, this guy's too much of a client. I know. Take a photo. It looks like it's two. Jen's a little jokey. It's all great. I'm not saying you don't look good, you look amazing. It's just, it's too jokey. Joe and Rick, are there other pictures?

Speaker 4:          02:26:27       Let's do the follow up. I'm not even sure I do that. Okay, hold on. I'm opening. I'm looking forward pussy and I am trying to, all right, there's a real photo, but that's, you can't even see his face look like. That's another problem. Well, what's the last one? Let me see what Bro. I look back that. Oh my God. Deb. Chef. See you can't see. You can't see very cool tree. No. Okay, so you were your profile games wrong? Yes. It's good to know the first picture of, he's kind of too jokey. So the girl was like, Nah, he's not serious. And then you have a picture of a tree and then your face is dark and by shadows.

Speaker 4:          02:27:07       Let's just go three tree real. Let's use your three real pictures. Not a pro picture. I literally don't have, can we? But let me tell you, here's how you going to get legs. Here's how you're going to get laid. You're going to have one with you standing behind a microphone on the stage. Girl love comedian. Now how do you know the shit? No, let's turn this [inaudible] all this shit because I'm friends with your slip. Make sure he's got all wet when you talk, cause I talked to girls who are dating at the comedy store and normal girl holding a microphone. Oh my God. He's funny. I love funny guys. I'm saying like second, third picture, but not your lead. Your lead is just like a normal guy staring at I don't think. I don't think you lead with the mic. I didn't say he said the second or third is I love comedy with that one you should use if you do the mic. The mic one. Do you have a Pro Mike? That's professional. Oh this is what he prefers. I got this one just now. You guys that good smiling and I got a mic. Pretty good. Natural. Pretty good.

Speaker 5:          02:28:22       Yeah, I like it. Yeah, we need you. We're going to do a complete review. I don't like online dating. I think I'm just going to co a break. Yeah, but I will check. I'll take those pictures down now. I felt very self conscious or just switch them around. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have any head shots that are like, just aren't those headshot? It's worse. Smash, smash city, Bro. Dude, I don't put a picture of you with somebody else. Like, Hey, it's me and this other guy, because then people go, well, which guys that I know that's silly. Don't do you want to have a picture with some friends? They'll just get friends because then the girl goes, well I just want to, if you just have, if you crop arms out. So in other words, if it was friends with his friends and an Arrow off the thing, there's friends over their friends over there.

Speaker 5:          02:29:13       Okay. Now I will say the dog. Very appealing. Absolutely. Take care of something. You can take care of something that you are capable of love. Here's the thing though, we don't want to make your smash profile the same as your cause. There's the relationship profile. Get my Dick web profile should be different. Definitely different than I think my bros. Right on that, but smash profiles. Then the dumb chick's got, am I god, I love doggy here. That's what I'm saying, but it's good the dog. It's the honey honey. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We're going to help you with this. I'll keep you guys up to date. You really will want to know. I want to know. I want to know. I'll let you guys know when I smash. Dude, you got to smash. It's so gross, isn't it? I mean, I think it's beautiful. This'll be you in a week.

Speaker 5:          02:30:06       Pictures are going to profile pleasures. It's going to be hot, aren't you? When you're done, just like, oh, well what did we do after you smash? Yeah. It's weird thing, right? She would a stranger. Who are we now? What was that? I'm never done it, but that's why he needs, he needs that cleanse. I've gone to a party Saturday meal. Just smash out there. It did. Probably party is a good place to do it, man. Maybe you can get out of the way. Skipped the whole Tinder thing. I think he'd be a good wing man. For me. It'd be like, oh great. My broke Kyle, you mean my bro. Oh, I would bet right there. Now I'm looking good. I would come up with stories. That would be, I would be telling his Dick, he fucking, there's this IPO. You know what that is introduced me to like 25 million than you. Anyways. What do you guys, uh, are you guys going out to a diner afterwards or what kind of hungry? Suddenly they're like, wait, what's an IPO? I'll be like, ah, fuck you know what your game is by the way. Yeah. What is his game? This is a perfect game. Your game. When we were dating. Oh, contemptuous and difference. A little bit of silent indifference.

Speaker 5:          02:31:12       When I met Tom, he was 23 and he was just kind of quiet, but like a quiet, you know what I mean? Like, like not like a puppy dog, like excited to meet you, like kind of like whatever. I don't give a shit. Like, his whole vibe was like, I don't care whether or not any of this fucking happens in your life. Yeah. It takes the, it takes the ease. There's no desperation there. So you're like, oh, what's going on with, what's he all about? I bet he's excited. He's in the waterfalls to fed, but then you go to his house and you're like, oh, this guy's like no game. Because he sleeps on a mattress on the floor and he doesn't use soap. You could sell that. I was not yet a little bit of contempt. I do the whole thing. I still do.

Speaker 5:          02:31:56       I know I bought a Tesla so I'm going to have a serious car game. Really. I got Honda Civic. You bought it. You need a Tesla. I should maybe return it. Why was really expensive, but you bought it. Yeah, it's going to help. It's going to help the smash game for sure. Let's just do it. Chicks loved dogs and Nice cars get more dogs, more Teslas. My game is like, like yours except add the crippling insecurity. We all are insecure. That's the thing. That's the thing you realize as you get older, once you're in a secure relationship and everything, you see more how insecure you were and you realize that everybody is, and then that, that's what happens is like once you're not in the hunt, you're like, oh, why is everybody so fucking insecure? You know? But you need to be like locked down to dating.

Speaker 5:          02:32:51       So brutal. I mean put yourself out there every single time you meet somebody and then people who date without booze I'm impressed with does first couple of days during that first kiss without being drunk. Magic trick. I don't know how people do their first kiss. I've been talking, I talk about it on stage now. The level of tension for for an opening, that first kiss, I mean it is like, it's nauseating just to like weather. Like when you go like I got a coach, if you're, especially if you're the guy, he's the guy, you're supposed to be the initiator, you know, you can't do it. Like, like I had women who had said like, don't ask. That's the worst. That makes me crazy as, and it's growing like don't ask, but now you have to ask you, you don't ask. It's never asked you gotta you gotta you gotta be very clear though.

Speaker 5:          02:33:41       In this day and age you got to have a lot of cures. The thing you get the clues and then like look, the absolute worst thing. I mean, yeah. Someone being like, oh no, but like where you really that misled. You know what I mean? Like I don't feel like I was ever that misled terms of like, I never went for a kiss and had someone go like, what the fuck he had the, I've had it happen to me when I'm saying read cues and he went for it and I was like, I did throw him off. Yeah. But how often does that happen? I was drunk too. It's weird that that's why you must read this guy. Yeah. But

Speaker 7:          02:34:17       that's why you misread you were drunk. It was like if you're not drunk, let's say you're sober or you have a glass of wine, you're in a situation where that kids can happen mean there's like a woman is going to give you all kinds of body Hughes look. Yeah, I mean like you're kind of pick up on it. I know it's whether you have the confidence to go for it, but it's like, are you really this whole thing of like, can I kiss you? Aw Man. I see it in reality shows and I'm like, oh, how many first kisses have you had since we'd had ours? I think she was from our first one when we had our first kiss.

Speaker 7:          02:35:33       You have nice teeth, really good teas. Are Those yours? Are Those, wait, no, I do have good teeth. You profile. Realize braces. Oof. I do. Sometimes you do the home strips or do you go to like, there's like this thing you paint on. It's not like a paintbrush. What is it that come was put the cum all over your face. Wow. On the cheeks and then, and then I have this a retainer where like once a week and I'll just seriously, now let's put it in that. That's enough. This is from the dentist or you just buy this dentist? I would say, yeah. Yeah. Again, we do dental updates quite often and we have a lot of guests come in here. They show his teeth. Sometimes we have to be a little nicer to them. I would say those are top three teeth we've ever seen.

Speaker 7:          02:36:19       That straight man clean. Now you could tell me those are veneers as this really what's going on? Hey, I think we have a new profile pic. That's what I'm thinking. Yeah. Close up of the teeth. Yes. Actually don't you feel like when you see someone's teeth it really toe? Oh, it tells the whole story and it makes you attracted, you know, so much. I mean there's like someone especially who's young and has like already yellow in between. There's just, they're just going to bed with a s, you know, when I don't like, by the way, I know that we all have, you know, we're, there's different stages of life where different levels of income and what you can spend on it. I hate someone telling me like, like especially if they're employed, they have a decent job and it's like, ah, it just fuck this part. Like, no, you need to direct your funds into this region. If you have a job that gives you any resources, put down the plastic, rack up the debt and you take care of the mouth.

Speaker 5:          02:37:15       Yup. Don't let that shit slide. It's hard to go. You know, you go to the dentist, get teeth cleaned every six months. They say every three months. How often? Every six too. Who's got time for that? But they said the plaque and your gums deal and your life quicker to, absolutely. I mean these are basically bones in your face that other people see. Although I have a theory that it's not the, you don't take care of your teeth. It just if you build up plaque easily on your teeth, maybe you build up plaque easily in your arteries theory. I have but I haven't heard that and I don't know much so uh, that might be wrong. I got to get my teeth cleaned. Actually I'm going to make an appointment. I had an appointment and then those fires happened. Fires. Fuck. Are we kind of move Dennis to out here though?

Speaker 5:          02:37:59       Well then we have to go in and get the x rays and do the console. We're going to go back to the other one. I it depends. Do you want to go start with a new guy out here and then we got to go to this is the whole thing and shit. Fuck yeah. Cause right now we have more so much transfer the x rays, too many extras. No, that your thyroid cancer. This is linked to that. Dr. Ross just said that you have to wear a thyroid guard, will send us all kinds of clips. I don't know if you know this or not. I do. You always watch things that people send. Somebody sent this. Let me see what it says about her. This lady. Okay, so the light was red. She was reading a piece of paper. The light turned green. She continued to read, so I pressed the horn quickly. Then she continue reading, so I pressed it longer until the light changed to red again. She got out of her car and argue with me that she was reading the paper because she felt dizzy and wanted to know if she could turn around to go back to cvs. I tried backing up to around her and then she walked into the other lane and then I started recording. So this guy had dinner with a woman. Just being real.

You know, honestly what I was thinking for real before you said that, I swear to you, when I was thinking like I was trying to figure out the number, the first number hand to God on our children in my mind was $5 million. What I was thinking, it's the lowest. That's what I was like. If someone say, here's 4 million can say running through in my head and was like, okay, and I was like, should I say five? Oh, stop. Be Realistic now let's think about, I was being real. Let's bring it down. Rockefeller talking about coming in this lady after sweet kisses and eating her box. Yeah, you did.

Maybe you would do it for 20 grand and if you can't finish, you don't. You don't get anything like you've gone through the whole thing and that's pressure on you that you may not be able to. Okay, so let's go. Let's work in reverse. You had made a good point. You said someone said 4 million. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, absolutely. 3 million. Let's be real. I'm like, you lie, you million dollar. Let me work. You ruined this line. Million. You're ruining this. We're ruining this. You're ruining this. Why are you ruining this? Ruining what? I'm working through it and you're like jumping your care fears. I don't leave. Christina knows how serious it doesn't understand. It's too preposterous. 4 million.

Speaker 5:          02:44:52       Tom's taking this really seriously and I'm trying to figure this out and you're real. You're like 20 grand. Like I would even spit on her for 20 minutes. I would spit on her for 20 grand. I wouldn't, I'd be like, it's not enough money. Okay. It might, it might throw up on her for 20 grand. If I had vomit, like backed up, I might puke on it for 20 minutes. Max Funding that you puking on this woman. I'm saying 1 million. Think about cash tax free. I give you a suitcase of $1 million, you're not going to do this for one. I don't think it's enough. Really. I don't think it's enough. I really don't. I don't think you that's impressive. I'm way below that. Yeah. I think, I think, I think on, if I'm being honest, I would say like two, two and a half would be like the bottom wow.

Speaker 5:          02:45:41       To do it. You definitely have more money than I do. Kyle, what's your bottom? I'm like in the teens. Come on to you got to eat or box for a while. Got a banger and you got to look in her eyes as you finish. I'm definitely under a hundred grand. I'll tell you that right out of the box. Um, you have to, you have to eat her ass for a while. Way Her ass. Yeah. You added that. No, that's always there. I played. He's right. It is always there. Well, we didn't say that with you. I just threw it in there. I had through it. How am I, what kind of ass is it licking you? Getting in there deep. Is it how long? Yeah. Liggett, one rim, and I'm back to, uh, her lady parts. Poke it a little bit with your tongue. All right. A couple of pokes, rim and then, okay, well let me ask you though. You got to jump into, you need to have, you got a 69 being realistic here. Oh, are you serious? And she's wearing that

Speaker 18:         02:46:52       outfit.

Speaker 5:          02:46:54       That's awesome. I love that. That's a real factor. She keeps telling you about this FedEx guy that annoyed her the whole time. Okay, sorry. So I have to 69 and if you have to succeed her butthole, I will not, I will not going to lick her butthole. How about we go to your $1 million cash bag? You're like, nope, it's $1 million in cash. Here's saying I would do it for a million. Yeah. Cash tax free. The IRS never say no to 900,000

Speaker 5:          02:47:27       cash. It has to be a million in my mind for it to be worthwhile. I have to have that amount. So now I don't seem so preposterous to, you have a one millions less preposterous and five to two and a half. Christina, you don't get any of the money. It's harder for a woman. So work. Hey, that's way harder for me. I Dunno. I mean, do I have to come or does she have to? Everybody is at a party. She has to come. Whoa, Whoa, whoa. You said I had to come and look at it. We don't know her biology. She may not be able to. Okay. Let's say, let's say she can, no, not different game. Different story. We have to make her sick. There's no way I'd spend the time. You have money. That's been the time. They know. Wait a minute. Does that change your fee though?

Speaker 5:          02:48:15       So what's your fee now? $400,000 and you'll make her come. I will make that woman and have the greatest night of her life. I believed you. And that's your Tinder game. You need to go into your status came up. I want you to think about her. Every time you're on, you're going to do it. I'm not doing Tinder is too for the kids. Do it, man. I'm 47 so what? 47 on Tinder, bro. We're just trying to clear the pipes little bit. That's true. See, Christina is what says is embarrassing. I mean grow up. You have to give her an orgasm and you have to do by any means necessary mouth if to use your mouth, your hands, your painter. I think six is fine. Six Mil. Yeah. I know you guys have a good life. Do you know that? Like do you, do you recognize

Speaker 7:          02:49:08       that like we have a really good life because most people get used to their life and they go, oh my life. It's fine. Are you like that or do you know that you just come down here and talk about this and I need, we appreciate it greatly. Cool. We get to do this. I got paid $6 million to make. This lady can realize how good my life is. Pretty sweet. 6 million. See what I mean by the way? I framed it like that to me and you show me the bags and then you're like, it's, she's right through there. I would go in there with these, this attitude of like, daddy going to make you calm. So like do whatever you want. You want to Fart in my face and get started. I would just absolutely mental state a really like, I think I would leave there and she'd be like, it needs to get a bonus because I came like 16 times.

Speaker 7:          02:49:59       Oh you know, I think I would go in there like let's up the ante. There's bonus checks you do a whole night with her and you got to do it as many times as she, as many times as she wants. And you have to do whatever she wants. She's not in good shape. She would. She wouldn't, she wouldn't be like more and more and more and more. You've got to nut three times in 12 hours, 12 hours, 12 hours. I think it's doable. I don't think I can do it. I think you can eat a diet nuts and then you'll get any money cause you could, couldn't do your third nut. Oh, key is you want, you want those first two as fast as you can. I, you can [inaudible] period's going to really dwell after that second one and then when it's like, hey man, we got two hours left.

Speaker 7:          02:50:42       You'd be like, hey, why don't you fucking smack them around a little bit to get going here, but can you brought up a great point is that you're going to have her like butt juices and all her juices like, oh, you're just smell to be. I was just thinking about those millions though. I can't believe you thought I was going to do this for $20,000. I'm serious. I might do it for 20 grand. Really? I'm going to get 20 grand tax free. Make a woman feel good for a little while. It's beautiful thing. She's a good night. Good night. It's tax free. Can we regroup? Will you tell me for real what you would need to eat her box? I'm being be real. Look at her. No, she's disgusting. I would say this is what the Moose suit lady looks like. Muscle building. We actually saw her.

Speaker 7:          02:51:34       It looks much better. She does. Most of it looks better. I'm serious. I'm serious. She does. Seriously is my nightmare. If I were to go gay, this is not my voice. Like that's who I am. So you imagine? Yeah, and I'm being honest and sincere. When I say $1 million cash and nobody finds out about it. That's another thing. You can't be on the Internet and you'd have to make her come. Yeah. And I'm being serious. So you'd want a lot of effort into it, right? For a million cash. Cash. Like if you came out of there, she didn't come. You'd be like, I really tried.

Speaker 10:         02:52:11       Yeah. Was $1 million a ton.

Speaker 7:          02:52:13       Mike. Let's say you just walked out right now and she didn't come. Would you be like, I'd be so bomb. Do Cause I want that money. But you'd be like, I really ate as much as I got fucked up. I would make it happen. Yeah. I'm going to flip the script on you, Tom. She straps on a Dildo. Okay. You've got to take it. Okay. For five minutes as she is yelling at you as you makes you wear a FedEx outfit. Yeah. Easy. Five minutes. Oh, okay. Now we can start talking to that bullshit money. Okay. What is it, 50 grand and bulldozed by her? Yeah. Yeah. The strap on. Yeah. No, but I might do it for like six figures or something because I feel like there's no, like that I'm facing a wall, you know, I'm looking away and the things being done to me.

Speaker 7:          02:52:59       See, I find that much more violating. Oh No. See that. I could check out of that and look, I could check out. Yeah, I agree with Tom. You can check out, you'd go, I would check out and she'd be like, I fucking ups is better. And I'd be like, Eh, all right. And then she just rails me and I would just kind like, just be like, that's fine. I've never had that done to me. So it also is a scary, but peg is one. I neither have. I neither is he right? Tom [inaudible]. He seems pretty cavalier about it. I just feel like, yeah, I just feel like, uh, that, that one's not, I feel like doing things to her would require much more out of me. Okay. Yeah, I think it was. I'm glad we figured out. Yeah, that's her. That's her. That's the elk. That's who you're dealing with. Dirty bic. Aoun. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 10:         02:53:50       Oh, dirty son of a

Speaker 7:          02:53:52       Kyle. Have you ever smoked meth? No. Yeah. What is your drug history like? I was pretty much a square and then I've recently done a lot of marijuana at night to sleep. That's nice. Do jellies. And uh, I used to take those a diazo Pam's or whatever that, those uh, or Lunesta and I'd find the marijuana is not as, I don't get as hung over and it seems like it doesn't affect me in a negative way. I hope. It seems like it's okay though. Cool. What do you guys do? Wine Party? No, little bit of Mary Jane. Sometimes I want to try mushrooms. Never done it. I haven't either. I want to try that. Should do it. What if you were to, by the way, since you know how he's singing and we're trying to hook him up. Hmm. What if he went into like a new facet, like a new genre, a new, a new lane instead of like traditional. Okay. What if you step out of the box a little bit, you know in terms of in what way? Well, what if you did something like that? You forgive him for that

Speaker 23:         02:54:50       thinking. This is a meal with the red point, but the cost is actually contained blood. Leah, now I want your average couple. They're actually real life vampires living in the sleepy town of Haven hills suffered the taste of the blood on the person.

Speaker 5:          02:55:05       Maybe that's your lady. All right. Right. How much do you make her come for? Fuck. Is this our new game? I would have an easier time with her because she's got a real look that I could get into. Can I tell you something right away that I feel like already what she would like. Even if you weren't attracted or like she knows what's up, she knows how to do things. She could hurt you though. She could hurt you, but she'd also be like, I know what feels good. She's worked her way around a nut sack for sure. That's what I'm saying guys. You're frying to golf checks, which I'm an expert in. Yeah. There's two kinds of God chicks. You got your skinny goth chick. Yeah. And then your heavier goth chick who wears like a lot of latex and very not porous materials around their blue jeans. Uh, I get, I know what you're gonna do. You know what I'm saying? So it's not the best. That's what I've heard. So I would take that into consideration cause she's, she's wearing leather and stuff in that area.

Speaker 7:          02:55:58       It was love at first bite all the time. Vampire Arrow, often Mitera dating website on Valentine's Day when I first saw that he was a vampire is very interesting. I was like, okay, didn't know that was actually a proper real vampires out though. You always hope there was.

Speaker 5:          02:56:15       I hope to have children. She, he looks terrifying. Yeah. I mean she's like, you know, it looks like kind of like almost looks I'm going to hate hosting parties. No, but I'm saying, I feel like I see that she tried to put this together with him. I see like a genuine scary fucking guy, right? Like this is how he naturally look like there's no effort, vampires, murder people. So he's gotta be at least entertaining those thoughts in his head. Yeah. Even as a fantasy, that's

Speaker 7:          02:56:49       a part of the lifestyle. The blood always had cravings for pledge since the first day. I can remember anytime someone cut their self, if they cut their finger, I'd put their finger in my mouth. If they're all odd, clap my mouth over it. Right. He's

Speaker 5:          02:57:06       Gary. Oh yeah. The teeth aren't good to any black lipstick highlights yellow teeth. This is what your boyfriend's looked like back then. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, not like him, but like the saying, the black lipstick eyeliner. Pretty much. Same as the old dude, that big book. Duplo but we didn't drink blood were lunatics, uh, when she has her period. Right. All right. Ask. Keep it going. And most shockingly level, they drink each other's blood. Hello.

Speaker 7:          02:57:37       Are All my saw come wild covered? No, the laptop. Couple of set to get married on the spookiest there for year Halloween coding. Uh, God, it's eerie. So unsure of how her family was, take the news of her unusual lifestyle. She hasn't yet told them it's actually happy with the relationship. They don't look healthy. Yeah. A great way to get. Yeah, it happened. You know, I was convinced I had aids in 1990, like not even, I think I might have. It was like I knew I had aids, how I had never had sex with a girl before and I came home from this party, it was a college and she's like, Kyle done, I get to get up here. She's drunk. And we had sex really fast and she was 21 which seemed sold to me. And if she had sex with me, like she's probably, as you know, very, uh, so this is 1990 [inaudible] you had unprotected sex, you got a, that was like what they were saying.

Speaker 7:          02:58:36       Right. So I was couldn't, Vince and I left there and I was, I was really upset and I ran into my roommate at the time who was like this jock guy and I, and I, I embarrassed myself. I was like crying and I was like, yeah, I was crying. I was like that. Like we get like one word out, like just got aids and then, um, anyway, but it actually helped out because later on I never got tested because you couldn't get tested on campus. And then I was going to this Billy Joel concert, right. This all gets back to AIDS. Okay. And, um, in the back and I'm so far away at Yankee stadium, you're, he's playing piano, man. You're, you're hearing uptown girl this sound. So we sneak down, I get to the front row and I'm going to jump on stage. You know what?

Speaker 7:          02:59:24       You know, it was a huge Billy Joel Fan. Like I'm gonna die anyways. I got aids. That's what I thought. Really? I wasn't going to do it. I chicken doubt. And then I remembered, oh, I have a, I'm gonna own Dynamic and the power of aids propels you, jumped on stage and they filmed it that night. And, uh, I have the film of me jumping on stage. Are you being serious? Yeah, it's on my Instagram. And then I can pull up your Instagram. Yeah. It's like one of the first videos I posted and then, um, yeah, and then years later, 25 years later, almost to the day I, I was on stage with Billy Joel randomly. Uh, like how you're casually like yeah, I was going say we'll, Amy Schumer had his songs in her movie and she basically up, cause she knew I liked Billy Joel and she just put them in now you know, for the other character is way down here.

Speaker 7:          03:00:10       It's like one of the first guys I posted. Okay. So Amy Hill, so she was invited on stage. Is it cause uh, to like dance during uptown girl. And so she invited me. So I went and met him during rehearsal and it was so eerie because it was the same like outdoor stadium. He was in the same spot. I was in the same spot and like I went up the same way. It just was very eerie. Cool. How long ago, by the way, is your neck twisting injury? Was that from uh, think I was like 24. Okay. So we're running the limo driver at all these photos. Look at all these photos, trying to figure out how to do Instagram at that point. That's a character though. Lost cause did you tell Billy Joel your aid story? I did. I didn't say aids, but told him the story. I'd be jumping on stage. I showed him the video and I have the video one is really cool. He was cool. But I mean I, you know Jennifer Lawrence was there too and he's probably, if I, if they weren't there, he would have been like at the get away from me, get away from me dude. The fuck are you? He's like, oh there it is. It is where they would go up. Oh that's no, sorry. Go down

Speaker 5:          03:01:17       to the right is like the rehearsal for the one. Yeah. Yeah. That'd be showing them, yes. You showing him the video video of me jumping on stage with AIDS. Let's see how I want to see how much disdain he has for you in this. He doesn't like me. Let's see, let's see if he,

Speaker 13:         03:01:30       cause I,
