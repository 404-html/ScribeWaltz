Speaker 2:          00:00:19       Um, all right gene. I think, uh, we're ready to start the show. And you put your jeans on. I got my jeans up. I got, how are they tight? They're pretty tight. They're pretty high. Teens are so tight. Yeah. I put on a pair yesterday and I was like, oh, I don't know if I can do this today. I'm not there. This is going to be a flat maximum, maximum gene edge. Let's do it. Ready? Let's do it

Speaker 3:          00:00:47       before you have sex. If you want to be horny for two or three hours, like you never been in your life and you have access to marijuana too good. We'd listen to me.

Speaker 2:          00:01:05       Uh, that go through.

Speaker 4:          00:01:08       Fuck yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:01:10       All right. Take two.

Speaker 1:          00:01:16       Oh was Randy will go to your mom's house, Christina?

Speaker 2:          00:02:09       Yeah. That's good. I make beef type and he goes like, beef writes like that. Let me see what this is. Where it gets you a lie. Yes. Tamar Braxton. So this guy, what do you think he's giving you? Sex Advice. I don't understand what the advice is. So he said, if you really want to have super horny, like a good horny time, he's telling you, you got to get really good weed. He's telling you this as he's a inhaling, laughing gas through a balloon, but now he's going to tell you the next thing to really up your horniness ready. Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:02:39       true. We'd along can get your really hornier than normal, but it's been on drawl. Take about 10 12 bedroom girl before you to have your sexual fun with your partner or whatever you do or masturbate. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:02:52       Well isn't that way too many? So many. I think my heart would stop. Wait, does that make your heart? I think also if you wanted to tell anyone, hey, you know, any medication is over the counter, take 10 or 12 of them and then go have sex. Like they're all going to be like, yeah, that was really more intense. I remember as a kid, my mother would give me Dimetapp you want to fuck good. Take, take a 10 or 12 shots of Afrin and your nose and then smoke weed. All right. Crazy. Yeah. It felt crazy. They're pseudoephedrine isn't there in uh, in that, I don't know. Anyway, I used to take Dimetapp as a kid. It's outlawed now. It's gone. It is, yeah, because it was loaded with like crank and I remember it just makes your heart pound but also had a downer so at the same time so that you could fall asleep. So I'd be like, but you can breathe real easy. I don't know, man. This guy, he's got to figure it out. If you ask me,

Speaker 3:          00:03:51       I'm about an hour later when he fill it, just kicking and smoke your weed done and then go ahead and get horny and I promise you it will be millions of times. You'll be so blissfully horny that you will not want to come. Trust me, it's gonna be restlessness. If you take it really late at night and you're, and you wanted to just go to bed, I don't do that will make you have wrestle slaves and rubbish. You'll wake up and you'll, you'll, it's not very pleasing what's going on with laughing gas when he's out of his sight.

Speaker 2:          00:04:30       Is he filming in his closet too? But his pupils are super dilate and he's like, he's giving you, I like that he sold himself. You know, this is how you do that. The system, you can tell he's really honed it over the years. He's like, I used to do two, three Benadryl and then four or five, 10 or 12 minutes ago, God even come in the foil. You got it. You know, 10 or 12 and then smoke your weed and trust me there, you're going to be horny. You're going to be all cranked up and then you're going to want to bring it down.

Speaker 3:          00:05:06       Yeah. That's craziness, dude. It's a lot better than an orgasm. I've been up for like 48 hours straight before. I'm an underling weed. I'm a computer watching girl. Women wrestling. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:05:26       Sounds good. Yeah. Sounds like a good time. Women's wrestling. Well, and it's better than having the orgasm cause he's saying you're not going to come now he's saying you're not going to want to because you're so blissfully horny. So you're so, so enjoying the way you feel that you won't want to end it. Oh, I see. You know, you'll just want it to like keep riding that wave and riding the snake. Yeah, man. I'll kind of lives to, people have, Huh? I don't know man. It's a lot of free time. It's a lot guess guys really worked out. How do you feel by the way your, your special has been well received. It was pretty exciting. Overwhelming. It's overwhelming to have this much approval. Like I legit, I'm not used to people liking anything. You know what I mean? You just, you slave away in obscurity for 14 years and then and you're just like, it's fine.

Speaker 2:          00:06:14       I can say what I want. No one cares. And then one day or like, oh, people care. It's great. It's amazing. It's a special amaze. Thank you. Well, without, without you, my jeans would never be so tight or high and I, yeah, because you're my love hearing my support system. You're my family or everything without you. There is no gene. There's two mommies and one jeans. That's how it goes. Again, if you haven't seen it, it's called a shoes with them and it's on Netflix right now. I actually had the song in my head over the weekend. A lot of no lie a lot. It's not a bad song. I feel like it's not that bad. I mean, he can take some work. It needs work, but it's not bad. It's pretty amazing. Yeah, like I feel like if the right band took it and actually reworked it, it would be very good.

Speaker 2:          00:07:04       We'd have a number of submissions of people that have reworked it, so I'm like, God, it's pretty exciting. We also have this email. Listen to the latest episode. It was my way to work. You guys suck. I'm walking around my office and machines within machines within is stuck in my head. I'm trying to focus at my computer and machines within machines with. It was like that juggle who tapped into something inside of me. Megan stuff. I agree. All right, Chris. I was laying in bed last night and you were supposed to be giving me head scratchies, which were inferior because I woke up and my hair was not tangled and the whole night I was going machines with machines with this whole fantasy about I had this, I don't know, I do a lot of like, you know Dimetapp Benadryl. I do a lot of thinking. I take like 10 or 12 Benadryl.

Speaker 2:          00:07:56       No, but like you know like I'll come up with jokes and stuff in the shower. I always thinking the show this weekend, him and I was on the road and I was doing shows and then I was like machines with the shower and I was like, we should fly that guy out. Bringing him to like a friend's studio and like have a, a real producer friend of mine lay a beat and like film it. And then one of my good friends who you know is a music video director and a video that was kind of be the most amazing thing that ever happened to this man. I think we should work on, you know, let's find him. Does anyone know who he is? Let's find him. Do you have any contact yet? Does anyone have contact for machines within guy? Because I think that could be, I think we need to make this happen. We need to fly to La and we need to treat him like a star and get his Korean do machines within, you know? Yeah. I think we could really do something special with that. But in the meantime, um, some of our, you know, we are not a lot of podcasts will claim, you know, they're

Speaker 5:          00:08:56       this and that. There are no, there's no podcast in the world. It has a better, uh, a library and a better, uh, musically inclined base than we do. We have some of the songs, you know, the songs that have come out of this show. Some of them are incredible. Like there's really talented people making music. Anyways, I actually was dreaming about this too this weekend. I, I, first of all thank you to everybody and Arbor Indie and Northfield, Ohio, Cleveland, unreal shows, sold out shows really fun. We just had the best time, Josh Tyler and I. Yeah. And like, we had great, great shows, man. They were just great energy. Never knew Ann Arbor was going to be like that. Did you meet anybody after the shower is like, did you take any photos of people or is that just something a personality Cham does? Uh, yeah, I took photos with people.

Speaker 5:          00:09:52       What do you mean was I nights I've been getting reports when I'm in, I was in Saint Louis teds and, and in the south. And people are like, Tom's not a personality champion. Doesn't really meet people. What are you talking about right now? Yeah. You don't think I took photos with people. Why would you even say something like on the streets? You're not friendly or not a personality champion like I am what? But everybody was like, you're so much nicer than Tom. At least can get with your fucking twinsie here. These are like three versions of the same person as the Cleveland Indians, baseball players right here. Oh my gosh. Yeah. Play the game all at the same, came to, came to the show. KIPP Zimmer right here. We, um, hung out after the show. Super Nice guys. Cool.

Speaker 6:          00:10:33       MMM,

Speaker 5:          00:10:35       yeah, I took a, if you go to my Instagram, okay, you're on the gram. I'm on the gram to the gram and you do the, uh, you go there, you can, you can see all the pictures I take with people they're posting, but I have so many more machines. Machines. All right. So it's not a bad song. I got slight distraction, but

Speaker 6:          00:11:07       MMM.

Speaker 5:          00:11:09       So here's just a few, but you can just let me know. Let's see. This is a machine. This is machines within featuring Charro by DJ socks on to track. Okay. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:12:10       Yeah. Yeah. Cause here's the thing, when I hear, I hear you say that he used to go that way, but so this was just someone's take on, this is kind of an, it's a chiller chiller, but also kind of scary or vibe because it had like an Airy, like horror movie quality to it. I thought, yeah, no,

Speaker 7:          00:12:29       Charlotte

Speaker 2:          00:12:30       going, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:12:53       this could have been in this decaria movie, you know? Right, right. Come on up on the house.

Speaker 2:          00:13:27       really good. I mean it's so good. I should have done this to mind people, but like this is what their work.

Speaker 7:          00:13:50       Machines wear thin machine. They've got a gun and got again. There's all that going on. Terminating her gun. Yeah. Yeah. Machines. But then the change was then trying to wreck my rep, trying to make my rep talk to someone with the flow, trying to practice on my floor. Sharing with them machines was cheese. That's it. Hearing my on the street. I don't care if I f f the hitters Fr the haters. Waze say fuck though. It's good. It's good. Just needed a producer dude. Change was then, but she then good shit socks.

Speaker 2:          00:14:43       I applaud you. I mean I can't believe he, that's amazing. It's amazing what people can do. So this is machines within coming up here by

Speaker 5:          00:14:52       Equis. Yeah. Okay. So this is another version of machines within yeah, a different take and um, yeah, just, yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:15:01       Mastodon. It's also kind of chiller vibe, right? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:15:12       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:15:12       Yeah. I'm going to change. Oh geeze. 16 yeah. Machines with shoes, with our students with churn rate my rate, which would make hour chunk, chunk. Here we go.

Speaker 5:          00:16:19       again. What's t 16? I don't know. I don't know what he's doing. Like guns. I don't know what he's doing. Uh Oh, I just remembered, by the way, that's true because I had mentioned where it was weekend I went to this place in Ann Arbor called Frieda's. Bodas Cubans. Not True. Yeah, he does. Does, yeah. I swear to you. A toddler restaurant? No. What do they serve? Their Brito Bandido um, I think it ain't all bad needle. What's it called? Uh, that's Beavis is restaurant. What's it called? Freedom by Tito. Sorry? I said, yeah, I went here. Frieda, but Tito's Cuban inspired street food. Oh Man. Diarrhea to I, it was so good, man. Well, I looks, look fried egg on top. Whatever your freedom. Anyways, uh, one of the guys working there listens to our podcast. Palm gas. Yeah, this is our podcast, so you're kidding. He, um, you know, I ordered the Burger and the egg and everything, but you know, I was trying, I didn't eat, I was like, I'm not gonna eat the Bun, you know, that kind of shit. Right. Like when you're like, you're doing your primal shit. Yeah. Just trying to split fucker. Anyways, so they, you know, I didn't know that he, he didn't say anything at first. So I order and then I had a little side salad and then a server comes out. It was Tom and I go, yeah. And he goes, here's your, um, uh, Judas, you're fried us, like with sugar and sauce to dip

Speaker 2:          00:17:49       it in. I go, uh, I didn't, I definitely didn't order that man. And then the guy goes to the palm guys, I thought you would like to try it. And then I was like, oh, that's very nice to you. And then Josh Potter, who's with me, I was like, you know, I didn't order this, but I'm not turning this down. I just dove in. It was one of the best fucking things I've ever hot. Little Chucho Bites, Hubbard and sugar and then a chocolate, a hot chocolate dipping sauce. I was, I had cramps for 36 hours after we ate it and we had bites. We had, we both had cramps. I was like, I gotta feel good. Later. He goes, well you ate just spoonfuls of sugar. Like it wasn't like sweet. It's like covered. Yeah. It's one of the best fucking thing. You're saying it wrong. It's just true.

Speaker 2:          00:18:42       Right, right. It's how you eat a Chiro dude. It's just a Mexican pastry. But their Spanish, sorry, this was the Cuban joint. But yeah, in Spain, right. I don't think there Spain, Spanish from Spain. I watched the great British baking show and they look it up to those are from Spain again. Maybe you're right, cause they go this week we're doing Spanish. She rose. Of course they can't say shit right on on that show. Spanish churros and they did the same thing where they all had to do variations on the Chiro shoe role. Let's see, a Trudeau or traditional, you're right, you're totally right. For once in my life. I'm right on the fucking show. Fried though. Fried dough. It's fried dough and it comes out hot. Don't forget that there is based, you know what it is? It's basically a version of a donut. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:19:35       But they're covered in sugar and then the new shit is they give you a sauce to dip it in the restaurant. It's like how we added Bacon to Brussels sprouts. This generation, everyone's dip in that shit and Charlotte, can I tell you the best place to get a tro to get your life all verus street in Los Angeles, but on all Vera Street, one of those vendors. I mean that's what's up. They're all over Latin America now. Anytime there's fried dough that it's the best. Now in Hungary, their version of the Chiro is called [inaudible] and it's only in the summertime. You can get it and it's deep fried dough, but then they put butter, garlic, sour cream and sprinkle some cheese on that bitch. Get your, it is so good. It looks like they said there's, they don't know the origin of the story, but they think that maybe the Portuguese brought it to Europe from China, China, so that the Chinese maybe have, well they do because they have before. I'll tell you I know this. When I did it, the Chinese guy, Chinese breakfast, they do a fried donut with like a soy milk, warm, warm milk. Another theory, your donut.

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       The Trudeau was made by Spanish shepherds to substitute for fresh bakery goods. Judo pace was easy to make. And then of course, I guess they brought it all to Latin America because now you find it. It says you find it in Peru, Venezuela, Colombia, Guatemala. So now it's everywhere. Look at us and our knowledge and our knowledge. Okay. Back to machines. Within machines with machines with, so this is must jeans.

Speaker 2:          00:21:15       Yes. Most genes within, listen name,

Speaker 5:          00:21:18       Benny Harper was listening again. If, uh, if you need a reminder of what we're, what we're going off of here, it's just just

Speaker 2:          00:21:25       their shoes with them. Machines with 10. That's it.

Speaker 5:          00:21:28       That's all these guys had to work with. Maze. Here we go. I must genes within chair.

Speaker 7:          00:21:44       We're on the right track. I actually, I don't think it's bad. Cut Him off. Wow. Crazy. Walking down the streets, walking down the streets, walking down the streets. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:22:59       Pretty good man. You know that we have your mom's house. We have fans that are actual real like famous musicians that listen to this. Yeah. We have a few. I would, I challenge those guys if anyone's got some fruit. I would love to see someone do machines,

Speaker 5:          00:23:16       machines within. Man, that was really good.

Speaker 2:          00:23:20       Yeah. I feel like Metallica and if they could cover it would be, you know what I mean? Oh yeah. I mean they could go, I feel like they could come out with a completely an ironic, that's what, that's the thing. Here's, and their fan base would be like, what's Jane's? Yes. Because me the phrase machines within his fucking really dope actually like, oh, that's kind of deep and like, what is, Oh yeah, I do something with a man. You, the societal structures, whatever the fuck that means. Sure. A lot going on.

Speaker 5:          00:23:54       Last, uh, last week you also were a scenes with Joe Rogan's podcast was

Speaker 2:          00:24:02       what does Mommy's mean? It was, it was awesome. It's the first time I ever did the show without you. So it felt a little bit like, you know, on Seinfeld when Elaine would hang out with George without Jerry. So at the beginning I was like, how, how's this? What I mean? I've obviously everybody call you guys jeans. We had a great time. Uh, Joe is such an easy person to hang out with and he's one of the most wonderful, sweetest, which one's the genes, funniest humans. And we had such a great time. We had a really good time. We talked so much shit.

Speaker 5:          00:24:39       Isn't that crazy by the way? That literally, I don't know if people totally understand this, but doing his podcast to promote your special is more effective and bigger than doing like a late night.

Speaker 2:          00:24:54       I know it's so many more people listen to it. It is bananas because I'm, you know, Netflix is having me possibly do those circuits too. And it's like, okay. But the truth of it is, the glamour is though. That's the one people go, wow, you made it under that. But the ears and the focus is in the podcast, podcast world. I've been getting so many tweets from people that Joe Rogan referred me to the special and, and now it's like I'm very appreciative to Joe for having me on as usual. Very appreciative. Mommies put your jeans up high and tight. He's the sweetness.

Speaker 5:          00:25:35       Um, so we had the guide obviously tell us to take our bandage rolls and how many have a 12, 10 to 12 and then when it kicks in dense, smoke your weed. Okay. Wait, let's, let's go through it. Seriously. You know what I realized about sober October? Yeah. Cause I'm going to go to hot yoga here in a little while is um, drinking and stuff is so much, not a part of my regular routine that I could accidentally slip probably more than anybody else. In other words, I put so little thinking and attention into like getting a drink that I'm the one that could easily, I feel like, I mean we're already halfway through the month, but easily someone could be like, oh hey I got your beer. And I'd be like, oh, okay. Yeah cause you don't think about it. Yeah, I don't think about it.

Speaker 5:          00:26:29       Like I posted a joke this weekend after a show, a potter and I went to a hotel bar and I ordered a coffee and he ordered a bourbon and I was like, Oh I think I'm going to break. You can do it. And I, you know, I drank my coffee, but yeah. Well alcohol's not a big deal for you. Getting high is not a big deal for, you know, I know that's what he was like, yeah, but you're, you're not sober cause you're eating, you're drinking coffee. I was like, first of all, it was decaf straight cause it was like 1130. I ordered a cup of decaf just to have it crank of something. But, um, that definitely was not part of our arrangement was like caffeine, which I did by the way. I did do no coffee for the last 10 days of the weight loss challenge.

Speaker 5:          00:27:14       That sucks so bad. I mean, I mean, you're not Mormon. This isn't the no, I know. I don't want to do that shit man. Caffeine isn't that bad for you. Yeah. I feel like I couldn't live without coffee. It's my, that is my one thing for sure. Yeah. I can't go without love it. I love coffee too. We have a toddler. How do you get through having young children without drinking coffee? Yeah, I dunno. It's fucking nuts. Nuts. So, but, but Joe's off the weed. He uh, he didn't do it. I mean, he, he, people thought he was smoking weed, but he's not, he's not smoking. No, no, he's fine. He seemed totally, totally. He's like, it's not party. Also, a lot of these things were not hard for everybody. For you too. Now there's two other people in this challenge who are not thrilled.

Speaker 5:          00:27:57       This actually is much more of a challenge for Aerie. Bart, they are there. I can tell like I think Ari's more troubled or bothered. Well definitely by not smoking weed. He's a really heavy weed smoker. Smokes weed every day. So that's definitely a challenge. He hates the idea of going to this class just because it's an inconvenience, which I can say I totally understand it is a major inconvenience. Like where could we end this podcast right now where we could be doing it later. But I have this and I have a meeting and I'm trying to fit hot yoga either like I can go either before the meeting or after. I'd much rather get it in before. So after my meeting I can come home because if I don't then I have to go from a meeting to hot yoga and then I'm home fucking you know, super late tonight.

Speaker 5:          00:28:51       Well cause you guys are also doing 90 minute class, 90 fucking minute classes and 15 of them. It's a lot of time commitment especially because you're not just going for 90 you have to drive there exactly what to get your shit together. Go. Yes. Now how sweaty do your nuts get? It's an, I'm just actually, it's when I'm done with class, it's like I just got out of a pool. Yeah. It's just I'm completely soaked. Do you smell other people? No. People are pretty decent, you know, I think they show up clean and you're not right. You don't smell people. I think also because like the smell, someone would be either they're dirty when they got there or you'd be hanging out there way out. You know what I mean? Like you wouldn't smell right away and less like one of the teachers one time pointed out like, Hey, if you're coming to this class, uh, you like a bunch of before, you're going to fuck with people. Like, so don't do that. So it would be a jerk. Don't be a jerk to take 10 to 12 Benadryl and then take this class. It's super hard and see if your heart just explodes. Yeah. Horny. I am

Speaker 9:          00:29:56       how Horny I am in Canada now I have to tell you that I used to take yoga in Santa Monica. Yeah. Like a million years ago. And I always noticed that the men, there's really not great yoga attire for men. Like the women have all the accessorizing. So all dudes are in Speedo, right? Like it's, it's a bad fashion. They just haven't really marketed it for men enough. So I remember standing behind certain gentlemen, um, when they would do the pose where you, you got one leg on the floor and then one leg goes back and up towards the, he's amazed, right jasmine? Yeah. W where your leg goes back. So, you know what I'm saying? So one leg back, one laying on the floor. And I remember seeing countless nuts. Yeah, countless balls. And it's funny the first time. And then you're like, really? Like you can't cover your nuts for this class. Like, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:30:47       balls are a, yeah, I'm lucky I haven't seen balls. I've seen some weird dudes. And then there was one day where these two guys, I was like, well look, I was like, the fuck is up with these guys. And then it hit me that they were like developmentally disabled guys. Oh. And because they were doing like goofy faces and they were acting goofy, like they were just acting weird. And then I was like, oh, I think they're like, maybe the bus brings him here, you know, as part of a program or something. And I also noticed that the teacher never like the teacher will um, tell, you know, tell people like our Laura, you got to keep that left shoulder aligned. Tom Tried to roll forward further on your head, feet stay on the ground. But these two he never addressed. And I'm like, why isn't he addressing these two goofballs?

Speaker 5:          00:31:37       And then I realized that like, Oh, I think they're special. You know yoga. Yeah, they were, they were kind and one of them farted and yeah. Yeah. And then one of them like was just playing with his shorts and like, and then one of them just stayed on the ground and wasn't really doing poses. And I'm like, why aren't you like as if somebody else, you know, I reached for water ones, not a water break, Tom. And I was like, okay. So it's like, why are you not addressing these two guys? And then I realized, oh, and one of them showed up in Khakis and a button down shirt and dress socks and we were all like, ah, fuck. Because it's, you know, it's 104 degrees in there. Yeah. And then he left and came back and pajamas and I was like, I dunno what's going on with this guy.

Speaker 5:          00:32:19       Like thick pajamas? No, like regular, but like still no one addressed him. Yeah. So that's what you do though, right? Give him a pass. Somebody of course. But I was like, at first I was just like, what is up with these guys man? You can't really chastise them, you know? No, of course not. No, no, no. So they farted somebody farther. Yeah, one of the guys farted. Did you laugh? Of course. But I kind of kept to myself. You know, there's this like culture in, in big room where there's not a lot of laughing. There's no, it's all pretty, you have to, you know, you don't really get that much out of it if you're not focused. So people don't have a beak crumb. Oh, okay. Big. There's not a lot of goofing off. Yeah. That's so funny. Most of my peers, often there is with was when a is when Burt's next to me, you know, like sometimes.

Speaker 5:          00:33:08       Yeah, sometimes, uh, you know, we'll do that. I forget the plane pose where like your arms are straight out next to you, you know, and then your and your legs are straight back and I'll reach over and I'll just like touch his arm or touch his hand and he'll be like, he'll be like, well then I'll just, you know, I pay attention to where the teacher is and I do like little goofy shit like that, but it's pretty serious. Wow. Yeah. Have you had any enlightenment thoughts? No, not super enlightenment, but I do, I do say it. I mean you definitely there. There's some times you get emotional and certain poses, which is weird. It's interesting. And I do think, um, you have amazing clarity at the end of class. You know, if you go, when you get through a whole class, you're laying there, you um, your mind feels very clear.

Speaker 5:          00:33:56       It's like you can make, if you had to like make a big decision, I would go to one of those classes and think about it afterwards. Interesting. I like that. That's exciting. Yeah, it's good. It's good. I mean, I do, I do see the benefit. The only part that sucks is with the bet. It's like you're just having like, you know, my week is crazy this week. Yeah. Right. I sent you my schedule because I have to go to all these meetings and it's like I'm trying to figure out how to fit in all these goddamn sessions. You know, it's the time commitment. The time. It's not like you can do it at home either. No. You gotta go to the class. That's the tough part. Yeah. Well you're all, you're halfway through it. Right. If I go to today, what I'm going, um, will be numbers seven and then I can't go tomorrow, but I'm going to try to go Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

Speaker 5:          00:34:43       I'm going to try to go three days in a row, two to tack on a few more. And at that point I'll only have five to do, but I'll have, I'll have enough days to hit them now at the end of the class, did they hand out some rings and like bracelets are such weird guys. And the guys are all weird. The girls are weird girls. Definitely weird girls. But there's some normal girls. Most of the dudes are odd. Yeah. Yeah. They're awkward guy. Man Bonds. There's a couple of man button guys. Um, couple. Yeah. Wristband, leather wristband guys. All the leather cough, you know, couple just Petrouli salesman, you know, just weird dudes. Weird Sharman guys. Um, come hugs. There's no dude's where you're like, like there's not a guy in there or I could be like, you see the game last night? Cause they'd be like, what game are we talking about? The game of life. I mean like, I don't know. Would they will say

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       nobody looks like they watch the game is all [inaudible]. All the guys like the God, his twin activator guy for this. A patch of the students. Yeah. Some of the instructors are God, his twin activators. Yeah. Or like I can teach you how to come hug and yeah, a lot of Vegan Vagina dudes and now the girls are weird. How, what's their style? There's a couple like, you know, the girl with like the third I think on her forehead she wears like a Bindi or something here. Yeah. Like a sticker, a sticker like hardcore Vegan lifestyle, you know, just like real grungy of the earth. Weird in that sense. Yeah. Real spiritual where you're like, Oh god, you'd be unbearable to talk to. Um, and then there's, oh no, there's like some sweet older ladies, so you know, like go into there, you could tell like they're, they're enlightened in life with age right there, like wise kind of cool.

Speaker 2:          00:36:34       Some of them seem like they're cool older ladies. Yeah. Um, I mean you're definitely not getting like a party girl vibe in Beek rum. It's not like the class of Beckerman get wasted after now. There's none of those. There's nothing like that in there. Sure. Um, couple of Rehab checks for sure. You can tell this is like part of getting their life back together. Sure. You could tell you like you partied hard before. There's definitely some of that, you know? That's cool. Yeah, so that's good. Rob. Rob. Oh Man. What if you started doing that during be chrome? Well, especially if you, the professor, the on the Thailand Penis. I'm like lamb penis was land is exactly where I want to do it. You Know Rob, rob, I wish, I wish you had some advice for, for women. I feel like it's very penile. I cannot believe you just said that.

Speaker 2:          00:37:28       For people that don't listen to this show regularly, Christina doesn't get the folders. She doesn't get these clips they're sent to me. And then if I want her to see one of ahead of time, I sent her to them so that she knows. But otherwise the whole fun is to play clips and surprise. Christina upset me. Yeah. And now he has female advice. See, I know I'm on the same wavelength. I feel like I entered. I feel like I know this guy. Yeah. Here's the rub up. Guy has tons of rubbing ticks for women. Isn't that great? That is a nasty, I'm not even sure. I want to hear you want to hear it?

Speaker 10:         00:38:06       Ah, so we have God. Okay. We have the One lady to practicing in the vagina because the vagina, the vulva, the vagina. When you're too loose, especially with the delay, they have baby.

Speaker 2:          00:38:22       Right. That's kind of my problem. We about it. And you see there were done. It's small, right? When the baby has this big, yeah. Yeah. After that it's very loose. Right? So you got loose posters. When he's talking to this baby comes out, you got to lose puss. So then what?

Speaker 10:         00:38:41       So when they make less before them, when they, before they had baby, they make lovely. So amazing. So after that baby, when they put the penis in, the men put the penis in his hand and I in or out because to lose, they don't feel it.

Speaker 2:          00:39:00       I love his face. Am I in or out to loose? After we were like, am I in? Oh No, you have to lose those fucking no. A bear trap. Yeah, it's a snug little. It's like you got, it's like you've got a little mouse in there going, all right,

Speaker 10:         00:39:19       well we have to practice the regimen. The exercise, we call it exercise, exercise. It gets up for the strengthening the vagina, give him an egg and they'd practice like clenched down on the leg. You put the Shit Eric,

Speaker 2:          00:39:33       the Shag, you should again, your pussy cover the egg and shit and you put it, you put that shit ain't shit egg. You cover your egg and shit.

Speaker 10:         00:39:48       Pete Godfrey and the way we teach the people in the workshop how to do exercise when Barton, because a woman, when this was done, our loose the fest or wrinkle, but this one type the first time, how does that work?

Speaker 2:          00:40:02       That was the best, but he was like, how does that work? But it makes sense. Your face shutters as he asked that question, watch Brian

Speaker 10:         00:40:11       all wrinkled, but this one tight, the face tighter. How does that work?

Speaker 2:          00:40:16       Yeah. You stupid. Fuck. Yeah, right. That's true. That's a good question. So what he's suggesting is you take your shit covered egg. You put it in your posts. When you're pushed tightens, your face tightens. Oh, I see. I don't know how that works. It's all connected. Your Vagina is the same as your face. God dammit. Free episode. Every episode. Every damn time. Uh Huh.

Speaker 10:         00:40:43       Because when you lose, you lose. Our life was all leak out because I have flow or lie a big door in the window or your door is leaking all the heat out and look at week.

Speaker 2:          00:40:58       Ah, see that's why I'm so cold all the time. My door's open, my leaky doors, energy door is open. If you tighten your posts door tight, where do I get this shit? Egg? Is he selling those at the seminar? We gotta go. I gotta pay for this. We have video of him talking about massage your testicles. Rabie Dick 350 times and now shove eggs in your pussy. I really would love to watch him make love to you. I think it's amazing experience. I is so nasty. I mean, it's different. It's not like, it wouldn't be like one of those hammer like pornos where it's like some guy like gorilla pounding you. This guy would like really enlightening. I think every year you're always hung up on this technique stuff as if that negates the fact that he is not like, you know. You ever watch that show Battlestar Galactica?

Speaker 2:          00:41:50       No. Backend. What's a show that had sleeves stacks on there? They're constantly stacks. Well, the guy looks like a sleeve stag and I can't get over it. Call me superficial. Just close your eyes. But he let him say you to a wonderland. They crept bid. Yeah, but you the dollar. The concerned about reduce the machine. You have to, when a play that, again, I was understand what he just said. The mental, mental, mental already concerned about reduce the medication. You have to reduce the, reduce the menstrual cups, reduced what? The Mentor, Mentor, Mentor three men. Preregistration. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:42:24       leaking comas. Energy. Got To reduce my menstruation. Yeah. How do I do that? Here you go. What will reduce the amount of dumb reducing is the massaging the breast. There you go. Every month. A woman wanted to have baby or not have baby. The body producing that every man. Right. And in a moment of producing the body had to pee pee entity to make milk. Right, right. Wait a minute to make the milk, but you only make the milk if you have the baby. He's not an understanding how this works. You don't make milk producing the egg guy. He's got his science wrong. I don't know. So I have to hold on in order to reduce my menstrual flow, to keep my energy, I have to rub my breasts during and put it on and put an egg in my book. This isn't going to be a full time job. So big time commitment.

Speaker 11:         00:43:29       Yes. So

Speaker 2:          00:43:30       who is so book? Uh, I know, right? It's great when these loose the face Aringo right? Yep. But see how nice and wrinkle free my phases. Yeah. You look like you have a tight pussy. That's how you can tell who's machine is like, yes. That's a whole new way of thinking about it. Yeah. Actually that'll never leave my mind again because it'd be like every time I see a wrinkle face, I'm going to be like, God, tighten your posts up. Your door's open. Yeah. All the energy is leaking out of your box right now. Tighten your dog your door and then your face will get nice and they'll be like, what? You should bring this up at yoga today. Yeah. Especially if I see a wrinkled lady. I'm telling you though, if this guy, let's put this way, if I took his technique and I was looking at nice blonde lady teaching this shit to people, I can get on like the today show and be like, ladies, yeah, you want to fix those wrinkles.

Speaker 2:          00:44:21       It's totally, you got to tighten your visual with him. They're just like, it's this a jerk off. It's all about the packaging. Yeah. I feel like we've talked about that with jokes. It's like bits work from certain sources. Sure. You know, of course you got to from a certain person, they can't. I mean they can say it, but it's not going to have the same impact. Absolutely. Absolutely. It's all about the shell, the shell, your end. Definitely. But I feel like I could turn that into a seminar and really make a living. Go do it. Go make $1 billion getting women's wrinkles go away and then you have that, you know people so want the wrinkles go away. That right away they'd be like, I see them. Some of my wrinkles are gone. And you'd have people testimonies. Like I went to Christina's loose puss seminar and I had wrinkles and now some of them went away cause my pussy is tied again like that.

Speaker 2:          00:45:10       We could sell those eggs till yeah you have your Shit, Egg shed, ag dip and Shit and put, I mean he doesn't talk about Ken. An egg just break in your box. Theoretically when you squeeze an egg on all sides, it doesn't break. You have to have like a ring on or something sweet like you did in science class. Right. As a kid, I don't think he means, I hope he's not meaning a literal ag that you would eat but like something in the shape of one like one of Lj Zags. Yeah. Like a fan or son lives. That's a big thing to put up there to PR. I mean, Jeez Dude, I dunno. He didn't know what the hell he's talking about. Uh, bullshit. He doesn't always talk. We've been doing this for like 40 years. He knows what he's talking about. So when the lady, when when they, when the egg mature the on up a lot and he now when he's stuck and you don't Trump don't do anything with it, it become lamb and lump become Puma and they become, we'll call.

Speaker 2:          00:46:14       I said, ah, he's just sold breast cancer. Damn. I didn't realize I miss command, which she been up to. I wonder. I don't know. Do you remember we had the, didn't we have that Kim in Mashup, right? Yeah. She's like with what's the rub rub guy and man together, rap, rap, rap, rap and my as hell. I do say I put Eh Shit, Eh, in my heart say but China but China, but dyna fat fat in this lovely house. And when she said that, when she fell on her porn, she goes, we are here today. I liked that. She did this lovely house and I have to paint his dad. I liked that we had, um, the Kim in the sheet, he did a 60 plus MILF 60 process meal, uh, PC, like a clean version. Right. Then she did the hardcore version. Right. She did the Youtube version so it wouldn't get flagged. Yeah. Like the, the advertisement for it. I Dunno why they make them do too well to Lauryn, the perverts on you tube I guess. And then the real one is on the website. That makes sense. Yeah. You want to get you casting the net for all the pervs. Yeah. You gotta have, you gotta have them all there.

Speaker 12:         00:47:47       How'd you say, and I'm here to film at, this is such a beautiful, um, we CD with the first time of ever experience in my life with two young men and they had big heart car. This is the hardcore version. Pluralize Mark Cox plural, really quaint place. Quiet place is really, really comfortable with a lot of art effects. Oh, side of the house as well as elsewhere. People are looking at anything else really, really comfortable being outside, especially with the two gentlemen who really tweaked me very special. Oh my ultimate goal is to really get them to be really, really hot and I feel that [inaudible] Kim Allen on a lot to offer. Yeah. Oh you do though? It's my first time. I was a little bit shaking. Yeah. Do you think would be

Speaker 2:          00:49:00       worse? That makes you shake? It'd be harder for me to be with Kim on or for you to be with this guy. Oh, you would be key. You would destroy him on why? I feel like you would like her cause she so she looks great. She looks better than me. Nobody was fit. Come on man. No, you'd be, you'd be fine. He, this guy's a troll. Command's got her shit together. At least you think I could make love to Kennedy. You would make sweet love to came on. I think I'd be way too gentle for her. She'd be like, you don't pound crowd then pow. I was like, I'm sorry. You don't want to hurt it. What? Oh, has house asking for attention. She would let you put it in her butthole. Oh, that would be like first move. Yeah. She'd be like, why are you doing with that? Push right in there and get back their peg, get back.

Speaker 12:         00:49:52       I go with it. And really satisfying. It's satisfying like my whole body with my whole body because they're so nice. Yeah. She's sweet lady actually. Do you think so? Yeah. And Save beautiful words. I feel like, um, there are beautiful words and I feel experience and, and I, I was so hot for them especially, um, on the scene that they put their hard copy. I mean to my asshole. There it is.

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       I was so ready to come. I feel like it's weird that cause she's so, she doesn't speak like she's ever seen porn before. I know. It's like, do you, have you seen the stuff that you're filming? You know what, that's a really interesting point. And I think maybe not. Yeah. I think what this is for her, I really think she's one of these people who at 60 was like, I want a new experience. Yeah. And heard about like, well you can film it. And do all these crazy things and she went for it. I don't think she had like years of watching it and knowing about it. No, no. I think there's such a naive a tay there. Cause usually it's the guys being like, what am I doing today? And then girls like, well I'm going to spread my pussy and these guys are going to come in my mouth. And you know, they know the jargon. Yeah, no she doesn't know this is really her sexual lingo, liberation or whatever, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's usually a guy. Well you had that clip playing the other day. We were like, you're going, these guys are going to come in your hair and then you're going to massage it and it's like a come shampoo and you're like, actually it's right

Speaker 13:         00:51:36       some of this with you here alone because what's going to happen? All these guys are going to materialize all over the place. Okay. Okay. And then what? You go do it, do it. Your face is going to lean back here. Ashley's going to care. You're like this right here. This is going to put your head back and the guys can do, they're going to come up here and they're to jack off in your hair. Oh, so got to do where they're doing this is keep your hat and Ashley's going to be massaging the come into your hair get and this is really good for you. Good solid protein in the hair.

Speaker 2:          00:52:08       Yeah. Yeah. See that's the average shoot film. Shoot. Yeah. And she goes, we are filming today. Like she really is nice things. They were saying the artifacts from yes in the house and she's like, sweet lady caress my body. Like I don't, I didn't see any of that. And they're like, ah, I did get granny. Like nobody's caressing. Do they anything right? Hammer this lady. Oh of course. That's the whole thing. 60 press mouth that you get hammered gentlemen, gentlemen. And I think she learned the gentleman because of the gentleman's club, you know, and like they call strip bars the gentleman's club, which is always silly. Like really like there's guys in suits that are showing up. Yeah. What gentlemen are coming here and she probably saw a gentleman, right? She saw a gentleman club and was like, oh these are, these are gentlemen. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like guys are interested in sex or gentlemen, these are not gentlemen. These are not gentlemen. Hate to tell you. Uh, we'll just, that will not act as for women as well. Nice. And massage the breast. Okay. Massage, massage back forward, backward and sticking the breadth and pushing the breath.

Speaker 2:          00:53:20       There's the, this is Adam is looking for what? Cause he could teach you this and he'll be like, yeah, like this, like this. And you're like, ah, yes. My Dick get hard. Yeah. People pay me $500 I show up as ridiculous. Show me the massage again. It's crazy. I want to say stop my stop back and forward back work and checking the breath, using the breath and pushing them together. And that helps you not get breast cancer. Right, right, right. Just alluded to, right. Right. To a fight. Breast Cancer. I have to do it. This is how 12 year old boys imagine like girls playing. This was a 12 year old boys. Imagine what doctors do, like when you go, if a woman goes, I'm going for a physical, they're like, I got to play with your tits. Put an egg in your purse, right? This guy's like, yeah, it's actually very effective way to, to keep a healthy body going.

Speaker 2:          00:54:30       What? Is this all one interview or did this guy come back for my debt part? I don't know. I feel like it's gotta be the same one and we just didn't absurd. He just found out about it and in his dad shoes. Yeah, those are Nice Nike's. Right, but they're dead and Nike's. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Yeah. The other dude's got on like dress shoes. This guy just went for his walk, his morning Tai Chi walk and then Kate at the interview and you and the women. So the women probably take three to six months to learn all these techniques. It's longer, longer, longer, or they have to learn how to feel the contracting or the uterus. I can go out the uterus, London Real, you can watch their a youtube channel and learn all about this stuff and it's very, very good information. And then I got to do my urine enema.

Speaker 2:          00:55:20       I don't forget that when these loose the faced origo you go my urine therapy. I got to squeeze my egg. I got it was squeezed my boobs. He's awesome. I got to take 16 Benadryl and then smoke pot. Okay, and then you have fun romp Africa. Yes. I think it has got to be the same idea. Right? Let's see. Let's see. Yes. Now you'll do it. You'll feel, oh really? Yes. Orgasm without ejaculation. So you feel so you see when you do, when you squeeze all guests. I'm coming up the interviewer laughing, but don't you feel like we should put the Benadryl guy and him together? Oh yeah. You're super horny and then he's like penis like that.

Speaker 2:          00:56:21       You smoke your weed. Yeah. Restless leg syndrome. He massage like that. We have two methods that could go really well together if he just thought about it and you throw a command in there. I mean it's a perfect, perfect mix. Perfect system. We've got the perfect, the perfect smile. Perfect system. It's really something Jane or up. What'd you do? When I was going this week, just rubbed my titties and played with my eggs through eggs. Firmed it all up there. You can see how wrinkle free my shit is now. Yeah. Hung out with a little jeans that good. Ah, he's the best dude. Yeah. He's Super Fun to hang out with the dogs. I just chilled. I chilled really hard. I needed to be home for a minute, you know, doing nothing. That's my favorite. I've been baking lately and I'm a terrible baker because I watched that British baking show and now I think I can beg, but I, I just fuck it up every time.

Speaker 2:          00:57:14       But I still like it. You know, it's, it's a good to do things. You're not, you're not great at Joe Rogan. I were talking about that. He, he's, he does things, he's not great. And I was like, Oh yeah, I think I've started doing that now. Cause it's nice to, to enjoy something even though you're not good at it and sure. And also feel like you can try to get better at it. So Lj helps me bake. Super Cute and uh, and yeah, go to the park, run around, took some naps. Couple of questions came in via email. No boy, conjoined twins who wipes with although reason curiosity about how blind people experience certain aspects of life. I'm reminded of the mini taboo questions I have regarding conjoined twins. I identify as an amateur scientist and according to my research, most people wipe it the same wipe dominant hand.

Speaker 2:          00:58:04       Huh. I'm curious about wiping with conjoined twins. Do they argue about who's going to wipe or does one twin always wipe? I appreciate any input towards my research, but it must warn you. Try not to go too deep down the conjoined twin rabbit hole quick. It gets pretty dark. Thank you for all the work and congrats on the awesome Netflix Special Christina jeans up posedown Steven. Wow. Well that's just, I mean I don't think we would not know but we can put it out there obviously to the universe. Well now we've opened up a whole other cannabis gets, I know can join twins questions. Very, very true. I have so many questions for conjoined twins. It. I mean, when it comes everything, everything. How do you do everything? How do you decide what you do that day? Do they separate people? How does that even, I don't know, but that's a great question. God, how do you like someone at the other person's therefore it obviously obviously, so you're always in an orgy. Like basically you both have to be dating somebody, let's say theoretically and then you guys were like, everybody want to do it. Okay, great. Who, what guy? I mean, I'm sorry. Or girl meets a conjoined twins. Look, I'm into this. I mean, I don't mean it to sound hateful, but I mean really how it's too hard. Just just

Speaker 9:          00:59:22       logistically speaking. Yeah. You know, just because you're, you're dating two different people basically. And they, they have distinct personalities. So of course you're, you're always dating the sister and the sister in law.

Speaker 5:          00:59:34       Get out of that. How can you get over that brother and the brother in law? It's a lot. How do you masturbate? How do you shit, how do you also with the mash, I mean, do you realize that they could be like that? Like my conjoined brother could be like a, it could be like, um, I'm want to jerk off and he's like, I don't want to turn it off. Like I want to go to sleep. I'm tired. I have a busy day tomorrow. Right. I'm horny. No, and then you have the same body

Speaker 9:          01:00:02       you're fighting over. I guess in that case you let the brother do the jerking and then you're just like, well, I'm just ignoring this. Yeah. I mean the whole, I don't know. I'm so sad is that show, the show obviously isn't on anymore. Brittany and Sally whenever it was, two different joints, but they don't, they don't answer the important questions, not any questions that anyone wants to know. Of course there their questions were like, how do you guys deal with feelings? And you're like, no, I wanted to hear about that. I don't hear about blow dry. How do you take a shit? Yeah. How do you date? How do you,

Speaker 5:          01:00:37       how do you wipe God?

Speaker 14:         01:00:43       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:00:44       If a police officer has to handcuff someone and that person is missing a hand, what did they do? How did they handcuff the mist from Dave? That seems like something that a police officer, there's definitely a police officer's listen to the show. You must've run into that. Yeah. I imagine they would cut the one hand is then you, then you do the ankle thinks they can't run away I guess, but a free hand is too, you know, too dangerous to have free so like you got, yeah, you got to handcuff it to something, but I want to, I want to know like if you're a cop and you've ever been in that situation, what do you do? Do you stick his hand down his pants? Why would he do that? Just to be like play with it down there. We can't have that out here. Handcuff his hand to his dick and balls. That's silly Tom. It's very silly but it could happen. Got All these great life questions. Really great questions. Important question about come hugging. Hi Mommy's. I showed some friends the clip of the Com huggers. One of my friends raised an interesting question. If somebody come hugs you without you knowing or without your consent, is that a crime? How many Patrick rapers are out there. Scottio and he's demonic. Wife Creep me out. Thanks. Genes. Check, check

Speaker 15:         01:02:20       energy up our bodies. So actually the longer we make love, the more energized we get.

Speaker 5:          01:02:28       Right. Such a Weirdo. I want her and the rub rub guy and the Benadryl guy and came in in the same room, all of them. That's a fun movie. Make that film. And they'd be like, I really feel like this is enough Benadryl. And that dude be like, got, have 10 to 12, 10 or 12 the whole movie would be about getting people to take more Benadryl, 10 to 12 and now even that, that Thai guy be like too many, too many pills for five B, that's so many miles. You cannot take that. You would, I would have a heart attack. That stuff freaks me out so badly. Could you imagine? Yeah. Half of that dose would kill me half the dosage so much. It's so much.

Speaker 5:          01:03:28       You're so whacked out in your mind. They're totally crazy. You gotta be crazy to take that much. No, you shouldn't do that as guys bad. We should say that is bad. It's so bad advice. And then to smoke dope on top of that, like what? I mean, no wonder your brain's gone. Your might, your everything is shut down except for your painter. This is, um, we brought up, you know, inappropriate parents talking about sex. I was that you had this, Josh Potter has great stories about this. They've got an email. Someone said, Hey, I was listening to your podcast for 17. You brought up parents talking about sex. I was like, also how like, we never want to sexually talk in front of our son. It's so inappropriate to discuss your sex lives in front of your children, uh, to discuss any aspect of your sex.

Speaker 5:          01:04:17       Life. Person said wrong. It prompted me to talk about my 20 year long nightmare. My father passed away when I was a kid. My mom raised my brother and I by herself. When I turned 13, I started to notice my mom becoming more and more comfortable with innuendos up. Talking about the female anatomy. I'll cut to the chase and give you some very low and loose scenarios. Here's quotes from her. I sweat a lot during sex. Uh, general talks about how when she gave birth to my brother and I, we destroyed her vagina one time when at dinner she ordered a Sunday when the server asked if she wanted a cherry. She responded. I haven't had my cherry and almost 20 years. Oh boy. She has since remarried. A great guy. They will talk about her sex life with openly at the dinner table. These are just a few scenarios I have dealt with in my life. I agree with you guys. It is not right. It makes me so nauseous. I can't even eat moose soup anymore. Love you. Mommy's keep them high end type Tom is the personality champ. Hm. Yeah. I mean I I dated. He really went through, right, right.

Speaker 9:          01:05:18       It's disgusting. But my dad, not my dad. My, I dated a guy whose father would make sexual jokes constantly, constantly. And that is just weird. It's so disgusting.

Speaker 5:          01:05:31       Other kids' parents like that. My parents were hardcore. The opposite, right? Zero, right. Yeah. I mean the most I got w I would pick up on as I was older, my dad, but doing a dad joke to another adult in other words, like it wasn't for the kids. Right. You know what I mean? Like somebody would say a couple of state troopers. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it was like, it would be like kind of like add an earshot but never like to us or like, oh yeah, I used to get real hard with your mom, like no mine. Now it's also like now I kind of, I'm guilty of like poking and prodding them to get,

Speaker 9:          01:06:15       say those things, you know, almost 40 and I'm like trying to get it to happen. You're asking for my mother. When my mother passed away in 2015 we were going through old photographs and my dad, uh, texted me and sent me copies of these photos he was looking at. He's like, oh, you got a mom had great tits, great ass. And I was like, oh, thank you. Thanks for telling me. That's why he married her. Good tits. Good ass. Thank you. Is that, that's the last thing you want to hear about your dead mom is how great her tits in her ass were very attractive. Thank you. Your mom also had like told you about sex when you were real young. There is a lot of that. Um, she, I think she thought she was teaching me. Yeah. That's the thing is that she wasn't doing it and like a perverse way, but she was like, you got to learn these things.

Speaker 9:          01:07:05       It was like she was way ahead of schedule. I was about eight or nine or 10 and it was like she was giving me tutorials on how to please men and this and that. And I was like, first of all, first of all, this stuff and my mother's biggest thing was having a clean vagina. You'll have to keep your what Jina Glean. And she had like that old school douche bag, like an old douche with like the big red nozzle and the black and it was disgusting. And then she would uh, she was obsessed with, you have to let your vagina breathe so at night, no underwear in the pajamas, you have to let your vagina breathe. Now my mother also weren't nylon tights under her tight jeans. So of course I think she was strangling her vagina. So she really needed to let it breathe at night.

Speaker 9:          01:07:53       Sort of a curious lesson for an eight year, nine year old though. Yeah. And too early. And then she had edible panties that was the most disgusting and it was by her bedside. So I like, I was privy to her nightstand contents, you know, like she would show me what was in there and it was like, this is being Yuck Colada flavor. I'm like, what's Colada? Like I was so young I didn't even know. And then I got to taste the edible panty. She like it was, it wasn't used or anything. She unwrapped it and was like, you want to taste it? And I was like, all right, I thought, but at the time you think it's so cool because you're privy to like grown up stuff. You're like, wow, a mom's best friend. This is great. I'm going to fluid bonded with Jesse. Yeah. Yeah. It was so wrong. Like you're never supposed to be your parents friends. Not even when you're an adult. You're never their friends. Yeah. You're always the child. I'm always going to be, I should always be a child. You're always my parents. So nasty. Yeah. Oh, it's so gross. I taste you taste. I tasted them and I remember being like, this is not good. Uh, yeah. So gnarly.

Speaker 5:          01:08:59       God, so gnarly. It's just the idea of the hot, sexy man check leading my life strangely turns me on.

Speaker 9:          01:09:10       That's my favorite part is the, the nervous laughter that accompanies these horny people. They're always nervously laughing. Like what the, the calm huggers. It's always this nervous

Speaker 5:          01:09:21       laughter. Yeah. By the way, we are always on the forefront of, um, you know, weird speaking patterns and yeah. We had that guy from Texas. Yeah. That was the weirdest fucking guy ever. Yeah. Um, and I ended up, he's all over Instagram too, and he has so many fucking, you know, uh, youtube subscribers, hundreds of thousands. But he has that crazy of an arcade in Dallas, Dallas. So weird man arcade and dedicate this list to everyone who has been affected by Hurricane Harvey Harvey. Yeah. I Dunno how he learned to speak, but his name's chills and I don't know. So anyways, there is that guy, um, hurricane Harvey, I guess the New York Times named their first female editor. Oh. And they did an interview with her. She has crazy vocal fry.

Speaker 9:          01:10:19       Wait a minute, this is the first female editor they'd had at the New York Times? I think so. I think that's what this is 2017, right? Yeah. Wow. Yeah. But I mean, the Nanas chicks don't even read and that's true. No, it's

Speaker 16:         01:10:34       meaningful to me that I'm the first woman executive editor of the New York Times.

Speaker 9:          01:10:42       Wow. Vocal fry. Cross generational.

Speaker 5:          01:10:44       No, and usually you don't see it. You see it in the young women. Right. You see it in the Kardashians inspired women. Right. I'm gonna go to the mall and get some new maker. I will say that I can go into it if I'm just tired and I'm not like, uh,

Speaker 16:         01:11:02       I almost said to me, I know I'm not supposed to ask this, but they'd asked me then a gender related question. I'm so proud of the fact that I am the woman to hold this job

Speaker 2:          01:11:18       and I have been together for nearly three years. Wild. I liked it. His grammar was proper there. He said, Megan and I, not me and Megan. So I am partial to that. Cling to hold this job that doesn't even seem real, uh, talks like that. This job. I've never heard someone say that, you know, you're the executive editor for the New York Times and you go, it's a good job.

Speaker 16:         01:11:51       I think. Yeah, the biggest challenge that I face as I prepare to be executive editor is making everyone in our news room as comfortable with this transition that we're now well into. And I think maybe under my watch will arrive at the other side and it's happening.

Speaker 5:          01:12:14       It's hot fun.

Speaker 2:          01:12:16       I'm not saying shit bad about the New York Times. They wrote a nice article about me, so I'm not going to say job. Yeah, that's true. You were in the New York Times not saying any of this job job. Well, this, um, the article is really good. It's basically time shutting the fuck up right now. I'm not talking shit about the executive editor. It's about the mom lane in comedy. Right. Ali Wong and I are now, we're officially declared a movement. Yeah. It takes a no and a few other women are doing. Yeah, but you guys are really doing something for it.

Speaker 5:          01:12:52       Um, Steven Seagal is the latest to be accused of sexual harassment, but banana, it's like a 20 year old harassment, but oh no. Yeah. Then 1996, that woman, that's who the picture was of, remember I pull up that picture. She was in the wrong file. She, uh, was, she wasn't to his house. He summoned her to his house to read for a role and she showed up with, she brought a woman, a casting director, whether it's the golf, sat in a silk robe and watched her do the scenes and yeah. And he said, and then that same day the manager called and said, [inaudible] God wants to offer you the lead, but you have to go back to his home for a private rehearsal tonight. No, and she didn't want to do it. So they offered her like a one scene role instead and cut her from the movie and she said on set, he would be like around guys and look at her and snicker and you know, wow. Yeah, there you go.

Speaker 2:          01:13:58       I am the king of Improv is for free. It's so, it's so odd. I mean, he's usually such a normal guy. Like there must be a new movie with him out by the, because people keep sending

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       me clips of a new movie, which is, it's like breaking down all this legal walls

Speaker 2:          01:14:21       that we thought existed. No, wait a minute. Is it on Youtube? Do we have a trail? I think it's on, I think it's on Netflix, but no. Well I think so. All his movies end up there, right? We've, we've watched a few on there, but I think he's got a new one where, let me see if this is Tiki Punch in the raper. Yeah. His new one looks like a real hot pile of shit. Um, look, I fucking just pulled up my fucking in fucking oh no. Look at that. In Aries there too. Airy fairy Shaffer. See Steve. I'll see if he's got a new one. Steven Seagal. You say that's not how you say it. I say Steven Seagal. Seagal. How do you say it when he was sick? Tommy, right. Say Sea Gulls. He Gal. Gal wasn't asked to goal Segal.

Speaker 5:          01:15:09       Steven Segal even. He's such a weird dude,

Speaker 2:          01:15:14       man. This whole thing about he lives in Russia now, right? Yeah. I don't know if they're alive. So weird.

Speaker 5:          01:15:21       Is it this guy? These guys, so many movies.

Speaker 2:          01:15:25       I mean, are you American or not buddy? You got to choose a side. You with the commies. Are you with us man? Asian connection or we watched that one. Asian connections. Fantastic weapon. One Star. Go ahead.

Speaker 5:          01:15:37       Uh, Asian connection. Good man. I feel like we'd looked at that one. We looked at that one. Yeah. Is it code of honor? Is this the one maybe that he's [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:15:47       well why do all these tower title sound exactly the same? I don't know. It's like Asian Guinea pig shit, code of honor, man of words or whatever. They're all the same.

Speaker 5:          01:15:58       They sent me the, there's this scene where he's clearly, cause you know, he's like really good at Improv. He clearly is improvising with the actress. Oh. And it's so painful. You know like poor girl is just like, can I just stick to the script and he's like, you can, I'm going to fucking just riff. It's so terrible. He's, he's just the worst. Um, but yeah. So now he's the latest to be accused of uh, harassment.

Speaker 2:          01:16:27       Great. I love it. I hope this trend continues. I would like to drain the showbiz swamp of these creeps. That would be fantastic. Yeah. I wonder who we're going to find out is the next big creeper. Cause you know, once it, uh, once the can is open, once it starts make Hollywood Tan. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Did you see how dark his skin is? Yeah,

Speaker 7:          01:16:51       Babe. What you give your life to save the world? The world of course. Dump Shit Babe. He's like Brown. There's a real actor. Like I'm gonna try to act different and you're not telling me to take a look at his hair

Speaker 17:         01:17:11       is crazy. Come on. No, he's, he's so dark. The Iq can't, I can't even get over. How's Brown? His skin is news new Pale. He's normally very pale. He's doing news, new stuff. Every movie. Keep it exciting, man.

Speaker 2:          01:17:26       He's like that lady on the Maury Povich that we played. I remember the Maury Povich lady who went black with the injections.

Speaker 5:          01:17:32       Yeah, yeah, yeah. He might be doing that.

Speaker 2:          01:17:36       You might be going towards that. I've been black now for over a black. I'm like, wait a minute. No you're not. Yes I am. I wish someone had told me what that fucking mom black was because it was an amazing African American my whole life. He goes like, I love the fucker cookies and serious seeing that he just, Oh yeah, yeah, I love the fuck out of cookies. And we know that.

Speaker 5:          01:18:00       Yeah. If anybody knows the scene or the movie that, that that's in, I would really love to know is it looks like such a pile of shit.

Speaker 2:          01:18:10       His acting is really questionable. I mean that was like, that is what I thought. Like he doesn't even try. I know. Let's see if yeah. That that poor other actor was actually trying to react and, and have a moment and, and Seagal is just like, Eh, it does what I'd done. And then, then, then he's a weird,

Speaker 5:          01:18:33       yeah, he's very weird. A weird dude. Very weird guy. Um, lastly, before we get out of here, um, just thought that maybe you would like to check this out. Maybe it's a direction you want to go. And as a parent,

Speaker 17:         01:18:50       Sweden is the most forward thinking country in the world when it comes to questioning gender. The gender neutral Pronoun Hen is now

Speaker 2:          01:18:58       commonly used by my sweet. Yes. I love it. Yeah.

Speaker 17:         01:19:02       So just arrived in out of blue in Sweden. I'm about, it's going to be a family here attempting to bring up that kids free from old gender norms. Hey. Hello. How are you? This is nick.

Speaker 2:          01:19:16       Go. Yeah. What answered the door was that you'll see and not to be gender normative here. You'll see hen and answered for sure, man.

Speaker 17:         01:19:30       Well, Mama, is that your partner? Yeah, my pilot and he goes by Matilda and Matt, but is also the one who gave birth and that's just what felt right to me because I'm intersex. I was born with characteristics of both male and female. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:19:48       Oh Wow. Yeah. Got It all going on. Dell is an American photographer. He moved to Sweden for love. Their work has for over three decades focused on queer identities and challenging gender norms.

Speaker 5:          01:20:01       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:20:03       This is Nikos Room on how old this Nico. Nico is two and a half. I'm Mayfair is

Speaker 17:         01:20:08       a almost five and a half. Mika and Nico were both assigned male at birth and this family, the sex you were born with does not dictate your gender identity.

Speaker 2:          01:20:17       There you go. We could have done something about that ourselves to those were born with male characteristics. Those two, those two were, sorry, born says gender males. I think so. Right? Is that what you heard and not just that third born though? Is that what you heard him saying in the, that's what the, that's what they said, right? Yeah. Yeah. They're born male and then they're being raised age, gender, age, gender. Could I do,

Speaker 17:         01:20:45       we don't gender toys. We don't change your colors. So what happened? They're interested in, it's like they can just play with whatever toys they want it. And you would never dictate what last squat? No, absolutely not. So they both have a lot of cars. Interesting.

Speaker 2:          01:21:03       But interestingly enough, she opens up two drawers and all I saw were trucks, cars, Legos, traditionally boy things. I mean could that be because they were born boys and Bro, I don't want to, I don't want to be insensitive.

Speaker 17:         01:21:16       I was worried about with clay thing. Now Amica is for the past two months has worn a dress everyday. Just about when me is wearing dresses and because Mick has very, very long hair. Most people assume that me because female,

Speaker 2:          01:21:33       which is, well wait a minute, but that, wouldn't that be a gender norm? For instance, the long hair, he, she, they had just said the long hair is traditionally feminine. So isn't that a gender norm thing? The TTC, such probably what happened was that the child, so I don't want a haircut. Oh, my hair to be long. Okay.

Speaker 17:         01:22:01       We use he for them. Sometimes it's mixed and it depends, you know, because in Sweden we have hen the gender neutral pronoun in Swedish, I think Mika has always said when I've asked, it's been she or Ken.

Speaker 2:          01:22:17       Oh, there you go. Oh, so sorry. So the child is asking for she or hand. Well then there you go. Yeah. Then, then that's what the kid wants. And you, you know, you're the kind of leading comedic voice. How dare you, don't you dare, don't you dare. Don't you dare get me to be the, uh, the, the, the binaries. You are a lot. Oh boy. You're that comic. Now people ask me about the first 48 and bikes and shit. Oh wait, what's, yeah. Yeah. You're the person. I mean, I don't know. It's, it's uh, I will say that just watching our kid, uh, he's sorry, and they've been, our son has been privy to both dolls and trucks and bike, whatever leg I was. He doesn't really care for the dollies and it's not me being like, don't touch the dolls homo. It's not that. It's that he doesn't care. No, no, it's true. It's pretty. And he likes dirt and trashcan playing and stomping, stomping him like it's pretty, it's pretty gender specific. Loves it. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 17:         01:23:28       Well, how do you avoid gendering? Your children didn't choose anything bit gender neutral names. We chose not to know what sex they would be assigned when they were born. Not answering the question. Is it a boy or a girl to avoid

Speaker 2:          01:23:42       word and the g, the B word and the g word. How do you avoid knowing the gender they were assigned at birth? What does that mean? You don't look at their genitals? I think knowing beforehand. Oh, oh, caring that the home for a boy or a girl.

Speaker 17:         01:23:56       Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. All right. They would be assigned when they were born. Not answering the question. Is it a boy or a girl to avoid? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:24:04       Well the word and the g. What do you do when people say, is it a boy or a girl? So that's the answer. I would like to know what, what is it a boy or a girl? I guess it's up to the child now. Here's my thinking here. And maybe this, how do you handle a sweet old person? It's like boy or girl. And they're like, why don't you mind your fucking business? Why don't you respect it's pro down. It's a hen. Yeah. I think I also think that it sounds like this person was had to deal with a lot of shit growing up, being both genders, the intersex person. And that's gotta be so horrible to grow up with your whole life. But since you were fucked with and your kids probably wouldn't be, it's good to push your trauma onto them. That's a really good thing to do. Your two kids that were born as boys, you should definitely be like, I'm going to push my issues on. I mean, yeah, and I get the how painful that must have been for them because that sucks. It does. But to go this far with this stuff, like maybe you just need to see a third first and then

Speaker 17:         01:25:10       changing pronouns in book instead of it always being mama. We say Mama and my par, the Natter Sweetie Act. [inaudible] it's so dark.

Speaker 2:          01:25:23       Yeah. I want to know how grandma Margaret, of how her grandchildren are being raised.

Speaker 2:          01:25:47       So she's a normal sheet, but which one is her son? Is it the one that they've been interviewing other, the other parent, right. No, because the other parent is the one that gave birth. So the other one is a female by, so that would make sense that that person would go to kindergarten and address. So I'm thinking it's the one that's being interviewed. Right. But then she did have a normal old person response was like, it was fucking weird. Yeah. Yeah. Meaning like I've adapted. Yeah. And that like my own son was not allowed to do that. Yeah. I mean, look, I, I do feel like this stuff, these countries are generally more progressive. Yeah. There's a lot. This is a lot healthier society to live in. Yeah. And then we catch up to what they're doing in like 30 years. Yeah. But my stupid 41 year old brain is still just like, wait, what? Yeah. Like I'm not sure. Sure. I'm fully compensated. They have like a way healthier, I dunno. Like criminal justice system. Yeah. Healthcare all, all that is way, way further ahead in Sweden and then, yeah, that whole region really. Yeah. There variant than Netherlands, right? Isn't that what that's considered? No, I don't know what they are. Yes. Scandinavia. Yeah. Um, yeah, they, they tend to be way more progressive than, you know, in terms of the Western world and what we are at.

Speaker 17:         01:27:10       I mean, the reason I liked [inaudible] so much is because she thinks I'm a great mob. Pop right back. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:27:17       yeah, yeah. Well, it's interest.

Speaker 17:         01:27:20       Thank you. I know where this one or this one. You want this one? Okay. We're going to go with the red and black theme today then. Good idea.

Speaker 2:          01:27:32       See how many, on the other hand too, it's like you also are shaping how the kid responds to stuff. You know what I mean? Yeah. So it's like, is it really something that's originating in them or is it because they're watching you do your mob hot? True. Cause kids will just imitate what the fuck outta you, man. Yeah. Yeah man,

Speaker 5:          01:27:54       that's really, it's an interesting, like, it's a really interesting question to ask if you're a parent or just interested in how these things work because the kid does all kids, especially when they're around you a lot, your own kid, they just go like, you start seeing, they'd start, behave really doing things like you. Yeah. They, you know what I mean? You see the way that our kid picks up the phone and he's like, wow. Yeah. So I was talking to the phone and kind of like imitating the way I do it. Yes. It's just they do what you do. They do do what you do.

Speaker 17:         01:28:24       It's fascinating. I do pawned, and again, that's not something I always have to say, but it would be good to know today for the film [inaudible] Ella, him just Mikko. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:28:39       See I'm then again, are we, is this a lot of, let's see, that's a big decision like for us, such a small person personally. Yeah. What do you want your Pronoun to be today? And the kids like how about just call me by my name? Doesn't that also rattle their cage in terms of who their self is every day? Right. It's like, well maybe this kid has a, uh, an internal compass that's pretty sturdy and you're now you're, you're constantly forcing the questioning of that compass. Maybe that kid doesn't have the same stuff you did. Right. You know, like maybe your confused but your kid's not, and then you're making them insecure by being like, well, what's your pronoun? What's Your Pronoun? What'd your phone like? It's such a heavy thing to try to break down. The person that would best answer this question would probably be

Speaker 3:          01:29:24       truweight alone can get you really hornier than normal. But it's been an Andrew will take about 10, 12 Bannon girl before you want to have your sexual fun with your partner or whatever you do. Oh,

Speaker 2:          01:29:37       I feel like 10 or 12 drill would solve the world's problems. I think that if you gave that kid 10 or 12 vendor on your like, what's your pronoun? You're like, I can tell you now and forever

Speaker 5:          01:29:47       it's fucking hen. Okay. And then that's what it is. Hey, there you go, gene. Um, we got to go. This is a
