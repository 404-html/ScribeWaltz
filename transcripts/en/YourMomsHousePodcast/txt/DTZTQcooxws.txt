Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hi, eight or implicit. Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:00:03       well go to your mom's house. Christina

Speaker 1:          00:00:21       is this guy. I know who it is. I got it. I remembered it. That's the guy. I said, come here. Tickle your pussy. I got it. Yeah. Thank you. And he ate out raven. Simone. That's so raven. What a Dick for outing her like that, you know. Okay. I got it. The line. Remember, I don't, I don't like it. It's funny. I don't want to see it on your pussy bitch. Huh? That's funny. Um, for that. So he, it'd be a great shirt, but he fucking told people what he did with. Huh? That's not how you, that's not, you shouldn't do that. No Rolling Gentlemen. Never told you're not supposed to tell many squeezers in your life and you never tell me about these bags. I don't tell anyone. I don't think. I don't think that's a cool, you don't do that either. He was not cool.

Speaker 1:          00:01:24       What happens on the road stays on the road. It's what I'm talking about. But I'm talking about all of those swinging Dixie, you played around with any tech. So many decks. I'm, listen, I'm slow. I'm dehydrated. You're victorious though. I mean, you, you did it. Yeah. Tell you burnt came in today. Was it for people that don't know, we're, we're, we're recording this on Monday. I just did Joe Rogan's podcast with my buddy Brent Chrysler, and we've had this way in this weight loss challenge and today was the way in and the first of two. Yeah. At first it was gonna be a three day way and we just scratched. That's crazy talk. So we did two day weigh in. So we both came in today and he was like, you know, I ran like 20 miles yesterday and I did this today. You know, he's just being burned like pulsive and crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       Right. And Jane the last, yeah, yeah. Which is exactly how I predicted he would do because we've been thinking about this as, and as the weeks have come to a close and yeah, we were like, there's, he's probably Burt's not known for it. The slow and steady approach. I played the long game. He's more of a like, let's, let's crunch time, right? Yeah. Let's cram for the exam now. It's time to do it. Yeah. But he looked great for bird look great. You look amazing. Wow. So when he got there, I was like, do you think you why? He's like, I really think he was weighed myself today because I didn't want to freak myself out or beat. So he got there and I was like, what do you think it is? He's like, I think it's at the weight, the weight. We were trying to go for it to 27. Right. So he goes, I think I'm up to 27 and I go,

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       all right. I looked at him and I was like, I could see two 25 so I was like, I think he looks to 25 no. Explain why to 27 cause that's not just an article right now to 27 was the Bmi to get you out of obesity in into just overweight. Yes. Um, and we looked it up and 27 that was based on being six one I'm about a half an inch shorter than Bert. Technically we would then have different BMI is, but we both just agreed to do two 27 that was, now if one of us had stayed over to 27, that person's still in obesity. They'd lose the cause. The whole thing was to try to get out of obesity. Ari is now part of this and he's, he was like, instead of getting the call, he got the call instead of being congratulating, he was like, wait a minute, wait a minute. I started to like backpedal about basically not wanting to pay for

Speaker 4:          00:03:55       Ching on tender hooks. Here I was in the studio watching you guys on Joe rogan.live. Yeah. And I mean, I heard him, he, he picked up, he's in some other country.

Speaker 3:          00:04:05       Yeah, I don't worry. And he's like, oh, I want to see the scale. And I was like, back to our height. We're both well under. And he was like, so what I need. And then he told me, he was like, he's like, you're on the cusp. You need to not gain any weight. He told me that today. Um, so what, what happened was Burt weighed in first he was two 21. I was like gosh, which is really impressive. I'm really impressed. And I knew when I woke up today when I got on the scales first thing and I took a leak and I got on the skills, I was two 21 so I was like, all right, I know I can, I can, cause I went, I was sweating a little bit, you know, doing stuff this morning. So yeah, I suspected I would be around two 20 and I ended up being two 19.

Speaker 3:          00:04:55       Wow. I was just two pounds, which is not much but enough to hopefully, yeah. So now the thing is, and by the time this comes out it'll be over this whole thing. This is like the big election. Yeah. This is it man. This is scary. The nail biter. So we are now within a 24 hour window of the way and where we both want to win, we both need to come in at or lower than to like basically this is what has to happen. If we weighed the same tomorrow, it's over. I win if I weigh less tomorrow anyway, I win. Wow. If he weighs less, he has to be more than two pounds less than me.

Speaker 4:          00:05:35       So he has to out underway. You buy two and a half pounds to win tomorrow. Right. So your lead theoretically. Yeah. So you have to hold that lead.

Speaker 3:          00:05:45       Yeah. Wow.

Speaker 4:          00:05:47       I have full confidence in you. I, we know this is teams to girl all the way. Last night I shaved your back for you. Um, a lot of people on Instagram, they were crediting my back shaving for the weight loss for the weight loss because that's at least five or 10 ounces. If you look at the amount of hair in the shower. Sure. Um, do you have a strategy for today? I think the listeners are wanting to know.

Speaker 3:          00:06:10       This is my strategy will be, you know, uh, in like I said, it'll will be after the fact later. Sure. We'll know what happened tomorrow. But, um, you know, I, I talked to some people and um, it seems to be the best strategy is to eat some very small, uh, meals. You don't want to completely starve yourself.

Speaker 4:          00:06:30       Okay. And would those meals consist of pizza or chicken wings?

Speaker 3:          00:06:34       It is a, mostly, it's actually a chocolate and sausage diet is what it is. Okay. Um, so just a little piece. So it, you just have small portions, uh, something fatty. Like I've been having an avocado, um, little piece of chicken, little bit of spinach just to like kind of keeps something in your system. I'm going to be active, I'm going to do, um, but just cardio. I'm just some cardio work, um, sweat, you know, and then I'll do, I'll do a hot bath tonight. Get a little more sweat going. No more fluids down with fluids. The toughest part is the last couple hours. Hopefully I'll be, you know, I know I'll be fatigued. I'll be tired tonight. So you just want to be asleep, fall asleep. It's hard, you know, getting up in the morning and you want, you so much. Want to consume anything, anything. Yeah. So that'll be the hard part. And then I'll try to get another sweat going, especially the hour leading up to the way in. Wow. So I'll know like when we're done here, I'm going to go work out, I'm going to, you know, figure out my weight, I'll figure out how much of that, and I'll kind of have an idea how much is water weight and I'll know how much I need to sweat.

Speaker 4:          00:07:43       I'm really in awe of you. I mean, I have to say your discipline, your, uh, your dedication to the game has really been an inspiration to me. I don't think I've, I haven't seen you this laser focused and you know, you're focused about your work, obviously. I wouldn't say never, but I mean, you've lost so much weight since August, before this bet by the way. Like this is something that's been in the works with you for a long time and like a switch flipped. And I think you've just been like, you just been really good genes. I think we're all proud of you. Thanks. Jeans. I think it's been just like, you know, it's the same switch

Speaker 3:          00:08:20       flip the first time I lost weight, which was about 16, 17 years ago. Yeah. Um, there's sometimes you just go like, oh, I just want to do this. I don't like being, you know, this big and, you know, you just go, I'm going to, I'm just going to do something about it. You

Speaker 4:          00:08:34       know, it's, and it's 2017 I'm sure like so many people's new year's resolutions, it's to lose weight. And ever since I've been doing Paul [inaudible], he's now, I do it twice a week. I've just not long, it's only been what, a couple of months that I've been doing this and it really changes. It changed me already. Like, you know, I feel stronger. Yeah. But also like the discipline of just fucking

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       doing it. You know what? Fuck my brain. Fuck what my mind's telling me. I just do it and I don't think about it. And it's so, it's so gray, man. Not so great. I have the same, you know, by the way, a lot of people have asked, so I'll just tell them what I did. Um, you know, I got onto a oh, diet. The reason I did that is that, um, I actually, I didn't even know. It's funny that he's my buddy. I didn't know that, that Joe had been doing that. Yeah, apparently he talks about it. I had no idea on Instagram. He's always posting and veggies, no carb right away. I actually found out about it from Mike Kennedy, a different comedian and he sent me a link to it. And when I was reading it, I had read about other diets before and you know how people, obviously you try things and it seemed like I go, okay, this seems pretty doable.

Speaker 3:          00:09:46       And then I actually saw that, um, some athletes, we're proponents of it, you know, some, some like high perform, like a triathlon people. And I was like, oh, so these are people that you know, that no nutrition. Yeah. And then I saw that, you know, some of them hadn't. Their cholesterol goes down and you get to indulge in like, I like to indulge as an eater. You know, all the good stuff in Quito, you give up sweetness but you still get to adult yet you know, sugar. But you get to indulge in fats. So, so you feel fuller actually feel fuller. And if you're somebody that is like a, you know, a Foodie, you go, well that's a whole world of deliciousness still, you know. So for me it was like I get the satisfaction of eating that fatty food. It's not like nothing but fat butt, but it does, it is, you know, a higher fat diet and you know, you can read all about it and you know, some people are probably not into it some, but whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:10:42       I liked it. You learn things the whole time. The big thing, if you want to make some change to get started, I would say just cut your sugar once you reduce your sugar, you know, it's, it's, it's a game. Checks your body burns that sugar off before it will get to the fat. The reason, I mean, there's a lot of other reasons, but, but if you're eating a ton of sugar and then that's what your body's going to burn first. Yeah. And you're, you know, you get glucose spikes, you get your body just stores fat. It's, um, he's, you start gaining weight. And what Burt said today on on Rogan show, he's like, you just can't fucking eat. And I agree are a big proponent of that. Just stop fucking eating because the truth is even if you're doing this Kido and but you're eating a five pound steak. Yeah, you can't do that hammer, you know, doing all the veggies. If you're caloric intake is still one thing you're going to be fucking fat still. You learn, you know is um, portions matter and also Keto teaches you to reduce your protein intake. A lot of people think that you can just eat as much protein as you want, but excess protein causes that glucose spike to them. And so, you know, I was somebody that eat enormous

Speaker 4:          00:11:55       portions are big now. So basically it's a little bit of protein with some fat to keep you going and then you get your carbs from vegetables, veggies. Yeah. Great. No, no sugar, no pastries doable. If I'm telling you I've been doing it, no fat milk, if you're going to have actually a little bit of found out I was doing really heavy. Creamer is best, like have you, and then you dilute that a little bit. But, um, whole milk has sugar in it. Oh, right, right, right. I mean, I was using a splash, but still the thing is you're learn, you learn as you with anything. You're like, oh, I was doing that part wrong. And then you just make your change. Most importantly, how have your dump spin on this new diet? I better. Much better. Yeah. I mean like I'm eating less food and eating a more, you know, clean way and I've had very healthy dumps.

Speaker 4:          00:12:43       That's wonderful. Because they were very explosive. Yeah. And we were, we were troubled. Now you gave up sugar, which for you was, I mean, you're the, you were the guy who we passed by a shop and if there was a chocolate croissant insight, it was in your gullet quick. Yeah. And that you loved pastries. That's true. A lot of them. So how did you tell me about that process? I mean, that, you know, the hardest part was the first 72 hours. Um, yeah. I was telling him today that we went to that podcast and you're like, just don't cause I was snapping at people. You were out of here with sugar? With crane. Yeah. I know. I didn't know what was going on. I mean before I made the decision, just that like doing it. So I think it was, it was more about the choice.

Speaker 4:          00:13:29       I was like, I'm just doing this and then just going for it. It came to the point now that like I don't, I don't go, Oh man, I wish I could have that chocolate croissant and just go like that's not for me. Cause I think he realized too, at least what I've, because I've lost a few pounds to start out with. Polite but otherwise diary, proud of your job. You're a polite, you've been dedicated. Yeah. I've never seen you dedicated to fitness. Never. Cause I hate it and I still hate it. It's not that I enjoy exercising, it's that I have to, because I'm 40 years old and this is it for me. Like I can't do the second half of my life out of shape. I refuse to hate myself because I don't like my body. I haven't liked my body since I was 17 years old and I'm sick and tired of it.

Speaker 4:          00:14:09       All right. Thank you. Um, both the fuck. I don't even know what the fuck I was gonna say. I Dunno. The Oh, the Diet stuff. Yeah. Oh, there is a point where you start to go is the chocolate croissant is the joy, the momentary joy of the chocolate croissant going to make me happier in the long run. Meaning tomorrow when I step on the scale and I know I fucked myself out of today's diet, is that, is that going to it long term? Is this really gonna work out for you? Start to think, think like that. You also go, what? What are you doing? If you've had some results? Yeah. Then you go, do I want to fuck these what I've been doing, I want to go backwards and gain it and then try to go. I know, cause you don't, you don't and it's not worth the temporary.

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       Yeah. You ever heard that saying Kate Moss? She goes, nothing tastes as good as skinny. Feels it's true and I've, I've always remembered that when I'm around like, should I, oh, I want to cheat the galleys pastries lying around this, this Christmas I maintained, I didn't lose, I just stayed the same weight, which is like a fucking miracle with all the shit we had lying around. But I would always think Kate Moss, nothing tastes as good as skinny feels right. It feels good. Yeah. You should be proud. You know, you look better so much better and you're looking in the mirror and you're like, this is way better. You don't have to flog yourself anymore for being a fat fuck. You don't have to hate yourself every time you go shopping. Right. I heard you guys talking about that today on the show to where Burt was like, oh, you don't have a size 40 at the gap or wherever.

Speaker 4:          00:15:39       Like, and that's not that big really. I mean, no one would really be able to tell. I'm a bit of a Fashionista. I like clothes and it's a bummer to me. It's a bummer to me. Like when I'm, um, when you go into a store, like I just know, see a cool shirt doesn't fit, doesn't fit. I know you have another size, bigger size. We have, it's the worst. When I first had Ellis, I was, I weighed in at two oh eight when we, when we went to the hospital to deliver hand. We're fully pregnant though. No, but I'm saying as a woman, I've never weighed 200 and I know, yes, I know that's baby. Yes, that's fluid somewhat. But it's a lot of that is fat. How much do you, do you weigh? Do you know what you weigh right afterwards? Like when you leave the hospital?

Speaker 4:          00:16:28       I would say half of that was actual what baby water with hormonal, they don't weigh on the way out. So you don't know. But I know when I got home I was a size 12 and that's the biggest I've ever known. What was the next time you weighed yourself? I didn't, I didn't look at the scale for months until we moved out of Redondo because I just knew that to start on that journey would really, you know, you gotta be ready to start losing weight before you do that after a baby. You shouldn't be flogging yourself over your weight after you have a kid. But I remember being really big for the first time in my life and really not liking how that felt terrible. All the shit looks terrible on me. Everything looks bad. It sucks, man. Terrible. But you know what I did though is I would buy nice clothes at, at the appropriate size.

Speaker 4:          00:17:17       So then you go, okay, I'm going to surrender to this. By the way, I did that. You know, I, um, I bought a lot of Nice clothes. That's enormous. Right? You know, just because I was like, dude, I'm not gonna not have clothes and you're not going to flog yourself every day when you're in the process of, of getting in shape or losing weight. Like if that's not worth it either to be like, fuck, fuck me, I'm so ugly. I'm just going to wear the same thing. Like, no, dude. You know what I do? I bought new clothes. I know you're a smaller size now. I'm about to have to get the, uh, the next size down for the past. So exciting genes. Congratulations. Yeah, it's good. Um, you know, I definitely, like I said today, I'm not trying to be dramatic about it. I think I just want to live more like this, you know, like I don't have a really goal number.

Speaker 4:          00:18:05       It's not really about the number, isn't it? No, it's not really what looks you get married to the number, but no, I just go, like right now I go, I could lose another, you know, I don't think it's a big deal. Well, the number's good because then you can be like, I got to weigh myself to see how, because you don't know how fat you're getting. Yeah. Unless you have that number number yet. Fucking, but I'm saying like, I go, I look at the number and I'm like, all right, like, and I see where I'm at, I see how I feel. And I go, well, you know, if I lost another, yeah. You know, I don't think losing another 15 is a big deal now for boys. I feel like men, you guys, all you have to do is stop drinking soda. I know. Like I lost 20 pounds. Oh, women. Our body holds on to fat. Yeah. Because we need it for like getting periods. Yeah. Making babies. The baby baby. They want our body. We're mammals. Shit. Oh, I hooked the old board up, so we have to, oh, sweet.

Speaker 5:          00:18:58       Megan and I have been together for nearly three years. She's a beautiful girl who I am very much in love with and I have a lot in common with. I can't wait to get home and jumping in a pool. That guys

Speaker 4:          00:19:22       Yeah. Keep it to yourself. Ah, thank God. All the heads. Yeah, I'm proud. Uh, now I'm stoked to come out of the [inaudible] crazy man. So this is kind of big. I'm going to fluid bond with Jesse. Yes, yes. Oh, I love it. Happy. It's bad. I'm going to fluid bonded with Jessica. Jessica, I'm on the blue and bond boy. So today Burke, I'm Rogan was like, yeah, I don't know if you noticed, but when Tom and Kristin near the, they're like the biggest assholes everywhere. I know. I felt bad. I was like, you got home. And I'm like, oh my God, I hope I wasn't too mean to Bert. I mean I w you know, we're just talking shit and I do. God bless Sam. I do is really be serious. And yeah, I know. Hurt him and love him. So of course everyone loves Burt and I texted them both Burnley on. They haven't responded yet, so no, you hurt their feelings.

Speaker 5:          00:20:17       That's what the, I had the bubble NAM case. I went inside the land of the man wants to go inside. If he can win. Couldn't do it man. But I did. I said I could do it and I can imagine that as the glitz man.

Speaker 4:          00:20:34       Oh, he's tacking, he might be mentally ill a little. I had a window. I don't know. That was kind of manic, wasn't it? I'm on the fence. Yeah. It seems a little manic to me a little bit. It's like this

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       don't drugs. Yeah. Flip it comes on your legs this way. Yeah. Go and they really poor raven. It's let's just like you like, yeah. You like I said Hey. Yeah. What does he do for a living? I think he does music now. He was an actor. Maybe. I don't know that. It's so tacky to share. Yeah. Yeah. You shouldn't share. No. Okay. You're lucky she lets you eat her pussy. You dumb. Fuck. Yeah. Right? Yeah. You don't talk. Don't brag about that shit. God Damn, that's not cool. Tacky.

Speaker 3:          00:21:32       There is. Um, whereas this cheat sheet, there's this thing I've been wanting to show you. I didn't realize this was the, it's so fucking great. So, you know, we've been talking about my dad and then other people. Do Dad accents foreigners? Yes. So, and basically what we're talking about is like when my dad is around, my mother talks normal, but when her family comes from Peru, he adopts a English, but he has a little bit of a Spanish accent and people have written in with stories about it. Absolutely is my favorite thing. So like you know, someone wrote in that their dad works or go, they go to an Asian restaurant and he starts talking to the waitress. I'm in English but like it with an Asian downtime and some berries. It's so embarrassing. So apparently this is what this is here. Okay. Joey Barton is an Irish soccer player who played a season for a French team and he developed the Dad Accent Syndrome during a press conference and then the sports talk show back at home, can't wait to ask him about it. So they recognized that he was doing that. Um, and this is just fucking amazing. Yes. You mentioned that last there. How's your French got any better? Yeah, a little bit. Lvst without, you've got to policy.

Speaker 1:          00:22:56       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:22:57       So they're setting them up and that's how he talks, obviously. Right. Because you can hear his, um, his, his notable Irish accent. Yes. And then this is him doing a press conference with the French Press.

Speaker 1:          00:23:13       Lindsay Lohan.

Speaker 3:          00:23:15       Well, in France, uh, speak about this. It's, it's, it's normal in England and, um, maybe it takes me one or two game to adapt or it's not a problem. The one criticism of the French league is it's, it's a little bit, uh, you know, they, and I can understand, you know, I watch a Neil yesterday, they have 10 men and they're happy to lose one nil. Uh, you know, they, they have 10 men and for me you might as well, five nil is one nil.

Speaker 1:          00:23:51       That's how he taught, right? Yeah. And he's like, yeah, he sounds like a Gallagher brother.

Speaker 3:          00:23:55       Perfect. [inaudible] you could get you a job on a lower low. Gotcha. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:03       What's her Louella happened?

Speaker 3:          00:24:05       Oh, no. Clearly what you're trying to do is you're trying to speak in a pattern that the the European, the front of Janis Lansdowne, I get that. But we will make some stairs. Yeah. I'm embarrassed. Embarrassed. I oversee and man, I'm doing a conference. So it's full of French journalists. No, no foreign journalists really in the room and off seat. And I can not blow for him. And a really good parliament. Taxi was sitting in the, in the bar and I'm talking away and I'd said before the went there, cause I remember Steve McClaren's famous one nice to rib Steve about was anything like it. So I was talking about not doing that when it went out in my mind not to do it. So anyway, I'm doing this conference and I see two ads in the bucket and it just dawned on me that my worst nightmare mostly doing this ridiculous Fran Jackson. I've done that. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:24:50       Thing where I've thought about something I don't like in my act. Yeah, no, don't do that. And then I'll do it immediately. Do it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:24:59       So then I'll stop like playing on it to try and get, I mean, both of them would in floods of tears and end the often to Warhol at the conference have gone and the French were just stone syslog and bow hunting. He did not have any idea what was going on. Even afterwards when it broke, it went viral and everyone was actually giving me a, a bit of a Mickey taken rightly so. Um, the French wine, what we understood you needed to speak slowly and I was like, yeah, Wayne, just dad.

Speaker 1:          00:25:33       It is yourself when you make yourself look bigger. Big Idiot like that. It's also, he's a good, it's good. It's good in a sense of humor. She really is cool as shit, by the way. I really liked the student. Yeah, but why don't you fucking suck? Oh God, I wish I could suck it. Uh, what's her name? Did that Lindsay Lohan? Yes. She remember, that's the first instance that we saw where she was like, and uh, it's a wonderful thing and this country is like, what

Speaker 3:          00:25:57       my dad goes, uh, uh, uh, we teach you a, you enjoy yourself today is nice. No. All the people there and then was like, ah, yes. It deal. Tony's very nice. Is that the people doing the yes. Uh, uh, uh, and I, we, we go many times we've met Betty

Speaker 1:          00:26:18       joy. They actually, I think he's right. This guy that like, they think you're just kind of slowing it down. Yeah. They don't realize what you're doing either. Yeah. No, I think my dad does that to Spanish speakers too. He does. Yeah. A little bit.

Speaker 1:          00:26:35       I'd love to do a road trip with your dad. Go for it to see how he manages things, you know. Yup. Yup. Yup. You can him. Um, I love how European dudes sit with their legs crossed. I forgot that I cross him sometimes. My Dad does too. I feel like, no, you don't. Not like that guy had it. No, I usually do the, the the big fold. Yeah. But there's sometimes you're just like, I dunno, just depends on, it's like the seating dictates it. I had a full lady lady cross. Yeah. Europeans do that. They're smaller. Right? We're so fat. Right. Americans are too fat to do the The lady cross you can't do late across big old fat fucks come to America. And the, yes. Yes. And uh, so when did you have a good time? When I'm least at the thing today.

Speaker 1:          00:27:30       We had such a good time with them. I miss them. That was fun, man. I talked to top talk today. He's on the weight loss. Kicked to AC. Now you guys had a little thing going. We have a bet, right? Yeah. Well what is it? He has to get down to a certain way. He weighs less than me. He's just for reference. But um, he does. Oh yeah. See, it's so funny. I don't, I can't tell, I mean right now he might be a little more than me, but his baseline weight is way less than my baseline. Interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:28:02       So, um, anyways, if, uh, if he gets to the goal weight, I have to go with him on a fucking cruise, a four day cruise, worst I hate Cruz is way worse. Or is it the cruise or the four dayness of it. God dammit now and on one hand a four day cruise, you're in, you're out. I don't want, I fucking hate cruises, but I also want them to get through a full choir. So anyways, if I win, if you don't, we're not when, but if he doesn't, we have to do a trip that I want to do. So I just tried to make it something that he doesn't want to do. Vietnam couldn't do that to him. He wouldn't even take that seriously. I said Brazil, which I would love to go, I'm dying to go to, but he said he was like, he's like, I don't want to go to Brazil.

Speaker 1:          00:28:50       And I was like, exactly. It's hot. It's muggy. Actually, if he does it, who is spicy, I think I'll just let them, I'll let them go somewhere else. But like I tell him that he hears the beauty of your father is that no matter where you take him, all he's going to want to do is sit in the hotel room and watch Turner classic movies. That's all he wants to do. So why even make him travel? Doesn't matter where you go. The only place he wants to go abroad is England has never been. And I think even then he would be like, oh, this is going to see this thing. And we'd go see fucking big Ben or something and then gonna go back to the room buddy. And He'd be like, oh, I mean we just got out here. So I do want to go, you know, whatever Buckingham. Yeah, it big. This is big. Ready again when I get something to eat.

Speaker 4:          00:29:45       The thing is, I think he thinks England is just America with funny accents. They might, I think he does. I don't think he understands that it's Europe. It's not that the doorways are narrower, everything's small.

Speaker 1:          00:29:58       He's reached such an incredible level of repeating himself. Like he was telling me that his brother lost a bunch of weight. Right. Which one? Steve [inaudible] the one that's alive rock by and then the, um, the one that's alive. Yeah. I'm sorry. I thought he had more than no too, for some reason though. So, okay. He goes, I'm Steve lost a bunch of weight. I go, that's great man. We'll see. Wasn't ever that big. And I go, how'd you do that? And he's like, you know, anything is, he did it the old fashioned way, you know, count calories and uh, you know, just kinda did it like that. And I go, Yup. Since he told me that story, he has told me that story 10 more times and every time he says it, I know you already told me this. I know. I just, I like to repeat myself. He just does that. He learned, he owns that. He just likes to repeat himself. Same thing with the retirement on the horizon because, and I can retire. It's a, you know, just holding mentality, getting ready for a retirement and uh, you know, we all the whole different thing, you know, it's just the next chapter. I'm like, Yup, I indulge it the first couple times like oh yeah, and the next 25 times I talked to him, you know, retirement and we had a mentality like that. I know you've already fucking said this.

Speaker 4:          00:31:23       It's so funny. Yeah. You know, it's cute. He goes, I got my calorie counting book. It tells you how many calories, which is funny cause there's like, there's a calorie counting book on this thing called the road back to you. Who Was it? No, it's a calendar reminder.

Speaker 1:          00:31:38       Oh, I'm thirsty. I know. I'm sorry. Sorry. Can you drink a little or no, I'm just going to, there's a sip. I'm just going to cut.

Speaker 4:          00:31:50       Are you being serious? Yeah. You're not gonna drink it all on his whole tomorrow.

Speaker 1:          00:31:53       Yeah. Not until 1130. I is that safe? Probably not. Because you drank a little. Please write on the way out of here. Oh, right. Yeah. Just have a sip of my water. Seriously. You want it right now? Okay. You want to have an orange? Oh God. Oh yeah. Um, so a bunch of people have sent in a mommy and jeans.

Speaker 4:          00:32:20       So excited about this movement. I really am. I think of all the things we've done, this is definitely one of my favorites. Yeah. Let me see. Is this, do you want to play what we've been working on? Sure. How that's influenced?

In other words, they're like, we're helping, right? So like, yeah, I'm just, I'm doing the trying to teach right now. Another thing, you know, I don't know why there's this assumption that all female sexuality is identical. Like, you know, women, you guys are all about your feelings for, and like, I know a lot of women who are hardcore horse thugs bitches who don't give a fuck about feelings. I know girls who fuck harder than dudes that, you know what I'm saying? Like their numbers are crazier than, dude, this is bullshit. Like, come on now. Really? You're trying to tell me this guy, he got to rub around her. You know how aggravating that is to a woman, by the way, when a, when a fucking dude rubs around your pussy like, no dude, get in there bro. Listen to you. I speak for a fucking, you know how many days like this I'm banging his hands as opposed to hand. It's frustrating when guys do all this. Oh, I have to be extra special because no, you don't just fucking touch it. Bitch

Speaker 10:         00:49:52       tells me, Oh no, I'm at the gate of your temple.

Speaker 4:          00:50:10       No Shit. Dummy. Yeah. Okay. Then what? You'll love this part,

Speaker 4:          00:50:30       Okay.

Speaker 10:         00:50:31       And as all of you will have some food, the certain areas of potential at the cheese ball, peaceful, the casebook presence, loving and one person's a painting at Hillcrest south reading yet and then the, the emotions accelerate and it is quite a beautiful, amazing activation.

Speaker 4:          00:50:55       Oh my God, no activation was the word of the day on sesame street. That's what this reminded me of when he said Shit activator activator, this guy. And I got to tell you that to his credit, if he didn't have on his h and m necklace and his ridiculous belt, he's just some fucking mediocre looking guy with a button on his head who would never be able to get the twin goddess activation. So you know what? He's figured shit out on him. I just feel like definitely a book, you know, Bullshit. Did God bless as they say, sign off the good. Good job, sir. What kind of check is, I'm drawn to the the button guy would. Yeah. And that too, because I liked her goddess, all that stuff. You know me like I like, I like spiritual. No, and that's a thing, but my bullshit radar goes, no.

Speaker 4:          00:51:51       Now my bullshit detector knows that this guy's full of it. No, I know. I know. It's not real. Ladies. Listen, couple of chicks shoot him down like that and then a couple are like this and then all of a sudden, I bet you if you ask them, how many threesomes have you had is he's like, I don't know, 500 he what he does, he goes, he's self help groups. He goes to meeting groups and like energy goes after people seeking it, which is smart. Yeah. He's like, oh his lane, he's a predator. He's like a Hyena.
