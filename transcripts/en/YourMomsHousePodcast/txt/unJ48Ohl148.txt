But what happened is, uh, the club is moving down the street still. Embrya it's still on the same block, but they're moving to a much bigger space.

Excited voice. But um, yeah, today's going to be fun. We had a lot to get into. First of all, can we get into the your jacket? Yeah. What's up? First of all, are you Ukrainian? Are you Sullivanian? Are You Hungarian? Like what? What's the look you're going for is all that Slavic? I'm a dope producer. Yo. You know what I'm saying? This is so my tribe right now, I'm really feeling it. Maybe, I don't know. I feel like it's just, you know, up folk came through through me up motherfucking dope jacket and I've put it on what's the flag of what a former rush Soviet countries that, I don't know what that is.

Speaker 4:          00:05:24       Which satellite country. I think I saw a Dominican guy wearing it. I was like, where'd you get that? It's pretty dove though. Yeah, I like it. I mean it's definitely loud and makes a lot of statements. No word on a plane. People we're definitely noticing. Yeah. Jesus guy. If you wore that to Hungary and Matt, like my relatives and friends, they'd be like that. That's a good jacket. This is nice. This is good stuff here. No good. Jagat you leave that behind. Maybe you're like house music. Absolutely. Like house music to, uh, I remember when I worked with a German and she was like, how come nobody likes house music? And I was like, I don't know. It's not 1994 talking about we're Americans. And then she was like, once it was dancing, this playground, house music, good luck. Take that foreign shit out man. When I was in Madrid for a semester, every, every club like the UK, uh, Hungary to booming everywhere. The UK, they love that Shit.

Speaker 5:          00:06:33       It,

Speaker 4:          00:06:35       it was good. I know that never really took off here though. Something about that sensibility is not, I dunno, it's not, it's not as like they're, it feels ma that's mainstream. That's what people are into. If you're young, if you're cool, that's what you like. And here it wasn't like that. Now it's too, I don't know. But then again, we liked that club music. People like, you know, people would do drugs and they raves and stuff like that was cool, but I don't know how I'm at attach. What do I know? I know. I don't know anything. We're, um, we're, we're basically lost on our television shows. You know what's so funny is that as we're sitting here recording now, all I can think about, it's like when can we go back upstairs and put the TV on and finish where we left off? I know there's so many good shows we're into right now.

Speaker 4:          00:07:23       Well, here's what happens is we dry up, the well dries up and then I find the TLC APP. What happens is the well dries up on really amazing award winning television. Other words, scripted mega shows that are phenomenal, like coming to an end on the Americans set that were kind of talking on the marriage. He never got into the Americans. You want to deep dive, you'll have six seasons. So good. Uh, we're watching Handmaid's tale tale is really picking up a thank God. There's finally hope. I was about to commit suicide a couple episodes back. So now we're, we're having some help and I'm stoked. We're really, really fired up. It's, it's good. It's, I mean, this, this last ending was just like Bam. I love that. I kind of reminds me of when one of those shows where you go, well, all, I don't want to give it away, but it's like when you're watching one of the amazing, like a breaking bad and something central that you're used to changes, all of a sudden you're like, I going to go from here.

Speaker 4:          00:08:22       I Know Sopranos, like a character's just out of the picture. You're like, what? What's going to happen now? They just really fucked shit up. Um, I'm super excited for hand jobs help. But anyways, we get, we run through these shows and so then you're great at finding the filler shows, the um, the outliers, the marginalized shows. We'll tip our hat and just tell the network Tlc, you have really outdone yourself. If you have an apple TV, I recommend just going and getting the TLC APP and just scrolling their reality reality lineup. There's like, it's a joke. It's a fucking joke, but it's so good that dwarves, it's called big and little big and little. That's about fat dwarves dwarves, which I heard I fell asleep. But you said it wasn't as funny as we know. It was way, way more depressing than I thought it would be. See, that's the problem with Tlc is they get you, they get the empathy. Yeah. Like I don't want to be empathetic. I want to laugh. I want to enjoy my fat dwarves, you know, and then you got me feeling for them like Oh my God dammit. And then there was a, yeah there's, they have a whole bunch of fat stuff like that. I lost all the fat and now my skin hangs off me. It's called like skin tight on that one. And that was depressing too. It's also hard to watch.

Speaker 4:          00:09:44       And then there's a satin alive fat and Catlin that family and yeah, just all kinds of fat shit. Yeah. And then they have a lot of gender stuff, you know, I don't watch that cause I feel bad it's a little kid. But then there's one now that we are really deep into called lost in transition and I know it is so captivating. The premises, there are married couples that had been married for a while. I mean we're talking anywhere from like eight to sometimes 30 years. Multiple children, established relationships, children for most. And in each of these marriages the man has told the woman did he wants to transition to a woman. And I mean you are really, it is like jumping into a household and seeing the biggest bomb drop in a relationship. You're, you're literally getting to peek in to a private life and seeing somebody go, I am going to blow up what we have been used to for three decades and thing is the interesting part is that the trans part isn't that interesting to me anymore because I feel like we've seen so many shows and we're kind of, we have a better understanding of that.

Speaker 4:          00:11:12       The reactions, the way people handle it. It's the emotional drama. That's calculus and there's this one couple, they've been married 24 years. They have three children or four, which, which won the Ohio woman who's like just the most, they have to come off her whole dream in life. The one that's married to my dad basically. Yeah. The husband is like, he's got a belly, he's got the traditional bald, like horseshoe. He just looks like one of my dad's golfing friends. Never going to be a good looking woman. It's that guy, probably not. And he's just like, ah. And he's so happy that it's that he's told her back it up. No, the bagging of the best

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       part is that she is like, I mean, all I ever wanted in life was to get married and have children and have a house and go to the hobby lobby on Saturday. Like her, she's very simple. Yeah. All she wanted out of life was the house, the husband, like the lionfish paddling and she did the life that she wanted. She's living the life that she wanted, but he drops it on her one night. She's like, and then, and then you see, you see real, I mean, devastation that, not that he's doing it. It's that life is now not, it's changing. And so then they're like, what are they going to do? Like what? We're going to get divorced and get separate places. He is like flipping pancakes. And he's like, we sure are. And he's like cleaning up, cleaning up shit in the garage. And he's like, I cannot fucking wait for you.

Speaker 3:          00:12:47       And they're sitting there in this interview and, uh, he's like, he's like, you know, it was so hard to tell her. He's like, but you know, here I was my whole life, you know, my wedding day and the birth of our children and I was just so devastated and miserable guess cause he knew that he was trans from day from why they got married and he just couldn't come out and he couldn't say anything and he was like, I was so devastated. And I'm like, Oh God, I'm so miserable. And she was like, that's so hurtful to hear dates. What? Like she's clearly like, wait a minute. Those are the best days of my life. The birth of our children are, oh no, no, not mine. It's not mine. The best part is that, like you said, he's one, he's flipping the pancakes and she's like, I've never been on my own before.

Speaker 3:          00:13:35       And he's like, Yep, it's going to be tight. Not a lot of money. Yeah. I don't even know how to balance my checkbook a separate place. So he's like, the budget really going to be tight so you're not the not splurge anyway. I'm going to go out so great. He doesn't give a fuck. I think he's so relieved to come out. I mean you could tell the way it is off of off of them. And then there's this other woman who's this really educated like engineer and she's in her fifties and um, and she doesn't understand. She doesn't get it at all. He's just gay and it's a choice. No, she thinks he's like, I want to go to Cabo. You can't, we can't do it. She's like, do you understand if you do this, it'll fuck shit up between us. And he's like, yeah, do you understand that?

Speaker 3:          00:14:24       She's like, you're so selfish. No, really doesn't comprehend that. It's like a brain thing and he really does need to do this to feel whole. He doesn't, she doesn't get it. No, but actually that's kind of fascinating to watch, to be back to it because you know that everybody, not everybody, but that, that generation probably empathizes like shares her set point of view that it's kind of voluntary maybe. Well it's generational. Probably be like, yeah, these guys choosing to be a warmer, come on by the, or now you're choosing it. They just don't have like the same empathy and understanding. So to watch her spiral has just been fantastic too. Um, and then her friend comes over who is like the know it all and who's intervening in their marriage and you're like, bitch, why are you, are you meeting or anything? And she's like, I am not a lesbian.

Speaker 3:          00:15:13       I don't like, I'm not gay. Cause then she's really out of it. I'll be living with a woman then and I don't like women like that. She keeps saying that over. She likes penises and this isn't the house. It's so great. What a great show. Great show. Kind of wonder what, what, what would you do? Fucking I would, I would have to be committed like I love, but I, you know, cause I really do think about this seriously. Not We watching like I love you so much that I would stand by you clearly and I'd be like, okay, well we'll transition you and you can live with us and braise our kids. But like I may have to have a boyfriend, I may have to step out. Well we can't do it anymore. You're not a man, you'll, you're gonna transition and you're probably not going to be very attractive as a woman. Let's face it. It's also very hurtful. You're going to be the ugliest woman that dial it back a little. No, I'm serious. You're not meant to be a woman. Like your shoulders are too broad. You have so much hair. Could you imagine, although the hormones will make the hair fall out, I think,

Speaker 4:          00:16:17       I think that that'd be a pretty cute, you'd be horrendous as a woman. What would you do if I was like, I'm a man. Oh, I'd be so into it. That would be, it would be, I think I, I love you like that to where I'd be like, we have that spare room and that can be yours. And uh, you know, if you start lifting, we can start sharing clothes

Speaker 3:          00:16:42       and then you can get your second Dalmatian wife like you want. Oh my God. Can you imagine her and you and me living together how the fuck would be, can I say something? I kind of would just to, for the sake of the family and be like, I'll just raise our kids. And what would have the kids call Dalmatian though? Just by her first name. Just what are they going to call me? They'll be like, Daddy, daddy and Daddy.

Speaker 4:          00:16:59       Yeah. Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, daddy and Jenny now that, so he's a boy is so you, me, misty. She wouldn't be named Jenny. Boring. Yeah. Misty Crystal Shandy. Be Mommy to him for a while and he'd be, it'd be hard to break it for him. He's so young. Or maybe he would start calling. We did. We just have him call you your new name. What would be your dude name?

Speaker 3:          00:17:23       Um, that's tough. It's so hard to choose. I choose like a regular name when

Speaker 4:          00:17:27       that, when the one woman, the, the lady who's not ready for it, who's older and goes, so do you have a name? Like a woman's name that you've always wanted so much contempt. He was like, yeah. She was like, what is it? He was like, Lucy from, I love Lucy. I love that show. And she goes, I fucking hate that name. It's a stupid name. Suzanne. Cool about

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       it. And then there's other, they've been together for 14 years now. They're the ones that for kids. Yeah. And they live in a cul de sac where everybody knows everyone's business and she's really trying to hold it together with him, even though he's transitioning. And you can tell she's just eating those feelings. Like she's getting fatter,

Speaker 4:          00:18:06       fatter every year. I have a special treat for you that I want to get all before I guess arrives. Sure. So for people who may have missed last week, so a Christina is taping another Netflix special called the degenerates. Yes. Uh, Joey Diaz is doing it, at least a Trager trigger. And that's her name. Yes. Jay Oakerson, Brad Williams. Williams. I'm forgetting somebody else, but one other woman who I don't know. Um, but anyway, it's a great lineup. It's in Las Vegas. You had been, you know, running your material, getting ready for it. I thought as a gift, um, because you're my wife that, uh, I could just go ahead and throw out there some joke ideas. She's four years. So what I wanted to do was create this moment where we have you run this material right now, cold. You don't know what it is. I just wrote it for you and uh, you just read it and like fucking serious, right? Yeah. Yeah. You wrote something for me? Yeah. Isn't that nice? I already know what it is. Just don't know. I don't even say I was saying like, I think it's not going to guess it's, I think it's helpful. Okay. Um, and the, you know, it's a spouse trying to help a spouse. So I'll go ahead and play the MC and then you go ahead and do the bit. Okay. And fully commit. Please clarify. All right. And coming to the stage. Now Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for Christina. P. Yeah.

Just like that was exactly like that. Except we're going to shoot him a fucking needle. I bring load of beer. Plosive yeah. What is your anxiety? I don't know. On a scale of one to 10 about an eight, what are the first things, I guess we'll get this out of the way. Somebody emailed and they wanted us to wait. Let me just first say how happy I am to be here. Good to see you guys. And I and I, last time I was a little disoriented and it took me a while to figure out what the hell was going on. But now I feel like I, you know, I know you guys better and I've been out of your house. I've used your tushy toilet seat.

Speaker 8:          00:27:05       Did you use it, use it or are you just, I just, it'd be held. Behold the tushy toilets. I mean the name just south of La. I got a new one. We're actually swapping it out. The new one gets said we've got to get curls dinner together. I know we did since we last ride day, we've got to get crawl over here to test these things because he says, you know, cleaning his mass is like trying to take peanut butter out of shag carpet. Yeah. And so, so this would be, this could be really important for him. It's very much like that. Go with it. And have you tried it before? I've used those before. Yes. I've, I use the what's now the London and New York used to be the, I forget what it's called, but it was it sort of a Japanese own thing and the right and you know we got into these because we rented a house for a year from Japanese. They figured this stuff out. She had the toto washlet but she had it hooked up in her house. It sounds like it's up to a generator. It's so effected us that when we bought this house we immediately were like, day one. We need to go back and tell him. I'm just imagining, here you go. You got a lot of stuff going on up here. Yeah, it's a lot going on again to quote Corolla, it's like trying to find Santa Claus. His mouth down there. He's been asking me to eat his scrum,

Speaker 10:         00:28:36       her

Speaker 8:          00:28:42       to make out with my butthole, you know, and like Bay Bay that with her tongue. Well you know it's going to be clean because you've had the tushy thing. Can we wait till she's not practicing something very weird. I mean I worry about what the holdup is. I could make a case. You're ready against it, please. Is the case is that, you know, we got a homeless problem here in Los Angeles and there's a lot of them saying to ask a homeless person to do a lot of fecal contamination of our water and that oral fecal transmission of disease, it can be really problematic for a pregnant lady. And so if you just happen to go buy one of those encampments and volatilized Norovirus, get into your nasal passage, that stuff's going to be, I stay away from those places. I understand that. I just thought it, but that's one of the arguments against it.

Speaker 8:          00:29:29       Well, that's the only accurate I can think of. Otherwise I just worry about pregnant women. I just don't want them to go once she wants to. She delivered game on. Thank you doctor [inaudible] especially with your devices. I mean, what do you got to worry about? I'll just do it like the squat and sit and get it over kind of quick. You don't know where she lies on her back over her squat down on her face. Weird. What about antiseptic, sir? You're only watering your be whole still fills the Clorox wipes or something. You know rocks. Why? But he's willing to do it for you. My Dad wipes with those Clorox wipes, double kill everything. Well, he said, I don't have any bottle age now, so no cost to me now and nobody, somebody calls out your theory. Which one? I'm going to show it to you.

Speaker 8:          00:30:23       Okay, let's do it. Gosh. Uh, hey dog hunts. The episode of Dr Drew May have been one of the best I ever heard on your mom's house. However, I do feel that doctor drew did make one egregious claim weight. I couldn't sit back and accept. Yeah, absolutely. Pushes out the farts inspired by his hot take and the claim by my beloved girlfriend Jean, that I may fart too much. I set out on a personal case study to inspect my own farming habits. Even pregnant. You're still good with this gesture on supposed to make you want to vomit. Good. The best part is that we're asking a man who so overqualified. I know.

Speaker 8:          00:31:03       Well, listen to what this guy said. He goes after farts never gets old when you're a boy, a man. After keeping a detailed daily journal for over three weeks, a fart counts and patterns. I found an introspective study into your fire and Brown habits can be quite light. Oh, that's interesting. First I found that I fart about 17 times a day, which by many standards is above a little bit. Yeah, it feels good to be above average at something. Even if this means I may be more statistically likely to clear you to actually deliver. Right now you're going 17 healthy movement. Second, I found after a fudge baby birth, my farts were relatively dormant and less agitated by food or another brown. In my findings, a looming brown was always good for several warning blast until the log was dropped and subsequently cut by my urine and conclusion. I can say with confidence, poop does push the farts out. When you're pushing poops out, farts get pushed out to, come on now. Talk me up. I mean, this is Billie Jean who wrote in for that. It's got to be true. But I mean this is a great advancement in the world of scientific clinical observation. And I'm so grateful I, you know, I, maybe I didn't get into it deep enough last time. Where'd it go further? Which is that everybody's a little different when it comes to their farts. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:32:34       I mean we're having a serious conversation is the best thing. Just bodily form have somebody so cool. So here's the deal. Some of it is from swallowed air, right? Some people are very prone to that. They swallow that area. It really gets through. But there's other people that it's the bacterial gas production than I tragedies splitting of nitrogen by the bacteria in the colon. And that's what gives the smell and but also at some people produce the gas too. So some people, it's what they eat. And with the bacterial Sorta, the colonic sort of bacterial flora is doing right and what that, what that floor is doing. I can it be effected by bulk and stuff. He had a lot of good bulk in your diet. You might be sort of quieting things down a little bit. But if you're balanced, stirred, and even at the right locations, fiber, farmers, citrucel, metamucil, stuff like that issue and that you gotta keep well now with all that in your body and your abdomen, don't you have to keep things kind of vegetables for a praying lady?

Speaker 8:          00:33:34       I take amazing. Is it time for me then you have to get harassed. Burt before you eat yours. I've done it. I've done it. Okay, that's good. It's a lot cleaner and as a man we really don't. We sorta like, okay, let's go. Let's go. What do you like us to do? All right, where do we do it? You want it to really shower? He just did it. And also like more than once. Let's not say like I did it. Yeah. So shoves. He liked it. So why do you think she'd return the face once in a while? I mean the state, the state, sort of my inner dialogue coming out, I get it, but know sort of standing over her sounds like you're going to produce something more than just super freak her out. Why don't we start like never shower something easy. I'm thinking maybe in the change my diet position laying on my back. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:34:31       I can get in the dog for you dog. Hideous. I look hideous in all day and just not a good guy with what women put aside to love their mad, just let me know. I know it's not fair. It's really both of us got these wonderful looking women and which like what are they doing? Well, it's a matter with them. I also think like I'm, you know, I'm not the greatest at this, but I know people who are so some guys who are so far down the line on there physically so unappealing and they have these standards where you're like, are you insane? Why do they like it's offensive. Yeah. They're like, no fat chicks, Bro. I'm like your three 50 this is biological.

Speaker 8:          00:35:15       Yes. Do you really want to hear it? Well, it's that the way we've evolved is males, if you evolutionary biological, sort of an evolutionary psychology sort of descriptions are sort of just so right, because you can't really study them because there's no way to turn back the clock. Right. Where the people haven't found great ways to study it. So, and please don't tell me all the different ways that people do steady. I know there's things out there to help. I understand this. So males have generally, because we don't have to invest so much biologically in a child, we could just drop and go drop it go. Which is what your new anal play. There's going to be called

Speaker 4:          00:35:58       scrum master, Christina.

Speaker 8:          00:36:01       Uh, we tend to be more interested in fertility for Kennedy and health and so genetic, genetic, uh, you know, good genes we're looking for good. Yeah. And the females also are looking for that and sort of have a different relationship with guys that give them the good genes but are mostly looking for guys that can provide resources and stability in an environment where yeah, we're a child could be brought on. Yeah. Yeah. Thus the house, the Fart pill.

Speaker 4:          00:36:29       Yeah. Safety's last name means a Segura is what? Safety safe. Sure. Yeah. That was his dad though. Not, yeah, that's true. Yeah. But he's much like his father, which is wow.

Speaker 8:          00:36:39       Yeah. You've mentioned, yeah, you did. Like you do? Like is that better than him?

Speaker 4:          00:36:43       Well, I've said that. He just texted me. He let me see. He did. Oh, he just facetime yesterday facetimed me from a handicap stall. Uh, he was like, look how much room I have this shit in here. Where'd you get that? Where'd you get the way you are? I don't understand it. Yeah. It's hard to figure out. Um, I want to jump right in. Jump right in. This, we have so much.

Speaker 8:          00:37:05       You do. I've tried it. I've tried to like smoke screen.

Speaker 4:          00:37:09       We're going to ease into it. Okay. Yeah. That's what you said last time. First one of those words, the first one that was in the news. You may have caught wind of this one, but I just wanted to get your take on it. This lady who you may or may not have heard about recently in the news

Speaker 11:         00:37:25       guys, this woman says she came from Florida to find love. Now she claims a man she's accused of stalking is her soul mate because of her superstitious beliefs and a particular number following the number 33 I used to wake up every day and every night at three 33 was always three 33 three Jacqueline Claire added

Speaker 4:          00:37:46       tied to the number 33? No, this woman went from Florida. How did you, you know this story? She texted this man who she had gone on one date with 65,000 times I heard about the or something like that. Um, and then they, you know, they arrested her and then she actually, they gave her like a mini press conference, which I thought was unusual, but why Tom? She seems fine. Welcome to the world of world news now. Yeah. Yeah. Your, your show is going to become a major news outlets. Don't worry. That's what led her right

Speaker 11:         00:38:17       to a paradise valley businessman. She met on the dating app. Look, then I find out he does stuff with the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea has 33% salt in it. The common ground between the two. Same birthday, convincing her even more that he's her match.

Speaker 4:          00:38:31       Oh boy. Do you think that something's going on with her? It's no perfectly

Speaker 8:          00:38:36       normal. Perfectly natural. But are you talking about Tom, we just, you just told me you want to stand over your wife with your pants on with this lady. Cause I feel like the eyes are very revealing. Very right. You see that right? So there's a psychotic process, right? She's not connected to reality and there's a sort of an OCD thing going on here. I feel a little guilty talking about this one cause I'm going to give a talk on stigma and Oct. I'll write him a couple of months, maybe around the same week you air this thing. Uh, and so I hate to make fun of this woman as you guys make fun. We will. I know it makes me feel bad, but the, the, the inability to stop the preoccupations you see it just rolls and rolls and expands and expands and this kind of a psychotic process to it, right? She's, she doesn't even like sort of acknowledge that this is a problem here. Right. Uh, and then the obsessive compulsive quality to it and then the compulsive behavior of texting a billion times, that kind of thing. She's medication. Yeah. Very bad thing.

Speaker 8:          00:39:43       Maybe maybe the separate call exposure between the two birthday, convincing her court documents reveal. She texted him 65 many of those messages show disturbing delusions of murder also to, to process. Like if somebody said, you know, you did the 65,000 times and she responded with it. That's it. I thought it was more like, so she's not connected. Yeah. Not In this world. Yeah. And then then they, they called it delusional, you know, the newspaper just said that and she's right. This is a delusion delusional person. Yeah. So mid the sometimes schizophrenia can have certain amount of OCD type quality to it. That was voting. Yeah. What it meant, the idea that these are the newscasters are treating her like news. Like, oh no. Like she's rational. Like asking her these questions, she's going to act rashly when they know she's not. Yeah. I always, I am very disturbed by the lack of sophistication when it comes to mental health.

Speaker 8:          00:40:40       That, you know, I mean, it's like, honey, have you been, Ooh, behave even. Here's the questions you would ask somebody that you go, have you been hospitalized before? Have you been able to manage work? Have you had, do you have [inaudible] Jeff obtrusive thoughts? Have you ever thought that these things might be problematic as opposed to really, you love him? Tell us about that. Like, can you fucking kidding me? He's like, give me a break. That's what we were kind of amused by as the press conference for women that clearly just needs medical care. I feel like I've seen the same look in an interview with like a psychopathic killer who's delusional and detached. It may be, I don't think you can see he can't read a lot, but just somebody kind of, Oh, I've discovered something called the uncanny valley. You've heard of this? No.

Speaker 8:          00:41:25       Oh, you guys love this. Oh yeah, so, and she makes me think of that when I look at her, which is that, when is this comes out of the world of robotics. So cause I was thinking about stigma, why it occurs. I'm doing some research on it and I came upon the uncanny valley, enrolled the world of robotics and virtual reality. As you make humanoid, let's call them robots more and more and more lifelike. We like them like them, like them, like them till they get really nearly human. And then we're repulsed. We get these called the uncanny valley where this uncanny repulsion. And look at her, she's like, she's like, she looks like a human being, but there's something uncannily like disturbing. I was like, Oh man, but we should feel bad for her. Not just be disturbed. We should like honey, come, come with us.

Speaker 8:          00:42:08       Come on now. Yeah, but we get this uncanny discussed and discussed. Is it fear? Is it, it's all of the above. Why not jump to empathy? Much like on my hands what I'm saying, like when he was, when he watches a video, your theory, you're going to take getting injured. Why instead of empathy does my husband laugh. I am still to this day traumatized and confused by the guy in the garage car where I know he had his legs amputated. If he survived and he survived, we find out he's from you have legs. Yeah, he has legs. What? Yeah, he does. Do they work? I mean that was the one that was just maybe we should show Susan that fit and confused cause I was traumatized watching. I knew what was coming and watching it and then confused when the laughter ensued between you too. It wasn't just Oh yes, Oh yes you did.

Speaker 8:          00:43:01       Because that's because your reaction was when there was laughter and nonetheless there was mirth. There was birth and I was confused by it. I was confused by the heads up. Disturb made a traumatize me more now I was listening to an interview with Johnny Knoxville and he was saying, you know, they film his reaction after he's been hurt. Now I think the audience feels safe to laugh because we know he's okay. You know he's going to get medical treatment even if he cracks a rib. Yeah, I mean that's what we, that's what we like the three stooges and that's male humor. We like to see people get hurt that don't really get hurt. You know, we've got people banging somebody on the head. If I took a mal and banged on the head and it wouldn't be just, Oh, it would be, oh, we gotta go to the hospital now and you might never be the same. It's like that's how there has been a really starts rolling. Oh No. Oh No. What's happening? What's happening? Okay. It's a parachute or these paratroopers. Are these the weekend ones? Yeah. Military. Yeah, but see empathy. Joy. What do you land on the alligators?

Speaker 8:          00:44:16       The scream is funny. That sounds funny. Scream the sound. Not the connection to what's happening is another layer to my experience here today, which is sort of like, I'm watching myself a little more clearly and I'm seeing that. I'm laughing at things. I should not be laughing. The brown side of the forest, I the one with the, Oh, my husband loves these murder shows. Like the first word report. Interesting. Murder Porn. Is it a women's thing? This one is 24. Seven. What's your favorite? Favorite? What? Murder Porn? No, I love crime shows. I like thrillers. I know what I'm saying. Like so any I can watch. Do you like the mystery? The mystery unraveling? I like solving the crime. Like a evil genius. I don't know if you saw that. My kids are watching it. It's fantastic. Yeah. Right. And it's you putting together the layers of what's connected and that, you know, I like, I like the detective aspect. Why not figure out how photosynthesis works or something with a dead person. I'm also fascinated by human behavior and uh, I've always been interested in psychology and talk. To be fair, as I know you somewhat now you are not interested in human behavior. You're interested in abnormal human. That's true. That's true. That's true. Very abnormal or abnormal. The more I'm fascinated, but I don't know why I'm interested in that. Here's my theory because I watch him watching these shows. Tom's actually be feeling ashamed now.

Speaker 8:          00:46:01       That's a whole dynamic is the gossip. And then what did she say? And then he did that in his house. He's got two sisters, so he got rewarded by that stuff. So that element came in. Yeah. You're like gossiping. I do. I find that very, very common. Almost unheard of. No, no. I'm going up to not happen among comics. Car, super gossipy about especially about other comics, about things happening in our business. Yeah. Yeah. I almost don't call that gossipy. It's Sorta like you love tear each other down. It's envy bore the gossip. I honestly, my favorite role in that is the listening. It's not, I'm not a big like call everyone up and talk about everyone, but I like being the listening device to others. Somehow that seems better. Yeah. He enjoys hearing the story unfold. Like I'm not very good with details and stories and I know that you don't like that tone. That's true. I do like storytelling is a good skill to be comedic skill too. So it's very, I have very different parents when it comes to storytelling. My mother is very good at detailed storytelling and her father is horrific at it. Well, you just told a great story he did during his face chat. At least he sets it up, right man. Most

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       of his stories when he could be like his, the difference would be like the guy robbed the place and then that's it. He'll be like, I was in the store and then my mom will be like, I was in there, I was in line. I felt this guy come in and he was weird. You know, a woman in front of me. It was breaking a 20. Yeah, she was wearing a face shield and you'll be like, did that happen to yeah. And you're like, why are you fucking leaving all this out? Like that's how he tells the story. Okay. Anyway. All right, let's jump into the, uh, there's so much. Oh yeah. This guy is really cool. Oh, I get your take on him.

Speaker 12:         00:48:05       I want an adult. How do you in my lap right now, under 26 right now, no frills, no big titties and intelligence. I don't care. She's a hood rat, punk rock or any kind of anything. As long as she's hot in here right now in my 37 year old Dick Right now. Right now. Right now. Right now, right now. Right now. Right. No worries.

Speaker 8:          00:48:20       Oh Geez. He's out of drugs still. Well or no, this guy's got it going on. I'm sure if I should talk to her. She's like that all the time. It's very helpful. I mean, we suspected that something's going on. He could have the grinding of the teeth a little bit. The per separation right now, right now, right now. Right now, I didn't know if it was drugs or mental illness. It can be both. It's impossible at different spend time many times and had some people get hyper become hypersexual on stimulants and some people have shut off. If you have the mental illness combined with a stimulant, then it's, then it can go into overdrive and for sure it could, but it's again, it's hard to predict which way you're going to go. We, we've, we discussed this last time I seen him like we saw a lot of stimulant type stuff. He's real, he's got it going on. He's somebody who admire and emulate. Definitely. If you're going to set up your Tinder account, that's what you want. Hang behind it. You want to do. I haven't visited that this clip in a while so I forget what he could. I think he gets into more

Speaker 12:         00:49:21       never having anything is everybody else gets way he'd agree here. Beers, use the research on Calamari and I put it out eight months ago and then you just go with that. Oh, why won't you go with me? I don't need that question answered. I need right now. Right now. Right now. Right

Speaker 8:          00:49:37       CD treatment. You think you still are. You guys always, she'll be dead people. Dead people. So the repetition is severing these nonsensical even that some of the times that rhyming stuff, that weird run weird. Did you see that? A lot of me, but sometimes it makes me think you know, but he's in real trouble. Keep going. I want to say he's okay. He's in real trouble. Keep going,

Speaker 12:         00:50:07       having to order, give him food away to the homeless. I think I deserve it. I think I'm entitled Bloke and I think that I deserve it. Now. I'm not going to believe in your guide or any nonsense. I'm not going to believe in fate. And either I just want to hear right now, right now, right now, right now. Right now.

Speaker 4:          00:50:20       So he also, uh, he also tied in his, um, his own behavior to deserving it. He said, yeah, he's been a give

Speaker 8:          00:50:28       to homeless people, but I, I'm trying to, I'm really trying to figure this out. Why he might have norovirus. No, he'd be vomiting then. Uh, I'm sure you'll have the footage like that. Ma My wouldn't know why the no shirt and, and why he said No. The common things is discovered on this show. We find a lot of guys with no shoe PCP will make you store your clothes off if that's Oh yeah. It's still around. And Mtma XTO someone said good to see people do that. People. Yeah, but when you go whack on people to do it first year, just around the street, three close, cause it's kind of a manic manias main historic the clothes off. Remember that guy was the pony guy that out of San Diego masturbating out on the corner. Oh, you haven't seen that footage? Love they pony the guy, the guy that did that video about the yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

Speaker 8:          00:51:18       I know who you're talking about. The South Park picked up a little cartoon about change the world, but he was severely manic, psychotic severely and he was on the street corner screaming at everybody was closed off masturbating. That's as is the custom. It was pristine. It was swept away. Can we that now she is laughing at, I know she claimed she didn't laugh at that. You're taking it seriously. I can't tell you why this makes me laugh. My mother, who was mentally ill, ironically worked for a psychiatrist growing up and we would get these calls in the middle of the night, um, that is running down the street called the pet team. And so I knew her. I knew from very early age, like how that works. It just, it tickles me in an area from childhood. I need to hear a lot more about that. But first this guy, there's, there's a way he's sitting there that makes me think he might be lying on his stomach and he said he hadn't had any sex in five years or something. Did you say that up here? I can pay. He looks for me. I used to guys look at that when they like paraplegic, you know, sort of up on their elbows. Maybe water.

Speaker 12:         00:52:23       I think I deserve it. I think I'm entitled Bloke and I think that has the, right now, I'm not going to believe in your guide or any, no.

Speaker 8:          00:52:29       My slide down. Putting up on his elbows.

Speaker 12:         00:52:32       Yeah, under the age of 26 because it tell him my research, the father is 35 to 55 it could have been longer. Have longer telomeres, intelligence, more inner. We need to get rid of it. And like we need to get rid of incest and pedophilia. We need to get rid of it right now.

Speaker 8:          00:52:47       Right now. Right now. Right now. That's right. And there's one last thing.

Speaker 12:         00:52:50       Oh, you're only having sex. You're telling Murray's abundant. You're just going to get stressed and anger and, and make everybody depressed and stressed and angry as you were with the guy and just go by and later in life you have cancer. I want a hottie in my lap right now. Right now. Right now. Right now he can old big hits. Doesn't matter what subculture right here, right now in Spokane, right now to go out with me on a date right now.

Speaker 8:          00:53:11       Yeah. Oh, well he's give their address. He also put out a video that I'm, I don't have it queued up, but where he offered to take a woman to dinner and give her a thousand dollars just to go to dinner to go to dinner. But he also wanted it to be somebody who was perhaps willing to have a family with him after it pays $1,000. Yes. There, you know, uh, who was I talking to? One of the radio show or something I'm doing where we interacted with somebody that was like, it's such a prostitute and she said a, he's guys, we'll just pay just to hang out. Yeah. That's kind of, yeah, eh. She's got a ladder. Gee, I don't think so. It'd be hard to get that engine to adapt. So what kind of mental illness your mouth have? Oh, eh, she was borderline. Ooh. And then later psychotic.

Speaker 8:          00:53:55       But we didn't know early in the eighth has shoes, which I'm pills later. Is that the psychosis? Probably Kim is Shuttin. She um, oh, she got depressed. She got sick with cancer and then she slowly became more and more of a shut in and by the hills that, huh? I must have been pink. I don't know. Doctors do that Turner. Yeah, some something's doing. Uh, but anyways, entertaining. That's one way of putting it. Talked to my therapist is that only recently came to know that that's borderline disorder or did you always know? No, I, I only, I knew 10 years ago when I got into therapy and my shrank was like, I have a theory. Yeah. Your mother might've been. And I'm like, no, that's, that sounds about right. Yeah. So it's so surprising to me how few people really understand what that is. I was talking to somebody the other day, I'm like, no, no.

Speaker 8:          00:54:37       That's borderline disorder. Oh No. It's very clear to me. People seem to understand narcissism, but they don't understand borderline portal adds a little harder to, to undertake. Yes. From the beginning. Yeah. I guess it's a more covert racism. I think you see it, it's kind of more apparent. Yeah. And somebody can say something and be like, see, that's super nice and borders are good at sort of drag. He's getting you in the queue, sucking you in and all of a sudden the thing starts spinning around. And the appearance of being charming and normal try. Yeah. Shit. Yeah. Was real fun. Funny. I feel it was funny. Yeah. You can say, I feel bad for brothers. They're their own worst enemy. They really are. Their biggest fear is abandonment. And ironically they push everybody, right? So they suck you in and they get you super close, they build you up and then they cut you down.

Speaker 8:          00:55:19       So you, so you either you're either all good or all bad at all times and if you're all good, you're going to bandage. They make you all bad and then they abandoned you. That sounds about right. So, yeah, that's why I was down the comedian. Yeah, it's good. It's gotta come from somewhere. Oh Gosh. Yes. Oh boy. Processed a Yay. Um, so PCP, that's what we're thinking on this guy. I'm thinking still thinking stimulants. Stimulants. Yeah. Maybe I'm doing maybe MDM, ecstasy. Interesting. Come on topic. We were the tough, yeah. What? You give me a rough one. Hit me a rough one. Okay. Yeah. Oh, what'd you think? Oh Jesus. Just the way he's, Oh gosh.

Speaker 13:         00:55:57       Hi. I'm looking for a white lady. It's tattoo and dominant and be willing to put me in a dress and beat the shit out of me. Call me. I'm going to see she had three months street.

Speaker 8:          00:56:13       Okay. Can

Speaker 13:         00:56:13       Fremont CC Jim Again? You skipped and white bitch. It's what I'm looking for is a stupid care to like bitch that put me in a dress and shit.

Speaker 8:          00:56:24       Call me 22 and wait, wait, slut. No, I've never kind of really bunched up on that way. That is that he or she, he, but what are you, things are so bad for them really. Then again, when he starts calling of the, it was interesting because he started submissive. Yeah. Flip to like, is he not [inaudible] whatever it is. I was having empathy until he started that stuff that I was just, yes, I can. Horrible feeling in my chest, Mike Disgust and then pain and misery and uh, and then watching her glee and delight. Yeah. Feeling that way is really disturbing. Really like look at her actually. She's like, yeah. What? What else? What else? What else? Horrible you feeling in your stomach so hard. It's so horrible. So horrible. You're laughing at me. Sexual fetish that we're seeing. Well, no, that's, I don't think they, I wouldn't say quite that lightly.

Speaker 8:          00:57:27       That's a, that's not a great, happy person. That looks good. I mean, that's an unhappy, horrible, horrible life. You think so. Sure to be. Why? Just because he wants to be beat and everything. Did you catch you feel, it seems like a normal guy to me. You're saying you're good life and then be had the shit beat out of him. Cause that, yeah, but some people, is that always okay? There's always in pop culture, let's say in movies and I've heard it, you know, thrown around by no, not experts that the idea that um, powerful people, yes, the people didn't engage that provide those services will say that, that oftentimes are servicing people that, that are success can't be submissive in their life. And this is just sort of the way they act that out. And so when they become submissive with, by hiring someone is that they're unhappy or they really just, is it like a harmless thing? This guy's a CEO, clearly have some company, this is the president of Chevron. You didn't remember it was Brooks brothers. I guess I see that. I see the button down. Shirt on. I'm just talking about it. Yeah. Oil Man there.

Speaker 8:          00:58:40       Um, uh, it's more of the compartmentalization of trauma. Ooh. Right. And so if somebody is a, CEO's have a high probability to be narcissistic and all the nurses and as a response to trauma and then when you've been traumatized, you're using this pseudo self to keep yourself pumped up. There's a part of yourself you leave behind that then get service through reenactment of the trauma. Does that make sense? It does make sense. And reenacting the trauma can be playful and fun and okay. It's certainly doesn't fix the trauma. It doesn't help the trauma. And sometimes your retraumatized it's going to be, we can make things worse, but it's all that compartmentalization of trauma

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       and, and, and this gentleman who will call a non CEO, there's probably just a big compartment of trauma that he lives.

Speaker 8:          00:59:34       Yeah, he sort of, Eh, yeah, he started in it. Right? I think that's true. Yeah. He sort of looks like he's like never made it out and to compartmentalize the sexualization of this, he makes it a sexual fetish and then it's something I will, maybe he was sexually abused as a kid or something that right. Just physically you can I ask you, uh, your, your take on something that we were talking about? Some reason I just, I've learned it to read you guys and this, two things now I've got very, very disturbing one is the impish smile there. The corner of Tom's mouth. There occasionally appears. And the other is Christina, which is great. Yes. Then what

Speaker 4:          01:00:08       I see you suffering. Go ahead. No. Yeah. When you pointed out that I, I'm a fan or I'm very into abnormal human.

Speaker 8:          01:00:20       Yes. Yes. You like that. That's disturbing. It does that disturb me? Uh, okay. Cause those are two different questions. Yeah, that's true. That's true. Uh, does not disturb me. Okay. Uh, I don't find it normal. Yeah. I find it maybe a little bit worrisome. It is a little worrisome. Ah, I always worry. Yeah. I've had lots of friends that have been like that and they're like, well, I love reading novels about serial killers. I go, really? Why? It's like, really? Tell me why none of it's ever borne fruit now. I've never been able to find it. He sort of is, you're fine. Any pattern where I'm like, oh, that's why they do that. I just, I've never, and it just, it just strikes me as like, why? Yeah, me too. So why, why is so dark? The dark side of the force? Why are you there with him?

Speaker 8:          01:01:02       It's so disturbing to you. I don't like the murder stuff. And the reason I think it's funny that he says he doesn't care about the murder stuff. He just, he likes the APP. Makes me laugh. I'll look it up. The hold too. It doesn't necessarily, maybe you will after. I like doing all this stuff. I think part of this is like a mad at my mom maybe or something. And this is a way that you deal with that. Yeah, I have. So then you are, you're Bob. The way he would come after me when I've started feeling better, but I know you can handle it. But the reason I feel comfortable laughing at you is because you're professional and you know what I do. I do remember being exhausted by the end of last show. I do remember that. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I think I remember you saying that emotionally exhausted. I think getting together the same feeling in my gut. Here's a good one. Oh good. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:01:43       Oh, I just saw our first reaction every time. It's all I got to work there. What is she doing? She's rubbing. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:01:54       No, I don't pull, you know what? I don't believe her. No. Oh, I think she's doing that for some, like business likes to, to attract vampire, you know what I mean? Some people that are into that kind of fetishy stuffs. I bet.

Speaker 14:         01:02:05       Yeah. And I just wanted to share with all of you, I felt the need to share me placing menstrual blood all over my face and what power it holds for us as women to fully own this part of self that we have been shamed.

Speaker 8:          01:02:23       Well, whatever it was, I didn't believe it is sick. You didn't believe in a say. Yeah. The first I went out for a thing and I went, wait, wait, wait. She's doing it for a reason. But also it could be a bit, um, and attention seeking reason. It's sort of stuff as it's, it's some, it's like either it goes under either, hey, I provide fetish services and here's one of them are very, come get me. Or this is an artistic happening, you know, as artistic expression or in her case it's a political move thing. So, right.

Speaker 14:         01:02:50       Reclaiming the blood and through reclaiming it to get worse, show cycle. No fully allowed me to embody like everything that I was, it fully allowed me to have the freedom to be able to express who I was in every way. It mean to me

Speaker 8:          01:03:04       this, um, this justification, this, but explanation for it sounds like nonsense. Total bullshit. Total cause she's just an APP. It's all, it's all bullshit. Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. But I thought that the, now she could be borderline, right? Because, because my original take on the blood was like, oh, that's bullshit. And then as she's talking, well that's bullshit too. So there's no real there. There. Oh, borderline. Sometimes I'm not, I don't know her. I'm not calling her out. She seems lovely. Whatever is world story stuff where you find all your stuff, people send it from everywhere. Oh my God. Oh my gosh. Um, yeah. And so, uh, the, it has that feel of Sar posted it like look at this stupid bet. Yeah.

Speaker 14:         01:03:47       By putting it in sports media, I really found it just a kind of, gave an invitation to people to be able to know that it's okay to share this part of yourself and that it's not terrible,

Speaker 8:          01:04:00       blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Yeah. Bullshit. Whatever. I don't know what her motivation is. Good. I can't tell. Yeah. Um, Worldstar I didn't even put that together. Horrible. You know, I've been trying to play, we're looking all over for it. Is it here? I wanted to play for him. That other guy breaking his leg. Oh No. Oh Wow. A genuine response to this. How about that? Hey, so let me see it. I'm interested now to what I was going to tell you. It's kind of a side note. It's, it'll do Braille. I was listening to a podcast about the me too movement yesterday. Yes, yes. And there's, um, you know, millennials and she goes, before the podcast began, she goes, I just want to give a trigger warning. Oh boy, you're listening to this. You might be triggered. And I was like, where are we going with this?

Speaker 8:          01:04:49       I thought that I thought we'd sort of move through that. Yeah. I've just, I've discovered I spent some time with millennials this week, uh, and to, to big shocking things jumped out at me. One, they do not use condoms. Zero. Zero. What? I was talking to the teen mom on, it's about two 20 kids in there and I was like, hey, we're talking about the rise in STI is, and I go, you know, safe sex. I could see their eyes kind of glaze over. I go, condom use nothing. I go, how many of you use condoms? I just raise your hand. Not one hand went up that one hand, one hand. I was like, oh, I need to start love lineup again. They're a snapchat page or podcast or something. So that one jumped out at me and then I've decided that millennials all have the dunning Kruger Syndrome.

Speaker 8:          01:05:32       What's that? Oh, I thought Christina would know that when we immediately, Denny Krueger is essentially a cognitive distortion where you think you know more than you do or you think you're better than you are. It's what essentially gives people the ability to get up at American idol and sing like crap and then say, I understand it's not a great, so that's done in Kruger. It's actually a syndrome. And, and people have varying degrees of this done in Kruger phenomenon based on their essentially lack of real knowledge because they don't know how much they don't know. Right. They never, it's like a lack of exposure to depth and therefore they feel like they know everything cause they're exposed to the phone, they can get fired. Everything. It's reading the whole book. They're just going to, they're not having any spiritual learning. They're just looking at a bunch of facts and then they forgetting them and they, and they all think they know a lot more than they do.

Speaker 8:          01:06:21       So it's done in Kruger. Wow. So they are sexually active. I mean, they're not just a bunch of pure puritan. I know they're not using condoms, they're just not. And there's an opposite. Dunning Kruger or see this, the converse of the dunning Kruger is the imposter effect. People that have large, um, tremendous amount of expertise often feel like an imposter. Most people in professions to sorta go through a phase, at least a phase like that. Yeah. So, wow, it's fascinating. Or Sti is just rampant, just going up there, going up words if we're everyone got that. But as we get the vaccine now, so it's not that big a deal, but it's a no Korea and syphilis going way up. Well it's treatable. Thankfully for now. I mean they're, they're getting resistance. You know, syphilis is a, is a Shanker that goes away and it comes back and surprise.

Speaker 8:          01:07:08       You don't have like nasty pictures like that for me to the medical grows. Yeah. Which is confusing. Again, I don't, I don't get that you guys are novelists in so many ways. Uh, but, but uh, the simplest goes away and goes inside and that's when it does, you're, it's damaged. Correct. Right, right. It'll make you crazy. Raw Nature. Right. Well that's the theory we do. We don't know. I think that's probably a good one. Cause he, cause he, he was always sick, you know, forever. And then all of a sudden it's neurological deterioration and what makes me absolutely insane. Does your audience know about your background in philosophy? Okay. Um, is that people go, oh, well his, his philosophy was so negative and so disturbing. It drove him crazy. Are you kidding me? There's never been a case of psychosis caused by philosophy or a belief system or a challenging problem of some type. It's like mental illness, illness, a brain disorder. Did you ever call our friends at pel? No. Don't bring, oh, Jesus. Oh Man. Whatever's going to happen. It's not going to be good. Uh, oh no. Oh No.

Speaker 9:          01:08:18       Oh No.

Speaker 8:          01:08:24       Uh, you know what? I'm having a strange reaction. Yeah. It's not as bad as it could've been. Yeah. I thought he was going to lose his legs because that car rolled over him and, and that truck sort of metal hit him. He would lost his legs, but the scream is funny. Yeah. Yeah. I'm here with you. It's dark side of the forest, Georgia guys. She's a funny screen without a single shift or pool or anything that make, why is that? Like, I don't like, I know he's in pain. There was no bounces back. Hoe knows he's already walking before the surgery. It's made an open fracture there. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:09:07       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:09:11       When I add, oh no.

Speaker 3:          01:09:14       Are you thirsty? Oh my God. I don't want to breast feed. You watch suck me dry.

Speaker 8:          01:09:29       Your wife seems to like it. Susie may get out of this wall. Oh,

Speaker 3:          01:09:37       thirsty. Oh Wow.

Speaker 8:          01:09:41       Is He, is he, is he producing milk? No, but they're pretty nice nips, right? Men lack 10. Yeah, it's called galactorrhea then. But I mean if you're on certain medications, work on those nips. You really got to get on him right. To make the blog bill. Bill come out. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:10:01       You want to try?

Speaker 8:          01:10:04       Wait, what's wrong with this manager? This one? I mean, something's going on with him, right? You go out with him. Uh, it makes me, I'm going to guess, Oh, I don't know. But it feels like a gender issue, right? Like he's identifying with the mom and stuff and he wants to be that interesting. And I'm wondering if he's on hormones and maybe sort of making his way that way. This is his sexual piece of that. Now this is one of the earliest, your most vulnerable oldest clips. Yeah. What do people have been saying and thinking about it just, they just love it early. Just gnarly. Yeah, but he seems very, I, he seems quite at ease with all of it. Very good at it. Yeah. He's a so he doesn't bother him. He likes what he likes. Oh yeah. I don't feel bad than the normal your mom's house way does it normally. I feel so sad for these people, but I noticed there's something about myself. I can't get my hands away from my friends cause I'm so ashamed. Why are you so sure your shame? No shame being here with you today. Cause I kind of know him. I know what's coming. I know it's shameful thing is I, I, I actually have empathy for these people too and I feel like, I just think the behavior silly, the behaviors funny yet, even though we have empathy in, okay. Yeah, the behaviors. Silly zoom. You think of this guy?

Speaker 8:          01:11:57       I just, to me that's just desperation. Yeah. But I also think there's something interesting with the voice level in the eyes. You know it's like the voice is like, it's like this whisper but it doesn't seem like he's whispering. Seems like he's talking now I'm imagining, I'm imagining he's really fat. Oh really? And there may be like a respiratory piece of this. Oh okay. You know what I'm saying? I was like he's not fully because the camera's awesome. Right? I don't think his lungs can inflate like that much or that much weight and the eyes are really not moving along well. I'm thinking that looks a little substance here. We look at that. Look at the glaze. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:14:08       Oh, that's not good. No,

Speaker 8:          01:14:12       it's that good. Hold cheese. He's got like a leg brace on and then they keep, uh, they came after him. Well, someone's standing on them right now. I want his head.

And then that was just a bystander. You got to slap, what is it bad or would it be, if she's tasting the first guy, let's look is mentally ill, do unmoved mover the prime Mary? What's going on?

Speaker 8:          01:15:06       Like what's the, what? What's going on? Is that mental illness? Well, it could be drugs, right? Like, yeah, that's always, if your choices, it's hard to tell to rule out. That's right. We got to get a toxicology and see what's in there and uh, and see what he's like when he's sober. He's not totally wow. It depends what you call normal, Tom. I mean, I've started to feel a lot of things in normal. They didn't feel that way about an hour ago. It's physical time with you guys. I could be, who knows where I'm at? Had deaf. Jeez. It's a little overkill on the tasing.

Speaker 8:          01:15:44       He goes outside and he just gets right on his, a little scoot. Scoot. He gets on his way. What is that like a scoot for your, when you have a a leg that though. Oh, they either think of the scoot. They've put this chair chair on wheels. Oh Wow. Yup. Well he, he needs that. He's got a broken leg. I'd love to hear how that happened. The broken leg. A couple really good ones. There was skiing in the Alps, I suspect holiday. I'm really John McAfee's sword. I remember McAfee antivirus software. Yes. Yes. This man became very wealthy. Oh. Cause he's one of the early guys that got in on a software viruses. Yeah. So he uh, he kinda got out. He got out of it goes, I could sit here and do this all day. I'm in a parallel universe. I like, time doesn't move anymore.

Speaker 8:          01:16:39       If I'm going through the wormhole by, okay, Susan, am I okay? Am I went pee? No, it's just not good. She's worried about me. She's worried. I May, I may have her sit and watch them. I just add to this business, it's what you want to see, what they've got, the long nipples. So you can see that one. That was great. I got a first row view of her as that was playing. She was like, yeah. So McAfee, I knew she liked that one, was bought out of his company a while ago, left with nine figure there, went down to Belize, um,

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       and has since um, been uh, chased by them for a murder or to choose by who? By Belizian authorities or they believe that he murdered a neighbor. Um, but I didn't watch this documentary and then like in the midst of all of all the, his time that he kind of took over the town he was in and believes, you know, the rich guy hired like 20 armed guards, bought the police, you know, cars and boats and just craziness, kinda crazy. He also got in with some of the local gals on a fetish of his, and I wanted to see your Tim doing this. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. How weird is that? So here's the, the girls brace yourself.

Speaker 11:         01:17:55       But those were the first time I was ashamed. What? Then I got used to it. But did he have you do, um, sit on this hammock? They have my card as a whole 10 a hallmark and after that he lays down on the hammock. Then he m he would cut, cut a little hole and he would sit there. That's why he is cause he wanted to have, like Scott said, I didn't agree with that one has got sex. And when you poop in someone. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:18:27       Oh, what'd she call it? Scat. Scat sex. Scott Seq catchments into to this. The Scots are particularly bad, but nursing is so he would have these girls sit in a hammock with a whole shit in his mouth. Oh, I'm sorry. I misunderstood. I thought she said he would sit in a no, no, no. Shit and Herman. No, no, no, no, no, no. You're telling me they, they, it's pretty clearly. I understand where you've kind of heard that, but yeah, but no, no. Again, easy money. Great Gig. Great Gig. All you gotta do is go over the fully, yeah. Noted here. Let's give, let's go through it before we discuss. Hoping someone will easy peasy

Speaker 11:         01:19:06       you shit in his mouth like that. That's cute. I have never had done that before. And it was an experience for a man under your butt to shit in his mouth. Did he ever have regular intercore like that? No. None of that. That was the only thing I did.

Speaker 4:          01:19:31       So his only thing was paying these girls titties. Was He masturbating when they did this? They don't get into that, but I like to just in question like imagine that he was, um, that would make sense, right? Because this is a sexual fetish top level. Here's the thing, I actually wonder, well, you know, I'm a pretty open mind. A different people like in different things. We know. Whatever turns you on, fine. How can somebody get turned on by that, I mean get turned on a, how can they even get through? How can they tolerate it? Yeah. Yeah. I wonder that too. I mean, how do they not throw up like instantly, instantly, you know? I mean, you walk by and I'm shit and like, yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:20:08       Or even if they were gonna shit on his face, he'd be like, no. He's like, ah, here, how can he not? Does he get sick too? I mean, yeah, you could get this is, this is what I was worried about for you. Yeah, I know. Yeah, it was right. That's why I worry about for me, am I doing it right? She eats my scrum. You're saying yes, I'm worried about, and that's not, we're not in a third world country. You know, we're here, although these days, this bus answers starting to become that. But, uh, for real. All right. The width of the sanitation around homelessness. I, I'm, I'm mortified what's going to happen this summer and I, the city is not helping the, letting people suffer the streets and there should accumulate a giant piles and the rats accumulate on those piles and we are going to have a big infectious disease problem. The summer

Speaker 4:          01:20:50       defecation. Yeah. It's a huge problem. Wow. Yeah. Um, and do you think that there's a probability that when somebody has a scat sex issue that it is okay,

Speaker 8:          01:21:01       Kenna? I don't get as an orange. I know I don't get it. I don't get it at all and I, and I don't, it's not something you get into with patients, you know, at the level I treat patients. Yeah. What do you mean you don't get into, they don't admit to it or you just as a come up and into this stuff? I'm working out with people and so I don't, I can't, it's quite it with anything because I never have gotten into it and everything. Yeah, okay. Except somebody just wildly, you know, way out into sort of a psychotic state, which she kind of sounds like he is right. Running around buying everything and sir, he's, Oh, he's whacked out. He sounds kind of wacky. Yeah. And, and I, and I don't understand where that comes from. How I had, we had a love line once we had a woman that call Dan, she was, hey, she was a servant for this kind of thing or whatever. She was a prostitute essentially when she said we had a guy who wanted that and she wouldn't do it. So he goes, can we at least put it in this top where for me to take it home? Yeah, she did. I met. Wow. We started calling. We called her Tupperware lady. That ever happened.

Speaker 4:          01:21:57       I've met, uh, I met a couple who does videos online and they were, they were at a show and they were telling me about, you know, they do sex videos, you know, and they sell them and uh, one of their fans contacted, wanted her to shit and mail it to them, but also one of her to stick to a specific diet for three days before. What was the Diet? She was like, he just made me eat these certain things and he was like a hassle. Is it certs? Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:22:23       I don't know. But she goes, I ate it and then shutting the thing and, and he sent her like two grand or something. That's what I'm talking about. Is it that bad? The women are making money. Not that catch your Flab, Christiana here. Is that what you're saying? I love you to send me to believes. Is that where no, no. She what? He wants the Tupperware of job. He wants the two rather. Yeah. Got It. Two grand for that. Did you do it for far less even? That's easy money.

Speaker 4:          01:22:48       Tim Horton's lady lady in the, in the coffee shop last week.

Speaker 8:          01:22:52       Uh, this sounds familiar. Oh yes. So she would Duke it out for her yet. That was extraordinarily extraordinary. Yeah, that was, that was, yeah, there she is. Yeah. And she's really animated. Love to know what she was fighting by. Oh, it was about that. She, they wouldn't let her use the restroom, which is sorted, nicely dressed, which I think is a stair right. She's like [inaudible] mom and here she goes. There it is. I gotta go. I gotta. I gotta I got a problem here. Hold out here. Oh, she is crazy. It's unbelievable. And then look at this. Look at this. Yeah. Oh. Unless you wiped your hands. Wait, what's your ass that's arose that I have to, well, she picks it up on their barriers. And you haven't seen this before or you've seen it. Okay. I figured I'd like Rappaport did a whole commentary this good.

Speaker 8:          01:23:35       It's pretty good. He's very funny. I was like, I saw it on Twitter actually. Now the readiness was what? She had that bowel movement ready. Yeah, and the chamber loaded. What do you make of all that? That's why she needed to go to the bathroom. She's like, she's like, it's got to happen. If you don't believe me, this lady's problematic, uh, to this particular location. Yeah. You kidding? This is a difficult person. You are, I believe is the trouble that person. I got to tell you. I'm really, I understand that and I understand. You know why people are like, you need to get out of here. Yeah. I always feel like it's so crazy when anyone is refuse the right to a bathroom. Well, what civilized world, my understanding is what came out of that episode where they question those two African American gentleman that were in the Starbucks was now that everyone could use a bathroom under any circumstances.

Speaker 8:          01:24:29       If Starbucks, that's what I heard the new policy with [inaudible]. They can't serve you cups of bowel torture and then be like, you can't shit here. I know. I mean, that's the product. That's what, it's amazing. They let you use the bathroom if you buy something. Yeah, that's true. I also think it is, it's inhumane when you're just out anywhere and you're like, I need to pee. Strange should be not here to tell you what in this town, in southern California, it's not that bad. Most places within a couple of hits, you can find some brilliant boy. You know what I mean? Usually, but you can be in New York City, it's no, wherever you go for miles and they're everywhere. Everyone's got a bathroom there. Everyone's got that downstairs. I know. Crappy bathroom by the, by the supplies was seven months pregnant lady. I walk in and I'm like, I'm using your bathroom. I don't even fucking ask him like it's happening, dude. I dare you to tell me no. Yeah, or what do you think? I want you to look at this. There's obviously a strapper Krav product, Christina, very clearly now because we don't want to miss any of this gold. It's coming your way, but I won't drop a Deuce in public. That's not happening yet at the all the time and be all the time. Yes. You know, what are you think of? We're almost done. Okay. I'm having a great, there's a grand finale. The big for my hands,

Speaker 10:         01:25:39       my face day. United States, he knows that he's the Latin. Uh, so you've been not even

Speaker 8:          01:25:49       so it's his version of he's funny. He's funny. Yeah, he's good. But there's some things going on with all that I haven't seen yet. No, you can see them. He's been with the sauna bed. He's been in the side. I bet he does. Dentist it's brush everyday. Deep brush is everyday. Yes. Stance. It seems a little bit to lazy, but there's also, is there something that you can pick up in his lunch?

Speaker 10:         01:26:14       Uh, uh,

Speaker 16:         01:26:19       uh, Eh,

Speaker 8:          01:26:23       well he, he's got emphysema, right? Is that what it, is that a pen? He's got the clip to his chest, her microphone and uh, yeah, I know he, that's a, that's a airway obstruction. You're hearing that doll, that sound. It is, yeah. You guys seem to always give me somebody with pulmonary problems. Yeah. Because it sounds so funny. Yeah. Yeah. There should be a respiratory therapist. That's the word. The job for you. Collect gobs of sputum, Alyssa. That buddy shall people make. Well, tell him why we think this is so funny how the origin of the joke came. Well, hold on. I'll get through the rest of it.

Speaker 10:         01:26:59       Did it? We made it. No white dining. No, no, no. Go ahead.

Speaker 8:          01:27:11       Oop. There it is. I mean this is a lot of sign right there. Oh yeah. Yeah. Maybe a truck driver maybe. No, I don't think, I don't think he's worth nine side. I think he's lived in the desert. He's lived on that rock. Yeah. I don't think his started with a normal brain. Oh really? Oh, interesting. That's a lifetime of cognitive impairment interests. Really. Something for sure. So like your whole life, you're not normal. Yeah. Yeah. You're like, no, no sunblock for me again. He did that get in the usual long school bus. Yeah. Oh really? Yeah. Gotcha.

Speaker 10:         01:27:48       Good. I like him and I don't feel sorry for him the way to everybody else. Yeah. He makes the best of it. Good for him, man. Care what it looks like.

Speaker 8:          01:27:56       Well, I really lost my mind on this because my producer Blue Band said he, uh, he names all these files. Yeah. And uh, what really made me flip out is that he named the, they're usually things like just staying alive or like, yeah. Closer look at his teeth. Yes. But he used, he called this one using lung infection as an instrument.

Speaker 10:         01:28:22       Yeah. He does have a pulmonary issue. Yep.

Speaker 8:          01:28:27       Salmon of lungs. Yeah. As a, as an instrument. It's nice. I dig every, he makes the best of everything this guy. See that's why I like her. You were saying there's a chance he's a smoker though too. That would help explain some of the skin stuff too, right? Yeah. Oh yeah. God, I really can you see like he's Kinda got to expect to see like tobacco stained fingers. Yeah, sure. Yeah, he smokes definitely. I mean it looks like there's a little discoloration here. You don't see that anymore. I see a lot of that stuff. I bet. Especially with Rehab, right. Cause you're working really ages your skin. But it's weird you guys, people would, you know, I practice medicine long enough to have seen historical stuff come and go. And this business of, there was a, there was a women's thing for awhile, for a long while where a woman's identity was, I'm the woman with the cigarette and the Martini.

Speaker 8:          01:29:15       Oh right. And that's, that's what, that's who I am is by high liberate myself and to find myself. And when those women hit their late seventies and I was telling them to stop smoking, you were thought I was telling them to like give me your soul. Like they'd start shattered. Like I can't, I'm sure you understand what you're asking. Who I am. Yeah. It's my, my give up your belief in Christ. Yes. Yes. That's who I'd be if I had quit. I loved smoking. I mean I stopped, but you did it, but it wasn't, you wouldn't have a sick like a cigarette holder and that kind of Korea crazy bark. I don't know if it's just, you can think of those old, those old, those old posters, you know. Oh, they're great. And the imagery. It's something funny about in movies, I still can kind of romanticize cigarettes popping in and out in the lighting.

Speaker 8:          01:30:01       Yeah, the ritual of it. Yeah, you get it. I get that. But at the same time, it's so bizarre. Well, in life though, when I see someone step out of it, sorry, what are you doing? I, I become that person that way where I go like, I can't believe this person is doing that. Especially with today's knowledge, you that you live in the world now, you're exposed to all that information. It's, in fact, I was last night watching, I'm dying up here. Do you watch it a second. Okay. We'll, Goldie was up at three in the morning and she's always slogan. I thought, damn, that would work. You'd keep you use it as a stimulant. Stay awake. I get, if she wouldn't have that any more smoke and drink constantly in that show. It makes me crazy. But it's also 17 oh yeah. All right. Well we've come to see mother, the mystery mystery songs.

Speaker 8:          01:30:47       We've come to the, uh, Oh God, the final, this is the one we've really been cherishing for you. And there was not a lot of poop today. Like my son's warned me. That's interesting. Well, we got to do our own discussion of it. Uh, okay. Okay. Yeah, that was fun. But now we're going to see if you're part of the gang. Okay. So here, what was that? What did that say? See Susan, go close your eyes. No, you can, you won't be able to tell because it's all in the audio, but it will please, uh, we'll, we'll bring her in for her take on. Okay. Um, all right. So this guy has some advice for just the general public. He's has advice, he has some thoughts on some things that are actually medically related. Oh, good. And maybe you can support or if you feel so inclined, a dispute what he suggests.

Speaker 17:         01:31:39       Did you pet any kind of correct. How disorder problems? I'm here to tell you, forget that bag or forget about salad spaghetti, that Dick and plants and all that stuff. So I don't know if you believe me or not that he like the same. You smoked meth with a small limp. Dick. Did that get hardly any other way and watch it get harder and than Lorez smoke harder. My Dick get this. Unbelievable.

Speaker 8:          01:32:03       That could happen. That could happen, right? Yeah. Okay. Well let's keep going. You want to take a video of whatever I have videos. Just a still of me. I just got to get your face for the audience that that's possible. It says a priapism is what he's getting. Really. So really? Yeah. Now would you suggest to somebody who's like, no, that is not a treatment for extra socks. You shouldn't smoke. No, he should not smoke meth. But what if they're like, I've tried Viagra and I'm trying to say no, no, I have bad but it's bad. But we were shocked to know that there was some medicinal value to math. I say as a side effect, it's a side effect that you get erect. It's a priapism. W I explained a priapism is like, uh, is is what my radio parties called clinical boner. Okay. It's like it gets extra from and can come down and it can actually cut off its own blood supply. And this is a common occurrence with no. Okay. But, but certain medicines, certain substances can't cause it even to the PD, you fives, you know the Viagara isn't that kind of stuff can cause it. This guy finds it so important. He uses it. He likes it. Well I'll, I'll let him tell you. Okay.

Speaker 17:         01:33:11       You won't believe how good it feels. Good. You're straight. He won't believe how good it builds. Your dickhead becomes so sensitive that you don't need lube. You don't need spirit. You just strip that Dick head this up and down four times. It's this band to do it and you shoot and norm is very thick, hot, white come.

Speaker 8:          01:33:35       Those are details I needed. Um, there's more, oh, this more? Yeah. No, there's no way. Just when you think it can't get grocer, brace yourself is definitely more, okay.

Speaker 17:         01:33:43       More calm than I'd ever done in my life. And I know I'm gay. I love it. Get blowjobs. And I'd tell you what, I cannot wait to affect that. Been hot, horny home man. I let anybody second give me a blow job. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:33:59       So that's, yeah, it says, here we go, good hypersexual and all that stuff in math that happens. And you're saying like you don't recommend anyone to do it though. Where Tom don't put words in my mouth. I mean, how dare you. Why would I suggest something you never say always or never in medicine? Well, here's the next piece that I think both things are going to enjoy.

Speaker 17:         01:34:21       My brother didn't believe me and when he smoked with me, he put his dick. I can't believe how big his dick was. He checked off for stroke and shot the most confident. Every shot is like he's only 49 and he's fine. He has no neuropathy problems at all. He's Dick is even harder and thicker and even more company believes me now.

Speaker 8:          01:34:40       So to recap, yeah, he's sold us on the math. Sol for erectile dysfunction is the or other was not a believer, but he, when they smoked together, his brother pulled out his dick and he couldn't believe how big his brothers Dick was and how much it produced. And then he jerked off in four strokes. Yeah. And it was so much and his brother believes him now. Yeah. And this gentleman is delighted and impressed by very impressed. He also pointed out medicinally, I was wondering if you could weigh in on this. He said my brother is only 49, no neuropathy. Neuropathy because he was having neuropathy. So he's like, he's got like the neuropathy effect erections. Is that why it's uh, with diabetes. Ah, so maybe that's why he's bringing it up at all. It's that, so I'm figuring he's diabetic and so to just summarize, Tom Diabetic should smoke crack and win back.

Speaker 8:          01:35:36       Those are the people that really benefit from, and you're putting your name on the line, the doctor just stamp of approval. In fact, if in fact they get the, the, particularly with smoke cocaine and, and sometimes it's bad diabetics get horrible problems with, with these, with the diabetics are especially prone to just severe medical problems from both. Oh, horrible. Horrible, horrible. And made these gone in short order. Is it possible that kid is due for diabetic? He did it. He did it. He, you know, he could the medical community get behind. Well, let's go get him. Let's get him over to Harvard and, uh, bring them to the medical school or unlock the mystery because the, the, the neuropathy line was giving me trouble last time over this for this guy has been in our lives now. I'm so glad to hear that. And I believe him biggest tableaus couldn't believe it.

Speaker 8:          01:36:28       Wait a minute, and I'm assuming that's his source of his erectile dysfunction. Right. And that's why he's saying you're blowing my mind. Wait, what's the, the source of it is the diabetes, the diabetes. And that's why he's so geeked to have a big hard dick. Yeah. From a little limp dick to a big hard day. Now what's with a thick heart calm. Why is it so thick? And, and did my wife just throw up? She was like, yeah. Um, it doesn't, it does increase the thickness of your, you're dehydrated from math. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And if you're sexually stimulated, your prostate will begin to produce a bit of fluid into the seminal vesicle. So it was probably just a little bit more than usual. Yeah. He's stoked on it and he's just stoked and he's got something coming. Well, so I'm going back on my private prison thing. It may not be priapism that he had. It may just be his yeah. Experience with math. Yeah. It sounds like what Dr Drew's saying for our listening audience. Try it out. You know? See what happens. We're going to have Tom try at first. [inaudible] right. Well it sounds like he wants to be so interesting.

Speaker 17:         01:37:25       Let's play it out here today. You do anything illegal. I don't want you to do anything illegal and I don't want you to do anything or don't feel comfortable doing. Of course, I promise you, if you can, Fannie body, you know that won't get you into trouble, smokes and man, and the more you smoke up that bow hardier deep, we'll get your dick won't get hard. Let me try. I didn't want to see me go from too hard. I would do it this to clarify and that will be tape it from, this is small Dick, very lamp and watching. Well, I want to know why you guys haven't searched the land. Got It.

Speaker 8:          01:37:56       Ready? I mean, no. Oh, what happened was I'll show it to you. I mean, I'm a little disappointed when you personally, we shared this and we really celebrated this tee shirt. There's a t shirt. No, no. There are two t shirts and a hat and by the way, much to Christina's Chagrin it for stroke gang. A guy on Matt telling you to Jack Your Dick for four stroke gang had the fourth stroking motor shirt and the forest oak and golf shirts. I would say, I would say that this would be, these are sort of billboards against smoking crack. You don't know how the male mind works. You don't get, it was like, no, people don't buy. We had to reorder this one within two days. We were restocking this one. Now I have news for you. I'm going to Las Vegas this weekend. I want to proudly wear that hat. Oh, I fuck. I wish I had brown hair. I would definitely. Is there something else that I'm opposed to the four stroke gang as a piece of Merch exing out half of our audience. There's no woman, normal mental faculties that wants to wear a force. Surely. Oh my God. She wants to wear shirt in Las Vegas for stroke. You're going to wear that shirt.

Speaker 8:          01:39:22       She's been in this room too long. You see what happens to people get scared. My shame diminishes. I started participating with you guys. It really is. Christie. I just want to interject. Excuse me, Christina saying this x is out half the audience, the female audience. I just wanted to show you. It's the dude's getting them to where I want to volunteer. Exhibit a is that a woman might wear that. She's wearing black guys who like to fuck. Fuck good for hot black guy and you want to fuck me at 2195 black guys that love fuck and fuck good. If you were hot black guy and you love the fuck black guys love to fucking fuck good. If you're a hot black guy and you want to fuck me, it doesn't matter if you're hot black guy and you want to, these are all listeners of our show.

Speaker 8:          01:40:19       Okay. Who they are. They're submitting videos of the try it out. Guy Who you covered last time. Yes. That's the, they're all period. And this guy loved the fuck the fuck if you're a hot block. What's weird though. Yeah. It's not as disturbing. One of the women are doing it right. There's charming. It's entertaining. But you try and tell me these chicks won't wear the forest and they're fans. They're up there. There were proudly, see, but, but again, there's, there's always a dude behind that. Yeah. Yeah. There's always some guy going, oh, we could do this. I want you, we'll put a mustache. I did the great, yeah. So, so in a way it's not their own autonomous decision making the results in the forest. It's a theory. I think some of them would even get upset and be like, Dr Dre, oh, I would like to know, please write in.

Speaker 8:          01:41:11       Yeah. Because, because, because, because if that was your idea, the young lady and you executed on your own slow clap, I will say too still cause horror because that's, we're evolving that as a species to support. We are. Oh really? You think so? Yeah. I think true that our audience, we do have women that are that down for they get done that they would self initiate this Tiwana no, I need to know. I will say this in, in, in your defense of your theory, when I was a touring last year, a lot of times women would come up to me and go, uh, my boyfriend said to tell you yes. And we learned this eye level. I work with coral reefs always go because a woman would call with a prank, something. We go, okay, where's the Dude Uber, which up to that and it always, not 99% one hut, no one time there was not, there was one time there was not.

Speaker 8:          01:42:01       And we literally like befriended her and said, you can't believe us. We had a neat nicknamed her and like, you know, we just kept her around because it was such a, it was, it was uh, you know, some o z a unicorn just to further this we restocked to try it out, which is that guy we restocked a ball hog, my water champ hat sold out. So we had to recite that. And also it guess what, guess what sold out and you hit your star. You're not Los Angeles shirt. That's a bunch of those are restocked in the store merchant method guide to walk around with something unless vague. It's just going to make the trip worthwhile. It really is. Cause I'm going to collect, see what your listeners or viewers to see what I got. Oh you got, yeah. We need to know who they are, what they're up to and I'm sorry, how to, he's gonna be quite a weekend.

Speaker 8:          01:42:47       Your heart now. Wonderful people. Very nice. This is a, this is such a treat. I mean I really want to make this irregular like thing where you come every once in a while. Oh yeah, yeah. The Bacon it, but she'll be on demand by your viewers and listeners. Oh yes. I'd come here every week if were up to me. It's so you got it. They have to want it. Day One. Believe me, it takes a while to you. Last time, I must admit I was much more disturbed by the end. Oh really? Yeah. Yeah. So you need to up your game a little bit, Tom.

Speaker 8:          01:43:20       Well I think, you know the interesting thing is you say Tom, but really what you're saying is your mom's house listeners. You heard it from the doctor's mouth.
