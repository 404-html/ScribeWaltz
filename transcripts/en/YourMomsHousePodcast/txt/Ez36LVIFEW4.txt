So some nights it's like Sebastian, like I said, Brian Regan, Dane Cook's doing a few go to oddball and you could check out all the links are on my site. So you can see that. And the way it works is that all the comics that are kind of not as known, we do 15 minutes sets, usually something like that. And then the big, there's an intermission, it's a long show. So there's intermission. A guy does like 30 or 40. They take a break, you come back the uh, the rest of us do like the 15 minute sets. And then, um, then the, the big name, we'll close out, do a 40 minutes

Um, he's pretty bold to put himself farting on the inner webs, but he was always like that. Right? Like he always put Ari's asshole and his Dick. Everybody pulled his dick out. He did it at the Irvine proud when they banned him for a while. They just temporarily though. Just never, I remember I did, I've told this story before. I, we're talking like a few years in.

Speaker 2:          00:26:57       problem. It doesn't hurt. No. Okay, well that's good. All right, that sounds like that could be a problem when he's got going on. I think so. Dripping blood was that. It's, if it's bright blood that's supposed to be better than dark blood, they say cause it's like star last phone call for second. Poor Ari Aries. Guys, pray for Ari's butthole. Pray for it, send him butthole wishes and compliment them on those farts. Hence, by the way, a bunch of people told me they were doing my line to like their girlfriends and stuff. Want to hear a cool fart and they're going want to hear a funny fart. That's how you say it wrong. It's want to hear a cool fart. And then when

Speaker 4:          00:27:41       they like turn Fart,

Speaker 2:          00:27:45       sometimes people don't say yes so that you still wait a beat. But it's always you want to hear a cool fart and then for our end it's just for the women listening. You can say no, you can say no. I say no almost all the time. I want to hear a cool far now. That's how you it. That's actually how it goes in the house. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. You know I really appreciate your fan next to the bed that you man, turn on. I hate your fan so much cause it makes me feel like one of those tower tower fans feel feverish and sick when I sleep with a cold air blowing on me all night. I angle it so it doesn't go on. It still trickles down. Someone, man, it doesn't make you feel sick or weird or weird. Like I have a fever or something, but if you feel cool, hate it.

Speaker 2:          00:28:40       I like it. Men Do that and we have this thing. I know my dad has slept with a fan so gross like our baby. Um, my wife is convinced it was cold even though even when it's 106 outside. Yeah. So the air conditioning, which I would have down to like 66 is that like 75 so, yeah. I need the fan. He's a baby though. He's, he's, they need, they need one more layer than you do. He's fine. Okay. No he is fine cause I keep it nice and warm in the house. Every time I pick him up from a nap or something, it's just like heat just coming off of his body. Yes, I do. I think you should drop it another degree or two. Seriously. All right. All right. We'll do it tonight in the 60s but I think you sent me three is fine. I usually do 73 chocolate. Let's do it.

Speaker 4:          00:29:28       Yeah. All right

Speaker 2:          00:29:32       baby. Let's talk about the fact that I'm wearing a Danny shirt, even though it almost all went to shit.

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       You're going to talk about that on the air. Should I not? I mean, unless you want to her Danny's feelings. No, I don't want to have days. You can't do that. Okay. He basically just did. Long story short, there was a miscommunication on the order. Yeah. You're going to get mad at Danny about it. He said he's trying to fix it. Yeah. I mean we, we in a shame, the guy was, it was an honest mistake. I think jeans, he's, it's a language barrier thing. He speaks English. Yeah. But not perfect. It's a second language for poor Danny. Yeah. What's his real name? I mean, as good as the real Eric and I, his name, big words.

Speaker 4:          00:30:19       Um, his real name. I don't know where you go actually. I deal with Alex. Oh, so it's Alex's fault. Yeah, but he speaks fluent English. Well, it's fine. We're all good. We're all good. You're right. I shouldn't try to make it. I'm not trying to, I'm just going to tell the story, you know, and I know, but yeah. Fed Ju Ju yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:30:41       Can we talk about our Sushi experience, please? Okay, yeah, go ahead. Well, we went to a new place in our new neighborhood. It's supposed to be like a really nice, and it is a really nice place in the, the fish was amazed, like it was so good.

Speaker 4:          00:30:56       Yeah. It's, um, it's also like very popular. This is one of the, uh, I would say it's on lists, you know, it's like on the foodie lists. Write it up. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:31:06       Which is why we were so excited to go in and try it. And we got a babysitter and all that stuff and we went in and we did all Mcausey, which is where the chef brings you what he select. So we're like, great, let's keep a common bro. Like, and we should point out

Speaker 4:          00:31:21       that when we do usually go to Sushi, we never do. I'm a Casa because, you know, we know what we like. Is that what I said? I think that's what you said. Oh my gosh. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um, we always know what we like and we go, no, do you know, we'll do this, we'll do this or, but this time we handed it over, we go, do you guys do it? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:31:41       Well what happened was everything was great. It was great. Amazing. But they parceled it out like two bites at a time. They're like, here's two more bites. And you're like, I'm fucking, let's eat man. When are we going to eat?

Speaker 4:          00:31:56       And it would be like, they were like, okay, so you're going to get all these things right. So the first thing that comes out as a plate, we'd get a plate and it has two pieces of fish on it. Delicious. So eat two bites. Yeah. And you're like, great. And it kind of sits like five minutes. Yeah. Take it back. A new plate too and too, God, bye bite. Yeah. And then these are a few more minutes. Next play. I was like four pieces.

Speaker 3:          00:32:22       Oh my God. I'm infuriated. And you got even the bigger, even me as a Nibbler, I even, I was hungry as a leveler. Yeah. Yeah. And you got the, the extra helping of it, even dude. And it was not enough food. It's so, it was

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       clearly not enough. So when it was done, I was like, hey, we need that menu. Yeah. And they came back with it and they're like, oh, well what do you need? And I was like, a bunch, a bunch more Sushi. And then there was a table next to us of this big, uh, big, like Ozzy broad. And then her, um, Japanese friends, Japanese friends, and they're like, oh, isn't it great here? I was like, yeah, it is. It's really good. But you know, it's just not enough. And then pork or goes, uh, uh, uh, you don't think so, right? Clearly thought so too. Yeah. She's like, she's like, I think it's an a, and I go look fatty. You're not fooling anybody. You're, you're on my team. Right. We both know this is not enough food. You're not satisfied. Don't act like you're satisfied. Because she started to try to like make it seem like, oh, you don't think it's enough food. I think it's plenty of food. Right. It was like you're way over to bills. There's no way you think this is hungry as shit too. She looks hungry at all hours of the day, but the only person that looks satisfied was her Japanese friend who's used to probably eating that way and was like, oh, everything's pretty looked like she was came out of an internment camp though. Right. She's just like, oh, we get our ration.

Speaker 3:          00:33:54       Right. Yeah. That's how I felt like they were throwing a scraps and I had to eat it so fast to get to know him the next day.

Speaker 4:          00:34:00       Just scrap was going to come. Sushi wise I do. My whole thing is just keep it coming.

Speaker 3:          00:34:06       Yeah. We order like a trough. I need, I need, I need them to just keep dropping the plates, you know, so that the table is just covered in snow and then we just eat our way through it and then we, we waste because we can't even finish it. That's when I'm happiest. Yeah. A few pieces left and they go, you want that and you can, I can't, but the roles are the ones that I've, I don't feel bad wasting roles. Yeah. You don't want to waste the fish.

Speaker 4:          00:34:32       Yeah. I will go back to that place and now we know the rule. We go absolutely. Alica yes. And we go, do you have a pen and paper? Because you're going to need it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:34:42       Can I tell you what? I don't either. I like Amaa Ebi. That sweet shrimp. Yeah. But I liked him to fry the heads. Don't do then they didn't do, it's a weird thing. That was very upsetting because I like those fried fish heads. Yeah. I know. Anyway, that, oh gee man. Yeah, I'm Asian. I know. Uh, but that was so far. I know. I've never, I've never eaten somewhere. And then Anne, and I mean this in all seriousness, how do the full meal, and then I was ready to go to in and out. You were right. I was like, let's go to the fucking Internet. But we didn't, but we didn't. Yeah. Well, pat on the back of that. Yeah, I was. I really wanted to, but I didn't. I know, cause I knew that somewhere that actually said it like four or five times. I know I'm serious, but that's how normal people eat is they just eat one meal even though it's parceled out, like you know you're in a refugee camp. Yeah. No, no, no, no. Yup, Yup, Yup, Yup, Yup, Yup, Yup. What do you think your dad would have done there? Oh my God. Well first of all, you

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       Sushi a buddy.

Speaker 3:          00:35:41       We went out with your dad for dinner so that we had dinner with your folks. Just the four of us, two nights in a row, everybody left after Ellis is baptism and your parents stayed behind for a couple of days and we had them over at the house one night and the next night we went out. And what I noticed was your dad, there's a few topics your dad loves to. Favorite ones, murder, killing and death. Actually three favorites. Yeah. Killing death. Murder. Yeah. It was pretty intense. He talks about death the first night. Well he goes, yeah, what was the first night that was, but I'm on his, his brother passed, right.

Speaker 4:          00:36:19       Brother dying and details and like I a, I went to the funeral home and like picking out the casket and all of that. My mom was like, come on like weird. Like this is a nice meal about like, all right. Then the next night he goes, uh, what kind of gun are you going to get? Ellis? And I go, he goes like for his first gun. And then I got, uh, I don't know, he was probably 22 or something. I go, yeah, you don't step it up, you know, and then get them like, I dunno, maybe a glock at some point and then, uh, you know, 45 I get what I really want to get them as a 50 caliber. It was like, ah, and it like prompted something in him. He goes, Vietnam, we had these 50 cows too, too heavy to carry. She put him in the back of like a, I don't know, some type of a truck or something.

Speaker 4:          00:37:05       One day, like sky coming out over the field. And you just kind of launched these fee. I was like, Oh man, like he just gets, he gets lost in this story. And then something did it. Like somebody cut them off. Like my mom said, oh we've got to go do this. And I was like, Hey, you didn't finish that 50 caliber story. And he was like, Huh? I go the story about the 50 caliber, the guys on the field. He's like, Oh yeah. And I go, so what happens if you hit him with it? He goes, oh, you hit him in the show where they die. Oh my God. Like I still want like

Speaker 3:          00:37:35       the full story. That's another phone call we should make and be like, what's up with the physical it? Well, and then it was a nice treat, a dinner. We went to the final dinner, the final dinner and you know, we had pictures from the baptism and it was beautiful and we, we had this wonderful week, actually, your whole family was great. You know, my family. And, and then he starts talking about

Speaker 4:          00:37:56       hospital deaths, malpractice suits, and all these horrific stories.

Speaker 3:          00:38:04       And they're all about like pregnant women giving birth. I'm like, could you not? Yeah. And then he goes to put acid on a woman's vagina by mistake. I'm like,

Speaker 4:          00:38:15       yeah. And then he's like, guy brought her daughter in and then my mom was like, and what happened? She died anyways. How are you going to bite that kind bite them that buddy like right from like the death to like, what's that? Is that good? Yeah. Uh, I'd have loves talking about that course we don't want. And

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       that's where you get it from. That's your love of murder and stuff. Yeah, that makes sense. You're becoming your dad.

Speaker 11:         00:38:42       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:38:42       You're red dead. Hope he answers. Please answer. Are you asking about the Vietnam story? Want to hear about the 50 caliber cause he didn't, he didn't really finish the story.

Speaker 11:         00:38:53       Oh yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:38:55       Answers. Oh No. Bummer. Okay.

Speaker 11:         00:38:59       By the way,

Speaker 4:          00:39:01       I just need to sit down with you and do it. It's been forwarded. It's going to be an audio only episode. Yeah, but we have a full top dog Charlie episode. DEPA right. We're going to release it like a regular episode. We'll talk before it. It will only be audio cause this doesn't make sense to like, yeah, I have video of us just introducing it, you know? Yeah. Or so that'll hopefully, maybe I will try to do that for next week or so. Okay. Um, yeah. So yeah, he does love death.

Speaker 3:          00:39:27       A lot of death. Chad. That's on his mind a lot, Huh? Yeah. Yeah. It's really killing, killing, killing cat and he drinks. It's so funny. He was over here. They came from the airport and I was like top dog. Do you want to go back to the hotel and change into something more comfortable? He's like, I am comfortable. Always. Always wasn't Khakis but down shirt. Yeah. Tie loafers, loafers. You want to get some control? I am comfortable buddy. It sounds funny. If that's what he wears it on a Sunday afternoon. You know what I love about your dad is um, anything could be going on and he doesn't give a fuck. Like, he'll still just sit on the couch and watch CNN, even though there's a house full of people and dogs running around and like any kind of event, if he hasn't feel like paying attention, he doesn't. Yeah, I really respect that.

Speaker 4:          00:40:15       Yeah. And his whole thing too. If you go like, what's the why? You know, what are you, why aren't you like over here? He's like, I'm bored.

Speaker 3:          00:40:25       Which is true. Yeah. I agree. I get bored too. Yeah. I'm going to start doing that from now on. Just pulling the top dog. Yeah. I just want to watch Netflix right now. I want to fucking talk to you guys. Yeah. And you go, I'm going to do that.

Speaker 4:          00:40:37       You don't want to talk to you go. You don't wanna talk to so and so. And he'll go, they bore me straight up. We'll just tell you that right

Speaker 3:          00:40:44       person bores me. Yeah. He keeps the 100 genes. Do you want me to play this song you say? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:40:51       Um, so as we all know, there's a problem with people sharing too much on social media. And finally somebody wrote a song about it and this is it right here. Um,

Speaker 12:         00:41:07       I could love this. I mean they really wrote a song. Yeah, it's a good song. Your Business. Facebook,

Speaker 2:          00:42:11       there's a oversharing problem for sure. Talked about it for a long time. Many years we've discussed this problem. Yes. And a shout out to the s CG church version of Qbo business off of Facebook. I love it. Yeah, it's, yeah. You don't need to share everything. That's interesting. There's really no shame left in our society now. I mean, everything is on the table all the time. It's so crazy. How are we going to teach our kid about that? You have to tell him not to send Dick pics to people. That's a big thing now, but imagine doing it. But I may have done it if I had, well, if I had a healthier hog on me, I would have. Here's the thing about photographs is that you can't really tell scale of decks, but if I had a real hammer on me, there's no way you could keep keep it off.

Speaker 2:          00:42:58       You know, you couldn't have convinced me to not send it if I was like really equipped. There's no way you could been like, now do you understand? It's only the shame of like somebody seeing this petite little lights that I, uh, I wouldn't, wouldn't send it so silly. It's not a petite light switch babe. Yeah, it is. It's not, it looks like, it's like, it's a little noisy. It's like, you know how when people get a hair on their tongue and then they go and they pull it off? That's like my whole deck was that I was like, I got the fuck. Am I talking? Yeah, that's my Dick. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think so.

Speaker 2:          00:43:41       Oh, gross is my vagina. Now that I've had a child, like how disappointing is it now? That's great. It totally different. I feel like it's totally different. It's all blown out and no, no, I got ma meat sandwich. Yeah. Loose meat sandwich. Yeah. No, it's great. It's great. Well then your tiny painter and my loose meat fits together. Well, you know, that's how it goes together. You would have sent your Dick Pics to checks if you had the technology? Oh my God, Dude. No, I had, uh, all joking of size aside, I, I have a, um, you know, a shame, a nude shame. Maybe it was all the Catholic upbringing. I wouldn't have, I don't think I would have. Interesting. I would never do that. I wouldn't know. But I would, I think in terms of also just blackmail, you know, like I said, in my mind, I wouldn't ever do that to somebody, but I don't trust that somebody wouldn't do that to me. Oh, right. So you're saying, yeah, I feel that there's enough fear in me that somebody would use that against me. Yeah. They would scare me into not sending it. But that's the thing. If you don't put your face, thank you, Betsy. If you don't put your face in the picture, then who cares? That's true. I think that's the one, the one way you have to do it. I don't know. Yeah, I dunno. Blue Banner of this generation. Your friends are sending their Dick pics everywhere. Did you ever send it?

Speaker 13:         00:45:08       Uh, I've never sent one. I have had friends that sent it. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:45:13       I have the diverse, uh, so whenever requests for you to send one, like they go send me a dick pic? No. No. Hmm. Have you ever seen like, has anyone ever been put on blast so to speak and then you saw their dick pics and they didn't want you to

Speaker 13:         00:45:28       actually found out that one of my best friends, I went to a comedy show with uh, one of my friends, girlfriends and uh, found out during the show, the comedian asked if anyone had sent like how to dig book sent to them and uh, my friend's girlfriend like rose her hand or raise your hand, raise your hand. And uh, it turned out that she was talking about my friend and I found out at that showed that my friend sent her a dick pic.

Speaker 2:          00:45:57       Hmm. I'm a little confused. I didn't follow that and say that. I just pretended like I did. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         00:46:03       Well I found out during your show that my buddy sent his current girlfriend addiction.

Speaker 2:          00:46:07       Okay. Yes. Now. All right. My last girlfriend. Yeah. No. Was it like how he quartered her? Uh, it was in the very early stages. Okay. And had been going out for a very long time at that point. From what I understand, a lot of women don't care about the Dick Pic. I personally, I've seen, you know, what you see all the time on social media. Don't send me a dick pic in bias. Yeah. Black people are like, don't send me a dick pic. Yeah. So I think women get bombarded with Dick Pics and they'd probably just trashed them. Oh my God. I don't think it's a thrill. It's only maybe something to get really into it. You definitely know sending it, there's something intriguing about the person, but if you're just getting unsolicited Dick Pics, I'm sure you're just like, okay, I am, I don't get sent. Never got careful what you say, please don't send me your deck pegs.

Speaker 2:          00:46:58       I really don't want them. Yeah. Uh, but I feel like it's a particular type of lady. Maybe you get, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Not In the married 40 year old kinds. You never know. You never know. That's where it had two girls send their snatches, their snapchat. I think it's far less. I mean, I'm sure that that happens, but you don't really see, I mean I've, I haven't seen any of my friends by, I was like, stop with the pussy pierced. Yeah, yeah. No, no, I don't see that. Um, I don't know. You see nudes? I Dunno. I've had friends be like, oh, I'm this girl that I'm seeing just sent me this. But it's usually not like my leg open. It's like a girl, you know? But it's not just her snatch isn't it? It's not just, no, no. It's not like here's this pussy for no, no, no.

Speaker 2:          00:47:45       Yeah, because women don't, we don't, I don't think that way. I think dudes are like, you're in my dick because the other guys that's enticing to gay men, but not women to be a gay guy. Oh, I know. And just be like, look, it was cock this guy just, I mean, when Grindr happened, do you think the gay community, just as your backflip, like this is what the movement's about. This is what we've been wanting to do. I mean it started in the gay community and then came, what's that shit? Tinder, but it started as grinder was first. For sure. You could just be like, who's in? Who wants to fuck in my neighborhood? Who was five miles from here or two miles at once to blow me? Oh, that guy. Yeah. I mean like for the casual, I got to get this load out.

Speaker 2:          00:48:31       That's is the most magical because he used to just have to go down to the park and stand in a particular area. Right foot, three times restroom stall and just see what happens. I know now it's like, yeah, those guys get to go like, here's what I look like. And you know how judgmental too. It's like, it's like, look at me, I'm yoked. Oh my God, you better be looking like this too. Oh my God. Then you'll find that like your equal and you're like, you can blow me so much pressure to be a gay man. I don't think I can. Thank God. Lesbian seemed to be a bit more forgiving. If I ever, I could not, I could not hang. No. Well, you'd have to be a bear. I could, hey in my lane, but I couldn't hang with like, you know the guys pretend if you age, like you can't be over 30 and the gay community as being a straight woman, you see so many, especially in La, older gay guys that look like older straight women as far as the other crazy face backs and the lip and you're like, dude, you look insane.

Speaker 2:          00:49:34       But it's because of that pressure probably the more so than anything pressure on yourself. Right? So to maintain the look. But you see that a lot in la, like old, older gay guys with ridiculous plastic sir. Look, amaze. No. Who looked, who looked like it? They went too far. I would say in south beach it's even worse. You're right. Go down to Miami and everybody that roller blades by everybody that roller blades by, they have calf implants, ass implants, the cheek and then everybody looks so fucking weird. I was in south when I was in south beach. Everyone was on the beach and I saw somebody vomit and I go, what happened? They go, I just looked at your body. You and I so disappointed. We used to go down to Miami. We were like the, you know the Canadian pigs. Oh look, the Midwestern couples slobs. Are

Girls are topless wearing thongs that are, that are like sheer, like it's see through thongs. Yeah, and they have just perfect bodies. The dudes are super yolked jogging on the beach. It's Puerto Rican guys. What their gold chains jogging. I remember every morning that heat, the sweltering heat, it's 102 out there. It's just to show off. Your body plays all day every day. Remember, if you can't get laid here, you can't get lazy. That's my dad told you. My Dad called. Your Dad told me that. Yeah. When we went to south beach together. Told me going to get laid here. You calculate anywhere. That's nice, but I can't get laid to your father in law. Yeah, that's good advice. Right?

Speaker 16:         00:56:02       Oh my God. If you would like a free sample with no strings attached, you can test drive the sports model. I'm willing to consider any kind of strictly friendly sports. You can decide how strictly or how friendly I want to. Tough chick. Who's not afraid of guys? If you get urges to beat a man, I might get yours to let you win. If you're willing to practice strictly friendlies Fords until you achieve perfection. The fucking Tom for a challenge.

Speaker 2:          00:56:34       What the fuck is he talking about? What does it look what he's talking about? Why don't you describe this guy to our list? He looks a little like a skinny Lemmy. And what's he wearing? He looks a little GGL Anish just on black tennis shoes. Tennis shoes with white socks and just some black black like biker shorts. And he's got on some really cool sunglasses. Right? And he's got the Lemmy from Motorhead. Creepy. Uh, like Fu Manchu. Yeah, it's on. And he's got a paddle in his hand and he's got fingerless gloves, which is always a sign of sanity. If you're wearing fingerless gloves. Yeah. You've got your life together. Everything is going well. Exactly. Yes. I agree.

Speaker 16:         00:57:14       I was thinking about wrestling and spank you, Frisbee out the public park, you and your friends can they have a stone rope and contest if you're willing to make and use the left. So one layer, Susan Haag ties me the fastest wins.

Speaker 2:          00:57:29       I like a lot about this guy. First of all. Yeah, I do like that he is putting out there what he's into and just he just going to take right. What do we know when he gets back? He'll have his choices. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is, this is his version of swipe left and right. Right. Cause I, I'm, I'm all good. Thank you. Um, and he also is, is uh, you know, gear wise he's on top of it. Yeah. There's a very specific audience that this appeals to and he's going to find it. He's going to find it. It sounds like there's a lot of codes, code, wording that I, I'm not really understanding. Like this guy needs a high population city by the way. Yeah, they are. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. South La. What code words are you, are you struggling with like Lasso? How I understand that's what it feels like. There's some code in there. It's implied that um, we're not, we're not going after cattle, right. One after me. Right. So he's um, he has his own version of sports, right? Yeah. Right. Oh boy. You got that paddle too and saying, oh boy, I might be inclined to let dad was under this stuff. This is probably someone's dad for sure. I hope it's someone's dad. Who's, who's listening to this show right now. They're like, where did they hit?

Speaker 16:         00:58:47       You can have a bring your own belt party belt blindfold me. Then take turns with in me nothing. And I'll decide which woman has the best skills.

Speaker 2:          00:59:00       Maybe it's the cadence that's an alarm. It's annoying and he knows so much what he wants. And I know these aren't the fantasy was like, you know what, I've always wanted a woman know what me, he's done this hundreds of times and uh, he just can't get that adrenaline rush anymore so he's just like, I'm putting it out there man. It's opt in. Opt in up. Yes. Yeah, you're right. This is a very specific, this guy. No requests. I want you to last. Oh me and we're nine inch heels and leather and yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 16:         00:59:30       Grass. I like my is you can make a special request. You can practice self assertion with me. What do you like to tough enough when you're a sissy, check it. This is why I don't understand. You definitely need self assertion encouragement. I'm sorry you're still undecided. There's more hands after this. Now let's get to tell you

Speaker 2:          00:59:53       what's self concerns. Oh Man. There's definitely some dead animals in his house and I will say, I will say, yeah, I like his background choice. I like his audio. There was no birds chirping. Yeah, he is a good mic. It was a clean video. So he had some help with production as I mentioned. I think he has a clean diet. I mean that's not a bad body. He's definitely fit. No. Yup. Would you, would you think a date with him would be absolutely terrifying for me? Yes. A self assertion? Is that what you're talking about? Self insertion? No,

Speaker 16:         01:00:29       the fuck you're a sissy check or a shot chick. You definitely need self assertion encouragement. So it's like dom stuff. Okay. Now let's get tell you. Oh Man, this guy's guys

Speaker 2:          01:00:42       big time. Yeah. Huh? I guess, um, when BDSM people go, well, why don't we get a bad rep? Well, I would say because of the time right here, I think Tom is the type of guy that gives you a bad rap. He won't respect your pronouns. Oh Man. Oh Man. But he would love for you to whip him and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I, again, I see myself, I could do that, but I don't, I don't know. I don't need it to be sexual for somebody else. Right. It's just an anger thing for me. Maybe. I don't know. But what if he's just like, yeah, but I get off on it. So I liked that part and I want them to, Tj's on me or anything he's not going to do is on you. He do it on the floor or something. That part creeps me out. Why Tom came all this way.

Speaker 10:         01:01:29       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:01:29       He can't just crank one out in the carpet. It's a very, it's a very specific world to inhabit. You got to know a lot of lingo. There's a lot of, a lot of stuff you have to buy. Yeah, it's too much.

I had to call my actual mom who's from Trinidad to help them with the ending of this translation.

Speaker 4:          01:09:40       She was crying from laughter at Youtube. And if you find any more videos like this one or the Trinidadian, um, from last year, we will be happy to help.

So go down union, he passed. So, but he goes, he passed so past, sorry. Right. Soap, go down, union, keep following the road straight. Go across the bridge and go down and keep going. Straight. Go on. Don't bother to turn. And then the guy in the car says, just go straight. Just past the, uh, the back, the Balaclava, not sure. Balaklava station, that's what I said. And go over the bridge and go straight and you're going to go down, you're going to pass something, uh, and you're going to go further. So that's basically what's going on here.
