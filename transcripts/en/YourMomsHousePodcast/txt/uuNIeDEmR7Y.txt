Speaker 4:          00:05:58       and juggle that look. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 2:          00:06:03       Oh, it's Randy. Don't bring anyone loving. Well, go to your mom's house

Speaker 4:          00:06:16       saying, you know what I'm saying? Just talking about it. Yeah, I know. Funny. It is funny. I feel like we need that back in our lives. We kind of phase it out for him and we go through cycles. We did go through, is this guy a Juggalo? Exactly. Yeah. Your Fridge. I Collette. Yeah. Yeah. From Queen. No, I'm saying, you know saying yeah man. You know what I'm saying? Well I'm saying, I will say he's got some of the criterion for a perfect your mom's house video. Let's review. Sure. Well man motherfuck would clown looks. I'm from Florida, so right away. Okay. Location, location, location. Where is he located? He is in a bathroom. C Tile over here. I think he's might be on the toilet. Yeah. It's probably taking a shit. He is not wearing clothing on top. No, and I don't. Does he have nipples?

Speaker 4:          00:07:04       Are they just tucked in somewhere? I don't know. He's got he's, he's got a horrible framing. Terrible underneath 10 close to came to see the top of his head. It's framed forehead to mid chest. It's from below beneath you, which is never good. Yeah. Um, also I will say the one thing that doesn't meet the requirements. Yeah, the lighting's decent. Why did decent, I was going to say sounds not bad, but I want to make sure, I think there's some background, either television or radio on or there's something on, here we go, man, my fucking went clown La from Florida. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'm playing in the background right there. Check. Sorry. Ideal way to record something is always to have other things playing in the background for your audio. Again. Yes, yes. And Queen. No, I'm saying Sean Garden, be skin showing Barbie Fitch. You can be anywhere between, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 4:          00:08:04       I just need some man, motherfucker Wiki and juggle that look. You know what I'm saying? If Yo, oh, he's got a missing tooth up here, well that goes without saying that all of a sudden raises the points. You know, like he was, there you go. You were going to say? Yeah, the lighting's pretty good, but well I'm counting three, maybe three that are gone from the top. Yeah, so that that does meet the requirement. Sure. Three shop, three top teeth are missing. You get more points than three bottoms. Why is that Tom? Well, it's like you can, you can miss some bottoms, hit someone with a smile and they might not even realize it. You'll miss it. That was the talk to you for a while. I'm like, oh, that guy doesn't have some bottom. Sure you're missing top teeth. People know right away. Oh, world sees it.

Speaker 4:          00:08:48       So that's kind of cool. Yup. Yup. I'm also check check another box for the unreasonable ask [inaudible] which is a huge part of a perfect why mh video and his ask is to find a perfect woman for him. He's a catch. Yeah. Boy. He to his credit though, you know he wasn't, he was just like, you don't have to be skinny and you don't have to be fat. He was just like, I want love. That's kind of actually nice. That is neat. And yet to be a juggle. Let, well, I mean that's somebody that's also smart because what he's saying is I prefer somebody who has similar interests. That's really what he's saying, St. Cloud. But at least he's not like, you know, and you gotta be a doctor, like he's saying, he's saying be would be into what I'm into. That's smart, you know, be into being a dumb shit.

Speaker 4:          00:09:36       Like Damn Shit. Talk like I talk all dumb and Shit, you know. But he is, I think actually, you know, maybe Kyle Dunnigan could learn if a couple of things, his profile and, and you know what I will say of all the unreasonable mail requests for females, this one is probably the kindest. Yeah. He seems actually pretty nice that we've had, have all our suitors. Yeah. I might give this Juggalo a chance. We had to rank Christine when just done again, calling you Christine. Thanks Todd. If we, if I could rank my suitors. This guy is now at the top of the tooth lists suitors. Yeah. There's a number of them. The whisper was probably the, the worst. That guy that was whispering into his ladies. I was about to vomit. We had no teeth when he was, oh my God, he was at singing to her and he had the rotting teeth. That was pretty bad. That was the worst one. I, but at least he wasn't a deck like he was trying to woo her. But the guy with the no teeth and he's always watching television and

Speaker 5:          00:10:46       oh I can't I please, why are you doing this? [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:11:09       bad to these two fees. Bad. Cause if there's like a big crunch factor, that's what setting you off a little bit too. Well and it's so up close to camera work. They all have bad teeth, but I don't have to see it so close. It's true. You might like whispering and singing in her ear. Yeah, it's really, yeah. Yeah. So you're saying that bothers you some? That's the top. The top, nastiest really. Well I just, I don't, here's the deal. Here's the deal, man. That guy's nasty as to hate that guy. But this guy will really insist on romancing me and singing to me. My favorite part, my bad at all. Whenever I talked to blue band about these videos. This guy, cause you know a lot of people, we don't have names. Yeah. He'll just, he'll blue blue bag just goes, oh I got some more of the, I'll make it calm guy.

Speaker 4:          00:12:13       So he'll go, he calls him the, I'll make you calm guy. Even though we've played countless videos. I'm like, cause I always know what he's talking about. I'm like I know that guy. He's no, no, no, no. We should do is when our guests gets here. Yeah. Let her see all these and then she has to choose. Yeah, that's a good idea. She will go with, well I got a suitor that I want you to check out. Actually no, just before she gets it. Cause I want your real take on it. Okay. So this guy, God, he's having a conversation. He's having a conversation right now. We can't hear the other side of it, but there's somebody actually talking to him. So he's not making a recording as a pitch. He's actually in conversation and we have a recording of just his side of it. You have to imagine what the other is saying, but it's, it really gets going. I mean, just, just imagine who's on the other side of this and what they're saying because here's what he is saying.

Speaker 6:          00:13:21       Okay? You would be required to make daddy call. Is that understood? And it would be done in a way, but you want to do either with your body or a friend of yours, that's your girl, that you can sell it with picture and say daddy stroke to her. All right. Or a video that you found or something that you think will make daddy score, but that is like a hundred percent on your shoulders. I trust that, that my baby will know daddy well enough to know how to get daddy to come. That's a big responsibility for you.

Speaker 4:          00:14:05       How do you feel so far? You know that scene we play when Josh Potter comes, that woman crying. That's how I feel. Really. I don't like that one at all. You don't like it? It's so gross, Babe. What's the part you don't like? Just the everything. That guy's a scary

Speaker 6:          00:14:22       like it is making sure you're always sage. No thank you. Secure. Making sure your daddy's there 24 hours a day for you. Making sure you're not making stupid mistakes. All right. Make sure that your grades are good, right? You sure that your relationships in your life are solved and making sure that when you melt down and have a bad night, I am there all night long with you.

Speaker 4:          00:14:47       Sounds like a little not healthy fantasy.

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       Hmm. I don't like it. Well here's a neat thing now if you want, look on the bright side, he checks a lot of the boxes. Have a great video for this show. Background is horrendous. The background is a disaster and I think doctor drew, if he were here would be like this guy might have a little sense of delusion going on. Lots of it. Yeah. It doesn't appear that he has a headboard or any kind of framing on the bed. It doesn't look like he has even a nightstand. There are just boxes or books and things on the floor. I need somebody in nightstands. I mean where does he put like his glass of water or his phone? Like just a bunch of shit on the ground. Uh, he's lit from the computer screen. Uh Huh. Um, it's tear. At least he has a shirt on, which is disappointing. It's really disappointing. Just this would be a rock and roll hall of Famer if he were shirtless. He has his teeth again, bomber upsetting, but he's uh, he's kind of much scarier than the other guys. It's demonic and, and it seems like he wants to own somebody has the ask is, is really a lot. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:16:03       but you get that will surpass any thing you've got. Cause it's all conditioning. It's not based on how you, the stop based on your performance intimately. It's not based on your makeup before your clothing or where you live or your upbringing. It's based on you being my baby and me being responsible for making sure you're always okay.

Speaker 3:          00:16:36       That seems nice. All this to make him calm, everything is related to coming. Right. It's so elaborate. Like it's just to make him calm. Never stops it. No.

Speaker 7:          00:16:50       Ah Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:16:55       Like do you realize how much energy this man is putting towards getting what he needs? Just to have a good orgasm and he's not a young guy. Here's a man that old, right? He's not an elderly man in his fifties I'm guessing. So is is coming really that big of a priority. It is interesting though that the late like to him, he doesn't want to go out to a bar and and or sure reduced to a woman who could make them come because that woman's not going to be at he, he needs it to be a submissive, he needs a baby. Yeah. Pacific. And so he's got like a really interesting, uh, psyche and mind game that needs to happen. Yeah. This is definitely a drew thing. I want to put this on the list. Yup.

Speaker 6:          00:17:42       Do you love the idea of having the daddy there for you? I'm going to fucking be here. Okay. Okay. Can we stop this? Is there a

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       my time is with you. You got to take care of Daddy's cock. Okie dokie. I'm done. Thank you. It sounded like a nice pitch for a second. It was like, I'll always be there for you no matter what. You know, all these things. But then he, he, he tagged it with you got to take care of Daddy's cock, you know? Okay, this is what you need to decide because I can't spend all my time with you. Shut off every other baby that's interested and then not emptied on a regular basis out. There we go get emptied talk and daddy will get hard and you should send us that. We'll know that and know, okay, I need to fix daddy. Yeah, it's real weird. So creepy. Why has it got to be in the terms of data? I can like it and his skin looks like it's going to peel off and this does have bad skin, which again, bonus, but you know, it looks like really rang a shirt, but you do have really bad skin.

Speaker 3:          00:18:58       It really enhances the look more the part that daddy's got it. I got out since this is daddy gets mad at you for reasons I shouldn't be mad at you. Dope. So this is where you need to at least be mature enough. Even any framing to accept that responsibility, to have that response except the rules. The daddy was up for you. Such a big responsibility. What fucking website? This is not how you normally, uh, court people. Jeez. I thought a Craig's list ad used to suffice and this guy has got real demands happening. I mean, are you turned on? I think my vagina just sewed itself shy. It just imploded on itself. How? I don't understand. I really don't have to know how these people have so much time about what makes them come and the specific, the specificity of what makes them calm. It's like, oh, come on.

Speaker 3:          00:19:50       Just stop being fucking weird. You know what I mean? That guy's pretty weird. Oh, he's so nasty, Todd. Yeah. Again, and he also does the same thing that the four, the four stroke guy does, where he repeats himself. He's like, you have to make daddy can't, like, yeah, we know asshole. He careful it. Just a hoard. Yeah. He, he keeps repeating. If I got it, bitch, that's how I feel. I think that was the other side of the conversation as he was doing it. He's like, Daddy, come on, kill myself. Listen. Yeah. Okay. No, I don't like him anymore because I can't spend all my time with shuttle every other baby. That's interesting. Yeah. And then, yeah, you know, but

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       you know what that's like Tom, when you're interviewing babies and they all get your hard and none of them are getting you off like you want and you're like, which one are you? Babies is going to Jack my deck. And it's so frustrating when they don't. Right. It is frustrating. And I want you to understand this is the agreement. I'm going to be there for you, but you've got a sense when I'm hard, this is a reasonable thing. The adult baby people, which we've, we've featured before on your mom's house, uh, the woman who likes to be the baby and then the guy you know, pushes her around in a fucking pram or whatever, they love it. People love this stuff. That's true. Hey, I'm guessing to, we didn't play all the, uh, how, how amazing Regena's video affects face space. Excite my mind's on the Christina p right now on Instagram. If you want to see the ones that didn't get played. Kidding. No. Or at least one. You want to see it? I ain't kidding me. It's what I live for. Look, Julia. That's terrifying. That's me as Joe. That's extra terrifying. Yup. Wow. Oh Jeez. Did we play the urine enema? We did. Right?

Speaker 4:          00:22:01       Yeah. Okay. Rain. I'm going to give myself a urine anima. Um, people, uh, are still continuing to send in their look alike shops. You know, I get so many of Garth, no, no. People who I look just like, oh, right. Yeah. Tom Twin photos. You know, if you're not subscribing to your mom's house on Youtube, please do so immediately so that you can see these photos of people are sending Tom photos. They're like, you look just like this guy happening. The story is this. It's been happening. It's been happening on Twitter, emails, Instagram. People were like, dude, my fucking friend is your twin. Or like my brother looks just like you guys are exactly how your doppelganger and what will be the same is that it's a human male with facial hair. The beard. Yeah. Well that guy, hey man, we're twins. They never do. They never looked a little bit. I can see why he had the dark circles under his, I mean, but you're talking about some features, but people are like, you got to see this. Like you're going to get freaked out. Okay, what is it? There's a guy with a beard. I'm like, okay. And I look exactly alike. No we don't. He's got hands. You got hand. Oh. Oh. And these are just a bunch of dudes and panties. Tight pants. Which ones you again, the black guy. Um, well that's where you're looking at an hour. I know. All I know.

Speaker 4:          00:23:40       Talk to my shrink about it. Clear. And uh, oh, this one. I've gotten a lot. This Dj. That one's reasonable von stroke. Yeah, that's reasonable. It's reasonable enough. Especially when I'm in the DJ gear. So like here he's wearing sunglasses and a hat and a black tee shirt and I'm wearing sunglasses. And a hat and a black tee shirt. And we both have beers with similar. All right. I get it. But I mean come on most of the time, which I mean, it's just a guy. Yeah, it's not your twin. If it's just a guy that doesn't work, that's most people's criteria. Some actress that plays Supergirl. I get sent that one a lot. I'm like, all right. Maybe if I was 20 years younger. Yeah, man, I'm like way cuter. I think she's a little bit curious to me. Mm hmm. Uh, Ben Dover. Fuck.

Speaker 4:          00:24:34       Um, why don't you play that fucking daddy calm guy? No, I'm all traumatized. God. Yeah, I don't like that stuff, man. Here's an email. Hey Tim and Krista, I keep calling. I keep telling Garth to fart on his balls. Every Instagram post I have even asked for his pay pal so I can contribute to his cause, but nothing has gained. Maybe once the mommy's get his attention and he agrees to come on the podcast, you can both fart on each other's balls. That would be my dream come true. But what's wrong with you? Who's writing this? Thanks for everything you do. Truly a mommy kiss on me and try it out. Like code stroke, four times slept. You guys, Travis from British Columbia. You think if we could get Garth on the show, which would be a dream come true that we'd be like this far.

Speaker 4:          00:25:21       Don't each other's balls. Yeah, of course. That's what everybody wants to do. There's no way that would happen. That's what everybody wants to do with Garth Brooks. That's why he's so famous. Don't you know he meets all of his fans after his arena shows and then he farts on all their balls. Okay. Uh, here's another email. Would it do that? I would not. It says, Dear Tanya and Chris Stobo. I'm messaging in regards to that Harry boy who didn't like the toilet paper supplied by his college. I was once in the same shoes as him as a fair low hairy bear. Harry boy. I noticed the half ply bargain shop roles would terrorize my tush and destroy my dupa. So I came up with a unique and cost effective solution, use the handicap showers. There were no handicapped folks in my dorm, so I would simply use the toilet for my Duke. He's before showering. Then simply use the handy dandy movable shower head to spray a geyser of pressurized water up my Coolo thus cleaning my hairy ass deeper than any toilet paper could ever dream of. Try it out. Wa Hunter, now they added more mois or something. Brilliant. Speaking of those, um, the Giulia full throttle stuff has obviously gone full throttle. Um, thank you so much for the,

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       uh, the uh, shirt

Speaker 3:          00:26:46       purchased is everybody loved those. The socks should be up now if they're not checked back in a couple of days, they're good morning Julia socks with the fan zone and, and literally hundreds of videos come in and we just can't play them all. But we did a few other selections here. One thing before we continue on this. Yeah, go ahead. Nothing makes me happier in life. I think in just in general as when silliness is taken very seriously. The fact that every now and then you'll be like, oh my God, you won't believe how many people are purchasing the good morning Julia or the full travel shirts. And it makes me laugh so much and it brings so much joy to my heart because in a world of just, you know what I mean? Real stupid, real things that something like this taking on and, and making people happy.

Speaker 3:          00:27:38       Yeah. That's great. It's just warms me. Yeah, it's really great, right? Yeah. The show is so fun. It's so stupid. Find silly things and then get other people excited. It's so exciting. It's so exciting. That is, that really is was people like, and we all, we're all in the same stupid joke. I just like it. I like it too. I like it too. It makes me laugh. Okay. What do we have? Here's a couple more. Good morning, Joe. It's me, Melissa. So Darlene, you yesterday, outside of the home depot was the greatest moment of my life. There is a fight. It's been sticking in my mind the way you said that you were thinking about mark and another video for Giulia. Go Raisa from your past. So Raisa from your memory, you know, sometimes we think somebody is the right fit for us. We meet them outside of a gym. We exchange phone number as we give off creepy vibes. But see myself having a future with you, fallen in love with you and I think we should go full throttle. Wish you a happy holiday and uh, you know, again, let's go full throttle. Ciao.

Speaker 1:          00:28:38       It's very cute. More with the message to Joe. Yeah. To maybe get over his past here is uh, Michael.

Speaker 8:          00:28:48       Good Morning Julia. I want you to open up your heart. Well, I can do it for you either way. Just want you to know that, that can't wait to wear your skin, my skin and a way your face on my face. And uh, you know, I know you want him to go to get back to the ex boyfriend and I'm just telling you now you can't. All right. You won't be able to find them.

God or handyman store guy. The chair, he talks about so many dumb, like listening to the list now I'm like, oh my God, this guy is. But that's what he was trying to impress Julia with. Right. It's both of it, but it's so calming. Yeah. Like what are you doing? They'd be like, keep talking. God, you did the windows so hot.

Speaker 13:         00:37:59       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:38:03       Right. It's such a strange wooing tactic. It really in his mind when he lists all those, yeah. What's going on on my right. Turning you on. Yeah. And that's his, but that's his angle. He's like, look, I can't go for looks. You know, he's not, he's not going to be like on the hottest guy in town. Right. I'm not the richest guy in town. Right. Uh, but I wake up really early and I build a lot of shit. Right. That's crazy. He's crazy. I really am excited. Now

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       you get our guests to check out these different men and get her take on them. You know, I can't even imagine what leave she's single. Maybe she'll be interested, you know, she probably gets these in real life. Maybe we can ask her. She, she's single and she's in the public. I've heard dms are open. There's definitely some crazy shit going down. She might actually seem like, oh, I remember him. I know this guy. Yeah. Yeah. Well it should be here. She should be here momentarily. Why don't we just take a quick little break here and um, you know, we'll be, uh, we'll be right back and might acuity power. Um, okay. We're back. And you, you, you just said you'll be careful not to kick the tripod, but also we don't have to worry about it because this is the last episode we're doing here. You're the last guest.

Speaker 14:         00:39:27       Okay. Yes. I would appreciate that. You don't do it. It's not just because it's the last one doesn't mean that it should keep still wobble. Wobble. Don't break my shit. You're moving. Yeah. Oh, have you showed people your news sleep studio? They ever see any, oh dude, it's so cool. Pretty slick stuff. Neat state stuff. Raw stuff. So exciting. You're lives are the greatest lives of anyone I know. And I'm just projecting everything that I want your lives to be on too. Slick stuff. Neat stuff. Yes. That's Garth, Garth Brooks one and only course. How can I be relentlessly attack? And it was like, he's so nice. Um, you say that.

Speaker 4:          00:40:14       So you this and I thought this the other day at the comedy store and then Christina is same. Same thing. He said the same thing. You, I feel like you have, you're putting off very, my life is good vibes. I get like that. You got your shit when you have winter vibes.

Speaker 14:         00:40:31       I feel it. I feel good and a lot of people tell me that, that they get that sense from me. But, um, I am definitely on a, I hope it's a trajectory cause I'm not where I want to be yet. Like, you know, it's, it's an I'm going up but, and so it's looking good, but I'm not there yet. In terms of like strictly career, you just mean in life, in all, in all, in all senses, but also career, career actually, I'm like, I'm very happy. It doesn't get any better. It's fine, but it's definitely going to get better because that's just where it's going. And that seems fine too. But, um,

Speaker 4:          00:41:05       I just remembered that when I saw you the other day, but like a few months ago, he's like at the store and you're like, I'm about to do this thing. That'll probably, I just can't. I was like, what? And you're like, I'm, and I was like, what does it, and it was like the next day or two days later, I saw an Instagram. I was like, Nicki was on dancing.

Speaker 14:         00:41:23       It was so random. I'm like, I know that come about. I got a call from, you know, the call you get from your agent and manager will call, call the double call. I got a double call right after I had finished doing radio and a big offer and they're like, we're just calling you to go because I'm making sure you're going to definitely say 10% of both. I have never even thought about it that way. I don't get many office unfortunately, but it at a point in my career where things are going well, when I get the double call, I know it's going to be good news as opposed to bad. No one is calling to drop me right now. That'll come, doesn't know where it goes away, but they don't do a double phone when you get old like 45 46 but then there was no double for the firing.

Speaker 14:         00:42:06       They pick one cowardly and sometimes they don't tell you at all. True, true. That's another way. But get dropped like that. Once I got dropped by an agent who switched agencies like they're just like, oh, he's gone. And I'm like, but it doesn't even just send the, like, I enjoyed my time working with you. I'm moving to keep a connection there where now and now you see them and you're like, hey man. Oh, there's so many people like that that just when you, when you're coming up and you're nobody and they treat you badly because you're nobody, and then now they're not like the most cliche thing, but it happens. You see it so much and I just go your fake because you were mean to me last time and stub me. What's fascinating is that it's always caught me. Now we're doing this a while, but is that you go like that decorum, that way of being like treating someone is not, it doesn't exist in any other business.

Speaker 14:         00:43:02       You know what I mean? Like if you worked in finance or sales and like a manager moves on, you would call like your team and be like, I enjoyed working with you. I'm leaving to work at this other company. It's almost a form letter for that. There's a way to that's conducting business in that business. But it's so funny, the rules that we do all have to adhere by, which is um, you know, managers don't poach like a certain rules like that. They have their own stuff. It's game on. It's so weird to me that there's this, it's, it's not, it's an unwritten rule, but it's a rule that with managers, you can't talk to another manager if you currently have a manager, but the agents don't adhere to that rule. It's not the same rule. Why does that not go for both of us?

Speaker 14:         00:43:51       I think because the managers, except that they're supposed to be your partner slash. Friend. Well, they're the long haul. It's the long haul. The agents except that it's a numbers thing making money and it's more personal. It's family that's supposed to, that's why I'm like, okay, well that makes sense. The agents are fish, dysfunctional family and that's also the tactic is like we're family now so that way they get away with murder. With ew gross business. I recently had to leave someone that I didn't have a problem with. It was just like time to move on. Yeah. And nothing personal note like it was so hard, but she handled it so incredibly just no bitterness and you get worried in those situations. It's like when you break up with someone in their main and you're like, oh, I'm glad I broke up with you, cause your announcers.

Speaker 14:         00:44:48       But um, she was just like, and I'm like, you're one of the good, well I'm glad that I knew it was such a thing. Made me feel so good. She's smart because guess what? I might come back or rent and people change jobs and change all the time. Yeah. That's why I always tell people when they don't get picked for this thing or that thing in our business, it's like, dude, don't worry, the gatekeepers change every few years. If you don't get this thing now, guess what, that person's going to go somewhere else and that person's going to get hired. That might like you wait a little bit longer and nice to every night. Yeah. He cool a doorman who are executives of course or Adam Devine's doorman became Adam divine. He was a doorman and then Improv. Yeah. And know that. But that's true. I mean like anyone offer him, but yeah, I hear he's doing all right.

Speaker 14:         00:45:42       I think he's, he's always been the sweetest. Sweetest. Yes. Always the sweetest. I that's the advice I always give up and coming comedians. Um, when they, you know, they asked you for advice to the MC is working for your or a guest set. It's like, well, can I get some advice? Which I'm always annoyed by it because I never did that to anyone. I never asked Comedians for advice. Did you guys do that? Did you ask them to watch your sets? Did wise. Here's why I did it too though. Phyllis Diller. All right, Phyllis fucking day, but she was nice. She was old. I read her book and I was so inspired. I sent her my set and I wrote her a letter and fucking three days later Phyllis Diller called me, gave me notes on my act and it forever changed what I was doing and everything changed for me. Oh my swearing. She was the nicest lady. That's so cool to shit at that point. Super Sweet. Very rare.

Speaker 14:         00:46:39       Accessibility in social media. Hey Man, I did stand up for the first time. No, no, no, no. Do you have any ideas or feedback how I could work on that makes the mask you're asking me to do right now. I know once a week someone asks us that. All of us that sends their first time on stage, but I always still come. I was like, don't you know the classic advice is do it as much as you can. Do it. Go anytime, go up anytime. You can keep your eyes open to comedy around, but I think essentially the best advice to give a young comic is be cool to be around, have fun, hang, get the comics. We'd, when they come to town, offered a drive them places just be, don't be annoying, but like, hey, if you need anything, I'm your guy. And just be cool because even if you're a mediocre comic and there's better comics than, than you that are annoying, I will bring you

Speaker 4:          00:47:29       on the road as a mediocre comic that you're a funny, if you're a finance and then by bringing on the road, you'll get to be great because you'll get more stage time. So it's like, just be cool that and observe the fucking etiquette of comedy. For instance, if you're invited into the headliners greenroom, don't just bring your friends or your girlfriend, mother fucking person. Oh yeah, dive. We'll bring like, what are you doing? You're not invited a few friends with them. I'm like, are you out of your mind? This isn't yours. Yeah, no, that's, that's your big one. I know you fucking hate that. Or The chatty insane. No Way. No, I emceed shows. I would never be like, hey guys, come back with me. And the would never occur to me. I would never even stepped foot in the green room without like, I'm sorry. Can I do this? Yeah, I'm still working in clubs. So it's like having, you know the gray, you walk, you go to a place in the green room is the author. Oh, I've done, and I know you're talking about grand rapids. We were there together. I was just thinking about you. The Bob, uh, they're walking Hyenas Dallas hole. That is, you are the way, literally fax going on, but there's like still have fax.

Speaker 4:          00:48:49       Yes. Oh yes. I lost my mind. Oh my God. Oh boy. On the shot contest. So for people that don't know, this was the crazy part too, is that the MC goes up, does 10, the feature does 20 and kills. And if you are headlining a show, you go, I want to ride the wave. Like this is what he's supposed to do. He's setting up the show. They go, all right. And you're like, all right man. Great. Bring me up first. We're going to do the blowjob shot contracts, the craziest, and then they brought a table on stage setup shots brought up four people hands behind their back, put your mouth over the shot, hot back. All right. So I go, hey man, could you not do that again all weekend? And he's like, why? And I was like, cause it's terrible and I don't want to be a part of it.

Speaker 4:          00:49:38       And he's like, we always do it. I go, I know, but I don't want anyone. He's like, you're the only person that's ever complained. I go, no, I'm not. I'm the only person that's ever complained to you. I go, everyone, I'm sure it talks about it and he's like, uh, I just, I don't know why you're so upset about it. I'm like, because you're ruining the show. I go, if you insist on doing it, how about you do it between the MC and the feature? Kill the momentum of the show. This guy was like, man, you're really like fired up about this. Then he brings in the other guy and the guy's like, well, here's the, here's why we do it. And then you left because the people who are doing their shots, they each pay like 50 bucks to do that to like be part of the show and do a shot and so it, it pays for my MCC all week. Someone I'm like, I don't care. Hit

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       $50 a person. I'm like, all right man. I go, well I just want you to know how much I hate that you do this. And he's like, okay, all right. Because he kept doing it.

Speaker 14:         00:50:39       They, they are so stuck in their ways and when you ever try to inject like, Hey, I do this for a living and I had a different and other places and I've seen the way it works and it works better when you do it this way. Like something as simple as when they start a show and they're like, give it up for your, and like, are you guys ready to have fun tonight? Give it up for your headliner. Nikki Glaser, first of all, I don't like when they go, she's in the building. Let her here, she's backstage. I'm like, don't tell them where I am. You can do better than that. Oh, I actually, oh my God. I tell them to say that I do. I tell the emcee, I go, I'll get them to do a second round because I, it's never like, it's never not enough.

Speaker 14:         00:51:16       There it is. Like I like, I like that you can do better when I'm about to be brought up, but in the beginning of the show, before the MC ever comes up, they go give it up for your hedler Nikki Glaser. Everyone thinks I'm coming to sage. There's a huge applause, right? Because a lot of people haven't been to comedy shows, don't know how it works. And then they go through the whole roster and they go, yeah, and you're featured act and it's like you, they don't know who this is. Stop acting. A little shout out to our sponsor is a Hampton Inn and the limo guy, but it's just so awkward to sit across from my feature in the green room who had just heard crazy applause for my name because that's who they came to see. And then they have to put grudgingly and then he already, he feels weird. And so I've told them, just can you just say the headliner, but like they'll meet him. Have you played the clubs where they prerecord it? They, they have, they have the, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:52:02       headliners name recorded, but they don't know who their MCS, so it'll go, it's a prerecorded to go and give it up for your Mc.

Speaker 8:          00:52:10       And that's it. The MCS, like Emma and they walk up and they're like, oh, we didn't record your name and who didn't know who because my God,

Speaker 3:          00:52:19       that's the only more horrible thing is when they have the pre roll to the whole event.

Speaker 8:          00:52:26       Now are you ready for this? The clips from like Wayne's world and you're like, I get it. And there's like Billy Madison and then mighty ducks. I'm like, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:52:37       what are you pulling from? I have the best one. There's two gray ones. Okay. There's the comedy zone in Jacksonville, Florida, or it's brilliant down the twilight zone theme and then the strobes. And then

Speaker 8:          00:52:49       there's lawyers, 20 people in a room when you are not drawing. And that kind of bombastic opening. Yeah. I can't see my Nachos. Yeah, we can skip that tonight guy. There's 20 people

Speaker 3:          00:53:03       don't eat it. So my favorite by far is when there's female act, there's a side splitters in Tampa, Bob, Bobby jewel, and they, they run a montage of women's stripping and movies and they're like, you can't leave. Y'All had her home. That's the song. And it's a montage like Demi Moore and the stripper movie and this chick and that chick stripping

Speaker 14:         00:53:26       and welcome to the stage Nikki Glaser. And you're like, they just saw a fucking montage of women with their clothes off and now they're expected to respect me telling them jokes. Oh, have you ever, you're sober. They s that I would hate that so much because I hate being sexualized on stage by the audience in any way. Worse. It happens and usually it doesn't happen, but anytime you take off your jacket it, someone's going to know. Even if a guy does it, I have to say, but I will literally go, I'm about to take off my jacket. Will you guys please not go whoa, like no one can. We all agree to not, I just hate it a lot. I just begged them and they can't not do it. I love it. They can't not do it. And then I feel weird because I feel like I'm trying to be sexy and then I feel like vulnerable in this way.

Speaker 14:         00:54:18       It makes you feel any better. They do the same thing to me. That's what I was going to say. I think they do it to men too.

It's been whispered about for years and now everyone knows. It's kind of cool. Hey

Speaker 1:          00:56:41       single right now we have a lot of single men, suitors, suitors. Oh I need to get your take and maybe what's working, what's not, who you're into, who we could maybe connect you with if you're interested. Yeah, so I'll give you a few. You tell me like turned on. Do you want the number of digits? Scale of one to 10 also want the followup on Baguette. I didn't forget last time you told us about baggage. Oh, why you said I have so much to tell you guys. Okay, well don't forget to tell us and that bag as well. Bag It, you told us. Here's what the story was. The last story was this baguette is a comic in New York. That's your nickname for somebody and you were like friends and you guys would always like jokingly, I, you know, kind of flirt and then you were like, let's hook up. And then he made some excuse or something and then you're like, so what's up with that? Like what was he thinking? And then that's how we got to know. We just, we just guessed, we didn't know. Right. I'm curious. You didn't know that we've, that you don't know the next step. No. Did, nothing had happened with that though at that point. At that point you were like, he left me high and dry. Okay. We hooked up. Ah,

Speaker 14:         00:57:52       then I hooked up and so, okay. This, it was, um, I, I was so frustrated this night. It was like one of the best nights of my life, career wise. And I was like the Belle of the ball. And I'm at a party and he's there too. And I'm like, we're both in a different city and we're staying at the same hotel. And I'm like, I look great, greater than I will ever look. I'm peaking that night and he's just kind of like milling about the party and we're making eye contact here and there and being like, hey, you know, but it uh, it just, he just was talking to everyone else but me, I'm sitting alone at this party. It's tort near the end of the night and there's this girl sitting next to me and, and I'm like this, I was like, I that guy over there, like we have been flirting, I've like got a semi kind of a Dick pic from him.

Speaker 14:         00:58:39       Things are happening and he will not come talk to me. Like, look, he's talking to some two guys that he doesn't even know. I'm like, what's going on? And she's like, honey, if you can't get laid tonight, none of us can. I was like, I know I'm wearing this dress and like I'm dressed to the tens. Like I'm just as cute as I can let, I did TV that night. Like it's impeded your hair and done and do better. And I was the Belle of the ball for this thing that I did. So like everyone at the party is celebrating the things that I do. It's like my words her, it's her Bat Mitzvah. Yeah. It just felt like that, you know, like, and I felt like the Prom Queen Watch that tripod. I, oh gosh, I gotta Watch the tread. Very. Um, so finally we make eye contact and I kind of give a look like, what are you doing at this point?

Speaker 14:         00:59:21       I've, I've been bitching about him to this girl. I'm all worked up and I'm like, I'm done playing it. Cool. I just go, yeah, I flag them in. I go get him, come over here. Any comes over. And I'm like, what are you doing? And he's like, I don't know man. I don't know. And then I'm like, city or talk to me. So we talked for like 20 minutes and then he's like, I'm going to go and I'm like, I'm going to go to, and I'm like, Oh my God, I'm going to get like I'm about to go hook up for the first time in like ever like forever sober having like I'm going to maybe like get laid tonight and it's like going to be a one night thing and it's just going to be fun. I was like, yeah, and listen, I will add, my rule for myself right now is not to like bang people like I don't want to have penises in my vagina because it just get too attached and everything and I'm sober and videos, but keep going.

Speaker 14:         01:00:09       Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So my rule is though and can always be convinced if you get me worked up enough, I'm going to be like, oh, we need to bang right now. Right. The guys like, let me just put the tip in and then you're like, I'm suddenly like, okay, like if I want to have sex, I'm going to have sex, but I just need to be convinced and boy I can be convinced when I get horned up. There's just, my brain doesn't function like making logical choices. I just want it real quick. Yes. A lot of men listen to this show types of questions to get you. Is it conversation? Should they, is it like just great chemistry? Do you point to anything in particular? We have to have a little bit of a flirty, flirty history. I'm like, there's gotta be a little, it's not going to be a one night thing.

Speaker 14:         01:00:55       There's going to be a little bit of texting, flirting, going on, and then in person play the long game. Not Super Long, but you have to acknowledge that you are desperate to bang me. I think that's just like, I like nice things. I like to feel women just want to feel desired. Just make me feel like I, there's something special about me that you want me more than other people. Like, even if it's a lie, just you know what, just make me feel special. Make girls feel like, uh, the woman in the long December counting crows song all at all, at once across a crowded room. You see the way the light attaches to a girl, like make me feel like I'm the girl in the middle of a room that you just see that's how girls want to feel. Then in terms of like hooking up to get to have sex with me, we need more foreplay.

Speaker 14:         01:01:41       And I feel so cliche saying that as a woman. Like I feel like a 90s lady, like more foreplay honey. Like it's almost like it's, it just doesn't feel good to me to say that, but it's, it just is true. Like we, I need more. I just have a lot of times guys going into soon where I'm like, I'm not ready. And that is the equivalent of like a girl grabbing your limp Dick and being like, come on and like you don't like, like I'll let you know when I'm ready. Just split. Let's dry hump, bring back dry humping some over the genes. Finger action. Right. There you go. I'm no, no. As a mother of two busy, I got a lot of shit on my roster. I like to get in. I like to get out. I like getting in and getting out too, but when you're in my shoes though, do you relate to like a little bit?

Speaker 14:         01:02:33       If I were a single gal, here's the thing. As a mother of two young children, the window for Gnocchi is so narrow. Chubb, it's like I know when it's coming because I know we got it on the calendar. We're going to do it tonight's the night, so I'm thinking about it all day. I'm like, all right, we're going to have I to put the kids down and then I got this the window. We've got to do it. So I'm already thinking about it all day, so when it's time go time, I'm like, but even though let's pork, man, let's fucking fuck. I don't want to fuck around. In defense of what you're saying, yeah. I'll still be like, hey, you want to warm it up a little bit? You got to do what? You have to warm up the oven and, and, and I agree that's a, that is nice to have someone who's attentive to that kind of stuff.

Speaker 14:         01:03:14       Yeah. I just want to be begging you to put yourself and make sure I don't want you to be like, let's go and me go. Okay. I want to be like bleed. Sure. And um, and so I was hooking up with this guy. We got back to, we went back to our hotel, we're on the same floor. Our hotel rooms are back to back. Wow. Hotel rooms are right next to each other. Perfect. I'm like, I want to go to his because mine's a mess. Like I like a slob on the road. Right. Um, he's like, I have a buddy staying with me and I'm like, oh man. Like I want to look up, but I really, my room is disgusting. And so I just am like, give me a second, let me go in and I'm throwing things now. How disgusting do you get?

Speaker 14:         01:03:54       Like you leave the room service trays. Are we talking coffee mugs and next to the bed rappers in bed and stains on the like cause I eat in bed so it just looks like too, I get chocolate. So it's like I'm shitting in bed, cross town. I don't even flush the toilet. Sometimes there's like p and saving the environment, leaving on vacation, cleaned my room, meet who, what's up at the emotional work week in a hotel. It looks like there was a robbery, possibly could have been multiple salts in the room, like a shelter. It looks like it should be on for like 48 Frat guys live in there. Take a photo for a magazine that is, I relate to, I haven't related to something more and it really want them something so specific and I tip wildly if you're cleaning my room at the end of the week.

Speaker 14:         01:04:56       Yeah, me too. You're getting a lot. Even when I was a contract I was like, here's like, oh wait. Yes, because it's gross to clean up. And I tried to do a little good job of tidying for the maid. But yeah, and so I went in there and I missed a couple of things. I think there was like, uh, uh, my, I left like out my vibrator type thing when he left. I was like, ah, it was like our, and I'm sure he saw it, but who cares now? And he's like, we should put that in there. Let me ask you something, when you, if you travel with that, is it in your checking bag or are you doing a carry on with that in it? Um, it, I don't have a vibrator. I have this thing called the womanizer and it like sucks your clit and so it doesn't, if it turns on it's not going to be an embarrassing sounds.

Speaker 14:         01:05:36       What a name. I don't like the way. No, it's the worst. So can I make it something fun? You know, women like Hello Kitty, that's a huge thing. Yeah. Hello Kitty vibrators because it takes the nasty out of it. Any Nicer? No, I know, I'm sorry. So you put that in your carry on or that goes in your throat checked. But I would put it in my carry on button. But no, she ain't have no shame because if it turns on, it's like very like if, yeah, I don't care if someone says it looks like an ear thermometer, say touches it, that's not gonna. I would laugh. I will actually enjoy that. If a TSA agent had to open it up and be like, ah, I'd be like, it sucks my clit. Like I would just say that to his face. Like very mad about faculty.

Speaker 14:         01:06:17       You just have a story out of it. Same, same along the same lines. I was traveling with my breast pump also. Very sexy, very sexy, and I was like, Oh God, what have Tsa opens it and touches it with her fucking dirty. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That is gross. Uh, check stuff. You mean? No, carry on. Because it's a, it's a device. It's sensitive devices. Yeah. But even if you check it, sometimes they rummage through your bag and you know, you get that note that's like, I know because it's, yeah. Yeah. I travel with my scrum master and I lot of times I'll see them touch that. Yeah. What do you travel? Do you travel a scram? Master. Yeah. Did you put it underneath and it goes like right in your ass and then it comes back up and the vibration goes around the head. Kate. Okay, go ahead. And is that a real thing? No. Oh my God, it sounds great.

Speaker 16:         01:07:05       My Ass Brown.

Speaker 14:         01:07:09       The vibrator was, you realize you love womanizer and then we just start making out. We get to work and um, I have this new, I like, I really am going to need to be convinced before I do anything to him. Like I'm getting, I need to get some stuff done or at least see the promise that something's good. All right. So is this a, is that etiquette? I'm never, it's been a mess is a new rule for me. He's got to give it away. So many Gotcha. Comes like I've let so many guys come when they haven't done anything for me then I'm tired of it. Yeah. I'm 34 and I just, I don't believe, I don't, just because I'm hooking up with a guy, it doesn't mean he gets to come anymore. And that used to be my role. Like, you know, if you get two, you get to a guy to a point where he is thinking he's going to orgasm.

Speaker 14:         01:07:52       You a lot of girls feel obligated to bring about that orgasm because there's this blue balls thing and you just feel like you're a bad woman. He's going to be frustrated. He's not to be able to get to sleep. All these things, like if he doesn't get to come, and a lot of times you guys don't deserve to come. You didn't do anything. Wow. Two, um, and I love when you come, I want you to come, but if you're not even trying to make me come at all, no desi very sided. You don't get it. And guess what? Once you calm, I know it's over. People are like, well, just why don't you make him come and then have them go down on you? And I'm like, um, cause I don't believe in animal cruelty. I wouldn't make it a guy. I used to say this, but like after a guy comes, he wants to shut me like a laptop.

Speaker 14:         01:08:32       Like he doesn't want to like keep fingering me. It's over. I'd be like, have you ever been with a guy before? That's not how it happened. Girls say that though. They don't know. But like, but I feel that way too. Like after the lady does Bangkok, I'm over it. I'm like, oh good, can we, let's now see, I am like still cause girls can have like multiple, so I can still be turned on enough to like maybe I can go again. Sure. That's true. You need to kind of, but I do relate to when you have had one that's like the one time. Yes. So I see related to that. So, so you guys do it and so what happened? No. So I'm, so we're looking up and we're just making out and stuff, but we're both really tired. Like really, really like we've had long ass days.

Speaker 14:         01:09:18       We both worked and um, and his heart, he's okay. I'm like almost naked. I think. I'm just like wearing a thong. Like that's it. And he's in, he still has his shoes on and like maybe a top hat. Like, I didn't let him take off anything because I was just like, you're, I don't want you to think that you're going to get anything out of this until you at least do something for me. And this guy definitely hasn't like put in the work before and he's hasn't taken me out. He hasn't done anything, really isn't even a corded you at all at all. So I'm just like, you had to fuck your wave him. Oh over fuck this guy. I like him. So I just, and, and he's a nice guy and he's so hot. God Damn it. He's so hot. And so I was talking and I'm like, why am I not turned on?

Speaker 14:         01:09:58       But I'm not, I just know that I'm not going to have an orgasm. Like I, the Wa the fingering style wasn't my favorite, but that is not his fault. He was doing a great job and he was trying, but he was tired. And also I've required like a lot of work, like I'm a lot of work and that nothing's been, sorry to interrupt, but yeah, but nothing is worse than a bad fingery. Yes, I can throw in. You're not even close. No, and but I don't expect someone to get that right. Yeah, that that is beside. That's what I like. See, we're all different. I need to be like violently fracked. Are you kidding me? Well, a lot of guys, I mean eventually it leads to mouth.

Speaker 14:         01:10:44       What do you mean into the mouth? The Porno and then they choke you with your own. Listen, I'm not opposed to any of that stuff. Eventually down the road, the first time hookup, so, okay, so he's finger banging you. It's not your style. It's nothing against like I would, I'm, I can't wait to hook up with this guy again because he has so much promise. I just, we were both tired. His heart wasn't in it and at one when I looked down and heart, not it, it makes me crazy. It's knows I'm not going to fuck him. He's pretty sure he's, he's pretty sure. I'm like, I'm really making them work for it. Then he takes out his penis. At one point I looked down and it's out, which is reasonable. I was fully like almost fully naked. Is sure. It wasn't like I was like, oh no, but his dick is out and I go, um, thought it was oh yeah, it was, it was great. It was good. Yeah. And I go, um, you're going to need to put that away. Like it's not going to be addressed yet. Like I'll let you know, but it's not now. So I made him put it away.

Speaker 14:         01:11:48       I don't like, I don't like, I actually like to be the one dominated, so I did not like doing that. Yeah. She's just like put that away. I know like the Puerto Rican guide that I thought would be my one night stand, it was a similar thing where I was like, no, I don't think so. And to say no, and you're right, the pressure is very high on us to continue with what you're doing. And it's really, it's hard to be like, Nah, that was harder for me to do that anal, I got to put away his deck when I was like, I'm just not, I don't want, I want it yet. I'll let you know. That's very mature. This is what I want to know. How did he handle that?

Speaker 14:         01:12:29       That's true. He goes, oh, he was, he was like really? Like he was kind of like really like he couldn't believe it. That was going to be put away, but he was understanding this guy was so cool about all of this stuff. So cool. Great Guy. That's why I'm like, I really do like this guy. And I even told him, I was like, listen, you have a great deck and I can't wait for this thing to be in me someday and it will be if you play your cards right, like I'm, I'm looking very forward to that, but it's, it's just not tonight and I'm not even convinced I'm going to like deal with it tonight. Like I might not even touch it because first of all, I don't have that much confidence in the end at this point. Surely like four months ago or whenever this one's five months ago.

Speaker 14:         01:13:06       I've gotten way better at blow jobs since then, but at this point I'm just like, those aren't, I'm not really like confident enough to be like, well, let me just do this and not competent enough to enjoy doing it. Well, I mean that's kind of a special treat for somebody. I always felt that that believing that a guy, a blow job is harder than just being like just fucking, that's why I know Christine that is weight struggle is because I always just go to sex because it was so much easy. It's the easiest thing, but for some reason it has the most weight attached to all your mouth is so intimate and really commit the Lakers, which were would you go mouth first? What are you talking about? What's which one? All of them after a game. They're clean. They're showered. Babe. I would much rather just get banged out a bunch because at least you're getting something out of that. I don't have like that's what I'm endings in my mouth. It's actually very uncomfortable. That's when I'm giving a blowjob to someone I love and care about. It's amazing. It's so fun to do, but, or it can be, it's not, but it can be put it away. So cool about it. And then

Speaker 4:          01:14:11       do you end up, you go back

Speaker 14:         01:14:13       and then I think it takes, he takes, he took it out again. I think you can. I know which is again fine cause we were really working up to some stuff and I just, it was a mixture of me being like you don't deserve it. And also, um, I don't really want to do anything to you. Like I'm not in the mood to suck a penis and I certainly am not in the mood to Jerky was like I have no jerk off coffee. I don't do that and neither do I. So I'm not going to do things I'm not good at and so I'm just not going to do anything to you. And so I kind of, at one point we were just like making out and it was kind of just get winding down, you know, and I, we just kind of go and he goes, do you just want to go to our separate hotel rooms and jerk off to this?

Speaker 14:         01:14:54       And I was like, yes, he gets up, doesn't have to put on anything cause he has everything on. He kisses me, goodbye, leaves any walks and I hear him go into his room and we both just standards. I don't know if he jerked off, I just ate some chips and watched, uh, in my feelings challenges the Drake and my feeling like that was, I remember it was the night I saw Kiki, do you love me? And I was like, what is this dance craze? And I just watched it in bed and I was like, oh yeah, I just hooked up to, it was weird. So that was the end of it. And um, since then we, we sext and stuff and we see each other out and about and there's like so much fun. NRG and it's still

Speaker 4:          01:15:29       still very much on still alive. Oh yeah. Yeah. Well, guess what? There's a little competition for baguette letting some of your mom's house might soon be in Nikki's pants. If you play your cards right. Here we go, whew, man. My fucking with clown. Look, I'm from Florida. I'm looking for my queen. No, I'm saying Sean Garby skin shown Barbie Fitch. You can be anywhere between, you know what I'm saying? I just need some man motherfucking Wiki.

I don't feel like he really sees me. Okay. You know what I mean? What I know don't feel seen. Fair enough. Do you see his lack of teeth? What do you think about those fake shoppers?

Speaker 14:         01:17:40       Yeah, tell me about it. We weren't, weren't fascinated. I love it so much that people are ASR sensitive, right? Yeah. Like you, it's, yeah, it's tell people what it is. Okay. So it's auto sensory Meridian response I think is the ASM or, but it's this feeling that you get when you hear, um, there's certain, uh, sound stimuli that make you feel a tingling in the back of your head that kind of goes down your spine and gives you this really soothing, like numbed out wonderful feeling that is described as brain a brain orgasm, but it's not sexual. It just feels super relaxing. Like, you know, that thing you put on your head that I love bangles. It's like that everywhere and it's more intense. And people that have it have been getting it since they were kids. Like, I didn't know. Head thing is my, Oh my God, it's so amazing. Just get another one of those. I know everyone should have one of those. Why doesn't everyone have, we used to, it's good writers. I hope that, oh, I don't like that. I don't like that. No. Okay. I like soft spoken and I'm like whisper. Oh, what about, oh yeah, I like this. I watched people eat a lot.

Speaker 14:         01:18:57       Oh yeah. What does a cereal salad. There's a salad. Yeah, I think he's you like to this does that for you. You feel the tingle, right? Yeah. I love this. I know it's, there's too many mouth sounds. I don't like that. Oh it's two girls just go into town. Is this a Muck Bang? That's what they call this when people just eat a discuss like the sound though. I just, yes. Wow. Yeah. Actually I don't like the girl on the left cause she's cheating with her mouth closed. I kind of like an open mouth and I know that disgusting. I didn't realize this until I was on a plane once in a girl was eating a bag of sun chips next to me and I was getting numbed out so hard because this is a feeling I've been getting since I can trace it back to my first time.

Speaker 14:         01:19:42       I felt it was in kindergarten and my school teacher was reading a book to the class and just the way she turned the pages and was reading it and then she would show it to all of us like this and I would just be like, good, good, good, good. Don't stop. Don't stop. Like it would be like, or the kind of orgasmic type feeling, but not, it wasn't like it was turned on. You don't get wet listening to these videos. You just feel so God damn, I thought I was gay for a while because it's always women's voices that do it for me. So throughout my childhood it would just be like, you know, uh, uh, a woman like a mob who was volunteering with our math class to like help us with our homework and she would reach around me and um, and, and show me like, you carry the seven and then you add the three bracelets with like jingle on the desk. And I couldn't even pay it. I would just be like, oh, it was so good. But now I've worn it out so much that I don't even get the tingles anymore. It just is soothing to me to play these videos. This guy, this guy's a SMR guy here.

Speaker 13:         01:20:45       Hey guys, I'm going to tell you something. You are not bad. Nothing is bad. It's a matter of the physical life on them.

Speaker 14:         01:20:57       I hate what he's saying, but I like his voice. Do? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         01:21:00       Can we face our penis? Oh No. Let's see. 10 o'clock no,

Speaker 14:         01:21:09       his teeth are so crooked, but so white. Oh, I guess the other DNA. Wait for someone with that crooked of teeth. You wouldn't think I care about whitening. Sure. Yeah. This could be natural white. I don't know. No sulfur. I don't know. What makes you to know it makes teeth white, by the way, when I notice on the ALMAC ECOM guy is that he often does videos without his teeth. However, on this last video you'll notice that he took the effort to put in his bottom bottom teeth and not and not the top, however. Oh, so he kind of half ass the denture game. It's like, well, if you're going to go half, yes. Why not put the top ones into? Yeah. It was an interesting choice on his part and makes for a really good why mh video. He checks all the boxes. You see a bad lighting, bad background, denture choices, bad request. It's all there.

Speaker 14:         01:22:09       If I have another one of his, cause I know. Sure. I got legitimately excited that you had an actual people. No for me to consider. Now there's, you really are, I mean, we're all friends. The same people. Which comedian do you want a date? Because we all know that I've been through them all or all the ones I want right at this point. Yeah, I know. I know. Why are you going to, are you open? Are you open to, hey, you know we have data comedians. Do you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm open to comedians. I think I'll end up with someone. Um, who's a comedian or like at least is a narcissist. Oh look. Bare minimum. Yeah. Do you think you are in our sister? Probably. I don't think so a little bit, but I'm drawn to narcissists I've found. Oh, you like the emotional unavailability. You like musicians? No, never really. I mean, yeah, optically they are pleasing,

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       but I've never really had a connection with one where I'm like, okay,

Speaker 17:         01:23:09       okay, because here we go, here we go. I have another beat down for your child practice, practice my own songs is my introduction to my song coming out. You're, here we go. I'll sing it. She's worth the machine's worth. Then they got a gun and got again. Yeah. Got to terminate her gun. Yeah. Machines. But the machines were thin tea, 16 to 60 to 6100% to 16 machines with thin or students with thin trying to wreck my rep, trying to make my rough talk to summit flow, trying to practice. Some are full, no street. I don't care. But the haters, the haters.

Speaker 1:          01:24:02       Hey, that's a great attitude. I thought he was saying machines worth it. Oh No. Within yeah. Machines with them. Machines within. Um, yeah, I'll consider it. Yeah. Um, are you aware of this man? Uh, who reached out to a lady, I mean, picture yourself leaving the gym and somebody calls your name after like, Hey Nikki and you don't know them. Yeah. And then this is the scenario of how this actually happened. If you don't know. So this young lady left the gym. Somebody says her name, Hey Nikki, like do I know you? And the guy was like, I just, I saw your name on the sign in sheet. Oh. He's like, well, you're lovable. You're beautiful. You know, I'd love to take you out sometime. You're like, I'm just, and you do like the kind put that like where you're like, I'm actually talking to my ex and um, you know, we're just kind of, and he's like, what can I get your number and you're holding your phone so you're like, I, you know what? I'll take your number this way if I want to. And then you're like, put your number in there and he puts his number in there and then he dials. So now he has your number and then he has, since he has your number, you think that's that you're like, all right, whatever. The next morning you wake up and this is on your phone.

Things that I was, oh Nikki, do we have a love connection here? I'm just, I feel bad that I've missed if I've misled anyone to think that that would be appropriate because that was so gross. But also he goes upstairs. Sorry if I scared you. Had some self awareness that I kind of appreciated at the end of the Ma was kind of silly and like a fun, I liked it. I didn't hate it. See them walk a few more times, but he's kind of being funny. Like he had his little sense of humor. Like, I don't know that he was trying to be completely sincere. Wait a second, where did you get this and what is, why is this real? It's so real. And were friends with Julia now. Yeah. And she, so we found this will sign to us first. We found the story out. We are fans contacted Julia, we talked to Julia and then she sent us a, why am age exclusive? There's a second one that he said she did not respond to the first you I want to say good morning. You send her that at all. Yeah, my flower, my precious. I still to be my everything. Have a great day. Love.

He builds them. But I just, this crazy person like have a job in a house and like a gym membership. I don't understand how these people live. I live in Longmont lesson has had a lot of fun with it.

Speaker 18:         01:28:53       Julia that morning, let's know that this car here that I'm driving. Yeah, I built it myself. I fixing the heating. The heating didn't work when I got the call, but it's like I'm really handy so I was able to fix it.

Speaker 14:         01:29:15       You told me all about you and I just wanted to let me know that I have full approval on look, get all the fans a pot. Oh boy. Good Morning Julia. Good morning. Julia, you so much. I've been thinking about you every day or do anything. I wanted to get you something.

Speaker 1:          01:29:46       Only women can really fully appreciate like the uncomfortable creepiness and attack mode of receiving that message. Guys do it. It's very funny too, but I feel like the women doing it, it's kind of

Speaker 14:         01:29:58       the women capture the feeling. I contact. I catch with dog named. Uh, that's right. I named after you so anytime you're not here I can just come out and say good morning Julie. That's pretty great. Oh Man, we've all been Julia before where? Just Nice. She'd give him your phone. Then how can you go? How did this guy get my number? How did it get to this Rick? To me

Speaker 1:          01:30:34       when we first saw these, his video, I was like, I actually felt bad for the guy a little bit. Have we traced, well we've, we've got some,

Speaker 14:         01:30:44       I'm kind of don't want to, let's not. Yeah, yeah. Don't, don't learn. No, this guy's scary.

Speaker 1:          01:30:54       But the thing was that like I started to go like, well I feel like what he did was he didn't control, there's an impulse in you to not send that. But like you meet somebody, right? And you go like, oh my God, I want that. That's my everything. It's like a a rush, but everything in you goes, well don't you don't make a video to scent. Like sometimes you send, maybe you sent a text to somebody, like I feel like an idiot. Right? You send it text, but to make a video like, so I felt bad for him that he put that out there. But at the same time there's something real wrong.

Speaker 14:         01:31:30       There's something wrong. There's a sadness about his situation. Yes. Oh, I don't even know that. I want to make fun of this. Cause this guy maybe a special, but then he built that whole house. He can't be that like he's not special. You're not touched. It feels a little touch. That lack of awareness.

Speaker 18:         01:31:51       [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         01:31:55       and Julia, I just wanted to tell you that getting it's been my anniversary

Okay. Ciao baby. I'll make you feel like a real woman. Okay, Joe. Okay. Joe. Jesus Christ. It's so juveniles. That one fucking amazing saw. Amazing. Oh No. Nikki, have you ever done the converse of this? Like have you ever sent something that you wish you had it to a boy where you wish like, oh my God, time. Uh, but the text messages? No, I mean, yeah. Um, I've seen like pictures and stuff, but I really am pretty good about like, if, if I send you a naked picture, like you, I trust you a lot. Like it takes me a lot to that. Oh No. And I want to, man, it's like sometimes I'm like, God, I can't do anything with, like sometimes you get out of the shower and you're like, I work on myself and I'm like, I'm, I'm peaking right now.

Speaker 14:         01:36:04       Oh, I know what you're like, say the opposite. I'm like, Ooh, I don't know why to look at a lighting. I'd have to get on myself. God Damn it. Somebody would throw up if I sent him this. I don't think anybody wants to look at my mom's sloppers either. Well, I've said I have many days like that, but like there are some days where you're like, I wish I could share this with someone, but I just don't. And I know a lot of girls that will just send those things out to get validation and praise all angels. I know you don't know. And so many things like that. But, um, I can't do it, but I've sent, I'm just like, I've had manic episode, like where I'm just having a bad day and I'm mad at a guy or something and then I just am like, well, I don't think you understand where I'm coming. Like, you know, you just have a text exchange. I'm home for Thanksgiving and having a manic. And then you look at a bunch of, of chunk of blue and you're like, I didn't need to send the same graph right

Speaker 1:          01:37:00       back a little while to this stuff. But do you ever do it? Like I was always, I was never, I didn't like, um, like if I went out on a date with a girl and then like, uh, you know, it was a good date. You're like, I like her, you know, I like her, but then she's like, oh, I can't stop thinking about you. I go like, ah,

Speaker 14:         01:37:18       no, that's, yeah, she's like gross. Yeah, it's a lot. It's a lie. I would be like, that's weird. And then I don't know, suddenly I tell a friend, some people react differently. So like some friends would be like, it's great, right? I'm like, no, no, but she's talking about it. We went on a date. Yeah, I play it. Cool. I always like, well don't you remember being in like six or seventh grade? Like just when the feelings start to really get intense. That's the opposite. That's what Joe did. Joe Did a sixth grade, right? Yes. I want to love you forever and I'll be your everything. I felt the way Joe's felt recently when I know that I shouldn't, you know, you let your mind wonder and it was like this is, I would be there for it. Like I don't know, happens in you when you do not let, you don't even let out one percentage of what he let out.

Speaker 14:         01:38:08       You play it. Cool. And I remember being in seventh grade and just being so obsessed with this boy in my class. Like, you know when you're just, Oh my God, but you don't really like I was in seventh grade, so at that level, I mean there was like one girl that had been finger bang, our went on to say her name, but she had really big cans and so everybody assumed that she was a slut and I don't think she was, her first name is Shelby and that they said that she got fingered during top gun at the movies. I don't think it happened, but the point is I was so into this guy and you know, you're just like, oh, I just burning with love. And I would just like write letters and be like, Gosh, I give a talk and I thank God I didn't.

Speaker 14:         01:38:44       But you know what I mean? When you're like this close to doing that thing and you're like, Oh God, I just should, I should convince yourself even as like I'm not like in the past couple of years, like you just go to a place where you can convince yourself that, I mean I, I'm constantly having to play games with guys with texting and exhausting acting. Like you don't want to hear from them when you do and not watching their Instagram videos so that they know that you don't really care about that. Like it's there so people can tell if you've watched. Yes, yes. Huge thing. Like your Instagram story. Okay. So like if you look at, you can look at your own Instagram story, swipe up on it, and then you see everyone who has watched it. Now if you have a crush on a guy and a guy likes you a way he can let you know he likes you before you even talk is that you just start seeing his name under everything that you do and you're like, he's paying attention to me, this guy.

Speaker 14:         01:39:40       And then you go, okay, this guy in to me. And then maybe you start following him or maybe like you the next time you see him at the club or whatever you're like, and you just, that is a way to let a girl know that you're in tour is if you want a lot of soul. And it's a way to let someone know your nodded to them. If you are continually watching each other's videos and then all of a sudden you stop seeing his name, you go, oh my God, he doesn't even care about me anymore. When a lot of times they're purposely not watching it so that they can send so that they can play it cool. Which I've done before where I'm like, I'm not gonna Watch this stuff so that he doesn't think that I'm thinking about his career. So it's, so why aren't you stoked that we hooked up on the time of like Friendster.

Speaker 14:         01:40:17       Friendster was around when Tom and I got together. This is craziness and that's when I just go, you know what? I'm going to stop playing these games and just be honest and say how I feel. And then that's not good either. So you, it's either you play games or you're, you scare them off with your honesty. So it's just, it's, it's too complicated. What Jean has beautiful teeth, perfect teeth, very white. Do you get them professionally whitened? No. You know what I use? Um, I turned on.

I could just be a dick and ball festival. I don't know how you guys keep it all but yeah, they have a bigger problem

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       than I do that you are a straight sociopath. What did I do? You're keeping videos of your wife's snoring. I cannot fucking believe you're doing this. You're actually going to have a whole lot. I have 15 it's not like I have a, well so uh, Victoria Wiggins has a youtube channel and she's helping people prep with anal sex. We have our anal sex expert, Nikki Glaser. Oh God. Blow us all away. Last time I haven't had it since last time. I don't think really want to tell me what you think of Victoria's advice gave advice and we want to know and I actually kind of want somebody else in the room to maybe pay attention to.

Speaker 20:         01:44:31       A lot of people have been asking me, Victoria, I'm so scared to have, dare I say having sex in your bus can be extremely terrifying. There's a lot of things that could go wrong, but when you, there's a lot of things that could go right. I've got a few tips. First is what you need. It's all about your diet and start in the kitchen. That's what they say, right? Well, same thing goes for bottoming. It starts in the kitchen. There's a lot of things that you can't eat like a few days before you bought them. So like pizza through vegetables, any food, any kind of protein, carb, fat. This is all food. What should we eat? I'm not a few tips. First is what you eat. It's all about your diet. Abs Start in the kitchen. That's what they say, right? Step two, you got to relax. When Tony going in there, you're immediate reaction.

Speaker 20:         01:45:27       If you're new to the, to the bus scene, just clinch and you being your body registers it as poop. So your immediate reaction is just clench it out cause that's what you've done your whole life. Well, I'm here to tell you that you're going to have to unlearn that. I always start by letting me know that I need him to start off slow. I need him to go gradual. I need him to go easy because you don't want to start out too strong. That's going to expedite your body's immediate reaction to push out things. I don't think we're intended to go up there. However it feels really good. So maybe there was a master plan. I'm not sure. Jesus, if you're out there loving the most, you might clench so hard. You might bleed through the sheets. I mean, it's happened to me before and it's not a fun experience. You could also be in a situation where your body hates it so much that it will shit on them. Even though you've cleaned yourself out, even though you didn't eat for three days, it'll still shit on them because it's like, it's like a kind of like, it's like get away from me. Not Eat for three days. Is that what she's suggesting? That is what she's doing. And I know girls that are like, oh, I might have anal sex tonight. I'm not going to eat today,

Speaker 4:          01:46:43       will not give you that. But I didn't really, I'd say that's sound advice. I would just like to maybe in the next

Speaker 14:         01:46:50       time I have it, I'm do I have like a whole plan? Because in the past it's been like impromptu and I've been lucky. I've also been unlucky, but like in the future if I like want it and I'm going to go do it, I'm going to get a, um, I'm going to, cause I've done enemas like before because you're supposed to just squirt, went up there and clear it all out. But I don't know if I talked about this last time, but like you have to get like 10 enemas. You can, what do you tell them in 10 of us to be totally thing you need to do it until the water runs clear. Oh. And I bought one once and that just mixes things up and makes everything, oh, I see. What's bad, bad news. And I, and I remember being like, I'm so sorry that happened.

Speaker 14:         01:47:27       Literally that happened because I was trying to actually be better. Like you know that that was so much worse. So there's ones I have, I'm a hairstylist who is a gay man and he was like, oh honey, you need to get off Amazon like a reusable one that you just keep filling with saline solution instead of buying like 16 bucks enemas at Walgreens. It's smart. It's a lot of work, but it's, it feels really good and it's worth it. I think it's when I am in the mood to have some like really amped up like dirty, dirty sax and like really go all out. Um, yeah, I put in that effort. Wow Man, this word, this pay attention. What about now? I just had my second child five months ago. So there's a lot of damage down there. We're still, what do you do if a cow has hemorrhoids?

Speaker 14:         01:48:17       Cause I still, you're not doing that. I can't have bud sex. How did you know that way? Did you hear that? Hemorrhoids are so painful. I'm so sorry. Oh, no, it doesn't hurt me as hard. It kind of doesn't. It's weird. I don't know if it's, cause I have a lot of fiber and my dad, I don't push a lot when I make brown. Oh, that's not really bothering me, but I don't know if I'm going in at my, yeah. Upset it. I just wouldn't want to. I think the tissue is too sensitive for that, but um, but yeah, it's like, like she's saying about, um, your body like pushes it like it, it thinks it's poop. Like that's a real, I believe that because I've done a suppository once and the how that works, I believe there's glycerin too, is that it's actually because you're introducing something into your butt that makes you feel like you have to shit.

Speaker 14:         01:49:08       Do you understand? Like, you know, you can get a baby to take a dump is if you stimulate his be whole with the qtip that actually just stimulating Massell think that it's already, there's something right at the precipice because a lot of times that's when it's like, get out, get up. Right. Sure. That was her next suggestion. Next we're going to talk about animals. I think animals are the best way to prep yourself in a life packs. You can buy enemas at the drug store, Walmart, target, wherever they have like a medicine I'll obviously you want to get on the floor on all fours

Speaker 20:         01:49:48       and then poke your ass up in the air. Kind of like you're about to have sex. It's kind of like a practice round. You get your head down ass up just like taiga likes it and you stick that in. You squirt in all the liquid. You don't want to do it too fast because it can really disrupt the lining of your bus. And then when I actually like to do kind of bounce around, maybe like, oh, okay, I've never seen this actually helpful just to kind of mix everything. When your stomach starts hurting, when you help all that fluid inside of you, that's a good thing because that means that you're ready for the grand finale. The release, you need to sit on the toilet for like 10 minutes. You don't want to like squirt it out, do your little Squirtle move and then go hop on Daddy's Dick. That's not how it works. You want to go sit pro tip. If you do feel like you need to do around to please just use another enema. Do not refill the bottle of water. I don't know what's in that shit, but something in that solution that's a not bottle really works. Water water will make your asshole rar. Then at the end of it, I mean it's just not good. Oh Man.

Speaker 4:          01:51:00       My pet peeve is when people say their stomach hurts and then you shit. It's not your stomach that's hurting. It's your intestines. Your stomach is an Oregon above your and test it. It's been my pet peeve. My entire for my tummy hurts. It's not your tummy stupid cause your intestines, your stomach, the stomach's different pain and it's the same thing like when women are pregnant it's like it's none of my stomach. Tommy. Does your tummy, the babies in your tummy? No, not. Do you know how bodies were right to your uterus, your cut button? My upper, my fucking cut. She keeps saying her bus,

Speaker 20:         01:51:42       nine times out of 10, if he's going to fuck your house, he's going to eat your ass better. Taste good. You don't want to be tasting like true mixture of shit and animals. Baby. Why so much even? I'm like, I can't so much never happened. You want to act like you weren't just in the bathroom after doing those animus. Yeah. You're gonna feel like you need to shit more. Sure. Times out of 10, it's false. It's a trick. If you do two animals, you're not going to shit. And I don't know why we're not all doing it. There's a lot of websites that say, oh, you enemas are good, but they're not necessary. Sometimes all you need is a, a soapy finger and a washcloth. Well, I'm sorry, are we living in the fucking 16 hundreds? Do we not have enemas? That's what they're made for.

Speaker 4:          01:52:33       Oh my God, you guys are so disgusting. Um, all right, well thanks for the advice Victoria. If you want to donate, but Victoria, uh, like to donate, uh, raising money for surgery, go from me.com/victoria

Speaker 14:         01:52:46       f f s is what I think I see here. Yeah. So there you go. Yeah. Um, well it's a lot of advice. I learned some stuff, some stuff you should it to two of us and if you have to shit after that is 900, seven times. It's an illusion. It looks, sounds like she's saying you might want to get that box from rite aid of all those. I think I'll get three next time I'm ready to go. But then I got to buy them separately because I don't want it to look like I'm about to have anal sex. You let me ask you this, Jeff, do Yada Yada. I have a question for you. It just seems like studies so much work to prepare for anal and doesn't it? I just imagine after giving myself three or four enemas, I've killed the mood cause I been shitting all day.

Speaker 14:         01:53:30       Yeah. You know when you have diarrhea and then later you're like, I can't have sex tonight. I just shit a lot today. You know, sometimes Tom will have diarrhea and I'll be like, are we still doing it? And you're like, no, I just had diarrhea. Diarrhea is no plant leg while you're shitting all day. You just said isn't it make your be whole soar to give so many animals and then you know. But I think in giving yourself animas it would feel kind of good. Like if you're in the anal sex like as a girl, I think I would start to, it would be like a little bit of foreplay. Oh I see. You like to be like I can't wait to yeah because the thing about anal sex, it feels good cause it feels like you're taking a really good shit. Ah, right, right, right.

Speaker 14:         01:54:13       I liked right. I don't like diarrhea. No one likes diarrhea but like right, we all can get behind a really good shit. Yeah I do. It's amazing. Like a good shit feels so good. And that's what anal sex feels like. Like a good, like a really, really satisfying one where it's like you've had to go and then you're like, your whole body is just like, ah, you know those where you shiver and your, your literal eyes cross like that's, that's what it's like. You make me want to take a shit. I know, right? I never thought I'd say it, but they know I have another potential suitor for you

Speaker 21:         01:54:47       before you have sex. If you want to be horny for two or three hours like you never been in your life and you have access to marijuana too good. We'd listen to me. Okay. Okay. I'm listening as her weight alone can get you really hornier than normal, but it's been under all take about 10 12 Bannon girl before you want to have your sexual fun with your partner or whatever you do or masturbate. All right. Oh, about an hour later when you fill it, just kicking and smoke your weed done and then go ahead and get horny and I promise you it will be millions of times more. You'll be so blissfully horny that you will not want to come. Trust me. It

Speaker 14:         01:55:34       sounds like maybe you could pass it on to potential mates. Can someone please try that and see if it works? I think they have. I mean my man right here. It's the best idea.

Speaker 8:          01:55:44       I want someone listening to Nellie's try that. No, no, don't advocate. You don't find it. Don't not do it. Do not get anybody listening to this show did not do what this man is doing. What does that work? What if that's the cocktail to be as Horny, happiness, joy? Well, you know what? I never realized Tommy is the timeline. He's like, you have to take 10 to 12 Benadryl at once. You wait an hour. It's so many. You have to wait a full hour hour to fight off that Benadryl and your system. Stay awake for an hour and then smoke a ton of weed. Then get horny. Then he goes. Then it's not like he will get you. You're going to get horny does then. Then you got to get in whenever so much my formula for when you're Horny, it's so labor. All of this is so much work. Too much work. God.

Speaker 23:         02:00:19       and I'd rather they didn't believe me, but when he smoked with me, he put his dick. I can't believe how big his dick was. He jacked off for Joe and shots and those companies every time there's like 49 and he's fine. He has no neuropathy problems at home. It gets even harder, thicker and more come even believes me now

Speaker 8:          02:00:39       he believes in me now. I just caught that. He believes me now. I believe me now hanging out with his brother Jack Jack in math and his brother takes his dick out. Yeah. The way he said Lou was the most disgusting word. Don't need. Oh, how does this person have the faculties to like upload this video and like, oh, those are the things that perplex me. It's like, how did this guy get all that done before she drove? Well, and he's took time out from his lunch at Applebee's to go in the bathroom because you can also hear the wait staff in the background. You can hear order up like all that clinking and clanking led to the Nachos. Yup. Pretty Great. You know what weekend this weekend he's going to take another bus. Oh my God. We'll

Speaker 23:         02:01:32       get hard. So do you want to see me go from a limp dick too hard day. I got it. Thanks. Do it this weekend. He's going to do what? You do. Tape it. It's a small deck. Very lamp. Okay. Watch it get harder and harder. That's a proven fact, right? Let me know. That bothered me a bit. If you say yes, I'll show it to you.

Speaker 8:          02:01:50       Uh, how hard it gets. Wait, explain it again and see if I'm live and I want you to see we get hard while she smoked this meth with my brother, his brother up to his brothers, his brothers packing a better. I know it. He couldn't believe how big his brother's definitely in the low note. What's interesting in that no one's brought this up. A button, Nikki and all these people that have observed these videos, she's right. Like how do these maniacs, these fucking derelicts, this easy now I guess like how was he figuring out? You're right, I can hear, only figure out how to do it myself. Know how to do it. I got it, I got it. And I have my faculties, he's got a producer to just, ah, okay. Yeah. Like how has the try it out guy uploading that video. How is he airdropping to like, do you what I mean like her so, right.

Speaker 8:          02:02:34       How does he even know how to do a phone? Probably it's so true. But what's it's probably happening, which is so much more ridiculous cause he's probably like I made this video, I want to upload it and he has to like show someone like post this like yeah. And then someone's like, Oh what is this? I'm just talking about something. And then they, they have to take him through the sub. Do you have a youtube account and here's how you express it. And then, and then you want to throw a title on it, year four strokes and then, okay, what's your thumbnail? What's Amil you get to pick on that video. You like this a lot better now. It's fine. It just needs to get out there right away. And what led to him being like gotta shoot this. Yeah, I'm just getting my was the conversation right before.

Speaker 8:          02:03:18       That's what I'm saying. He was having lunch with this brand cause you can actually, you know, rest right. Restaurant my shelter. So yes, people have said it's a halfway house. It seems like that it's probably what it is. Somebody shooting dice right off camera. You're right. That's interesting. We haven't thought about the moment before. All these videos. That's it. You know what I've been talking about this. That's it. Going to share it. I keep sharing it with tables. A dude's and no one believes me putting this message out there. He's like GM, I'm telling you, it goes from a little limp Dick. Yeah, to a hardware. It's prompted by some guy who's being like, you never things I stopped smoking crack and I get hard. No. Yup. Something like, you know what I mean? Like I've had sex with six months and he's like, you know what really works?

Speaker 8:          02:04:00       And then that guy was like, that does that. That's not true. He's like, Oh yeah. He got fired up as someone who didn't believe his story. I gotta be honest, like I were a guy's struggling with, I would like maybe be like, oh, I'm gonna have something to this mouth. Like he kinda got through to me. I just want to tell your listeners like, you will not do math, do math if you've never done math and you think it's going to give you a hard dick. Like don't let that be the reason you get involved with, well no neuropathy issues. But doctor drew is our biggest, Dick was Dr Dre was saying that you shouldn't do math either to get a doctor came on and he was like never like this is not a very good formula for erectile dysfunction. It works for him. That's the thing is like bringing the family and, and, and he also went from like, my brother didn't believe me and then he believes me now meaning like there was a time where like he was telling his brother, his brother, the pros like you, you would just match and the stick thing, you're always talking about it.

Speaker 8:          02:05:06       He's like, give me the fucking pipe. And then went through with and then was like, I'm gonna pull my dick out right now, and he dragged off in front of his brother. I mean probably happened over a month. You know how you like to be courted for my would look like he did it to his brother. [inaudible] story of this video. I need to know how much of a frenzy was he in before he stop. I hate that. To leave and the spirit, you can be it. Your ticket become so sensitive to keeper become so sensitive for straight people and gay people. That's the funny thing. Humans can do it. Very inclusive drug promoter. He was like, what are you trans by? You can do it and you can try it. Yeah. There's so many other like good reasons to do. The math seems like fun for other reasons.

Speaker 8:          02:06:09       Like energy, the pick me up, you clean your house collage is being made. I just never heard the side effect of it. It's pretty cool. Pretty cool. You don't hear about the good sides to Matt. This is what you're saying. How positive the Dicks of math was. Never a Siri. You know the faces of Meth, we saw that a face deteriorates. We didn't see those. The Dick's through that chart, you're sort of just gotten harder and harder. Brilliant. Again, you with the good point. So we've never, you just created a new meme. The dicks of met. We're going to get a few posts as they come for like zombies. I don't like how he says sensitive either though. Santa Tf. Yeah, he's got a bit of a lift. It became, it had become so sensitive, thick, hot, whack. Me Ask you this, Nikki, do you prefer thick, hot white? Come to just watery come. Do you know what I mean? Like why is that a thing for him?

Speaker 8:          02:10:00       shot me shit out of this one guy. He's scaring one person to think that like people are being shot around him. Yes. There's a mass shooting. Like there's a fucking like that's the prank there. Tom's laughter and joy and I like that at all. It's pretty bad. I mean that guy is going to have PTSD from that. Yeah. There's certain breaks I don't like to, yeah. When it's too mean spirited, he's like, oh, don't fuck with him.

Speaker 13:         02:10:34       No. For the snap. I already hate it. I hate it. I know what's about to happen yet and I ain't got no date. Your finger, you find your through your bank,

Speaker 14:         02:10:48       that accent plus an animal in a video equals yeah.

Speaker 13:         02:10:52       The animals and I can never get time. Oh whoa. Oh Johnson

Speaker 14:         02:11:08       the alligator. And now they're going to toss it in the corner cause they're mad at it. But you didn't know they just did it. It's animal abuse. Oh, I hate it. I hate it. May I interject a point here about these crocodiles? Uh, I don't know if you know this. It was a cast member on road rules Australia, uh, and run nine, late nineties. I forget why. Anyways, we did a crocodile farm, whatever mission I think. And he was so cool. I got to hatch a baby crocodile. Oh yes. Now here's the thing. Within seconds of that thing coming out of its shell, it bit me what, and those teeth are hard. They're sharp as fuck. So that baby car, that was a baby crocodile. Oh. And that thing was like a team, like a preteen one maybe. Oh my God. And so when they're born, they're extremely painful. That was really cool. Yeah. And then they wanted us to cut up a pig and serve the pig parts to the crocodiles. And I was like, I think I'm a vegetarian. Like they handed us machetes and they're like, cut up the pig. And I'm like, I can't. I'm sorry. I can't. And I became a vegetarian for like a week. Wow. That's all week. I last until we went to Mcdonald's and I had to eat. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. One more. They call it in Australia.

Speaker 13:         02:12:13       Oh, I don't like this one. Oh, I hate balloons. Better do something. What? Oh no, it's a pair of the light is fine. Yeah.

Speaker 14:         02:12:38       See how she's laughing? Tom, do you see the joy in making space? So it seemed like it was an even split with Nikki though. Thud into that dumpster. I hated that video at first, but then the side, just when I close my eyes, the sound, the sound is good. The sound is funny on the skier. He, yeah, that was funny. Yup. But I don't want to hear, oh, someone breaking their leg. Sure. That's awful, right? That that's a normal reaction I'd say to, all right. Everyone's learning, everyone's learning.

These fart videos are just, you're just leaving money on the table if you're not doing them as a woman. I mean, I was just the way I do about being like, eh, that's, that's fine. Easy money. What'd you do it if you're like, I'm having that. Never, never ever, ever, ever but not, okay. Here's the thing though, we're putting your brain $50 our reality right now into that scenario.
