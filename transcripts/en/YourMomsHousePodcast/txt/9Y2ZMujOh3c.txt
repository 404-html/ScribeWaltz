Speaker 4:          00:06:54       That's it. It's, I think everybody to a degree has that fantasy. Even not, they don't do have it all the time, but there's some parts of you at some point that go, let me get away from all of this. And what's that like to dip it? Also, it's really philosophical as far as far as esophageal heartless. Offical what's the point of being so involved with this madness? The Society's consumer? Yeah. It's all consumerism and America.

If you don't know which you may be not knowing until you right now, when I tell you, this is our first episode with video of what we're listening to on display for both Christina and you, the listener. So if you go to our youtube page, it's youtube.com/your mom's house podcast. Uh, you can actually see the videos as we play them on the show. So I thought

Speaker 2:          00:08:26       that's amazing. This is a huge deal for us.

Speaker 4:          00:08:28       What is amazing is that you're going to see in the moment, but we're listening.

Speaker 2:          00:08:34       You love the ball by stepping up the Yim h game. This is a whole brand new studio, brand new stuff, doing this episode of second time. It's we like to do, but the second time better, you're going to like it. You can practice your retard

Speaker 4:          00:08:47       stuff. God Damn it. Okay, well let's open the show. Hold retired. Hey Ty. Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:09:06       Oh,

Speaker 4:          00:09:15       oh, okay.

Speaker 6:          00:09:21       Don't bring in one love to this. Well, go to your mom's house, Christina. Oh my God. That's really out of line. When did you do that? When you're off? What's that? That's an that guy's video. You were like, no, I think it was.

Speaker 4:          00:10:13       It was a different thing. So really, um, so we're back for a second time. We should address that now. Um, people probably don't know what that means. What that means is we actually did this podcast yesterday front to back over 90. We always wipe front to back. Oh, it's front to back over 90 minutes. The first time ever with the Monitor. First Time in the studio. And one of the things we did when we set up the studios, we've got new microphone. Yup. And did I do a microphone test? A microphone one? Yes. That I do a microphone test. I'm microphone to know. And what happened. I wonder why that is. Microphone too was, but

Speaker 2:          00:10:56       it's interesting now if you would ask a psychologist why you didn't test my microphone

Speaker 4:          00:11:01       July. That's what I would say. You didn't want me to have a voice and that's ridiculous. I definitely wanted you to have a voice. It just, it was the absolute biggest bummer. I mean, the worst thing is to do work for no fucking

Speaker 2:          00:11:17       yes. I've done it on that Steve, Bro, like three times where I've recorded the entire episode and then gone back and found that either sound studio had fucked me. The mikes weren't working. I've screwed up at least three or four episodes, so I totally get it. And we're right. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:11:31       no, I mean horrible.

Speaker 2:          00:11:34       Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Anyways, we're back. It's going to be better. We're getting so much better now. That's like about our file better.

Speaker 4:          00:11:42       Um, as we discussed yesterday, one of the things that I really like about this opening clip is that it brings me back to childhood. This is clearly sibling on sibling fart.

Speaker 7:          00:11:54       Um, it takes me back to memories of farting on my sister. Right. Sometimes they got me with their farts, you know, but I don't believe that. I don't think either of them had the same kind of heat they had. I mean, there's, you know, they were healthier, rancid, but sometimes real healthy eaters of real nasty farts too. They definitely farted. They forward it to mean game. I think Maria would have worst ones. He for sure files flat files. She, yeah, she definitely, oh my God, you guys are so disgusting. Definitely drop some cars. Oh my God. Oh my God. Seriously.

Speaker 7:          00:12:30       Um, so god, Oh my God. This girl though, it's perfect. I mean, yeah, she sets, I just respect it so much. She says the trap, she Bates him where she just goes, hey ty. And he's like, what's up? Yeah. And she rips a real, a real daddy farther [inaudible] yeah. And the smell. So it's hard to get the sound down. The smell. You understand that it had two lives, right? There was the initial part and then there was that kind of backdraft. Yeah. If you will like a fire. I mean, listen to this whole fart. It's pretty crazy. Sure. Really. It really is something they tie. I'll get his face as he said the time. No.

Speaker 5:          00:13:33       Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:13:36       They're so cute. They're cute. Uh, this, this really went viral, this video. Of course. It's perfect. It's perfect. Perfect. When I first saw this video is probably a little over a week ago. Um, I I saw with a few thousand views, it was sent to us and I was like, oh, that's cool. It's a fart video and it's got, well it's almost got 4 million views now. Amaze, I mean just shows you that we're, we're onto something with this first time around the sun thing. Yeah, of course. Your mom's house has always been on the cutting edge and people are like, oh, you know, you guys are shows just about farts and no, no. God who found Thursday lane? Yeah. Your mom's house. Chaos river. Yeah. Your mom's house. Yup. Peter Kane. Your mom's house. Yup. We break major stars on their show. Yup. Okay. You think it's America's got talent? No, it's your mom's house. Your mom's house. Linkedin is helpful. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:14:35       Linkedin is helpful. Breakdown is helpful or no? Ghana's helpful. Nobody really uses linkedin. I don't need the hell. I don't know. So, um, wait, seriously. Cause I get, I get invitations every day like so and so wants to add you to linkedin. Yeah. The fuck is he using it though? Complete maniacs and assholes. Linkedin is for nerds, man. You fuck, it's helpful. Breakdown is helpful and what's not? It's not. Um, it's not, it's just not all fall off. Um, yeah, and I love that it's a girl farting that's always the breast and it's not sexual. It's just like sexual, you know what I'm saying? It's not like fart on me. Right. It's not in the context of fetish. It's just like a girl farting. It's still, as much as I respect, everybody's different, you know, turn ons. Right. It is crazy that that far, it's really get people going. Sure. Is.

Speaker 7:          00:15:42       You know, it really is. It really is. I know. It's just, it's just cause it's not your lane. It's hard to fathom. And I get it. I mean, people don't get it. No. I mean I get that people, that reality that you're laying is your lane. If something's not you and you're like, that's fucking crazy. But so people like fart. It's good for it's, man, that's a lot of people's lanes. It's enough people's lanes that there's a lot of categories on the Internet. So many. Uh, well, why? I mean a lot of, there's whole studio's videos, dedicated hire sites to farts. Red Bands sent me a link of a site that is a tube site just for farts. He said that to you? Yes. He's like, I know. I know. You'd appreciate, they just like check out this park site. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. Red Band knows what's up. Yeah. We should check in by the way, a little bit later on. I'm kicking ass. We're bribing. Even look pretty stuff lately. I get notified. I don't know if you subscribe to him on Youtube. I do. So I get notified of any new, Oh, I didn't know if you did. I'm probably one of his sub five subscribers. Sub Five. What's that first five subscribers? Dumb. Is that real? I don't know. I just said it.

Speaker 7:          00:17:09       He just made that up. He made a chess to get a channel up and I was like subscribed. Yeah. Speaking. I have subscribed guys, you should be subscribing to our youtube channel right now. If you don't, if you enjoy these videos, strive. You know why we do behind the scenes. We do extras. We do unaired stuff. Talking to my dad off the air, but my shit didn't bother him many times. He's told me that if you watch that video on our, on our page at least a thousand times, he's told me, never bothered me when you shit. I'm like, why do you keep saying he's letting you know that he loves you? I know Ellis. This shit doesn't bother me. It makes me laugh. No, this smells still is an impact though. It's impact. It's horrendous. Yeah. Wow. Quite smelly. Yeah. Okay. Well, yeah. Um, speaking of it, so like my dad's ripper, I haven't noticed any a new ones, but let's, let's do check in. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I mean, yeah, it's, let's not let that fall by the wayside. You know what I'm saying? Okay. I don't want to overdo this theme, but do you want to make your special announcement or, oh look, don't you think it's time for, you should notify people though with an olive board,

Speaker 8:          00:18:30       Brown dog, Brown drawn from coming off

Speaker 7:          00:18:37       for people who are like, I listen to this show on speakers in my cubicle. God dammit. Yeah, there's porno and shit. Talk. Give you a little warning. All it's kind of a late warning. It's already started. Yeah. Um, all right. So this is something that really happened and it's so, um, substantial, the age substance to substantive that uh, you know, we're stopping the show essentially. Yeah. All right guys. Here goes March 3rd at 7:22 PM I, Christina Biedrzycki had a double pipe. Classic

Speaker 8:          00:19:16       [inaudible].

Speaker 7:          00:19:19       It's pretty amazing. It is amazing. You were sitting there. Describe it. Yeah. I described the moment for me because I was living in, I didn't really want to say, feel it. You know, you were holding our child. Yeah. What a really special, more special moment that I even recognized. You weren't holding our child and I was sitting only a few feet from you. I was distracted and you said Tom and I was like, hold on. I think it was reading, man. I go, what? And you go, I just had a double pipe classic and I dropped my phone, I dropped my phone on the ground and I said what? I said, what time is it? What could you write down the time you did mark it, you wrote the time down. I mean, what was it like? You know, people ask because we've had people email about them and yeah, tweet, you know, a guy even came up to me at a show has girlfriend and he was like a double pipe class, I guess week.

Speaker 7:          00:20:14       And his girlfriend was like, it's so disgusting. I go, I said, that's really special car. Yeah, it's the Halley's comet. A body functions. You don't cause me to have somebody who's obviously well respected in the body function game, you know? I mean they happen literally once, maybe every five years maybe. Really they're not, they're not a common, yeah, no. Cause you have to, everything has to go just right for a little bit to go up in a little bit. Right. Picks a path like 99% of the time. Well, yeah, you're right. And the reason that I happen doesn't it, sorry to interrupt shirts and go burped, fart or four simultaneous, which is the hard part. Now, luckily my anus has loosened as I've discussed, due to childbirth. And I think what happened was the burp happened and usually I have more farc control, but because I've lost FARC control, Bam. And it happened. And you know when you're in the moment you're in the game, you don't realize it until a second later. Maybe. What I don't maybe, I don't know. Will this be a more common thing? Oh, because of the pregnancy. In which case does it count as much? Of course it counts.

Speaker 7:          00:21:36       Maybe you know they're not as genuine. That's not true. Tom, don't you rob me of this gift. Look, childbirth ravaged my body. Pregnancy ravaged my body. The one gift nature gave me was the gift of farts. Now, uncontrollable bowel movements that are uncontrollable. I'm going to enjoy this wonderful gift. Okay. Okay. Well, you know, I'm just, I'm just thinking out loud. You know, how dare you try to take the validity of my double pipe classic from me? Well you just brought to my attention that things have changed. Don't shake your head. I just feel like dare you robbed me of my joy. I think that it's fair to bring it up to discuss it. That's all. It's sort of like fuck you. Okay. You heard what I said. It's sorta like you kids face is just amazing. Maybe you could use a little bit of a lesson.

Speaker 7:          00:22:34       Idexx, FedEx, Fedex. I can't, you know it's weird. My earphones or I can't hear that. Is there sound in this? There is sound. I don't hear anything Tom. I can't hear anything in the decks. Fedex, Fedex is what I hear. You don't hear that you're making that up. Only a retarded person would be like Fedex and a retarded person saying Fedex would make a lot more money on tour. You know, trying to make me retarded. It's so new. One tour as retarded. Tom and one is normal time and just see what the difference in ticket sales are. Well you know I have new agents. That's the time to bring them new ideas. So sounds like you like to do a retarded theater tour, guys. Here's the thing. I know you're thinking of booking me out as this not retarded. Stand up. What I'm saying is let's, let's revisit the game.

Speaker 7:          00:23:33       Maybe I am retarded. You know what I'm saying? And see if a retarded comic, you know what I'm saying? Could bring in more ticket sales. You feel me? You know what I'm talking about. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm talking about me coming and what do you think they would say? They'd be like, absolutely Mr Segura. Absolutely. They want to commission and you're going to make so much money as Thompson were retarded comedian, but you're going to make so many, like what I'll need to do then is establish that I'm retarded. Like people that are coming to the shows now know me as a not retarded guy, so I don't want to get a new persona. I mean, I knew name, right? No, I think it's just the evolution. You know? I have a solution. It's like I'm retarded. Yeah. Lino like Lucy Kay.

Speaker 7:          00:24:15       His children got older. He talked about that. He got a divorce. He talked about that. Right? This is just your evolution as a comedian. How did I become retarded though? Those natural, it's not natural. You woke up one day retarded, so just walk out on stage. It's fine. People just let Twitter. Let the people on Twitter tell you. Oh good. That's where I like to take my cues. Let the Twitter people telling you how to do it. We'll see. Let's see guys, do you want to hear Tom Sager retarded comedian? Just tweet at him. Let him know that's harm cigarette. Thanks baby.

Speaker 8:          00:24:48       Oh Jan was in you. You say you go forward.

Speaker 7:          00:24:52       I had to show a challenge. He's throwing down the gauntlet. I feel like that sounds kind of retarded. What if I walked out on stage?

Speaker 8:          00:25:03       Yeah,

Speaker 7:          00:25:07       as wrong. He's retarded. You know with Dany Jakks what's her name? Danny. Danny. That was the first obviously mentally ill person that we've kind of poked fun at. That's a bit of a stretch of a comment, but, but that's what I'm saying. I don't think like, I think they've all been a little and

Speaker 9:          00:25:34       hey, hey, hey. No Hitler. Just wanted to tell you that. I really do. Let me a, yeah. I also want to tell you that the place where I'm actually going to poop in your mouth is actually in your mouth. Oh, not actually outside of it. Um, and I probably might smear it on your nose and

Speaker 7:          00:26:05       but see, yeah, she just said I'm going to do it in your mouth, not outside of it. And now she's married on your nose. I mean like where are you pooping? You know what I mean? It's interesting cause they must've had a, the, the preceding conversation where he was like, wait a minute, do I need, you're going to poop in my mouth in my mouth or around my mouth? And she's clarifying. No, no, no. It's in your mouth. You know what I think actually happened? She probably told her plans of pooping. Hmm, I'm going to poop on his mouth to Hitler. Oh, hello. I was like, wait a minute. That's a main labs. Are you doing in the mouth or on those? Very, very important distinction. Those are two different kinds. He said you should make a video where you can see clearly where you're going to the pope. And then she goes, thanks Hitler. And then I made this video. You should make a video clearly stating you're pooping intentions. Yeah. Why are you going to Scott the tiny tiny acts need to know now. Ah, for cause that is a big thing in Germany. Yeah. The Germans are love shine, shine, shine, shine some pot. So Hitler told her to do this is what you're saying. Yeah. He's like, he was like, Donnie, do you want to want to suck on these me ups of mine

Speaker 9:          00:27:29       on your chest, you know, stuff like this. And since I actually love you a lot, you know, uh, I just want to tell you that I really do miss you and I really do love you. And Yeah. Um, hopefully if you ever need to, uh, I'll uh, be making more videos. Okay. All right. Bye. Cheerio Darling.

Speaker 7:          00:27:58       You know, it's really creepy. Is that she only blinked once all of the open stare the whole time. That's hard to do. That is hard to do. There's one, oh sorry. I guess I caught her on. Huh?

Speaker 9:          00:28:11       Your mouth? Not Actually,

Speaker 7:          00:28:13       but there was a while about,

Speaker 9:          00:28:15       and I probably

Speaker 7:          00:28:16       it's way off. Sorry. Towards the end I was like, she hasn't blinked in wow.

Speaker 9:          00:28:21       And you know on your face on your chest and you know, stuff like that. So since I actually love you a lot and

Speaker 7:          00:28:30       I like that she thought of the um, the poop as a gift. Sure. Yeah. Right. Most people, women. Yeah. I did want to give me a gift. Does that what you're saying? Well, it makes me kind of reevaluate what gifts are. Maybe I could give you a poopy gift sometime. I think you already to be kisses you Dale. It's at your farts are, yeah, that's kind of sweet. But it just kind of sweet. I like that you said this is probably the first person with something wrong mentally that we were making. I just never occurred to me that a lot of them probably something's going on. Yeah, yeah, I think, I think so. Um, this will be clearly, well, somebody sent me a video to check out this dude. His name is crazy. Lokes mm. And uh, he's putting it down like a beast and Walmart, you got to check this guy out. What's up? How crazy lopes right here. How many no saying yeah. Pharrell's

Speaker 10:         00:29:42       God is good homie. Shit. Crazy low Scott to Keith. Thanks. Fruition. How army you don't say for real style?

Speaker 7:          00:29:50       No. Yeah. I don't know if you think he has mental problems. Um, I'd say yeah. Right off the bat you say. Yeah. Yeah. He seems excited to be at Walmart making a video. So he's set up his camera on obviously a merchandise shelf and is kind of swaying back and forth touching his ponytail. Yeah. Um, and he said, you know, God is real. You know what I'm saying? And you can tell that he's ramping up to something. You know, it's, it's beginning. The wheels are just starting to turn. I wonder why the theme of Walmart Wyant why necessarily putting it down like a beast and wall. What's the Walmart connection? There's other customers are walking by that notice the crazy lugs is putting it down

Speaker 10:         00:30:34       from now and say the n sound homie. No salary for reals. No. How many shall goes out to every body doing the buying and stuff like that.

Tend to tolerate his. Tip it down. Moving all around. Now you'll notice he has kind of a, a paraplegic guys gripped. Yes. It's not normal. It's not. It's not a normal fist. I mean, I don't know what you know about what, not a lot, but I do know that when you make a fist and you punch, it should be like right straight. They probably not like this. You had never hold your thumb and not, no. Yeah. Yeah. It's very, it's a peculiar way, right? Oh, for sure. Yeah. He's really, he's definitely put it down. We go,

Speaker 10:         00:32:10       yes. I mean, wow. It's intense side Walmart begging. Well, I'm just glad I'm not at that Walmart. Oh yeah, I'd get rid of May where the shoulder row. Oh, go to the side like that.

Speaker 7:          00:32:26       No deal. I would say he's not very technically sound. No, but he has ideas. Spa Spark

Speaker 10:         00:32:36       for him to win. I guess. Mayweather's on May 2nd. Yeah. Boop, boop, boop, boop.

Speaker 7:          00:32:49       He just literally like this. He did a straight up press, a straight press over his head as one of his punches. No Punch that exists. Like it's almost like he's like a king of Improv when it comes to punches. I was going to say is I've never seen a punch like that. Has He trained?

Speaker 10:         00:33:08       It's a good question. I mean it looks like the statements together. School of Kiki punching. Here's what amazed me. How do you learn the sound I was going to give y'all no more videos but crazy. Laos just live in like a beast. Oh God. Yeah, buddy shall goes out to everybody doing their thing, stuff like that. And his gang and the gang keep every thank pushing your now, but reels down from the training to the rat been, oh, you're now,

Speaker 7:          00:33:56       do you sense mental illness are not on this one? It's not right. So one thing I noticed was how bad his punching was. And then this motherfucker isn't a proper gym. He looks great. He's a, is he a fighter? No, there's no legitimate. No. Well then why does he, he looks official. He now, okay, now watch a box. No. Oh Geez. Even I know that's not good for him and I'm not a profession. I feel like what? I don't know is this guy, like the guy that walks a retarded kid at the bus stop. No, God, no. I'm saying like, is this guy being nice to him? I think it's a mercy. You think so? Because he's kind of, he's got the head gear on. He's like, Oh yeah, no, I mean look, this is, this is some bullshit right here. Bam. It was, yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:34:49       I mean, what? What? You know, he's, he's touched, he's not touched crazy lug spars with smooth hands coming in angles. What, what so bizarre. Well, okay, there's a lot of him fighting. Yeah. He likes to fight Vinay. The name of this video is crazy. Lokes sparring with homie with a lot of heart, which made clergy lokes hold back. So he's saying like, because this guy had heart, I'm not giving him the full business right now. Crazy. Loucks but like, this is, you know, it's technically horrific, right? What was he just doing right there? We see skip, skip, skip, skipping. He's still, but he's still, he's still more

I feel like crazy. Lokes has his own lane. Yes. The crazy looks. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 4:          00:38:38       Speaking of fighting by the way, um, last week I played for you.

Speaker 2:          00:38:43       I'm living or whatever the fuck I want. Life kind of Mcgregor,

Speaker 4:          00:38:46       he lost, he lost over the weekend. It was a huge upset. Um, Nate Diaz took the fight on 10 days notice. Beat Conor McGregor for the first loss and then Holly Holm who knocked out your home girl Ronda Rousey. She was choked unconscious, uh, by uh, Misha Tate. So two huge upsets on the same card. If you had bet a hundred dollar parlay that Misha Tate and Nate Diaz would win, you would have won a little over $1,400 at most last Vegas betting houses. Pretty good stuff. No,

Speaker 2:          00:39:26       you know, I love Rhonda Rousey. I just think she's wonderful. She's a real nice lady. I really like, uh, I like to see her when I hope she challenges that lady again.

Speaker 4:          00:39:37       Yeah. Well I think what will happen is I think the UFC, you know, they don't want to waste time making money. So I think, right. I think with Misha being the new champ and Rhonda still being every, you know, a lot of people, so they want to see what's up. I think they're gonna put those two together. Good. I had a big fight coming up. What, what just fight was that, was that one 96 or for out to forget that it was one 96. Right. So maybe that like the big 200, something like that. Maybe. I don't know. Hmm. I would imagine that that's what they're gonna

Speaker 2:          00:40:09       oh, that's exciting. Oh Wow. Crazy. Lokes there we go. Front of new, uh, you know, saying stuff like that. Nonsense.

Speaker 4:          00:40:21       I'll show you this for a while. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:40:24       okay. Oh, um, oh, is this, well, there's some other stuff on the right there. We probably can't.

Speaker 12:         00:40:30       Hi. I'm, Oh yeah. And I'm here to fail at. This is such a beautiful villa. We seeding with the first time of my ever experience in my life with the two young men and they had big car to offer me. This villa is really quaint place.

Speaker 2:          00:41:02       It's very quaint. So it's important that we know the quaintness of the villa where she's getting random by two guys. Can I tell you what I do love about Kenai? Yes. Positive. Always looking on the bright side. She's not, you know what I mean? The villas. Beautiful looker. Yeah, no, I'm smoking. I looked up some stuff by the way, because last week we were talking about what's the story

Speaker 4:          00:41:25       Ameren and ideal theory. My theory was that she used to be maybe heavily pursued and that maybe now

Speaker 7:          00:41:34       she wants a little charge in her life, a little bit venture because she's getting older and she's like, well, I probably still have a few years left where I'm holding it together. Might as well just go all out. Um, and then I found this interview. This is a, another interview with her. And uh, we, we learned a little bit about her in this, so I pulled it up to this moment, her backstory. A little bit. A little bit. Yeah. I got to say, look at her tits. Her body's amazing. She's 61 years old. It's incredible. She looks better than her abs. Crazy. Jesus. These Asian ladies, I tell you, they hold together. Well, white ladies, we fall apart. Yeah. Fuck white ladies.

Speaker 7:          00:42:25       I'm pulling all the way from the Midwest, right? Yes. By the way, the guy, the guy that does this in every porn, the interview guy, they're always the worst. You can imagine what creeps they are by their voice. Well, and they're always kind of shitting on the girls. There's always a tone of like you stupid bitch instead of being like, no, no, no, you should be nice to her. She's making sure you have a fucking Gig. Retard. Be Nice. Why do you have to demean them? I know you also try out. They do like a lot of dad jokes, like boner jokes

Speaker 12:         00:42:58       with her husband. She's here with her husband after how many years? Five years. Five years. Five years. Your husband watching you have sex, is that common? Unusual because it's the first time it's ever happened or have a hand. Uh, this is, I feel like it sounds like Baba booey. Oh, right. The guy. I got a picture of him. This is the pre interview shit that he got nervous and Horny and weird. And of course it's my first time that my husband absorb what? Observed doing what you're doing, what you're doing, what you do and gross. I feel that for him is really exciting for me. I feel that is maybe I'm testing my own strength. Testing your own strength. What can I do? Did you enjoy it while you were doing testing the strength of asshole?

Speaker 7:          00:43:56       Yeah. Yes. Sorry, I didn't know you guys and said, okay. Yes, but um, she's really mad. A Ding Dong. This chick is smarter. Yeah. She's not your average porno girl.

Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Um, what are you good at it?

Speaker 12:         00:44:49       Um, I'm not sure. I think very honest. She's so thoughtful. Yeah. I think someone, other people have to be the judge of that while I'm doing it. I feel super good. Yeah. And that's, that's what everybody's kept on asking me. How are you doing? I was an answer up there.

Speaker 7:          00:45:12       Don't hear yet. Orchard is a sure way to know if you're doing it right. Okay. At the end of your scene with the guy, did he come? Yes, you did it. Congratulations.

Speaker 7:          00:47:09       do girl, you do. I look at her positive self esteem. This girl was like the Aristotle of four. Now some reasonable video though.

Speaker 2:          00:49:39       not gentlemen and they're not being nice. Being Nice. I hate when they fingered so aggressively like, but no one's no one's one. Whoops. This is just a her, she was screaming, man, that's going on cheese with animals, animals, animals. Is Roy just animals. We're all animals. You know, I can talk. I think she's really going after her. Um, most repressed feelings for 50 years. If he's 67 years old and she's taking a car, can shout and get against her as another guy rails or she's been holding on to sup, man. She's been making up for lost time. Do you think she was held as like a slave in a Thai

Speaker 7:          00:50:28       kingdom? I don't know man. Maybe she was a slave. She hasn't been around gentlemen like that. Maybe she has been working on at the time massage place for 20 press years. Sleeping on a cot in the back, microwaving her smelly food.

Speaker 4:          00:50:41       Third where you walk in and you're like, it doesn't really smell like eucalyptus. Also smell like yellow curry

Speaker 7:          00:50:48       all the time. It's a smell like their lunches and then maybe it's 20 years of her going mapquest show and feel the most pressure and she got sick of it.

Speaker 4:          00:51:00       Yeah. Maybe man. Maybe as she realized after 20 plus years, you know, 20 competitors come out as polyamorous and now I'm excited to share that I'm bisexual.

Speaker 7:          00:51:14       I'm excited to share that makes I'm Paula and I'm by, yeah, maybe that's what you said was one of my favorites and a good moment.

Speaker 4:          00:52:16       That's my favorite is the old school thing of somebody saying something and someone goes, Mary's going to talk to somebody like that. It couldn't be real. It's gotta be something's wrong with you. Fixed yourself. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. They just see it as wrong.

Speaker 14:         00:52:34       Ah,

Speaker 4:          00:52:36       so low all I pulled this up because this guy has the same name as our son. Now I was sent this, I liked that the video is called, uh Oh, this is, no, this is the wrong thing. Actually. This is the remix.

Speaker 7:          00:53:45       True. And I actually support that 100%. That idea that you, you know, if somebody's, um, underwhelms you at their communication skills and their job is something else,

Speaker 2:          00:53:57       it's not your Jack. It's not getting job, sweetie. Yeah, it's really not. It's not, but they should. But that being said, the other guys on the team know like, Hey Ellis, not so good on the mic. So maybe we should, maybe we shouldn't let this guy talk for the day.

Speaker 7:          00:54:14       Every one of these teams, by the way, has a PR person. Sure. They know everybody's strengths, they know everything. They know that Ellis on the mic is going to be a problem. So like if Brah Brah Hey, you got to put Ellis in front of a Mike, you want to talk some shit that's going to go down. Okay. Because Ellis Ellis man, you like, um, like if were you like if you would be like, Oh, if you put Ellis on the mic, like I'm just going to go poorly man. I worked with a guy that had that same thing like little tick. He'd be like, like, like, like let Christina you want me to like lately like upload a Lego Lego. Do you think that this is a tick? Is that what it is?

Speaker 2:          00:55:04       Yeah. At some kind of nervous tick. Sure. It's like saying like the way you say in California,

Speaker 7:          00:55:11       I. Dot. I got a problem with like, I probably lag tool. You know what I'm saying? Shit. I would say that to everybody. Filming. I have a like problem, but nothing like has like, I'm problem Lego. I'm like, um, like, um, lag, lag, lag. I'm like, so do you think, uh, would this constitute us making fun of somebody with a problem like that?

Speaker 2:          00:55:38       He's not touched. I don't think he's special. No. No. I think he's nervous and he doesn't know what the fuck to say. Yeah. It happens. Yeah. It's a gluten thing. You know, Mike's on him. He's,

Speaker 7:          00:55:51       do you think this guy has a problem? I'm a Martian. This does our URL like guys are, well, here's our mom. Mom. Yeah. Now that guy, but he has something going on. But then yeah, Ellis like,

Speaker 14:         00:56:10       oh wow. Like, um, I was like, um, like I'm, I'm just on my own. I was just reading it right. I was on and I'll read it on my man or whatever. Any hail

Speaker 7:          00:56:23       camp. What else on a mic man?

Speaker 14:         00:56:25       [inaudible] by Amy. Maybe Ellison speaks into halo and it, and picked it out there. Okay. You're driving it. Yes sir.

Speaker 7:          00:56:36       Maybe he should just do yes or no answers. Correct. He's nailed that twice, right? He did. On the partners on the positive side. Ellis, you can answer yes and no. Pretty much say yes sir. Knocked that shit out of the park, man. Just all the other words aren't really working. I just remember two, we also found Auntie Fifi remember her? Yeah. Oh yeah. Um, an angel's fellatio secrets. Yup. We brought her to angel's, ours. A auntie Fifi was, she sings. There's two, there's Auntie fee, I think, who does the baking. We're talking about on the fee fee fee. Who's the religious lady from Texas soon? Things that don't even always add up. We haven't checked in with her lately and I've looked on her Facebook. I didn't see any new video, so she may have stopped doing the, the music like today. I was thinking, Oh man, Dan. Oh yeah. Yeah, a little out there. She's uh, she's great. Um, but this one we all bleed. Yeah. Um, let's see if he can do the second question.

Speaker 14:         00:57:32       Oh, Christ, you got to pick up ice tripping out. Right. Trip it out. That's so funny.

Speaker 7:          00:57:40       Just dismissing that. Like was he's bugging out, right?

Speaker 14:         00:57:50       Moscow like, uh, like I just didn't work at Holiday Inn all been praying and stuff and it's um, and his own coming to you thinking you were getting it to the end down on. You didn't want to know. What were you, I was trying, I was trying to use, yeah, no, he's good. Oh, I know him. He's our eyes shut. We, since the emergency outside, try to make it early and, and Jean and that. I was like, Oh shit. She called the seven round cakes. I like,

Speaker 7:          00:58:26       oh, what tripped him up. What do you, what do you think sends him into the spiral? Um, it's just wanting to, to, you know, where is it here? Just wanting to, to

Speaker 14:         00:58:39       Rena, right.

Speaker 7:          00:58:40       People saying, what's the sound like he knows what he's saying. Knows that he's in front of people. Yeah. Just nervous about it. And then his, like, I'm thinking over here.

Speaker 14:         00:58:53       Yes. How can I go home?

Speaker 7:          00:59:36       This is a new thing. Or from like, I'm recording. I'll put the house on that microphone long. He's got like a western, some western European. Yeah, he is. He's probably got Austrian or Dutch. Yep. I see that. This reminds me, this reminds me of Rodman when he was in North Korea. Oh my God. He was given the press and while, while watch this, yeah. And the whole team was like, dude, could you fucking dial it back? Yeah. Don't let Donald that the interview, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll watch this bullshit. Yeah. He, um, that was definitely not his best day. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:00:26       so speaking of, uh, the king of Improv,

Speaker 7:          01:00:35       there's a new,

Speaker 15:         01:00:37       mmm.

Speaker 7:          01:00:39       Steven Sea Gal.

Speaker 15:         01:00:41       Where is it? Here? Yes.

Speaker 7:          01:00:44       Trailer. Yeah. Oh, you're kidding. No. Didn't we just see it a new Steven Seagal trailer? The answer to that would be yes, but I mean I am the king of him province naturally natural is such a piece of shit that I'm about to show you.

Speaker 4:          01:01:11       And again, if you're listening to the show, I encourage you to look it up, but you can also watch it with us. You can go to our youtube channel. We are on youtube or watching this on a monitor that you can see with us.

Speaker 15:         01:01:25       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:01:25       This trailer is called the Asian connection. Um, it's brand new.

Speaker 7:          01:01:32       The Asian isn't there like a, um, it's a pretty common title. Like the Asian. Can I the European, the [inaudible] is a very, very famous movie. Okay. So this is, they really went out on a limb the, to find something else there yet. Well this must be a play on that film. Yes. That's an exceptional film. If you haven't seen it, it's real though. You don't think this is going to be exceptional time. I've seen this and this is a fucking dog Turd. Um, I mean, okay, so the last one was like the member of the Iraqi Afghanistan wine that they shot in Calabasas and this one man. Well, the premise of that film was just shoot, shoot, shoot, Bang, Bang. Steven Seagal kills people. And yes. So what do you think this one's going to be? There's a lot,

Speaker 4:          01:02:16       a lot of emperor that he holds up to his improv. I think in the the trailer you go,

Speaker 7:          01:02:20       he improvised that. Yeah, I think there's a lot of Improv. Okay. Yeah. So, so you just went up the first hole, not down to the other one. You gotta get, you gotta get your ass hole snip. Ma'Am. I do. Okay. Let's, um, let's run through this room. I'm really excited. Okay. Here we go. Oh, Jesus Christ.

Speaker 6:          01:02:42       Not enough room for the most, some of us. That means one of us has to die.

Speaker 7:          01:02:53       So He's standing still. The other guys doing all the words. It's just, you can tell. Yes, he, he fights. Yeah, totally. Still. And they also, they make sure to shoot it where you don't see how fat he is. Of course. No. And that is very, believe me, old black dye. Make sure that he's just like shooting from the ceiling and cut around me. Yeah. That and the fat. The attorney's guy out. But he's wearing, what is that called? AG , I dunno. Well this is very forgiving. This outfit is basically pajamas thick. Heavy. It covers the flaws. Yeah. Yeah. And it's all black. The medallion, I don't know. He's got, and he's got on his, his, his range glasses. His gun range glasses, yellow, 10 sure. Blacker than black dye for the goatee. Head wrap covering up the jet black dark hair on top would, that means one of us has to die. So there's a premise of the film is that he's going to kill people, right? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:03:53       Not enough room for the most. Some of us. That means one of us has to die.

Speaker 9:          01:04:06       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:04:07       Out of practice. Smile friend. He's from the crazy Logue school of fighting me. Oh, he is from the cause. You love.

Speaker 16:         01:04:18       Wow.

Speaker 7:          01:04:22       No,

Speaker 6:          01:04:25       these titles look better than the other me see out. He paid for the title. Now

Speaker 7:          01:04:31       what else are they said? Michael J. White is in there. Okay. Okay. Okay. Alright. Um, and show Jack Budand. Tanka guy. That guy is this, is this a pim poo? Bear Poo. Bear. Do I have the Michael Dry white wine in there? No. No. That's the one

Speaker 16:         01:04:49       before Otis. It's a one right before this day. Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:04:53       Telling Harry. Yeah. I don't know why I can't or 60 press mills there, right? No. Getting to know Kimmy. Maybe it's not on here.

Speaker 16:         01:05:07       Hmm.

Speaker 7:          01:05:07       Oh, make a can get on makeup. Dreaded. Get over it. Okay. All right. Um, all right. Well in many ways make note of Michael Jai White. Okay.

Speaker 17:         01:05:19       Michael Jai [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          01:05:33       also for a trailer. Like that pacing on this thing is so fucking, it's an action trailer. Should be, it's a robbery cut to Bam. Bam money. Yeah. Like let's go walking in. We're going to take everything now. Shoot, shoot, shoot. Show them going into the room. Grabbing the bag rug. No. Yeah. Look, it's a four and a half, four minute, 12 second trailer. Should a trailer B 90 90 seconds, usually the standard and then long trailers are considered two minutes, maybe a little over two minutes. That's a long trailer. These 32nd trailers. Sometimes this is cause and you know why? It's because Steven Seagal himself self indulgent and he's standing behind the editor at the Edit Bay going, oh no, you got to put in there longer. You got to put me in doing this and that. Whatever the shot of me standing there, I'm like, didn't think that would put a fucking in. Stephen thinks that he's the director. I guarantee that's why. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what? People like to see what's happening in the movie. Um, so look, this is just getting started, man.

Speaker 17:         01:06:45       Who the fuck are these guys? Who Cares? You don't have to work at the club anymore. That could have been quick robbery where we get it.

Speaker 7:          01:07:07       See how it shows how it shows like the Buddha, he's always like, but it showed them, why don't you just cut to, you don't need in the trailer to establish how you do that in a movie. A movie. We need to see where are we for context. But trailer you just cut to his mind and usually they tell you where you're located. They would say Vietnam or whatever, where they're shooting this. Yeah,

Speaker 17:         01:07:31       your money was wrong. They get away with about 200,000 voice. You the motherfucker told me that.

Speaker 7:          01:07:41       Wow. And the effort and the trailer to the motherfucker that totally, he put a little hot sauce on it. He did and he did eyebrow acting, aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you the mother fit and said, aren't you the motherfucker? Is it, aren't you the motherfucker? Yeah. Aren't you the motherfucker that told me to put the money there?

Speaker 17:         01:08:06       Aren't you the mother fucker? He's ridiculous. I just want fucking results

Speaker 7:          01:08:17       to Fox. Yeah. And the sound mixing where you can barely hear him talking as though that angelic singing background over this. So there are three of them are mixed together. Horrible. I just want to see fucking results. This is a new level for him. This is usually you see actors doing stuff like this once they're full blown alcoholics, you know, and they had a queer like 30 years. Right. Then they do the straight to DVD thing and it's, this is his Gerard Depardieu. Ah, yeah. He's at the end. I just want to see fucking result fucking results. And they're like, Steve, uh, I don't know if we should curse. Yeah, much shut the fuck up.

Speaker 17:         01:09:00       I don't want to hear any stories about how it's going to be. I just want to give you the names of the banks in Cambodia. Did you want to run my service? 50% it makes no sense.

Speaker 7:          01:09:21       That's a weird moment to, I'm going to tell you where to rob banks and he just went to Steven and me a beat before I was like, my banks are being wrong. Yeah. And then his fee for telling the guy where to rob is 50% so he's robbing his own banks, but the, now he's having Steven Seagal find out who's robbing the banks. I Dunno.

Speaker 17:         01:09:42       Nice to see. I'd be like this greedy. I want to buy some heat heat. That's Michael Jai white guns, man. No, I'm like check

Speaker 7:          01:10:02       another fun.

Speaker 17:         01:10:10       The guard was killed. What are you getting self nearer the gardens.

Speaker 18:         01:10:16       Ah, ah, ah. Did

Speaker 7:          01:10:20       you see that? There's a little sexy playful time and I think that's the girl is dating the bank robber, right? That was the girl. Now she's dating Steven Seagal who you know, knows a lot of special sexual techniques. Of course. I think he's a study. Uh, all the eastern love [inaudible] he'd be like, well you leave your girl [inaudible] she's going to come out of butthole for sure. You will come from your butthole can make it come from your bud off. Fucking real good. Jeez. JKD yellow sunglasses off. You're going to paint them brown with all that bucket. I think he's definitely going on with you today. You know what? We should do it down for later butthole. Oh

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:11:15       I want to talk a little bit about the white tigers practices because in this DVD we're using some of the techniques from that practice. I practice as a white tigers for about a year and one of the premises and there's a lot to the practice. A lot. It's a lot too.

Speaker 4:          01:11:29       I bet he knows. Oh, on your face. He knows about white tigress practice. I bet he does.

Speaker 2:          01:11:36       I love that scene. That's such a, it's such a typical scene from an action film where he's training and Gung Fu. He's training the girl or the two of them are training. It's like the Matrix does it. It's the karate kid moment. The Mister Miyagi Roman mentor moment. Yeah. It's so awful.

Speaker 17:         01:11:52       Oh,

Speaker 4:          01:11:56       this was shot. No sense. This is how this went. They said, we have an idea for a movie and we want you to be in a Steven. Well, tell me about it. Yeah, well you're going to be this bad ass and you're going to kill the other boss and you're going to make this girl come out of her butt and you're going to, you know, all of this crazy person. He's a problem is all we have right now are iPhones to shoot it on. And he goes, that's not a problem. And they go, you sure I don't mind. Well, the thing is we need to raise financing to make this movie. I'll pay for it. No Shit. I'll give you thousand dollars. And then they're like, okay,

Speaker 2:          01:12:38       that's enough to buy chargers for all the iPhones that made this film. And then to edit it and I moved,

Speaker 4:          01:12:44       comes with your mind, your will, your fucking iPhone. Nailed it. And then they were like, no, I think we have enough money to make this movie now. He was like, make the fucking movie. Right.

Speaker 17:         01:12:51       What the fuck

Speaker 4:          01:12:58       lot of Miss Shabi um, blended. The bullets are ricocheting off anything. None of them are hitting glass.

Speaker 17:         01:13:04       No, no. It's terrible that guys, that guys, I don't know who these two are. I Dunno.

Speaker 4:          01:13:12       Imagine if they just thought they played this trailer on the radio. Like they play movie trailers. If you've seen this, you'd be like, what the fuck? Black Bang, Bang, Bang, remain. And also when does this ever end?

Speaker 2:          01:13:24       Well, it's ever, ever been. This is, we're halfway through it and this is the longest hurler my life. And not only that, usually when there's a motorcycle scene, they'll play the audio of the room. They're not, they didn't even bother putting the audio of the motorcycle. No going fast and they used

Speaker 4:          01:13:40       the same effect for the gun over and so I'm the gun. That's when he pulls out a handgun.

Speaker 17:         01:13:53       That guy, who the fuck is this

Speaker 4:          01:13:54       sky? I don't know athletes like just run on that building and jump out. Right?

I don't know Stephen C Gow on Michael. There we go. So this is it. This is what I wanted to show. So they're in the movie together, which is what, cause I remember seeing this a while ago. Hollywood tough guy. In your opinion, you've accepted. Of course. When you say tough guide, you mean martial artists are just timing. I mean Steven, for

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       real. If he was on the street and there was a situation you wanted this Hollywood guide by your side because he could defend himself. So do you understand that the question clearly?

Speaker 2:          01:17:20       Just one moment. Yeah. I got to point it out because I have the same problem. I bags look at the bloated mess. Yes. That, and I know this cause I fucking have the same problem. This is diet. This is all night drinking, eating sausage, pork rinds for breakfast and look at the Chins. Yeah, I know. It's a lot. It's a lot. It's a lot. This is all diet is all what you put into your mouth. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:17:46       So our buddy there, so he's asking, he's asking him which Hollywood tough guy would you, if you were in a real situation, would you want by your side? Okay. Okay. And he's like,

Speaker 16:         01:18:07       it's that hard to think of a legit one. Can you think of one? Michael Jai White. Can I laugh in your face? Really? Yes.

Speaker 4:          01:18:23       Pretty crazy, right? Holy Shit on him. But he's in the movie. I know. Years later. I mean that was, well, not years, but that was probably a couple of years old. And, um, but I just thought it was interesting that he was like, do you see his, his eye roll? He was like, yeah, John, I think your face.
