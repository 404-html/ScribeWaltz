Speaker 7:          00:06:12       Coleman, your grandmother's hair.

Speaker 6:          00:06:30       So where are his top teeth? I Dunno. And I also noticed that there weren't so many molars on the side bottom. It seemed like it was just kind of see now how did I know? Just based on the, the small, narrow row of bottom teeth I saw, I was like, this guy doesn't have, I don't know if like over here and over here, nothing there. It's blank. Two, three, four, five. You don't need a lot more than five. I know that much. Those are actually the most useless teeth. The ones in the front, bottom row, you don't need those for shit. It's the Maulers you really need. And those are the ones that fall out the most. I feel he's right here though, are the scariest dead. This look nice guy. He's like, I'm going to comb your grandmother's hair. Fuck. This might be a whole new lane of, and by the way, this is also a guy, this is who I see as being like, Hi Christina. Good morning. Yeah.

This is going to be a whole new lane for us. It's a lot of pressure on the video. I feel it though. I, my spidey senses are tango is going for people that go that's coming either don't know. I mean 98% of the time, you know, we are seeing this with you. It's not like this is prepared. And I go, oh, I know it's wrong. Let me tell you why I think this is good. Uh, the backgrounds terrible again, he's in a class is wearing a shirt, which is not protocol. You know, as we think that he's a little too sensible. He's got something weird to tell us cause he's in a private and closure. Isn't the car adding up? Let's see.

I wasn't going there with it but I was going there. That's what he wants it. He wants to come in your grandma's hair. He wants to mash it down. Like give him, give her a good boy here. He brushes it to the side parts, it all might come there. Skidway that's what he really wants to do. So it's so scary. You know what's even scarier? Imagine if this guy is actually, oh, we'll say just a really nice guy. He's like, Hey, was that a funny video? I'm, I was scared to death. I was just terrified. Like his son was like, make a viral video. He's like, hey man, it's one about combing your grandmother's hair. I was like, no. Did read really wrong. Read real scary. He has to know he's creepy.

Speaker 6:          00:10:40       blue band. Send me the rest of this fucking video. Yeah. This is not the whole story. Some something's going on. Oh my God. This baby's moving so fast. This kid does somersaults and me all fucking day. He's going to come out while gene. You better brace yourself. Oh my God, Dude. Oo Dancing on my bladder. Anyways, um, I did my Netflix shoot this last week. Great. Uh, Las Vegas. What's well, it's Las Vegas and our language. A lost anus. Anus. I want to thank everybody that came out to the taping. Joey Diaz and I were on the same night with Yama. Nika and I gotta tell you it was fucking chaos. I think it was crazy. That was pretty wild for people that it was crazy. We're not at that show. It was in downtown Las Vegas, right on Fremont Street and a bar there. Normally a musical venue. It was called like backstage billiard, so it was a proper rock venue, but they built a special set for the stage and then you have an eco went up the gray than you are in the wings ready to go now. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       So I'm getting ready. I'm fucking seven months. What? Almost eight months pregnant. Yeah. And I'm standing backstage and there's a music cue, some rock song like Jeez, a cowgirl one. Know Dan. I'm like, yeah, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:12:07       And then can picture too, you know, obviously there's a couple of hundred people there. Yeah. Um, full, you know, obviously crew for a production backstage. It's like all the producers and all the executives and there's video village. It's just, it's very busy. There's a lot going on. There's a smoke machine rolling the smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke and there's smoke. And then I'm standing right

Speaker 3:          00:12:30       there and I'm waiting for my cue to go out on the stage to do the first show. My first set ever of this taping, right. The smoke is going and I noticed that the production person is having trouble opening the door to the stage. And like Fifo, I watch our dogs and the brilliance of Fifo, not so much bitsy. Uh, but fif is that when he sends his danger, you know what that dog does? He gets the fuck out of the way. Yeah. You see his spidey sense? Yeah. Eyebrows actually ray. Yeah. Yes. No, and I, I swear to you, and I'm not saying this as a bit, I did think of Fifo at that moment and I was like, oh, I think I should get out of the way. Some tells me something bad is about to happen. I swear to God. And I moved away cause I was like, this is dangerous.

Speaker 3:          00:13:21       And Lo and behold, a heavy fucking, I don't know, seven foot door door, what? Indoor and this poor production lady, she's opening it and it falls like just centimeters, millimeters from my hand and it falls down and crashes down right where I was just standing. And of course everybody's freaking out and they have to Redo it and reset it. And I'm, we're all in the back waiting to go up. So that was what happened right before I went up. And what I thought to myself, this is really good luck because when I had my first special taping, remember that guy that took a shit during my shell and then he kept flushing the toilets over and over in Seattle and I had to stop my set and be like, is somebody going to address the toilet flushing? Yes guys taking a shit during my, somebody was shitting in the middle of my show and fucking up sound. So I feel as though it's a good omen when something like that happens and the first tape, the first taping went and was good. It was great. The second one was even better and we got, we got what we needed so it's going to be a great show. I hope you guys enjoy it and thank you again for coming. So we had a good time in Vegas.

Speaker 1:          00:14:27       New Gene. The A, the second show was was killer. That was the jam. Yeah. Thank God for a second. Shit. God, they tape two shows every show. I feel like every time I take something, a specialist they shower. Yeah, for sure. And you ended up, you always end up, it's funny cause you go, it's all about the second show. You always end up using something from the first show. Yeah. You don't remember at the time, but when you watch the cut you're like, oh actually that was how I like it more. Yeah. But the usually, I don't know, like the vibe

Speaker 3:          00:14:53       energy's always better on the second show because you shake the, shake the nerves off from the first show and then by the second one you're relaxed. The audience, it's a little bit later in the evening, other little loose, but a man that was like, I got to tell you, I don't, I'm not a huge, we're not a huge Vegas couple. It's not really our jam. Speak for yourself. Um, but being in that downtown location was just quiet. I forgot. Like I forgot.

Speaker 1:          00:15:20       Brought back the memories of our, when we lived in Korea town, downtown adjacent here. You mean the rampart? Yeah, the Rampart Division. Macarthur Park. Um, you see a lot of kicky footers. Kicky photos. It's a, somebody is in a wheelchair, um, but they have the use of their legs and the way that they move the chair around as they kicked her big kick, kick, kick your foot, they push and then they back up. And sometimes they go forward with their feeds and you go, oh, you just feel like sitting. And they're like, yeah, yeah. It's kind of, it's not fair to the people that might really need the wheelchair. Sure. It has a ceiling. I remember there was a kicky foot lady, uh, down on sixth street there. She rolled hood. Yeah. And I saw a guy, the bearded lady wasn't at the bearded one. No, the bearded guy. There's a bearded man with paint his beard on. Yeah, I remember that guy. Yeah. But there was this one lady that I used to always see, but uh, downtown Vegas had a guy cookie fighting. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:16:24       Cause several, a whole team of KCI flutters. It felt like a whole, a whole situation. And you know, it's just, it's not my bag downtown Vegas. And so we, we stayed in, uh, uh, the, the, the morgue. That whole section seems like it's a, just a parole hearing gathering. So there's, are there court courthouses there? There should be. I mean, yeah, there are, but yeah, it just, Oh my God, the Greyhound station is right there. It is a great hand stitch the whole thing. Yeah. That's what it is. Yeah. But it was nice to kind of reminisce because the early stages of our careers, we did a lot of shows down there. Oh yeah. Yeah. We used to do four queens. I knew that.

Speaker 1:          00:17:06       Yeah. And I did the Golden Nugget and uh, you know, these Vegas Palace station, a station or liens. I did the sands before it was gone. I did the Riv before it was going on in Harrah's was arrows. That's where the Improv is. Yeah. The trop I did that. I just do all of them. And people will know when you do, you know, you do the road, you're, you're typically on most club. Weekends are Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and sometimes Sunday. Vegas you do Monday through Sunday, brewed all. So you arrive Monday and you do one show a night until Saturday. You two shows Saturday. And uh, I really thank God that I don't have the gambling gene. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:17:44       We don't have the fun gene. Let's back it up. You and I, out of all the agents, the managers,

Speaker 6:          00:17:50       the executives to other comedians on this thing are probably the most antisocial people. Yeah. Like we should be fun and we're the least fun. Yeah. I always get that. We have no fun

Speaker 1:          00:18:02       ruin the wonderful, one of the calls I got one time was a, Hey, do you want to do just one of these festivals? You know, I would been like, Moon Tower or oh, you're one of these festivals. And I go, well, what's the like, what's the deal? And they were like, well, it's not a great offer, but it's like a great hang. Now go, excuse me. And he's like, well, you know, like all your friends will be there. And I was like, I don't care what my friends are here in la. Yeah. And they're like, well yeah, to just be with them in another city and no. Yeah. You party. I go, I don't fucking party. And they're like, hey man, you don't want to do it again. No, I don't want to do it. I want to do like a regular shirt. I don't care if it's a festival was involved. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:18:41       Well cause we can go down to the comedy store and see those exact same people. Then my festivals on sunset, it's, it's easy. Yeah. I don't need to fly to on Thursday night festival or much Montreal. Yeah. To fly across the world. No, I know none of those things. They're like, you're going to hang a no, no. Go to bed by 10 yeah. And that's what we did after the taping. They were like, we're going to go out now. We're like, no, I'm exhausted. He is exhausted. It's crazy to say to you, I mean, you're fucking super price. People still are like, you want to go out? I'm like, no, I want him to lay down. You're going out, right? No, no. Yeah. You're going to leave your pregnant wife nor the phones. Hell Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          00:19:21       I had two crazy, crazy phone things into weeks in hotels in Vegas where we get back, we ordered too much food as usual. We wind down our fun. Yeah. That was our celebration. Ordering too much Chinese dumplings about whatever the fuck to go to bed. So we're like, all right. You know, congratulations. Big Win, you know, great special. Finally she goes to bed. I go, I'm going to go to bed too. I'm talking because I flew the day before back from Charlotte. Then the next day to Vegas, I'm tired. We laid down and was like on cue the phone, which is sitting on the nightstand have this nice hotel goes dial tone. The speakerphone goes on. So you're like, what's that? And you just kind of hit it off like, okay. That was weird. A minute later. Uh, so then I'm like, well, what's happened with this phone? I just tried to like fix it every 45 seconds or so. It keeps going on. Did I try to unplug it? It's like sealed. Yeah. Into the phone. Yeah. Then I called down, hey,

Speaker 6:          00:20:36       how did you call down though? I just called. I called guest services from another, from the other thing. Cause there were two phones. Yeah. How did you, I guess you picked the other line or something like that. I don't know. I was like, oh my God, I so tired too because I had fallen asleep. It wasn't right away, you know, both in a dead sleep. I got up to Paris, right, came back and then it started doing it. Then I start telling them, I'm like, here's what's happening with the phone. They're like, okay, we'll try to get some. I go, no, no, no, no. I was like, you have to send somebody now. I'm going crazy right now and as I'm doing that I hear like, I don't like, I hear shit like crashing, like what the fuck? And you had met, I mean I'm telling you at my full strength, like you know, I mean I didn't try to violently do it, but I was like, oh this is not like a regular plugin like this.

Speaker 6:          00:21:25       You know what I mean? Like it's not, it wasn't like a regular, not a regular phone line. It was like actually like, I don't know. Sealed in there somehow. Christina manage from the bed, seven and a half months pregnant. She just go Bam. And like the phone went flying off and I go, ah, yeah, just send them up. So then I take what you did, kind of piece it back together. And when the guy gets there and set up being like, fix it, I go, yeah, well I'm telling you, Hell hath no fury like a pregnant woman trying to get her two hours of sleep. And that whole ordeal, by the way, was that was like a 25 minute ordeal. Of course it kept going up and the rage inside of me, I was like, dude, I fucking, I am exhausted. I yanked it as hard as I have no idea what could make a fucking phone do that.

Speaker 6:          00:22:10       I don't know. Do, I mean literally it's dial tone would just come through the speaker like every minute. But I, at that point I didn't care. I was like, I'm going to pay for this phone. I'll give you $200 or whatever it is. I can't, I can't listen to this shit. But the best part is, um, as you call down for, for room service, remember? And what did you say? Oh I ordered and then she was like, cause I go, yeah, she goes, okay, we'll be up in like 30 minutes ago. Thanks. Gambling jeans. And she, I thought she had already hired when she goes like all her gambling jeans. Yeah. Well Cause I've been calling people mommy and jeans like just openly and rampantly. Zero pushback. No, and I mean I'm calling technology sometimes car just to be like, why'd you call me Mommy?

Speaker 6:          00:23:00       I'm like, I'm just calling your mommy. You know, I spent $40 by the way, on the slots. I was walking through the slots. He did just lots. Yeah. And I went up to 65 and I was like did when I went down there and then I took that money, I put it in another machine. We had lost it in like 5 cents. I'm, you know, I don't really understand the thrill of gambling. It's just not get it. But I don't have the like it's either excites you or it doesn't. It terrifies me because I know how, how hard it is to earn money. I feel like it's the eastern block or in me is like, no dude, I'm not doing this. My friend, my money down the toilet, Claudia is asking this question. I've got to tell her our nanny dose. So, um, somebody wanted to send you this.

Speaker 6:          00:23:53       Really check this out. They have a little clap back. Oh Shit. Here we go. It's not that bad. Here we go there. She said, how dare you. I don't want to read.

I know what I honestly of the only other thing I would say is don't go camping to fuck him. You know what I would say? Why? Why? Because we hate camping. Well, here's what I was going to say. That Mary, somebody where you guys, you people like always, what do you have in common then? No know it's what you both hate and common. That's really what's going to unite you as a couple is both the both of you hate the same stuff.

Speaker 6:          00:26:29       For instance, Tom and I, we don't go out late partying. That's really not our thing. We both hate camping. Yeah, we both hate concerts. Both like to stay at home. We hate loud environments. Hey crowds, crowds hate fucking cunt servers can't servers. Billy Joel, our mutual hatred. I don't hate Billy jolt. I don't know why you're putting it, don't you? I don't know why you put that on me. Bruce Springsteen. I don't like him. We both hate Dylan. Bob Dylan, he's garbage. Trash, trash. Frank Sinatra hate him. You're really more United by the shit you hate when you're a couple. It's true. Um, I think things like that too. You know, Matt Dillon, when he was like, he's a treasure. I know. You expect to get the music. It's funny because you really, people, some people treat them music. The music they love. Like it's family. Right. You know, especially if they've been listening for 15, 20, 30 years.

Speaker 6:          00:27:29       It's like, it's like saying, Hey, your dad's sucks basically. Yeah. You know? But yeah, you can't expect everyone. I'd like to see course. I think it's funny when someone really gets the sounds, they like to hear you having different sounds. You like to hear it. Yeah, my sounds are the best. And you're like, okay, good teams. I don't want to hear fucking, oh my God. The other one I love about sports is when, when people attack a professional as a, they suck. Like there'll be like Lebron James Sucks. And you're like, that's cool. Like he sucks. Like, yeah. Like he's okay. I mean, we're talking about, you know, objectively physical freaks of all, you can't, you can't accept that. Fuck him. He sucks. He's no good. Okay. Oh, you know what I would suggest for married people who are newly cohabitating or who have been living together for years by a cleaning lady, get a cleaning lady.

Speaker 6:          00:28:32       I think that alumni, a cleaning lady, have a slave in your pantry, but you said the word wrong, but get a cleaning lady. You got 40 bucks to spare. Have someone else clean your home. We did it when we were the brokest. I think it was once a month when you're like, all right, this is what it was like a little apartment and I think someone would do it for like 50 bucks. It's the best $50 we ever stab because when they are done you're like, oh yeah, I, I, I'll, I'll never keep it like this. Yeah. So I think about having a clean close, here's what it does. It a alleviates the fights between the two of you do too. Who Cleans what in the house, right. Preach, preach, preach. I don't yell at you about your boxer shorts on the floor or the song, you know, yell at me for my sloppiness because someone else fucking pigs. Plus there's gross shit that you don't want to do. Hey, you know, stains on toilets and on a sinks that are just, you know what I mean? Like just from being Greg toothpaste and shit builds and it's like, and then you have to fight over who does the toilets and who, and not only that, you work 40 hours a week. Most Americans work a full fucking weak. Why are you spending your weekends scrubbing

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       your toilet unless it's something you really enjoy and all a lot of people love to clean or you have to do. Yeah, but I'm saying if you have 40 by hammered how much ever it is in your region. Yeah. Save your money. I would rather that's really have the cleaning lady then go out for fucking dinner that month. Do you know what I'm saying? It's, it's way more.

Speaker 1:          00:30:00       Uh, I dunno. I think it's a huge life saver. Personally. I think just to spite you. Apparently the mommies have taken over the romance, the Rogan comment section are those videos yet. And it is like all rob rubs says like thick, hot, white come. My brother didn't believe me so hard. I'm hearing it. What's up with this one here? No. People are like, are these all bots that are responding to it? Try it out right now. Right now. Right now. Uh, Peyton Lafferty take 10 or 12 Benadryl. I don't think this is despite me is I'm just, no, I'm just kidding. Oh, whole man out. Whoa, man. This is hilarious. So it's very funny. You cannot fuck with the mommies. And there's another, you cannot, a lady who mentioned this said, uh, hey, mommy's first one to say the doctor drew podcasts are by far my favorites. Yes. His reactions are the best, by the way. I'm going to do his podcast.

Speaker 3:          00:30:55       Great. The which one Hashtag [inaudible] you live. He needs to change the title of that. I Dunno. He's like life Hashtag you live at Dr drew. Like I gotta talk to him about this.

Speaker 1:          00:31:06       Um, I'm not sure it was called I'm doing it Thursday. Uh, I wanted to write in about Dr Drew's saying there is always a man behind the woman. We get emails about this and that. It's not always the case. I actually submitted a try it out video on my own fruition the day after Tom put his on Instagram because I was so excited, but I'm not sure I sent it correctly. Uh, it was actually me trying to get my friends to do it with me, not the other way around. I actually find myself intentionally slipping in the words, try it out in conversation, know, so I can chuckle to myself. I love what you do. Your podcast giving me laughs even in the darkest moments, always keeping it high and tight. Sophia, Sophia,

Speaker 3:          00:31:42       point out that I pushed back on drew when he said that, and I said that not our listeners. I believe that the women that listen to this show are self starters, self initiators. When it came to funding and creating these wacky videos. Listen, if you're a girl and you're listening to this show, yeah, you're already, you're fucking thousand times cooler than most checks. Yeah. And your, your fucking head isn't on right.

Speaker 6:          00:33:38       My favorite line is still the neuropathy and uh, people are when hashtagging that shit on Twitter, like, yeah, no, no, no, no. They're also putting it also, by the way, it's really funny. I'll be like, ah, I'm going to be a Fort Myers November 1st at your tickets here and there. Like A, is there an entrance? Is there a special entrance? If I have neuropathy issues, Hashtag I couldn't believe how his dick was so crazy, so crazy. He jumped off, drove, he's so impressive now on your app. I mean, yeah. His focus in life is fucking on hold on. Before we move on. Yeah. From the marriage topic. Yeah. Uh, I want to let everybody know that we were laying in bed last night and I'm laying in my pregnancy pillow, so I can't really move a lot. So when I want affection from you, I have to demand it like a Brussels Griffon and come here gimme kisses.

Speaker 6:          00:34:33       Give me love and you fucking gave me the laziest air kiss. Yeah. I have ever seen watching. We were watching something and you're like, Hey, give me a kiss. Yeah. Instead what I did was I moved my lifts to the right side of my face because you're sitting to my right. I mean, yeah. Even turn your head to the side. Face, air kiss. I went, yeah, I like that. Because you are watching a TV show. I need to even want to turn your head to look at me to air kiss me. So you kept your eyes forward on TV and then you, you side kissed. Yeah, that's a lazy, you also snapped me out of it because I was actually zoned out and whatever we were watching. So as soon as you pointed out how bad that was, I did laugh. Preordained. Yeah. That was the Lazy Shit. Yeah, it was real lazy. Yeah. I was like, okay. There you go. No, no neuropathy. What is this? I don't know what the hell this is.

You're telling me the time they look exactly their age or worse like this fucking, it's seldom that somebody doesn't legit look their age. People who don't never say it. In other words, like the person who like really looks down and goes, you wouldn't believe how much younger I looked at it. They just, they are that, you know, it's like being like smart people don't go like, do you want to know how smart I am? Like they just don't do, they don't tell you this guy is 66 Bam. He looks terrible. Well yeah this is, I mean, I mean he's got the smoke detector in the back so that's good. The camera's facing down. Hold it down. No shirt. So he checks your mom's house requirements. Yes. For a shitty videos. If you had to white white, White Lady, give me hours. Anyone's going to respond to that. A real crazy person. Somebody who is equally as sick as he is. Nobody, you know that's fucking out of control. Did you see this thing that went viral? This a kid talking shit to this guy at a mark? Some shit.

Speaker 9:          00:39:54       Good. It's calming. No. Okay. Awesome.

Speaker 6:          00:40:10       This guy did it. Voice call cause he's just being like confronted by this

Speaker 9:          00:40:16       kid. Look at the kid though. He's fucking straight up on this really weird kid is like on them

Speaker 6:          00:40:36       started but it looks like the kid is um, he said don't talk about my mom or something. Hmm.

Speaker 9:          00:40:43       I like him for him. See he's putting these, he's touching the guy. That's what he thinks is right now. They're actually, yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:40:55       Leaning a grown man in a kid or leaning up against each other. How do you think that kid is 12 your ranch? When I got to know more about what happened here.

Speaker 9:          00:41:03       Is that something his mom

Speaker 6:          00:41:19       really funny video. Tom. Thanks. What part of this is funny for you? I didn't think it was funny. I was just showing you the video. I can't watch a little kid getting hurt blue cars.

Speaker 10:         00:41:34       He was, I called him. Nene starts to take to start testing. Man. You're could just keep, cause he just kept running around here. I said, you need to tell it's good to get out of here. God told him to go and he went down. Right. Where are you? Bike ran back up here and started pushing. Shown

Speaker 6:          00:42:02       who picked this one? Blue banner videos today are fucking crazy. What's happening. Um, I don't see anything wrong with what the guy did though. Pushing that kid down on the ground. Yeah. I don't know, Dude. Like he was swinging on him. The kidneys checked you, but you have to, you have to separate them. Another adult should have intervened and separated them. You don't push a little boy down to the claim. Is that little quick? He's 12 baby. Yeah. He needed to be checked. We don't push a kid on the concrete get crack. It's just fucking, the kickoff was was punching. Yeah. Yeah. But you're bigger than him. Aren't there rules to that? Yeah. Yeah. It's like, this is what happened is be like, this is what happens is that kid needs to know, see what happens is that kid is going to learn from this incident that if I go ahead and just punch someone when I'm angry, yes they could.

Speaker 6:          00:42:47       It could end poorly for me. Right. So you need to be able to, you know, assess the situation and either restrain yourself from punching when you want to. Certainly don't think that you can punish someone bigger than you and not have repercussions. Yeah. No, I get it. Look good. It is. I mean, he did the grab a machete to push them on car. I mean, first of all, it's a lawsuit waiting to happen. Yeah. Fucking push a little kid on the floor. But you're right. This is called, this is male thing where you guys have to learn how to size someone back. I defy okay. Like I did him a favor. I got to pee. I'm sorry I'm pregnant. I got to go. Don't fuck that. He should have fucked that kid. No, I said fuck that kid. Fuck that kid is right. Are You going to pee?

Speaker 6:          00:43:31       Yeah. All right, great. How was your p? Pretty magical. I'm so fucking hungry today, ma'am. All right. It's like I have a person inside of it is like that can't stop eating. I got this bullshit. Listen to uh, is bullshit. It was the one doctor drew was here. Oh listen. Or a praying lady. I take amazing dogs. I always tell him for me that you have to harass Burt before you eat yours. Dude, you have to what? You'd Harass Bert. Do you call me? Bert? That's what they're saying. Call me bird. Oh, let's hear it again. I don't need to have for me. Then you have to harass Burt before you eat yours your ass first. He said burst her ass her ass first for me. Then you have to harass Burt before you ask for. You have to eat her ass Berg. Oh, last first.

Speaker 6:          00:44:20       He said he knows you saying he's trying to say first and then said they can't. You just, yeah, you're asking you for enough to harass Burt before you eat her ass bird. Burb instead I asked burgers. We got to send it to him ma'am. Yeah, it's totally unacceptable. Totally on. It's all going to go do a show now. You gotta you gotta show him that clip there. That's it right there. Listen. Burb first, did you have to harass Burt before you through his first not bird bird burp. Burp. It's cute. Speaking of ass. I was getting a mom's size yesterday. Yeah. And I was holding in so many farts like the whole time, like every times when they give you a massage and they'll push down like from your mid back to your lower back towards like, they're like they're showing the fart where to go, like heres your digestive track.

Speaker 6:          00:45:18       Well I lay on my side for these, but I ate Mexican food. I had like so much food and I was the whole time I've relaxed, relaxed. Then I'd feel the FARC come back and then I'd have to clench, clench, clench plans and then it waits. It would wake me up and then it occurred to me, wouldn't it be great to find him a Zeus that actually encouraged your farts? That was like, Oh yeah, right now you got to let that far down. Breathe in and push hard. Like with the, like when the whisper, yeah, you have to Fart.

Speaker 6:          00:45:53       Go ahead and give me that. Yeah, you got to breathe in and you gotta push that far down and then they're like, that's right. I'm sure there is. There has to be somebody that's like the fart. I don't know if I would say, I'm sure there is. I don't think that that's necessarily correct. Pharmacists in La maybe. I mean if you put out a request, I'm sure someone who likes bars will be like, I could massage you, but I don't know if there's a FARC massage therapy. The prerequisite isn't that they have to like the fart but just that they don't make you clench your ass. Cause I feel like, I feel like it takes away from the relaxation experience. If I could just let it rip without embarrassment horse, how much better would your massage be? Yeah, if you could be. If you're like, oh here comes a fart and they're like, don't worry about it.

Speaker 6:          00:46:38       Yeah cause I, well you don't know if you have a, a real rancid one or if you have, oh mine are horrible right now because I feel like I'm close enough to the lady that we go to all the time. I was this close yesterday. It'd be like, listen, I got to rip one and you're cool with it. She'd probably be cold it to probably be cold and I didn't want to blast like you. Of course. Of course. What if we give pay somebody extra and be like, here's the extra money. If you just let me fight the whole time, they would definitely say yes, I dare you to do it next time we're at like a nice lake place. He wasn't. If I know what happened is I go, if I ship you a little more they're going to be like, no, no, no, no. Wait, let me finish my sentence. Do you mind tip you a little more? If I can fart the whole time my, they're expecting the hand job offer and you're like, I just got a far, I just want to, and then she's like, she'll probably go, people fart

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       all the time. I'm like, so do you mind,

Speaker 6:          00:47:34       cause I do feel like that's the one hindrance to me. Fully relaxing and enjoying. Yeah. If I could just take out that fart barrier.

Speaker 1:          00:47:42       If you have to far, far, I'd be like, no, no, no, but I need you to waft it to yourself.

Speaker 6:          00:47:45       No, I can. I like it. I like it. I don't need the encouragement.

Speaker 1:          00:47:50       What about this guy you think he would would let you fart?

Speaker 9:          00:47:53       Here's your massage. The baby. It's a baby chick coming aside and Nixon.

Speaker 6:          00:48:03       I can't take it. Do you think

Speaker 6:          00:48:31       Crazy heels on. Probably. Yeah. He really should show them if he's going to bother wearing. I know that's a quite a outfit. What is that? It's nothing Tom. Just yeah. My, my least favorite sexual genre. Yeah. Is the crossing of Christmas, the Lord of our birth. The birth of our Lord and Savior with sexual or sexualizing Santa's. Yeah. I never understood that. Okay. Yeah. I fucked sand our singing Santa Baby. That songs. Yeah, like that's the least. It's just, it's a child thing. It just so like how can we don't do what the Easter bunny like fucking eastern money. Yes. I'm sure I know. I just really, I really don't like the Santa here.

Speaker 1:          00:49:14       Is there one thing? I know you, I know it puts you in a good mood. We established this yesterday. Yeah, I know. It can make you laugh. Yeah. This is again, part of a, if you're wondering what makes somebody happy through a marriage, it's like, okay, knowing their sweet spots because one thing I know about you, you love music. You know you love scatting. I love scouting. How about group scatty? Okay,

Speaker 9:          00:49:59       Lina.

They're going to get, well, you get here taps cause all off rhythm. They're doing it lazy though. They're not even doing it. So you're doing it Chris. You're like, these kids are terrible at this. This is terrible.

Speaker 11:         00:50:45       [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:50:56       no, not the white girl.

Speaker 6:          00:51:02       Oh Jesus. Please let the black kid do it. I can't hear these fucking white girls doing this. Let's get to him

Speaker 6:          00:51:27       I think I might like scat cause that kid did it well let me listen to a little bit of soul

Speaker 11:         00:51:32       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:51:42       it's definitely better than the other people. But look at all the kids looking at him like, Whoa, wow, how can really do it? How it's done. This is embarrassing. He got into it. Don't you feel like, like this is something you totally could have fallen into and like elementary school, oh maybe elementary school. Like you can just make sounds with your mouth. You know what I mean? Like um, you know, like if you're like I'm in the choir group, I do music group at school and then like the music instructor is like, we're going to do this thing called scat and you're like young and you're like, yeah, what's that? Well it's like this jazz thing and then next thing you know there's a video of you doing this shit. I mean, it would not be, uh, at their age. No, no. You're telling me like I was six or something? Yeah. Yeah. I'd say up until sixth grade you could get sucked into doing stupid. No, no, no. You think 12 1212 I'd be out. He's this fucking game. I think I could've gotten roped in at 12 that would be the last year. They can make me do something. That's embarrassing.

Speaker 11:         00:52:46       1111 [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          00:52:55       Who's singing that was, that one was better. Who's that? Who's to his right and behind her we can't see who it is. Wow. That one was, that was my, that was actually the best one yet. That was the best one. Yeah. The first few were like

Speaker 9:          00:53:09       [inaudible] all together.

Speaker 11:         00:53:17       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:53:26       let's see. That was better because they rehearsed it. Right? This, this, you know, the scat stuff was in. It was terrible. What if our sons, like, I just love to Scat Dad, come listen to the scout record and act like I liked this nonsense.

Speaker 9:          00:53:45       Fucking hambone this asshole. Fuck.

Speaker 11:         00:53:54       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:54:05       see now the last time we played hambone we did a kind of an analysis, like who's less talented? That guy or the lung infection song guy, lung infection guy won by a landslide, he killed it. Now Pam bone versus scat. Who's, who's the lesser talent? Well, that's a good question. I mean, I think I hated a ham bone guy more. Yeah. But I think now that I've spent some time in the scat world, I definitely hate them. Well, here's the thing, the people in the scat community, they seem to be very earnest. Like there's a very earnest love of scat, but the ham bone guy, I still feel like he's, he knows that he's put one over on the audience. Like he's so smug with how he does it. And of course that's what contributes to why you hate him so much. I've worked this ham boning my whole life. Yeah. It's not as, um, yeah. The other ones just seem so innocent compared to him. True, true. What would you rather watch that group, scat video or handbook for an hour, an hour. You're buying a ticket, you're driving your parking of the two without question. I think I could at least get lost in the fact that he does movement. And I know, but they were terrible. Okay. Would you rather watch an Andrew Lloyd Weber musical or Hambone?

Speaker 9:          00:55:40       Hmm.

Speaker 6:          00:55:43       You got to end here thing the, the Andrew Lloyd Weber musical. It's ours. It's not just one hour. It's like two and a half, I'm guessing. Two and a half, three hours, right. Um, yeah. To watch a musical or you got to watch an hour. I about Pam. Whoa. I would take it now. I would take the Andrew Lloyd Webber. I don't want to see a three hour anything. I don't want to see three hours of like the best standup. I don't want to see a three hour movie, three hour. I knew that. I really hate going to something that long. It's too, it's too much. It's too much to too much, too much. Um, this, I

Speaker 1:          00:56:23       know also you'll enjoy this on the way out of the show here. We got to wrap up here soon. We got to go to that meeting soon. Yup. Yup.

Speaker 12:         00:56:33       This point, the information that we have is that there is a male subject who has dedicated his intoxication level spewing poop all over the house. What should I buy? Carry here? What's going on, Gary? She thinks I'm too drunk to grab home. Okay. And uh, I don't think I am, but, okay. Let me ask you this. Have you used the bathroom on yourself? Well, yes. Okay, cool. My main thing is this point, I just want to make sure you don't have any pcs on you anywhere. Oh, I cleaned myself up in the bathroom. Okay. So I'm done when I have gas. Right.
