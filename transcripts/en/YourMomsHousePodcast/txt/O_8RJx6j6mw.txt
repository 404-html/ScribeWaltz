Um, and then he, uh, you know, I just, I basically put this out there so that he could, uh, see it. And then maybe if you wanted to do that fight for, because I, you know, I um, you know, right.

Speaker 2:          00:08:58       Every day shadow he's got punches, man. I just wanted to give you a challenge video, you know, why don't you and I step in the brain and shit and you could show me some of your moves. We can sell tickets, we could donate them to charity.

He throws an uppercut, but then he does really unusual Skype hunches were like, he goes through, you know, so I figured if I am going to step in the ring with him, I have to kind of get my Skype punch game down at the end of this video. I just do, I train for um, weighted Skype punches. They're called scribe punches. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:09:49       That is right. Then inspire but crazy low CEC kettlebells, but not yet,

Because it's kind of the same movement. Yup. You know? Yeah. I know. I'm talking about, I'm filming what I'm saying. Um, I mean if you want to get a better idea of what I'm talking about, you can look at, um, these right here. These are what I would say are like his, probably what he's best known for. Um, oh right.

You know, you're not afraid, but I wouldn't say that, but I'm ready to, you know, see where this takes me. Yeah. Um, I was brought, it was brought to my attention that there are some other crazy load things we could, we should check out. Okay. Um, one of course is his rap rapping prowess. Um, okay. This is a, this is a crazy load. This one here. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:11:33       oh, you really are in love with crazy looks right now. It's really normal. What's the fascination with him so much? Why do, why down the crazy looks rabbit hole? I don't know, man. I mean, he just is interesting to me, you know. What about his style appeals to you the most?

Speaker 6:          00:11:52       Um, probably

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       okay.

Speaker 6:          00:11:56       Just that he doesn't give a fuck. I kind of really, I was like that about people when they're like, I don't give a fuck man. He's really himself. Um, and I like, you know, I like fighters. Here's a

Speaker 8:          00:12:30       bitch. You better quit right now. Take care of it.

Speaker 3:          00:12:44       Shit like that. Right? What are you sure you want to be this guy? I don't know it. That's why I'm starting to train harder. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:12:54       I don't know if I'm, I have experienced,

Speaker 3:          00:12:58       I'm not sure. You want to, oh wait, look at the header on that. Which one? Crazy little scroll up. I want to see up. Uh, higher up. Look at that crazy face.

Speaker 6:          00:13:21       Well, this is like a lot of the fighting stuff, but for a long time, uh, it was about rapping. You know?

Speaker 9:          00:13:33       He was really right here. Shot Jimmy here. How here it will be. This is not new. It's awesome. She me to say it straight up though. Shovels out all the homies.

Speaker 3:          00:14:03       Yeah. Oh yeah. You know? Yeah. There's different levels. There's so much happening with crazy lugs. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, you know, there's like people who are like, I'm a writer, director, producer, act like he's that guy. He's that guy that can wear so many hats. Yeah, he does. He's so talented. Yeah. You can't contain that kind of talent, homie.

And those gaming APP pretty play. No playing. What I Gus

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       to say Chris Lowe, sal about GIM paid all about his dog for Shell. Some of the yard did nub with our rep to be a yeah, it's not that good. So, um, he only moves his mouth too. Everything else is perfectly still. Have you noticed that? Yeah, no blinking. Just Kinda, well I gotta say I was getting really into preparing for the fight and you know, I was watching a lot of his boxing video budding. Yes. That didn't seem like, what does my opponent, you know, doing cause then that video that I put out, obviously I'm challenging him. Yeah. Turns out crazy loans might not even be well. Yeah. What do you mean? Well wait a minute. Not Well, how like he has a cold or something worse.

Speaker 6:          00:15:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:42       Brain not well, what a shocker. You're kidding. Well, I mean, here's a, um, that's a weird, here's an email we got from a listener who also teaches a w people with special needs. Um, he says, hi Hitler. Mommies. Yeah. Work with special needs kids. I'm on spring break, so I had some extra time on my hands and I think I can fill in the blanks a bit on crazy lows that watch youtube videos such as this wonderful wrap classic cop car.

Speaker 6:          00:16:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:20       Um, that's the one we just saw it. Right. I know he was robbing next to a cop cart.

Speaker 8:          00:16:40       It's all syndicate. He never did this. Never always pay me. Sure.

Speaker 1:          00:16:51       Okay. We get the idea. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Anyways, so he says, judging from his somewhat slurred, repetitive speech and wide set eyes. I wanted to at first say fetal alcohol syndrome, but I think that crazy lokes yeah. More than likely is on the autism spectrum and probably to the more severe end of it at that. Yeah. His occasional speech disfluency and intense non blinking eye patterns make me think this seriously. He doesn't blink, surefire sign right there. He also has some delusions of grandeur and a general detachment from reality, which are also signs. He's a bit touched, as you'd say. Also watching him spar and his movements and his rap video lead me to believe he has some form of Dyspraxia, dyspraxia. How do you say that? I'm not a medical professional time. Another symptom of the spectrum which can manifest itself with difficulties,

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       understanding movement patterns, punches directly outputs, ports in this case or things like handwriting in school, issues with motor skills, shuffling feet. Well, spire, sparring, poor balance, miss time movements, general flailing about. This is just one man's opinion, which is legit to say. Yeah. Any way you slice it. This dude is pretty fucked up of the show. Keep those genes way up high and tight

Speaker 6:          00:18:15       by Hitler. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:18:18       s I'd rather be retarded. It's not so bad. Retarded people can be happy and have good lives. You know, I take that over GRANDPA's Dick in my mouth today. Even with the funnel cake. Yeah, but your GRANDPA's not, he's not his Dick's. Not In your mouth. In that scenario. He just jacking you off. Oh right. Yeah, that's true. That is a little less severe than second way less severe. Lowing your grandfather versus just getting like a nice hand job from him. Plus his hands are kind of old and softer to try to do it unless he did a lot of manual labor and then his hands would be really hard and it could be calloused and cross the hands. But still it's soon as your grants granddad's hands like they were nice. So you, we get a nice softy. Hmm. Yeah. He never had final down ever. I Dunno. Never brought it up. Never brought it up. So this is kind of depressing. Yeah. It's another funny, funny background story to a clip that you presented. Thank you. Well, I'm saying, oh glad I know this. The depression for me now is that I don't think I can fight him. No, but you maybe you can rap battle him

Speaker 6:          00:19:33       that

Speaker 3:          00:19:34       it's really good idea, right? Yeah. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. All people out there doing like, well no, not if he's severely mentally affected. It doesn't, it doesn't mean that it can't be a good rapper. You don't think so. No. It's just, it just affects his stop. Remember that kid? The Hay did the rap battle and he was like, you're like, um, Rosie O'Donnell. Adda bisexual baby shower. That guy, he actually was really good at rapping. Right? It doesn't mean the clown. I'm going everything. Yeah. But he was really good. So, yeah. We don't know. Crazy looks. Could surprise you. True. He could. You know what's happened to some creative at place that you don't know about because of his autism. What do you want to bet on it?

Speaker 6:          00:20:20       It's like a back rub. My back rub.

Speaker 3:          00:20:25       You think it will be good? [inaudible] crazy legs. You don't know. Uh, speaking of rap battles. Yeah. Sorry. We got sidetracked. You sidetrack the hell out of me. This guy, you know, I thought you have to do, don't you put grills on when your teeth are kind of bad? This guy's got great teeth. He doesn't need to have bad teeth. Covered a bad teeth or something like that. Insurance through like gold ventures. He's about that life right now. Oh, okay. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:20:53       He did booty booty in the west. I eat that booty in the hood. I eat that booty booty. If a to smell. I don't give a mother fucking hell. I eat that booty. He'll definitely eat that booty anywhere.

Speaker 3:          00:21:08       I like it. It's good, right? Yeah. He's actually really, it's kind of Nice. It's charming. He's got, um, got good stage presence. I let him be my buddy. Really? Yeah. Why not? Okay. I didn't think you were like that. I'm really not, but I like his enthusiasm and I might let him just because of it. Jesus. Well, this was submitted by David Camp. Thank you, David from Twitter. You know what? I'm looking at this Bristol stool chart today and I think I had a type two sausage shaped but lumpy. It was a little lumpy. What was yours are harder. You know, they're harder. Oh, I was definitely like a five or six because they're a travel. Yeah. I mean this is, this has been a bad 24. I know, I know. I've been living with you. You came home and you started farting. It was just horrendous.

Speaker 3:          00:22:01       And then he farted in the bedroom. I couldn't go in there. It was just bad. It was really bad. What do you think did that to you? I Dunno man. Just living, you know, um, probably wasn't the best final day of eating the org evening, you know, all that say, see that. But I asked her yesterday and you're like, I just had had some chicken breasts on the plane and uh, he didn't mention bad eating at the club the night before the truth comes out because you said, what did you eat today? I didn't. Okay, well Brown lock is on the case, so let's go back in time and see what caused the nice look

Speaker 6:          00:22:38       or I left Seattle Tacoma, uh, which by the way, many, many thanks to everybody that came there. Always a good time. I had a girl came there, they all came all over me and I had a great time. They bring in their ges. Um, anyways, it was a great shows the last night, Saturday night I um, between the second, the first and second show, I did have some chicken fingers.

Speaker 3:          00:23:10       [inaudible] what kind of dipping sauces they gave you? Three for me, I think the dipping sauces as it's what pushes like the, all the mixtures of those strong, tall though they do a different style chicken breasts. There are two, one clinic to comb the comedy club. They don't do

Speaker 6:          00:23:28       the prepackaged frozen chicken finger. You're used to, they take actual like chicken breasts and so you get like a massive breasts and they, they flower it up and so it's not as crazy. Yeah. So I had that and then I had,

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       um, probably around one 30 in the morning, half of a, an Italian sandwich. Um, and then, and how many different kinds of Salamis and there's more, no, no, that was it for Saturday night. The next morning I woke up and I was like, I think I could, I needed to take a shit, but I, I'm not quite though. You can feel like, oh, this feels bad inside of me. And then I was running late. So what I did was I just carried that to the airport and then I didn't even have time to ship before the flight. So I shit on the plane first. Oh No. Horrific. Now Walk me through now you were in first class. Obviously I'm not a diamond medallion and were there a lot with our line of people waiting cause I'm those short flight, sometimes people stand in line and it's horrible. Um, did you feel the pressure is what I'm saying?

Speaker 1:          00:24:43       Just take that shit of hurrying through the shit, which is why I don't show. I saw this, this lady go up in there and she was in there while fucking bench. She was a big bitch too. Like I knew she was taking a fucking mean growler. But yeah, by the time she was done I finally got in there, um, and it was like, I'm so big for that size bathroom. My shoulders touch the wall and like, and the sink, I can barely move around in there. I went to wife and I got shit on my thumb. So upsetting. It's so upsetting. And I'm the worst. I tried to clean it. Was it like diarrhea? Yeah, just pool. So I'm like, fuck some, you're sitting there and washing it in the sink. And then when I pick up my wife and I do it again, so I'm like, God damn it, I can grow.

Speaker 1:          00:25:35       So I'm like cleaning my hand anyways. Then I spend like 10 minutes washing my hands after that I go back. But I just don't feel, I don't feel sick, but I just don't feel great, you know? And also you didn't have your big day and it's an every day. So hard to shit now without, oh, I forgot to mention, I probably had a couple of drinks too. Like hard alcohol or beer. Hard alcohol. Yeah, I'll do it. Yeah. Because I'm going to drink a ton. Yeah, that'll slap up your shit real quick. Yeah. And then, and then so I get off the flight and I get a coffee. Oh. And then I, I fucking crazy lugs. What are you doing? Uh, you can't do that. No. So then I get back here and it's just fart. Cities are ready to come. I know I smelled them all. And then I made you eat pizza. We ordered a pizza. Yeah. And you that was, and I was like, son just got home and you're like, let's eat pizza cause I don't want to cook. And it was Sunday and he treats you well then the far, the far, it's just came out even more. And then how he showed up this morning like five times already twice today. God. So, but the, here's what I've had today

Speaker 6:          00:26:44       though, Kinda of flipped up the game a little bit. I had some Greek yogurt just start today. Yeah. Um, some coffee and then you made a delicious healthy egg scramble with mushrooms and tomatoes and a piece of, was it a plum? Yeah. It's delicious. Yeah. So, so far today doing good. Never not shitting. Never know. That's your Twitter handle. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:27:11       You're always shitting. That's not true. Every time I talked to you, we're having a nice moment. We're cuddling with the kid or the dog, like we're having a nice family moment and you're always like, I gotta Shit. I gotta I gotta go, I gotta take a shit. People Shit.

I can't stop thinking about it. Yeah. I don't think it'd be safe to fight him. Well, like I said, I mean maybe a rap battle instead.

Speaker 7:          00:27:54       All right.

Speaker 6:          00:27:57       Maybe. Maybe it might be, it might be too intense. He got really mad at that guy in that video. He got really mad. Yeah. That's somebody that's not stable, Tom. And that's the guy that knows him, you know? Yeah. Okay. Um, speaking of poop.

Speaker 7:          00:28:15       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:28:19       Look who it is. Yeah. Look who it is

Speaker 3:          00:28:23       alive and well in Argentina. Answering blogs,

Speaker 6:          00:28:26       answering Vlogs, like ending the rumors.

Speaker 3:          00:28:32       Now did he invent that mustache or was that a mustache? No, at the time it was a fight for them. No, I think my grandfather had a mustache. Like I read it

Speaker 6:          00:28:40       about the mustache. You did. Why it and why he initially went to it. Because in a, when he was in the army, um, I guess leading up through World War One a, they had to have gas masks and he had a bushy mustache and it wouldn't allow the mask to seal so trimmed it. Gotcha. A lot of guys done did it. Oh, okay. Yeah. All right. And then you, now you've got this really cool mustache. Yeah. It's fashion forward. Yeah. So, um, you know, yeah. Don't, don't be, don't be quick to judge this guy down.

Speaker 3:          00:29:15       Hey Hillary. So turns out, look, look jeans. I know, I see.

Speaker 6:          00:29:21       Our man was in the pool.

Speaker 3:          00:29:25       That's what they say. Uh, turns

Speaker 6:          00:29:28       out there's these stories coming out that he had a micro penis, which I don't know how I discovered this, but on top of that, he was a fan of hoop and women or women to stand over him while

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       he was lying on the floor and have them defecate on him. He believed that. You know what though, I've also read things where a lot of, they always want to do this with a unpopular figures in history is make them insane. It's like, it's like it stops, it comes out. It's not necessarily true is when I was saying to demonize further demonize the shitty person, you know, you can say anything about Heller. Nobody's gonna be like, wait a minute, I know the guy and he's not into that stuff. You know? It's like I would just a way to go. Can we take it easy guys? You're being too rough on me. Can I just keep hearing all these mean things said about this guy? Um, so you know, and this is the same document where they describe his micro penis. I don't know. I said this, the practice of this perversion represents the lowest depth of degradation.

Speaker 3:          00:30:36       I guess. You really, you really are. The piggy is peg of all. I think so. I think Scott stuff is the weirdest in my opinion. You know, it does do anything. I don't think it needs to be just, I don't think you need to qualify it in my opinion. You're the foulest motherfucker. Shit, it's wrong. It's taboo. Yeah. So right here you can actually picture her dumping on him. Ava Bond. Yeah. I don't know. I don't, I don't think so. I don't think he was in all of that. I think he was into killing Jews and that's it. That's it. I don't know. I believe that he was upset with him. I do, I believe.

Speaker 3:          00:31:18       What do you think? He's into me kind of. Hey, not poop. Like I really sweats himself. Oof. Maddie mcconaughey loves himself son. Matthew mcconaughey. Yeah. But he, he definitely, he sweats himself pretty hard. He masturbates to himself a lot. I think so, yeah. In the Lincoln and the Lincoln. I just like these cars. I've been, I've been into these Lincolns since before they paid me too. I was jerking off in my Lincoln. He is so fucking into math and Kona. Hey. Yeah, I know. And, and Lincoln's. No, and I'd say, I do believe that he loves his Lincoln. Um, yeah. Yeah. So would you do what I was going, well, I did some shows. I went, uh, I did the ice house. I did the comedy store. I did full pairs, had lunch with Sarah Burns who's been on the show. We had Mexican food. That was pretty interesting. Yeah. And hung out with the kid. Man. You know, he's, he's a full time Gig. Three month old. Oh, our kid, that one. Oh yeah. Yeah. He's Super Rad. My Dad came over with my uncle Steve and that was fun. What was your, what'd your dad say? Nice House. This is nice. You know, you know, they don't really, my family's not very effusive. Nice. This is good. As it's going to get them. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       Yeah. But he's really into ls boy. My Dad. Really no good. This kid, this kid wants to move. This kid is going to be walking soon. Kind of curious to see your dad like that. It's so rare. He never is that adoring ever. He wasn't like, he's not like one of these guy got Google guys. No, but it's cool to see. I think when your dad's become grandparents, they tend to chill. Yeah. I, they become a little bit softer, which is cool to see. You should get softer, you know, as you get older. Yeah. Nothing more terrifying than somebody that, that doesn't get softer now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And he is happening to him. Yeah. It's nice to see. Yeah, it's really cute. He's really in, in our, our son. Yeah. It's nice. Yeah. This is the good kid. Good kid. Some boy. Nice. Everybody on my family thinks that the kid looks like you and everybody in your family think the kid looks like me. No. Weird. Yeah. I don't know why that is. Um, by the way, uh, uh, do you remember of course, this clip from a, uh, a while back in the show?

Speaker 7:          00:33:46       A shock you on Chinese?

Speaker 1:          00:33:48       Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, that was really loud. I don't know why that's so loud.

Speaker 7:          00:33:52       I shock you. Like Chinese. Me. Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:33:55       and if you don't remember, we did a whole episode on this guy. Turns out he was kind of a crazy person and he was known for, I'm going to restaurants and I think this is Melbourne, Australia, and eating elaborate meals and then being like, I don't have any money, like my drug that I like to do.

Speaker 6:          00:34:16       He would get arrested. So this was, you know, a clear from that we were sent a video, a remix of his arrest to music. No, that's always fun. Yeah. I think it's actually, oh yeah, it's back there. Here it is here. Um, so this guy, yeah, it was [inaudible]. This was like one of the best clips ever on the show. And somebody made a song. Hi. So remix song.

Speaker 1:          00:35:35       Does this guy, do you remember it actually of Hungarian

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       descent? Of course it does. Of course. Crazy. And it was a chess master. Oh, okay. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. The Hungarians are great at chess and polo water polo and acting crazy and crazy shit. Yeah. We don't give a fuck. Yeah. And then he told them here he was telling the news cameras. I had to suck your led Chinese man. Get y'all hand off my penis. It was submitted by Tony Mcfadden fall. It's on his youtube channel.

Speaker 7:          00:36:07       Well, Mondo Judo, Chinese Kudo, Josh Bullock. Kudos. Kudos. Fantastic.

Speaker 3:          00:36:29       That's really good song actually. Good job, dude. That's how my dad said. I showed him the bid day. He's like, oh good. I'm going to come over here to shit now. Oh, he did? Yeah. Because he lives closer now. He's like, well, I'm pulling me minutes away. I can save my shed for your house and like, thank you. Yeah. It's so funny is how cold my family is compared to like how we are with our kid. I was watching my uncle and my dad yesterday just sitting on our couch. Just ice cold gangster. His Hungarian style. Eastern bloc. Fucking hardcore. Yeah. Dude. Like my, our son's never gonna know that sweethearts. No. Yeah, the killer. Nice. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. Good place called. That's it. Yeah. Such gangsters. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:37:13       Remember when you met my ex mom? She's Hungarian too. You were like Ice Queen. Yeah, but that's not, she's not like, that's how they all, that's pretty Hungarian. That's just standard dude. Because if you smile, they see it as a sign of weakness. Like eastern blockers. If you're like, hi, I'm Christina. And they're like, this girl is a fucking retarded. They think you're retarded and weak. That's so sad. Horrible. Yeah. Well, if you look at Putin, like if you watch how it's this. Yeah. The Russians similar. Yeah. They think you're just a week pussy. If you show any kind of vulnerable valuation for your stupid yeah, like whenever we go to restaurants and a waitress would be kind like high faux can I, what is faux fuck you don't call me Fox. Like they're just so upset and like they get super mad and like did you um, leave any room for dessert or like when they ask you that question like, oh, like there's so offended by it. So funny. I guess in Hungary they will ask you that. Yeah. I mean it's just all about how you're raised. Right. So I mean really your reaction to things is it's based on your own environment and culture. Yeah. That's a pretty hard culture. Hard. I didn't realize it until I had been with you for the last 11 years. I was a baby. Yeah, he's cute. Good looking baby. This is a good look to move. And your uncle

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       okay. Cut. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:38:38       he's a little softer because he travels and he's like kind of more hippy leaning a little.

Speaker 1:          00:38:43       Yeah. I think, you know, he's a little, he goes to India and he went to go on like yeah, you know. But no,

Speaker 3:          00:38:51       my dad's all about the neon track suits and those who are so funny together. Ice Cold. I like seeing your, your dad and your uncle together. Such a trap man. Especially hanging out with your family where you guys are a little more normal and Americanized. Like I didn't realize how cold my family was.

Speaker 1:          00:39:09       Just like ice. We would probably be colder. We're probably a little warmer because of my mom's side of the family cause they're really, that's the other end of the spectrum. And now for sure Latins in the best. Yeah. They're always like hug and kiss. I love it up at all. I know.

Speaker 3:          00:39:28       Yeah. All that stuff. Like that's cute. Latin soul into lobbying everything. He's four

Speaker 1:          00:39:41       so love culture, man. It's, you know, it's tied into, I think it's some of the root is in how much they adore their mothers. That's that Virgin Mary Catholic maternal a society. It's very virgin Mary. That's absolutely true. Yeah, for sure. So it's always, you know, the virgin money. And then there's just very affectionate. It's a very affectionate, you know, you greet people with kisses.

Speaker 3:          00:40:07       Oh yeah. Hungarians do too. So by that theory we should be sweeter, but we're not, you know, she kisses and all that. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:16       Yeah. I don't know if men, I don't think men do that to men though. It's considered kind of gay. Right. Do an origin. Tina. Thank you, Amanda to men, which is really weird to me and aren't, were Hitler lives like Hillary will do it when he says hi to you, like if you see Hitler and you say hi, he'll give you a kiss on the cheek. But, um, I didn't experience it anywhere else with men, just Argentina. I'm never, never improved. Never. And um, definitely never in Spain it was always just the women.

Speaker 3:          00:40:47       I just had this vision of like, when you go to Peru and they grab your Dick, is that what they do? Yeah. That's the common thing. Like if you're a painter, yeah. They go, hello. And they all law and grab your deck. Yeah. And then if they know you, they'll blow you. That's what I heard. And Yeah. You know what's neat about my country of origin is hungry is like the porno capital. It is the world. I don't know. I married a Hungarian woman. My favorite, my best friend in the whole would have been married to him. Think about it. He married a, been married. He married a Hungarian. I'm not living in Hungary though, but I'm saying like, let's say your parents hadn't left Hungary and you were born there. You could be married to Rocco. Right. Okay. Yeah. That's okay. That's a possibility.

Speaker 3:          00:41:30       You know, I heard the porno industry happened there. It's because the Russian mafia, once a communism ended, the Russians came in and just started doing all that business there. They took over. He's so legendary. The Rocco. Yeah, I know. Well, he's out of retirement now. He's back in the game. Right. I thought I heard that. No, just behind the scenes. He's done. He left his mark. Yeah. Can I tell you a funny story about Red Ban? Red Band? Yeah. It just reminded me, um, I was at the comedy store there at night and apparently Jerry Seinfeld stopped in to do a spot and he did like a Q and a session. It was pretty crazy. First of all. So people know that Seinfeld was a normally drop in and in that way, no. You know it's not a common everyone else does but not, and I had heard also just to make, to make the point of how big of a deal this was.

Speaker 3:          00:42:17       He hasn't been to the store since like 79. That's what they were saying. So not a lot of that. Yeah there's a lot of drama between the Improv and the comedy store back in that era about being a paid regular at one club wouldn't let you do the other. And then what happened to the comedy store? Some crazy booker was holding the reins to that place and like wouldn't let major acts do drop ins cause they weren't quote passed by Mitzi who's the owner of the comedy store. So like you'd have like Sarah Silverman wanting to come and do drop ins at the comedy store 10 years ago and this book or we'll be like, no you can't. And so that guy, you know, he, he's gone now and the doors have open so now it's like become a better place. But anyways, so Seinfeld was there, which was a huge deal. Huge deal. And he's doing like this Q and a with the comics afterwards in the audience I guess. And our friend Brian Red Ban raised his hand and goes, I have a question. Do you wipe standing up or sitting down?

Speaker 3:          00:43:16       Hilarious. I think it's so funny. I apparently not in a lot of people. Agreed. Yeah. And people can see, I think he walked Seinfeld then he was like cyber, all the answered it and it was like, all right, I gotta go. That was the last good job. Good job. It was really, I thought it was really funny. I would have been like a, I have a question. Do you jerk off to your portion in them are just looking at them? Yeah. Seriously. How much money does that guy have? Um, I mean, he has, I don't know. There's, there's different, you know, uh, accounts, but I think he's probably in the high nine figures for sure. And Jay Leno. Yeah. Supercars too. He loves his cars. I haven't touched any of way tonight. Show money. It's been my standard line. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, they love cars, man. Yeah. So just, uh, he just sold some cars this weekend, so I felt it was needed. He auctioned off some of his, uh, Porsche's. Aww. Good for him for a lot of money. Wow. Yeah, he has like, he needs the collector.

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       Well, he said he was, he wanted to put them back into circulation. He goes, I've enjoyed them. It's time that I respect that too. It seems like a nice dude. I don't think there's anything wrong with that guy. No, I don't either. And I think, I believe that he's probably like, I've had these a while, he's probably just put it back out there. So all of them. But I love that Bryan asked that question. Sorry. Do you wipe sitting down or standing up? And he answered it right and he answered it, I think like, all right, that's enough assholes. Did they? They walked him, which is Brian. People are mad. People weren't happy about that. Other comics were upset with Brian. That's really funny. I liked it. I liked it a lot. That's hilarious. You know you were watching that documentary on twins. It was twins that didn't know that they had a twin sister. It's called twin stars. And then Lex, this um, came in here, let's see who, who sent this twins were swimming by a whole bunch of people. Okay. It's kind of just weird. These, these are two identical twins, but the kind that barely ever leave each other's side. It's so gray gardens. Yeah. It's really, really, it's kind of just odd to watch their act and speed. This kind of shit.

Speaker 10:         00:45:58       Yeah. 32 and they've hardly ever been apart. It's just one time when they were 17, one of the swearing hospital getting now appendix out. But Bridget used to come every visiting hours when I could, but if I was allowed to sleep there, I would have, they talk funny.

Speaker 1:          00:46:21       Yeah. Can accent is that master of accent is all the heirs are, oh, Jay could by news Aylien oh yeah. It could be. Don't know. It's hard to tell the Kiwi and the Aussie. Um, well no, I can, you can. Sorry. Master of accents. There are so creepy. A retard. Maybe not retard able to, yeah, I mean, Crepe is, that's, you know, this is more than I can Sklar brothers handle, you know? I mean there really are not just, they're not just finishing each other's sentences, they're just talking over it and it's the same. Yeah. It's pretty amazing. Yeah. I liked, I liked watching them bicycle tandem. Do you think they rub 'em out together the same day, but that's so rude. Yes. I think they do, but it's an impossible date. One of these girls, you can't, no way they're going to, they're going to be tethered to each other until they're on our deathbeds. These two, they're going to ruin their own lives. They would do, if one of them did meet somebody and talk to him, she would say, well, you have to have a friend. Oh yeah. You know, these two are going to be old

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       and together. It's adorable. It is

Speaker 10:         00:47:33       children. They resisted efforts to price them apart apparently when we were little, mom did separators as one rent. Little total is one state at an [inaudible] and we just just stopped swearing and that's when we were little by ladies in of screaming. And then when they put us back with ticket, we are happy.

Speaker 3:          00:47:57       Wow. That's so cool. By creepiest shit. Crazy. They're like, what is that movie Jack Nicholson in the shining. The shining twins girls. Little creepy. Yeah. Well that's so crazy. I know. I like that. This lady looks like you. I like your haircut. I'm going to get that. I love the front swirl. That's the mom cut for sure. Has Your expression, and you guys have the same now my favorite, just the back hair here is really nice and I think my father has his haircut. Well to me it just says lady, this is Eastern European tennis player. This is Ethan Lendl. Right. Then Lendl have this just to your hair differently. Right. And whenever I see that, I'm like, you're just doing this to yourself. Well, she's fully resigned to mom hood. You can see here she's wearing the Hoodie, but she's still tying it. It's weird. It doesn't want anyone to know sex. This is a look that says, do not come near me with a penis. Ever. Ever, ever. You know, I figured out why mom's dress frumpy, mom fashion. Especially if you're a breastfeeding, it's because you have to access your boobs all the time and there's not no cute stuff, but she's given up for sure. She doesn't need her boobs to come out anymore. No, no, no, no, no. This is, she's almost the dude at this point. It's really close. She might be transitioning. You don't know because I haven't played the game on my [inaudible] took place.

Speaker 3:          00:49:33       Well, I'm happy to put your mind. Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ. It's really, it's really bad. And here's the thing, okay. Okay. You don't have to be a supermom as saying that. And I'm not shitting on her for like, I'm shitting. Here's what I'm shitting on. Just try all it is. Work with what God gave you. You know, just try a little man. If you want to be a woman, if you want to be heterosexual, I don't know if she, why don't you tell everybody about your dream? I dreamt that some other guy busted nuts in me and I didn't know who it was and then I got pregnant again and I was like, oh, I have to tell Tom and I'm pregnant again. It's a dream vein. Well, let's see what she, what she has to say. What does this nice man

Speaker 10:         00:50:19       at school, they teach us, couldn't believe it was school. We're sitting at the same table and they accused you of cheating because I thought we were all looking at one another and sailing. Now he's questions. No, we rub the die and cheap. So they split us up and they gave, is it different for not, not be exactly the same questions, what we hadn't before and where we came out with the same answers and questions and, and I would just shop together and I said, sorry.

Speaker 1:          00:51:01       Oh my God, it's so weird. So weird. They didn't really let that guy talk at the beginning of [inaudible]. Gentleman was going to say something again. How do you think his tennis game is? This guy doesn't even speak. Holy Shit. Some parts of the Midwest. This is the norm. Where do you think this chick? A Guy, what do you think it is? Nice human gets their haircut and what did they say when they walk in? Do you know what to do? Waiting. They say it's gimme the tennis player. Give me the tennis player. Yeah. Gimme a ATP top five 1989 rock it out. That is an egg in 89 90 haircut. Of course, Jesus. It's all as a Midwesterner. There's a lot of ladies in the Midwest. Oh yeah. Here we go. Sam Kennison lookalike women. Oh No, the last, Jesus Christ. I don't know. Again, I'm not knocking her, but all of a sudden this still, this still is more a feminine, you know it's also a little lady di circuit nuts.

Speaker 1:          00:52:15       He know what it is. I think she was going for Lady Diana at 1980 and you know it looks dated. It's a little dated. Is it? No, it's very dated. What I'm saying is though, as far as the stills go, this one is more dude, and this one is before she transitioned. This is a woman because here's, here's what would fix this. I'm just saying grow the hair out just a little more. Yeah. I need to cut my ears out so that I can hear. Well, when you see my hair fall over, my ears cut them out so that could hear stuff that is so much.

Speaker 1:          00:52:53       Otherwise I don't hear anything. That's what it is. Because being a woman, there's not a lot of utility in our clothing and there was no utility in our hair. There's no utility and wearing makeup. Right. So when a woman gives up, she's going all function over form function for sure. Fuck you. Fuck. There's hear nothing. Yeah. It's all function at her, at her appointment. I guess a terrible haircut. It's actually the only thing really. She needs to it to try with it. Just get a fucking haircut. The haircut, it's bad. It's really bad. But then, okay, she's Ozzy

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       and you can afford it. You got a nice microwave. Yeah, we're have a friend that can do it for you. Yeah. Just grow it out a little, but a lot. Ozzie women, I hate to say this too, I've seen a lot of stuff they, yeah, yeah. They got this haircut, the outback steakhouse and half back. We don't need long. Huh? This is not an Ozzy cut though. Yeah. You just said it's a Midwestern guy. It's a Midwest then it's Australia because there's a lot of parts of their remote in Australia, like the Midwest, so basically and uh, in remote locations, Indiana and Illinois and Australia. Path path. Yeah. I Ayers rock hits where you're going to see it as kind of, uh, I think crocodile dundees hair was like this still hasn't it done? Dundee had a nice custom feathers. Yeah. It says the feathery look.

Speaker 3:          00:54:20       Yeah. This is the ultimate, I don't want to touch a dig ever. Let's see if she's anything between stream of married life together. Well, my plan is probably just next door to one another and have the exactly same identical house. Even now furniture probably being the same spots or by a creation. Helpful to have a real huge be combing or live together. Aw, wonder, would it be like to double team them? Yeah. He should ask. Well, I mean, I can't ask him. We can just talk about it. Like I wonder if they do the same, but I want you to ask them that question and just see. I'd love to, but I wonder if like, if, if like she starts eating your booty and then she's like, she knows what to do or does she wait her turn, you know, like, no, they think it's simultaneous. So you think she tries to do at the same time or no, it was like, I got to get on the balls and cock right now. Oh my God. I don't know Tom. It's a really interesting question now I really thought provoking me. Fund the Double Dip. Let's do it on nasty, Bro. Let's talk about it to move from one to the other. Boop, boop. And they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah. And, and in unison. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right in there. Right in that right. And that right there, right? Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:55:43       Okay. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:55:45       yeah, they're cute. They're going to live together for the rest of their lives and then one of them dies and it's going to be horrendous. Yeah. And then the other one will be like done. Yeah. Done. It must be nice to have, but it must be nice to have like someone that you're so as a coach to them for Titus 25 years.

Speaker 7:          00:56:05       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:56:07       Australia's premier tennies players. They're all so identical. Twins. Same Becky. And she doesn't say anything. That's one. They both both serve pretty nice. Have a nice set of

Speaker 1:          00:56:28       it's bad. Yeah, it's bad. Boy, I'm gonna say Minnesota. This is a Minnesota look. Not Everybody. Right. But basically if you leave Minneapolis, this is the state here. It definitely is. And I know this from the airports, like when I've been hanging out, I lived in Minnesota. You're not that wrong. Wisconsin, Nebraska. I've seen this in a couple of packers games. Yup. What do you, hey, here's what we're going to play. What kind of footwear is she wearing? Oh Man. It's real sensible. And like you said, really nothing acute going on down there. Um, she's probably either wearing burkin stocks, toe shoes, or like really pat like heavy orthopedic tenant, orthopedic mother, the straps, the many layers. Think about the Velcro is easy on, easy off. Yeah. What do you think your panties look like? They're sensible. They're big. They're not a pretty color. They're not like pink or fun happening. She's got, I got chocolate brown. Does that matches my dicky?

Speaker 1:          00:57:47       Whoa. A year. Me. Shouldn't we be getting a call from those guys bringing our TV? Now you know what people have been asking us. Why haven't you covered the Downton series finale? Why haven't you covered how so far? It's one way we don't have our TV's hooked up yet. We just moved in. So it's going to be a minute. Hopefully today. Yeah. I supposed to be today. We don't have TVS. We haven't seen the Downton. We haven't seen house of farts. I know he's been out for 10 days, so bummed out. I'm so mad. It took a lot of resistance to not, you know, jump online and watch. Oh, right. A lot. Uh, you know, uh, discipline, discipline. So not to resist watching it. I'm so glad he did. Yeah. Yeah. Cause I want to watch it on the big, on the big stream maybe. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:58:33       I want the baby jeans goes to sleep. We can catch one episode night and catch up. That'd be fun. Oh my God. It's tremendous. Railey and wondering what Claire Is. Bud Hall smells like this season. It's got to get better. It gets better with every year. Yeah. And there's probably scenes of her, I'm sure they incorporated that into the story where she's like, oh I'm the president's wife. Presidential ass smells. It makes people come up the stairs and Neil remember orange. You see they had orgies in the other seasons already. Not Orgy three ways, like the first season. She's like, you need this. And then they do it. They did it with one of their secret service guys. Dude. Cause he's leans, he's ACDC is my dad says suit about cock double cock.

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       Yeah. Do you think we could get into that kind of lifestyle? Yeah. Yeah. I'm Paulina by of course. What about her? Could she join in? I think that'd be like one for you to test drive and then, you know, here, I'd like to hear the report afterwards. Didn't you get offered to go to some BDSM clubs? Yes I did. I met really cool couple. Um, it's like everyone had left except for six, eight people after the show Friday. Yeah. And this couple was talking and then I was there with a, a comic named Amy Miller. Really funny. And she was talking to the lady and somehow through their conversation, uh, led to, they're like, oh yeah, we do porn. And I was like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, wow. Washed is bullshit. And then we just started talking and they were like, of course the most, um, like laid back, cool, warm, all always made, no big kind of thing of it.

Speaker 1:          01:00:25       And then they're like, oh, we're hosting this a BDSM party tomorrow. You guys want to come? And I was like, that would be a lot of fun. And they were like, oh, swing by. I'm like, I dunno man. I go, I got a late show here. I'm going to be showing up at like 2:00 AM what am I going to do at a BDSM part is like, it's just fun to watch. I don't know. It's kind of like, I remember in first year in college in San Francisco, they have this thing called the exotic erotic ball, which is like their version of that around Halloween. And uh, my friends and I were like, we're going to go, we bought tickets. And if you're not really participating in something like that, it's so fucking uncomfortable cause it, the room just smells like a hot diaper. I look so gross.

Speaker 1:          01:01:07       I would like to go, people watched at that thing. But the thing is, I think if, if you're a non participant and you're, and you're watching people, then they're like, whoa, what the fuck are you doing? That's rude. You just be like, Nah, I'm watching you be weird. Yeah. So I'm not against doing it. They were super nice. So I really do appreciate the invite. Very nice. I wish it would go to a BDSM party. Yeah. And then use all of a sudden you're just scrolling online and you see me, uh, strapped and leather hanging from a, from a ceiling, Tom. And you're like, what, where, when did you do this? I'm like, Oh yeah, I forgot I did that. Like all casual, you know, that was a while ago. How long ago? Like three weeks ago. You know how many people will be in you? I think so. I did.

Speaker 5:          01:02:41       oh,

Speaker 6:          01:02:45       wrap your head around that sound for a second.

Speaker 3:          01:02:47       That's not Mac. That's the other thing.

Speaker 5:          01:02:50       Yeah.

This fear, if you're into the amateur stuff, don't. Nah,

Speaker 5:          01:03:33       no.

Speaker 6:          01:03:36       Oh Geez. Scott. Yeah. Yep. Just put it in there.

Speaker 3:          01:03:43       It makes you think you're really missing out in life. You know when you listen to those clips. Yeah. Like what have I been doing? And now that, yeah, that no one's, no one's talked to me like that before. Wow. I eat the ass and busy all the time. I got nothing. There you go. Excellent. Yoshi too. I ran into him last week. I'm in a black woman in Yoshi last week series. Tell your story first. I just saw how many came out from the Middle East. He had some crazy stories. So hooker stories of course, I'm sure. Um, I was at Fedex. Fedex, yes.

Speaker 6:          01:04:16       And, um, I'm looking at the woman across me, a black woman working behind the counter. I'm, the light is reflecting off of her name badge. Kind of oddly like, you know, you go like, I can't really make out the letters. There's like a shiny name badge and I, and then I go like, this can't be right. I go, you is your name of Yoshi? And she goes, yeah. And I go, Oh really? And she goes, yeah, I go where you would, you have a military parent? And she goes, oh, cause he was stationed in Okinawa. So that's why they named me Yoshi. I go, I have a Japanese friend named Yoshi. And she goes, yeah, yeah. People always trying to figure it out. But no, my name's Yoshi. That's my real,

Speaker 3:          01:04:59       you think as a man's name is weird. Oh fuck. I don't know. What do I know? I liked it and gave it to her. Oh, look at you. Yeah, sure. So shout out to fed ex and what not and whatnot, you know, say for real though. I'm like God. Okay. Alright, I'll write.

Speaker 1:          01:05:19       You know what I'm saying? God is good. God is good all the time. Yeah. Wow. Good. I keep pushing. Did you get to sleep at all while you were away? Lucky one night. Yeah. That was a dude notes Friday morning. Yeah. I would ask how that goes, but I can't really talk about, no, I know, but I had to like, so people know that means I had a phone call with agents and networks. Like here's what's wrong with what you wrote. So that there wasn't so bad. It was just that I had to get up to do it. I was like I never one day a week, one day I know that I could sleep. I had to get up fucking socks and then I was up cause it was an hour phone call. It's the worse. I know what happened last night. Um, there were these two girls from Alabama sitting in the audience and they were young and like hip looking and I'm like, you guys are definitely from here.

Speaker 1:          01:06:11       And they're like, no, we just moved here from Birmingham. I'm like, good for you. Good. That is huge. You know we have like one listener in Birmingham. No, we don't play monk, but he's not the only one. Yeah, no. How five others? No, it's more than that. It's not that, it's not that small. Birmingham's got like a tiny city and when we went there and you order like five different thousand chicken wings, all of the show, we did a show at the uh, whatever dome started and then Whoa man, fucking phone of your phone. Yeah. Yay. Then the um, we went to a wing place. It was like a popular wing place. What is it called? Buffalo Wings are wildly, I think while wings. And then I was like, I don't know which one is like the one to get, you know, when you go, like what's the good one though?

Speaker 1:          01:07:01       Like, oh, people like this. So I walk out and you're like, what'd you get? And I go, I think I got like 40 or 50 wings, no more than that. Even get so many. And then we sit in there in the, in the hotel, it's like five, 10 wings. And it's like, I feel pretty good. I'm like, well, just so you know, I have 45 more weeks. We literally had like 10 boxes. I'm like, baby, what did you do? Dude did. Yeah, it's a little, I did like a Sushi order with wings. Good Roll Tad. Well some nights, Tyro, Tyro, Tyro tower. So weird. And they're friendly to you in the south. Hey y'all. Hey y'all roll tide route happy. It was really, that was a good trip. Yeah, I did actually enjoy it. We drove through the south. Remember some of it was really pretty. We did Nashville. Yup. Did we do Atlanta? I don't remember. No, no, no. We did. We did. We did. Yeah. Yeah, we drove through Tennessee. I remember, you know what I'm saying? And talking about, you know, God is good. God is good though, by the way. So speaking of the south, thanks guys for keeping a Trump alive in the polls. I'm an embarrassment. That is, it's pretty wild, right?

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       Can't really, Wayne County. Yes you can.

Speaker 6:          01:08:20       Um, but we thought, why not bring out another candidate who, you know, maybe you could rival, uh, Donald Trump, so we have a clip of another candidate to consider.

Speaker 11:         01:08:35       Well, of course I believe that I paved the way for Donald Trump. I brought ridiculousness of politics and he saw an opening and he jumped on in there. So I think there is, I think I drove my own base. I played towards my own constituency. You know, I have my own people, so yeah, there's plenty of room for me in this mass for sure. In fact, I am on the ballot here in New Hampshire. I won the Democratic primary ballot.

Speaker 3:          01:08:59       It's vermin supreme. Oh yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:09:02       So, you know, I'm just thinking that if you are considering voting for Trump, why not consider voting for vermin supreme? Okay. He has a lot of ideas. Um, if you want to take a look for are people that aren't watching our youtube bay. Um, could you describe what you see?

Speaker 3:          01:09:20       Yeah. Is that a helmet, like a GG Allen helmet or is it a s? I can't tell. I think it's more like a wizard. A wizard. Yeah. He looks like a, like a hippie wizard full gray beard. He's got an American flag embedded in the beard. Is there a broom? It does. You have a Bruin? Is Is, oh, I can see that. Yeah. He's cleaning up the streets. I think that's what that metaphor is. Um, he's got supporters, guys was rainbows and Unicorns behind him. It's all kinds of cray cray.

Speaker 11:         01:09:53       Well I've known for for a basic platform planks do my platform, the hours falls of course Zombie preparedness. The only caters with the Zombie Preparedness Plan. And I'm going to a harness the zombies for energy sources by utilizing the latest and giant hamster wheel technology. We will have lots of zombies and we'll just sort of dangle brains in front of them and then they will turn the giant turbines creating energy. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:10:16       that makes sense. It makes more sense. And Trump, I think he makes a lot more sense than Trump. Um, and the, the whole, uh, I tell you the idea that I didn't know there were that many stupid people. I knew that there was a lot of stupid people. I didn't know there were that many.

Speaker 3:          01:10:33       Yeah. It's really appalling that people are into, I think it's such a, well, my family or even into trial and really very bad. Who can't sell? You want to tell you off the air, off the air. It's intense. Right? It's so dumb. It's so fucking dumb now. He's the dumbest buffoon ever. I mean, he's a failed businessman. He's a, he's just a complete failure as a megalomaniac personality disorders. We're talking about a guy that just has filed bankruptcy fucking five times and you know, he just licenses his names out the place. It's the only, he's not even like a

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       really savvy businessman and he's a big ad pretty openly. It's kind of crazy. So fucking annoying. I actually feel bad for conservative people because he's not one of you. You know, he's not a conservative, doesn't really give a shit. I know. He's just like, whatever. What are you doing? I Dunno. I feel like you were selling my shit. Oh. Oh. So I don't know. I just ate. It's horrible. This guy has got some, so that's what I'm saying. This guy's got ideas. That's the other thing is Trump actually doesn't know any policy stuff. Yeah. If you, if you bring up any point, well what are you going to do about immigration? You're going to see lot of things are going to be different. Uh, what about terrorism? It's going to be way different when I get in there. You'll see I'm not gonna I'm not going to get pushed around anymore. Oh, okay. Great. That's really good.

Speaker 11:         01:12:03       Cool. Number two, of course. Time travel research. I, we'll go back in time. Kill Baby Hitler with my bare hands before he said Bush. Well, once again, Jeb Bush said he would kill Baby Hitler. Hell yeah. Would I say I've got it.

Speaker 1:          01:12:20       He's promising he's going to go and kill Baby Hitler. That's huge. Wow. I mean huge. Your politician nowadays will make such bold claims, but a lot the wizard. Wow, that's awesome. And the thing that I want to know is how will that affect this drop? I mean, you realize if he actually does what he says is going to do, when I go to press that button, there'll be nothing there. Nothing to Ah, you're right. Yeah. Time travel. Wow. That's kind of ruins a few episodes of our show. We're going to have to write into this guy. Yeah, Dude. Um, maybe could, I dunno. Maybe it was. Yeah. So now, now you're seeing somebody who's out of the box, but makes sense. I'm not like Trump. He does make more sense than Donald Trump. You do it.

Speaker 11:         01:13:12       And then of course, mandatory tooth brushing laws. This has been eroding the gum line of this great nation of ours who were too long and this great country has been suffering a great moral in oral decay in spirit and incisors are country's future depends on its ability to fight back. We can no longer be a nation. Indentured are very salivation is at stake. What does mandatory to request your law is really about, is strong team for a strong America. May we become a sea of shining, smiling, shiny, smiling, shiny, smiling, smiling, smiling, smiling, shining faces from sea to shining sea. Thank you. I've referenced the brave. Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:13:44       This is a lot of stuff that's tapped into the show. Did a dental updates. He's into, hey, Hitler's and all of it, man. Wow. Yeah. But I will say that he was a son. Feels like he wants to stop saying hey, littler. But you know, I would say that in this case. That makes sense. Yeah. You know? But he definitely likes dental updates to clearly and again, those, that, the little

Speaker 6:          01:14:12       bit we've seen here, much more policies savvy than Donald Trump actually has. Tangible ideas. Yeah. Real ideas. Real plans.

Speaker 12:         01:14:20       Oh, one, two and four. What about number three? Oh, number three of card, three ponies for all Americans. It is of course a job stimulus creation program. And it is a federal pony identification program when you have to raise taxes for that. No, they're free.

Speaker 3:          01:14:34       Tony's. That's it guys. Great. Yeah. Is he in San Francisco? I Dunno. This seems like a San Francisco kind of guy. I don't know. But he's really, I don't know. I'm a big fan. I'm a huge fan too. Vermin supreme. All right.

Speaker 6:          01:14:46       So, um, I dunno, uh, if you're a Trump guy, maybe reconsider you start thinking about what is he running under vermin? Uh, I'm assuming an independent, uh, we got to wrap this up pretty soon. Oh, do you want to see this real quick? Cause we've been really high on ours. Second Chinese male and a lot of people have been asking you about it on the show. Here is a, um, well I'll let you just see what shows

Speaker 12:         01:15:18       you wouldn't use a dry paper towel to wash a dirty car. So why use dry toilet paper to clean up in the bathroom, the water to get clean yet prove your bathroom routine and get completely clean with a new good day, buddy. Look, traditional toilet paper is rough and scratchy, but the day buddy Sprague gently washes your clean paper, gets messy paper and can be expensive. But with the bid day buddy, you don't have to worry about any of that.

Speaker 3:          01:15:45       Wait a minute. Well, you still have to use paper. You dummy. Well, yeah, but I all I could think about in this ad. It's just thinking of this woman taking a shit. Me Too. Everybody that speaks in this, I'm like just picturing them shitting. I picturing her wiping, not shaming and I love the argument is you just don't want to waste toilet paper. Yeah. Instead of like, Hey, it feels nicer there. She also said like you ran out of paper like, no, you don't like, it's a big problem in every household. You're always out of paper. Yeah. It's an efficiency. Save money. Yeah. A picture of me taking a shit right now. You wouldn't, not even in this nice blonde lady takes shits or the fatigue shirts. Yes.

Speaker 6:          01:16:24       I never would've thought that. Listen to this lady, but then she does.

Speaker 12:         01:16:27       Eve how clean you feel after you go to the bathroom?

Speaker 6:          01:16:30       Don't now I picture her with like the sweetest, cleanest little ass hole. It sounds like a pink waxed. Okay. Just super plain asshole. Relax. You just want to eat up the boot and relax.

Speaker 3:          01:16:42       I only go to the bathroom. She should just say it's specifically for shitting this product.

Speaker 12:         01:16:47       I've literally never felt like this before. Water toilet paper just pushes the wipes. Leave residue behind. Yeah, it's true. I tell you buddy uses fresh water to rinse. You clean leaving nothing behind.

Speaker 3:          01:17:02       Now why didn't they use Brown stuff for this? This is like a, that purple purple is an interesting color choice.

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       Make it brown so we know what you're talking about. Or black or red because of the deep, deep blood red. You're probably used to seeing a lot of blood. When you go to the bathroom with the day buddy, all that blood gets washed away. If you're used to, pulls a blood leaving you when you sit down to go potty. Now with the day buddy, all that blood gets flushed away.

Speaker 12:         01:17:37       Read a book and you can adjust the water. Right?

Speaker 1:          01:17:40       Oh, you're perfect for kids. She high five them and she's like, you could wash your little ass hole and you high five drinks. I like the firm setting sounded really from, yeah, that sounded like a hose. Yeah. I don't know if you wanted that hard on your asphalt. Happy she is at her son's has a clean asshole. Yeah. You took a shit

Speaker 12:         01:17:59       at parents do hemorrhoids or IBS

Speaker 1:          01:18:03       and he's so happy. He's like, he's got a newspaper under his arm. Right. Him. It's like my daddy's going to come over and use her day. My grandson clean is the asshole in my old ass holes. Clean too.

Speaker 12:         01:18:16       Needs of the day, buddy. I'm a truck driver. I sit all day.

Speaker 1:          01:18:20       You know he could take a shit. Yeah, and that's what, that's what he's saying. He's like, I'm a truck driver so you know I can shit. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         01:18:26       Nothing queens like the day buddy. I just love it. It's just, it's just easy and toilet paper, you know, it's not as cool.

Speaker 8:          01:18:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:18:35       No, it's fine. They're making this sound like you bid day as opposed to using the toilet paper. Yeah. It should be in conjunction. In addition to water on your ass hall. Yeah. Wow. What a neat commercial. Thank you. Yeah, man. Pretty good stuff. Oh God. We've got to get going. Yeah, that was a lot of fun though. Yeah. God, I thought I was fat and that picture. All right, great. All right, the day buddy, I'm sick of wiping. We got, I could just stop wiping during the show. Thanks for watching on Youtube. Uh, your mom's house, podcast.com. Make sure you check it out. Bye guys. Bye now.

Speaker 7:          01:19:19       Right? Cause the toilet, the water everywhere are on the ground. Yeah. I thought it was panic on the ground. I heard you on the ground, on the ground

Speaker 8:          01:20:05       back up and out. Oh my God. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
