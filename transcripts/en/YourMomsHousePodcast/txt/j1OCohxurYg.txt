Speaker 6:          00:11:52       This is my second of the day. Actually. I know you just interviewed your parents. Yes. Big News. Topdog and Charo right in here. We did an hour. Where did she sit here? No, she sat there. Td got this one. Oh boy. There was some ridiculous stuff. So what are we going to get to hear that one?

Speaker 9:          00:12:10       Um, I dunno cause everything right now, the yard, you know.

Speaker 6:          00:12:14       Right. And I had Maria in here. Yeah. So I got, I got a bunch of stuff. We have Maria at the house, I should say. I got some quality time with my sister in law. And while you were gone, oh my God, seriously. It was Omg, Maria, her baby and me and our baby. And it was a whirling dervish. Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. Seriously, seriously. I mean your sister was up at 5:00 AM with a kid

Speaker 9:          00:12:40       first day. So people know, you know, Los Angeles does have a lot of hills. You know, there's like there's hills. Yeah. In different regions of the city. We live in a neighborhood that built on a hillside and it is almost entirely at an incline, like you pull in the neighborhood and you know, it's just, it's all uphill. Yeah. Day One. She, I get up and she's been up there. She's like, hi. Yeah. Hi. Yeah. Actually I can tell she's been outside. You know, she's wearing it. Yeah. And then she's like, like, she's got sun and she's sweating. I go, what'd you do? I was going, I went on the run. I go, where'd you run? Just through the neighborhood. And I go, how far do you run? And she goes, five miles, five miles. How did you know? She goes, I download an APP and it tells you where to go. And I go, this neighborhood's like all uphill. And she goes, yeah, me and my daughter, she did a stroller run up hill for five miles.

Speaker 6:          00:13:44       No, I know. And then she's ready for the day. And then that's when they start. Now she's like, I'm ready. I'm ready for the day. She jacked. So at one point I'll just tell you this, I don't know even know if I told you the whole story. I won't. What I want it to hang some lights in the backyard. I bought some wides on Amazon, I wanted a bed, we had big plans for these lights. You and I went to the hardware store, we bought like bamboo rods and try to hang, you know, like those years in restaurant lines. So I figured to keep your sister occupied because I don't like doing stuff. Right. Okay. And I can say I s I knew it already when we were a low, what are we gonna do today? Know it was kind of wondering, we're not happen. So I think I figure I'm going to keep Maria occupied and I'm going to make it her project to hang up the lights.

Speaker 6:          00:14:30       Yeah. And I'll just kind of chill out with Ellis and you know, watch the chaos unfold. Well the chaos and folded your sister is like, okay, where can we plug these in? And then she found one outlet and then, you know, outcomes, the wiring. And then I go, I listen, we, we need to dig holes to put the bamboo in the grass. I go, we don't want, we don't have a shovel. I don't know how we're gonna do this. That's okay. I'll just, I'll go get a spoon. She goes into our kitchen, she's the one that thought of that. She thought of that of course, got a spoon and then one of our knives cooking knives, she pulls it out of the thing and I, before I know it, she's already digging with a nice kitchen knife and a spoon. And I go, Maria, I think we got to abort this mission.

Speaker 6:          00:15:15       I have something tells me this is not the right way to do lists. I go, let's just a board, are you sure? Cause I think I can figure this out. We're going to do this. I'm like, no, you can't do that. Then she goes, why don't I just climb up these trees and climb the trees and I'll put them in the trees. I'll just climb up the trees and I go, what? And she goes, I climb trees every day. It's fine. It's fine. I was like, I don't think so. Maybe not this time. Do you have a ladder? I go, forget it. No, it's crazy. Your sister wanted to dig holes with spoons and knives and then climb arteries. She's crazy. Total crazy. That's her. That's been her since we were kids. Yeah, quite an imagination and always going. Never stops. Never stops. It's never seen her retired. Just goes so much.

Speaker 6:          00:16:03       A couple of things. First of all, how adorable is this, Bro? I'm telling mom. It's also interesting that she told this. I presume this is her sister, but she told her via video message. That's maybe just what kids do now. Right? We don't leave notes now. This is the no opposed to note a video note. I hope. God, thanks a lot. Thanks it auction Ethiopia. Thanks a lot Mitchell. Thanks a lot. Thanks to you. Matt is not charging on my iPod because he's not trying to. It's all on them because I've told mom happy. I hope y'all happy. I've told mom is great. She so mad yet. Yeah, look at that. That's such a stern talking to you. I hope y'all had backs. So cute. Oh Mom, what did she mean? The iPad gets used to someone's charged. There is a weird thing with chargers sometimes when you plugged them into certain devices like the same, I don't know that it's a thing, you know that's been proven, but you put it in yours, you're like, oh, it doesn't work. Somebody else puts it in there as, and it charges. Is that true to ban? Yeah. Oh, that's a new one. Thank you. I got that from the Internet. Oh really? Yeah. I was going to tell you someone called Dj man. Make that up. That's fine. I'll take it.

Speaker 6:          00:17:33       Excellent. Is that true? I have seen it happen before. I'll be like, oh, this device doesn't recognize this wire. I've seen weird stuff. Oh yeah, yeah, I've seen that. Legit. She's fired up, man.

Speaker 9:          00:17:50       I did one of those things. You remember how forever we didn't realize we could just put an extension cord so you can plug things on your side of the bed. So dumb. Yeah, and I was so many things for so long. I know. I'm like, we can just plug it in and an extension cord and you're like, oh my God. And then the other one was we just had one, a charger for our devices, like for r three two iPads. Two iPhones. Yeah. And then I was at a mall like a month ago and I go, I'm going to buy more chargers so that now we could charge more stuff at once. It was like a breakthrough thought for me. What's wrong with us? I think you and I are like Frat boys. Like whatever's happening is fine. We'll just make, just make it do we just get used to this because we were broke for so long.

Speaker 9:          00:18:41       That's why I don't think we realized we can spend $12 now on it. She actually, and they fucking rob you. Seriously. How much is first of all, they conveniently, they go, we were selling just the chart. Like the plug in the charger has one now they sell the part that goes in the wall. No. Or that goes on your device separately. Both. And I think one's 29 and one's mother fucker. You buy like a $50 no. Yeah. Yeah. It's expensive. Very get your entire life. Yeah. It's expensive. What about that one we have downstairs and the kitchen. That's just a one piece. It looks kind of old school. [inaudible] that one's a gray charger by yeah. Yeah. That one is made by an outside. That's good. Yeah. We got to get more of that for cheaper. I mean they all those people, those was the way to go. There's that much cheaper, such scumbags. Crazy. But they make such good shape. By the way, do you want to hear somebody made a, um, a version of your mom's house? Yeah. This is Dj wet nut sack. Okay. It's his version of the associates. The as big Tam who is Randy, don't bring anyone loving to this. Your Mama and the funk is style.

Speaker 10:         00:19:57       Well, the hair, your mom's house said your mom's house

Speaker 9:          00:20:11       sounds like the uh, the South Park. A teacher. You what I'm talking about? Yeah. Mister Mister. Hey Mr. Garrison. Yeah. It's like Mr. Garrison has doing this. You know this guy? No. But he did submit something like a week or two ago and he was so stoked to your stuff that you submitted us like a whole book. Oh, okay. Okay. All right. Well I, this is very interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:20:36       You got that part right there. Purposely said those things.

Speaker 6:          00:21:01       Oh, okay.

Speaker 6:          00:21:10       Good job. Good job, Dj wet notes at your mom was in the fucking stage. There's a cutting that and stains and he'll tell you how this is supposed to go. Okay. This shit is big time. Come on now. Who is Randy? That's good job. Oh, bring anyone loving there. Don't bring any was mother into this. Your Mama and the funk is stay or what? Your mom and the fucking stands, man. Come on. You got to listen to at Patrion episode where we break down this intro. We just spent like 30 minutes covering this. Which episode is that? Blue Bat? Uh, I think that might be episode three on patriotic [inaudible] dot com slash mom. There you go. Uh, yeah, we go into detail. Do you want to hear the every of how the intro was made? Um, yeah. Patrion on.com/. Dot. Um, put that shit down. So then you had, you had Mario with you for a few days. I'm exhausted. So your sister left and I, I felt so tired. Like I think that's what, why I'm still so exhausted is just having any guests. Yeah. And then having your sister who's just having two babies, her baby, our baby, we had nonstop tears.

Speaker 6:          00:22:32       So many cries and then family was here yesterday and that was exhausting and really get together yesterday. We dead. Yeah, we sure. Did she talk about who wasn't at the gathering? No. Who? Oh yeah, go ahead. Can I tell them what we did yesterday? Are you okay with that? Sure, of course. He baptized our son Ellis, so now he's going to go to heaven. Um, and uh, so I, we invited the whole, the clan, the there was already was baptized cause every time we see this blue band, he cries on the right path. That's good. He knows he's not Christian.

Speaker 6:          00:23:14       Right. So we extended the invitation to everybody and their families and my dad, I told him like months ago, this is happening. It's like, oh, I can't go. I'm like, why? Why? It's you're, you're only grandsons baptism. What can be more important than, Oh, I'll go into Vietnam. So my dad left on like Thursday. The baptism was on Sunday. Like you couldn't move that ticket, Bro. A couple of days. It's so crazy. Right. Could've could've left today. I love now. Still still be there in time for all the art he's looking at and it doesn't have work. All the art he's looking at it probably it's a probably a cultural trait, I'm guessing why it's so important for him to be there. Well, for you to say something like that, I mean, maybe go over where his last few trips while he goes to other countries like the Philippines or Thailand, Brazil, Brazil, places known for their culture and their art work. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure that tied in. I bought it. Did you watch toes? I don't know how you think. I don't know. And I know what the common denominator is with all these countries. Yeah, I dunno. He got a stiff and going after her better. I don't know. So we'll, you know, we'll see how that shakes down when Ellis is old enough to ask why is it grandfather in any way,

Speaker 9:          00:24:48       these photos. Yeah. So he couldn't make it

Speaker 6:          00:24:59       how that'd people made it. People made it just fine, but other people didn't have trips planned.

Speaker 9:          00:25:08       Horrible. Oh my gosh. I got, I talk to my shrink tomorrow for sure. It's normal for him though. It start off. Yeah, of course. For him. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think the logic w w what was happening? Um, I just think that like in his case, he doesn't, he doesn't think like the way that others at all. Oh, sorry. It's just, it's so outside of his mindset. Yeah. To go like, just to think like that. To think like a human, oh no, not like a human, like a person with feelings. Oh, your dad's got it. Kind of a one track kind of focus on him, I think. You know. Uh, yeah. I think, I think it doesn't occur to him. And even if you were to tell him, you know, all the reasons like, hey, you know, you should be here for this. And yeah, I wasn't going to do that. Yeah, I totally get that. But I think he would go like, okay, like I'll do that that cause you asked me to do that. Yeah. He doesn't think like I should do that.

Speaker 6:          00:26:09       No, there's no, there's no should. I think that's the whole thing with him is that there was never, I ought to do x instead of y or Z. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:26:18       He just does what he wants. You know? There's no, there's no art. There's no control. It's just I what I want. All right. Yeah. That's a really heavy stuff sometimes.

Speaker 5:          00:26:33       Mm.

Speaker 9:          00:26:37       Yeah, and we'll scale it was this place. It's interesting. That was crazy. Wait, what? Now let's, okay, what's his house didn't give it almost,

Speaker 6:          00:26:46       well that was going to be a whole ordeal though. We had to find a place for him and all that stuff. I know it didn't work out. No, it didn't work out. It's just so it's, but it's interesting because, but now that I think about it, I'm not even sure, you know what I mean? Like when you have a parent that's a little kooky shoes, do even, is it that parent that you want at these events or is it the idealized version? It's a good point, right? Like I'm not even sure

Speaker 9:          00:27:09       for a long, long, long time. You keep requesting the thing you want right from the, from said person. Right, right. It doesn't have to be parents. It can be a friend. It can be a sibling spouse, right. Yeah. In, in different, uh, scenarios like this. Yeah. And then you get to the point where you're like, oh, it's okay that said person, right. Is Not at anything. Or I just have to change my expectation of set of person.

Speaker 6:          00:27:37       Yeah. Cause then that part isn't, you're not going to get what you want. Yeah. Maturity, man. Yeah. That's the part, that's the thing that takes a long time. 40 years. I'm with you. I'm seeing a shrink at the same, same, same thing too, is like, it's always about your expectation. You're right with your social, your parents switching when you become a parent. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:27:58       No. Wow. Was that synergy [inaudible] synergy. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:28:08       So anyway, that was our weekend. The family came. It was a great time yesterday. Top Dog and Charo Maria and her husband that Bri, Bri, my, my cousins came from Riverside. My aunt. It was great. She's hilarious. She's so, she's the most normal besides my cousins, the most normal person who squeezed into my family. She's a social worker. Yeah. Sweet Lady. She's retired now, but like the sweetest person. So you know, we had, we had a great time. Yeah, it was great. It was going to, her son's going to heaven

Speaker 9:          00:28:37       and hopefully we'll have a cool pictures from Vietnam too.

Speaker 6:          00:28:43       Maybe I'll have a new mom. I don't know. And I got to check. This is cause this is Shara or maybe you'll have a new brother or sister, half Vietnamese.

Speaker 9:          00:28:52       Who knows? What does she say? She asking about dinner? This is what she said.

It's very fun. It was neat. I asked you to put my phone on the charger last night cause I was asleep and then he didn't do it right and I got mad at you and when I walked over and it was like God punish me because you farted and it was like a hot garbage fart. It was hot trash. It was really disgusting. The made me so happy. It made me so happy. What did you, now that wasn't just dinner because my farts didn't smell like that.

Speaker 6:          00:30:31       What did you eat on the road prior? Actually it was a pretty health healthy road weekend. Yeah. San Diego, California. You can find like vegetables and shit. Now. How's your IBS update? Do we have one? There's not really much of one. Well there is an update. Um, I did always, you know, you don't want to have the doubts. So I went and I cleared the whole food allergy thing off the table. Okay. I got tested across the board and there's nothing, no food allergies. Great. Yeah. So that's, that's a relief. And then when are we going to be home for a few weeks and then lagging me a drink? I have to clear my whole system out. You mean you have to shit a lot? Yeah. Yeah, I've heard that is intense. Like I heard that you shit a lot. Like he ever drink that dieters t that Asian dieters who by accident I one time in college I did so like slimming tea.

Speaker 6:          00:31:31       You just Shit Shit Shit. I think it's like a, it's pretty intense and I think it actually is over a day of doing that. Just shedding. I think maybe I'll weigh in against burden, but when I do that you got to clear your calendar. You're gonna lose like 10 pounds. You wanted me to everybody. I'm so this is, this is the original original. This guy's back, but let's, let's, which bathroom is use? My God, I talked at length about that topic with my parents. I got really serious trying to have fun with gender pronouns and then I definitely about, I'm saying there's a transgender and he's in the women's room when he's there to rape.

Speaker 6:          00:32:17       I don't think that happens. Okay. He said they're there to rape. Oh No. All right. All right. Did you ask your dad what is Pronoun? I played in the clips of the pronouns guy explaining stuff and they were just like, okay my mom just like so are you eat a day or them there? My Dad actually made a good point. He goes, well what happens? I'm like you guys speak Spanish and that's a masculine feminine language. Yes. And I was like that's a good question. Yes. Um, but then we kind of figured out that you could like instead of saying like a Giddy, you could say like [inaudible] which is a disaster. Yeah. Cause in German there's within the words still not just the word right before it, the words end up being, you have to match it to the feminine and masculine. That's very German. You have deed dare or dos, masculine, feminine and Neuter. So they accommodated as well. Maybe the neutral force both get ace. Oh God. It managed anyways. He got just manage all scared. Ace. I love this guy. So

Speaker 11:         00:33:32       hello guys. I know, I know. I am still seeing go. I am seeing go and I am looking for a girlfriend. Yes, I am looking for a girlfriend. If you know a girl who is single, please tag her right now because I want to go in the relationship with that guilt. All right. I want to go in the relationship with that guilt.

I am looking for low guilt. You can go in the relationship with me. So if you know a girl who's single plays, tag her right.

Speaker 6:          00:34:25       There's so much wrong because I am single and I want to date her. We know number one, maybe not film in front of the toilet. Yeah, I mean pick any other spot on campus. Yeah, it's not, it's not ideal right now. One, it's too desperate. Women don't want that. No, that's too much, but he's back. I can't wait. I think he learned. Okay. Let's see. Let me just definitely more serious. That was kind of silly kind of goofy. Fuck. Look at, look at that face now. Oh, he's grown up. Oh he looks like he's raped. If you girl, oh my God, what am I? God I look, I'm not saying he did. I'm just saying that's an intense no, he just knows what it is to get a nut now. Like he knew he got his nut.

No, it doesn't go good girls that want, when you want to close the deal. What's a, what do you mean you gotta be like a jerk, not a jerk. I think. I think that like, that silliness is not how you get when you're, especially when you're young, you know, cause it's not label energy. Right. It's goofy energy and girls, I want to leg cause we energy lets you, the thing is, unless you hang out with girls. Yeah, but it's a nonthreatening type of thing. It's a buddy buddy. At our g and right here he learned. He learned that, that's friend energy. This is Dick Energy, right? Yeah. I going to have this calm energy. Yeah. Yeah. Look at that. Do you tell right away he's all about business. He's like, I've found a girl. The other one is seeing his face like ah yeah, I've had sex with goals. He knows now emails. Let's see if he knows. I think he knows now. Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:37:05       know, oh my God, I think maybe he didn't fully learn the lesson, the correct. It sounds like a, a gay disco in the background. Yep. And number two, this only works this approach on other data. You've said this before. Yeah. This is, this is actually a great lesson. Gee, this is not for women. He Won. This is masculine towards men. Guys that don't know that. Yeah. It's usually younger. Like he's a young guy. He doesn't know they go because they're so overwhelmed with their sexual desires. Know how to get it. He doesn't know what to do. Frustrated. Yeah. Yeah. This isn't, he's, he's on the right path. Booboo. You're almost there. Yeah. If, if I were, I mean, good advice would be what? Throw on a shirt. Um, maybe talk, there's gotta be some interest in no, I think because the kind of girl he needs.

Speaker 6:          00:37:53       Yeah. I don't think he's busted that first night. Really. He needs a girl who he needs a gal who can, who's into the body, the mind. Some girl who's a real pig, who's his age, who is like, I don't get it. I'm a fan of that. About him. That's the sky off. Like, like your slut girl voices. Yeah. So he needs it to keep the shirt off but not say what he wants. He should talk about something else. Yeah. And then girls will be all, oh my God, we got a Hottie as like, you know, Justin Bieber. He used to do it where he'd just be like, hey, you know, and then you just don't talk about wanting to fuck somebody. I gotta look at that stare. Oh my God, he's so into it. He's got so much calm inside this raging through his veins right now. Yeah. You can smell it. It's too much. Yeah. Poor guy. Yeah. Can somebody please lay this guy? Are you in New Zealand listening?

Oh, speaking of racist, um, this lady, I as a white woman and she has her own bed company. Is that what it is? She has a bed company. I think that's just like her gimmick or something. Right. And she is that, it looks like, um, almost like a company party of some kind. Right. It's like, it's, it seems like it's a business related party. Definitely a crowd full of her friends. Yeah. And she sings a song yeah. At this party. Yeah. About being a Ninja and goes into a full Asian mockery of it. And there's an Asian woman right next to her who's face changes throughout the performance. She's like, oh, and then she's like, you're being so racist right now. Yeah. Oh, let's see. Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:43:06       No, yeah, it's really bad. You reminds me of, for some reason that summertime is great people. Oh yeah. It's made shitty music. Like it's almost a, yeah. This is almost too stupid to really be offensive because you're like, oh, she's just a dang dog.

Speaker 9:          00:43:23       It doesn't know what she's doing. I would say that for sure. But, um, word summertime, people should be fucking, um, yeah. The worst. That was the worst. There was the absolute worst. Yeah. Um, you made a good song. I just remember seeing that a second ago. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:43:40       Wait a minute. I think we should have a little contest. This just reminded me. Yeah. You know Nick Hog, I think we've determined that his worst song is breaking a sweat.

Speaker 9:          00:43:52       Did, did we read what he wrote or the the, the email we got? Yeah, we did. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:43:57       yeah. You read it on the show? Yes. Yes. Okay. Now I'm saying apropos of this, I nominate because I know how hard it is to make music and I don't like to just shit on people arbitrarily. I'm going to put my song animal song up against Nick Hawks breaking a sweat and you tell me who song is better. Christina put jetskis animal song or nick hawks breaking a sweat. I just to show that like I don't just shit on people without putting my own hat in the ring. This is the first song I wrote. I have a feeling breaking a sweat as his first song and

Speaker 2:          00:44:39       this is garbage garbage ring such correct. It's embarrassing. Got a lot

Speaker 6:          00:44:54       so fucking bad. That's the fucking worst song I've ever heard. God, you give it 18 seconds. You just trashed it because I'm just saying I don't think animal song is worse than that. I've written one song in my life. It is animal song. Okay, here it is. Maybe two songs. My life. Here's my animal song and you guys tell me who makes a worst song. Me Or Nick Hawk.

Speaker 2:          00:45:44       Right. It's pretty good. I still like it more for sure. It's better than me. It was so hard to get these seagulls to sing at the same time or difficult. Yeah. Take off like a jet. You watching TV, you don't know who can bet on them again?

Speaker 9:          00:46:17       This dog shit. Yeah. So we got a dog. Shit. We have an email come in about, you know, God, that's my angers me. I'll fucking give me the car.

Question Mark. Um, so we heard his song. Your Song. How about my song? Yeah. What's yours?

Speaker 14:         00:47:09       This is the reason it sounds way better than all this looks good plot holes. Pot Holes.

Speaker 6:          00:47:20       Why did my ice cubes smell like a butthole?

Speaker 14:         00:47:24       The smell. The smell. The smell. Pretty good.

Speaker 6:          00:47:30       Yeah. It was like still better than break is really powerful.

Speaker 14:         00:47:34       Waiver the break. But hold my first song I ever made

Speaker 6:          00:47:42       by the time it's something that I actually kept in the freezer. It's gone bad

Speaker 9:          00:48:12       pewter. Same with you. Still better than what Nick hawked it in a studio. It is. What he did was really bad. What did he, it was really bad. And he should I shoot her an apology song. You should make an album of songs that apologize for this whole album. It's a good idea. Yeah. I'm apologizing. Apologizing on the booth. Apologize around for breaking a sweat. Oh my God. Yeah. That whole album is really terrible. Yeah. Let me get the memories. You got the country song too. Oh boy. That was the only good ones. These have no views. I mean like the view counts on them are so, so weird. Tiny. It's really weird. Yeah. Like a dude farting has more accounts in these. He has a video here. It's been up for eight months. It's one of his songs, has 42 views. How does it,

Speaker 6:          00:48:59       the house, it's almost impossible to have that little views and eat anything.

Speaker 9:          00:49:03       Oh, he did make the, remember he was, we watched as official music video. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That does have some views on it, so. Okay. Well these people are checking in, seeing what the Hawk is up to. Um, yeah. It was really bad, man. You're really bad. At that, but you're not bad at Hoe and I've seen you Ho guy works out.

Speaker 9:          00:50:39       Um, okay, so this, by the way, um, it's something we always, we always want to pay credit to the best of the best. Uh, the people that really do it right. And, um, there's not, you know, there's always an argument for who is the champion, who's the,

Speaker 6:          00:51:05       who's the best. Here we go. No, we've got a 2001. Yes, yes. Allen's great. That's, that's so great. Classic. There's so many great ones. I'm saying why K W I s

Speaker 9:          00:51:24       and this is, this is right. This is it there. The Diego Sanchez. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty good.

Speaker 15:         00:51:31       And the majority of this sport is, is really just all about the mental aspect of it, you know? Um, I believe it eats first and foremost. It's the training that you put in, in the gym and you know, that's what's going to give you that base, a mental strength because you can, you know, you're going to believe in yourself because of the hard work that you put in the gym and you know, as far as it goes for me, you know what I mean? At once you stepped in that cage. Of course, you know, it's, it's all mental, you know what I mean? You have to, you have to have 100%. We have to be 100% at the time when it's time, you know what I mean? Not 100%. You know, right before the fight. It's 100% when it counts, when it's all on the line.

Speaker 9:          00:52:12       Well mean. Interesting. First of all, I think he has a lot of good things to say. Yeah. Yeah. I liked it. He varies between your nose and he says, you know what I means? What kind of, he really articulates it. Yeah. Sometimes it's, you know what I mean? You know what I mean? But he goes, you know what I mean? Right. It's not that common,

Speaker 6:          00:52:29       but I agree. I, I do like that it varies. The, you knows, you know what I mean? But he's also clear with them. Right. It's a different kind of, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. I also feel bad for that change for you after the second loss. Um, you know, they just get their heads beaten in so much. No, that's true.

Speaker 15:         00:52:49       Um, you know, you know, it wasn't really much that changed. You know, I lost two close decisions, you know, that that could have had two more rounds. You know what I mean by that? Um, as far as that goes, you know, I just, it was learning lessons for me and I had to, I had to make changes and a was, you know, those are fights where, um, the game plan was wrong. You know what I mean? I came down a game plan it, I didn't get hurt and you know, I didn't get close to being submitted are knocked out. I had the wrong game plan. I had the wrong, you know, the wrong people behind me, the wrong circle around me and, and I had the wrong game finance

Speaker 6:          00:53:25       get under your nose or not. Well, I like him for the, you know, category that was eight, you knows. And just that short clip,

Speaker 9:          00:53:32       let's check out the super cut. Yeah. See what we got. Good. Okay. Yeah. So, but what do you do?

Speaker 15:         00:53:38       You know, you know, you know what I mean? You know it, you know what I mean? You know what I mean? You know, um, you know, you don't, you know, I, you know that, you know what I mean? You know, um, you know, you know, yeah. You know, you know what I mean? You know what, you know what, you know what I mean? And you know, you know,

Speaker 6:          00:53:54       I dunno. Good world died work Lubin new man. Oh it was great. And he's kind of like a mellow, he's a mellow, but I still think that's playing a part in how we're receiving these, you know what I mean? Like you're like, oh, it's not that much because he's so chill. Cause a lot of times you know what it means or really hype, you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. This guy really is a kind of a, I'm saying, yeah. You don't even really hear it sometimes. Right, right, right. You know, you know, you know, you know I gave him the Greece. Oh yeah. I tell him it was fine though. Sticking name is ace and you know what I'm saying? Kind of like fuck you. Sale. Yeah, I loosened itself well. Yeah. Okay. So you know what I'm saying? That clip has made people angry. You know food is just prison rape. Right.

Speaker 9:          00:54:54       So focus it. So fuck yourself. You know, tie loosened up a little bit. God does that. Is there anything worse than that? I don't know if you have someone say anything worse to you than that. Yeah, I'd rather just die and it's really, remember how man, how well thought out. That is where they go. The reason I give that clip clip clip keeps playing. He tells you so that if he complained to the guards that he was raped, they can check that he's got grease on his fingers. God. So it looks like, like you know, he figured himself, Oh my God, it was just like to cover themselves. So evil. Yeah. It's like that's pretty bad. Crazy. It's pretty bad. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:55:42       That's my favorite. Yeah. I will save all the clips we've ever played on your mom's house. The Gay, the gay guy getting fucked by imaginary gay ghost. Wait, what does that guy, homeless guy, man ray by home almost being raped by gay guy and now and yeah, but I think homeless guy getting raped by gay goes.

Speaker 6:          00:57:05       And I always am envious of the person that recorded it cause there's one point in the video where he's like shaking from laughing so hard. I'm like, man, I wish I got to cut the gay guy. I mean the, the homeless guy getting right from the get go. So why don't, why don't I get to see cool stuff? Oh, that's a good one. That's a classic one too. Why can't I find the whole, the whole reason I'm playing these, cause I still am looking for, uh, the ultimate, you know what I'm saying? I can't find it. Is that the sugar night? Oh, that's my favorite. I don't see it anymore. I don't know where it went. It's really, really upsetting to me because I remember as an early on one, you know, sometimes you, well that was, yeah, it was one of the first, uh, Y K W I s is, yeah.

Anyways, hey, so can we talk about how we got your parents hooked on the day? They're really, really hooked now. First of all, we came back from the baptism and I had found out the top dog shit on our toilet while we were away.

Speaker 6:          01:00:18       Not on the in it. Well, you know what I'm saying? Like he used our toilet. Yeah. And I didn't know that. So let's back it up while it happened. Oh, he was just like, oh my God. Oh Buddy. He goes, it's real neat. Uh, he goes to water, just goes right up in the asshole and he goes, I had to move a little bit. You know what, to kind of hit it hit the right spot. But he's like three wipes, not nearly as bad. It's real environmental to do that. And we gave him the super deluxe. Yeah. There was a patriotic episode where a lot of times we opened the Po box gifts on patrion episodes. Somebody sent this high grade toilet paper from Japan. Beautiful. Really Nice stuff. I mean, each role is individually all that and like, uh, Lacey, there's encroach Whaley. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:01:10       And I gave it to him. He was like, all right. Yeah. So excited. He was more excited than those. I started to see his grandson. That's what I'm saying. I think there was Alice and then there was toilet paper. I was really excited, but the real kicker was that Charo was like, oh man. She goes, we have to get one of these. That'd be day. Yeah. Yeah. She's hooked actually. It's called something else. Yeah. I'm not sure what we have. Uh, they have a name for it. It's by toto. Yeah, the pain.

Like there's a fucking size of this thing, Jay. Pull the fucking thing. I would definitely watch it. Um, man, this is something we've been wanting to talk about for a while here at this is amaze, amaze,

Speaker 7:          01:08:16       amaze your browns. First. I will read you a couple of emails. Well, here's, um,

Speaker 6:          01:08:24       wait, did you get diarrhea and f an Africa when we were there? I did from the salads. Not until the very anticipating all the tomato. Yeah, that's what I was, I was eating tomato salads at midnight and I finally got diarrhea and Africa and I was expecting it much sooner.

Speaker 7:          01:08:41       This was on reddit about poop pile. Oh, please. It says on a backpacking trip, a couple of friends and I all pooped in the same spot. Then took turns shooting the pile with a 38. Uh, it's from giant robot queue. Uh, lately I've noticed in my community could really use a poop pile. Just hearing the main mom water champion, speak on how the pile brought people in. His community closer together made me realize we need to pull our genes up and become a family community. I could really use some tips and advise them how to get the momentum going on this. I mean, I don't want to poop just anywhere. I want to make it somewhat discreet, but at the same time accessible to anyone in the neighborhood. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks to big bag and zigzags. Hey, real great question and I'd love to help. I'll tell you how we did it. Um, well, we were in a timber wood.

Speaker 6:          01:09:27       North Carolina's lies, lies, lies, right.

Speaker 7:          01:09:30       It was a community, a, an apartment complex that was surrounded by woods, you know, like, like brush. So it was real easy to one of the backyards laid, basically bright upon where the, the woods started. So we just went a few feet back into there. And then on a tree we just built a, um, like a seating area and cut a hole in it so that anybody could go up this kind of makeshift ladder that was on a tree. And then you just start telling people about it. Word will spread and, and pretty soon you'll have mothers and fathers and

Speaker 6:          01:10:05       neighbor kids. You said last week, neighbors, all of that. What's interesting is that the story has changed since you first told me about how the poop pile was constructed. No, you didn't mention a tree before. Of course, it was never, this is the first time I've heard of the tree and you go, yeah, we just put, we had a ladder. I remember the ladder. Right. But you told me it was just a ladder and then you would shit off the ladder. And then that's how the poo piles started. So it's a ladder steps, but it's on a tree. How does that even make sense and how would you shit off of something like that? Will you just sit there off the tree? You're climbing a tree? Yeah, but, and how do you relax enough to shit off of a tree ladder?

Speaker 7:          01:10:49       Most people would go up when they really had to go. So it wasn't like a far as relaxing to go. You had to shit. I mean, a lot of people just sprayed

Speaker 6:          01:10:59       shit. Okay. Yeah. And, and your toilet paper, how did you carry that while climbing the ladder while having to share? Go ahead. You're not climbing on a ladder. Oh, now you're not climbing a ladder. Ladder ladder implies,

Speaker 7:          01:11:15       you know, a metal traditional ladder, right? These are stairs that are nailed to a tree.

Speaker 6:          01:11:22       It's different than the first time I heard about it. Well, I just, we called it a ladder. Okay. It's all lies. No, it's not. It. Is there anybody out there in the city of Los Angeles that is a certified lie detector person stuck right into the show. Your mom's podcast@gmail.com and I would like to set Mr [inaudible] grew up with a actual, the lie detector test. I'm like, see it. This is what people call in the pooped off of it because you tell your dumb friends this idiot story cause you've, you've gotten your friend, you've already done this where you're like, here are talking to Justin and then he'll be like, yeah, boot Paul's real. Cause they didn't talk to Casey. Yeah, we, well it's because you've prepped them before. I'm not a moron. Just like this Josh Potter. It was a doc. Sorry. With the the cigarette burns. Pat House had house on, on your thumbs last week. But he, he was there. He saw it happen. The vagrant who put cigarettes out on your thumbs couldn't jump over that parking meter. They burned my thumbs. Yeah, he was there the next day. He saw him fresh. Okay. They look like cigarette burns. Okay. So are you done bluebell? Sure. How dare you try to

Speaker 7:          01:12:32       support this idiotic story. Got another email. Cookie thief theory. Hey, Mommy's, uh, I have a theory in the cookie. Think I'd like to explore. Yeah. We all been racking our brains over the past several weeks. Wondering why Berta so fat. I'm pretty convinced he has been breaking into people's homes. Oh, cramming all those sugary baked goods down. His giant was filled belly. Yeah. Just like a blow to Santa Claus. Only fatter. Yup, your honor. It, let's look at the facts. Yana, Mr. Crusher, Aka big fat Burke was known acquaintance of the cookie whole. Yes. He had first hand knowledge of the layout of the home where the cookies were being held. Trail. He's totally Yazzie was sneak in and gobble down the fucking cookie. I submit that we enter the cookie wrapper. That was cares who left at the scene for fingerprint analysis. I'm sure we'd be able to lift the perfect, uh, print due to the defendant.

Speaker 7:          01:13:18       Constantly has greasy fingers were on the fried chicken and fatty Handley consumes each day. I feel this is a calculated crime perpetrated by a season. Fat, fat, fat, fat, fat pro. Let's let the truth be told. Finally, get some insight as to why Berta. So fat. Keeping your jeans nice and tight. Stay hydrated. Jinx chinks. Really good point. Really great email. Um, I would have an update by the way on the battle, but I think I have to, uh, at least, uh, regroup with Bertrand first and, and, and kind of share with him what's going on before we dive into the numbers and the tallies. Yeah, yeah. We basically had a tally going, a running tally on which team people are on your either on team birder team Tom. And if you're in team Bert, you're buying a time as fat shirt. And if you're on a team, Tom, you're buying a bird is fat shirt.

Speaker 7:          01:14:07       And uh, it's been, it's been an intense week. You, there's a lot of back and forth. We played a lot of promos, videos up. Um, we really, you know, he actually, I was surprised, but he actually did get a few hardcore people on his side. They really tried to lay me up. I know, but it was, he's, it's, it's pretty still feels pretty one sided to a large degree because the truth, you know, and I will say this, his most diehard like is most devout fans are not funny. Right. Like they're, they're the dumbest and then they are so dumb. And I'm like, I know why you're a bird fan. You know? And then like our most devoted, devoted fans are so fucking funny or smart and funny. Yeah. They're super, they like comedy, right? Yeah. But his real dot. You know, it's funny, I just thought about this as like, his mouth is always open. It's all, he's always, he's always been a mouth breather.

Speaker 7:          01:15:10       Just aesthetically that's not a good intelligent. You're also going to draw in types that are like, yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah. Yeah. He's, they're very dumb. Um, why is it so fun to do stuff to him and why? Why I don't, I think because I have to say this, this needs to be said, this needs to be said. The reason that this got legs is misinterpreted as being, because of me, where my report to the FBI would be that the real driving force behind this was you. Oh, yes. I don't mean it. It's not something to, to even defend. It's because it was like week two of the Burdis fat stuff and I was like, eh. It's like, you know like we have like inside jokes and you're like, I'm not really going to do it. And you started to go bird is still fat and you started to tweak that and Hashtag it and you started to say it, man.

Speaker 7:          01:16:11       I'm trying to be the quiet driving because you took so much joy in this. I know. I just, I don't think it's something to be ashamed of. I think you deserve the credit. Thank you. I appreciate you giving me credit. I feel like I did have, I feel like you're not given credit on it and you deserve present on it. Thank you. I appreciate you acknowledging me in this whole debate and I can't wait for Bert to a really rad. I want him to fully get at some point that you're driving and I like to do. People don't realize that you're also 10 you're friends with him, you know what I mean? You've known him a long on their vacations with them. We've loved the crisis for many years, but I like to, I'm always the kind of shit mixer that does it from behind the scenes. I like to Shit Max behind and then watch it on fault. Yeah, like an evil. But even on those trips now I'm thinking about it. Even when we went to Hawaii with them for that show, that whole trip,

Speaker 6:          01:17:10       you and I and his wife were like, Hey Bert, why don't you close your mouth?

Speaker 5:          01:17:16       Yes.

Speaker 6:          01:17:17       Yeah. Yeah. Why is it so much fun to shit on Bert? Ah, Nice. Because you know there's something about, you know, he can take it and you know he likes basically any type of attention. That's true. So that's why it's not like somebody who can't roll with it. Right. If you were really devastated, we would never do this to him. No. No. And he'll be like, this really stinks. I like can he goes, do you see the videos that a blue band put together if you guys yeah. You haven't seen those yet? Oh my God. It's so funny cause he's like, all right.

Speaker 5:          01:17:56       Yeah, me,

Speaker 6:          01:18:04       it's so wordy. I think maybe that's the joy of it too, is that he's like, yes. Yeah. Actually, cause I saw the video you guys did where you're both shirtless and talking. Yeah. And he's holy looks a fat or is he actually, in all honesty, I don't, I really wouldn't know outside of those videos what the actual, yeah. You know, percentages would come down to, but he looks horrible is in his fat shaming video. He looks like he just got off a bender and he's like, yeah. He's like, I'm so fat dude is really great that he sent those in who's trying to do some lighting tricks. Yeah. Yeah. Was he trying to like gas some shadows on his shoulders and stuff? I picked up ah, to make them appear thinner or more muscular. Oh, how funny. It was great. He didn't, yeah, he was really a great, great sport through this whole thing.

Speaker 6:          01:19:01       Yeah. He's great I think. But I think the way he's built, yeah, it, it, it, it, the fat stays on, we say this like it sticks to him. Right. And it's super fat the way that he's built. I'm saying it's more apparent if he has weight gain as well. Yeah. How he gains weight. I think maybe he looks, if he gains five pounds, it looks funky. Put on 20 pounds. Yes. Because of where it hangs kind of thing. You actually is very fortunate though. He does have that such an animal or you can just cut out booze for a week. He'll be losing 20 pounds. That's the whole key to this is that Burt can stop being fat. If he stops drinking for a week. It's, I know. That's all it is. Will he's going to do it. He got so, uh, psychologically damaged by this, that watch. The next time you see him you were going to be like, oh my God. Did you lose 30 pounds? You'll be like, kid, it's been four days. Drink four days. Right for you now or is it thinned down? Yeah. You know, it's so funny. I just remember like Leanne stories about what an animal live at. Like he's such an animal. Do you know that he works out and then he just hoses himself off and

Speaker 8:          01:20:08       back backyard

Speaker 6:          01:20:10       behind his man cave. He has like an outdoor, he calls it an outdoor shower, but I think he just hoses himself down instead of showering. Is that really surprise you? A little. A little. And then when he, Leann said when he cuts his nails, remember this, he puts out scotch tape and then he puts the nail clippings on the scotch tape and then tapes it under the table. He's a real animal. I wanted to read you this, but for so grow how much free time, how does he have that much free time? He's got two kids who's got that kind of town was Bertrand or Leanne.

Speaker 8:          01:20:51       There are a lot of pronouns out there like and bird mount. And we're like, people were like slowly and slowly adding more. So the two most common ones are she and she, he has is traditionally considered a male pronoun. You cannot see another female. Um, so, um, now, so then they're also gender neutral meanings attached to them at all, which is super cool. Um, and there are so many of them. The most commonly used is they, they is traditionally plural. Commonly used is they, they answered a plural, but we already used in the singular form to like maintain people's anonymity here. Like if you just don't know what their gender is, you'll be like, oh, I was talking to a student and they told me Blah, blah, blah. Totally normal. Next. Most common. I've seen a Z. Z can be spelled a bunch of different ways and it can,

Speaker 6:          01:21:40       okay, you get it right. So can I say something before we go into the c minor you're going to read is because, yeah, it is great. And the thing is, is I, I was thinking about this guy's video all week. I was thinking about him and what if I did, because I do come across people whose gender I'm not certain of, but I think it's more rude to be like, hey man, what are you, what's your pronoun, Bro? Are you a guy or girl? Like that seems more insensitive than just rolling with who the person is and being like, listen, when you're ready to tell me, you'll tell me. I think it should be on the person who is, if they have a strong desire to have a pronoun, a different of whatever. Cause I, there are people that I come in contact with weekly. I would say the comedy clubs, I don't know exactly what they are and I just shut the fuck up about and I'm nice to them.

Speaker 6:          01:22:33       Of course. I, you know, look, just be now just fucking, yeah, be by an email. We got it says Trans Mommy on gender pronouns. Here we go. Okay. Okay, good. Hey, mommy's big fan. I'm a 27 year old transgender woman who would like to help weigh in on the whole pronoun issue. Thank God no, we've been wanting to see Emily personally. I think going beyond he or she pronouns is a bit ridiculous. I mean, get your life. It's not hard to tell if someone would like to be referred to as he or she. And it isn't hard to respect that.

Speaker 7:          01:23:06       Of course. I'm a bit offended when I'm mis-gendered because I'm obviously living life as a woman. That makes total sense. I mean, my jeans nowaday are the highest and Titus probably the best plus for being both a trans and a full on mommy. So don't feel obligated to call someone they because I mean, come on, it's a bit much. Thank you. Although I respect it because who am I to judge anyway? Just my thought. Ps, you're both real mommy's tummy. But Tommy is clearly the water champ. Rude Hashtag [inaudible] so fat with much love. I know what I'm saying, Ricky. Thank you Ricky. But it's nice that a trans person weighed in on gender. Now of course the, there's somebody who's going to hear this and be like, yeah, but what if you're not male or female?

Speaker 6:          01:23:58       But you can tell that that's also part of the thing. Sometimes you can tell it's somebody who is a male and he was presenting as a female. You can tell that sometimes if they're wearing a dress, but maybe he looks you now it looks like a masculine guy and address then you know, to call that person. Is she because she was presenting,

Speaker 7:          01:24:17       you know, feminine. Yeah. And you know, a couple of emails here about, um, about the water battle. Um, I had a chance to see the main mommy and San Diego Friday night aside from the retarded person in the front row and he killed it about halfway through the show.

Speaker 6:          01:24:33       Good. Retarded. It's, I'm telling you if your act finally doing it,

Speaker 7:          01:24:37       I noticed something curious. So halfway through the show I notice something, something curious. Town's water was completely full. The cap seal had clearly been broken. Okay. No. And um, and I know I saw him bring the bottle up to his mouth at one point. Just led me to believe he was taking a Yorkie sips and I was hurt. However, someone in the crowd yelled out, hydrate and like the champ of drinking water, he is bullshit. He managed to take two magnificent gulps, nearly emptying the bottle. Sorry Mommy. Tina, you can't win against natural talent like that. Great Show Tom. Thank you very much. And thank you to everybody that came out to the American comedy company in San Diego, in the Gaslamp district. I had a great time in manly. A whole, yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:25:24       Yes. Now, don't you think a water champ does it need to be prompted by the audience? Someone needed to scream, hi Tracy.

Speaker 7:          01:25:34       You know what I did for one show? I walked out, I dawn Staley, she said, I don't want him on my entrance. Open the bottle and did it and the outlet, drink, drink, drink, drink and I know that other people, they were like, why are they chug and so silly. And then I threw the bottle and I was like, yeah. And then I had it

Speaker 6:          01:25:53       full water belly for a whole show. That's so gross. Can I tell you somebody left a water bottle at our house. One of our relatives, unreal and I have been using it all week. It's a little car and it is fantastic. I think it's for bicycling. It's like a sports bottle with a nice nipple. It doesn't leak when you put the bottle or two options for that of WHO's who? Mario or her husband. Wow. It's my now who else drinks I done stole your water bottle. I love it. I've heard it seen so far. It's clear to me, Tom is the water champ lies. Propaganda. Just said there's a clip here and Tina takes microscopic sips of water. Bullshit. She doesn't hydrate enough. She only throws out Yorkie says

Speaker 1:          01:26:40       mmm.

Speaker 6:          01:26:42       Is it a clip of just set up? It's pretty. And by the way, where'd you find that? The way you send me. How'd you get ahold of yet? Yeah, there you go. You're coughing water. Cause I drink so much so fast. No, it was a tiny little sip. A tiny little sip. Both of you right now.

Speaker 1:          01:27:08       Hmm.

Speaker 6:          01:27:11       Yeah. Well there's a lot of, there's a lot more. It just basically says I'm the best or the worst. You know what I am the new champion of you and I discussed this a couple of weeks back, is that I am the alone champion. Meaning I can be alone much longer and better than you. No, it's true. I'm really good at being isolated and I love being alone. Even more abuse me of being the lone champion. You acute, you're like, you can just be a little, I want your company, I want you to be next to me. And somebody who's lie. That's not true. Don't we have a joke? Even when I want to be in a lone dog? What's our joke when I'm in a lone dog, what do I do? I go up to the window and I, Babe, you're always telling me, you're telling me that you feel like it doesn't even matter to me if I'm with anybody ever and that you want company antisocial, you're just anti so I'm just meaning like your like top dog where it doesn't matter if people talk to you or not because you're just too, but I'm the lone champion.

Speaker 6:          01:28:14       I'm the alone champion. You guys know what to do. I'm way better at solid. I grew up alone. I'm an only child. I hid from my parents my whole life. I would say it's not even close. I'm the lone champion. You're not even in the top 10 we'll see about that. Let's go on a meditation retreat and see who can last longer. 25 years. You can't even meditate. You don't meditate. Bullshit. Bullshit. When's the last time I did the fucking last week I went to my class with all the hippies.

All the juggle a family does is sometimes they care around act. Y'All understand what they're saying about murder? I've don't like cops. As a police officer get into my face, it probably be me yelling right back into his face.

Speaker 6:          01:29:34       I can a waiver Ellis never. This is, this is called Bitch posey rules. No, this is called shitty parenting. This is the only way. Yeah. I mean, yeah, you left. This should happen. This should just doesn't happen. This could have been me. You know what I'm saying? This was my shitty parents. You got to fuck a lot. All kinds of stuff on. You got to neglect the shit out of a case of your kid that you think it's your parents that made you go down that path. There's no reason the kid turns goth unless there's a lot of other stuff happening. You know what I mean? You don't get golf in a vacuum. You were goth as a, as a means of acting out, of course, because they're ignoring me and whatever drama, and then you hang out with the wrong kids, drift into bad groups whose parents aren't paying attention to them. And then next thing you know you're paying your face and go into fucking dumb concerts. I got fat.

Speaker 12:         01:30:29       I used to be scared of everything. I usually chop their heads off.

Speaker 12:         01:31:08       I run away, am disrespectful. I do not like being told what to do. I got into this one really serious by and grabbed her by the neck and slander down on the ground. Well, it felt pretty good.

Speaker 6:          01:31:22       Yeah. Well, you're angry. This is my favorite by the way. Like in the nineties too, when kids were bad and on Jerry Springer and then they try to use tough love against the kid who's already like fucked at home. Why are you so bad? It's like, well, because your parents suck. Why do you think they're so bad? It's not their fault. Unreal. Yikes. I'm sorry Kiddo. I'd adopt you if I could. We've got to go. Anything else new to throw in there? No, I love you and I'm the lone champion. I love you buy jeans.
