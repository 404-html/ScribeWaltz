Speaker 2:          00:06:44       they, that it was edited where they didn't have the beginning of it. That's why it's so,

Speaker 5:          00:06:48       no, I don't understand. When he says wearing the same shit you got on and said Fuck you, what does that have to do with anything? He's implying that they put on pads in a uniform like you did. Oh, you know, this whole time I just thought it meant like that guy shops at the same place you do fuck him. Like it just like he was style psyching me. Like you went to the Grammy's or whatever in the same outfit,

Speaker 2:          00:07:09       put on what you put on shoulder, show up, all that stuff. Yeah. And then they said, fuck you. What are you going to do about it? Interesting. It's probably the greatest pregame speech I've ever heard in my life. Yeah. Yeah. My coach never said Shit like that. One time my coach told us a story about these neighborhood boys. Yeah. That were fucking with his, one of his brothers. And that his dad told my coach at the time, who was a, a young man, that they, that him and his brother should go over there and kicked the kid's ass. That was his pregame speech. He got real emotion. And then, so that was to motivate you to go kick their ass, the other teams? Yeah, it was, um, but I'd never seen them get so emotional. It was interesting. I really, really liked it, but I would have liked this much more. Yeah. Yeah. I would have to, I prefer Cochise is my coach. I mean, if I was 15 or 16 and I heard that speech a, I'm either hysterically laughing and biting my own tongue to not get murdered by him. Yeah. Or I'm so scared shitless of him that, you know, we're ready to go out there.

Speaker 5:          00:08:15       See, I think you and I grew up a vastly different in that I heard inappropriate things yelled constantly so that, that was my norm.

Speaker 2:          00:08:23       Yeah. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:08:25       I don't know. I don't, I remember one time Diante the, I had the, the driving instructor, Mr Cou, I shouldn't say his name. He was actually the PE teacher and he taught his driver's Ed and he would tell us about the bikers and the street. Yeah. These, uh, faggots on their bicycles were in their faggy bike shorts. You don't want to fucking hit these guys cause then you get sued. Mr [inaudible] laugh or no, no, cause back. No, my friend Shauna and I did cause we were like that's a rad and this guy when we laugh or like, yeah, no Sean,

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       I are both like this guy's the best. I'm going to come every weekend. Cause it was like the funniest thing here. A Guy Freak, Alec that you know, um, no one else. No, I think there's a, it was all girls school you went to. So it was all girls in the class and there weren't like fun. They don't have the personalities that I have the personality and I have this girl's got personnel. It's something she's got neat, uh, tats till. Yeah. So she did this on Facebook. Um, that's, this is what it comes. She calls it a come run, which is uh, you know, basically running to the bathroom after sex after I got Jesus in you. Yeah, I've done that before. Did you always call it a come run? Never had had a name for it. Well the common wrong, unless you used a condom and let's face it then you get to experience the km run past to be the biggest sexual struggle.

Speaker 2:          00:09:56       Wow. What is it? No one talks about it. Like this is the big dilemma of, of our era of this age of living and come run and no one talks about it cause it's not that big of a deal. I Dunno. I Dunno also who the fuck? Where's condoms? Oh No, I think it's more the alias queers. Um, a few people where he talks about the camera and is your sister Maria? Yeah, I remember one time just like Jeff and od come pouring out of me for like days. She always has talked like that and has always been so descriptive and it's always upsetting. Cause like I know when I got pregnant because like Jeff and I had sex like four days before I've deleted and then like the Campbell's dripping out. Oh my God, you guys are so disgusting. It's really foul and I wish you didn't talk like that.

Speaker 2:          00:10:48       I mean, yeah, the camera is not fun, but it's not the biggest sexual, oh my God. Seriously. I honestly, and I don't have it so I don't know, but I feel like, but sex would be the the most embarrassing slash well let's, why don't we dive a little deeper into this topic that's being ignored by the masses, I suppose. That fucking tissue. Yeah. What the fuck is that going to to a tissue and fucking stick tonight. It's going to help me for my shy pepper. Masha Masha, she sold down there. I mean they're Downton Abbey cast wipe up their come. They never, they never did, but she's right. They never explored that. It's like this big elephant in the room that no one's talking about. We come run down now. Be have been a perfect series. There's calm all over my legs right now. Which sort of limit lady. My lady allow me to lap it up. Carson was a com lapper cheers. Run right into my mouth. Carson would do that for the family. Yeah. He loved lady. Is that come dripping from Carson? Uh Oh. Where did that go? Why did that,

Speaker 3:          00:12:14       anyway, I have mastered the comradery, but this is what I personally do is coming over. So you need to prep the room for two towels next to easy access. One for you. One for the bed. Yeah. Designing. No fucking white patch.

Speaker 2:          00:12:30       Smart. So far so good. I'm also a big tower fan. Yeah, I know. I like towels. You don't like him? No, you're the first gentleman. Well let's be real. I so many guys talk about, no, let's, let's be real. It wasn't always a towel with you. It was shirts for awhile. Socks. He got a stiff Dick. You'd like handmade. You hand me like wet, like not wet white tee shirts and stuff. And I'm like David towl Tom. Yeah. And then I think I got into towels. Oh man, I got towels. I like towels. I liked how it was too. But then you're saying I evolved into towels. It didn't start at towels. That's fair.

Speaker 3:          00:13:25       Between the legs, legs crossed. Oh, never got sort of hot and wobble to the bathroom. [inaudible] do you set on that toilet for

Speaker 2:          00:13:38       interesting. This chick's asking all the important question she saying how long do you wait for that just spill out? Well, I mean as long as it takes well but, but no, but think about it. When do you say that's it? You give a good push, you know, push and then after that, you know, so that it's a legit question though. Yeah. Cause you could sit there and then maybe a few minutes later a little more falls out. Yeah, I get that ges out. Yeah. I'm so glad she shared this on Facebook and on the internets and a lot of family members of hers probably up Facebook too. This is a good thing to have

Speaker 3:          00:14:20       you fucking hear. So would you sat by you scraped? What? You can wait, wait, come still coming out. Oh my God. Master vaccines. What the fuck did she just say? Nine Times out of 10, nine times five scraped what you can out. I'm still coming out. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:14:39       we scraped, but you can stand up. Come still coming out of you. Sure, sure. It's nice. Maybe. Maybe granny saw this video. That'd be nice for her to see too. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:14:47       How far are you scraped? What you can out? I'm still out. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       come so come here. Yeah, I, she's scraping. I wouldn't scrape my badge for that. Geeze, you're little that come stay up there though. You know, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:15:02       Oh,

Speaker 2:          00:15:09       dude's sound like they're shitting, uh, of then go get in the shower because there is no lie. I'm with him. Come inside and they call me [inaudible]. Yeah. What, what's she talking about? Going to the bathrooms. Look at the next thing I'm doing is getting in the shower cause I'm not going to get back in bed with calm. All these come inside of me. Yeah. Okay. So she was a nice shower fan.

Speaker 3:          00:15:34       Yeah. Back in the bedroom that coming in, get your likes open. Don't really want to fuck you and you father. He's not let that bad. You ain't going to change yourself yet mate. And I'm know I'll come multiple times over that penis.

Speaker 2:          00:15:50       Hm. Interesting point. So what she's saying is she gets out of the bathroom back into bed with some of these dudes. They're like, listen, let's give it another go. And she's like, you're still, you're still nasty. You have a clean up. I've, I've come on you. Why don't you clean up? I'm cleaning up. Why don't you clean up? Sure. You know, equal rights, equal rights. I respect the lady for making that very valid point.

Speaker 3:          00:16:15       And I also know you're a batter. Dip Your fucking Dick back inside me. Am I still got remains? If you're calm and then expect me to fucking suck it off my, so I'll just finish up. Let me do to come run. Let me have a shower. You jump in the shower. Fuck me in the shower. Cleaning each other in the shower. Done.

Speaker 2:          00:16:34       Wow. This chick's got it all figured out. Yeah, I really, I really like her. I admire her too. I like the, uh, amount of energy and the thought she's put into this, the time it takes to make a video. Also the, I realize that within this video she brought up an issue and it came to a resolution. Interesting. She solved the dilemma. She offered a solution, a constructive solution. Just guts. Go to the shower then we can do it all there.

Speaker 3:          00:16:57       When I met around when you saw him, did you do to come on. It never seems to get any less. It is a sense of fucking embarrassment. Comey fuck him a about with a fucking towel would turn your legs in fucking Paul move. You started. Where did I put it? The fucking copy up there should definitely just fucking swallow the con instead.

Speaker 2:          00:17:21       Another good. Oh, there's an interesting resolution to the problem and see how she said to her it would be a practical solution to swallow the km. The km run. Yeah. Just put it in there. Yeah. And then, uh, wouldn't that be a treat for, you know, I don't, I think I'd rather, and she's not doing it to the cloud run leisure. Yeah. That's the best part is it? She's like, look, the easiest thing is just right here. I just swallow it. Yeah. Then one of to clean up, then guys were like, oh, this makes a lot of sense.

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       Yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't think about that. She really hates to come run that much. Well, I'm sure the camera, I don't know about. I mean personally, not that big of a deal to me, but to some people that's a big deal. How often are you getting comed in? Maybe that's her. That's a big thing for her. What if she's, I mean, she doesn't seem like she doesn't do it a lot. Right. Right. And how many different dudes? We don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. No condoms too. She's in that no condom life. She's like, who does that? A condom. In other words, one big fucking bowl like that. We all have to go and don't fucking wanted a bowling ball. A curve ball.

Speaker 2:          00:18:28       One big fucking boat. Egg. Wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow. Classy girl. I liked her. I really like her. Um, yeah, she's called a Chav. Right? Is that a Chav? I don't know. I'm not sure in England. Um, speaking of British slang, there's a guy, a Brit who teaches you how to speak like a roadman is the video up? We got it sent. That's a roadman heroes.

Speaker 5:          00:19:01       Gonna go check in on those with Amanda. That was bad. Jokes bled Aircrafts are say farm. The Bay farm. You're ate my chicken nuggets in it. You so bait fab. You might might say hello everyone does this belly today I'm going to talk about roadman. Dallet was in London. They're going to talk about London street slang words or so called roadman darling. It was, I liked London street slang. Yeah. And he has,

Speaker 2:          00:19:28       he's English as a second language even though he speaks fluent English. Right. Cause there's a, you can tell that his accent is there, but he's also, you know, he's trying to become a master of accidents, which is rad. Yeah. So he's teaching people, um, Road Rodman.

Speaker 5:          00:19:42       Is that like cab drivers roadmap? I don't know. The knowledge, knowledge, knowledge isn't that way. What's, what's the the car, what does it Cockney what is it? The Co, yeah, that's when they're real low class. He taught? Is that what Roadman is now? He said, well it's London street and that's called roadmap. I'm assuming the road man being like a Cabbie or something made me just, all right. English people. Collar Guy, right in. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Learned his reasoning is the first one is mandarin man's London means mate my and it usually means male friend. Manda Mandarin sometimes means I grew up off friends as well. Jesus. Well then this is, it reminds me of that girl who was like a Coca Cola. Remember that? The you don't remember that are cocky kind of, I remember that. Yeah, I did. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:20:30       like a gimme. I want a cock. It was a Korean lady I think, and she was teaching people, uh, friends, English. Mike. Mike, yeah. That was the, we played it long

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       time ago. But it's so crazy.

Speaker 6:          00:20:50       This is the same language. Skim it.

Speaker 5:          00:21:13       Yes. We do have car and this guy, so Amanda, I'd never knew this shit. Here I am, you know, teaching people how to learn different dialects. People hire me. They hear that. I do that. When they reach out and they say consultant for accents and you know, a lot of CEOS have been contacting all kinds of people, athletes, actors, um, artists, all kinds of people in government, senators, congressmen, yeah. You know that the incoming administration reached out. They said, well how are we supposed to do this without your help? I'm already no man data. When someone says like, oh, Munda this person is calling a friend. Or Amanda can also use the word pled or farm boy blood. We know that we know blood and Fam. Fun, fun, fun, awesome. On my blood. What happened in that much black?

Speaker 5:          00:22:18       Jeez, that took so long because these chairs are not conducive. Why don't you treat me like that? Really? So you're going to say that you're the one blood thumb. You've been treating me like I'm a 10 year old boy, but you treat me like I'm a 10 year old boy the other day. The other day you don't treat me like a wife is what I mean? Like what would a woman who you're sexually attracted to you treat me like a 10 year old boy the other day. You Go, let me, let me check your di Di is it brown in there and then you pulled my underwear and then you went to sniff my, but like we do with Ellis. Yeah. You fart in front of me. Constant. That was affectionate. You don't think of me like as a woman, you think of me, you treat me like a 10 year old boy.

Speaker 5:          00:23:05       You call me my boobies. Mushy purples and saugers and sloppers. Hold on, I made a list of things that you do that um, indicate that. Oh you go, you go, oh you have chocolate down there. Cause I saw your, I saw your bare butt cheeks and I thought you had some chocolate that you smear it on there. Yeah. But most husbands don't treat their wives like boys. They certainly don't ask to sniff their diaper and they don't tell them they have chocolate on their butt holes and stuff. Well I sniffed your diaper. Yeah. As a form of affection. But also if it was full, I was going to help you change your diaper. Oh my God. Oh my God. And there's a lot of demeaning staff were like side meet Mommy. Remember when he said that? I'll see how you laugh already at that one.

Speaker 5:          00:23:52       Remember side meet Mommy. I was laying, I was laying in bed with you. Yeah. And I put my arm around. We were spooning. I was the little spoon. Oh, here you are. And then I pretended I was you. And I went, I'm side meet Mommy. And I left. It was just so not all you did. You grabbed my, my stomach meet as you said it. You squish it and then you go, I'm citing me mommy. That's the real game. That was years ago. I know. That's the first to know. What's funny is that, you know, cause we called them hangers and sloppers and bushy purples and everything. One of my buddies goes, uh, he goes, oh I was, he was with his girlfriend, his girlfriend for years. And he goes, you know, I liked this big sloppers. And she goes, what did you just say?

Speaker 5:          00:24:40       I liked those lockers. And she goes, what does that, he goes, oh, it's just something that, um, that I heard on a podcast. And she goes, I don't like that and I don't want you to say that to me ever again. And he goes, okay, let's see. That's the appropriate response for something like that. And that's what I should have said to you 10 years ago when you started on this kick with side me, mommy and sniffing my diaper. The thing is I didn't have the self respect or the self confidence to do that and you know, really. So you think it was a matter of self confidence and that I was raised by a single father who had treated a lack of respect. Really? Yeah. If I, if I, if I were more of a woman, like a womanly woman, the fact is I was raised by my single father and half by my mom and my dad treated me like a 10 year old boy.

Speaker 5:          00:25:32       So I think in some ways it's familiar and it's funny to me. What are you saying you really want it to change? No, I'm just pointing out the obvious. I mean I love you. I've been with you for 12 years for a reason cause it fits. It's a, it's like a hand in glove at this point, you know? No I just noticed it cause cause you told me that story and I was like yeah there's no woman, not a lot of women which always every other week now you go, you realize no other woman can be with you. And I'm like wait what? And you're like no woman would tolerate, tolerate you pulling their underwear, sniff your diaper or led on your butt hall and stuff. Maybe your farts and you know you fart a lot cause I was raised like a 10 year old boy. All right, look, let's take a look out on example sentence example. I'm going to get some those chicken with my friend. Loved man.

Speaker 5:          00:26:25       Wait a minute. Yeah. Cheeky man. Why is Nando's cheeky going to go to chicken out of your mind them God get a cheeky Nando's. What the fuck? Ah Man. Usually me snot cupboard, right, right. Bunching. Roadman dialect. Bad Means Berry or a lot didn't know that bear means very or a lot there. You have bear mushy saugers paint a lot of them. You've got 10 times the amount of tickets most people have. See if I were a woman, if I acted like a girl, but how it bothered me. Didn't those numbers handy lately? Yeah. Actually, thank you for bringing that up because I went to get a Mammogram, which you should obviously at 40. They tell you to go to it saying we should, uh, highly recommend go do it. It's not that big of a deal, man. Get your prostate exam. Yeah. It's not a big deal, but I was thankful for my mushy, mushy purples because they squish them in like a vice, like a glass of ice to, you know, Lou, whatever, x ray them and my, my tits before I had a kid. It would have been very sensitive and painful, but the blessing in the skies is that they're all deflated. A mushy. Yeah. It didn't even hurt. I didn't even feel it really. It was great. Yeah. So it's a good thing that I had these big mushy purples now. Yeah. Yeah. Mushy, mushy, mushy. He says mushy. I say mushy. Mushy. Mushy.

Speaker 5:          00:28:03       Mushy. Purple Bear. Also when something is very funny, people sometimes say bad jokes for example. And that was very funny mate.

I just got another, some lady is stealing people's points, said he has and then there's like an update on is a screen grab of it. Um, El Chapo, El Chapo by Eddie. Uh, Bojangles for that instrumental. Thank you very much. You can always send your songs or your instrumentals to your mom's podcast@gmail.com. There's no house in the email. Address your mom's podcasts@gmail.com genes. Uh, we put it out there last week. Um, obviously there's a big dispute between the two of us up who's the real personality change and people wrote in and uh, here's what they're saying. Oh, okay.

Speaker 2:          00:36:32       Now what people are thinking about this. Mommy, Tina thinks she is the personality champ. Just like how she thinks. She went to a dentist at one time and the Dolans told her to Dennis lawyer. She had 67 of cavities. Tom Is the main mommy, the water champ, the weight loss champ. And know that personality. Champs. Sorry. Tina Dylan. Thanks Dylan. Next email. As a professional. Mommy, this is no fucking contest. Hands down the personality champ is mommy. Tina, why? Well, having been to every live podcast and hanging up before and after the shows with the two mommy, Tina is always excited and truly happy to see my bear and I, she goes out of her way to ask us how we are and gives massive hugs, which I know she hates what she does it. Anyway, that's called a warm personality. Uh, meanwhile buns gives a head nod, Woo Hoo and side hugs with a look that reads. He'd rather be anywhere. But there now I have more. We have seen the mommy's separate. Stand up so many times. I can't count mommy. Tina without fail acknowledges us. Wow. And honestly, heres how we are. The hugs, oh, the hugs, pure warmth and love. Tommy on the hand has never once recognized us or put him in any sort of conversation. When we have talked forced, I might add, his vibe is one of coldness and boredom.

Speaker 2:          00:38:02       We almost feel embarrassed for having put him through the torture. Now maybe we've caught buns on off days. Every single time we've seen him. Who knows? But there has never been a time when we didn't feel real love from Mommy, Tina. That's how you become a personality champ. People. Let's see if bonds can change our minds at the Irvine live podcasts. My hopes are high, but only because I know the true personality channel delightfully shine like always real mommy forever at Jean's higher than my eyeballs. Leah, Leah, I know Leah. Leah d'oeuvres. I have no last name. Derbs on Instagram. I like her photos. I like to be intimate with our fans. Thank you. Hey Hitler. Let me start by saying I'm a Puerto Rican male and yes, big Moshi purples and blond hair definitely do not make my dick soft. Oh, thanks. But with that bias being addressed, I must say that Jean has a way better personality.

Speaker 2:          00:39:02       You can tell that Tom will be unbearable for long periods of time. Time Tom, maybe better at first glance that it was only because he is around. He is fake around people. Right. I am also a fake person in public, so I say this as someone who can relate to Tom. Gene on the other hand seems to always act like herself, no matter where she is. The difference between the two can be seen on many podcasts that they have been on. So with this being said, I can only imagine the real times to grow up being way worser. Gene has the better personality and I will bet my life on it. Psi had been a fan of the show since episode 50. Thank you for all the laughs. Uh, they always remind me to pull my jeans high and tight. Tyson, he does a very thorough assessment.

Speaker 2:          00:39:48       Yeah, that guy really put a lot of thought it up here. I'm sure you're going to read. You don't worries now. Uh, that's, I don't know where I was coming in from. Um, gene, the real truth is, Tom is care. Charismatic and compassionate has never been a more clearly composed dialogue from an individual, was such talent. He has friends everywhere. Every individual I talked to you about it agrees men want to be him and women went to be with him. Oh Wow. Christina has a personality dud. A really sweet person, but not someone you'd want to start a conversation with that I think people would definitely want.

Speaker 2:          00:40:26       I think people would definitely want to interact with her if it had the chance to see Tom probably from a distance. Tom is obviously the personality and water champion. Christopher so funny about these. Um, these emails is that they're serious. That's the part. They're really actually, because you know how other things are like toms water champ because of the, you know, the arcade. It's nonsensical, but people are really taking this to heart. This debate, this nonsensical to me. So great. Hey, a was one more here. Hey genes. Clearly, purple genes gets overwhelmed by your water champion status. She feels the need to challenge the fact you are also the personality champion. Her voice cracks face gets red and her mannerisms present. Clear anxiety. I mean, come on. When you drink so much water, you feel so much better and therefore ra better person to be around that many factors as to why the the undisputed personality champ.

Speaker 2:          00:41:24       It's okay though. Let Purple Jeans. No, she's married to a great role model. Half the battle is knowing the path to take. Thank God, after your efforts to lose so much weight and become the weight loss champion, she has no choice to be filled with motivation and become a better person all around. Thank you. Stay safe. Mom is best. A sincere, my face does not turn red. This is my face. Turn red. I think when you're faced with the reality of your personality, this is my face. Turn red. I wouldn't know. I don't see myself. You see me all the time. I don't see color. I don't even know when a black person walks in there. Well that's true. You don't see colors. You're colorblind in. Yeah. It's a personality flaw. Yeah. It's total personality flaw. Um, how people are really weighing in on this. Yeah. I mean, I don't know if serious debate.

Speaker 2:          00:42:14       It seems like it's settled that I am the winter, but you know, we'll see. We'll see. Time will tell. So Ali, uh, who used to use his real life, I don't even remember, starts with an m, then became all these hymns are right and now he's all the z's or Zinzer and he's producing some really great, great songs for us. Um, you know, if you, if you're familiar with the show, you go back through the catalog, especially in within the last, I would say 50 episodes. He's really hit some home runs. He created a mix, a song that's a, a remix where he used king ass rappers farts to make a song. I have always a big fan of these farts actually made to, that is the bread and gosh, the bread and butter over. Yeah. So let's see here. I haven't really had a chance to hear it, so let's hear. Let's hear it for sure. Thank you Ali. [inaudible] for the fart master. Um, let's see how he titled it. Fart sounds only the mommy mix. Here we go. He always has a nice build up to this. Yeah. Was exciting.

Speaker 8:          00:43:40       Quiet

Speaker 2:          00:43:47       parts too.

Speaker 8:          00:44:17       Wow. Very talented. I mean, I feel like two of the

Speaker 2:          00:44:45       wow to come from the show. Thank you. Obviously King asked Trevor, discovering him, but then Ali together, that's magic right there. It is. And what I just imagine putting it together and studios and to all those farmers are farming. You have to think of the Fart as an instrument at that point and be like, where? What pitch is that hitting could make? And his girlfriend walking in and being like, what are you working on? And he's like, ah, I gotta finish this song. So I was doing this one. So let's say that dogs are getting hungry. Oh he wrote an email and he did. I think I did. I did myself with this one. Agreed. I made an entire song only using fart sounds. All of that was far too. Everything from the drums to the melody is 100% sports. Then I think you guys will be proud. I've came a long way in the first couple of beats. I think I might have changed the game forever. I think you'd love you. Mommy's all these e's are Zim Zur. Yeah. You really, I didn't realize that was all either. That's what I was asking. Like the beats and all farts. Talent. What a talent. Yeah, time. Well spent. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          00:46:06       That's a really impressive man. Really, really something. It's like that is that ob one who pieced together Theo's jam. Hundreds bought and he pieced together all the time. Steel was on the show. That's right and made a rap out of it. That was just wild. You remember last week, right? Do I remember it? Yeah. I've only been thinking about it all week. Somebody wrote in a McAfee related story. Paige jeans. When I was a 30 year old student in Nyc, I knew a generous older guy that had a fancy version of this chair. It had a glass window that could slide in and out about four inches below the seat. He used to lay on his back and watch me push out steaming turds onto the glass for 250 bucks a session. Hold on. Hey Man, who come around, sit down and dump. Once the dump was done, I would get up, dress and leave and he would play with the deposit.

Speaker 2:          00:47:07       Now I know. Now I know a story of somebody on a reality show that I was friends with acquaintances with. I remember you told me this story that he would go to this man's house and the man would leave a plot, a brown paper sack on the counter, and this person would have to shit into the sack and then leave it and there was money on the counter. Wow. That's really, yeah. $250 is not nothing to sneeze at. Well, especially if you're a grad student or an Undergrad. I would say that's, that's a really good price for that. I mean, you start talking about the costs of, you know, your tuition, your books, your housing. Imagine if that guy's like, just do it once a week or twice a week. It'd be 500 bucks a week. And for some you do for free twice a day.

Speaker 9:          00:47:54       Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:47:57       Could you imagine a money? There was a couple that came to a show that works in the adult entertainment business. Yeah. And, uh, the girls told me that a guy made that request one time, a fan did of her. They do, like they're, they're a married couple, but they do like online videos and they sell. So one of the fans was like, I want you to mail me like a dump, you know? And she was like, yeah, she's like, I'm not doing that. And he's like, ah, it would, he, he offered two or $3,000. Wow. So she said yes, but he, he was like, but I want you to eat this, this and this specifically. And I go, did you stick to the Diet? She goes, yeah, absolutely. Because you know, he seemed to really, and he's going to know because obviously he's thought this out enough that he has requests.

Speaker 2:          00:48:43       So she ate what he wanted him or what was it? What was it that she ate? Oh. Oh, wow. But he, she was like, I ate it for like two days. She nailed it, send it off. And how do you mail a dump though? Uh, I didn't get into it, but I would imagine pretty, pretty well sealed. A couple layers of ceiling, old FedEx. We'll FedEx. You can't tell them what's in it. I don't think they'd be happy about it. I don't think so. Yeah, send it. I guess you'd have to do regular old fashioned, I mean you could watch Siki just you put it in several packages. Think about it. He put it in Tupperware. Let's think about this. He's dumped in your Tupperware tub or the kind that I have, right? The labs over. Yeah. Okay. You put that into a, maybe you put a wrap around that too. Like Saran wrap or gallon bag. Like a Ziploc gallon bag and you put that Tupperware wrapped. Yep.

Speaker 9:          00:49:33       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:49:33       Uh, in, in a box and you, you see all that box up, sit in right in the box, and then you put that box in a second box. So that will prevent the smell because it's going to smell very bad. It's going to smell like someone took a shit. Yeah. It's not going to be good. Especially if it's hot. If it's a summertime mailing, realize that that box gets to this guy's house. He opens it and right away.

Speaker 4:          00:50:01       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:50:07       This is fantasy. It's Christmas for him. Yeah, that's it. That's all he's ever done. It. It's so crazy. Now, did you have time this week? I know you're very busy. Yeah. Did you have time this week to run your finger on your crack? Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:50:26       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:50:31       That was like a question. I know that wasn't even a fight. I couldn't tell him that was what I was bad. It's like your first always smiling. God No, you didn't answer my question. I know you had a busy week. Yeah. Did you have a moment and your busy day to run your finger along your crack? Don't put it in your asshole, but just along the crack to smell your own. Smell your fingers. Yeah. Yeah. I um, I did and I uh, I feel, feel much better about it. Have you learned your own smell? You know that guy is so God damn ridiculous. Stupid. He's just

Speaker 10:         00:51:14       smell what? You're not smell like a different times of the day.

Speaker 2:          00:51:17       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:51:18       Run your finger along the crack of your ass. You don't need to finger your whole, you don't want to come back with shit on your finger.

Speaker 2:          00:51:25       Thank you. Yeah, but you want to snip. You want to sniff it, you know?

Speaker 10:         00:51:28       Oh burn. What's your ass smells like? What's your cock and balls smell like?

Speaker 2:          00:51:33       You got to learn that stuff because people don't know. We got an email this week. No, it's funny because the person is, is right on board with what we're talking about. Deer, Mommy's, I believe it was in episode three 67 where both pairs of jeans question whether people got into pup play to relieve sexual desires or just burn off some steam and a fun, harmless and nonsexual way that that is something that we highlighted last week. We showed you the TV documentaries. Like we're just having fun. Just a couple of lads and the latex. Exactly. Make sure you give yourself a phone. Don't have a phone. Um, so I have a phone photo. If you have a moment in the day as well. If you have a break, go to a cubicle. All the bathroom if you're not too busy.

Speaker 2:          00:52:27       I love that. It's like you can fit this into your schedule. Like a workout. Yeah. Take the stairs instead of the elevator please. Well he wrote, yeah. What you both a question that whether it's fun, harmless. It has to come to my attention. That pup play is almost 100% sexual. I've done some digging and boy, I sure did find a bone. You will see in exhibit a filled and sealed. Um, and then, and then with what is referred to as a tail in the pop world and the pop world or what sane people call it, butt plugs. Uh, Andrew, let's see. So he's 100% right. Andrew is right. And uh, this pup play. Oh, so here is a pop getting a tail at the vet.

Speaker 11:         00:53:28       Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh, vets. The vets like a normal bed. No, this doesn't look like our vet. She's, yeah, she's very different. Oh boy.

Speaker 2:          00:53:41       So right now the vet who's in a full laid text, uh, outfit and a mask, a just put the human pop on all fours on the table. I also, for this dog, his examination there appears to be handcuffs, Lube, and a butt plug on the table and a phone and the iPhone. Yeah,

Speaker 11:         00:54:02       no take taking, pick, steal. Someone's people know he's here. It's updates. You don't want me to use those two? No, no. We don't need those two weeks. Yeah. So the pump is a that

Speaker 2:          00:54:16       now that the vet is doing the right thing, keeping the pup relaxed, right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. He doesn't like the vet either. You got to keep petting him and be like, sorry buddy. It's all right. So, so far it does seem like a very thorough medical exam

Speaker 11:         00:54:31       and it's just, it's not sexual if you start like this, uh, thing to do. Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

Speaker 2:          00:54:45       oh. So the vet just opened what appears to be a zipper on the back of this dogs late. The human dogs lay texts, um, uniform. The poop shit. Yeah. And he said he's going to give that little little area an exam as they do to dogs. They do that to dogs, you know, they do. They put a thermometer in there and they express the anal glands. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         00:55:07       Fifth doesn't like it at all. You don't have a title? Good puppy. Oh good. Yeah. You push down on that if you think it's feels okay. Yeah. Good.

Speaker 2:          00:55:23       You can push down on that if you think it feels it's not sexual though. God. I wish people would stop stigmatizing us. Poor guy, or just people that look just like to wear latex and we'd just like to act like dogs. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         00:55:35       Oh

Speaker 11:         00:55:38       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:55:43       Now you and I had this debate in the car because we couldn't stop thinking about pup play in the Hammock is a which one is, is definitely sicker. Like what's what's, Oh yeah. What's, what's Weirder, I guess. You know what I mean? Yeah. I mean definitely. It's not good to be in the hammock world. Well, my argument is the hammock world, it's, it's one and done. It's like it's a short thing. The pup play. It's a, it's like you're taking a semester, you're taking classes, plays a lifestyle. Yeah. It's a whole thing. It's really, really good at dive in, but if somebody goes, I mean, here's the thing, what side of the Hammock are you on? That's all the difference in the world. Why I'm the one depositing? Yeah. That's your only $50 I need to make. Yeah. That, that's not that big of a deal, I guess.

Speaker 2:          00:56:31       Yeah. It's still just like a gross thing to be doing. That's horrible. Yeah. It's hard. It's hard and I don't even know if I could shit in front of another person. That's really the truth that way. No, no, no. Not in front of them. Into their mouth. They're not watching you take a dump. They're under you receiving your time and the thing that that might make the pressure, but the pup play lifestyle that's just so involved, like that's just, that's a real, and you've got to buy the latex and I tell you, I don't think latex outfits are cheap. That's what you're concerned with. The lifestyle is so much the expenses. He's got time for that stuff, you know? Yeah. I'm just saying that it's a real investment to be into the pup play. I've only seen two that this one pig just benefit from the whole pup play thing. One Guy, one guy, he's like the, who's your owner guy? He's the only guy that actually gets off on this thing. Right? And he has all these pups. He's like, I'm training. Smell your cock and balls. That's, he's just, it's just him. It's him in the five dudes that are into it. They're like, where are your dog?

Speaker 2:          00:57:49       You know what I don't like now that they're doing actual, it's like it mixes the animal stuff. Yeah. Now it's like, okay, is this, it's kind of weird to think of a, uh, a dog. How do you get hard? Of course, that's the whole thing. You got to mix those two worlds. Yes. Now I'm confused. Now are these guys into fucking dogs and this is sublimating that need to fuck dog. Our dog's,

This is like a, an ongoing thing here at Chrysler Motors automotive operations research has been proceeding to develop a line of heavy duty transmissions that establishes new standards for reliability, durability, and quality with customer needs. As our primary focus work is proceeding on the crudely conceived idea of an instrument that would not only supply in verse reactive current for use in unilateral phase, detractors would also be capable of automatically synchronizing Cardinal Graham eaters. An instrument is the turbo and calculate your original machine had a base plate of prefab emulated emulate by a malleable log rhythmic casing in such a way that the two sperming bearings or in a bourbon blind with a parametric fam separations, and then these guys just hilarious, so fit into the amputation.
