We start to show them in. Yeah. Fuck boys out there. Just trying to talk shit against me. Oh, okay. Oh, I see you have a gun. Do you? You have a gun deal. I'll put down my weapon out, down to my weapon. I will put down my weapon. I got another fucking sword, bitch.

Speaker 1:          00:04:57       Well, well, well go to your mom's house, Christina. My audience moving then man. Horrible does that.

Speaker 2:          00:05:46       It's really cool. I was reading that first ad and you were searching for your email. You're like,

Speaker 4:          00:05:51       oh, sorry. So that first ad has you just it, you know, because 5,000 different people send us the copy, right? I don't know who the fuck to look for. Hey, take it easy. This isn't this so demeaning. Look at this like a goat. You are a goat. That's why they call you goat lips. You have trouble finding the fucking ads. Why don't you just, linkedin is helpful. There's Linkedin and get all the ads there. Length. Dennis, how length is how Dennis helpful? Nobody actually uses link. I feel like linkedin only exist to be invited to use it and then nobody really uses it once the loud you to their linkedin profile. I always wanting to add but never really using no thanks. Don't want anything to do with you. Um, linkedin. What a great first of all. Yeah, I like it. Cool. Your first boyfriend has a video app and again, it kind of reminds me of him.

Speaker 4:          00:06:50       Um, no, but, uh, this dude, he's not playing games while you fuck boys. I think fuck boy is one of my favorite saying like, fuck boy, what does it mean? Is it is, it's, it's a, it's a demeaning. You're a bitch of a bitch of a man. You're not even a man. You're a fuckboy fuck. It's a huge insult. Have you heard? Fuck boy. Yeah. It's, no, it's no good man. I like it. It's kind of, you know, where it came from. I think it came out of the fact that, uh, it's, it's socially unacceptable to basically say faggot. Right? Oh, okay. It's like an anger at fuck is, is, is, is pejorative. It's full of venom. And it's, I think it's like almost like a replacement for that, so instead of fag, you're not saying, fuck boy. Yeah. It's, it's meant to be really insulting.

Speaker 4:          00:07:39       Right. And I think it's something that people can yell, right. Without being like, Hey, what watches off c version of Faggot? I think so. Yeah. I really feel like the it is. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I like, fuck boy. If I can't say Faggot, I'm going to say fuck boy. It sounds like you're already doing it. Sounds like it worked. I think I like this new system. Yeah. About this is how you get around the political, correct. It is. You just find a new word for the same thing. That's exactly what's happening. Yeah. I'm on board looking for that new end bomb. If you know anyone, any suggestion, but you fuck boys out there trying to talk shit against me. Oh. Oh. I like how slowly he puts it away. You have a gun deal. I'll put down my weapon out down my west. Okay. I will send down my weapon. I got another fucking sword. You fucking bitch. Yeah, I love him. Yeah. He's talking that shit. This guy could have very well dated. You definitely could have dated that guy. Yeah. He reminds me and Christian Slater a little bit from the 90s. Ah, yeah. I don't know something about him. It's fucking funny, man. I would ask what's going on there, but it's like, why bother at this point? Yeah. Yeah. Why, why even ask? I used to care and now I'm like, you know what, it's just worlds. Just the world. The world sees what happens when you do 338 episodes.

Speaker 2:          00:09:05       My Mom's house,

Speaker 4:          00:09:07       I don't even know where to start with a this going on

Speaker 2:          00:09:13       this weekend. Um, or with this, this show, there's so many things to talk about. Um, you know, one of the great things that happened was this weekend. Oh God. Are we going to talk about this already? The only we should, I think it's pretty good idea. Oh Jesus. Fuck. Here's your boy.

Speaker 4:          00:09:34       Can I, thanks for coming out to flappers guys. What a fun weekend.

Speaker 5:          00:09:38       Bourbon.

Speaker 4:          00:09:52       That's your boy. Dj Dad Mouth. I saw, so did you make the horn sounds, was that you actually DJ? Yes. Yeah. And then you went and then I screwed up. He did it kind of, you know, like, this is my first time. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. It was,

Speaker 2:          00:10:05       how'd it feel? It felt amazing. I've never had so much joy. I even texted you a picture of myself smiling ear to ear saying, I can't sleep because I'm just thinking about my deejaying career. Cause I canceled all the rest of my standup dates for the year. Um, so here's what happened. I'm in, uh, I'm in, uh, Cleveland all yeah. Doing shows. And I see on Twitter, somebody tags me a tweet. Oh, so cool that, uh, Tom Segura and Hannibal Burress, or in Cleveland at the same time, if I look at Hannibal's page and he's doing a popup show, we're like, oh, I have two shows tonight. Maybe I can get him to come over on the early show. So I send him a text. I said, are you, are you in town? Do you want to come in, pop and do a guest spot on my early show? And he says, sure. So he comes by the, the club and he has his DJ. Uh, he does, he has a DJ that he brings to all his shows. Right. Tony Trimm, who's a great guy and I just met that night. I love Hannibal, by the way. I haven't seen him in a minute, but I really like that and it was great. So first of all, uh, I have a video of him hitting the stage. The djs name Tony Trim.

Speaker 4:          00:11:15       Tony Trimm. Yeah. Deejays. Why do all Djs have like the coolest personality? He's the coolest guy. I know. They all are. Yeah. You may want to hang out with him for sure. [inaudible] Jay scratch starting from scratch. Yeah. Hung out with that guy in, in London and spend bad, there are the fucking coolest dudes because we, what they like, you know, they love music, so yeah. I mean they love it. They like having a good time. They're DJ's. Yeah. And they're kind of down to earth cause I feel like deejaying, it's a real humble gig in the beginning. Much like stand up, which is why they usually, you click with them. Yeah. It's the same grass roots effort. Like, does anyone want to hear me Dj? Yeah, fuck you asshole. And it takes 10 years, like really getting good. I love your scratch. Yeah. That's really

Speaker 6:          00:11:54       key. Is graduate to have a big record. Make her use two hands.

Speaker 2:          00:11:59       So anyways, I these guys both see me getting really excited. Oh No, no, I'm jumping ahead. Yeah. Handled, does a guest spot. I have a video of him hitting the stage, that place he rubbed it. I mean it was like you announced, guess what George Carlin isn't dead. He's right here. Like they went fucking crazy, which was cool to watch. Yeah. Uh, and then he set the tone. It was great. Um, and also I should say bill squire was on the shows, the full charge coming back to the west coast. Got then did me a favor doing those shows. So it was great. So anyways, then panels like I'm going to do my show on the other side of town, other side of town, meaning 600 miles away. And he says, uh, if you want afterwards, ah, I'm having, I'm throwing an after party and this is what he does this in a lot of cities like finds a place after his show and has a party and you know, obviously Dj is Dj doesn't just do his live show. He does the after party. You want to come? I go, sure. And then he texts me, I'll let you DJ a few songs. Oh my God. Did your Dick just explode off your I was like, I started texting him love letters. I was like, dude, this is a map.

Speaker 6:          00:13:07       No Ha. Sorry. How to handle all know that you were interested in Dj. He just knows, I mean we've, we've talked about music before but then he saw, I mean right there I was like asking the Dj all about equipment. So he was watching, he was watching us. Yeah. And May I say for the record, Hannibal Buress is a type of gentlemen who should have yes. Yes. A Dj, Huh? Opening friendly. He's a cool, it's cool dude. Yeah. Like it's a mellow dude. I can see him being like, I love it. This is part of his, his steeze, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:13:35       talking about it. How, when, when Tony is not available. I was like, is that the worst? He's like, yeah, absolutely. Because I liked the vibe that it says it's your show and you know, then I, then I'm asking you a sound guy. Can you do this?

Speaker 6:          00:13:46       What? Yeah. It's like, it's the most impossible request. Well, like this weekend at full pairs, I did my shows and they're great. Thank you for asking. And I requested a song. How were you? Shows that they were amazing. Yeah. So Super Fun. You had, um, I old Maryland rice cub of who? I love Dave Ryan. It's my homie. Yeah. Anyways, I asked the, you know, the Dj, can you just bring me up to like John Spencer Blues Explosion? Who, okay. The song is called two kinds of law. What's that? And then how far in should I start? I'm like, dude, just fucking make it good. Yeah, you're the DJ. Yeah, you fucking, I, you should know these things and you know what? That's your fuck one job. Could I hired this guy, right, right. Dj Dan, Marketo burned me out of whatever. Just fucking can I compliment you on your, like you got down. What djs do, like the pointing and the course, you know it's all coming together. It's still, that looks fucking Funkmaster

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       flex right there. You do look like you. You could be a DJ though. I'm going to be a DJ. No, I am going to Dj. Yeah, no, no, no. I can, I can hear the sarcasm response. What's great about our garage is that it's really soundproofed let me finish. So this is the best news ever. So why? Then I get a message from him. So he's like, you know, come, come, hang out. And you're like, okay, I'm going to come. I have two shows. I have a show that starts at, you know, nine 30 10 I'm going to get it. And you're like, I'm going to go. But you're, it's still like, I got to get in a car and go across town. I get offstage and handle was no, we're going to do the after party at the club that you're at at the comedy club.

Speaker 2:          00:15:34       Oh even better. So I like that's the, you don't have to go anywhere, you know, the only thing better would be like, it's in your hotel. So, so he shows up with Tony, they, you know, they set up in the lounge, people are hanging out having drinks, he sets up and then I go up there and I go, can I get like a little tutorial? They, they each are showing me stuff with Tony is like giving me kind of a crash course and you know, he's like, oh, you're not intimidated by buttons. When I go, I think I actually doing this show, I go, you know, I'm always playing drops, adjusting things. And is this similar to what it's not. I mean, it's not on board. They have a board there that, you know, I think he was plugged into, it's just that the, his actual, it's, you know, two basically two turntables and a microphone.

Speaker 2:          00:16:24       Yeah. At a mixer. It's all, he has an all in one board. It's just that remembering, oh, this does this and that does that. I can memorize that and not be like, what is all this right away? I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm saying electronic devices that have different functions don't make me go, I'm not doing anything with that. It's not as daunting. It's not as daunting. So I'm starting to learn the thing, you know, the very basics. Um, I'm starting to, I have him take a picture and video. I sent it to you and then we're laughing so hard at your responses because your responses are like, no, you should be embarrassed. This is embarrassing. Like so, so demeaning. The, so gay, fuck boy gay can't say, yeah, you're, it's just like, and then I keep telling him, I'm like, I keep showing them the messages and I'm like, I just enjoy this. He was like, dude, I'm going to give you free Skype lessons. I'm going to get you in that. Tony Trimm. Thanks Tony for the free lessons via Skype. What are you doing to my life? Having fun? We're having fun. God dammit. So anyways, I had an absolute blast doing that. I have ordered no, yes, I ordered the same equipment he has. Okay, great. Um, how much of an investment is that? It's under $15,000. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:17:57       Well, sorry, a little jeans. You don't need diapers and dad's got a scratch board. Your baby doesn't need a formula or closed dead scratch in this weekend. And Yeah, Cleveland, it's pretty good. So no, it's absolutely not expensive actually. You would, you'd be surprised. Yeah, seriously. I don't need to know. You don't need to know. I need to fill me in. We don't need to talk about it that seriously. It's funny. This, yeah, it's far less than the laptop. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. So it's not, it's not a crazy thing. It's like buying a keyboard. Sure. Yeah. You know why? Because it's one of those things where as time progressed and it, they made it easier for people to access things. It drove the price of things. Why does everything, Yeah. Um, now this may be a dumb question, but do the Djs use records anymore? It's all you can there. I mean you can as this is plugged in with a computer. Wow. So you go to your iTunes. Yeah. And you're like, yeah. So then how do they blend the two songs together? How do you do that? That's part of the, there's a mixer in the board. I feel like I'm a thousand years and it has a built in horn drop.

Speaker 4:          00:19:06       As long as you do the horn, drop my fine and also has gunshots. Here's what I mean.

Speaker 2:          00:19:14       Really. I'm not, I'm, I'm going to come out and say it right now. Okay. I feel like, yes, I'm going to put it, it's going to be obviously in the garage. It's gonna be something I do recreationally for fun. When I get to the point where I'm not like obviously going to be a professional DJ, but when it gets to the point where I have a, um, a decent command of how to, you know, get songs playing, moving together, like I have some command of, of this board, I am going to do a show somewhere. I don't know what city will be. And then I'm going to have an after party where I'm going to bring that shit and we're going to

Speaker 4:          00:19:49       all right. A live party. I think you should do it. Dj, Dad, Matthew J. Dad Mountain to Dj Dad math or is it typically by, I feel like dad mouth is who I am. Yeah. I feel like, uh, I feel like that's the right Dj name for me. Yeah. Plus it's a huge shout out to your mom's house listeners, which let's face it will be your only audience in the beginning. Maybe in the beginning. Yeah. Until you really build that a beef following. Are you going to be fun to spam? Yeah. Um, am I am. I feel like that'll be on the, you know, on the leg of it. I feel like it'll be kind of like Spokane, Syracuse. He be fast. Something that was a huge Dj. I know you have to go to Miami to like pay. I got a, sorry, I got a book, a Miami Gig Asap. Miami. And then you've got to do Vegas. That's where all the Djs and you love Vegas. That's the cool thing is now you get to go to all your favorite cities. Las Vegas, Miami. The best thing about it, if I be fat, if I do at Miami Gig is that I can

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       do the gig and be like, Hey, my DJ set starts at midnight and Miami's like, that's what time I'm waking up.

Speaker 6:          00:20:55       Yeah, sure. Let me tell you something. What I love about this deejaying Gig yeah. Is that it really combines everything you love in life, which is staying up late. Yeah. Late nights hanging out with tons of strangers. Yeah. Loud music. Yeah. Your favorite places like Vegas, Miami, these are all things that just say Tom Segura exclusively. Um, lights. Just like that whole rowdy sort of, I see you then. That is your lane. So you've really found a good lane. Stay with it. Tom. Ever seen so happy. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:21:31       Ever see me happy? And then you tweeted, yeah, when I tweeted this out, I hate seeing you. So happy. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:21:50       I give you, I give you two or three of these before you're like, I don't know, two or three what gigs. Here's, here's my prediction. Dj Dad mouth after two shows on a late night Saturday. Yeah. And you're like, oh, I got this thing lined up to Dj and then after him are on 1230 midnight after you've done your two and two and a half, three hours of standup. Yeah. Exhausted. Yeah. You flown across the country and you've been up doing press that morning at 5:00 AM you're going to be dreading it and then you know you'll do it and he'll be like, I wish I didn't have a fucking DJ tonight and wait until you see the crowds. I have just like how they just jump

Speaker 2:          00:22:27       Ben and singing and dancing. It's going to be crazy. I can't wait. I'm going to call Macio and then I get some tips from him too. Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:22:40       Why don't you talk to Dj scratch starting from scratch. I might talk to you. Yeah, that guy is cool. It Shit. Yeah, they're all just the other dude.

Speaker 2:          00:22:47       They're all cool man. Um, oh, so I probably should have left that up. Want to fucking kill myself to you put this. Oh yeah. Yeah. Here it is by the way. Um, do you know you haven't seen it yet, but I was in, when I was in Cleveland, I stopped by the, uh, local morning TV show. Yeah. And I, oh, I probably should open it here. I, um, I did a little interview. It looks good. And uh, WWE people were digging it, man. You know, I, I did something that you might not be expecting, but I just wanted to show you,

Speaker 6:          00:23:31       you know, we are, and we welcome a guy like this onto the show. Welcome Ohio Native Comedian Thompson Gora folks. So, okay. Before we get into this set out to everybody all over the world doing their thing and stuff like that, shout out to dany acts x Vlp

Speaker 7:          00:23:47       you know what I'm saying? Got It. So, okay, this guy, I didn't want to know anything about him before he came on. I thought it was a lot of mystery behind these sunglasses. I started asking him some questions like, you know what, I'm just going to stop. So this is one big surprise coming up here. So I first want to welcome you tell you, I think you have the coolest style of any comedian that has come on the show. I appreciate you. Thank you. This is your, this is your lock normally coming from Ohio, being from Cincinnati, like where do you kind of get your inspiration, I guess from your clothes, you know, from the streets. Mostly I travel, I just picked it up from, you know, fight, fight and people, you know, beef in like I got this, you know, I don't know. Why aren't you had some beef with crazy low cost.

Speaker 7:          00:24:39       Yeah. It's funny you mentioned those. So he's this rapper from San Jose, right? That has been challenging me on youtube wanting to fight. Physically fight. Yeah. He wants to step in the ring and he's been working out at like target and Walmart training and stuff. Yup. And you know, I just want him to know that I've been in home depot and staples and I've been throwing around like two by fours and I'm just ready to get down. I just want him, you know what I'm saying? I want him to know, you feel me. Don't talk back. I'm saying that I'm ready to do this. So whenever he wants to step in the ring, we can get down. All right, well that's a challenge.

Speaker 2:          00:25:16       All right. Oh, that's a challenge actually. I got to get her, she really went with the whole role. What's your roll with it? Yeah. What a horrible job. Her job. I mean, well, yeah, I mean the thing I was thinking about too is how many of the, um, of the other morning shows I've done where they would've just been like, we got to go. They just came out. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:25:36       I want the whole world to know that just reached out to crazy low so we can, we can do this whenever he wants to do it. Okay. Well I don't want to mess with you then. Do you do this with other comedians to, do you get into these? Uh, I mean, if they want to feel these hands, yeah, they shouldn't. They can. They can let me know and I'll let them know right back. You know, I try to keep it, you know, pretty easy. Most of the time if I'm deejaying or if I'm Dj as well. Yeah. I'll be deejaying this weekend here. I'm a tweet out a location for a pop up show, so I'll be, I didn't even realize that.

Speaker 2:          00:26:04       How fucking serendipitous that was because that was before the call. That too. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:26:13       Stand up. I'll be doing some, some sites. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Gymnastics. I do that. I mean, I hear you laughing, but I'm actually pretty damn good at. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean I could do, if I wanted to, I could do six flips right here. Right now. Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam. But if we didn't have these cameras right here, I would, and I don't want to pay that, but yeah. Jim just as well, gymnast. I'm an trainer. I train dogs. Um, I can train. I am actually one of the few guys that can train cats.

Speaker 2:          00:26:48       It's too, by the way, that was the closest I came to laughing really hard. I had to bite my lip a little bit when I said that. I was like, it's so stupid. So

Speaker 7:          00:27:01       lot of people, what's the coolest thing? I'm about to laugh right there. Uh, probably answer a phone. Mister Jinx with the flushing the toilet. Did they know how to do that too? I tried to cat if he could, if he hears the phone ring. Yeah, he could hit the speaker phone button. That's what you're calling. He's, let me see your hand

Speaker 2:          00:27:38       moves the hand. Somebody was going, oh, I hate that. I ruined the phone. Yeah. Yeah. Betty ways. You know, I put it out there man. So great. So they must have heard your call. I feel like the, the world, but I'm also talking about locally, I put it out there for looks, you know. Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah.

I said, have a straight to phone Pharma. He affirmed at temple for no brainer. Chris in Los is a thug, is going to maintain it in every way. No play.

Speaker 6:          00:32:54       Okay. So yeah, I'm sorry, I'm just processing it. I don't feel like I can't, my brain can't comprehend it.

Speaker 2:          00:33:02       So this dude on the REIT owns a restaurant. Mm. And that came up during the show. Um, many ways. He was like, we were just talking about that. And then I think it was, I forget how far it is from, I think he said he just drove two hours to meet crazy legs. Oh my God. So at the end of this video, because this ends here pretty quickly, right? Yeah. And then it's like, it's just him making a video that he actually shot on the way to meet crazy. Lokes um, so I guess he took to heart the, uh, you know, the part where before I was saying we could do, we could get together and sell tickets and do a charity thing. He is suggesting we do one for mental health awareness. Hey, that's great. Let's do it. Well, we just have to figure out what exactly are we selling tickets to. It's really up to you. So Laura, I know you said I could spar him, but I mean come on.

Speaker 6:          00:34:00       I don't know. Is that really? Does that a good idea? Yeah. Let's, let's marinate on this amount.

Speaker 2:          00:34:07       Maybe deejaying challenge. Go lokes isn't a Dj's is a rapper. Hello? So you want to do a show with them? Hello? Yes, obviously. And then the greatest rappers, one of the greatest Dj's alive. Oh my God. Together. Do you think you could sell tickets to that? I think to our fans, we could. I mean, if you're, if you're donating to charity, you're not selling tickets to, you know, actually for what you're doing in nor cal or so cow. We'll do in nor cal. I think that's an idea. I don't, I'm not saying it's set in stone, but I think that's a good idea.

Speaker 6:          00:34:44       Okay, well here's another idea. Okay. Hear me out. All right. Why don't we do a fucking your mom's house podcast live. Oh yeah. And invite crazy looks down and you, and do that and make it like a fucking massive, your mom's house event. That's a good idea. And then maybe the big finale is you and crazy lokes deejaying and you guys can kind of prepare and you know. Yeah. And we can, that will be really crazy. Crazier than crazy, crazy, crazy looks. What do you think? So kind of good idea. And we can get a huge venue. I think this is going to be Norco. Norco. No. So cow do it down here.

Speaker 2:          00:35:20       You got to bring crazy looks down dude. We go up there. Okay, well see that's what I think we did. I think we'd go up there and do it. Okay. Because you could also everybody, we could, we could, you know, invite the, every Sacramento listener, every San Jose,

Speaker 4:          00:35:39       San Francisco Scouts could come out to be a big thing. Look, let's, let's, I think that's a great idea. That'd be really fun. No. And how much we have to donate to charity. Yeah, we could do that would be good. That'd be awesome. I can't, I can't believe this happened. Um, it's very surreal when they actually talk back to you. Yeah. It's a very weird, the dude,

Speaker 2:          00:36:03       the video, he's like, you got my email. I'll have your email. It says the emails in this where you don't put it on the screen. Where's your email? Yeah, we got out of the g though his oh no.

Speaker 4:          00:36:13       Yeah, that's what I'm saying. No, no, the guys, I feel like we got to go through him. Yeah, I know. But do you have his email? Crazy one? No, no, no. The guy his, yeah, he met. He's the one that said it is. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right, cool. Wow. Do you know what this feels like? The TV's talking to you, you know? Yeah, I know. Like what, it's so weird to see my name in a video like this, you know? Right. Yeah. Dan Did sub like that. So stuff like that. This is crazy. This is a big shout out to everyone all over the world is really doing their thing. Um, well I just have that is exciting. That is so fucking funny and so good man. Can believe it.

Speaker 2:          00:36:52       It was also the district's diss tracks were in that crazy looks folder. Yeah. Uh, MC. Now I'm saying,

Speaker 4:          00:37:02       oh my gosh. Okay. Okay. We'll go out on one of those. Okay. Um, that's huge

Speaker 2:          00:37:08       to uh, I, I haven't even seen it so I just want to know because this is like something that I figured like you probably need to watch

Speaker 11:         00:37:17       see where it is high. So yeah, we were sending, this is my official you of eating ass.

Speaker 2:          00:37:28       Okay. Okay. This is something that I feel like you need to watch with. I think you need to pay a little better attention to, right. This is like one of the courses you didn't do well in school, you know, so it's like, hey, you got to go. But was it something that I'm, hopefully it hits you in the heart, you know, you're ready.

Speaker 4:          00:37:47       What else did you do this weekend? Any see any movie?

Speaker 11:         00:37:51       Hi. So this video is my official for you. She's like 12 of eating ashes. This we can true. Suddenly I had the pleasure of eating ass. People have asked me then I said, why? And I say, why not? We have asked me how was it? Yeah. And I have given lots of slot into this question and I have decided that it would be best that I just make a general view in my one experience.

Speaker 2:          00:38:28       She's um, I don't know if she put the music on for this moment though, right?

Speaker 11:         00:38:34       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       no. First of all, I rate the experience is 6.5 out of 10. That's not rationally. I rated it a six, but I gave it some thought and I think a 6.5 is more fitting. I just really want you to think about that on the terms of how enjoyable it might be for you. You know, damn dog, he's our dog.

Speaker 11:         00:39:03       Um, I guess I weigh out the pros and cons. Pros and eating ass. The other person on Juliet. Thank you, joy. Thank you.

Speaker 4:          00:39:14       No one cares about that. Your spouse

Speaker 11:         00:39:16       people. Another pro is that it doesn't taste bad. Most people think that.

Speaker 4:          00:39:23       So I'm gonna think about which dumbed, yeah,

Speaker 11:         00:39:27       it's bad or they think it will taste like, but it doesn't go exactly like any, that's so dumb body person at all.

Speaker 4:          00:39:36       Okay. If I let something that has jelly coming out of it, it's going to taste like jelly coming out of a donut that has the chocolate coming out of it in the hall. Then looks like chocolate chocolate coming out. There's no chocolate coming in. The chocolate lives there, but it's not coming out the chocolate. It smells like the container from which it comes. It's, you know, like when you, you keep something in a bowl or something and it retains the olders. It's how you have to sterilize it so that it doesn't, she's crazy. This person who's telling you crazy like a dany act

Speaker 11:         00:40:14       for whatever reason, it just, it doesn't taste like anything. There you go. So hard to do chocolate. So can I have my coffee? The pros, the cons would be, I would say the biggest time is this smell. It doesn't smell that great.

Speaker 4:          00:40:33       Then how does it taste? Tastes good. If it smells bad, dub down. She says it doesn't smell that great. Well what? Come on man. That's a very distinct, I mean the witness said, okay, it doesn't smell great and he's good. That could imply that it smells good but not great. My granny used to cook a few things that didn't smell great, but I'm sure they taste good.

Speaker 11:         00:41:01       You could also ask the person to wash their ass real quick before there's not a problem. The smallest pleasant, but the smells very bearable. I would say it's from this morning. Another con would be sometimes this person has not shaped their ass and that's totally fine.

Speaker 4:          00:41:26       I can take care of that too.

Speaker 11:         00:41:28       But if you're not a fan of hair, then you probably won't appreciate.

Speaker 2:          00:41:33       How mortified would you be? Just if you were, uh, you know, uh, older, a little older parents, you see this video of your dad, you're like, of all the videos she could pose,

Speaker 11:         00:41:49       do the amount of hair that to potentially be somebody. I think that's it for the cons. So essentially the cons, the pros way of the coms. Thank you. Um, and so, you know, I read it a 6.5. I didn't think it was that bad at all. I was expecting worse and it wasn't that bad. Um, so now that we got the review out of the way, I would also like to address something that I was pretty upset about after this event happened. I was very upset after I eat us because of the amount of people who I've heard say, I don't need us. Okay. How are you done with us?

Speaker 2:          00:42:30       This is good. Look into those eyes and she's looking at you right now. Okay. Okay. All right.

Speaker 11:         00:42:36       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:42:38       Yeah, we can be done, but I just want you to think about it a little bit.

Speaker 6:          00:42:42       Did I mention the movie that I narrated is out? Do you have the names I can pull up? Said the film I narrated. It's, um, it's out and, um, you know, festivals and whatnot. It's called can we take a joke? I'm the narrator. Gilbert Godfrey, Lisa Lampanelli, Penn Jillette is in it. And it's about the, how political correctness is destroying the comedy world. Um, pretty interesting stuff. And did you know that there's a comedian being sued right now in Canada? I sure did. Yeah. Ah, it's just heartbreaking.

Speaker 2:          00:43:17       They're really strict law about saying fuck boys and making fun of people. Boy That's really lame. I love you Canada. But that's lame. Yeah. I feel like I could have fucking, there's a few times I've been there where I could have gotten in trouble. Yeah. Because he made fun of uh, that guy in Canada made fun of a disabled. Yes. A person.

Speaker 6:          00:43:39       Yeah. Little boy. Yeah. Went to sing for the pope or something. Yeah. And the line was like, you know, I don't expect that kid to live long and he ended up living subset or

Speaker 2:          00:43:48       cares, whatever. I mean joke, but it's something like, uh, when I did my, um, my conjoined twins, but I feel like that could have been taken in Canada the way I know. It's terrifying.

Speaker 12:         00:44:01       If I have the right to say anything, you certainly have the right to be offended if I can say anything I want. You can say pension. The said that. And you can say, Penn shouldn't have said that. None of us should talk to him anymore. And pension to said that we should, he shouldn't have a job and pension has said that and he's not funny. Pen shouldn't have said that. We're going to put a pic, it's out in front of the club and he should be able to go to that club. All that is within your rights and very clearly within your rights, but just like, uh, every individual has to make a decision on just because they can say something doesn't mean they have to say it. Individuals have to make the decision that just because you might feel offended by something doesn't mean you have to announce you're offended. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:44:50       So there you go. It's a really, really timely documentary. It's, it's weird. These guys started making it right and it's all kind of exploded since then. They covered that story about that woman who tweeted a, she was on her way to South Africa. Yeah. That she was like, I hope I don't get aids. Just kidding. I'm white and not the greatest job, but who cares? And she ended up losing her job. She ended up having to change her name. They couldn't even get her to be in the documentary because she's like, I'm not fucking touching the subject again. I got into so much trouble over. I'd tweet.

Speaker 2:          00:45:21       I feel like this is such a cool Gig, uh, for you to get as soon as the best, not only is it the cool gig of narrating something, which is a good Gig, but this topic every, basically every comedian feels this way about it. And you're the voice of the film.

Speaker 6:          00:45:37       Yeah. I'm so, I'm so private. Ted Balaguer did it. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:45:40       So here's a little write up in maxim, a new documentary. Can we take a joke? Presents us with their side of the issue directed by Ted, by Alec are narrated by Comedian Christina [inaudible]. Keith, did I say it right? The film shows how luminaries like Gilbert Godfrey, Penn Jillette least Leben Ellie, Adam Carolla, Jim Norton, Heather McDonald have grappled with this trend in American culture. Spoiler alert. They're not too thrilled about it. Um, it looks like it's been doing well at the fit.

Speaker 6:          00:46:09       First of all, services are great. It's, it's, I don't know yet how to see it, but it's called, can we take a joke? I think it just debuted. It's really cool. I can't wait to, I haven't seen it. I haven't seen it with my narration. And it, but I've seen it in like the, the raw as I was narrating it. So it's, it's so cool. I mean, so be clear on the timely thing to, to comedians

Speaker 2:          00:46:29       basically feel the way that Penn just mentioned there that's basically summarizes. Yeah. Which is that you have the right to um, feel any way you want to feel about a joke, but it's the idea that your feeling that way outweighs everything else that is outrageous.

Speaker 6:          00:46:53       Yeah. Well, and also like to have your feelings hurt. It's fine, but hurt feelings don't want people losing their jobs. Yeah. I'm like that woman, I tweeted something, okay, yeah, we get it. It's really racially insensitive. But did she deserve to lose her livelihood and have it ruined her life because she said something, she says something without thinking. She was trying to be funny and fail. Like it wasn't, she wasn't inciting violence against. People are playing clips that are like, hey hiller you know what I mean? Like she wasn't doing those things right. Like Gilbert Gilbert lost his job. He does the AFLAC. Yeah. AFLAC

Speaker 2:          00:47:27       voice because of tweets, joke, tweet, you know, they are, they're obviously not the sweetest tweets, but that's, you know, he's a comedian. That's what he's known. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:47:36       And he's a comedian who is known for being cantankerous. Yeah. And saying crazy shit. So if you want the guy who's not going to say that, don't hire Gilbert as your, it's so corny, like, yeah. Anyway, you're going to you, it's the cover a lot of other examples of what's happening, especially on college campuses, which is kind of really alarming because that's supposed to be where you debate ideas of all kinds and now there's a resistance, even debating ideas that are considered political.

Speaker 2:          00:48:03       Please. Also this movement of I've seen amongst some comedians of supporting,

Speaker 6:          00:48:08       no, yeah. Political. Correct.

Speaker 2:          00:48:10       So I guess I actually misspoke when I said this is the universal comedian, um, approach. It's the universal good comedians response to that stuff. So basically every comedian that I see defending that isn't worth a shit. Yeah, I agree. So yeah. It's um, it's fucking terrible. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:48:32       Well even, um, there was something I heard on the doctor Laura show. I listened to her for a laugh where they, uh, there was someone in a university, a Catholic university defending same sex marriage, just being like, I believe marriage is between a man and got thrown out of class and called a bigot and the hatred and all this crap. Offending cat, the Catholic stance. So not, you said defending same sex marriage. Oh, sorry. Defending traditional marriage. Okay. Sorry. Like old school marriage and the, um, the teacher was like, that's hateful. How dare you, like, well, okay, maybe, but why not debate it? We not figure it out and this kid got in and just let that person think that you care. Yeah. Yeah. So interesting and interesting. I know the world is, it's a very interesting place that comedians actually defend. Oh,

Speaker 2:          00:49:18       the political correctness stuff I read, I have not, I've yet to see one good one. Um, it's always somebody who, who basically walks around with a lot of feelings in their comedy. So like, they want that defended, you know, that that's kind of what they carry around is that they're, they're, they're very sensitive, which is fine. Right, right, right. Um, but I, I haven't really seen many a working comics. No,

Speaker 6:          00:49:46       no. Working me that and also where do you draw the line? Like how do you know what's not going to offend anybody? What's the safe joke? Am I going to tell it? Talk, tell jokes about balloons or is there some kind of balloon league that's going to get mad? Cause I'm harming the integrity of balloons. You know, it's, yeah. It's just, it goes on and on. There's no, I know. Oh, that's makes me crazy. It's a topic that makes me crazy. It makes me crazy too. Anyway, go see it. Can we take a joke? Cuts out?

Speaker 2:          00:50:12       Um, we have, uh, what is this a voicemail that came in from a fan yet? But I play it. How do we get that talent? Some Italian lady is calling them.

Speaker 6:          00:50:21       Oh. Oh. Oh. And the cheat sheet. Okay. I think getting Persian voicemails and Razah. Joan. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Not as many. It's only been like one in the last month or so.

Speaker 2:          00:50:35       Okay. Um, let's see. We have this, hello? Is there the professional composer? No. Yeah, it should be the first one in the fan mail section. Oh, it's not an inquiry. I got you. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:50:51       By the way, it was really neat. Um, am I shows at flappers when I would walk up to stage to have fans yelling, Hey Hitler, uh, here, like I don't know how to respond to you right now. Oh my God. Not Everybody in this audience is a Miami guys and the same thing. And the guy's like, come on man, Hitler. And I'm like fuck me in my ass. And the one guy was like, after he goes, I was going to give you a Heil Hitler. And I go, why don't you not? Why are you parked this where it's at now? Not I'm someone goes during the middle of my set, I choose retarded. And I started laughing and then I did the would you rather for the audience, cause I had to feel like I had to fill them in. Not so much time. So good. Broad that show to a screeching halt I had that. Some people find funny,

Speaker 2:          00:51:38       some people might not, people didn't not into it. Yeah. Alright. A Fan mail. Here we go to the mommy. This may concern over the past few months, I've woken up to occasional voicemails from a stranger in Italy or so. I thought today she called during the day and she used the Italian version of my name to greet me, Matteo, and I believe was trying to claim to know me instead of the usual Chow Paula leading me to believe this may be a prank, someone I know or maybe something far more sinister. I beg for your help by seeing if any mommies out there can translate these voicemails for me. I must get to the bottom of this somehow. Also, the voicemails themselves are pretty funny and Italian, but probably funnier if I knew what the Brown she was saying, Huh? I've sent the first voicemail from three months ago along with this email over and out, Matt. So we've got to have a fluent Italian listener for sure. Without a doubt. I speak it. I can translate it. So now this makes more sense. Uh, let me see if I can play it now. Let's see what, so this is basically, this person's in the same boat as you. Yeah. Um, with the Persian voicemails. Yeah. That, that were ended up being absolutely fucking hilarious.

Speaker 19:         01:15:56       When I go to the gathering and shows and other girls, we can just sit and be girls. You're not preppy. You're not going to judge me for anything. Like we can sit down and have a one on one alone conversation and relate to so many things in so many ways that not any other people can really relate to.

Speaker 14:         01:16:12       Oof. If I was a judge

Speaker 4:          01:16:16       and those were the first few people that came up on the contest, my score would be both, but can I tell you how much would you love it if one of these broads showed up at a legitimate beauty contest? That's true. That would be it. Then I started watching Miss America all over again. One of these Lumitex showed up. Can we do that? Can we subvert a beauty pageant like that? Yeah. I mean like, I guess that's kind of what they're doing. Yeah. So that's sort of the, uh, the, you know, my point of it. Yeah. I like it. All right. That's cool. But still score well. All right. Why is that not such a dad thing? Oof. Huh.

Speaker 14:         01:17:01       Now do it.

Speaker 4:          01:17:02       What do you think your dad would say about these ladies? I'd be really upset. Is this your first gathering? And my dad does your, your first beauty contest.

Speaker 9:          01:17:10       I won 2009. I need a microphone disappear. Where? In the front? In the bag?

Speaker 4:          01:17:21       Yeah. Wow. So she put it up on a microphone or coach? Yeah. That's pretty cool. Actually. I'm a bigger fan now. I respect that. My Dad would be really upset by this too. Oh, I should this woman I saw ugly God. Fuck, fuck in the flood. Look good. These pigs. Oh my. Um, well my father has no tolerance for unattractive women. Yeah. Disdain for unattractive people. Like how dare you be ugly fat too, right? Oh, fatness is inexcusable. Yeah. He always makes jokes about me. He's like, does he? Well, he's always like, oh, see you lost some weight. And I was like, Oh yeah. He's like, no, this is a miss cyanide here. Talking about her. Uh,

Speaker 9:          01:18:05       our journey started with you sideline. The juggle that rapper who lives in our home studio with her boyfriend's sidekick. Okay.

Speaker 18:         01:18:15       Pig Feed saw. Can't break me down. I bet they're going, I hate me now. There's no safety now.

Speaker 4:          01:18:25       So, so far I'll say, I'd rather watch her compete in the beauty part. Then the rapping part point taken now in the concert is between Nick Hark, the guy from the real plastic surgeon in Beverly hills or DJ poor grind, whatever her name is, Miss Cyanide, ms cyanide, which of these concerts now listen, you gotta go? Yeah, go watch the whole show. So we have Nick Hawk doing his repartee wraps. We have the Beverly hills plastic surgeon who like I dedicated. A lot of times when you're in surgery, you need something to go wrong. Otherwise what are you there to fix? Okay. That guy. And he's like, okay, he's last. Right. I just, I just decided this last, I think he's last. I think it's the hardest one because here's why it's bad, but it's bad in something that I, that wouldn't necessarily, like if it was good, you know, it's not even your John. Right, right. So just so I feel like I could have a lot more laughs and a lot more fun even with it being bad at nick. I know that, you know, that's a problem is that there's so much more to laugh at at nick. The nick hoc show. Yeah. Cause he's gonna be, you know, posturing real sincere Yang and yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ms Cyanide is just kind of sloppy and all over the place. Yeah. What I've seen so far, she's a little more Polish. Yeah. One more time.

Speaker 18:         01:19:48       Take me down. I'm, that's your play in this song now.

Speaker 9:          01:19:55       It was rad.

Speaker 4:          01:19:57       Yeah. About haters and the shit that you deal with people because I'm, I'm up here, I'm feeling great. I'm on top of it. I'm doing what you said I couldn't do. Yeah. Cyanide is a and the juggle at BD pageant that's held on the last day of the gathering every year. Alright. Oh, I liked this. I like the cyanide going for it. I did too. And I will say of all three at least, she's really kind of in it like she's genuinely one thing more than at this than I do at traditional beauty pageants is that they're really doing, this is obviously the talent portion so far. We know that one of them raps and one of them shoved them Mike up or coach. And I would rather see that at Miss America than that bullshit when they're looking at head fucking and I flipped this in the air and then I catch it might not be the best if they're like, I can hide this in my pussy.

Speaker 4:          01:20:47       Yeah, that's Ms Iowa. Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah. The, I understand it's to subvert beauty pageants then why have a beauty pageant at all? Like when not be the ultimate subversion is to just not have a beauty pageant. Well, no, because I think in this case what they're saying is those beauty pageants are so misguided and, and their interpretation of beauty. So one dimensional that we're going to bring women to the table that aren't traditionally beautiful. Right. And the one who shoves a microphone up or pussy is the fucking best. Clearly not where the wrapper and their talents. So that's kind of cool.

Speaker 19:         01:21:27       Last year sign I participated for the first time she kind of blew it, but she's been practicing law

Speaker 4:          01:21:36       summer to get back on stage of it. For her I was really nervous and I got really, really fucking high. Like before I was like I got smoke a bowl and my brain was like, oh fuck you forgot the rest of your lyrics. I like her, hey, you know why she saw her mistake? She knew how to correct it and she's going to move on. Actually the thing I respect the most is that she went back. That's good for dude. That's tough. Huge fan of cyanide already. I wouldn't want to watch wraps that long. Has um, has fucken as a comedian forgotten the line for sure. Panic inducing. It's the worse. That's why I don't do drugs. I can't even really drink coffee before shows. I don't like to do anything before it either. Do it straight

Speaker 19:         01:22:16       cyanide pack, 300 Jello shots and most of the belongings in our home before setting off

Speaker 4:          01:22:21       someone might not have a good second year at this maybe,

Speaker 19:         01:22:24       which she in fact had had been saving up for all year. Oh Man.

Speaker 4:          01:22:28       This is like their whole life. No, they love it. She spending it on Jello shots. Good for them. Gassing up the van, back kid and I are going to go rip it a wrap. All right man. I'm actually really into this now. Yeah. Um, I like this look. Actually I'm being serious. I like a ball hog. I've always liked him. All you have always like, are you going to do it to our son now you don't like it when Peter wrote the kids, can I tell you something? I don't like to inflict my personal style on a kid. It's like it. Unless he asks for it. It's not my place. I know I like the Ramones is my kid. I have to like the Ramones. He's not an extension of me. He's his own little dude. Do I want to put clash shirts on my kid? Yeah, but I won't. It's his fucking, he's a person I don't like when people do that. Fuck this always happens to me.

Speaker 4:          01:23:22       You don't like doing that at all, right? It's just not fair. It's like he didn't ask to be a fan of the shit that I like. Yeah. Here we go. We have an after party with Dj Clay, which is gonna be quite the same. Holy Shit. That just more like we can do a lot of really ratchet stuff about getting in trouble. Yes, exactly. Gears. Awesome. That'll be here. And what about that too? What about that is my first, this is what I'm talking about now. I didn't realize that these were just like soggy underwear that he's wearing. I thought this was an actual short and not so much into the front of the outfit. I'm into the back of it though. But what about this part of the front? I like that. I like that. I like what it stands for. A dues red. Huh? Super.

Speaker 4:          01:24:09       It's a lot of crazy tattoos here. Is this a grenade on his hand? I liked her. She is just like, Hey, what's up? She's like, yeah, this is normal. He's like, this is how I roll. Well, Gigi Allen, look, little shout out. He's wearing the same GG. If you combine the girls clip from earlier about eating ass, you look at this. I feel like a lot of what she said would come true in here. It wouldn't smell great. Wouldn't taste the best, but overall not that bad. Not that bad. Yeah. What do you think? And I was better than it used to. I think this guy has got the worst ass. If anybody in the world. No, but bad because bad. What'd you eat? His ass. No, I would not, but I don't think it would smell good either. Let's jump ahead to Miss Miss Sinai's performance. I want to see. Yeah. Does she redeem herself this year? Well here, this is bright before she goes up. I think right here. Poor girl. I hope she's been practicing in front of audiences. That's the key.

Speaker 9:          01:25:18       There's a lot more people out there. Then last year when I did this, I was like, wow,

Speaker 4:          01:25:25       you can do it. She's nervous. Come on, Batman. Come on. Come on home girl. Um, so this is a clip here where, let's see. There's some good, all right. There's goods and contestants. Or is this a drawing that looks like a tattoo baby boy, baby. Here she goes. I got one. I'm so invested in Ms Cyanide now. Yeah. I want to know she

Speaker 9:          01:25:58       [inaudible].

Speaker 18:         01:26:17       Okay,

Speaker 2:          01:26:23       I'll tell you this already. I like it. Her live performance is better than her booth performance. You know when the one that she did at home

Speaker 6:          01:26:31       had a fraction of this energy? Well, she's feeling it. She's the, she's fucking on it. I think she's, she's killing me.

Speaker 18:         01:26:39       Yeah. Whoa. My feeling is that awesome.

Speaker 2:          01:26:53       So she's, she's feeling good about herself right now. Here's what you've been waiting for. Jeans, the, uh, the results. So you ready? We have the results. Do you think how you think she did? Yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:27:04       I'd say she killed it. But knowing that last year someone put a microphone up there, Posey and won, she's going to get beaten up by some dumb cunt that does something stupid. Just like everything in Showbiz. Yeah. Right. Here we go.

Speaker 9:          01:27:29       Testing.

Speaker 18:         01:27:36       What's her fucking,

Speaker 2:          01:27:42       I don't know what else she did. What she did. I don't know. Well, so what ms up cyanide.

Speaker 6:          01:27:48       I will, I'll vote for you. Good job. We support you. Well, good for her. That's really hard to do now. I thought the Juggalos were supposed to be nonjudgmental. Ooh, yeah, yeah. That about you're not supposed to boot people off stage.

Speaker 2:          01:28:03       Um, by the way, I ordered my DJ equipment through your mom's house podcasts that come right. And it was on banner. I can see your eyes roll, just so you know. Yeah, I got speakers. I got, uh, I got the time. Are we done the show? Is it? Yeah, we got to get everything wrapped up already. Yeah. Oh yeah. We got to get into this. So last week we did a fill her up right. Sealers, song contest. Right. Here's what happened. We have a tie to submissions have gotten the most amount of votes, but then a wildcard, late submission came in and blue band deemed it's so good and he said we have to listen to it. Okay, so first I'll play you the first two. Um, the first two that, that have the highest votes so far in the contest. Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:28:55       Hello.

Speaker 4:          01:29:03       Just us from John. Love it. This one from Holly. Clean too concise.

Speaker 3:          01:29:24       Yolo. Ready to do this shit man. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:29:47       All right. So that's by Ali also. Great. And then here's the, uh, the late submission that, uh, I haven't even heard yet, but I've heard is good from Rick. Here we go.

Speaker 14:         01:30:00       She's like a machine. You just want to fill holes with them anyway. Really like twice.

Speaker 14:         01:30:24       I'll tell you what I did. This was really great. It also stuck to the Latin flavor of curry thing. Pretty good man. That's really good. Well, might as well play around it. Filler up sealer shy, what do you say? Yeah. Okay. So tell her up and steal her shot. Presidential presidential edition. The presidential nominee is issue, right? So we have Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders. Yes. For the men. Right. What are you thinking? Yeah. What do you thinking in terms of those two? Because that's not exactly the most desirable filler up material as a lady. What you know about it either. That's why it's a good one.

Speaker 4:          01:31:19       It's good when they're both really, really hot or both really, really not. The thing is okay. Right, okay. Yeah. Is that you want to separate the personality from the Sexual Act. That's always the key to a successful fill her up. Right. Cause you don't, you're not really talking about the person, but you're letting the personality, sexual side, you're letting the personality dictate what the sexuality is in a way. Right, right. I mean I kind of imagine it's obvious that Donald is a selfish megalomaniac, narcissistic and sergeant historical. It's going to be a horrible, yeah, but Bernie's so timid and such a Beta male that it might be just really horrendous and he's old. He just got into that. I got to say that guy knows how to eat a box. Bernie, why'd he say that? I could just see it. I just feel like it's, it's part of the foundation.

Speaker 4:          01:32:16       At his funeral there are going to talk about how he used to eat pussy like nobody else. I can feel it. Know he was part of those civil rights marches and things. I mean, he's a giver. You know a guy cares about the other man or in the case of in the bed, you care. He wants you to finish first. That's what he's all about. But I don't want it to last very long. Like I kind of almost want the selfish lay here so that it's just over like Trump, just big arcs and then we'll get, get the fuck outta here. You know what I mean? And will tell you to get the fuck out. Right? For sure. Tell him good luck.

Speaker 4:          01:32:51       Good luck. In that case. I don't want this to be a drawn out because Bernie, he's going to light the candles were talking sensible masage lavender smells to question the hundred candle bath. What's wrong with that? I don't want it with Bernie grain last. He's a sexy mailman man. Unless he got the mailman length. I think conversation would be fascinating. I think you'd have a nice, I don't want that. Okay. Oh, you just want to get yours off. I just want to get in and get out of this ordeal. No, I want to get out of the filler up sealer shut. I don't want to participate in this one. Okay. So I just want to get in and out quick and the Donald is going to be the easiest way out. Wow. I got to tell you. Real curve ball. Didn't expect that answer. Real.

Speaker 4:          01:33:39       What are you? You're picking Bernie. Oh, massage. First of all, you know, he would be like, I'm not a gay man. I know you're not a gay man, but we both got to come. So, uh, what do you need me to do your bowls? And I'd be like, Bernie, just do what you would do to your own balls, you know? And I think he would be, yeah, I think, I think it would be unbearable with, with the done bearable. But then again, he's just like a frat boy as a man. Choosing between those two. I think it's much easier. Maybe because I can't speak as a woman, as a man, you gotta go with Bernie. He's going to be much more gentle, much more caring. He's still going to be like, do you come to go? And he'll be nice and there's more involved with but fucking them or as vaginal. Donald's just going to come in drunk like a frat guy and just prison pound you and it'll be done in 30 seconds and I'll throw a towel you and they'll be like, great. And sod gate. Huge suck. You gotta drink some of that milk. Okay. And the next for the ladies. So you and I are opposed on this issue, this highway high ticket items are we? And the next one is Hillary or the fear in her Nina. Carly Fiorina. Carla Lorela. Lafonda Nina.

Speaker 2:          01:34:59       For me it's easy. Carly has that ice queen. Fucking almost like dominatrix lecturer from house of farts. Yeah. Ah, I like Carly's style. Meaning she's a meanie and like it, it turns me on, I feel like, and she was the CEO, I think of IBM. So I'd be like, what are out what our acquisitions and mergers lately. Tell me about like the first IPO you where it should be like eat this from behind. You know, we like her, but that's more of a power bitch. Yeah. She was a total power bitch and um, I could see myself being very excited by her.

Speaker 4:          01:35:39       See, I think Hillary is your classic closet. Lez She's definitely a lesson college. Yeah. And then she was like, I can't be gay because I got, I want this political life. I got Mary, I'll bill here. Bill seems acceptable. So I think Hillary is a varsity level. Lez and if you want to go with that experience, she's your girl. She's got years of eating box experience. I bet. Wow. See I think, I feel like Carly would put cigarettes out on my mouth. Yeah. She wet and then she'd be like, I gotta pee. I'd be like, okay, I'll wait here. And she'd be like, no, open up your mouth. Okay. I mean, should piss out the ass. She's alone more. Yeah. Domineering and whatnot. I know, I'm excited thinking about like it's actually going to happen. I think Carly's over using Carly emceeing. Carla. Yeah. Yeah. But I feel like she's too, yeah, I dunno. I don't want to power budge. I can't deal with it really well cause I'm kind of an Alpha. I think Hillary's more of like the seventies college list. That's what you want.

Speaker 2:          01:36:40       Yeah. I like when I'm old Carly, like here's, here's Carly. I'm eating her butt. And then she's looking back, like you said, all you got. Right. You see, I mean, it's just, this is attractive. Right, right, right. I like her. I know Trump made a horrific comment about, no, I feel like Douche bag. I think between the two, there's no context for me.

Speaker 4:          01:37:03       I disagree. I think aesthetically I like Hillary. What's better? I'm, I like blondes, you know? Yeah. I'm partial to, I'd never been out with a blonde before. Really?

Speaker 2:          01:37:14       Nope. Um, yeah. This here, right?

Speaker 4:          01:37:17       This is, this is me. This is her. After I come look right, they come in those balls. She was like, you got any common those bulls and then I do. And then she goes, that's it. No, she insults the come load, the amount of load. You call that a load there. You call that a load. Yeah. Yeah. [inaudible] look small. Mm. How many balls do you have? Half of one. Yeah. Not impressed as fiar Nina. I go, where should I come? And she goes right over here.

Speaker 2:          01:37:51       Ah, yeah. Yep. That would be it. Yeah. I like her. I choose her. I can't believe you're choosing Hillary, but it makes sense. Well, I know, but you're right that maybe she has a lot of less experience.

Speaker 4:          01:38:03       Countless. I, I, I wouldn't be surprised that she really knows her. She knows all the tricks and she's from that era of like, there's the protests, uh, heroin, Billy and yeah, college. She's got that classic Lez 60 seventies bless. Like full Bush, uh, free love. Lez Right. That's the violent one. Yeah. Yeah. Just like whatever man would you got? I'll tell you get like, just free love and Farley puts a leash on me. She was like, come on man. It's a different energy altogether. She's too dominant for me. It's not going to work.

Speaker 2:          01:38:37       We have a, what's it sound to go out to? There's a o, m c. Oh, see now I'm saying no. Saying there's a challenge and then there's a disk. Which one should I play?
