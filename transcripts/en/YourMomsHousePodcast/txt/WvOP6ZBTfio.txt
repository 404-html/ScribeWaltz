And you wake up and you tell me I saw you on top of the sheets. Yeah, because it's not cold. I want it freezes. I do that as a courtesy. You know what? The only time I enjoyed, we enjoyed the same temperature was when I was pregnant with Ellis. Yeah. That was like you were hot too. Cause it was hot all the time. It's the only time in my life. Well misery, if you haven't yet figured it out. We've, we have found, uh, the male equivalent to, to Danny.

Speaker 5:          00:09:09       You do copious amounts of cocaine with her. So the point I thought my heart was going to stop, she told me to calm down, gave me a drink.

Speaker 5:          00:09:22       And I don't know it was in the drink, but I blacked out. And when I woke up, she had both of my legs over her shoulders. She was numb, sucking my asshole. There was no tomorrow.

Speaker 3:          00:09:36       What's numb? Psyching, making it now. Really going at it.

Speaker 5:          00:09:40       I tried to find it. I tried to get away, but I was restrained. She told me that I liked it. She told me not to worry because she used the good jelly. The schmuck goes,

Speaker 6:          00:09:53       okay.

Speaker 5:          00:09:54       I like schmuck. Nobody's paid me to confess this now. And I've kept it under wraps for all these years because I knew that no one would believe me. No, no one really believe that Hillary Clinton eight. My asshole.

Speaker 3:          00:10:09       Wow. Shocking him. Shocking revelation. I mean, I'm surprised Hillary hasn't. Uh, Hillary responded eight Ryan sticklers asshole. It does. Except Ryan hasn't go to believe that Hillary Clinton name my asshole. A crab feast suite at Ryan sickler. Did Hillary Clinton really eat your asshole? Fuck the crab feast. Now here's how you know someone's crazy. We put his image back up.

Speaker 5:          00:10:41       Well, nobody's paid me to confess test.

Speaker 3:          00:10:45       Oh my God. You can always tell crazy by the darkness of the beard proportionate to one's age. Oh yeah. He definitely nice and easy. That one. I think so. Yeah. It's not really in focus though. It might be a little grayer than we think. Remember they got in our old neighborhood that used to take a permanent, like a sharpie and Showbie his we are not real crazy. That's in the Rampart division. I drove through there years later and I saw him look good for him. What's he up to? Just keep holding the block down and doing what he does. He used to be on the corner where the Carl's Jr was any of that bench and he was just sitting there all the time. It'd be south of six right often be south of six. Yeah. Wherever that Carlos is. Mm. That was a really good, Carl's junior by the way. Yeah, I'm really good. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:11:34       wow. I don't worry Clinton, my asshole.

Speaker 3:          00:11:38       I'm surprised she hasn't responded. Really. That's a huge alligator for a minute. I mean, she's still getting over this election, you know, she's still figuring it out.

Speaker 5:          00:11:46       Yeah. Both of my legs over her shoulders. Huh?

Speaker 3:          00:11:49       I wish I could. I hope I can testify to the same thing one day with hills with you. Oh, well we all know that's going to happen. She had both of my legs over her shoulders. Yana, yeah. What would you, would you have Hillary do this to you? Let's say I can't, okay. I give you permission. Can Hillary do this to you? Yeah, of course. You wouldn't mind. Why would I mind? She's a little bossy. That's fine. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure it wouldn't be that fun, but I mean I would still do it. Yeah. I think I would just do it for the story. I think hills would be fine with it. For you and are any idea what kind of story that is? I can't believe it happened. I know. I mean this guy's telling him through his youtube channel, but yeah, it must have happened before she was married to bill.

Speaker 3:          00:12:35       I don't think that's what he's saying. Oh, you think this is like recent? Of course. Wow. Recent as in at least during their marriage. I don't think it was a 40 year old story. Wow. How many youtube videos will be coming out about what you, you've been doing on the road, your road beef stories, road vive. As the name of my new book I'm pitching right now. Road B road beef of life on the road. You never got road beef. Now he gives you and I got together kind of, Hey, what, what? No, I didn't, we didn't get rid of beef. I've never gotten road baby. The closest I came to Rhode beef I guess is technically road vive was before we were together. I did a spot in uh, orange county. Yeah. Like a bar show. So it wasn't even a club show and some girl at the show, I was like, I dunno, I, I was not how I normally come on.

Speaker 3:          00:13:31       I did a fake confidence thing. I was like, come in here and watch this, you know? Yeah, yeah. And then we kind of made out afterwards. Yeah. This is the first I've heard of it. Yeah. And then she got a hotel room and here's the thing, I was like, oh, like I'm gonna, you know, I'm going to shove it in. And then she was like, oh no, my friends come and now and then her friend showed up and uh, her friend was like looking at me like, what is going on? Like it was the nerd friend who was like, oh, she wasn't like a, like they weren't going to double team. You know who's the nerd friend who was like, Samantha, who is this guy? Cause he's a comedian. It was so funny the way she said it too. Like she said it like he's a fireman.

Speaker 3:          00:14:17       That's just, you know, it was saving me. That's why he's here. He's a community. It was like, uh Huh. Nice to meet you. And I was like, well nothing happened. That's it. Yeah. That's good. I came to root cause we started dating when I was super young. You could have like bang, both of those checks. No one of them possible if, if nerd alert hadn't showed up this shitty friend too bad one time I got preposition to get in a hot tub. There is a small club in a small town in Florida and the owner and his wife had huge fakers. Yeah. And, uh, they, they were like, after the show, they were like, to me the headliner there. We know we have a hot tub back at our place. And uh, and I was like, oh, really? That sounds terrible. I'm not, I don't do that.

Speaker 3:          00:15:04       Like I don't want to rob, Rob, rob. That's when you and I were engaged. You didn't, you didn't go to the hot tub? I'd rather kill myself. No. Why? I'm just not that perse. I'm not fun like that. I have a good personality, but I'm not the sexuality champ. That's like the slut champ. Yeah, that'd be a good story. You'd be like, so where to find a double team? This owner and his wife, they're not cute. Not Cute. I don't know. I'm not that free. I'm really not that open. Some nervous. I'd be so weirded out. Like I guess some people can do that stuff, obviously. I'm just not that free. I'm, I'm real closed off.

Speaker 3:          00:15:47       I'd be so nervous when it you to what? To do that? Like I get a hot tub with like a married couple and then it depends on the setting. I don't know. Strangers go. It depends on like the, in other words I guess if they're like come over to my house. Yeah, I'd be nervous if you're staying at a hotel and there was people around and it's like, oh yeah, the hot tub. Okay. Oh right. Cause then you could just go to your room and you have a way out. Yeah. It's like, but like if someone's like, come over, it was good in the hot tub. Yeah. I would be nervous. But I think roofie you and put stuff in your, but only they want to do that. But if they did, do you think your bark will be less tonight? That I can sleep in our marital bed.

Speaker 3:          00:16:30       I think we may have a chance tonight. Maybe truth be told, I kind of like my little ventless. Yeah, cause you like he, it's hot here right now. Now it's not. I want to make it cooler again. I like the freedom. I don't have to hear dogs scratching and you snoring or working. And it's kind of like my own little private Idaho. Well, I'll give a shout out to old wheeler who, uh, came through last week. That was great. That was great. Except that my camera wasn't working and that's a problem. But that was my fault I think. Yeah. It wasn't in any of the videos, so that's probably why you liked it so much. That episode. That's true. That's true. It really is warm in here. Stop Yourself. It's true. It's not. It's 74. It's freezing. It's warm. There's lights on. It's hot. Maybe it's cause you're wearing a long sleeve tee.

Speaker 3:          00:17:24       It's fine. It's light. It's just an undershirt. No. How can men do that? I was watching that movie last night. They were like a white tank under a white. See through. That doesn't look good, right? Oh my God, I was a a war machine. Well that doesn't look, but then all you see is the tank through the, the white shirt. That doesn't look good. It looks weird. But I guess what are your options, I guess as a man? Are you done now ruining my life? I hate when you do this. It's so cold. When will you be happy? It feels normal. You know, we had our closet remodeled, we didn't even talk about this. We didn't have a closet for like three weeks. So hard. It was hard actually not having anywhere to put your stuff. And what we realized is that Tom and I have nothing. We have no clothes, we can't even fill it. And I realized that I only own lounge pants. Like I have, like I'm becoming loungy pants and a 40 year old woman mom and all I own is like comfortable shit. And then the most comfortable stuff, we only wear like two or three things. Yeah, it's fine with me. I don't mind that either. I dedicated an entire drawer to just black tops. I love it. Just black.

Speaker 2:          00:18:43       Yeah. I have a lot of the same tee shirts over and over for, it's what I like that there's no need or thought I had more. I have nothing. I like it that way. No, I don't want to get overwhelmed with, cause I'm always trying to get rid of stuff anyways.

Speaker 3:          00:18:57       Yeah. We're always decluttering in this house, sell there. Uh, so we invited, we've been sick this week. Of course. The minute. Yeah, we, I got home from Seattle and the kid is sick and then we got the cold. Everybody's sick. Um, but you invited cousin Bri Bri over on Sunday and they have a little one as well. And you kind of, I mean we're on the line of not contagious anymore, honestly. But as a, as a parent courtesy, you kind of take, you err on the side of caution and you go like, ah, maybe we shouldn't let that baby around our baby who's still got a snotty nose. But you are like, screw it and invite him over.

Speaker 2:          00:19:40       Well, here's the thing. This is our second time making plans with them. Yeah. And the, the last time that we made plans with them, I canceled like two hours before when I had that stomach thing going on. Diarrhea. But that's because I was taking, I was sick. I was taking an antibiotic that gave me diarrhea. Yeah. And my parents were in town. It was terrible. So now it's like, it's the end of a cold. The boy is much better. I'm feeling better now. I was a little Shitty, but I knew I was on the way out so it was like I could call him and give him a warning, but I know how cautious he is and the warning he would take too seriously. So I was like, I just won't give them a warning and then maybe when he gets here he'll be like, oh I get nervous and you like that. And I thought that'd be funny. Yeah, to watch them sweat a little bit. But he didn't at all. He did great. Yeah, he really was a little excited about it. I was like, oh maybe he'll be, yeah, maybe he'll be like extra cautious, but I think is funny. Yeah, I like, I like that too when people get freaked out cause I get freaked out. I'm like this, it's like this kind of thing. Do you think this is horrible or hilarious?

Speaker 3:          00:20:59       It's a guy's driving a golf cart and they went up like over a small, like a dirt hill. I guess it was probably a, maybe an eight foot, 10 foot hill and then their cart flip them off of the front. I like golf carts and, and silliness and golf carts. So I'm going to go for funny. Yeah. Because they knew what they were getting into. They could have gotten really hurt right there. They could have what? They've made a choice and they did it and yeah. They don't look, I don't know. Yeah. Golf carts. Shit's hilarious to me. It's so much fun. Golkar really held up. I thought it would flip or something. It's just, yeah, I kind of held up really well this is like, um, that true TV show I used to do. Yeah. Where it was, it was like wild is TV, right?

Speaker 3:          00:21:41       Yeah. This is all the videos we cover and then I have to be like the next time the guy says that you gotta do that. Like you'd have your dark jokes from race to write like tons, tons of jokes for these kinds of clips. Yeah. Very. The, the, um, when you watch those shows in mind numbing, you could tell which jokes were written by the producers and which jokes written by the world's dumbest. That was the name of the show because the producers jokes were like pretty sure the worse, yeah, yeah, yeah. It would feed to feed us, try to feed us jokes on, um, the, the other true TV show. How do we have to be a grown up? And we'd be like, no, we never did. I don't want to say that. You want to say that? Can you say a version of that?

Speaker 3:          00:22:16       No, I know I sell that. They used to give me a sheet of jokes and there was a couple of writers I really like their shit and I could tell who wrote and I'd be like, oh, I like that. I'll say that, but literally just 20 that I'd be like, pass, pass, pass. We had a really funny producer once and we had a really unfunded producer on that. But yeah, they would, they would be like, can you say it without cursing? And I'd be like, okay, I guess I fucking can. Yeah, sure. Fuck face and be like, all right. I remember the guy that was a bad director for us. Like he would come in just stone faced, which you can't do to colleagues. You can't just be like totally anatomy did I know? So it doesn't play. No. So weird. Um, another observation did I have, oh, well I'm very observant.

Speaker 3:          00:23:06       I am the, um, observation champ. So, uh, as you know, 4th of July. Is that tomorrow? Yeah. And you and I were just talking about how we could give zero fucks about 4th of July and seeing fireworks. No care. No, I don't care. I can't, I can't remember the last time I do photos of them. Right. I think the photos of the fireworks are the dumbest July 5th, when every asshole post pictures of fireworks. I mean, there's nothing worse. Like a frame uninspiring of the before the flare out please. You like, you just see like five dots. Right. You know, you're like, oh, in a, in a moment. This a, a big thing. His, here's the moment before that. But it just doesn't translate. And the glory of live fireworks versus your tiny little shitty camera picked. It's like taking a picture of the moon. Yeah. Look at the moon. I like it doesn't translate right.

Speaker 3:          00:23:58       Here's these clouds, but that doesn't translate. Clouds are clouds or even down in the fireworks. Yeah, I'm seeing fireworks, but I can't think of a of a thing worse. Like you have to park, you go to the, the local community college or wherever they're showing the fireworks. You just sit around with a bunch of assholes. It's, it's terrible. I hate when it's a big crowd. I don't like big crowds. There's nowhere to pee. Yeah, we're, can I say? Yeah. And then the other thing is like on a day like that, you find a place to pee and then it's a, it's a beverage consumption day. Yeah. So right away you go back to where your group is, you're drinking again. You're like, shit, I gotta go back. Yeah. That always happens to me. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's like, that's why I hate being at places like that.

Speaker 3:          00:24:46       So do I just cause I want a comfortable place to pee or Porta potties. Disgusting. So then, and then you need a bracelet to get back into the thing or wherever. Like ah boy, get your life. I'm not even doing it. Concerts. That's way concerts piss me. Hey concerts too. Even a sporting event, you know, you go, it's like drinking beers. I gotta pee. Where is it? Well you got to walk up these six flights of stairs, right? And then you're what? Oh, you're on. Okay. So on Terminal One you go left down and go to l l O it's only a women's. Oh, sorry. So you go back through, go to the k gate and there's a restroom there and you're like Jesus Christ and do all that. You get your other beverage and you're like, I gotta pee again. A nightmare. That sucks. And then your food options are limited.

Speaker 3:          00:25:31       It's like a hot dog and a hot dog, which I love hot dogs, but I can't, you know, I can't do that. It make me feel sick now to eat them. Yeah. Can't do it at 40 it's like over fuck a firework. Showman. And whether the neat part is in La, I'm sure everywhere. But you get to hear people shooting guns and shooting Stata guns go off. Yeah. Yeah. You get to hear it. Two days before 4th of July or a week before and then a week after Jesus. What are you doing? Why are you shooting guns in the sky? Morons do want to hear this song. That DJ boy butter set in. Yeah. It's called be retarded. He took the, would you rather be with my parents? I mean, he's done some amazing songs already, but this is his latest one. That's really great.

Speaker 4:          00:26:17       Would you rather be retarded or you have to drive on the freeway. Okay. Okay. To retired then pass. That's fine. Would you rather have four penises on your forehead? I dog penis in my foods type or pills. I can probably handle them up with Nancy balls. Okay. She's got a nice set of lungs. Okay. She's had some work done. All right. Okay. You'll get upset with it. Okay. Okay. Oh Shit. Yeah. Would you rather only eat Asian food? No, I go retarded.

Speaker 7:          00:27:13       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:27:15       I'm not going to eat dog. Okay. Oh Shit.

Speaker 7:          00:27:25       Amazing. That's so funny. I like that. Your Dad, you're going to be retired.

Speaker 3:          00:27:29       That's fine. Okay. Okay. I'd rather go retarded. Does he say Gallery Darden? I'd go retired. Yeah. Uh, I love your dad's hatred of Asian food, which you know, I think that's one of my favorites. Is Asian girl retarded? Yeah, they created the noodle. Oh my God. I mean Asian suppressed. I think if they, they gave this scenario to everyone on earth, there'd be one retarded guy walking around. It'd be my dad and everybody else would be like, this food is delicious. Asian foods the best for so many different kinds. Too many options. Yeah. You could do something that I'm going to use dog. Alright. He's serious. That shows you how underexposed to this cuisine he is. He just telling him the stereotypical worst thing that exists now. You can dog. I love my dogs. They no need. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, look, when I was in Korea, they did warn us not to eat the street meat cause there was, there were reports of dog meat being sold.

Speaker 3:          00:28:34       Yeah. That's those in Seoul. I don't know, but that's my outcome on, yeah. He don't eat dog all the time. You just said that like, like him though. He said yeah, come on. Come on, come on. Okay. Alright. Okay. Alright. Alright. Today he goes, we were, we were face timing cause LJ was playing. It'd being adorable. Yeah, it does put Christina get over here. Yeah. Didn't you see that today? I was like, Oh shit. He got his power suit on today. You were in a suit. He got a suit on. I know you were saying that, that he always dressed that way when you were a kid. You saw it everyday at work every day. And then the khaki this, that's how that came. That's dressed down. That's why that stuff down because for him and technically is dressed down, it sure is. Yeah. He looks handsome in his suit.

Speaker 3:          00:29:19       Sure. So it looks great on most guys. Yeah. If you look like shit a suit, yeah. It really cleans up your whole act. And the one thing that we talk about it a lot, he and I do. Um, I can, I all right is if you wear this one thing that's fun is to watch how people treat you differently because they do it. Yeah. You're gonna like the way you look, they treat you weigh guarantee to just make assumptions about you in a good way usually. Yeah. Dressing up is a, is a huge factor. People assume that you're richer, smarter, everything. Yeah. They assume that you, that you have your shit together more. I mean, cause you and I are, you've gone car shopping and you said that people will be, oh my God mean to you. Belittling to you. They have basically walked me out of dealerships cause you look like a homeless. Uh, it's weird derelicts. It's La La is a, a well known dressed down place. Yeah. People dress down here. Oh you'd be a billionaire and you look like a scumbag. And I've walked in and they're like, are you like taking pictures of cars?

Speaker 2:          00:30:18       Was going to shopping for one and they're like, uh Huh. Um, yeah. And then there'll be like, this is, you know, this is not a free car. Was that a contest? I'll be like, I know man. Yeah. And they like, just keep looking at you. And they're like, are you sure you don't want to see the other? Like they'll talk me like you want to see the cheaper one? I'm like, what is it going on? And I feel like I have to be like, no, I, I, I really am here to actually buy a car. Do you think it's the beard? I guess that's a whole look. I guess Camilo says, um, I'm going to steal something I guess.

Speaker 3:          00:30:50       Yeah. Interesting. Speaking of Asian cuisines, I had a thought I like to ask you about this. What is that? Which cuisine gives you the worst farts personally? What do you think gives you the smelliest farts?

Speaker 2:          00:31:06       It's a tie between high vegetable content. Oh, and a high seafood content

Speaker 3:          00:31:13       for you. What about like spice and heat cook curry or a, but I mean, I don't think it's, it's the worst

Speaker 2:          00:31:20       of all. No. So I think

Speaker 3:          00:31:23       can we give a nationality of the food or hard to say, I mean,

Speaker 2:          00:31:28       I feel like it's an ingredient. I don't know if you're, if you're going by cuisine. See the thing is, I went to a Sushi place last week that was amazing, but it was really authentic. I mean, the guy is, you know, fresh off the boat, there's no roles. He was like ordering us not to use soy sauce. And I had no digestive issues whatsoever. Really freshest fish, the best stuff I've ever had. But do you go to like a boar, you know, neighborhoody joint and you're getting roles and all that stuff and I blow it up my ass.

Speaker 3:          00:32:00       I think it's the fried component to those roles. Maybe we get that hot night role and it's got shrimp Tempura in it. And I swear that makes you shit. Or the spicy. Manet's but I'm talking about farts. I'm not talking about browns. Yeah. Hmm. I think Vietnamese might give me the worst farts I could co sign on that idea for you. Uh, I used to get far from this place in silver lake that we, we lived when we lived there and I swear those farts, we're just rancid. Yeah. Rotten, rotten, rotten, rotten. I feel like you have a few places that do bad things to you. Ty is like, oh, that's an instant fart maker. They may as well just call it far. Makings Fart. Make Curry Fart car rate. Oh, when I was in San man friend disco, that's what did me in Penang Curry before my show and that they, they texted me like, are you telling, Jeez, I had to finish my shit.

Speaker 4:          00:32:58       Wow. That's amazing. Jean,

Speaker 2:          00:33:02       do you know we got an email that said hygiene? We all know Bert is fat. Yeah. Right. That's something that we all know. Yeah. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:33:13       well we all, everyone in the world knows that now.

Speaker 2:          00:33:19       So I love the internationally bird is known to be fat as where are you fat? But did you know that burnt Chrysler Sr is on team Tommy. Wow. Wow. Glass in through an old 1997 rolling stone article about Bart's partying. Stan Ama. I came across this amazing blurb. Burt's father hated Burt's goatee. He wants offered Burt $500 to get rid of it. The only reason Burt had grown it out was to cover his double chin, but for the bucks he shaved it off, seeing it gone. The first thing his father had said was fat boy. Wow. Oh boy. Listen to those big tits. Fart. Love Umami Ryan from Schlong Guyland Jude Dork. Wow. Wow. We have to bring that up to Barton person. I had no idea about that. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:34:14       you've been taking a lot of shifts every day. I feel like too many. I think we can ask our audience, how many shifts a day do you take? I don't take a ridiculous amount at all. Downloaded a counter app just like it. Keep track for it to go from one to two. Well or three. You say you had three in a day and that's normal. That was not, it was normal. I'll look on our next door APP. Somebody writes wanting to set up a compost pile.

Speaker 4:          00:34:42       Oh,

Speaker 3:          00:34:44       I love, I think of nothing worse

Speaker 2:          00:34:49       here. Gene, read this. You know, I'm thinking this is your wheel house. Gosh, out loud.

Speaker 3:          00:34:55       Hey, hey guys. I was listening to the podcast the other day and you were talking about people talking loudly on the phone or watching videos that are ridiculous volume. This is my ultimate pet peeve. I'm a fireman and I work in a lower income neighborhood. Well, the other day the crew was walking into the grocery store and there was a guy standing out front listening to music on a Fucking Dre Beats Bluetooth speakers on fucking 11 at that instant, I completely forgot that I was in my uniform and went into a rage in my head. The only thing I could do, mind you, this isn't a predominantly black neighborhood. I'm about as white as they come. The funniest part is to do, just looked at me, turned down his speaker and went feel you and word. So I guess your theory is right. If you're a black voice is on point, it will elicit a response. Fireman, Mike, I guess if you're black voices, I'm going, why did you, uh, I'm not going to say the n word anymore. I am not going to say we're reading an email. It's a guy, not a girl. But why don't you always feel like I'm reading something and I'm repeating. Something will change. I just, I can't take the abuse because I don't want the songs to come in and the remixes, all. Anyone wants it.

Speaker 3:          00:36:19       All right, I'll give it to you. He turned down a speaker. I went feel you Nigga. Why would you say that? So I guess your theory is right for black boys. Don't point it will elicit a response. I yelled, headphones. I can't believe you actually said it. I know. I just, yeah, I don't think I read that part. The only thing, I didn't read that part, I'm sorry. The only thing I could do, what was take a page from Tom's book. Sorry, I skipped a line. So basically this guy yelled headphones and the best black guy voice I can do. So he yelled it's headphones. Headphones, like you do bikes. I skipped a line. Yeah. Oh, that's so funny. And then he was like, all right, man. That's so funny. That's so funny. Can I read an email? Very important to and of course high Hitler's a couple of times in the last two weeks I've noticed something interesting when I go to the bathroom at work.

Speaker 3:          00:37:10       We all know about the age old brown cleanup preferences like standing or sitting folding or scrunching and front to back versus back to front. But this observation at work had me baffled. How many times do you swipe across your brown maker with a single serving of toilet paper? Personally, for the last 27 years I've been wiping myself. I've only ever done one pass and it's onto a new clean bunch of toilet paper. This guy I heard was going back and forth upwards of 25 times with the same handful of TP. I don't care how clean I think I am. I am not risking the chance of smearing brown all over my, I'm curious, curious, so foul, a common cleanup strategy and what your thoughts on my God, you guys are so disgusting person had one thing I told him, ah, like sandpaper. Well it's all about how many passes you take.

Speaker 3:          00:38:11       Now, he doesn't say I, I'm assuming he means once and then like a fold over and then you go back. But he says the same paper, so it's literally one pass and then again on the same. No, you can't do that. I don't do that. I fold over and then I go and then of course, yeah, no, you have a, you have a thing. Okay. Not do the pass again. So if you have, if you have, if you have this, you would wipe. Yeah, you would fold it. Maybe if it was like Super Chunky, you'd be like, I'm dropping that. Yeah. But if you were trying to conserve you, we folded a second time and then you drop it, drop it. Yeah. Like van go, I'm gonna fold that. And then when I followed that, no, no, but is he saying, come here, give me that piece of paper. I thought what he was saying, is it somebody he's asking something different. He's saying that somebody went like sh yeah, like same piece of paper all in the same way. I think he's asking if it's pass, pass, pass. That's nasty. That's not even worth discussing. Disgusting beyond belief, but I didn't know people were capable of that. I didn't even know that was a, anything you can't do that. You can't go back on the same paper. That is nasty, real nasty. Uh,

Speaker 8:          00:39:32       let's bring it chest and balance is critical to ensuring that your store is built with the h vac system you've specified so that it operates as efficiently and comfortably as possible. The chest and balance from should be independent and what direction to ensure your best interests are represented. The firm should also be certified by a National Organization such as in ebb a, B, c or t a, B B, to ensure basic quality standards are met and industry exempted procedures are used. Cool.

Well, he didn't understand that someone when it looks like when people meet. Fuck. Amen. HBB You want to see a mom boner HPP? Yeah, it's Kinda weird. It's a mom boner, but she's like friendly.

This lady, I feel like we never get to see her and I feel like I could draw a picture of her. Yeah. Me See what I had pictured or what's your picture? Well, it's um, it's dirty blonde. Like she used to bleach, bleach it and now kind of messier. She's tail stringed out. She's got big hoop earrings. She's got a low cut, a sleeveless shirt with like too much like jewelry that doesn't really match up. But there's a lot of it. It's kind of tacky, like maybe three or four necklaces and maybe there's a ring on, you know, eight out of 10 fingers. Right. And some bracelets, a big sloppy hangers. Kimber wine, big old slop. No Bra for sure.

Speaker 3:          00:42:01       Um, she goes through, I dunno, maybe two packs a day and um, she drinks, she has a road cools or no, Virginia slims or something, you know, something long Capris or something. Yeah, she has a lot of roadies. You know, when she goes on, when she gets in the car, it's got a big like tub thing. Some people drink ice tea out of it, but it's like a 32 ounce and she, she has her, her road drink. You know. Interesting. I went dark hair. I'm going to go, uh, big and pretty bad. I don't think so. I think smell can keep, it's supposed to keep you a little trick. I don't think she's five bills, but I think she's like, she's abroad to 20. I'm going to go. Ah, I'm curly. Shoulder length, brown hair and kind of a melody caught not a mullet, but melody where it's shorter on the sides.

Of all the scenarios of human existence, hers would be like, I would rather, I would probably rather be a sex worker in Bangladesh. Have that life than be her. I don't think so. Repeat what you said to yourself out loud a couple times. Visualize sex worker life in Bangladesh. Right? And Making Mousse. It sounds better than this and this woman's life. I don't think so. I mean the fact that you are born in America, I'm assuming she's American, she has all these opportunities afforded, Eh, you know, and you've pissed your life into being a river person who screams at people you know, you failed, you failed. I think it's good. I don't think you want to be a sex worker in Bangladesh. Potato Patato you know what I mean? She's made a lot of bad choices. Grs that. I got that on video. She says,

Speaker 3:          00:45:33       can I, can I say what really annoys me too? I hate that personality where somebody messes up. Like Raymond made a mistake. Clearly. I don't know if he did this intentionally to his friend in a race and then the person has to chastise I j Ray man. Yeah. You went in, you did that wrong. Fucked up. Like they love to pre no harp on the person that did made an innocent mistake or something like that. That makes me crazy. It's like they thrive on making you feel like shit for something. You did hate it. Who Soup?

Speaker 4:          00:46:10       Oh,

Speaker 3:          00:46:17       this is what I feel like a real highlight for her. I think she really enjoys it. Yelling at people. No, I mean like the watching the little boat race. That's why she lives on the river there. O m g and then the laugh dirty. Yeah. What if I would turning into that gross? Would you divorce me? Oh, a hundred percent seriously. Later. Yeah. It would take you a while to turn into that. You can't be that tomorrow. 20 years of smoking. Right, but then I would, yeah, I would take off God damn sleeve. You're making your move soup everyday.

Speaker 3:          00:46:58       That's how you'd get your next guy. He'd be like, Yo, I was single for a while, but then I learned this moose soup recipe and the guys just started coming around. I heard you getting married. Yeah. And we're serving moves soup at the assumption is that the crop stuck in my craw. Hey, okay.

Speaker 4:          00:49:43       Yeah,

Yeah, but she's not going to tie yourself to a tree. This is, this is the proposal and live in the Fart Shetty and I'd be left alone. This is terrible.

Speaker 10:         00:50:19       I want you to know that I will be tying up a real live human for your viewing pleasure. We're going to a tutorial

If you really are in a tree fucking, you're not making videos, you're just doing it and you're, you know, nobody knows. Yeah. Keep it a secret. Hillary Clinton, my asshole. Okay. Seckler sick. So we're that. Ryan would come out with that and never, I would write, I would say that he never told us. G O N J O g Jab Kubo via dad paid you by their paws like Uyg page by Deb both. She's so grody that

Speaker 2:          00:51:59       this is pretty good. Somebody said, uh, I once worked for at best buy for a total of two hours. First hour was doing orientation and I should have know things were not going well. What everyone always had the fakest of smiles boy and I'm being polite to the point of being nauseous. She votes work, opening shift and nightmare of non robot humans cheer squad and volleyball game. Before the opening of the store, I did not participate in the game and when the time came to open should be a roll call. I did not say my name, nor did I clap along to the chance of best buy is the best by Gosh, quickly singled out as non complying. The manager's stared at me and gestured for me to play along. Immediately shaking my head and defiance. Yeah, feeling he had no power. Pulled me aside and told me this is what they do. I need to be a team player or else I won't succeed there. I think he understood what my position was right when I told him to fuck off and walk out of the store. The manager followed me outside and kept asking why I didn't want to participate in the warmup. You felt like a winner when I said nothing and drove off with my middle finger up. Keep it glassy. Chris P s please fuck my triple. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:53:14       Slow way. Good for you. Good for you. I feel such a connection to Chris said a lie. I could not do that. Could not be a part of that at all. It's not worth it. Can I read an email I got okay.

Speaker 11:         00:53:29       Hey, are we are Walmart? We are, we are Walmart.

Speaker 3:          00:53:37       Oh my God. Go ahead. Alright, so we've had many questions about blind people. Uh, how do they wipe? Yeah, I love that you're like, this is real serious. We've got another one. Uh, hi. Hey Hitler's. I was just making it brown and wiping the correct way, but I'm wondering if blind people can be racist. I think they can, but I want to know my main non-binary mommy's thoughts. Also, could retarded people be racist as well? Well, of course. Yes or no question. I'm on. That's a stupid question. Nate. Ps bikes. Well, I mean, obviously retarded people, yes, they can be racist, but Ken Blind people be racist. I'm, I mean, I mean, I look, racism is what based on the color of your skin, that's what people say. Yeah. But I think it's also based on cultural, um, stereotypes. Correct. Yeah. I mean other things too.

Speaker 3:          00:54:36       I mean, a blind person is going to pick up on, uh, somebody, I dunno, some common behavior or a perceived, you know, attitude of, of somebody that they're around and they're also, there's other stimuli, right? So it's like they met somebody and then somebody around them is going to say something like, I use medic. That was Jewish guy. You know what I mean? Like, and then they're going to maybe repeat things to them like, oh, Yep, that's what it, that's what the Jews always do. And then that block is that the blind person just is going to, oh, I can't see, therefore I can't have a perceived, I'm sure it cuts down on racism because, yeah, I mean, they're definitely not because you're not making that snap judgment as quickly. You might go, oh, that guy's real greedy and he's acting Jewy and therefore he's Jesus.

Speaker 3:          00:55:29       But you'll be, you'll be more, you'll be more tentative about your racism is what I'm saying. It won't be as quick. You'll have a real, I think actually being blind makes you more of a pure racist. I loved that. This was the episode. You're like, I'm not gonna say anything. They're not going to get me anymore. And then you just walk into it. Fuck, it's fine. Yeah, it's fine. Look, I don't have hate in my heart, but I was saying that I think we, you could really breed a more pure racist culture with blind people.

Speaker 2:          01:01:31       an active saint. There it is. The buy leads who sculpts till old stuff. I'm so boring today. This is too boring. Was first clearly set on a cat. All right. Yeah, I know. He really did Trump, his accident was was trumped by his boredom when I studied in England and we had to learn about like this kind of thing, like fourth century stone carving, like I don't think there's anything more boring than looking at fourth century stone carvings. I know you're like, God, why are you, and you know what the other thing is about those things is some parts of you sometimes like when you're a kid you go, well later on in life this will be valuable. And then sometimes you look at things you were taught and you go 20 years later you're like, that was, that was as boring as I thought it was and that was as useless

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       as I thought it was. Like when you had the lesson here, that shit dates historical dates and more things happen. I'm like, man, I mean I'm glad I know these things, but I don't know. Yeah, I don't care. Not like humans don't care. No, the average person isn't there. That's what people care about. So we can lose soup. Yeah. Boat Rides. Getting your Dick sucked fucking trees. There you go. Fuck this tree with me so hot. Oh my God, I'm gonna fuck this tree later. It's truly looks like, uh, I hate that kind of stuff. It's, it is so fake. She's so fake. Come on. I love that. That guy quit mid, like first day of work.

Speaker 3:          01:03:00       Uh, well you can't fake it. Oh Wow. Okay. I'm another email. Okay. Okay. Read it. Hi Hitler. I sincerely love both of you in the podcast. Uh, okay. That being said, I seriously cannot stand hearing Christina say that coffee dehydrates you even one more time. It angers me. I know people have thought that since like the 18 hundreds, but if you do a tiny bit of research, you will learn that the dehydration qualities versus the amount of water are far more hydrating than dehydration. Coffee actually do you hide? Sorry. Coffee actually hydrates while making you brown and more alert. Wow. And he writes, Tom, you are forever my water champ. Love Hitler. Privacy's Rup now I don't agree with you. I think that, show me the research. Uh, rob simple Google search. Well, I look, I'll, all I've learned when I've ever been on a diet is they consider like caffeinated tea and coffee to be quote negative waters.

Speaker 3:          01:03:59       Meaning that they are dehydrating. Yeah. And you must replenish them. Then. How come after I drink coffee, I'm fucking thirsty. Thirsty Shit. Interesting. You don't fucking saying I know what you're fucking so it's a diuretic. It makes you piss alcohol. Same thing. I will. Do you agree with this guy? Well I dunno. I mean I think what he's saying is the amount that you're being dehydrated from, maybe the caffeine is outweighed by the amount of water that is in a coffee because coffee is mostly water, right? That's right. But maybe it's negated because it makes you pee so much and you lose more water. The body loses water. I assumed I would like to see more uh, data. So, so what I rob God, you want to see the light champ? You know we have the what, you know what I'm saying? Ship. Yeah. They said this is the leg champ. I might be me

Speaker 12:         01:04:50       mean like it's like there's like, like we do like communication, like more like everyone but like certain guys like are like good at some kind of certain thing. I for example, like someone is good at calling Nash, someone is good at like DP engaged, someone is good at like everyone like give their opinion and then if everyone's just talk each other and they would just choose what like every, everyone thinks that is the best, you know? Oof.

Speaker 3:          01:05:16       I guys nonbinary for sure. Right? Well

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       yeah I'm also like champ. Oh my God. And I say like, so I'm like so do I. But, but he really did an astounding amount. Right? There was a lot like a like for like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like a lot of likes in his defense. I think English is a second language. So maybe searching for same for you. Well I guess that's your defense dad. Get your mail. So O m g DAB. This makes me really happy because he looks like an ash tray. Yes. Gray in color lists and I don't think it gets real ready. I think you can put a lot of stuff on there. You can keep on licking and she's still like your shit. You're like, it's pretty dry. Like, yeah, stays like that, you know, like, um, stays like that. When I smoked cigarettes, my pallor was always gray. Like it does, it like sucks. The very nutrition, the oxygen out of you. You look gray, everything is gray. It's gross. Really bad for you.

Speaker 2:          01:06:36       That's what she says right before she comes. She's like, keep going, keep them. And then her, her eyes rolled back and she goes, so Naz, she, Nancy, Nancy's. How well this is exciting. I'm excited. [inaudible] amaze. Amaze, amaze. Where'd it go? See fireworks the greatest of all time. The greatest actor of all time has a new movie. And we have the trailer. Oh my God. Yes. Oh my gosh. I'm so, is it on Netflix or I don't know if it's going to be on Netflix, so maybe it is. Maybe just straight to youtube. Here it is. Can we read the rotten tomatoes reviews on his films? Yeah. I mean, here's the movie synopsis. Action legends, Steven Seagal headlines. This explosive thriller that pits US forces against Eastern European drug cartel. Oh, great. When crime boss Salazar turns informant US Marshal Jensen and his team must guard their luxury hotel safe house. But as cartel underboss Sinclair who's played by UFC superstar, George Saint Pierre and his hit squads to send a murderer Salazar, this situation explodes in raging agent Harrison played bicycle, who will stop at nothing to root out the mole that compromise

Speaker 3:          01:08:15       the operation. That sounds like a one long set. This sounds like the other, every other movie. It's always the drug guy. And then he's got to train the girl to do martial arts, to go get the guy in the suitcase. So we always lied about who they said they were. I knew that this was my party. This is going to be like do it anymore. And then there's a girl, there's always a young girl that he asked the rescue from the boss teacher, I'd have sex and how to have sex. They have a sex for 50 years

Speaker 13:         01:08:48       and I am the king of in province for, for you.

Speaker 3:          01:08:53       It's so gross. Yeah. So here it is. I'll scout cartels. Alright, here's the trailer. This time in eastern Europe, he never does

Speaker 13:         01:09:05       my gym. Confirm Beard.

Speaker 3:          01:09:08       Very dark, very dark. It's nice and easy. He's like 60 years. It's just jet black.

Speaker 13:         01:09:19       Tim Confirm location themselves. Salazar as the boss, a little most quiet and cartels and eastern Europe.

Speaker 3:          01:09:25       Salazar is not an eastern European name. Ps, that's Latin, isn't it? Yeah. Salazar. That's like every drug lord name and every movie. Right? Does it sound angel? It's a Latin, yeah, and they're giving it to an eastern European guy. No Way. No Way. There's no wise or disease or cs or Jay's and he's nine eastern block.

Speaker 13:         01:09:43       We do not kill.

Speaker 3:          01:09:48       Again, it's mixed. Weird, but the, the mute, the sound is mixed. Weird. Again, this is the guy to the guy. This guy I'm sure learned his lines and then every day on set he's tall. He's like, why is he saying that? He's like, he just improvise. ECM prompting, but do you hear that the voiceover is mixed lower? Yeah. Then the background, you could even do that, right? Can't even hear the voiceover because I don't know why. That doesn't matter to somebody on this, you know what I mean? Someone invested their money in making this term. You would think they'd be like, can you fucking audio mixes right. It's so enormous. Yup. I was going to say he looks good cause they put them in a Kevlar vest. I had this shirt. Yeah, that's, that's a bad guy's friend. Believe me. Oh you start putting on layers of things and you kind of look like everybody else. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         01:10:39       I good. Blended body in a bag is a one Joseph Salizar. He'll bring it on [inaudible] side. What are you waiting for? Soldiers go,

Speaker 3:          01:10:51       here's a girl I used to see me alive. So there's Salazar with the east. He's Salazar. Please talking. Everyone needs to Bryce to see me alive. Why are you talking like that? Salazar? No weirdo. Like government be like [inaudible] or something. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         01:11:10       The government has him. Dea faked his death. So as people would know, we flipped it. Salazar is going to be a star witness for the next 10 years. The cartel once here, we have to sit in for 24 hours for cartels going to be out to exterminate his entire bloodline. How on him bad.

Speaker 3:          01:11:26       That's George Saint Pierre. The fighter. The fire. But can you tell already that that has a bad acting? No, you can't look, I want him dead in the eyes. Don't know expression. Yeah. You would say, here's how I do it. I want him dead. But at least that, right. They're barely trying to do it. Looked like a guy would want him dead. That's how you do it. There's some expression. Right. But this like, look at, look this blank stare. I looked him dead. They're like, they're like, do it more angry. I want him dead. W NBC. Oh wait, where's that? No, that was the shahs of sunset where she was like, oh, singing. She's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, me and my friends are on the, uh, I forget it was, she was like in La, can you say it with more enthusiasm? And she was like, I'm singing.

Speaker 3:          01:12:27       No. He's like, no, the sing it. She was like, I'm going to, he's like, you don't think much. She's like, it's all I do. And he's like, oh, it's terrible. So I'll be, can I tell you though, honestly, I'm kind of liking the storyline. So they fake the drug lords death so that he can be flipped for America. Right. And now the cartels after his whole family whole bloodline. So I kind of like, the premise is a solid premise. I liked those masks. It could be interesting or terrifying, but why do we want to save the drug lords, family and everything? Why? Why do we care is now he's on the good people, so we have to maintain his good faith. Okay. Okay. All right. I'm on board. I got minute. I want him dead Alaina and day

Speaker 13:         01:13:12       Germany's tar bloodline. Sitting ducks.

Speaker 3:          01:13:23       It's funny how all of these movies always have a female, either a DEA, FBI, US marshals, some agent who's like unusually attractive. That line of work. I've seen some federal officers that are females. They don't look like that. Or doctors too. You'll like Katherine Heigl is the doctor. You're like, no, that's not what my doctors have ever, ever looked like a doctorate. No, never to that woman. She didn't need to go to medical school, so she didn't go.

Speaker 13:         01:13:55       We're the only one, man. Wait a minute.

Speaker 3:          01:14:11       You call me, you're

Speaker 13:         01:14:12       going to live or you're Gunna die, I guess on why call him because you want the answer to, but you're going to live. Right. But that's also kind of a philosophically you can make that statement about everyone. Whoever you ever call, right. Or whoever talks to is going to protect you. You're, you're talking to him either. Whatever. You got to die. Yeah, that makes sense. Right? But they're calling him. He's like, I'm the guy you should have called first. Clean this mess up when you call me, you're going to live or you're gonna die. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Shit. I want to live. Can you rephrase it by the way they're doing them favors with these shots. Yes. Is you're leaving out the hoochie. Oh boy. See? Oh, and also layer. See Leather, a thick leather jacket. A fat guy friend. Yeah. Collared Shirt like I know. And the yellow glasses. We're back on the yellow sunglasses. There's them onscreen and off.

Speaker 13:         01:15:07       It's not flattering. It's not. It's not a good luck here. Chet Chet black, dark, dark, dark hair. He looks, he looks like the crazy guy at the top of the show. Yeah. The uh, the Hillary Clinton had sex with. Yeah. Yeah. I know. Twin eight his ass out, right? Yeah. Right. That's wild that she did that story. I can't believe sickler hasn't told that story yet. Hey Ryan, why don't you tell that story? God, please bombard him with tweets. Seriously. Hillary Clinton aid your ass out can protect him when they call me. When they call me. You're going to live or you're going to die.

Speaker 3:          01:15:50       Which is it? Let's go. Good. And this doesn't sound mixed either. No, it's terrible. I can you turn it up actually so I can hear the voiceover more? Yeah, and he does. Did you see his mark? Wait, this is his martial arts. He was doing Tai Chi. He was like, there's maybe this fingerless gloves. Anyway. Yeah. That was how he got ready to fight. He did like, it's not even there. It is. Yeah. He's got his thumbs out of it's thumbless glove. They call me. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         01:16:27       Can protect him when they call me, when they call me, you're going to live or you're going to die.

Speaker 3:          01:16:34       That's an improvised line. Yeah. That sequence. Yeah. It was. It said something and he was like, I got, Steven said he got it, and then the producers that got, damn it. It's just he doesn't want to memorize. Yeah, of course. He's like, I get to just easy. So you do like at an audition, you're like, I got, I got the idea. These title cards are made on a Mac. Definitely. Like, isn't this a standard? Yeah. Yeah. This is on your APP. All right, let's go. Good.

Speaker 6:          01:17:04       Oh, there it is. A Blue Band

Speaker 3:          01:17:09       and pointed this out to me. You know the trailer is that obviously it's supposed to highlight the best moments of your film, and they clearly leave in a dummy, like a falling. This is clearly a dot. Yeah. You have to watch it obviously, but if you, if you're watching the trailer, Oh one 21

Speaker 2:          01:17:37       they're dropping a clear

Speaker 3:          01:17:40       damn. Oh my God. You're right, it looked light and it's like its hands or uh, yeah. You wouldn't put that in the trailer, which Ya know, or you just cut it faster so that people can't tell, but you get to see it.

Speaker 6:          01:18:01       Wow. That's exhausting. Steven Seagal. George Saint,

Speaker 3:          01:18:22       let's say they may have spent like 20,000 days step up. I'm going to give him some credit here. I think this one might not be such a such a piece of shit that is still a piece of shit, but it's not the worst. Yeah. This is not the worst

Speaker 6:          01:18:42       cartels.

Speaker 3:          01:18:45       Well that's the name of the movie cartels. Cartels. Cartels. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. Yeah. I wish there would have been eight. My asshole. So weird. Ryan, when tell us about that. I know my mans my legs over her shoulders. Yeah. It's really crazy. She made me new copious amounts of cocaine with her. There was so much kicky punching in this though that I feel I have a hint. I feel like the story will get lost. Oh, you think might suffer a little cookie bunch kick, kick, kick. Yeah. So much kicky and shooty punching. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:19:26       it's a lot. God has a lot. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:19:31       No, she was numb sucking my asshole.

Speaker 2:          01:19:33       Cool. To rise, numb, sucking to the point of it. It gets numb. You keep sucking on this. I got it. So now a picture of Hillary Clinton just suck in the over and over on that guy's bubble.

Speaker 3:          01:19:47       So great. I didn't know if she was even into like cocaine and I know she doesn't seem like that kind of a lady. You don't think so? Hmm. Let's take of all the bullshit to deal with the bill all these years while she's probably menopausal at this point. Not Interested in sex the whole lot. Do you think at this point she's like, do your thing. I don't care anymore. Yeah. Other separate lives have been since the Wenski scandal for sure. You think so?
