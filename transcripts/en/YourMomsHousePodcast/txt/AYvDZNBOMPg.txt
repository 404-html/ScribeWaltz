Speaker 3:          00:04:08       Oh,

Speaker 5:          00:04:12       excuse me, sir. Excuse me. It's ma'am, ma'am. I can call him. He likes me too. You need to set down. You need to settle down to find your business, ma'am. Once again, man,

Speaker 4:          00:04:29       don't bring it in one loving

Speaker 2:          00:04:33       well. Well. Well, go to your mom's house and Christina. Oh,

Speaker 4:          00:05:22       Ooh. Snap. Like, Hey, how are you? What's your name? What's Your Pronoun? Really funny that you would ask? What's your Pronoun Tom Today? Um, he him. Wow. Traditional Z's him. He, him. I'm always, they you are. Well, yeah, I'm, my gender is fluid throughout the program. Oh, so you can go anywhere. I could. I started as a woman this morning, but I'm feeling a little neutral right now. I'm going to go anyway. Yeah. That's nice. Yeah. So you feel you've got coffee gendered? Hey, that's a new one.

Speaker 6:          00:05:58       Yeah. I really like that. It's, what is she? It's ma'am, ma'am, ma'am. Like Gosh, she can't tell why somebody would be confused by you. I mean the, the righteous indignation over the confusion. Clearly I respect and I really do. If anybody was like, here's my my pronouns, I'm going to call you by your Pronoun Preferred Pronoun. But you got to expect some mistakes, you know, out of the gate. Right. There's no way you're walking around like that because she looks like she could, you know, start at defensive tackle. Right.

Speaker 5:          00:06:45       Excuse me. It's ma'am, ma'am, you need to settle down and mind your business once again man,

Speaker 6:          00:06:57       I guess she is at game stop or something like that. Yeah, something like that. Let's just call it a nondescript game store. Okay. A nondescript game store trying to I think make a return and uh, I think it's, you know, she's being offered to them as all game stores do. You're like, I bought this for 60 bucks. They're like, we'll give you $2. Okay. So trying to maybe do a sale like return or something like that. Um, and then gets indignant, very upset about, I think the offer that's being made for the game. And then his mis-gendered

Speaker 5:          00:07:32       uh, both of you guys right beforehand, your fucking mother Fucker, mother fucker.

Speaker 6:          00:07:50       And then she kicks over to him merchandise there. I like how her gender is fluid too, because when she wants to be a surf, she can be as hard as she did. Say, I'll show you a search. She's like, I'll fucking show you. So that's, that's, that's pretty, that's pretty fluid.

Speaker 5:          00:08:12       Talk. Call them and talk about how it's misgendered several times. Oh, I need your corporate number now. Well, I'm going to ask you for the fifth time to stop calling me a man because quite clearly I have not,

Speaker 6:          00:08:31       no, clearly,

Speaker 5:          00:08:37       Ooh, you're going to disrespect and Trans people in the store, which I plan on telling the entire Lgbtq community who was mulling over this

Speaker 6:          00:08:53       damn hello. She's so up. It's almost

Speaker 4:          00:08:55       like I kind of feel bad, you know? I do. I do. Cause I imagine it's very difficult when you, when you are trying to present one way people keep mis-gendering you and you're like, dude, look, you know, but what I learned from what was that show? A lost in translation or trans life for yeah. Yeah. One it, those like the Tlc one is, uh, like I remember there was a guy who was transitioning, uh, Boston transition lost in transition. Yeah. Um, there was a guy who was transitioning to a woman and had just basically started and look like me with longer hair, no beard, but like big shoulders. And she was getting her nails done and somebody was like, hey man. And she was like, God, why are people calling me? Man. It was like, well, cause you look like a fat guy with a pink with a pink, um, crop top, like the pink crop top doesn't mask everything just yet.

Speaker 4:          00:09:55       I'd give it some time, trap fool and shoulders. I want to get my nails done. And they're like, okay. And then so it was like sir. And she was like, God dammit, what do I gotta do? I've been doing this for two weeks. I don't know. You need a lot more surgery. I know. And well, and too, I think I would, it would be ruder of me to be like, what should I call you? I don't know what you are like, how should I, what Pronoun should I call you? That might be more rude. Really? Yeah. Then just making an assumption expert. Hey, how are you? What's your name? What's Your Pronoun? Yeah. That's how you should do it. Yeah. I don't know. I would feel more rude to anything. No. Now that I, now that I hear it and I see this now, I feel like you probably should, but and you don't delete in is, you know, just say what your Pronoun, it's, what's your name? What's your name? Cause sometimes someone's going to be like, oh, it's Angela. And you'd be like, oh, I was going to go. But if it's pat, Chris Terry, yeah, but like then if you're following it up, what you go, what's your name? What's Your Pronoun? Then it's like you're trying to make an effort and if they're like the fuck are you asking me that? I'm sorry.

Speaker 4:          00:11:07       And they're like, is Kyle my God? What the fuck? I'm sorry. I just thought maybe that you are. Well, and here's the, here's the deal man. Here's the problem is that a lot of these I would, if I had another, if I had more time in my life, I would become like a trans coach and I would help women dress. Oh, I see women dress like more feminine. The problem is these patients are trying to dress like they're a car Dashi and hot and they were like the Valore tracksuit. That casual female style, like if you're gonna, if you're a new female, you got really fem it up so that the public knows like, oh, they're very much presenting as a female. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. It's kind of go overboard and then dress it up and then when you're more changed then then you can dress down as a hot chick. You know what I'm saying? Like I go big dangly earrings, real obvious rate, long, long, long hair extensions and shit. You can't be like, oh, just like casually agile girl. No Dude. Like I can pass as a fee. This is casual girl. How'd he saying? I mean I present as a woman sometimes.

Speaker 4:          00:12:18       It's brings me to my next topic. I was on the airplane traveling. I don't know if you do this. I was in Madison. Oh Dude, I big debts. Now we're talking. That's my mom. Yeah. She's got a big tits too. She's got a big old and she doesn't like to wear a Bra. Anyway, so any huddles, I don't know if you do this, and I wrote this down because I wanted to talk, talk about it. When you're on a plane and you're in an airport and you're looking at people, and let me preface this, preface this by saying it's so random who you end up with in life, right? It's crazy. It's a matter of like that night I could've gone out with a different comedian, a different person, and then falling in love with somebody else and now I have a totally different life that doesn't involve sold out theaters, Ferrari's, Mcdonald's, sponsorships.

Speaker 4:          00:13:09       I mean I'm fucking ball. I know and I, that's why I preface, I clearly made the right choice. Ular but do you ever stop and think like sometimes I'll be like, what if I wasn't like with Tommy? Like do you ever see people on the plane? You're like, what if that was my spouse all the time? Really course. But then I immediately find a flaw and the stranger and I'll be like, but we would never work out because that guy, we're top siders topsiders with the gays thing. And you always find something like where you're like, man, yeah, I've got French. She got French mannequin. Yeah, I fucking hate French manic. Yeah. And like I could never love somebody with a fresh manic and then I feel like telling her, I'd be like, you, you got a lot going for you. But the solid color, I feel like telling them too.

Speaker 4:          00:13:58       That's so funny. Like if, um, like for instance in Madison it was so cold, it's like two degrees and then there's a guy in front of me who gets on the plane wearing shorts and sandals, sandals and you're like, I could never love you. I could never love you. Because fundamentally we see the world. So definitely as human beings it's completely, it should be mandatory that your mind plays that game and your mind should also, if you're somewhat, I mean, unless you're like miserable, but your mind should get to the point where it goes like, oh, but this wouldn't work out the game that your mind plays. I think everyone does that though. Yeah. You see the person, you're like, I can be married to you baby.

Speaker 4:          00:14:37       I don't ever think I go, I go like, I'll see a nice looking guy and I'll be like, I wonder what their light like, what's wrong with that guy? Because there's always some, there's always a rub with people. There's always there. They're given, they're taking their bad sides and you're like, yeah, what's the darkness and that person, like what's their flaw? And then you know, you make one up in your head and like, I know that guys immediately sometimes you'd be like, yeah, if I was married to her, then she starts talking. You like this bitch never shuts up. Or You'd be like, yeah, it's just give good head. You can see the way she's eating. You can tell that just by watching it. I'm just saying, well in my head I'm making it up, but she gets bad blow job. I'm like, yeah, she doesn't use spit enough.

Speaker 4:          00:15:15       You know? She always neglects the balls. Yeah, yeah. That's what you're worried about is the blow job quality. Well also, you know, like just conversation is a big way, right? So I'll start being like, oh yeah, that could be what if I was married to her? And then she starts talking. I'm like, oh for fuck's sake. Yeah. Like if I were married to somebody who wasn't a comedian, how difficult that would be for me because then I'd have to pretend like I'm this normal person all the time. Yeah. Because I did date an attorney before you and eh, when I became a comedian and it ruined her. Do you ever have the ammo? I've had it now where I've met a few people and I have just a, I dunno, I guess my professional demeanor on with them, like just polite, nice, you know, a couple of times. And then they come to a show and they're like, whoa. Yeah. You're like, well that's really who I am.

Speaker 7:          00:16:06       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:16:08       You know, that would be likes I met you at like whatever, you know, accounting office or something. Cause I like on this show, I get to be myself 100% in our home life. I'm 100% mean, but then if I, you know, I'm at the airport or if I am, I'm trying to be normal purse. It's a, it's a concerted effort for me to hold it together and not say what exactly what I'm thinking all the time. Of course it takes a very, and you know what I love about you too and I, I told you this the other day. Why think I'm so lucky to have you. I'm so messy. Yeah, you really brought, you were really into that. I'm so messy. I just dropped and in 15 years together you've never once been like, God damn it. You pick up your fucking underwear. Why don't you pick up your, so like you've never done and you let me wear any of your shirts to bed cause I've had boyfriends in the past who have been like, you can't wear that shirt. That's like my good one or what? I know. Horrible people. Right. See that's why I only can marry you bay. Of course.

Speaker 4:          00:17:18       No, but you never give me shit about it either. I know. That's why we work out. I know. Thank God you almost married this guy on the plane though. There's no, there's no like specific. Literally like I'll be sitting. Did you touch his leg? No. I'm sitting in a plane likes people pass me by and I'd be like, can I, can I love that person? I want to hear about the ones. I love that person. It's very specific for me. I look to see some photos. Okay, next time I find a guy I think I might love if I could love that person started doing the same thing. Think I might love her. Yeah. Could I love her? Could I love that? I think I might love or it's, can I love this person? And then you have to find the flaw and then, and then I'll be like, oh, we hooked up.

Speaker 4:          00:18:00       Oh No, no, I fucked her and she, now here's the game, Tom. The game is stupid shit. The game only lasts a total of 10 seconds by the way, last that long. So if I haven't done it in a while, no, I mean the game of everything. 10 seconds. No, no. Here's the game. You're on a plane. You're watching people filing, you go, could I love this person? And then within 10 seconds you find the flaw and then you're like, I, that's why I love my husband ones. If you don't find the blog then are you like, oh my God, that's the worst. No, you'll always find the flaw because then you don't find the pull in my mind cause I go, I'll be like, that guy's way too neat. He would never put up with my message is Tom puts up with, no, I know, I see those type a women too who are like, perfect. Oh my God. You imagine how mad they would get at me. Oh my God. What is this? The farting and the burping. Scratching. Scratching my arm pits. Yeah. Yeah, that'd be like, Oh shit. She be like, Oh, you know, I did not sign up for this. And like that's what you got now was your new man, ain't no. And then, um, so there's that story. So play that with your spouse if you're listening and I'm curious to see what you guys come up with as deal breakers with strangers. Maybe run your finger along.

Speaker 4:          00:19:23       That's a fun game to play with your spouse too. You gotta know what your smells are. You to learn to learn your smells, smells in here. You should kind of know them a little more. Everybody knows their own smells. You know you're asking him. I was like, yeah, from running your finger along it. I don't have to run my finger. I feel like I just know that with every narrow and then if you need a shower, because my nuts where those compression shorts to the gym yesterday and then I didn't have time to shower. We went to that appointment. Then I came back and men really stripped down in the bathroom. I was like, whew. Ripe. Really? Right. Do you wash the shorts? I hope so. Nah, I put it back on right away. Yeah. Yeah. What the, how many guys work kind of brew? How many guys listening are like yeah, just put it back on. Oh, there's guys right now we're like, oh, keep talking Tom.

Speaker 4:          00:20:23       That's hot stink. So weird out coach. I wouldn't even know what to do without coach. Yup. Um, and so also another topic I wanted to bring up is that when I was away, when you came up, you have a new thing, you've found the new show. Oh yeah. I'm really excited and it actually informed me and I think you're going to be happy about this. I now think it is stupid and wasteful to get jewelry for my 40th. Yes, thank you. Praise Jesus. You know why there's no utility in jewelry. You're absolutely 100% right. So the idea that you would spend that amount of money on something I just put around my neck a silliness. It's stupid. And Liz, Danny Brown said someone could come and snatch it. Exactly. You don't want, that's why I want to refocus my efforts and yours hopefully into getting a jet.

Speaker 4:          00:21:21       I was watching this show selling jets where couples who look like they own jets, we're buying jets. And how much money do you think we have? Like we don't Mcdonald's, we had to give back the money. We don't have 2 million. Here's the great thing I learned that most jet brokers let you just put 20% down. So it's like buying a house and we just need, how much is 20% for a jet? Well, that's the thing is that there's so many options. You know, like there's light jets, midsize jets, super admid heavy. I mean, I think right now we're probably looking at like a super light or something. You know? How much is that? I mean that's the thing. I don't think Steve, I don't want to get lost in the weeds of the numbers.

Speaker 4:          00:22:06       I think it's just something that it makes a lot of sense. Yeah. So much more utility than a stupid chain. You're so funny. I can, I know. I can hear the future we have to get, we also have to buy the helicopter that goes with the jet way later. That's like three years from now and then we have to build the hell a pad on top of the house. That's a great idea to buy the yacht with the helicopter landing pad. We have, why do you have a chopper if you can't land it on your yacht? Right. Look all I'm here. Just a few loans. Yeah. Okay. A few loans. We got to get some loans, how many millions of dollars we're talking about. That's the fun part is you can decide, you know, you just basically look at, you know, your needs and, um, person, here's the great thing.

Speaker 4:          00:22:52       I found out Rockefeller and his [inaudible] found out that, uh, through executive charter services that manages these, uh, chats, we can bring down basically our whole operating costs by at least 50% just by chartering it out 150 hours a year. I'm like, God, who are we? I don't know. I just, you know, I think it's a good idea. Anyways, I'm turning 40 in a couple months and I'm looking forward to seeing, uh, in the driveway and I'm like, God, do you get, I would get, yes, but what would our church think? I mean, that's true. They don't, we don't, you know what I mean? They're gonna be like, wait, why aren't you donating money to the church? He should be giving it to us. What can I say to get you to just sign off on this jet ID thing? There's nothing you can say that would make this remotely logical.

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       I got an idea. I cannot, I'll donate some of my flying hours to the church. Okay, good deal. You got yourself a deal, homie. You know important. It is for the church, me and my church. I needed my priest to be able to fly around in comfort. All right. You have a point. Can we show up and do it? No, no. It's insanity. I mean it's you talking like a crazy person. Is there one dream I can pursue? He goes, support. Here's what, here's what I will tell ya, bro. Real talk. Yeah. If you're at that like Ron white level where you know what I mean? I know one has a plain crazy. That's what I'm saying. Like if you're

Speaker 8:          00:24:26       there and I got an idea. That makes sense. Hey, we got a book, Ron White. Oh, he's the big guy to get them on here and we got to talk about, we got to Cadillac to talk here. Doesn't he live in Florida or the south somewhere? He has a Texas place, but he's in La a lot. God, he's so fine. You just need them to do a sales pitch on why we should get a plane. Okay. All right. Great idea. Thanks. I love her. I'm like, thanks Ron in advance. All right.

Speaker 4:          00:24:52       Um, and also we, yeah, I mean I'm still upset about it. We watched the Michael Jackson. Yeah. We need to actually, we're going to do this, I think,

Speaker 8:          00:25:04       think, um, this would be a great conversation to have with our very own Josh.

Speaker 4:          00:25:10       Oh, the expert in creep salad. Yeah. Sad. Dude. Why don't we, should we stop down for a moment? Why am each we'll be right back and we are back and this is one of the most exciting

Speaker 8:          00:25:23       times that we have doing this podcast. We get to bring in a hilarious comedian, a good friend and a questionable person. It is Josh Potter.

Speaker 9:          00:25:42       Ooh, it's good. Right? I like that. I like it a lot,

Speaker 4:          00:25:55       Tanner, for making that tanks. Tanner, you really affect the lady's Josh. I guess so. I have some sort of effect, I guess. Right? I guess any effects is goods and nun.

Speaker 8:          00:26:04       That's true. Uh, their effects on me so far have been the same. And that is no effect. So we're still a no. Recently I have, I have put some reps in. Yup. Sort of some research, if you will, to find, you know, to keep finding the bottom of this mystery. And a, I did, you know, I started at the bottom and now we're here and so far, you know, I've gathered some research. I think I need to have like a, a brain orgasm first. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 4:          00:26:35       Like a connection with somebody, you mean? Yeah, because I drift away. Maybe when you're on that, what is that?

Speaker 8:          00:26:43       Oh, that's my bedroom.

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       That's where I bring girls to come. Do you like it? Don't like I had a girl not liked it recently. She said she would get my going to die here. She was cold and that she would let me tell you. I mean, why don't you describe, let me break it down. Describe it. Describe it. Well listen. Hey, it's clean. So that's wonderful. You're already a step ahead. I don't own any things, so there's no way to make it messy. So it's just like a bed in a corner and there's, um, I've been candles and you have a candle. It, hey, that's a for effort and that's my weed next to it. And that's your weed. Good. I mean, look, it's sparse, but I liked that it's clean and I liked that you even have a frame work that was there when I got there, so.

Speaker 4:          00:27:27       Oh really? I was really pumped about that. I've never had one of those before. I've slept on an air mattress. I slept on a regular mattress lay sleeping on. Now that's a tempurpedic dog. It's not as good as the sot vote, but it's a, you know, I, I immediately, yeah. What are you doing here? I mean, I'll take, I'll take a new mattress for a, sure. That suitcase. That's a suitcase, by the way. I see that. And then what's draped over the headboard? Those headphones? Oh no, that's just the blinds from the, Oh, I tell you, number one, what's wrong is that his bed is pushed against the cold windows. I like, of course you do. But any woman who's laying nude in your bed or semi-closed, it's fucking cold. You're not supposed to sleep next to them as a total lunatic with, I know he's a cockroach. They complained also that I like. I don't have enough like pillows or something. Well, how many pills he, I have one. That's all. I've only one head weight. One pillow. Why you can you see? What about for the chick that comes over? I get one from a couch or something, you know? No, no, no. She can't sleep on a pillow. Tells a woman. This is not going to be, well, I think experience into pillows. Presumptuous like human sleep on two pillows. You deserve to pillows. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:28:44       God. Blue Band. Do you sleep on two pillows? Yeah. I'm not a psycho. That's a psycho move. I have your head, your badge at f four pillows. It's more that I don't even have four of anything in there. No, you should get four pillows. I have. I don't have even for blankets. Two for you to, for the lady that's not going to live long after she lives there. Okay. Let me ask you this. What's with the medieval, the medieval tapestry. That's a buffalo hills. That's Buffalo. Bill's helmet. What? Okay. That needs to go serial killer. Now this looks, it looks like he's got a medieval combat tapestry. Buffalo bills, a blanket that I got from a couch now that's take that off. That this terrible. Then I don't have any blankets like a dog blanket. You should get you one. Let's get you a different style blanket, you know? Yeah. That's not a bedroom blanket and that's just some clutter at the end of my bed. I'm sorry. That's fine. It's actually pretty bare. And that's how I live, dude. I that suitcase, I put that down the day I moved in, that's where

Speaker 8:          00:29:41       it stays. It's part, it's like my nightstand, the nightstand, the nightstand, the nightstand. That's what I had to search with the suitcase does. No, no, I get it. But I mean, you know, you're not a freshman in college, right? So yeah. But I mean like, I guess here's the thing, like for real, I always think the next day they're going to throw me out of these places. Why? You know what I mean? I Dunno. I've lived in so many different apartment. I've been here now for a while, right? Yeah. Yeah. It's been, this is a little, maybe one of the longest departments I've ever lived in in my whole life, so that's why it's like, can you take him Jesus Christ and take, take it until the way Ikea. Yeah, somewhere and gets them. Let's go shopping for furniture. I need help. I just want to get you some pillows.

Speaker 8:          00:30:23       A blend of different blanket. I'll tell you another thing that they, that the thing hang on the wall while they, yeah, that's where I was going to get. They said that. That's weird. I don't have anything on the wall. Zero. It's all bare. Yeah. He's cause he's living like he's a transient. I'd be kicked out. Why do you think you're going to get kicked out at any moment? Is that a real threat? Never been kicked out of her apartment, but I've had to move at a rapid pace a lot and then like you know, you on the road, sometimes you want to have an apartment. Yeah. You're just kind of live in other people's departments. Do you think he'll stay here for awhile and I want to, I hope I stay here for a long time. The bare walls not good. No Shit. What do I get? Like, oh, so I should get like a Jim Kelly poster or something a way football player. No, boom. Now we need just like, let's just go get you a ladder football player like ray Lewis or maybe like a, you know, whales jumping out of the water. Like A, I like a neon Miller lite side. [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          00:31:19       we have to squint your eyes and the image pops out. Well where would you rather spend an evening? In my bedroom or in the now vacant Neverland ranch. So yeah, we were getting on a topic that, I mean like if he want to listen to Michael Jackson's music, don't watch that documentary cause it's so hard to go back to loving him after all that. I mean the part that makes me the craziest is that he wasn't trying to conceal the fact that he was a PDO file is your dad says yes. There was no concealing it. Like in the 80s. He, he paraded his, his boys around out in the open end. He did that and we all were complicit. Everybody was like, Emmanuel Lewis is your date to the grammys? Cool. No problem. Yeah, he likes kids. That's a big guy. And Jay Leno would make a joke at night being like a kid's pants are half off.

Speaker 8:          00:32:13       And then, uh, everyone would laugh and we'd all clap. And then we listened to thriller and that would be that he's the ultimate, he was the ultimate, like we've seen this with people that are talented where we, um, the talent pollutes our mind into excusing certain behavior. It's a hall pass. He is the ultimate talent and name where he was so famous and so talented that we were like, he fucks. But I mean, have you seen thriller? Like, yeah, it was basically, yeah. That's what the sentiment that was going to be weird with kids, but boil them in a studio and it makes mad really mean off the wall was a pretty perfect at all. Have you seen that moonwalk? Touch my kid? You know, Daniel, by the way, in that documentary, if they, uh, if the parents were my parents and they were like, they were like a, hey, you know, sorry, we've been separating from your child so much.

Speaker 8:          00:33:09       Uh, we just need, we want you to have the nicest hotel suite. My mom would have been like, yeah, you can fuck him to a hotel suite. That'd be dope. Yeah. I would totally be like, just do whatever you want. Actually, I think my mom would be the, she would've been, I would've been like so pissed at her. She would have been like, you can't go hang out with Michael Jack. I'd be like, fuck you mom. And then I would like go listen to Michael Jackson in my room and turn the music up real loud. It would be because Mommy said we're going to fuck. And that she'd be like, what's a disturbing doc? What am I disturbing to me is that the parents are still recounting the events with Michael fondly. Like, and then we got to fly first class all the way back, the glimmer in their eye and talk about it.

Speaker 8:          00:33:56       It's sickening. Yeah. There's still recalling it like it was just a pleasant tail. Nothing bad happened in that situation again. They'd be like, yeah, I think it all turned out fine. It's worth it. We got to ride in a limousine, Wade Robson's mom seemed unfazed and it's like, well, my son became a dancing prodigy. Yeah, so she's like, how bad was it? The way she makes sense. That's the way she looks at her face. It's me now are they all were like, it was really an interesting house. Oh my God. They went, I wanted to bring up the house actually because of this for sale right now. Do you know that Neverland ranch is for sale? Besides do you want to be in on this jet? Okay. What's the numbers? Well, I want you, because it went on sale initially in 2015 and it was worth $100 million guy am now since this documentary's.

Speaker 8:          00:34:42       Yeah. Let's talk about the barn. The value has dropped. Sig Nicholas. Okay. Where do you think it's at right now? To him? That's 500,000 came out. Yes. Really? Yes. Well also the prelude to this coming out, you know in, yeah, people talk cause you were saying you know this, is this going to change the way you said there was a lot of hype on this before it came out. So in the wake of that, where do you think it shows up in the mind thing to the nun sexual abuser. It's probably a turnoff, but I think to somebody that celebrates um, pdf files, like my dad, it's a pdf file hall of fame. He's covered in just, yeah, that Shit's Canton. If you're, you're a pedophile. And I was talking about it before. We guessed the number that one of the guys was talking about all the rooms he went to Aa. That's another thing he's

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       going to think I think lower than the value of your more details in here. And we did it here. Whereas before, if like if you didn't know any of this stuff, you'd be like, I want to have this Michael Jackson House to remembered honor Michael Jackson. Now you'd be like, we got to tear this shit apart man. Which was like a murder for me. Let me preface this by saying I had lunch one time at the Charles Manson murder house right now and I want to get to that in a moment for his guests. You're fit to be cleaned. I was counted land. Hold on more early on is discounted land and significantly so it's child sex land. This was priced at 100 million. Who? I would say injured went down to 70 I'm going to go low or I'm going to go 70 25 million to him. You are in the department.

Speaker 4:          00:36:27       You're kidding. Dropped 70% it is now listed at $31 million. Wow. I don't think it's going to go up now. You mentioned that it, is it just bank? Nobody owns it. I had to know. I don't know who the broker is. Have you made a Ferris wheel? The cotton candy machine. The monkeys played and this is, what do you think he was like that all the time. Do you think he talked like that? Like, cause you know he was like, you know, he'd have to like, it's ignorant. Ignorant on that. Do you think behinds you'd be like your Shit's off key. Yes. Yes, yes. I think he put on that bullshit total. This is gentle and I lacked children's. How did he get his, how did he get a skin lighter? No, that's all surgeries and she, when you have that much money you can do anything.

Speaker 4:          00:37:19       He made his daughter in a lab and she's a gorgeous, gorgeous, probably started with his ass hole and then he was like, she bleached asshole I think. So He's like, I'm going for this, lifted it up, showing it to the doctors. No, take a closer look. And then they were like, oh yeah, that is pretty white. And then there was a point where he was perfect. I would say when he came out and thriller, he really looked, has knows. Is it a good place? He was cute, like off the wall. A little rough. But that's the Thrillist started plastic surgery. If he had, if he hadn't pushed it past that he, yeah, it would have been like, oh, this guy had a little work done. But he, and then he just kept going like that. Do have plastic surgery. He became probably addicted to it. Total body dysmorphia for sure. But you, Brent, you've mentioned the Charles Manson that you went to visit. I had lunch one time at the clo drive and I spoke to the gentleman that purchased it and he said, well, yeah, that murder land is discounted land. So he got it at almost half price. It was a tear down exact. He tore it down and he built this completely garish nuns. It was multiple waterfalls and Elvis Presley Room. The guy is a total but is not a,

Speaker 8:          00:38:36       this is a common thing. Jon Benet Ramsey, his house has been for sale forever. That they had to change the fucking street name. Oh, J house. So the coalition didn't even kill her there. That's right. Yeah. Those apartments still function. I bet some of lives in that fucking unit. Yeah. I believe in that fucking go hook it up. I got a bed in a suitcase. I can move into there, but uh, I got a lease and a key, the question is, would you rather live in a home where a terrible murders occurred? Yeah. Or the Neverland ranch. Murder. Murder. All everyone say murder.

Speaker 8:          00:39:12       Why? Well, what is the ultimate eat the worst. Evil is definitely what Michael was doing. There's nothing more evil and distinction where my uncle, but I'm thinking in terms of aftermath, you know like in, in terms of living in a place, the murder they splayed open, their guts are everywhere. There was blood everywhere. Sure you clean it. But that happened. A person was inside out in the home. They don't, don't care. Not compared to care to a kid. Yeah, but there's nothing, I mean there's nothing. I rather bathed in the blood of a hundred slaughtered women even step into a room where something happened to uh, wow. Well, Manson and the Sharon Tate murders, she was seven months pregnant. They cut open, her pregnant belly took her baby. I wouldn't live in, I'm saying I would live in the Manson house over Neverland. Amy [inaudible] is terrible.

Speaker 8:          00:39:59       I mean, look man, even in prison, inmates have a code that what Michael was doing is I would have signed up to watch the little, do you think are Kelly's here? If our Kelly does go to prison, you think they fucked him up where they're like they fuck with him. They won't put him in the general, he'll be in protective custody. But he also, there's a term for it and I forget what it, cause I've seen it in one of these shows that he actually targeted women entering their sexual a 14, 15 year. That's what I mean. So the prisoners will be more because our Kelly's brother, uh, in this documentary about r Kelly for instance, if we can shift gears for a moment. His brother creeps is involved in the documentary and he's actually in prison from the documentary. He is good. Yes. He's, he's interviewed from prison now are Kelly has a couple brothers.

Speaker 8:          00:40:48       He's got a brother Kerry who's younger. Those are right there. He's there. What I do, man, he, yes. And then what he did was he'd be like singing about sex and fucking and shit. And then he'd go, I'm going to do a church song. And everyone's like, it's forgiven. You know what I mean? Well, same with Michael, wasn't he like you got to save the world. It's got to make the world a better place, our than, and you are not alone by the way. It's a, it's a, it's always the and huge. Yeah. Our Kelly wrote that nailed years ago. We play years ago. Peter King, I think that's his name, right? I am the only guy with the right was, this was right after Mike died and I think this guy's still in office. Uh, 11 uh, but he, The v celebration of Michael as being ridiculous like this.

Speaker 10:         00:41:39       Hi, this is Congress from pitching and a yesterday I'm watching tools. What did your wife Prays and One Chore and Really Reminded me Of, do you have a great men and women who sacrificed so much for our country? People fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan today? Yup. Cops, firefighters, teachers, none of whom really get much in the last, I don't know how long now this lowlife Michael Jackson space picture is all over the newspapers, television, radio. So we hear about as Michael Jackson and let's knock out the psychobabble. This guy was a carver, Arkansas Child restaurant header file. And to be giving this much coverage to him day in and day out. What does it say about us and our country?

Speaker 8:          00:42:19       Well, here's the deal. He must be really mad today.

Speaker 4:          00:42:21       Oh man, this guy's probably play playing this deal. Look, I know it takes on, this is the only correct opinion on all of this. Oh, sure. Skype. It came into my head immediately, right? No. Yeah. The next morning I woke up. I remember that guy we played. Yeah, this is the guy. This is the right fucking way to think about this whole thing. Play the rest. Yes.

Speaker 10:         00:42:40       Correct. No one wants to stand up and say, that's right. Michael Jackson. Yeah. He died. He had some talent and you're fine because people dying every day. There's men and women dying say in Afghanistan, let's give them the credit they charge. I really think the media has disgraced himself. I think of too many people in public life. I made fools of themselves by talking about Michael Jackson's. If you some kind of hero, there's nothing good about this. Maybe a good CEO did some dancing. You let your child

Speaker 4:          00:43:08       never may have been a good thing and dance. Dancing. Oh by the way, I want, I just want to take this moment to thank you for taking me on the road and never making me stimulate your nipples. You're welcome or spread. That was my, that was the other one. See your a turn me off. Yeah. Yeah. I just hope I don't get old and gross and kicked off tour. Yeah,

Speaker 10:         00:43:27       but are the answer.

Speaker 8:          00:43:31       Did some dancing. But I wanted to show you our Kelly's brother cause he was in prison and he is the only one coming to his brother's aid in this documentary. Yeah. I haven't seen the art Kelly Doc. I can't. Why can't, there's a Jetta goodbye. Oh Geez. A commercial jet. Sure. Younger women. You have people who have fantasies about different things. I like hold your women. Okay. Figure.

Speaker 9:          00:43:59       Nope. That's just a preference. It's a preference. Everyone has preferences. It's true. So what is the big deal? What's the big issue with my brother?

Speaker 8:          00:44:13       Hmm.

Speaker 4:          00:44:13       Can Dare to answer. Yeah. We mean, I think for people who, I

Speaker 8:          00:44:19       don't know, those people who are listening or watching who don't know about the r Kelly details. Really? You don't think so for sure. It's, I mean, with the documentary, I thought, no way the people have the same amount of this, this story has the same amount of exposure as Michael Jackson in a way. That's a good point. And uh, I think though it's, it is in the news right now. Michael have, Nadia has picked up another charge for our Kelly, so he is being prosecuted again in the wake of this documentary. Yeah. But his brother, uh, his other brother Carey was not so ride or die with r Kelly because r Kelly approached him about taking the fall for the pee pee tape being like, oh, tell him it was you in there.

Speaker 11:         00:45:02       Well, you just turning on your radio. We're talking to Carrie Kelly, r Kelly's younger brother. You did a body double for your big brother Robert. You body's calling and things kind of turned a little ugly when this whole child molestation thing came into play. People were trying to say was you, his attorney said that it was me and a video saying, hey, that was the argument. He never came forth and said, hey, you know what y'all are hearing is not true.

Speaker 8:          00:45:26       Yo, did we have another tape of a tire? More restaurant? Do we have another type of a Bruce? I can't remember. Oh yeah, that's the third. Yeah. Can you play that one? This is Bruce's reaction to his brother not liking the idea of being not only the body double in music videos, but in his sex tape as well. For what he does.

Speaker 9:          00:45:45       Robert simply ask Carrie to tell the truth, do a deposition with his attorney stat. The things that he was saying was not true. And he said, if you do this deposition with my attorneys, I will give you $100,000 in a one record contract deal. I never understand that it's wrong causality. If you could have been rich, I never understand.

Speaker 8:          00:46:13       So he's like, I can't say like turn that idiot. He's like, hold on million down to the recognize shit. Put My fucking name on that deposition. Oh my God. So, um, so Bruce, what's he in jail for? Well, he's been in there for, I had to write down his charges. Nothing wild by the way. Nothing like r Kelly has ever done. Yeah. For the record it's just burglary. Oh, things like that. Like a drug possession and okay. And stuff like a no violent crimes unless you, uh, consider basically like for people that aren't well informed on the arc, how the scandal that he like, part of it is that he's been keeping women, uh, basically as sex slaves. Oh yeah. Like locked up in homes with like no cell for to that because he's been allowed so much leeway in the past. He was just kind of doing things like Michael Jackson where he was bringing younger women around and things like that. People just thought, oh, he likes the younger one and people help facilitate that. He married Aaliyah when she was 15. Yeah. That was so, and it's also the thing too, it's like prodigies that they build, right? Yeah. It's like Wade Robson has turned into an international dance, Super Mega Star choreograph for dance. You know that I did not know that the way the Australian boy that could, yeah. Yeah. He, he's uh, he was the choreographer for like Brittany Spears.

Speaker 8:          00:47:33       That right guys is that they say, what did I say? I want to be a comedian more than I want to be anything in the fucking world. I want it so fucking bad. And if you, if you make me go back in time and you told me like this is what you do it, but you're going to be Sebastian. I don't know that I would've said no, take the deal. Really. You would just have your childhood robbed from you and now you're doing Madison Square Garden, right? There's cause. Think about this. I said this to somebody and they think I'm a monster. There are so many children that are victims of terrible crimes like this, that are in a fucking alleyway or a fucking dumpster behind it. You know what I'm saying? Like terrible circumstance. These kids got immune park at least right? Free Popcorn. She got to see screeners a fucking Bambi before that came out probably in, I don't know if I can get onboard with this lie not taking jobs.

Speaker 8:          00:48:39       Obviously all of its pair. Wait a minute, you are a comedian, you know I want, you know what I mean? Like I and I'm very happy to be a comedian but that's my point. Like I, my desire is so much and it's like how much do you love dance and dude like is it wasn't what I would like to ask them that question. Was it worth it? Yeah. Being Michael's sex slave as a child. Oh my God, we could bring Sebastian and on this John here another phone quote from our Kelly's brother. By the way, me and my brothers, we all have our ways with our girls were very jealous. We don't want our girls doing certain things. You're not going to see our girls talking to too many people. That's just the way we are. Cause he was keeping them behind closed doors and shit and like he was keeping them safe, keeping them clearly really his ride or die. This brother. Yeah man. He is, well, could you imagine being in jail for all these petty things? He's probably in there for a, for a quite a few, few years, you know, after amounting so many crimes and his other brother gets this other opportunity, he's just sitting there and this felt like, shit, what the fuck? I would love to fucking do that. You know what I'm saying? I wonder what you would be willing to do right now. Other things you want. This is interesting. [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          00:49:50       it's not about what I would be willing to do to anyone else. It's like what I would be willing to have it. I'm talking to me. That's what I'm saying. I would degrade myself to levels of which are inconceivable to achieve my goals. Yeah. I mean, I haven't sold my soul at this point. I mean like, I don't know. Let's say a big time promoter. Yeah. Um, he's like, you know, I, I can hook up any gig and I'll have a plan for you. We were going to do is we're going to start off in these clubs. It's going to be this and then theaters and it's a three year plan. You're going to make millions dollars. You're going to sell all these tickets. Uh, kind of my house at first thing's first hands behind your back, mouth open. I'm dipping my balls. In your mind.

Speaker 8:          00:50:36       Who is this guy? First of all? Is it he's a Michael Jackson guys. A little creepy. He's a little weird. He's a heavier set man. Older. It doesn't smell. Is it a try it out guy? Kind of like the try it out guy. Yeah, you have to do the try it out guy. You're his sex slave. But the end game is something inconceivably successful or it's Harry or we asked to do Terry's butt plug every day, I think. No, I think try it out. Just the plot plug and try it out. Guy. That guy is, I have to eat. Try it out as you can come every day. He lays it out for you. He tells you the deal, you know you got gotta you got to bend over showing her ass whole lot. Yeah. And he wants, you know, now what if I'm you, you said I have to make him calm every day.

Speaker 8:          00:51:20       Do I have to make him calm or do I have to at least try to, no, you have to mention he doesn't come. I and I put in all the effort and I'm really just firing on all cylinders and I'm giving them everything. I got the whole kitchen sink and everything and he doesn't come and I still lose out. You can make them come though achievable goal. Is it okay. Cause that's the only thing that would concern me is if I was put into the situation and I couldn't succeed in my, uh, end of the responsibilities. Do you know what I mean? Then he takes it away from me. Then I wouldn't have liked to put myself in that kind of a, how many days do I have to make them come? Like, is that expressive? It's a deal with the devil. Oh, so it's like if forever ever, I don't know if I could do, here's why.

Speaker 8:          00:52:02       No, no, no. Let's do forever. Only because when you molest children, yes. Ruins them for their whole life. I still have the psychological damage, not as an adult. It's a little more, well, can you mess with children that way you destroy their soul for the rest of their lives, right? The rest of his life be destroyed. Let's have a time limit though to see if this works. I don't know that I could do rest of my life. I think I could put a, let's say there's a six round through. Well, you mentioned the three year. It's a three year progression to success. Once I hit the mountain top, I get to stop you. How it'd be like, all right. You know, sniff, sniff.

Speaker 8:          00:52:43       No, no, no. Let's do this way. Let's do an actual deal with the devil. So he gets successful and then in the afterlife thing, there is one every day he has to suck the train. See land stuff. I'm talking about a real fucking pitch where the guy, I am giving you my pitch pitch. The guy says, come over to my house. Suck my balls and eat my ass every day. I'm going to fuck you and all your holes and then I'll give you gifts. I look, try to negotiate some of it down. I'd be like, everyday it's tough. I'm going, I got stuff. So then he says in the fuck area. Okay, well then I'd be like, can we do three days a week? And we do, you know, get out of here. Do you want it fine? Yes, I'll, I'll do every day. We'll see how long we know.

Speaker 8:          00:53:24       What did you really do it? You think you would really do it for that? I don't know man. I really think I'd think about it. I really do. I don't. First Time, the first time he comes all over your face, you're like, and you go like to wash off and he hands you the envelopes got like eight grand in it. He's like, yeah, your job. I would feel funny that he's like, you're playing the Improv this week. I would feel discussing with myself, but it doesn't it. I would feel happy at the end. End result. I already hate myself, so that's not going to like decrease really. Do you know what I'm saying? Like so much therapy. I just don't think like, I think it would be out to, I'd call my friend and be like, you know, I had to suck this fat old man's thick.

Speaker 8:          00:54:03       It was terrible. I mean it was everything. He was as awful as you think it is. But you threw me an envelope of a crane and I've got a fucking, I'm doing all the improv snatch, so, so I think other comics would it be like, well shit. All right, you really, you really think you would do that though? I think I might think about it. That's all I, I don't, I've never been put in there. What if he started really the way that you put it, like where you're like, and you're doing theaters. I'd be like, am I selling all these tickets because I sucked a dick? Then that's all it takes then fine. Now what if he really started hurting your ass hole? That's going to hurt. I mean, that's key, but you're selling more tickets, more pain, more game, baby, let's go. You know?

Speaker 8:          00:54:39       I mean Shit, I see his point though. It's hard to sell tickets and to become something in this. If I just had to suck a dick, then I would do it the way that I, I when I pointed it out. Yeah. Speaking of tickets, where's your show? March 22nd at the Hollywood improv lab. I will suck all your dicks. Buy Tickets. 10:00 PM show, 10:00 PM show, line up in the back after and uh, we'll get it going. You know, you're putting that out there. There they have a right to get their dick suck now. Okay. Some dicks. All right. All right, good. Um, I would rather get buck pounded than suck. Suck dicks to Jesus and saying, think it tastes people. Oh wait, no. I would rather, I would rather have a dick in my ass then in my mouth. Wow. To really think about it to my mouth.

Speaker 8:          00:55:31       No, no, no. Think about it. But really think about it for one minute. Your ass is a nightmare. All Ready? Yeah. Here's the thing. Taking it. Yeah, I agree. I'll do. Then you have to taste it. You're going to fucking have to scope and be like, ah, and you're going to be like, it's your fucking teeth and shit face babe. Someone's fucking your face and asshole where your poop comes out. Who Cares? I agree. I'm with Josh on this thing 100% all right. Time to think about it though. Yeah. You really want them in your beard and stuff. Think it tastes it all day. You can't get that taste out. You don't like, you don't even eat certain foods. Right. So trail, I don't like olives. Yeah. Yeah. And I did like all is all in your beard on your eyes? Depending who's Dicky tastes. It'd be like an dog.

Speaker 8:          00:56:23       It'd be like a big holiday and his nuts could stink real bad. Oh they will? Yeah. This guy, this promoter guy I'd rather do in this class because then you can just hear you're bucking heel shit. All the Jews out of Utah Right about definitely finishing in your asshole. Yeah. But I mean, I was like, and he's like, aids comes in your butt. And then I'd be like, Oh God, you know, it's tough to sit down, but I'd rather that than be like, yeah, we're like, the rest of the fucking day he tastes it and every time he's in here Tommy, I don't want that. And he's like, Oh God, it keeps the of your butt. But good news. You're playing Talia Hall of Chicago so it's all sold out. I'd be like, not my stomach.

Speaker 8:          00:57:13       I had some other nightmares I wanted to bring up. If we have time, I don't know how much, I don't know. He may not. We're running out, we'll have to shelve it. But there is one other gentleman I'll end on that is from a band called the lost profits to ban. I listened to as a child, as a teenager I should say. And they weren't very popular at all. That shit man right there. He was Michael Jackson on steroids but had no fame and no, nobody helping him in this regard. And he was not like, as you noticed that these guys are like all elaborate in their schemes and everything like that. This guy was not at all. So he was pretty easy to catch an a monster. We got out of the realm pretty quickly. What happened to him was the British version of the NSA went to hack his computer because there was rumor that he had child pornography on it.

Speaker 8:          00:57:57       Oh Jesus. Crowl and uh, they didn't take long to crack it because his password turned out to just be I fuck kids. What? That was his password to his computer. Could you imagine being those, that crack team of detectives and you, do you think it took them long or do you think they sat there and were like, I'm just gonna try a couple of things here real quick and just put in a couple of last words. Guess number one. Yeah. He's like, the guy did one, two, three and he's like, no, that didn't work. Let me try my second idea. And he figured it out pretty quick, but this guy's in jail. So you listened to his music? I had t shirts. I had, I was doing my, I was given to the band and it, it was, it wasn't like I didn't give a fuck.

Speaker 8:          00:58:37       I'll never listen to the band again, like it wasn't that prevalent in my life that I was like, I'm going to miss he locked up right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's fucking in jail for this guy on a plane, Tom, to go back to our first discussion. Okay. This guy's walking past me now and I go, could I love him? Here's the number. What do you think the turn off his hair? Yeah. I'd be like the hairs too complicated. He's got teeth to co two intro. I was going to say the earrings too complicated and I don't like carrying your angel hair. It's too dark. It doesn't match. Yeah. Sorry about that. About those lobes wear earrings. I don't think so, but he's too, he's too complicated. That's what I would say. Yeah. He was in like an emo band. Yeah. Why? I get a cold cold eyes for sure, man. Well, yeah, he's going to jail in that picture. Yeah. It was probably like, you know what,

Speaker 12:         00:59:28       I'm fucked.

Speaker 8:          00:59:29       Yeah. I saw kids is definitely, what a terrible password. Thanks Josh. Can we run this real quick? This? Yeah, we have time. Yeah. Let's run this script. So what is this? Well, this, I have here also like, uh, we have talking sex tapes and all kinds of celebrity, uh, musicians that are into wacky, wild stuff. This one's a little more fun. It has nothing to do with children. It's just a fun guy, you know, shut with Barry. Barry Barry, you know my cousin. It's your cousin Marvin. Marvin Berry. Yeah. Yeah. That this is a, this is credited with being the pioneer of Brock and was like the king of rock and roll. Yeah. He's the man. Well, he also, uh, enjoyed filming women that he would have sex with and uh, doing a number of demeaning things to them. And in fact, he has a sex tape somewhere in this world, but because of the time of that, it was in like the sixties or seventies or whatever, you know, we don't have it heavily distributed.

Speaker 8:          01:00:31       So what I've gone through is the transcript of the sex tape and I've delivered it to you so we can reenact it today. That's the role of Berry will be Tom Secura and in the role of blonde, white whore. Thank, we'll be Christina P. Wow. Will you read the salaried, the stage directions?

She continues gasping as he continues to Piss. Take it. Take it. Take over your mouth. Open your mouth, the sound of Piss, gurgling in her mouth, and then Barry unleashes a loud, long parts. You could smell my farts. Piss on you. That's what I'm doing. Pissing all over you. You love me. Tell me you love me. I love you. All right then drink my piss. Drink my piss.

There's Piss all over your neck and your head, but you love me. I love you. I won't. I won't betray you. I won't betray. You have a believer. He leans in to kiss her, then stops immediately. I can't kiss you. Smells like piss. I know. I'm sorry. Clean yourself off. Take a shower. He walks out of the tub as she turns on the Faucet to clean herself

Speaker 4:          01:03:29       and saying, wow, that was really good stuff. It was nice. We should send that one off for like Chuck Berry and the bio page. Is that what it's like for the movies? When you guys do your table reads exactly like that. I kind of want to send that to a couple of directors. Yeah, you could.

Speaker 8:          01:03:46       I mean, could play some

Speaker 4:          01:03:48       abusive. Yeah. Yeah. He, oh, abusive guy. A number one God, I would love to play something like that. What do you mean? That's perfect for you? So what I'm saying, it's an instant family. You're a jerk in that movie. Yeah. But I mean he wasn't pissing in Fart on girls. That mean? Is that what you took into the role in your mind? You're like, okay, I'm showing the behind the scenes chuck berry. Um, we, uh, this was great. Thank you. As always. Josh, thanks for having me. I hope I see everyone. March 22nd Hollywood improv lab. 10:00 PM get your tickets. Yeah. Yeah. Your mom's house. We'll be right back and we are back. Everyone peed and farted and eight and we are back now with one of our all time faves. Um, a real country singer. It is wheeler Walker Jr. Thank you very much. [inaudible] guys. I love dailer.

Speaker 4:          01:04:39       The new place is fucking killer. Thanks man. Steakhouse vibes studio. What'd you call the studio jeans? Yes. Inside Studio G. I liked how you didn't model it after studio g. You actually can put shit up. Yeah, that's right. It's not just an empty conference room. That's right. That's right. You know, I didn't, I didn't really notice that your right wheeler that he just doesn't even bother decorating it. Oh, he didn't give a shit that he thinks people are just going to fucking look at him. Yeah, he's right. Right before he snap somebody's neck. And we hope one day he tells us where the bodies are. But Garth is a really, he, we were talking about creeper musicians, you know, we didn't talk about, yeah, we didn't have, um, I was trying to think of his name

Speaker 12:         01:05:18       and uh, Jerry Lee Lewis. Yes. He married her 13 year old 18 year olds. Nice. That's like pedophilia, an incest. And then Elvis, I mean she was a fucking teenager, but the room, I think the story that he tried to tell was he met her when she was 15 and then they get married at like 19 or whatever the legal, I waited, I waited finally. I mean does it, it not get what he wants, you know, but we were just talking about the Chuck Berry thing. Man, I love Chuck Berry, but the day he died, um, you tweeted the p video and I was kind of bombed like fucking Chuck Berry, man. It was crazy. And that I was alive at the same time and I started getting bummed out about it. And once you see him pissing on white women and kind of, you know, just kind of, and you can bring your base like, you know what, I'll be, I'll be fine.

Speaker 12:         01:06:11       So it helps you. I helped you grieve in a way. Do you have no idea? But there was no, I grieved for about half a second until I saw him fucking pissing off women. I'm gonna, you know, world's probably better off if I do love him. His music. Yeah. Yeah. Well that's, we we're talking about that weighing the, the fame and the talent against doing something horrible. Yeah. I mean it's, it's strange too, because we were talking about before, it's like, do I let my life, am I allowed to listen to thriller now? Like, how's it going? You know? But you definitely are allowed, but it's like, does it play, does it play a game in your mind? Having listened to us since I watched that thing, which by the way, and I don't want to start controversy, I think he's guilty and the doc I saw, but I just don't want to get myself in trouble here and start, you know?

Speaker 12:         01:06:52       Yeah. You know, I'm not the judge and jury. Right. But there was a lot of evidence, you know, once I hear about the actual blood and the anus, I'm like, I think this guy did it. Yeah. And then I'm like, but, but thrillers such a great, it's not a bad note in the whole thing. It's amazing. It's so difficult. But it does make you wonder. I mean, now we're just in an era where we're accepting that our heroes are pieces of shit. How many of our past heroes have been pieces that we don't even know about or even know about? I don't see nothing wrong. Well, my, my thing is just always assume they're a piece, a piece of shit. I mean, everybody who's talented, Amy, I mean, you guys know, I mean, you didn't get into comedy because like you had your all your shit together and I didn't start playing music cause like, man, I got it all figured out.

Speaker 12:         01:07:39       Now I'm going to get, it was this guy was covering up a lot of fucking shit. Yeah. But not an island stuff. Right. I mean, um, pedophilia, no violence, no pedophilia. I've lived a pretty clean life compared to, well the people, you mean what's your big vice though? You have a big vice. Um, cause you don't really seem like you're my, I guess my advice would, would say fucking, but now that I'm married, you know, I didn't even know you were married. Married. Yeah. I'm married with a kid. That's what ww three my new records about w three is named after my son Wheeler Walker. The third. Oh my fucking name man. Congratulations. When I talk to people and Catch Ketchup, I forget some of the details. Yeah. Wow. So that's what the new record is all about. Low Wheeler. Yeah. He's basically retired. The pussy king. You want?

Speaker 12:         01:08:25       Yeah, I mean, I mean he's done conquering all the walls. Now I'm teaching him, but that's like some of the new songs, you know, all the pussy you will slay telling him about the new. Right, right. Was He, he's going to get and training him. Yeah. He's, he's Pussy King Jr and you know, she's, my wife has, is she has her own Instagram. She's the Pussy Queen, you know? Really? Yeah. God Damn. Wow. I want to see some pics. Yeah, we got to look her up. No, now I'll take a soda Pussy Queen. The pissy queen. How did, so how'd you meet him? Shoot, I was playing a Gig in Alabama and she came back in the days when I was meeting chicks after gigs and we, and I was like, oh, I'll just banger and take off. But I kept talking. I was like, fuck, I want to talk to talk to her again.

Speaker 12:         01:09:07       You know what's her handle? Is that it? No. Yeah, that's her not as good. I that's, I don't know who that is yet. Her, what's her hand? Her Instagram handle. It might be miss, Ms. Wheeler Walker. I don't know. I forget. I got off social media to tell you that did, why I fucking over it. You know, the main, my main thing was like when I first started out and I took over country music. You guys saw it. Of course. I was all, it was all about, I felt like I was, I was, the new guy was punching up. I love it. And, but now that I'm bigger than these fuckers, I just feel like it's, I'm bored. It's like people, I make fun of these new country shit holes. There's all this news, garbage pop country, but I've figured them so I can get some kind of punching down and these people cry and complain to their managers and Shit.

Speaker 12:         01:09:55       She's like, it's just not worth it anymore than like now they're coming on. They would go on my Instagram and try to insult, insult back. I'm just like, I don't have time for this shit. The point was to get rid of Shitty pop country, Florida, Georgia line, Florida. Georgia line is still a lot bigger than me, but, but the, all these new, the Florida Georgia line wannabes, they just don't have time to like insult it. Cause Contra national man there, they got new shitty artists coming out of every 10 minutes. It's like I can factory. Who Do you hate right now? Um, well there was this guy called, he's still around, but that was a good, the fire just, it didn't feel right. It's like, why am I, why am I shitting on this guy that no one's even heard of? The name was Mitchell 10 penny as a real fucking name isn't really stupid named Bi.

Speaker 12:         01:10:38       And um, he had a song called bitches and I just got pissed cause I had song called fuck you bitch. Which I felt was emotional song and that's a huge hit, Bucky, that he just, so then he just took bit, he's like, he's like literally just like, I'm sick of bitches. I'm like, that's not what my song was in. And he like has a big label behind it and was trying to pretend like it wasn't a fee, was like, that's a whole nother thing saying I hate bitches versus fuck the girl who dumped me, I think fuck you bitch bitches about a particular person. Yes, exactly. I mean, I don't want to get into an argument with this dope about it, but it just, but him on, I was going down like I don't want to wake up in the middle of the night and just tweet at some random read and write.

Speaker 12:         01:11:19       Yeah. Yeah. Understandable. And these aren't this, I mean I've said it before. I do think most country artists and fans, you know, even though you know that, do you mean football is so big in the south and high school football? I really think the majority of country fans have CTE. I think that's where this shit, you don't listen to, you don't listen to friends in low places a hundred times. Cause cause you're all there, you know something's wrong. And these people, and I think the artists have it too, cause everyone I've talked to like yeah, I'll meet these guys on the screen somewhere, fans and I'll talk to them like something there. Yeah. You're like, what? So what did you play? College ball or, yeah, that's it. Yeah. They all, I mean nowadays like Sam Hunt, who was one of the big guys I went after, he was, uh, a college QB. So I think my, my, my theory checks out because these dudes, I mean to, to like this kind of music, you got to get hit in the head a lot. Yeah. Yeah. I think you, I think you solving real. Yeah, no, I do. I swear to God. I mean, when, if there's a, if you can fill up Wrigley field. Yeah. With Florida, Georgia line fans, that's a lot of, I mean they all got car wrecks or something, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:12:21       Right. But even going to see Garth and hearing friends in low places for the thousandth time. I mean, do we have enough of friends and little bright places? And I, I've had off, I've had it.

Speaker 12:         01:12:32       Yeah. I mean that was the thing. And we talked about a little bit, I think last time I was here, which is people don't under like right now because country music is basically computers and bullshit and stuff. That's crazy. That's, that's found its way into country. Yeah. Cause I mean they're trying to do our Kelly and there's going to be an art Kelly of country. I guarantee you somebody who's coming. Yeah. I mean the stories I hear about these artists, they're just, these guys are fucking degenerates. Um, but like people don't understand that when in the late eighties, early nineties, like it was Dwight Yoakam, Alan Jackson, good country, ours and black and Clint black. And then Garth came along. He was the Florida Georgia line at the time cause he was playing that real pop shit. Yeah. All those guys hated Garth and people. Now I get why they get pissed when I make fun of Garth but all but you got to remember, cause I'm older than these fucking dudes, they at the time Garth was Florida, Georgia line. You know, he was a guy. I didn't realize that. Yeah, because he was, you hear it not like it's the so slick and keep me going for pop radio.

Speaker 1:          01:13:29       Well its soul. I personally, from what I've heard, cause I watched part of that, um, Notre Dame concert. Oh God. That was all, yeah. And I, and I was like, okay, where's the soul? And I, and I, I'm not, listen, I'm not an Aficionado of country music, but when somebody sinks from their fucking heart, you know, you listened to Dolly Parton singing Jolene or whatever you like, that really grabs you emotionally. But for him, there's, I don't feel that from him with authenticity. Yeah. You did a lot of bullshit,

Speaker 12:         01:13:57       but would you, if you just heard it on a blind taste test, would you think that was country music? Probably not. No. It's like pop. Yeah. To me it's just like kind of almost like just pop songs with me. Yeah. And at that time, him getting all that success kind of made all the other guys try to sound like Garth. And I was trying to be the new Garth and people like Alan Jackson were just I to, I want pedal steel. I want to play country music, you know? But anyway, fuck him. He's fat, he's fat.

Speaker 6:          01:14:26       He's the worst version of the gummies fam, man. Um, yeah. So speaking of, uh, old g, by the way, how old wheeler? Like being married with a kid,

Speaker 12:         01:14:40       I fucking love it, honestly. It's just, it's like you don't always reminds me of, which is kind of my dumb movie references. Remember enough, Forrest Gump, when he like got that thing in the mail with the, that he'd like had had um, put, he'd put a bunch of money on apple stock before it, like got big and he just, he just like Forrest Gump, just like dope, get some thing in the mail. Like he's like a billionaire. He's like, oh, there's one less thing to worry about. That's how I kind of feel

Speaker 6:          01:15:06       I got married. I'm done. Like, it's just like pussy, one less thing to worry. I don't have to do deal with it anymore. The fucking texting and you know, look going out on dates. I just hated all that shit. How she feel about you, you know, Torrin as this country artist and you know, doing shows on the road

Speaker 12:         01:15:25       knows I'm going to, I mean it's, she knows what you guys know is that I'm the most honest and cleanest guy out there, so there ain't gonna nothing to worry about, you know?

Speaker 6:          01:15:32       Yeah. So hold on one second. We've got to stop one second. Well that was fun. Um, thank you for the Burp. Introduction to, yeah. Well, you know, I just try to keep it real on the show. Keep it true to who we are. You said it. Sorry. Let's take a break. I was talking about my wife had to whack off, so, yeah. Yeah. I didn't want, he didn't want to do it on the cameras. Oh, she's so electric. You've met her on just like one of your regular Gig and had gig gig outside of immobile and you're like, I'm just going to bang and leave. And then I kept thinking about her and then what, how, here's what happened.

Speaker 12:         01:16:00       There's a song on my new album, ww three. I'll hold it up for the listeners. Yeah. Um, and uh, this song called stilling sick of fucking you, which is real. That's real. Cause I'm, I'm so dumb. I didn't know. I don't know what love is. You know, this is my first love album and it just, that's how I'm, and I'm admitting it. I don't, I just didn't know how fucking dumb, I was like fucking this girl was cool fucking her second. And it's like, after 50 times is this love cause I just still want to keep fucking her and that is love. That's what I, I finished and I got off the bed ago. I could do that like a bunch of more times, like even till I die. And I go, that's probably what my parents were telling me about when they met each other. That's probably exactly what they meant, but it's just like, but you know, I like to say it in my own way. So let's, I'll do a song. What's Mama think it was Mama Walker? Think of, oh, she loved it. They all love her because she's normal. I mean not normal to me. And they love having a grandkid that they hope won't ever hear my music. But let me just now about almost a year. He's a year old. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:17:03       So exciting. Now. Um, uh, the three of us, you know, really like to dissect g and m

Speaker 12:         01:17:10       a lot of his antics. You actually, we're always on the lookout for new g, uh, footage and, and material and that you actually pointed out this twice. You have a g alert. What's it called? Google alert and the alert for the g alerts. Yeah, he put on hang. That was so fucking ridiculous. He did like his own trip. You know that Bohemian rhapsody moving? Yeah. That was like, but can that guy be any fucking weirder? Think they always say it. It's like, man, he was so great. He seemed just like him. I think it'd be just like the dude's kind of w it's like, is that really acting and some impersonation. That's true. But anyway, so Garth did this tribute to the movie like freelance. I don't think it's part of the promotion. Did it on his own. He just loves him and shot it with like real like you know like the g live in studio g's like fucking iPhone cameras. This is like fucking film cameras and it looks like he's ejaculate and the whole fucking time he said, you've never seen anybody, I haven't seen this anybody to see anything more than he loves queen. And he starts kind of singing along and moving his hands. You know, like, like he, he gets so into the music that I, like I said, I think he's wet himself. You gotta tell me how to set up my ga alerts.

Speaker 12:         01:18:25       Yeah. Oh God. Yeah. No, let's, let's do the things that Freddie mercury flamboyant entertainer from across the water had in common was this kid. And I'll cost the drafter wash. Oh boy can secure as hell under the music. I saw the courage. He always goes a creepy rough, still important. But wait, wait till he plays a museum. Starts doing this thing. It's already more to crunch. Oh my God, I'm going to be actual lunch man. The music, every time they stepped up to the micro over time. Some parents, it's kind of weird to wear your own GE. Ha. Like should I get t hats and wear them? Would you wear a t hat? You're t hat, I'm wearing mine. You are yours. Well, I've wheeler Walker Jr hats and I put it on once, you know, if I forget a habit, I just, I feel so stupid wearing, it's so dumb because as you, well, it's like, it's kind of like, can I, can I say it from the jump?

Speaker 12:         01:19:18       What are ready? I'm annoyed with, with him is this phony Baloney. I'm, I'm just a humble boy from Oklahoma and you know, and he like, he's so accepting like, oh, run the tractor from across the water to a humble boy. Oh, you can't say Angland mode fucker. Yeah, well that's cross the water. The other thing too that I don't, that annoys me is like the hottest shit right now is that movie and Queen. So he's like, no, it's really about me. You know, it's like people are missing the point of the movie, which the point of the movie is the Garth loves queen. That's Louie. How he sees, he has to make it about his queen resurgent is about Garth loving, ah, forgot the garlic. Loved him before the movie. Just to just like make a movie with a reminder. There's a Ge logo here. There's a Ge logo here. Yeah, there's a Ge logo here. There's a Ge logo here. All right, go ahead. Go. They what was impossible and impossible was every day thing for them.

Speaker 13:         01:20:12       Yeah. It's all done in a zillion part. Harmony. Find me somebody that tap

Speaker 12:         01:20:26       Jesus Christ. Man, I think he just came in his pants and he's young and he's also just like, you know, he's, he wants it to look like he's, he's conducting queen. He writes do this was recorded 30 years ago. Motherfucker like he has a part of it. There's a check this shit out right here. Like that. Just like, yeah. He's like, he's like, as if he quieted them down, say no dude, that song's been the same since we've been listening to it. So insufferable. Got, yeah, the ego. He's such a weird fucking guy. He should've played fraud mercury and they'd be like, you know, we had this one weird guy. I auditioned for it. You're weird as fuck too. Why don't you do it? Well, he did want it to be Chris, the Chris Gaines, his foray into that be crazy. If he's like, he got his demand is people putting it on. He's like, he thinks he looks like, I think I'll go to make it. Listen, I don't look exactly like him, but you know, get the guys who did fucking jar jar just make me look like a total where he just like, he had aids. Man, you're like, you just, you're way too much.

Speaker 12:         01:21:33       There's nobody that sounds like Wayne.

Speaker 13:         01:21:35       And that just tells me how far ahead of their time they find me. Somebody to love digging into those lyrics that no matter how different mean you are, the basis thing is

Speaker 12:         01:21:47       again, with this love one another bullshit. He invented that by the way. You know what we were just talking about the darkest motherfuckers, Michael Jackson, who else? Uh, the cause they, cause they all have these bullshit and messages of like, he takes kind of love the world. You get a huge world with love. Meanwhile they're doing dark stuff behind closed doors. Uh, Garth doc, 40 years from now. Oh, 100% there. And it'll be like all, they'll just show footage. Like this guy, he was always like, hi y'all. Hi. Got To waving and smiling and then you know his billboards like let's just let us love one another and then it'll be like, and this is where he cut people's hands off and it'll be like on his ranch. I could see him. He looks like he like works out, but it looks like there's a little extra pounds from, well, yeah. Well I watched Tricia's baking channel and he and Trish make a lot of bad treats. Like it's, you know, corn flake, peanut butter balls. Can you see on one day watching that you see like a fingernail or something?

Speaker 12:         01:22:53       She's like, what is this? He's like, I'll tell you, I keep finding these air. I don't know what this is, baby. Just some bullshit spin on it. Oh boy. Chen had a body and find me all the stuff that separates us, that divides us, the draw boundaries between us. He says, find me somebody to love and all of that. There's the message for me, for him, for him forever. God, I never look at lyrics that way. You actually know that the lyrics were about something besides you. Right. He thinks is funny. Some might love was written about the garden. He thinks they took a time machine and like it's so, yeah, you're absolutely right. Really like he took away too.

Speaker 12:         01:23:39       Yeah. But it ends with like, uh, like the like the logo Bohemian rhapsody like it's a, it's like a Promo for the movie that the movie didn't even want. I was like, I love that movie. I'm going to make them a promo. And I think they thought they were gonna use it at the Oscars or something. Every time he wants to really make a point on any of his social media, he always always goes to, and then I, he talks like that always has to do is sexy voice and like it's, it's so forced and it's, it just sends shivers. I really liked that. Really like that kind of like his weight. It's like, it's like you're still the same dumb fucking yeah. Thought. It's just softer. It is. It is a soft or dumb thought. I'm, I'm a step above you. I, you guys could use it in the morning. He'll respect him. I don't know. I just think he's fucking sucks. Wow. I think he's, he's eating the big three for me on town. Annoying and fat.

Speaker 12:         01:24:42       Where do you fit on that scale? Well, I think, um, Bert Kreischer we certainly got the fat and he's certainly got the, um, no, I don't find them as well. I personally, I don't hang out with them enough. I'll bet he could hit two of those and you know, yeah. I haven't spent any, maybe definitely near the end of that when I'm on the podcast. Like two more hours. He would, he would, he could get into Garth's, right? Yeah. I don't think he eats people though or no, I don't know either. I don't think so either. But it's good to know that the Burt's on his way to be quick card. Well yet be cool if he could sell out of Notre Dame. Fuck. Here we go. Here's the Weirdo.

Speaker 14:         01:25:29       Everyone had Garth Brooks here in iconic Notre Dame locker room. This is where the players go out to take the field every Saturday. This is where all our players are getting ready to take the field for this concert. So tonight the fighting Irish, they're going to become the singing Irish. This is going to be good.

Speaker 12:         01:25:44       Can you just picture him on the way up? Teams have players, bands have played on. Just came up with that role started from, and do you also, you realize too that there'll be like, there's like a CBS executive is like, Hey, we were thinking for the Promo. He was like, I got the fucking promo and then he wrote the copy. You guys think hundred percent yeah, no, I think, oh my gosh. Jesus

Speaker 14:         01:26:09       legendary coach had this sign put up. That's now probably one of the most famous sides and football history. Play like a champion today.

Speaker 4:          01:26:18       I love that. I love that. But look at his face right there. Just even see that's why that smiles, that skeletons exactly. Fingers chopped off in a bowl somewhere. He only smiles with his mouth, never his eyes. That's how you can tell a smile is fake.

Speaker 12:         01:26:37       He says there's just butts stuff going on.

Speaker 4:          01:26:39       Yeah. Do you wear wheeler on stage? Do you do the the Janet Jackson headset or do you do

Speaker 12:         01:26:45       her phone? I do them. I would never wear that headset. It's the fucking corniest thing ever. Stupid. But that's the thing too is like what does he need it for? He's not going of course at dancing, but don't forget the old early days, like when he used to come into my home town, he would, they'd pull them, they'd be hanging from that fucking wire, you know, flight fly around like Bon Jovi. Now he's too fat for that show. And the wired, you know, he's, he's worth too much to too many people. The wire would fucking break and now he's just kind of got that place. Yeah, that's his name. It his biography to five for the wire. They used to fly him around there.

Speaker 4:          01:27:22       I did not know. Now what is it? I have friends in low places and then he's up high. Is that the, they probably tried to rig it once, you know, and they're like, this thing's not really flying

Speaker 14:         01:27:34       because the a special light at Notre Dame and keep the party going by streaming all of our music exclusively on Amazon music. Hey Alexa, do you have friends in low places?

Speaker 4:          01:27:46       Sometimes, but they aren't big on social graces. She got to love that. He's the

Speaker 12:         01:27:52       only person who likes it. Yeah. Yeah. You know his music, it's not on iTunes. I was going to ask you that. Do you know what the deal is with that? Why is he doing that? Yeah, no, he, he um, well what happened was when iTunes and all the other, like Spotify came out and he decided to make like I'm not making this up, like not instead of MP, he decided to make his own format. Like instead of MP three, he had like a GP P G's. Yeah. It was like, yeah, it was like Julio g p three. Yeah. It was like eight or whatever it was like his own, he was like going to come up with a better one than my own form. I said, put it on my fucking, you know, just, I'm bigger than apple. I'm doing, I've got a g phone, I don't have an iPhone.

Speaker 12:         01:28:31       Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. I'm sure someone, some asshole wants to write g cross out all the eyes. But he tried to compete with them, but come up with a format. So they, and the also, he didn't want to give them the 30% cut that like everybody does. And so then he got, he, he was like, I'll just be, he put out an offer to all of them, whoever's going to pay me the most gets it. Cause I ain't playing all your fucking games, you know. So he's like, Amazon made the biggest offer and he's, you can only get it on Amazon. Yeah. So if you, if you're, if you've got an iPhone, you don't have Amazon, you don't hit guard, you don't get the card.

Speaker 4:          01:29:06       Oh Wow. I'm really, it's gotta be the one of the only, I mean, I know about title and all that, but it's like he's gotta be the only major artists where you can't hear one fucking thing

Speaker 12:         01:29:16       on iTunes. Nothing silly. Yeah. Yeah, no, there was weird sometimes on the country charts like, like iTunes will sell like um, you know, like some no name or somebody playing the hits of Garth. That'll actually just to just to get some Garth on there. Yeah. Or like, you know, like not a fake Garth, but you know, attribute to Garth Brooks will actually, people will buy that cause they're good when they searched Garth, nothing comes up except for, you know, but I think it's a blessing because I actually want to take my shit off Amazon so I'm not being sold anywhere where Garth is.

Speaker 4:          01:29:46       I like that too. Hello? I like that. He always says that at the end of everything. And I, and I really love that and isn't that I like that. Oh, you can't come up with another tagline.

Speaker 14:         01:29:57       It's called the word of life. Student body calls a touchdown. Jesus because it overlooks the north end zone here and the house that Rockne bill touchdown. Jesus was assembled by stone, gathered from all seven continents. This is the place, this is where everybody comes together. All religions, all shapes and sizes. And they're all here to sing. That's what I love about it

Speaker 4:          01:30:19       today. I love, I would love to see him like that. Like the footage after when they're like in now, just uh, we're going to take you down this way. He's like, why the fuck am I up here right now? Like I would love to see him snap and drop the wholesome thing, you know,

Speaker 12:         01:30:34       and eat like a camera man saying just take a bite. Well I told him, I was telling you guys before you didn't know this. So apparently that Notre Dame concert, it was so big that you'll usually for live concert movies, they'll do two shows and pick the best of both cases. Miss miss a note here or there, but he's like, I'm playing two fucking shows. So if you, if all those hundred thousand people, if they fucked up a song, they had to do it again. You had to sit there at live at a concert you paid money for and if he fucked up, you had to start from the beginning. Beginning again. The live TV taping. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:31:05       Jesus, 700,000 and it's like five hours long. Yeah, no, it was, it was a little long. We'll just do two shows because that's how long it'll take you five hours anymore. Well, he don't got that kind of time, you know?

Speaker 15:         01:31:18       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:31:22       France in Notre Dame stadium didn't rhyme or it doesn't fit. No, it does.

Speaker 12:         01:31:28       Since then, have you had one more hit that people know that you can read it? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:31:33       yeah, yeah. I got friends in Notre Dame stadium. Legend has it that knew Rodney said this when we're on the road where somebody else's gas, let's play in a way that never lets him forget that we visited them. That's what we're doing tonight. And new. You're not going to forget this concert day. How many times? Not really bad. I'd forgotten like since it aired. Yeah. Yeah. Well you think of that buckle. That's like intense buckle, right? Well I don't, they'd light and the light blue denim on. And then is he wearing dark denim or is it black pants? Uh, I think he's wearing just Dickies. You know, he's going to go keep it real grounded. Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah. No, those are elastic pants. I'll bet you that, that those pants come like with the buckle, like sewed on children's story. Everybody. Garth Brooks here, this is going to be good. I love that. I got to love that.

Speaker 14:         01:32:29       Touchdown. Jesus. Touchdown. Jesus. All shapes and sizes. That's what I love. Not any times. Don't miss it.

Just kind of like, people are like, why'd you go so serious? I'm like, it's serious shit. Is this 2019 the serious shit going? Yeah. I'm growing up. I'm married, I've got a kid, I'm, I'm fucking mature. You know? Here's my song about sucking dicks. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 12:         01:37:59       Wow. I'm a, I'm like affected by that too. It is nice to see you. Growing up I was, I was a little worried about you. You only mold, people get worried, but you know, I'm always going to, you know, I still feel like it's still me. You know? It is because I remember last time we spoke, you know, think your mom went to one of your shows and she was like, God, I have, I mean, you know, you sing so beautifully in this one. She loved this one. She loves, she understands where I'm coming from. It's like serious stuff, you know? Yeah. So now she gets it. Yeah, it took a while. But this is a song like that that like, you know what? Our Son has a heart. He's serious. He's an artist. That's what I wanted to hear. How about your dad? He still thinks I'm a fucking degenerate, but he's also fucking asshole. Yeah, I don't care about him. Yeah, he's a Dick.

Speaker 12:         01:38:47       Tell us about it. I Dunno, but I told you, I tell you that some, there's a guy on Twitter who claims to be my dad wheeler walker senior anyway, and he yells at me every fucking day. Really? That he's, yeah, that he's like, but what's weird is I haven't told him to stop because he does sound like, I don't know how he know. He just like eat everyday tweets that he's disappointed with me and he hates me and I wanted to say, you know, get my manager or something to take it down. But it's, it's pretty close to what my dad's actually like. I enjoy reading it. Is Your Dad, is he like, you know, you with this nonsense music? Is he like, is he like that? Well, he's like that until I buy them. You know, a fucking fucking airpods, you know, and then he's like, well, you know, he's a fan.

Speaker 12:         01:39:26       He's like, it's like headphones or no fucking cords, you know. And then all of a sudden he's like, oh this, this, these songs are dirty. But they're pretty cool because he can't fucking afford airpods fucking life depended on it. You did. You guys have an air pocket. Cool. I don't have him. I got, but I don't want them. No, you need fucking half too. I feel like the strong army and all this new shit. It's fucking cool. I was just talking about that with a friend of mine the other day about, he was talking about, he has like PC products, you know, for Mac or whatever it's called. Um, but like I want stuff made by, I don't like the Fuck Bill Gates, you know, given all that money to charity. I want the asshole who hates who, just a fucking Dick who's focusing on the shit. Yeah. Bill Gates, all his shit as courts.

Speaker 12:         01:40:09       I want that. The air pods with the no cords because that dude hated everybody and wanted to get back at people. So we figured out how to make the fucking headphones with no court dates is just spending money like saving Africa. Fuck off. Fuck all that shit. Just focus dude. By the way, I will give you a break on any air chartering you're looking for, uh, in future towards with this plane on, right? I'm sure you're at that level. I looked into it, but I don't think I'm going to get it. Well, I am and I just wanted to extend that to you. I'll give you, yeah, I'm, I'm I to admit I'm lost by private jet. I'm buying, I'm pretty close to it as a no, we lost a major sponsor, Mcdonald's this show, and we got two point $3 million and then they saw our content and they pull the money.

Speaker 12:         01:40:59       So we don't have the money anymore. Tom. I don't know their money. And that's not what I'm saying is Morton, we're the only, only gave us two grand over Morton's completely. And by the way, I like Larson's a lot more than Morton's, just so that the Morton's people can hear that. Well, I can, I just tell you right now, can I just say a lie to your face? I'm going to stop eating Mcdonald's in protest. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. It's not really that good or convenience. Right. That's a friend right there. Thank you for if my, if Mcdonald's link there to buy my friends at jet. Fuck them. No, I know. I'll give you six to 8% off any, any charters you're looking for until you cool, man. What's his company? It's just could be Tom's planes. Oh, I thought you were about to do a promo.

Speaker 6:          01:51:43       So I, for now though, it can be where accessed

Speaker 17:         01:51:46       dash radio and mixed cloud. You could find some of our older shows, but dash radio, every Tuesday night we have a show from six to eight, a mix tape and then eight to 10 on hip hop acts. So there's an encore performance of how did you guys hook up? Man, this is wild. It was, I just know kb from where we're homies, right. We started off doing parties together. His uh, him and his brother promote, promote parties, uh, generally around porn events. So from the start, the very first party I did with them, it's porn influenced him. Just, you know, it, it turned out to be, you have a lot of fun, even make a couple of business opportunities and stuff and just things happening. So, you know, after awhile we started being friends and if you notice just now you know Katie, right? No, you don't know him. No. He was the one comic at the store that I don't know. Oh, he, he doesn't talk like that. No, I'm a white guy. That's really a black guy. Give him a microphone. He starts going and I used to go to broadcasting school.

Speaker 13:         01:52:46       Automatic shitty does, but he gets on the, every time we do an intro, say, hey guys, you're listening to all the west will radio. Yeah. Shut the fuck. Turn into Mr. Broadcaster Guy. I'm a strip club Dj. All slash gym club Dj. Okay. Okay. So that's why I got that from me. I got to say I'm, I'm s I look there, you know how there's a certain album

Speaker 6:          01:53:04       moms are music where it's like a time capsule where it takes you to like a certain era in your life. Yeah. So I remember I moved, I was living in the suburbs of Milwaukee and we moved freshman year of high school. So it's like a fall of 93 I moved to Florida, Vero Beach, Florida. And I remember it was like one of the first days I met at the school, but the middle of school year, Steve Renick comes up to me and he's like, we're playing football has just ended, some were in the locker room and he's like, do you burn bro? I was like, what? He's like, you smoke trees and shit. And I was like, oh yeah, I mean, you know? Yeah, I get, yeah. And then he's like, what of music you listened to? And I was like, I dunno. I like hip hop. He's like, you down with too short. I was like, what? I didn't know. And he was like, check this shit out. So he gave me getting where you fit in. That shit stayed in my CD player, not just through freshman year through getting my learner's permit through getting my driver's license.

Speaker 13:         01:54:04       You're telling me that too short helped you learn how to drive? I mean, I was like, I want to be a pimp. This is what I'm going to do with my life. It was under the tape to the tape gets stuck in your machine. It was man, it was my, it was that as a sign of the CD. So CD he waited till the skip to Oh yes, two matches up. Got a note, a new one. Lean in, you know, with the hat, the black hat to the side. And I was like, this is what I want to do with my life, man. I was like, well, you know it, a lot of people get it, but the majority of people don't get it. That part of the, the two short legacy, the, the things that uh, make certain songs timeless. Yeah. Is that it's uh, it's very informative.

Speaker 13:         01:54:41       Very Educational, very motivational. Absolutely. It's, it's, it's almost like, um, like a motivational speaking technique thing. Sure. Because when I write songs, I don't write songs and, and say things like everybody. Yeah, I'm really wrap from me. They're like one person. Yeah. And many listeners, like if you were in your car by yourself, you'd like, this motherfucker's talking to me. Like, especially like songs, like getting it, it's just like talking to somebody like you got to get, I write like that. So I just, I make references like I'm just talking to you and it makes everybody like act like they, they think they know me when they see me and I'll kind of shit. So it works but, but when you add up, add them all together. Yeah, all the albums, all the songs and just the ones that you gravitate towards. After awhile you look back and go to sharp taught me some shit. Yeah, man. Absolutely. You did teach me some shit. He's looking at me like I'm crazy now. I know. It's funny we

Speaker 1:          01:55:31       had it, but I'm just listening the way rappers think lake, we had big daddy Kane in here and he talked about studying the greats, his whole thing. He listened to Marvin Gaye and he kind of was like, oh, that's how you're, you're, you know a, and I'm

Speaker 18:         01:55:44       listening to you talk and your whole thing is, I'm not talking to millions of people. I'm going to talk to one person. So my wheels are just turning it. How different rappers approach a persona. You gotta figure out how to maximize presenting that and stuff. He knows same thing on the stage with comedy, whatever. Same thing with acting methods and stuff. But you know, big Daddy Kane, he as some point, so many ladies wanted to like fuck him. I guess. He's like, he realized he was a sex symbol and he's, he started his early days. He was just like, uh, a tech to Mc that would just attack you and just, yeah, just murder you on the microphone. And then he turned into a sex symbol. So, you know, it's interesting though, because like what you just said, that sounds silly, but Oprah Winfrey talks about that too. And she talks to the audience. She's not talking to millions of people. She's like, I'm talking to one woman who was sitting in her living room right now, or she probably liked me early on. Learned that that thing works. That personally, how did you figure that out?

Speaker 13:         01:56:42       Uh, doing shows, just, um, I perfected my technique riding on the public transit bus with a big ass radio and wrapping at like really hardcore ghetto house parties where two things on the bus, if you plan some music to the public as like loud and obnoxious and somebody is gonna say, turn that shit off, you're gonna get like, like, like some kind of back back lash. But, but people used to like love my shit. And then at house parties it's like, it's, you know, you're at a party where there's no rules, regulations, there's no security. There's, there's just people who, uh, you know, have quick tempers and they don't tolerate bullshit. So I used to go to those house parties and and rock the really rough crowds and shit and I knew I could do it and that was the all confidence. So later in life she just was like, it was almost easy for me to like to present the two short persona and nobody was doing, what was that doing that back in the day either rappers weren't really cursing alive, they really weren't talking about pimp shit. They was, it was a very new area and like when he got that CD

Speaker 18:         01:57:54       he's like pimping, you know, remind me. It was like I used to have to go to the basement to watch def jam or like Eddie Murphy. I could not like sometimes I would put, I give a CD to like my parents have put in the car and that shit would be permissible. Like fat boys are like run DMC to show. I was like, give me that shit man. I know he's got secret. Yeah. Yeah. He was saying like dirty, like I still love, I can't tell you how many times,

Speaker 13:         01:58:28       just like endless hundreds, thousands of people who have come to me and said I got caught listening

Speaker 18:         01:58:34       too short when I was little and I got my ass whooped. Yeah, yeah, for sure. Like lots of gas weapons. Yeah. I mean you said some foul

Speaker 13:         01:58:42       shit, but you also had, remember I told that story on our show about how he brought it back to New York and the Dominicans all her too short and then he became a hero and he stopped being picked on. He was the coolest guy in New York. Yeah. But um, my favorite is the one where you get to borrow mom's car or something. Yeah. Accidentally. And then she gets in. It's like we have to talk, but you know, know something. I'm still alive. I was in high school, I started writing really dirty rhymes in high school. Yeah. I learned, I learned early on the first time I've said a curse word. It was like I said something like I had 10 holes, second 10 toes, and this was like, I was in 10th grade that play. And people just laugh and I'm like, I'm about to write a song about all 10 of these hoes and tell you how I met them all and just tell you a story about my 10 holes.

Speaker 13:         01:59:33       And it just, it just escalated. And um, I just don't know. I just, I just swear I learned early on man that, that, that talking shit just yeah, but also like, you know, Talk Shit. Uh, but you also had like, you were drawn to like funky ass base. Well the music is the sneaky, right. I mean that's the, that's what I am an old lady telling me, um, I love your music. It's like don't really care for the words. Right. But I loved the music. Yeah. Yeah. We're still a compliment to you though, man. She's like, she's, she's developed a technique where she could just ignore me. Yeah. And they caught the man. Who Do you think it came? Cause it sounds like the bus and all that, that's it's equivalent to like what the open mic is for the comedian. You know, you're doing sometimes harsh bars and biker bars and places where they don't want to fucking hear you taught.

Speaker 13:         02:00:25       So you better come in some shit that's going to get attention and you talk about some too short stuff, you're going to get attention. You're talking about bitches fucking your stuff. And I had a rat partner in high school and our f w when we decided to try to sell our music in the streets, our first customers were drug dealers who were actively working. Really so because the logic was, well, if you want to sell it, who's got money? Right? So instantly we, uh, we got, we got a drug dealer to buy one tape and then, um, the other guys around where like, I want one too. So the next day we came back and sold him some more tapes and it was each like, uh, uh, tape you had to make, you know what I mean? The set tapes. Yeah, I would. I would. Um, we would record a tape and then we copy it a few times and then I'm literally the drug dealers who were like three, four blocks over, they heard about it and they, they sent word that bring on some of those tapes to know and then we started doing like a drug dealer paper wrap kind of thing.

Speaker 13:         02:01:25       Like everywhere they would congregate to sell drugs, we'd pull up and they started to be a thing. Like I never had to try to sell music at the supermarket or at school or anything owner only drug dealers in and everybody. Did you foresee when you're selling the drug dealers these that like this is actually like, is it wild to you that it turned into like legit? No, we were in high school we were really just trying not to work at mcdonalds and shit like that. We went, we were not trying to be stars. We just wanting to get the money. Do you ever have this? This is like, do you ever have where you listen to a song, any song, and you realize you've been saying the lyrics the wrong way. You ever had that? Always do. Do you know that I paid you right? You know I paid, you know I licensed, so in my last special I licensed blowjob Betty. Okay, okay. I paid you so that I could say this line. I fucking said it wrong. I've been saying it wrong for 30 years or whatever. What would you say? Check it out. A bustle left nup right. Not in a jaw. Sperm on her cheeks. It's all dissolved. There you go.

Speaker 13:         02:02:30       It's all she saw that I said it wrong for fucking since it came out. It was cool. I was still made money back. It makes sense though. I get my money back. It makes sense. It is right. It does kind of make sense, but anyway, they're really dissolve though. It kind of just, did you feel bad when you killed her with your nut? Can we talk about that? That was actually like a proud moment because if you analyze this story, let's go through the store. Let's go through the story. The story starts off as a, she was a girl who did business with me and she was terrible at her job. Her job was to actually go out and date men and get their money and bring you the money. But she was such a party girl, she'd fucking forget and like partying just right.

Speaker 13:         02:03:16       She'd forget the part to say, pay me motherfucker. Yeah. So we call those thrills secrets. She wasn't really like about that. That get that money. Yeah. So I cut her loose and it just randomly saw her one night doing her little party girl thing and I'm like, you know what? I'm just going to step up to this like angrily faced fucker. Yeah. Yeah. So I did it. Yeah. And it just, it was so much anger in it, so much, you know, ah, yeah, fucking despise you. And it just, just hit that wrong pipe or something like that. I Dunno. Yeah. Then the next day you saw it on the news. Yeah. And the reason why it's not manslaughter, it's because the shit was, um, considered accidental. You know what I mean? Right, right, right. Yeah. And it was a bunch of guys. You couldn't say who did it.

Speaker 13:         02:04:01       There was no fucking, like, there was a DNA test or shit like that. So it was clear it was an act of God. Wow. That is like hearing the story from the Bible to you, like in a hostel. Yeah, that was great. That was like the blowjob Betty story. We just got to fucking hear that. Yeah, and that's awesome. But you're on your mom's house exclusive, but it's a, it's on the song in the song, you get to hear you say it, to actually explain it. Like I always thought about Betty, all the music is so infectious. And then in the end he goes, I bust a nut and killed the bitch. And you get a laugh and you're like, you forget the whole how the story started. Right. But she was pretty shitty at her job.

Speaker 15:         02:04:40       Yeah, true

Speaker 13:         02:04:45       man. I didn't even think about that whole part. You don't even think about this. She's had bad, she's bad editor, John Mann storytelling. How damn putting her in a position where she fucking up from the start. So you're not supposed to sympathize with her dad and she's supposed to earn. Yeah, she deserved that Shit. Cause you had a lot, I think I heard you say in an interview you weren't a pimp, but yet a lot of pimp affiliates so well from Oakland. Yeah. You know, anywhere you find a group of pimps. One, I'm from Oakland. I leave. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But um, I, um, I've never been a pimp, but I have received money from prostitutes. Does that make sense? I mean, because just out of like love and admiration, like is that why somewhat in, in a couple of instances it was just like grateful, like just being grateful. I learned things from you. Uh, one girl gave me a complete stranger, walked up and gave me $1,800 bills and say it one line, she said, you're the reason why I'm hauling. Wow. I walked away. I was in Las Vegas. Oh Wow. And I looked at it, I counted it. I turned to my buddy. I'm like, it's a chick just gave me $1,800 let's put it all in black. I look around and there's nobody there. It was like a fucking ghost. I don't know. Damn. So yeah, you got a story like that, Kevin.

Speaker 15:         02:06:03       I've got a lot of stories, but none, no women have ever given me $1,800. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         02:06:07       So do you feel like though, cause I feel like the, I already know the answer, but if you were, let's say tomorrow you wake up, you got nothing to your name, you could go out and pimp, like you know what to do. Right? Well you know, during the recession did a little pampering. You did. And really, you know, the economy was fucking up the show money slow. Now promoters weren't doing as many shows. Oh wait, oh wait, oh, oh a 19 guys fucked up time. So how do you find the house? How do you find a girl who's like, who's a good candidate throughout my entire career and it's not sincere. Like prostitutes really have been flirting with me. Like, like I went on a date with a chicken one night and we went to breakfast at like five in the morning and I didn't know she was a hoe.

Speaker 13:         02:06:59       She's a very nice looking young lady and she was questioning me a lot and I'm like, why the fuck are you asking all these questions? And she got to finish. It's like, she's like, I thought you, I thought this was like an interview. I thought, you know. Oh Wow. Really? I'm like, oh you're a oh you know. So things like that had happened periodically throughout my life. And I think, um, I hang around so many pimps. I grew up around it. I really felt like it was an alternative choice as far as a career options. But my parents really wanted me to go to college. They weren't super happy about the rap thing, but then they would have been really upset about the pimp thing if that. Yeah. So, um, along the way I learned a lot cause I would, I would actually study different things, literature and stuff about pimping, you know, shit like a iceberg slim just let us, it's a lot of shit out there that you can read.

Speaker 13:         02:07:53       Yeah. On top of two short albums and, and you know, too short songs, you can go out there and really study what this pimp thing is and it's not, it's, you know, the, the ugly side of it is the abuse and uh, you know, forcing of a woman to do things. She doesn't want to do the physical abuse deaths. That's the ugly side. There's a completely different side that is the more about what I like to rap about it and putting the songs and that's just like the finesse. It's just finessing the situation, which is a, you want to know who's a candidate. Yeah. Um, prime candidates would be like, okay, we are in Las Vegas and he had a few holes and slowly, Michelle, you lost all your hoes. You wake up one day, you got no Ellis. It's known. It's a known fact. You can jump on the highway like maybe the 15 drive up to Salt Lake City and you know it's got, it's just a great place to find holes. You know what I mean? Why Salt Lake City?

Speaker 4:          02:08:56       Well let, let's be, let's be specific. Why it like a little little lady like me. I know I went to old to be a Ho. Let's say it's me only 20 years ago. Am I, am I somebody that could, that you would choose as it came from? I grew up in the San Fernando Valley here. Los Angeles, La, a lot of holes for late one eight. Okay. But you know, I'll give you another scenario cause she's walking a resume is just like a bunch of little, you know, little naive, kind of not knowing kind of what you want. Right. Naive is what you need in that situation. You wouldn't mind getting away from the strict parents and shit. They had a bad girl on the other side. You go somewhere like Portland, Oregon. Okay.

Speaker 13:         02:09:37       They've got like hundreds of strip clubs and the stripper competition is like way up there. So in a lot of cases, strippers or like working every night making two, $300 bullshit. You pull up in there and like some fly ass car was so flyers, jury asking questions like how long have you been dancing?

Speaker 4:          02:09:56       About a year. Yeah. You know? Yeah. Yeah. I've been about a year. It's, I make like a couple hundred bucks a night and I get to ask some questions like, where do you live? How do you live? What do you drive with my boyfriend, we, we just ran a place around the corner, probably like of struggling as boyfriend type situation. He's, he's, you know, he's a musician. Hey, I was thinking pretty good. No you're not. He's struggling. He doesn't have a deal or anything. Stupid ass questions like, have you, have you ever been to Vegas? I've been, yeah. I Love Vegas. I mean, no, that's what they said. They say so, so far, so far we're vibing, right. And then you go get in the car, bitch. So far as I should, right in

Speaker 13:         02:10:34       I, yeah, go ahead. The easiest and quickest way is just a bigger and better deal. Oh Oh, so you I, yeah, so I'm like, I'm paying up Jager. I'm painting a bigger, better picture of everything that's going on in your life. And then I'm also informing you how, no, not right off the back though. But the numbers are really great. It really great. How much can I make with you? Like if I go with you, like I make $300 a night here and you don't tell her right away. You're going to be giving me all the money. Well what? Well, how does he get me to get in the car and go and leave my stupid boyfriend and stuff. And then do you offer it to be mine? I'm also establishing one thing that you don't fucking have great money management skills. You don't because you're in a fucked up position right now.

Speaker 13:         02:11:14       You really drive a fucked up car. Live in a fucked up place and I don't, stupid ass. Yeah, your shit together. Trust me. So in Vegas though, literally though, um, there have been times, I don't know the economic state right now, but I'm pretty sure it's pretty sure. It's pretty good now because it seems like a good time in the, in the country as far as the economics, people having money. When people have money, they like to buy Pussy, so, oh, perfect. So that you're telling me there's a lot of opportunity. Now what about my boyfriend? Do I get to bring him or do I leave him behind? Who gives a fuck? Fuck the boyfriend. I mean, who? I mean, who cares? I don't know if you had a business deal, you can look, I you, it can be like Sharon Stone and casino, you know what I mean?

Speaker 13:         02:11:56       Truck Double Life, whatever. Um, but you should just, the math is easy. You make about five grand a week, you know? Wow. That's really good. But then when do you drink it? On average? You should really do better than that. What do you drop it on it? But you're going to give that all to me. Yeah. What's my take? Any everything you want. What do you want? I'm on five grand. No, I'm saying what do you want? What do you want? Oh, stuff. Yeah. What do you want? I want, I want a nice house, I want a nice car. I want like health insurance. You can get my teeth fixed. You've got to hold the fuck up. The more you hold up, you don't get all that shit. Oh, I'm gonna get a quick too quick. And that's what I like. I like quick handbags. Okay, so let me, let me tell you another story.

Speaker 13:         02:12:38       Listen to a bitch. So, so you're like really skeptical about this. You're like, well I don't want to, I don't know about selling my pussy dance. Yeah. So take your Shit a strip club. Sure. Clubs are rough for like, for like rookies and he'd come back, bitches of remain to you can't get none of the special favors. That fucking haters too. They all hate me. They're putting you on the stage when no money's out there, like just all kinds of shit. And he's just like, you're like, this is bullshit. So what I would do is I would tell you to go out on a date with a friend of mine's girlfriend. Just go, just go hang with her and watch what she does. So she's going to take you to a hotel room and a guy who's already been prearranged is going to come in and pay you guys two grand just to like dance or Party and hang out with him and you might be expecting to have sex with him. He's gonna be like, Oh, I just wanted to party and it gives you two ran here. You come back to me and go, I made a fucking thousand dollars doing nothing. I love this shit. He's like, brilliant. There's a thousand scenarios that, and then, and then there's the other side to where you're coming from a really fucked up situation. Yeah, the fucked up life, like piece of shit. People are doing bad things. Even in the house you live in, you fucking hate your life and you like just quickly go black pimp, take me away. Take me away.

Speaker 13:         02:14:05       I love this dope white pimps too are they're really dope white pimps. Yeah. I mean it's, it's logic bros, like logic. I'm, I do the shit and musically entertainment. I find the humor in it. I make it educational. But also if it's fun, yeah. I'm not giving you the dark side of this shit gift of the Gab, like the spitting game of it, all. Everything, all that. Yeah. May of you. If you're a really talented pimp, you, you don't even ever have to touch her. Yeah. Literally I'm told it's all in here. Okay. Let's say there's a gentlemen, a lot of money. He wants to do something like he made me, he wants to, he and his friend wanted a double anal with me. I'm not sure I'm ready for that. How do you talk me into doing the double anal? Uh, you would have a barter system going on there.

Speaker 13:         02:14:54       Okay. And you'd call up another hole that might not even be your pimps. Other hoe. You might be like, bitch, I got a job for you. And then she's going to throw you a job trade trader out. Like I'll be like, dude, you take this double anal and I'll take your pill or just throw me a favor later because they should definitely going to give her a whole bunch of money for that. So there's a lot of money. He's going to get a lot of money for a double anal. What's that worth? She better get about 2,500 per guy, whatever this whole thing, 25 that was very humiliating. So that's very, that's probably a lot of, it's not going to be good. It's going to hurt black pimp take me away.

Speaker 13:         02:15:37       I swear. I believe you. Wait, so what's your percentage? Oh of it or all of it? 100 and then you get, the more you work you do, you get spoiled. Yeah. So you just, so you just had you decide like how much of that I deserve per customer. Like there's no fixed rate. You get no money. Oh stupid bitch. Oh you just keep me alive and like, Oh shit. And then the fucking fly ass car, he pays for the hemorrhoid cream. When I get my nails done, my hair, it gets done. That's all you do is work. And you'd call it up and you sit around and ball out and you, and how much do I have to work like every night or do I get a night off days too. What's my schedule? And that's funny too because it's, and then this, this, this is just from knowing their life.

Speaker 13:         02:16:28       Like literally you might have a guy who's like, you know, go hit it like, like four or five nights a week. And the girl would be like, I feel like I can get more. And she'll be hitting that bank seven nights a week on an on about choice. And that's like there's over overachievers, they're in every walk of life. This, that is the best way to become a pimp is to actually find yourself with a real hole. Like before it, before you, even when you're a rookie pimp, you get a a veteran, huh? Oh, right now. Okay, so she kind of teaches you, it teaches you how to be a pimp and then, um, and then um, just get your feet wet and then shit, probably like bring you a couple of a real hole can make a pimp. She could like pick you. Like you look like you could be a pimp.

Speaker 13:         02:17:17       You kinda got squashed. Do this, dress like that, drive like that. When you walk in the room, act like that. Then she'd go get him to other holes and say I've got the greatest people in the world. Be with him. Next thing you know you went from nobody to walking around with three holes and they bring in you how much? 20 nothing. 15,000 a week knowing I'm sorry, that was my take. Sorry I forget you get nothing. Any spare cash. Don't know yet. Like some spare cash like cause how do I get out of Hawaii? Like here's the deal man. Once I'm in the hallway, okay, let's say I go with you. I want to eventually I'm going to age out of that shit. I'm sneaky. Whole Zoo. Yeah. Tell me what a sneaky Hode as Nicky House make 1500 a night and come home with a thousand.

Speaker 13:         02:17:57       Oh she dare to not give you all the cash. Yeah, but she's sneaky as hell is good. Their wigs pool, dines aside, I wouldn't want to be dishonest. Caught him escape plan. That's how you do it though. You Skim a little off the top cause you look at your guy, he might be like flamboyant and he's buying you a BMW and buying him a Rolls Royce. You're like, my beamer was nice but look what he did. And he's the Big Boston, you know they get, they get mad a lot too. He was getting mad of course, cause they figure it out eventually. Like Whoa, what the fuck man? Like in my case I party a lot so I get a random phone call and we were like noise in the background and then I'm like, hello. It's like, oh you fucking party and I'm out here. I just ran from the fucking police and you're partying right.

Speaker 13:         02:18:45       So you just get like the whole blues. That's why I'm in not that whole blood. That's why I'm not a pimp. I said that's the main reason why I'm not a of those phone calls because of the fucking psycho therapy. The just the therapist part. I don't like that part. Therapizing the house that you got, you have to be, you have to be all that shit. You got to be a fucking father. Oh fucking boss or fucking accountant. Her motherfucking psychiatrist. Oh yeah. And much bullshit. You know the, just the whole venting and all this shit. Talk Bob like talks, talks. You don't want to hear that, Kevin, you were throw that thing around. Hoes don't appreciate they depreciate so, oh sure. There's really no escape plan. There's no four

Speaker 17:         02:19:28       o one k. What about his porn star relationships? You have points or relationships? I've had many dated porn stars. Oh yeah. This is something that shortcuts on the about all the time. He's like, you're not supposed to like wife these girls up. Wham Bam. Thank you ma'am. Relationships as Sam triply would say, shout out to Sam. I'm just, the guy looks broken toys. I like the place. He doesn't monetize the relationship. He does. Yeah. Come on. Yeah, I'm Jewish. I mean wait, so tell me how though it's get up and go to work. Go to work. You do. All right. Well, you know, you're one of these guys who had zero though. Insecurity about her doing her blow. Bang. Never. Well, I never did blow bags, so my last girl was a web cam model. Okay. That doesn't sound, they always have the web camera and with their house.

Speaker 17:         02:20:15       So, you know, people would come over my house and there'd be girls sitting on balloons in the other room doing all kinds of niches and kind of looks like this room. Right. And everybody's like, I'm trying to watch a basketball game and literally girls are like fingering each other in the other room and sitting on balloons and pop and blue. They're like, dude, you've got like five hot chicks and the other room like why aren't we in here? Why aren't you watching the game? Yeah. I might because their work, their work and let them work. Damn. You know, she needs to buy some stuff and I don't want to, I'm on paying for her hair. It's 300 bucks for the fucking hair. Fascinated by this was this was you, you brokered sex tapes, right? Yes. And some big ones. The biggest ones? The biggest one of all time.

Speaker 17:         02:20:53       Was that, wait, was that before you dated girls in this industry or, I was dating a bunch of girls and, and um, in fact when I first met short and like in 99, I was kicking it with this porn star name Houston. I remember it was a friend of mine and she did the Houston six 20. She, yeah, she fucked 20 guys on one day. Well six 21, six 22 would have made her a whore. That's the way I looked at the way before. I forget it was, it, was it a marketing ploy? I remember being sad when getting it came out. And you're like, this is the last APP. I was like, he's going to retire. Yeah. Is that marketing cause it's brilliant. Yeah. It was just all, it was all numbers. There was our marketing scheme for that album was the, um, the retirement.

Speaker 17:         02:21:33       Yeah. Uh, what was it with all of the media and stuff, the announcement and then the party and shit. And so you're like, oh, this is it. And there was like, Oh shit, this is what, at that time I had a, that was my 10th album I remember. And it is unheard of in hip hop. Like nobody had 10 hours. Now you have 73 albums. Not about 2020. I don't know. She's crying. He's got a new album out right now called the pimp tape, which is awesome. Awesome album. It's also very educational. It's like a reeducation. All right, let me get that shit for sure. Short threatened to, to, to be tired like four different times. And then he also threatened to get married when he did marry married. He didn't marry to the game album I got married on hypothetically can look it up right now. You only Internet. Yeah. Google married to the game and it makes a lot of sense. Shorts, the shorts. A player for life too short. Married to the game. Question. What's the most common thing men uh,

Speaker 18:         02:22:26       buy when they buy a prostitute? What's the, what's the thing you sell the most? BJ's straight. I think you'd have to ask her how. I never, I never asked a whole what did you do to late? They don't tell you. I don't want to know. Yeah, that's true. I really don't. Fair enough. Wedding picture right there. Yep. Yep. I never seen that one over there. Go Up to the right with the two brides by themselves. Go there. That was a great wedding night. Oh boy. What's the most women you've had at once? Uh, four. Four at the same time. Yeah. Yeah. I never was into that thing where you like bang a chick then like wash up and go bang another chair. I never was into that shit like four at once. I was never into that cause I like, I like the indulge. Yeah.

Speaker 18:         02:23:24       So if I'm indulging, it must be something I'm really into. I don't, I don't want that bang, get the fuck out. And then looking around like I'm not, I'm not a pervert like that. But the night that I had the four chicks, it was like, I think they were all like rolling super role and they were all feeling good and shit. And, and uh, we were in a hotel room and I was messing with one girl and she told the other girl it was good. What can I try it? Yeah, it was good. Then they like pass me around. It pass you around. I thought that I was doing it to them until I thought back on it years later. And I was like fuck to me. Yeah. They, they ran a train on me. They did poor man. But you know, shower with the water coming down.

Speaker 18:         02:24:05       Yes. Feel so used. They argued over the last kingdom too. I remember that Shit. I argued over the last one. Who was going to get that last bag? Man. Do I have the same story to tell you? So those looks so in some ways [inaudible] stories. We all have old whole story, right? We all only holding the room, you know, I've got some old host. Here's the nastiest of all them. I was pretty nasty. Oh, stop. You're married Ryan. Yeah. Yeah. That's the best. Yeah. So you've got to try to gift trader old whole stories. So we have, yeah, but he's Nastier than me. Should I remember you were telling is no standard that Puerto Rican, I did love Puerto Rican. Jesus cause you went like this. How about the, how do you get settled nurse sex tape and then become like, alright, I can handle getting this out there. How do you get the first one? That's what I'm saying. Yeah, that's a good story. So, um, I had some friends that weren't allowed to really be in the Internet business or telecom business based upon some activity. Just say they were wanted by some people. They called

Speaker 17:         02:25:24       me up one day and said, hey, we got this tape of the social ladder name's Paris Hilton and um, we really want to put it out just like our friend Seth did with the Pam and Tommy Lee tape. So I knew all these guys from back in the day and I knew what kind of a debacle that became to Pam and Tommy leaving. And that was a scandal from the start. It was like a scam. It was never stolen and lost it just, well no, it was stolen. It was that 100% was stolen out of their house. It was stolen, make money of it. They never made a dime. Okay. So that was the standard of what not to do. That was the standard of what not to do. So some friends of mine in Seattle who had learned through that said, we know what to do with this, but we can't put our names on this and, and we want you to go out there and publicize this thing for us.

Speaker 17:         02:26:07       And I'm like, well, what's the worst thing that could happen? I'm a PR guy in the, in the porn business and a, this tape is interesting. And I met with the guy who had the tape. He was a roommate of this guy in the brick Solomon, who's now known as Rick of the Dick. That's Rick in the, in the Paris team, or as we call them, the 50% copyright owner of the tape. So rare in a time Rick was banging a bunch of Hollywood was Shannon Doherty, uh, all sorts of like Hollywood people. He was the guy who was on the inside of all of this. Can I ask you before you go further? Did they make that with this intent or was it made for fun? Another good question. So rigidly the lighting was pretty good. It wasn't worth the original tape was a green x ray vision tape, if you remember correctly, when her eyes are kind of glowing in the dark.

Speaker 17:         02:26:49       That was the tape that came to us originally and was not supposed to ever see the light of day because we didn't have the rights to put it out. Paris had not signed off on it. Rick in that signed off on it and all we got was a bullshit story from Rick's roommate who said he's got the rights, he's going to do it for rec. So we gave this guy $50,000 upfront and Pam and the third of the back end profits was our deal until I went and sent two clips out to the media, one to us weekly. And when the entertainment tonight hell broke loose, this is what became known as the very first viral video because that got sent to editors who sent it to their friends who sent it to other people who made up the title. That was a dump side and one night in Paris.

Speaker 17:         02:27:28       I wish I could take credit for it. I was like, I wish I could take credit for it. But Rick Solomon actually came up with it with David Joseph, the owner of a red light district video. So we had the original tape. I got sued for $10 million. Did Paris consent to it being sold at the time? At that time? No. In fact, and nobody actually knows this and I'm going to tell you guys the story because this is what we do. Yes. Collusive. So, um, everybody was suing everybody and people were going online trying to find this tape. And there were literally $100 million being made fraudulent by people saying that they had the Paris Hilton sex tape and their members area back then you could join for $200 and see it and they'd get in there and there was nothing there. But everybody was using the rights of publicity, which means that, you know, too short is the only person in the entertainment business that could use the name too short.

Speaker 17:         02:28:20       That's his right of Tom Segura. You're the only person who could use the name Tom Guerra. So using Paris Hilton or rex almonds name, you'd be infringing on their, on their mark. And a lot of people were doing that. So at one point when they were, everybody was suing everybody, Rick and Paris had a conversation and they're like, look, everybody's making money on this thing. We should go back and make our own tape and put it out there. And if you notice, it's a very well lit. So they go back and like this time we're shooting, they go to the four seasons in Beverly Hills. Wow. And they shoot it and she gets final cut. Cause you'll, you'll notice in that movie there's really no nasty cum shots. There's no up close shots of her vagina or her ass. She did a cum shot in and the other one, well there's a cum shot in it, but it's not like there's a full facial.

Speaker 17:         02:29:07       Yeah, very boring. But she did make the Dick, I know she did. She made, she worked. I should I should I put it in work. I'm sure the four seasons loves, this is funny. As I told this to Harvey 11 years ago and Harvey Levin put it on the TMZ bus tour. So originally when it was going up and down to the tail, when they go back, yeah, we shoot it. She has final cut. Right. And then they give it to you and they're like, here it is. They gave it to us, uh, along with my brother who had now gotten involved with this, with a, with a web company up in San Francisco. And we put up a hotel, arris.com which was the only legal place to put it out online. And of course we, um, how do you monetize it though? People would join for 29 95 a month.

Speaker 17:         02:29:48       Okay. And they were buying DVDs back then, you know, now it's just kind of pre Kardashians. This is pre Kardashians. This is pre porn hub. This is pre like nobody paying for porn. It was a big, it was a big window. It's sold more DVDs than any other adult movie in the history of adult movie. Wow. And it was a huge website for many years and in fact it's still makes money all these years later still makes money. Not a lot of money, but I mean if you go to porn hub people, you know, you could see the Paris Hilton clip for free, but now it's monetized by the traffic and the advertising on there. Wow. So yeah, that kind of, so you can still make money from traffic on a, like a porn site, like a free tube site. Yo. Yeah. Really? People make money because you're, you're buying clicks and you're actually, you're monetizing it like, you know, years ago in a niche website and it's being like midgets, let's say, uh, one in like 50 people looking for little people online would buy and convert.

Speaker 17:         02:30:38       So that was good traffic. I heterosexual site, maybe one and 200 back in the day. Now because there's so many hits on porn, have you got to like one in maybe like 50,000? Well, Joel actually join. Okay. If they're still convergence, it's still converted to convert. And the more specific you get in, the more niche oriented you get, the better off celebrities stacks. They've always been the number one driver on search engines. Just the mere mention that there's a sex tape out there of a celebrity. People go and Google the gun yet with Eco Bananas looking for that sex tape. So how, I've heard stories by the way, um, that, that the Kardashians sex tape was like very orchestrated. Like as an idea

Speaker 18:         02:31:20       from the start, like this is what we'll get

Speaker 17:         02:31:22       me to the next level. At first. Kim Kardashians, as you know, is a really good friend of Paris. And she saw the phenomena happen, the Paris, and she said, I want to be big and famous too. I don't want to just be some hanger on. I'm going to put out my tape and I'm going to leak it for free. And that's when ray Jay came to me and a friend of mine and we had a meeting with him and he was like, look, you know she's wants to put this thing out there for free. I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no. You guys could make lots of money with this. And he's like, well let's do this. And I said, well, let me take you over to a couple of places. So initially I wanted to bring him over to a red light, which is where we did the one night in Paris. And then I wanted to take him the vivid, he kind of sidestep me. He went to go see Joe Francis over at girls gone wild who was best friends with vivid. They kinda cut me out of the whole thing. But again, I'm okay. I ain't mad at it. You know, we all, I'm still making money off sex tapes all these years later cause people still come to me with sex tapes. Wow. Then you know, put them out now. Now I make sure they go away.

Speaker 18:         02:32:18       People if you're a decent is more money and making them go away. Well it depends on the circumstance and if you're a copyright holder, you know, obviously if I steal your [inaudible] sex tape to go when you're just going to talk about, so what do you think? Making one so like I'm not talking about one of the old ones. I wish there was, there's no Puerto Rican dare got doubled. [inaudible] you guys can see it and I'd love to see that.

Our radio show tonight that Arizona is the most after they described it though I recognize it from Japanese porn as soon as some jet shit. I love that stuff. They love it. It's a form of Japanese and these points should be, I work criminal. I worked for the comic one time from Oakland who uh, you know, I brought you up just like, you know, we talked about music and he was like, Oh yeah, I hang out with short doc sometimes. I was like, really? And then I asked him like, what's that leg? He's like, I mean, if you'd hang around with them long enough, you'll get your dick sucked. That sounds cool. That's a true story that I can vouch for

Speaker 17:         02:33:59       more shorthand. Hung out with us more. He got his dick sucked. Oh, that's great. Yeah, I met short. We booked him for a player's ball. That was the name of our porn party was telling you about it. Yeah. And we had done it. There's a place called the state palace theater in New Orleans and we have told the story a million times on our show, but it was the weekend, the Bayou classic, which is basically to black colleges playing each other. Uh, southern Mississippi and I was at Grambling. Yeah. So, um, needless to say, New Orleans [inaudible] oh, that's a high school, right? Yeah, I think so. All right. But needless to say, New Orleans was very dark that weekend. He was sent out to go play a party for two black black brothers is what he thought. My brother and I are the black brothers. B, l a t, t, O kb and d money k Bezel and d money.

Speaker 17:         02:34:44       That was our nom de guerre. Anyway, he shows up at the state palace theater and people are having sex on the dance floor and there's a VIP rooms. It was blow jobs going on. He comes back and he looks at two white boys dressed as pimps and I'm suited and booted with like a biggie smalls hat. I brothers in a red goes, what is going on? And I came in. We're so happy to have you here tonight. You, I'm such a big fan of yours cause just like you, I grew up listening to two short course and Cleveland I was bumping too short from 1984 on. Yeah. So um, yeah, he's like a, all I know is I'm supposed to be planned for two black brothers like no with a black brothers, you know the black brothers and he's like, I thought you guys were black. And I'm like why don't we kind of are us us along with Lego. And he looked at me cause like I don't care man. I don't care what you guys do and what's going on, how can I be down? Because there is people butt ass naked out there. Penn House, pets, porn stars. Yeah. So that was my initial kickoff. It was a great kickoff because we got to what got him to play with kid Capri and a slick Rick that night and it was all my hip hop idle.

Speaker 13:         02:35:49       That's awesome man. Back then I wasn't really like participating in any like AVN awards and none of that shit. And then you hear these guys come along and they're like at the backstage passes to the AVN awards. Yeah.

Speaker 17:         02:36:02       We're like, sure, we want to book you at the Playboy Mansion for a party. He's like, I'm down. You know, we had some good times, so that's how we became friends. I'm happy to say 20 years later and I host a show with, with two shorts.

Speaker 13:         02:36:15       It's crazy. All the kb one nine these chicks are like porn chicks. I like, I wish I could just fuck a regular guy right now. I'm like, man, let me out the car. I think you went in, right?

Speaker 17:         02:36:28       I maybe a little, we had male challenge. It didn't show up that night and I'm cheap, so I'm like, oh, hey, you know what? Your wish is my command. Are you in porns? No, no. Well, not as far as you guys would.

Speaker 13:         02:36:42       Okay. That means his dingalings been thrown around and there's a thing called Pov. Yeah, there's no pressure. You don't feel the pressure. Maybe now more because I'm 50. I don't know if I would do it now, but back then I was kind of out of my mind. I had a good time back then. Short. I want to ask you a question. So I realized this like when we, when they, when you said you're coming on, I was so excited. And then I had, I remembered that a while ago, like maybe over a year ago I was on my boy Hannibal Burress as podcasts handles great comic Dj Tony Trimm.

Speaker 6:          02:37:16       Yeah. Randomly, I forget how we got into it, but we brought up, um, blow the whistle, the song and I realized that in my memory I was like, oh, I broke down. What that song's about. Like I was a professor teaching them and then I realized that you were about to come here. I was like, I don't really, I don't know if I got it right. I just decided that so can, can we show it to you and you tell me if I was accurate or not. That's go.

Speaker 3:          02:37:43       I liked, by the way, did you ever like really explore and at the time I did and I'll just be honest, the concept of blow the whistle, it's actually pretty deep concept in and of itself that he's a referee calling a personal foul on you taking his expression of that word. Right. Like that's pretty, I didn't even catch it. That's what, what the song was about. So the song, yeah, blow the whistle is that he's a ref basically blowing the whistle. You're saying biatch the way he said it, you're stealing from him, man. He's coming from the perspective of the referee. He is playing a character whistle. So he like, he married is like that Dave Chappelle. I'm proud of you man. But like you're saying bitch, like I say it and so are all these other bloating. Yeah. That's a good way to call somebody out. It is, man. I got to fuck fucking up blow whistle. That's pretty cool. Actually. He doesn't get credit for that because it's always getting his dick sucked.

Speaker 13:         02:38:37       How'd I do? Uh, you were on it Kinda. Huh? But, um, it goes a little bit further than that. Okay. Because I'm, once again, if you just listen to the words, it's actually I'm the ref and I'm blowing the whistle on people who are doing things they shouldn't be doing that. It's not really the word bitch in the song. It talks about doing too much drugs, partying too much, staying up for days, just doing shit that you shouldn't be doing. And it's like, you know, it talks about falling down hill and just, you know, just if you can't hang with the big dogs, stay on the point. You can't do this shit. So cause you keep fucking up. So it kind of goes in life in general. If you see somebody fucking, I've just blown, you know those west, so hey man, oh the flag on them, you know, and whatever the fuck I was almost there you were, you were going up there. I was like, is he gonna get it? Some little kids told me it means suck my Dick. Really? I didn't, that wasn't my meaning, but it was like, yeah, I'm like suck my Dick.

Speaker 13:         02:39:41       I'm just saying, all right. All right. Well cool man. I'm glad to know that I almost got it right. I had no idea. I just was, I was owning the word bitch. It was started, it was starting to be an argument out there of where it came from. And Ryan overheard that argument one day and somebody was saying, not too sure I made this shit. Get the fuck out of here. That shit go. And they were logically putting it all over the world and shit. And I'm like, Nah, I gotta I gotta own this. Yeah. Cause you definitely, so it's, it's cemented now.

Speaker 18:         02:40:14       There's no debuke no dispute, no debate. It is solid, too short said made it. That's it. And I um, you got to give a little credit to Rudy ray Moore. Yup. Cause I can take the old light to some of his songs when he's in Dulla my character. Yeah. And he's talking in the movies and on some of his records and he goes bit. Yeah. And he doesn't, I'm like me and my wrap part in, back in the day, we didn't get it from him per se. Yeah. But he was one of our influences, so sure. You know, indirectly that's the, that's where it ended up. So He's getting a little credit too. Okay, thank you. You're the one that's really, yeah, that's, yeah, and then you know snoop dog, when he got with death row, he does demand, they adopted it and they kind of, I give snoop the credit for making it go so pop, but I gave it to so many millions of people and then he was one of the ones who got it ingrained in him and he passed it on to so many more million.

Speaker 18:         02:41:11       And then everybody, I've seen comedians Duff's in old TV show. It is embedded in pop culture. I'm counting people go, you should copy writing. Oh. And I'm like, no. Do you have the button with you as soon a trunk of a car that's in the trunk? Hopefully. Yeah. Shorts. Now marketing these buttons, the bitch buttons you could find on the short store.com oh yeah.

Ask you something. You don't think, if you could find a nice lady who took care of you, cook for you to, he could wifi up like, would you ever wife a lady up?

Speaker 13:         02:44:30       I've been in relationships not devoid of relationship. What? When's the last time you had one? Um, I'm always the one

Speaker 18:         02:44:39       really. I mean like a serious, like seriously. They're all serious.

Speaker 13:         02:44:46       Oh my God. Why is there no real love and your future in my past, present and future there is what I'm telling you. You can't not a fucking superhero. You gotta you gotta have it. You've got to have love of course.

Speaker 18:         02:44:59       But I mean, is there a mrs too short

Speaker 13:         02:45:02       in the future desk? Put it like this. The w the women, women in my life understand what I do for a living and you know, it's the, don't let the music persona distort the reality. Okay. It was a hard on there. All right. I know. I want to see him when they got to do on Christmas. I don't know. Just fuck all a Santa has reindeer isn't shit. No, he stopped being a player right around them. Right when it gets cold.

Speaker 18:         02:45:32       Yeah. And then you start back up like right around now. Right, right. Yeah, that's true. I think my dad did the same shit. That's when he would bring some girl around and like here's your new mom. And I'm like, yeah, I know. Oh he would have been a good pimp and then come spring no more mom. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No. Yeah, totally. Dude. He could teach a seminar numbers. He's got numbers cause he gets a bitches used to clean his house forum and do all kinds of stuff. Pretty solid. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         02:46:01       Really knew how to mute. There's a lot of ways to go wrong with the shit too. Like I know a guy who I am, I know a guy who was fascinated by the look of it and just the idea of it. So he went to an older pimp and he said teach me the game. And the outer pimp was like flattered. He was like, cause he know the guy had to look, you know he, yeah, he was playing the part but he wasn't, it wasn't really any, yeah. So the Oda [inaudible], he's like, well this is what you gotta do any like really schooled him for like a long time, like two fucking years or some shit. And this guy figured it out, but he did one thing wrong. The first how he ever had was his girlfriend. Oh. And they had been together and they were like taking in, absorbing all these pimp talking shit.

Speaker 13:         02:46:49       And they're like, yeah, we got to do this. So what happens is she started working, she liked it. She liked how he as some point was like, you know, realizing the dark side and and realizing really inside him that he wasn't about that. Now he loves his woman. He loved her before they started this. And he's like, in his mind trying to get her to take a turn with him, like, let's do something different. She's like, fuck, noticed the money. It's that shit. So she literally got to the point where she was like, will you go if the crushing it crushing, yeah, he went from, from good kid to pimp to like church boy. Wow. He went straight to the church. I get there. It does it t you could, you could and you could get ended up in situations where you saw called controlling these women and things happen to them and that, that guilt, you can never get over that shit. No. That's when you go straight to the church. Hey, you go out there and say, I got away. I get that money and that baby, she never comes back everyone life ever again. Like whoops. Yeah. And his father is that, but luckily white pimp

Speaker 6:          02:48:02       hoes out there. So I be like, she's dead anyway. Now let me ask you this because you are of too short too is you can sing two shirts. I don't see a woman. Yeah. And then kind of it, but kind of know. Yeah. Maybe I'll singing this song. Suck my fucking, yeah. You think I haven't heard some of that shit. Come on man. What is, what is okay? You've been, you've been okay

Speaker 13:         02:48:29       this long, all this success. What's the dumbest Shit you've ever bought? Oh, I love this question. That's a great question. I'm dying to know this to myself. Yeah. Um, I think, um, I had a one time, the first time I ever negotiated for a big check, I remember, uh, the check arriving and it was a, it was going to come in increments, like four checks to a total of about like 2 million. All right. So I figured they were going to come quick to, cause it was like, we don't want to give you all this money in one day. We'll give it to you over like 90 days or some shit like that. So the first one came and logically knowing that there are more coming, I'm like, I'm fucking this one up. Yeah. So literally I just, it's just dumb. Should I could ever think of it started, it was probably like 97 and it started, um, like in one week, I think I bought like 150,000 on a car, about a fucking hundred thousand dollar boat.

Speaker 13:         02:49:38       Went by two fucking jet skis with a truck to pull him whoa. And a truck for the boat. Yeah. And fucking I'm, it was just like, it was a spending spree of, of, you know what? This was the logic. You know what? I've been making this money and living his life, doing all this good shit. This one time I'm just going to fuck it all off. I didn't do it a lot in life, but that one time I fucked it off. And about two years later I went on a good roll too cause I was like, oh that new beamers out. Oh I don't know shit. They made the special edition. Oh, so about two years. I was like, I thought I was like this baller dude who knee and hip hop was kind of preaching that shit at the time. That was just the bad boy videos and the bling bling air and everybody was like platinum jury and diamonds and all this shit.

Speaker 13:         02:50:23       And people were spending $1 million on videos and shit. It was, yeah, it was just out of hand and out of control and hip hop. So I woke up, um, it was 1999 and all the talk was y two k y two k the possibly shit could happen. The computers aren't going to reset. They're gonna reset when they're not supposed to lie. The stupid y two k right, right. Yeah. Well it's going to end that night. 1999 in 2000 comes in like half a bottle of water, have everything ready to go. So it was 1999 the world was about to end and I looked out in my driveway one morning I woke up, I had a big ass fucking house with like a driveway that you could, it was like a three car garage, but the driveway can hold like another 15 cars and walk outside my house.

Speaker 13:         02:51:08       There's three cars in the garage and he's like eight cars in the driveway and they're all mine. I'm like, I'm like, I spent everyday taking one of these fucking cars to the shop to get the stereo fixed to the rim. It's rims fucking rotated or the guy does this. It was just so much shit at, it was that moment. That little two year period I just realized you stupid motherfucker like you really ended up with eight cars. I just one driver. Yeah. And I've never done that shit. Aye. It was like a fire. So I even um, at that point something really great happened cause it was this whole end of the world, Shit, I am 2000 kicked in the world didn't end and I was like, damn, you got to do something spectacular. So I told like a bunch of my closest personal friends.

Speaker 13:         02:51:54       I was like everything fucked up. Last year I fucking lost every fucking dime I had. I think I'm about to lose my fucking house. I'm fucked. I'm fucked. Because I used to be the guy who would always take everybody to, but everything's, I mean we go out and just everything and make sure it might make money. I just wanted to, I was, it was an experiment. I was only going to do it for like six months or something and I just like I just told everybody for a lot. I, I was in the house organizing music files and doing some personal, you know, Shit. I had all this music, all these files, all his shit. I think MP three s were new. I was converted all my shit. The MP three and I just really liked was, I thought the world was going end, so I really, I was like, I got a little free time on my hand, the world.

Speaker 13:         02:52:35       And then so I played this trick and guess what? Probably about like 95% of my friends just quit calling. Really? Yeah. It was like be in this industry. You kind of know that you have acquaintances and you had friends and I still have the same friends I had since fucking high school. So that just tells you you this shit. But I just wanted to see people when people say Shit like this, you give a guy, I'm a $25,000 check for some shit. He didn't music. He's the guy who never had money like that 25,000 you already bro. He goes, man, I fucking love you. I will fucking, anything you need. I was killed somebody for you and I, that was always my like red flag and somebody says, go kill something. I'm like, no, that's not what the check is for it. But, but um, as soon as that money's gone, I was like, they're like, yeah, like you got 25 more. He like, Nah, they was the only earning 25. Like, well fuck you then man. Yeah. It's just, it's just funny like that. So yeah. So um, yeah, that was, it was an eye opener. I've never had eight cars at the same time since then. I don't take on a lot of fucking close circle personal friends and you know, yeah. Smart. You're in the circle k mart. I'm in the circle. Yeah. I'm very fortunate. He has not be traded my field yet. Not yet.

Speaker 13:         02:53:57       And how did you guys, oh, so how'd you hook up to like where did the idea to come to do the radio show?

Speaker 17:         02:54:02       Well, I was um, another good question. Ah, rolling stones doing a feature on me that's supposedly coming out next month. It's all about the me too. It's all about fixing. A long time ago, man. We did. We can, we talked to her like what, eight months ago? So it's been taken a little while, but it's finally coming out. Uh, I brought Amanda the writer down to meet short downtown cause I thought I'd give her a little cross section of some of the people I deal with. You know, I fucks with a lot of people. So she was so blown away by two short and she was like, this is great. What nice guys. What a great facility. Shorts. Got a place downtown called the boombox. It's about a 30,000 square foot facility and every really, really rough 15th. That was crazy. 15. I'm sorry. This is like, just where you work.

Speaker 17:         02:54:47       It says my thing. It's my thing. It's this compound he's got, he's got a giant studio downtown. Yes. That's painted like a boombox. And the uh, the middle where the cassette would be is the actual window into the studio, but he's got different rooms. Got a barbershop in there. He's got him. And there's, there's recording equipment in every room. So if you're inspired, you know he's got artists down there that are working in every single room. That's the factory hit factory. So anyway, I brought down the writers, she loved it and she started saying something about a podcast and shorts, like, you know, we should really do a podcast together again because we did one last year, a couple of years ago when he did it and it was really a fun time. He had snoop and ice cube and Chanel west coast and a bunch of cute bash. You were on the Chanel show.

Speaker 17:         02:55:31       Yeah, that was, that was, that was an, that was kind of like the green light for me was that we had big, big, big names on the show. Russell Simmons and I mean it just, the list went on and on. Actors sports player and the Chanel and kb shell, Chanel west coast from ridiculousness. Yeah, that was the highest rated show. Yeah. So I ended up being on the highest rated show, but it was, I enjoy this because he's says shit like, what the fuck did you say on that show? Who knows? Probably told about just sex stuff. Yeah. You say shit. He's like, he's like, um, we just having a normal conversation like this and then kb goes, yeah. Like when Kim Kardashian got peed on the original tape, she was getting paid on. What's your really, Rachel was every in honor. Ray J denied and Kj denies it.

Speaker 17:         02:56:21       But I know what I saw while we were just talking about Chuck Berry's video today. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, he does. Before Kelly farts, like as she's blonde, he's like, he's like did our far and she's like, yeah. He's like, yes, sometimes I do that. Maybe aren't Kelly saw that shit and you get maybe I'm like a mitten mentor kind of thing going on through possibly. Possibly. Yeah. I mean, look, there's a lot of sex tapes out there that you know about it. All right, let's talk about the sex tapes. We don't know about. Kb is a, he's a cold brother, you know, he does what's up. He's like, look at this shit. And he shows me his phone. I show him painting, all kind of people you know, doing, Ugh, why sex? I mean, years ago I showed short a video clip of Justin Bieber singing a song with the n word in it and I got out that guy, he had purchased it five different times and spent hundreds of thousands to make it go away.

Speaker 17:         02:57:24       When he was 16 he finally had to just fess and I showed it to shorten shirts like that career is done and we all thought he'd be done someone's lyrics or was this his own? He had a song called one less lonely girl and he was like one less lonely inwards. One lesson he wrote it. He was just like trying to get a reaction out of his white friends and they're all laughing along with them, but it was not nice. And granted he was a kid are back to the sex tapes back to the sex tapes for. So uh, no, no. I'll tell us why. I've signed a lot of NDA so I can't talk about some of them. Yeah. But I will say that the Tom Sizemore tape, which did come out eventually, it was probably one of the most disturbing tapes I've ever seen. Movies or something.

Speaker 17:         02:58:12       Say selling. So somebody from this movie and somebody from that movie, Tom Sizemore had the priapus zoom, which is when you have a hard on for longer than four hours, that's what they warn you against, like blink once or twice. Um, that was a bad way, I would say. Uh, okay. So I'm, but why was it a bad one? Tom Size? But it was bad because he was high on crystal meth and he had five hookers in the Chateau Marmont and he's talking to the camera and he's just glazed and you're like, well, I feel bad for this guy. Yeah, no, it didn't link up it, it actually came out commercially vivid, put it out for a little while. It wasn't five hookers. Yes, Jesus man. I had the Collin Farrel sex tape as well, which was a really interesting tape. That really, yeah, with Nicole and rain, she was one of the, a seven black playmates and the history of playboy.

Speaker 17:         02:59:04       But when I first saw it, I was actually a friend Nicole. Me, she's cool. Uh, I was actually taken in the trunk of a car because these guys didn't have wide in the back. So you were on the trunk of a car before? Yeah. This guy's calling me up. They're like, Yo, you're hands free. Yeah, but I was just going up sunset plaza because they didn't have room in their Honda to get me up there. But I was such a horror. One guy kidnapped in a Honda from Mel's drive ever kidnap me, kidnap me and something better. Nice man. Better be a chord like 2019 and core trunk space, man, they um, they put me up to this house. I got a little string in there. You can let yourself up. I wasn't really worried cause they wanted one point $2 million for the sex tape and they knew I was the only guy that was going to be able to get it for him.

Speaker 17:         02:59:45       So when I actually went into this house, it just kind of back like then like sorta like relaxed. Like when I got in the House I was like this for a second. I mean the Trump was even shot. Did you call your brother? No, I called him right after this all happened by the ride. Just got to trunk, trunk right now. I drove up from San Diego. I was living in Carlsbad trunk. Yeah. Great. Great. Two short songs by the way. Yeah, in the trunk feature in blessed cancer featured in the opening scene was like big deal. Big Deal. Big check in the trunk is cracked. So yeah, I was going to try some frilliest kidnappers. Yeah, for real. I ended up going into this, uh, Manchin and they put the VHS tape in and there's Colin Farrell, it really a kid. And I said get in the trunk cause we don't have room for you.

Speaker 17:         03:00:32       They said we weren't really planning on showing it to you and we don't have room in the backseat of our car, but we don't want you following us up in your car. So when will you agree to get blindfold them and put in the trunk of the car? I left out the blind fold is a Bandana. So, uh, you can't know where we ask. So you want me to go on where I was going. So I went up, it was literally three and a half minutes to the house. I now recognize it was sunset plaza that I was going up. Right. Windy road, cause I wasn't living in La at the time. I go in there, they put the VHS tape in and there he is, the shaved head naked with the biggest penis I've ever seen in my life for a little guy. Who's that?

Speaker 17:         03:01:06       Collin Collin. And he looks at the and goes, go, I could do this for fucking breakfast. Fucking lunch and fucking dinner. I can eat that kitty. And I'm like, and he's got a cigarette dangling from his mouth and his holy a Guinness. I'm like, if this isn't my tripod off dude, this guy, I was like, does he breathe through this thing family? Her camera was flying. She was filming it with, with her handheld camera. Okay, okay. And I'm just going, Holy Shit. This is amazing. I knew her at the time that that was a scandal. She was like, I'm about to be rich. Yeah. She really didn't get paid to work and make money from this. Now we shut it down. Um, oh he, he wanted it to be shut down. He had to pay a lot of money for it to go. Really? It didn't go to her, did not go to her because you were talking about like, you know, having rights in the copper.

Speaker 17:         03:01:51       Why does, so how does it work if like, if you're the person in it, who are you paying to make it go away? So why? So let's say, um, you're going through an airport, you guys travel a lot, you've got your laptop on one of those little things going through Tsa and you get held back or whatever and all of a sudden somebody makes off with your laptop. Okay? Somebody gets into your laptop. They tried to put out this tape. They can't put it out legally because if they're not on it, you and Christina are the only two people. Yeah. Okay. In a sex tape. She's a 50% copyright holder. Europe, 50% copyright holder. Right now, if I get ahold of your computer, I might have possession of your computer, but I don't own your computer. Right. Which makes me in possession of stolen material.

Speaker 17:         03:02:33       Right. Which is how we shut down 90% of them. If you don't have the right to publicity and you don't have the rights from at least one of the people and even one of the people's problematic because you need to have both of the people. So in this scenario though, let's say we use your scenario. Yeah. So then it's like, so Tom, you know, Kevin's got it or whatever. Um, and I don't want it to get out, right. Am I just paying you to give me my laptop bag? Or what you're doing is you're basically hiring me to go out there and that the person that has it, I'm going to find out how they got it, what their intention is with it. And 90% of the time, you know, we now live in this TMZ world where people want to go and they, they feel this is newsworthy.

Speaker 17:         03:03:12       Oh, Tom Segura, he's a huge comic. We're going to put this out as a story. He's got a sex tape being sold around the valley. Well, Thomson Guerra might have a deal with Disney coming up and you probably in the next shaggy dog and you don't need that because you're going to get $2 million picture. Pretty cool. Porn said you guys have, by the way. Thanks man. Does look very poor. Very poor. They could do some good thoughts. This neighborhood's very poorly, by the way. I could tell you stories about what goes Forney. Yeah, that's Porny. Um, but yeah, so what we'll do is you would actually me alongside with your lawyers, we would, uh, coordinate getting this stuff back to you and make sure that there's no copies. Is that money being paid going to you and the lawyers or also that guy who just so he needs a pay off? Well, they go away when you pound. Okay. You know their horse too. And later on that people who'd tried to bravely put them out, it's just a boring most, the most part, right? Nobody really made money like Paris. Yeah. I will say this. Another exclusive and why image and shit. Hold on. This is a wire may check exclusive.

Speaker 17:         03:04:25       So exactly a year ago, last week I was shocked. A woman calls me up and she's like, do you have a secure line for me to talk to? Right. Like I'm like in the cone of silence or something. I'm like, okay, yeah. It's like I get on a whatsapp call with her and I'm like, what do you have? She says, a guy sent me a tape of this model slash actress for years ago and she is tossing a salad and it's, you know, oral sex. Yes, eat the scrum. And I said, great. How do you know this guy? Well, he's a photographer, he's based in Florida. I was doing some stuff with them. Okay. And who's the person we're talking about? And she was beating around the Bush and beating around the bush. I said, who is the person we're talking about here before I call my lawyer and get anybody involved in this, you have to tell me.

Speaker 17:         03:05:10       So then she says her name is Megan and she's about to marry a prince and he get his story not true to it is true. I'm going to show you the email communications and you'll see why picture of it Brunette second and Dick from the top of her head. I'm here to tell you that I believe you believe. Is that correct? Your assumption where in my opinion I believe this is bagging and you believe she's, she's eating this again. I know what I saw is just treat and when I reached out to the lawyer and I told him, look, this is what's going on, she and the change the diaper guys, we're going to say allegedly or his legs pulled up like he's going to change his diaper and you can't see her until I seen the shit. He saw one still photo but I saw him show us the shit bro. Saying your phone. I don't have it. She's a lady. I got rid of it. Case Interpol or am I six or if you're listening it is now gone. Yeah. This is not in my phone. If anyone's listening. Kevin's got it.

Speaker 17:         03:06:15       The woman in Canada who called me, how's it? Damn. Anyway, so yeah, that's the kind of setup razor. It's gonna snitch are out there like that, but there was another time I will say this. Can I tell the story about when you told about some guy calling me? You give somebody my number, the amount of sex that you can say his name. Okay, well he's not going to see us anytime soon. He might hope that he calls me up one day. He goes, hey man, I gave your name to a friend of mine. He's got a sex tape. I'm like, oh, okay, cool. Cool. He's, he's going to be calling you. I'm at bed, bath and beyond with my ex fiance shopping for curtains. I see that number pop up. I answered the phone. Hayes's KB. Yeah. It shook. Excuse me. I'm like, I can't hear you.

Honest to God, we can't put it out legally. And I'm trying to teach shook night about the law. And he's like, well fuck that. I'm putting this thing out.
