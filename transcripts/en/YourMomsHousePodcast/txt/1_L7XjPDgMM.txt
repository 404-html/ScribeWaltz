Actually love those cool mornings. My mother used to say is crispy outside. Please be and go. I don't think it's crispy, mom. Well, you ready to do this? Oh my God, I'm so, so much to share, to share. Let's get going. Here we go and pool your jeans up.

Speaker 4:          00:05:57       You don't even do it except for

Speaker 3:          00:06:03       who is Randy.

Speaker 4:          00:06:09       Well, we'll go. We'll go to your mom's house.

Speaker 3:          00:06:16       It's here on another episode of Your Mom's house so you know what to do. Drop your genes and rob. Rob, did you just come up with it? Yeah. How long did it take you to think of that one in a second here. Really good time. Thanks. Do you think this lady is not well? You know, it's really crazy when you see somebody like her who looks like it's, she's on the edge of complete breakdown, saying come absolute nonsense to this poor truck driver that look on her face is terrifying. Sure. Uh, it's that she's driving, right? How does it drive it? Drive now they have licenses. They walk among us like normal people. I know. I think about that all the time. This show has informed my opinion of the mass is so much more. I know that people like this. I mean, God bless her. I'm not trying to, I mean, you know, I don't want to say that like, uh, it's hilarious that she's super sick. Sure.

Speaker 3:          00:07:17       But that guy just say that my mom was crazy and it provided a lot of entertainment, like we were saying before. Yeah. She'd be like, it's cold outside. It's crispy. I have a lot of crazy crap. A lot of crazy in my opinion. Yes. But what I'm saying is, but sometimes I, I, I think about how many people out there and especially on the road, oh yeah. Are really sick and like shouldn't be driving nuts. My Dad used to say it all the time. Everybody is crazy or on drugs. It's pretty accurate. Now I'm like, I think he's right. I think one of the things you'll end up telling our boys a lot. All of like the two of us yeah. Is like, you're going to navigate a world of crazy. Yeah, absolutely. Just be prepared for unreasonable people out there. That's what, there's a lot of out there.

Speaker 3:          00:08:00       I prepared her constantly. Now your, or hopefully the boys are, but like a lot of times if you're not crazy, you're expecting not or you're expecting crazy people to be able to reason with you. That's right. And that's the big mistake. That's my biggest flaw. That's, can I tell you something? It took, it took me 36 years as an adult and an end 10 years of therapy to realize that you can't reason with crazy. So that's a huge life lesson. It is a huge life lesson. There's, I'm almost 40 and that's something that I've recently come to terms with, right? That you can't rationalize with totally fucking greedy people, but you can have a good time watching them. You could have a fun podcast about them.

Speaker 3:          00:08:47       And you know, like I, like I said, I love my mother. I'm just my, I'll say it again. And for those you just tuning in. My mother was mentally ill, she a borderline personality disorders, schizophrenia. Later in life I got an ass load of crazy growing up. So, hey man, don't fucking email me and tell me how insensitive I am. Uh, making fun of this shit cause I'm entitled to do that. Okay. That's true. Now her point about truckers being not so sexed up, I don't know much about, I mean, listen, I know a lot of people who drive trucks listened to our show. God bless him. I love him. Now my understanding is truckers are the nastiest. I mean they have a nasty reputation. Say there's probably some really good wholesome truckers out there. Of course family are the, they do have a rep for getting lizard lots. Right. And, and you know, being the dirty guys, but I think if some of them are probably very decent people, most are sure. But then there's things like you hear about, we'll let you have a joke in your act about going to a certain vent in place. Video plays and there's holes in walls. That's primarily, from what I understand, like truckers. Yeah. I mean that was on a high way in Carolina and yeah, it probably,

Speaker 1:          00:10:00       yeah, it probably was, uh, uh, frequented by some truckers. Yeah. Well, I'd like to, locals were welcome. I mean they didn't have a policy. I mean she, she said some real crazy shit here to the shirt. She says a lot more, but I'll, I'll just replay it so you get an idea. Oh boy, that was weird.

Speaker 3:          00:10:21       She

Speaker 4:          00:10:21       Warner

Speaker 1:          00:10:40       she's having a like a vision right now. Yeah. Yup, Yup, Yup. Four Times. That's a, that's not a, it's not a lot, but how did she know it was for, she knows,

Speaker 4:          00:10:47       she sees that God said a truck to the side of the road.

Speaker 3:          00:11:00       Yeah. I wonder if, cause my mom too when towards the end of her life got into Jesus and the Bible. Yeah. Like I, when we went there and stuff, there was a lot of leg underlining highlighting the Bible and like she'd have these religious cards kind of stashed everywhere. I guess that seems like a pretty common, that's a lot. It happens a lot when they know it will go nutty. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:20       So it just went like, I have a like an atheist relative. Yeah. Who when he got sick and he was very much like, not into religion and everybody around because he knew it was going to die, start talking like he knew, he knew it was gonna, he was gonna die. They're like, just get back on the

Speaker 3:          00:11:39       time to start hedging the bet. And then he's like, all right. He started to pray and stuff, you know, it has been, you know, makes sense. So you may as well try, like if it's, if all that stuff's true. Yeah. I mean it'll be on the right side of it. Yeah. Makes Sense. Yeah. I mean, I, I understand why somebody who, they're like, you're about to die. Do you want to just go ahead and ask JC if he'll take, then you probably go like, yeah, all right. I should believe in Jesus. Now there was that famous writer who was, uh, an atheist who was, uh, diagnosed and you know, told he was terminal and he did, he died. No, no, no, no. He's a scientist. I'm talking about this writer, a writer who's the most famous, I can't, I'm drawing a blank on them right now.

Speaker 3:          00:12:24       And they were like, how about now that you know you're going to die? He was like, Nah, he still stayed on. He was like, go fuck yourself. Yeah. Well start respect to shit. That was Carl Sagan on his deathbed. They go, are you, do you not believe in God anymore? He's like, Nah, Bro, I'm fucking, I'm ride or die atheist all the way, homie. All the way. He did the double bird double Burt's. Yeah. I gave him the double bird. Yeah. He was like, Look Dad Shit homie. Yeah, go to prison, prison going to hell. And I respect it. I respect the shit out of being like, no, I'm not buying it. I'm not, you know, I used to buy it. I bought it as a kid and the older I get, the less I believe it. Especially since having children of my own where I'm like, there's nothing out there. It is lawless. It is a ruthless world of nature is a jungle and you just got to get, I think it's, I think the big thing about religion is that it's very comforting to people. Sure is. I, which I, you know, you can't criticize that. If it makes you feel sure it's meaning and gives you come from like I get it. But uh, yeah. Can I tell you what really made me think about, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:13:38       How there's no, God is watching that space movie with Ryan Gosling. My God. We went to see the, what's it called? It's called Ryan got us to the moon. Ryan Gosling shouldn't wear a shirt. It's called, why the fuck did they put him in a fucking astronaut outfit? That's why I go see Ryan Gosling. So as he shirtless at some point and he wasn't even shirtless, he looked like a regular guy. It was so upsetting. It's called first man, first man to shit. And on the moon. What one of the big flaws we went to see first man, by the way, I was ready to leave a few minutes in. I'm serious. Stupid. I'm serious. You looked over at me. I was, it was, no, it was like an hour in and I was like, all right, it's all set up. I get it. Let's go. I know what's going to happen is I know it's going to happen.

Speaker 3:          00:14:23       I know he's going to land on the moon is going to walk on the moon. I know. I've seen it. Boring. Boring is exactly right and I was like, find aliens that we didn't hear about before. That wouldn't be none. The MTV flag was up there. There's some, it's movies. There's, this is a big thing. Movies about things you already know about. That's tough. I know. It is tougher. Like that's fucking boring. Newspaper one we saw, oh my God, that was terrible. What's her name? The one I love, you know, she's a fan to everyone's a good heroin. Meryl Streep. That's what kept me from falling asleep is at least they had good accuracy. The Post, I think it was us. Jesus. What a boring fucking movie that was. How many awards did that piece of Shane as directed by Spielberg? Spielberg and it, you know, it hit the blueprint of movie making movie solid.

Speaker 3:          00:15:13       It's a solid movie in that it follows, here's the setup, here's the, you know, the controversy, here's the resolution. But you see every scene coming. You see every line coming. I mean, there's no surprise in that movie, which is what makes movies fucking boring. You know what the story is and we all know what happened with, uh, what's his name? Lance Armstrong. When he went to the man. Yeah, man. Lance landed there on his bike and then he gets off and he's like, so what if I cheated and he puts a flag in the moon. Everybody knows, everybody knows what, whatever. Here's the things that I find very upsetting about the movie. Ryan Gosling wears a shirt. He wears a shirt. He fucking, so they show him peeing on the spacecraft, which is cool. Finally we got to see how they learn and it's a pisses and he shuts and he's like, I pissed.

Speaker 3:          00:16:03       And then, and it was brown. He goes, oh, there's so much nitrogen in the air. And I was like, oh, that makes, that makes sense. No shitting. And it's like, okay, these guys are up in space for four days to get to them. That I could take a dump the whole time. Okay. That's upsetting. Well, I'm serious. Like I know we joke about it on the show. I know serious shit and space. They don't tell you and especially do they eat like Mras like they do in the military to kind of block you up. That's interesting. Also also, they don't show the guys jacking off at all or even talking about it like you know they're, they're thinking about, of course there's no porn. Of course. They're like, what do you need when you're up there? Obviously that'd be like a top three list. You know, if they'd probably be like, oh, we need fluids to drink the food. I want music, I want to watch some porn. I would rearrange that list. If you were going in his face first is porn, then food, then liquid. I Dunno if that's the order, but I just feel like it's very misleading. Once again, Hollywood misleads us into thinking that there's no jacking off going on in any facet of life for any type of character. There's no poop and going on ever. I mean it's like, well, two, two guys is why people are not going to the movies anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:17:22       Two guys alone in space and nobody's jerking off. I know. I don't buy it. I think they're both like, how about a jerk you off and then I'll check you off. And then they watch the come float around because there's no grass and buzz buzzes a deck. And I actually wanted to hear him talk more. It was an asshole in the movies. It's interesting. Uh, but here's my point is I saw that and I, here's the amazing part about the moon landing, which you don't think about as a kid when you hear about it. It was done in the 60s and when you think about the level of technology that existed in the 1960s we barely had toasters, refrigerators, blenders, all that shit was new. They didn't even have a, you don't have a fucking cell phone and these dudes, it's all dudes put dudes on the moon and you know how many men died to get there, which is pretty crazy part in the movie.

Speaker 3:          00:18:20       I didn't know that there. I assumed obviously, you know, there's a whole program going on for years to lead up to this. I didn't realize how many people died. No. And how people didn't like the space program because of it and tested it. A fire in one of the space craft before it even launched, like a test day signed. The three guys died before it ever even took off. Cause the fire just spoiler alert. Well it's not really its history but um, but that's when you realize stuff like yeah, there, there is no god. I mean there's no god. You see him take steps on the moon. It feels like you are doing it, which is so amazing with this movie guys. Go and see it. Uh, I just uh, when they, when they finally show him taking his first steps and you feel like your doing it the way that it's shot, it's just brilliant.

Speaker 3:          00:19:10       Brilliant. Damien Chazelle uh, Scott or Josh singer and James Hansen, the director and the writers. Here's the question everybody has for you guys. Right. Where is the company? This movie is missing a big portion of interest from us. I'm being serious though when they have to Brown. Yeah. Cause it was there like a flap in the back, like old timey pajamas, you know like the poop, the poop shoot flat cartoon pajamas. Is that how the they do it? Well maybe we don't know. We don't know cause these guys decided to get lazy and not tell us anything. Yeah. And again, I'm bummed that Ryan Gosling kind of look like a regular guy. Like they live in light them all nice. And he looked like a totally normal dude. Yeah. It was upsetting. No body shots. No. Yeah, none. I was thinking, because what I heard before we went to the movie was that there was a scene where he's on a couch on all fours and that he took his wife's head and he put it behind and forced her to, you know, he described service from behind.

Speaker 3:          00:20:22       Yeah. That'd be a cool scene. I heard that too. That that's how he was chosen for the space program. Do you think Eva Mendez Itas crumb was Ryan Gosling Nasty, nasty as hell. Why you think she's so nasty? They got two kids too. I think they do. She just looks kinda nasty. Oh my gosh. Does nasty things. Really? She looked like she down. Hmm. I don't know. You tell me you're the one that bangs hose loves her. I mean, you're the one who's always like Ryan Gosling, Ryan Gosling Creek. I'd lick his butt hole. I would, he looks on selling. Do you think that she does if, yeah, if he's his hairless as I think he is and he looks really clean. He just looks like he smells nice all the time. Yeah, I would, I would do it. Just how rob, you know how Robin Wright Penn has that air of her that she's really clean and that her butthole, is it Robin Wright Penn's still or just running right?

Speaker 3:          00:21:13       Probably just Robin Wright and she looks like her butthole doesn't smell. What is it? That shit come back. I know. How so far? How's The forest with no Kevin Spacey to kill dummy. Here it goes. Your career shit bag. God Man. Savage. Oh, that's the price you paid the price you pay for being dudes. Um, speaking of touching dudes, there's no segue for that. But, uh, well we have a lot of updates in the cigarette household. Should we finish this clip first? Oh, I didn't know it was not finished. I just want to get to work days before guests come specious ladies making. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:21:56       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:22:21       know. It kind of reminds me of, yeah, that sounds like him when he gives these speeches. It's really off of his lithium. Right. Well he said he just stopped taking his medication. Oh yeah. Yeah, she definitely did too. Yeah, that's the problem my mom refused to take stuff to and that's when things had southware. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:22:51       I thought they were going to spell it out. Like Electric Company. She's still checking or song.

Speaker 3:          00:23:06       Oh Man. Yeah. That is really unfortunate. Mm hmm. Speaking of scrum, here's a message we got. Hey Tim and crystal. I have been with my girlfriend for just over eight months now. At one month I asked her what her favorite thing in the bedroom was and she said getting her scrum licked as an ass eating virgin. I was excited to try it out and we both love it. Fast forward a week. She asked me in the shower if I would like to have my scrum licked. This was a huge curve ball is I was not prepared for an instantly declined at a politeness because as a man I don't have the prettiest asshole every day was

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       I pondered what it could possibly feel like if she likes it so much, then why would nine two one two months went by of me thinking about it. Just about every day I finally asked her to dive in what we were showering. It truly changed my life. Hands down. The best feeling ever. Nine months in our relationship is stronger than ever and I really believe it is because of ass eating. The fact that crystal has not eaten Tim's ass saddens me and I cannot stand listening to her, the climate every time it's brought up. A couple of days ago I asked her the Ftt RTD question and she would not turn me in. I believe her answer is a direct correlation to eating my ass. So Timmy, if you want to change Crystal's answer, you have to start with her eating your app. Thanks from Canada's national capitol. Oh really?

Speaker 1:          00:24:39       Interesting. Ottawa, Ottawa. Yeah. Well that's a interesting, okay. It's just theory. Yeah. I just think got to get in there. Yeah. Um, somebody a asked a couple episodes back. This is an email, a few episodes back. You talked about due to like to have their ball squeeze during sex and wondering exactly what the turn was. Well, I am one of those guys. My wife knows that I like it when she grabs my sack and just gradually squeezes harder and harder and kill. I can't take it anymore. Part of it is pleasure and pain and the other part of it, what makes it a huge turn on is just that this person who was about 75 pounds lighter than me is completely controlling me. I will literally do anything she asks me to do because my balls are completely at her mercy. For some reason, that gets me going like nothing else.

Speaker 1:          00:25:28       My wife, who probably was super confused the first time I took her hand and squeezed it down on my nuts now realizes what power she has and is also totally into it. Unrelated note. She was also not a ride or die wife. Like how's he murdered a Barista? He returned my swollen ball asking to the police without second thought. That's Nate from Milwaukee. Get Ne. That's nice. Well, I'm glad that that does shed some light on the, uh, experience here. It's makes sense. It's kind of a power thing and he likes that vulnerability of it. Makes Sense. Yeah. Sorry, are you saying you want me to squeeze your nuts tonight? Uh, I okay. Yeah, that's what saying. Sure. Yeah. Who's that? There you go. It's time for that. Yup. Oh, genes. All right, here we go. Uh, oh gosh. You know what? I did, sorry.

Speaker 1:          00:26:21       Talk for a second. I got to find it. Okay. I'll talk for a second. I did the wrong thing. I'm very much looking forward to this unplanned thing that you told me will happen tonight now. So I'm pretty much very much appreciate it. Okay. Um, so we've had a really interesting couple of days, really months with this dog. Oh, stop it. I hate that dog right now. I love her again when I fucking hated her. I know this dog has pretty much once a month had diarrhea, but we tell them the neatest part about the Cayenne and what time it happens. Yeah. It's always between like two and four in the morning. Yeah. Never any other time. The need part is that you have the ability to sleep through everything. Yeah, I do. You sleep through baby's crying, but it's not selective dogs having diarrhea. Sleep. You can't get mad at anyone, but I'm the one that has to deal with the goddamn dog.

Speaker 1:          00:27:18       Here's the cool thing that happened the other day. Kills me. So a lot of times the older boy who's two and a half, uh, he'll pop up in the middle of the night, stand in his crib and just like yell or cry. You know, I, I assume he's had a nightmare or he's just awake, you know, found himself awake and wants to be comforted. So typically I go downstairs at that time and it will be anywhere from 1130 at night to five o'clock in the morning. It's just, it's just whenever, it's not every night, but it's, you know, it's semi regularly eventful evenings and around. So the other night it's, uh, it's about five in the morning and he starts screaming and I hear him on the Monitor and so sit up and I'm like, God damn. Cause I was in a deep sleep. I know. All right. I go downstairs and I like how you go.

Speaker 1:          00:28:12       Like I know I'll always, yeah, I look like, I like how you're upset that I slept subset, that you get to sleep. Such a selfish person. But anyways, I go down there, I pick them up Iraq, um, you know, I call him him. He, he gets relaxed in 10 seconds, so relax. And then I just stay with him for a few minutes. I'm like, all right buddy, we gotta go back to sleep. And he's like, okay, put them back in, walk upstairs and you know, you're, you're more awake than you want to be. Cause it's like five now. And I'm like, fuck, I gotta go back to sleep. And as I'm walking in, I walk in the bedroom, I'm walking to the bathroom, so I'm going to brush my teeth before I go back to bed. As I'm walking there, I smelled like there is shit and this room right now.

Speaker 1:          00:29:01       So you go like, how's fuck you're in bed. You're like, how's Ellis? I'm like, there's shit in the room right now. And you're like, what? And I go turn on the light. You turn the line on. The dog was just so, so odd. It was horrible. Had Shit on the like put her ass up to the edge of the crate and slept and shit through the crate. Now for a long time our dogs, shit or shit slept with us in bed. But during the pregnancy it was like so disruptive to your sleep that we just, we have, you know, dog beds, they like it in there. It's not, or not hurting anything. So the dog though, this is odd,

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       you had actually heard her moving around. So here's the thing, I was up at 2:00 AM pumping my tits, so 3:00 AM I hear her. She never actually asked to be let out of the crate, which she does is she just kind of sniffs. She'll be like, like she'll breathe a little weirdly and she'll kind of like, ah, like make like a yawning stress. Yawn sound. Yeah. And that's how I know it's time to let her out. She doesn't act, she never paused at the crate. So it's a very subtle sounds that if I don't hear them it can be fucking really bad. So I heard the sounds at three in the morning, I walk over to her and I'm like, do you want to go potty girl? Do you want to go potty? And she looked at me like, bitch, why did you wake me up?

Speaker 3:          00:30:21       Like she did not want to go potty. So that I thought great. I went back to sleep, heard Ellis pop up and then you came back and she fucking shit. She stuck her ass like you said. And not just any shit. This is the neat part. Yeah it is dog diarrhea. It's so, it's like liquid mushy shit. And she did it in two corners of the crazy sad and the other dog is like, beef is like bitch, the fuck are, you can tell he's backed up. Yeah. He's like Nah. Yeah. When I opened the door he hops out like over her shit. So then we like again, at this point it's like five 15 in the morning. We get gloves late. I got the whole setup, the latex glove, garbage bags, spray spray. It's fucking horrible man wipes. And so we're cleaning trash bags, diarrhea, shit at five 15 in the morning.

Speaker 3:          00:31:17       So we, I wrap up the dog bed that's covered in shit throwing trash bucket. We finally get like the shit in a bag. And as I'm standing like, like all right, now let's go back to bed. The fucking smoke alarm, smoke detector goes off downstairs. Yeah. So I run downstairs. Am I trying to find which smoke detectors going off? It's in our older boys' room. Oh my God. So I opened the door and it smells, it smells like burning rubber burning. Right. Smells smoky. Yeah. And so I'm like, Oh shit. And before, I mean, I grab him and before I even turn around, you're already like, hell yeah. You're like, yeah, at the house right now, Dude, within a couple of minutes, firefighter, you know what I say? I call the fire department and I was like, get over here right now. I got two babies in this house.

Speaker 3:          00:32:08       Something's on fire. Hurry up, hurry up. And there'll, and I'm never called the fire department in my life. So I was like, this is crazy. And I told him, I got two babies, I got two babies. You gotta hurry, you gotta hurry. And they're like, well ma'am, get the babies out of the house right now. So of course we gather up the babies, we're going out to the porch. But it was amazed. They showed up. I showed up quickly, so fast. It's amazing. Fire Department. I mean, firefighters are just amazing people. But, and there came full alarms. Oh, sirens, fire firetrucks like trucks, the paramedic ambulance, and then the fire truck van all show up. These guys come storming in with axes. Yeah, I mean, and they were Jews there. They were ready to go. They're like, where's the fire? And anyways, within seconds they calm down and they're like, does your heat just run for like the first time?

Speaker 3:          00:33:01       And yeah, it's a new heater and we just had it up to then and then the fire guy goes, well, it's because it's brand new and it's burning off all the residue and stuff in there. It's, it's an Hvac situation. Yeah. I was so embarrassed and I'm standing here in my jammies and I'm like, I'm so sorry. I was, I was outside showing a Ellis the fire truck. I was like looking at the lights and he was like, oh, oh, oh. He loved it. You loved it. That was the coolest thing ever that he woke up to do that. I was mortified, but I wouldn't have called had the alarm in my son's room not gone off. No. It's scary to, in the moment, it's also five o'clock in the morning and your brain's kind of scrambling. You don't know what's happening. The next thing that happened was they left and then now it's like five 45 yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:33:52       And then our kid is like, can we play now? And I was like, I know you were going back to bed. And he was like, oh come on man. And that took another 20 minutes to get to use all freaked out. I was like, you couldn't tell somebody like you couldn't script this happening. The hidden crying dog shit, smoke detector, fire department back. I mean it was the worst night. And then two nights later the dog got diarrhea again and I was up all night with that mother fuck dog. So I took bitsy to the vet again cause we, we thought it was because she was eating stuff. It turns out she has inflammatory bowel disorder, disease, whatever it is for different than traditional IBS. Ibs is psychological. They say it's stress related, but she doesn't have diarrhea when she gets groomed or anything unrelated to to that.

Speaker 3:          00:34:48       So get something in Brussels. They're great dogs. But I think genetically she's got some stuff that dog's butt hole has been the only problem with his dog is to togs asshole. Let's um, yeah. So anyways, we put her down yesterday. Our guest is here, she's here, she's going to be on a new diet. And I'm giving her hemp oil twice a day and hopefully in a new food, a softer food that's going to help her. So, uh, our guest is here though. Let's take a quick break and grab him. All right. We're back and we have with us our guests preferred pronouns. He him post transition.

He's one of the great joke writers, so that's nice. It's funny because people will come up and they'll be like, hey, can you do this bit tonight? I'd like to see me before a show. I can't because I'm divorced and don't talk about her.

Speaker 5:          00:36:44       It's just not fair. Do you have a lot of divorce material? I don't have any. Any. Uh Huh. Do you do that purposefully? Because well, it's just like her. It's her life, you know? So if it's not 100% my story to tell, then I don't tell it. What's it do you mean because you have kids, do you still interact? Right? Absolutely. Yeah. She was eight blocks away. We live in the same town style. Wow. Split custody. So we have to talk about a kid's schedules and cod. I feel like, not that it's definitely not the biggest part of divorce, but isn't one of the things that when you remove the emotional stuff, you know, aside the logistics of scheduling, is that one of the things you're like, God damn it that like you didn't plan on when you divorced, you're like, I gotta I gotta set up Tuesday.

Speaker 5:          00:37:29       Yeah, Tuesday worked out. You know what I mean? It is tough that the hardest part was watching my daughter come over with like her laundry basket and it's like, I go, well, why don't you put those in the dresser so it's not such a pain for you? She goes, well, I mean I have to bring it back and forth. And I was like, Oh God, I fucking hardest breaking. You know what? I will buy one of each for one here and one there and then you don't have to bring shit back and forth. Now that's the sad part is the worst. But let's talk about the good part. Say that new post doc, I wish what? Like a divorce too late. Everybody's like, oh, you're divorced. Sorry. And then just absolutely. Really true. You're not getting it in second wife Tom and I keep talking about what his second wife, we're hoping that I get like a Dalmatian, you know like the girl, you're so funny and her and her brain growth outgrows her skull and she goes crazy.

Ladies, you guys are the superior sex, am I right? And then the pandering to how, how great women are. Yeah. The fake feminist. That's my favorite move. I can't believe that they told you guys I'm staying at the courtyard Marriott. I'm in room six oh nine.

Speaker 3:          00:42:26       And they just open with believe all women. You're like, how come I can't chat that exactly. I want to be in my second marriage.

That's what I'll have you like. Do you know there's such thing as a chef and fucking fucking cooking lessons bay, but I'm drunk all the time. I'm always brunching. You're just like wine buzzed all day. And the husband worked so hard just to keep me in the world. You know that I don't see him. We don't even have a relationship's fine. You spend recklessly, epically, recklessly. So I wanted to be an epic once every few months. He was like, I mean, 600 grand on the AMX cheese, but don't I look good sweetie? Pretty true. And it's cheaper to keep her head and he puts you behind each. Just say I'm a be home.

Speaker 3:          00:44:05       Keep me then to divorce me. That's why he keeps me. Yeah, it's true. Yeah. It has a fair isn't it's fine cause I'm not giving them a second wife works. That's so great. No, that's how it works. You guys are really setting this up. Not a great life. You know when you make to California, you're going to find your second. He's going to get pissy.

I have really sensitive nuts. So yeah, so you're like no thanks. It's like just keep it up. Just keep it above the sac. Yeah. Above this. So you don't want like, you don't want to like that. They're just real sense. I don't know. Like there are always bruised or something. I don't know what's going on and I got to have a sec to me. And zero problems didn't hurt no pain. They uh, talked to Tom about this cause I, I need this to happen. You had paint. Oh, you haven't gotten one? No. Yeah, I can't have another kid. Yeah, it's something in a, in a jar and then freeze it. If you want to have another with your second wife are having more children. Are you sure baby man, I wanted a sperm set. Call it a dinosaur. It sounded kind of like it, right?

Speaker 5:          00:46:05       Walk us through the process. Yeah, we went in and the guy, uh, he has an APP. He's like a accent. He's a, by the way, is this in Ferguson? Do you have a setup appointment before this to like, yeah. So you have to go in and I'm asking you, you have to go in and get the consult. And during the consult though, he said, uh, because of a vasectomy, you can speed up cancer in your crotch area. Why everywhere prostate? I don't know. Well, here's the thing. Don't tell people that this is true because I don't know if he, maybe he was just fucking with me. Maybe in a small town, maybe he was just like, oh, funny man. Huh. Right. But anyways, yeah. So he gave me the, you want cancer, prostate, prostate exam, and then I went in and it's like people I went to high school with or the nurses.

Speaker 5:          00:46:56       Oh Christ. So you're sitting there with a shaved everything. Right. It's freezing in the room. Not an excuse. Right. Uh, but it's just weird. Yeah, of course. Falls. Remember when, remember when we had creative writing together and they're like moving your dick to the other leg and you're like, cool, this is so comfortable, man. I've never seen my dick as small as I've seen it in a doctor's office. You know? It is funny. It's like I've looked down and been like, you've gotta be kidding me. Then this is just like for a physical, I, I'll feel like I got to fluff this a little bit just for like my own self esteem. You really think he's looking at you and I don't think so. I think I'm just like, what the fuck? I'm better than this, you know? Do you think about like nakedness and Ah, I think I'm just more like just smacking around. Yeah, just smack around. Just to give it like, just some dignity. I mean, I've seen it literally a new level of small in a doctor's office when you have to Wipe when you pee.

Speaker 5:          00:48:01       Do we have a concave Dick Right now? What's going on? I mean like retreats inside. I've never seen it. I think it's because of the medical atmosphere and you know, you're a little, you know, somebody poking and prodding. Yeah. You're nervous. It's cold. It's always fucking cold. Yeah. I got embarrassed when my doctor, I was like nine months pregnant. My doctor was examining me and I farted right in his hands and I was like, I just, I farted on you. He's like, it's okay. I remember that. No, I was there the the time after and he's like, farts happen. Everybody farts. But he's still talking about it somehow. Yeah. Two months later, two months, two months, 11 months pregnant. That's, I'm not going to match. So weight on the, so the console is, he gives you, he's like, you're gonna die. And then he, he gives you a further exam and he was like, okay, sum up the deal.

Speaker 5:          00:48:50       Really Healy, I have to tell you, have you ever, he lubed up the whole glove and I actually said, my insurance is not going to pay for all that because there was a doll up. You know what a dollop is? That requires a spoon. Yeah. And it was, I was just like, what in the fuck. So he goes, elbows on the desk. It wasn't, I still don't think this is what should have happened because it was so weird. Elbows on the desk and he just goes in now why is the thumb, I don't know. Well, maybe it was, I don't know. I guess I wasn't looking, but I assumed phone. That's what I would've done. Wow. So he fingers, you're be home. Yup. And then when you come so hard all over and he goes, that's not cancer. That's just a great time. I had to go like, did it come out and do this morning?

Speaker 5:          00:49:42       Did he take his nails and then gently prod right in between my shoulder blades. He bunched up my shirt and twisted it and I was like, Ooh, I like this a lot. So console, he's like, you're good to go. Your asshole, your balls, everything's good. Yup. And then you come back. He said it like that cause that your asshole, you're bald, everything's good. Come back. How long later? Next week? Maybe two weeks. Something like that. And so what's the day like when you go, is there a preppy, he's like, don't eat before. Like how does it go? You can do whatever. You just have to shave everything. Everything. Yep. Nope, but taint twigging Mary's, I like to get maybe halfway down. Yeah, I got long taint hair when I'm in the shower. Sometimes I'll go down and I'll look at it. I'll just see like, I mean everyone does

Speaker 6:          00:50:36       when you walk, it's like when you wash a dog though, the hair always looks longer. That's true. That's true. It's like a dog's beard. Hang. Yeah. From my tank always looks longer cause it's like altogether and then pointing down the water's got to go some gravity. Let's blame it on gravity.

Speaker 5:          00:50:50       So you go, you go in, you're all shaved and then he's just like, how does it, how does it, how does it start? Like what was he like?

Speaker 6:          00:50:57       Okay, it looks like the opening scene of up, there's two ladies in there and then uh, they strapped

Speaker 5:          00:51:02       you down. No, I'm just kidding.

Speaker 6:          00:51:09       But they just, you know, they tell you don't move, don't touch anything and then you can smell it. You can smell the Qataris cauterizing catheterization. Clearly they do Nami that they shoot you in the, in the vast with the local

Speaker 5:          00:51:21       cool. But the vast, the vast offerings. So, okay. You feel it. You feel different. Zach, Zach Efron and injection. Yeah. You feel that and then after that you don't feel anything. Right. But you do smell. Yeah, you can smell when there long. Does that help procedure take, I don't know, 20 minutes maybe. No soreness afterwards. Why you had to sit on a bag of peas and I didn't lift anything for the weekend. But otherwise that's, that's it. And then how many jackets do you have to Jack? Before, I think I had to bring in three samples to make sure there's no swimmers. The Crystal meth before you Jack, take crystal meth. And whenever I see that sounds really easy town. That doesn't sound too bad for me.

Speaker 6:          00:52:13       It was, I mean, your kids are little. So if you ha if you start over, no, that's not, I mean, I have a 19 year old, the 14 year old, that'd be nice. So you throw a fucking baby into that negative. And where's the bridge? Yeah, for me, not that I'm not a monster. Right, right. But you would definitely be like, there goes my life. Well, I mean, imagine, imagine four years left on your prison sentence and then you shoot somebody in the yard and they're like, you're here forever now. I mean, that's, that's how I think about it. I mean, if, what if you got someone? Yeah. So now you can't get someone pregnant. I sure can't. Yeah. And you got, you tested that a few times and I've called in and I go, so do I need to test us like every six months and a they go, you don't, and I'll just bring it in anyways. I'm like, can we make sure we really, absolutely nuts. And Robbie left and right. It sounds like it's not road beef. It's just me needing an excuse to jerk off and feeling whole about it.

Speaker 5:          00:53:07       Oh, I see. Wow. So was Tom. I'm, are we doing this or what? Doing what? Oh, you're getting snips. I'll get snipped please. Uh, let's do a live remote from there. How about December? Since I'm a home from

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       scratch. Seriously. I would love that. I've been on birth control since I was 15 and I can't do it anymore. But you know, they'll make you do mouth checks. That's what the doctrine is. Taste test. You have to go like, yeah, there's nothing in there that can get me pregnant. You have to do it like, oh, okay.

Speaker 5:          00:53:40       Can I just tell you, you just blew my mind because I burped and kept it in my throat and then you burped in. The noise came through and I was like, did I just fucking Melton respectful exact same time. I kept it in my throat. God. Oh, that was nuts. That is got it. Crazy

Speaker 1:          00:54:02       synergy. Synergy. Oh wait, two people bourbon fart at the same time. It's really magical stuff. You guys are really good friends. We're sinked up our cycle. Do you have any weird porns that you're into? Like are you into watch and weird stuff?

Speaker 5:          00:54:17       I don't and it's gotten to the point, no weird kinks. It's almost the opposite of that where, you know, something will be on and then I'll just have to stop and be like, wait a second. That's his real mom. Not like a step. I can't watch this shit. That's disgusting. I was watching two Russians, one, or excuse me, two Germans one time and uh, I was all ready to go. Everything locked and loaded and uh, and one of the ladies looked at the other one and goes, sucks these tits, you bitch. And I couldn't stop laughing and I just was like, well, this is done. Yeah, I wish we had that audio for this show. It's you bitches. Great. I laughed. So goddamn on. Yeah, there's weird stuff that's like bald porn. But we had a,

Speaker 1:          00:55:08       we played, uh, we had Josh potter come in. He brought in weird, like some of the weirdest stuff he could find. And then we've put a call out there for other weird things, you know, just beyond the normal, the vanilla stuff. And we got this email says, hey, I just watched episode four, 69 of when Josh Potter was on and showed me the video of a nameless hero doing God's work and servicing the genitals of prep, of crippled, undesirables, the topic of disabled porn and more specifically porn with people who are missing limbs came up. And as a 20 year old man missing both legs, let me tell you, the people who fetishize missing limbs are very real. Someone with an amputee fetish is revert to as a divo tea. And there are different sides of it. Some people just want to have sex with an amputee.

Speaker 1:          00:55:58       Some people get sexual pleasure from the desire to become an amputee. There are certain instances where people have actually mutilated themselves to become an amputee so they can pop a bone bone and then squirt till sundown. It is very common for amputees to have people randomly messaged them on Facebook and other social media and ask to see pictures of their stump or ask me if they ever use their stump during sex. There are mixed feelings in the amputee community about divo teas because some people think it's gross. Some people think it's nice. Personally, I think that knowing someone may want to, Russell my jimmies due to me missing limbs is awesome. Many people, many people missing limbs are very self conscious feel. They may never find someone who will want to skeet there, mate. Knowing the Divo t his exists can, uh, it gives myself and other crippled hope too that we can get our dicks lik to thank you for bringing up yet another important topic and for truly being the voice of the people and America's podcast piss on me.

Speaker 1:          00:56:57       Beat me. And a face of Fart, Nathan, a pacifier. And these emails are so beautifully written. Yeah, that's fantastic. Um, so I didn't know that there was that whole segment of society. How do you get there? Do you lose your virginity to somebody with thick legs and you're like, I need more access to actually, how do we do that? I'm always fascinating to though that whatever your condition, whatever it is, there is somebody that's very turned on by that you can be 600 pounds. You could be missing a limb, you can be unable to walk. And someone out there, I was like, God, I fucking love that shit. Such a turn on. I mean they really do. There's really something that turns everybody on. I Dunno. Not In Minneapolis. Fergus falls, the Fergus falls. No, maybe not. Well again, I told you they're all married and they've been non married.

Speaker 1:          00:57:46       Yeah, we got to find you. The hot pot weather slots, the hot weather sluts. They're out there, man. Arizona. You're right. I'm real slots. Are Somebody also message that, um, whoever did that Photoshop gang member of the guys transitioning to women, they said that they did me dirty. You have. And they told me, Tom, you have serious potential as a super hot chick. You look like a Russian porn star. How God should have made Jesus. I am rock hard and came to four strokes on these. Uh, love you both and your podcast is hilarious. Shaun. Shaun said this is a better representation of me as huh? Uh Huh. That's actually, that's you as a, as a woman. Yeah. Well that's somebody who I think put maybe my, maybe my eyes in they're little and then half did the mouth. Well, here's the problem with your transition that I foresee.

Speaker 1:          00:58:42       First of all. Oh, that's better. That's your hairline. We're going to have to do some restaurant chain. Yeah. Like major surgery there to bring it down a little bit more. Uh, electrolysis. You've got so much facial hair, a lot of hormones and your size. You're so big. We're going to have to thin you out three to pass. Wow. I mean, what are you doing mentally? She just kicked the shit. I know. I mean, as a woman, I think it's a compliment that it would be really complex. Like she's been wanting to say all that shit for a long time and this was just a way to sneak it in. I think you're, I'm just saying as a woman, as a woman, not pass. Do you think you'd ever do anything for your hairline? Um, no. Good for you. No. No. I've got to let it ride. I think you look great too. I'm just doing the, uh, the buzzing. That's it. Trim it down. Absolutely. Yeah. That's it. Yeah. You've got a full head of hair, right? I do. Lucky guy. Yeah. Well thank you. It's very, it's nice. Yup. Got that going for me. I can the full head of hair. Oh my God. You show do fucking, when we were in Asia together, every chick walked up to him and I was like, you're hot

Speaker 5:          00:59:57       shot. Like serious hair. Yeah, they did. They were super anything. My sunken in eyeballs because I hadn't slept in two weeks. It's like, hey, hey ladies. Yeah. Every single one of them. Ridiculous. He ever dated Asian persuasion?

Speaker 1:          01:00:13       I have not. Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:00:16       Maybe single Chad. Well, no, I mean, not for any reason. It's just again, because you're racist. Northern Minnesota, so it's like when we did a white girl or a wider girl. Yeah, that's true, right? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:00:25       It's super white. Is there any diversity? Northern Minnesota. Very little. Yeah. That's another thing is going to happen when you move to that hot pissy climate, you're going to get different, different looks. Man. That's going to be exciting for you. Different look. Definitely Indian girl, Asian girls, fucking black Latina. It's all gonna come to you. You're gonna be knocking the chicks off your Dick.

Speaker 5:          01:00:50       Yeah. I mean there's no doubt about it. Can I ask you a question? Yeah. How long does it take you to Fart in front of somebody after you meet them? I'm like, do you fart in front of girls? You fart in front of friends. Shabby farted in front of Tom. You guys have been friends for years.

Speaker 1:          01:01:07       I, I mean, I don't know if I have to. I do. Do you know where I met Chad? I met him on the flight at the airport right before the flight to Hong Kong, so we met there. That's when we met. We, we'd heard about each other and talk. I think we've tweeted each other or message each other before. And I remember one of the first things I did on that flight was I went to take a shit and that was in there probably 10 feet and I just met Chad and as I walk out of it, you know there's always a little bit of like, I wonder if anyone noticed. I was in the bathroom for like 10 minutes. So I was on the flight. I just shut the door head down. I look up and Chaz like it was 16 minutes and he looked at me. Yeah. What were you doing? Yeah, he was really letting me know that he knew that I took, it doesn't count for the Mile High Club. So wait, you're asking me about farting though?

Speaker 5:          01:02:02       Well, because my husband Tom has this neat habit of just farting in front of everybody. Sure. And he just told me yesterday we were eating dinner and he goes, I, I was working out with my trainer and I just farted in front of him on the treadmill and the other guys really mad

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       and the gym. And I was like, well, of course they're mad dummy. Nobody wants to smell your farts. What happened was I'm running, no, that's what happened. And I go like, alternate story. And then my trainers like, you know, probably 10 feet away, he's sitting on one of those boxes, you know, those box jump things. And he was like, he goes, was that the, was it, was that the treadmill? He was, he was genuinely confused. Like, what was it? I go, yeah, it was a treadmill. And I go, no, I farted. And he was like, okay. And then I go, oof man, that smells bad. Smells were really bad. And he's like, great. And it's a small, it's like a small chin. And then like 10 seconds later I smelled this fresh, like unbelievably fresh scent. I'm like, what the fuck is that? He's like, Oh, I just sprayed down this whole gym with this natural, and then I realized that that whole time, 10 feet behind, he was another guy just sitting down on like another piece of equipment and I go, oh, I didn't know you were back there.

Speaker 3:          01:03:25       He was like, yeah, yeah, it was, you know when people really want you to put shit particles into the air when they're breathing their hardest, right? Maximum heart rate and you just shit right in there. And I feel like it's dangerous to hold it in at the gym for some reason. I always let it rip at the gym. I feel like when you're like exerting yourself and they're trying to punish yourself and you're like, oh, this is uncomfortable, I'm not going to hold it in. I've always thought to myself, you ever want to meet the prettiest girl in the world going out to a hotel gym and Fart? Because she'll be there in two minutes. He will, right? Yeah. And you'll have it to yourself for 45 minutes at minute 47 now all of a sudden you're like, oh, hey, no. Did you see that other guy walking out? Wow. What a jerk. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:04:11       He said he was going to say, cause it's become a pattern for Tom now where he's just been kind of farting indiscriminately. Like we had Doug Mallard in here and he brought his fiance over within minutes of meeting her, he farted in front of her at our dinner and I'm surprised you haven't fired it in front of our nanny. And then she came right in the other night and smelled that. I think once you get through the first couple, [inaudible] happens. Sometimes what I do is fart and I go, oh my gosh, I'm so embarrassed. We try to justify it. You guys, this is amazing. I haven't floated in, here's the doctor said I'd never fart again. It's what an accomplishment. This is actually a celebration right now. I can't believe you guys were here to witness this. Exciting. So I'm guessing you don't do this in front of people. I don't. I don't know what it is. I think a single guy now that's what it is. He's looking for that new road beef and he knows that. You can't find your way there,

Speaker 5:          01:05:19       but that now if you go out on a date a few times, let's say if you get comfortable, how long would it take you to fart in front of a lady or do you know that normally at first happens on accident, right? Is it a few months in? Probably. Yeah. Probably like something like a, you have a good jumper cables where they come in and just both sides of your ribs. Yeah. That happened once. She thought it was going to be so funny and I just all over. Yeah. And that that was acting. Then I'm like, well thank you for, we broke the barrier. Yeah. Thanks for doing that. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:05:50       Somebody emailed in about this. Uh, Hey Tom McCarthy. I'm a woman in her thirties. I have more gas than anyone I know. Dating is hard for me because I get crippling stomachache and basically have to run home just to Fart. How early is too early to start farting in front of a significant other? Uh, I currently just met a guy. He's very fun but very polite. He doesn't seem like the type of person I could in front of Fart in front of ever. Oh, should I end it now? Should I just give up on dating? I'm not completely haggard. I'm a pretty normal looking girl. Just within an excessive amount of gas. Sincerely Gassy, Kaitlin. I feel okay. Let's start from the, the science of it. Do you know why you're so gassy? Have you gone to the doctor? Maybe it's your diet. What are you doing? Is there any way to reduce your gas? Change what you're eating and it should, it should affect it. Maybe like Betsy puts some hemp oil, like our dog on your food.

Speaker 5:          01:06:43       See if that is your stomach. Yeah. Why? Why do you have to run all the way home? Can't you just like leave the room? Yeah. It's probably on how smelling you'd be like, I just, uh, I drank so much water before I got here today and just keep going to the bathroom to pee or be like, I'm a good person and I'm leaving a room to fart. Right. Does it this way? You don't have to buy what we're finding. We're, we're missing the, the, the, the, the, the thing that she should be pursuing. What the guy that loves farts. That's your, and I gotta say, yeah, there's a lot of them out there. It's surprising. We discovered that a while ago and we got a whole bunch of messages from guys who are like, the whole idea of a pretty girl making a stinky smell turns me off. They love it. Now if you can handle the smell of your own farts. Yeah. I'm sure there are guys that would love to suck it into their mouth, come up and then blow it back in your face.

Speaker 3:          01:07:36       There are guys out there that it would have been nothing more than Kaitlin farting around. Maybe she doesn't want like a fetish person. Yeah. No, but it's somebody who, who likes her and like, and also like that. Yeah. Is a Fraser fight, Caitlin. There's also gas x and phase. I'm, if you've tried taking those, you may want, right. She's asking me, well, I've got so far it's been, no, she's asking you about what to do about this dude. I would say get your diet checked out. Take the phase, I'm the Bino and hang out with him for awhile.

Speaker 5:          01:08:07       Or maybe just say, hey man, go off. You'll be as nice. A lot of interesting. Yes. But up, Eh, we cheese. Uh, your main

Speaker 7:          01:08:16       characteristic, your page out, your main characteristic. Well, my main characteristic of my specialty is a face farting.

Speaker 3:          01:08:27       Yeah. Yeah. I'm playing this like your power is the best part. Uh, let's see. I Dunno. I Dunno.

Speaker 7:          01:08:37       I don't know.

Speaker 3:          01:08:38       Oh, that's it. Okay. Oh, that's it. Oh yeah. I don't know which episode that's in.

Speaker 8:          01:08:46       Okay. All right. Ready? All right.

Speaker 3:          01:08:57       Well this is happening out on the street. There's a truck driving. Yeah. Yeah. It's out on the street. No, they're in front of like a dairy queen. It's terrible. Yeah. It's really stupid. Yeah. Wow. There you go. You know what? I just reminded me of Tommy talking about 40 at the gym. Tom and I used to live in silver lake, which is a predominantly gay area. We used to work out at this gym that was known for having bears workout. They're like big dudes. And they remember that one bear that would always build his mosque. How can I forget? And he would like, he would use a treadmill that was placed right? Like the, there was a fan right in front of him. There's always that fucking asshole. And then his bear juice is just being spread. I'm trying to do a podcast and rafting and the smell of this guy, his balls just throughout the whole jam or that guy did it work?

Speaker 3:          01:09:45       Did they attract other cub? Yeah, of course. At work. Dude smelled horrendous and was the biggest guy in the gym. Like a big Samoan, you know, like six, three, three 30 had fucking Pearce knows crazy tattoos and just stunk that. He would just proudly walk around like, and that works a smell. I mean it must've worked. It must have worked. I don't know what these base by face, right? That's a guy who pretends to understand what phase farting mates. Yeah. So he's like, what these these, it's Italian guy. And she's like, let me show you. He's like, okay. Soon as she does, he's like, thank you. That was amazing. He's special.

Speaker 3:          01:10:28       That's what Katelyn needs. Yeah. Just a face farting guy. A pig. Yeah. A real pig. I think you'll find out that, uh, you know, if the guys into you, you can fart whenever. It doesn't matter. I've had girls around me all the time and it doesn't, we haven't finished the truth of it. Let's have Chad way. Yeah, sure, sure. So I'm doing the psychopath test. Oh, great. Psychology test here. And Christina is doing it too. Um, and I need to answer a few more questions on the air we all take down, aren't here. I'll give you a paper pen if you want. Sure. You can take down some answers. So here's the, here is the question number six. Uh, by the way, that the way that you, uh, the number score, this is, um, a five is a very good match to the, to the statement.

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       Okay. A four is a good three is moderate to slight and one nothing. So think of it as one means. I actually do not agree with the statement for yourself or is that how you're doing it, right? Yeah. Okay. So the next question, do you think I am like, I feel like if four's good, I got the rest of them all the way down. Just like to give explicit instructions. Sorry. Um, I find that I am able to pursue one goal for a long time. Okay. Let's see here. I'm answering that. Okay. Uh, next question. My main purpose in life is to get as many goodies as I can. Get a definition on goodies. Yeah, exactly. It's road beef. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:12:01       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:12:03       Okay. Um, next one is I don't play on anything very far in advance.

Speaker 9:          01:12:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:12:13       Oh, next one's interesting. Making a lot of money is my most important goal. It's a fine.

Speaker 9:          01:12:21       Mm.

Speaker 1:          01:12:24       And let's see, we don't want to bore people with just reading these questions. So what, we're going to share our answers. I know we are very shortly, I quickly lose interest in tasks I start.

Speaker 9:          01:12:37       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:12:41       And I let others worry about higher values. My main concern is with the bottom line cheese. It's a yes for Tom. Not at all. No. All right. All right, well that's a guy that's number six through 11. Yeah. So let's go ahead and share our answers. Okay. I find that I'm able to pursue one goal for a long time. This is strong match for me. I five what'd you get? Oh, were the two a a slight, slight match for you. Okay, go ahead. Um, my main purpose in life is to get as many goodies as I can. I'm a too. And what were the three? I went with a three. Wow. These are fucking psychos. Okay. That's of moderate match shark. Go ahead. I don't plan anything very far in advance. I got a four just because we have two children who are prone to sickness. Standup careers. Yeah. I went with a three because in my professional life I have to plan things a year in advance. And in my personal life, I don't know what's happening tomorrow. Trail. And what was the one you don't, you don't plan it all. Oh, I misinterpreted that.

Speaker 1:          01:13:54       Hold on. Sorry. Read the question again. The statement is I don't plan anything very far in advance and I feel like I do plan things very far in advance. So that's a one meaning you disagree with that? I disagree with the statement that I don't plan things. We do. You do plenty of things, right, so I think I interpreted correct. Listen, I'm just going to admit I put three down for all of these cause I didn't understand any of them. Okay. How about this one? This is very revealing. Making a lot of money is my most important goal for hello to Jesus. I put a four as well, but you have to understand, I live in a place where if comedy doesn't pan out, that's what I tell people when they're not laughing. I go, do you think this fucking matters? I could mow lawns and make my mortgage.

Speaker 1:          01:14:37       I live in the middle of nowhere. That's very interesting. Yeah. I like, but I like having all og money or money's great, but I'm just saying like where I live, I don't need a lot of it. That's trail. I quickly lose interest in tests. I start. Where do you go for that? I'd strongly disagree. That's a one. That's where I went. Five. Did you really? Oh absolutely. I have fucking lumber for stuff that I was going to build three years ago in my garage. Still. I think I should be more, I think I, now that I hear this and like talk about it, I put a one, but I think it's fair to give myself a couple points higher. You lose interest in, I mean, I'm a thing in, I don't think it's a complete five and I don't think it's a one. I think I probably should be at two or three.

Speaker 1:          01:15:26       I agree with that, you know, because there's things that I'm very much able to pursue as a task and, and then there are some things that I like hearing him say. I'm like, yeah, I've done that where I've bought the thing to do the thing. And then I'm just like, man, I haven't listened to a full sentence this entire time, so I'm for sure. Okay. Okay. Um, all right, so here we go. And then I let others worry about higher values. My main concern is with the bottom line, if that isn't not to bait the craziest of the crazy. And people who hear that and they're like, definitely. Um, I, I don't agree with that at all. I was a two de got to leave a little space. Little space is good. All right. Clearly Chad is the sociopath. No, no, I'd say there's no doubt about it.

Speaker 1:          01:16:22       I'm very calm. Yeah. Well, you know, we learned about our heart, right? That's true. So I was watching this a crime documentary thing on Netflix and uh, they said that one, it's not confirmed, but it's like proposed idea that's an indicator for sociopath is, uh, is that many of them have a low resting heart rate. And the theory is that they need excitement to just feel alive, feel normal. Yeah. To get, to get to normal so that they do things that are high risk and you know, crazy things basically to just elevate that heart rate. That's always, I mean, you remember when I

Speaker 6:          01:17:10       slid down the wet hill and Hong Kong to traffic? Yeah. Uh, that, that is right.

Speaker 1:          01:17:15       By the way, a, that is a not completely vivid description of what he did was terrifying.

Speaker 3:          01:17:25       I mean, on, on it then or purpose. So on purpose on a hill in the rain,

Speaker 6:          01:17:31       Steep Hill and there they have a uh, in the city and not like they have an escalator. That's how steep the hill is. Yes. So everyone's on this escalator cause there's a top over it and it's raining fuck. And with all the soot in the air, it comes down with the rain and made it very greasy for yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:17:46       So that the hillside is like, it's basically the picture wet brick, you know, it's like God v and he gets a trashcan lid off jumps monster going. Yeah. And slides down like, like headfirst. Like it's like an angel. Oh my God. We just like see him going and then we just see cars rounding a turn coming around. He's down

Speaker 6:          01:18:09       talking to a taxi, trying to negotiate to get back across the bay to our hotel. He pulls his head out, the window looks at me and goes, what the fuck? And then back in negotiating it was wow, it was really scary. Nightmarish. But my resting heart rate's nine, so I need to do stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          01:18:26       Say both of you are psychos. Like, I have a really low resting heart rate too. I had it where like they were like one guy, the Nice Guy, the nice tech at the, at Cedars when they were examining my heart was like, man, it's really low. He's like, uh, do you work out? Yeah. And I go, yeah. And then like the nurse came in who was no nonsense. She was like, it looks at the thing. She was like, wow, it's really low. He goes, the guy goes, he works out though. And she looks at me. She's like, no, no, no, not like that. He doesn't,

Speaker 6:          01:19:02       this is something upstairs

Speaker 1:          01:19:03       mouse. Yeah. Um, anyways, yeah. So maybe that's, is that the root of it, you know? Well, that could be, I want to see a total fucking pig. Yeah. At the airport, somebody sent this in. Was this from the actual listener says, I'm currently waiting for my flight home and witnessed something absolutely disgusting in a, in the middle of a crowded terminal. This is low and loose behavior and has absolutely floored me in a terminal. No, no,

Speaker 3:          01:19:38       no. This guy. Oh my God, this is, I'm going to vomit. She goes on to say, she says this guy, I took his shoes and socks off, started picking at the skin between his toes and peeling his blisters right here in the terminal. I mean that is savagery. That is absolute insanity to witness. So inappropriate. I've seen people clip their nails. Yes. In public on airplanes. It's so gross.

Speaker 6:          01:20:10       My daughter was really bothering me one week and so I picked up, I took the whole skin off of a blister and let it dry and then I put it on her pillow. She hoes fucking murdered me in my sleep. But you know what? Don't be an asshole all week. Yeah, that's true. She was really, yeah. Yeah. It's just, you know, she come and tell you when she discovered it. Yeah. She, I mean she screamed. She didn't come tell me. Oh, she just, she sat above her bed yard, gas, gas to just freaking out when you were like, yeah, go to bed. Just give her one of those resting heart rate. Yeah. Very calm.

Speaker 3:          01:20:48       Very calm. Do you think that grooming in any enclosed space with other humans that you don't, you're not related to is just disgusting. It's completely unacceptable. I vomit. Even just having some girl brush her fucking horsey hair on the airplane. It's crazy. Why are you brushing your hair and all your dirty Dandre flakes are everywhere in the, in the year. Yeah. You know, and your dirty fucking hair. Yeah. The thing is everyone knows what the, I mean, if you're clipping your nails, you're so fucking by God to do that in a plane or a terminal. So I've seen people,

Speaker 6:          01:21:22       well, just fun clip, clip light. That actually reminded me of that brush thing. My daughter has pulled all the hair out of her bra and then packed it in my suitcase. That's pretty great. That's pretty great. It's a smart girl. It was a fucking cause. You pull out your stuff, you're like, oh my God. It's like, it's my version of a love note, Dan. I love you. Come back soon.

Speaker 3:          01:21:44       Oh my God. That's fine. Um, let's see if this motivates Chad too. Maybe. I don't know. Open his mind. Open his heart and change the way he sees things. You know,

Speaker 10:         01:21:54       I'm sitting here in the desert. It was just looking at this beautiful vastness, um, and thinking of those times of how I've compromised myself because I was so afraid to be alone and this desert reminded me of lonely path I've had to travel within and how I've had to put everything that I love and everything I've built on the line to simply be happy and how it can be the most terrifying thing to do. You can feel absolutely lonely.

Speaker 6:          01:22:25       This is why people cheat right here. This kind of shit. Yeah, right. Hey, check out this video. I did all right. Yeah. You're like, well that's, this isn't

Speaker 3:          01:22:36       Instagram post. Like, this isn't even just on her website that maybe, you know, if you're really interested in Jada Pinkett Smith, you're going to go and she's all talking about wellness. Like this is fucking insane. Do you think that, um, she bust this out when, uh, oh my gosh. What'd you think when will's like a, uh, my new movie I just shot, you know, it was a, that's coming out next month. I'm pretty excited by, she's like, check out what I just shot.

Speaker 6:          01:22:59       Yeah, it'd be great if this was on her Instagram. And then what fought, the next thing you clicked on was, this is a story all

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       about how am I gonna fit?

Speaker 10:         01:23:11       This is beautiful where she is so much beauty there and we should all just look at how we're compromising ourselves and our lives compromising our happiness simply to not be alone. Sounds like you used to love and here's to you. Oh boy. Sounds like there's troubling

Speaker 5:          01:23:30       marriage. You know what I mean? She's like compromising myself, not happy. Hey, when people take that tone because you know they're lying and they don't believe themselves. Sorry. Yeah. Oh, ah. You guys been working on a lot and I feel great and I don't have to, it's, it's fine. Yeah. That's horse shit. Oh yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:23:47       yeah, yeah, yeah. You think that like, a lot of this is just, um, it's just directed at, you know, one person and everything is like, it's meant to be like this is public consumption. I'm just putting it out there. But yeah, I'm really just trying to tell you something.

Speaker 5:          01:24:00       I think so that's kind of my favorite stuff. You're like, this isn't for everybody. So you have two options, right? I can go home and be like, I fucking did everything for you. Or you can find a desert and be like, I've put everything on the line.

Speaker 1:          01:24:17       Um, I've been picked on a lot on this show. I don't believe that I have been for what I laugh at. People think it's really wrong. Sometimes Chad, I'd agree with that statement,

Speaker 5:          01:24:29       but he gets picked on for laughing. Laughs it inappropriate shit. Both. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:24:34       Yeah, that's true. That's true statement. Here's a submission. Do you think this is

Speaker 11:         01:24:41       okay?

Speaker 10:         01:24:42       Funny. That's good. Now I like where it's going already. I know for a fact that I saw it though. There was no question about that. Rather read time now. Then fucking retire. Big Old fish breaks meal for people listening.

Speaker 1:          01:24:56       Guy Who's a fishing, great forearms, great forum. Veiny probably just has those natural strong forearms, you know, just, yeah, he, he lives in outdoorsman. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         01:26:13       Ah, her fucking hearse. Gosh, he was just so fun for so long.

Speaker 1:          01:26:20       Yeah, he was. He actually wrote in, we rarely get the person who made the video and send in the video. Usually somebody else sending it in. He goes, I recently found your channel understanding you like videos of people getting hurt. So here you go. I personally don't find it funny because it happened to me, but all my pieces, shit, quote friends seem to enjoy me screaming like a bitch. Craig. Well Craig, I did enjoy it. Absolutely fantastic. Yeah. Cause he said I'm going to get this fee. Like, you know, the big strategy behind it. Yeah. And then all of a sudden attack mode. And you thought that was funny. I picked up like a prairie dog. Yeah. I have the worst posture and all of a sudden I was like, what? Like I'm in the military trying to watch that shit. Um, but do you laugh at like things like that? Absolutely. You do. Now you guys are besties. That's what I, yeah, yeah, sure.

Speaker 4:          01:27:13       Oh, I better do something

Speaker 1:          01:27:22       that grounds coming pretty fast.

Speaker 9:          01:27:26       You heard it?

Speaker 1:          01:27:28       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:27:30       Why did you launch it? Took it hard. Oh God. Ah,

Speaker 1:          01:27:39       yeah. You heard that shit crunch that was coming status coming. Really what it how funny is it on a scale of one to five, five being you very much agree. Can you go through all of the numbers? Just good. Three being moderately agree. I think if you jump out of a plane and something bad happens to you. Yeah. Yeah. Then that should be, oh, here comes another one.

Speaker 2:          01:28:11       What was that? What was that? Oh well that's straight up a car was Bakula stuck. Looked it up, send it in. Yeah. That guy is that his son's hit the back window. Right. I don't know. It's so, these were real concerned though. I was like, God damn, I slept in my car. Yes. What though? We played this

Speaker 1:          01:28:52       so many times, so we've really gotten it out there. It happened in Taiwan. It turns out, because some people were like, that guy's definitely, his legs are removed. He was fine.

Speaker 5:          01:29:02       He was actually really, yeah. This was in the news there. Guide turned out to be totally fine. He's bruised, but it definitely looked worse. Yeah. It looked like he was going to get a lot of that amputee. Yeah. Divo t emails. Uh, yeah. Is that funny for you to, I mean, don't stand behind the car I have. It's, it's all this common sense shit. Yeah. Right. Yeah. That's a, that's, that's true. That's a different perspective. People always make fun of me because when I walk into a bathroom, I always look behind the door. If I'm at a bar, I peeked behind the door just because of my friends are like, what are you doing? I'm like, wow, that's not gonna be so funny. When you get butt fucked in here but I'm not going to, yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:29:41       you're a part of that. The rape culture. You're afraid of a kind of how women have to deal with the world. Do you navigate the world the way we do? Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:29:49       Well I just like to know what's behind the door that way went I'm cause we don't have to question it. Right. You know, we do that to someone in here. We're going to fucking attack me right here. Makes lot of sense in here. In this house especially. No, no one's going to, you're fine. Right. Um, no tune tune. This is my heartbeat tuned to me. Takes that long. That long. That slow. Yeah. Have you been, have you had it checked out? Really?

Speaker 3:          01:30:19       You kind of like a problem when I sleep people think I'm dead. You should probably have it looked at, you know, they can just do like a sonogram of it. Cause my mom had some heart defects. They checked mine and make sure I didn't have it. I don't anyway, they just put a thing over it to do quick, quick. They can look at it. I just think it's cause I don't know how to love if you guys have not yet been convinced to see Chad or guessing not so funny today you have been, if you have not yet been convinced to see him live, uh, we highly recommend it. But we also think you might be convinced by the web stuff he's been doing.

Speaker 13:         01:31:01       No. When I say I don't work, I only mean that I ended regular full time employment at age 40. Since those like me who are on disability don't seem to need it. I'll explain. Oh boy. Highly intelligent. I was born with physical problems and severe learning disability that got worse with time.

Speaker 5:          01:31:21       What the fuck is this? I was just trying to explain where I was at that day. Yeah, it's a cool backdrop.

Speaker 3:          01:31:29       I kind of feel like a map of the, and a a symbol. Um, some might say is a swastika. Just thought that was here. Like wind power. Oh No, I just letting people know where you stand. Can I tell you something? I don't even know what it, what is about to happen? Yeah. My, my why Mh tinglies are telling me this is going, this might be something we're going to enjoy for, for weeks to come. Yeah. You might be right feeling like it's got the makings of a video.

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       This is a, okay. So the person who made this just in case you didn't know is not chat if you're listening. Um, but they, they have, uh, they have, um, uh, a little screen. I can't even think of words. I'm an announcement at the top of the show of his videos that say I'm hosting this channel as an extremely controversial speaker. Ooh, that's what the, that's what it says before these videos play. And as a citizen, the U S I uphold the freedom of speech that our constitution provides says that freedom of speech is meant to protect unpopular speech. So this guy is really a free speech proponent when he's done his research. Yeah. It also says that the man has some mental difficulties. He might, well that's good to them. He says he might inadvertently offend or invite dismissal by being socially inept and to overlook it instead, investigate his claims and viewpoints for yourself. So it's just, no one's just an asshole anymore. I know. It's always like prefacing, it is like Patrick Ewing. Well, my finger hurts just in case I don't have a great game. I think there's a right, there's, there's um, so much here that I'm just going to jump through a few. Let's go. I just want to see what he's, what he's up to.

Speaker 13:         01:33:16       I could only graduate high school via a special program for problem students. I didn't go to college since Snow College could accommodate my needs. From there, I worked many jobs. Could only secure very low paying jobs. Half the time I couldn't even find work. Even the low paying job until my father stepped in for me. For example, one time my father gave my manager money for Christmas. One company hired me because my father's company was funding. There's a boss from another company hired me because it's trialed. Was enrolled at my father's daycare center. Oh, Katherine. My Dad retired from full time work. He told some security companies that if they hired me.

Speaker 1:          01:34:00       Okay. That's a lot. There's a lot. I like the cadence. It's a kind of Wisconsin eat cadence, right? Ooh, I don't know. I think it's more, uh, it sounds more Amish. You think so? Yeah. Like a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Oh, I thought it was more Midwest. Okay. I like that he talks like that. I like his background. I like his presentation. Let's see if he pushes any buttons. Suffering right now. I don't know if he pushes any buttons. Let's see.

Speaker 13:         01:34:27       Occasions of mystery and discrimination. Oh, for instance, I was fired for supposedly attaching and raising the American flag upside down on the flag pole, which I never do while he recent Muslim immigrant from another shift had the same job and it was likely to have done it.

Speaker 1:          01:34:47       Wow. Oh my muscles don't have to stress. That is a sign of distress. When you raise the flag upside down. It's a sign of distress. I learned that from a Robert Redford. Really?

Speaker 6:          01:34:58       Yeah. You remember the movie? Maybe it's something to do with castle. Ah, okay. Maybe it was just the castle, but it was also the guy from Sopranos. James Gandolfini. Yeah. Who was the prison warden. Anyways, but so I want to go back here. This guy has a manager and his dad has a company and a daycare that funds another company, but yeah, that and then he goes, but my dad's daycare.

Speaker 3:          01:35:19       Yeah. Maybe his dad had multiple, a lot of confusing shit going on.

Speaker 13:         01:35:23       Yep. The company I work at, the longest fellow employees kept purposely blowing big farts, which I had to smell and breathe.

Speaker 3:          01:35:33       There it is. So there it is. I knew I was going to like it. He might be talking about me. Yeah. What Jim does, he need to likeness.

Speaker 13:         01:35:44       I was working security at another job. I found a sweater of blood. It was a freak accidents where somebody collapse right in the middle of a tiny staircase, which I couldn't find in time. Therefore, they tried to blame me for trying to murder someone. Believe it or not.

Speaker 3:          01:36:01       So far. This guy's got your number blowing farts. Yup. Murdering people.

Speaker 6:          01:36:06       That's the first time he looked off the paper to just say, let's just raise his hands up. Can you believe this?

Speaker 3:          01:36:13       I have not murdered anyone. A blowout fights. Not. I haven't. Not yet. We got to ask him ride or die. Okay.

Speaker 13:         01:36:19       Oh, so for those who complained that I'm cheating the governor match McCain. You don't know anything. This, you didn't like me. You think? Oh judge others until I explain myself.

Speaker 3:          01:36:38       Today is a mental illness day. I know mom's mental health awareness last week. Oh, well, there you go. That's why we're doing this. That is it just a little late.

Speaker 6:          01:36:49       This guy should have to read everything because that keeps him calm. Yeah. And then my dad had my manager. Why are you doing that was so scary. Yeah, that's aggressive.

Speaker 3:          01:37:00       I liked it. Yeah. I like the why are you doing this? And I like the blowing farts part. Yup. He's hurt someone. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. He's done big farts. Yeah. Ghana. Yeah, man. It's a lot going on in that club. We're going to have to, yeah, a few more times. I feel like we're going to visit that again. It's a lot of it.

Speaker 13:         01:37:21       I accidentally overdosed. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:37:31       Ah, yeah. Wow. I accidentally overdosed. Yeah, that's a lot, huh? Yup. World is a special place.

Speaker 6:          01:37:40       It seems weird that that kind of guy would have a hammer hanging on his wall right by the door. Oh, you want to lead a pizza guy just holding the hammer weigh up. What do you think the justification is? Like if somebody goes, what's up with the swastika? Do you think he has? He probably has something like that. I go,

Speaker 5:          01:37:56       he goes, it's not the fucking hammer. What's up with the swastika? I'll show you don. I got get world map is where he's buried. People.

Speaker 1:          01:38:07       One of those guys who does the, uh, it's like the, you know, the old white guy who goes, how come I can't say the n word? They say it all the time and you're like, that's not how it works. He's a liquid that's there. They're like, it's perfectly logical. Other people are saying it. Why can I see it? It's always like a, and you go like, you, here's the thing. I don't have to tell you like, you know why? You know why you're not supposed to say it. You know what I mean? Like, but why can't we go? Yeah. You go like, why can't you go, ew, I you don't need the explanation. This is just like kind of a theatrical thing you're doing and it's the same guy who would be like, I have a swastika. And you're like, why would you do that? They're like, well, you know what, actually the symbol existed before the [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          01:38:48       So I am a of the belief that we should celebrate the old Egyptian interpretation of this Watson Native American. Yeah. Yeah. You're like, oh, so you overlook the people that kind of misused it. Exactly. Since then they've used it for other things. Yeah. Have you heard about this? Famous for just to be clear, I'm using it for something else. So be, be free to interpret it as you choose. Anyways, that's how I was feeling about the confederate flag. That's another one. It's all these guys are like, we shouldn't be, we shouldn't be given participation ribbons to kids and it's like, well that's what the fucking confederate flag is when that's a participation ribbon. That's true. And they keep it in their trucks with their nuts on the trucks. It's, yeah, it's nuts. Yeah. In California. Not In southern California. Yeah, true tread here, man. Oh, see so much fucking road Beave down in the Osi. I'm looking for road beef, man. It's just a lot of, then you got a text and it's a homeless. I'm just lazy.

Speaker 1:          01:39:57       Yeah. Um, I recently moved in with my grandmother who was an email with my grandmother after graduating college. I found myself in a great dilemma. I get up every morning and get ready for work and like any reasonable human being, I take a pre work poop 8:15 AM is my time just like the great top dog and I have found myself in a great deal of trouble. You've heard of pissing on the seats, I presume? Well, Hal about shitting on the seat. Yes. You read that, right? My grandmother shits on the seat every morning. Oh, and I don't know what to do. Is this a power play by her? Is this a way of communication? Should I leave her some brown as a message back? Anyway, Tommy and Tina, the real question is, should I become poop pals with my grandmother instead of pen pals with her piss on me, beat me, Yada Yada, Yada. Ding, Ding. You know the drill Jacob? I think your grandmother, I don't know where to begin is begging you to leave. Absolutely. She's just like, I was being

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       nice when I said you could come live with me. You piece of shit on the seat or not. I think it's right on the back of the seat. That's probably what's going on when people sit back too far. Yeah, exactly. And you know and it like skims all the way down. So like your shit is flat on her ass hole is probably on right by right now. Chad. I thought I heard it all. Yeah, we talk about Brown a lot on this show. Do I have never heard this tassel is probably right up against the back room dude. I never even thought because he blew my mind. It might be because of how old she is. She's sitting, you know one of those things, those workers, maybe a bad back legs. You don't know. And if you're not using the squatty potty [inaudible] sometimes it can curl up and go back.

Speaker 3:          01:41:37       But imagine you finding that shit every morning, every morning. Then you're like, God dammit, there's shit all over the seat. If that isn't motivation to get your own place, I dunno what is, yeah, that's going to be us. And 30, 40 years shitting on the love that you gave it that long. Do you think the next week you started sitting on seats, you will, I'll be like, fucking Tommy Shit on this thing. I know he's gonna put me in the home right away. It'd be like, no, I'll clean your shit. Ah, yeah, this is your new place. And I'm like, wow, do you like it here babe? I'm like, ah, that'd be nice to you. I'll be the guy who was like, go on another bath.

Speaker 6:          01:42:20       They give me another bath. I'm like, it's still dirty down here. My grandma had dementia and w I'd always go eat dinner with her when I was in town and a weight that was at a retirement center in Minnesota. Yeah. And so she would, uh, we ate one day and then they cleared the plates and she goes, when are we going to eat? And I go, don't you feel full? Let me, can't you like nothing. You know, I try, I try to understand, but for me, I'm like, we just fucking eight and then I go, we'll try to remember what you ate. Do you have any idea? And she was like, I don't, but I, I trust you. And then we wouldn't watch checks or Texas Walker Ranger or whatever that's called Walker, Texas. Yeah. And, uh, but 10 minutes later she goes, and she looked at me, she goes, Spaghetti.

Speaker 3:          01:43:01       No. I was like, well, what the fuck? That's pretty great. Yeah. She tasted it. I said, wow. That's how she remembers. She has to get it back up. Oh my gosh. Wow. That's actually a really sweet story. It is. Was there a long time ago?

Speaker 6:          01:43:15       Uh, yeah. Yeah. For four years ago. Not that long ago. She, is, she still with us? She's not Spaghetti Spaghetti's gone spaghetti got her. Do you have any other grandparents left? [inaudible] parents. I'm wiped out. Yeah. My mom. Your mom? Yeah. You close to her? Yeah, I live, uh, I dunno. Two miles away.

Speaker 3:          01:43:34       The are you serious? That's, that's kind of Nice. That's sweet. I see my parents twice a year.

Speaker 6:          01:43:40       Oh, you know what? We live 2,500 miles from me. I see my mom twice a year really to fucking miles and really well, I'm more than that, but not as much as I probably should. Yeah. But she's

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       retiring October 26 so she said, I'll be over for coffee every morning. And I was like, great. I'm moving. My Dad retiring December 3rd and we've talked about it a lot. I'm worried. I'm serious. He's been involved with stuff his whole life and he's like, next chapter, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm like, fuck, stop saying that. I don't know he's going to do. And I'm like, well, you go off. He's like, yeah, I'm not interested in anymore. Like you're fucking lost interest in golf. We you supposed to do now. Oh yeah. I don't know what he's going to do. That's not good. I know. He's like fishing. I go, you don't seem like the guy with the patients for fishing. Yeah. I'll get into it and then he goes fishing with like uh, my nephew next day. He was like, it was terrible. It's three hours after. I'm like three hours isn't even that long. I've seen this happen. You know where it ends? Where Spaghetti. Spaghetti. Yeah. Fuck.

Speaker 1:          01:44:46       I want him to get involved in something which we get. I don't know anything that's going to make those videos. Have my dad make bit, make some videos with stuff on the wall. I maybe I might have to get him more involved in the podcasts. Maybe like we talked about having him. Why don't we do movie reviews? We were talking about having to do it cause he loves to go to the movies. He told me the other day, he's like, you know what's a great movie? It's a movie that's out. And I go okay. And he's like, you can always tell it's a good movie cause your mother and I both liked it and I go, yeah, that's my criteria too. Like, as long as youtube both like it, then I know it's a good movie. He's convinced that other people will always line up with his perspective on movies.

Yeah. So it's like, where are you learning this? Well, we share iTunes and it's all your stove. Oh. So she gets to learns it on Ukulele and then, but the music she listens to, it's ridiculous.

Jesus, man, I think it's going to be crazy. I really do. I'm worried. I wish them both the best of luck. Why don't you have him come here and live with you guys. Let's see what else is going on. Uh, um, Chadwick was your birth name, right? Sure. Chattels Chattels Chattels Matthew. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:50:39       I can tell you anything about me cause I've had lifelock since I was, since it came out cause my dad stole my identity. He did? Yeah. So I was like, well if he's going to do with maybe a stranger, will you tell us the story please? He just a, I don't know. He, he needed a, so he went to prison for check fraud, all sorts of stuff. Yeah. I did not know any of this about you. Yeah. He went to prison and then, uh, then he took off to Los Vicky actually. So I bought a car. There was something wrong with the engine. They gave me a replacement car to drive. Then my dad made copies of the keys and when I got my car back, had me drive him to the dealership, stole that car and drove it to Las Vegas. Wow. What? Yeah. And my mom, I couldn't tell my mom any of that stuff. So she was like, I just want your kids to know it's not your fault. And I was lying.

Speaker 5:          01:51:26       Well, Kinda no shear. How old were you? I was, uh, probably 19 at the time. Did you, did you, what was your perspective on him then? Well, I just thought, you know, he's a fucking lunatic. You did? Yeah. So if he's going to la, he's like, I'm going to Las Vegas. Like, great. Yeah. That's horrible. But it's, uh, you know, uh, Chad, Steven Katz. Stephen Daniels. Yeah. Is that your dad's name? It is, yeah. My piece of shit. Huh? Pretty Great. I don't know why you're all over him. Yeah. What's your fucking problem?

Speaker 6:          01:52:10       Wow. Right. Just it's my dad. I loved him. You find it, cause my parents were kind of wacky too. As a parent. Did you, I don't know, like do you not know how to, what, what a good dad looks like cause you're just kind of shitty? No, I think I go from the opposite. I know what not to do. Does that make sense? Yeah. So I'm not always doing the right thing, but I, I was given a checklist of what not to do at the beginning, so that helps. Right. I looked at their birth certificate and I thought, well I'm never going to take this social security number, use it to my advantage. Right. Interesting.

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       Yeah. Yeah. I know you're talking about, cause I tried to get a phone and I tried to get just fuck, I went to get a car and the guy for financing and the guy was like, um, it says here you owe $40,000 in child support on your credit report. I was like, alright, how do you, how do you, you know, beat that? Like how do you overcome that? Like in real life? Like, what's, what's the process like when you go, oh, everyone thinks I'm somebody. Like I went through this phase of killing animals. I would, uh, pray over their body for their soul and like, thank you for that. Did that make your life terrible? Killing animals? No. Know What Your Dad did? No, not really. No. I mean it was a credit. I think Tom's asking, you know, you just have to call and say like, I was living with my mom the entire time.

Speaker 5:          01:53:42       I didn't have this apartment. I didn't have, don't they not believe you? They don't believe you, but so you just have to get the records. And which is it a hassle for you? A bit of a hassle. Sure. Yeah. My mom would take my, my social security number as a teenager, as I was like 15 years old and open credit lines, credit cards. One time I checked my credit accounts open that I didn't even, was it to build your credit though? No, there's so she could credit cards because my stepdad had ruined her credit because he was a criminal. Oh, can I, can I tell you something? Your mom stole your identity, you know that, right? Okay. No, I'm telling my therapist that justify it and I'm like, no, that's straight up theft. It's happened. It's a good therapist for your daddy issues or, uh, I ha when I went through my divorce, I saw a therapist and a minister, but I'm not religious, but it was just nice to, uh, to chat two times a week.

Speaker 5:          01:54:40       That's awesome. Yeah. I would go every day if I could have helped a ton because they have, you know, you're like, well, why do I think this and why do I think this? And then he draws a little diagram and you're like, oh, all right. That makes total sense. That helps a lot of shit. I thought I was a crazy person and I didn't want to be near my kids because it might hurt them. No, that's not true. But you, how long did you see them for? I probably saw all sudden done by two years. Wow. That's great. That's awesome. I feel much better. I do not. Sometimes I go now I'll go like once every four months cause I'll be like, ah, I'm fucking this, this thing sucks. Better call that guy and then I can't get in for 10 days and then I get there and I'm like, it's all fixed. So you want to grab lunch? Yeah. Yeah. I go every week. So. Okay. For uh, uh, to see a therapist. I mean for what? Let's talk about it. Just whatever's on my mind. I didn't have like a big jump off thing. I just feel my oil change. Right? Yeah. It feels like a d scrambling your mind.

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       So the way I feel like it, like you go in there like I'm all fucking fixated on this thing. And then sometimes like the person can just say two sentences to you and you're like, yeah, I should just chill the fuck out. You ever picked it or not?

Speaker 6:          01:55:57       Yeah. Forever. And the more it gets tighter and your fucking frustrated yeah. And then you just need that one person to go, you're pulling on the wrong side or whatever. It kind of feels like that.

Speaker 1:          01:56:06       Yeah. I'm a big, big fan of it. I really encourage people to go as often as possible. I'm trying to tell you to make more appointments and keep going. Yeah, I don't think I'm, I think I'm fucking fine. All right. Go See Christina. Do stand ups now we're talking Plugin Christina's act. Cool. It's really neat
