Speaker 6:          00:05:59       Rihanna, I guarantee you we talked about this thing. She didn't write those lyrics that was written by a fat old music producer record guy. The record labels like, you know what? You should do a song about fucking you soul mate. I've always wanted to fuck you. One second. I saw you. I saw those thin light chocolate frame. Then I wanted to break it in half and you're going to sing a song about how great it is to fucking cause there's no woman is like, I'm going to write a song called sex with me is so amazing.

Women don'ts and also like it's clunky. She's like stay above my Instagram. There's so temptation.

Speaker 7:          00:08:29       and pawn was his hype man and Paul would always wanna use my cell phone and I'll be like, I got a call radio, I've got to call retail and we'd have like $60 relative. He was like $60 to eat with two fattenings per diem. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:08:55       Christina visits in person. Yeah. Ooh,

Speaker 1:          00:09:36       big words for him. I want to use those big words at that station very casually to like, he always says that you recognize Steve Lubell here? No, he was on an episode of millionaire matchmaker. What was he talking like? This? Yeah, he was mad show, yeah. Member. And she was like, okay, what is your deal more? He's a manager. Um, what's the lot of big hip hop acts? He's been around for, you know, probably 30 years. Right. And so he picks up the expectations of the rappers and what he's like in New York. You know, dude from just a black guy. Yeah. Yeah. He's just, he's just this other black guy with the wrong fucking skin tone. Um, and upon was his hype man. And Paul would always want to use my cell phone and I'll be like, I got a call radio, I got a call retail and we'd have like $60 relative.

Speaker 1:          00:10:24       He was like $60 to eat with two fattening per diem. Yeah. And, and wait, who's into, he was interviewing. It doesn't sound like a black guy, right? Well, yeah. Well they get into it actually, you know, and the, the, the big words and words are actually big this weekend because Larry Wilmore, the host of the, the nightly show on comedy central, he did the White House correspondence dinner, you know, a set where you go up and you basically light the, you know, the journalists, sometimes the administration on fire. He crushed it. I mean, he was just, he was no holds barred. Just lighting it up in that room was not into it. They didn't have, like you said, one time I did a set at the journalism awards here in Los Angeles and I have never eaten shit harder. I mean, and I, this was like two or three years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:11:12       So I've been doing standup for a minute. Yeah. And events like that are very difficult. I mean, they dropped the dessert just as I was going on, but I would have eaten shit otherwise there are real nerds at this, a dinner, you know? Yeah. And the thing is that, that's a room full of like real world leads. Yeah. Not just the press. Right. But that's usually, it has their senators. There's, you know, it's like the hosting the Oscars. It's just like super elite people who take themselves too seriously. And when you have someone like Wilmore who is digging into you really, really lighting people up, there you go. This isn't poor taste because if they don't feel like it's nice, you know, um, and they get their feelings hurt. But, but he ended, I mean, let me see if I can pull up, tie this all together. He ended, um, thank you mister president. When I met Larry Wilmore earlier this month, he told me it's his dream come true to follow the president at the White House for a spot

Speaker 7:          00:12:09       president. That doesn't make sense here and now to live in your time, Mr. Prince. This is how we ended the son. A black man can lead the entire free world.

Speaker 4:          00:12:21       [inaudible] when they pan to the people that are black. Yeah, they always did it.

Speaker 7:          00:12:38       Words alone do me no justice. Um, so Mr President, I'm going to keep it a hundred. You'll bury. You did it my Nigga.

Speaker 4:          00:12:53       Oh, why you liked it? Obama laughed. It's cool.

Speaker 1:          00:12:58       There was backlash even from a lot of people, a lot of black people. Oh, it fell, it was very disrespectful to say that to the president of United shore anyways. I didn't, I mean I'm white, but I didn't know, but I, cause I thought it was, it was done with a lot of affection. I thought he, you know, it wasn't, I mean I realize you're saying it to the president, but, right. But as with everything in comedy, I think the intent is really what counts as a black man saying it to another black man. And he wasn't saying it the way that other guy, I like the way. So let's go back to, yeah, that's a different, totally different. Um, Steve Lowe Bell. Uh, if I'm saying, Oh, I thought that guy was the guy that the body guard from a,

Speaker 7:          00:13:36       no, we found the kid man. 50. I feel like money

Speaker 1:          00:13:39       guys. Steve Wilkos, uh, Steve Wilkos looks a little bit about Kevin's hill. Here. We got it. Why do people stress? Look at the president ain't sweating the n bomb then who cares? He was the one and only matters to make him the president took it that way. That this is coming from a place of affection. Oh. And a comedian too. We didn't hire median, but whatever, people have the right to be forever. But this is, this is different. This is a little different here. So he's still, he's doing the interview here and he just Kinda keeps going.

Speaker 7:          00:14:09       No, we found a kid, man. I made a record with 50. I feel like money buzzing. Buzzing. So that's been in la getting niggas jewelry bag, holding niggas down, discovering people, consultant people, helping people in those real top. You see it today, laugh after

Speaker 1:          00:14:23       they're like, okay, okay. I don't know how I'd feel to hearing him say that stuff when I got to be like, what? Wait. Can we pause on this? Uh, yeah. He's, he keeps rolling. Hilly. It's no big deal. I just dropping bombs like his normal God. Yeah. Yeah. He's really good at dropping the lender Nigga a pencil. Right. So He um, he continues, I think they must have obviously at some point asked him like, what is up with you doing this, you know, or why are you so part of the community? Right. Well I think the thing is that he considers them, but it's a good point. I think he does consider himself part of that community. I don't think he thinks that he's not, but I don't think you're, you're allowed really in until you meet a certain criteria in which is being black. Well that would be the thought of a lot of people, but not this guy.

Speaker 7:          00:15:17       They just know you as like little CV. Right? If you were in New York person, like this is the problem. I live in La, right. And Ami Girls. And they be like, why do you act like Dan? Why do you talk like that and dress like that? Like you must have never been in New York doing because the white are just like me and he'd probably got tats and fight, go to Riker's on all that. Well I remember I told you this.

Speaker 1:          00:15:38       I Dunno. I mean, he's just, he's saying like this fucking guy. I love when white people try to sweat the plight the same way black people haven't like no dude, no bro, trust me, you're still not a Hee Hee Hee. You're causing yourself problems at this point. You know also implying that uh, white people from New York or like black people, they go to jail a lot. That's what he just said. Five minutes on Rikers island and then that guy, this is what it must be when he defended his use of it. Right. So here it goes.

Speaker 7:          00:16:14       I'll walk into a room your way. People, Russell, Russell Simmons. So what's up my Nigga in the, like Russell, he's, he's wife Joe. Just so you know how to explain that some Nigga doesn't mean a black person to me and is a slave. Does Mexican slaves, Jewish slaves, black slaves, white sleeves. I grew up, Nigga, Nigga, Nigga. That's my Nigga in La. Once a blood dude said to me, Yo, you said that word. And I was around sugar at the time and I was in the studio without laws and stuff. It was a lot of guns. It was a lot of craziness because a lot of executives who are white, they don't want to be around the Hennessy to guns and the dogs. They don't be on the tour buses. They just want to come around to the certain things and take the credit after the fact and he's like, Yo, you need to go to bank. No, you owe me 15,000 saying, Nigga, my Nigga, you're going to kill me right now. And no one extorting me white niggers.

Speaker 1:          00:16:58       So yeah. Do you think there's a reason that the white executives don't come around when there's guns and Hennessy involved? He obviously wants to be there for that. That's what I like. Maybe it's not a white thing name. It's just a thing that the person wants to stay alive. It doesn't hang out with Shugg and those people. No sugars. It is a death sentence. I want to die, hang out with Shugg night, even in prison and be like, don't hang out with that dude. We're not going to be bros.

Speaker 7:          00:17:26       I've seen a lot of white there in my time,

Speaker 1:          00:17:28       this guy. But I love when he's trying to convince them like I can use the word because Russell Simmons said it to me once and I want to be, and then all of you were, you know, quite a big words. I just, I just kills me when you're born a white guy, which is like top of the food chain in America. Big words. Yeah. Motherfucker like you're at the top. Why? What are you doing? You have it pretty dumb prick. Just be a white guy. I enjoy it. Stopped feeling guilty and weird about it. You won the cosmic lottery asshole, the easiest position and you're making life hard for, you know, saying I used to comb it. I liked it when the, he says that this is still again cause he goes, he says he's hanging out in that studio and some blood. So some gang banger from and go to the bank and get me $15,000 for saying that word.

Speaker 1:          00:18:27       Right. And then in his version of the story, he says it again to that guy. Do you understand? Yes. So his, his version of a dude who just a gang member who was just like, go to the bank and get me money is that he told that guy you're going to have to extort me. But he used the word, but I'm going to say it again. It's all buses. They just want to come around. Does he owe me 15,000 San Diego? So my Nigga, you gonna kill it right in my, so the guy just said, hey man, you can't stay. They go get me money and that I'm going to respond. I'm saying, Nigga, I'll send my Nigga, you're going to kill me right now. And no one extorting me. You didn't see it did not.

Speaker 1:          00:19:08       Steve will goes to not say that Steve Wilkos was with Jerry Springer every day. He would never, he was too busy gardening such a psycho ridiculous shift from that guy. But I'll finish off, finish the yard, done. Uh, but to, to the further the point of Larry Wilmore, I think people, most people, I think we're pretty okay with it, you know? Yeah, yeah. With him saying it's comedian, like whenever you hire a comedian to do a job, don't get offended. I'm just a comedian. But I think more than a comedian, it's a black man saying it to another blend. Different, different, same strokes for everybody. We all finished. Are Y'all done? Yeah, he sounds like he's going to cry. It is really worth getting clowned. So hard. So hard spec on my name that I could hear the tremble in the voice. Put some respect on my name. He's going to cry.

Speaker 1:          00:20:02       It is my favorite thing of the last few months. We've been saying this for the last week now and that run in the house. It's great. We all are. We all finished? Are Y'all done? We're done. Um, the Hamiltones man, y'all finish. Y'All done? Uh, you know, uh, what's it called? The occupier loans. Yeah. These guys are on the tour bus and they just like improvise a, a song based on that interview. It's amazing. It's amazing. These guys just on binary or non binding. These guys I think are binary. Yeah. What'd you do? My hair just went out. Yup. Yup. What's going on? We're good. We're back. Okay. Oh, guys are binary. These are buying. I don't, I only listened to nonbinary means, okay, this will be a challenge for you.

Speaker 8:          00:20:57       I want you to bloody out Australia. Don't listen when you say my name on it. I ain't gonna say it. And I will say no. Listen, I'm going to pull it up, but that ain't no, I'll be finished tree on it and I will say no.

Speaker 6:          00:21:42       Unbelievable. That's amazing. Wow. They were so good. That was so good. I thought that was Hugh more for a second. Yeah. Right. And it looks like him. I haven't seen that guy around.

Speaker 1:          00:21:54       I don't see that in a minute, but he's hilarious. Yeah. That's so good, man. Wow.

Speaker 6:          00:21:59       Put his bag, man. Put some respect on my name. He is going to cry like a bitch. What do you think his wig his room like? Correct. I hope he gets a window. You saying that we care about how is he gonna come in here now and I didn't expect my Mac.

Speaker 1:          00:22:17       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:22:18       Bitch SPEC. It isn't gonna roll in here with seven to his homies and your mom's done came in into your mouth. She could have came up to the cabinet stove thanks to oh no. Yo House, Christina. Bulimics key.

How do you recover from it? That's become like an internet. He's worth $150 million. Yeah, he's fine. He's fine. He's not gonna. He'll be chilling. Oh, why bother? I think that get, what gets me is that he bothered to come in to the radio show and then he didn't have, there's also a level of of what he did that even though there's no direct threat, there's a perceived threat and then that's what he's company. He knows that when he looked at, well, he was walking out of there, that those people were at least like Jesus. Oh, right. And that's, and then you could tell even Charlemagne afterwards, like, you know what, I'm good at. Charlemagne. I don't need any more. Uh, I don't need to interview him again. We're all good. Everything's good. It's, it's a way to say like, I'm not fucking with you. All right. Right. Like we're good man. No, Charlemagne, you mean the medieval King Charlemagne, right. I meant the God that was sitting at the breakfast club. Oh, okay. Charlemagne,

Speaker 6:          00:23:46       yeah. Not As unconquered. Right hand. Different guide from the medieval renaissance period. South Carolina born and got you. Yep. Okay. Anyways, so fucking jacked up, dude. It's been a great week. Um, we got a lot of positive feedback on, um, uh, Tom and I discussing the shower that we took together. There's been multiple showers before and after now, but I was at the store and I'm red band came up to me and was like, oh, what a great episode. He goes, but I have to ask you, are you serious? When you say that Tom Spreads his butt cheeks and puts it up against the water. And I'm like, yeah, no, that's a real move. And then my friend Eric texted me the same thing. Like, wow, that is a bear marking his territory. It sounds like he's trying to dominate you. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:24:39       Which by the way, I'm used to it being your word. I'd never heard that. No, it's not a real, it's a talking a loogie and I know that. So don't fucking email me and tell me what I'm doing wrong. I say it's hawking. It just sounds, that's a better word for me. That one makes me want to vomit and Snowdonia snot rockets. Not Ross. It's really nice in your beard. And then I peed on us. That's, but that's so standard issue. I thought that was what everybody in any relationship. Well Brian, when his friend who's name I can't remember, sorry, but she, she was saying that, is that true that he pees on Youtube? I go, yeah man, is it that crazy? And she's like, I've never been pinned on. I'm like, won't come over to my House, my pee on you two lady. I feel like that standard issue in a really thought that was, I thought that everybody does everyone, but actually you're the first boyfriend that ever peed on me in the shower, so I wasn't dating savages know you were dating some nonbinary people.

Speaker 6:          00:25:39       Can I tell you that? But before I dated you, I was the man. Like people thought I was gross. Like all my boyfriends would have to tell me to stop picking my nose, stop farting and burping like my last boyfriend before you. Zero tolerance, zero tolerance for it towards the end to really fucking hated it when I wake her up and fall. When someone doesn't love you anymore and you're burping and farting, you think that she goes over? No. Oh my God, you guys are so disgusting. You're lucky. I love you as much. But you set the bar so low for disgusting behavior low or has a high high that I never have to strive Trump to grocer.

Speaker 6:          00:26:21       Are you really asking me that question? Yeah, no, I know. I know. I know, I know. I totally know. Do you know how disgusting you are? Not really. I just feel like it's normal. When we started dating, you had no soap in your shower and shampoo and you use that on everywhere. Just everything. But you can use shampoo. Suds is soap. Why can you not? You can. Most people choose not to. What am I do go to the store. Buy Soap too. Most people do. No, that's fine. Did you, when I asked you to buy soap in your shower, were you blown away or are you like this bitch? I was just like, I don't understand why you're not using all the shampoo I got.

Speaker 6:          00:27:11       I got all the shampoo and the best part is to like the cap was loose on that shampoo bottle, so water would go into it and dilute it. So it was like, but that memory can last longer. You get more, more shampoo, more soap. I'm really going to get my ass wax. I've been talking to you about a savage I know or maybe lasered, right? Didn't we talk about that? Cause I don't do either to my junks I would say go for laser. Why not? Why? Why keep going back to get it waxed? Like just bite the bullet and just really had some breakthroughs, you know, thinking about how much more of my life I could get back with it. And it's talking about asshole. Well I just feel like there's just so much time spent and people have told me, you know they waxed their asses and it's like one wife to wipes. They're done. That's when my world is something now at the big day it's even less. Yeah. Well I sit there now. Oh Shit. Hit the bid day on. You didn't, you didn't hit the button. Nobody knows what's what segment that says Oh yeah. Fused and like what's going on.

Speaker 4:          00:28:14       Right.

Speaker 6:          00:28:24       You look like booker at the belching contests right now. You're so proud of yourself. So sorry, let's go back to the topic. Yeah. Now I just, I hit the water and I just let that spray sit there but I'll let it spray for a minute. I hear you. I know. Yeah. No, I literally hear you and living room cause that turtle it, I can hear what happens in there. That's what it really neat blessing in all our homes is that I've always been in close proximity to where you shit so I can hear everything. You hear the bedroom one? No, no, just that downstairs. The downstairs one. Yeah. So I hear the water going for a long time. Yeah. And then you always come out and you go, whew. And then and then when I ignore you, you go, you're not going to ask me. You're going to, you're not going to ask me. And I go, how is your shit? You say the same kind of thing to me though. You'll be like, I don't want, you want to know what happened? And you play coy.

Speaker 6:          00:29:22       Oops. You're wearing your oopsies around the house to they with mood nannies here. Those fell down. Oopsies I don't think so. She wants to Skygen Bald. She goes, what? I'm serious though. Gee, do you really want to get your ass wax? Are you being serious? Being serious? Because I've been thinking about seriously how much time I spend or like when I'm not home. Oh my God, I'm not home and fucking, I mean like, you know, public airport got disaster, man. Just mad in there and it gets into the hand and your smear, when you wipe, you're smashing it into the Harris. So gross it as though the hairy ass. What does the hair for? Why does it even grow them? I don't know. Because the women don't have hair. I mean some I don't. Yeah, but for you, if you're a hunter to gather and you're out in the wilderness, you got to cover your asshole like naked humans.

Speaker 6:          00:30:19       I'm saying primitive man who was out hunting and gathering. Women don't need it because we're with the babies and the cave. But you're out there with leopards chasing you. You could sit down on a rock and a snake could crawl right up your ass and lay eggs. This is probably to cover. Okay, so this is, this is a real explanation I'm offering. Know I saw this on Nat Geo. Why does Tom Cigarettes asshole have hair on the next episode? Well, I'm going to go reverse. I think you should. So is your butthole hair like your beard because at that full the whole hair isn't so crazy. It's the inside the crack. She cared. You know like the cheeks aren't that Harry when it's like you spread the sheikhs and I've seen it. Forest. Yeah, you've seen it. Well everyone's like it's a nice, isn't that it's hot.

Speaker 6:          00:31:09       It's so hot as anything. I've heard that it really makes it a lot less hot. Sexy, high. I know it's going to stay sexy, but temperature was well cause when we did Nikki glazers show not safe and we're talking about pegging and she's like, do you even put your finger up there? And I'm like, so hot is hot and steamy and hairy and scary. It's a gross place. Had a lot of diarrhea today and you really did. The nice thing about diarrhea with that per day is that you hit that water and you go with paper later. There's nothing left. There's nothing there. I know, cause I had some loose ones too. I say I have a, I had like, I have like a five. Yeah. The day cleans it right up. You was you as total seven. I had about a 6.5649999999999995. It was pretty bad. It was pretty much blew. Really loose, loose meat sandwich all the way. Yeah. It kind of made you sit there and go, you know, I just liked, I just liked playing that come in those balls. Why am I so low? I feel like I'm a child and you're an adult. Go. You are so gross and you'd grow up. Shut up. I grow. When I look at you, I throw up. You just want to fuck me and then go to your mom's house.

Speaker 1:          00:32:42       Wow. She sounds binary though. She does. They, I prefer prefer them to be non binary. I only watched nonbinary pornography, so anyway. Yeah, a lot of positive feedback on your, on the shower that we took together. You and I took a little time together this week and we went to the Getty Museum and that was nice to spend time with you like that. We never really get to do things like that. I know it was a, it was thoroughly enjoyable. We just walked around the Getty. If you ever come to Los Angeles and you want, you know, cities have their leave their mark right with their cultural stamp of hey we, you know, we invest in, in making these arts destination. Yeah. Yeah. And the Getty is really impressive. There's actually two Getty's in La. The more prominent one is right off the four oh five and it's massive multibillion dollar museum that has gardens and you know, as it's one of the world's great art museums.

Speaker 1:          00:33:53       It does have food if you want to eat while you're at the museum. I mean, the leading thing that they, that they promote is their food, but it also has [inaudible] and you can get one. Yeah, you can get wine, coffee, you can get coffee and you can go to the bathroom. And then, um, which is really pretty, or you can see they're world class art sculptures, paintings, just they have a rotating works of art. They had a photography exhibit that we saw, a photography, photography and they have pictures there, pitchers and pitchers that a photographer took and they're framed and hanging on the wall. How many people say photographer constantly. I hear it all the time. I heard my sister when she was out here say x specially really hit it hard. You know what I mean? Like especially, especially, yeah, she does. I've heard of those.

Speaker 1:          00:34:43       I just let it go. K Express. Okay. Hitler. Uh, but I love the Getty. We saw Robert Maplethorpe exhibit the explain for Koller explain who that is. So Mabel Thorpe was the photographer, photographer, famous in the late seventies, eighties took portraits of famous people, most notably like Patti Smith for the cover of horses, which is a huge album. And the, and, and, and then he took other types of photos. Yeah. Well, you know, he was, uh, he was pretty binary and he was actually by, for a while. Patty Smith is a woman. And then later he decided, he was like, Nah, I like the other stuff more. And then he died of Lecia. But, um, but some of those photographs or, uh, provocative, Ooh. Say for instance, there was one where you walk into a room at the Getty and then you see just kind of torso, mid torso down. Um, a man in a suit, but it's flies open and you won't believe what's hanging out of his fly.

Speaker 1:          00:35:55       It's a massive, I would say semi erect. Right. Lack on circumcise. Mm. And uh, yeah, if everyone's just walking around salivating and you know, trying to put their saliva back in their mouth. But there was some provocative photos but you pointed out to me that his most controversial and provocative photos, we're not in the know and I'm a little disappointed in the Getty that they didn't Kinda, they didn't go go there. Yeah. They one JV squad. Yeah. Cause I worked at a bookstore in the 90s when I was in college and if you wanted to see Maplethorpe's books, the book of work, you had to show id that you were over 18 and it was behind the counter. Yeah. And immediately off. Right then you couldn't drop off right there. You had to buy it and take it home. Yeah. But I remember being like whatever this book is, I'm on board cause no one, the anarchist cookbook was behind the counter and I'm able for book and those are my two favorite books.

Speaker 1:          00:36:53       When I worked at the bookstore in Woodland Hills. Yeah. And uh, so Mabel Thorpe, I don't know if you want to Google image search, just show the people. Okay. I can't show it on, I'm on Youtube is going to get flagged. Google Thorp and just look at the treasures. Yeah. Maplethorpe Maplethorpe's m a. P. P. L. E. T. H. O. R. P. E. Yeah. Robert. You might have to start, you don't have to, you'll see some like naked people. You're like, that's it. No, it gets, it gets better. Yeah. Keep digging. Yeah, keep going. I've seen naked people maybe not like this. You haven't special. Yeah. Uh, yeah, but I was disappointed that they didn't go full maple for upon it. Yeah. I mean that's kind of what people want to see. Right. If you want to know where's the com, it should have been at the Maple Thorp exhibit. They really should have been. And they, they dropped the ball on that for sure. But we saw all somewhere standing. Yes. It's, you have to take a tram to get to the Getty and you park down below and they take you up a hill. It's really alive. That's the Maple Thorp exhibit o

Speaker 9:          00:37:58       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:00       I should have been playing the audio part of the installation. Right. He's sure. Yeah. As you walk, you shouldn't play this. Yeah. Yeah. Why did they do an audio component? Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:38:18       Come on.

Speaker 1:          00:38:19       That's art. Yeah, it's good. Yes sir. That's art. Um,

Speaker 9:          00:38:24       stone sheep.

Speaker 1:          00:38:27       Go ahead. So we're waiting in line to get on the tram and we saw a little 20 year old girls and it's funny cause, yeah, there,

Speaker 6:          00:38:36       and it was a cold day in la. You get to wear a sweater or jacket. It was cold

Speaker 1:          00:38:39       and people don't understand. I think that live in other parts of the country that it does get, you know, brisk. Yeah. Uncertain days, you know, it'll be, you might be used to it if you live in a really cold city, but it's, it gets to the point where people wear jackets.

Speaker 6:          00:38:54       Well, especially when we were in the, in the mountains there the wind blows and blows and you know, it's cold as fuck. But there's always young girls shivering in La. Horrors are always cold no matter what whores get cold because it's more important to them for you to know that they're whores, they're sexy. Warm. Yeah. Yeah. And they're addressed like horrors. Yeah. And I'm like, why the Getty? You got to address it. But I guess maybe the Maple Thorp Exhibit, they went to go see Dicks, but um, but yeah, I dunno. I don't think those girls were looking for those now. No. What were they looking for it? I don't know. But they definitely, they're shivering a little chickens in line put in work to be a whore. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Once I drink, that's a universal truth, man. Whores are always cold. Always cold. Yeah. Especially, I remember when I did Indianapolis, I did a crackers in broad, broad ripple once, when winter and it's cold and it's, yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:39:49       Oh yeah. And it's in that bar area where all the kids are. Yeah. And I just a stack of horse around the corner, just all, and it's snowing outside. Crazy. It is not a joke. You see it any, if you go Friday, Saturday out in any city, yeah. You'll always see those cold hookers walking around. I know. And the, the heels you got to where you're hitting your hooker heels and you gotta be cold and Chevrons. Airports. Yeah. Oh, he's wearing like eight inch stilettos and your leg, not the fly, right? Yeah. In the morning. I know the morning flight and you appreciate the effort. You're like you're a hardworking hooker. But yeah. You know, uh, you don't have to do this for a flight. No. Okay. Comfortable. Yeah. Get countable bitch yet. And then the tight clothes you're wearing this to, to sit, to sit uncomfortably on this flight. So fucking weird. And then you land and it's still fucking early wherever we went. And like you don't have to look like this til tonight, right, man, I dunno how much you suck sucking it at the airport, you know, stuck at the airport, given a little suck, suck at the airport, you know, it doesn't matter. We, we can't get away from it.

Speaker 1:          00:40:50       And, um, it's, it's obviously, you know, the show's gotten more popular. We know that. Um, but it's taken on a life of its own and places you don't even expect it to, to get picked up here is, um, Rick Ross. Nope. But I did go to high school with him for a year. Yeah. Yeah. For a year. He's got a really full beard. I like that. He does. He almost had that when he was in seventh grade. No Shit. And one of those dudes sound yeah. His Dad a famous baseball player. No kidding. Yeah. Prints

Speaker 10:         00:41:25       the older Hitler so far today Yoder, Hitler, Hitler, Hitler, Hitler. Hitler.

Speaker 1:          00:41:35       Hmm. I like that blue van and do that. Oh, that was like, it was really funny. Yeah. Yeah. So there you go. And Prince fielder. Wow. I didn't know he was an anti Semite to well that, I think the announcer was making it clear what he was, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:41:53       Very good.

Speaker 1:          00:41:59       Yeah. Yup. It's there, man. It's out there. It's out there. Um, another fun thing we saw at the Getty was the guy in line two, we are awaiting, oh my God, isn't this not your favorite guy who's got the horseshoe balding pattern and it's all gray. It's all gray. Yeah. He's a total dad. 50 some years old. It's still kind of trying to keep it cool. He was wearing his chuck Taylors right? No faded. The Light Blue Denim is light blue denim was on his dad jeans. Did he have belt on? A Brown braided? I'm not sure. He had an untucked shirt, a button down so you couldn't see his belt. I remember. Okay. And then, um, you know, he had his, his, his vision is not so good. He has glasses like dads do, eh, I can't see this art. And then he, um, yeah, he had Sasha with her, with him.

Speaker 1:          00:42:46       Uh, she was at least 20, if not 30 years younger than yeah. Way Out of his league. Looks White. Yeah. Just way out of his league. And you could just have a lot in common. Well, that's the thing when, you know, I've seen Carl with so many girls and he's just, he, him and Sasha together, they're just, it's like, you know, they're meant to be, you can't even tell that there's an age difference. Like when you hang out with them and you kind of, you go, I mean, they might as well be the same age because he really comes alive when he's with her. And I've just never seen him so happy and it's just fun to see him finally find the girl that's perfect for him. So crazy. Right. It's fucking the weirdest. You think he's not embarrassed. They should be embarrassed, but they're not.

Speaker 1:          00:43:39       And you're like, oh, I know. And the embarrassed what he's like, Eh, he probably walked right that she was totally like, she has a little bit of like, hmm. Yeah, he started, he had a, he's a venture capitalist and things kind of worked out so it worked out with us too. So we should point out that they were like kissing. Yeah. Modeling and doing odd of PTA. The whole like, I'm wrestling in India. Yeah. You're like, what in the fuck? And he was probably, do you like the getting, she was like, what's that? Yeah, but oh, by the way, the other Getty is, I'm in Malibu and it's uh, it's not as well known. It's phenomenal. It was a private residence. It's this, uh, what is it, John Paul Getty. Um, what's that, that architectural style though, bro? Co Roman Roman style? I don't know. I don't, I have never been to that one in the, in the Malibu Roman.

Speaker 1:          00:44:31       It's a, it's a multimillion dollar. Very impressive. And they have a lot. You could buy it from me and they have all the Arthur you could buy the art for me too. I'll do that. I'll just take out a loan. I'll do that for you. You probably take out like, I don't know, $500 million loan. Do you think your, will you take your second wife to the Getty? Um, when you get your Sasha, when you done me and then you, you have great to your 20 year old. I'll go, you like the gay, she'd be like, yeah, it did. He just do a song with Rihanna. I was like, this is a different guy. She was like, I'll check them out and then we'll go. Then all of us, it's art. Why? Because people make art. Ah, that's nice. I have that. That's pretty expensive when you buy it. I think it's for sale. I think that, can I have it daddy? I want to catch it. Whatever you want. So retarded. Yeah. I think my dad's had a few of those. Oh my God. For sure. That's probably why I'd notice it cause I'm like, I don't, there's, my dad has definitely. Why you notice it here it goes, is 20 year old girlfriend. Um, by the way, do you remember one of the biggest, um, shows we've ever had was a Miami fart machine? No, it was, where is it? It was a foreign

Speaker 11:         00:46:07       Barnett's voice in the conversation or nearly free, Ya know,

Speaker 1:          00:46:15       for, Ya know. So, and there was no, there's basically no indication of how things happened, you know? Um, I mean, so listen to, uh, let's see if we can get for free year now for free. You're now free young. Now. Don't play it my mommy phones. Okay, go. Okay. Sex with me. So amazing.

Speaker 11:         00:46:40       Deseret. And people are free to believe whatever they read, but you know, I mean clearly what I've been going through, I know it's not psychogenic as lie. I hope by now you've probably noticed Jennings spoke with a foreign accent that she'd never had before. I'm from Ohio. I should not be talking like this. There's no way a flu shot can cause someone's accent to change. Absolutely not one more. She's claiming a flu shot. Horseshit. Notice when inside edition first approached Jennings in this parking lot, she seemed to be walking normally, but after their interview, she walks to her car sideways saying it was Dystonia when kcal nine

Speaker 1:          00:47:20       news. Isn't that the best thing you've ever seen? Walking sideways. And she was like a flu shot. Flu shot there. They still buy. Wow. That was really good. That was, I got my flu shot and I told him, oh, okay. Out of it. Totally not gaze. What a lying liar. Fucking liar. Liar pants lie a little slut. I think it is a little slut. You're such a fucking, uh, I think it is big as well. Just put your fucking high heels on slide. She needs, she's wearing way too many clothes for them. Sluts. Gotta wear horror it up a little. Take off that jacket. Show us your arms man. Um, foreign accent. Speaking of foreign accents, how not to actually, this is a, a reporter and as a master of actions. I really appreciate this.

Um, so it's been a minute and um, it's definitely one of the most important segments we do on this show. Let's bring it to you right now with a new introductory. So, wow.

Speaker 8:          01:02:06       Here we go.

Speaker 11:         01:02:15       Well, I get to take on our original dental update music.

Speaker 6:          01:02:20       It's called lost them shit by the ducts. You can hear like the influence of the original, take her to the ticker type thing. Um, do you have a dental updates? I have a couple. Yeah. Um, personally I'm really slacking on a couple things. It's hot. My flossing has not been as good lately and I really need to white. And again, I have my trays. Dude, I tell you to whitening. Every time I see you smile, I go, look at those yellow

Speaker 1:          01:02:54       lottery, your sex. Can I tell you every fucking time I see you smile to hug that the meanest thing somebody could say to their spouse, I'm trying to help. You're the worst. So look how white my day that I'm going to, I want to talk about tonight. Let's do it tonight. Yeah, I'll help you, but we know where your trays are. I got them in the closet. Yeah, you guys do it, dude. Seriously, it's going to burn like hell but really it hurts so bad but you look so pretty. All right. Hello mommies. I am currently sitting in the parking lot of the dentist's office after my first visit and over 13 years. I lied to the dentist, told him it'd been five years because I could not bring myself to admit to him. Should have been over a decade after my first visit. After my visit.

Speaker 1:          01:03:43       You were the first people I wanted to share this news with much like my actual mother. I'm sure you are quite disappointed to hear that one of your own head ignored their oral health for so long, but good news. There is nothing to worry about. After 13 years I am cavity fruit loud. Never had one in my life and didn't require anything beyond a standard cleaning. I'm not sure if I dodged a bullet and this will put me back on the right track to proper dental care or if I just reinforce my terrible behavior now that I know it can avoid the dentist for a third of my life and still be just fine. Only time will tell. Although my dental care may fall behind, my genes will always stay high and tight. We're too your mom, Bridget. Uh, that was just, I mean that is, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:33       Bridget, here's, here's what I'm going to say. You did dodge a bullet and I'm guessing you're, I so I think so, but you can't do this stuff when you're older. That's the problem is when you get into your forties and 50s. She's in her thirties. But, but yeah, as you get older it will get more serious and I would consider myself just lucky on that one. If, if I was her, uh, we got another one. Let's see. Hey, Mommy's, I finally went to the dentist for the first time in 10 years. Last week guys. Boy was this embarrassing. After 26 years, I still have a baby tooth. The original adult tooth group backwards into the Palette of my mouth and was removed the last time I saw a dentist 10 years ago along with my five wisdom teeth and it's falling apart. Along with that, one of my showing teeth right up front is broken in Hass slant ways.

Speaker 1:          01:05:20       That's what I had and seven small cavities throughout the rest of my mouth. Oh, Holy Shit. Right. My dentist literally gave me a d plus grade, so the fillings are covered by insurance, but to get the crowns it's like $900 a tooth. Can have the tube teeth pulled and get what's called a flipper tooth. Just in case you don't know what that is is basically a retainer. Yeah. My cousin, he's attached to it. That's going to run me about 450 bucks. I basically want to know mommies. What should I do? What my Mommy's would do? Sorry. I know Christina has always said, put yourself in debt for your tea fees. We already, we are already paying an $8,000 hospital bill from 10 years ago. What do I do? Jeans machine. How expensive is it to repair? A crown. I need help Mei, the tutes be strong with you. The Nessa. I'll tell you first of all, don't have laid fixing those crowns are expensive. Here's what you should do if you can't afford it, if you can't open up a line of credit, ask for care credit. I believe it's, it's a form of dental credit. Your dentist's office may have that.

Speaker 1:          01:06:30       Go to a dental school. Are you near a major city? I recommend where near Ucla go to UCLA and go to a dental student. They can do it for a fraction of the cost and you know the work will be overlooked by whatever dentists and such a that don't go cheap. I don't, don't get the flipper. I it looks like shit. My cousin has a flipper tooth with their retainer. I don't think she hasn't anymore. Oh No, I didn't think she, I think she got replaced, but it, it looks like it looks doesn't belong there. So you know what I read it. Recommend to me if you're paying off at that, you said you don't want to accrue all kinds of debt. One thing, and this doesn't work obviously if everybody, depending on your situation, but a friend of mine did this one time is that he, this was before like sell a kidney, right?

Speaker 1:          01:07:15       Yeah. He's, he's, and he's sold a child, uh, before Obama care and um, you know, all those mandatory insurance things. But this happened is that he, he lapsed the payment on his insurance, on his health insurance, lost it, and then was in a kind of a bind, obviously for health care. And he went to doctor's offices with cash and said, could I get, because those doctor's offices and dentist as well are used to, you know, maybe funneling some of this stuff through insurance and they know they're only getting a percentage of the amount and all this stuff. So he just went and was like, if I pay you cash, can I get a discount? And then he got, he said yes across the board. People were doing it for a fraction of what they normally charge because he had cash money. Oh. And I would say if you have dental insurance, why? I think if I've had it once before and it's kind of a waste. And not only that, the dentist, I did take insurance one time I went to and they took my x rays and they, and the guy goes, oh, you have like

Speaker 6:          01:08:16       12 cavities. Remember this? Yeah. And I go, that's horse shit. I don't believe you. I went to a dentist, didn't tell them I had insurance and uh, they took the same x rays and they go, you have no cabinets? No, that was me. No, that was me, Babe.

Speaker 1:          01:08:30       Sure. Yeah, 100% sure. Are you sure one? No. It happened to me too. No, it did happen to me. And I've told you this story. It happened to me. I had dental insurance is so weird. No, it happens. It happened to me when I worked, my God, it happened to me too. Then there's a in Glendale knew that it happened to you. So here's when it happened to me. Okay. It happened to me, happened to me too. I swear to God was the first time we're hearing, I've told you this story multiple times. I worked for the show extreme makeover as a law. Right. They let us go to the dentist to get the zoom whitening treatment. Yeah. When I was there, the x ray me and the guy goes, oh, you have like 17 cavities. And I was like, what? And I go, he's like, yeah, you know, we'll, we'll, we can take care of them all now. And I go, I, I think I'll take a range of insurance at the time. And that's why he was milking you for dental insurance? Yes. And so then I went to another dentist that was covered under that dental insurance and he was like, you have no cavities to, you know, Ciro. And I was blown away by it. And then even though you know that story that happened to you also, did it happen?

Speaker 6:          01:09:35       Can I tell you why I had dental insurance for the first time, my life when I worked at this company. Yeah. And I swear to God, it was in Glendale and the guy goes, oh, you got a lot of work to do. We got it. I swear, I believe you. And then I took it to my Hungarian guy who doesn't exist anymore. He retired fire Dr for hair and he's gotten, he's retired. We can talk to him and he goes, there's no way this guy was totally scamming you. And then I canceled dental insurance all together and just pay it. So I would get a second opinion is what I'm trying to say. And the cavities on the cavities and on the extent of the work that you need a lot about it. Actually a lot of times these scumbags see that you have insurance, I don't know, box.

Speaker 6:          01:10:12       And then they tried to get their money from, you know, if it happened to both of us, it can happen at the cabin. Was it when I was working in Burbank did we weren't dating then where we win, the more you and I were dating, this happened to me that this is a new story, but oh my God, ask Eric. Eric, if you're listening to this, do you remember when this happened to me? Because she'll be like, I remember what happened at Tom. You're the worst. And I remember, Oh, this happened to you too. Okay, got you. Laugh like an all day. I hate you the most. Ah, Shit. Anyway, why are you have dental insurance? Unless it comes with your company. Don't pay for that shit. There's no reason you're going to end up getting jacked even harder. Check this. Go to a Russian dentist.

Speaker 6:          01:10:58       Yeah, I swear to God. Russians will do the work a little bit cheaper too, but we don't know where she lives. Well, find some fucking Russians or eastern blockers. Foreigner. I find a foreigner and I mean that. Find a corner. Offer them cash. Yeah. These white dentists, that's the problem that they do everything above board. You got to go to an immigrant to do shit the right way. Yeah, go to Chinatown. I didn't say that, but whoa. Somewhere eastern bloc. I can't vouch for the Chinese. Do they have good teeth? Chinese people? Ah, I don't know, but it just kinda feels like words. I didn't say what I feel, but I know for a fact that my tribal do your teeth pretty good. Russian eastern bloc.

Speaker 1:          01:11:37       They do. That shit will fuck you. Okay. All right. Well maybe the Russians. Uh Huh. Man, that was fucking good stuff. I hate you so much. Why do you hate me? It happened to me too. I know it happened to you too. I remember. Now you make me insane.

Speaker 6:          01:11:55       And I canceled dental insurance right after, dude. Yes. I think this is when we first started dating. Well yeah, go to somebody like that. That's that neighbor and guys run mother fucker. Go to that. My grandmother figure and they'll tell you. Right. And for a obviously car repairs don't ever go to a white mechanic. What are you nuts? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Always stay away from white people. Immigrants stay away. Right? Eastern bloc. Asians. Okay. Yeah. That's a fear in la. I remember when we went to get our um, Thai massages. Yeah. They were like hookers after, cause you went to a different one.

Speaker 1:          01:12:32       What happened was we, so we moved to a new neighborhood and so we have to do is to discover all kinds of new stuff again. Right? New restaurants and everything you use. That's the only, you know, it's kind of fun, but it's also like bummed out if the place he used to go to you liked. Yeah. So we went to this Thai place together like a few weeks ago and then we went again and we called on the way they are to request the same people that we had the first time. Well, yours was available for you, but mine wasn't. So I go, okay, well I'll try whoever's available. So we finish, uh, the massage, we go to the lobby and the, the lady that they had me the first time goes, oh, she goes last time I go, yeah, yeah. I asked for you. And she looked at the girl that just massage and she goes, yeah, he has for me. And then she looked back at me and she goes, so next time you meet again, and I was like, oh, okay. And the other lady, you could tell that she was higher up on the chain because the, the lady that had just massage me, cat, like put her head down and was like, ah, totally

Speaker 6:          01:13:38       power to hurt. You just got involved in hooker wars, dude. Yeah. Ty Hooker whores. Welker wars massage. Hucker wars. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They totally, she had you as her guy and then you betrayed her. They see that. They see, he

Speaker 1:          01:13:52       just, you know, I think it's a pride thing. Yeah. Yeah. It's like that guy tips. So yeah, that's mine. Yeah. They fucking fight over you once you left, dude. So who are you going to go with next time we go back? I think I would go, it's, you know, they're so different. The first one massacres me, but I, I liked that. I like, how's the,

Speaker 6:          01:14:12       you know, what the end, I'd never come a harder, but the uh, the other lady, petite hands, very small. She's so ferocious though. That first one really grinds masturbated by a child. Right? Oh my God. Little girl hand. Just the thought of that fully erect, but the second lady was a little more, you know, loving. You don't like that? Well, it depends. I mean, I tend to feel like if I had to pick one all the time, I would go for the really aggressive and you like to be hurt. You like to go and stop. Yeah. You like that. That gives you joy during them as well. It's that joy. I feel like the others, if it's less than that, I always feel like nothing's happening. You have to, it has to hurt to feel like something's gotta be deep. Yeah. It's, I feel about toothpaste if I don't feel the burn of aqua fresh.

Speaker 6:          01:15:06       It's exactly like toothpaste. Yes. It's exactly like toothpaste. I know it's working cause it burns your mouth. Yup. Yup. How do you like soft touches though? Right? I like puppy touches you and like a little puppy. I don't want to be heard. Life hurts. I don't need to be hurt in life arts. I don't need to be hurt. She says, you know what I'm saying? Took it to a whole other place. Yes. You know what I mean? I go to their language, to me, I don't need her to beat me up. Yeah. Palm with me. I like my lady. She's, she's a little chunky. I got a little nervous when she got on top of me. I was like, Oh fuck. This bitch got on top of me. Once you explain yourself well at the time, his eyes day to day like sit on you.

Speaker 6:          01:15:49       She sits on my butt bones. They put their knees on you and I got real nervous. I'm like, bitch, I just gave birth like, you know, almost five months ago.

Speaker 16:         01:25:51       This mushroom foraging knife is made by Radica or a company that has been hand crafting brushes in Germany for over 75 years and is one of the last producer as a lab.

Speaker 6:          01:26:01       You guys understand how pronounced her vocal fry is? I mean it's like, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:26:09       it's a deliberate, the more that I learned about vocal fry, the thing that stands out and that is a deliberate action. People are learning and then repeating a forced, uh, vocal

Speaker 6:          01:26:22       affectation. Uh, yeah. It's because people like, I know it's because of the cart dash the Kardashians. They talk like that and then people, then they ended up talking like that themselves. But it's not natural to be like they been making these handcraft the artifacts, knives and brush hose, not how you talk about, I usually it usually it does go with a girl. I was talking a lot about a lot of Charles,

Speaker 16:         01:26:53       it has been handcrafting brushes in Germany for over 75 years and is one of the last producers of handmade fresh ideas are coming from a sustainably source, would handle a stinky hot lead and have belts in pig bristle brush pipe. It is not only an ideal tool for foraging mushrooms, but also to clean them. She looks a little mind blowing dirt away from mushrooms is better than rinsing them.

Speaker 6:          01:27:19       Or I'd say, who the fuck has time to do this to their mushrooms? I always pay by ability to pay your mushroom and then use a special carving to like fuck off. Who's got time? Well, actually I started studying could day. I bet he paints his mushrooms. You pay your mushrooms, but yeah, it's a metaphor, right? Paint in your restrooms. It's great. Yeah. Uh, can I see what she does with these mushrooms though? I'm curious now. She didn't, that's it. Yeah. We just had the vocal fry, that's all my master painter mushrooms. I paint my mushrooms. You're not every fucking day. I wake up at 5:00 AM before the baby's loot the sun, and then I paint my mushrooms. Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:28:16       um, so we have, uh, something that, what's been in the, in the,

Speaker 6:          01:28:22       uh,

Speaker 1:          01:28:26       been in the jeans kind of machine here for awhile. I, one of the all time greats. I think maybe one of my, it's gotta be one of my favorite artists of all time. And that would be the great Rihanna. Also the Great Mozart, you know, I'm a big mom. It's hard, I think you mean mom's, sorry. And I are very, very tight. Um, I play a lot of his songs. What's up?

Speaker 17:         01:28:57       Is it a Mozart in that folder?

Speaker 1:          01:28:59       Um, well let me check. I don't trust you guys. Something smells fishy. No, it's not fishing. I promise. I promise it's not, but I have it. I have it saved. Thank you. A blue band, everybody. Uh, and maybe when you do patriotic, we can do a blue band episode where we can get introduce. Yeah. Um, people are like, who's blue band? Well, he's a fucking bird. Okay. Um, anyways, um, seeds, he needs seeds on a new mirror for his cage. He likes to look at himself. Did you know that at birds or is those silly? Mozart was really into anal Lingus. I did. He wrote a song about it. Yes. Um, so we have some of this stuff here, some of his lyrics and some of his songs. Um, we've been dying to play it for you.

Speaker 18:         01:29:58       My ass, my ass.

Speaker 1:          01:30:03       That wasn't him, but that's just kind of the, the world that he's in. Um, you understand what I'm saying? Are, you know what I'm talking about? Do you understand? Okay. Here we go. Okay. Yeah. Let me, let me, let me see what

Speaker 4:          01:30:26       sound.

Speaker 19:         01:30:30       Oh, fuck me in my ass. Know how great is that? 20,000 years ago

Speaker 4:          01:30:37       you were writing songs about 22,500 years.

Speaker 19:         01:30:57       Here's what's going on. Here's the translation. Lick me in the ass. Let us be glad. Grumbling is in vain. Groundling droning is in vain, is the true cross of the life, thus less does let us be glad and Mary Pretty Great, right? It's great. Yeah. I've, I've read about this before. It's a little ditty that he wrote. He also was known to be very sexual in nature with his letter writing. Here's a letter that he wrote to his cousin. Wouldn't you like to visit hair? Goldsmith again? What for? Nothing. Just one choir, I guess about the Spoonie Goonie fate. Nothing else. Nothing else. Long live. All those who, how does it go on? I wish you were. I now wish you a good night. Shit in your bed with all your might. Sleep with peace on your mind and try to kiss your own behind. I love it. I would have really liked your mom's house. I think he would have been a big fan. Yeah. Tip the hat to you Sir Mam. Sorry. Yeah. So this is um, I mean one of the greatest musical minds ever isn't a shitting and wrote a beautiful song about, oh yeah. I mean we could probably get acquired as things as not know what they're doing. That's a really funny idea. Actually. Get them to sing it and be like, here's what you saying.

Speaker 19:         01:32:26       I love it. I love it too.

Speaker 6:          01:32:30       Need to know that. And He, yeah, he was a bit of a perv. That's cool.

Speaker 1:          01:32:32       Yeah. Yeah. He had a lot of, of uh, apparently at more than one song about the ass and ass eating. Yeah. Lick my ass. Yes. Very good. Very, very good. Very talented man. That guy

Speaker 18:         01:32:46       my ass late. Another day there.

Speaker 6:          01:32:51       Similar, similar, maybe not with the music, but certainly a performer. The penis music. Yeah. One of your favorites for sure. I love Rocco and I go way back. So anyways, great discussion with him. We got to wrap this show. Hey sticks on deck. 600 deck. We've got a lot of that. Um, where was it? Oh, it was texts. Texted deal. So I got a rogue text message from, you know, I got this new phone number about a year ago and now I just, I get random texts. Random voicemails. Yeah. And someone just wrote sticks on deck.

Speaker 1:          01:33:23       We mentioned that last week and we've got a lot of messages, a lot, some of them very insulting. I'm saying, how could you not know that? And then how could you name yeah, how could you not know that? And then 10 different versions of what they think it meant. A lot of people said like the Xanax, then I got Xanax. Right. Uh, then people said do 600 deck is guns. There's guns here. I have guns for sale. Okay. No, then people said, uh, yeah, sticks on deck set. Like I wrote, dude, obviously it's a photographer. Uh, dicks are tripods, so it's like we're ready to shoot sticks on deck. They're ready to go. Okay. That was a likely, um, not, not very, I don't know. No. Look. So I think it's drugs. So we had Xanax guns. Um, a tripod and then somebody was like, no, it's money, but that's stacks and stacks. Stacks are not sticks. Yeah. He had sticks on deck. Right. It sticks on Day. Yeah. So why would, yeah, I think it's a typo. And there was like, oh, he's got his money. He's got all his money.

Speaker 6:          01:34:28       Here's why. Cause this phone number also gets tweets a text about gambling too from, I think a similar, really the number. So it's like, hey, there's action on blah, blah blah, or whatever. So it's drugs and it's gambling. And that makes sense because eight is the, who this is a problem, has a problem. Adas was mia and his family was living in Rehab. He was in Rehab is shrink was looking for him one time. Adas. Yeah. He ran from his family. So he, I think it's atus. Hmm. Interesting.

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       I know since Shenaz with all her nursing job, she's not getting, and then the Persian a person. Yeah. The Persian person. I forget what their name is. That's what I'd say personally. I don't want to use the wrong pronoun or something. June. June. Yeah. Joan. Joan. No, Shanna. Mm. Okay. Um, all right, so this is, uh, let's see, I got to look at my cheat sheet. Assholes, my ass home. This is by Anthony. He's, Oh my God. Anthony Heath data. I know, I know. I know. I didn't think that it was happening right now, but those are the [inaudible] nine. Hey, don't forget the bike shirt. Please go to Tom [inaudible] dot com people are loving the bike shirt. Please get that, uh, support your genes. Anthony, he here with the closing song. I'll let him set it up and take it away. Jeans, anything else you want to mention before we go listen to that Steve Brown?

Speaker 11:         01:36:03       Uh Huh.

Speaker 20:         01:36:22       My and I were talking earlier and we noticed some,

Speaker 8:          01:36:26       okay.

Speaker 20:         01:36:26       Some more troubling pattern in the community. Um, although the, your mom's house community has come together to accept all poly and by people, which I am both. Um, there's been a, an outline group that really is unrepresented. And even just sometimes, um, I came out to my father at 15 as an acoustic singer songwriter, and I just thought I should work on something to really bring the community back together and, uh, and the rift, so,

Speaker 5:          01:37:35       and little kids, whoa.
