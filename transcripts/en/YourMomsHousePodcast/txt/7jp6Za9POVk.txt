Speaker 10:         00:14:30       Yes sir. I'm going to start this shit. I'm here. What's happening? I'm all good, but I want to see,

Speaker 2:          00:14:39       so this is a, for people listening, obviously we haven't done a good job of introducing what they're listening. By the way, if you're just listening to the show, you're really missing out because we're on youtube now, full episodes and you can

Speaker 11:         00:14:52       see the clips that you're hearing. Talk about a huge improvement in your life. So subscribe to us on Youtube. Okay. Slash your mom's house podcast, right? youtube.com/podcast subscribe because all we also have behind the scenes. Yeah, no that was it. I got a good idea. So tell, tell everybody what they're listening to. So this is the bird man. No, I saw this on Instagram cause I think Merlin Wayne's had posted it and I just saw some guy getting all pissed and I saw it and I like filed it away. And then you brought it up and I was like, who? Because I didn't know that guy's name was bird man. And then you're like Birdman. And I'm like, oh I don't know who that is. And then I later her put the two things together in my head. But you're accusing me of lying and you're calling me crazy. Cause I,

Speaker 7:          00:15:55       we had a phone call over the weekend, I was in sperm can and I'm talking to you and I explained, explained to you in detail about this. And then when we sat down here and you go, do you have the Birdman clip? And I go, yeah, of course. And you go, oh yeah, like I told you about that. And I was like,

Speaker 11:         00:16:13       what are you talking about? He goes, I told you. They say I told you about that. I did. Oh, I was joking. I know, I know. I knew I didn't break the news to you. I just had seen it as what I said. That's what I meant. Rather, I was familiar with the bird man's work. Okay. Pick on my name. But he's, he's crazy, ugly cry

Speaker 7:          00:16:35       dude. He's so mad at them. So let's go over for what's going on. So Birdman, for those of you that don't know, he is a hip hop mogul. Like one of the ogs from the 90s he started cash money records. He had that, you know, that whole wave of guys Mannie fresh was as producer, juvenile, little wheezy, Lil Wayne, that whole crew, they sold millions and millions of records. He has a net worth well over a hundred million dollars cheaper. And you know, he's just like the rest of the moguls and hip hop. He has a fashion line, he has liquor line, he's very savvy, very savvy business guy. But in recent years he's gotten a lot of flack for some of his record contracts. The fact that he has little Wayne tied up and won't let them out of a deal. And so people have kind of really shit on him for that, especially within hip hop. And so what's happening is that this guy right here, Charlemagne the God, he had talked about bird man's business practices with a couple other guests who were hip hop artists, trick daddy

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       and Rick Ross. I like Rick Ross the boss. That's right. Chelsea. Lately when I was there you and you stole his hassle of that. Um, well birdman comes in and he has all this in his head. Like you guys have been talking shit. You will, you had Rick Ross, me a trick daddy. So he comes in right away and is like you to put some fucking respect on my name. I saw that. Yeah. Um, and then this whole thing, this was supposed to be a, an interview obviously last, you know, like less than two minutes. Oh, so he didn't stick around and they didn't, this is the whole thing. Now I already got gave you a little bit of it. So here's how it starts. He said that before they were rolling and then this guy is like, well let's roll. Let's go, let's go. You know,

Speaker 10:         00:18:29       especially guests in the building. You don't cross those out. Tell them don't get it off your chest. And I thought you were joking because I don't want to stay in the angle. Like what? So I come in, I did it already. I'm hill. So was that, I'm in, it's all good. But I'm saying why, why, why and I'm here. What's happening? I'm all good, but I'm saying, yeah man, man, I want to see you. I want to just talk to you. And your man and your faith. Absolutely. You understand me? I knew a few places you wish that I could've pulled up, but I don't think that was gangster. I wanted to come look in your face like a man and tell you how I feel. Okay? Yeah, it's done. Me Straight up like a man and know you're filming. I just come to let John know. Stop. Put some respect on my name. No stemi. When y'all saying my name, put some respect on it. We spec.

Speaker 2:          00:19:19       Yeah. Ari SBAC.

Speaker 10:         00:19:21       Kay Kay. Put some respect on my name. Pull up more roles that were trick daddy. Now I'm pulling up on you Nigga. Oh, I'm the radio guy. Why wouldn't want to read it? I've got all that stuff for the radio guy. Me and my Nigga. Yo, y'all are y'all finished? I ain't got no talking. Okay. Like 72 ago. It was nice chains. You should get those [inaudible] don't we all? Are we all finished? Are Y'all done? I ain't got no more talk. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:19:58       that's quite a question though, right? What y'all finish? Y'All done? You'll finish or y'all done or y'all done. It's nonsense that he's given them the same option. Sure. Right. Are you finished or are you all done? Yeah. They need her waves and know when. Yeah. Yeah. I'd say don't pay the guy up that has tattoos on reddit. Right. You ready or you want to go, hey, he's got a lot of tests. Yeah. What'd you piss that guy off? Teardrop stars. He's got a fucking oil field tattooed on the other side of his head. Really? Oil coming out of, yeah. Boy. Yeah. No. My question is though, if you're just going to come in and be angry, why go? Why go in at all? I think for him that was him making his point. His point was, I am going to show up. Like he misled them and said, ah, yeah, I want to do an interview and talk, but he really wanted to do was show up and go put some respect on my name, put some respect, don't talk shit about me, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:20:53       Wow, that's a crazy move dude. Or You could just say, I don't want to do your show, but that's not, I mean then they don't really understand how serious you are. Yeah, I think on some level a lot of people made a lot of jokes about this. Like we've been making jokes about it too, but on some level those guys in that studio feel how serious he is. I felt it. I got scared for a minute there. I was like, Oh shit. Sure. They're much more scared in the actual, I don't know if it's in this pre roll before they, um, but when he comes in here and he's like stop fucking doing this shit. You can see the girl who's part of the show and she, her eyes darted around like was yeah, cause he's bringing in all those dudes like you don't know what's it going to happen. She knows that this is, you can tell look like fights. She's, yes, she's around some shit. She's working the station long enough. She's seen some fights. Where the fuck is that? God Damn it fucking sucks.

Speaker 2:          00:22:05       Pass Pi's mommy. No, I'll read user. I want to start this shit off straight telling Obria so late in the day where they're all like, Nah, grand opening. All right, well there you have it. Are we good? We good. Let me go. You know it's funny though as like all the black people I follow on Instagram, they're all lining up this guy. Yeah, of course. Posted some funny shit like some remain buddy did clowning on it. I mean I guess he's just had he had his feelings hurt. Huh? But he can't go in there and be like, guys, my feelings are hurt.

He's been inscribed. Yeah, put some respect on my name. You can. You can hear the quiver in the area or a guy. Why he really got fired up? Huh? He really did, man.

Speaker 2:          00:23:28       Damn. Poor guy. Poor Birdman. Yeah. And then I like tennis. I like to know his feelings or her like that and I want to give him a hug. I bet. I bet little Wayne had a good laugh about that. Oh, as Lil Wayne on his label or whatever. I remember I just told you all about that. Hmm.

Speaker 11:         00:23:49       I forget all the names you rattled off. I mean, I heard finished. Are Y'all done? Y'All finished? Is it, are you shirts or all you all done? Yeah. Yeah.

Um, do you want to tell them what happened? I, before I left last week when we took that a romantic dinner together. So Tommy and I, we've been together a million years and there was one house I lived in. My first shower was great. It was like a fire, a fire hose dumping. And it was a big shower. And you and I used to shower together in the mornings. Very romantic. It's going to be our work. We had day jobs and we'd get up. Sure. Yeah. 2005 genes and genes showering together every morning. It was really sweet. I would put a shampoo on your head and you had suds my bag and we make kissy faces and then go to work. Yeah. Now this next two houses, we always had small shower so he showers were out.

Speaker 11:         00:28:06       Yup. Until now. Yeah. And we've got this wonderful shower and a with two heads on it or whatever. And it's really, it's a miracle. It's a miracle. And so we know, we get the like, hey, let's go take a shower together. It's been a good few years since we've done that and it starts off okay. And then all of a sudden, um, little things like you're lathering your head but extra hard. And then now the suds are like hitting my eyes. You, you like it freezing cold. I like it warm like a person, but you know like it warm. You like burn third degree burns hot. It's so hot. Yeah, that's a shower. It's killing the bacteria. It's done. And then my after, so I'm like okay, but I'll let that slide don't say anything to you. And then you spread your ass cheeks, you spread them and you're not doing this as a Joe spreading your ass hole open and then the water's hitting your ass hole and I'm right next to you.

Speaker 11:         00:29:03       Like really bro, you're going to do that. All right, well it's a clean it out, right? Yeah. You don't think you can be a little more discreet or kind a bar soap and I put it in there and then you go, what are you doing? Yeah, so cleaning my asshole. But you're not supposed to take the bar and mash it against the dirty part. Yeah you are. No, that's what's savages do. I've always done that. Yeah, because you're a bear. You're not a person. That's how you do it. And that's how you do it. But then you can Tammy. No, you contaminate the ball.

Speaker 4:          00:29:38       Okay.

Speaker 11:         00:29:40       Oh that's what it was like. Oh. And then I made notes cause I didn't want to forget. And then you farted in the shower cause you spread your asshole and then you farted. And then my favorite, unbelievable. This is, it gets wilder, the hording, hording. Look, he's next to me in the shower. I'm trying to cuddle with you, kiss your face, Kicks Your Beard, You pee on me all the time in the shower. You piss on me in the shower and all that I can even tolerate until you blew snot. That was the deal breaker for me. You were and then the snack came out all over your beard and it gets stuck in your beard and I almost vomited in the shower. That's when I was like, all right, I'm done. I got to go. I almost threw out. I'm like, it's like showering with a Hobo, like a vagrant who's never been in an indoor shower before.

Speaker 11:         00:30:44       You were like, it's a homeless person but you've never been in a shower before I shower, I forgot the horrors. Like you got to clean all the pipes out, you know, and got to get rid of all of it. Apparently farted, you spread your ass hole, you hordes loogies snotting you pissed on me. I didn't jerk off. That's the one, the one boundary left in our marriage or maybe we still haven't had that and I have a white then on New Jersey and I've been waiting for that to happen for years. I'm at the point now where I'm kind of excited about sometimes now like it, cause I used to be like really like Ooh, be real careful. But now I'm like just let it happen. Let it happen. Well I just expect it now. I'm like, come on, she's going to walk in there. What would you do? Finish and you'll just look at me. Would you make eye contact? Probably maintain it or what'd you just get Outta here and then finish? I think I would just be like, watch, watch, watch, watch, watch, watch.

Speaker 11:         00:31:42       It's pretty long time since what that we've been, you know, together though that that hasn't happened yet. It's kind of crazy. Especially considering I do it pretty often, you know? Yeah. When, when the, when the baby's crying cause I turned you on. You have a shower. There's no bathroom door cause it's one of those bedrooms where it just goes in bathroom. Yeah. I know. I've been waiting to catch you in there when I've done it in the shower a few times. So when I've been home. Yes. Grote gross. That's probably when I'd been with the kid though. Right? Yeah. I hope you're smart enough to do it when I'm with the baby as opposed to winter when when I'm walking free and maybe I'd come in and, well why would I have to worry about that? You're my wife. I don't want to watch you jerking off. I don't want to catch you and have that horrible awkward moment. I didn't know that. Why would I want to catch you masturbating? It's not part of my life. I don't want to know it and I'll, why don't to know. I would think a lot of people would want to see. Nobody wants to see you masturbate. Really? You look like a homeless person.

Speaker 2:          00:32:45       Do you know? You keep saying, Hey, blow you blow your nose too, and as I jerk off, art and whore can everything as I jerk off. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. I have to get myself worked up. I'm going to throw up.

Speaker 4:          00:33:02       Oh my God.

Speaker 11:         00:33:05       They tell you about the wife. I already talked about this on the show about, I'll talk about it again. The wife that walked in on the husband jerking off onto his shit. Yes. God. Did you have to take it there? Yeah. Julie, that one. Yes. Some wild man. That's what I'm afraid. Of course the come like, I need to fucking know that. Okay, listen, can I read this email? Yeah. Subjects at double pipe. Classic question. Very important. Very important. Okay. Hi Mommy's. I was taking my regular dump this morning when I let out the usual pre-brown. Fuck you writes. I burped at the same time. I was absolutely shocked and couldn't believe what happened. It was a very exciting moment. However, does this count as an authentic pure double pipe classic or would it be considered a double pipe classic with special circumstances? Uh, I will point out that I was sitting down on the toilet, but the double pipe classic happened at least 30 seconds before any brown exited my anus.

Speaker 2:          00:34:08       Hmm. It's a really good question. How do you feel about it?

Speaker 11:         00:34:14       You know, I think putting, um, circumstances around a double pipe classic isn't fair because look, they're like Haley's comet, they come around so rarely. Yeah. It doesn't really matter how one has a double pipe or just that one has a double pipe. Even

Speaker 2:          00:34:29       during a murder, if it's still a double pack classic. No, like murder. Yeah. Like if you were to be thrown out of a building and as you hit the ground, you fired in, birthed, you get to take that to the credit. Yeah. You get credit for that. Yeah, I think so too. So, um, I don't believe in the special circumstance either. I would say, sir, you devil biohazard over five classic and it's, uh, it's something to be celebrated. I would tell people about would make Facebook posts. I would, yeah. Yeah. That would share that. That's really cool. Who invented that? That term? Is that a top dog term? Mm. Oh, it's generations old, right? Yeah. Yeah. Has It in the Bible? I think it's the old might be, it might be in the Bible. It's certainly in like Shakespeare and stuff. Yeah. Oh definitely. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:35:14       Yeah, yeah. Dot. Half made a double level five class. I think it's in Romeo and Juliet actually. Yeah. Cause she kind of uh, gets after him for having one or something. Like she's on the balcony, I remember that. Oh Juliet. And then he starts and burps and she's like Romeo, what? Double Pipe. Classic. Yeah, that's right. And that's what gets her, and then they get married and then you're here sitting here. Give me a, me, me a hard time about it. But you know, it's actually, it's, it's 11 lecture lab. You know, your sister just got married and I was looking through those wedding photos this morning and I was like, wow, look at what a happy time. Just that wedding. Yeah. Romantic. And then flash forward nine, eight years. Yeah. Taking a shower with your husband, blowing snot rockets and spreading his ass hole in the shower. It's pretty cool. It is pretty cool. I agree. It's pretty little weddings. A little misleading. No.

Speaker 4:          00:36:10       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:36:10       Are you saying you want me to dial it back? No, there's nothing I can do. Train's already left the station, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:36:17       Hm. Hm.

Speaker 2:          00:36:21       Which is the one you want me to cut out though. Oh Ma, I the snot rockets that rocket. Yeah. In the shower. I don't even mind getting pissed on anymore. Like I just expect it now. I'm like, Nah, what's that warm? Um, it's Tom Peeing on me. The ass spreading even that I can tolerate. I think the horror, the horror king and snot rocketing. I can't, I can't, I'm working a loogie is the way it makes one of vomit. Oh, speaking of that, um, this guy, big fan. Uh, let's see if I can fake fan. Yeah. He's a big fan of the show. He's a big fan of what you were just saying. Yeah.

Even the woman, she was like, I love them. So there's a twitch twitch or something taking over your body. So if a man has an erection longer than he's supposed to, direction goes, no baby.

Tamar was a little bit more normal there, having their vagina steam that I remember in this episode you have vaginas or steamed. Yeah, they're, they're getting their badge esteemed right now. It's like so weird. Yeah. It's on a stupid, uh, but anyway, I think they just did it for the show. Like not real. Right? Like a lot of things. Yeah. Like we're going to get spray tanned. They've got to end up giving those people something to do, you know? Yeah. They can't just sit around and talk. They have to sit around and talk and get their vaginas steamed silly. Would you want to have a three hour orgasmic Twix? Oh Wow. Oh God.

Speaker 11:         00:42:15       We read your funeral. Yeah. And you just keep coming all over him. All over. Your Dad hold over your dad's dead body. Gosh, he doesn't come though every time, right? Yes. Got stuff coming out. But he's feeling like he's coming. Right. But could you imagine anything in that? If he just filled his pants all the time too, then you'd have like, his pants were all wet. That's right, Babe. Can't pick up the kids at the, you said that all or nothing, you know, like you just figured that out. I did that. I didn't put that together more. Yeah. Like his shorts would be all wet. Yeah. You don't want to have nasty three and four hour nasty directions either. You know, you don't want that. No. By Agra might be helpful. Yeah. Be Bad. Yeah. Very bad. Isn't that with Viagara does though? Yes, exactly. A car for three hours. Yeah. It's silly. Yeah. Can I speak in of Dick hard? I got, I'm a random text message by Agra might be helpful. Yeah. You know, this is the, the new phone number, not even new anymore. Maybe a year. And I keep getting random text and random voicemails. I just got this one, a Saturday, 10:35 PM and all it says is sticks on deck.

Speaker 13:         00:43:34       Okay.

Speaker 11:         00:43:34       The fuck does that mean sticks on deck? It sounds like I'm ready to fuck. That's what I thought. Like maybe it's a sexting thing. You're getting sex, it sticks on deck. Maybe it's a sticks on deck, bitch. Maybe it's one of your comedy club contacts. Yeah. Yeah, sure. And then I, I texted my millennial friends and she said, it sounds like hold on. Sounds like can you go to thousands? Like it sounds like no, no, no. She goes, uh, never heard that one. I'm going to stick like blunt wraps. Maybe the blonde, maybe the blends are on deck. Wow. Your millennials. Very savvy. I know. This is my one contact with the young people, the cloud deck six odd duck lunch or ready for roll sticks on marijuana cigar if you will. Yeah, yeah, sure. So fucking, well not only did you get sticks on deck, yeah. You also got after

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       a long hiatus, new corrosion voicemail. That's neat. Right? The same lady St Lady. And it's weird cause it's been going on for months and months and I have a theory on this. I understand. Okay. This lady, like people that are from the millennial generation that are from the generation, even before us, she perhaps is dialing from memory. So she is dialing every time, not doing a saves number. I'm calling my friends and tiles and is like a digit off every time or, okay. That's one excellent theory. Brown lock, or she's got like maybe that the old number saved in her phone and there's two numbers for one person. You ever have that in new one and an old one? There could be. Yep. That's another option. The reason that I thought that she was dialing from memory is that there are, there's clearly, there's probably some interaction in between these things because he doesn't go like you never called me back. It means that they probably speak at some point and maybe she's dialing correctly, sometimes incorrectly, incorrectly. Other times she clearly hasn't figured out that this number doesn't get a response. So you're right. The interaction kind of comes and goes, which leads me to believe it could be an alternate phone number. Like with my dad, I have his old number and is new, but then you, well, here's what came in this weekend. First.

Speaker 12:         00:45:57       Connie, please airbnb to the chancery down. You know enough nothing to do. She shammy are now making notes on my, it doesn't look any. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:46:31       And then you think that's it and then she calls you again. Again,

Speaker 12:         00:46:36       come on Rod. But didn't you take the notice for the comeback please rob?

Speaker 2:          00:46:44       So wait, it's Salamay I thought I'd solemn and now this person's rob, this woman, just dialing, dialing and leaving messages for everybody. No discretion now discretion. No discretion to her dialing. Yeah. Oh Man. That's the trick. Styling together lady. Anyway, I'm still getting those nice voicemails. Yeah, I suppose this is rob. Come on, come on back. I still get nursing gigs for Shanaze synopsis. This is Brad calling from them. The newest Shit Nas would know. You know, because she's

Speaker 5:          00:47:20       just missing out on all kinds of business opportunities. What are you doing?

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       No, I don't want it. She doesn't vomit, but I don't like the dry heat. That's when I'm like working. I don't like it, I'm closing it because you're just torturing me. Torture you. You're my wife. So really sad news is that we lost another icon. Goddammit. The day after last week's episode aired on my flight up to a sperm. Can I get a message? Prince died. Oh my God, it's devastating dude's we thought it was because I dropped charges to the game that my new football podcast and then he listened to it and drop dead cause he didn't like football. But that's not what happened. It's not happened though. First Whitney, then Michael, now prince. That's the Holy Trinity. I know. There's only Madonna's the only one left and she's the Holy Spirit of the childhood stars. Cindy Lopper I would say is another great. He's 57. He was, he was level.

Speaker 2:          00:48:34       Yeah, I know. We're going to get the autopsy reports back. They sending them to you? Well, yeah. Well the guy, the coroner there said, Tom, I'll try to get to you first. Um, so that's like in another week or so. I mean, I'll probably get it tomorrow for everybody, but, um, no, I mean I'm curious as to see what killed him. You know, he's so that's too young to die. Well, they're saying it's quite that pneumonia and then someone brought up a point that he's a Jehovah's Witness and maybe he refused medical treatment. Well, he had an emergency plane landing the week before he was flying back from a Gig. Uh, they landed his plane in Illinois. It was only like, I think it's Illinois, right? It was only about 30 minutes or so from Minneapolis, but they deemed it that important. Landed, took him to a local hospital.

Speaker 2:          00:49:19       They wanted him to stay in the hospital and he, they didn't secure a private room for him. Oh nope. It's Prince, you should secure a private hospital. So he took off the next day there was a dance party at Paisley Park, cause compound and oh wow. Outside of Minneapolis. And supposedly everything was fine. And then obviously this is, you know, then there was footage of him riding his bike around his neighborhood and the stopping in a record store. So all that they said was fine. It does lead, you know, a lot of like the medical people to think that you don't realize how many people die of the flu and pneumonia every year. It's thousands. That's for old people. No it's not. It's not always got old and young are more common than die with it. But what the point being that if your body is weak, so he's already been hospitalized, should have, say your, your immune system is a little bit weaker. You're already sick and then you get that and you're not taking care of it. You know, your, your lungs fill up with fluid and you die. Maybe HIV or something and nobody knew. Who knows? We'll find out. He so town he wrote songs for so many people too, which is a crazy

Speaker 11:         00:50:28       part shit that you don't even know that guy was responsible for. I just remember, uh, purple rain came out. I bought the album when I was a little girl. Really seven or eight years old. I had it on, I had a 33 of when doves cry and on the back was 17 days was another song and I didn't know what that stuff, I didn't know what masturbation was. I learned about it from Darling Nikki. I learned about sex through purple rain. That was like one of the seminal, if you will, albums of my childhood and Apollonia seeing her tits. I remember she jumped in the lake, Lake Titicaca or whatever. I remember seeing Apollonius tents for the first time. You're like, Whoa, there's tits and a movie.

Speaker 7:          00:51:08       Prince was interesting. He was kind of like, as a kid I was like, what is this guy? Cause he was so, you know, so different but so singular, so unique. Know I would watch see prince and I was like, this dude is unlike any dude that I've seen or known. Cause he had that kind of non binary

Speaker 11:         00:51:27       nonbinary quality to him. Right. He kind of morphed between the two genders. He was a femme, a femme at man, feminine, Heterosexual. Like David Bowie. David Bowie may have been bisexual. There was rumors that he was sleeping when era. Dude, he was, yeah. But yeah, he was a fem guy and he was, he loved it and he was short. And you know what's so interesting about friends and I have to tiny and he wore those little heels is that prince was, what was magic about him is that he believed he was sexy. He really believed that he was, when you look at him objectively, look at a picture, a photograph of prints, and you'd be like, this guy's fucking five feet tall. He's a shrimp and he's tired. But he exuded this presence of like a sex God. And everybody took him to be that way, which is amazing. Crazy. Aw, come on. That's a jam. That's the jam. 1999. Jim Purple Rain Is, I think a perfect outcome. I still listen to it.

Speaker 7:          00:52:26       Um, the uh, I mean also, you know, even even the early days, I was staying a little later on, you know, you get to some of the, the songs that were just amazing to listen to as well. And you know, in honor of him, we have a little bit of it. Cause we were, we were

Speaker 11:         00:52:43       big fans, you know, Shane, late Tom and Christina from your moms house, podcasts you need to teach. You haven't seen diamonds and pearls. I love girls. Everyone loves this song. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:53:02       So good.

Speaker 11:         00:53:09       I liked his earlier stuff too. Paisley Park and uh, this, is this paused or no, no, that's, that's just the intro to this. Oh, you know that song? Pay Sleep easy girl on know season. That's a good song.

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       Yeah. Dude. He's got so many heads dealer library it, it's, it's crazy. Library. Yeah. The library yet.

Speaker 14:         00:53:34       Damn man. Damn

Speaker 7:          00:53:37       such a good song. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

Speaker 14:         00:53:45       Damn man. Damn.

Speaker 2:          00:53:49       Okay. So we're just doing a little sample. Well, you know, we get the, they might flag it for being a duplicate copy of the audio matches up perfectly with the original and then you do you want to flag it? Breaks it down. So we just gave you a low sample. Yeah. You gave you diamonds amp or it's not as diamond. Yeah, especially [inaudible]. I mean, Shane exuded everything that I think Princeton in this, um, even aesthetically similar, very similar guys. It's a tribute. It's really a tribute.

Speaker 7:          00:54:26       Um, obviously Shane, um, you know, he wasn't doing his best there. He makes that clear and a lot of his clubs, he was like, I'm not doing my best. Um, you know, it was interesting to point out as I go through these pages here, I'm looking for, I have more of Shane, which I know you want to hear.

Speaker 2:          00:54:45       Everybody is on bated breath waiting for more Shane Shane

Speaker 7:          00:54:50       episodes, uh, that we featured him back to back a while ago. Um, yeah, let me see. I already had some technical problems with that computer. Um, perfectly, perfectly. Uh Huh.

Speaker 2:          00:55:14       Oh, that, I'll get that. I'll get flagged for sure. Nice.

Speaker 13:         00:55:17       Yay.

Speaker 2:          00:55:26       Yeah, yeah, Yup. There you go. But I really, I loved prince as a little girl. I thought he was just amazed. I still is, was, yeah. What a bummer. Um, when we dedicated the entire segments to Shane, this is just trivia from our, your mom's house turn is going to go on Wikipedia, but this will go on the Wikipedia page when we dedicated, um, 20 minutes to him on an episode, I don't know, a year ago, the following week, our listenership went down by over 30% easily. And it took a while to regain that. Yep. Nope, nope. Yep. People were aggressively upset with the emails. We got. Stop playing this guy. He's the worst. He's the worst. So yeah, we don't want to Overdo it with,

Speaker 2:          00:56:20       ah, this was a little bit half off form or there is a feed. Sounded like when he had a kennel cough, it's exactly what he sounded like. Um, it's gone. So rest in peace prints such a bomber and you know, and then the shit suck. Artists are still alive. We know why not Justin Bieber take him gun instead of taking the good ones, you know? And there really isn't a climate to nurture artists as weird as prince. Now if you look at it, it's gone. You get bloated.

Speaker 11:         01:03:31       I don't think it's funny. I think it's horrible. I think we were trying to have, I wasn't

Speaker 12:         01:03:36       think well that for driving me. He just told me that he's not by me, but he's nothing. He's Bi sexual but doesn't qualify. And you don't mind that he's bisexual by the way.

Speaker 11:         01:03:48       Oh, I see. Yeah, he's, well, he's Paulie. He's polyamorous, bisexual buddies, non-binary. So he's not attracted to either sex.

That I, that it was like showering with a homeless person. Isn't that rude? We didn't come this Thursday. Yeah. She said that showering with me is like showering with a homeless person because I'm sweating.

Speaker 2:          01:04:52       Ask her about the comfort or if she noticed that he was washing the comfort those right. That's true. That's a good point, mom. Hey Dad told me the other day that he farted on the bed and that there was shit on the bedspread. It did its job. And what did you think when you heard this?

Speaker 12:         01:05:11       I walk in the house and I see you in the washing machine has, I guess, should we say that? But I guess what you said what it was. It wasn't naturally I didn't, but I, I had to meet them farm and again it was one of the for the noise. Yes. Modified for, yeah.

Now, do you that distinction, did you, it's a very important distinction. Did it bother you that he didn't remove the poop stains from the bedspread? He just put with the chunks of poop into the Washer.

Speaker 12:         01:06:28       All right. Would you mind to change the topic of conversation because it's so disgusting, but I know I was in good call.

They should the [inaudible]. There you go. Hey. Yeah, you're getting there. I'm finally.

Speaker 11:         01:11:14       Yep. All right you. Bye. Bye. Love you. Bye. You know we should do when they come visit next week then it's dangerous, but I'll take your neck, brother and my mom. We should buy dolls for Ellis when she comes over next time. [inaudible] like barbies and put them around. Ellis. It's true and put them in address. See if they like it. Yeah, it's a good idea. Yeah. Well that wasn't well, that was great. Yeah. She's not as supportive as I was hoping for, but you know. Nah, I hate when people aren't as supportive as they should be. This stuff, you know, I know progress. People are trying to make Pauley and I'm buy it. Let's get some progress. Um, yeah. Here's the time. I told my dad, hey, you got to tell you something. I'm Pauley and I'm bi.

Speaker 11:         01:12:09       I'm poly and a buy. How was the best day of my life when we told me dad, you were going. He goes, all right buddy. Well ACDC, Huh? Oh, switch hitter. Right. That's so funny. I love explaining this stuff to the older generation. It's really fun. I can't wait to tell my dad about non binary. I don't, I dunno. They make their heads explode when you try to explain this stuff to that. I was talking about the bathroom thing. If North Carolina with my dad and he was like, we've stumbled, he has a dick, then they can piece next to me. But if they don't have a dick, they can't come into the bathroom with me. I'm like, that makes sense. He's like, I don't know why people aren't worried about children pissing next two grown men. That's more worrisome. I mean you actually have a point like what's he worried about? Like you know how in men's bathroom stalls guys just fucking pee next to each other and if you're lucky there's some kind of a divider and sometimes there's not. Yeah. He's like, I think we should be more concerned about like little boys. That is the bigger issue.

Speaker 11:         01:13:12       You don't know what the, what the grown men are doing. It's terrifying because you're a little kid, a little boy. Public restrooms are kind of terrifying. I mean the fact that you should be expected to whip your genitals out in front of strangers is really crazy. People piss on the floor and like, oh yeah. There's just like, it is intimidating to be, you know, as you're the height of the other people's dicks. Oh Geez. I mean your face is that their cognitive level? Yeah. Pull out. You got to go with Ellis whenever you're out with him, make sure that, okay, thanks. Don't just let them go alone. Pissing everywhere. You know, I'm just thinking about the future right now. Of course, my terrified sign of these monster Cox all over him, all over him, you know, and around him I kissed him on the head with it and stuff.

Speaker 11:         01:13:57       Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a bigger, it is a bigger issue. Let's keep our son's protected from these monster public dicks. It's really the jumbo as he liked to call yours. Jumbos he's something else, man. He is something else. That was really funny. Your mom really didn't like the, the shower that we took together. Got To really know. What I noticed is that she will talk longer about gross things. She doesn't like if it's coming from me. Right. Like we get a little longer of a rope. Yup. But when it's just you, she like, we'll hang up on you. Yeah. So in the future, this is a great tag team. Sure. Give it to me. Let me tell her the details. Yeah. Cause she'll, she'll stay on the line longer.

Speaker 7:          01:14:38       Yup. Uh, and for those of you watching on Youtube? Um, the reason that I handed the laptop over is because we were using, you hear us through the recorded microphone, but she hears us through the microphone in the laptop. So if you're wondering like why the fuck are they doing that? It's that, oh yeah. I didn't feel like at a certain point in that call though, she was like, y'all are y'all finished? Are Y'all done? You know, some respect. Yeah, she was definitely like put some respect on my name. Awesome.

Speaker 11:         01:15:08       By all of those. Well hold on a day. It was definitely what was going on Ma. I love you. Bye. I love you. Yeah, she was definitely, I know you guys are dying to know what's up with Betsy and her diarrhea. [inaudible] took her to the vet and they tested her poopies to see if there's some kind of viral whatever. And it's not that she is just stupid and she's eating stuff in the backyard and they basically said that yeah, the vet was like, you know what? Some dogs are dumb and just eat everything. So you have had to get a special dog food to offset the fact that she will just eat horrible things and give herself Dyer.

Speaker 11:         01:15:50       Ooh. Ooh, Mama. I love you mama alone practically in tears. My name here. You got two of them together. You all are we all finished? Are Y'all done?

There's this sketch that um, that I've, that I saw of that. Uh, what's her name? Elma. Is that her name or did it Elma. Gore. Yeah. Elma Gore did a sketch of him. Let's see. And um, I'll try to print, bring it up here. It's, it's, it's become very popular and I think in my mind it's very accurate. Um, as far as here it is here. Oh yeah. Right. Yeah. Uh Huh. Yeah, this totally, that makes sense. When you look at the in proportion to the body type where it's like the real small placid. Yeah. He's got a nice, cause he's got some weight on him and he's got a nice fat pad here and a, and it basically you just see the head kind of poking out when it's flacid and then it probably grows I think probably around four inches, you know?

Speaker 7:          01:23:34       Yeah. I don't, I don't think he's got anything extraordinary going on down there. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I would give him a little more length on that. You think so? Yeah. But the shape of it and the color and everything looks about accurate, I think. Uh, yeah, I think that's about it. I'm going to go with illness. Uh, depression. Wow. I think it's really accurate and you know, I'm not going to lie. It looks a lot like mine. Um, so that's, uh, it's kind of what I've been saying and I don't think so. He doesn't have any balls in that picture. I definitely have all their tiny, has walls are tiny. I definitely a balls. Yeah. Bigger balls longer hanging here. Guns, how full they are. Yeah, they get full sometimes. It's like your dad's, they're bigger. So gross. Um, so, but the, the problem with this episode of Dick Detectives is a, we don't get to ask Donald, so which is it? Cause that's how we usually like to play. I mean blue band. Do you want to decide who is more accurate? Is it a coke can and girth and short or is it what I saw there, that little head, the Elma drew and about four inches long. A Blue Band just gave me the point and the thumbs up, meaning I win this round. Wow. Of dicta tech

Speaker 4:          01:24:47       did.

Speaker 7:          01:25:01       Yeah. What kind of Dick, I mean, what would be your ideal Dick to have ideal, not one of these fantasy digs that you see, you know, in sex stores or on a few porn stars that are chest Garcon. I think that's too crazy. I think everybody would want, the ideal one would be like a little above average in everything go longer than average low girth here than average. Um, so I don't know, maybe like eight. It's like long, but not like what the fuck is that right? So eight inches long. And then maybe like where your finger, like your fingers don't quite touch when you hold it. You know, like mine, I can go like this and like I'm looking type, put fingers around it like four times. And then, you know, if somebody were to like walking on me I could just put like three fingers down and cover it. You know, what color would be an ideal penis color? I think like a deep purple would probably be the ideal color you see it sometimes depending your blood situation. But I think if it was like just deep, deep purple from from base to head all the time, that'd be an ideal color.

Speaker 11:         01:26:16       What, how does that happen? Is that one, it's just follow blood

Speaker 7:          01:26:19       I think. Yeah. I mean, and then what's going on with your veins and yeah. Yeah. And then what about balls? Balls? I mean, ideally you want probably pound and a half, two pounds each. Um, you know, cause nice, big balls are exciting to women.

Speaker 11:         01:26:36       And what about hair? Oh, heroin. So of course, careless naturally. Yeah, I'm sure even that thing up all the time. And I know it's such a hassle to shave pubic hair. I hate it. I'm so over it.

Speaker 7:          01:26:47       I really wouldn't, I wouldn't mind removing it all. Yeah, I know. Me Too. That'll be kind of neat. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:26:55       Huh. Interesting. Why don't you guys come at you? What's your ideal one? Yours is my ideal. Where we go. That's the loving answer course. Of course. Of course. No, no, yours is perfect. I really don't. I think, oh my God, it's not an objective thing. It's the person

Speaker 7:          01:27:12       this made me laugh so hard is the, yeah, it's here. So, um, we had this, you know, with the last few weeks we played the, the woman lifting weights and screaming. Yeah. And then we had the woman getting the Tattoo and screaming. Yeah. And now we have, um,

Speaker 8:          01:27:31       armrest, these, an armrest sometimes guys laughing. Wow. Dude, I can't even wrap it. You hear him? He was like, Hey, you're a rapper. She's so weird. Put your hands here.

Speaker 11:         01:28:15       Wow. What a weird Baird. Yeah. Do you think she does that to psych out the opponent or, I'm sure it's natural. It's her thing, you know? Yeah, it works

Speaker 13:         01:28:26       okay.

Speaker 7:          01:28:26       Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It definitely works.

Speaker 8:          01:28:45       So,

Speaker 7:          01:28:46       so good. That's the thing I'm looking for. Labeled everything again. Another one called everything. Okay. So this is a man. This made me so happy. Um, blue band put together.

Speaker 2:          01:29:29       what? Masterful work. So good to arm wrestlers, the weight lifter and lady getting the Tattoo screaming all at the same time. It's good shit. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:29:46       Which one's your favorite? Um, ah, it's so hard. This is Libby. I hate and love at the same thing. The taxi waiting. Uh, she's like, yeah, I know. Allen's great. Her face is so ridiculous. I liked the old lady in the corner. Yeah, the weightlifting. Now it's all good, man. You can't, you can't really go wrong with this one.
