I didn't even know you were in the room. That's I know how weird and apropos of the show. Yeah. Well cause we were took a shower together and I was Todd's in your kibbles and bits and I, and I was like, I don't know if we have time to really get one in or whatnot even suggest that.

Speaker 4:          00:08:30       But I was thinking it in my head. I go, I, I don't know if you have touch right again, you did participate in the shower and you're like, I gotta go in the shower. Ooh, really fucks in the shower. I mean now I can't, I'm on, my bones are all out of whack now. Okay. Anyways, I wasn't sure what the little bass, hello. And now I'm talking again, but you see what I'm trying to do. I'm just trying to set it up and it starts playing. I'm just trying to like place it. I wasn't sure my blue band would come over and I didn't know if we had time there. That's the story. Then you got out of the shower and I saw you in the bed. Well, I saw you go into the closet and then I saw you come out and then I was like, oh, at first, actually I didn't know if you were in the closet or not. And then I was like, oh, she's not in there. I didn't hear any noise. So I was like, oh, there's no one in the room. I'll crank one out. Yeah. And then I did and uh, uh, stuff happened and you know, and then I was like, no.

Speaker 4:          00:09:23       And I was like, do you want to do it now? Let's do it. We got a few minutes. Then what happened? Then you go, you can, they blew my note and then I say it like that. I already did it, eh, he got us Stip Dick Right after I tried to have marital Catholic love with you and you spilled your seed carelessly in the shower. Yup, that's true. You know what I was thinking to myself, I was like, dude, he's taken a really long shower and it's not like you, you usually, first of all, you don't really clean anything. Like you got to blow your nose, you shake around like a dog and then you get out. I was just trying to make sure I was, I was actually extra quiet. I should have been more.

Speaker 6:          00:10:05       Oh my God,

Speaker 4:          00:10:11       I should have done that. Oh Man. But I was, I was actually like, oh what a show. Cause I thought you might've been walking around. Yeah. And then that didn't deter you whatsoever. Where I turned myself away from the, it's a very, it's not the ideal bathroom for masturbating. No. Pleasantly No. Cause there's no door between the bedroom and the showers and especially once Ellis starts walking. I'm sure he's going to want to see you. We've got time. Okay. You can walk it in on your dad cranky when it, is there anything more scarring? Your Dad wants to remain a master? Nope. What that might be. The only thing I haven't seen. Then your parents used to like not really be big on clothes though when you're really young. Yeah, we'll we're European. Yeah. It was naked all the time. Everybody was nude and no weird.

Speaker 4:          00:10:56       No. I saw my mom naked all the time. And Your Dad all the time? My dad naked all the time. I had a friend come over when I was like 11 and she was like, your dad's naked. And I'm like, Oh yeah, daddy could put on something. There's a friend. He's like, oh, okay. Why? No. I think he first went, why? I'm like, why? Where would he be naked and the backyard. We lived in Canoga Park in the backyard and he liked to sunbathe nude. That was what he was doing is just always naked in the back yard. I should preface it by saying, and whoever was over whatever girlfriend there naked in the backyard, just sunbathing. It was very natural. And that doesn't strike you now as really bizarre though. No. Because? Because when you grow up with naked parents, no, no, but now you have perspective. So No. If Ella saw me nude, if I don't think I'd give a shit, I still don't think so. I don't care what it's not sexual. There were European babe and your pants are just naked.

Speaker 4:          00:11:51       Only Americans are uptight about nudity. No, I can't. If you're a European right in and let us know that it's normal, that everybody's naked, they're not going to tell you it's normal. What about my dad drinking a 12 or every night? I think it's normal for a man to be nude around 10 and 11 year olds and then, and then you go put on some clothes and he was like, why? Right. Well then that's the thing is that I had to tell my dad that that wasn't appropriate. And America, that you can't just be naked. Why it appropriate anywhere else though? I don't think it is. I don't think a Hungarian thing. I don't know. So, but then he started putting on like [inaudible] people were over and then eventually I became a teenager and then he covered up. Yeah. But when I became a teenager, he stopped.

Speaker 4:          00:12:37       But you're 10 and 11 nude walking around the house nude. Yeah, yes. Everybody in my family. Yes. My mother was naked all the time, tops and bottoms, tops and bottoms. I'd see my mom been really close her vagina like a ton of times. All the time. Yeah. It's just normal. It was normal baby. My mom had big soggy hangers. Topless. You said naked? Yes. She come out of the shower and she would be talking to me like we get ready for, oh, and then my mom would like run through the house and go to the kitchen naked to grab something as she was coming out of the truck. It wasn't like we were new this, but if somebody took a shower and then like had to grab something, another part of the house. So just crawl, you know, walked around. Well you never saw anybody charro top dog soon to masturbate.

Speaker 4:          00:13:24       Of course. That's like a very common bonding thing for most for most fathers and sons. America. No, I'm serious. But you've seen your dad's nuts and and dick. Yeah, but not a lot. And not on it, like on accident, like walking in and change everything out, but not, not with any regularity. Oh yeah. People just walk around. It wasn't, it wasn't like a lifestyle. Actually have another person in the room did tie normal. He crept normal. Well, yeah, we're trying to do, we're trying to establish what's normal. Right? American. Both Israeli parents, Shit. Israelis are nudists aren't they? Kind of, nope.

Speaker 4:          00:14:07       So I'm learning that my childhood was way fucked up. I didn't realize it. I'm 40 years old. What do you, what's your vote? I mean, I've seen, well, I'm not watching on my dad. How about the idea of nudity? Just kind of being walking around. That's weird. That's weird. Jews are funny. Well, I don't like if Ellis walks in on me changing, what am I supposed to? Oh no, of course not. No, but that's different. That's totally going to you. The difference is walking in on you changing and you being like, I'm just laying around with what dick out Saturday friend over here. You're 10. What's up? Like you don't think that that's, yeah, that's true. I never thought of it that way. It was so normal. Yeah. It must've really been.

Speaker 7:          00:14:52       Normally you, there wasn't like erotic. It didn't feel sexy or anything. I just, I didn't think he thought it felt sexy. It's my dad. I like how you take it there. Felt sexy. That's wrong with you. You're, my dad also taught me to shoot guns in the backyard when I was nine. That's a normal, yes. Okay. Yes, of course. If you're supposed to just checking. Yeah. Were you allowed to drink beer as child?

Speaker 8:          00:15:18       MMM,

Speaker 7:          00:15:19       no, I think but, but probably way before certain super conservative families, you know? Yeah. Like I had sips of stuff young.

Speaker 8:          00:15:27       MMM.

Speaker 7:          00:15:28       But I was allowed to drink, have a drink in the house with dinner. Uh, probably by the time I was in high school. Yeah. I'll see. That's good. That's normal. Yeah. I think that's not, not like I got like you're 11, right? Here's a glass of whiskey. Although that's when I was 10 when I had my first sip of whiskey, but it was a sip and I was like, I think I'm gonna throw up. Yeah. I couldn't believe people liked it.

Speaker 8:          00:15:51       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:15:51       All right. So who is this guy? Is that back home? This is David Beckham. And, uh, he's talking to the Dj Khaled about, uh, how long have your Dj friends? I want his jewelry so badly. You can, you can get on camera.

Speaker 5:          00:16:02       This album an uppercut in a knockoff. And I always wonder when you say these things core, you fighting when you call this a victory. Who did you defeat the fuck boys? And that's what's he doing now? You can answer the question. You can eat the wing. It's not the Olympics here. Yeah. But um, yeah, the fuck boys. The guys that try to give us roadblocks, those wings look good. Yeah. I want language. I know me too. For fuckboys. And what makes somebody a fuck boy, good question. I mean, this is a better word for hater. Mad people, bumps losers, garbage pizza. Shit. I like this guy going to hire you. Do that.

Speaker 7:          00:16:45       I like that. Can I tell you there's probably no worse premise for a talk show than eating as you're talking. That's also the hook of it. Not yet. And they eat increasingly hotter wings throughout. Yeah. It's just gross to watch him. Yeah, I know. And the hearing that right? Yeah. It's like listening to be smalls rab. He was always showing no, it's true. He's always sounded like he was eating that. That was just the fat of his mouth. She'll fucking fat. Yeah. Yeah. But anyway, uh, folklore, I think that's a loose definition. I still think it's in reference to homosexuals. Well, but it's actually encompassing. I think it's fair to encompass everything. Loser. Just say it more. Are you saying it more now? Are you in cut like in your visiting your lexicon boy. Oh, well, hopefully we can say more. Know what? I'm going to make a note of that.

Speaker 7:          00:17:33       Uh, at the comedy store, the Saturday, I'm going to incorporate the word fuck a boy boy to be jet stroller. Boy. Yeah. You don't want to cause a nonbinary fuckboy or is it binary? That's another great point. That's a maybe, uh, maybe, maybe there's your bit right there. Maybe that's the whole new bit. What, how should I be spelling? Fuck boy. Boy, boy. Boy is the way to go. But wait a minute. But boys are women that identify masculine. That's the whole, I would say f, U, C, c, d, O, y. And if you cc that's what's up. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well the fuck.

Speaker 7:          00:18:24       That's how you should say you're so handsome. Thanks. I do love you. Some days. Oh, Wednesdays where she would have done it with paint today. I know. I wanted to, I was, I was busy by myself. Do you make those noises? Sometimes. I was real quiet though. Thinking about Rihanna and where you like stay up off my Instagram. I was like thinking about sex with Rihanna loose. Be Amazed. You mean you don't masturbate to your wife? What? Yeah, I was like my wife, my wife or women dumb enough. Uh, that they think that can I have a cup of diarrhea please? People have been tweeting what's in the cup? It looks like diarrhea. Well, it's dog diarrhea and it's excellent. Liked it. And it was because we microwave it, we reheat it and then it explodes in the microwave. That's it looks, it looks like diarrhea.

Speaker 7:          00:19:24       It's not microwave. Not this particular cup, but mine often is and then it looks like it's splatter diarrhea. Oh, I got you. I thought you meant the color complexion of it. Oh, you mean sometimes he's just splattered heat. It too much you like. That's a weird thing about you. Weird thing about you. You hate hot food. Hate it, and you'll microwave this shit at a coffee. It'd be so hot. Have you drink? That's the only thing I like hot. It's so bizarre. I mean, you're always walking around with your tits out in front of our child. He's going to see him. Of course. He'd be like, mom, you don't. He's going to see dad's Dick. Dad's Dick. That's a great title for your next special. Yup. Did we have come up with a good one for you? Dad's dicks. No. Remember I was right before you left the other day. Something about my tits. Yeah. Slop or central or something. Sloppers cow. My tits are ruined. Not ruined. Anyways, what else? When we talk about the, the Americans we got into that show, Americans is great. Oh, wonderful. It's not mark and the American Americans is real good. Um, it's really something to find a show you can buy into that's really well done. Yeah. I'm really into highly recommend. Obviously a lot of people have watched it. This is the new way I think of watching shows. It's no longer about watching a show

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       as it airs all the time. No, I mean everyone's going to have the few, they do that with. It's what are you going to watch over time and, and, and buy into and it's gotta be, you know, really high quality because it's so competitive. It shows her so good. Yeah. Americans, I'm word nine episodes in the first season. Season One, I think there's five seasons. Yeah. It's phenomenal. It's, and it's really good premise. So people understand is Russian spies that are living here, uh, in deep under deep cover during the 80s, during the height of the Cold War. And they are basically trying to, they're giving the image that they are Americans, right? While they're acting for the KGB. Yeah. And it's men. But the thing is that alone is a good premise. So well layered. The show is, you know, with, with,

Speaker 4:          00:21:44       well, cause they're supposed to be married partners. KGB, yes. Partners and not be romantically linked, but they'd been going for so long and they have two kids. So the story is like, do we become romantically involved? Do we trust each other and then back and forth. Then Fbi, FBI, her storyline is so neat, man. I don't want to get back. Some of it I think historical, I'm sorry. Doggies historically accurate. Some of it is dead drops and all that cool stuff. I love that. KGB crap. I when I visited the Berlin Wall and they have um, uh, you know, museums purchase no checkpoint Charlie. And you can see how people snuck in, but when you went there, you went, it's in Berlin. Yeah. Where people are wearing clothes or I know the Europeans, they were they naked chicks and Ted said Berlin. No West. Yes. Mostly nude. Mostly nude or European? Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Well you ever been to like a European bathhouse? They're all naked. I've know. I've been to Europe, but you never went to a bad house where people go and they just sit around with your dicks out. I went to a semester of school and muddied. What about topless beach? Most of Europe you can be topless. It's not a big deal. Tits out. New to these. A little more

Speaker 1:          00:22:56       forgiving. Yes. The NF by a where I remember we watched, uh, the house hunters international. I'm always blown away by it when they go like, well, uh, we are, we're married and we have, we live in Connecticut and we have three children. Yeah. 11. Yeah. And now they're in school. We always kind of wanted to experience Spain. So we're moving there and you're like, wait, what? And then it's like kids are going to Majorca.

Speaker 4:          00:23:27       I don't want to go to my, uh, I want to see my friends and the not anymore. You don't, I don't even speak Spanish. You'll learn you're young enough to pick it up. Right. But in five years, right. So brutal. You do matter doing anything worse to small children. We're going to rip you out from your friends. Your school.

Speaker 7:          00:23:46       One kid was young enough in that family where like she doesn't know what's going on. The other two were like, fuck off my York and I don't like how I'm on set our norm. I want to go back. Yeah, of course. Of course they do. Well then an errors are like, they love it and it's like a small outskirt village too. It's not even like, oh city. What a nice expensive. That was $3 million to renovate U s 3 million. God Damn Man. What's the, what's Nice there in Georgia? But it's expensive, right? Like the euro is pretty good. They're not like Hungary. It's a little worse. It was. It was amazing amount of money they spent.

Speaker 7:          00:24:28       Could you imagine and they're like, it took a year. No, it took two years to renovate. They thought they were going to be all in their new year and there's nearly two years. I have no interest in renovating anything. I see. I told you do this. I want to, what do you want to renovate? I would want, I would want to, I have a fantasy of buying a modest home and then doing the major renno. I thought, yeah, I thought it'd be fun. Like tearing it down and starting. Well, both. I mean, obviously there's different levels of commitment at that point. Then money and what a nightmare. The thing is, La is so crazy for a housing market that, you know, you gotta do you have to do something out of the, you know, can I tell you why? No, just imagine the chaos. Like, you know, when you have movers, remember we were packing and you had movers come in and you're packing and the stress of like workers.

Speaker 7:          00:25:18       I know, I know every day, but I think the way to do it would be like, let's say it's like they did on that show you and you're in the house that you're renting, right? You'll have random place. Then you buy the other place and you start doing the work as you live in your rental. Yeah. So huge commitment. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then you end up getting into a place that you really love. That's true. Yeah. You can custom it. Well that one day when we have millions and millions, that's the thing is in most parts of the country you could do that without millions and millions. I know it's a fantasy. Well they go there literally are like parts in here. We just saw online this a house that was for sale and then the ad for the house was tear this down and build a house and the house was two point $3 million. So they're saying spend 2.3 to not Lisbon, tear this piece of shit down. They don't even, didn't even try to sell you on live. They're like blow this house sucks, but it's a great property. Then spend your money on top of that. See, but if you have that kind of cash, you're saying by something spasming, Rad and not, you know, or you could make something. I don't know. It all sounds like a nightmare. I have no patience for building things. No. You said that like your name was Pedro. I ain't got no.

Speaker 9:          00:26:45       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:26:52       Just like a black mom when you said that was really good. There you go. But I'll tell you, but that should do.

I love colors too. I get excited. Uh, Michael's arts and crafts, you know, you're really excited going in here. You know what? It brought us Aussies

Speaker 1:          00:31:02       to our attention. The you are obviously known for your art teacher jacket. Yeah. Somebody wrote in, Oh God, here we do the show. No, it's going to surprise you. Okay. They said was the guy that was actually like, it's upsetting because you know how emotional I'm going to get about this. Yeah. Let me show you. I want people to be able to see you watching it.

Speaker 4:          00:31:31       Aw.

Speaker 1:          00:31:34       We did not safe with Nikki Glaser. Yeah. Um, oh look how nice that I know somebody wrote in Tom Genes. Where to Tommy get this jacket from. I know. What brand is it? This is the greatest jacket I have ever seen. Much better than Tina's our teacher jacket. I must have it keep 'em high and tight. Lots of love from mom. Born on mom's trail. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:31:59       Oh Mel. I love Melbourne. It's mom born. Sorry. I love mom born. Tell me you are going to get emotional and we've been talking about this jacket for weeks now. Yeah. Months.

Speaker 1:          00:32:08       Actually, mm hmm. So here's what happened, man. I, um, I actually, you know, like a lot of things you going to like, I, I've always wanted a nice jacket, a nice leather jacket. You never bought one. Yeah. And not too long ago, I think it was December, November, December, I bought the jacket you're seeing in this and it was the most expensive jacket I've ever bought and that was 55 0%

Speaker 7:          00:32:40       off, even with 50% off the most I've ever spent. And I was like, you know, I justified it. I was like, yeah, you know, you've never gotten a jacket like that. Go ahead and buy that jacket. And then there's something about jackets that are different than other articles of clothing where they start to feel like they're part of you, you know, literally they envelop you, envelop you, but it becomes like almost part of your personality. Yeah. Right. The jacket, you become synonymous with you. You start wearing this jacket fit like a glove man. And I just, I absolutely loved this jacket and from the day we moved here, I haven't found the jacket. I've been looking. You mean you lost it? Well, I think I did lose it, but I wasn't sure you would have kept a better eye on it. It's a really horrible thing to say to me. Right. Number softy.

Speaker 10:         00:33:30       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:33:30       Number one, I lost softy. How sympathetic where you then sure. Maybe you should have sown your name into the tag.

Speaker 10:         00:33:38       Oh, I hate you so much.

Speaker 7:          00:33:42       This jacket, man. I talked to my, my whole shrink session last week was about this jacket. That's all I talked about was about losing this chat. Yeah, it's very traumatic. I haven't, I've called hotels. I just can't fucking figure it out. I know that the cause it, it just bothers me that it's gone

Speaker 4:          00:34:01       now. This is, okay, so we shot this. Is this the last time you wore that? Oh, I don't know man. I don't know if it's the last time. I don't really shot this like, right, right. Like I'm, what a month before we moved.

Speaker 7:          00:34:12       Well, I don't know if it was a month before it would get down to the details. I mean, there's certain things I know that happened where I had the jacket. You know? I know when I got my photos taken, I remember I had those. I had the jacket for that. I know that the jacket wasn't left there. I checked with her. I know that obviously I had it for this. I know that I had it at a couple local gigs, but you know, I remember leaving with it.

Speaker 4:          00:34:38       It's gone, but if fucking irritates the shit out of it. Let me tell you something, and you're shrank. Said this to you too. Yeah. Jackie Karma. You lose a jacket and you're going to gain an even better jacket. Just watch. You'll see it. It'll come to you. You're going to go to the same story that you got that at and you're going to find an even better deal and it's going to be great. Prompts me out. I know you have to let it go. You've got to let it go. Tom. The jacket's gone jacket like kind of tell you what I really noticed. Not so much this, but the hair looks great. That haircut is that Allen. He did that right before. And your beard. This is the right leg. Three. Yeah. Do you know that? It thinks I look like a fucking fat dog. Shit. But you look amazing. I had just given birth like weeks before Amy Hyde. You didn't know. Let me get fed age 10,000 years be you look, amaze. And this is nice. The color, the cut really nicely. How great that jacket is. I tell you why it's not nice because it's too shiny for camera. You look like you're about to hop on a motorcycle. I got that when I bought

Speaker 7:          00:35:38       my motorcycle. Are you Dean Del Rey?

Speaker 9:          00:35:43       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:35:44       Listen man, you just gotta let it go and sometimes you lose shit and you know, but you understand that bummer. It's a bummer man. Of course. I've lost a softie. Remember my, uh, my childhood pillow, I it on the road and then one time I left softy behind. And you still like to remind me about it that when we're in bed sometimes, yeah, kind of getting settled in. Do you remember when you left Softie, but, and you'll get really upset with me. Well, it's really, I didn't mean to leave her behind. I was an early flight that morning, a soft pillow. I've had it. So I was a child, I lost softy. I know that is irreplaceable jacket, you can replace that. My shrink told me, she goes, well, think of you know your jacket, like Jacket Karma. Like you're saying that somebody just, who could not buy that jacket just found it and was like, oh, this is, and now you gave it to him.

Speaker 7:          00:36:35       And she goes, how does that make you feel? And I go, well, as long as I don't see it. And she goes, I'm sorry. And I go, I mean, it's a fight. It's a fine fantasy. I can live with that. I don't see it. I go, but if I saw somebody wearing my jacket, I would be like, give him a fucking jacket. Of course it doesn't feel good. And she was like, Oh, I go actually had a fantasy that somebody tried to alter the jacket. And then I took a knife and I cut the jacket up in front of them. Oh Wow. And she was like, okay. It's how so those talk about it. That's really good that you're talking about your honest, a horrible impulses though. That's huge therapy to be honest about your shittiness. Like when I told her, I'm only like, if I'm suffering, I like it when you suffer too.

Speaker 7:          00:37:20       She has, she has like, that's really bad. But I'm glad you shared that because when we can get rid of that impulse in me, like if I'm unhappy, you should be unhappy. That's not, no. That's how, that's normal. That's not normal. You're not normal. And nothing's about the normal. Yep. Um, this, sorry. Listen, we're going to have, there's going to be a great resolution to your loss jacket. You'll see. Give it some time and first of all, even if you get it replaced, it's not going to be the same. It's not the same man. It's never going to be, it's over. It's already bought a replacement dragon. You did? Yeah. Where is it ordered it online. Is it the same? It's similar, but it's not the same.

Speaker 9:          00:37:58       Yeah. Let it go.

Speaker 7:          00:38:00       Yeah. I need a jacket. You gotta work?

Speaker 9:          00:38:05       [inaudible].

Speaker 7:          00:38:22       Ooh,

Speaker 7:          00:38:27       that's good. This is gonna blow your panties. I know, I know. And but switchbacks and are you today? Good question. Um, I am. Hmm, that's a good question. I'm feeling hungry. So I guess Tracy, your dad lay Tracy. Uh, yeah, but I am planning my exercise so that's kind of more of a to thing. Yeah. I'm feeling like Towanda today. I feel like I'm taking care of my kids. I got my shit right. Like [inaudible] has got her life together. She's got her life. I think twin has got her life together more than any of the other Braxton thing. So she's got a past like she's, I think she got caught even fever. Look she out now. There was a cop, a police mug shot of her, but did she doesn't do that stuff anymore. To what does a good girl? Well, what do you think of this? Like you kidding me right now?

Speaker 7:          00:39:33       What the fuck tone rumors are that Tony the, this, the real star of the Braxton clan. Now Tamar. But Tamar is really the breakout. No, no, no. This is legendary man. But Tamar is really popular right now. Dude, are we really going to have this conversation that you're comparing Tamer to Tony brand talent? But I'm saying in terms of popularity, right? Yeah, very positive. Very popular. I'll give you that. But by far the most, you know, no, no Tony Racks and there's no comparison there. Toni Braxton, I sing just like sophisticated grammy award winning with the real deal from the Braxton clean is Tony and the rumors that she and Birdman are dating some respect on my name that's crazier than shit and nobody, like nobody would suspect that Tony would be into super thug right here. But this whole facial tattoos stuff is out of control. It's real crazy, man.

Speaker 7:          00:40:36       She seems classier than that's my board man. Yeah. Yeah. That's, it's, it's alarming beyond alarming. Um, like I can see her with baby face there. She's always talking about him and they work together. Baby face. I don't know if the, as if is saying here that did Tony just confirmed birdman is her man. This says that they've allegedly been dating for months. Oh my God. God. Are you, are you sad? It's just, it's very strange to me. I mean, I could see that it can happen, but it's very strange. 48 year old had been spending time with Birdman on Sunday. He was seeing getting cozy, this is like a week ago at her grammy performance in Brooklyn. Um, there was sealed off, I guess they did a song years ago. Oh, they done? Maybe. I Dunno. I Dunno. It's just,

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       I would never think that, uh, that those two would be a couple. Especially when you watch that show, you see how she is, you don't see her. But you know, maybe he's like one of those guys who uh, you know, like every, every dog has a soft heart man. That's true. Tom, you don't know the bird man can be very sensitive. Yeah. An R and B, you don't know that. You don't know if he's just does all this, you know, shit talking, uh, when he has a lot of people around and the cameras and, but at home he's a, he's a real sweet bird. You never know. You never know. This is what the closed doors, they bread. I think I talked about it on maybe on the breakfast club. We'll see if they break it down for us. I love that movie.

Speaker 10:         00:42:22       Gotcha.

Speaker 11:         00:42:27       That is the thing that Toni Braxton is dating Birdman. I seen it and that they'd been dating for quite some time now and it's been under wraps, but they just recently where it together. I'll put some respect on that. Kobe is band last night too.

Speaker 1:          00:42:44       I don't know if that's all right, but I thought it was a little more insight than that. I'm just shocked having, like I said, watch the show. Uh, you see the way that she is doesn't seem like a match, but you know, sometimes you can't

Speaker 4:          00:42:56       predict will look. Sometimes the good girl likes the thug. You look at Whitney Houston. Yeah. And what's his name? Robbie Brown. [inaudible] Brown. Christina. Bobbi. Bobbi Kristina. Let's do it.

Speaker 1:          00:43:07       Is so much more thugs in that though. Real? No, I want to, yeah, he's got facial tattoos. Not just that man. This is the real thing. I mean, look, he's a CEO. He's worth the $150 million. So that makes up for a while. But I mean you can't compare a Bobby Brown, Bobby Brown was just, you know, the guy that was drinking and smoking and showing up late and that, that kind of, she's not like a thug. This guy has, you know, we'll come in with eight dudes and kick your fucking door down. Shit might go down all night.

Speaker 10:         00:43:40       Right.

Speaker 1:          00:43:42       I feel like he's already upset. That's right baby y'all are y'all finished? Are Y'all done? We're done kind of a, I dunno. I thought that was,

Speaker 4:          00:43:50       but they liked the thugs. The good girls like the thugs and Tony is so disciplined and so a straight, you know, if she takes care of her kid where you liked that. Did you like the thugs? You're a good girl. Yeah, and high school. Only in high school I had a boyfriend that had a competition with his best friend to see how long they could go without showering. And that was the only extent of it. And that's a bad boy to you. He was pretty gross. Well, that's a gross boy necessarily a bad boy. No, I, you know, no, no. I, I liked the people that treated me kindly. I didn't like bad boy shit. I don't need that. I don't have time for that. Ain't nobody got time for that. I know how to got down with that.

Speaker 1:          00:44:28       Um, real quick, we this a email here and want to read. Hey Hitler. Uh, I recently saw Tom's performance and Jack me off fill. It was even better than I expected. And shout out to Pat House who was fucking hilarious. I am a huge fan of the mommy podcasts and it's the only thing that keeps me sane when I'm staring at paperwork every work day at the show. I was sitting in the front row and at one point Tom pointed to me and asked me how my year was going. I replied and I was wearing them a high end type, but he didn't seem to want to bring up the podcast. You guys are awesome. I will always be looking forward to seeing your act. My question is, how do you feel about the crowd yelling out? Only things true. Mommy's would know about p I'd be honored if he brought this up. A PSM also poly and by um,

Speaker 4:          00:45:20       oh better you non-binary, respectful. The pronouns she day,

Speaker 1:          00:45:27       they and them will not appreciate it. I look man, um, first of all, always appreciate our fans that listen to the show that come to shows. People yell stuff out. It's fine. What I only thing I always try to, like, I think most people understand this is that when you go to a standup show, you're at a standup show. So just don't expect that that will be an extension or a representative of the podcast because it's just two different things. So, uh, you know, yeah. People yell stuff out from this show. Hey Hitler. And uh, you got my posey talking to me. All these things from the podcast and uh, you know, so it's just, it, it's only weird if somebody expects that the show, like the standup show will be about the podcast.

Speaker 4:          00:46:15       Yeah. I don't mind it. Like when I go up to when I'm walking up to the stage, I like it when they're like, yeah. And then it lets me know that there's mommies. Yeah. But then there's like one time where I was about, you know, halfway through my set and like a drunk mommy was like, you know, just yelling out all of our sayings top like yeah but now it does. What are you doing? Well what are you sure? I know like I was like what do you expect to happen though? Yeah. I don't know. And it doesn't want it. That's okay. In moderation. I think everything in moderation. Yeah. It's fine to be excited. That's my point is that the standup is just about like you're not, it's not about the, yeah cause we can't stop what we're doing. And then just like rattle off sayings from the show. Cause then cause there are people in the audience is also don't listen to your mom. Yeah. And they're like, but it's different. If you go to a live podcast will mean the, then obviously we'll look dressings that are not the podcasts cause people like in the middle of my cell and be like, show me how those big tits far and you like, I got to explain this for the other hand. Somebody did the, I remembered, I don't remember that

Speaker 1:          00:47:17       this guy's the interaction. I remember, uh, like a month ago I was somewhere and this guy goes a crazy lokes and I go, what? And he's like crazy lokes and I go, what about him? And he goes, what about him? What do you, what do you want me to do right now? Yeah. Weird beard. Like and then do you understand that there's like 350 people at the show? Yeah. So now I you want me to like I have to put it in context for everybody. You want me to do the whole for them to understand who that is. Like I would have to really spend 10 minutes just giving the idea of who that is.

Speaker 4:          00:47:57       Ports explain it. Like, dude, I, you know, cause one time I tried explaining that. Would you rather that we did? Would you rather be retarded or get dragged off by your grandfather on the Ferris wheel? The audience was not keen. Really half of them were like, ah, yeah, shit, I got to dig out of this hole. But it's because people that listen to this show, when you, you say something like that context is there. You don't have to, that's why I live podcast. Where you're talking about podcast up is going to be much easier to navigate. You know what, I'm just this totally unrelated, but what kind of bear do you think you are? Why? I'm looking at your beard and I'm seeing all kinds of colors and I'm thinking, are you grizzly or your polar brown bear bipolar. Are you a brown bear? I got, that was a really good joke. You did right there. Someone else's, Oh, I'm sure if someone said it too, but it's really I, it's appropriate. Oh, bipolar bear. Polar bipolar bear here by Polly Polly and by bear. Jeez, I'm a bipolar bear. That's it. You nailed it by volley there. There's no need to have a good discussion anymore. Chrisley what kind of barrel? Our Panda Panda's tower. Yeah. They're so cute. You ain't bamboo. You couldn't be a panda cause you're Jen's hall. I feel like with all the Brown, I gotta be a brown butter.

Let them know if you're, especially if you're gay and you're in the bear community. Okay, thanks. I'm in the bear community. Different types of bears or is it just stripped bear cub? I don't know hers. Why are you asking me is you have a huge fan base that's bear, but they don't tell me what the details are, but just days his post on my Instagram account. Mm MM. I love it so much that you have a bear of following. You mean a find one? I'd love to. Let's see these columns. I'll show you. Um, I'd say you're a grizzly though, cause you do shed a lot in the woods and you eat Saulman out of the river and you know you're more feral.

Speaker 1:          00:50:12       Okay. Mommy's listening to this week's podcast. Feeling inspired. Why stop with giving just tore city better names. The real mommy's need upgraded monikers. Tom Segura could be come shit poo poorer.

Um, it's a very, very sort of binary suggestion. Uh, oh, where's the, uh, uh, do you want to hear the ultimate vocal fry guy? Yeah. Uh,

Speaker 9:          00:51:12       oh, this, you know,

Speaker 9:          00:52:13       No, no

Speaker 7:          00:52:20       dude, it's ridiculous. Hey guys, that's got to give us the gall a run for his money. How do we find how to refine this one? This one was sent in, right?

That's how I found out. Yeah. He's a polar bear. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:52:41       Ah.

Speaker 7:          00:52:47       So stupid. I know. He looks like he's about to die to like some really unhealthy. You think this guy is unhealthy? Yeah. Yeah. Dot. Good. Cause he gonna die any minute and it's really not good. No. Um sure. Ride Day. Part Day. Where's the fucking thing we were watching earlier? Remember that the thing we were watching together, you're like that has to be played on the show. Do you what I'm talking about? Let me, let me see if I can find it myself. I got, I thought it were, oh it must've been something that just came up. I didn't realize that.

Speaker 12:         00:53:24       I don't know know.

Speaker 7:          00:53:27       See if I can wait, wait, where were we? I got it. I got it when you were in bed. Um, cause I thought it kind of, you know, made sense to play with this number now.

Speaker 13:         00:53:45       Yeah. In school system has told you all your life. Hitler was the most evil man to ever live. Unfortunately, you are taught lies and he most likely believed Hitler is very rarely accurately portrayed. You know, even Churchill once said that the victors write the history books, but we hear about Hitler through the media and the school says is extremely biased.

Speaker 7:          00:54:10       Oh my God. Oh my God. First of all, stop the lies. Um, or a VA. This antisemitic. Shut it down. Six gazillionaires. Oh my God. I mean, look, we have actual footage of Hitler saying killing the Jews, the final solution and now we have footage of him being a creep. Wait a minute. Are you disputing with watching this video right now and the people,

Speaker 14:         00:54:41       cause they don't want to. I'm going to tell you the truth, by the way, in this, at least in the intro, all the images of him or smiling or laughing, this guy's super nice.

Speaker 13:         00:54:54       This is why Hitler was not evil. In fact, he was the opposite of that. He was a very strong leader and a brilliant man. I'd off Hitler, truly cared about his people and his country that he institutionalized.

Speaker 7:          00:55:08       She's a real sweet voice. And then he was evil that they chose a little girl to narrate. Wait, but I'm, we're not going to see why Hillary is a good guy. Curious to know what the argument is. This cool video idea, was this in my sheet or no download boobs submitted. It was submitted. Okay. That's where I came. I didn't know where it came from

Speaker 13:         00:55:32       after on that. C is a slur for national socialist. National Socialism is a world view and philosophy.

Speaker 7:          00:55:39       By the way, I didn't actually know that until I watched this video. I learned that Nazi is, is an national socialism by watching a video called why, why Hitler was an evil. I had no idea. Oh my whole life. That, that's what that stood for.

Speaker 13:         00:55:56       Nationalism is the individual's responsibility twice the community for the country.

Speaker 7:          00:56:02       Yeah. And then I love you. Love the Jews.

Speaker 13:         00:56:07       Socialism is the community's responsibility and love towards the individualized.

Speaker 7:          00:56:11       I don't know that most people always define these words with love in the definition.

Speaker 13:         00:56:16       Basically the one who does the most for the community has the highest social status instead of the one with the most.

Speaker 7:          00:56:22       Okay. Uh, they use a picture of little Wayne laying on a pile of money. I think the people that made this might not be, um, racist.

Speaker 7:          01:07:18       More excited about his other one. There's another is the other trailer in here, these pieces of shit just get better and better men. Oh my gosh. And he keeps cranking them out. It's like woody Allen movies. One a year. Steven Seagal. The woody. Oh, more than one a year. That's the great thing about him. Uh, you know what we should do? I wish we could do this as rent out a movie theater and do like a rocky horror picture show with Steven Seagal movies and have just mommy's and we all watch it and make fun of it. What we're going to do something like that on patriotic. I'll first round. We're going to do that, like have a screening and we can uh, babe, have you not been here? No, no, no, but I'm saying it'd be funny to do it in a live theater. Merrigan happen, but I would want to, we don't do that. We can do that too. Yeah. And we can comments area and invite. We can do that. You know it's a pipe dream though, Tom. I Dunno. Not America. Okay. This one.

Speaker 9:          01:08:13       Awesome. When I raise your hand, you go up. When I raised it down, you go up. All of these things are things that manipulate. Those are all the things that really make for the old command boy. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:08:35       Is eating a sandwich right now.

Speaker 9:          01:08:37       I need that can successfully take out the next outcome. So

Speaker 7:          01:08:42       yeah, they don't even sound, they don't audio mix his trailers. We need some money and then they turn the music up. So as he's talking, this is a key point of this trailer and they audio makes it so poorly. You don't even know what he says.

Speaker 9:          01:09:00       Take out the next outcome.

Speaker 7:          01:09:06       Cut that trailer was like, yeah, it's ready to go and you cannot heal and he needs the yellow sunglasses. So you can't even see the expression in his eyes. There's no emotion being conveyed and you know the next year,

Speaker 9:          01:09:22       take out the next outcome. Condo, vocal fry guy. There was a woman, if she was irrelevant, you were ordered to eliminate everyone. This is what I would call unexcusable

Speaker 7:          01:09:46       inexcusable. I believe that unexcusable no, this is missing those trailers missing everything. I'm saying fuck a lot. I liked those trailers when he's like, it's just a fucking joke. Yeah, the fucking kick all your fucking acids. Well those trailers, two minutes 36 that's already too long or too short. If you're used to Seagal trailers. I like us to golf five or six minute trailer already, 50 seconds and we have no idea what this is about.

Speaker 9:          01:10:12       Nice to buy something weak. Something sentiment shit. A perfect, well I will.

Speaker 7:          01:10:34       I think I understand the movie now. What is it they kidnapped? They took that guy. Okay. And they're going to make him into like a manufactured warrior. Oh, okay. This like terminator. I mean they could have gotten to that way sooner, way sooner and they showed a lot of things that have nothing to do with that, but I think that's what's going on.

Speaker 9:          01:10:56       See now he's breaking out of the lab.

Speaker 7:          01:11:02       I'm surprised that the signed up for a movie where he doesn't play the central the weapon. He's not the guy. It's weird, right? Yeah. What if they're like, but there's no, you know why a hundred pound weapon, you know, it's because he needs to be the trainer, the teacher to the weapon. He wants to be the guys like I chore. No, he'll diff when the weapon gets too powerful, he'll defeat the weapon. Yeah. Right.

Speaker 9:          01:11:24       Yeah. Cause that was coming and questioning command. No one is safe. How are we going to be safe and is a target of time to making the ultimate killing machine as nights off, I'm exhausted. Aren't too many lives were lost. You get this thing.

Speaker 7:          01:11:52       Can you give us a stick to the script

Speaker 9:          01:11:56       says almost there. Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:12:03       Do you notice that he pulled out very clearly? You know something else about that moment and all the other moments we've seen so far in this. He's been sitting in every scene. Yeah. And then he trains a guy, he's like, give me your hand. Give me your hand. And he did this. You should go up. This makes you go down. You miss or

Speaker 9:          01:12:31       oh yeah. So he's fighting weapon guy. Oh boy. Here we go. Tell me what's the meaning of this truth to you? The only thing I know how to do,

Speaker 7:          01:12:49       the other bad thing about a great fight scene too, that they, you can tell they don't even, do you notice that Seagal doesn't take any hits on that? No. So there's no stakes to the fight. Great fight scene has a back and forth and he won't allow that. Has Ego would never, I think it's not even the ego. I think he's like, I don't want to move, fall down and stuff and get back up. So my hip hurts. Yeah, it's definitely because you're right. He never takes us single hit. No, no one kicks it. Like if you watch his old stuff, there was more like the original stuff out for justice. It was a back and forth. Right. But yeah, but you're right. It's cause he's too lazy to eat. Yeah. So we'll have him kind of kick your ass for none. None. None. None.

Speaker 7:          01:13:28       That just, okay. Cause this, and it seems so unbelievable. This is like the, you're right, it was like the fifth movie of 2016. It's all, it's only may. Yeah. He's gotten 10 movies out on bullying. Unbelievable. Jesus man. Fuck. And that is way that you're right. Way Too long in between, you know, the entire film. Horrible. The entire film. There's no, no. So he defeats the ultimate weapon. That's it. End of story. Jesus, man. Um, he really should lose a few though. I mean, look, what do you mean you're an action star? Some lbs. I'm a little confused. Uh, I'll play the fat and say, I've been talking to you a lot about this, which is like, you know, we think is one of those things where if, uh, if you talk about it a lot, we should do something about it. Yeah. And so

Speaker 5:          01:14:20       here's a little side show recently began producing its fifth year of content, something that we are extremely proud of. We're also proud of the community that's grown up around these videos. We've covered a lot of topics, both trivial and a profound, and

Speaker 7:          01:14:35       this is what sideshow, is that what it's called? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:14:38       Very hard to capture both our fascination and excitement as well as our chancellor. I took a hosting class year. You may have a chance to comment on. We think every single side show video asking us one question. We have ignored this question long enough. It is time. We took it on Lido. Johnny wants to know why does he have hair around his anus? Well, Johnny, the reef,

Speaker 7:          01:15:01       well they go on to explore this and the truth is that they said they really don't know. Right? We don't, we don't know. There's different theories in this video, right? One is that, you know, we're not evolutionarily perfect, so there's certain things on us that um, we just remnants of monkeys base. Yeah, I guess. And that they haven't evolved to the point because there's nothing keeping it from available. I told you why last week. Uh, what's that? To prevent the snakes from crawling up there and laying eggs. Everybody knows that. Snakes. What about spiders? Because if you're a hunter and gather, you're sitting on rocks, you're squatting and riverbeds stuck can crawl up there and lay eggs in your anus. And that's why it's good for scent. That's right. Trapping, trapping in there can also sharing the scent. If I go, oh, we want to sell Mel and I smell like when you put your nose down there.

Speaker 7:          01:15:59       That's true. Sharing the, this, I bet it's something sent. That's one of the theories. Yeah. It's interesting. Sent one. Well, people have been commenting back and forth to me about what I'm going to do moving forward. People were telling me to trim it. Somebody shaved it and trim it. So why not trim it? Because if you trim it the now it's stubbly and short and it's going to itch and agitate your asshole, even that's shaving is definitely going to do that. Yeah, but trimming and he go straight to irritation at least with shaving. You got a couple of days of nice and then it gets so waxing. It's kind of where we're at right now. But that's paint yet. Try Wax by wax a few times, see if that diminishes the amount of hair. And somebody told me it's going go really badly though. Why? Because you're going to chase you also gonna feel the sweat more because like hair prevents you, you know, it wicks away, clicks away you and you're fighting, playing live. I don't know man. It's a, it's an interesting conundrum. That's a big word we know. Wax Blacks on. All right. Um, what else do you got? Anything? Well, we're going to do that. You haven't pulled up or no, you have one point. I have one that I wrote, uh, pacifically for you. Oh, okay. Well let me see what I got here for you, dude. You do boop, boop, boop, boop. You got to keep it official?

Speaker 7:          01:18:01       we haven't answered you is because you know, despite the fact that everyone gets their own personal pocket sized supercomputer and then we can send robots to Mars and convert the entire face, law it to human use. We still, man, that was a lot. I mean, I appreciate the work that guy did, but that was, there was too much for me. You know what I'm saying? So you have a, what'd you rather?

Speaker 17:         01:18:23       MMM,

Then change a or then pick up a human shit off the ground with a plastic bag for life and keep it from like he goes to college and were like, here it is Ellis. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:22:08       peads is stank on it. You just ate pizza and it smells like that cheese.

Speaker 7:          01:22:13       That's different.

Speaker 4:          01:22:15       That's what I'm saying. You, you told me I had to up the second one, so I'm upping the stakes. It's smells. Smells like pizza. Yeah. So let's, yeah, let's get it as far as for a year. So let's, let's up the ante because I obviously I didn't make it severe enough for, you know, washing the beard and no trimming the beard for one year. Everything. You eat the flavor stand there now think about it. It's going to fuck up your relationship with me cause I'm not going to want to kiss you. It's going to fuck up your relationship with Ellis. He's not going to want to kiss you.

Speaker 7:          01:22:48       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:22:53       I listen to my dad then, but that's gonna make me suicidal. If he tells me the same story three times in a week, I go fucking crazy. I know. That's why I picked it. I know. It's good personal hell garden. I also hate when my beard smells like farts.

Speaker 7:          01:23:06       I know. That's why I chose it. It's really, it's interesting. I think that the smell is enough of a deterrent where I would take the psychological trauma because I know it'll end in a god buddy. David. Tell you the time at the Orlando Airport and see those, or at least funny stories. There's one thing that tells me, I know, it's like, it's gotta be mundane one, it's the same story. And he tells it to you like it's the first time for him. Yeah, buddy. I got to tell you a story. I was golfing the other day. Yeah. It's gotta be something real fucking, yeah. Yeah. I ever tell you about how they, that's how it usually is. Okay. I went, I know my friend George was a, he said his, uh, is that he's at the restaurant and he asked for the ice tea and they brought them all a water glaring is paying attention. You have to pay attention though. Fuck. Are you telling me the story for it? But you have to pay attention. Yeah, I know. I'm trying to. Um, it's, it's a good, it's, it's, it is good. Uh, I, I, and when you eat cheese, your beard smells horrible. Yeah. Yeah. It smells like shit.

Speaker 7:          01:24:20       Oh my God. Can we look at this for a second way? What are you picking? I'm going to take a, I'm going to take his,

Speaker 7:          01:24:31       I'm going to take the farts. The smell. Yeah. Cause I get, I wouldn't be able to tolerate a month. I think a day I might kill myself. I wouldn't be able to do it, but I won't kiss you for a year. I'll be like, Yo, come to kiss me. I'd be like, yeah, but you're, what you're saying is like, would you like some love and affection? Yeah. Or to be, or to actually think about committing suicide and killing yourself. I think, uh, uh, I think I would do that. I think I would take the lack of affection for, for a minute. You know, we, I cannot believe we haven't addressed this yet. This is really, really worth talking about. What, well, let me pull this up. Um, sure. Charlotte,

Speaker 7:          01:25:16       by the way, I tweeted that I started, but it was a false alarm. I didn't really sharp. You didn't really by far farted hard and I was alone. I was like, oh look, I, I startled a little bit cause I'm like, it was too brisk and it felt like there was a pub at the end of it and I just pooped later. But I did not sharp. Thank you for your concern. That's what, what are you telling me this for? I don't know cause I tweeted it and I just felt like it was relevant while you're looking for some, if you go on iTunes. Yeah. Jeff Tate, friend of the show. Yes. Hot dogs and Gatorade. He hasn't had a new album come out and I can't get a large image of it

Speaker 12:         01:25:53       but

Speaker 7:          01:25:55       oh, on his album cover command plus.

Speaker 12:         01:25:59       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:25:59       I don't know really how to make things bigger dude. And he did it. Hot dogs and gator aid. It's called Jeff Tate again. Just one of the best comedians working today. Okay. Jeff. So funny. Nominal comic. And He's put out a number of albums. His latest album is called again and it's him and it looks like he's at a restaurant or a diner or something. Right. Is that where he's at? It was, it looked like to you. He usually eats in the seven 11 parking lot, but yeah. Yeah. But he's sitting at a table and he's got hotdogs and Gatorade. I love it on the table. I mean you, you realize the implications of this. This man could have put anything on his album cover and this is a direct tip of the hat to your mom's house guys. So honored. Thank you Jeff tape. Thank you Jeff. Tape. Please go on iTunes or Amazon and get the album is called again. He will not disappoint you. I promise. He's one of the funniest dudes. Great Storyteller. Uh, it's just a hard working awesome comic, but he's got, he's got it hot dogs and Gatorade.

Speaker 4:          01:27:11       And for those of you don't know the story, Jeff Tate lived on our couch for like a week and change. Yeah. And I think he was going through a rough time and he was sleeping on our couch and we live next door to a seven 11 and I would cook and offer him meals. You know, he want some dinner. Nope. I'm going to get my own thing. And then he would come back with two hot dogs and a thing. I like blue or red Gatorade and that's all he ate for the entire time he lived on our couch.

Speaker 7:          01:27:38       Yeah, he was having a bad week. He was having a bad week. But that's all he ate. But then he is, but then we got to tell everybody about how Jeff Tate lives on hot docs and data and then he would have like a blue ring around his mouth cause that's, oh, and can you pull that up? There's a handmade sign. Somebody who made this for us one time. This is for Jeff. Yeah, there it is. Hotdogs and Gatorade. So good. So good. I thought was a great ride. Anyways, he's so funny. Amazing. And He loves Tom. Tom Petty, right? Isn't that, yeah. Uh, would you rather finally shit your pants in public once a year or subtly in private daily. Oh, I mean I almost do every day since my, I gave birth, but come on, I almost shit my pants constantly now. Right. But this is not about almost doing it. This is about doing it privately every day. Of course I'm here, I'm hearing a lot over once a year in public, you're talking about every single day you shit your pants. And

Speaker 4:          01:28:47       here's why this is psychological warfare. No, hear me. See the problem with once a year is it every morning you're going to wake up and go is today the day I have to shit my pants and public because of this. Would you? So you're

Speaker 7:          01:29:02       going to live in constant fear of shitting your pants in public and it could be an inopportune time. You're on an airplane. Yeah. Think about that. Yeah, you've got four hours on that flight, but it becomes who you are. You know, it's like the guy that wears a fucking a fedora everywhere. That's part of the outfit. You Shit. And your once a year, you know it's going to be a fucking party. Okay. You're going to have a great story. Guess what happened today? I went to except the congressional medal of honor and as the president and put it around my neck. I Shit my pants. Yeah. Why? Cause I play. Would you rather? Yeah. Cause I have two roles now. The psychological torture of it. Dude, I'm taking once a year in public. You would? Okay.
