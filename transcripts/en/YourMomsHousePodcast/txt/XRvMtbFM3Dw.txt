Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Well. Well, well go to your mom's house. Christina. Vincent,

Speaker 2:          00:00:19       thank you for gracing us with your presence today. My pleasure. Thank you for having me. It's been a while. It has been. You're the second guest we've had in three years. Whoa. That's crazy. Stop doing guest a long time ago. But then now we have this setup where like we should bring gas back. Yeah. Why not? Why not? Fuck it. Yeah. It's fun. You, we told you we had the uh, the water, someone ea here last week. Yeah. Uh, some people thought it was a joke and they wrote in like, Hey, uh, I turned it off. I thought that bit was going kind of on that a bit. Well, cause we play boring cliffs on the show sometimes. Yeah. And people are like, that was the longest boring clip. Yeah. Oh, that's hilarious. Yeah. When there's too many laughs, we'll be like, let's boil it down a little bit.

Speaker 2:          00:00:58       He'll play something boring and they're like, it's a long board. Got a peaks and valleys. Yeah. Lower the expectations. Slam at home. Yeah. So we had a bunch of people, but some people were, I would say most people were fascinated. I was fucking fascinating. I had no idea until I walked in here that that was a real thing. Yeah. And He um, he, he works at Patina, which is a restaurant downtown. I don't know if you've been there, but he created a water menu there. Yeah. So when people go, come on and you're like, yeah, can I have, you know, you ordered and he's like to drink and you go, I'll just have water. He'll be like, I'll be right back. And then it's a water menu, so you get to, he, he basically does what we were telling you. But you know, like a beautiful presentation and people start, if I went out to a restaurant, they had a water menu. I, it depends on how high am, if I was really high and be like, what's going on? Yeah. But if I was so bad I was like, fuck you. I'm a little bit worse. But if you're really high you might be like bringing on of everything. Let me try all this. You try your water, man. Yeah. Um, all right. We have an opening clip before we just think before we get into our irregular as, this is how we open our shows. So we'll play our clip and then we'll get into it. Here we go.

Speaker 3:          00:02:03       Around June the 21st when a Skype, when trance was skyping with me, uh, Brent spiner said, hey, you, who Taran so something's going on with Nancy McCaughan Hayes Penis. And what was happening was all of my men's penises were being attacked.

Speaker 4:          00:02:22       Nope.

Speaker 1:          00:02:25       Well, go to your mom's house, Christina courses.

Speaker 2:          00:03:07       Oh, I know.

Speaker 2:          00:03:13       What's this, Bro? What do you mean? I can be, this is, what is she talking about? Rational. What's the deal? There's one forest Whitaker I going on. Yeah. And there's also, there's something about crazy that does something to your, you know, the way you see eyes. And you could tell like if you're talking to her in person, you'd be like, even if he didn't say crazy peanut shit, you'd be like, something's up with her. Oh, yeah. Well, it's the, the, the gays that doesn't break. That's right. Yeah. The unknown. Blanking. Yeah. Yeah. It's a real indicator and sanded. It does a lot. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:03:49       There was a very serious, now where in the computer system at Church of Gail, it caused all the mandatory to gale to cause them to have all sorts of penis afflictions. It's very painful.

Speaker 2:          00:04:01       Church of Gail, I think that's her own church. Church of gale. Oh yeah. I think. Why does she think it has to do with Matthew mcconaughey? I Dunno, but she goes on

Speaker 3:          00:04:09       or deal with the penises lasted for a least a good week in that juice. Like from June 21st of June 28th they were just having this ordeal with penises because of Jesuit trigger programming on the Church of Gail computers. They spent a lot of time in sick bay. Uh, actively had them. Now I know at that point,

Speaker 2:          00:04:28       well like mad vagina. Matthew, his penis went inward. I think it's funny that she, she thinks that the Jesuits are targeting are usually, you don't hear them mention the you. It's a very affable, they're fun. Yeah. That was really highly educated college. Yeah. They like to drink. They like to party. They're not really into this stuff. You know what's interesting about her, if you didn't know any better, like if you spoke a different language and you listened to her talk, he'd be like, well, she seems to totally rational. Yeah. She's sitting there calmly, she's not, she's moving too much. You maybe she's an expert and like, right. Ancient civilization. How a lot of cons happen. I must, I'm assuming, you know, like I was watching that Bernie Madoff movie, the new one is really good with the Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer find what's called wizard of lies.

Speaker 2:          00:05:12       And they were just talking about how like his greatest skill was just people manipulating and he had this crazy thing where he was, that's the craziest part of was he was already successful. He was a really well off, was a multimillionaire and he's still, you know, uh, design this Ponzi scheme to extract so much more out of people. And they said, you know, because his reputation was such, and he was just knew how to talk to people. They're just handing over money, man in it to fuck people over. Like for the stuff, the fun reel of screwing people over all of it. Yes. It's a real super addicted to the cash. There's a great interview with him on radio lab and it's really interesting because they have to interview him from jail. And so when you call someone in jail, you can only talk

Speaker 5:          00:05:57       to them for 15 minutes and then you have to wait off the phone for 15 minutes for them to come back on. And then 15 minutes again. So they're interviewing this guy and these 15 minute chunks and it just cuts off at 15 minutes and they asked to wait and it, but he's describing this waiting and then as time went on he talks to made off more and more. It gets more and more comfortable. But the, the, the crazy thing about him is the complete total lack of empathy. None is no empathy towards the people you fucked over people that killed themselves. Like there was a bunch of people that just, one guy, which was really fascinating. He was worth $9 billion and Bernie was telling him that he had to give seven of it back. He called the guy up, he goes, look, the CEG is up.

Speaker 5:          00:06:38       Everybody knows. And apparently he, he thinks, or at least his rationale was that all these people, like the big high roller guys, they knew that they were ripping people off. They knew that there was no way you could always make money, that there was always going to be fluctuation. But like even in like the way they describe it, I don't really necessarily understand finances that much, but the way they were describing it is that in like every single move they made, this one guy wanted to make money every single, like there was never, you kid couldn't ever show any losses at all or this guy would freak out. And he had like, again, $7 billion in the mix.

Speaker 6:          00:07:18       That's insane. Yeah. Yeah. He, um, he said in an interview that when they were like asking them about, you know, you destroy it all these people lives. He was like, yeah, what about their culpability in all of this? Like, what? And he's like, well, you know, I mean, they, they, they have some responsibility and they're like, you stole from them. He's like, yeah, but they fucking gave me the money, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:07:39       Yeah. His thing was like, these people, these people are, they're not starving. That's what his thing. We're not talking about people in Africa, you know, we're not talking about starving. Villagers were just talking about people. His own son killed himself. One of son killed himself. This guy killed himself that we talking about the $9 billion guy. He killed himself because he won. They wanted them to give back seven.

Speaker 6:          00:08:02       She's like, I can't live with to fuck that. That's so funny. People's relationship with money. There was a, I forget it was actually, you might not have killed himself. Might have drowned. Oh really? Yeah, it might not. It might just took too many drugs, but there was a New York Knick, I forget his name, and they were interviewing him about, you know, these NBA contracts are bananas. It's fully guaranteed. It's one of the leagues that has fully guaranteed money. So not like the NFL where it's like you have this much guaranteed. The rest of that, you're not getting that shit. So NBA, whatever. Then you know there's salary caps and he played out one of his contracts and they're like, we want to keep you but we can't give you like top end money so you're going to get 9 million for next year. And then his first interview with the press, he was like, I mean, you know it's going to be tough, but I'll see what I know. I'll try to make it happen. And they're like, you're going to be tough to survive on that. And he was like pretty much, I mean I have a family

Speaker 5:          00:08:57       man perspective, man. People get crazy. Yeah, well yeah, because

Speaker 7:          00:09:03       going out, I mean, you know, I follow all these kids on Instagram like Cameron Dallas. Do you know who that is? No, he's like the sh the millennial hot shit. He's like this hot 18 year old boy and he and his friends, they just enter this business, you're going to die. They don't have talent. They're just like cute boys on Instagram. And they do these meet and greets where they meet like gaggles just auditoriums theaters full of like tween pre adolescent girls and their parents and they hugged them and take like chased pictures and millionaires Maley, he's on a dolce and Gabbana I know skillset. None. No talent. They follow them on Instagram and cute teen boys. Yeah. Yes. Hade to meet the people. It's, it's fascinating. So there's a, there's a Netflix show called uh, is it chasing camera? Yeah. And I'm obsessed with it now. The thing is that they, they're spending their money like crazy cause I follow them on Instagram and every week it's like, here's my new Ferrari, here's the new Lamborghini, I'm leasing, here's the new house I'm renting. And you're like, you're not even buying. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:10:02       I'll buy that house, dude. Get some equity on it. Yeah, they're just 18. Yes. But they're also like, I think they don't realize that that window of cute girls that were being cute and the girls being like, ah, it's you is very limited. Yeah. Everybody says that about Kim Kardashian. Yeah, I guess so. Right.

Speaker 7:          00:10:20       But they say they keep growing new ones. You know what I'm saying? It's like, yeah, like in a different strokes and they added like the red haired kid to make the show appealing. Again,

Speaker 5:          00:10:28       talking about the chase or the Kardashians. The Kardashians. So they keep the, so now Kylie's being groomed to, that's what keeps it going. It's because I think it's all about Kim. Really? Yeah, it's Kim and she is. Even though there's about her, there's a real mother mother like Chris Kim is like the matriarch of the, did you guys cover her fake ass kick ass photos from Mexico? No, I think I saw some of them. Oh well here's the deal. They always hire their own Paparazzi and the Paparazzi pretends to just casually catch them taking pictures. But in Mexico there was real Paparazzi waiting along with their fake Paparazzi. So they're fake. Paparazzi takes the photos and then they edit them and they smooth out all the cellulite and all this whole shit doesn't have it. I mean, yeah, I mean it's normal human part of zoom, especially if you're a big fat ass like that.

Speaker 5:          00:11:14       It's made of fat, but it's, it's a fake fat ass and it's super obvious in the new pictures. Look at the Greenlee. Yeah. Get your life. Got Real one. Like look at the ones on the left. Like where in life would you app? That's a tumor, right? Right, right. That's a full diaper. Yeah. Diaper and internal is, yeah. I mean your legs are so scrawny and then she has this giant enormous, but so what they would do with Photoshop is stretch out the thigh to meet the ass. So it's, it doesn't look so fucking so was this like a yeah, that one doctored. We doctored ones and make it look less. Right. The real one. It just looks like chess. Hilarious. It's like, uh, it's just, uh, like that. What the fuck is that? What is that? What do you do in your assets? So rose, it's so crazy, but it's so nuts that someone wants to do that to their body.

Speaker 5:          00:12:11       Like she's stuffing something in there. I don't know what it is, but there's no way in nature you would have those skinny ass legs like that, that are total unathletic legs. The legs of someone who doesn't work out. Yeah, exactly right. There's no muscle at all and nothing. I mean, I mean, she maybe works out a little bit like we go to scrawny arms, but she's not an athletic person. You haven't asked like that. You should be able to jump over the moon. Right, right. That's someone who can do hurdles, but she's kind of good weight, but she looks good everywhere else. These are all Photoshop. Let me, it's hard. I mean, it's hard to say. Everything is fake. I mean, when you say she looks good, it's like, yeah, she's not fat. Right. But yeah, but that's it. Everything else is just, all surgeries definitely is a fake as fuck.

Speaker 5:          00:12:56       Yeah. I mean that's her whole thing. She's known for her ass. Like Jennifer Lopez has a legit Latina ass. Like that's her real ass. Her legs match that ass. Take a picture of, you'll go get me a Jennifer Lopez, his ass. She's got those big fic mommy thighs. Yeah, I can dig ass. That's all there. That's real. You know, you look at that and go, Ooh baby. Yeah, that's real. That's a real big juicy ass girl. Yeah. See how her thighs are so thick. They eat the ass. That's all proportion. Yeah, 100% that's what it's supposed to look like. She's a dancer. Classy. I'm on, but yeah, you're right. That's dancing all fucking day. All our lives a week. Yeah. That's an athlete's ass. That's a girl who can, yeah, you do. That's a girl who can bounce around and move and you know, I mean, can you imagine if you had to watch Kim Kardashian dance on the stage, you know those little spindly legs carrying that diaper around? It does look like full baby died.

Speaker 5:          00:13:59       Totally looks like. See that's what an ass, a big juicy real as it's supposed to look like. It's not preposterous. It's just outstanding. Didn't know she had a butt implant. She's got something to go on more than one I would say that's it. There's a photo there that has the the two of them side by side. They just curse her it over it right there. That's Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashians. The one with the white right here, here, here, here. See the one on the left is Jennifer Lopez. That's a real ass. One of the right is Kim Kardashian, is it? Yeah, when my ass obsessed and spent some time doing other shoes down the wormhole and it was a very bizarre thing. It is. The attraction to shapes is very bizarre to like like fake tits. Like we know they're fake. That always astounds me like it's not

Speaker 8:          00:14:52       that they look like bigger breasts, they look like big. Fakers did different things. Some guys, some goats. Yeah. I mean some guys meaning it's a ton of guys, but some guys make that distinction like definitely not into that. I mean you've said this before is that you'd prefer hungry tits over big fakers, hungry, hungry little ones need to be fed. I would rather give spoonfuls of pasta to those hungry tits then. Yeah, I don't like big fakers man. There's something weird about them for sure. It's not a trick. I will say a really good job of fakes like you can. There are some magicians out there that create amazing, like they still look. You still go like, oh yeah, those look good, but I still prefer real ones. I don't know. I just liked it more. There's also body dysmorphia thing because when do you, where does that look? Once you have a baby to your tits, get mushy. That's it. That's just, it's nature. So what should I do? Should I get hoist him up? Should I have them reduce? Talk about it. First of all, he does shit to yourself with no one would have kids and our population is going to die off.

Speaker 8:          00:15:57       It's true quiet Jesus, but it's fine to let you know. You got to surrender. It's also part of life, man. Yeah, for sure. The trade off for making life, it's now, are these real or are these Lakers nutrition and thighs into fitness? I'm a clean and healthy for date. There's surprisingly a lot of nutritional benefits from me to seaman. Some of it can get to read out to you now. She eats a lot of calm, teaspoon contains over 200 proteins, several helpful bits, mints, calcium chloride, citric acid. See Sodium and think, wow, that's a not in the shot.

Speaker 8:          00:16:49       Kids on Youtube talking about it. You can come. Yeah, we should all eat come. Well, what I like about this, because we've had other come eating clips on the show is the science that this woman is put towards it, that she's a fitness expert, which is kind of neat. We don't often have experts. What does that mean though? Fitness expert. And you can just say you are being a little bit yeah. And a life coach. Anybody can say that there's on certification sports bra and then you're like, I'm a fucking fitness thing is a weird one. Anyone can sign up for that shit. I was watching a Anthony Robbins Instagram stories. Tony Robbins is in, he's in Australia and he gets out to that, uh, was, was um, black Ip song. Tonight's going to be a good night and he's out there, you're assuming is clapping with his big fucking Frankenstein hands and he's like, stop it around on stage. But it's all like, it's, it's like he's, his energy is kind of forest and he's got,

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       he's a little too wide around the waist, which means eating a little too good. Living it up a little too much. It's all just, we're all excited. Okay,

Speaker 8:          00:17:58       we're going to prosper here, Huh? I mean crazy. And it says one of the photos I saved the photo because I was laughing so hard. Uh, I saved it

Speaker 2:          00:18:10       for me cause it said savage is a picture of him and he's dancing around clapping and it just says savage. I'm like, settle the fuck down buddy here. Where is it? He uh, by the way, that life coach thing, but

Speaker 8:          00:18:26       savage, that's what his Instagram story. Why is that savage? I, it's it with his hands in his pocket, but this is all his dad bod. I like Tony Robbins a lot, but the fake energy thing, I, if I went to his seminar and he made me fucking stand up and do jumping jacks every five minutes, I blow my brains out that stuff. He's like, yeah, he's a fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:18:54       it's a giant, giant is him or whatever. He actually has a pituitary, even the jaw, you know the facial features. He has like a very mild form of it and I think so of the giant hog probably part of what his confidence, his or her. Sure. Every time and every time he's probably meeting with his team and there's enough push back on something. He goes, let me show you some stuff. That role in carpet and was like, look at that thing. Slaps that thank Donald Interns. Like he's got a point and hold up pizza dough. Yeah. It looks like one of those. So Cinnabons you buy at the grocery store. Those are good. Good, good. Look how thin you are, pastor. I've been working at Berwyn right back by the way. Um, so that, that whole experience

Speaker 8:          00:19:49       shaking come full. She demands, I know it's a friend, it's a friend. He's like, I'm not in a relationship with friend did this for me. Nice guy. Well listen, I would say honey, I'll come in the, but honestly the best way is to just suck it out that we get it all. I mean just for your sake guys wash. Yeah. I know this is important. I'm not into watching people eat comment. No, it's weird because outside of porn it's disgusting. I think in porn, by the way, when it's like eight dudes in the glass is fucking gnarly favorite. I have those boot like this, have them all bookmarked. It's not enough guys guys.

Speaker 2:          00:20:36       Oh, the real savages in porn who are these like Ah. And they like, they keep it in, then it's like no big deal. But you can also see in the faith or you can read someone's when they're like, why didn't you see that? Yeah. And they're like, if, if, if the flincher yeah, that's the fake enthusiasm.

Speaker 9:          00:20:51       Well, yeah, I mean normally, but you gotta think the ones that are really into it, like, no they're not. I mean, you've gotta be so fucking damaged to be like, I love eight of eight guys. 10 guys, chase. Oh Mommy can give you an idea. She's getting close to the camera. It, it smells quite mellow. Smells like bleach kills the, I don't even more benefits to drinking semen for women because it's a depressant because it contains Melatonin. Oh, I can just take, get that for vitamins. All right. Ooh, I just got the chills for real, but oh Jesus.

Speaker 2:          00:21:37       Dripping and nasty salty. Surprisingly so. It's not surprising. Let's see the, if everybody is a guy who, who's the, about what they're writing. I produced some of my aunts, semen videos. Watch. Give me a call. If you ever need some straight from the source to tap. I hope you at least give the donor a hand job. You Selfish Twat.

Speaker 9:          00:22:04       I have lots of,

Speaker 2:          00:22:05       see what I can unload on those big breasts. Jesus. Why not disable the comments? She so rocking. Would you date her knowing she's drunk? She's drank so many cum shots. Yeah, of course. Yeah. I'm curious, are you still have a whole bit about that? Yeah. Know about, uh, I dated a girl once and she told me that when guys drink a fruit juice, especially pineapple juice. Oh yeah. It makes you calm. Tastes better. And I was like, how many dicks do you have to suck for you figure that out. Yeah. No. What's not wanting to asparagus? Not Good. Okay, let's try roast beef.

Speaker 2:          00:22:42       The idea that you, you've figured that out through trial and error, like there's something really delicious about your coming today. What's different? What did you have? Let's go over my diet to do an autopsy of it too. Oh, I drank some water and pineapple at lunch. I get some water from Hungary. That helped. Did you? One thing I don't think you, you got to see throughout there was a four month build up basically to the weigh ins. The Barista who is fat Wayne's where we were. Bert Kreischer Knight came on you. I did see a little bit of it on Instagram and on Twitter with the Hashtag bird is fat saw. Awesome. Did you see how, I mean like we had, I want to show you this. This is like people would call in or like send in videos saying Burdis fat in different languages. Oh my God, this is amazing.

Speaker 9:          00:23:28       Why is twice the so far Harbert Rawer Cordova, Luxor, good birth Chrysler is Bert Kreischer. You are a fat cards you off that Nick, they and Tom Secura might

Speaker 2:          00:23:40       and then this was my favorite thing. This was amazing. People

Speaker 6:          00:23:46       that listened to the podcasts that teach English as a second language would use the whole fat battle to teach English abroad and in different countries.

Speaker 9:          00:24:02       The Pan India slur you, you want to go, oh my God, Oh my God,

Speaker 6:          00:24:41       is this freak you guys out when you see how popular this is. I love it when, when, I mean there was, I remember the first time we figured out that anyone was listening, it was back when we were with red bands, so this is like 2010 or 11 2011 and we were doing shows and we put out a thing like hey tweet this. And the first time that we saw like the next day that it was pages of people tweeted that I was like, oh there's actually people. I thought there was like a hundred people listening to this thing. Yeah. I mean, I didn't have any idea of it, but when they got to this thing and they're coming in from different parts of the world and then we did a thing of, hey mommy, thanks genes where we'll go through where you just say that to like the, the teller.

Speaker 6:          00:25:18       And then we started getting submissions from all over the world. Follow police people in the squad car, the squad car pulling people over. It was, oh, we had a cop to it. Um, he ordered his whole like on, on the job, you use all the inside language to order it and he's in uniform and like it's just bananas, man. Yeah. It's weird. I'm like, you know what I like is the, the silliness of it. Like the fact that all over the world, something that's stupid. It's a shared joke. Yeah. You know, like that's what I like stupid.

Speaker 9:          00:25:54       It's fat. Yeah. Like

Speaker 6:          00:25:57       hundreds of these men, like hundreds of them. Yeah. That's really nice. Yeah. It's strange, right? This whole podcast thing is very odd. Yeah. Your podcast by the way. Like I remember doing, I'm on like I think episode three or five of your podcast. Wow. Like somebody sent me a thing. Once they have, they have like it documented all the episode numbers and they're like, you're on like the one of the first five or seven and I remember it was on your couch in your office at home. Yeah. And you kept telling me to sit forward. Yeah. The couches weird couch. Seems like it's a good idea but it's a terrible idea. But I wanted to ask you who gate, like I remember you said that you liked the opiate Anthony model of like just talking. Yeah. But how did you, did anyone else have one where you're like, oh, people will listen to this? Like did you like were you thinking of someone else's

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       podcast? Like how did you know anybody would listen to one? I think Adam Carolla had a podcast he had at that time. I think he did, but when he had it, it was like a radio show. He did his like a radio show still does. Right? Yeah. Well that's, that's actually is downfall now I think. Really? Yeah. I think people get, they don't want to hear commercials that are 15 minutes. Right. It's not necessary, you know? And uh, I think, um, I just like Dell opie and Anthony had just people come in with no structure, bunch of comics and just hang out and start talking. Did you ever imagine like that your podcast would be like where it's at now? It was crazy, man. It is really crazy. There's no way I could have imagined it. I wouldn't have believed it. It's so nuts. No, it's just, yeah, I just just thought it was fun to do.

Speaker 5:          00:27:29       I mean, and like people mentioned it to me all that like when I, when I'm in an airport, they'll, you know, they'll mention they're like, it just still happens though. Even mentioned the weight load, but like I saw the way last podcast last week and got one episode got more than 6 million and the other one was like close to 7 million. That's nuts. Downloads. That is not, that's then the, and then there's youtube views on top of it. Yeah. Millions on youtube. Yeah, it was amazing. How did you know, I mean, I think I remember we heard, oh, Joe's doing a podcast. Well, what is that like even hear about something? Well, I started doing it on Justin TV, which was like this, uh, online webcasting thing way back in the day. And what we'd do is we'd do it live from the green room and Joey Diaz would always get mad, shut that fucking thing off.

Speaker 5:          00:28:14       We'd have a laptop and we'd be streaming from a laptop, like from the little Webcam. So we'd have a little what it was back before laptops had webcams built in. So we put a little webcam on top of it. We talk and people would like, and you were doing that before all this? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. That was a long time ago. And then, um, that was probably like 2003 or something. Whoa. That's really long ago. Yeah. And then, um, when I got back from Colorado, it was kind of bummed out. And, um, uh, I had to move back to California because my wife was pregnant and you know, we couldn't live at altitude cause we were like it in the mountain. I went to that house, I was so happy up there. I remember that I went to there to that house when you were checking it out.

Speaker 5:          00:28:54       Yeah, we were doing, we were doing comedy works. That's right. And we drove up there and um, and it was like up this crazy road and you know, like, like a narrow mountain road. And at the very top it was like, it was beautiful. Well for me it was a perfect combination. Uh, like it was the perfect balance for like these shows where all these people and the UFC, all these people then up there just nature and quiet. I was like, oh, this is what I need. I need to balance myself out. Like just to have enough calm so that all this craziness sort of makes more sense. Yeah. Yeah. Now. Um, so the show, the podcast, obviously it's gotten bigger and bigger. We've been talking about, cause we all know people that like you were a well known guy when I met you for sure, but you've gotten considerably more famous but you're not a crazy lunatic.

Speaker 5:          00:29:43       Yeah. How does that work? How does that work? You think? I don't know what I mean. Like we, we, we all know people that like can't handle fame well. Well I do a lot of really difficult shit outside of comedy. I think that's part of it. Do you think so? Yeah. I think part of it is, first of all, I have zero obsession with fame. Like if all my fame went away tomorrow, yeah, I'd be totally fine with it. Um, as long as I have health and as long as I could pursue my interests, I'm 100% fine with it. Yeah. I'm not really interested in fame. I'm interested in doing a good job. Yeah. Like, I know that when people come to see me that I have a massive responsibility and I work hard on my stand up and I work hard on my writing and if I have a bad set it will fuck me up for months and it'll make me like batten down the hatches and grind harder.

Speaker 5:          00:30:28       Like I don't take it lightly at all. Right, right. So that's part of it too. But it's also, I do a lot of different stuff. Like I do yoga, I do Jujitsu, I do archery, I do a lot of working out. I said I've been running recently, I do difficult shit. And in doing difficult show you get humbled. Like you're always getting your ass kicked. Yeah, I run them the mountains near my house. Yeah. It's so fucking hard man. Like every time I do like, I know like that there's people that can do it way better. I know there's people that in way better shape and I know that I, every time I do it I get a little bit better and so I just keep pushing on it. Yeah. So I just concentrate. Excuse me. I just concentrate on, on doing difficult things. Do you think though that, sorry, go ahead.

Speaker 7:          00:31:13       You say that that's probably way or way healthy thing of doing so basically you're saying that I'm not focused on my ego and making me a bigger star, more famous, more famous. That's usually what people do, right? Like I got to grow this thing. You're focused is external, which I think is better as a human being.

Speaker 5:          00:31:30       Yeah, I think it's definitely better as a human being. I think the, I don't want, I have zero focus on being more famous. Zero, right. I pass on everything. Like as far as like doing talk shows are doing magazine articles or interviews, I pass on everything to Shit I don't do so do you think maybe the, that these people who don't handle it well, it's that their whole focus becomes just that they're like, may we hear about them too much? Like Amy Schumer is a perfect example. You hear about her weight too much. Like there was this big Google story. I pulled up my Google, this is a story about her breaking up with her boyfriend. There was a story angle that she broke up with her boyfriend. Like why the fuck is that a store? Right? Cause everything's a story because she's probably got a publicist.

Speaker 5:          00:32:10       The publicist wants to make sure you get your name out there all the time. Guess what? People get fucking sick of hearing you. Oh yeah. So if people want, and I'm sure if people are sick of hearing me too, but if you don't want to hear me, yeah, it's easy. Yeah. It's easy to not hear me. Like you got to go looking for me to hear me. I shake. The more you put yourself out there, especially today with, you know, it's, this is, we're not talking about the 1990s like with social media, it's so easy to get the word out for all the different things you want to do, that there's no need to do all that other stuff. And if you start doing all that other stuff, I mean, you can gain a few new fans, but you also get annoying. Yeah. You know, we all know, we all know people that are just overexposed.

Speaker 5:          00:32:53       You know who taught me that? Daniel Tosh. I was about to bring him up. I was about to bring the best. Yeah, and he, he has that thing. He doesn't do talk shows. He's the best. We talked about it at the Improv and he made total sense with me and it really, really like cranked home. You know it. You're like, wow. Yeah. He's like, yeah, I do. I don't do anything. He goes, oh, sorry, go ahead. No, just like he was just like, I'm already famous enough, right? Yeah. And he goes, he goes, I'm doing an hour a week on a television show where like they get to see me on TV, so I don't need to do more than that. Like there's millions of viewers watching this thing. The thinking bank, those who like me are already engaged with me. Why am I annoying the rest of the world if you're not into it?

Speaker 5:          00:33:34       Well, my podcast built up 100% from someone telling other people. Right. 100% I didn't do anything to promote it. I've never done anything I've never done. That's banana. Yeah. I had one big bump when rolling stone did a story on me and that was one of the most uncomfortable weeks. That guy following me around and hanging out when it's staring at me and writing things down like oh yeah, it's like weird. But that did give a a bump though. Yeah, that was a bump for sure that that gave me a bump. But all the other bumps or just it just, it was a gradual, slow sort of escalation until about maybe two years ago. And then it just started really ramping up like ridiculous. Like yeah, many millions more per month, every month, millions more. And then just started getting scary. We always referred to like when a, I'll talk to other people about it too about your model of, um, cause I feel like it's definitely one of your ideas just to hit them with content.

Speaker 5:          00:34:26       In other words, just put stuff out there all the time. Cause that's like every week. I mean, I'll just be on Instagram and I'll see you. You're like this, you had a physicist on and you have a comedian on and then you have a fucking hunter on and you're just like, well, I'm just putting stuff out there and then whatever you want consuming. But it's also honestly, it's selfish because these are all just people that I want to talk to. Yeah. So like if I at Lawrence Krauss in the studio who's a theoretical physicist, I have questions I want to ask him about the, you know, the birth of the universe, what he thinks the, the boundaries of, of infinity are and all these different and fascinating people. So I have these one on one conversations with no interruptions for three hours with someone who you would never get a chance to do that in real life because if you were at a dinner table with them, they would get up to go to the bathroom.

Speaker 5:          00:35:10       They checked their phone, other than people would chime in and someone else would come over this as your own conversation, just you and them alone in a room just staring at each other. And you get, you get an education through that. I've got, I've become a much better conversationalist. I think I understand people better. I get, I understand motives better. I understand interaction better. I understand ego and understand all kinds of weird stuff you pick up. It's like chunking, you know, you just sort of recognize patterns in people and you start applying them. I just have a much better understanding of myself and of people and a an end of being a good conversationalist. Yeah. You've got your definitely highly skilled at it now. I mean not that you weren't before, but I mean I think it's obvious like that that's a skill you develop because you work on it all the time.

Speaker 5:          00:35:56       What's crazy? Cause I never thought it was a skill. I never, before I started doing podcasts, I would never thought being a conversationalist is a skill. Yeah. I would've thought, yeah, you just talk to people. You know, I notice it more like a, somebody that does podcasts a lot. When I watched, especially if I watch a television interview, I can tell or I listen to them. Like on the radio, I can hear that, oh this host is a give or like a gracious host. He's letting his subject, you know, say what he has to say. And then I can also feel like, oh, the host is trying to dominate. You pick up on it. You know, like you're like, oh this, he's making it about himself all the time. That is an issue with people. Like sometimes someone will interrupt a really good story and take a side track where they talk about themselves.

Speaker 5:          00:36:40       Like they have an opportunity to talk about themselves, but you're in a middle of a story. Oh Brian, you've done this. Yeah. Yeah. And it just becomes a real problem. A lack of awareness and a clumsiness can really sabotage and throw a monkey wrench into the gears of a conversation. Yeah. And it makes it real awkward cause the other person is aware of it and they're trying to be gracious and get through it. And then you know it just when someone else is talking, when two people are having a conversation and someone else is just kind of like clunky like it, it affects the way you're able to communicate. So like as a host of a podcast and you having a conversation with someone, part of the skill of it is like trying to figure out how to get that person the most comfortable and the most relaxed.

Speaker 5:          00:37:25       And then the most like I asked the questions with the enough economy of words to get them to express themselves the cleanest. Right. That's why I don't like participating in or listening to podcasts with too many mics on them. They get rough, they get robbed, it's too much and, and, and, and usually what happens is at least for me as a listener of one of them, I'll be like every interesting point that I was looking forward. Like I can hear coming gets derailed and like taking them like, well watching CNN sometimes and there's like six people on there. I just want to hear one, one person, dude, I don't want to hear all this. It makes me nuts too much. Does like nine. Sometimes it's too much and they're all, they're all just like trying to get their sound bites in there. It's so obvious.

Speaker 5:          00:38:14       I was watching something on Trump the other day and it was, it was just fucking gross. What do you think of what the whole current state of things with Trump, it's what happens when you get a guy who does not understand what being president is and is used to running businesses and then all of a sudden you, you let them run the presidency and he's trying to run it like a business. He's firing people that he doesn't agree with. Like the, I didn't know that the president could just fire the FBI chief like that. I didn't know it either. But like when he fired Comey and it's like the guys are, he's a real pain in my ass and this investigation, like what I get. So obviously obstruction of justice. I think he has like obviously really wide ranging, uh, liberties when it comes to hiring and firing as press.

Speaker 5:          00:38:59       Amazing. And we didn't know about that until this happened. Yeah. Because most people have the good sense not to do things like that because it looks bad. Right? Look suspicious. People forget though that Clinton did the same thing. Clinton fired the head of the FBI as well and he fired him in the middle of an investigation. I forget what the investigation was. I forget what the circumstances were, but it wasn't as egregious. But it was pretty similar because this feels like, I mean, at least from the outside, it does feel like, you know, every day it feels like this is heating up into some like major scandal. Who knows? Cause evidence wise, I know it's always pointed out that we don't have any, you know, smoking gun yet, but it does feel like it's cooking up into something, you know? I don't know. I think everybody wants it to, that has that sense too.

Speaker 5:          00:39:43       Here's the question of like what's inappropriate and what's illegal? And I think a lot of it's been inappropriate, but how much of it is illegal? True. Like Sam Harris is a podcast where he had these, uh, political experts on talking about what Trump did when he had those Russians over the White House. And he gave them top secret classified information about Isis wanting to use laptops to blow planes up. And he's like, Hey, you know, when you do that, you've compromised all these people that were embedded in isis that we're telling the government about this plan that they have now. They have to get these people out and hope these people don't get assassinated. Like you can't, like in thinking in him thinking that he's sharing information, like, you know, I'll let you know secret, like what you're doing is you're exposing sources and it's, and you know, it's obvious too that like, he's the type of guy that loves having that sheriff secret moment.

Speaker 5:          00:40:34       Like, I'm sure he was like, you got to tell you something. Well that's the whole thing with Comi. Like, you know, like he wanted to hug him and he want to say, luck, I hope you can let this go. But he's like telling someone to let go a criminal investigation crazy into being compromised by Russia. And apparently they were warned that that Flynn guy was, he was compromised by Russia before he even got into off a, they were, they were, he was worn by the Obama administration. And then when, when Yates came over the, uh, the deputy attorney general and warned, uh, uh, Trump's lawyer about it, they still didn't act for another week or two. She was a gangster. Those fucking hearings she was, she was so good because she, they were trying to chip away at her and she was like, look what school?

Speaker 5:          00:41:18       Yeah, school. And I'm on the constitution school and I'm on law school in Amman, ethics and about her responsibility to the American people. It's like, no, I'm not going to institute a travel ban on Muslims. You out of your fucking mind. I can't do that. This is a country of immigrants. You wanted me to institute a travel ban. So upsetting to me. Yeah. It's know he's like, he's like a murderer and you know, and they all get caught cause they brag about shit. Like he couldn't help himself talking about Isis. Probably like, I got some good, I got to share it. I gotta Brag about the shit. I love all the child's about how they go. It's really difficult because of his short attention span and he has a tendency to be easily distracted. He likes the visual aids to you. If you talk about something, you have to show pictures to him. He wakes up in wines now with cable news and he brags that I don't read. He's like, I don't like reading.

Speaker 5:          00:42:17       You know? Another thing is hilarious. Let's talk about the shows that he watches. They're there, number one, because everyone knows I'm watching. Oh, right. By him saying that, everyone knows that he's watching these Fox News shows. I'm fine. It's, it's hilarious that he believes that that's why they're number one. But we've never had a president light. Like imagine if Obama did that. If Obama said, well, the reason why this shows number one is because I watch it. Everyone knows that I'm amazing. Yeah. Everyone, everyone loves Obama. Oh, he loves Obama, so I love him. Yeah. I keeps talking about Kanye. Kanye loves Trump. He loves Trump. Yeah, everyone loves Trump. But the fact that he talks about himself like he's fucking Roy Jones Jr Jones in his prime and Roy Johnson's don't mean he was the baddest motherfucker on the planet and he was talking about it in his prime.

Speaker 5:          00:43:05       It was a way to establish that he was, I mean, it's a psychological thing. He was like, when Roy Jones Jr gets out to everybody, joined Julie going to take care of business and everybody's like, okay, yeah, like a separate power almost. Right. He was like, I'm talking about this other aspect of myself. Yeah. He was talking about like this, this superhuman force that was Roy Jones Jr Joe rocks the House Thompson box, the motherfucking house. Many presidents in the past where this psychotic, but because of Twitter maybe, but maybe it's because of things like Twitter that we now see inside. I mean, what if Nixon was this bat shit crazy too, but because of the limited acts Spo Nixon tapes, that's great, but they play the actual tapes. It's really great. What he had a drunken moment with a, it's a famous drunken moment with a reporter where he was talking about how he has the power to, um, just go into a room and make the decision to kill 6 million people with a nuclear bomb.

Speaker 5:          00:44:05       And that, you know, that that hangs over him. Apparently he was intoxicated when he was talking about this, this, this nuclear option power. That's another very terrifying thing about the president. The president really does have legitimate power to, to wife out, to wipe out, to use nukes. I mean, he has a lot more power than we thought they did because there was so much restraint showed by Clinton, even by Bush. Believe it or not, like bushes even criticized the Trump administration, which is crazy. And Bush, I mean, Bush seems like a fucking, like a, like a liberal daisy, right? Compared to them. So reasonable Einstein compared to, well, the Supreme Court, when the Supreme Court ruled against, uh, one of Trump's things and Trump's like, I'll see you in court, you know, whereas a dude that was court. Yeah, that was great. That was the best court man. But like Bush, they showed this clip of Bush losing a similar ruling to this cream supreme court and his reaction to it was so reasonable.

Speaker 5:          00:45:03       Yeah. He was like, well we have to respect the court and the court's decision and this is just the way it is. Although I'm disappointed. I understand that they're doing their best in like a big part of it. I do think you're right though is is the lack of Twitter restraint because nobody would ever act like that. I know they had sort lay, there was an article that said they had an intervention last week and they're like, you're making it harder for yourself and there. And they were like, and they showed him with visual aids, like when you tweeted this and then this was the pushback and these were the articles written afterwards. Like you got to fucking stop.

Speaker 5:          00:45:35       It's hilarious. It is. I mean, who knows? It's good in that we need to know that this is a stupid fucking position that no one should really have. No one should really have the ability to just be the top chimp over 300 plus million people. It's crazy that you give anybody that power. There's no reason to, unless you raise a philosopher king, even a philosopher king is subject to the immune. If he has an ego and if he's a human being, he has the same possibility of going out of their fucking minds. Just it's just too much. But why risk it? It's just there should be way more checks and balances in place. Nutty to even want to be president. Of course, it's an absurd job. They're all, they're all megalomaniacs. Who knows. Could be next. Maybe a Glen Moon.

Speaker 10:         00:46:23       Hi, Glenn Moon officially announced my candidacy armed forces commander and chief office President United States of America. If elected, I will serve holy will of God named Jesus Christ and Power Holy Spirit from God and named Jesus Christ. Volt Moan USA. President 2012 November. Oh, he didn't make it, Huh? I don't eat it, but I don't know if he's going to come back, man. Hey, email person self described 18 year old former student, Franklin or Churchill High School I met earlier this year, 2011 library. Livonia. If anyone knows Amy who my last, I entering her friend's house on six mile road service drive west of farm to road after I drove her there and my motor vehicle from library. I would appreciate you giving her my Facebook address. You are l I could use some help securing 18 to 20 year old vote.

Speaker 5:          00:47:06       Wow. Yeah. Well he was doing the sign of the cross wise that helps presidents. Here's some balloons out there. What do you do with those? Shoot them in the head or let them live. I think you've got to let them live until they, until they show up at the address. We have to keep them at containment systems though. That's the problem. Reagan let them loose and we need to re get real them in a little. It needs to be a park. Yeah. What did Reagan do? He lowered the bar right? The institutionalized, uh, the mentally ill. So we unleash them on the streets and it crazy because he's the guy got shot by a mentally a little breath out now. Yeah, he's out now. He has a, it's like some type of supervisor but he's out. But he was like supervise. He has to go I think to his mother's house or something and, but he's, yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:47:52       He's not in a prison. Yeah. So weird. How old is he though? He was probably in the 60s. He can still kill. Yeah. Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's a bad job and it's not a, it's not a smart job. It was a job that made sense back when we were dealing with kings and we said, well, what's having an elected representative instead of a King? So it was a superior alternative. And then we had all these checks and balances like representative government and having senators and congressmen and all these different people. They were there to make decisions for the individual states and the engine. A little individual states could have their own laws and regulations and it was, it was a fairly good system for the time. But when you deal with electronic media and, uh, our ability to gather information instantaneously, like, and communicate information, like there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to vote online.

Speaker 5:          00:48:45       No, no, none. We should all be able to vote online. Registration should be super easy. The very least the, you know all these, I didn't know, but all these, all these European countries do weekend voting for national elections and it ups their turnouts by like 60% yeah, that's a great idea as well. There's a lot of different ways they don't want that though. Right? They literally don't want any more participation because first of all, one of the things that you're seeing with Trump that's really disturbing is you're seeing the rise of the asshole class. Like there are a lot of assholes out there that will never represented and they don't necessarily agree with his politics, but they have like an identity thing now. It's, it's more like they're in a a group of likeminded people than it is even that, it's like a political party. It's like a cult. It's a douchebag.

Speaker 5:          00:49:36       It's legit. Like there's a lot of people that are enjoying this because the, they're on a team and it's like whether they're rooting for the fucking dolphins or they're rooting for Trump, it's, it's kind of the same thing. They identify with a clan. This clan of people are a Trump supporters, right wingers, whatever they're doing, but it's it. They just happened to beat Trump supporters and lingers. They could be anything else. It's just people love to be in a support group of likeminded people that agree to a certain thing. I don't think that they also, like I noticed during the campaigns it was, it seemed like it was a lot more just fuck the other team, like that kind of thing. It wasn't like about like he makes sense on these points. It was just like, fuck you guys. I'm going to just imagine if Hillary got into office and was doing all the same things that Trump has done as far as like giving way classified information to Russia, compromising sources, firing the head of the FBI because he was investigating her. The lock her up, lock her up, lock her up. All that was like a big chant during the campaign member. Yeah. Yeah. Well he's done shit way worse. Why? Worser and worser chick. He's got worker from clip. Oh No, the Gypsies. Gypsies. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:50:51       Total white trash people and she's, she's fighting with some other woman. She was like, okay, shit. Just got, why worser, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:50:57       No. What else is interesting? Um, the, that I was listening to the Sam Harris' podcast they were talking about, I like the reviews are good. Yeah, he's amazing. The real, the real interesting issue is the ebb and flow of support and that if the pro Trump media unitedly turned on him, because there was some speculation that they were upset that Trump was doing some things, some intervention things in foreign countries and mangle it a meddling and other affairs that they didn't want. They wanted more of a separatist sort of like, you know, it's going to take care of itself and fuck all those other companies. But when we started bombing Syria, we dropped the Moab bomb and all this different stuff. There's a lot of people that expressed some, like they, some discontent. Like this is not what we wanted it, we sign up. Right. If it turns and they United as a United front turn on Trump, the very people that support them, which by the way could absolutely happen.

Speaker 5:          00:51:58       Sure when you're, when you're a guy who like mobilizes those armies, those armies of assholes, they're stair subject to turn on you. Especially if you're clearly an asshole yourself. Sure. If he does enough asshole ish things and then one day they just decided to turn on him. They were talking about this like this could be catastrophic for his campaign. Look at it. Literally could the very people that put him in office, this same group, if they have someone who represents them better, well it's a Ron Paul or someone else, someone who they can get with philosophically, but they don't think like what for whatever reason they just decided they don't like him anymore. Which can easily happen.

Speaker 2:          00:52:38       Totally. Well it can happen to you because I don't think Trump really believes all the crap that he was saying that he was behind. Like do you really think he's antiabortion like how many abortions has that motherfucker probably paid for it himself. You know what I mean? Like he's not about all the stuff that, do you really believe? I think he's, I think, no, I know he's a, he's a, he's a great, you have to give them credit for being the, the super talented self promoter, super talented and organizing them, filling things in the moment. Yeah. I don't think he believes all that believe and I know that he definitely lost at least a segment of people this past week with, uh, having his first foreign trip to Saudi Arabia. Like there was a lot of people that were, I mean I'm talking about like very, very hardcore, you know, far right people that were upset that like, what are you doing going there and your first foreign trip you should be having them pay us back

Speaker 6:          00:53:26       for nine 11. You should, you know, why are you basically mingling with them negotiating an arms deal? I mean, it's just, there's, there's going to be things that pop up every week that people will, you know, get upset about. Have you seen the picture of Trump and that Saudi Arabian guy and some other dude holding on to that glowing gas? So creative, what is that going? What is that? A global, yeah. And it's like showing, it's funny too, cause he was like the Anti Globalist Campaign Guy, right? It was like America first nationalism and then now it's like this is a global, but it's all about the whole world. What is it with these people once they get into office? Even Obama, once he got into office, like became kind of a different person I think. Well especially like when you're in that first term, you know, I think everything just shifts to like I got to make, I got to get that second term.

Speaker 6:          00:54:11       It's all they care about. I mean that's it. Or do you think that's a big part of it because they, they especially like the one thing I will say, I think I noticed with Trump is I think at the end of the day, I don't think he cares about anything other than winning, winning the campaign, winning votes, winning for him. He's a, I think he a highly, highly, highly competitive guy. And to him it's just like everything is about, it's a victory. Whether it's this executive order signed, this is like a victory. Uh, you know, the, the, the, when the healthcare thing went down, that was considered a loss. I think that would probably suit like destructive to his whole psyche. And I think all he wants is to win again. Have another shot at the presidency again. Only because it means he won. Not because he really cares about being president. I think he just wants to win man. Yeah, it could be. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:55:03       I'm, I'm enjoying the campaign at like the, the, sorry, the coverage of Melania hating him. Like there's there weighing stuff. Like he tries to hold her hand and she swats it away and shit like that. I enjoy. Yeah, I think, you know, there's a lot of stuff they read, they reach obviously for anything, right? Like if you're pressed, that's the thing is like the level of scrutiny on everything. It's like they were holding hands and then they let go and they're like, she swatted that. They, you know, they want to visit great animated gift though where he looks over at her smiling and then he turns away and she like, yeah, she's like incidents at the inauguration. Yeah. That's amazing. It's weird. It is weird. What do you think that it reads so clearly too? It's like you can say a lot of these things are ah, your slip.

Speaker 8:          00:55:46       But that seems so much, cause she's like, well that seems legit. And also the fact that she doesn't live there. Well fuck. What'd you want to, she just, you know, that's not what she signed up for it, you know. And she did she sign up for, she signed up for some Bj's and some scrolling. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Some Fendi bags teaspoon a day. And then how much dick can you suck. Right. Let me think about it. It's a great gig cause he's probably only a horny a couple days a week. Yeah, it's 75 or something like that. You can only probably get it up a few days. Even with Viagara probably only wants to pussy a few days a week. Yeah. And then the rest of the days a week she's driving Rolls Royces party New York. Yeah. Trump. So she's right here. Right. And so he's gonna turn back, smile. Big Smile,

Speaker 11:         00:56:38       right?

Speaker 8:          00:56:41       Yeah. It's a big smiler. But you forget, she's my tribe. This is actually the coldness of the eastern blocker as well. Yeah. My stepmother had a little of that at a little, yeah, a lot. Yeah. Yeah. So do you think that it's also like part of the reason why she accepted this position life in the first place? It's like there's like, uh, like a pragmatism, like a cold pragmatism. Like this is a good move. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Well she was a hot check, right? She's like, I'm not sure. So that's what you gotta do. It's a, you know, you can't model forever pictures of her and it lesbian sort of photo shoot type thing. I know there's some nude modeling modeling prison, Nudie pics of our first lady. That's crazy. Yeah. That's crazy. I be crazy. If they were like butthole pics, if she would like to spread them.

Speaker 8:          00:57:31       Shot looked like a string of spit. Yeah. Figures. And we're back to your mom. I got serious for a minute, but we got back to the important stuff. Clicks. Oh yeah. We're living in the, one of the weirdest times ever in human history is cause it's total uncharted territory. Yeah. And was that just glassing glassing dude that's become in the hunting community. Yeah. That's become a giant punchline. It is all over. Like I sent you that meat eater. Yeah. They said we're going to beat you guys to the punchline sending pictures out in this glass and yeah, it's a beautiful photo there. Look overlooking this incredible landscape and everybody just say just glass and you know like when you know we have all these like little inside jokes that one went like so crazy haywire. It went haywire. People brought binoculars to my shows in New York.

Speaker 4:          00:58:26       Look at the map. This is why, this is why I came up here, but slipping along, that's a beautiful, I'll call him at all, stopping along here. Just glass and just go there. But all of a sudden have my head. And it also fired up.

Speaker 8:          00:58:47       And this also opened up a whole new world for us, which was the excitement of a dad boner. Like when a dad gets really excited about something, that enthusiasm is not any other kind, a different kind of enthusiastic. Yeah. Well, because it's usually for something that nobody would get that excited about it except for that. Well, you know, he's a very famous, both Fred Eichler people are emailing us like, yeah, that's not good friend. I did not tell you. I told you to remember. He's, I watched him on TV. Oh yeah, you did say you watch his show. Yeah. Yeah. And he's so, he glasses whole like what's was

Speaker 2:          00:59:21       killed everything in the world with a comp. I read it. We read about him after it. Yeah. He's killed the animal kingdom. Yeah. Yes. He's killed Noah's Ark with turbo w a recurve bow is like a traditional old Skool Bo. It's like legit. This dude's just, Oh yeah. He's one of the best bow hunters in the world. Recognized. Hmm. Yeah. So it does he know about this? I don't know. I know we emailed them, we reached out. I'm sure I reached out this guy. He's probably upset. People were all swearing. Yeah. Oh, he's super nice. Oh, remember? Sure. Yeah, he had that one. He had a video where he goes and he spanks a little cub bear that there was a little bear eating out of like a dumpster by his house and he ran up and spanked it and was like, Ooh, ran back and got all excited about it.

Speaker 2:          01:00:05       Yeah. He's like way out in the wilderness. I don't know. I believe he lives in Colorado. I think that's it. Yeah, it's glass. We have all these other, so we started to look for dads that get excited about things, you know, like that. We consider him in that category and like, so like there's, you know what foamers are no foamers are people, they get really into trains and they like, we'll wait at train stations for trains to drive by and they fucking get really excited. Foamers Damn New York once again on the SNC. Yeah. So I'm trying, coming here southbound on North Creek. They get really into it then. Boy.

Speaker 4:          01:00:50       Wow. That's cool. Well that sounds quite, Gosh. Oh my God. It sounds like an Alco, oh 1943 I asked too. Wow. Oh God. Oh Man. Yeah. Okay. Cat Away. Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:01:33       Guys. Just won't wait for trains like ours. He's so excited about that train. So excited. Don't you kind of envy this guy's ability to get super stoked on something so dumb. No. That guy needs to find pussy. Yeah. You would just abandon all those numbers. Keep rattling. It's our f four five, six, two nine. Here's the solar equipment. That's why their dads

Speaker 12:         01:01:57       look at this. Oh my God. It's coming. The Moon's shadow is coming. It is coming. The watch in front of, yeah. Oh my God. Here it comes. Look at this. I never seen him like this. No flashes. Oh my God. Here we go. Look at it. Oh my God. Whoa. Look at that. Oh my God. Here we go. Oh my God. It's coming right over a second. Sorry. I'm looking at this. Oh my God. We're getting close. It's getting close. No, felt the dog. I got corona. That is Diamond Bailey's beads. Very big diamond ring. Look. ADAC totality. Oh my God. Look good. I mean, it's cool to see. That makes sense. Look at the phone. Maybe that's it. Oh, look it down there. That's pretty rare. Look at it. Look at that. Oh my God. But it does sound like he's going to come with and, awesome. I wonder if you took that flight specifically.

Speaker 8:          01:03:01       Does that guy seems so into it and was so much knowledge? Yeah, it doesn't seem like a casual trip. I think by far the craziest one that we found because we've, we've been sent a lot of these things is this fucking guy. I'm getting excited about something. So God damn mundane. The Trans Canada highway. Yeah. Oh God. I love this one. I finally found the last

Speaker 13:         01:03:21       paved. Oh, okay, cool. Oh Wow. This guy doesn't Fuck Trans Canada highway baby. We are standing in beautiful sunny Beretta. It's Columbia. The kilometer marker 7,128 and this with a 90% no. Make that 95% chance that this is in fact the very place where the Trans Canada paved. It's last woo.

Speaker 8:          01:04:15       I mean this is about a highway being completed, right? Wow.

Speaker 13:         01:04:18       Canada has on asphalt belt and God Barco and there was a highway. Ooh. Goes running on it and you're like, oh, those towels, he's running on the highway right in time down the middle. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, this is a downhill sucks. Fortunately so strong.

Speaker 8:          01:04:59       Yeah. I mean I like it. It makes me happy every time. I mean, why does it make you happy? Because I lacked that enthusiasm for the road. Like this guy has found a way to get pumped on something so benign. See it. My, my brain decided about, I get excited about a lot of shit, but this with this guy, I see that and I go, okay, I want to, to that guy about normal life there has got to come up in a normal conversation where he falls apart. Like there's, it's a normal shit. We talked to this guy about and he's got some weird disconnecting, well, I don't like to talk about bathrooms and this is where he sublimating all that weirdness. Yeah. He's finding he's bottleneck in some way. He is. And you're right about the lack of sexual intercourse. There's no, wow, this guy's good or any of these dads. But that's why their dads, because they show their dads that guy by be a loner. Well, yeah, I think we're, we're labeling dad. Yeah. You Call Him Him Dad's cause they're older guys. Yes, yes. I'm assuming that they're, they've shut it down or their wives have shut it down. The wife has a very short hair cut and she's wearing Ku lots and sandals. You know what I mean? Like they're just shut down. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         01:06:01       Now Ladies and gentlemen, your Trans Canada highway as yours, Canada, it would be something that if you heard back,

Speaker 8:          01:06:20       this video is dedicated. All the men, the women who made this great possible at great highway possible thank you. And you all caps exclamation points. It's just, whoa, those noises though.

Speaker 13:         01:06:31       Or like crazy crazy. That's gang bang. So yes.

Speaker 8:          01:06:42       I mean that's for a highway being, I almost feel like he's seen every stretch of it. Right? Like that's the thing. Maybe this is the completion of 10 years of traveling is fucking highway in documenting the whole thing. We like to think of the backstory. Yeah. Wasn't there for the construction. Was He part of it somehow? I had a guy on my podcast, Chris Cage, who's a walk the Appalachian trail. Do you know what the Appalachian trail is? Yeah, it's a, yeah, it's all through the Carolinas, right? Yeah. You start in Georgia and it goes all the way to Maine and he walked in. It took six months of walking. Whoa. Yeah, and this was like a dream. His dream. I don't know. He had it in his head that he wanted to do it. How did he eat? Did he bring, how does the food work?

Speaker 8:          01:07:22       Bring Food? You buy food along the way. Okay. Yeah. You bring some food. Oh yes. My only concern. Now you say you get you saying that I don't get excited. I have an email from a listener I thought would be a nice time. Okay. Your Mommy. Tina, I completely understand your need for Tom to have enthusiasm as my fiance is just as chill an unexcitable as Tom. There is nothing more agitating. Them being excited for something and only getting a smile from my man. That just proves that you are the personality champ personalities all about getting excited, having different moods and responding accordingly to other people. Clearly Tom doesn't have what it takes to be considered a champ. It's all you. Ps. I also get farted on and treating less treated like a sister. We are definitely into weird territory. I feel like this only happens with couples who are on the same playing field.

Speaker 8:          01:08:10       Lots of love, Hannah. Thank youThanks. Huge mistake. Do you have it now your email address? I just want to say that predicting to get more from Hannah now. Yeah, 10 is going to start crying for sure. I caught him 40 on my sister. Things are getting weird. I can't believe you. You think I don't get excited about and I mean we discovered that Tom gets excited about football but I mean, okay. It was seldom is there a big, I mean you've known him for years too and gets excited when he goes to, goes to shows when he does a great show. I do. I get excited. You Express your enthusiasm for good shape. Fucking show. Yeah. Yeah. You could tell he gets pumped. Yeah, I do. I get a rush. What is pounce look like from Tom Cow?

Speaker 8:          01:08:56       I like cars. I get excited by cars, get excited. When I saw, I saw one of his cars, I got, I was used to seeing that was what you had a video camera on me. I was like, ah. I was glowing at the thing. I like cars. I buy car magazines and looking at a kid. That's true. Yeah. All the corvette. Right. So cool. He's like a little kid. Yeah, I do like it. So there you go. You farted this morning. Uh, horrendously this morning or last night. Probably bug you excited about that too? He changed. I was a marital relations and then afterwards we were, you know, whatever, lame around and he goes, you know, you're lucky. I go, why? He goes, well, I held in a Fart for you that whole time. And I go, wow, what a lucky gal and I should get credit for that. I feel like, I feel like some guys would have let that go and I was like, nope, don't do that right now.

Speaker 8:          01:09:53       I had just settled in, you know, and I was like, Nah, don't let this go right now. That's beautiful. Yeah. See he can appreciate it. It's amazing. I get excited talking about this with you. Be, would she consider it nice too that you owe? Do you hold them in or do you try my best and if I do accidentally let one go, I'd let everybody know. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Everybody clear house? No, you got ladies around here. A little girls, right? So yeah, house filled with girls. Thank you gentlemen. I got the opposite. It's all dicks all day balls and farts. Don't you think that you get material out of that? That's probably a blessing for you. I'm used to it. I'm, you know, I'm more male energy. Wait, not good with, we haven't done this during the show. You need to do this, Christina.

Speaker 9:          01:10:45       My big announcement just means there's a big enough, there's

Speaker 8:          01:10:56       a big news coming. Oh, it's a sound cue. You know how like morning shows we'll have like air horns or whatever. We have chips in the ball. She was in a bowl. But what kind of chips of those things are potato chips being poured into? So loud? It sounds like, I thought it was gambling chips. Yeah. Oh, right. Oh, that's interesting. I've never thought of that know know. I don't think there's a distinction

Speaker 7:          01:11:14       made, but it's so clunky. It is. Yeah. I think they're the thin lays kind. That's the kind I see when I ruffles. Yeah. Yup. Okay. Uh, anyways, big news. I'm finally shooting my hour special.

Speaker 14:         01:11:26       Oh,

Speaker 7:          01:11:32       you shooting it? All right. Here it is. Denounce Mike and finally make it June 20 fourth@theshoeboxtheaterinseattleandticketsareonthousandranch.com.

And the great city of meat rattle. I can't wait to go there with so many mommy's there. It's gonna be awesome. And I'm still very happy for you.

Speaker 5:          01:12:02       Seattle's on the shortlist of places I would live outside of La as, yeah. Same as me. I like, they're very, yeah, get through the winter. I'd just go to Hawaii a couple of times or something to get through that fucking rainy bullshit yeah. To deal with. But once you get through that, I think like intellectually, I think it's one of the best cities. Like people, they're not as pretentious. They're, but they're smart. There's no show Biz influence, which I think is one of the things that fucks us up here. Yeah. Is the, the desire for fame. Like he's, it's a, this is a total absence of that up there. You see way less fake. Yup. Fake tits, fake lips, fake ass people. What is that? They look like people. It's a really cool city. I um, I didn't realize, you know, sometimes you just see like one thing and in a theater and so you, you don't know if you've been there before.

Speaker 5:          01:12:50       I did the more and uh, I didn't realize until afterwards when I went to the lobby that I'd been there with you cause the lobby. Yeah. Stood out to me. I didn't realize that when you're before in Seattle. I did it a couple of weeks ago and as as we were in there, they're like, you've been here before. I was like, never been here before. And then we got the lobby and I was like, I have been here before because I remember doing like a meet and greet with you. With a, yeah. Have we done so many places? Do I forget? Forget them all. Yeah. They all get, they blend in Seattle. I mean, yeah, every time I've gone there I've had some of the most fun shows that the average, yeah. That's why I chose that city. I mean, I, you know, La is obviously my heart. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:13:25       What'd you say? The the showbiz element, that is the problem. It's the problem. There's not just a showbiz element, but the problem that you were talking about what that Instagram kids and the Kardashians, they're not necessarily even showbiz. They were like at the attention industry. The attention industry. Yeah. It's like there's so much fake bullshit and so much like flossy nonsense. Crazy. Yeah. I mean, I feel like Seattle is basis Microsoft and Amazon and there's a lot of tech money there and a lot of really smart people. Yeah. And it's also super green and I feel like being next to the ocean and Super Green, like you've seen a lot of green mountains. Yeah. It's something about that. It's just better for you. Yeah, definitely. I think so too. If your brain is a very like kind of showy town know that we live in, it's like a very like show off thing.

Speaker 5:          01:14:13       I think one of the funny things is like the idea like that you think you have money in this town like and people who are trying to come across that way and you go to a town like Seattle where like no, those, those 22 people are billionaires and then they're not even trying to show you that there weren't like a sweater Bill Gates dresses like a fucking like killing and yeah. Yeah. It's, it's odd, right? What are you doing all that money. He, but he does a lot of humanitarian sons of it. That's incredible what he's done. And he got a lot of other super wealthy people to donate their money. A lot of them like they do that. The pledge. Well, how about Warren Buffet? He's given it all that and that's through gates. He's done it through gates. Yeah. He's an interesting cat. Like he's literally, when he dies he will die and leave it all to charity.

Speaker 5:          01:15:03       Yeah. So that's and there and he's been giving a lot, some of it, those guys, they've been giving billions as they're alive. Even Warren Buffet also lives in like the same house that he bought, like 30 Maha Nebraska. It's a super normal house. Yeah. It drove the same car for like 20 years. Like why have all that money then? No one understands. Aren't you fucking flossing? He's balling his level. You should definitely be balling slightly. A little bit. The same lady, I think he's divorced. He got divorced. Yeah, she got like 1.5 billion, which to him was like, once you stop lik nagging at me, take a little 1 billion billion. Dot. Yeah. Yeah. He's, he's still doing pretty well now. Jude Dork titties. That's a great city too. Yeah. Jude Dork titties. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's a place that I would consider living. I would consider living in New York City in the winter months.

Speaker 5:          01:16:01       Yeah. It doesn't bother me that much. I think it's all about, one thing is like in La after a while, even though compared to most of the country lifestyle, you know, cost of living is much higher. It's still significantly different than New York. And like I would only go there if I could definitely live at least pretty comfortably. You know what I mean? Like I've taught a baller, baller all. Yeah. You don't want to struggle in New York. My wife wants, she's talked about moving there. This is like one place where she said she would go like, if you want to go there, I'll go there. Really? Yeah. I think she just thinks it's like a big glamour shopping trip though. So she looks at it. Well she, she's right to a point. I mean like incredible shock. The other colds rough, but you know, you just dress warm, which is not that difficult.

Speaker 5:          01:16:50       So you'd be doing like eight spots a night. I know that you yeah, maybe but not, I don't like that many spots as much as I like longer spots. Right. I think longer spots like too long spa, take two, one half hour spots over eight 15. Yeah, because as far as like developing material, I think it's really important to, to stretch out a little bit because you're creating like you've composing something, you're putting something together, a peak and a valley. And you know, Diaz and I had a conversation about that yesterday. He was like, I got to go to more places where I could work an hour. He goes, cause sometimes I'm home for like a month and I don't go on the road. I don't do an hour set. And then I got to go do an hour set and I got a piece it all together and make that make sense at a like short spots.

Speaker 5:          01:17:31       And it, and especially if you, if you're touring a lot like I have been and you're doing that long set every night. Uh, I, I don't particularly get a thrill out of a 15 minute spot. It feels like, it feels like, I mean, I understand it's a totally different thing and it's, it becomes like a different skill set, but it doesn't even feel that rewarding because like the benefit is like, it doesn't feel like it lines up with what I'm doing. Know that you just can't, and cooking. Yeah, yeah. You're just getting started in the light goes on, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know what you're saying. But to me, I treat them as blocks. Like I have a four 15 minute blocks. And so like, uh, like if I'm doing a set tonight, I'll say, okay, well I did this block last night, so tonight I'll do this blog.

Speaker 5:          01:18:12       And that's true. You know? And then, um, one of the cool things about La is that I can do three or four blocks and night. Like I'll do one set at the Improv and I'll do two sets of the comedy store. I did three sets of the comedy store and one side of the Improv on two Thursdays ago. And you had like a killer feature sets. Yeah. Well no one one different to the same and one was uh, the um, uh, Jeremiah Watkins fuck around shy. Yeah, yeah. I'm doing that. Next thing that's a great show. Can't wait. I've never done it. Oh it's the best people. They yell at a subject and then you start riffing on the subject. It's just yell out like cats. Yeah, Yup, Yup. And you start talking about it and it's, you come up with material and punch lines. You come up with taglines, you come up with, like you might have a, a section of something that you've ran about that doesn't fit anything.

Speaker 5:          01:19:04       And then one day you have a new bit and then you go, oh, and then there's that thing that I did on stage that night and then it slides right into there. I'm a big believer in that. It's not that hard, you know, relatively speaking to say something like a joke, come up with something funny. It's much more of a challenge to come up with an interesting topic or a premise, you know? So that's what like that, that show sounds exciting. Yeah. I feel like I'm saying like talk about this topic. Yeah, premises are giant premises are giant and a point of view is giant. And then from there I feel like it's like that's the scaffolding that you'll add jokes too and you'll figure out a way to make it funny and figure out a way to just do it the right way. And for me, one of the things that I started doing really recently that really made a big difference is, um, I'll, I'll have a bit, even if the bits killing, uh, and I know like this pits going well is developing well, I will outside of stand up, I'll sit in front of my computer and just write on that subject right on it in a completely different way.

Speaker 5:          01:20:06       Like, say if I approach from one, like say like you're talking about going on a boat, you're approached it from this way, then I'll just approach it from a completely different way and just say, okay, well this is already in the can, this one's done. All right, I've got it. So let me just try a new attack on it. And I've come up with so many different punchlines coming at it from a different angle, but forcing myself to sit in front of the computer and you know, I used that program, right. Room ever showed you that program, blacks, everything, blacks, everything out and gives you green font. So it's like the matrix font. Yeah. And I just sit there and I can't access email. I don't get notifications. Nothing.

Speaker 6:          01:20:42       So when you, um, when you write from a different angle, will you then in your bit do the chunk that works and then be like, or what if somebody, and then like all of a sudden present the other angle?

Speaker 5:          01:20:51       Sometimes it fits in, sometimes it just, I just find a way where it fits in. Yeah. But it just, it's just creating more tags lines. Uh, more tag lines, more punch lines. You have a new hour though, right? Yeah. Yeah. So how long did that take you? It didn't take you that long. Six months. Yeah. That's awesome. Every day I'm hustling. But I've seen you actually, it's a good lesson

Speaker 6:          01:21:12       I think for a lot of a lot of comics. Like you, uh, it came out and then you didn't, haven't chilled at all on that. You just like, we're were, I've see you, I see on posts all the time that you're just like spot spot, like working, working, working all the time.

Speaker 5:          01:21:26       Yeah, I do. Um, five or six nights a week. Lately. At least. At least four. Always at least four. Really. Like I worked last night. I take off tonight, I work Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. I got a hot date with the wife and then I'll probably work Sunday too. And then I'll go out it again next week. And you're doing, by the way, congrats on this tour because I saw it's, it's big time shit, man. It's crazy. It's crazy. It's because you're doing the theater at Madison Square Garden. Yeah, it's almost sold out. That's what's great. Is that like 7,000 seats or something? That's some something crazy, crazy. Dallas was nuts, man. Dallas was a, I just did Dallas. It was the biggest place ever sold out. That was 6,000 seats. It was maniacal. That's crazy energy that you get.

Speaker 6:          01:22:09       How do you like it? Because it's a total different thing from 1500 or 2000 seater.

Speaker 5:          01:22:14       It's different. It's a different thing, but the energy when you get 6,000 people laughing is crazy. It's weird. It's just circuits. Oh roar. So it's a, it's a different feeling, but you know, man, I just, I really like creating stuff. Yeah. I really like putting together, stand up, you know? And I really love the process of writing things down and going over my notes. I'd love the process of creating new material. I love the process of sitting in front of that laptop and staring at the screen. I love the whole process. I love the process of going on a run and like recording a new idea that I have in my head and then looking at the notes that I have on my phone and then breaking those down on paper and then sitting in front of the laptop and then taking these ideas, smoking a joint, going on stage with it and riffing with it and then recording it and listening to the recording on the home.

Speaker 5:          01:23:05       It's like the whole process to me is I've, it's my favorite thing to do. It really is. Other than you know, me too. I think it is like the biggest thrill I was talking to somebody about it that like, I think the biggest thrill still of all things is coming up with something new and having it be, you know, the validated and rewarded. You're like, that's a bigger thrill than anything. Yeah. It really is. Like I thought of this thing, I said it and this group of people reacting and then abandoning it. Yeah. Yeah. You have to have staff. Do you do or record a special, like somebody yelled out like do the Kim Kardashians, the Bruce Jenner bit, right? Yeah. And I'm like, dude, I don't even know how to do it anymore. I literally don't know how to do it. People don't understand that. Only comics understanding. Yeah, there you go. I've been doing this other thing for so long now that I don't remember the beats of that. Somebody tried to get I, I started to do one and I was like 30% through it and I got an a on what happens next? The audience yelled out the next line. I was like, well there you go. You guys know.

Speaker 7:          01:24:05       Then as I'm ramping up to tape it in a month, like I have to sit down and really go through my notes and really remember every little beat. Yeah. Bump to it and bell and whistle. Cause of course forget the cadence,

Speaker 5:          01:24:16       get away without doing that. But make no mistake about it. The more attention you spend thinking about that material, the better.

Speaker 7:          01:24:22       Yeah, most definitely. Yeah. And I have to get full focus. Like, I can't fuck around with anything like it's laser until that date.

Speaker 5:          01:24:29       You know what I know that's really kind of weird. I know guys that write on shows and they'll write sitcoms scripts and they'll write movie scripts and then they, they have like a chalkboard or a whiteboard and they're right on the whiteboard and they'll have notes that put like scenes, different scenes, but they don't ever do that about their own act. Right. And, and then their, their, their own act, they treat like, you know, like a red headed stepchild and never really, they never really have that kind of professional focus cause you don't have to because no one's telling you to write. But when it comes to like writing a show or writing a movie to, you have to write that because everyone's going over bit by bit. You have writer's meetings, you go to the writer's room, you sit down with people. There's no writer's room or writer's meetings for standup. Well why isn't there like why? Why don't we, because we're fucking lazy,

Speaker 7:          01:25:15       nice discipline. It's self discipline. And also it's hard to look at yourself and look and step back and separate you from your work and got, yeah, that kind of sock like that can be better. I should do this there. You know what I love the most is knowing that I'm about to say some crazy shit. Like when you're like you take the risk and in your heart you're like, oh, I'm so scared of this could be really there. Shouldn't, I shouldn't say this. And then you say, yeah, you get addicted to that feeling. Yeah, I like that part. Like I'm going to take a leap right here. Yeah. This is scary. And yeah, hopefully they'll come with me. And it's not just talking about airplanes and cats and dogs. You're like, yeah, they say some crazy shit. Yeah. And they, and then

Speaker 5:          01:25:49       there's a, there is that the risk, the risk is what the, is that feeling of like, yeah, there's this pair shoes it, yeah. And then the, the like, it's, you don't think about it at the time, but the knowing that a bunch of people are getting babysitters, they're spending their money, they're coming out to see you and there's this massive responsibility to incite a reaction in them. Yeah. With just your words and thoughts and the amount of responsibility that's on you do that. It's pretty intense. I've, I've, I've paid more attention to it over the last year or so that I have like ever in my life. Yeah. Have ramped it up more. Yeah. I've, I've, I just think it's constantly, and then my standards always get hired too. It's like I need to, I can't have a new special that's not as good as the last one. So I feel like, man, I gotta make sure this one's better. So I have to like watch my old one and go, well, what were, where's there? Too much fluff. Too much. Oh, you did that. Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like maybe I could cut this down. Maybe I shouldn't. Maybe this isn't as good as this part. You know, all that. It's just all sharpening the Samurai Sword, hammering that fucking metal down.

Speaker 8:          01:26:57       Yeah. I know. My problem is I'm a perfectionist, so like an, it's never good enough. It's never going to be, that's everybody's problem. I hate it. Everybody hates if anybody who's any good hates everything they do. It's true. Everybody I know that loves their act is terrible. Everybody tells me all my new stuff's amazing. I love it. Get away from it. It's gross. I've heard the, remember we did this job one time where that guy was like, oh, it goes like, don't show that of going back and watching. Yeah. I love watching yourself and like it was terrible. It was terrible. There you go. That's always the case. Yeah. It's weird. It's always the case and there they're always like big self promoters to, Oh God. Yeah. Yeah. Letterman hated himself. I read some book about him years ago and every episode he would go home and just put on the hair shirt and flog himself like that. I was the worst episode ever and I, in my estimation, he's the best. I love farming so much. But he why he's the best though. Yeah. Cause he, cause he had these high standards, he wasn't just half ass it. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:27:56       yeah, yeah. It's true. I remember a guy one time asked me to get them a guest spot in. It's like I went to a city and he was like, I knew him, I met him before. So I talked to the manager of the club and I was like, can I get this guy a guest spot? And she was like, are you vouching for him? I was like, yeah, yeah. So cause okay, so he goes up there, just eats such a big bag of shit. So then the club manager is like, what the fuck was that? And I go, wow, I just, I dunno. So there's a second show. And I go, dude, that was like, yeah. He was like, I know, I know. He's like, I'll do a totally different set on the second. So totally have different set and, and I'll, I'll make up for it. And I go, okay. So I go, let's just let him, he'll do a totally different set.

Speaker 8:          01:28:40       No, not only does he do the same set, he does x verbatim the same opening and since she's looking at me like what's going on? And I'm like, I see him. I go, yeah, you did the same exact thing. And he was like, yeah, what was his reasoning blackout or something. You got nervous. And the other thing is that that stood is that he had, this

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       is quite a few years ago, like amazing website and like all this other stuff had incredible attention.

Speaker 5:          01:29:08       You know like those guys. Yeah. Yeah. When you started doing standup and the car, I bought new cards. I remember that like cards that say your name and like, like about, this is every time I meet a guy in a town and he wants to do a guest set, I'm almost positive they suck. They're always like real true to him. And I really love to have guests on your show. Would guest said there's 6,000 people. So you're going to do a guest bet. I know a bunch of guys do that. I've had. I've also had guys that are like marginal headliners and you know, work in comics. Just show up, just show up at my show and asked to do a guest set. I'd like to Chicago Theater. It's crazy. I'm not kidding. 3,700 people. Hey, I like to do a guest set. Hey, I'd like you to go fuck yourself.

Speaker 5:          01:29:56       Yeah, tell them what do you say? No, I go to, this is all set up like this guy's going to do 20 a you know he's got, Ian's going to do 20 Tony Hinchcliffe so coming into 20 and then I'm doing an hour and 10 like this is what it is. Is it? This is the show, like there's no room for your guests said, I'll just do like seven minutes. No, you're not doing anything. I don't even know what you're doing. Yeah. I don't know what kind of moody, what if you go up on stage and you start doing my, my subjects, like get the fuck out of you just got an email about theater. It's about one for a theater show where they were like, but here's the thing. Would you ever do that? Never. Never the thing. Imagine showing up at a, if you were a musician, there's a band plan like, hey man, I just like to go home and do a song. Which is like what the fuck? Fucking mind.

Speaker 2:          01:30:38       Well the crazy thing about this email too, cause I've had this a few times, is it's an email saying, hey, you're coming to the city. I'd love to do a set. Not only do you not know who I am, I will provide no link to anything so that you could check out. Like in other words, it's just sight unseen. You don't know anything about me. Can I be on your show? Can I do like 20 minutes? That's good to know. You know, maybe like five.

Speaker 5:          01:31:05       I had a guy show up in Atlanta and he wanted to do a half hour. That's what he said. Yeah. I said, do you want to do, he goes, he goes, I want to do a guest set. He goes, jump note. Only talking like 30 minutes, not like an hour.

Speaker 2:          01:31:17       I remember once I had hockey. I love Dan Godfrey. He used to run the Brayer Improv and now he like overseas I think all the Improv's. Yeah. And one time I was in a brayer and I was, I think man, I want to say I was middling. This is like, uh, probably like oh six or something. And the, but I was, oh I was, yeah it was middling. And the, the MC was like, I'll do turn to him. I was like, I'll do 20 and uh, and then him and then Dan goes, you'll do 10 you won't do a minute more like just straight up. Cause the guy was like announcing how much time he's going to do from the AAMC slot out. Yeah. He was like, I'll do 20 and then how much do you do? And he's like, do 10 and not

Speaker 6:          01:31:59       a second more telling him like don't even fucking dream about doing that.

Speaker 5:          01:32:05       Yeah. And people get mad listening this inevitably, oh I'll get an angry tweet or an angry Facebook message and people will get mad thinking that, you know, like you just don't appreciate people that are trying to make it. And when you were trying to make it, listen, I'm telling you all the people that are out there listening that have that mindset, no one does that. No one who's any good does that. It's just not what you do. You don't ever ask for guest spots. If you get to know someone and you start working with someone and you work with them on a regular basis and you want to work with them somewhere, you know, that's one thing. Like say if you know, like say if you were going to be in town doing a wedding or something like that, like you were a friend who was getting married.

Speaker 5:          01:32:43       So my dad, he like, dude, you're working that night. And I'd be like, yeah, you want to do a set and be like, fuck yeah. And then we would work around it. Sure. I figure it out. But it's only because we've worked together so many times and know each other so well. Like to have someone who you don't even know want to interject. Like your s your show is like a complete package. Like you've put it together, right? You know who you opening acts are, you know what kind of material they do totally and you're thinking about how this whole thing is going to play out together and you want to make sure that that audience who gets that babysitter and goes out and we do want to make sure that they get the best set possible.

Speaker 6:          01:33:16       And I'm old school I guess in the sense that I am 100% of the idea that everything at any show is absolutely all about the headliners, desires and wants for it's their show. Like whenever I opened for you and like somebody would say like, Hey, do you, I'd be like, I don't know, ask him. It's his fucking show. Like we're all here. It's called support for a reason. Like we're supporting the headlining act and I fucking hate when they try to involve anybody else in decision making or how do you want to go. It's all about whoever's name is on the more whatever they dictate is the way that show goes and you should respect that. You should respect what it took for them to get to that point. And you should respect their desires at the show though, if you want to talk about lighting or music or how much time all, it's all that person's decision so everybody else can go fuck themselves. Yeah. You know what? I also find to be a problem that I don't, I don't do. I don't take guys in the road to do crowd work. Oh boy. Get your life. It just opens up Pandora's box. It becomes a real problem where when someone loves to do crowd work and they start what you do for a living, sir, I'm looking at you with that suit on. I'm imagining good salesman and now you know that the problem

Speaker 5:          01:34:31       people start boozing and they want to, I'm going to get my chance. He's going to talk to me, and then they start gearing up and then it at the time never comes and then you're on stage and they want to start yelling,

Speaker 6:          01:34:40       sit down. You're like, oh. It changes the expectations of the show and somebody who's the show is not about them has made that decision. That's what's fucked up about it. I've had that were like, Holy Shit. One Guy did eight 20 minute Crowdwork set front of me. Really? Yeah. And did like a, I mean this is few years ago we got it worked

Speaker 8:          01:34:58       into a frenzy and then you get up there and if some guys like and you're like, shut the fuck up. I'm not talking to you man. It's a problem. Yeah, it becomes a problem because then the audience mad at you. How come you just get to talk? All right, why don't I talk. Guy was waiting to talk. Yeah, I just love it. They used to really mismatch my opener. It's like, this is back in the day I was opening Fort Lauderdale and they gave me this, uh, this guy who was like, ladies, you will guide us. Suck Good Dick. That's why they call it a blow job. Not a career. Some shit. And I was like, all like, ladies, you got to suck Dick. Get the fuck Outta here. Like, do you even know who I am? No. Don't give a shit. They're not putting care. They're not considering it as your show.

Speaker 8:          01:35:41       Now, that guy would never even be near me. Like a guy that the club found funny and they go, yeah, I've got it open week for male to female comic plus it. Fort Lauderdale is there other than Jim Brewer, is there a funny comic that's ever come out of Florida? Is he had, is he had a Florida? I didn't even know that crusher. He's Tosh tosh before too. In Florida too. There goes my theory. Todd Barry's Todd Barry said Florida. Wow. But I know you're saying in terms of like the fame, there's not abutment there. They developed somewhere else. There's one other guy too that's really fun to, they came out of Florida. Um, Brian Regan didn't, Brian Regan came out of Florida. You might be right. Yes. He's from Miami. Yes, that's right. Yeah. So my, my theory sucks. Yeah. But no, you're right. But there's no bastion of comedic glory like Fort Lauderdale's not worth.

Speaker 8:          01:36:34       We all go to get really good. Well, there's no community, right? Yeah. Apparently there was developing one in Miami because last time was in Miami was a couple of years ago and I did the uh, you know, they have that South beach comedy festival. I went with you on this right and we were after the show, we were talking to some people, it's one of the local bars. They're like, yeah, we're local comics. We have like a comedy show here and a bar here. And like we put together like a real community. I'm like, Oh yeah, like that didn't exist for a while. Miami was the worst impression history of people don't, I'm walking around the world, they cancel my week. I got a call like a month before and they're like, look, we can't sell tickets for a white girl. We're going to have to pull your week. And I was like, no problem.

Speaker 8:          01:37:15       A month before they knew were like the writing's on the wall. No one take it for this white girl speak English. That's crazy. Shows that Joey d is used to do half Spanish shows there. Like he would, he would yell out half the punchline would be in Spanish and people would fall out of their fucking chairs crying, laughing. We did shows there and they were just, it was thunder dome. It was chaos. It was chaos. It was, I did a set there where I would weave in and out of Spanish too. And that's right. You speak full span. And I would, and it would be crushing it pandemonium. It would be nice. And I did one one time middling

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       and the headliner did 35 minutes afterwards. Oh my God. He's like, I'm out of here. Almost have to be bilingual. Yeah. Yeah. And that like if you, if you were to ask that staff like are you going to police the room? They'd be like that. No Dude. And everyone was 18 the audience was all under each and they gave away tickets. It was a whole papered room. They told me a story about how, you know there was, that was in coconut grove and there's some, there's some bad parts near that in that area. Like they would also tell you like, don't walk down the street from the club and you're like, oh great. And so this one, you know there's like this Haitian gang, I forget the name of it, but anyways, dominant in that area. So one time, some guy, I don't know, he's being loud or something.

Speaker 2:          01:38:39       So they go to one of the guys is like, Hey, could you keep it down? And then when he comes back a second time, the guy opens his jacket and shows him he's got a gun in his waistband. So the guys like fucking, I'm not getting killed over the Goddamn Improv, you know, so he goes, tells the manager, the manager knows that the head Honcho of that gang is a big fan of show. It goes to shows there. So, and he's in the room. So they go tell the gang leader that like, hey, this other guy just flashed a gun to one of my staff. And that guy just turns in the middle of the show to the guy who, who showed the gun and was like, Hey, no. And so he got up, went out to his car, put his gun in his car, came back, was like, sorry about that, and they were like, all right, there's no involving anyone else and no throwing him out or just like be a, be a decent guy. Put your gun in your car. Christ. Yeah. That room was chaos.

Speaker 2:          01:39:40       No, I did it. I, I've done the room before it. Yes, go ahead. It was one of the first clubs that I said I would never go back to. I told them on stage, I go, you are the dumbest fucking people I have ever performed and they were howling laughing. I go, you don't understand. I'm so serious. I'm like, I'm not coming back. Yeah. I remember Diaz having some choice words about it too. He was when Diaz is like this too fucking crazy. Still fucking crazy down. There are a lot of nail was a close second. I would say Miami. It was number one in Fort Lauderdale at the Hollywood improv. Yeah. I always had a good time there. The Seminole. Yeah. For me. I mean, that's when I was like coming up, whatever it was. Okay. Dot. A Bluetooth, Bluetooth. Oh, those Bluetooth taxis. I remember those guys stopped.

Speaker 2:          01:40:32       They ended, thank God. Isn't that weird? Do you know of Ryan sickler story about that? So he had a, uh, he needed a tape for something. And so Ryan sickler is one of my good friends, very funny comic set up. And you know what it's like when you taping a set for something, you want everything to come together. So he sets up a camera in the back of the Hollywood improv and records his own set and he's up there having a great set killing leave stage like I got, I got my set to submit to whatever thing he's sending it in for comedy stars or something. So he's just happy he gets back to review it and a guy sitting next to the camera, the tripod with the camera as soon as Ryan gets onstage was like, hello. Huh? Comedy Club comedy. I'm at a comedy club.

Speaker 2:          01:41:22       And throughout. Ryan said, you just hear the guy on his phone calls saying over and over comedy club, I'm at a comedy club. So that's what Ryan has a tape, guys yelling, I'm at a con, you know Bluetooth Man, that Bluetooth Cleveland though. It's interesting. I don't want to see them anymore. It was almost a point of, um, it was like a, like a floss. It was like showing like you were telling people that you had one. It wasn't about I need to get calls all the time. It was like, you see the blinking, I'm a businessman. I'm balling Cleveland Improv. It was just like a sea of Bluetooth ear pieces. Man. I gotta get back. By the way. That one was rough, terrible. Cleveland seems to have made a comeback though. Cleveland is doing. And I, and I, you know, I've had great shows in that city that I, I, but that club, Cleveland Improv, I definitely had some fucking really bad crazy shows.

Speaker 2:          01:42:25       I mean, there was a guy arrested during the show who he sent back because it says one pound chicken wings and he goes, that wasn't a pound. And they were like, it's what it is man. He was like, take me to the kitchen and weigh, weigh them. Cause I know that's not a pound. And they have a, by the way, this is one of the clubs that there's a permanent police officer stationed in the lobby. And so they were like, no. He's like, well I'm not paying for it. So they just get the cop and they go, hey, here's the deal. And the cop goes, look, I thinking like this is, look man, you're either paying for them, I'm taking you to jail. And the guy just goes, there you go. Go ahead. So they arrest him. Wow. Over an order of chicken wings. He didn't want to pay for it.

Speaker 2:          01:43:10       Wow. This is not a pound. That was the Cleveland Improv merge stolen off your tape. I had merged, stolen at the Cleveland Browns who still your March people like they were like, we want a picture. And they like totally distracted me. And then when I looked down I was like doing my own thing. Then like, you know, I have plenty of these, there's like five gone. They just set me up for a picture and then I turned back and they were gone. Like, know who the people were. Just see them leave. Did you go after that? I mean, I, it's like I turned and I was like, Hey, I'm telling like this security guy, like they just stole it. He was like, yes. Sucks man. Like it wasn't like, you know, it is man. People Steal Shit. You're in Cleveland. Yeah. Tried to sell cds. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:43:52       man.

Speaker 7:          01:43:52       Yeah. I was such a rough, the first night I ever did the Cleveland Improv, uh, uh, uh, John and a pimp. I have a chart, you know what I'm saying? The pimp, the hooker and the John, we're getting in a fight right at the front row and they got thrown out like this is who took a hooker to a show. Yes. I found out later, I didn't know at the time and I was just starting my set. Here I am my first time in Cleveland, just trying to survive and I look in there, they're getting ushered out. I'm like, what happened? Well, it was a hooker and a the John, they're in a fight and that it had done anything on arrest and they have to, yeah, I've had people vomit in my showroom on Cinco de Mayo. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:44:27       As a Cleveland and probably the ones that was grinding through a rough set and this guy and the third goal goes, uh, he goes terrible man, like fully loud. Like this guy's terrible. What's up man? And then some lady in the bag goes, your mama should have swallowed that nut. Like God, meaning like this is in Cleveland? Yeah, the Cleveland Improv. Wow. I was like, damn, yeah, I go, your dad should have stuck around to raise you. And then, oh, and then like I got out of there pretty quick. It was, what did she say when you said that? Uh, it, it was just, it was, there was so much oohing and aahing and like, and swearing, and then she was, she was removed. So like she was allowed to say her thing. I said my thing and then there was like, fuck, fuck, fuck. Like fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

Speaker 2:          01:45:16       And then they actually throw them out. What happened after that? The show calm down or no? Yeah, they let me, it was like as I'm winding into the closing bit of the set, so I was like, it was right before I shut it down anyway. Like it was, I was about to close and then, yeah, I mean I remember I walked pretty fast offstage though as I got out of there, but that was, that was, there were some rough sets in that room and yeah, Cleveland's rough. But, but hilarity is, is pretty fucking different. That's different. Yeah. Different. Yeah. It's like, it, it's a beautiful room and like, you know, I mean, they'd probably has great clubs. Don't get me wrong. Yeah. That's like a rough rule. How's it different?

Speaker 5:          01:45:53       Yeah, I was there recently with Fitzsimmons polarities. Yeah. I was there on a, I can't, I flew in on Thursday night. I had a show there on Friday and uh, fits in misery on Thursday. So I did a set on his show on Thursday and it was great. This is great. He's hilarious. We started out like a week apart from each other. Did you really? Yeah, yeah. Literally a week apart.

Speaker 2:          01:46:13       I just did his podcast couple of weeks ago. He's a natural, like when we talk about the skill set of conversations. Yeah. He's really good at it. His Dad was a big time radio host. Yeah. Oh I didn't know that.

Speaker 5:          01:46:24       Yeah. Wow. Greg and I did so many fucking cakes together. We steal each other's material. Really? We had a deal cause we both, neither one of us were really, we really shouldn't have been working, you know, we would only like 20 years ago. More. More. Yeah. Like 89, 88. Wait, how long have you been doing it? Since 88. August 27th, 1980 h wow. And um, so we're coming up on your anniversary. Yeah, yeah. In 19. Yeah. In 2018 it will be my 30th anniversary. Wow. Crazy. I'm exactly half that. Yeah. Um, and anyway, um, so Greg and I would like, would do gigs, like when we're a year in and we'd get paid, you know, to go on the road. And so we had like a deal, like you could do my material to your materials were really good friends. So he's like, dude, you're fucking material is killing in Connecticut.

Speaker 5:          01:47:16       And he was like serious, like yeah, I would tell him no that bit that you do. I did that and fucking Rhode Island. But it was like it was parachutes for you guys. Oh yeah. We really shouldn't have been working. I mean, we're doing comedy a fucking year and if something went bad it went bad. You know? Like I'd never recovered. Never. I mean I can, you know, you got to have a shit joke and just bounce back from it. Toto, if somebody stumbled through something, you can bounce back from it. Back then there was no, there was no recovery. I remember opening on a bad joke and just riding that bad way. Long set. Yeah. You open bed. Yeah. I didn't have a way to put it back together. Yeah, you come out stumbling, you just never get your balance back. Now you open. If you open bad, you'd be like, all right.

Speaker 5:          01:47:59       You know, it's the one place where you won't work where you want, where you won't get booked. He's just like, I'm not going there. Like where's the Cleveland Improv? Well, does they cultivate a bad audience? Right. That does happen. It's, you know what the problem is? It's the same thing that happened, um, with Miami did with their, with their club is that they used to like announce that you can get free tickets here. So like I remember one time going there working and I was like, check out this line. This is awesome. It's going to be, it's going to be great. And the guy goes here, here for the free tickets. So like when you're, when you cultivate this is free. It just, it, you know, it's, it's, it's, that's why there's been so good. It does. But when you just go like, look, these are $5 tickets, you're making an investment in your night in the show.

Speaker 5:          01:48:48       And that changes it. And I think Cleveland did a lot of that too. A lot of like this is free. It's the worst thing you could ever do to a show paper it because then the people just start talking. They don't give a fuck. It doesn't mean anything to, they'll get up and leave in the middle of the show. Yeah. Nothing invested in it for me. It's Connecticut. I don't go to Kim. Yeah, you told me that. You're telling me can I can suck my dick the whole state. The whole state. No, no disrespect to anybody in Connecticut. Disrespect. No disrespect. I did it like two times this year. Yeah. Yeah. All those people, you know, you know where you live. I did Yukon. I had a great time at Yukon. I did the college. Yeah. A bunch of people from somewhere else. Yeah, just stuck in there. That's true. If I can guarantee that they'd bus people in from New York and Boston, I'd do a show there. He would never do the Foxwoods Fox. Where are you most excited about to go on the store? I like Texas. Well, I mean I just, I like going places where it's fun. There's something about Connecticut that's bleak. There's like a lack of opportunity. This

Speaker 8:          01:49:48       is something bleak about it. It's, it's almost like an illegitimate state. It's like a highway between Boston and New York. That's really what it is. And it always feels like that when you're there just feels weird. Like there's a lot, like almost like there's a sadness that permeates the show. Even when they laugh. Like I love that you hate a place that much bad sets. They're like, I hit a lot of places when the cameras are off, we can talk about them then. Oh, well Diaz and Ari and I did a show at Fox woods a few years back and um, and I told them before I go, it was like a Monday and a Tuesday night because they had a comedy club at Foxwoods comedy club and restaurant. I had to put that on my website. I had a bad, it's comedy club and restaurant had called, they make you say an restaurant.

Speaker 8:          01:50:37       Restaurant. Yeah. And make you make you on the, on your promos. They're like, could you fucking say the full name? Oh my God. I had a bag when there, I had a bad set. That was great. That was the last time. And I was like, never again. I told you guys before, this is probably going to suck. And Ari was like, I knew it was going to suck, but I didn't know what was going to saw. I got, yeah, it sucked. It's just, it's just the people were, they wouldn't stop heckling, they were yelling out during Ari set yelling out during even Diaz is like, we just shut the fuck up. Like yelling at someone thrown out of there and afterwards, like some of the staff was like, so what was going on? And the other thing is

Speaker 6:          01:51:19       bad thing about people don't realize about casinos is that there's a, there's an like this total idea that it benefits any aspect of the casino to keep the customer happy regardless of every other circumstance. In other words, somebody is upset at the restaurant, uh, well let's try to make it right because they're, they're here at the casino. We want them to stay happy, keep getting, they go to a comedy show. Well, whatever they're doing, it's fine. It's like, no, no, no, whatever they're doing is not fun because this, this is about the show. But the venues point of view is this is a gambler. This is somebody who's here to spend money. So we should always acquiesce to their desires and needs and, and don't, don't do anything to upset them. And you're like that how that works man. Like this is, this is our show.

Speaker 8:          01:52:07       My favorite what the Casino Gig. It's always how they, uh, you know, you've got the Ding, Ding, Ding, Ding, Ding. The machine sounds and they're like, but there's a curtain that separates the comedy club from the Ding, Ding, Ding. Denae and you could still hear it like they actually have a show in Vegas at the south point. That dirty. Yeah. Like you're, you could look out and you see the casino while you're on stage. The back of the room. There's the bar. I don't want to fucking casinos right there. Um, it's weird. Can I ask you, would you ever date your mom? Uh, definitely not. First of all, she's older than me. Second of all, she's my mom. Well, why I'm your mom and you're my son and I if falling in love with him. He says, are you really? I said, yes, I am. He said, you know what, I was scared to let you know too. I am too. Both consenting adults. If it comes down to it, you know, it's just like the gays there, there, you know, as long as they're over 18 everything's fine. You know what I mean? The U s wants to gel them for 18 months with that'll fix it. They got arrested. They actually got arrested. Oh well this should definitely arrest them. There's a fuck if you want to fuck your mom. That's our point.

Speaker 8:          01:53:19       I don't care. I don't care at all. But I think it's at the, he wants to marry his mom. There comes the legality is a shit. She got a tattoo on her face. I said go for it. Go back to her. Definitely like relaying that. It is just like the gays, the same. Mine is the same, but there's nothing quite like marrying your mom. It's very strange though. See them making out. It's horrendous. Ever. Get your mom and he said, what you did your son. I said, 19 years, you're the best thing that ever happened to me and I really want to be with the rest of my life.

Speaker 8:          01:53:58       Don't be bag of potatoes Tattoo on her face. It's just like the gays. Oh, we're the best thing ever. I asked, I asked and there's no k in that. Yeah, that's a tell mom. There's no doctors that say, I asked him where's the hurt? Like asked him fake. It's so, it's so crazy. It feels like it, but I think it is real because I read a followup articles about like getting arrested and everything. So what do they do? They tell them, you got to stop fucking the Gar. How they do it. That, yeah, that's true. But I also feel like if you're fucking or like you want to get married to your mom, like you just stay inside and don't tell him. Yeah, it's that they're doing this. See, that's the problem with today's society is that everybody has to be out and proud about every stupid fucking thing they're doing. What happened to you? A little sense of shame. Keep it inside. You know, it's fucking weird. Yeah. It's weird. Yeah. It's just like what the gays, the gays, the gays.

Speaker 8:          01:55:07       No, no, no, no. There's other gay people they see that's, it's definitely, unless you're fucking your dad, it's different. Well that's different fantasies. You do feel guilt or shame around them. Maybe you've never allowed yourself to have them because it pink you would be a horrible person if you ever went there. So it's all suppressed. She went on to say that she started to masturbate and then thought of everyone in her family and realize the only one that turned around was her dad. She thought about her mom and her son and all these people and she said, didn't do anything for me.

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       Dad Did. And it also made me think, it's just like the gays, you know? Real quick, where are you with me? When we were, uh, when I did, I don't know if you were with me that time when I did. Um, what's it called, Jim? When it was opie and Jim and, uh, we watched that. Were you with me when we watched the footage of the guy at the car port, the guy in the garage, the Asian guy. Jesus. Which one was it? What? What was, let me see. Oh, did you

Speaker 15:         01:56:16       this footage?

Speaker 8:          01:56:19       It's a car backing into a garage, like a mechanic shop. Basically his face while this place he, does this look familiar or no? Not yet. I've seen too much. Yeah, that's true.

Speaker 15:         01:56:35       Did people ask like different, okay. Not seen a lot of laughter on Joe's goes face. I see a lot of broken

Speaker 8:          01:57:06       that dude and Ceca. How concern his friends are. Some happen. Well, yeah. Look, look at how fucking cold back. I still don't hear Joe's laughter, you know? It's not really a too many injuries. Injuries to me aren't funny. What's interesting is let's keep going with this thread. Why aren't injuries funny? Just like I see people get fucked up all the time.

Speaker 15:         01:57:33       Yeah. It's called,

Speaker 2:          01:57:38       that guy's got a broken legs. Broken hip, like the impact with that, the cement wall and then the toolbox and then his legs, the legs of the soft thing the legs are going to give. That's kind of funny though.

Speaker 8:          01:57:49       The nothing funny about that. To me. The wait a minute. Wait, that's interesting. What did you just say,

Speaker 2:          01:57:56       Joe? That's how funny to me. Yeah, me neither because I think we have empathy or broken legs. Yeah. His work this out before. No, I really don't know. I'm not good with injuries. Really. Yeah. I always do too many injuries. Here's my problem. My God, I've always laughed. I think it's because of my own fear of them. Probably on some level. I've always had a, like I remember one time I worked construction in Florida one summer and one of the formulas, like I had a bathtub dropped on my neck and I started laughing so hard, like tears running down my face. He had a bathtub dropped in his and he had a permanent, uh, morphine pack's sewn into his insight into is just drip it on his neck. And I go, oh Jesus. I just laughed and laughed. I go to stop laughing. So crazy. But I mean it's not even

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       a, it's not a calculated choice to laugh. It just happens. That's why I think it's it. It's cause I, I actually fear it happened. If it's not calculated, it's just starts happening. It just started happening. I can't control myself. I see so many injuries. That's true. You've seen people's heads get bashed in and you to realize I've probably seen more people fuck people up like physically and fights then maybe almost anybody who's ever lived. That's probably true. Upclose yeah, I've called. I mean there's probably a few guys that are closing in on me now. Numbers wise, other commentators on fights, but I've commentated thousands of fights. Yeah. Think about that. All the different concussions. I've seen all the different knockouts. Now here's the funny thing is that I really don't, I don't laugh when I see head trauma. No, no, it doesn't do it to me.

Speaker 5:          01:59:33       Like leg trauma does it. Leg screaming. The screaming is like, it makes me laugh. Being crushed by the left Pelvic Steevo did show me this new guy that he's working with. Steve O's like mentoring some young psycho who's doing a lot of like jackass style Stansa and this kid put on a speedo and rode a skateboard off of a makeshift ramp into a pile of cactuses. Oh, it was so fucking crazy. I was watching it. I'm like, oh my God. Like my whole body. You know that thing we get when you see someone about to get in an accident and like, yeah, tense adrenaline pumps through your body and like, it's almost like you feel like sharp pointers all over your skin. Yeah. That's how I felt when I saw, I've watched this kid launches body into the cactus. No, we saw one last week. Uh, remember that, that whole thing where this dude was trying to do at Jackass and he and he tied a rope around his nut sack and tied the other end to a tree and then ran and jumped. Oh No. The rip his balls off. Yeah, he die. Well, I don't know no balls anymore, man. It's this, don't show it to me. Show it to me.

Speaker 5:          02:00:58       Uh, when I came out dip shit when I came out. Well, what did you think was going to happen? I can't even look at that. I don't like, I can't see like, that doesn't make me laugh at deputies freaks me out. But do you think that, I mean, this is like a cliche thing to say, but don't you think that that in some ways is evolution like that there are, there's dumb people that will do dumb things and it's almost, they're supposed to die or lose their bill. I mean it's, it's kind of symbolic

Speaker 8:          02:01:40       that this guy's tying this to his reproductive organs you're offering. Maybe it's an unconscious wish fulfillment. Like he doesn't want to live to reproduce. There's something there. I mean, what, what would be best case scenario there? It would hurt his balls and they wouldn't rip off. Yeah, right, right. He jumped with a rope tie. Oh Dude. Oh my God. Oh my God. God. Okay. All right. All right. So, oh my God. Oh my God. Anything else Jean? Far, far and no, I mean, I wanted to talk about your morning farts, but that, you know, I got it

Speaker 6:          02:02:21       and mourning for it as opposed to what evening farts they different. Well, I'm a real, I don't know if you or I wake up with lots of noises. No, just all heart horror game. I'm a symphony and the music

Speaker 8:          02:02:35       find that your digestive tract and everything is working better. Excuse me. Working better since your diet? 100% yeah. He used to shit a lot worse and now it's much better. Yeah. He used to have like diarrhea every day. Yeah. I think he's allergic to sugar or some reaction

Speaker 6:          02:02:51       buddy is the one I have. Like even now, you know, I'll, I'll be pretty clean for a number of days or even weeks. I'll be like, I'm gonna eat this right now and I'll indulge in something rich in sugar if fucking never agrees with me. Oh, kills you. Yeah. You got used to it for a while, right? Yeah. And now that you're not used to it, your body doesn't know what to do with it. That's what is this. I actually found that, um, in a lot of times what I want is just like a taste of something. Oh, he's have a bite and I'll be like, I'm actually, I don't, I used to go like, I'll have 70 bytes of that and now it's like one or two kind of satisfies it. Yeah. And then I don't feel sick. Isn't that Zevs stuff? Fucking amazing dude.

Speaker 6:          02:03:29       I love it. Hate it. She needs it. The uh, the water guy spit it out when he was throwing water. Yeah. Martin Teresa spit it out and, and uh, but my theory on it is this though, as somebody who's like restricting themselves from sweetness all the time, it's like an indulgence you can have. Yes. So it is like, it's, I notice it's a lot, it's too sweet for a lot of people's palate, but you don't know how much sugar there regularly having other words. For me, I feel like it's that, uh, it's like the free cheat. Right? So you have your z via, you taste sweetness. Again,

Speaker 8:          02:04:03       it sounds, it doesn't bother me even a little, I enjoy the taste. I feel like it's too synthetic tasting. That's what bothers me. It's like I liked the Dr Pepper alike taste, but yeah, I like a loquat. I'd rather do that. Oh, those are great. I love those too because those are so light. Yeah. We know they have Zevia water where it's just a good, the tiniest hint of flavor. It's more like a loquat. Okay. Right. Yeah. So they have the cvs soda, the of v a um, energy drinks too, which are amazing. Hmm.

Speaker 6:          02:04:31       Really good. This is so much better tasting than red bull. Oh yeah, totally. People, we get a lot of songs and people send

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       in songs they make. Do you know, like somebody made, let's go water champ that you said into a song and they do at least tell the audience so I can have pretty good. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          02:04:47       That you're impressed with my water consumption. You're the water champ champ. Or as long as I've known you in power, the water in the water. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Water chaps catchy pounding the water. Water champ out on the water. The water.

Speaker 2:          02:05:15       Does that bother you? You guys are competitive, are you guys competitive with everything? Just where it can you guys competitive with stand up. Zero personality. Literally zero. Probably. Why we transfer it into like water and personalities. So it's never been like, this is a real argument but like, but I mean it was, it was real when we were arguing initially about who drinks more water. I thought it was, no, I had a doctor telling me I should stop drinking so much water use. What kind of doctor was he? Urologist. He goes, you're drinking too much. You drink, drink far less. You have to remember she's, she's an exaggerator didn't really tell you to stop drinking was he goes, how much are you drinking? And I told him, he goes, you don't need to do that. That's a myth. He goes, just drink when you're thirsty, you're over hydrating.

Speaker 2:          02:06:03       True Story. Can you over hydrate though? You can if you go really, really nuts if you go like look a radio contest or when we um, when we did water cut for the weigh ins, uh, I mean I don't know exactly what, I know I didn't feel good but I drank over a gallon of water like during that pot. The last podcast didn't have to pee yet. I remember that you kept throwing down the water. We talked about it. You had like nine or 10 fucking bottles, but I mean that's not good. Probably my body was like so craving water, but you just wanted to win that running away show. That was a horrible, that the two or three days leading up to those weigh ins were just horrible at our house. I mean he was taking hot baths and then going into the Jacuzzi and drinking distilled water and then going to Burke Williams and doing the sauna and then there was a lot that he was going to die.

Speaker 2:          02:06:54       Really did it though. That was what was impressive about it. It's like you fucking went for like Burt was kind of pretending to be going for it, which is really interesting because you were talking shit to them and I know you're being comedic, but you were also being honest, like this was calling playing catchup suckers. You guys want to buy into that shit. Yeah. He, he was trying to catch up at the end or is you had a sustained effort, a discipline to effort over long from the jump off. I knew that that would be the two ways psychologically that we'd go. I know from the very beginning that he had a, you had to deal with his craziness. Yes. That was the thing about crazy and I even talked to him about that and I said, the crazies going to help you. I go, you're going to need more than the crazy I go, because you're crazy.

Speaker 2:          02:07:38       He's going to help you, but your body can only lose so much weight over a short period of time. Right. So don't think that, because Tom's not fucking around. I go, he's really doing this. So like you can't just rely on crazy. Yeah. It's like, I know, I know. I know. I know. I'm all, I'm only drinking double Tito's and sodas. So crazy. It's so crazy. So his videos, he's always so drunk that I worry about him man. Cause he's like, what, 46 now or something like that. How old is he? 23. Oh, that's not blow off.

Speaker 2:          02:08:08       But what's crazy is okay, but here's the thing, say he's 43. You can't do that when you're 50. I agree. I agree. And you meet Kinda Ken, but you're, you're going to fall apart. Well you can't if you have those Mickey mantle jeans. Yeah. That long form DNA, long strand DNA. Yeah. You, there comes a point in time where your body is like, hey man, you can't do this every day. I know. It's enough. He does have an incredible standing, uh, to, uh, the, the ability, you know, like I'm admittedly not a party guy man. Like if I have a few drinks and I'm 38, I mean I feel it for days. He has that. Like, he's just like, what, let's go out. And I'd be like, dude, like when we, when you say very graciously sent us to go watch the calves and warriors play for, for doing the weight loss thing, you know, I mean, we were like drinking in the morning and I was like, I got to go take a nap.

Speaker 2:          02:09:03       He was like, I'll go to the bar too low. And I just, you know, I, I took a nap and like, I mean, I had to like really pace myself by the way. It was whatever came out of that with Ari. Ari, uh, well as, I mean, people know now he's, he was gone for a long time. He, uh, finally came back from his, uh, his vision quest and four months, four months off, I'm going, no, right. 85% of it was to avoid his debt with you guys. But he, uh, as long as they just don't have an email or don't answer her phone, he said that he did a podcast. He opened up by saying it was because, uh, Tom's tastes or so outrageous though he snacks on caviar. Yeah. So it's pretty funny. It was pretty, it was very funny. His podcast coming back was hilarious.

Speaker 2:          02:09:50       Very funny. And he was actually even joking around that. That was why man. Um, he's like, he called me, he goes, all right, where do you, where do you want to go? And I go, I don't know. He's like, I've got to fucking do something. Like I get like a hundred tweets a day. Like pay you already took care of it, dude. I, I told him I go, I don't, there's no, I don't want to go fine. But he was like, oh take you somewhere. Well he fucked up when it, when it happened at the time you're supposed to step up then. Yeah, he was trying to figure it out of it. Yeah. He was trying to, you know, 0.1, two, five things shorter. I'm like, all right man. Yeah. Well what was his, his, his argument, the BMI. He was like, he's like, well BMI wise you're not actually six feet, you're five and eight tenths.

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       So your actual BMI to get out of that, it had to be if you were an inch taller or no, they said 25 pounds. Right. Dude, it was kind of write it down on paper with him. I know, I know. I learned my lesson. There's some other crazy shit he say. No, I'll tell you later. Dump dump now. All right, we should, we should, we should wrap this up. So, um, is there anything else you have? Okay. All right. Uh, thank you for coming Joe. Yeah, my pleasure. We'll do this.
