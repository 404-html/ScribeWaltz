Speaker 5:          00:05:58       proper. Like

Speaker 7:          00:06:00       hello my little Munchkins and welcome to my channel. I'm sexy. And today's topic is of course no leaching. You came here because you're curious, you clicked on the link to see what the heck is vaginal leaching and why would a woman put out of all things leeches in her vagina?

Speaker 5:          00:06:26       No, bring it in one loving.

Speaker 1:          00:06:30       Well welcome to your mom's house, Christina pushes. It's interesting. Is this for you?

Speaker 5:          00:07:17       No, I know. And I looked at all the clips when you were gone this morning and I thought this one, he's really going to get a cake out of an eye. I was this close to asking you, Hey, what did you, what are you thinking for the opening clip? But I was like, I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt that he's going to choose something different than vaginal leaching or um, reading national discharge off of a panty line. While you should checked your doubt at the door. Cause that's what we're up to, right? Yeah. Yeah. I think a little bit of, um, I don't know what the word, what's the word, like a infantilism or something happening here where she's, she's very much a little white girl. You see Minnie mouse in the background. That's what she is. That's her little doll in the background.

Speaker 5:          00:07:58       Right. She's got Minnie mouse and then pink, pink pig, the heart hangers. Then I just noticed that now her titties. Yeah. Yeah. And she's got a necklace this pointing stripping ges into her titties, you know? Yeah. So she wants you to see him, but that is a thing. Um, psychologically when a girl, we're like, still wears a lot of pinks and they're an adult. I think it's like, that's why like those porno girls, they talk like really girl hi blighted. It's like that. Your feet refusing to be a woman kind of thing. Of course, it's terrible. Of course you put them

Speaker 7:          00:08:30       the China, the amazing women would put leaches in the vagina is to treat some kind of condition or to improve their health and wellbeing, um, to improve their sensations, whatever the reason may be. Mainly it's health reasons, of course. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:08:49       Of course it is. Duh. It's like drinking your P to, to cure a cold. And I just, cause I haven't seen any of this. I just noticed that those are leeches right there in that jar. Yeah. Yeah. You think so gypsy? She kind of looks like Roma. Yeah, I can see it. She's like, she's my tribe. Yeah, totally. She's my tribe. She's somewhere like Romania or something. Right? Yeah. It's fucked up. How did you discover that that's what your vagina is not, you don't think it would be good? It's not just for health reasons. It helps sensations. Helps everything.

Speaker 7:          00:09:28       Sensations. I came across a very, very interesting, should I say article placing leeches in her vagina in order to conceive a child at the age of 50 so I thought it was quite interesting and I thought I'd bring it to your attention.

Speaker 5:          00:09:49       Yeah. Very nice. He didn't bring that to our attention. Seriously though in the, this is would be considered an educational video. Right? Right. Cause she's trying to really look at the hangers for real, but they really are out there, right? Yeah. I mean there's how many unbuttoned buttons you see? One, two, three, possibly four is on the fourth one down. Yeah. I mean, well babe, did you think that she was a scientist? Well, I think she's trying to give off the idea that this, that she has knowledge to share. So if your video is about

Speaker 7:          00:10:25       how dare you, you're so misogynist. Well, no, I mean I liked that. I like him. Why can't she be hot and smart? Why can't she be a doctor and slutty at the same time? Tom,

Speaker 5:          00:10:37       Gabby, I'm in totally in favor of her tests. Painting her with that brush. Just because you're, you're funny doesn't mean you can't be sexy. That's true. Sorry.

Speaker 7:          00:10:48       I know I'm going to also do real life demonstration. Not using myself using the site. A little doll. Oh,

Speaker 5:          00:11:02       so your pussy get leads. That's the whole test to show, man. That's a science pushing legion show Dan. Well then do it on fucking live league so we can see your snatch. Yeah, man. That we get a lot of use. I know that clip and this is gypsy

Speaker 7:          00:11:19       meaning explained that her first treatment was like having a pap smear. Okay. The doctor plastic device known as a speculum, a stock kilo. This is what the device gets. Slide straight triggers out of her mind. No Shit. God Damn it dude. And the doctor inserted this baculum into her vaginal canal and then proceeded to add three leeches and then allow them to do their job to do

Speaker 5:          00:11:53       to her uterus. Oh, we always nasty is healed. That is so foul, man. That's fucking, it makes me cringe. Y what can be more natural? Look a bit more love and then putting it leaches and your vagina. I uh, just knowing what vaginas are like, I just don't think that's a good idea. I don't have one, but I can, I've seen a few. I don't think that's a good idea. Just what do you mean? I don't think it's good to put leeches in your puss. What I'm concerned with, I think it's okay and your puss, but then it can go into your uterus and then it's like, well, how'd you get the leach out? Leach wants to. That's what I'm saying, cause she, it sounds to me like you're really opening up the badge and putting something in. It means it can go through your cervix and into your uterus and probably cause massive damage to the elite doesn't have a pager. Right. You can't be like, hey, you got to get back here now. Do what it wants. Right. Unless you're tying strings to all of their next and then you pull them down. I mean this is the crazy sharing.

Speaker 7:          00:12:50       Really comfortable with why he wasn't he was doing. Nina said that in an interview. We just basically attracted themselves to the inside of her cervix hatched. Oh, inside of her cervix sound very pleasant when the therapy was over, the leeches dropout. Sam coming out fatter than a bottle of nail Polish.

Speaker 5:          00:13:11       Oh. Oh. So they were really enjoying them, sucking the blood so they suck the blood out of your cervix. That's, I can't be, I can't, sounds like a nasty sounds like those leeches Kinda. Yeah. Lot of Stan. A maybe just a little bit of glass glass. Oh man, bitch, you crazy. Now, why doesn't she do it if she's so stoked about this man? I don't know. Let's see if she explains why c

Speaker 7:          00:13:40       side effects for the curious and Manju, you might be surprised to know that the vaginal leeches did their job after eight months of using just covered that she was pregnant at the age of 45, much more energy than before, but that wasn't the only side effect of the leach therapy.

Speaker 5:          00:13:58       Eight months. What every day. I got to explain more than that and I don't, I really can't see how that would help. Fertility has nothing to do with, uh, does it give you better egg quality? Does it as she's in they're nuts. This is nuts.

Speaker 7:          00:14:13       I also noticed that my orgasms were longer and more intense. She confessed in an interview stating that she had some of the best orgasms after each different around of treatment.

Speaker 5:          00:14:29       That's awesome. You know, I know this, I mean, we all know why she's crazy, but again, I have this theory about the makeup. Uh, whenever you see a girl, first of all that color is bananas. Lipstick. Yeah. But when you see the liner of the lip, Lennar going above the line of the lip there, you see that trick and she think she's fooling over here. That's how you know bitches cray like crazy. She's on a visual, like you just glass a bitch. And if that make up goes up over the lip line. No good hound. Or she got makeup tattooed on like tattooed eyeliner. Oh, we also saw last week the shadow eyebrows like into the eyebrow. Like if a bitch for eyebrows are too thin, I mean tiny pass could tell. He has a joke about that. But if your eyebrows are all fucked up, you know, you color them different colors. I knew a girl who had purple eyebrows and like Booboo, that shit does not look good. Nobody likes that. No dues aren't gonna like that.

Speaker 7:          00:15:28       I have my little friend here to help us demonstrate it. I have my jar leeches and our little Minnie mouse. Johnny's going to help us demonstrate how not to damage.

Speaker 5:          00:15:46       Like you imagine if you're on a date with this woman, you know, and like you're just like, oh yeah, she's attractive and you're having dinner. And then she's like, come over and then, you know, all right, uh, what, what do you want to do? And she's like, have you ever heard of valley? Imagine will leach therapy. They're like, wait, what? He's like, I'm going to show you on my Minnie mouse doll. I sliced her pussy open so that I can show you on her as opposed to help for health and, and also orgasms. At that point you're like, you know what, I have a meeting in the morning that I forgot about

Speaker 7:          00:16:16       when the woman looking at her whole, she cut the fabric out of her legs need to be put together like this. Knees have to be opened to open up your knees, put your legs when you're in labor, check you. And if you can play some mirror and shine a light, I wouldn't advocate that self belief in yourself to do this. She's telling you how to do the shit at home. Bitch, you crazy this. Um, no, no, that's true. Once it's inserted, you will then open it up at, first of all, it's really simple to open yourself up with a speculum. Right? The instrument keeps the vagina entirely open.

Speaker 5:          00:17:11       Yeah. What's, I mean, even just doing that to yourself, probably not easy. No, it doesn't seem easy. Well, it doesn't feel good when someone else does it to you, let alone doing it yourself. Like there's no way I can imagine that's just like you're at your Thursday night, you know, it's horrible. Once a year I got the speculum and putting these uh, leeches in my purse right now, where do you even get the leeches? You go to a pet store

Speaker 7:          00:17:36       and this will come out really, really huge. When it's fun. So with the knees or feet together, like her smile, you will then proceed to place. The leech all the way is in your first step all the way inside. So unless you're all the way deep inside, at least the Leech. Thank you.

Speaker 5:          00:18:16       Shouldn't do it. I don't think you should do it. I don't think you should do want to go ahead and say that I will. I don't trust this lady, but what if the what if leaching your penis could make it bigger for you? Do it. Everyone would do it. If you told the Dude, hey here, Dick Hole. If you put a legion there, it'll grow. But you could tell them all you gotta do is slice it up your deck off and put a leach in there. And guys like all right. Yup. The ers would be full of dudes at leeches on their dicks. 100% yeah, that's definitely a Leech is definitely not going to make it bigger. I don't think so. I think it's going to make her dick smaller. Well what if you could be like, but it sucks the, the nutrients, the blood. It replaces it with whatever you can say anything. You can make it. Yeah. Tell him to put it in their asshole and then they would put a leaching your ass. Will you typically at beggar? What? Honey? Honey. Honey, help me out here. Here. Hold. Hold my ass open real quick with this thing. Yeah. Yeah. Tighten the knob. It can you see a real big good. Now put like 10 or 12 leaches up in there.

Speaker 7:          00:19:13       What if it gets stuck inside my uterus? I won't be able to come out. I'm here to tell you that there's absolutely no chance the leach getting inside the cervix. There's no way because the walls, the lips of the cervix or like shut closed and there's really not much passing through.

Speaker 5:          00:19:42       Yeah. Except when you opulate or when you make a baby like, well how do you think sperm gets through the cervix? You Ding Dong, it opens, it opens and it gets her. Yeah, she's so sneaky. I don't know where she got her medical degree from. Harvard I think is what I was reading in the little.

Speaker 7:          00:20:01       Um, and then once they're finished they will crawl out on their own. Ah, girl, Don, you too. Um, how long have you tried anything open again to remove the leeches that's now going to be happening? The leeches are going to crawl out by themselves.

Speaker 5:          00:20:21       Okay. So you just, you're just sitting there and then a leach cross it or coach it just slithers out. I'm done. Oh, you're done. Oh, there's three more in there. Just give it a minute and they're all fat. Oh God. It's so nasty. So glad you shared that. You know, we got a bunch of emails and messages. People were like, do not make fun of this guy last week. The cook the chef. Yeah. And I don't even remember how I even know who he is. Chef John. They're like, don't fuck with chef John. Yeah. Because he has, all we're doing is saying this guy has up speak like very, oh that's, that's the chef I, yeah. Yeah. This guy, for some matters we probably be, you're one of the great mysteries of the culinary world since, how can there be a recipe for re fried beans when there's no such thing as a fried bean recipe?

Speaker 5:          00:21:15       See Fried bean recipe. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to go ahead and soak one pound of pinto beans and cold water overnight and like everything these days, there's a lot of controversy on whether you should do this or not and I'll let you do your own research. But I've been a been soaker from way back. Yeah. So I did that. Mine Soak in cold. What's a bunch of Bursa really love this guy. I don't know. I don't know anything about him. I mean the been soaking controversial. My God, I guess some people don't soak their beans. I like the sub mine plenty. You Soak your beans all day in your hands like this?

Speaker 5:          00:21:48       Uh, yeah. I didn't know that guy was famous. Yeah. Oh look how the tables have turned no wrong here. You have a Zvm. No, I have h two o I have my bottle and then at Fiji is mine too. So yeah. Well anymore for me it's probably the first time you drank water today, so I understand. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Um, anyways, so yeah, a lot of people, chef John I gotta heat for Chef John, Huh? Yeah, they, yeah, they were really real. A lot of people have chef John. But then we got this, uh, from a, uh, an Ozzie listener of ours said that this guy, Frank Walker, whatever he talks about, he does have speak in Australia.

Speaker 8:          00:22:33       Hello Frank Walker from national tiles this week. National Tiles had a beautiful range of polished porcelain floor tiles slashed by up to 30% or more.

Speaker 5:          00:22:45       Hey, he draws out every single word. Yeah. Or one out of every fight. He was, whoa. It's definitely, it's definitely a hook. Yeah. It makes you remember that how that guy speaks. Yeah. Well, you know, it's, to me whenever any Australian person speaks, I'm like, oh, that's funny. It's not, it's not American. You know, it all sounds different to me when I hear him talking. I liked it. It definitely sounds different, but yeah, there you go. That's funny. It's that in America I think they all talk like this is what I'm saying. Like, oh, I don't hear the distinction so much. Whenever I hear an Aussie speak, I was like, yeah, uh, uh, yeah. It just sounds wacky. My, they all sound wacky cause it's not American. Yeah, I hear Ya.

Speaker 8:          00:23:23       It's until this Sunday only at national tiles. Beautiful range of polished porcelain floor tiles, but only until this Sunday. Right. International towels now and save go do I website for details. National tiles.com. Dot. EU.

Speaker 5:          00:23:41       If I was a producer in the booth with him, I'd be like, Hey, you keep these words

Speaker 6:          00:23:46       and you should stop doing that, and he would probably be like, that's what I always do. I pick, I pick a word and then I make it eight syllables when it's to do not like it and I'd be like, no, I don't fucking like it. Stopped doing it. Wow.

Speaker 8:          00:23:58       Hello. This week, national tiles had a beautiful range of polished porcelain floor tiles.

Speaker 6:          00:24:07       It's weird. It's definitely weird. I kind of enjoy it though. I like it more than a, yeah. People really liked that guy. He kept getting messages about him. He sounds like he's genuinely sweet. I think that's what it might be. Oh, here we go. I think you said this great. You called him a Gay Lord. Oh yeah, that's right. Hey, do not call chef John and up speaking Gaylord chef John was created by God herself. Her share seven minute video recipes. He taught me proper knife techniques like what does that she full nod. Do you even know what that shit is? Doubt it. Well, obviously no, I keep my knife technique high and tight. You spit in the face of cuisine and art. Chef John's angelic Singsong cadence is evidence. There is a higher power in this world. Comparing his cherubic delivery to vocal fry is an affront to humanity.

Speaker 6:          00:25:05       This is the lowest looses thing I've ever seen from your mom's house. My balls are dry and I'm slightly sweaty now by Hitler. Dustin. Ps, I'm off to make a sell. I salt crusted beef tenderloin. And what does that mean, la? Uh, I dunno for dessert that you barbarians would not know anything about this guy seen die hard. Die Hard. They love him. Sorry. Sorry Chef John. You talk like a retard but tiny like a Gaylord retired. Okay, Lord. Stupid Retard. But you're apparently a great chef. Speaking to that. I was going to be sweet. Yeah, you were in the bathroom. You came in. I go check this out and on my own. I just had the thought can retarded people drive right? And the answer is yes. It just blew my mind. Really blew my mind too. I did not think that. I don't know. Remember what I remember why it happened.

Speaker 6:          00:25:59       Now I went to the Fedex to drop off a package and as I was walking back to my car, I saw the car that was parked, you know, head to head. And I go as high retarded guy in the driver's seat. And I thought that cause I retarded guy. And then I got in the car, I looked at him and it wasn't, but at that moment I go, I wonder if retarded people can drive. He just looked retarded. He looked retarded for a moment. So I just kind of, I looked at him and I go, hold on here. I just kind of looked put together that he wasn't. But then the question was in my mind, the burning question, and I looked it up and the, here's what I found out, there's no rules anywhere preventing them from driving. It's crazy. Here's the thing,

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       if they can pass the test, that's what it's all about. So if they pass the written test and they pass the actual driving test, nothing says, well you pass these, but you're, you know, retard drive, Corky Thatcher on life goes on. Was he able to drive, he was able to act. We know that that guy could realize and memorize them. Yeah. That's fascinating. I think it probably is all all about down to the degree of your disability. In other words, how, how, well it was looking for another way of saying, but yes, how severe your retardation is. So if you're like super retired, then you can't drive. But if you're pretty put together, you know, I'm trying to think in my Rolodex of retarded people that I've known, if any of them could drive again, you know the guy in life goes on. He was pretty highly functioning. He could memorize lines and do things like that. Yeah. I'm wondering if that guy can drive, I mean some of them have jobs, you know that this before and so whether or not it would be pleasurable to be retarded, if you would know that you are retarded. What? That's horrible. Horrible. Is a genuine question. Pleasurable to be retarded. Maybe if they don't know they're retarded, then they're just kind of living in alone.

Speaker 5:          00:28:05       There's no such thing as not knowing. It's all I do is eat lots of sweets. They all know. Stop saying they don't know. They know. They don't know what they're missing though, by not being retarded. Um, all right. Maybe to a degree, like they don't, they don't know other pleasures besides masturbating and eating. What else? Ultimately that's all you want. That's what I'm saying too. I agree. But there's others, there's more refined things like, uh, enjoying a film, reading a book, going to be like a watch films retarded. Yes. But they don't understand. They're not going to watch the same white bummer movies that we watch or you know, hey, yeah, no bureau watching a real bummer the other day. Well, I was sick so I though, you know, what could I do? And I, I got roped into 13 reasons why the Hannah Baker suicide show and they rubbed me in because they played joy division on the first episode and I was like, oh fuck.

Speaker 5:          00:29:00       I love it. I love depressing teenage shit. That's my, that's my jam. It's to me. I didn't watch the whole thing, but I watched probably half of one episode and then half of another episode with you. It just seemed like an afterschool special, like the way that the writing and the acting like it was telling a story, but it was like, it was really like, you know, kind of doing it for kids. Right? Well, yeah. I mean the show is about teenage suicide, so they have a moral obligation to make it palatable, I think, to that audience. So when I walked in I was like, what are you watching? Like a fucking afterschool though. That's interesting that uh, you're like, what are you watching? This is depressing where your favorite stuff is

Speaker 9:          00:29:42       like, and she came home and found her husband murdered. There was blood everywhere. Becky was terrified. Little did she know the murderer was still in the house. What the hell is that? That's your show that you watch. Watch. That's what I hear as I'm falling asleep at night. It's all your murder, whatever. Murder shows you like. It's always about like reenacting or the, they are not, they haven't found the killer yet. Which is even more terrifying for reality crime rate. Yeah. You love that stuff. Like the real depressing. Like I watched fakes suicide like fake murderer, but your jam is like, I like real killing, like real human suffering. You know? That's true. Real hardship. I started uh, the new Fargo. Yeah, you did. I fell asleep so fast during that. I gotta tell you I don't have as much of a hard on for that show as you do.

Speaker 9:          00:30:36       Maybe it's the mid like admitted what? You relate a lot to that place. Cause you, you lived in the, in Minneapolis, it's, yeah, it's your, those are your tribe. But I'm telling you, I really feel like when you break down the whole thing, the writing, the storytelling, the cinematography, the directing and the acting, I don't think I've seen a better show in 10 years plus than Fargo. The great British baking show. I mean it has drama stakes. Cinematography I duck is a rope off Chris and Marie Battery Chemistry. We did finish it. No wait, wait. How was the FARC go? How was the first of the stuff? Should we have better call Saul? Dude, we haven't even fucking seen that. The new new, yeah. So Americans, can I tell you something? I'm watching the Americans, I'm not dazzled to Csun. The Americans has maybe turned a corner.

Speaker 9:          00:31:28       Yeah. It's not first of all, last season we had so many compelling stories on this law, on the episode that I just, we'll finish the one that started to fall asleep on, they did just hit a holy shit moment, good storyline. But I feel like they kind of dropped a lot of the storylines from last season, like page putting them in jeopardy by talking to that asshole pastor and her fucking the neighbor boy. And it was like, I didn't like it. They never killed that guy. I mean they should have killed pastor Tim. Yeah. Fuck him. It doesn't make sense. It made sense that they would give the diplomacy a shot, but then that should have failed and they shouldn't. I agree. Because like he's going to keep the secret there to have that happen now. I was very excited to see the outcome of season three.

Speaker 9:          00:32:16       Spoiler alert if you're watching on Netflix of the victor was Nadia. Yeah. And you and I were rooting for it. Tamale and Nadia, the two outliers, both young, both Muslim bakers, uh, she wears her full, he job, her head dress made sure it makes her look very different than everybody else. But I her because she was an outsider and I like that she's like a housewife and the best part is, uh, the bummed out husband when they did her package, like your interview and the husband was like, uh, we've all been missing Nadia. She's been doing this bike and show and I've had to do everything for the children. You can really see that. He's like, I respect her a lot more now know that she used to come home and stop baking on your bullshit show is what I took. But also he's like, I didn't realize what she did.

Speaker 9:          00:33:06       That's what I got. She was like, guys alive. Oh, realize how much should she does? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was more upset that she wasn't, uh, still cooking and cleaning at home course. It was nice to see that she won and it really meant a lot to her. That's the thing that I took away. US Gray. She cared so fucking much about that. I didn't think I could do it. And then I did do it again. She goes, oh, I didn't think that I could do it under no phone could do it. And No. I said to myself, I can do anything. She speaks with a 100% British accent. Yeah, but I did British. That was British. Pakistani. Yeah. You had a little bone job in there. Okay. Well she's from Bangladesh. Yeah. You're hearing is Bang Bangladeshi. Hmm. I was throwing it in there and she's, she doesn't really have a Bangladeshi. Yeah, and she does a little bit.

Speaker 10:         00:33:55       Okay,

Speaker 9:          00:33:56       well do you do her then do her victory speech.

Speaker 10:         00:34:02       Oh,

Speaker 9:          00:34:03       to when sweet chocolate. There you go. That's not how she sounds. I think so. That's how Mary Berry's hounds more. You're doing Mary. So glad to Paul. Hollywood

Speaker 10:         00:34:18       does. I don't like this. I don't like it.

Speaker 9:          00:34:23       I don't like it, mate. No, he got it. He goes, I don't like it. I'm not tasting the rhubarb. I'm not tasting the almond. If you're gone, if you're gone and put pineapple in it. I'd like to taste the flavors. I like your layers. Nice bike. It's under bike. I'm not getting on flavor. Coconut wiped out everything. Too much moisture in the bike.

Speaker 10:         00:34:44       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:34:44       I love when they say oh no, he, yeah, he went to Channel Four. It like a rival show. Yeah. Yeah. Big, big controversy and UCL. Yeah, we'll see what happens. But all the wood, I really hope there are more seasons that we get to see cause I'm just, ah, it's a, it's a great show. It is a great show. We started watching the Zombie show that everybody's fucking was in love with this. We're good at at um, a show becoming a hit, like a really big smash hit. And we go so, and then six years later we're like, I'll check it out. It's like, okay, I see what you're saying. So we just started the walking dead. Yeah. And it's fantastic. And we're like, man, I guess people had a point, those 12 million or so people that said watch it at a point. Now, here's the problem with the show is that we like to watch before bedtime, and I find that it stresses me out. I don't stressful. Can

Speaker 5:          00:35:37       I say my least favorite genre is like, we have to keep running from the evil thing, right? Because I have nightmares about running and all shows. I don't like that. Those evil running and chasing things. Hey, chase shows usually end on a cliffhanger. So they end with like, wait til next week, Huh? Like you, and then you feel like, sorry, the next one. And that's what the whole fucking thing's going to be is them running for the next 10 years. Right? Yeah. This is shows years and years in now. All right. So what they've built like a, a human land like on the Matrix and the second we were total newbies. Now we're fucking two episodes in. What can possibly happen? They have to kill all those. That show is so good.

Speaker 6:          00:36:14       Big that they started a nother show where they talk about that show that airs regular, like it's called like after or beyond. Yeah, something like that. And then it has, I think it doesn't Hardwick Kosta, retired week show Jesus Christ and they're just talking about another show and then the networks like yeah. Err that err, err us talking about it

Speaker 5:          00:36:36       that show bananas. Yeah. Well we have to stick to it. I guess if I watch it early in the evening, maybe I can do it. I wish there were more movies. I like movies, my heart pounds so much when I watched that Zombie show. Yeah. I get, I get really emotional. Like I, you guys have to run. You just keep going. Like I hate it, but yeah, I agree. The movie selection or fucking crap shit. Yeah. When his fucking, uh, John Debt, my WIC Dick to coming. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:37:01       You know, we bought it, we bought dip my Dick in the WIC and it, I remember it said April. I Dunno,

Speaker 5:          00:37:09       I can't wait to see that one. I'm excited for that one. That's a good one. Dip My Wiccan Widdick come.

Speaker 6:          00:37:15       Um, we asked you and will continue to ask you to write reviews on iTunes because it's what's fair and we deserve it. Here's one that somebody sent into us. Uh, Mommy's, I thought you would appreciate my review. Here's what he wrote. Calling all come dogs and ugly suck pigs. Your Mom's house podcast is here for you. Have you ever wondered if there's any common those balls? Everyone is just fluid bomb with Jesse. Ever wished a mentally ill girl could talk to Hitler as a child? Did you make your own poop pile for the neighbors to admire? Do you have big old mushy purples? What about sloppers meet hangers? Tits for days. Do you have Dick for days? Do you find cops to be all bald and shit? When you're Puerto Rican, you are just Puerto Rican. Uh, excuse me. When you're Puerto Rican, are you just Puerto Rican? Are you dirty and disgusting?

Speaker 6:          00:38:16       Do you find yourself farting on all the haters? How do you feel about Lincoln Din? What's with the jeans? Um, do you often instruct strangers to kiss your pussy? Have you on occasion bellowed bikes in the presence of strangers? Do you ever wonder which you are if you answered no to any of these, I don't give a shit. Listen to your mommy's and you'll find that you've been the water champ all along. Stay thirsty. Come Dogs Ryan. So Ryan wrote that. Ryan, that review made me want to listen to our show. Yeah, that was really good. If I read that, I'd be like, I've got to check this shit out. Intrigued. I like all these subjects. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:38:59       Good job. Check this out. I don't know if have you seen this? This is um, this came in with regard to our discussion last week about taking a pilot's license off the table. For Fuck's sake. Here we go. Dear Mr. Thompson grew up. My name is Barry Brown from the law office of Brown and Yellow family law attorney. I am Christina possessed keys official negotiation representative. This letter is in regards to the negotiation of ceasing and desisting from acquiring a pilot license. We would like to officially reject your first offer of one blow job per week for the sum of three years. This would equate to 156 blow jobs to be delivered over a sum of 1095 days. This amount of fellatio is extremely unreasonable. We consulted a professional and April 20th doctor Throat Zilla. She deemed this activity to be excessive and dangerous for an amateur and only to be attempted by a professional sex worker.

Speaker 6:          00:40:04       My client and I would like to present a counter offered to be paid over the sum of three years, 50 blowjobs to completion. These blow jobs will be accompanied by verbal stimulation with such sayings as where's the com? Do you have any come when those balls, five of these said blowjobs will be wake you up in the morning. Bj's, Oh wow. 50 hand jobs to completion, cheese lubricant of your choice and as a bonus on Thompson for his birthday and the third year of the agreement, Christina participates in pup play. This will include fitting Tom for a tail and they walk around the neighborhood on a leash in parentheses, nothing sexual. You feel this is more than generous and I'd like to remind you that your relationships are about compromise and look forward to finding a resolution. The two parties can agree upon. Sincerely, Barry Brown from Brown and yellow family law.

Speaker 6:          00:40:52       I love, I didn't, I didn't know. I know, I didn't know you retain counsel retain. Yeah, he's working on retainer. It's, you know what, we sat down and we came up with these, I hope you're okay with these terms. Well you'll be hearing from my attorney. So I mean that's fair is fair. This was, I'm also very surprising to me and we had a pretty impromptu but in detailed conversation with each other and then with my dad and uh, with Charro about folding or scrunching paper, it's a no brainer. And guess what? Guess what I found out from my mother and then they called me little Jane

Speaker 5:          00:41:33       went home. She's a scratcher. No, yes, no. My mom called me. She goes, just would not believe this. And she said she, I guess she poked in or you know, Jane's on the can and then she's like, she uses a mountain of paper, like, like just tons of it and she's a scrunch or I don't have a, it's not a moral thing. It's not a waster thing. It's about scrunching versus folding. I don't care about the environment. My problem is it's not practical because the pool can touch your fingers if it's scrunched yellow, brown all over your feet. Guess what? This is apparently a worldwide discussion. You're kidding. Have you seen this? You mean we started a worldwide debate.

Speaker 1:          00:42:23       Debbie squared [inaudible] Scott are a

Speaker 5:          00:42:43       nation divided, some scratch or this full crazy where, what country is that? Uh, obviously that's fucking the UK. You just looked in the title. Yeah. You said what country is that? How many could it be? Because it could be Ozzy. It could be Kiwi because that was a playful UK accent. It wasn't a strict Royal British accent. I mean you as a low quote master of all people should know. Of course. I know, but it's, yeah, they're usually, I'm tired. I thought for sure Australia cause you know, they're kind of more fun about stuff like that. But you could tell that accident was in Australia. I don't know. Like I said, it was a very playful, very playful fuck. You live there and you don't even know. No, no clue. It's a, it's hard. It's, and then you got your, well she got your Yorkshire. Good, good Yorkshire Lass. You, by the way, I am soliciting, uh, for the benefit of our show to your mom's house.

Speaker 5:          00:43:43       A Nice, we want you to write reviews on iTunes. It is a benefit to this show. We want it, I'm asking you to write a review and uh, you know, we'll keep learning the industry fucking retarded. Can I tell you the thought that I had while I was sick? Sure. First of all, I just want to share this, that, okay. So I was sick for like fucking 14 days. I didn't, I wasn't getting any better really. That was, that was weird and gnarly. And then one morning I woke up and I blew my nose and it was like fluorescent yellow. It was like a highlighter marker. Dude. I, I'm in 40 years of existence. I have, I wanted to show you so bad. It was one of those things

Speaker 9:          00:44:31       I was so proud of and I've, I panicked and went to the doctor immediately. Um, but in that, in the interim of like having this cold, I was picking my nose and awful lot and then it was like almost to a point where like, I knew something was wrong. Like I was, I was definitely, it was becoming too much of a habit. And then I thought to myself like, am I going to stretch out my nostrils forever? Right. The Google that because my texts and my friend, uh, and she was like, oh my God, Dude, I've been picking my nose a lot too because of allergies and I'm wondering if I'm going to permanently stretch out my nostrils. And my dad told me when I was a kid that he's like, don't pick your nose so much. Are going to widen the nostrils. Yeah. What did you find going gonna look like your uncle Steve because he used to pick his nose.

Speaker 9:          00:45:17       That's what my dad said that because my uncle picked his nose a lot, his nostrils became bigger and you know, here's something in your formative years and you believe it. So I googled it and it said no. The fact that it's not possible. You'd have to be doing it like all day, every day to make an impact. And I can disagree with me. I feel like you look in my nostrils now, aren't they enormous? I think pregnancy made them bigger. Get bigger. Your coach, you can gauge your ear Lobes, right? People stretch out ear lobes. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. I have enormous nostrils. Yours are big and hairy, but I feel like I grew in the last, I'm serious since I got Prager's. My nose grew and I feel like my nostrils. Oh, look how big they are. Yeah. You're just kind of look like, let's look.

Speaker 9:          00:46:09       You have a prosthetic nose. Really? Yeah. It looks like it's so, you know like Steve Martin in that movie? Yeah. Movie Ponzel Roxanne. Yeah. No, yours is big and uneven. It looks like the right nostril is twice as large as the left. Actually, everyone's nostrils are different. Sides of my face is perfectly symmetrical. I'm the symmetrical champion. I don't know about that. Yeah. My body, my everything. Symmetry. I'm like a model. I'm perfect. No. Do you know that one of my legs is significantly shorter than the other? My right leg is about an inch or more shorter, and I went to the chiropractor. You're going to get one of those a handicap placards for the corner.

Speaker 9:          00:46:56       I wish. God, do you think I can? Does this qualify me? So it's about time. I wonder if it's hard to be, we'll need retarded placards. Let everybody know. Jesus. Wait, so you, you agree with me that, that picking your nose a lot? Definitely. If you do it enough, I mean, I guess it also depends on the size of the finger. I mean, you shove a big dogs in a bunch of big old dogs and your coach, you can stretch it out. Why can't you shove a big a finger in your nostril and stretch it out? Well, here's the difference, Tom, and I like your reasoning. I like your train of thought. Yeah. The Vagina, however, is a muscle and can go back to, it's some kind of losers. Loser. Poundings yeah, multiple accounting's all day. This isn't a nostril. This is cartilage. And so again, I just, I feel like that again, the ear lobe is, seems to be more, most similar to this. Yeah. If you're a doctor, can you write and let us know if I've made my nostrils bigger by picking and if pregnancy can in fact make your nostrils bigger. I feel like it, I feel like it's, yes. Yeah. Yeah. He just intuitive of course. Of course. It's one of life's biggest questions.

Speaker 6:          00:48:05       It's, it feels like it should be an easy answer. And I think that answer is yes. Um, this is kind of a dad Boehner thing where I kind of, I've got to tell you, this is one of the first Dad Boehner clips where I, I feel like I'm aligned with this person. Really stoked about,

Speaker 11:         00:48:24       look at that. Look at that in a shine in us of that. It's an ounce. It's amazing, isn't it stuck and what a feat of engineering. Yeah, I agree. E I t five p I. E. Chief five pain. Haley. I did staggering

Speaker 6:          00:48:46       tiger. He's, he's holding up if you're listening is that he's holding up nail clippers. But I feel like I've had this, that type of thought before about things like that and maybe even nail clippers themselves. But you're like, this is an incredible tool that is mass produced that we would have no idea how to do this without that. Um, and wouldn't, none of us could build one of those. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         00:49:10       Can we make it so cheap? Did a shine in. I shed that match. Oh, look at the engineering. I know. I agree. The inclined plane. It's amazing.

Speaker 6:          00:49:20       Oh Shit. He's so good.

Speaker 11:         00:49:23       So just start in a day saying go make one of them be there for a week. I know for a month. I know Mike [inaudible] is good as I know. Yeah. Awesome Metaphor for life. This was such a amazing, it's staggering. It knows no bounds, but it's cheap. Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap light. Check in check. Like fucking chicken. Oh, oh, oh. Why I t five bay last. What life is worth us. What fucking line. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:50:16       Yes. The first time a dad boner. I've nodded along.

Speaker 9:          00:50:19       Hi. Great. I love his enthusiasm. I share his enthusiasm for that. Yeah, that was rad. I mean, what other things are there where you're like, holy fucking shit. Pens. That was my first, that was my first thought when I was thinking, what else is that like you take pens for granted, pair, amazing paper clips. Some motherfucker was like, let's make this shit then and then do that like that. And now I can hold fucking papers to talk about a stapler. Scotch tape. Amaz hairbrush Amaz like everything we use, uh, bandaids so that you booboos don't get infected toothbrushes. How are low or Ular, but that, that is a feat of human engineering for sure. I mean, how he's right. If someone was like, hey, build a Nalco, no fucking idea. And it looks simple and that's why it's deceptive. Remember on the Great British baking show?

Speaker 9:          00:51:14       Because everything leads back there at when they're like, make a pretzel. And that's something you see a hundred times in a mall. Right? Because we were there a lot. I couldn't recreate the shape of a pretzel. I don't know exactly how, but you see it somewhat that some version of it be be like, that doesn't look right. Right. It's like the thing you take for granted all the time. It looks so simple, but it's not coffee. I want a coffee right now. I know you drink a lot of coffee. Does your piece smell all the time like it does cause one time you peed in the shower with me and it smelled like someone. I'll be honest, coffee. I was probably drinking too much coffee and I focus on the counterbalance more. Now you bounce it out more. Yeah. You have to rehydrate after you dehydrate.

Speaker 9:          00:51:56       You Nasty. I love this guy. I love him. I love it. I love it. I had the horrible misfortune of, of all the millions of times I've dropped my iPhone and I'd do it a lot. I can't believe that. Go ahead. That it finally shattered. I broke the screen on my iPhone and you know when you do it at first, like there's a moment of disbelief. Like I, it took me about a week to come to terms with the fact that I broke it, you know, like to just, it was like the stages of grief. Like I have to do something. You know why I, I had the stages of grief, that Kubler Ross thing because I don't want to go to the fucking apple store. Like that's my nightmare is making the fucking appointment showing up. And then the, the, the search for who works here and then just making eye contact, hoping that that person's an employee with a ponytail and then just go stand over there.

Speaker 9:          00:52:51       That's my family knows stand over day and said, by the way, the lack of structure, goddammit, this is what is upsetting the apple store. It gives me so much anxiety. We're not a regular store. We have our own thing going on here. No, no, no. Give me the regular store. Let me stand in line and let me know where I am in line, how much time I have kind of go to that. Fuck you. Yeah. And I'll tell you what else can irritate the shit out of me. So when I had that audio trouble with this one, I was also having audio trouble by my other one. So I go, I'm going to bring both. When I pick up the one that's

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       fixed, this one I go, can you take a look at this other one? [inaudible] you gotta you gotta make another appointment. You can go over to that table and sit there. I'm like, well you're right here. Can't you just can't I just leave it with you. It's fucked up. Just fix it the way you fix this one. Cause that's outside of the wacky way we do. We don't do things traditionally. We don't do things the way that would make sense to do them. No, I like tradition guys. Let me know where to go and where to stand in line. And then the worst is when you activate a device. I activated my mom, watch, go, go stand at that table and then it's one employee and then five old people like me, like I don't know how to put in my password. And then she has to divvy up her time between the five poor girl, old people, some poor millennial has to help you figure it all out.

Speaker 5:          00:54:16       And then the guy's like, dammit. She goes, I've been there sitting next to guys since she goes in, then you know your password. Now you don't know your password. Uh, no. Uh, granddaughter's name is Brandy. And then they're like, okay, we can try that. And then I saw this old lady who had the tiniest iPhone there ever was like the first one, you know, it's like, uh, just a, an an inch of this. And she's like, but I wanted to work again. Like she was some foreign lady and the guy and the guy was like, oh yeah, I know that your motherboard is fried. You need to buy a whole new phone. And she's like, but go god, magnus, one word, please, please make the one word that I have. Like she couldn't come to Jesus on it. Like, please don't make me spend $800.

Speaker 5:          00:55:04       Please, please just let me have my old ass phone. Make it work please. And that's all you're thinking when you go in there and just please make this, make my life right again. Just make my life okay. Oh, oh, okay. Oh, by the way, I wanted to mention this. So I was, um, when I, a few weeks ago maybe that this point a month or so ago, I had these shows coming up that were for Seattle and Portland. So I reached out this great artist in Philadelphia, Paul greenies. And I go, I go, Hey, do you want to do a poster? We've worked together before on other posters. And he said, yeah, he goes, any ideas? Cause he always says like, you know, is there anything you want incorporate? And at the time I remember that, um, everybody has been mentioning that whenever I put up photos to promote my shows, they're all pre weight loss. So they're all like, man, none of your, your pictures look like you. Yeah. And like, you know, so I just mentioned, I go, well, you know, I haven't had anything that reflects my weight loss. I'm like, just nothing. So far everything has been like photos that were taken before. That's all I gave him. And then he made this. I love it. I love it. And so it's me with some

Speaker 12:         01:01:52       scientist video series continues our look at chemicals on the cheap. So if you're a cash, it is essential in a home lab both as a reagent and it's a precursor for synthesizing other chemicals. Until recently I recommended battery acid is a good source. Battery acid, it's about 35% concentration and relatively pure. And it was cheap a few years ago. Five gallon jugs sold for 15 or $20 in gallon jugs when only $6 or so

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       recently a lot of doors and found the price. It's sky rocketed to about 15 years. It makes it extra boring

Speaker 9:          01:02:28       his face. Yeah. The fact that he hasn't moved a muscle and he hasn't blank to the entire time. How do you stay that still dead eyes? God looks like fucked up shit. I think he molests children to Jesus. I wasn't going there. I think he molests retarded children. That's creepy. He looks creepy and we're going to get emails like, Hey, that's rob the chemical go. And so it was gonna be like, that's my dad. You asshole.

Speaker 5:          01:03:00       Well, your dad's creepy as fuck scissors. Another amazing adventure. Notice I'm wearing very heavy rubber gloves, acid addition to burn. Your voice is so monotone. It's also an extremely hydrating agents, so it literally sucks the water out of your skin and charge it. Whoa. Wow. Don't mess around in fight club with concentrated sulfuric acid.

Speaker 9:          01:03:33       There you go. I think that's what happened in fight club. The concentrated sulfuric acid poison on the Tyler Durden is hand Tyler pours it on Jim Norton's hand. Isn't that what they did? Jim Norton? You mean Ed Norton wrong with you? I do that all the time. And then we heard, um, Jimmy Dean Stanton on the radio the other day. Oh yeah, the sausage. Jimmy Dean Morgan Sausage. Jeffrey Jeffrey, James, Jimmy Morgan's, Jimmy Dean sausage. That's who it is. Jimmy Dean sausage. Jeffrey gains. Jeffrey Dean Sausage. Morgan sausage. Yeah. Um, I have some, would you rathers come on, man. Really? You want to do it? Would you rather what is, you have something else you wanna do? No, go ahead. Go ahead. The top layer.

Speaker 13:         01:04:46       Your sister, grandmother walks masturbating. Never have another orgasm. [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          01:05:05       are you ready? Yup. Okay. Would you rather, every time you see somebody, and this can be like you're walking the dogs, which never happens, but you're out with a kid and just a neighbor

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       passes by you. And every time you see another human being and they get within your shot, you rep all loud fart. Okay. One of your morning farts, like you fucking blasted. Okay, okay. Or every time you see Ellis you get so you get so excited

Speaker 10:         01:05:35       that you vomit.

Speaker 5:          01:05:40       Okay. Or every time you see Ellis, you get so excited that you vomit all over yourself. I don't even see that. How you have the nerve to pitch something like that. Being that you have such a ridiculous phobia for the eye, you know, even that concept. I mean, you get so you get man. Yeah, I know, but that's why it's called Woodridge. Just Game Babes game. It's not reality.

Speaker 10:         01:06:05       Rather. No, I'm not listening to them.

Speaker 5:          01:06:19       You're so happy that you're able to take them off lies and lies. I promise you I'm not so either. I'm, I've fart within earshot. Anytime I see anyone. Anyway, so you're, you're at the airport and it just try every new person. Welcome to the planner. Whenever I see my son, I vomit. Yeah, you get so excited that you eventually vomit on yourself. No fart. I would eventually learned to deal with that. Like the embarrassment would become second nature. You know, it's like somebody has like a fucking goiter on their neck and it's like, oh my God. But after they have that for like a year, they're like, yeah, I got this fucking thing on my neck. You know, and like people look at it, it's embarrassing. I don't care anymore. That's how those farts on the positive side, you know, every time you come out on stage, you rip a huge into the mic and it's Tom Cigarette fighting comedian, comedian.

Speaker 5:          01:07:16       It becomes a hug plus chicks. There's chicks would be like, this guy is pretty fucking cool. Women love burning guys like the guys that, that Fart openers. Now I don't have to keep farting. Right. So I can, you know, keep framing every time you have a question about that, because you said like every new person, so I had a show do I farted like a thousand times? If there's a thought that yes. Now that I think about every time you look at somebody, so you've got to pick like five people to look at you like, Hey, make the show room pitch black. I don't want to see anybody that's, that's your work around. Okay, that's true. Of course I'm farting. What are you doing? Is it even worth the time our nanny comes? It comes in. Yeah, you get used to it. She'd be like, yeah, he's a nice guy. We go to the playground, Ellis and he see another parent. You flirt. I mean, it's going to hurt. It's going to ruin your life. That's great. Did you come up with that? No Way. Would you have answer it though? What's yours?

Speaker 9:          01:08:16       Well, obviously funding because of my severe phobia of vomiting, God damn severe metaphor. I'll balance this. Where yours listener ones. Okay. So people have been submitting them as well. Okay. So, and then we'll go back and forth. Uh, somebody's rights. Would you rather read the entire iTunes update agreement from top to bottom? Every word no skimming. So funny. I'm like God or a shit. Listen to Frank Sinatra and Garth Brooks. Oh Man. One after another. For the amount of time it would rate. Take you to read the iTunes of Green Nolan from Winnipeg, Manitoba.

Speaker 9:          01:08:57       You know, I'm one of those people who might find it interesting to try and understand the iTunes agreement. What I get very angry at. Um, auditory assaults like that. Like it would enrage me to listen to Garth and uh, and then you throw on you be 40 and I would just be like, oh, I think it takes to read the iTunes agreement. I mean, it's possible. It's easy to get to scroll on. It's on your phone, but that phone snap, do I have to understand it? Oh, you don't have to understand it. You've got to read every word. I'm a quick reader. I'm not like you. I don't have to sound everything out and can move my lips. When I read to myself. It might take 10 minutes. It's fine. I went to law school for two weeks. Don't forget, that's like reading an iTunes agreement every fucking day to the iTunes agreement.

Speaker 9:          01:09:40       It just upsets me. The whole thing. The idea of reading it upsets me. Yeah. Yeah. It's all like legal jargon and yeah, and I was a paralegal, so it doesn't bother me. Holly's like you have any qualifications for that stuff? No, I don't, but I, I was an immigration parents. So what? It's still intrigues you. It doesn't intrigue me, but I mean, I've read boring stuff like, yeah, no. So 100% I would listen to Garth and frank for that amount of time. Yeah. I'm not much of a reader, Huh? Yeah. Well not breeding fucking iTunes agreements. I can't believe you're signing up for that. I do it for fun right now. You'd read the iTunes agreement, pull it up. I'll take a look. I'll let you know when it says God. K. Yeah. Okay. What'd you rather, every time you leave the grocery store, are you listening to me or are you paying attention?

Speaker 9:          01:10:28       Yeah. Every time you leave the grocery store. Okay, and someone's pitching some nonsense, you have to stop and fully give them your presence and listen to, they'll hold children, save the bees, save the tsunami, whatever. The other thing, and then you have to donate the, Oh my God, what's wrong with you? This is so good. You have to do this for the rest of your life. Every time. Every time. They're out here, everywhere. Everywhere. I know trader Joe's, trader, sorry, Trader Joe. You got to go to whole foods and you got to listen to the whole spiel and then you have to do whatever it is they want you to do every so there's no hurrying out of the grocery store is when I saw you that lately, by the way, I've noticed that. I must be giving off a do not

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       even think about photography because I have noticed them skipping me a lot. Like I walk out and there'll be two of them and they'll be like, go talk to another person. Well, your beard makes you look angry in medicine and you probably just look angry. Yeah. Yeah. You're not like, I've told you this before. You're not fun. You're not engaging. You're not friendly. You're not social. That's what a personality. Other people see me full of shit and they approached me. They want to talk to me. They want a hug. No, very huggable. Kissable enjoyable's of human. Okay. You know that. That's not true about you. That's so true. I'm so many know that that's not true about you. I'm so between the two of us, likable. Everybody would rather spend time with me. Not True Bait. That's not, oh my God. I'm talking about like in the comedy club world, they're always like, how's that fucking?

Speaker 5:          01:12:06       All I hear is Tom hate me. No, you know Tom doesn't hate you. He hates everybody. Okay. So it's either this for the rest of your life. Every time you go to the grocery store you have to do that. It's a really good, by the way, really good one kill or once a week you have to go to the apple store to either have something repaired or to buy something, but without an appointment. Oh my God. Once a week or every time you go there as both robbing you of time. Yeah. That's the whole point. Aggravating and they're going to, they're going to wear on your last nerve and it's a hassle. I'm trying to think which one would I rather do. It's horrible. It's an excellent with your other, because they're both equally undesirable. Horrible. I think might end up murdering of parking lot petitioner.

Speaker 5:          01:12:56       I mean at least in the apple store, I'm acquiring a toy. You know, like in the grocery store I'm acquiring a necessity. It's probably you have to food and things for the house like that, but it's a toy. So maybe I can look at the toy reward as like that's the payoff here. I mean, you get some cool gadget here pretty soon, and every once in a while I'll land in there when there isn't a, I'm a crazy three hour line to do something. And here's your workaround to you could, you can game the system, find out when the low traffic times are right. Maybe it's right when the store opens at 9:00 AM at the mall. So yeah. My problem with the parking lot, uh, petitioners is that I feel like they work from this. They like to the worst shape come from a guilt place begins with those. Sometimes they'll say like, I'll be walking to my car and they'll say, uh, do you know that there's 300,000 kids in Los Angeles? They don't have a place to sleep tonight. And I'm like, no. Yeah, wouldn't you? Like, wouldn't you like to be able to do something about that? No. No. Well, now you can. So they're just like, they're just guilting you. They're not, they're not like sharing

Speaker 9:          01:14:12       information with you at the farm. Make you feel bad. Of course, of course. It's all, it's all manipulation. Do you want to donate a dollar to the save the teachers? Now I give money to teachers. I do, but I feel like save the children. Like do, I'm saving my kid right now. Like I'm, I'm wrapped up in a toddler. It's a full time job. I'm taking care of my children so don't worry about it. Okay. Someone else submitted. Wait, why did you choose apple? 100% man. Apple. I have to say that I don't enjoy the, here's what I hate so much about the apple store. I don't like the mall driving to the mall, parking at the mall and dealing with it. I would rather do the parking lot. So listen work. Yeah. Cause I'd make friends and because I'm friendly with everybody, cause I'm such a good personality and I'd, you know, I'd make it fun.

Speaker 9:          01:15:01       You should met both of us and fold them assigned to interviews. Well we just see like who really, really who they think has a better personality. Right? I mean it's obvious it's me because I, I actually don't believe that you believe that now people are, you have a much more cold. Yes. You have a much more cold, much more cutoff, much less engaging in warm personality. And you know it, you're always like Tommy, you go talk to them. Oh, it's not because you're a better personality, but because sometimes I don't want to deal with that person. No, because you're just, you're more of a curmudgeon. You're more like a wreck, loose that you know, you can't you, oh, I'm a loner for sure. Yeah. Well, I mean, on and on. I enjoy a lot of people's coats. Ted Bundy. I mean there's, there's, there's your, you have that same kind of am the alone champ. I definitely, but I'm very selective of who I spend my free time. I had a handful of friends that I've had since I was 14. People don't like you in general though. I would say that's not true, I think. But I think I make a great impression. Um, like a cursory sort of surface friend. Absolutely. Ask anybody at the comedy store if there, who do you like better? Tom And Christina? Not Comedy wise, like who's Funnier, but who do you like as a person who's a better personality? Hands Down, I'm going to win that.

Speaker 9:          01:16:20       Keep going and okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Would you add there? Be Skinny and eat whatever you want. You can eat whatever you want and stay then and not have to exercise, but your poor kinda stay poor for the rest of your life. Or you're rich. You can eat whatever the fuck you want. You can exercise, but you'll always stay fat. Say you're fat, but you've got like stacks. Like you're a multimillionaire and you don't have to, you don't have to work. You can work when you want, so it's skinny and poor or rich and fat and you can eat what you want. In both scenarios. I feel like for many people, this is so easy. And I think the only reason that it's, I find it intriguing to me is, uh, even though I'm

Speaker 6:          01:17:10       not skinny, I've recently lost some weight, you know? Yeah. Well this one I designed, especially for you, right? You're, you just, you just started to, you know, lose some weight. You're looking better, you're feeling better. And you know how good that feels. Oh, it's the best. But what would you like to be the best version? Like the best version of that, but you're poor,

Speaker 9:          01:17:34       poor, and you can't, there's no hope like you're and how poor qualify. Yeah. Okay. Uh,

Speaker 6:          01:17:41       I mean, you're not talking about like, I can't pay bills and I can't do anything right. I mean, it's gotta be like,

Speaker 9:          01:17:47       okay, you're not Bangladeshi poor. You're not living in a cardboard box and, and, uh, defecating and shouted in Los Angeles terms. Yeah. Korea town in 2008. Okay, so you were living in like getting by Barrio, getting by, getting by in the Barrio. But that's it. I mean, you're, you're locked in the rampart division. You're living in that apartment. Jose's your landlord. That's as high as it's ever going to get, but you look amazing and you can eat anything you want. You don't have to exercise. And you stay skinny and healthy. And that's the thing you have. You have all your health and you can eat whatever you want it, but you're rich, rich, rich. Yes. Stacking it, but fat, fat as fuck. And how fat. That's the other thing. Okay. Uh, what's the heaviest? You don't have to say the number, but whatever your heaviest is. Yeah, that's what, that's what it's got to stay. Yeah. That's where it stays now. Oh, sorry. Cause I have my answer. Oh, you do? Yeah. Yeah. 100% rich. Hundred percent. Why? I mean, I, I, you know, I remember being that fat. It's not that bad. I mean, people actually, honestly, until we invited fat shaming, no one really gave me a hard time about it. I have like one person every once in a while I would say something on social media. They'd be like, you look fat in this big. I'm like, all right. Uh, it's not that bad. So because I made the number something you've already been, okay, let's then let know. I'm saying even if you look, I could have gotten

Speaker 6:          01:19:17       fatter and let's say in this scenario I'm even fatter. I would rather have the comforts and the, the hurts of that lifestyle. Right? Uh, and no, I guess that I'm going to die at any time,

Speaker 9:          01:19:32       but you have enough money to kind of do something. I can take medicine. That's right. Right. And I can, you ain't got the best access to medical care and now you're fat. You're not manwell your rebate. Oh, come on. No, no. Listen, you're, maybe you're, you're, you're bad. You're five bills. No, you did not. That I know. This is a different scenario. So if we were driving down scenario, this is an additional question. So we've, we've had, that question's gone. New Scenario. Okay. Same, same stakes, but you're 500 no, definitely not. I'm not doing that. That's too much. Yeah, that's too much. Oh wait, who's 500 people on Tlc on those people

Speaker 6:          01:20:08       that they're like, hey, maybe in a week or two you'll die. You don't do something that's too fat. You want to know. That's like for my height and frame. What would be like, what'd be punishing for you? Yeah. I mean, well definitely the upper 200300300 would be like really heavy. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. What? For my frame? Yeah, you would be, you'd be like, Jesus, man, you really need to drop some weight. How fat was like Mama June.

Speaker 9:          01:20:37       Oh, okay. You don't know how that is a dom delouis fat. Oh yeah, he's three over 300. What'd you be damned Eloise fat? I mean, I wouldn't want to. Okay. What about God, you're still doing this because I'm trying to, I don't want, I don't know, men's weights. Like I don't, I don't know what 300 pounds is on a man. I can kind of guess on a woman. I just don't know your weight. 300 pounds.

Speaker 6:          01:20:59       Ooh. Like my, okay. Picture my heaviest. Another 30 something. 35 pounds basically. It doesn't seem like a lot to me. Fucking a really 35 more pounds on that.

Speaker 9:          01:21:12       How fat was la? The Front? Shucks. Cylance and wells. I mean, at that point he was probably, he looked like he was over 300 pounds. You're Orson Welles fat. That's the level of fat at the end of his life. Let's look at it.

Speaker 10:         01:21:29       Okay. Um, let's see what we have here. Fat Worsen

Speaker 9:          01:21:36       cause you would take, so what's, what's the lure? It's the money that you'd rather have money is what you're saying. Well, I'd rather have,

Speaker 10:         01:21:43       um, the,

Speaker 6:          01:21:46       the comfort and the security. The money provide. Yeah. I mean, your mind, I've been very broke and, uh, and I, I have no shame about having been that broke. And I feel like that period taught me a lot, a lot, uh, about myself and about life. But I never want to go back to being broke again. Sucks. I mean, yeah, that was terrible. So,

Speaker 9:          01:22:10       but you heal what have you could look the best and you'll never

Speaker 6:          01:22:13       age shitty. Like you'll, you'll just be hot fat. Orson Welles kind of looks like me. Not at all.

It'd be awesome because the level of Richard describing it sounds like it's so much fun. Yeah. You're just like Richard Brown balling out of control. All right. Some big fat rich guy. So what? Okay. It's fun.

Speaker 10:         01:23:42       Yeah.

But here's the thing. You're skinny. Yeah. And you can eat as much as you want. So I get the satisfaction of all the food. I want to gain weight, but I'm poor. So what? But I've done it. I've told you I've done it. It was a thing. It was a phase and I don't want to do it again, but I know you love to eat. Imagine you could just eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat. You don't have to gain weight. Okay. Just the free all. I think we chose our sides then. Sounds like you chose that, right? You'd rather be poor. Ah, I hate fucking being poor. Yeah. Actually I would rather be hot and skinny. Then I'll just find a guy, some fucking rich guy, some fridge fat guy and I'll be like, let's hook up and then we'll find each other. There you go. We did it and I'll marry you. Harrison. Yo, Mary.

Speaker 12:         01:24:38       Ah, French champagne. There's always celebrated. The guy pick up the California champagne. My Song, he's really good cars by Ed and I. That same French excellence.

Would you rather, every time you fart, it's a short or every time you burp. It's a birth. Every time you fart, it's a shark. Yeah. Or every time you burp, it's a birth. Yeah. Whew.

Speaker 10:         01:25:44       Um, God. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:25:52       That's a really gross, I haven't burned in a long time since I was pregnant. Barfing is the word that's really gross. I feel like you've, I birthed a lot when I was a kid. Here's, I think you'd have

Speaker 6:          01:26:04       to choose barfing though. Okay. Because, okay. They're both growth. They're both uncomfortable. Sharding ruins that part of your day completely. Like, you're going to have things you need to be doing that you're like, I have, I have shit in my ass cheeks right now. We're as, while the burping is disgusting. You can at least be like however gross this is, I could still walk into this place right now. You know, I can spit on the sidewalk. Right. But you got to change underwear when you start it fucked up. Time they ruin. Takes up.

Speaker 9:          01:26:43       Yeah. Well, I like it. That's your concern is, oh, wait a lot of damn moments. Well, listen, but listen, here's why. I choose sharp because you choose sharp because you can prepare, you bring wipes and you bring panties with you on the road. You pack yourself a diaper bag like we do for the kid. Basically our kids shirts and you just wipe it up and y'all is nasty. It's nasty. Or I would wear adult diapers and that way, dude, that's how you do this. So you just wear adult diapers, you shorten the diaper and you wipe your ass with fucking moist towelette and then you're done. Right. It's just so nasty. You can hold in a fart and that way you wouldn't have to shirt, but a birth, you can't borrow everywhere. All right, you just wipe and then you're done. I hate kissing. Fine. Hey, somebody sent in this clip. This is

Speaker 6:          01:27:43       audio only of a, your favorite thing of barfing? No, it's a pornographic film. But this one has a very funny line. Okay. Uh, tell me what you think of this.

Speaker 14:         01:27:57       You ready to be a single mother? Oh my God. Are you ready to be a single mother? Me. Here's some multis in that pussy round. Ready to be a single mother of six. Say Mother say, wow. Yes. You're not going to call my phone after this, right. I'm a block your number. You're not gonna come to my crib. Right, right. Hi. Hi. Here we go. Oh Shit. Oh, oh, oh.

Speaker 9:          01:28:31       That's pretty clever, Huh? As far as writing, I'm sure the writers spend some time on that. Nope. I'm amazed he could get out that dialogue as well as he did. And the jacket. Yeah. That was really a lot of work on his part.

Speaker 14:         01:28:43       A strong performer. Oh Shit. Oh.

Speaker 9:          01:28:45       But I mean, you're ready to be a single mother. That's a funny, very hard ready to be a single mother. Yeah. I mean, anybody that's known as single mother been a single mother. Yeah. Not Easy. I wouldn't, I wouldn't take that ejaculations oof. I know. No thanks. Because he's basically

Speaker 6:          01:29:02       telling you never, ever. I get it. Yeah. Don't contact me. I heard it's pretty funny. Um, you got an email email here. Uh, I feel compelled to weigh in on your wiping style conversation from episode three 92. Yeah. I believe that both bunching and folding have benefits and drawbacks. The bunch picks up more, but as you said, leaves you open to poopy knuckles. If you aren't careful, the fold is more civilized and protects your knuckles, but it has been known to require more wipes and is prone to punch through with a finger. If you are thorough and a committed wipers such as myself, this is why I employ a hybrid strategy. I will take a length of paper, perhaps eight squares are so fold at once. Then bunch half allowing the flap to form a tail like the train of a wedding dress. That way I enjoy the superior wiping power of the bunch while protecting my knuckles from collateral damage with the fold.

Speaker 6:          01:30:09       I hope this helps and if you choose to read my email on the show that can, that I can change a life. Keep it classy. Jeans, Zach from Texas. There's some, I hear some flaws in your logic. A, how do we know that the folded wipe leads to more wipes than a bunched wipe? I don't. I mean we need to see some scientific evidence, empirical data to back up this claim. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know that that's founded in anything. Check out this lunatic. I used to, uh, have a joke about this in my act. I never made it onto like a special or anything, but I used to make fun of people that did this.

Speaker 15:         01:30:50       What's up guys? So people have been asking me, Oh, how come? And the recent training videos, even posting, I see you wearing jeans. I mean, I just, I've never seen a fucking guy where it is in the gym before. So why are you the exception? Is there a benefit to wearing jeans? So I want to answer that question today. Why this house smells destiny? Where jeans, well, I'll tell you why. It's because a long time ago your man used to be professional climber. And I'm not talking about one of those climbers that you're going to a facility and you climb goes fucking rocks though I was a ghetto climber. I used to climb fuck a buildings, legit buildings with my fucking fingertips, you know? And what happens is that if you're wearing shorts or track pads to going to Rick.

Speaker 6:          01:31:26       Hmm.

Speaker 15:         01:31:27       So for many, many, many years, all I did is I trained with jeans. I used to do a wall runs with jeans. I used to, everything with James flips would genes, the whole fucking nine yards. And I know that sounds a bit unusual, but I don't think this is that uncommon in the park who slash climate world.

Speaker 6:          01:31:43       Yeah.

Speaker 15:         01:31:43       But if you gave me the choice whether or not I could train with jeans or with track class, I would choose. I would choose. Jeans are 100% of the time. It's fucking great. I love it. I can go ATG on a squat with jeans. Oh, I can get much tighter on a deadlift for jeans. It's like, it's almost similar to multiply. You know, you're having that extra thickness

Speaker 6:          01:32:00       here. I think you look so crazy with gyms or at the gym with jeans like I used to make, I used to have a joke about how, you know, like what are you a fuck? I forget the joke, but I was like, are you a communist or is it like a Romanian fucking infiltrator wearing because you look like a lunatic. You look like it looks like an episode of the Americans. Like the, the person just arrived and they're doing the fitness.

Speaker 9:          01:32:24       My trends. It's a Hungarian dude. Um, I this think you're kind of low and loose when you say things like that. Yeah. Given that were in your mom's house, do you think you could have some fucking respect? Yeah. Just so you know, I'm having [inaudible] pants made out of denim right now as we speak. Yes. I used to everything with jeans. I don't like spandex. I want them to be denim.

Speaker 6:          01:32:44       We both been doing pilots. I know we both did. We made fitness today. No, I wish I never had to workout by. This is the second time I've never had this happen as I'm making fitness my right tricep, it goes into a full cramp. It was so bizarre. It's just, it's one of the things I've never had it happen twice cause you're not wearing denim denim shirts and then then we're just looking at it. It's going to, yeah, like clamping up and releasing. You're not used to making fitness as hard as I do. Yeah, I think that's part of it. I'm also the fitness champ. That's right. That's right. Um, all right. Well anything else you want to fill her up? Holy Shit. That is big time. That is.

Speaker 9:          01:33:29       Hey fever

Speaker 16:         01:33:37       shot shot.

Speaker 17:         01:34:04       Okay,

Speaker 13:         01:34:08       look at bids by the way. I want it to announce that this Friday

Speaker 6:          01:34:22       we are releasing the a Yoshi live podcast episode. So the late show and Irvine will come out this Friday for all you genes out there and sperm vine, the sperm vine show with Yoshi will be out.

Speaker 9:          01:34:40       Oh boy. Is she all right. Fill her up. Jane, what do you got? We know it's been so long since we've done this show and I thought, you know, we've never really done a super mega celebrity edition. I thought why not do the most famous people in the world? Okay. The Kardashians. Wow. Why not? We know and there's a whole new school now, so let's get into it. Fill her up. Seal her shot. Let's start with the, with the ladies. Okay. Is it Kimar Kylie. Wow. Cause those are kind of like the two. They're all famous. But those are the two probably most famous. Those are the two, the two hotties, right? Well Courtney and uh, they're less or lesser card and they're not as hot as Kim and Kylie. Those are the secondary third dairy. Technically she's a gender. Well Kylie Jenner. That's what I'm saying.

Speaker 9:          01:35:31       It's all the same clan. You're right. But, so Kim is like the two point, the 2.0 model and then Kylie's the 2.4 whatever. You know what I'm saying? Is it 2009 or 2017 I mean, I'll tell you, I got a problem right away with like, she looks like I liked snakes, but she looks like a, like a little doll or something, you know? What do you mean she looks too juvenile? Oh, she's too young. She's too young. It's not that like, you know, I mean this looks like a little kid. Yeah, she's still pubescent is what you're saying? Is She, I don't know how old she is, so I, I'm assuming she's over 18 for the purposes of this report. I hope so. She's 18 so she's a teenager. Yeah. All right. I don't know. Never mind. I'll go back on that then. So I feel better now.

Speaker 9:          01:36:25       Yeah. So it's basically, do you feel like teaching someone a few lessons or do you want, I guess, you know, the most famous post posted in the world that has just been beaten up left and right by monstrous black dogs. But she'll be like, so are we going to, are you going to come in me? And I'm like, I'm in there. And she's like, no, seriously. I'm like, Oh really? And we've seen what she's capable of. If you've seen the rage a video, yeah. She's used to like some massive black dogs mind. And let's throw this into the ring before even, so is this one, by the way, she's going to the black guys, but let's keep in mind that Kim's very insecure, right? She's the type that you could really abuse. She's kind of a Karen in this situation and I don't know what Kylie's emotional status, but I know, I'm know for a fact.

Speaker 9:          01:37:17       Not as confident as we think she is. Yeah. She's been a victim of a violent crime pretty recently, a year ago or so, or however. She's traumatized, she's fragile. There's a lot of things you can get away with in a girl like that. That's really good coaching. Yeah. And I think ultimately she knows like, oh don't neglect the balls. You know? Like do you think Kim knows that because she's, she's not gonna be like, Ooh, balls, there's a gross. I'm like, no, no, you got to pay attention here. On the other hand, Kylie's young and dating rappers and those guys are like, bitch, put it all in your mouth. Right, right, right. Those guys are just kind of savages. I'm assuming she doesn't even know that not swallowing is an option, you know, cause she's, is she dating Tyga was that was, I think there's a big scandal right now.

Speaker 9:          01:38:05       Oh, I think he got photographed without, with another girl. Oh, we'll see. I, I don't know Taiga, but I've seen him. Yeah. And I think he's, he looks like a savage sexually. Really? I had assumed it was covered in tattoos. That's what does it for you. And you think that means savage? He's a rapper. Yeah. Tattooed rappers, you know? Yeah. I know. I don't think he's rapping about rainbows and fucking lollipops, but I don't think Kanye is like put my balls in your mouth all the time. Yeah. He seemed, he seemed a little more oddly enough, more normal when it comes, you know what I mean? Like I would believe that. I mean, I don't think he's a stable normal guy, but I don't see him being like, look bitch underneath I'm a foreigner in your mouth. Right. Well, cause he's done that before camp.

Speaker 9:          01:38:49       Right. That's your baby Mama. You got to give her some respect. Right, right. Put some respect on my name, put some respect on it. So there's a lot of variables here dealing with, yeah. I still think you've got to go with Kim. I do old school. Yeah. I mean, you know, it's a better story. Um, you know, I like, I like a good story and uh, I feel like it's legendary in there. Who knows what could happen. Maybe I could find one of those rings she lost in Paris or something, you know? So I would go for that. I think that would be more fun. She's got two babies that came out of there. That's cool. I like bitches with babies. Talent that, yeah, I'm going to go Kylie. Yeah, I think that's better for you. For me personally, I think it's better for you.

Speaker 9:          01:39:34       She's kind of a dope. She's 19. I could really traumatize her and you know, she always wants to talk about it as like selfies and her new cosmetics line. What I feel like we screwed up though. Why? I feel like the other, the next most famous female genders actually Kaitlin, well let's go there. That's the next one. Well that's a lady. Yeah, but they're not the way I frame it. Okay, let's go for the guys. Yeah. Old School. Bruce Jenner. I'm talking in his prime cause I didn't think you'd want to woman. Like did you really want to fuck her downstairs? Thing is she still has a doll. I think she still has a dog. So yeah, that kind of rules it out for you. I know it's old school, Bruce Jenner and his prime. I'm talking like eighties athletic or Kanye. Oof, man. It was really tough. A lot of variables to deal with here. Uh, versus some guy who's like, I think I'm a woman inside, you know? Yeah. That's the thing. It's just weird shit happening with him. I mean, look at this guy. That's it. Those muscles. Look at that. Use The fucking man. Dm. Brucey yeah. Well that's a really tough one. He's got a good, here's the, because

Speaker 6:          01:40:54       physically I don't really care. I feel like it's the mental instability and I think they're both have a good bit of that instability. But maybe it's just that, like with Bruce, the only thing is like, you know, he wants to do this thing and he's kind of trying to come to terms with it. But you would know that at the time, right? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:41:14       You wouldn't know that. He might not know it, but it's going to manifest in other ways. You might be like, can I just, do you mind if I wear a wig and a panty hose and you're like, okay, yeah, whatever. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:41:25       but like with, with Kanye, you're just dealing with this in bill, unbelievably out of control. Ego,

Speaker 5:          01:41:32       the porn out. He likes porno law and he's acting out a lot though. And he's like, he's so annoying. You know he's having like near mental breakdowns and stuff. See, because Katelyn's annoying as fuck now. Right? She's annoying. Right. But as Bruce, she probably stayed in line, you know what I mean? Like her ego is under, I don't know what his ego was like when he, this is a good question for you. You should answer this first. Yeah. So sexually, you know that like he can do it. I mean he fathered a bunch of kids and you know, and I'm looking for that fertility game, but then Connie is not going to treat you, treat you like baby Mama. He's going to treat you like, like a little piece of trash on the ground. Yeah. I don't like that. I don't like Connie's, I'm, I'm just putting this on him. He might be brutal. He might be disrespectful. Yeah, that'd be fun for you, Bruce. I feel like he'd have the unconscious,

Speaker 6:          01:42:22       the lady as he is coming right now. Uh, and he's smiling like that. Hmm. You know,

Speaker 5:          01:42:31       come face. Oh, there we are in Amy. Yeah. Look how cute he was. See, there he goes. Uh, yeah. That's more of a calm face. Look at them. Short shorts. No, I like him. You know, athletes, you can't go wrong physically. He probably looks great. Naked. A, he's got this, the anima. Yeah. Stand them up now. Lazy Lover. He's going to have a lot of weird stuff going on and it's more interesting. I think ultimately Kanye would be very toxic to be around. It's so annoying. Such a fan of him as a producer. Right. But I think that would be the thing. I'd be like, I'll just deal with it and then it would give me, you know, first listens to these things would not, you're just a Pete, you're just a slam piece baby. You're talking relationship. I'm talking about filling up grilled cheese. He's like, yeah, come check this out. And then I'd play a song from maybe that I'll ask such a good song is a baby. He's filling you up and sealing Yusha. He's not letting you listen to his music's like his raps

Speaker 6:          01:43:29       coming over. Oh, uh, uh, Ross is here and 21 stab at what's the other fellows? And he'd be like, go make them a sandwich to donate a little bitch. I'll be like, all right, I'll make you sandwiches.

Speaker 5:          01:43:41       Well I guess we agree to disagree. Yeah, I think we chose, we chose who was right for each of us on that one. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Um, look, we got to wrap this up, gene. Okay, hold on. Can I do another one? Another one. Kaitlin or the mom. What's her name? Chris. Right. Chris Jenner. Christ Christian or Caitlin or about the same age. Let's walk through it. Wow. CAITLIN's in new lady. She's probably going to want to definitely Chris. Chris, man. Well, okay, let's say Katelyn has a vision and new, freshly made vision. Yeah, I dunno. I don't have any problem with it, but I just feel like, yeah, you do. You'd have to have a problem. You wouldn't have a problem with it. No sound don't a problem with doctor made machine probably feels funny, you know? It feels weird, right? I guess. I don't know.

Speaker 5:          01:44:40       I mean I've only had real Virgenes but what if, I don't know. I don't know if this is Dick turned inside out though. That's what I'm saying. And so as a straight guy, wouldn't you still, you'd be like, oh, this is like a dick. Like it's still a deck, right? It's still a dick. Yeah. I'd be like, you have your dead Dick, but where are your dad's balls? You'd still have that in your head that you were still having sex with another dude's Dell. Yeah, of course he would. It'd be tough to get through it out. It's still a dick. Yeah, I think Chris would be, um, I don't know. Something about her that would be fun. She seems like a fun, Fun Lady. She's a fun time. Savvy, smart business oriented. I mean, look, she built this family, she did career. It's pretty miraculous.

Speaker 5:          01:45:24       High maintenance as shit, but I mean, I don't know. Now let's go through this because she's just been dumped by a husband of how many years converting to being a woman. She's damaged goods too. Yeah, she's had her spirit broken. You're like just putting your mouth. Yeah. Yeah. I think I would definitely rather fill that up though. Yeah, the, yeah, the mom Kaitlin's going to be annoying. Oh my God. Hi. Maintenance. She's more high main is to me, I think then the other lady, and we don't even know actually that Caitlin likes men. I don't know is a big thing about that. Oh, is that right? Yeah. It was like, no, I like, I mean at the time it was like that he that she likes women that just transitioning. Oh, feels like a whim. A woman but likes women. Oh, I didn't know that. So she's, well, I mean this was what I first heard long ago, so lots of process call me Caitlyn. It's so complicated. I can only imagine how horrible it must be to go through. It's a lot. God, poor woman. All right. All right. Well, there you go. There you go. Uh, please go to a lot of hard hitting quite, I mean, this one really broke me down. It's picking your nose. Make your nostrils big on retarded people drive. Would you rather fuck Caitlyn or Kris Jenner? These are the questions that we answer on your

Speaker 6:          01:46:50       mom's house. On the podcast. They'll try 99 a please shop through the Amazon banner. He'll Trump 90. Sorry. No, Trump gave him a bad shout out. Yeah, you did. And uh, Trump stupid. Oh, this is huge. I can't believe I forgot this all the way until the end. Oh, today. Uh, this week, the 28th, the 28th of this month, mostly stories. My album based on the last Netflix special comes out, the audio release comes out. Here's the thing, it has two bonus tracks, two pieces of audio, two tracks that I just recorded, um, last month that I told them.
