Speaker 2:          00:10:21       Ching Chong, Ching Chong. Yeah. That's a nice way to do it. Yeah. So she's saying, look, well I'm sorry. Camera's facing her. And she's like, don't get me fucked up. You know? And she goes, so I might look a little more, and she pulls Asian eyes already more. And she was, she goes, she goes like this with her own eyes and she goes, I might look a little Jane, but I will fuck. Don't get it twisted out. Fuck Yo at, I'm a hooded shit. That's what she says. I always forget the point of these videos. You get lost in them. Yeah. So wait, which her eyes are already what? And then she pulls this, she pulls her already Asian eyes. So she's Asian and she, she does this with her eyes and she says, I might look a little like that. I smell a new bit for you. Yeah. You got a new hour to build. Yeah, I do. What do you think I should say with that?

Speaker 2:          00:11:27       She doesn't say Ping Pong. You added. You're tagging for me. It, yeah. This girl has a lot of really good Asian clips. Actually. They're not even Asian. She's aging and she, uh, she makes a lot of videos where she actually, she seems like she is hood is shit. I don't know where she's from, but she acts like she's down. Usually the people making these videos are, what do you mean all videos? Not that bright. Now the ones that are like, I'm fucking this and that. You all know me, I'm going to do that. And you're like, all right. I actually think she, this girl is pretty self aware. Like, Hey Hitler. Like, yeah, she's like a hey Hitler vibe to her. She, she actually, you know, we gotta talk about that in a moment. Oh, most definitely. It's, yeah, it's way different than it grown. It's grown, it's grown. It's grown quite a bit. Um, where did this go? Oh No, no. Hood is, fuck, I'm fucking kill you. Like what's the point of these? What is the point? I'll kill a bitch. I cannot believe we didn't investigate that more Hitler. Yeah, but let me finish with this girl first. So my new favorite drop is this. Did I do it again? Oh, someone's been boning up on her accidents this week. Practicing a lot. Sounds like you're mocking or no, I'm doing it exactly like she's doing it does it sounds like you're kind of, no. No. Okay. So here's what I hear. Another clip of hers. Yeah. What does this genius have to offer and why are you insulting her like that? Sorry. You're right.

Speaker 5:          00:13:20       Oh, Anna bad. My Day because I make crazy as videos, but Chad bitch style, he is talking for free and go home and kiss your kids before you even brush your teeth. I say shit.

Speaker 2:          00:13:35       She does have a good point. That's a good point. I know. Fuck no, I stand corrected. Yeah. Now you feel stupid. So stupid. Foolish. So a bitches suck. She's saying you're, you're a horse sideboards. I'm making fun of her for making crazy videos. Like you're a bad mother. You're saying I was wild. But you hose are out there sucking dicks for free and you're fucking going home and kissing your kids. Brush you teeth. Wow. Snaps, snap, snap, uhmm pal. Feel that burn I think was interesting about these videos is like, who's who's antagonizing you? Like who's threatening you? I think people make these videos where they talk a lot of shit when they feel powerless in their lives. So it's, um, it's a form, it's an expression of rage in a way. It's like, it's like somebody hitting a heavy bag and beating the shit out of it.

Speaker 2:          00:14:33       That's a way of physically do it. So if you don't, if not doing it physically, you were doing it verbally. You're doing it to a camera to express maybe your rage and your lack of power. I'm sure no one gives a fuck about her. That's what my thinking is. What is your problem with it? I'm just saying, I think most people, people who are not thinking about you, you know what I'm saying? Right. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? I'm talking about people who make videos that go, if anyone wants to fuck with me, I'll fuck right. That's right. Yes. I don't mean to not like her. I like her. Yes. It just, I'm trying to understand where she's coming from. Yeah. Yeah. That's an awesome sound to make for the podcast. It's also a video now. I know, but I mean it's really cool for the audio quality to SIF to beverages, like the guy from TMZ.

Speaker 2:          00:15:20       Are you going to slurp like that? Yeah. Why do what I want when I want. I'll do the fuck I want and nobody can tell me what my mind. Okay, great. So is that good? Yeah, it was good. You do it now. Ching Chong Ching Cha Ching Chong do it like she does it. She does it. She does it. All right. Um, you want to feel me? You know me? No, I'm talking about, yeah. So you know what I'm saying? I'm talking about feeling what I'm saying. Long Time Mountain filling. I me who's that? That's half ounce. Oh, okay. But that's in a proper interview. Yeah. I'm saying, yeah, I'm, yeah, I'm, yeah, I'm, yeah, that's what he sounds like me. I'm yum. Yum, yum, yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:16:22       there's a lot to get into. Yeah. The video by the way, if put up the video of it and, uh, we had a profile shot going. We're trying this now just to, um, really to get a feedback from the viewers. So this is going to be a different angle. You can tell us in the comments what you think. Tell us if you like this. Do you like the other video angle more? Yeah. How do you want to watch that? Yeah. How do you want to watch the show? Let's screen. Uh, so leave that up to the microphone. It's different. It's different. I see your book and I imagine it, I finally took a shit today, babe. I didn't shit yesterday, but I showed this morning and shit all night yesterday. That's not good. Yeah, it was okay though. I just, I came out normal.

Speaker 4:          00:17:06       Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:17:08       That's not normal at all. What happened yesterday? Yeah. I just forgot to take a dumb, I don't know how that, how do you forget it's taking care of the kid, you know, we, you and I were taking care of him all day and my dad came over and then I just, the day rolled and I forgot. I just didn't have the urge to shit. I don't know. Yeah. But it's okay. I made up for it. You can stop worrying. I'm totally worried. Is Everything all right now? Everything's fine. Is Everything going to, it's okay. You can stop worrying. Are you going to make it? Yeah. How was it? It was normal. It was just normal. Like, I dunno, it was a clean break. There was nothing on the paper. Um, you know, when I feel like when our son shits, like he's had some fucking disasters in his diapers lately.

Speaker 2:          00:17:54       Like I feel like guilty just wiping it up and moving on with the diaper. I feel like we should, we should shut the shower, our son, you know what I mean? Shit. And then bay them. Yeah. Like he might get a bag the time, I know seven times a day. No, but there should be like a baby blue day that I can wash his asshole with. Can we pay them? We do enough. Yeah. Yeah. I'd like more like my instincts are to bathe him immediately after. Yeah. I mean if I shit the way he should and all over my balls and my butt cheeks, I might be like, you know, I'm gonna jump in the shower after this. Right? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. But we just use wipes and we know. Yeah. Let me wipe that shit up. He's got no hair. No. So you really are getting it off of his skin. Pretty Clean Shaven. What are you shaving her baby's hair off. I shave his legs and stuff. Yeah. I should have his legs in his chest. That's awesome. Peach fuzz on his arm. So I trim that. You cut it off. Good. I use clippers. Oh, you don't ever want to ask you when you breastfeed him, do you feel like going?

What do you feel like when, uh, when you, when your dad was spitting game yesterday? It's so funny now that I'm a mom. Like now that I'm a parent, it kind of doesn't affect me as much. It's like this weird thing happens where you forgive your parents for their personalities are like, now you're just crazy. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. You think you've tried but he's got a great personality. No, he's awesome. But you know what I mean? My Dad's not like, um, like the all American Dad, you know, he's, he's got his own stuff happening. Very unconventional, I'd say. Yeah. But Fun. Right? It's totally fun. He's like Party Dad. He is party dad. He's probably dead.

Speaker 2:          00:21:41       I mean, that's what I feel like. Your dad sounds so weird. Did he talk like that? Yeah. Well he was spitting game yesterday. Yeah. Like plans, rolled takeovers kind of shit. I know he lives in a really good mood though. He loves being a Grandad. I think this is really changed him. Uh, he's really happy. He keeps talking about how good looking the is. You said it like 10 times when you left. Yeah. Doula. He was like, this is a good looking kid. That's why he's always like, some baby is so ugly. This baby is not ugly. He's a really good looking kid. Was, he's a big boy. Big. Then I go, yeah, thank God. You know, it's like he's, you know, it makes you feel more comfortable that he's getting sturdier and he's like, but also as a man, you want your book to be big.

Speaker 2:          00:22:22       And I go, yeah. He goes, yeah. I go, you know, I think we're going to put Alison to sporks when he's, when he's a boy and he goes as good idea. Maybe tennis. Tennis is good money. And Dennis, I go, what about soccer? Soccer's for poor people. I go down, we're not going to send them to Brazil in a favela to play. He's going to play, you know, in La. Yeah. Other kids? No, no, no suckers for poor people that is as good. There's money in 10. Yes. How about Marshall? And he's getting sponsored right away. Yeah. Like what? He's hungry. He's not going to make a living. Yeah, I go. What about martial arts now? No money. A martial arts. What is the money part? I guess just like people with money. Oh, I got it. Yeah. Yeah. Well then golf too, I guess.

Speaker 2:          00:23:06       Right? Which should sign him up for golf. So boring. Oh my God. What if that's his favorite sport? I thought about that. I mean, you never know. I remember when we were, um, probably like over 10 years ago, my buddy read was about to have his first kid and they knew it was a boy. He was Luby's excited, you know, go to baseball games and play baseball. And I think one of, one of the other guys, Casey or somebody goes, uh, what if he doesn't like baseball? And you'd like, you can see it hit him in the head. Like, I'm thinking about that. I was like, well what if he lives or what have you liked soccer? He goes, well, I'm not going to go to the games, but I still love him. Please not going to support

Speaker 8:          00:23:46       his kid. Hey, I got a soccer game today. I'll see you later. It's terrible. Yeah, he was. He was sold on that. Like I'm not going, I'm as too boring. What if our son is into something retarded that we don't like? Like what's the most boring thing to watch swimming, but that's fucking boring. No swimming I could watch cause it was a race. So race, race is always exciting. Uh, if he sucks at swimming, that would say, yeah, like if he was like always laughs, like swim. Yeah. But no, I don't, I think is when it's your kid, you don't really care. I mean I would, I would go watch them do anything. Don't care. I'd watch him take a shit. Yeah, we do watch and take shits. That's true all the time. All the time. We hold a mess. He's shitting. That's my shit's in our hand. I like, I kinda like it though. It's like he's doing something, you can't do anything wrong, kid, whatever you want to do. We support that.

Speaker 8:          00:24:39       Did Not say that I actually meant to hit this. I'm like, oh, but that button's right next to the others. Yeah, it is. I'm putting a little marker on it and then her priorities. There you go. There you go. There you go. Okay. All right. Um, okay. Thompson Cora. Oh, I got to tell people this real quick. Um, God blesses you, but also to anybody that bought the, what blesses you? Anybody that got the cane shirt. Um, I've gotten a number of messages. We would try and respond to everybody. It was a presale and the Presale, you know, you sell it up to a point and then they ship. So there's been a delay. And for people that didn't know, I apologize. And here's what we're doing to anybody that ordered a cane shirt, you're all getting an extra free item from our store. Um, and that's how you, what it is.

Speaker 8:          00:25:35       It's just going to come in there. Uh, but everybody, everybody that ordered ones would get a free extra item to make up for the fact that a lot of people didn't know it was a Presale, even though it says it on the order form. Um, additionally, next week we should have a new shirt and it will not be a presale. It'll be an, uh, shipping, uh, ship immediately order. Um, so hopefully we'll be ready to announce it next week. I'm not even announcing it until those are in stock. It won't be a Presale, but I'm just letting you know now if you got it, you're getting an extra free item to make up for any delay. We just wanted to point that out, okay. Okay. Okay. What's the free item? Is it, did you shave something, your pubic hair off his pubic hair? I was doing, I didn't want to tell anybody but his pubic hair. Yes. Do you think someone would pay a premium for Tom Cigarettes? Pubic hair? I would guess no.

Speaker 5:          00:29:23       Hi, I'm Kim Man. I am a model. Yeah. For more 60 plus melts now 63 years of age. Yeah. This is my second time around here. And surprisingly, I have an experience with two young gentlemen who have a really, really huge penis.

Speaker 8:          00:29:51       Oh God. I liked her. They to these tenets mutually satisfying that she said that like, I couldn't believe it. They truly satisfied. I'm sorry

Speaker 5:          00:30:03       with two gentlemen especially. What is amazing is, is that I was able to take really, really hard long penis into my vagina as well as, and there is solid.

Speaker 8:          00:30:28       Yeah. Her cadence is amazing. Yes. I love when people who don't speak English natively talk cause they do it so differently. So I'll sort of like the little stuff, like making something plural when it's not so funny. Jan Demands, they're not gentlemen sweety. Those are gentlemen you need to make. You need a mason gentleman's. Yeah, yeah. Real skew notion of gentleman's. Um, well back to Hitler when, Hey Hitler first came on the scene. Yeah. It's like we just get, sometimes it's just like a drop. We don't really look into it. We're just like, this is pretty funny. God. So we played that and then people were saying, I think you guys are not hearing this correctly. She's saying, hey Heather, hey hiller her Hemler or Hitler, Hitler, Hillary's right hand man. Let's not forget handler. He doesn't get as much attention. So then, um, we go, okay, that's, it's, it's, it's debatable. Right? So then last week, um, another audio clip came to our attention, right? A blue band pulls it, sends it.

Speaker 8:          00:31:56       So people are saying, that's Nicholas. Other people like myself think it's lit. Right. Um, and people were like, no, no, no. It's, it's know there's a debate. Well, what didn't occur to us until a few days ago was, well, let's look into these videos a little more. The videos on her page. This is a girl named Danny. Um, she has countless videos. I really don't know how many, I don't know if there's a way to tell when you get to there. Maybe there is. Um, let's see. How many videos did she have? Can you tell when you just hit this? I Dunno. Danny Blue Band. Blue Band.

Speaker 10:         00:32:43       I can't really, I can't tell grid. Does the grid tell you?

Speaker 2:          00:32:51       But it doesn't tell you how many though. Right? People, that's how many subscribers she has there anyways, it is a lot. It's a lot of videos were paging through it. I go out and just put up a ton of stuff. What's one of the first videos I see asking for Hitler's help? H I. T. L. E. R. Crazy Hitler asking for his help.

Speaker 11:         00:33:16       Hitler. It's me being me. I just,

Speaker 10:         00:33:26       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:33:28       Danielle. Okay, so we know that the hills a problem we talked about before it. Yeah. A few videos later. The video is titled Asking for Hitler's help. Number two. Sure. So it's a second time. It's so weird.

Speaker 11:         00:33:44       Hey, Hiller is Nini? Yup. I have a really big problem right now and it has to deal with Malen Allen, new person. Oh Geez, lily. Hey is stuck and smelling Allen belly button and I'm a get him out, but I can't, so could you help me get him out? So

Speaker 2:          00:34:16       that was a fear of going to help with this. Hey, I don't have, okay, I'm having a really hard time getting him out and I got my belly button. Here's the thing too, is that there's only one Hitler, like after roller to most people stop naming their children, adults or Hillary as a surname. So this is the fewer she is, she, there's no other Hitler that, who else could help like that? I mean, obviously, I mean obviously I'm saying what else could help? Like even in the afterlife, he must have some power. They're probably evil powers and maybe that's why she's, she's uh, you know, back in the dark in the lower, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think she's, she's saying a Baltimore, you know, right. Yeah. Wow. Maybe. Yeah. She's interesting by the way. So her name is Danny. Yeah. And she refers to people that watch these videos and likewise. Dany JAKKS no, that's great branding. It is great branding. You know, she's on top of a branding game. This is called cause a video here called warning about a lesbian video. I don't know what this is about. Um, all right. I only put ads. Ruins isn't Louis Tomlinson. That's the guy from one direction. Is that right? I don't know. I'm not a fan because she has a lot of um hmm. Let's see.

Speaker 8:          00:35:38       Isn't English pop? So yeah, I remember of the, of the group one direction. Um, she has a lot of videos to him. Um, let me see. So to Hitler and then this guy from one direction, those are her two of blogging. She has some to Harry styles who I believe's another one direction guy. That's a really crazy Hitler. Um, yeah. Then she says, this is a video called telling Louis Tomlinson, I'm pregnant again. MMM. MMM. MMM. Okay. Okay. So you go through these and then it says singing happy birthday to an end. The title of the video. Big words. Yeah. Lips and it's on youtube titles on Youtube titled that way the word is totally spelled out, not like astericks or so. Yeah. Wow. So now there's, there's no debate. Um, it's not a very nice title, I think even for your dany acts. But here's the thing, much like, you know, she's just reading off with the person's name is, is that her fault that she's, she's just repeating what's given her big words. Yeah, I dunno man. I don't know. There's, there's so many videos, there's so many videos. Um, there's even one where she says something to Sophia Smith and she's like, Sophia Smith is bad. And then, and then the next week is called eating Sophia Smith Pussy. Really? Yeah. And she just looks the air. What the fuck this chick is whacked. Um, while she's off her meds. Big Time. Yeah. I don't know what's going on.

Speaker 8:          00:37:23       Hey Dany yaks

Speaker 12:         00:37:27       talk about a personal moments on 'em because it's really personal. But yeah, I just have to say to those like wanting to do, um, okay. I basically don't why being on? Because it's really uncomfortable for me on top. How to do annual SEC's annual. Yeah. Um, uh, why being on top? It's really uncomfortable for me. Plus I don't know how it is. Do Annual Sec's annual site? Maybe Hilary. I love being on the bottom just because oral sex there's a lot more comfortable cause oral sex. Sex is good for other people that I just like oral sex better.

Speaker 8:          00:38:38       What up? No, you're leaving that out all together.

Speaker 12:         00:38:41       I really don't usually talk about this stuff on you to just be cause there are like kids on youtube. Um, then

Speaker 8:          00:38:54       tell him all about annual section. Then the Hitler stuff is normal for you. Annual sex is um hmm. Interesting choices we're making. Yeah. I wonder if Heather can help you with the annual sex and the click. Yeah. Finding the click. Touch my click just lik that motherfucker right there. That's wrong with people. There's a video here called asking Simon Cowell to do me a favor. See, I don't know if this is reaching the people you're meeting this school.

Speaker 2:          00:39:21       I don't think it is. I think, no, I think nobody that you're targeting. Is that right?

Speaker 11:         00:39:27       Hey Simon, I know you're actually a one directions manager, but could you like do me favor like really quick? Um, yeah, you got it. I'm going to mail a gift to, to lily for Valentine's Day and if I do send a gift,

Speaker 8:          00:39:55       I dunno. I mean for her to think that Simon cow was going to get that, it's almost, it's almost less likely that Simon cow. We'll help you then Hitler will.

Speaker 2:          00:40:06       Yeah, I kind of agree. I don't understand why you think Simon's a harder target. No one's looking for Hiller. Yeah, everyone's out for Simon, so yeah, he really got an aim

Speaker 8:          00:40:16       a little lower. Yeah. I don't mean, I think you should start with maybe like a, like a mayor. The local dude. Yeah. Maybe somebody on the city council and then be like, Hey, will you help me get this guy out of a belly button that he's stuck in? Because Hitler and Simon callow are very busy guys. Hello? First of all, he's dead. Yeah. Um, he has a lot of evil things to do. We can't, but you can't bother and burden him with one direction questions.

Speaker 2:          00:40:49       But I, but oddly enough, I, I could see Hitler being like, I enjoy one direct, like I could see him liking the band on accent is very entertaining. It's five white guys. I don't even know if I realize this is nice,

Speaker 8:          00:41:07       but I don't really see what's there. What do you know their songs? No, I don't know their songs, but they're, I know they're immensely, oh, we can't play that on this show anyways. Uh, yeah, I'd say we should listen to them. Oh yeah. And there's one here. It's a nine second video. It says turning Justin Bieber back into a male. Hmm. I Dunno.

Speaker 11:         00:41:28       Back in to a male.

Speaker 8:          00:41:33       Is this for Hitler?

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       Hitler. Hitler request. It says it's a spell. Oh, she's doing what she does. She does spouse. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. It's a lot happening. You think if you had a kid that was like this, you may want to pay attention to the youtube videos. I'm interested about this right here because she has a video here. I'll talks about the ying Yang twins. Oh, I like those guys.

Speaker 12:         00:42:07       Yeah. Like, uh, trying to get you off and they're actually doing the dirty work. So Amalia, who's dirty work doing the dirty work? Mama Mia, like, yeah. Yeah. Like suggests she is, her world is Yang Yang twins, one direction. Hitler, you know, housing, right. Houses.

Speaker 2:          00:42:42       So this is, this is feeling very Shane leash. That was going to say that. And you know what's interesting, the common thread with all of these cooky shoes, you tubers. Yeah. Poor audio quality. You may never know how to produce a decent video. Shane Lea, same problem with the beeps and the yeah. And the um, and then the rappers, the fake rappers, the music beds always too high on their stuff. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. That's a sure sign of mental illness. Kind of do this for you real quick.

Speaker 13:         00:43:14       Sorry. Mid Show break now because I need to be in there. The Ah,

Speaker 8:          00:43:36       the little overkill. Little over done. Okay. So we solved the Hitler Nicholas Debate. Um, you know, a lot of times advertisers have asked, they go, how do you feel about, um, a pre produced, uh, advertisement? In other words, we just give you a file and you play it. And my feeling has always been no, I think, I think speaking directly to the audience with products that we actually, you know, use and endorse always works better. There's more of a connection. But there's this one ad that came in where it was pitched to us and I said, you know what? I think it'll still work for our audience even though it's not us reading the copy it's made and then we play it. Okay. And so this is the first time I'm playing it here on show.

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       Um, and you know, obviously if you guys don't like it, you know, I'll tell them and we'll read the copy, but I just thought, let's give it a whirl. So here's a, our mid show, um, ad

Speaker 4:          00:44:44       love, delicious homemade desserts, but recipes can be complicated and takes so long to make measuring for delicious desserts guarantee delicious scrumptious kids will devour this. Similar A, here's the cake mix, chips, marshmallows, chocolate cookies. Now here's one of my favorites, just syrup, sugar, cinnamon, and then just layer in some biscuits for fresh and warm. Sticky buns.

Speaker 2:          00:45:41       There you go. I love this. Do you know that I there, the books are everywhere now. Kicked there like at the pharmacy and stuff. Yeah, I love it. Well I think we got the verdict. This is an ad we can play on the show. I think you'll like it. I like it. I mean hopefully the audience likes it. I feel good about it. What a great product. Clever marketing. Yeah. Clever branding. Clever, clever, clever. Pan On and where you're going next. But do you want to play the thing that I brought in? Okay. So do you want to set this up? Cause I don't really know. Like tell them what you did. Well, so on that steep bro, I had a licensed psychotherapist on mark. Uh, mark Barone was on and he's from Seattle and we talked about Carl Young and synchronicity and I thought since I have a therapist on the line, why not have him assess your artwork and given an analysis on what he thinks is going on there.

Speaker 2:          00:46:41       Legitimately. I've never heard you just said play this. And I said, what am I playing? Go. Oh, just just play it. Just play it. So you had him look at it. So this is a Skype session with a psychotherapist and we finished that steep bro and I go, Hey, one more thing. Can you look at my husband's artwork and just tell me what you see in the art if it's normal. And did he pull up my Instagram? I emailed him a screen grab of the painting that you did call her home at last home. At last. I didn't know the name of the painting. So when you say the painting, I have to figure out which one. Okay. So this is what you did in Denver. This is, this is on Instagram. So the listeners can go to your Instagram cigarette Tom, and look at this quote, painting art work. And

Speaker 14:         00:47:30       let's just see what a licensed psychotherapist says about what you through. What does it signify here? So with me is Mark Brown and he is a licensed a psycho therapist, Highmark by Christina. Thank you for joining me. I really appreciate this. Thanks for having me on. Yeah. So, um, I've just emailed you my husband's, um, art work that he did. He stayed in a condo in Denver and the, all the comedians leave behind a piece of art for the home, the house that they stay in. And first of all, what are your credentials, um, in, in psychotherapy? If you could just let us know your background,

Speaker 15:         00:48:10       what's called a and m a, which means I have a masters, master of arts in sciences.

Speaker 14:         00:48:14       So, but basically you are a, you're a professional mental health person. Yeah. Seven years for awhile. Okay. So I've sent you the artwork that we've been discussing. If you could take a look at it and just tell me, uh, what do you see here? What, what would the mental health of a person making this type of art or what, what does it look like? And please be honest.

Speaker 15:         00:48:37       Well, uh, so there's, there's a what, uh, what I've never seen right away is there's a lot of phallic energy here. Interesting. There's a, first of all, there's, this gun is pointed and I don't know if that is, this is a self portrait or not.

Speaker 14:         00:49:01       I think he might be. Yeah.

Speaker 15:         00:49:03       Um, so there's this gun with it with, uh, with, uh, and it's purple, purple gun with a red kind of, some fire are kind of shooting out of the front of it. And then it's got this, it looks like a male figure space. So the gun is pointed towards his face. And the other Phallic element is that he's got a really long tongue that's hanging out of his mouth. So it indicates that there's some, you know, maybe fear of this, of this entered maybe this new students, this, sorry. There's the way that he is looking at it, the eye is, his eyes are really like bulging out. So it's like there's this like fear, like obsession, you know, uh, uh, Dick Obsession. Yeah. This energy sounds about right. And then what's, what's interesting is that above his head and above the gun, there's this, there's this kind of half, half circle above him, which, which uh, which looks a feminine, I would say

Speaker 14:         00:50:17       it's a dark son. I told him, but just listen

Speaker 15:         00:50:22       and it's, and it's black. It's, it's pitch black. Yeah. And so that's kind of like hovering above. And so there's like this, um, this female energy, which is like, uh, you know, dark and mysterious and powerful.

Speaker 2:          00:50:40       Wow.

Speaker 15:         00:50:42       Is it both is above him and then, and then he's, uh,

Speaker 13:         00:50:46       yeah,

Speaker 15:         00:50:47       he's kind of, you know, like,

Speaker 13:         00:50:49       okay,

Speaker 15:         00:50:50       bound by this, you know, this, this, uh, his own energy, you know, and then there are these,

Speaker 13:         00:50:58       okay.

Speaker 15:         00:50:59       His little fingers down at the bottom.

Speaker 13:         00:51:01       Okay.

Speaker 15:         00:51:02       It's, they kind of look like, like claims as well.

Speaker 2:          00:51:05       They're bushes. The bushes, you know, the, the, the birthday, I'm sorry, when did your husband's birthday? April 16th. Four days from the fears seen Aries? Yes. Ah,

Speaker 15:         00:51:19       yeah. So fire, he's a fiery guy.

Speaker 2:          00:51:21       Very, so the, actually that, can I tell you what I actually painted was my second

Speaker 13:         00:51:28       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:51:28       Option. Oh, really? What was the first one? The, first of all, I should tell you this, the way that I drew that painting, it's the way that I draw it. You too, with the bulging eyes and the nose. It's my go to profile, how I know the, um, the first option that I was going to do. And I only had second thoughts. I was like, ah, I don't know if they'll hang it up here. I was just going to draw a big cock with balls and have it just shooting ges out onto the, and isn't that interesting that Mark's assessment is that it's valid because the tongue is kind of a cock kind of sort of how I would've drawn it. Yeah. Yeah. There's a dick shooting his load at your and your mouth. Yeah. Is it a self portrait? No, it's just, that's always how I draw the me part. Is this, um, the ominous? Yeah. I don't, by the way, I don't hear mental illness. Like you like to bring up black, that black thing. He said it's supposed to represent the s it's the sun. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         00:52:27       Yes,

Speaker 15:         00:52:28       we got that to you. But it looks, it's a black side and it's, and it's shaped like a, it's kind of shaped like a breast,

Speaker 2:          00:52:39       right. And oppressive female breasts at energy.

Speaker 15:         00:52:45       So it's like this aggressive energy, kind of like damp and his fire.

Speaker 2:          00:52:50       I wonder who that is.

Speaker 15:         00:52:54       Weird. Huh? So areas is a very vascular and fiery science. So I'm not surprised at all to get a little bit, we were about it.

Speaker 13:         00:53:07       Energy. I feel it. I really feel,

Speaker 15:         00:53:12       I'm really not surprised that, um, that there's this fiery, fiery energy there.

Speaker 2:          00:53:18       Oh Man. Oh, I'm sorry. So that's what you see in those, those bushels, those things with fire.

Speaker 15:         00:53:24       I think there are,

Speaker 14:         00:53:26       there are a little kind of, which is a fire. Yeah. Plain sexual energy. Would you say

Speaker 15:         00:53:32       sexual or creative energy? They can be, they can be kind of one in the same.

Speaker 2:          00:53:37       So you're dampening my creative. Yes. I'm breaking your spirit essentially. Like you have all this phallic energy tonight.

Speaker 15:         00:53:45       I mean, that's what I've been trying to get out with an it. Well, it's actually a little more than that if you want to keep Martin current assessment. Yeah, a little deeper. I would say maybe those are often the I and the energy I would say is usually identified as sexual in our culture. You know, there's this focus on, you know, male energy and you know, we'll just everybody, right. Everything revolves around,

Speaker 2:          00:54:09       you know, the Friday and I think libidinal energy, you're redirecting your creative. And I'm, I'm obviously squashing your, the dark cloud above. Yes. Uh Huh. Okay.

Speaker 15:         00:54:19       How's sex? Right. So that's the narrative. I'm not saying that that's true, but still what he's really looking at is the gun, which really I think over the represents sexuality and then the little bunches of planes underneath it or maybe more just the creative energy is coursing through his veins all the time.

Speaker 14:         00:54:40       Hmm. Interesting. And then the oppressive, sorry, does any of this makes sense? No, I love it. And then the oppressive female figure that's dampening his sexual energy, is that what you're saying?

Speaker 15:         00:54:53       I Dunno. You know, there's some fear. I think there's just maybe a little bit of fear.

Speaker 2:          00:54:59       I love that. I've always been scared of you. I know. That's why I love it that someone else sees it. Yeah. I love it. I love, love having an expert. Isn't it great. You should have mark do more of your artwork. Yeah. And also I'd like to have a gallery person assess it as per value c and I, I wanted to get a real artist to critique it and I actually, I, I tried and I couldn't do it in time by the way that Shauna recognize like real recognize real art talent. Yeah. And then another artist, you used my piece for inspiration. Oh right. That was great. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Okay. So he did really, did you see what he did? I did. It was really spectacular. I reposted it on my Instagram. It is not so much better. It's like a real artist did it, you know, I love it

Speaker 15:         00:55:42       around the power because hey, come on women or power for it.

Speaker 14:         00:55:47       Uh, uh, difficult because the drawing is fraught with horrible things. Terrifying things.

Speaker 15:         00:55:56       I think it's, I think it's, I think it's great. I think he has a healthy, uh, potentially healthy, a youthful energy

Speaker 14:         00:56:06       about him. That's interesting. Cause he is 57 years old it, yeah. No, well energy about him though. Sometimes the incorrect on the, you know, yeah. You old man. He's very spry. Yeah. He's very, very well.

Speaker 15:         00:56:24       So, yeah. Yeah. You know, the ominous kind of breast of could be, oh, you let him continue to thing. I'm 57. Yeah. You're a horrible person. That's good fun. It also just be, you know, that having to be having to be this, this adult, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:56:44       Interesting. Yeah. That makes the, uh, the, the power that tells him no to his penile desires. No.

Speaker 15:         00:56:53       If having to conform to this, uh, to this, uh, idea, uh, the, you know, what an adult male is supposed to be. It

Speaker 2:          00:57:03       interesting. So yeah, that would make sense. He just, this is my husband's our work and he just had a child with me and yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

Speaker 15:         00:57:12       And you know, he's uh, yeah. You know what's hilarious? The tongue that the tongue was hanging out, you know, it was just so, um, whimsical, you know, it's just kind of whimsical 10 code for, to, so it's like, yeah, there's this ominous like have to be a parent, but also, you know, being a useful kind of plants.

Speaker 2:          00:57:39       This guy reminds me of my cousin Bri. Bri. Yeah. The way he sounds, he's sweet. He's very sensitive. Should I keep going? There's no other, I mean that's the assessment of your art work. I, there's, there's more detailed if you want to listen to it later. I also asked him if you were normal because you watch so much murder. All the murder shows. Yeah. Do you want to know the answer? Sure. He said that actually, yes, because you're in touch with your dark side and that it's a really healthy expression of being in touch with one's dark side. So there you go. You're, I asked him to rate you on a scale of one to 10 your mental health. And he said, I, you know, and in all fairness, he's like, I can't really do that cause I kind of, I'm familiar with both of you from the show, the podcast, and I can't do that, but I'd give him like an eight, eight meaning on a scale of one to 10 your mental health.

Speaker 2:          00:58:26       Oh, he listens to this show? Yes. Oh, and he's familiar, you know, it's kind of biased. Sounds like he's really cool guy. He's sweet. Yeah. You told him I'm 57 I did. Yeah. Well I was, I thought he asked me how old does he look? In all fairness, I forgot. Okay. So just so he knows now since he listens to this show, I am 36 and someone is having a big birthday this year. Let's talk about, let's talk about that birthday that's coming up for you this year. I won't be able to see this birthday for a long.

Speaker 16:         00:59:01       Really interesting.

Speaker 2:          00:59:08       What birthday do you have this year? 30. And then plus, how many are you excited for it? No Big One. Can I tell you it was,

Speaker 16:         00:59:21       what's

Speaker 2:          00:59:21       devastating

Speaker 17:         00:59:22       is that Allie really have 10 decent years left and then it's like the decline towards death, you know, absolute 50 is, and then you're just on a downward. Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's true. But you can have a really good run for 10 years. No, I think for about 20 plus your second if you're in decent health. Right. 50 to 70 is a really good run, I think. Okay. Yeah. But then when are you going to rehab? When are you gonna get your second wife? I don't think that's going to happen until after 50 you think I have 10 years left on this marriage and then, yeah. And you're gonna get your 20 year old? No, I would say 15 years. Oh, you and I have left. I think so. And then you're going to trade me out. Yeah. Okay. That's not bad. That's not bad.

Speaker 17:         01:00:06       Good run. Real good. Run 40 can you believe it? I never thought I'd see 40 I thought I'd be dead by now. You know when you're 15 years old and you're like already man. Wow. What do you think you're going to be with? I'll probably be like, oh my second marriage. Yeah. Well I don't think you'll get married again. I think you're just going to have, yeah, countless lovers. Parallelize the few air lava pool boys and stuff. Yeah, I'll bang like hot young things. I won't, I wouldn't, I can't marry after you. I love you too much. I would really be devastated if we divorced for like a whole day or two and then I'd have to find someone else to grow. How sad would you be if we split? It didn't really think about it. What would you do? Seriously? What'd you even marry again?

Speaker 17:         01:00:54       I don't see myself marrying again. Too much. It's too horrible, right? Yeah. What would I want to marry again? I don't want to marry. No, seriously. No, it's too much. It's like it's your whole life with this person. What I would do is project life. You know, I'd probably go through like my intense, um, you know, intense like slut phase, right? It's normal, right? So you go like, you know, you bag like a hundred slots and then you go, I got to fucking keep it together. And then you find one that you're going to date for a while. Then she's like, oh, I can't wait for my wedding day. And you go, oh, see you later. How'd he goes on to the next one? For sure. Yeah. And then you're like, it wasn't a towel. And this is like, this goes for almost all of the moments in the scene. It wasn't until somebody was actually there telling me you have to in you or you have three in you that like it actually, it kind of clicked. And I'm like, oh my God, this is actually happening and I'm proud of my song.

Speaker 2:          01:01:59       That'll be, that'll be you after the divorce. Yeah, for sure. To Send me three and me. No. You know what? I would jog. Just be alone a lot. Drink a lot and read. Yeah, I do. Just quiet. I don't think I'd want to deal with dude's anymore. You know, you're all, you're all over it and imagine aren't you just fucking over? Probably 55 I get mad. Yeah. Just blow my brains out. No, I moved to Tahiti. That's what I would do. And just live on an island. I wouldn't even fuck with society anymore. If we divorced a 55 I would go to Ellis will be grown. Right. Almost down when he's in college. I'll go live in Tahiti. Yup. And just live on the island fish. Yeah. Dude. Wild out and just get weird. Oh yeah. Homesteading, whatever. A bunch of plastic surgery.

Speaker 2:          01:02:53       Big chompers. Big Old Steve Harvey's in my mouth. Hey, you're 22 I'm 55 Aria. I want your veneers to be extra bag and hang out at clubs in Vegas. You guys want to have some drinks on me and I'd be like that all guys bought and I was all drag Scott. We'll have like a silk shirt with a big like fire pattern on it. That's the sad you just described. The saddest doors. The status guy. It's the guy in the neighborhood that drives the yellow for are you got a houseboat sometime? Houseboat is the saddest divorce guy thing. Aw. That's when you know you blown it. Living on a houseboat. Kids every other weekend. The pretty cool water because I think the fantasy is they're going to live like Miami vice course. Didn't he live on a house but with a crocodile or some bullshit dude. Yeah. I mean I feel like if for some reason talking about it makes me feel like it's real. I feel so sad. Right? Jeans. No, the houseboat. I'm saying fuel is really written like not the divorce part. Yeah. No and that's the divorce part. Well, they'll cause a houseboat feels like a divorce it, eh? Yeah. It's terrible. So I got all this stuff here now. It's so just not, it's amazing how little you need to live. And Wifi is overrated.

Speaker 2:          01:04:30       Oh yeah. Rock sometimes. Cause it was about, no, I don't like a kitchen either. Got this microwave. It works awesome. Everything's microwave and I just need an Arby's. Yeah. And it's so depressing. It's depressing man. Anyway, so did you like your art assessment? That was really great. Thank you. What's his name? Mark. Mark slipped or private to mark. Thank you very much mark. I actually really did enjoy that. And you can hear mark on this week's episode of that steep bro discussing synchronicity. Phenomenal therapy to what's therapy and what's the point? Damn cake. Pineapple upside down.

Speaker 2:          01:05:11       Well you get hair plugs to oh yeah, yeah. But I want it to really thin it. Like really, really go bald first and do like Doo Doo, Doo Doo Doo like stabs in there. It looks like little stocks of salary all over my head. Hey girls, the saddest is when you show old guy. I mean, I haven't been to a club in a long time. I've been in clubs where you see, you know, or at the bar. Yeah. That guy. Of course. What do you ladies drinking? I got it. Let me go around for all of them. Hair dyed, jet black. Nice and easy. Here's a good lesson for people. I'm also single, married, divorced. It's all about sending the quality dick pic.

Speaker 18:         01:05:57       Yeah, my top pick. Okay, well number one irks my nerves. She did my Nigga baby oil was $2. Get yourself together. That's a pretty good list. I didn't know Dex could get ashy. Well, you don't see enough black cocks. Oh, true. If you did, you see something rational? I wish I saw more even brown ones. Yeah, sure. I didn't know. Rule number two, make sure your shit is hard and that was a good point. That's good for every race like this because we're all calm. You say Amy and everybody, grandma, I don't know what he was thinking. Girls are mean and petty and that's the Shit we do now. Anytime we look at your limp dick ass picture, she's going to cry more,

Speaker 2:          01:06:58       right? Yeah, I agree with that. Make sure, you know, I've never been sent a dick pic other than yours because we started dating around the time cell phones started. No, I can sell phones back in 84 people. Four people sending Dick Pics in 2005 yeah, but I probably, it was probably not like today. Today. Yeah. No, it's a thing. It's really much bigger now, but I agree. It's like watch porn. Nothing makes me angry. Or they know a limp. Dick, especially you, you get this hard before the scene. You've expressed this before. So I saw one of those like showtime behind the scenes pornos and that's what the director got basically mad at the guy for. He's like, dude, I want you to pull it out, ready to go. And they gave him time alone. They're like, go get it ready. And the guy couldn't do it, so they killed the scene.

Speaker 2:          01:07:49       Oh Wow. Said no shooting today. It's a lot of pressure though. I think he's a lot of pressure. I'm ready to get in there though. It's again, an important is that you're divorced career. Yeah. That's a good, I think it's a good second career. I think that's just not a good one in the early like in your 20s, but good for your 50s and stuff. Well it's a niche market. They got that old man, young girl. But is it is it's also, um, you know what the hook could be that it's a self funded thing. Other words, not someone's not going to hire me, but maybe I produced them. Myselves get a site, put it out there. Hey, I'm 55. I'm recently divorced. I'm doing these pornos now. What do you think to do that? Great idea. Maybe you could, uh, the good news is your parents will be dead, so no one's, they'll be dead. Our son will be in his sexual prime would be a good example for him. And then, um, it also could also, yeah, what fund? Send more people to my standup shows. It's always about selling more tickets. So you go, hey, you like my porno. Come see me to stand up. That's a really neat angle. Business Savvy.

Speaker 18:         01:08:53       Rule number three, brainiac made sure she wants you a dick pic ain't nothing worse than getting the eye known as dick pig. Like who are you and who sent you with his lip as she did? Save yourself the trouble and get to know it's also how you lying bitch,

Speaker 2:          01:09:08       bitch. Yeah. You should. I think an unsolicited Dick Pics. Not Good. Right? I, like I said, I've never, I'm received and that's not a call. Don't send us your Dick Pics. Yeah, no. Uh, I don't know, I guess. Yeah, right. Do you include the balls in a dick pic to, I don't think it's as important, but they're there. I'd like to know that they're there. You want, well, how would it, how would the person is saying you just like, you mean like from above? Yeah, like I want to see the Dick and the balls because I think balls are neglected and they're often just as important. So send those. Yeah. Let me see if those look high and tight. If they're not, I'm not interested. I don't like droopy goat nuts. I don't like, I'm hanging in sad. I'll ask my dad to send a picture of it. Is His boss really hang? I saw them one time and know is everything all right with what? And I go your ball bag. Yeah. It looks like it's hanging down on your knees. They look like to pig nuts. Seriously looked like cinder blocks that are just in like a skin in a paper bag. That's about to tear open. Yeah. Do they hurt when they get that hanging? I don't think so. They look like they weigh a lot though.

Speaker 18:         01:10:20       A number four, make sure your Dick pic is memorable. Girls Gets Hen Dick pics a day. Make Yours stand out like gift wrapping. Stick it in the ball to her favorite ice cream. Kelly. Oh Shit. Pig. Do something with it. Other than that, hold it like we don't want to see you hope. I'm still

Speaker 2:          01:10:36       surprised that you don't think the unsolicited Dick pic is a great thing to point. Like nobody wants that. Oh, I don't want to see anybody's, which is the point she made and you're like, I don't like unsolicited. It's gotta be the worst. I imagine if you're a guy, don't send a girl, just a dick pic thinking that it's going to be exciting. I think the whole, the whole proposition of sending a dick pic is ludicrous. Most women I do too, but what I'm saying, I want to see a deck. What I'm saying is when you send an unsolicited one's crazy, you're really not just rolling the dice. You're, you know, you're, you're at the risk of truly upsetting someone. Yeah. So legal action, legal, also embarrassment. Why don't you make sure that your dick pic would be one. Okay. Or maybe she sends you a pick first.

Speaker 2:          01:11:21       You know like, oh here's a pair of scissors and my coach, now you send me your Dick pic scissors in my, yeah, the Dick pic is a very male thing I think. Cause they have dicks other guys. No, no, no. I'm saying like you don't, you know, who wants to receive a dick pic? Other dudes like it's not necessary. I don't, at least from the women I know we don't get that aroused by a picture of a cock. Like it's not the same thing. The same as guys also looking at naked women badge is, I assume. Yeah. Like for us it's not, we, I think we like to see a dick attached to a body. At least that's what, as a woman, yeah. Show me the whole thing. Don't just send me your car. Who Cares? Plus the scale. You don't, there's no scale in a, in a picture. So I'll hold something next to your deck would be your, yeah, that's a better poet. Hold a can of soda next to your day. Some reference scale. Yeah. Yeah. Cause I don't know. You can make it look enormous and it's not wire. Yeah. Pick a fucking liar. Make fucking liar. Get a hairspray can, yeah. There you go. Wow. I've sent a few experience. Yeah, I'm on the road a lot. So

Speaker 8:          01:12:22       let's see here. Um, oh, this came in. You know, you know about this guy, right? Martin? Is it strictly shell? Shell clue? What's his name? Martin Shkreli. Uh, this is the guy who, he's the most hated man in America. Um, he became really well known, I don't know, six, nine months ago when he says, uh, when he has the company that he was a CEO of, bought this patent on a pharmaceutical drug that helps like AIDS patients. And it was selling for something like 12, $13 a pill, something like maybe $7 a pill and he raised it to $700 a pill. Oh my God. And then there was just huge backlash. What a pos is kind of a, yeah. Oh, the biggest pos. Then, not too long ago, he was arrested for a company that he used to work for a hedge fund for like a Ponzi scheme there.

Speaker 8:          01:13:32       Oh, wow. So everybody was celebrating. Apparently there's a new thing here where he, um, it looks like he says a friend of Kanye robbed him of $15 million. I don't know how that happened because see, it says I'm keeping his name in the headlines. Oh, there's a new, you know, a cognac out called the life of Pablo. He made a $15 million offer for exclusive ownership of the album. Um, but it'd be put forth 50 million on the album, only to be duped by a bit coin thief by the name of De Quan or, um, and he's writing who the fuck has my $15 million, uh, someone named. So anyways, so he's saying that, you know, all this shit. Now he also, in addition to this, had a beef going with, uh, Ghostface because he's the guy. Do you remember that? A few, like a year or so ago, Wu Tang decided to release an album with, they would only make one copy of and the, and it had like some crazy, you know, uh, cabinet chest made and it was one copy and then the person who bid on it would own that copy and they could do as they please with it.

Speaker 8:          01:14:53       I didn't know that. That's okay. It's kind of a crazy idea. Well he won. He, he owns it. There's Pos. Pos bought it for $2 million. And then the idea, a lot of people thought that whoever would do it would buy it and then share the album, you know, cause that would be the joy in it had thing to do is share the album. Well he said he's never even listened to it and it doesn't plan on sharing it. Wow. Just has to have it basically like, you know, like a villain, like a sociopathic piece of shit that he is. So yeah, he's a, he's a fucking wow. What a cool guy. So this piece of shit, he's also tweeted some bullshit to Ghostface, um, cause go said something about him. So he called him, uh, you know, I dunno, it caused some type of asshole.

Speaker 8:          01:15:43       He said ghost is mad that the Shaolin outsold his last five albums. Do the nonprofit rap rapper basically saying he doesn't sell records anymore talking shit. Well there's somebody you don't want to talk shit to this ghost face killer. Right. I don't know if you remember, not too long. Over the summer actually, um, uh, action Bronson talk made a kind of a slight dig at Ghostface and goes put out a video where he just eviscerated this guy for a full fucking, I don't know, 10 minutes. Um, he just talked mad shit and he's like, you got a big ass bitch one day I might sit that shit on fire. Yeah, it was my favorite line ever. I might sit that shit on fire and then he, he has a his mean face. It was like a fat kid. So Ghostface made a new video. This one is over 11 minutes long where he's talking shit to this super bill and Pos Martins strictly whatever. Um, so here's some stuff, some stuff right?

Speaker 6:          01:16:49       Why is that not as far as mine. Yeah. Hello?

Speaker 8:          01:16:55       Yeah. So I don't know why his bleak, but Martin says, where are your goons? Not as hard as mine. He was lifted up your skirt motherfucker. So already Ghostface winds, the entire thing

Speaker 6:          01:17:10       goes to stop pretending. Stop acting. Stop lying. Yo Man. Yo Man, you hilarious man. You must be on real in a certain man. You know what I mean? It took us out, man. It's like, Yo, you will forget supervillain man, the man with the 12 year old bag, this will he be, his name was Corelli right there when y'all see him. You know what I mean?

Speaker 8:          01:17:35       He does. He is built like a, like a young man. Uh, Martin, the Pos. Oh, it's 12 year old buttons. Yeah. So He's, he's talking shit about his build,

Speaker 6:          01:17:44       which, you know, I don't even know how we change to this. Like this is goals, verse three to pay it like 2016 you know what I mean? All you can do right now, just try to fly away in front of my face with this is, this is, this is error. Check this place out, man called dot knows anything. You know what I'm saying? Walking around with fake goes like, he's tough and he ain't got to a real bone in his body. You know what I mean?

Speaker 8:          01:18:08       I do know what you mean.

Speaker 6:          01:18:09       Yeah. I did all tough today. You won't come at me and you don't go to check out with the 2 million. I was acting like we washed the rappers, like I'm a washed up wrap up, but you don't put a washed up rap album for 2 million.

Speaker 8:          01:18:21       Yeah, that's a great point. Yeah. Probably the best point is if you're talking to shit to the guy, the you bought $2 million. Yeah. You get your life getting your entire, yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:18:31       So tell her wonder about your seriously, because I'm wanting to be like, Yo man, was he jumping rope as a child? Was he planning on how Scotch or eat ice cream with his fellows? You know what I mean? We'll have the sleep overs with the boys.
