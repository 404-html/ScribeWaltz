You know what I would love is if he wrote a song about this and then if you guys could rap battle, lovey, cooler. You know what I want to address is something came in you. You mentioned something during our ads, this episode, and then there's something kind of related to it in an email. Let's see. It says, Dear Tom and Tina, I've listened to your mom's house since episode two. What I would consider myself a bit of a mom cast historian during the heat of the Fedex Fedex scandal. I had that little tickle in the back of my brain saying, I remember you guys discussing Fedex podcasts. Alas, alas, I wrote it off, but a few weeks ago I decided, you know what? I'm going to get to the bottom of this.

Speaker 4:          00:23:02       So starting from episode 44 I listen to all of your podcasts through and through. Oh my God, I'm happy to report. I fucking found it. No, I am age episode one 51 I won't go into much detail. I'll just give you a timestamp. Hopefully this whole debacle can be laid to rest when a certain main mommy says FedEx the proper way. Thank you. Submitted by Tavin. Is it Tevin? Tevin. Caban well, well thanks for submitting whatever piece of that. Every time his name is said, residents are playing, they playing at Fedex field. So you'd say FedEx, Fedex, economic, that kind of thing. But it isn't that, at least for me, naming rights,

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       it's called, right. It kills my soul just a little bit to hear a beautiful stadium. The maybe some man said, I love to build a stadium. Let's let's build a stadium where the people could get together and congregate. Amazing way. It's a, it's a Herculean thing. And then fucking FedEx comes and they renamed it the Fedex stadium or blah, blah, blah. And you're like, no, no, no. It's not called that. It's called whatever the Fuck Wrigley Stadium. It's called this you piece of shit after the man who designed it or whatever. I think a lot kinda throw fans. Yeah, it's fine. The audio dropped out. Didn't drop out, you know? Exactly. I didn't hear that. The audio, the Nice, well it's a, it's a Herculean thing and then fucking FedEx comes and they rename it the Fedex stadium or blah blah blah. And you're like, no, no, no.

Speaker 3:          00:24:37       It's not called that. It's called, what's your guys? I can't believe somebody listened to. Thank you for doing that. Can You admit your mistake? No, I mean I dunno what mistake you speak of. I just know that this is such nonsense. What? Fedex? No, I'm saying that fuck says that. Always said it that way. Maybe I would had a stutter back then. That his stutter. Yeah, that was my speech impediment back when they had one and then I've been in treatment and I don't talk about doing ridiculous. Just not okay. I don't know. I didn't hear all that audio, but okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:20       I'm amazed. First of all, honor that you listened to so many episodes and thank you for digging that up and I rightfully will take my place on top of mount fed ex the king of the castle. Obviously I had said it right as most of you seem to acknowledge. So I think you know your place now and it's, it's, it's at the bottom. All right. Whatever. Okay. Fedex, FedEx, Fedex, whatever. Tomato, tomato, tomato, tomato predicts on good to me while I was gone by the way, sac town ball Sacramento was um, fantastic. We have a lot to cover there. We're going to get into some of the outside details, but the shows were a lot of fun. Amazing crowds. It just have the best fans up there. Of course

Speaker 3:          00:26:10       everywhere, same embryo. They all came out and Brad, it was fun. Thank you. Mommy's for coming. I knew you were in there. I could hear you tell it their mommy's cause they laugh at certain things.

Speaker 1:          00:26:19       People don't. It's great. Well it's, it's also um, it was really neat. I walked on stage one of my shows and a girl was sitting in the front row and with a marker she had written on her forehead. Hey Hitler. So you look at a girl marker and I'm like lipstick, I don't know. I go, hey killers on your forehead. She's like, yeah. I'm like, and all these people were like,

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       hey, like screaming, hey guys, the club, the employees were like what is going on with the girl on the other comment or the other audience members were like, why is that going on the Hay? Hitler theme has been one of my favorite because it's probably the most inappropriate thing. We've honored our permit. It's the most fun. And look, if you're on board, you're on board. If you're not, go fuck yourself. You're not a mommy. I mean kind of in a way it sort of, hey so I'm the place I want to shit in your mouth is actually in your mouth. I'm hoping that they actually ride the new place. The new thing that takes off is this and what I want to do is to come that is again on, cause that Nice Lady, it was from a national geographic thing. I said did the series finale of down.

Speaker 3:          00:27:42       We haven't watched it yet. That's probably a good point. Yeah. I'm saying this to doing some research. Stumbled on that. And then that's how you found that. I think so. Downton research. Yeah. I was like Oh in 1926 what happened? And then came out. What I want to know is this the best, what I want to know is common. So hard to find. Like I just want to give you calm. You have to really dig for come true. Yup. Yup. It's all you know. Well the guy come, it's always such a hard thing for men to ejaculate. You know? It's good that more attention is being focused on male orgasm gets no attention. And also I think it's also cool to help this girl that's trying to find it so badly cause she's probably her whole life's like I can't find what I'm looking for again, so sneaker load.

Speaker 3:          00:28:40       So when I was gone, um, you had a conversation loads. Your Dad, who you guys didn't talk about how many chicks he bang on a trip, but you did have a conversation with him. Do you want to set it up? Yeah, sure. So I invited all the pigeons keys over or my cousins shotty and Julie and everybody came to see the baby cause I've been keeping the baby under wraps, you know. Anyway, they came, uh, my father has been reminiscing about how much he hated having a baby, like pacifically me, not just a baby. Sure. Yeah, just me and a, and so I thought I would interview him about this theme because every time he comes over he like loves Ellis, but he's like, God, God, La Fuck wouldn't pay me to do that shit again. I'm like, what do you, what was so bad about, about me? He's like, Oh, you have to lik you're crying all the time. He hated it. He just hated the first part of my life. But then he loved being a dad later anyway, I just thought I would ask him. She busted out your phone. Yeah. I just as a casual interview. Yeah. And um, yeah, so this is, this is what we were talking about is the early days of me,

Speaker 12:         00:29:49       My Life Dad, when tell me about the best part of parenthood. Tell me when that starts. Go ahead. At two months. No, not three months. He said, oh I'm sorry. Yeah. Three years after. Yeah. That's the three. As you can tell the kid the shut the fuck up. Sit the fuck down. Go to sleep, leave me alone. Let me drink my beer. Oh, right. Cause I heard a lot of that as a kid. I heard a go play on the freeway. Yes, of course. Yeah. Whatsoever that no, nothing. I turned out amazing. Now obviously. Yeah, that's right. I see. Yeah. Tell me about when I was born. You said it was the best three months of your life. All of was bad. That was a worst three months of my whole life. I never forget. What was your favorite part about being a new parent and not the sleep a second.

Speaker 3:          00:30:39       Wait. So are parents not supposed to say this kind of stuff to their kids? Like you guys, I mean, you look at Paul's, is that normal? I mean, it's a joke. I know he's a good joke. Yeah, no, it's done. Oh really? No. Oh, because I've been hearing this shit. If I just thought everybody how their parents say crazy stuff like this. No, really? No. Wow. Okay. I mean there's, you know, there's different personalities. Like I imagine, I don't know, like my dad, you know, he falls in line with a certain personality type when it comes to that. He doesn't say stuff like that. No, no. Cause they, they're like, oh well can, what are your, yeah, they're, they're, they're kind of like the overly devoted type. Right. They go, there was nothing better. I loved it so much. I mean, you heard him on that phone call was, I didn't mind change your diapers.

Speaker 3:          00:31:23       I love your shoes all over man and care. He's that kind of love. Yeah. Where it's like the over the, I mean, I think there's, there's a middle ground, but yeah. Your Dad, um, I mean, I don't know if the standard, you're not supposed to say that kind of stuff. Do you like it suck to having yeah, a sign. Well, I mean maybe that's why I have such high self esteem. Yeah, it's probably why I'm sounding Romanian and hilarious though. Yeah, totally secure. Grew up. Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up is amazing. Yeah, that's pretty good. But he would tell me all the time, go play on the freeway. When you say shut the fuck up. No, no, no. There's a joke. But he would tell me I get lost and go play on the freeway. Like if cause he, he sounds worse than it is, but like she would be drinking his beers. You know what I mean? Like my dad or it's a lie.

Speaker 3:          00:32:11       I know. How does an adult, it sounds really bad. Yeah. Okay. So you know my dad drink like a 12 hour every night, right? That's normal. No, wait a minute. Are you serious right now? Yeah. You think that's normal? Well, it's, I'm like light beer. It wasn't like, it's not like always like Miller lite. I want you to picture something real quick. Just look at me. I can't, none that I know this is wrong. I can't, he wouldn't have a 12 right tomorrow. Right. Okay. Well it seemed normal at the time. Well here's the light light beer, Miller lite. And the thing is I'm worried about calories right now. No, I think because he drank it was like, I don't fucking know. You know my dad was a blue collar guy. I know he was a hard guy and he worked, he worked on in the forklift business for many years.

Speaker 3:          00:33:12       He had his own business. Really successful, you know, the 12 or a night is not injured. Right. But again, I have to qualify it with like he woke up for work at the crack of dawn, this dude work hard fucking car and was really successful. Functional, totally high functioning something, I don't know. Right. So 12 or, and then like I'll be, I'll be like eight or nine, I'd be like, Hey dad, you want to play golf? Play on the freeway. And then finally I learned if I asked him if I could have some of his beer, like he put some in a cup for me and then I, he put water in it. Like I could sit next to him and he was watching, he liked tennis, so he'd be watching the tennis game with a beer and if I drank some of it with them, I could hang out with them.

Speaker 3:          00:33:57       That was a cool way to bond with your dad. Yeah, it's weird, right? It's that you understand what go play on the freeway. Men, I laugh. He would laugh and say it. He'd go, go play on the freeway. C'Mon. Gumline and it was a joke. It wasn't like angry and I was kind of like, okay, like I got the message to fuck off so I would just go fuck off. And that's the neat thing about being only between like you're on your own years, eight, nine and 10 somewhere later in the beer game. Yeah. But here's the thing. Well my dad and his drinking though, he never really changed. It wasn't like he went from like, well that's what happens. One person tolerance when you have 12 and nine what happens? Right. But he never became angry or shitty or solen like he was just, he was himself.

Speaker 3:          00:34:45       But with 12 years it was kind of fucking weird. And he's from the old country too. You know, we have a higher tolerance for, well, my dad told me during communism, everybody was drunk all day, like on their jobs, cause there's no reason not to be sure. The full, what are you going to work hard for? There was nothing to do. We know about drink this bottle of vodka and I'll see what I with a wrench. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh for sure. Old country. Anyways. Okay, so go ahead, play it. Play the audio. Who Care? My Dad had to say about my childhood. Tell me about when I was born. He said it was the best three months of your life. That was a worst three months of my whole life. I never forget. What was your favorite part about a parent losing, including escaping communism, giving it an internment camp in Italy. Correct. The refugee camp. Refugee camp. Yeah. I know, but this is worse. You been born, this was worse than being a displaced homeless immigrant who doesn't speak a word of English at the age of 20? Escaping from a horrible, yeah.

Speaker 12:         00:35:53       Did you drink beer when I was a newborn because of, you know you can do it. And that guy, the go to the store to get the beer because always have to take care of you. What a what a miserable life with a good thing that in Canada you could order a beer to the house and they the beer company, we're bringing it off. No problem. And then so when dogs are really losing their mind, the background? Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:36:18       My cousin's shotty brought over her two year old. Uh Huh. And the dogs went bananas. Just chase this kid and the dog Sefton I'm the kid step in dog shit and everything. It was really fun. Really Fun. Okay. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         00:36:29       Drinking beer. How old was I when you could hear about cleaning rods? I'm so glad to hear that. That was good. Do you have any parenting advice for me by a kid, Elise? See I see at least a two.

Speaker 3:          00:36:49       Okay. So that's my cousin shotty. Who doesn't know what the fuck and be conversations are and like she chimes in all the time on everything. Like I was on the phone with Ryan sickler talking about like a sleep training, right? Because Ryan has a one year old Bella and they sleep train her and I'm just curious learning about it, his method because it worked for them and Mike fucking cousin is like listening to my conversation on speaker phone with Ryan and she's like commenting like, no, it doesn't work. No, you can't do it until he's six months old. Like just try me in. I'm like, motherfucker, lemongrass is not your conversation cause she shiny. That's what she does. She just butts in your shit. Like she, the personalities, like she just, she knows everything about everything and you're like, Bro, it's not, this is not for you. Like could you not fucking talk. So okay. But anyway, so that's shotty. It's shiny. I love you shiny. I love you. But you know, stay in B

Speaker 4:          00:40:12       Fuck you. This guy. That's terrible as it. Cool ponytail. I know I sang on his shoulder. He's going to touch it like crazy loud when he wants you to see it. That's why that he people would, pony tells you have to display it. The men, a guy and during one of my shows this weekend was like Tom, Tom, what? And he goes, look at it. Let me wear a ponytail. He showed me his money down. You have to show you, you have to showcase it. If you're going to be a dude, look at his deck. You can see it. I just sweat pants. Yeah, you guys have great. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:40:40       Sweaters don't look good on me and asked. One woman was stalking me and screaming, I hate you. I hate men.

Speaker 4:          00:40:48       And it's also like a bad act in class. Yeah, that's what I thought this is. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:40:54       See you daddy. You bastard and a man in the group would take this and run with it, but I'm bad. I'm a man. My Penis.

Speaker 4:          00:41:06       Just so you can see his dick. That's great. That was terrible. I hate these people. Yeah. Can I tell you something? My Dad is, we need to buy this for sure. We're going to, yeah, it, my dad's behavior is nothing, I think is my mom was such a cray cray. Then my dad seems normal by comparison. Yeah. I mean that's why I'm not doing this kind of stuff and crying in the fetal position. How are you not crazier than Shit television set comp. I swear to God, like watching American TV and be like, oh, did you think though like

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       families are like that or just on TV? No, I thought that everyone else's family was like that except for mine. And like one day I might meet people like that are really, yeah. What about when you would hang out with friends or boyfriends houses? Like were they more normal to you? Yeah, and that's why I wasn't home alone. I was always in my France on his house and shot, it was, his house was heaven. They had tuna casserole and their fridge and I was like her much so sweet. Castro, this sweet lady and she'd made there's cookies on the counter and you're like, wait, what? You guys have cookies casserole? What's that like? And now what about when she would come to your house? But she like, ah, yeah. Really? Yeah. I don't think she liked, we didn't hang out at my house. I have much because she was more like, hey art. Like Ah, like maybe my dad took us to Hungary. No, that's right. We were like 18, and uh, she's used to him now, so yeah. She's been with my family forever. She just used to it. Yeah. I, we should ask her actually. I'm not sure. Yeah, yeah. Uh, but

Speaker 1:          00:42:31       yeah, I dunno. Wait, so what did you think of, of like sitcoms and stuff? Um, yeah, I dunno. I mean, I kind of thought of it as, you know, I knew that I knew that my, you know, you're so aware of your foreign, you have to foreign parents. Yeah. But I had one, so the distinction is what really stood out there. Like my dad was a pretty much your standard American White Guy, right? He was just Apple Pie, you know? And my mom was like this total alien, you know? So you really, yeah. So it wasn't a IC, you're saying? Yeah. You had some comparison. The comparison is what would kind of bounce you go, okay, this is the American way of doing things, right. It's like the Latin way of doing things and that's what stands out, you know? And he has like, he has such the eye ideal American upbringing that we really would got get America normalcy to the fullest and then, and then she would put a little spices on it and she would fuck you all up with her bullshit. She would do, she was just, it was, that's what stood out is like that, you know? Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:43:30       yeah. Cause I really do feel like a, an alien because both my parents were so hardcore live here and grow up with two foreigners. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:43:40       You only think you understand as normal is when you're with other people. Yeah. Watching TV, you got what are, then you go to these houses and you see how they are. I just thought it would. Yeah. That was just their world. Got a lot of other houses suck though too, you know? Really. Yeah. I like my house. I mean, I remember I would go to my buddies, Dan Dan's house in Minneapolis and one thing that they always had that we never had was a bunch of junk food. And I was like, ah man. Just every, they had a one fridge that was just sodas. Ah, that's cool. You're 10 years old, you go like, we're going to do that and just soda.

Speaker 3:          00:44:12       Yeah. Okay. My Dad had a fridge in the garage just per fresca. FRESCA and bear. Yeah. You weren't just a quiet yeah. Hell yeah. Shit. Great.

Speaker 1:          00:44:22       There's uh, yeah, of that stuff. But he had all the sugary drinks, which has a 10 year old is really, you know, and the daily,

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       they limited what you could eat, your parents. We just never really had that. I mean, it would just wasn't on, we never were like throwing it on the grocery list. I never remember making that request. It was that thing where we had soda when you know it was, I dunno, maybe a weekend and you ordered a pizza and that's when you would always get like a two liter with a pizza, you know, delivered. That was the soda. We didn't have 20 cans of [inaudible] her. Yeah. My Dad, we always had it in my dad's. So we started to, I feel like as we got older, but you know, they back then when you're a kid, that's when diet coke became the craze. So my parents had diet coke in the house and when you're young you're like, this is fucking disgusting. Anything as a kid tastes like shit.

Speaker 4:          00:45:16       And then all of a sudden, I don't know, you turn 18, you're like, no, it's pretty good. It's better for me. Yeah. Yeah. So wow. We didn't have, I mean, so I remember his house being go, but then I remember just weird, weird people's houses. I remember that going to the, Oh, I had a friend that I liked, actually my mom's um, you know, eccentric or different, um, normalcy was, was normal to me because that's home. That's what you grab. What? I had a friend who, they are two American, there were like too quiet. I remember like nobody says shit to each other and they had a goal, like a fish pond in their house and me. I was like, I'm going to touch all these fucking fishes. And so I was such an asshole. I would touch all, they're really expensive. Quite. Yeah. Oh my God, that's such a deck yet.

Speaker 4:          00:46:03       But they are super, super reserved and I'm like, you guys are weird. I don't, I don't like quiet houses. That's the thing. You know how Charles thing is like you have to react. Told me like you love it. So when people were reserved, I always thought it was weird. I always took it as this like duplicitousness like Ah, these motherfuckers are shady. Like if you're not screaming, I mean something is wrong. I remember going to my buddy IRA's place when I was a kid. Yeah. Okay. It was a little, ah, where did you grow up? There's no, this kid was it, this is in Milwaukee. And when I would wake up and know feeling like Friday night or Saturday night there before they drove us home, they would toast bagels and melt cheese on them. And I was like, this is probably the best thing I've ever had in my entire life.

Speaker 4:          00:46:49       Huh. I'd, I'd never, never had a Bagel because you guys are not, you know, so no funny little hats in our house, but they, um, I really did think that was the, and I thought that was like Rad. I go, I cannot wait to go to his house again because, you know, I would say, why don't we have that at our house? And then in my house they would go like, Huh, that was too ethnic. It was just on your is I think, I dunno. It was just like out of the realm of possibilities. I remember I begged my mom to, uh, to bake something for me. I'd be like, mom, like all the other moms, they bake stuff for their kids. Well fuck these are that a mom. They don't

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       have to fucking work for a living. Like, okay. I'm sorry. Good conversation. It was fun. Yeah. You mean a half hour your life. Okay. Now I'm not talking like make it from scratch. Like just buy a fucking roll of Pillsbury bitch. Yeah. Cut that shit up. Put it in the oven. Oh, let me tell you this before we get too far away from it. Yeah. Um, so in, in we are ordering this by the way. Oh definitely. Yeah, we live and make a note of that. Yeah, we've got to get that. That's great.

Speaker 1:          00:47:56       I was in ball Sacramento this weekend. And you okay there we get in, we decided to go get some pregame pretty showed meal. We go to, uh, to get some smooshy. Mm. So we go to this place, it's really close to the club and we order food. It's media. It's just like, it's, it's okay. As far as Sushi places, it's not a, you know, it's not like, Oh wow, the Sushi here is amazing, but it's like, it does the job. You Go, it's not bad. It's not great. It's fine. It's not a succulent. Chinese guests, not secular, but it's fine. I order, we're done ordering. I'm there. I'm up there with blue band. Um, the bill comes, she drops off the bill. Now I'm on a business trip and you know, this is not unusual. Most comedians or even people that just travel for a living a lot to have their, they're basically personal expense card and your business expenses. It helps you organize, do your taxes and whatnot. So I pull out my business card, which happens to be American Express card. I put it on there and I say, you know, uh, ready to pay the bill. So the server just kind of very shortly rudely, I, in my opinion, responds visa, mastercard,

Speaker 3:          00:49:18       cash. No, she's a white lady it sounds like. No, she, she's a, she is a Hungarian wizard. Just got a real treat. Just that she is, yeah. Do you want to just, can we translate what you just said? Old Pussy eyes. She's Asian. Yeah. My Dad taught you that or your dad did teach me. Okay, good. So wow. She's a, yeah. Not from around these parts and says visa, mastercard, cash. And I go, she goes, which do you have? Which is not, yeah, it's not an appropriate answer. It's,

Speaker 1:          00:49:51       yeah, you can, I think you can go, oh, we don't take American Express. Right. Not what he goes, what do you have? And I go, this is what I have. She goes, you don't have anything else. And I at that moment I go, it's kind of interesting that she asks that because instead of saying, instead of reiterating that they don't take it right. She says, you don't have anything else. So I take my chances and say, no, I don't have anything else. In other words, like how are we going to resolve this? And she goes, okay. And she takes the card and she walks away and I go, oh, I guess they do take it. You assume she's going to use the card? Well, yeah. I mean, she took it. She took it, she leaves with it. She comes back, know when she comes back, she puts it down and she goes really loudly so that the whole section of the restaurant can hear.

Speaker 1:          00:50:44       She goes, your card declined. Oh yeah. Okay. And at that point I'm bothered for a number of reasons. A, I know that she's lying. Yeah. Okay. I'm 100% certain blackline and I'm actually going, I'm, you know, I'm about to investigate. But the other thing, the thing that really bothers me more is that her tactic to get the form of payment that she wants is that she's trying to humiliate me. She's trying to, she's banking on my announcement that your payment has been declined, is going to shame you into paying the way I want you to pay instead of just being straight forward. And from the beginning, I'm sorry sir, we don't take a minute to take it, which you've heard probably many times I've heard of before or deal with it accordingly. But she left with the car to run the card. Right. So she, so when she said your car was a client, I know for certain that she's lying and just to vet, make sure I go, okay, I flip the card over.

Speaker 1:          00:51:42       I go, I'm going to call the credit card. She walked, she was like, kind of didn't anticipate that that would be an option. Walks away. Okay. Walk away. I call the credit card company American Express. Hey, what's up? Um, I'm at a restaurant and they just said that my card was declined. Was it declined? No. And I said, well, so what's happening? He goes, well, there's no attempt made to charge your card. I said, okay. So now I'm pretty pissed about this, you know, so she lied. She blatantly lied, so then I go, Hey, I'm on the phone with the credit card company. Yeah, and the card wasn't declined and she just goes to visa, mastercard or cash and I go, no, that's what she says. Yeah, you, you call her out. At this point I'm standing at the front of the restaurant and it's getting, you know, she's being loud.

Speaker 1:          00:52:31       I'm being loud. I said, visa master. She goes, visa, mastercard or cash, and I go, no, this is it. This is the only thing I have. I didn't bring anything else. You're going to have to run it. She goes, your card declined. I go, no, it wasn't. Then she takes the card again. She swipes it, she hits, but she starts doing things like hitting different buttons within. After she swipes, see dark card, declined card. So I was pointing to the, to the monitor and I go, it looks like he was saying, he goes, your card hasn't been, there's no attempt made to run your card for your card. Hasn't been declined. And he goes, your card was just used to rent a car, which it was. It was just used in the check into the hotel, which by the way, they're so good about that.

Speaker 1:          00:53:10       He goes, your card, your card has not been declined. I go, okay. So I said, you're going to have to run the card or that's, you know, it's going to be it. And it starts to get, you know, I could tell that she starts speaking in her Pussy Samad language to somebody, um, you know, starts talking some shit. And I go, no, I'm not, I'm not going anywhere. You're going to have to run the card. Yeah. You know, she, she starts being more like verbal. Like she goes, no visa, mastercard. I go, all right, I'm leaving. I go, I had a hat. I lost that table. I go to grab it. And she goes, Huh. And she runs, she runs from the table back to the front. He goes, I called police, I called the police. This is for the whole rest. The whole restaurant is seat.

Speaker 1:          00:53:55       You went back just for your hat. But I also, I was implying that I was Bailey. Oh. So like she got really scared. And then as she, she's running, she goes to pick up the phone and I go, well pay the bill. And she goes, okay. So I take the money, kind of, you know, throw it on the counter. And I said, as I left, I go, I want you to know that you're a liar and you're a bad person. Yeah. Have someone translate that. And then I walked out, wow, that's made up yet. But I did say, you're a liar and a bad person. Um, so anyways, I was really fucking pissed about her. And it wasn't about not accepting American Express. It was about the fact that I think, I think she's a horrific human being. You, she lied. It was like the whole room.

Speaker 1:          00:54:42       It was righteous. It was, yeah, it was a lie. But it was, it was that the attempt to publicly shame someone, I think, I don't think there's any end to how, how much you should be shamed after that for trying to get your way through that method. I got back to the hotel, um, I put an Instagram post up later just saying, this place is terrible. Um, I didn't even explain really why I just said they were fucked up place and then dude, it was like, it was amazing. The, uh, the listeners of our show, he didn't, you unleashed mommy power around. The problem is you gotta be careful when you unleash mommy powers because they are strong. They, it was artwork. It is. This is, this is, this is some of the modern art masterpiece. What has happened? I think this is like a happening.

Speaker 1:          00:55:41       What they used to call him the 60s. This is, this is fucking art. I have to commend, I went so our listeners to know that some of you are fucking legit comedy writers. It was so funny. I really don't. I, I can tell you that if you had people that listen to this show, that we're professional comedy writers, they were not, they couldn't do it funnier than what, you're funny. These are pure fucking art dude. Here are some of them. This is, this is moments after it says, warning, this is not a poly by friendly establishment. My Mommy also developed an Asian accent after we ate here. She can't stop speaking in broken English. Can someone explain

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       this? Ah, I'd rather move to the Midwest. Ooh. Then eat here again. Mommy told me not to go, but my boy Tom and Mr. White folks was in town saying some hoes and also making Kim in airtight and Joe, right. My jeans were a little high but not too tight. I had a rectum role. And how do you say an Asshole Ching Chong, Ching Chong. Next thing I know Mike Tyson comes in with Bruce Bruce and everyone said, Hey Hitler, next time I will go somewhere else. Most likely on the hundreds blog. They don't even have any bikes and they don't even know who big daddy Kane is. I mean like they tied in all the references. The best part of this is that people who don't know your mom's house are going to read this. Like the average Yelper is going to be like, what the fuck happened? And this restaurant, um, read that one actually a pretty good place.

Speaker 4:          00:57:16       Definitely try the me. So it's Hella Salty. The garden salad was good, but the dressing was kind of wet. So get that on the side. The staff was nice. My server's name was DICO. I thought that was inappropriate as I was with a group of children overall. These particular agents make a pretty good Sushi. One Star, one star. I don't know. I don't know if that was any to do with our show. No, I think it was just, I think someone's legit so made me laugh. My server's name was Dick. Oh, this is this one here. I read onstage and it almost brought the house. Read it. It said, this place really makes my jeans low. End Loose. I was treated like a calm dog and called big words. The food tastes like the devil's driveway and made me brown a six. You know what I'm saying? For reals doe. I almost threw so much Skype punches like my boy crazy looks and shit. In conclusion, this place seriously needs to hide and tight in their jeans. Before my mommy's and I ever consider making their Sushi into brown ever again. He asked if I had to choose between eating here again and being retarded, I would be retarded.

Speaker 4:          00:58:21       Good work babies, baby. See that was from Norcross. Georgia was really fun. I love, I like the idea. He's like, I would never make your food into Brownie yet. That is actually what you do when you go to a restaurant. You're like, I choose your place to make my brown Brown Brown. That's so interesting. I never, that's so deep, bro. I never thought of it that way. Shout out to everyone out there and doing their thing and stuff like that. I came here to get my Sushi on. I was very disappointed. I wore my cleanest done. I'm gonna pull them up over my retarded tests. The customer service was the worst. The fish smelled funny, but the way she just said what? It's only smells. It's okay. It was very confusing because it clearly was not only smells and was not okay, and I made it to my squatty potty. My, how you say rectum, a straight seven. I had to go shit to showers for reals. Doe Next Stop Brown talk. Know what I'm saying? I would have to be a lot more targeted than I already am. So funny. That was like, how many your mom's house references

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       can you squeeze in so good in 12 hours? Yes. Had like 81 one star reviews fully written. Hilarious. That was not even meant. So look, I think they got, they fully got what they deserved. They've already managed to get a bunch of the reviews removed. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, you know, I'm glad it caused them to think about the way they treat their customers. We don't have to, I'm not asking you guys to bombard the more, that's why I've attempted to not mention them again, but just know that, um, because people were asking me like, well, what happened? I told you what happened. I felt extremely justified in asking people to do that to them. Um, and it's just, it's all in fun. I mean, look, if they're being removed, it's not going to harm them. And as it's, you know, it's a silly way of getting back at a business.

Speaker 1:          01:00:18       That was shit that was shitty to me. So, uh, but yeah, just the people go, I wouldn't just do that. I wouldn't for fun, say, Hey, go fuck up these people's reviews just for pure amusement or because like, oh, I didn't think the Sushi was good, but when I feel like, um, you know, somebody mistreats me or miss [inaudible] anyone then I don't think it's a, it's really, you know, going forward to ask for that. No, but it's a funny way of getting back. By the way, this Mug, do you remember, I don't remember who gave this to those crew. Yeah. I don't know if he can see it on the camera, but it's, it's, it says empty jar guarantee Australia and he made that. I know. And then it says didn't, doesn't smell done burn integrase and it's got chuck Woolery. We just emailed each other yesterday. Yeah. This is like my favorite cup and the house. It's great. Yeah. Yeah. They made a couple of those, a couple of go's crew one those funny did. Uh, Chris and Pete. Yeah. Shout out to both of you guys doing your thing and stuff like that. I know. For real though, y'all are busy.

Speaker 1:          01:01:19       Yeah. So there's, um, this I've been wanting to show you, we have so much to share so much today. I've collected materials you've collected. Aw, he's back. So this, we haven't played them in a while. Um, but he's in the news. Did you know he's in the news now. I'll get to that. Just to give you an idea. Yes. This is Brian Silva, um, otherwise known as a vine star who rolls in swag and he makes, he made a lot of videos talking about how dope he is and you know, it'll take your girl and yeah. Doing this thing, stuff like that. He was doing his thing. He's really into his body and his physique and is, it looks great. It's always like, by the way, you know, as a fat guy, nothing irritates me more than somebody who's super, super thin and it goes like, I'm super muscular.

Speaker 1:          01:02:13       No, you're not. You're just really skinny. I like his body. You do. I, I'd like to have it. Oh, he's got like a lady's body. It's a nice figure. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:04:01       Yeah. For not knowing what to expect. And all silver would say is free me over and over again today. Silver stuck to a single message. How do you think you should be free? Okay. I told him a big mix up and they confusion. Truman, that's all I have to say. Thank you. No, it would not address why he took the social media and posted videos while barricaded inside that house.

I'm more compassion, the most competitive. It's very competitive in the gym. Seven days a week we're going to go sweat takes care of himself physically. Um, really goes after it as a hoe. But um, on top of that he's also a rapper over working on my raps and as a rapper. Um, even on the show he got called out by one of the other hose. Yes. Hey, hold on. Just, you know he's from Juggalos. Did we say that? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's super airbrushed here by the way. Yeah. I mean that's really, but no, I'm sorry. Those tattoos are this shitty in real life too. Yeah, but they've also airbrushed or whatever. Wait in real life. How do you know? Cause he had come in his balls and I found it. No you don't. I've seen a TV show. They can't do it for TV every week and look at it. Look at this mess. What the fuck? It was way crazier. Now what is that? It's way crazier. Is that a cover up like he had some swastika isn't, no, it's like, um,

Speaker 3:          01:13:40       I don't know. Drinking too much coffee. What? Like, like a cover up those swots because if you're going to be a hoe here, I'm going to ask my cousin Julie. Julie listens to the show. Julie. What the fuck? Like why, why this mass?

And he's got his little nip nip pierced and oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, it's a lot men, the guys a lot. I think when men are this fit, personally for me, it's very feminine. It's very vain and a feminist. What I'm talking about. No, I'm Sarah and I'm not just saying that because you're not to be a people pleaser here, but I'm serious.

Speaker 4:          01:14:47       Not attractive to me. Well, it's not just being in shape. It's the way that you present how you were in shape. It's vain. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's wanting to be fit. But like this, this is ridiculous. You're ridiculous man. Oh my life. Yeah. Oh my, he's added a lot. Yeah. That earlier shots. Sure. Um, anyways, this is not what we're, we're not focusing just on nick. Yeah. I mean like tattoos in and of themselves are not lame. This Guy Kinda want to talk about his new song. My fuck. Um, this actually came out fucking last week. Oh, so we, yeah, we've played, yeah, I know. We've played breaking this guy. Dammit. We're breaking, breaking a sweat. The name of this song, if you listen a few episodes back, I don't remember the episode number. We could look it up. We, uh, we talk about his rap battle with then we played on the show that they were on was Gigolos.

Speaker 4:          01:15:42       So anyways, this came in, it's a song that he's put out. It's called breaking a sweat. I, I'm sweating. I will do, I'm so embarrassed for him already. Well you shouldn't be. I think we should have legitimately give him a shot and let the listeners decide whether or not this is a good song. And I was like, radio stations do that. They're like, is it hot or not? Like call us, let us know. You can't really call us, but you can certainly let us know. Oh, you can certainly comment on youtube on the video itself and let, let a brother know if he's on the right. All right, so here it is. It's court. Okay. Ah, Shit. Breaking a sweat. Hold on, hold on. I got to get ready. Are you ready? Here we go. Okay.

Speaker 12:         01:16:37       That's correct. Cold bed. The Ketchup. My take off like a jet is a sense that you watch too much TV. You don't know who get met. I'll never forget, I said it doesn't make sense.

Speaker 16:         01:17:10       Milk your boy

Speaker 4:          01:17:22       so far. It's really good. Holy Shit.

Speaker 17:         01:17:29       [inaudible] I can't be bro.

Speaker 4:          01:17:33       Daddy sweating those balls. Oh Man. Well, we're all wondering is where's the comm? So wait, where's the video? I thought we were going to see some visuals and I'm upset that I hope he makes a video for breaking a sweat, but it does look like he has a bunch of other songs. Cool. I'm ready. I'm ready. Are you, are you going to, do you want to get into all of them? All right. This song, what's the verdict on breaking a sweat? It's terrible. It's really bad. It's terrible. You're really, this is, this isn't your best work. This is a really bad song. But in mixed defense, you buy an album. A lot of times you go, sure you know it's an accomplished musician and you say, sure, yeah, this isn't their best song. Maybe this not, maybe not this number. Maybe another number. What about born to be bad? Sure. It's got eight views. It's breaking a sweat is 20 and this is pretty bad, Huh? It's like kind of an original premise. Let's see if one to be bad is um, his good. Okay. I'm so embarrassed already. What part?

Speaker 7:          01:18:36       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:18:45       10 seconds in. It's better than breaking a sweat. I'll tell you that. Yeah. This is better than breaking a sweat. I like the artwork. Yes. It's um, it's 15 different loads from him. Yeah. Yes, man. He's very emo.

Speaker 7:          01:19:00       Must be restored. Shit. My mind, why are you can't blame me for reading. Blocking my fire. I paid a lot more. I walked a tight. Wow. Wow. I keep hearing these voices scream in Poland and I listened. Dangerous Wall. They had four paces, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm sick of waiting.

Speaker 4:          01:19:35       All right. Yeah. Is it me or is, is it off the timing? Like he, he raps not in time where there's a lot that's off. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Is there a, is there an actual video or no, these are all just the songs. A gigolo four views. Four months ago I was put on group. He pitches step up. What do you want to hear? I'm out of this world. We fight. Um, it's up to you. Oh look, leave. Leave with me. No. Tipping in and has 103 views. It might be the song of the album. Is that the breakout hit? It could be if it's got 103 views and this is the last one. Okay. It hurts my soul. I think we should. Yeah, we should give it a break after this. So this is our last shot. We're going to go with the highest viewed song on the album, a tipping in sip and let's see what happens. Here we go.

Speaker 5:          01:20:27       [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          01:20:45       anything past the past I didn't give some tracks.

Speaker 4:          01:20:52       It's not good. It's better than the other two songs. Then for those 26 seconds it was, you know, it's really hard to do. What's that? To have a video up performance on youtube and only have two views. That's actually really hard. Does not have a lot of videos that have such a low view count and they're able to have two views

Speaker 7:          01:21:12       and it's been up for four months. Even someone stumbled on it accidentally and I was like, it looks like it's his page here.

Speaker 4:          01:21:35       He doesn't have, he doesn't have a good cadence. It doesn't have to be a voice for rapping. He isn't good at actually writing lyrics and this is a bad path for him to take that good. Yeah. Can I talk like man, I'm going to throw it out here. Yeah, he's failing is you see how there's like 12 personalities of nick hoc and that? Yes. That's the problem. The guy doesn't know who he is and what he stands for us. If you watch the show too, he'll show up at the bar. Like this guy in the middle. You don't know who this guy is the next day he feels like this. Yeah, I know he's, he doesn't know who he is. Confused. It's all right. He needs to pick an identity people awhile sometimes. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Um, the thing is

Speaker 7:          01:22:22       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:22:25       who do you think you are? I am something to think about, right? Yeah. Something to think about, to think about. So I have this to show you. The life is pretty cool, confused young man, man. That's, it's all about something's wrong. Everything here, it's all bad. Ain't start taking that off. I feel better now. It makes me feel weird. I feel uncomfortable. I feel his pain or something. I don't know. Yeah. I feel like something's wrong. So, um, oh, okay. Old School. This little episode you were on. Yes. I was on this episode of [inaudible] two wraps, man. Miss you. I'm to be wrapped.

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       I really loved that show. That show, man. It was, it was seriously what I look forward to so much during the week.

Speaker 4:          01:23:13       What's the, what day was this on?

Speaker 1:          01:23:15       This was on, what is it? Original air dates? It was, was it a weekend show? Friday. Saturday? I can't remember now. I used and I used to never miss it. That's funny.

Speaker 4:          01:23:24       I used to watch 120 minutes every Sunday night on MTV at midnight. Yeah. It was a good one to stay up for. And they play all the alternative videos with the third no videos anymore. And MTV, right? It's gone. Oh yeah, it's done. It's a shit show. Shows 88 to 95. Damn. I feel like it was on longer than that. It's fun. Yeah. Yo, MTV remedy raps. Um, it used to add lover was on there, right? Oh yeah. I remember seeing flavor flavor on this show for the first time and being like, what the fuck Dr Dre and Ed Lover. But it was a different doctor dre. Right. The big guy right there. You see, right. Right to dry and there's Dj dad mouth. Yeah. Um, and the J Paulie bye.

Speaker 1:          01:24:09       Yeah. I mean, I remember watching, I remember watching a, like certain episodes stand out to me. I remember when Wu Tang was on yo MTV raps and they did the, the mystery of chess boxing. Um, it's like the, one of the, it looks like the enter the 36 chambers cover like those masks on. And I was hearing that sound, it was a sound I'd never heard before. Like, what the fuck is this? That was like the introduction to Wu Tang was from Yo MTV raps. Oh, okay. To me, you know, and probably to most people why kids are watching 120 minutes. Yeah, I know. I know. It was pretty awesome though. I remember it was seeing Redman and are a lot of you anyways. Here's Eric B and rock him.

Speaker 4:          01:24:51       Eric B and Rakim. I like these two. No, Rakim, Rakim, Rakim, raw McKean. Let's see, Eric Bay

Speaker 18:         01:25:00       rack card. I love, I've got to would be a rock of the video. One of my favorites. I like, I like that dude. I listen to my lyrics. You know what I'm saying? To keep me on my thing. You know what I'm saying? That of that nature. I'll listen to like a Bob James Best

Speaker 4:          01:25:20       part of this interview. So it's Eric B and Rakim probably the first time they're on yo MTV raps and they're asking him like, so what do you, what do you like to listen to? And his first, I think it's his first answer is I listened to my shit. Yeah. So what's your inspiration? Me? Yeah, he's smart guys.

Speaker 18:         01:25:43       I'll let you know my lyrics. I listened to her like that. Good. I'd take her best days when the light bulb.

Speaker 4:          01:25:52       Tom, what's your favorite comedy? Me. I listen to my own shit, my jokes. So I remind myself of what I'm all about. That's what you just said. What was that guy in the back? What's that motherfucker doing? It's like just chilling man. That is just chilling. He lied. He was supposed to be there.

Speaker 18:         01:26:09       Dave Brown still my main thing still it had, I lived in a little bit of everything north name because the type of music I relate to them on the plane.

Speaker 4:          01:26:20       Wow. You know what I'm saying? That was the filming I'm talking about and just to be sure, just to make sure we know we have a dozen. This, this reminds me, this makes me, um, I don't know. This seems so authentic. It is. This is a time where like MTV actually broke music and musicians where music should, like these guys were really fucking musicians. Yeah. Not this horse shit of today. These guys are real fast trying to make it as music. Yeah. Like this was genuine. I mean these are low shit. Nick Hawks a yesteryear, right? This is before the time of the Internet and in competition shows where people thought they could just make a, hey, I, I'm a musician. Look at me on youtube. Like these motherfuckers really did it fucking chain on Eric beat. It's awesome that you guys got them with the Mercedes.

Speaker 4:          01:27:11       Yeah, of course. That was so cool. But back then that was like, what do you think has chain ways on Eric is so heavy. Yeah. That's like a 25 pounds away. His neck down. Yeah, for sure. I want to get one of those. Yeah. And you should spend a lot on it. No, I'll I get a fake one. It's just all about the look, you know. Okay. I'll you started going to meetings that I want you to spend money rope chain 25 grand or something. Yeah. But really personalize it so that the resale value is low. Alright, here we go.

Speaker 18:         01:27:39       Don't say anything. What I'm saying,

Speaker 4:          01:27:44       here's why that's good. Short interview. Lots of trail. Yeah, the ratio is good on there. Yeah. Nah mean no to hell. We don't, you ain't see anything yet. And it's a mainstream show, which is even better. Yeah. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? No, to give him a run for his money cause we were like, that's pretty cool. You got the God Mc right there. That's, you know, rock him. Um, is there anything we can put them up against? And then we have this from del, the Funky homosapien. Oh, I'm, I know that you gentlemen as well. Yeah. So let's see how he does on this right here.

Speaker 11:         01:28:23       Everybody, a rash should be unified. We all wrapping. You know what I'm saying? So what I'm saying is why don't we just build a bad ass man? Like we ain't got to be told me there. You might not like somebody, you know what I'm saying? But that don't mean you say, hey know or nothing like that. You know what I'm saying? That's not what I'm talking about. To pop as one, you know what I'm saying? She be unified. So check this out. It's a wrap. Since we married about six years old, he's a kid but not living, you know, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 1:          01:29:21       This, I think even if Nick Hawk, we're just start doing interviews this way, he'd be a better rapper then. He knows that too.

Speaker 3:          01:29:27       Yeah. But do you see how back then it was like you fucking started a craft. Yeah. Uh, being a musician at the age of like 14, and not only that, people actually talk like people, it wasn't all about like, I got this motherfucking homes, I've got money bitches. Yeah. I'm so fucking, I'm awesome. I'm awesome. I'm awesome. Like this guy is actually saying

Speaker 1:          01:29:47       Ramazan is one of the best things. It's one of the foundations of being a great MC, right. Is I'm awesome. And there's actually a lack of, I'm awesome now because what you would say you're awesome about it. Yes. You need to say you're awesome about your skillset right now. It's like, I'm awesome. I own shit. Or like material in it, you know? Yeah. I have a lot of jewelry, but back then it was like, you don't want to fuck with my style. Right. And how my flow is just, you know. Right. It's unmatchable, um, the nic hoc of, of you know, of the rap world. And so that's what you would say, you can't fuck with me on. And it was awesome. Not My stuff. Look at all the shit that I have. Yeah. Now it's like, exactly. He's like, I got six houses, 20 cars. That shit's boring. Yeah, I agree on that. But you definitely want to say that. You cannot fuck with me on a mic. That's what it's all about. Right? Right. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:30:46       This guy is actually talking about other stuff. Yeah. It's just refreshing to see a rapper or talk about stuff other than bitches and money and all we had to do was go back to 25 years to get somebody to say some people were people on television to even watching those guys on new MTV raps. Ed Lover. Yeah. He just acted like a person, dude. Yeah. It wasn't like, hey, like totally fucking phony Malone.

Speaker 1:          01:31:07       Yeah. They used to have the, the real kind of a, it's a wacky now it's like a wacky persona. Like they have to act. They can't be like, Hey, what's up? Welcome back. Right. He was like, he really was himself there

Speaker 3:          01:31:19       and it's so much more relaxing and engaging to watch. Yeah. Like I actually wanted to see what they're, what they're talking about. Cause they were normal. Yeah. Maybe that's why people like podcasts now cause we're not fucking being phony retards. Yeah, yeah. Cheeses. I know. That's why I saw lobular how la La la,

Speaker 1:          01:31:39       he really killed it on that. You know what I'm saying? It's a much longer interview. So again, you gotta go, you know where, where do you stand on that? You know, where are you?

Speaker 11:         01:31:49       You know what I'm saying? The old man, you know what I'm saying? I'm saying, you know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying, by the way. Well, you know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 4:          01:32:17       By the way, big props to, uh, the guy that did the interview in a loud environment. So you hear just boom and music playing in the background the whole time. Now is this guy from ban the Pharcyde del, the Funky homosapien. What is he in? He's in, um, phone it Funky Homosapien Oh, I thought it was a band I ever glyphic. Ah, I don't know who are this is really that. Yeah. Um, I like how it cuts to like his different poses. What do you know what I'm saying? Yeah. It's even a year. Yeah. Yeah. That's great.
