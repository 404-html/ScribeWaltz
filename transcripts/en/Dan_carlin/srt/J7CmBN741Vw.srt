1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,390
Because some bus,

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,400
it's history,

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:04,790
41,

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,500
a date which will live in infamy,

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,240
perfect to the lead from this time and 
place,

6
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,780
I take pride in the words Ich Bin,
the Alina

7
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:46,140
The drama.
Hi,

8
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,510
welcome.
This kind of examination because people 

9
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,270
have got to know whether or not their 
president or crop,

10
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,380
if we dig deep in our history and our 
doctor and remember that we are not 

11
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,710
descended from fearful man.

12
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,700
It's hardcore history.

13
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:22,660
The dictionary defines the word laconic 
as a form of speech that is blunt or 

14
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:31,031
pithy that uses an economy of words to 
make a point and sometimes the point is 

15
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:36,860
particularly biting or on target or 
maybe mysterious,

16
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,640
and I love the word because the word 
refers to a way of speaking that was 

17
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,160
popular amongst a particular group of 
people in Ancient Greece.

18
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,940
People known as lack of Demoniac,
otherwise known as spartans laconic 

19
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:56,330
speeches,
spartan speech.

20
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,730
That's the way they're supposed to have 
talked.

21
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,730
Imagine you know the love child of Clint
Eastwood and Batman,

22
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,420
and that's the way they spoke.
You know man's gotTa know his 

23
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,620
limitations.
Man's got to know his limitations.

24
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,680
Spartans are the kings of the one liners
in ancient Greek history and they are 

25
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,310
cinematic and character.
I mean there's not a movie maker out 

26
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,131
there that wouldn't want Clint Eastwood 
during his various movie years playing 

27
00:02:27,131 --> 00:02:29,870
various forms of Spartans,
you know,

28
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:31,970
from a Spaghetti Western era in his 
twenties.

29
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,020
He could play your average spartan 
warrior and he gets into the dirty Harry

30
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:37,130
films,
you know,

31
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:38,240
72,
73,

32
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:43,241
19,
74 and he begins to age a little bit 

33
00:02:43,241 --> 00:02:45,311
more,
but he plays one of those older spartan 

34
00:02:45,311 --> 00:02:45,311
warriors and then you get him,
you know,

35
00:02:45,311 --> 00:02:48,851
after the dirty Harry's or over.
And he's an older man and now he's the 

36
00:02:48,851 --> 00:02:51,410
king and he talks like he talks in all 
his other movies combined with Batman.

37
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:52,490
And you have,
you know,

38
00:02:52,491 --> 00:02:57,491
the way the spartans are supposed to 
have spoken laconically how cool is it 

39
00:02:57,651 --> 00:03:01,900
the 25 centuries after those people were
at the height of their fame and power.

40
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,230
We still know the way they talked.
It's famous,

41
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,270
it's famous because people wrote about 
it.

42
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,120
People whose works,
we still have

43
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,930
telling you the way a certain people 
spoke that long ago.

44
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,470
Describing some of the things that they 
said,

45
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,450
all these sorts of little details help 
bring color to the story.

46
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:30,451
They,
they help us all relate to these people 

47
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:32,761
a little bit more.
These are human touches that flesh out 

48
00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:36,031
these historical figures.
When you begin to get this sort of 

49
00:03:36,031 --> 00:03:40,111
stuff,
the sorts of details that you were 

50
00:03:40,111 --> 00:03:42,541
likely to hear in an oral tradition 
anywhere in the world before this time 

51
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:46,741
period,
but when you begin to get these stories 

52
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:49,201
that have come down to us,
you begin to see truly cinematic type 

53
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:54,301
creations stories that you could take 
with very little changes and updating 

54
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:58,450
and make movies out of them today and 
have them be popular

55
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,060
and it's not just the character 
development either.

56
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:06,200
The themes can be epic in these stories.
Take for example,

57
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:10,400
the most famous story involving Sparta 
at all.

58
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,050
The famous incident in for ADBC.
He at the pass of Thermopylae,

59
00:04:15,051 --> 00:04:20,051
the so called hot gates.
This may be because of the movies and 

60
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,230
because of the books that have been 
written forever.

61
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,590
This may be the earliest confirmable 
historical event.

62
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,620
Most Americans know about the defensive 
300 spartans against a million or so 

63
00:04:30,981 --> 00:04:35,981
Persians,
a battle that some have described over 

64
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:40,040
the era's for the existence of Western 
civilization.

65
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,440
By the way,
if those are the stakes,

66
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,860
whose side are you rooting for?
What was it?

67
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:48,290
The India leader Mohandas Gandhi 
supposedly said,

68
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:51,050
when someone asked him what he thought 
of Western civilization,

69
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:53,600
didn't he say something like,
I think it would be a good idea.

70
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Nonetheless,
the way this story is framed from the 

71
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,190
get go is designed to have you affiliate
with one side over.

72
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:07,191
The other.
One side is like the plucky little 

73
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:09,861
republic with Luke Skywalker in star 
wars and their beleaguered and you know 

74
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:14,601
they're good and they're under pressure 
and they're trying to survive against 

75
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:18,231
darth vader and the empire.
That will sniff out all freedom and hope

76
00:05:18,691 --> 00:05:21,060
and happiness and you know,
all those kinds of things.

77
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,720
That's the way the ancient story is 
handled.

78
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,600
Have what are called the Greek and 
Persian wars.

79
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:34,090
A moment that has sometimes been 
portrayed in apocalyptic terms for what 

80
00:05:35,511 --> 00:05:38,390
is sometimes been called the West once 
upon a time.

81
00:05:38,391 --> 00:05:43,300
Christendom,
so already many in the West are going to

82
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,390
feel like it's a sporting event and 
we're the home team,

83
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:51,391
right?
We're all homeowners when it comes to 

84
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:53,131
the Greek and Persian wars,
unless of course you're more like the 

85
00:05:53,131 --> 00:05:54,970
people who were portrayed as the 
Persians back then remember,

86
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:58,670
this is not just an ethnic thing.
This is a values

87
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:03,700
thing,
and in the narrative sometimes called 

88
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,831
the grand narrative by some greases,
fighting for things like liberty and 

89
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:10,721
freedom and democracy and artistic.
I mean everything that the evil empire 

90
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:14,801
isn't evil.
Empire will sniff it all out and make 

91
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:14,801
slaves of everyone.
So who are you going to side with?

92
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:18,710
Right?
The story of [inaudible] is one of those

93
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:23,711
that is absolutely dramatic beyond 
anything you get in earlier history and 

94
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:25,880
it's because you have a master 
storyteller.

95
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,910
Imparting the story to you.
When I started in news reporting and 

96
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,451
editor said to me,
your job is to relate the facts of the 

97
00:06:34,451 --> 00:06:36,620
story,
the true information,

98
00:06:36,621 --> 00:06:39,020
and do so in the most compelling way you
can.

99
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,800
If you imagine the battle of Thermopylae
as written by,

100
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:47,801
say the scribes of Babylonia,
it might sound like this,

101
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,920
in the 14th year,
the king of lands by the will of Marduk 

102
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,520
overcame the Spartan army at a place 
called the hot gates.

103
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,550
Two hundred 97 of the enemy were 
counted.

104
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,760
The Spartan King went to his destiny.
The Babylonians had been writing that 

105
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:06,800
way forever.
They were great.

106
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,100
Record keepers.
Things were a little dry though.

107
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,800
Now north of them were the Assyrians,
a culture that existed sort of alongside

108
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:20,801
the Babylonians,
a lot more aggressive and big on the 

109
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:23,540
propaganda front and didn't mind 
shoveling people's nose in their defeats

110
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,560
and they like to maintain,
shall we call a muscular foreign policy.

111
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,040
There's what sounded a little bit more 
like darth vader's pr from issuing a 

112
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:38,051
press release.
They would have described the battle of 

113
00:07:38,051 --> 00:07:38,630
thermopylae like this,
like a storm.

114
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:42,380
I overthrew them all.
I slew their king.

115
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:46,840
I crucified their land.
I devastated that.

116
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:51,870
You may notice that there's not a lot of
character development there and less 

117
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:56,441
making the king of Assyria.
Frightfully terrifying is the 

118
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:58,160
development you're after.
Nonetheless,

119
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:03,161
as I said in this story,
darth vader's really the only character 

120
00:08:03,161 --> 00:08:06,791
on the other side that gets fleshed out 
very much compare the sample Babylonian 

121
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:13,061
and the Syrian approaches to this story,
to something like the description you 

122
00:08:13,061 --> 00:08:17,330
get from people like Heraclitus of 
helicon Asas sometimes called the father

123
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,910
of histories,
occasionally called the father of lies,

124
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,360
writing his history,
a generation after the events at their 

125
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,360
mop Ali.

126
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,380
He talks about,
you know the spartans blocking this 

127
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,531
road,
and there's a tale that has developed 

128
00:08:32,531 --> 00:08:35,711
over the hundreds of years afterwards of
an event that people have been adding a 

129
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:37,850
few screen writing touches to since the 
very beginning.

130
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:43,450
As the story is often told,
there's a bunch of Greeks trying to 

131
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,640
block the army of the Persians from 
coming into southern Greece.

132
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,020
Xerxes,
the crack of doom named Persian king,

133
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,430
the only truly free person in his whole 
society.

134
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,940
The story would have you believe rules 
all of Asia and so many other lands that

135
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:04,941
he is entitled a King of Kings.
All his people or the equivalent of 

136
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:09,861
slaves who can live or die on his whim 
and when he orders them to fight the 

137
00:09:09,861 --> 00:09:14,361
spartans in this past,
they obey and our whipped by overseers 

138
00:09:14,361 --> 00:09:18,861
onto the spears of the spartans.
The last stand is it's called a 

139
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:19,110
thermopylae.

140
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,430
The greatest last stand probably in all 
human history was not supposed to be the

141
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:25,980
kind of last stand.
It turned out to be there with thousands

142
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:28,230
of Greek soldiers at their monopoly 
initially,

143
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,490
but eventually it became apparent that 
it was going to be a death trap.

144
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,340
And so the Spartan King,
a guy named Leon,

145
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:40,341
he does supposedly sent the other Greeks
away and kept a sort of rear guard.

146
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:45,711
If you want to stick with the narrative,
a rear guard for Greek and western 

147
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:49,041
freedom behind to hold off the Persians.
There were other Greeks who were 

148
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:52,050
involved in the so called last stand at 
thermopylae,

149
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,360
but it's the spartans who get the most 
attention,

150
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,430
about 300 of them.
And again,

151
00:09:56,431 --> 00:10:00,450
you can understand why as characters 
they were fascinating in their own time.

152
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,660
The spartans are a kind of a cultural 
experiment.

153
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,110
A better way to put it is when you think
about all human history together,

154
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:12,380
there's enough law of averages stuff 
working where you can see all kinds of 

155
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,910
little human experiments going on in 
various communities in Sparta.

156
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,480
It's whether or not the culture can 
infuse a certain fighting quality too.

157
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:22,860
It's human beings.
If they grow up a certain way,

158
00:10:22,861 --> 00:10:27,861
pressured by the culture in certain 
facets that just make them more likely 

159
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:32,430
to be extremely nasty.
In Combat Spartan Warrior Sparty,

160
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:35,100
it's do nothing but fighting.
There is no other job for them.

161
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:40,430
The entire culture seems to be designed 
from much of what we know now to 

162
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:44,961
reinforce this,
including a code of laws and behavior 

163
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:49,520
that tended to make these spartans 
enough alike so that laconic became a 

164
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,820
term that described.
You know,

165
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:55,821
most of them,
they're not a lot of chatty spartans in 

166
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:55,821
history.
The culture didn't encourage that.

167
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,710
Listened to the color though.
That's come down from this story.

168
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:04,490
The great kings,
xerxes with his army reported to be a 

169
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,930
million men so large that it drinks.
The river is dry that it passes through,

170
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,250
comes to this road with this past that 
has to be crossed,

171
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:15,570
and these small group of Greek hoplites 
guarding it and xerxes,

172
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,080
according to Hurghada tests,
doesn't know what to do,

173
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,690
can't quite believe what he seeing.

174
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,860
Look at the color in the story.
According to Hurghada,

175
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:32,740
xerxes sends a spy to go up to the 
spartan lines and try to figure out 

176
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,210
what's going on and not get caught.
Not only does he not get caught,

177
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:41,211
but according to Herat at this,
he reports back to xerxes and says that 

178
00:11:41,211 --> 00:11:41,340
the Spartan warriors couldn't have cared
less,

179
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:43,260
that he was there.
They were fine with him looking around.

180
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:48,261
They didn't care.
He said they were doing exercises and 

181
00:11:48,261 --> 00:11:48,600
combing their hair.
Again,

182
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:53,601
you have to imagine clint eastwood with 
long hair and a beard right there.

183
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:54,100
That'd

184
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,940
be worth the price of admission right 
with his tall sinewy guy,

185
00:11:57,941 --> 00:12:01,150
not a big muscle bound guy doing 
bodyweight exercises.

186
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,440
You know,
calisthenics,

187
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,820
pushups,
sit ups,

188
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:09,660
gymnastics.
That's how they prepped and the combing 

189
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,980
the long hair was a spartan thing.
XERXES could not get his mind around.

190
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,860
Hurghada is basically says the idea that
these people,

191
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,950
a couple hundred of them,
we're going to try to take on his 

192
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,040
reportedly million man army,
so he calls in an advisor that he has.

193
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,610
He's got a spartan king with him,
a guy who fell out of favor and he 

194
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,901
hooked up with the Persians,
thinking that if they conquer all the 

195
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:30,901
grease,
it might be good for him.

196
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:33,700
He's been the advisor to the great king 
of kings up till now.

197
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:38,470
He had told the king earlier about these
people and they'd made fun of him,

198
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:42,340
so now xerxes called him back to report 
on what the spy had said.

199
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,360
The spartans were doing.
I'll let hirata tests.

200
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,710
This ancient screenwriter handled the 
story from their writing.

201
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:55,030
Twenty 500 years ago,
quote xerxes listened,

202
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:00,060
but could not understand that the lack 
of Simonian's we're really preparing to 

203
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,430
kill or be killed to fight as much as 
was in their power,

204
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,270
seemed to him to be the height of folly,
the action of fools.

205
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,010
So he sent for Dme,
Maritou,

206
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:12,790
son of aristotle who was in the camp and
when to meritus arrived.

207
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,490
Xerxes questioned him about everything 
he had been told,

208
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,700
trying to understand the meaning behind 
what the lack of Simonian's we're doing 

209
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,510
to tomorrow answered.
You heard what I said about these men 

210
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,081
before when we were just setting out 
against the Greeks and you made me a 

211
00:13:28,081 --> 00:13:30,430
laughing stock when you heard my view of
how these matters would turn out,

212
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,910
but it is my greatest goal to tell the 
truth in your presence,

213
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,110
so hear me now.

214
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,290
Once again,
these men have come to fight for control

215
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,890
of the road and that is really what they
are preparing to do for it.

216
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:46,891
Is there a tradition that they groom 
their hair whenever they are about to 

217
00:13:46,891 --> 00:13:47,110
put their lives in danger?
Now know this,

218
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,250
if you subjugate these men and those who
have remained behind in Sparta,

219
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:56,430
there is no other race of human beings 
that will be left to raise their hands 

220
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,040
against you.
For you are now attacking the most noble

221
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,560
kingdom of all the Greeks and the best 
of men.

222
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,600
What to Maritou said Hirata test rights 
seemed quite incredible.

223
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:09,601
Dessert sees and he asked for a second 
time how they could possibly intend to 

224
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:12,820
fight his whole army since there were so
few of them to Mera toast,

225
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:14,290
replied,
sire.

226
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,420
If things do not turn out,
just as I claim,

227
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:21,421
they will treat me like a liar and to 
quote to lie to the great king of kings,

228
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,180
of the acumen,
Persian empire was a capital crime.

229
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:33,690
He was basically saying,
if this doesn't turn out exactly like I 

230
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:33,690
told you,
it will.

231
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,790
You can kill me.
That's pretty darn colorful right there,

232
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,680
but it gets even better.

233
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:46,520
The Great King of the Persians were 
supposed to send a messenger to the 

234
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,420
spartan lines to King Leona and say,
basically,

235
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:51,030
join us.
We'll make you the overlords.

236
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:56,110
Greece,
you'll have more than you ever had 

237
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,110
before.
A lot of nations had done that.

238
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,840
Joining the Persian empire was not a bad
idea.

239
00:14:56,841 --> 00:14:59,120
Sometimes he's basically saying,
we can make a deal here.

240
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:01,520
It'll be worth your while.
His father dairy,

241
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:04,370
this was a great deal maker in the 
xerxes,

242
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:09,371
was coming from a position of 
negotiation here and the spartans 

243
00:15:09,371 --> 00:15:12,560
basically dressed him down morally 
saying something to the effect of,

244
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:14,210
you know,
you have all this land already,

245
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:19,211
but you need to bother us.
We'd rather die for Greece than own 

246
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:19,400
anything.
It was one of those wonderful spartan,

247
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:20,660
moralistic,
putdowns.

248
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,710
Again,
spoken with as few words as possible and

249
00:15:25,711 --> 00:15:29,790
then famously as recorded by plutarch's 
600 years after the event,

250
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,880
surrogacy sends another messenger to the
Spartan lines,

251
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:37,940
supposedly another message for the king 
of the spartans and says to all the men 

252
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,830
who can hear them,
you can all go home,

253
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:46,540
all will be forgiven.
Just put down your arms and then you get

254
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:51,541
the wonderful phrase,
Milan of a translated in many different 

255
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:54,730
ways,
but it just is good.

256
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,490
Pretty much any of them come and take 
them.

257
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,970
Lay down your arms,
come and take them.

258
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Come and get them having come take.
You can take them when we're all dead.

259
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,360
A lot of the different ways,
the difficult to translate.

260
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,610
Greek is used.
It's still,

261
00:16:12,611 --> 00:16:15,460
by the way,
the motto of the Greek First Army Corps,

262
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,940
it's been used for many causes all 
throughout history cause it's such a 

263
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,190
great,
dramatic,

264
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,980
colorful spit in the face of death line,
isn't it?

265
00:16:23,981 --> 00:16:27,250
It's a clint eastwood line.
Do you feel lucky?

266
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:32,251
Punk come and take them.
How do you not stand up in the theater 

267
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:34,710
and cheer when that moment hits?
That's every screenwriter,

268
00:16:34,711 --> 00:16:37,390
his dream to have a scenario like that 
and if it can be true,

269
00:16:37,391 --> 00:16:42,391
how wonderful is that?
The Greek chroniclers who wrote about 

270
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:46,240
this stuff did not skimp on the drama 
and it makes it colorful.

271
00:16:46,241 --> 00:16:49,000
It makes it real,
it makes it compelling even 2,500

272
00:16:49,001 --> 00:16:54,001
years later and you give your right arm 
to have this kind of stuff right out of 

273
00:16:54,761 --> 00:16:59,761
the mouths of the oral historians from 
all these places that didn't have them 

274
00:16:59,761 --> 00:17:03,940
and look black and white because of it.
The Persian story must be magical.

275
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:08,941
Also,
we don't have that story and 

276
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:10,540
traditionally it's difficult for us to 
imagine that.

277
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:15,541
We'd like to hear from a pro perspective
the story of Darth vader and the empire,

278
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,480
but throughout history they weren't 
always darth vader and some of the 

279
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,380
greatest chroniclers of all time have 
gone to great lengths to show in fact 

280
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:29,860
that they may have been on God's side,
if you will.

281
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,660
If that turns out to be the case,
who's side are you rooting for them?

282
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,420
Of course in this time period,
the Iron Age,

283
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,860
ancient world and in this area,
the Mediterranean and the Near East,

284
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,160
you'd have to be a heck of a lot more 
specific when you start talking about 

285
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,551
dvds to just say God.
The likely response during that era 

286
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:57,831
might've been which God.
It was a wild and crazy time for 

287
00:17:58,231 --> 00:18:03,231
religion in that part of the world and 
they had a lot of different ones and 

288
00:18:03,231 --> 00:18:06,021
they ran the gamut from things you might
understand today too wild and crazy and 

289
00:18:06,021 --> 00:18:10,971
everything in between.
Most of these religious beliefs had a 

290
00:18:10,971 --> 00:18:12,240
pantheon of gods,
a bunch of them.

291
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,180
Some of them had a sort of a dominant 
leave God,

292
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:16,290
but,
but having,

293
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,600
you know,
multiple gods was normal.

294
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,010
There were groups,
especially one known for only having one

295
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:28,011
God and they were the ones that put 
together with divine or without divine 

296
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:31,860
help.
Take your pick a tome,

297
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:37,730
a combination of catalog of events and 
stories and accounts and perspectives 

298
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,400
and admonitions and hymns,
and it's hard to describe exactly what 

299
00:18:47,131 --> 00:18:48,600
the old Hebrew Bible is.

300
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,090
It's also hard to know when it was 
written,

301
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:56,160
are the accounts from the period around 
the time the Persians first appeared on 

302
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,931
the scene legitimate from that period.
Most Biblical experts think they were 

303
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,650
written later.
Nonetheless,

304
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,860
we use plutonic 500 years after the 
fact,

305
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:09,861
and so does everyone else.
So when the old Hebrew Bible in multiple

306
00:19:10,861 --> 00:19:15,861
places talks about the Persians,
we should probably at least note the 

307
00:19:15,861 --> 00:19:18,060
attitude and the attitude that the 
writers,

308
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,270
whomever they may have been of those 
works had toward the Persians,

309
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:23,730
especially early on,
wasn't just positive.

310
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:27,870
It was divine,
meany,

311
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,370
meany,
technical.

312
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:34,430
You farson number number,
weight divisions.

313
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,960
That's my favorite part of the Bible.
The Old Hebrew Bible,

314
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,210
which is so full of wonderful stuff.
You know,

315
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,850
the Greeks don't have the market totally
cornered on color.

316
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:50,330
There's just not a ton of stuff from the
parts of the world during the time 

317
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,680
period represented by the Bible,
but remember there's a lot of discussion

318
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:55,350
over when various pieces of the Bible 
were written.

319
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,400
A lot of this good stuff might've been 
written in well into the pros periods.

320
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:04,401
So we've entered into the color era 
because there's so much color on the 

321
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:06,480
book of Daniel has this scary story,
spooky story.

322
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:08,940
It's not like a horror movie,
but it's a spooky movie.

323
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:12,660
And today you'd have to have a little 
CGI helped to make it work.

324
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:17,661
But it's my favorite scene.
It's out of the book of Daniel and it 

325
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:19,950
involves a ghostly hand writing words on
a wall,

326
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,810
meany,
meany tackle.

327
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:26,930
You farson.
And you have to back up a little bit in 

328
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,440
the story to set the scene.
But the king of Babylon,

329
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,550
who the Bible Calls Belshazzar is having
a party,

330
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,590
he and his buddies and some concubines.
That's the way the Bible puts it.

331
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,840
Probably have to imagine some loud 
music.

332
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,130
Um,
you know,

333
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,300
and there's,
there's booze.

334
00:20:42,301 --> 00:20:47,301
I mean,
they're drinking and at a certain point 

335
00:20:47,301 --> 00:20:49,760
the king of Babylon wants to really nice
silver were brought in and the big cups 

336
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:54,810
of gold and silver,
the ones they took from Jerusalem when 

337
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,470
they sacked the capital of Judah not 
that long ago,

338
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:58,210
because that's what the Babylonians had 
done,

339
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,300
scattered a bunch of Jews everywhere,
forced a lot of the premier families and

340
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:09,301
craftsmen and artisans to deport all the
way back to Babylon and destroyed 

341
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:13,090
Solomon's temple when it comes to pr.

342
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,360
This belshazzar guy and the Babylonians 
are not getting a ton of it positive 

343
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,800
from the Bible.
And while he's drinking out of his big,

344
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,570
you know,
alluded cup,

345
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,600
hanging out with the concubines,
all of a sudden the ghostly hand with a 

346
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,191
finger appears right under the lamp and 
it starts writing on a wall,

347
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,080
meany,
meany tackle.

348
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:37,840
You farson.
And everybody freaks out.

349
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,800
My King James version of the Bible makes
it sound like he essentially couldn't 

350
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,700
control his bowels.
He was so scared.

351
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:46,770
My,
uh,

352
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:51,810
later,
more colloquial version just sticks to 

353
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,960
the knees shaking version.
Nonetheless,

354
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:57,250
he couldn't figure out what it meant.
So the Bible says,

355
00:21:57,251 --> 00:22:02,251
this Babylonian leader called in all his
sorcerers and necromancers and 

356
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:05,320
astrologers.
All these people you know,

357
00:22:05,321 --> 00:22:10,321
the wizards that advised you know the 
high Babylonian King and part of what 

358
00:22:10,321 --> 00:22:14,470
makes Babylonian so fricking wonderful 
is there a combination of like rational,

359
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:15,400
logical,
hard,

360
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:20,401
observational science and mathematics 
and all these kinds of things with 

361
00:22:20,401 --> 00:22:20,710
divination.

362
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,280
You have to imagine a Stephen Hawking 
type character,

363
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,420
but a [inaudible] board is an integral 
part of how he goes about his business.

364
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,490
It's fascinating,
but none of these people,

365
00:22:30,491 --> 00:22:35,491
the Bible says,
can explain to Belshazzar what the 

366
00:22:35,491 --> 00:22:38,191
writing means.
And then someone reminds him that his 

367
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:41,131
father used this guy,
this depor tea from Judah after the 

368
00:22:41,131 --> 00:22:46,081
Babylonians had destroyed Jerusalem 
there and he was here in Babylon and we 

369
00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:47,950
could bring them in and see if he knows 
what the ghostly writing means.

370
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:50,230
And belshazzar grabbed the guy and 
brought him in,

371
00:22:50,231 --> 00:22:53,830
and it was Daniel who was indeed a 
deportee.

372
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:59,250
And Belshazzar,
our gives him the same offer he gave to 

373
00:22:59,250 --> 00:22:59,250
his soothsayers.
Listen,

374
00:22:59,250 --> 00:22:59,360
you tell me what this means and you 
know,

375
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,810
gold chains and you'll rule a third of 
the kingdom.

376
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:03,280
And all this kind of stuff,
and Daniel says,

377
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,430
you keep your gifts or give them to 
somebody else.

378
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:11,430
I'll tell you what the writing means.
I have a lot of different versions of 

379
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:11,830
the Bible,
the Torah.

380
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:15,160
All these things in front of me and all 
the versions are good,

381
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:17,610
but the King James Bible with it's you 
know,

382
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:21,430
wrath of God style,
no sums it up perfectly.

383
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,790
Daniel looks at the meany,
meany,

384
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:29,200
teco you Farson and describes the words 
is meaning number number,

385
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:34,201
weight divisions,
and then defines that as meaning this 

386
00:23:34,201 --> 00:23:38,200
from the King James version quote,
this is the interpretation of the thing.

387
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,260
God has numbered thy Kingdom and 
finished it.

388
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:46,700
Now art weighed in the balances and 
found wanting thy kingdom is divided and

389
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:51,701
given to the medes and the Persians and 
quote that pretty colorful stuff,

390
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,860
isn't it?
And in that version,

391
00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:00,190
the king of the Persians,
a guy named Darrius conquers Babylon 

392
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,460
that knife and kills Belshazzar.
Well,

393
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,190
none of that's true,
but that's how the Bible story goes.

394
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:10,270
Nonetheless,
it's clear from that perspective that 

395
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,170
the Persians in this story are not going
to be the bad guys.

396
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:15,680
They're going to be the instrument of 
God that rectifies things.

397
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:21,820
If God is on any one side in that story,
he's on the side of the medes and the 

398
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:26,081
Persians.
Who the heck are these medes and 

399
00:24:26,081 --> 00:24:27,080
Persians,
and if they're so good in this story,

400
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:32,090
during the time of the Babylonians,
how do they go from that to the evil,

401
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:33,140
the Greek?
See,

402
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,390
you know,
two or three rulers later.

403
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,010
Well,
let's remember,

404
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:41,540
darth vader wasn't always evil,
and in fact,

405
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:47,380
the guy who will kick off the Persians 
first real appearance on the world stage

406
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,540
will be a guy that is so beloved by at 
least the Hebrew God.

407
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:58,790
He will be the only non Jew ever 
proclaimed a messiah.

408
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:05,650
The person who will get this honor is 
known in your history books by the name 

409
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,000
of Cyrus,
the second or cyrus the great.

410
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:13,750
If you wanted to make it sound a little 
bit more like it probably sounded in 

411
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:13,750
Persian,
you would say,

412
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:17,480
cool rush.
He's probably the greatest conqueror in 

413
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,280
world history.
Up until the time of Alexander,

414
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:24,200
he's got some of the best historical 
press anybody's likely to get.

415
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,900
Nobody has a bad word to say about the 
guy,

416
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:33,070
even the Greeks like him xenophon,
we'll write a whole book essentially 

417
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:37,091
romanticizing Cyrus's,
the greatest perfect world leader in 

418
00:25:37,091 --> 00:25:40,301
wind.
You like to be like him and here's how 

419
00:25:40,301 --> 00:25:40,301
you could emulate what he did and that 
Kinda thing.

420
00:25:40,301 --> 00:25:45,010
Cyrus becomes part of a Greek motif that
western tradition will continue for a 

421
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:49,811
long time that portrays the east as 
decadent and soft and corrupt,

422
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:55,340
but then how do you explain how some of 
these great empires got started?

423
00:25:55,341 --> 00:26:00,341
Well,
the way the Greeks do it is Cyrus's 

424
00:26:00,341 --> 00:26:02,321
fantastic,
and he builds up this entire thing and 

425
00:26:02,321 --> 00:26:05,561
bequeathed it to the Persians who 
proceeded to become soft and rich and 

426
00:26:05,561 --> 00:26:07,400
lazy and decadent and ruined what the 
great cyrus gave them.

427
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,980
So even the Greeks portray,
Cyrus has this great figure,

428
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:15,580
and yet we know so little about the guy.
If you contrast what we know about him 

429
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,080
and the guy who probably takes the crown
from him,

430
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:20,450
his greatest conqueror in the world up 
to that point,

431
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,790
Alexander the Great.
It's night and day.

432
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,960
Alexander the great exists in a fully 
colorized historical world.

433
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,440
A post hirata tests world,
a world where Alexander will bring his 

434
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,341
own publicists with him from place to 
place so they can record his latest 

435
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:40,130
deeds and sayings and doings.
Cyrus the great founds,

436
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,130
the last great empire and maybe what 
could call the black

437
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:49,130
and white era in the Near East,
an era where we know the majority of the

438
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:55,790
people back then because of things like 
monoliths and statues and reliefs and 

439
00:26:56,311 --> 00:27:00,630
carvings and tune paintings and 
architecture and ruins.

440
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,800
When you do have writing,
you get business records and 

441
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,471
proclamations and transactions.
Some of the best stuff you get from this

442
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:14,811
era are the correspondence is the 
letters between diplomats and governors 

443
00:27:14,811 --> 00:27:19,041
and rulers,
but what none of those people are doing 

444
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:20,910
is writing to amuse or entertain 
anybody.

445
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:25,970
All of the writing from the black and 
white period of human history is colder.

446
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:31,140
They all have a purpose beyond being 
entertaining.

447
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,740
It might be a religious purpose of 
business purpose at governmental purpose

448
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:40,040
or even two important officials writing 
each other about in a matters of state 

449
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,241
and a few personal things creep in.
That's very different than writing 

450
00:27:44,241 --> 00:27:47,571
something to be performed in front of a 
live audience for their entertainment 

451
00:27:47,571 --> 00:27:47,790
and enjoyment.

452
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:54,770
I read something historian Michael Grant
had written about Hurghada tests 

453
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:58,340
suggesting that the reason hirata test 
has the interesting structure that he 

454
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,911
does to his histories is because it was 
not meant to be read as much as it was 

455
00:28:01,911 --> 00:28:02,370
meant to be performed.
Live,

456
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:07,530
ran allowed by Hirata test himself and 
that the digressions and the tangents in

457
00:28:07,531 --> 00:28:12,531
the work represent things that would 
have worked much better in a live 

458
00:28:12,531 --> 00:28:13,560
situation with somebody broadcasting,
if you will,

459
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:18,720
an oratory as opposed to you somebody 
writing something to be read by somebody

460
00:28:18,721 --> 00:28:23,721
else remotely.
If that's the case and you don't really 

461
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:27,921
have the first written prose history 
with Hurghada tissue of the script for 

462
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:28,860
Hurghada does his live show,
if you will,

463
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:34,370
which would explain a lot considering 
that if you want to get drama and color 

464
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:37,851
and stories before the period of Herat 
at is you're looking at things like the 

465
00:28:37,851 --> 00:28:41,790
Iliad by homer or the epic of Gilgamesh 
from Mesopotamian history.

466
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:46,790
Both of which are believed by the way to
have been stories told for hundreds of 

467
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,180
years that we're finally compiled and 
written down.

468
00:28:48,181 --> 00:28:52,570
Same thing with like a beowulf in 
Scandinavian history may be Hurghada.

469
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:57,180
This is more like the ancient 
storytellers than first meets the eye to

470
00:28:57,181 --> 00:29:00,240
give him some credit.
Heraclitus was trying to be a chronicler

471
00:29:00,241 --> 00:29:05,241
at the same time that he was trying to 
do the same thing I was told to do in 

472
00:29:05,241 --> 00:29:07,981
news reporting to relate the facts as 
best as he understood them in the most 

473
00:29:07,981 --> 00:29:12,171
compelling way he could.
So what you have here in this ancient 

474
00:29:12,481 --> 00:29:15,570
story is not so much myth that wouldn't 
be fair,

475
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:18,480
not just to people like Hurghada.
Despite all of the great historians over

476
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:22,590
time who have found all these records 
and put together like a jigsaw puzzle,

477
00:29:22,591 --> 00:29:27,591
a,
a viewing of the past that is always 

478
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:30,501
being redone and improved,
but wouldn't have even existed there if 

479
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:31,230
a ton of different pieces of the puzzle 
hadn't been brought together.

480
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,840
But at the same time,
while it's not myth,

481
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,760
not exactly true either.

482
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,590
There are historians who've spent their 
whole lives trying to separate the truth

483
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:46,620
from the fiction in works like 
Heraclitus actually laughed out loud 

484
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:50,881
when I read [inaudible] book from Cyrus 
to Alexander Brown is one of the great 

485
00:29:50,881 --> 00:29:54,610
historians of Ancient Persia.
And this book is like the encyclopedia.

486
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,110
I mean,
it's very detailed,

487
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:58,420
very specific.
It's 1200 pages.

488
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:03,421
It's a,
it's an enormous comprehensive book and 

489
00:30:03,421 --> 00:30:06,901
the very first lines in it are as part 
of the opening page where he quotes an 

490
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,010
artist,
um,

491
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,100
who says quote,
and even if it is not true,

492
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,790
you need to believe in ancient history 
and quote,

493
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:21,750
does anything better set up the 
dichotomy here and how wonderful that in

494
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:25,930
a 1200 page book that is exhaustive as 
all get out,

495
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:28,660
the very first line from the historian 
is yeah,

496
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:30,490
it might not be true,
but you have to believe it anyway.

497
00:30:30,491 --> 00:30:30,840
It's,
it's,

498
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,630
it's wonderful.

499
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:36,630
And it sums up the problem with ancient 
history and that is that you have the 

500
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,570
feeling that most of what you're reading
here is the truth.

501
00:30:37,571 --> 00:30:42,571
And these events did happen,
but there's a lot of fiction mixed in 

502
00:30:42,571 --> 00:30:45,901
and it's difficult to know what's what,
and it's difficult to separate one from 

503
00:30:45,901 --> 00:30:49,621
the other.
It's also difficult to know where to 

504
00:30:49,621 --> 00:30:52,771
begin the story.
This is a classic problem anybody has 

505
00:30:52,771 --> 00:30:52,771
trying to explain something,
right?

506
00:30:52,771 --> 00:30:54,040
How do you begin a story of Cyrus the 
second and the Persians?

507
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:57,610
When does that start?
All histories connected as we know,

508
00:30:57,611 --> 00:31:02,611
right?
It's all a bunch of tumbling dominoes 

509
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,510
and one event and series of events leads
up to other ones and sets it all up.

510
00:31:04,511 --> 00:31:08,320
Where's the logical starting point?
I'm terrible at this by the way.

511
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:13,710
I did a whole series on the decline and 
fall of the Roman republic hours and 

512
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:17,010
hours and hours because I was trying to 
find the logical place to start a story 

513
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,711
about Cleopatra never even got 
practically to Cleopatra was all 

514
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:24,300
dominoes before.
Then Iran test starts with the earliest 

515
00:31:25,521 --> 00:31:27,320
thing.
He knows about it and it's a miracle.

516
00:31:27,321 --> 00:31:32,321
He knows about it at all.
He begins by talking about the 

517
00:31:32,321 --> 00:31:32,321
Assyrians.

518
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,950
He also talks about having multiple 
versions of this story,

519
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:38,290
so Hurghada is being harassed at this.
He says,

520
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:39,880
listen,
I've heard a lot of different things.

521
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,790
Here are my sources.
The story begins,

522
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:44,350
boom,
and here's what he writes.

523
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:50,190
Quote from here,
our story demands that we inquire 

524
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,641
further about Cyrus and the Persians,
who was this man who destroyed the 

525
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:56,530
empire of creases and how did the 
Persians become the leaders of Asia?

526
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:01,830
I shall write this account using as my 
sources certain Persians who do not 

527
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:05,080
intend to magnify the deeds of Cyrus,
but rather to tell what really happened.

528
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:10,230
Although I know of three other ways in 
which the story of Cyrus is told and 

529
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:14,330
quote,
and then he begins the story using a 

530
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,771
phrase that should probably be proceeded
by a line like once upon a time quote.

531
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:23,550
The Assyrians ruled inland Asia for 520 
years and the needs were the first to 

532
00:32:24,371 --> 00:32:25,390
revolt from them.

533
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,750
It would seem that they proved 
themselves to be truly courageous men by

534
00:32:28,751 --> 00:32:33,751
fighting the Assyrians for the cause of 
freedom and they succeeded in casting 

535
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,440
off slavery and we're liberated 
afterwards.

536
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,980
The other ethnic groups freed themselves
as the medes had done and quote,

537
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,430
well,
the medes need a little explaining,

538
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:48,970
just like at the biblical story of 
Belshazzar is feast when he said that 

539
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,180
the empire is going to be divided 
between the medes and the Persians.

540
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,180
The medes and the Persians are a related
people.

541
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:55,820
The Greeks used the terms 
interchangeably.

542
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,000
They were,
you know,

543
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,350
practically like brothers in the eyes of
the Greeks when I was growing up,

544
00:33:00,351 --> 00:33:05,351
they were just starting to change from 
the brothers sort of interpretation and 

545
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:05,351
may be saying,
oh,

546
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:09,620
maybe they were more like first cousins.
Some of the more recent histories I've 

547
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,691
been reading.
Maybe you could say we downgrade the 

548
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:15,761
relationship even a step further to 
something like second cousins who 

549
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:15,761
fought.

550
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:19,570
Sometimes historians differ on when 
these related people's arrived in the 

551
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:23,990
area where they can now play a role in 
the history of this,

552
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:27,040
you know,
enclosed sort of geopolitical world with

553
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,330
Egypt and Babylon in the Syria and all 
these places.

554
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:35,110
There's even a few historians who think 
they may have always been there and you 

555
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:35,720
just didn't hear about them.
Nevertheless,

556
00:33:35,721 --> 00:33:40,640
the world upon which they have intruded 
is so old.

557
00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:44,420
It's hard for modern people to get our 
minds around because it's hard for us to

558
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:46,760
imagine something 2,500
years ago.

559
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,890
You know when thermopylae is happening.
Now,

560
00:33:48,891 --> 00:33:53,180
imagine something from 2,500
years before that.

561
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:57,320
That's how old this world is.
I love the way in the 19 forties,

562
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:02,740
historian 80 olmsted tried to give the 
reader a sense of how old this world was

563
00:34:03,351 --> 00:34:06,380
and how the people who lived in it new 
it was old.

564
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:10,730
He starts by talking about Cyrus.
The second are Cyrus,

565
00:34:10,731 --> 00:34:12,890
the great person after he takes over 
Babylon,

566
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,550
trying to describe how old the world is 
that Babylon represents,

567
00:34:16,551 --> 00:34:17,270
and he says,
quote,

568
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:21,910
when Cyrus entered Babylon in 5:39
bce,

569
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,620
the world was old,
more significant.

570
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:29,770
The world knew its antiquity.
It scholars had compiled long dynastic 

571
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:34,451
lists and simple addition appeared to 
prove that kings whose monuments were 

572
00:34:34,451 --> 00:34:37,790
still visible had ruled more than for 
millenniums before,

573
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:41,390
yet earlier were other monarchs,
sons of Gods,

574
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:46,450
and sold themselves.
Demi gods who's rains covered several 

575
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:47,780
generations of present day short lived 
men.

576
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:53,050
Even these were proceeded,
the Egyptians believed by the gods 

577
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:56,711
themselves who held sway through long,
eons before the universal flood.

578
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:01,730
The Babylonians placed 10 kings,
the least of whom ruled 18,000,

579
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:05,000
600 years,
the greatest 43,200

580
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:06,590
years.
Other peoples,

581
00:35:06,591 --> 00:35:09,920
he writes new this flood and told of 
monarchs,

582
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:14,810
Nanacast Odium for example,
who reigned in predelivery in times,

583
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:17,120
meaning you know the times before the 
biblical flood.

584
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,950
He continues the sacred history of the 
Jews extended through 4,000

585
00:35:21,951 --> 00:35:23,420
years,
modest,

586
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:27,110
as were their fingers when compared with
those of Babylon or Egypt.

587
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,920
They recorded that one.
Predelivery and patriarch almost reached

588
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:35,921
the millennium mark before his death.
Greek poets chanted a legendary history 

589
00:35:35,921 --> 00:35:40,900
which was counted backwards to the time 
when the genealogies of the heroes 

590
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,740
ascended to the God.
Each people and nation,

591
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:48,860
each former city,
state boasted of its own creation story 

592
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,630
with its own local God is creator and to
quote,

593
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:58,250
he then goes onto diagram that in the 
600 and 700 bce,

594
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,640
there were quite a few rulers in quite a
few of these old countries that became 

595
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,121
archeological buffs where they would go 
back and pay for the excavation of 

596
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:11,501
earlier rulers that ruled a thousand,
1500 years before them and in Egypt may 

597
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:17,771
have dressed similarly.
That's the continuity of the Egyptian 

598
00:36:17,771 --> 00:36:17,840
fashion.
Look,

599
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:23,860
my favorite story that really gives you 
an idea of the antiquity of things and 

600
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,950
how the peoples of this region 
understood it,

601
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:28,130
knew it in a way that you don't normally
think about,

602
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:33,580
has to do with an archeological 
excavation that happened in the late 18 

603
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:37,001
hundreds,
early 19 hundreds in modern day Iran in 

604
00:36:37,001 --> 00:36:38,900
a city through much of the historical 
period that was called Sousa.

605
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,620
Sousa is a very old city,
ancient city.

606
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,020
It will be important in the Persian 
period.

607
00:36:45,021 --> 00:36:50,021
It will be important.
After that period for a very long time 

608
00:36:50,021 --> 00:36:53,121
of people called the elamites resided in
Sousa and he was in a strata were the 

609
00:36:55,490 --> 00:37:00,490
Eland Mike period,
was that these archeologists began to 

610
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,981
uncover some of the greatest treasures 
and antiquities in near eastern history 

611
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:06,380
and they didn't belong there.
They found,

612
00:37:06,381 --> 00:37:11,381
for example,
the famous steel or steely take your 

613
00:37:11,381 --> 00:37:13,880
pick of Hammurabi,
something that is huge.

614
00:37:13,881 --> 00:37:16,970
I mean it's a giant seven foot tall or 
something heavy,

615
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:20,300
big thing,
and they find it there.

616
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:23,750
What's it doing there?
That should be in Babylon.

617
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,080
Now,
if you think this deal of Hama Hammurabi

618
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:33,140
is old circus,
17 hundreds bc or something like that,

619
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:38,520
archaeologists then find something 
that's a good deal older than that.

620
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:44,120
It's called the victory steel of sin.
He was an Acadian King from the 22 

621
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:46,800
hundreds BC.
He,

622
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,720
so by the time they were making the 
steel of Hammurabi,

623
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:54,840
the victory steel of Naropa sin was half
a millennia old.

624
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:59,490
There were other antiquities that they 
found to all of them from elsewhere.

625
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,960
They were the spoils,
the loot,

626
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:09,670
the stuff that the Ila Mites took back 
with them when they sacked Babylon,

627
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,320
and in fact you could tell because 
somehow all this stuff was on display 

628
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:21,180
and below the original inscriptions in 
the original language explaining what 

629
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:25,731
this was,
was an eland might inscription 

630
00:38:25,731 --> 00:38:28,821
explaining when it was taken from the 
Babylonians as loot and spoils and as a 

631
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:32,700
piece of memorabilia commemorating a 
great victory.

632
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,960
I keep imagining a bunch of trophies in 
like a college or university or school 

633
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,330
trophy case,
you know,

634
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:44,980
commemorating the victories over the 
arrows over your school rivals the oaken

635
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:46,750
bucket,
the Apple Cup,

636
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,990
the steel of Hama,
Robbie,

637
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,350
you know,
that Kinda thing.

638
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,110
And by the way,
it wasn't just,

639
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:58,490
you know,
cultural artifacts that were taken in 

640
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:58,690
the famous elamite might invasion that 
happened in the 11 hundreds.

641
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,290
They took the god of Babylon with them.
They took,

642
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:07,291
Martin,
took with them the statue that 

643
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:09,421
represented the God.
And this is one of my favorite things 

644
00:39:09,421 --> 00:39:12,691
about ancient history is this idea 
sometimes that these statues that 

645
00:39:12,691 --> 00:39:14,290
represented the gods were somehow 
connected to the god,

646
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,380
him or herself.
And sometimes were,

647
00:39:17,381 --> 00:39:19,660
I mean there were some beliefs that they
were the gods,

648
00:39:19,661 --> 00:39:20,770
and so you'll see,
for example,

649
00:39:20,771 --> 00:39:23,590
the Assyrians in a lot of their stone 
reliefs,

650
00:39:23,591 --> 00:39:26,290
when they're showing the conquest of 
some civilization or city,

651
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:31,650
they've got the God that their soldiers 
are carrying away along with all of the 

652
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:31,650
loot.

653
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,480
And it's kind of symbolic when you think
about it.

654
00:39:34,481 --> 00:39:36,850
It's a sign our God is stronger than 
your God.

655
00:39:36,851 --> 00:39:38,860
After all,
we've got your God.

656
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,650
And in a lot of these near eastern 
civilizations,

657
00:39:41,651 --> 00:39:46,651
the historians wrote that you can't 
reestablish some of these cities until 

658
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:47,650
the god is returned.
So in other words,

659
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:50,140
when Babylon gets sacked and the god is 
taken away,

660
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:54,040
they can't do a big rebuilding thing 
until the God has brought back.

661
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,280
We got your God.
I mean,

662
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:59,830
talk about rubbing your nose in a defeat
there.

663
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:05,730
I mean,
I was trying to think about what the 

664
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,141
equivalent would be in the modern world.
Certainly if somebody took over the 

665
00:40:07,141 --> 00:40:07,630
United States,
if the elamites had done it,

666
00:40:07,631 --> 00:40:12,631
they would have the statue of Liberty in
their little museum there with a little 

667
00:40:12,631 --> 00:40:15,850
notation underneath taken from New York 
City after we crushed the Americans.

668
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,780
I love the elamites and would love to 
know more about them.

669
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,580
They're there.
One of those peoples that just not a lot

670
00:40:21,581 --> 00:40:26,581
is known.
What you can say for sure is that they 

671
00:40:26,581 --> 00:40:29,821
are the great long standing urban power 
in what's now modern day or ron for 

672
00:40:30,821 --> 00:40:34,660
thousands of years.
The big contemporaries and the big power

673
00:40:34,661 --> 00:40:39,661
from that region that rival the 
Babylon's and the Assyrians in the 

674
00:40:39,661 --> 00:40:43,231
Egypt's.
There's usually a power in the north to 

675
00:40:43,231 --> 00:40:43,231
north of Assyria,
but that changes.

676
00:40:43,231 --> 00:40:45,490
It could be Matatani,
it could be the hittites.

677
00:40:45,491 --> 00:40:46,630
It could be.
You are to.

678
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:52,050
Nonetheless,
you have a relatively stable geo 

679
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:52,900
political balance going on for a long 
time,

680
00:40:52,901 --> 00:40:57,901
even through the ups and downs,
and then that world begins to be 

681
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:03,630
consciously destroyed and that opens up 
the door to an instability where you 

682
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:10,630
know anything can happen and shocking 
things did.

683
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:16,620
It starts with the absolute skyrocketing
by historical standards of the military,

684
00:41:19,901 --> 00:41:21,700
dominance of the Assyrians.

685
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:27,780
Now you may be thinking,
we were just talking about the needs a 

686
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,221
minute ago and now we've shifted over to
the Assyrians and what does one have to 

687
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:33,211
do with the other,
but it's their paths crossing that sort 

688
00:41:33,211 --> 00:41:37,280
of up the stage for the next period.
In western Asian history,

689
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,210
the medes will turn out to be one of a 
couple of David's in this story,

690
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:46,211
who will take down Goliath in order to 
understand what a big deal that is.

691
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,990
You need to understand how big of a deal
Goliath was in this story.

692
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:55,991
The Assyrians are Goliath and they were 
transformed in the 700 bce from one of 

693
00:41:57,711 --> 00:42:02,711
the great power,
sometimes the greatest of the great 

694
00:42:02,711 --> 00:42:04,901
power,
sometimes not into the regional 

695
00:42:04,901 --> 00:42:08,141
superpower,
and as far as these people were 

696
00:42:08,141 --> 00:42:08,300
concerned,
the region was the entire world

697
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:14,650
and this quickly growing absolutely 
devastating new empire in terms of its 

698
00:42:15,921 --> 00:42:20,921
military abilities,
would have been the ones fighting the 

699
00:42:20,921 --> 00:42:24,491
Greeks and the spartans at their mop.
Ali had the medes and their allies not 

700
00:42:25,821 --> 00:42:28,370
been able to take down this Goliath,
and I got news for you.

701
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,800
I don't think the neo was Syrian.
Armies at their height would have beaten

702
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,710
Alexander the great and his Macedonians.
I'm not sure,

703
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:41,711
but I don't think,
but I think they crush the ancient 

704
00:42:41,711 --> 00:42:45,491
Greeks of Athens and Sparta,
and so maybe if the past that they're 

705
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:50,630
happily in the Greco.
Persian wars really was a war for 

706
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:53,381
Western civilization.
We should be thankful that there were 

707
00:42:53,381 --> 00:42:56,651
people like the needs to take down the 
people who I think would have been the 

708
00:42:56,651 --> 00:43:00,890
odds on favorite in any vegas betting 
pool to take down the ancient Greeks and

709
00:43:00,891 --> 00:43:02,290
for ADBC,
he.

710
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:05,990
They weren't around in for ADBC in part 
because of these people.

711
00:43:05,991 --> 00:43:10,991
The medes who in the seven hundreds when
the story really heats up and get 

712
00:43:10,991 --> 00:43:14,871
strange or a people on the periphery of 
the known universe at the time to the 

713
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:21,221
Assyrians.
The medes are sort of the eastern edge 

714
00:43:21,221 --> 00:43:24,971
of the known galaxy and beyond those 
muddy and tribes with all their petty 

715
00:43:24,971 --> 00:43:28,550
little kinglets are groups of half 
human,

716
00:43:28,551 --> 00:43:33,551
half monsters called the Lumen Monda in 
the Syrian animals,

717
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:38,711
the Human Monda by the way in old 
acadian term that means the horde from 

718
00:43:38,841 --> 00:43:43,841
who knows where and it's believed that 
this refers to the nomadic peoples of 

719
00:43:45,861 --> 00:43:50,861
the step,
the cultural forebears of the hands and 

720
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:52,280
the Turks and the Hmong goals and all 
those people.

721
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:56,300
In fact,
the medes and the Persians were supposed

722
00:43:56,301 --> 00:44:01,301
to be able to speak to the Human Monda 
without the use of translators.

723
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:07,370
How'd you like to be related enough to a
people known as the horde from who knows

724
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:12,080
where to be able to understand their 
language without anybody helping.

725
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:16,970
Nonetheless,
it's in this period right around 7:50

726
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:22,190
bce where you get a sort of an unusual 
happening in ancient history where a lot

727
00:44:22,611 --> 00:44:27,611
seems to happen in a relatively short 
period of time because in ancient 

728
00:44:27,611 --> 00:44:32,351
history you get these long stretches 
where it seems like very little changes 

729
00:44:32,351 --> 00:44:32,710
in 7:45
BC.

730
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:35,670
He,
with the arrival of a new Assyrian King,

731
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:38,100
a guy named Tim [inaudible],
the third,

732
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,540
uh,
Syria,

733
00:44:39,541 --> 00:44:44,541
begins to go on this sprint,
maybe you could call it a historical 

734
00:44:44,541 --> 00:44:47,250
sprint that will last until about six,
15,

735
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:48,810
six,
12 bcee,

736
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:54,740
and we'll be like,
maybe you could say the last burst of 

737
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:58,221
rocket fuel of that historical era of 
that ancient world about to give way to 

738
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:03,150
the era of the Greeks and classical 
antiquity and all that kind of stuff and

739
00:45:03,151 --> 00:45:05,700
rockets it to the heights where the 
Assyrian army,

740
00:45:05,701 --> 00:45:09,230
for example,
in say 700 BC,

741
00:45:09,231 --> 00:45:12,870
he or the equivalent of like the Roman 
empire,

742
00:45:12,871 --> 00:45:15,480
his armies at their height for their 
era.

743
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:21,590
The Assyrians will systematically smash 
the other great powers in that area and 

744
00:45:23,551 --> 00:45:25,740
it's difficult by the way.
They're powerful.

745
00:45:25,741 --> 00:45:27,840
They're sophisticated,
they have a lot of money.

746
00:45:27,841 --> 00:45:32,841
Some of these places,
the Assyrians often have to face not 

747
00:45:32,841 --> 00:45:35,460
single states,
but coalitions of states,

748
00:45:35,461 --> 00:45:39,990
big allies that allied simply to deal 
with the Assyrians and they lose most of

749
00:45:39,991 --> 00:45:40,980
the time.
Anyway.

750
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,070
I'll try not to geek out on the army too
much,

751
00:45:44,071 --> 00:45:49,071
but it's the gold standard for the era.
Richard Gabriel and Karen mets in their 

752
00:45:49,071 --> 00:45:53,100
book from sewer to Rome,
so to describe it in a nutshell in terms

753
00:45:53,101 --> 00:45:58,101
of just giving you a mental picture of 
the capabilities of an army from this 

754
00:45:58,101 --> 00:45:59,640
era,
you know the so called Biblical era when

755
00:45:59,641 --> 00:46:04,641
I was growing up,
they right quote the Assyrian Army of 

756
00:46:04,641 --> 00:46:07,710
the eighth century BC.
He was comprised of at least 150,000

757
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:12,750
to 200,000
men and was the largest standing 

758
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:13,560
military force that the Middle East had 
witnessed to this time,

759
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:18,060
and a Syrian combat field army numbered 
approximately 50,000

760
00:46:18,061 --> 00:46:23,061
men with various mixes of infantry 
chariots in cavalry in modern times the 

761
00:46:23,061 --> 00:46:24,360
size of an Assyrian field.

762
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:29,360
Army was equal to five modern heavy 
American divisions are almost eight 

763
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,280
Soviet field divisions.
When it rained for battle,

764
00:46:32,281 --> 00:46:37,281
the army took up an area of 2,500
yards across and a hundred yards deep.

765
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:42,590
The Assyrian army was also the first 
army to be entirely equipped with iron 

766
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:44,070
weapons and quote,
boy,

767
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,500
he doesn't that Soviet reference date 
me.

768
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,710
Nonetheless,
you get an idea that we're talking about

769
00:46:49,711 --> 00:46:54,711
armies that were exponentially larger 
than in the recent past in the bronze 

770
00:46:56,011 --> 00:46:56,610
age,
you know,

771
00:46:56,611 --> 00:47:01,611
narrow sin was putting like 6,000
guys into the field and thinking he had 

772
00:47:01,611 --> 00:47:04,200
a lot of men.
The Assyrians have multiple divisions of

773
00:47:04,201 --> 00:47:05,430
50,000
each.

774
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,180
They will smash the power of the 
mountain state of you.

775
00:47:10,181 --> 00:47:12,300
Rawr too.
At one point during this period,

776
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:17,330
that's where modern Armenia is.
They will several times have to deal 

777
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:20,880
with Babylon.
Another one of their great kings,

778
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,990
Senaca rib takes care of that and then 
they just have to do it again and again.

779
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:29,990
Babylon is the thorn in the side 
perpetually of the Syria and the 

780
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:33,990
elamites always get in trouble with the 
Assyrians because they always support 

781
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:36,781
the Babylonians because after all,
all of them would like to see the 

782
00:47:36,781 --> 00:47:40,021
Assyrians cut down to size.
Eventually the Assyrians will cut the 

783
00:47:40,021 --> 00:47:44,911
elamites down to size to one of the most
horrifying of all the Assyrian reliefs.

784
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:49,510
And you know there's a lot of them in 
historians.

785
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,600
Don't always know how to classify them.
You can't tell if you want to say that.

786
00:47:54,911 --> 00:47:57,160
These are real scenes that they're 
showing.

787
00:47:57,161 --> 00:48:00,040
When you see these carvings which were 
probably painted at one time,

788
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:03,640
and we're often displayed in the waiting
room before you got to see the king,

789
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:05,680
what are you looking at while you're 
cooling your heels,

790
00:48:05,681 --> 00:48:09,940
waiting to see the Assyrian King,
the things he did to the people like you

791
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,770
who may be turned against him.

792
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:17,490
Sometimes historians think that they're 
taking a sadistic sort of cruel love in 

793
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:22,081
this.
Sometimes it's meant to be terrifying 

794
00:48:22,081 --> 00:48:22,081
and they enjoy that Saddam Hussein 
style.

795
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:25,630
Sometimes they think of it as a 
convention in the same way the Egyptians

796
00:48:25,631 --> 00:48:27,270
always seem to show them,
you know,

797
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,780
wearing certain kinds of clothing,
whether or not they did anymore,

798
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:34,820
it was an artistic convention.
Showing people getting their heads 

799
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:34,820
lopped off is just,
you know,

800
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:37,240
if you go to a Syria,
you expect to see the Assyrian things,

801
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:39,540
that kind of deal.
That's who we are and it's.

802
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,920
It's a staple.
Nonetheless.

803
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,450
One of my favorite Assyrian reliefs 
shows the aftermath of the era where the

804
00:48:46,451 --> 00:48:51,130
Assyrians finally decided to deal with 
the ongoing Isla might problem.

805
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:56,730
It shows the Assyrian King Osher,
Bonnie Paul reclining on one of those 

806
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:58,410
wonderful oriental near eastern,
you know,

807
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:03,420
kinds of things that they used to lay 
down on like a couch where they would 

808
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,721
have somebody feed you grapes or 
something and he's sitting there 

809
00:49:06,721 --> 00:49:07,330
drinking wine or eating food in a 
luxury,

810
00:49:07,331 --> 00:49:11,140
really relaxing sort of pace in a garden
with palm trees,

811
00:49:11,141 --> 00:49:16,141
if I recall correctly,
and there's a woman there with him and 

812
00:49:16,141 --> 00:49:18,751
you get the feeling like he and that 
woman are together and then right over 

813
00:49:18,751 --> 00:49:22,471
near by,
up on the side of a wall or a post or a 

814
00:49:22,471 --> 00:49:23,530
pillar is a head.

815
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:29,940
The head of the Ila Mike King,
pickled or otherwise,

816
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,040
and that woman who you think maybe is 
osher bonded,

817
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:39,050
Paul's wife or maybe a royal concubine.
Some historians think is the wife of 

818
00:49:39,341 --> 00:49:44,341
that elamite.
She having to be there with the person 

819
00:49:44,341 --> 00:49:47,791
who killed him and have him looking on 
body list the whole time at the 

820
00:49:47,791 --> 00:49:51,670
Assyrians just had this wonderful 
historical reputation for something that

821
00:49:51,671 --> 00:49:54,610
once again is cinematic.
Now it's not color,

822
00:49:54,611 --> 00:49:56,110
it's not like Hurghada tests and all 
that.

823
00:49:56,111 --> 00:50:01,111
We don't have it in color,
but it's a really scary black and white 

824
00:50:01,111 --> 00:50:04,951
horror film.
If you're on the receiving end of a 

825
00:50:04,951 --> 00:50:06,400
series and violence,
I should point out that,

826
00:50:06,401 --> 00:50:11,401
you know,
focusing so much on geopolitics and the 

827
00:50:11,401 --> 00:50:11,401
Syrian foreign policy may,
you know,

828
00:50:11,401 --> 00:50:14,330
sort of colored the picture in a very 
negative way because to live in,

829
00:50:14,331 --> 00:50:17,110
in the Syrian city during this time 
period might've been awesome.

830
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:19,300
I might might've been the height of 
civilization,

831
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:20,110
you know,
it was,

832
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,630
it was a society that was in some 
respects,

833
00:50:22,631 --> 00:50:24,850
one of the most literate at all time 
periods.

834
00:50:24,851 --> 00:50:26,770
It was wealthy.
It was cultured.

835
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:28,790
Might have been great to live in the 
Siri.

836
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:31,080
You just didn't want to be on the wrong 
end of a,

837
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:35,270
of foreign policy.
And from about 7:45

838
00:50:35,271 --> 00:50:37,680
BC to about the,
you know,

839
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:41,780
early six hundreds.
A lot of people were and very few people

840
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:46,960
came away doing very well after that.
They systematically battered down the 

841
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,970
structures of this region.
Now battering down the structures of the

842
00:50:49,971 --> 00:50:51,530
region.
We're very important.

843
00:50:51,531 --> 00:50:56,531
If you wanted to kind of make it a 
mineable to being incorporated into a 

844
00:50:56,531 --> 00:51:00,530
single political entity like an empire.
Everybody's individualistic.

845
00:51:00,531 --> 00:51:05,531
Nature had to be curtailed somewhat.
The problem will come when the unifying 

846
00:51:05,541 --> 00:51:10,541
force that did this disappears to get an
idea by the way of how many peoples 

847
00:51:11,031 --> 00:51:16,031
we're talking about here and as a 
wonderful way to sort of contradict the 

848
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:19,460
earlier way the story was told,
which was focusing on people's ethnicity

849
00:51:19,461 --> 00:51:20,930
a lot and to say,
you know,

850
00:51:20,931 --> 00:51:24,470
the Assyrians were submitted and the 
Iranian people's,

851
00:51:24,471 --> 00:51:27,140
the medes and the Persians were Indo 
European,

852
00:51:27,141 --> 00:51:32,141
and all that is to realize when you deal
with a place that is so filled with 

853
00:51:32,481 --> 00:51:35,240
different ethnic groups,
intermarrying living together,

854
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,690
that it doesn't take very long for 
people's languages to change.

855
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:41,450
Which used to be the way we judged who 
was whom.

856
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:47,290
It also means that the job of any 
unifying force that wants to turn all 

857
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:51,671
these different freedom loving groups 
into a single political entity is huge.

858
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:54,840
Historian will durant tries to,
you know,

859
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:57,170
lay the foundation and and basically 
says,

860
00:51:57,171 --> 00:51:58,160
you know,
just so you know,

861
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:03,370
look at how many peoples there are in 
this part of the world and they're all 

862
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,521
interacting all the time and they're 
intermarrying and to me it's an ethnic 

863
00:52:06,521 --> 00:52:06,521
melting pot.
He says,

864
00:52:06,521 --> 00:52:09,650
quote,
do a distant and yet discerning eye.

865
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:13,670
The Near East in the days of 
Nebuchadrezzar would have seemed like an

866
00:52:13,671 --> 00:52:18,440
ocean in which vast swarms of human 
beings moved about in turmoil,

867
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:22,700
forming and dissolve in groups in 
slaving are being enslaved,

868
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:27,730
eating or being eaten,
killing or getting killed endlessly 

869
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:30,260
behind and around the great empires,
Egypt,

870
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:31,970
Babylonia,
Assyria,

871
00:52:31,971 --> 00:52:35,480
and Persia flowered this medley of half 
nomad.

00:52:40,641 --> 00:52:45,380
but Finian's Ash Caymanians Messinians 
me own Ian's carions,

874
00:52:45,381 --> 00:52:48,470
like Ian's pamphlet to presidions 
Lakini,

875
00:52:48,471 --> 00:52:51,080
Ian's Philistines,
Amorites Canaanites,

876
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:52,410
Eda,
Mites ammonites,

877
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,620
the Moabites,
and a hundred other peoples,

878
00:52:54,621 --> 00:52:57,530
each of which felt itself the center of 
geography and history.

879
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:02,680
And would have marveled at the ignorant 
prejudice of a historian who would 

880
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,281
reduce them to a paragraph and a quote.
I've got a bunch of historians who talk 

881
00:53:06,711 --> 00:53:11,711
about how difficult the task is to Meld 
all these individualistic different 

882
00:53:11,711 --> 00:53:15,140
peoples into a single political entity.
Chester star writing in the middle of 19

883
00:53:15,141 --> 00:53:17,060
sixties,
put it this way,

884
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:22,061
as he tries to sort of counterbalance 
this ruthless image the Assyrians have 

885
00:53:22,061 --> 00:53:23,660
with the job they're trying to do,
and he writes,

886
00:53:23,661 --> 00:53:28,661
quote,
this spirit perhaps proves not so much 

887
00:53:28,661 --> 00:53:29,900
that the Assyrians were in human 
monsters.

888
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:34,130
As it shows the sternness required to 
break and harness the Near East.

889
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,400
The Assyrian period was in reality,
one of the greatest turning points in 

890
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,851
the civilized history of the area,
and in this fact must be sought the 

891
00:53:42,851 --> 00:53:44,930
justification for the booty and the 
tribute of empire.

892
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:48,170
If Empire needs justification 
politically,

893
00:53:48,171 --> 00:53:53,171
such kings as tig left.
The third took decisive steps towards 

894
00:53:53,171 --> 00:53:55,640
uniting the Fertile Crescent.
The next grade empire,

895
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:00,260
the Persian reaped the benefit.
And so could afford to exercise its sway

896
00:54:00,261 --> 00:54:01,790
in a more lenient style.

897
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:07,480
And quote,
this is actually key to one of the 

898
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,231
things we've been talking about,
the fact that even though the Greeks 

899
00:54:10,231 --> 00:54:10,231
portrayed,
you know,

900
00:54:10,231 --> 00:54:14,430
the Persians as sort of darth vader and 
the empire history outside the Greeks 

901
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:18,250
knew them as a comparatively tolerant 
empire,

902
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:23,430
comparatively lenient,
who were they being compared to the 

903
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:27,460
Assyrians,
but it may have taken what the Assyrians

904
00:54:27,461 --> 00:54:32,461
did to make an empire that was docile 
enough for the Persians to treat them 

905
00:54:32,461 --> 00:54:37,411
that way and have it all work out.
I should also point out that there are 

906
00:54:37,881 --> 00:54:42,881
quite a few historians that would 
suggest that the Assyrians have another 

907
00:54:42,881 --> 00:54:47,441
legacy that we should potentially credit
them with a much more noble sounding 

908
00:54:48,081 --> 00:54:48,740
one.
By the way,

909
00:54:48,741 --> 00:54:53,741
despite the horrific marketing and the 
frightful branding of the Assyrians,

910
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:57,440
perhaps you might look at them during 
this time period,

911
00:54:57,441 --> 00:55:02,060
depending on your viewpoint.
In more of a captain America style role,

912
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,480
fending off the hordes of barbarism from
swamping the civilized world with their,

913
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,090
you know,
murder and robbery.

914
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,440
Because in the last years of the seven 
hundreds bce,

915
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:22,030
the Uhlmann Monda breakthrough.
And when they do,

916
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:27,810
it will take the greatest military of 
that age to be able to resist and go up 

917
00:55:29,441 --> 00:55:33,520
against what is a revolutionary military
challenge.

918
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:39,270
The first peoples in history probably 
who had to try to figure out how you 

919
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:43,510
defeat an army where everyone in the 
army is mounted on horseback.

920
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:50,100
Now.
Our modern era is so different than how 

921
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:53,490
the dynamics of warfare worked for most 
of human history that at sometimes.

922
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:58,990
And sometimes we have to reintroduce the
more obvious things to sort of click a 

923
00:55:58,990 --> 00:55:59,590
light bulb on in your head and remind 
you,

924
00:55:59,591 --> 00:56:04,591
oh yeah,
we're talking about something this 

925
00:56:04,591 --> 00:56:04,591
basic.
For example,

926
00:56:04,591 --> 00:56:05,560
I and I love these military revolution 
periods.

927
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:09,370
Can you imagine what it must have been 
like when the first cherry,

928
00:56:09,371 --> 00:56:12,100
it's attacked the first,
you know,

929
00:56:12,101 --> 00:56:17,101
settled civilizations out there in the 
first time in army that was composed 

930
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:21,820
entirely of people walking,
had to deal with something moving at the

931
00:56:21,821 --> 00:56:24,550
speed of a horse.
And by the way,

932
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:29,551
the way that they usually function was 
that the person inside the cherry and 

933
00:56:29,551 --> 00:56:32,911
had a very powerful blow and shot arrows
at people and never really tried to 

934
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:38,820
contact them at all until they were 
broken and running away so you couldn't 

935
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:38,820
catch them and they moved faster than 
you did.

936
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:42,250
And it changed warfare.
And sometimes it's funny by the way,

937
00:56:42,251 --> 00:56:43,650
to read some of the,
the,

938
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:48,651
the records that have been kept that you
have from some of these very early 

939
00:56:48,651 --> 00:56:51,391
chariots societies and you realize how 
little they know about horses because 

940
00:56:51,391 --> 00:56:53,620
people who knew anything about horses 
are these really high paid,

941
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:56,470
important individuals and they have this
hidden knowledge about,

942
00:56:56,790 --> 00:57:01,790
you know,
here's how you take care of the feet of 

943
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:01,790
a horse and here's what you do.
If they get bloat,

944
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:03,670
I mean things that today,
bazillions of people know back then.

945
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:06,100
This was like privileged information,
how you care for these things,

946
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:06,430
right?

947
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:12,500
And the Horse in the subtle societies,
the Egypt,

948
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,100
the Babylon's in the series.
At first you can see that they,

949
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,680
that they don't know how to deal with 
the animal.

950
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:19,900
I mean,
there are wonderful little figurines and

951
00:57:19,901 --> 00:57:21,820
whatnot showing you know,
the Egyptian,

952
00:57:21,821 --> 00:57:26,821
maybe it's like an Egyptian scout during
maybe the first 200 years or something 

953
00:57:26,821 --> 00:57:31,130
that the Egyptians were really trying to
use horses and he's sitting way back 

954
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:34,381
over the tail of the horse,
like he hasn't even figured out that 

955
00:57:34,381 --> 00:57:37,471
that's not the right spot to sit in,
but we take it for granted that this is 

956
00:57:37,471 --> 00:57:41,521
an obvious thing,
might not have been about 1000 bce.

957
00:57:42,011 --> 00:57:47,011
Cavalry first appears and it generally 
appears in,

958
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:47,710
in,
in,

959
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:52,770
in a way that once again makes you think
that these people are not very 

960
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:54,400
comfortable writing.
And remember there are no saddles,

961
00:57:54,401 --> 00:57:56,470
there are no spurs,
there are no stirrups.

962
00:57:56,910 --> 00:58:01,330
I mean there's a lot of knack to knowing
what you're doing here.

963
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:06,660
And remember also that riding horses can
be injurous and fatal if you're not used

964
00:58:07,721 --> 00:58:08,140
to it.
Right?

965
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:13,141
And none of these people are growing up 
doing a whole lot of horse riding and 

966
00:58:13,141 --> 00:58:16,890
about 900 bce you can see carving 
showing a Syrian cavalry,

967
00:58:17,051 --> 00:58:18,820
which is probably,
if you think about it,

968
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,280
you know,
cutting edge for the time period for the

969
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:26,281
subtle civilizations and they send the 
cavalry riders out in Pairs because one 

970
00:58:26,801 --> 00:58:30,160
guy has to hold the reigns for the other
guy's horse.

971
00:58:30,161 --> 00:58:32,380
When the other guy decides he's gonna 
shoot or anything.

972
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:37,800
In other words,
they don't even feel comfortable enough 

973
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:37,800
to shoot and ride.
You know,

974
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,970
independently.
You've got to have someone there to hold

975
00:58:39,971 --> 00:58:40,800
the horse.
When you do it.

976
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,610
Another words,
you can watch the evolution,

977
00:58:42,611 --> 00:58:47,611
right?
It's different when the armies from the 

978
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:49,000
Middle East,
the ancient near east first run into the

979
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:54,001
steppe troops.
That will make up one of the dominant 

980
00:58:54,001 --> 00:58:57,241
important tribal areas in world history 
for almost ever.

981
00:58:57,551 --> 00:59:02,551
I mean it's only the last couple hundred
years that the Eurasian Steppe part of 

982
00:59:02,591 --> 00:59:05,200
which you would refer to as Central Asia
today,

983
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:07,480
Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan,

984
00:59:07,481 --> 00:59:12,481
those kinds of places.
Certainly in the last couple hundred 

985
00:59:12,481 --> 00:59:14,880
years,
those places have not been massively 

986
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,651
relevant to what's going on.
I was reading a book not that long ago 

987
00:59:16,651 --> 00:59:19,510
that it was going into all of the things
that China and Russia have.

988
00:59:19,511 --> 00:59:22,190
The 17 hundreds see is only

989
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:27,190
a couple hundred years ago.
All the things that they had to do to 

990
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:28,700
deal with the tribes on the step and 
it's crazy because,

991
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:30,740
you know,
when you look at history,

992
00:59:30,741 --> 00:59:35,741
you become very accustomed to watching 
the so called civilized society is just 

993
00:59:36,711 --> 00:59:39,050
rolling over tribal peoples,
you know,

994
00:59:39,051 --> 00:59:44,051
at a certain point in history once,
once the momentum gets going and you 

995
00:59:44,051 --> 00:59:46,700
have like Julius Caesar and Roman armies
just rolling over Celtic society,

996
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:50,780
you're already prepared to get to the 
part where the colonial Europeans,

997
00:59:50,781 --> 00:59:55,781
you know,
show up on these distant shores and run 

998
00:59:55,781 --> 00:59:55,781
into people with wooden clubs and bows 
and arrows.

999
00:59:55,781 --> 00:59:56,390
When you've got guns,
I mean,

1000
00:59:56,391 --> 00:59:57,920
it's a foregone conclusion,
right?

1001
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:03,600
But you look at the step and you see the
one place in history,

1002
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:08,601
we're for a number of different reasons.
The odds are much more equal between 

1003
01:00:08,601 --> 01:00:10,830
settled and tribal peoples.
First of all,

1004
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:16,250
it's likely that the odds in terms of 
fighting power in terms of manpower was 

1005
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:20,361
probably pretty close.
The settler societies had a lot more 

1006
01:00:20,361 --> 01:00:20,700
people,
but a lot of them weren't fighters.

1007
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:25,730
The tribal societies usually had most of
their mail people as fighters

1008
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,080
and some females.
By the way,

1009
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:33,760
the weapons technology was probably 
comparable.

1010
01:00:33,761 --> 01:00:38,761
The the bose used by this step.
People are famously some of the best 

1011
01:00:38,761 --> 01:00:42,960
ever made,
but there would've been other things 

1012
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:42,960
that the settled so called settled 
societies had in their favor,

1013
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,870
so probably a wash there,
but imagine imagine the native Americans

1014
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:52,200
with a rough parody and fighting men and
a rough parody in weapons technology.

1015
01:00:53,561 --> 01:00:55,930
What would the native Americans have 
done to the settlers?

1016
01:00:55,931 --> 01:00:58,000
Then?
Who knows,

1017
01:00:58,001 --> 01:01:03,001
but at least it's a fair fight added 
that the geographic conditions and the 

1018
01:01:03,001 --> 01:01:03,340
distance,
right?

1019
01:01:03,341 --> 01:01:08,341
This is a harsh environment.
The steps sometimes if you're not 

1020
01:01:08,341 --> 01:01:09,130
adapted to it and it's a long way from 
point a to point b,

1021
01:01:09,131 --> 01:01:14,131
no matter where you're going and you had
a part of the world that was protected 

1022
01:01:14,131 --> 01:01:18,181
by step peoples for Millennia,
where they maintained their way of life 

1023
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:20,620
and were,
shall we say,

1024
01:01:20,621 --> 01:01:21,580
relevant,
relevant,

1025
01:01:21,581 --> 01:01:23,200
is a good non biased in any direction.

1026
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:28,200
Word relevant to the societies and world
powers around them and we've known them 

1027
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:28,480
forever,
right?

1028
01:01:28,481 --> 01:01:33,481
We've seen wave after wave of these 
people come forward from the Magyars to 

1029
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:34,510
the Turks,
to the hands to the Hmong goals.

1030
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:39,030
This is the first period in recorded 
history where these people break through

1031
01:01:39,031 --> 01:01:44,031
and someone's there to record it.
There's always been a historical school 

1032
01:01:44,441 --> 01:01:49,441
of thought that chariot invasions from 
Central Asia long before this period 

1033
01:01:49,441 --> 01:01:51,640
represent earlier versions of these 
kinds of invasions,

1034
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,480
but this is the first one recorded where
you get to see,

1035
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:58,450
you know,
the kinds of step armies you will expect

1036
01:01:58,451 --> 01:02:03,451
for the next 2000 years mounted on 
horseback with people who are.

1037
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:06,550
You know,
as we said about the Spartans,

1038
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:11,560
that they were sort of a laboratory 
experiment to see if a culture could 

1039
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:14,581
create a super soldier.
The step societies are are kind of a 

1040
01:02:14,581 --> 01:02:14,650
laboratory experiment too.

1041
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:19,770
If you put people on horseback from the 
time when they're toddlers and put a bow

1042
01:02:19,771 --> 01:02:24,771
in their hand from not much later and 
have them ride all the time and do 

1043
01:02:24,771 --> 01:02:29,271
everything on horseback and use those 
bose continually and develop tactics 

1044
01:02:29,271 --> 01:02:30,630
where they never really come into 
contact with peoples.

1045
01:02:30,631 --> 01:02:31,530
They don't want to come in.
I mean,

1046
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:37,130
what do you end up with?
And the answer is you end up with a 

1047
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:41,451
weapons system that was so effective 
that even after guns were developed.

1048
01:02:43,321 --> 01:02:45,570
Modern societies,
we're having a tough time,

1049
01:02:45,571 --> 01:02:50,571
pardon the pun,
corralling these people even up until 

1050
01:02:50,571 --> 01:02:54,021
relatively modern times now when you 
think about how long that is,

1051
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:57,480
people trying to contend with the step 
people.

1052
01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:02,780
Think about how much admiration we 
should have with the first people who 

1053
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,380
had to try with no track record or 
experience.

1054
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:10,520
The Assyrians would develop a kind of a 
broad policy of dealing with these 

1055
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:14,280
tribal step people that resembles what 
very sophisticated people who dealt with

1056
01:03:14,281 --> 01:03:19,281
them for a very long time came up with 
the Chinese and the Byzantines for 

1057
01:03:19,281 --> 01:03:19,281
example.

1058
01:03:19,281 --> 01:03:21,210
Would you use a mix of diplomacy,
intermarriage,

1059
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:24,090
warfare,
and you know,

1060
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:27,900
keeping the tribes divided and fighting 
amongst themselves and the Assyrians did

1061
01:03:27,901 --> 01:03:30,600
all this stuff too.
They use some of these people as allies.

1062
01:03:30,601 --> 01:03:32,790
Sometimes they'd have mercenaries who 
were,

1063
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,350
you know,
people from these tribes,

1064
01:03:34,351 --> 01:03:39,351
the tribes like the comedians in the 
[inaudible] and the various psychotic 

1065
01:03:39,351 --> 01:03:42,590
tribes and the massive ged.
They have all these wonderful tribal 

1066
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:44,310
confederations and one is scarier than 
the next,

1067
01:03:44,311 --> 01:03:46,110
and if you're one of those settled 
society people,

1068
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:51,350
barbarians in air quotes always scared.
You mean there was just something scary 

1069
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:52,010
to settle people about.
You know,

1070
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:55,890
people like the celts for example,
the Athenians are no different.

1071
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,110
The various step peoples are no 
different.

1072
01:03:58,111 --> 01:03:59,520
They're headhunters,
for example,

1073
01:03:59,521 --> 01:04:04,320
famously will drink from the skulls of 
their dead enemies.

1074
01:04:04,321 --> 01:04:09,260
Make cups out of them and if you want to
see how the wonderful continuity of step

1075
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:10,020
culture sometimes go.

1076
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:15,020
They were doing this in in ancient times
and they were doing this up until 

1077
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:15,020
relatively,
you know,

1078
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:16,560
goal type history,
the drinking cups.

1079
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:21,150
Golfing was a perennial favorite,
but that's just a cultural thing,

1080
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:26,390
right?
I mean the Assyrians are hanging 

1081
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:27,801
enemies,
heads on walls so that they can watch 

1082
01:04:27,801 --> 01:04:29,190
their wife have relations with the 
Assyrian king who killed them.

1083
01:04:29,191 --> 01:04:31,290
I mean,
everybody's got their thing right.

1084
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:35,400
At the same time,
you know these people are scary,

1085
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:39,810
they're effective,
they are entirely mounted,

1086
01:04:39,811 --> 01:04:44,811
which means they have amazing challenges
to the militaries of the day because 

1087
01:04:44,811 --> 01:04:47,931
remember,
you move at the speed of your slowest 

1088
01:04:47,931 --> 01:04:47,931
person.
If you have an entire army mounted,

1089
01:04:47,931 --> 01:04:49,860
the entire army moves at the speed of a 
horse.

1090
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:55,070
These are huge challenges and the 
Assyrians managed to ward off the worst 

1091
01:04:55,070 --> 01:04:56,400
of the attacks and in the sense,
you know,

1092
01:04:56,401 --> 01:05:01,401
you could make a case that they 
protected this entire area of 

1093
01:05:01,401 --> 01:05:05,091
civilization from marauding is scary 
peoples who were not going to leave it 

1094
01:05:05,641 --> 01:05:10,641
intact.
And you know this because there were 

1095
01:05:10,641 --> 01:05:10,641
several invasions that did break 
through.

1096
01:05:10,641 --> 01:05:15,260
There's a hoard of [inaudible] that will
rape and pillage all the way down to 

1097
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:18,220
Egypt before the Egyptians either buy 
them off or militarily turned

1098
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:21,910
them back and they they go bouncing 
around the region like a sneaker ball.

1099
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,180
The fact that in a lot of these step 
armies,

1100
01:05:25,181 --> 01:05:30,181
every single person was mounted was also
revolutionary and huge in the armies of 

1101
01:05:32,411 --> 01:05:33,940
the day.
If you were lucky,

1102
01:05:33,941 --> 01:05:36,910
had 15 or 20 percent of their force 
mounted,

1103
01:05:36,911 --> 01:05:41,911
sometimes quite a bit less.
You still move at the speed of your 

1104
01:05:41,911 --> 01:05:44,520
slowest troops though if you don't.
If you break the cavalry officer,

1105
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:49,560
you can operate independently.
You'll have a nice small group of 

1106
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,650
cavalry that gets overwhelmed by an 
entirely mounted forest,

1107
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:55,830
so nonetheless,
and army with inventory moves at the 

1108
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:58,651
speed of infantry.
These armies that the settled societies 

1109
01:05:58,651 --> 01:05:59,680
in this geopolitical realm and Cheyenna 
are trying to deal with,

1110
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:03,460
move at the speed of a horse 
strategically on the map.

1111
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:06,490
That's a devastating thing to try to 
counter.

1112
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:11,520
The fact that the Assyrians could is a 
testimony to how great the greatest 

1113
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,510
military of the world had ever seen was 
and how well lead.

1114
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:19,290
Nonetheless,
you could see how big the challenge was 

1115
01:06:19,290 --> 01:06:19,290
in seven.
Oh,

1116
01:06:19,290 --> 01:06:22,750
five bce Sargon the second,
arguably the greatest king of Syria ever

1117
01:06:22,751 --> 01:06:27,751
had will as an elderly man lead the 
Assyrian Army in person up to modern 

1118
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:36,640
southeastern Turkey,
near the border of neo hittite area 

1119
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:41,080
called to ball and probably fighting in 
conjunction with some of these,

1120
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:41,750
uh,
uh,

1121
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:45,490
neo hittite cities,
Eurasian Steppe troops,

1122
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:49,120
comedians are skiff,
eons and Sargon.

1123
01:06:49,121 --> 01:06:54,121
The second will disappear with the army.
The body will never be recovered.

1124
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:59,230
That is a very rare event.
When the body is not recovered,

1125
01:06:59,231 --> 01:07:04,231
the assumption is that nobody got out 
because one of the last things you will 

1126
01:07:04,231 --> 01:07:06,970
do is grab the king's body and spirited 
away.

1127
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:12,270
It's like saving the flag times 10,
there'll be an Egyptian king to famously

1128
01:07:13,361 --> 01:07:16,510
who was bones will stay on the 
battlefield and they,

1129
01:07:16,511 --> 01:07:18,340
they,
they ended up getting it later.

1130
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:23,340
And mummifying a body that's been 
mutilated it on the battlefield for a 

1131
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:28,650
few weeks.
And you can still look at the mommy 

1132
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:28,650
today and see,
oh wow,

1133
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:31,750
they didn't get to him for awhile.
So I on the second will never be found.

1134
01:07:31,930 --> 01:07:34,710
I've often thought it's not a 
coincidence his son Senaca.

1135
01:07:34,711 --> 01:07:38,590
We've never actually led a force in 
person when he was king.

1136
01:07:38,591 --> 01:07:41,050
He left that to the generals.
There's very important things in Nineveh

1137
01:07:41,051 --> 01:07:43,210
that need taken care of.
As we all understand.

1138
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:49,170
Anyone who could do that too,
in the Syrian army at the height of a 

1139
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:52,330
serious power is formidable indeed.
Now,

1140
01:07:52,331 --> 01:07:54,160
even though a Siri could protect some of
this region,

1141
01:07:54,161 --> 01:07:59,161
they couldn't protect all of it,
and some of these tribes filtered down 

1142
01:07:59,161 --> 01:08:00,190
into the area where the people were 
ostensibly talking about,

1143
01:08:00,191 --> 01:08:02,590
here are the medes,
the Persians,

1144
01:08:02,591 --> 01:08:04,540
the Elamites,
the Zagros mountains,

1145
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:09,541
Iran.
The peoples in this region are about to 

1146
01:08:09,541 --> 01:08:12,970
go through a one,
two punch that will change them forever.

1147
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:16,010
The second of these punches will be 
delivered by

1148
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:17,750
the Assyrians.
Surprise,

1149
01:08:17,751 --> 01:08:19,520
surprise.
They were throwing punches everywhere.

1150
01:08:19,521 --> 01:08:24,521
Why shouldn't this region get hit to the
first will be delivered by these step 

1151
01:08:24,521 --> 01:08:28,871
people,
these tribes of [inaudible] and 

1152
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:30,920
[inaudible] who will at a certain point 
I said filtered.

1153
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:35,950
I thought that was a nice ambiguous way 
when you don't really know what 

1154
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:39,491
happened,
but the traditional idea is that the 

1155
01:08:39,491 --> 01:08:41,381
[inaudible] and the comedians attacked 
and broke into an assaulted the needs in

1156
01:08:41,871 --> 01:08:46,871
a giant invasion.
There's even a year associated with its 

1157
01:08:46,871 --> 01:08:46,871
6:53
bce,

1158
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:50,600
which if you think about it's like 50 
years after Sargon,

1159
01:08:50,601 --> 01:08:52,220
the second dies,
you know,

1160
01:08:52,221 --> 01:08:53,390
up into ball,
right?

1161
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:58,480
About 55,
60 years since these horse people first 

1162
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:03,041
appeared and they're still managing to 
totally disrupt in a huge areas of this 

1163
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,010
geopolitical ecosystem.
Only use that word from now on.

1164
01:09:07,011 --> 01:09:08,060
We all know what I mean,
right?

1165
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:13,880
Filtered is a good word though,
because it also allows room for a theory

1166
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:19,100
where warfare sort of doesn't dominate 
the reasoning behind why all of a sudden

1167
01:09:19,101 --> 01:09:22,280
all these central Asian tribes moved 
into this part of Iran.

1168
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:26,780
One of the things that's really changed 
since I first started studying the story

1169
01:09:26,781 --> 01:09:30,050
is the concept that historians have 
about who these medallions were and what

1170
01:09:30,051 --> 01:09:32,180
kind of state they had when I was 
growing up.

1171
01:09:32,181 --> 01:09:37,181
The history is all made.
It sound like the means were like the 

1172
01:09:37,181 --> 01:09:37,520
Babylonians and the Assyrians by this 
time,

1173
01:09:37,521 --> 01:09:42,521
a centralized state with cities and 
governments and bureaucracies and all 

1174
01:09:42,521 --> 01:09:43,220
that.
Historians today,

1175
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:45,290
and you know,
I'm not one I just read the best,

1176
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:50,410
um,
they make it sound much more like the 

1177
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:52,841
current state of theory is that these 
needs are much more tribal than we had 

1178
01:09:52,841 --> 01:09:57,551
previously assumed.
And if so might not be that much 

1179
01:09:57,551 --> 01:09:59,930
different than these [inaudible] Syrians
coming into their area.

1180
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:03,620
This could be much more like a tribal 
relationship.

1181
01:10:03,621 --> 01:10:08,621
What did we say?
The medes and the Persians were second 

1182
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:10,451
cousins who fought.
Sometimes these step people's are like 

1183
01:10:10,451 --> 01:10:13,391
third cousins who fight a lot.
Remember they could allegedly speak to 

1184
01:10:13,591 --> 01:10:15,750
each other without the use of a 
translator.

1185
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:18,870
When you're that close to another 
people.

1186
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:24,200
What appears to be a conquest from 
outside might be much more like dynastic

1187
01:10:24,241 --> 01:10:29,241
marriage or someone having to change 
their alliance status or becoming a 

1188
01:10:29,241 --> 01:10:33,690
vassal of someone else or having to pay 
tribute Hurghada tissue might see all of

1189
01:10:33,691 --> 01:10:37,240
that stuff as a version of slavery,
but when he calls it slave,

1190
01:10:37,241 --> 01:10:39,690
where we might be picturing something 
else entirely

1191
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:46,220
erotic just says that the domination of 
the needs last 28 years and an 

1192
01:10:48,421 --> 01:10:53,421
interesting little in a tidbit that 
might confirm what he says is during 

1193
01:10:53,521 --> 01:10:54,870
that time period,
the Assyrians,

1194
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:59,910
the Babylonians who keep records and who
knows and mentioned the medes from time 

1195
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:01,800
to time,
start calling everyone who lives in that

1196
01:11:01,801 --> 01:11:06,801
whole region,
the womb and Munda and recess are gummy 

1197
01:11:06,841 --> 01:11:11,841
among others.
Suggest that this might mean that the 

1198
01:11:11,841 --> 01:11:14,871
entire area has just been sort of 
overwhelmed and that you can't tell one 

1199
01:11:14,871 --> 01:11:19,671
tribe from another without a scorecard.
Hurghada test if you want to go with 

1200
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:23,490
this,
tells one of his really fun stories.

1201
01:11:23,491 --> 01:11:23,940
Um,
you know,

1202
01:11:23,941 --> 01:11:28,941
if you're like me,
about how the medes eventually threw off

1203
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,310
the nomadic yoke that was oppressing 
them.

1204
01:11:32,311 --> 01:11:36,660
And he tells a story about how they 
invited the [inaudible] and leaders to a

1205
01:11:36,661 --> 01:11:41,661
banquet and then got them all drunk and 
then when they were also a knee created,

1206
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:44,490
they could hardly stand.
They went in and killed them all,

1207
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:48,180
I guess you could call that,
you know,

1208
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:51,520
decapitating the enemy leadership 
literally.

1209
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:55,540
Or maybe the tactic is drunk and mass 
homicide,

1210
01:11:55,541 --> 01:11:58,600
whatever you want to call it.
It seems like a motif.

1211
01:11:58,601 --> 01:12:03,601
Another one of these recurring sorts of 
things you see all throughout history 

1212
01:12:03,601 --> 01:12:07,081
and the writing and one of those,
one of those aspects of the story that 

1213
01:12:07,081 --> 01:12:11,251
oftentimes professional historians will 
discount because after all we see this 

1214
01:12:11,251 --> 01:12:11,830
all the time.
This sounds just like blah,

1215
01:12:11,831 --> 01:12:12,340
blah,
blah.

1216
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:16,120
And they're almost always right.
Here's the weird part though.

1217
01:12:16,121 --> 01:12:18,940
This is something that you actually see 
in history,

1218
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:24,180
confirm bubbly.
The relationship between using alcohol 

1219
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:28,630
as some sort of a trap to ensnare other 
people who then become vulnerable.

1220
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:31,120
I mean,
we've seen this in recorded history like

1221
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:36,150
not that long ago.
Native American tribes had this 

1222
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:37,950
treatment done to them sometimes 
multiple times.

1223
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:40,470
In other words,
what might it look in this case?

1224
01:12:40,471 --> 01:12:45,471
Like a recurring motif might actually be
a recurring historical occurrence.

1225
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:50,190
How would you tell the difference?
In any case,

1226
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:54,120
it'll happen again in this story,
which once again makes you say,

1227
01:12:54,121 --> 01:12:59,121
okay,
is this just a recurring motif or is 

1228
01:12:59,121 --> 01:12:59,610
this a tactic that worked last time?
So we're trying it again.

1229
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:04,800
Nonetheless,
somehow the medes regain in a freedom of

1230
01:13:04,801 --> 01:13:07,170
action from these people who were then 
thrown out,

1231
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:12,410
leaving behind another wonderful ethnic 
strain of the central Asian bloodline 

1232
01:13:12,410 --> 01:13:17,300
that will run through Iran over the ages
and that will be added to with new 

1233
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:17,880
blood,
sometimes,

1234
01:13:17,881 --> 01:13:19,770
tragically from time to time.

1235
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:26,480
The guy who is supposedly the king of 
the medes during this period of 

1236
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,130
domination by the [inaudible] is a mead 
name.

1237
01:13:29,330 --> 01:13:30,490
See accessories,

1238
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:36,950
carotids his credits him with totally 
reorganizing the military of the medes.

1239
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:42,650
He says that because the accessories 
becomes the first Asian leader too,

1240
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:46,350
you know,
separate and army into component parts,

1241
01:13:46,351 --> 01:13:48,660
you know,
archers and Spearman and cavalry.

1242
01:13:48,661 --> 01:13:51,480
He says before that they all fought 
together in a chaotic mass,

1243
01:13:51,481 --> 01:13:56,481
which is not true at all,
but some historians think he's 

1244
01:13:56,481 --> 01:14:00,291
preserving some sort of a memory of this
important medean ruler who reorganize 

1245
01:14:01,031 --> 01:14:06,031
the military and made it much more 
powerful and considering what he was 

1246
01:14:06,031 --> 01:14:08,961
about to do with it.
There seems to be some historical 

1247
01:14:08,961 --> 01:14:10,860
evidence for the medes all of a sudden 
becoming very formidable indeed.

1248
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:16,120
Right about the same time.
When the great traditionally great power

1249
01:14:16,121 --> 01:14:21,060
in that region gets mortally wounded by 
Assyria,

1250
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:26,990
and we alluded to this earlier,
part of a serious laying waste to all 

1251
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:27,750
these,
you know,

1252
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:30,190
competitors for their superpower status,
right?

1253
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:33,880
There's not going to be anybody that 
even gets to put up a little resistance.

1254
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:35,920
The elamites,
once again,

1255
01:14:35,921 --> 01:14:37,720
get on the hit list for doing the same 
thing.

1256
01:14:37,721 --> 01:14:41,500
They always do.
Babylon revolt against the Syria.

1257
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:46,770
Elom helps Babylon.
As soon as the Assyrians take care of 

1258
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:50,161
Babylon,
they come for the elamites and this 

1259
01:14:50,161 --> 01:14:52,610
happens under the last of the Great 
Assyrian rulers is Bonnie,

1260
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:54,730
Paul Oscher,
Bonnie Paul,

1261
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:59,620
who's who's a very long ruling guy,
and at the start of his reign,

1262
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:04,240
the empire could not be at a higher 
place by the end of his reign.

1263
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:06,880
You know he's writing these.
Woe is me tales.

1264
01:15:06,881 --> 01:15:09,100
What did I do to have the gods turned 
against me?

1265
01:15:09,101 --> 01:15:10,980
Everything sucks,
you know,

1266
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:12,760
but all die soon,
at least kinds of.

1267
01:15:12,761 --> 01:15:17,761
I'm in a writings.
Syria will go from the height of its 

1268
01:15:18,191 --> 01:15:23,191
fortunes to 1945,
Berlin follow the Third Reich 

1269
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:28,260
devastation,
never to rise again in a very short 

1270
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:32,911
period of time and some have argued that
part of the reason why is because of 

1271
01:15:34,121 --> 01:15:39,121
what they did to the people around them.
They destroyed the other powers who 

1272
01:15:39,571 --> 01:15:42,330
might have acted as barriers against new
rising ones.

1273
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:47,340
Whether the new rising ones are 
[inaudible] and [inaudible] from the 

1274
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:51,020
Eurasian Steppe,
or whether they're an obscure tribal 

1275
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:54,830
people known as the medes,
who all of a sudden they're really 

1276
01:15:54,830 --> 01:15:57,351
getting powerful and well led who 
otherwise would have been dealing with 

1277
01:15:57,351 --> 01:15:59,670
the Ila Mites,
but the elamites gets smashed by Asher,

1278
01:15:59,671 --> 01:16:02,230
Bonnie Paul in 6:46
BC.

1279
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:07,240
He and the devastation is arguably 
mortal.

1280
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:14,600
We already mentioned a scene from the 
aftermath of this isla might final 

1281
01:16:15,091 --> 01:16:20,091
solution when Asha,
Bonnie Paul's lying on his couch with 

1282
01:16:20,091 --> 01:16:21,660
that woman there and then the severed 
head,

1283
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:23,550
you know,
up on the pillar of their wall.

1284
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:24,610
That's,
you know,

1285
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:28,530
part of the aftermath of dealing with 
the elamites this way.

1286
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:29,630
Asha,
Bonnie,

1287
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,650
Paul Leeds,
the greatest Syrian army,

1288
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:36,060
all the way.
It's a long way again to susa devastates

1289
01:16:36,061 --> 01:16:41,010
elom as his scribe,
writing for himself recounts,

1290
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:44,940
quote for a distance of one month in 25 
days.

1291
01:16:44,941 --> 01:16:47,670
March.
I devastated the districts of Ylem.

1292
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:51,720
I spread salt and thorn Bush there to 
injure the soil.

1293
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:56,960
Sons of the king's sisters of the king's
members of royal family,

1294
01:16:57,121 --> 01:17:01,200
young and old prefix governors nights.
Artisans,

1295
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:04,710
as many as there were inhabited and male
and female,

1296
01:17:04,711 --> 01:17:07,110
big and little horses,
mules,

1297
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:12,140
asses,
flocks and herds more numerous than a 

1298
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:14,120
swarm of locusts.
I carried them off as boody to Assyria,

1299
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:19,010
the dust of Sousa of Murdoch to of how 
and of the other cities.

1300
01:17:19,011 --> 01:17:22,520
I carried it off to a Syria in a month 
of days.

1301
01:17:22,521 --> 01:17:26,840
I subdued elam in its whole extent,
the voice of man,

1302
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:30,800
the steps of flocks and herds.
The happy shouts of Mirth.

1303
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:34,730
I put an end to them in its fields,
which I left for the asses,

1304
01:17:34,731 --> 01:17:39,731
the gazelles and all manner of wild 
beasts to people and quote.

1305
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:44,630
The Assyrians were thorough.

1306
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:51,040
They even removed the bones of the old 
going back to ancient times.

1307
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:57,100
Isla might rulers from their tombs and 
took them back to a Siri with dilute my 

1308
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:03,740
story in a tea.
Olmsted says they put them in 

1309
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:05,420
particularly awful spots so that they 
would get no rest ever again,

1310
01:18:05,421 --> 01:18:10,421
laying in a foreign land and paying an 
eternal price for their enmity to 

1311
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:13,640
Assyria.
That may have happened in the deep,

1312
01:18:13,641 --> 01:18:16,770
misty errors of the past.
I mean,

1313
01:18:16,771 --> 01:18:20,360
we said to you earlier that the elamites
conquered the United States.

1314
01:18:20,361 --> 01:18:23,840
They take the statue of Liberty back as 
a prize of war to be displayed.

1315
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:29,710
Will.
The Assyrians wouldn't stop at the 

1316
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:29,710
Statue of Liberty.
They'd steal our constitution.

1317
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:34,331
They take the Washington monument,
they sniff out the flame of John f 

1318
01:18:34,331 --> 01:18:36,260
Kennedy's grave and take the bones with 
them.

1319
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:41,780
The Assyrians were sort of setting the 
bar for this region.

1320
01:18:41,781 --> 01:18:44,750
People like the Babylonians who come 
afterwards will be just as brutal,

1321
01:18:44,751 --> 01:18:47,690
like they're trying to imitate whatever 
the standard of the day is,

1322
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:52,220
but the standard of the day is,
even today,

1323
01:18:52,450 --> 01:18:54,590
I mean,
try making a movie out of it.

1324
01:18:54,591 --> 01:18:55,590
It's gonna be.
It's gonna.

1325
01:18:55,610 --> 01:18:59,270
Be a cable one for sure.
I mean the story almost had tells of the

1326
01:18:59,271 --> 01:19:01,130
parade.
Is that a good word?

1327
01:19:01,490 --> 01:19:02,250
When Osher,
Bonnie,

1328
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:05,120
Paul and his army arrived back home in 
Nineveh,

1329
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:10,630
displaying the loot and the prisoners 
and meeting out punishment by the way to

1330
01:19:10,881 --> 01:19:15,881
all and sundry is frightful.
First of all,

1331
01:19:16,610 --> 01:19:19,720
the head of that elamite ruler that will
be sitting up on us.

1332
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:22,190
You're bonded.
Paul's wall or what have you,

1333
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:27,610
was transported from Susa on foot around
the neck of the Ila might general 

1334
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:33,720
imagine how freaky that would have been 
to live through who did the walking.

1335
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:38,800
Shane's supposedly,
and then the various generals are 

1336
01:19:38,871 --> 01:19:43,871
brought out and punished,
and there's a psychological twists to a 

1337
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:43,871
Syrian punishment.
By the way,

1338
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:47,990
that is part of kind of what the 
Persians will sort of do away with.

1339
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:53,740
Here's what 18 olmsted writes,
and I'm going to try my best at some of 

1340
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:55,370
the pronunciations of these Mesopotamian
names.

1341
01:19:55,371 --> 01:19:57,860
They are wonderful.
He writes,

1342
01:19:57,861 --> 01:20:00,260
quote Osher,
Bond I.

1343
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:05,260
Paul was about to leave our Bella for 
Nineveh and the severed head of the Ila 

1344
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:07,560
might ruler was entrusted to his general
dot,

1345
01:20:07,561 --> 01:20:09,390
New News,
neck for transport.

1346
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:13,050
As the musicians lead the gasoline 
procession into Nineveh,

1347
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:18,350
the terrible site crazed how Mandara and
Nabu domonique the ambassadors who had 

1348
01:20:18,451 --> 01:20:20,730
received their commissions from the dead
monarch.

1349
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:23,610
One tour his beard,
the other thrust,

1350
01:20:23,611 --> 01:20:28,611
his girdle sword into his bosom.
Apulia son of Nabulu Shalam and grandson

1351
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:32,760
of the famous Mera Doc Bala.
Don was extradited from elom.

1352
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:36,300
Manu done nu new and Nabulu Shalam.

1353
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:41,480
The Gumbo Ulu chief tins had spoken 
blasphemy against the Assyrian Gods and 

1354
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:44,610
for this crime they had their tongues 
pulled out by the roots and were skinned

1355
01:20:44,611 --> 01:20:47,550
alive.
The horrible scene is represented on one

1356
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:50,220
of the reliefs,
although strangely enough,

1357
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:53,160
olmsted writes,
the names have never been filled in.

1358
01:20:53,161 --> 01:20:58,161
The blanks left for the purpose.
The new new was placed on the rack and 

1359
01:20:58,161 --> 01:20:59,100
slaughtered like a lamb.
His brother,

1360
01:20:59,101 --> 01:21:04,101
Sam Guna,
when Appalachia were slain and their 

1361
01:21:04,101 --> 01:21:04,200
flesh distributed among the surrounding 
lands.

1362
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:07,280
Now Bu naive and Bella tear,
sons of Nablus,

1363
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:12,290
Schumer were forced to crush the bones 
of their father and the head of the Ila 

1364
01:21:12,290 --> 01:21:14,730
Mike King found its final resting place 
over the gate,

1365
01:21:14,731 --> 01:21:19,731
which led to assure and quote,
osher being a primary Assyrian city.

1366
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:25,880
The forcing the sons to crush the bones 
of the father is one of those really 

1367
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:29,790
psychologically horrible things.
And you'll see this in other occasions.

1368
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:31,770
The Babylonian King,
for example,

1369
01:21:31,771 --> 01:21:36,771
who supposedly once he took Jerusalem,
took the ruler the king and forced him 

1370
01:21:37,711 --> 01:21:42,390
to watch the slaughtering of his two 
young sons in front of his eyes and then

1371
01:21:42,391 --> 01:21:45,270
had his eyes put out.
So that the last thing he saw was that,

1372
01:21:45,271 --> 01:21:50,271
I mean,
those are the extra little cruelties 

1373
01:21:50,271 --> 01:21:50,271
that just seem,
well,

1374
01:21:50,271 --> 01:21:54,441
that just seemed calculated to subdue 
somebody who's will to resist,

1375
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:58,020
but you could easily see how it might 
have the opposite effect.

1376
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,060
You could see how,
uh,

1377
01:22:00,061 --> 01:22:05,061
people coming after this time might be 
able to make all sorts of political hay 

1378
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:11,250
selling themselves as the alternative to
this kind of cruelty.

1379
01:22:11,850 --> 01:22:16,740
And you can also see why when a Syria 
foul,

1380
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:21,750
there were not a lot of tears cried for 
what was gone.

1381
01:22:21,751 --> 01:22:22,830
In fact,
you know,

1382
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:25,710
even the biblical prophets are 
rejoicing.

1383
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:33,610
As I was trying to come up with some 
sort of analogy to try to define the 

1384
01:22:33,610 --> 01:22:38,171
stakes here with what's about to happen.
All I could think of in my uncreative 

1385
01:22:39,110 --> 01:22:44,110
mind was the idea of the United States 
over the next five or so years.

1386
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,130
Somehow,
you know,

1387
01:22:46,131 --> 01:22:51,131
with jaw dropping,
astonishing events fell apart or 

1388
01:22:51,921 --> 01:22:52,760
imploded

1389
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:59,010
and a broken to some kind of a civil war
ended up getting involved in maybe a 

1390
01:22:59,010 --> 01:22:59,350
foreign war at the same time.
I mean,

1391
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:01,300
he never know how these things are gonna
turn.

1392
01:23:01,301 --> 01:23:05,380
Remember how you felt if you were old 
enough to remember what the 9:11

1393
01:23:05,381 --> 01:23:06,190
attacks look like

1394
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:08,230
on live television while you watched 
them?

1395
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:12,550
There's almost nothing positive that 
comes out of something like that,

1396
01:23:12,551 --> 01:23:16,780
but one of the few things that was in my
mind was as you watched it,

1397
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:22,350
you were reminded that the most 
astonishing things not only can happen 

1398
01:23:22,961 --> 01:23:25,030
but will happen.
They're like earthquakes.

1399
01:23:25,031 --> 01:23:30,031
You know there's going to be a big one.
You just don't know when you know 

1400
01:23:30,031 --> 01:23:32,500
there's going to be some massive jaw 
dropping historical event in the future.

1401
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:35,290
You just don't know the date ahead of 
time,

1402
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:37,450
like a nine slash 11,
but when you watch that happening,

1403
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:41,230
that astonishment is how mankind has 
failed over and over and over again.

1404
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:46,650
As you look back on it,
there's about to be an astonishing 

1405
01:23:46,650 --> 01:23:47,560
moment in this story.
It's not really a moment,

1406
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:52,210
five to 15 years.
It just appears astonishing now,

1407
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:55,330
but it's akin to the United States 
imploding.

1408
01:23:55,960 --> 01:24:00,960
Really.
I think it's more than the Soviet Union 

1409
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:00,960
falling,
but a little less than the modern United

1410
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:01,930
States going away.
Nonetheless,

1411
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:04,600
if the United States did go away in the 
next five years,

1412
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:10,350
what does the international situation 
look like then mean what world instantly

1413
01:24:11,801 --> 01:24:15,670
springs up to replace such an important 
cog and how does that go?

1414
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:22,080
This is actually the world that is going
to exist as soon as this story that must

1415
01:24:23,681 --> 01:24:24,480
be,
you know,

1416
01:24:24,490 --> 01:24:26,560
one of the great events in all human 
history,

1417
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:31,330
but we don't know because we don't have 
a [inaudible] there to give it even with

1418
01:24:31,331 --> 01:24:36,331
a bunch of lies and exaggerations and 
untruths that may have filtered in over 

1419
01:24:36,331 --> 01:24:37,480
the hundreds of years.
We don't have his version or anyone like

1420
01:24:37,481 --> 01:24:40,630
him to explain it to us.
We liked the color.

1421
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:42,210
I brought at this,
by the way,

1422
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:47,220
promised he was going to tell this story
in one part of his histories and then 

1423
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:49,930
never did or didn't come down to us or 
something.

1424
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:54,760
Have a few tourists,
Babylonian sources and that's it.

1425
01:24:54,850 --> 01:24:59,850
In fact,
the stuff you thought you could count 

1426
01:24:59,850 --> 01:24:59,850
on,
like those wonderful Assyrian,

1427
01:24:59,850 --> 01:25:01,210
you know,
pronouncements by the king of kings.

1428
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:03,100
I went in there,
I planted thorn bushes.

1429
01:25:03,101 --> 01:25:05,860
I killed everybody.
That ends in like 6:30,

1430
01:25:05,861 --> 01:25:07,570
nine bce,
ominously,

1431
01:25:07,571 --> 01:25:11,440
and mysteriously all of a sudden,
what the heck's going on?

1432
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:15,460
I love the different ways that 
historians try to describe this to.

1433
01:25:15,461 --> 01:25:18,100
One one historian says it was unclear 
what was happening.

1434
01:25:19,090 --> 01:25:23,740
Author Mark Healey explained the 
importance though of this period silence

1435
01:25:23,741 --> 01:25:28,741
because he says quote,
and it is in the silence of those years 

1436
01:25:28,741 --> 01:25:29,770
that is written the fate of the Assyrian
Empire,

1437
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:34,810
and so the important stuff is happening.
We just don't know much of what it is.

1438
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:38,830
Open to interpretation is how another 
historian put it,

1439
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:42,650
but here's what basically goes on.
Osher,

1440
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:44,050
bond,
I Paul's rain.

1441
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:46,840
At the end,
you start to see things fraying.

1442
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:52,280
It begin to see places that were under a
serious control on the on the margins 

1443
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:56,521
break free.
A lot of historians think that it's 

1444
01:25:56,521 --> 01:25:59,911
rather telling that all of a sudden you 
can have these skiffy and tribes riding 

1445
01:25:59,911 --> 01:26:01,420
rough now in areas where the Assyrians 
used to keep them out.

1446
01:26:01,421 --> 01:26:04,130
It must mean that they can't.
While no

1447
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:09,130
one is really paying a lot of attention.
The medes are beginning to fuse sort of 

1448
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:14,051
ends,
and it's unclear how they did this with 

1449
01:26:14,051 --> 01:26:14,051
the elamites.
Civilization.

1450
01:26:14,051 --> 01:26:15,200
Could have been peaceful,
could been warlike,

1451
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:20,560
could've been diplomatic marriage,
but it's making both civilization 

1452
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,500
stronger.
And Osher,

1453
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:27,140
Bonnie Paul dies and his sons go to war 
with each other.

1454
01:26:28,370 --> 01:26:33,370
Now,
this is not uncommon in Assyrian royal 

1455
01:26:33,370 --> 01:26:36,350
succession,
but this is coming at a particularly bad

1456
01:26:36,351 --> 01:26:41,030
time because all of a sudden the 
Babylonians are resurgent again.

1457
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:45,710
They've got a new dynasty.
They've got an army that is modeled.

1458
01:26:45,711 --> 01:26:46,140
It's,
it's,

1459
01:26:46,190 --> 01:26:46,480
it's,
uh,

1460
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:50,060
not as effective copy of the Assyrians,
the Assyrians copy,

1461
01:26:50,061 --> 01:26:53,990
the Babylonian civilization not quite as
well as the Babylonian original.

1462
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:56,540
And the Babylonians copied the Assyrian 
military.

1463
01:26:56,541 --> 01:26:59,390
Though it's not quite up to the 
originals standards either,

1464
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:04,040
but when you've been fighting one half 
of your army against the other,

1465
01:27:04,041 --> 01:27:05,900
which is what the Assyrians were doing 
in a civil war,

1466
01:27:05,901 --> 01:27:07,180
that's why they're so ruinous.

1467
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:09,980
You know,
you have outside powers starting to loom

1468
01:27:09,981 --> 01:27:11,660
over you.
And what do you do with your army?

1469
01:27:11,661 --> 01:27:13,880
You divide it in half and fight it 
against each other.

1470
01:27:14,150 --> 01:27:19,150
Worse possible thing that could happen.
And then the Babylonians starting in 

1471
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:21,770
about 6:16,
start sending out an army,

1472
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:26,780
taking some of these border cities 
between Assyria and Babylon,

1473
01:27:27,470 --> 01:27:29,990
and then the war heats up a little bit 
in there fighting back and forth,

1474
01:27:29,991 --> 01:27:32,960
and the Assyrian Army seems to be a 
shadow of its former self.

1475
01:27:32,961 --> 01:27:37,961
But you could see how strong it still is
because they're holding their own 

1476
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:38,570
against these Babylonians,
pushing them back,

1477
01:27:38,571 --> 01:27:42,680
sometimes chasing them back sometimes,
but it's all they can handle.

1478
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:48,460
And then in like six slash 15 bce,
the medes jump in from the east and the 

1479
01:27:50,301 --> 01:27:54,380
north,
they start taking cities in the east.

1480
01:27:55,610 --> 01:27:58,910
The next year,
the medes come forward under their king,

1481
01:27:58,911 --> 01:28:02,250
see accessories and advances on,
you know,

1482
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:04,610
one of the capitals,
Nineveh,

1483
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:08,870
they can't take it because Nineveh is 
this massively fortified,

1484
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:14,230
probably the most fortified city west of
China in this whole human history up to 

1485
01:28:14,661 --> 01:28:15,140
this point.

1486
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:17,060
I mean,
just an incredible feat.

1487
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:21,050
Human Marvel and it pushes these means 
sideways.

1488
01:28:21,051 --> 01:28:24,980
They just can't deal with it right now.
But unfortunately for the Assyrians,

1489
01:28:24,981 --> 01:28:27,560
if you can't go out there and defeat 
that muddy and army,

1490
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:32,980
they can do whatever they want so they 
go sack in nearby city that's not as 

1491
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:34,970
well defended.
It just happens to be one of the great,

1492
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:36,440
you know,
once upon a time,

1493
01:28:36,441 --> 01:28:41,441
a Syrian capitals vital,
connected to their religion and their 

1494
01:28:41,441 --> 01:28:44,090
God and and morale and everything else.
It's a big deal.

1495
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:50,380
At the last minute,
the Babylonians run up to be a part of 

1496
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:50,380
it.
This is a famous event.

1497
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:50,380
They,
they,

1498
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:54,440
they don't want to allow the media to 
take this important city by themselves,

1499
01:28:54,441 --> 01:28:56,540
be left out of the spoils,
the reputation,

1500
01:28:56,541 --> 01:29:01,541
everything,
but they arrived too late with their 

1501
01:29:01,541 --> 01:29:01,680
army.
The means of already the place,

1502
01:29:01,681 --> 01:29:02,220
maybe

1503
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:05,610
rushing the attempt so that they'd beat 
the Babylonians mayor.

1504
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:08,370
They treated the way the Assyrians would
have treated it,

1505
01:29:08,371 --> 01:29:13,371
and it's a horrific event.
The Babylonian King and the Medean king 

1506
01:29:15,930 --> 01:29:20,930
pledged their friendship to each other.
As osher burns in the background and the

1507
01:29:21,870 --> 01:29:25,560
killing continues in,
the slaves are being dragged off and all

1508
01:29:25,561 --> 01:29:30,561
of a sudden a week into Syria has 
Babylon and the medes working together 

1509
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:37,110
and advancing on Nineveh in six,
12 bcee.

1510
01:29:38,970 --> 01:29:42,330
If this wasn't bad enough at the last 
minutes,

1511
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:47,360
allegedly not everybody says this,
but the standard belief is at the last 

1512
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:48,670
minute,
a horde of skiff,

1513
01:29:48,671 --> 01:29:53,671
Ian's in a rides in the wild northern 
horsemen and joins both the medes and 

1514
01:29:55,021 --> 01:30:00,021
the Babylonians in this last assault 
upon this greatest of West Asian 

1515
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:06,090
military fortresses,
and together they take it down,

1516
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:10,440
had to fight three battles on the 
plains,

1517
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:14,520
supposedly before they even got a chance
to get near the walls with this last old

1518
01:30:14,521 --> 01:30:18,180
aging damage,
lion of a serious swatting them away and

1519
01:30:18,181 --> 01:30:20,820
fighting well as long as they could

1520
01:30:22,330 --> 01:30:27,330
the Babylonian king in the terse style.
You know that those people wrote in,

1521
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:32,110
described what he did to what he calls 
the land of [inaudible],

1522
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:35,230
which is their word for Syria.
And by the way,

1523
01:30:35,231 --> 01:30:39,670
notice how he's couching this in terms 
of liberation from the,

1524
01:30:39,910 --> 01:30:41,350
you know,
a Syrian yoke.

1525
01:30:41,380 --> 01:30:42,010
The record,
say,

1526
01:30:42,011 --> 01:30:45,190
quote,
I slaughtered the land of [inaudible].

1527
01:30:45,370 --> 01:30:50,370
I turned the hostile land into heaps and
ruins the Assyrian who since distant 

1528
01:30:50,591 --> 01:30:55,591
days had ruled over all the peoples and 
with his heavy yoke brought injury to 

1529
01:30:55,591 --> 01:30:57,940
the people of the land,
his feet from a cod.

1530
01:30:57,941 --> 01:31:02,110
I turned back his yoke.
I threw off and quote,

1531
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:08,640
and you have a basic problem when,
when discussing events of the past like 

1532
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:12,661
this,
if we're discussing something from 

1533
01:31:12,661 --> 01:31:12,661
recent history,
say the end of the third,

1534
01:31:12,661 --> 01:31:14,110
right,
hit the second world war,

1535
01:31:14,410 --> 01:31:17,140
all that emotion is still felt right.

1536
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:20,620
You get a real feel for the kinds of 
things historians don't want to touch.

1537
01:31:20,621 --> 01:31:25,621
Once you get back a certain distance,
some day they're not going to look at 

1538
01:31:25,621 --> 01:31:28,360
the Nazis as the kind of evil that we 
do.

1539
01:31:28,810 --> 01:31:31,570
They're going to somehow say,
well,

1540
01:31:31,571 --> 01:31:35,590
they were on the far end of the spectrum
of what people did then,

1541
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:38,830
which is kind of what a lot of modern 
ones would say about a Syria.

1542
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:42,160
They're not doing anything anybody else 
isn't doing.

1543
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:45,460
They just may be at the far end of the 
spectrum of,

1544
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:46,960
you know,
conduct.

1545
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:49,540
It's all kind of relative,
right,

1546
01:31:50,620 --> 01:31:55,620
but you could certainly see the anger 
and vengeance in the people that goes 

1547
01:31:56,981 --> 01:31:58,340
beyond mere,
you know,

1548
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:00,070
the taking of and slaves

1549
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:03,040
and the things that have motivated 
soldiers sometimes in the heat of battle

1550
01:32:03,041 --> 01:32:07,090
at all times.
This involved some payback

1551
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:09,570
story.
Mark Vandy,

1552
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:14,590
Maru explains that you can still see at 
vengeance today mean there's an eternal 

1553
01:32:15,501 --> 01:32:18,230
bit of payback that was done.
He writes,

1554
01:32:18,231 --> 01:32:23,231
quote,
the conquerors set out to destroy the 

1555
01:32:23,231 --> 01:32:25,220
cities of Assyria,
taking revenge for the humiliations they

1556
01:32:25,221 --> 01:32:28,700
had suffered a serious hands on wall 
reliefs of kings,

1557
01:32:28,820 --> 01:32:31,250
Senaca Reeb and Asher,
Bonnie Paul in Nineveh,

1558
01:32:31,251 --> 01:32:36,251
for example.
They identified the representations of 

1559
01:32:36,251 --> 01:32:38,540
the kings with the help of the 
inscriptions accompany them and ritually

1560
01:32:38,541 --> 01:32:41,630
destroyed them by cutting out the ears 
and eyes.

1561
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:46,710
These were not random acts of mutilation
in the detailed depiction of Asha Bonnie

1562
01:32:46,710 --> 01:32:48,470
Paul's defeated the Elamites,
for example,

1563
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:53,680
only the face of a soldier cutting off 
the head of the king of Ilan was 

1564
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:57,281
similarly destroyed probably by the 
medes who saw the elamites as their 

1565
01:32:57,281 --> 01:32:58,400
ancestors.
Likewise,

1566
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:03,520
the records of loyalty oaths that King 
Esr had on had forced Medea and body 

1567
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:07,280
guards to swear and which had been 
stored at cal who were smashed.

1568
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:12,520
The palaces were burnt down only after 
the lengthy task of defacing images and 

1569
01:33:12,591 --> 01:33:17,270
destroying symbols of submission to a 
Syria had been completed and quote.

1570
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:22,140
If you go to the British Museum today 
and look at the Assyrian reliefs,

1571
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:27,210
you can see,
you know the defacing done by some angry

1572
01:33:27,211 --> 01:33:32,211
vengeful and probably rightfully so 
soldier as they took down with Syria 

1573
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:37,940
piece by piece,
but stunningly quickly by historical 

1574
01:33:37,940 --> 01:33:37,940
standards.

1575
01:33:38,190 --> 01:33:42,150
And while there may be no hurghada tests
to give color to this story,

1576
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:46,530
there is one of the most,
I guess for military history fans,

1577
01:33:46,770 --> 01:33:51,770
one of the most colorful sections of the
Old Testament of the Bible that deals 

1578
01:33:51,770 --> 01:33:56,180
with the fall of the Syria and I'm sure 
a Syrian descendants and people who are 

1579
01:33:56,180 --> 01:34:00,900
big Assyrian fans think this is very 
unfair sort of propaganda.

1580
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:03,780
Again,
it's just they're bad luck to get bad pr

1581
01:34:03,781 --> 01:34:08,781
sometimes in the Bible and the biblical 
Prophet Niamh was prophesizing 

1582
01:34:08,781 --> 01:34:11,760
supposedly that you're going to get it.
And then once they did get it,

1583
01:34:11,761 --> 01:34:13,050
he was sort of saying,
see,

1584
01:34:13,051 --> 01:34:18,051
this is what you get.
Now what's kind of interesting about 

1585
01:34:18,051 --> 01:34:18,051
nay,
unlike some of these other prophets,

1586
01:34:18,051 --> 01:34:22,521
it's,
there's a decent chance he was a 

1587
01:34:22,521 --> 01:34:24,441
contemporary.
A lot of this stuff was put together in 

1588
01:34:24,441 --> 01:34:24,480
the hellenistic period later,
you know,

1589
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:27,810
from earlier stories are all kinds of 
things dealing with that era.

1590
01:34:28,110 --> 01:34:31,800
But some of this goes back and it's 
tough to know and historians argue,

1591
01:34:31,801 --> 01:34:36,801
but it's possible that this prophet 
named guy was maybe even a predecessor 

1592
01:34:36,810 --> 01:34:38,370
to some of these events.
So who knows,

1593
01:34:38,371 --> 01:34:39,870
you know,
I won't get into something like that.

1594
01:34:39,871 --> 01:34:43,590
I just found it interesting because when
he recounts what happens,

1595
01:34:43,591 --> 01:34:48,591
first of all,
he gives you the color and tells you a 

1596
01:34:48,591 --> 01:34:49,500
little bit about the story in a,
in a religious sort of framework.

1597
01:34:49,550 --> 01:34:52,380
Still doesn't sound like Hurghada just 
there's a religious tone to it.

1598
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:56,220
But at the same time it's very colorful.
So he describes,

1599
01:34:56,221 --> 01:35:01,221
for example,
you know what the battle is like after 

1600
01:35:01,221 --> 01:35:04,091
prophesizing,
that you're going to get it for a long 

1601
01:35:04,091 --> 01:35:04,091
time,
and he says,

1602
01:35:04,091 --> 01:35:06,761
quote,
he that shatters in pieces has come up 

1603
01:35:06,761 --> 01:35:10,181
against the guard,
the wall guard the way good thy loins 

1604
01:35:10,181 --> 01:35:11,480
make dice strength,
the utmost.

1605
01:35:11,690 --> 01:35:15,950
The Shield of his heroes is red.
His warriors are colliding scarlet.

1606
01:35:16,190 --> 01:35:19,850
They prepare the chariots today that 
cherry had horses are eager.

1607
01:35:20,030 --> 01:35:21,950
The Cherry,
it's rage in the field.

1608
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:27,100
They rushed to and fro in the plazas.
Their appearance is like that of 

1609
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:28,910
torches.
They dart about like lightning's.

1610
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:32,210
He reads out the list of his nobles in 
their eagerness.

1611
01:35:32,211 --> 01:35:34,790
They stumble,
they hastened to reach the walls.

1612
01:35:34,910 --> 01:35:39,640
The battering ram is made ready.
And then they,

1613
01:35:39,641 --> 01:35:42,980
um,
describes the unleashing of the rivers.

1614
01:35:42,981 --> 01:35:47,720
I guess the dams were broken or rerouted
or they reroute the course of the rivers

1615
01:35:47,721 --> 01:35:49,520
or what have you to help undermine the 
walls.

1616
01:35:49,521 --> 01:35:52,820
That's not that unusual a tactic.
But with a big city like this,

1617
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:57,050
not a small engineering feat.
And the prophet named says,

1618
01:35:57,051 --> 01:36:00,170
quote the reverse sluices or opened the 
palace,

1619
01:36:00,171 --> 01:36:03,410
walls are crumbling.
The Queen is stripped of her clothing.

1620
01:36:03,530 --> 01:36:05,360
They are leading her away captive.

1621
01:36:05,570 --> 01:36:09,050
Her handmaidens Moan like doves,
upon their breasts,

1622
01:36:09,051 --> 01:36:12,590
they are beating Nineveh was a tank of 
water from it.

1623
01:36:12,591 --> 01:36:15,440
They are now escaping stand,
stand.

1624
01:36:15,441 --> 01:36:20,441
They cry,
not one of them looks backward and then 

1625
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:24,521
he basically tells everybody to take 
back the stuff that a Syria took from 

1626
01:36:24,521 --> 01:36:27,320
them and that their housing in this 
immensely wealthy city.

1627
01:36:27,321 --> 01:36:28,100
He says,
quote,

1628
01:36:28,370 --> 01:36:32,150
take either spoil of silver,
take either spoil of gold.

1629
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:36,470
There is no end to the store and 
abundance of all goodly objects.

1630
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:39,830
She is empty and void and waste hearts 
melt,

1631
01:36:39,980 --> 01:36:43,370
knees shake.
There is pain in all loins and Pale.

1632
01:36:43,371 --> 01:36:48,371
Have waxed all the faces and then he 
does a little trash talk,

1633
01:36:49,401 --> 01:36:50,800
gloating,
you know,

1634
01:36:50,830 --> 01:36:51,680
where he says,
where are the,

1635
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:56,720
you know,
great lions now and all the people who 

1636
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:57,620
took all this stuff.
And then like again,

1637
01:36:57,621 --> 01:37:01,190
so many of the people during this era,
this was seen to involve,

1638
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:06,640
you know,
a little proof that their God was 

1639
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:06,640
superior.

1640
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:09,440
Or in the case of some of these people,
by this point in history,

1641
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:14,500
the only God a name says,
behold I am against thee,

1642
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:19,250
says y'all way of hosts that I layer I 
will burn with smoke.

1643
01:37:19,430 --> 01:37:21,590
They're young.
The sword shall devour.

1644
01:37:21,650 --> 01:37:22,640
I will cut off,
die,

1645
01:37:22,650 --> 01:37:24,800
pray from the earth.
No more be heard.

1646
01:37:24,801 --> 01:37:29,801
They messengers voices and he continues 
to rub it in and basically blame this on

1647
01:37:31,850 --> 01:37:36,850
Karma if you will.
Woe to the bloody city full of lies and 

1648
01:37:37,071 --> 01:37:39,950
robbery,
the crack of the whip and the thunder of

1649
01:37:39,951 --> 01:37:44,951
the rumbling.
We'll the prancing horse and the 

1650
01:37:44,951 --> 01:37:47,381
bounding chariot,
the horseman mounting and the flash of 

1651
01:37:47,381 --> 01:37:49,970
stored the gleam of spear and a massive 
slain a heap of corpses.

1652
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:55,060
There are no end to the dead bodies for 
the many infidelities of the well 

1653
01:37:55,060 --> 01:37:56,010
favorite,
the

1654
01:37:56,010 --> 01:38:01,010
mistress of incantations who sold states
for her wicked deeds and clans through 

1655
01:38:01,981 --> 01:38:04,230
her incantations.
Behold say,

1656
01:38:04,231 --> 01:38:06,780
if the outweigh of host I am against 
thee,

1657
01:38:06,930 --> 01:38:11,780
I will strip the UAE clothing and show 
that I shamed the nation's filth.

1658
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:16,470
I will cast upon thee and disgraced the.
I will set the up as a warning.

1659
01:38:16,710 --> 01:38:21,000
All who see the shall flee shall cry,
desolate Nineveh,

1660
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:26,120
who shall be whale her end quote.
Well listen,

1661
01:38:26,271 --> 01:38:31,271
they may not have a ton of dramatic 
stuff from the Near East during this 

1662
01:38:31,271 --> 01:38:32,900
time period,
but that's awesome.

1663
01:38:32,990 --> 01:38:37,990
I mean all history aside,
that's awesome stuff and it does give 

1664
01:38:37,990 --> 01:38:40,190
you a feel for the emotion of the time 
period.

1665
01:38:40,191 --> 01:38:42,950
We may think you know that it's all been
drained,

1666
01:38:42,951 --> 01:38:47,951
but that's somebody who is clearly 
thinking that is Syria is reaping what 

1667
01:38:48,381 --> 01:38:50,730
she sewed.
Again,

1668
01:38:50,731 --> 01:38:55,710
I pity the poor Syrian people who have 
to live with one piece of horrible pr,

1669
01:38:55,711 --> 01:39:00,711
making it down through the errors,
the most widely read book in history in 

1670
01:39:00,711 --> 01:39:02,250
Europe.
People get some negative pr in it.

1671
01:39:03,570 --> 01:39:07,680
The last two Syrian king is rumored is a
good way to put it.

1672
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:13,070
There's not enough information to know 
on this is rumored to have as the enemy 

1673
01:39:13,070 --> 01:39:17,721
was closing in pile all of his worldly 
possessions that were in his palace 

1674
01:39:18,151 --> 01:39:23,151
around him and the gold and the silver 
and have family members killed and unix 

1675
01:39:23,151 --> 01:39:23,940
and concubines thrown on.
You know,

1676
01:39:23,941 --> 01:39:24,410
the,
the,

1677
01:39:24,430 --> 01:39:29,430
the pile of stuff with him.
And then have it all set a light with 

1678
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:30,900
him sitting in the middle of it.
There's a scene like that in the Lord of

1679
01:39:30,901 --> 01:39:32,880
the rings to apparently in this time 
period.

1680
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:38,240
It happened a few times,
probably it was a Motif they certainly 

1681
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:41,631
referred back to for a short time and a 
Siri and successors state.

1682
01:39:42,681 --> 01:39:45,920
Maybe you could call it,
maybe you could call it the last gasp of

1683
01:39:45,921 --> 01:39:47,810
resistance.
Tried to make a stand,

1684
01:39:47,811 --> 01:39:48,470
but by six,
oh,

1685
01:39:48,471 --> 01:39:53,471
five.
That was destroyed to and the Assyrians 

1686
01:39:53,471 --> 01:39:55,190
will turn into a people that never 
disappeared,

1687
01:39:55,910 --> 01:40:00,910
but who's destruction was so massive and
so sustained and so total that they seem

1688
01:40:01,761 --> 01:40:02,450
like they did.

1689
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:07,010
You will hear a Syrians trying to tell 
the world,

1690
01:40:07,011 --> 01:40:12,011
still today we're still here and try to 
fight that idea that every last one of 

1691
01:40:12,011 --> 01:40:14,720
them was killed in the,
in their version of a holocaust.

1692
01:40:14,721 --> 01:40:15,980
You know,
at the end of that era.

1693
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:18,050
Well,
it's not true,

1694
01:40:18,110 --> 01:40:21,920
but you could certainly say that within 
a very short period of time,

1695
01:40:22,460 --> 01:40:24,260
those massive,
you know,

1696
01:40:24,290 --> 01:40:29,290
top of their era cities and fortresses.
We're almost unrecognizable in a famous 

1697
01:40:31,461 --> 01:40:36,461
passage.
The Greek General xenophon with his 

1698
01:40:36,461 --> 01:40:39,641
10,000
Greeks fleeing a Persian civil war will 

1699
01:40:39,641 --> 01:40:42,410
get chased all the way through what's 
now northern Iraq.

1700
01:40:43,610 --> 01:40:48,610
He will come upon these great massive 
cities by their standards of the day,

1701
01:40:49,790 --> 01:40:50,990
simply,
you know,

1702
01:40:50,991 --> 01:40:53,740
rotting in the dust,
deserted,

1703
01:40:54,950 --> 01:40:59,950
but the walls are so high and the 
workmanship on the streets and 

1704
01:40:59,950 --> 01:41:04,841
everything so modern that he doesn't 
understand where it came from.

1705
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:07,580
The locals don't know anything about a 
Syria.

1706
01:41:07,581 --> 01:41:10,070
They think the medes built it.
In other words,

1707
01:41:10,090 --> 01:41:13,340
within 200 years these cities are lying 
in ruins,

1708
01:41:13,590 --> 01:41:18,590
are still larger than almost anything 
new being built at that time and nobody 

1709
01:41:18,590 --> 01:41:23,471
even remembers that they were a Syrian.
The account by xenophon of these ghost 

1710
01:41:26,670 --> 01:41:27,870
cities.
By the way,

1711
01:41:28,980 --> 01:41:33,980
I've spoken about them before.
It's the ultimate statue of liberty in 

1712
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:38,091
the sand sort of historical moment.
You know what I mean when I say that 

1713
01:41:38,091 --> 01:41:38,220
right?
The end of the planet,

1714
01:41:38,221 --> 01:41:43,221
of the apes where Charlton Heston 
believes he's been on a distant planet 

1715
01:41:43,221 --> 01:41:43,680
the whole time and the very last scene 
in the movie,

1716
01:41:43,950 --> 01:41:46,030
he looks into the distance,
you know,

1717
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:51,040
with the surf crashing against it,
he sees the statue of Liberty three 

1718
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:52,530
quarters buried in the sand.

1719
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:58,230
If you could take an Assyrian individual
from three,

1720
01:41:58,231 --> 01:42:03,231
four,
500 years before xenophon lived and 

1721
01:42:03,231 --> 01:42:07,401
bring him forward or her forward in a 
time machine so that she could hang out 

1722
01:42:07,401 --> 01:42:08,120
there,
you know,

1723
01:42:08,190 --> 01:42:12,830
by the ruins of Nineveh with xenophon 
and what,

1724
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:14,310
what,
what were run through her head,

1725
01:42:14,311 --> 01:42:19,311
what would run through your head if you 
could go forward in a time machine and 

1726
01:42:19,311 --> 01:42:20,880
see our ghost cities someday.

1727
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:24,770
And I marveled at the size.
I mean 200 years later,

1728
01:42:25,070 --> 01:42:27,680
xenophon says,
and he can't really lie.

1729
01:42:27,681 --> 01:42:29,880
There's a lot of people who know,
you know,

1730
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:33,380
what xenophon's talking about here and 
have seen it and could call him a liar.

1731
01:42:33,590 --> 01:42:35,960
I mean he says the base of the 
fortification,

1732
01:42:35,961 --> 01:42:40,961
he's camping bias.
Fifty feet broad and 50 feet high and 

1733
01:42:40,961 --> 01:42:45,821
then has a brick wall 50 feet broad.
And another hundred feet high on top of 

1734
01:42:47,451 --> 01:42:52,451
that and the circumference of the 
fortifications is 18 miles.

1735
01:42:54,110 --> 01:42:55,760
He says there are some people sort of,
you know,

1736
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:01,000
little like refugees and small villages 
and semi-nomadic groups of people 

1737
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:05,831
camping by.
But that city used to have hundreds of 

1738
01:43:05,831 --> 01:43:08,600
thousands,
maybe a million people living there.

1739
01:43:09,710 --> 01:43:14,710
That's a ghost city from a dead era by 
the times and uh,

1740
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:20,180
funds.
They're only a couple of hundred years 

1741
01:43:20,180 --> 01:43:20,180
later.
And when a series of falls,

1742
01:43:20,540 --> 01:43:22,550
it's like that moment we spoke about 
earlier,

1743
01:43:22,551 --> 01:43:26,390
what would happen if the United States 
disappeared in five or 15 years?

1744
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:29,270
What's the world then look like without 
that,

1745
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:34,500
you know,
senator spoke of the wagon wheel 

1746
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:36,581
anymore.
It's hard even to think for people born 

1747
01:43:36,581 --> 01:43:39,191
in the last 20,
30 years maybe of any other sort of 

1748
01:43:39,191 --> 01:43:41,570
reality.
Maybe that's the case for the people who

1749
01:43:41,571 --> 01:43:44,090
lived through it,
maybe they were blinking and just waking

1750
01:43:44,091 --> 01:43:49,091
up to a new day.
It really does have sort of an end of 

1751
01:43:49,091 --> 01:43:52,001
the Second World War.
So to feel like everything's been 

1752
01:43:52,001 --> 01:43:52,250
devastated in whole bunch of people

1753
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:57,250
who had allied together for this common 
interest of taking down the Assyrian 

1754
01:43:57,770 --> 01:44:02,770
Empire.
We're now staring over the rubble 

1755
01:44:02,770 --> 01:44:02,770
wondering who gets what and all of a 
sudden,

1756
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:06,920
like in 1946 in a Europe,
especially,

1757
01:44:06,921 --> 01:44:10,370
allies were turning into potential 
adversaries very quickly.

1758
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:16,420
There were four know.
If we look at this as a encapsulated 

1759
01:44:16,420 --> 01:44:18,620
little micro world here,
geopolitically speaking,

1760
01:44:18,621 --> 01:44:23,621
which is how I look at these stories.
Sorry for all you folks who'd like a 

1761
01:44:23,621 --> 01:44:26,360
little bit more culture or religion.
Nonetheless in this geopolitical setup,

1762
01:44:26,361 --> 01:44:28,820
we really have four great powers.
Now you go from one,

1763
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:31,250
hey,
hegemonic power,

1764
01:44:31,310 --> 01:44:35,390
Syria to Babylon,
picking up a lot of,

1765
01:44:35,391 --> 01:44:37,430
uh,
Syrian territory in this whole deal.

1766
01:44:37,490 --> 01:44:42,490
By the way,
you'll also have the medes obviously 

1767
01:44:42,490 --> 01:44:42,490
doing the same thing.
You know,

1768
01:44:42,490 --> 01:44:44,540
moving into territory in the north of 
Syria,

1769
01:44:44,541 --> 01:44:49,541
owned.
You have Egypt always a great power if 

1770
01:44:49,541 --> 01:44:51,140
they can be,
but not that long ago,

1771
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:56,350
you know,
under Syrian domination like everyone 

1772
01:44:56,350 --> 01:44:56,630
else,
they start moving towards the modern day

1773
01:44:56,750 --> 01:44:59,930
area around Israel and in there.

1774
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:02,300
And they are a player.
And finally,

1775
01:45:02,301 --> 01:45:07,301
if at fourth power called Lydia,
Lydia is the power that's now in modern 

1776
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:11,600
day Turkey for the most part,
like everyone else,

1777
01:45:11,601 --> 01:45:13,790
they benefited from the Assyrians going 
away.

1778
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:16,550
They were able to move and expand into 
other areas.

1779
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:22,120
They are generally credited with the 
one's inventing metal money at least in 

1780
01:45:23,841 --> 01:45:28,841
the western world.
And you will begin to see at least in 

1781
01:45:29,061 --> 01:45:34,061
the longterm view of things,
all sorts of conflicts breaking out now 

1782
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:38,180
as all these new powers sort of vie with
each other.

1783
01:45:39,230 --> 01:45:41,420
The Egyptians and the Babylonians for 
example,

1784
01:45:41,421 --> 01:45:42,710
we'll go at it,
you know,

1785
01:45:42,740 --> 01:45:44,630
several times trying to figure out,
you know,

1786
01:45:44,690 --> 01:45:47,180
is anybody gonna Conquer anybody?
Where's the border going to be?

1787
01:45:47,181 --> 01:45:51,020
And all that kind of stuff.
And a lot of the littler states just get

1788
01:45:51,021 --> 01:45:56,021
totally screwed in this deal.
It's a little like the cold war where 

1789
01:45:56,021 --> 01:45:59,951
some states in the middle try to decide,
do I side with the Soviets or do I side 

1790
01:45:59,951 --> 01:45:59,951
with the Western?

1791
01:45:59,951 --> 01:46:02,660
And then if you screw up,
all kinds of bad things can happen.

1792
01:46:02,661 --> 01:46:05,210
That's exactly what happened to poor 
Judah.

1793
01:46:05,870 --> 01:46:10,870
That was sacked by the Babylonian King.
During this era for continually swaying 

1794
01:46:12,441 --> 01:46:15,560
sort of between the two powers that were
vying for them,

1795
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:17,780
Babylon on one side and Egypt on the 
other,

1796
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:22,490
and finally exasperating the Babylonian 
king to the breaking point.

1797
01:46:24,110 --> 01:46:29,110
There are Jews in Iraq today whose 
ancestors were a part of the Babylonian 

1798
01:46:30,561 --> 01:46:31,790
King,
you know,

1799
01:46:31,820 --> 01:46:34,850
taking them out of the city of Judah 
that he was just destroying.

1800
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:40,240
That's where by the way,
Solomon's temple was destroyed by the 

1801
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:41,210
Babylonians.
Again,

1802
01:46:41,211 --> 01:46:46,211
earning them bad pr in one of the most 
important per books of all time.

1803
01:46:48,110 --> 01:46:53,110
The medes will scare the Babylonians to 
the point where the Babylonians will 

1804
01:46:53,110 --> 01:46:57,060
build something called the median wall 
to hopefully slow them down.

1805
01:46:57,480 --> 01:47:01,470
And xenophile installed that to about 
150 years later.

1806
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:07,400
It was a wall that supposedly ran across
the narrow part of the division between 

1807
01:47:07,741 --> 01:47:11,100
the Tigris and Euphrates river.
So you'd have the river on two sides and

1808
01:47:11,101 --> 01:47:16,101
then this wall in the middle and 
xenophon says that 200 years later it 

1809
01:47:16,101 --> 01:47:20,361
was made a burnt bricks laid in bitumen.
It was 20 feet thick,

1810
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:25,050
a hundred feet high and said to be 60 
miles long.

1811
01:47:25,051 --> 01:47:29,520
It is quite close to Babylon and quote 
again,

1812
01:47:29,521 --> 01:47:34,521
if he's lying about that,
there's a lot of people who would know 

1813
01:47:34,521 --> 01:47:34,521
that he was,
he'd have a reputation for that,

1814
01:47:34,521 --> 01:47:39,051
that would follow him unto our own time.
Now the medes will famously go to war 

1815
01:47:42,150 --> 01:47:47,150
with the Lydians and this is when some 
of her [inaudible] really Hurghada test 

1816
01:47:47,820 --> 01:47:49,320
has a little bit of,
um,

1817
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:54,590
a horror story and Alfred Hitchcock side
to him sometimes or maybe just the 

1818
01:47:55,711 --> 01:48:00,711
people he talks to happen to because 
during this little period which will 

1819
01:48:00,711 --> 01:48:04,971
really only last like 40,
45 years between the fall of the 

1820
01:48:04,971 --> 01:48:08,270
Assyrians and the rise of the Persians,
there's going to be incidents that are 

1821
01:48:08,270 --> 01:48:11,640
eerily similar and you start to wonder 
whether the guide telling you about them

1822
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:16,760
or the people existing in this era have 
a certain weakness for that sort of 

1823
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:16,760
incident.

1824
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:18,330
In this case,
Heraclitus says,

1825
01:48:18,450 --> 01:48:21,960
this is how the war with the medes and 
the Lydian started.

1826
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:27,560
There were some skiff.
Ian's who were hunters for the Medean 

1827
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:29,520
king,
that guy see accessories,

1828
01:48:29,521 --> 01:48:32,550
right?
And normally they'd bring back food,

1829
01:48:32,551 --> 01:48:36,990
but one time they show up,
Heraclitus says empty handed in front of

1830
01:48:37,290 --> 01:48:40,200
the accessories,
who supposedly Hurghada test says,

1831
01:48:40,201 --> 01:48:42,870
has this awful temper freaks out and 
starts abusing,

1832
01:48:42,871 --> 01:48:47,871
including so physical abuse.
One must imagined him kicking maybe 

1833
01:48:47,871 --> 01:48:49,690
these skinny and archers.
Now the skiff,

1834
01:48:49,691 --> 01:48:54,691
Ian's were never known to have 
particularly non excitable temperaments,

1835
01:48:55,740 --> 01:48:57,150
shall we put it that way?
Is that fair?

1836
01:48:58,050 --> 01:49:01,140
And Hurghada to says that they went and 
in their anger,

1837
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:06,440
killed one of the boys probably from the
royal court that the Medean king had 

1838
01:49:06,661 --> 01:49:09,670
sent to learn archery from these same 
skiff.

1839
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:10,890
Ian's wow,
they're great archers.

1840
01:49:10,891 --> 01:49:15,891
Let's send some of the royal boys out 
there and they can learn how to shoot 

1841
01:49:15,891 --> 01:49:17,460
bows like an ancient Eurasian Steppe 
Archer.

1842
01:49:18,030 --> 01:49:23,030
And they killed one of these boys Herata
to says and cut him up like the game 

1843
01:49:23,030 --> 01:49:25,380
that they normally give to the Medina 
king showed up,

1844
01:49:25,381 --> 01:49:27,360
gave him the food,
watched him eat it.

1845
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:32,460
Hahaha.
It's like putting urine into someone's 

1846
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:33,840
beer before you give it to them.
The king finds out,

1847
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:35,220
you know,
goes after them.

1848
01:49:35,221 --> 01:49:39,810
They run to Lydia and then the median 
king says,

1849
01:49:39,811 --> 01:49:42,960
I want those skit.
The ones who cut up that boy and made me

1850
01:49:42,961 --> 01:49:45,840
eat him and Herat at this says that the 
king of Lydia said,

1851
01:49:45,841 --> 01:49:47,530
no,
can't have him.

1852
01:49:47,710 --> 01:49:52,710
Boom war.
Now we'll run into Hurghada telling a 

1853
01:49:52,710 --> 01:49:56,461
similar story with an even greater 
psychological twist very soon after 

1854
01:49:56,461 --> 01:49:57,220
this.
Nonetheless,

1855
01:49:57,520 --> 01:50:00,700
this war with the medes and the Lydians 
have gone for like five years.

1856
01:50:00,810 --> 01:50:05,500
Hurghada to says,
and we'll end with an.

1857
01:50:05,610 --> 01:50:06,790
You know,
we have a fact here.

1858
01:50:06,791 --> 01:50:08,620
We can play with something that's real.
We don't have to say.

1859
01:50:08,621 --> 01:50:13,621
He says,
she says this historian claims we've 

1860
01:50:13,621 --> 01:50:15,811
heard from Herat at this.
There is a solar eclipse that happens on

1861
01:50:16,331 --> 01:50:18,100
May 28th,
five,

1862
01:50:18,101 --> 01:50:19,800
85 BC.
He

1863
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:24,410
and at the time that solar eclipse 
happened,

1864
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:29,800
which by the way Hurghada says a Greek 
predicted claiming it was the first time

1865
01:50:29,811 --> 01:50:33,350
that had ever been done.
I'm sure the Babylonians probably pulled

1866
01:50:33,351 --> 01:50:35,060
off a few of those correctly.
Who knows?

1867
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:41,260
Modern astronomers.
Of course I have no problem going back 

1868
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:44,620
and with precision.
Calculating the date of that past 

1869
01:50:44,620 --> 01:50:48,190
astronomical event,
which is why we have a rare confirmable 

1870
01:50:48,190 --> 01:50:50,750
fat at this point in the story,
but when that eclipse happened,

1871
01:50:51,230 --> 01:50:56,230
the medes and the Lydians happen to be 
fighting a battle and Hurghada to says,

1872
01:50:56,661 --> 01:50:59,360
as it was warming up,
as the battle was getting hot,

1873
01:50:59,870 --> 01:51:01,130
there goes the sun.

1874
01:51:02,590 --> 01:51:07,590
Now,
if you are an ancient person with the 

1875
01:51:07,590 --> 01:51:12,571
religious beliefs,
you must imagine many of these ancient 

1876
01:51:12,571 --> 01:51:15,811
people had.
There are few atheists in the ancient 

1877
01:51:15,811 --> 01:51:18,430
world and sometimes it can be very 
superstitious indeed,

1878
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:23,460
as you might imagine.
Now you're involved in a battle man 

1879
01:51:23,460 --> 01:51:23,740
killing man.
You know,

1880
01:51:23,741 --> 01:51:28,741
both sides of almost certainly had 
sacrifices and the omens examined and 

1881
01:51:28,781 --> 01:51:31,330
they're looking at the liver and saying,
is this a good day to attack?

1882
01:51:31,331 --> 01:51:36,331
And all these kinds of things,
and then in the middle of the battle of 

1883
01:51:36,331 --> 01:51:37,000
the sun goes out,
what are you going to think?

1884
01:51:38,290 --> 01:51:39,820
Well,
as you might imagine,

1885
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:44,380
the medes and the Lydian stopped 
fighting in the heat of the fighting.

1886
01:51:44,381 --> 01:51:48,490
They stopped fighting.
We're talking about tens of thousands of

1887
01:51:48,491 --> 01:51:51,310
people on each side and then everybody 
just stops.

1888
01:51:53,010 --> 01:51:56,070
That's the way it's portrayed anyway,
but think about it this way.

1889
01:51:56,310 --> 01:51:59,160
If an eclipse is really going to stop a 
battle,

1890
01:51:59,580 --> 01:52:02,550
it's going to happen fast because the 
eclipse doesn't last that long.

1891
01:52:03,570 --> 01:52:08,570
The piece was brokered.
We are told by another of the great 

1892
01:52:08,570 --> 01:52:10,290
powers,
Babylon and also the clique.

1893
01:52:10,291 --> 01:52:15,291
Ian's involved,
maybe you would call them a midsize 

1894
01:52:15,291 --> 01:52:16,110
power in that region.
Regional power in that part of the world

1895
01:52:16,770 --> 01:52:21,090
and the deal sealed.
We are told in the traditional way,

1896
01:52:21,091 --> 01:52:23,040
although the Greeks did it a little 
differently.

1897
01:52:23,041 --> 01:52:28,041
We're not told how both rulers slipped 
their skin and suck blood from each 

1898
01:52:28,411 --> 01:52:33,411
other.
Also gave daughters and whatnot in 

1899
01:52:33,411 --> 01:52:34,860
marriage.
That's the part I left out.

1900
01:52:34,861 --> 01:52:39,030
Two of the deal when the Babylonians and
the medes sign,

1901
01:52:39,031 --> 01:52:44,031
that agreement probably the same way,
a little vampiric blood sucking to go 

1902
01:52:44,031 --> 01:52:45,980
along with it outside of Asher.
They destroy that a

1903
01:52:45,990 --> 01:52:50,990
Syrian city.
They also married off daughters to each 

1904
01:52:50,990 --> 01:52:54,431
other and I mean it was one of these 
things where all of a sudden the 

1905
01:52:54,431 --> 01:52:56,471
families are related as though that's 
really going to stop anything given the 

1906
01:52:56,471 --> 01:52:56,840
history.
Nonetheless,

1907
01:52:56,841 --> 01:53:01,841
they did the exact same deal here,
got a few daughters we can spread 

1908
01:53:01,841 --> 01:53:01,940
around,
got some blood weaken,

1909
01:53:01,941 --> 01:53:02,860
suck,
and and,

1910
01:53:02,990 --> 01:53:04,970
and forever friends.

1911
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:11,520
That bottle is known as the battle of 
the Haley's river or the battle of the 

1912
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:15,361
eclipse sometimes.
Now one thing that it's worth pointing 

1913
01:53:15,491 --> 01:53:20,491
out from this period because it's going 
to matter in the north west and very 

1914
01:53:22,241 --> 01:53:26,470
west parts of modern day Turkey,
Anatolia,

1915
01:53:26,890 --> 01:53:31,890
as it was called earlier,
our settlements and villages and cities 

1916
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:36,880
of Greeks,
they're called Ionian Greeks,

1917
01:53:36,970 --> 01:53:40,070
but Greeks of one kind or another being,
you know,

1918
01:53:40,090 --> 01:53:45,090
such a seafaring,
people around that region head in a 

1919
01:53:45,090 --> 01:53:46,540
colonized that whole area a very long 
time ago.

1920
01:53:47,110 --> 01:53:49,480
And they had relationships with the 
Greeks,

1921
01:53:49,780 --> 01:53:51,910
you know,
on the mainland where places like Athens

1922
01:53:51,911 --> 01:53:52,930
are,
for example.

1923
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:55,570
You've got to imagine trade routes back 
and forth,

1924
01:53:55,571 --> 01:53:57,250
people going back and forth.
In fact,

1925
01:53:57,610 --> 01:54:02,610
the part of the Greek world that was 
located in modern day Turkey at this 

1926
01:54:02,610 --> 01:54:05,980
time was the more sophisticated,
the more cultured than more learned.

1927
01:54:06,380 --> 01:54:11,380
Uh,
the Greeks in Athens and Sparta might 

1928
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:11,380
say,
the more feminine,

1929
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:11,830
the more corrupted,
the more lazy,

1930
01:54:11,831 --> 01:54:13,030
the more opulent,
you know,

1931
01:54:13,031 --> 01:54:15,640
connected to all that eastern opulence 
as they were.

1932
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:19,150
See how that motif works.
Nonetheless,

1933
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:23,890
those Greeks in Anatolia will become a 
big part of,

1934
01:54:24,070 --> 01:54:29,070
you know the problem because they are 
the part that links Asia back to the 

1935
01:54:29,261 --> 01:54:33,370
Greek mainland and the Greek mainland 
has an interest in how their,

1936
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:37,060
shall we call them cousins,
second cousins,

1937
01:54:37,450 --> 01:54:38,410
how they're doing

1938
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:44,750
at the time.
The Battle of the eclipse figures out 

1939
01:54:44,750 --> 01:54:45,000
what's going on between the Lydians and 
the medes.

1940
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:50,360
Those Greeks are for the most part,
subject to the Lydian king that's going 

1941
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:52,950
to change.
That's going to change for everybody.

1942
01:54:54,410 --> 01:54:57,830
What's about to happen in this region 
that will affect the Greeks and everyone

1943
01:54:57,831 --> 01:55:02,831
else is every bit as shocking and 
unexpected as the fall of Assyria was.

1944
01:55:04,730 --> 01:55:09,730
And it's interesting that they will 
happen within a reasonably historically 

1945
01:55:09,730 --> 01:55:10,010
speaking,
short period of time from each other.

1946
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:14,510
You have to imagine that analogy.
We had the United States disappearing in

1947
01:55:14,511 --> 01:55:17,330
five to 15 years and what would the 
world look like after that?

1948
01:55:17,810 --> 01:55:19,520
Well,
what if I told you that within,

1949
01:55:20,210 --> 01:55:25,210
you know,
another 20 or 30 years after that one 

1950
01:55:25,210 --> 01:55:25,210
country that you'd never,
you know,

1951
01:55:25,210 --> 01:55:28,880
some out of the way place had taken over
the entire planet.

1952
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:34,750
That's how this analogy works.
When we start trying to realize that 

1953
01:55:34,750 --> 01:55:37,331
somehow this people call the Persians 
will first get their control over the 

1954
01:55:37,331 --> 01:55:39,800
means and how that even happens.
I mean,

1955
01:55:39,801 --> 01:55:40,610
recess are gone.
Me,

1956
01:55:40,611 --> 01:55:43,070
the author has a great line where he 
points out that,

1957
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:44,010
you know,
between the fall

1958
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:47,460
of the last great Assyrian monarch and 
the rise of Cyrus the great.

1959
01:55:47,910 --> 01:55:51,180
There's no mention of these Persian 
people in any text,

1960
01:55:51,210 --> 01:55:54,930
in any politically significant way.
They are virtual.

1961
01:55:55,020 --> 01:56:00,020
Nobody's and within a generation they're
running the show for everyone in this 

1962
01:56:00,301 --> 01:56:02,610
part of the world.
How did that happen?

1963
01:56:05,020 --> 01:56:10,020
Judging from the overwhelming number of 
historians from ancient times all the 

1964
01:56:10,721 --> 01:56:11,950
way to the,
you know,

1965
01:56:11,951 --> 01:56:14,800
the latest,
often contrarian writings,

1966
01:56:15,580 --> 01:56:20,580
the lion's share of the answer seems to 
have something to do with this 

1967
01:56:20,580 --> 01:56:24,250
incredible leader.
Cyrus the second also called,

1968
01:56:24,251 --> 01:56:26,830
as we said earlier,
Cyrus the great.

1969
01:56:28,830 --> 01:56:32,010
There are lots of stories by the way,
and some of them are fantastic.

1970
01:56:32,250 --> 01:56:37,250
One of her auditees is best is one of 
the ones you know he tells about the 

1971
01:56:37,250 --> 01:56:38,100
rise of Cyrus,
but you have to remember something.

1972
01:56:38,670 --> 01:56:43,670
This person,
cyrus the great is to Persian and 

1973
01:56:43,670 --> 01:56:48,081
Iranian history,
sort of what George Washington is to 

1974
01:56:48,081 --> 01:56:50,100
American history,
what King Arthur is to British legend.

1975
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:55,290
I mean this is a legendary figure and 
because there so little that talks about

1976
01:56:55,291 --> 01:57:00,291
him during his rise to power historians 
are in a really thrust into the 

1977
01:57:00,291 --> 01:57:03,870
detective role trying to figure out what
it is you know is going on.

1978
01:57:04,710 --> 01:57:09,710
I liked the way historian peer brand 
kind of tries to explain what sort of 

1979
01:57:09,710 --> 01:57:11,070
assumption she should maybe build into 
this and I'm not a historian,

1980
01:57:11,071 --> 01:57:16,071
so he was writing as a historian trying 
to explain to a lay person like yours 

1981
01:57:16,071 --> 01:57:16,071
truly.

1982
01:57:16,071 --> 01:57:17,460
Let's hope the layperson understood.
But he kind of said,

1983
01:57:17,850 --> 01:57:22,850
listen,
if something that appears to happen out 

1984
01:57:22,850 --> 01:57:23,010
of nowhere,
but it's unlikely that it could,

1985
01:57:23,250 --> 01:57:26,250
you should assume that there was stuff 
bubbling up under the surface,

1986
01:57:26,340 --> 01:57:28,710
you know,
a foundation taking place.

1987
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:31,590
But that's hidden from our eyes through 
the historical veil,

1988
01:57:31,591 --> 01:57:36,591
right?
So when a cyrus the great all of a 

1989
01:57:36,591 --> 01:57:39,381
sudden takes over the muddy and empire 
and it looks like a lightning bolt 

1990
01:57:39,381 --> 01:57:42,261
strikes,
it's probably safe to assume things had 

1991
01:57:42,261 --> 01:57:42,570
been leading up to this somehow for 
awhile,

1992
01:57:43,650 --> 01:57:48,650
for a long time.
One of the things historians like to 

1993
01:57:48,650 --> 01:57:51,440
suggest was percolating beneath the 
scene that you couldn't see with 

1994
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:54,570
something like rot,
I guess you could say maybe moral rot.

1995
01:57:55,110 --> 01:57:57,120
This is something that is,
you know,

1996
01:57:57,210 --> 01:58:00,840
part of earlier histories.
And because it's impossible to quantify,

1997
01:58:00,841 --> 01:58:02,670
I mean we could even ask these questions
a day,

1998
01:58:02,671 --> 01:58:04,230
is there any truth to the idea?

1999
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:09,260
And we have by the way,
that the older generations in tougher 

2000
01:58:09,260 --> 01:58:12,681
times are tougher than we are today.
If there is any truth to that because 

2001
01:58:12,681 --> 01:58:14,310
that had been true in the past.
How would a historian even measure that?

2002
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:19,700
So they don't anymore writing in 1935 
and I love him,

2003
01:58:19,950 --> 01:58:23,200
but it was written in 1935 historian 
will,

2004
01:58:23,201 --> 01:58:25,260
Duran tries to tie,
you know,

2005
01:58:25,261 --> 01:58:28,860
the downfall of the media to their moral
degeneration.

2006
01:58:29,220 --> 01:58:32,130
And the fact that they were sort of 
nouveau riche,

2007
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:33,390
he writes,
quote,

2008
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:37,410
their degeneration was even more rapid 
than their rise.

2009
01:58:37,770 --> 01:58:42,340
Osteology who succeeded his father.
See accessories proved again,

2010
01:58:42,341 --> 01:58:45,490
that monarchy is a gamble in who's royal
succession,

2011
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:48,640
great wits and madness,
or nearly allied.

2012
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:52,870
He inherited a kingdom with equanimity 
and settled down to enjoy it.

2013
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:55,330
Under his example,
the nation for God.

2014
01:58:55,331 --> 01:58:58,870
It's Stern,
morals and stoic ways wealth had come to

2015
01:58:58,871 --> 01:59:00,700
suddenly to be wisely used.

2016
01:59:00,970 --> 01:59:04,450
The upper classes became the slaves of 
fashion and luxury.

2017
01:59:04,690 --> 01:59:09,690
The men wore embroidered trousers.
The women covered themselves with 

2018
01:59:09,690 --> 01:59:12,280
cosmetics and jewelry.
The very horses were often comparison to

2019
01:59:12,281 --> 01:59:17,281
in gold.
These once simple and pastoral people 

2020
01:59:17,281 --> 01:59:20,820
who had been glad to be carried in rude 
wagons with wheels cut roughly out of 

2021
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:24,661
the trunks of trees now road and 
expensive chariots from feast to Feast 

2022
01:59:24,700 --> 01:59:27,190
and quote.
The truth is though,

2023
01:59:27,191 --> 01:59:32,191
that what Doran rights there in 1935 
isn't a whole lot different from what 

2024
01:59:32,191 --> 01:59:36,751
the ancient Greeks saw.
The ancient Greeks sorta saw themselves 

2025
01:59:36,751 --> 01:59:40,441
as Marlboro men compared to these people
from the east that were at best sort of 

2026
01:59:41,111 --> 01:59:44,560
Metro sexuals.
The Greeks likes to point out the use of

2027
01:59:44,561 --> 01:59:49,561
makeup as part of their idea that these 
easterners were a feminist writing 

2028
01:59:49,561 --> 01:59:50,680
hundreds of years later.
By the way,

2029
01:59:50,681 --> 01:59:55,681
xenophon talks about osteology is the 
last king of the medes and his 

2030
01:59:55,681 --> 01:59:57,700
guidelines,
I guess you would call it today,

2031
01:59:57,701 --> 02:00:00,010
his stencilled eyes,
the rouge on his face,

2032
02:00:00,011 --> 02:00:02,860
and xenophon who would have no way of 
knowing,

2033
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:05,620
says a wig have fake hair.

2034
02:00:06,580 --> 02:00:07,840
Now,
here's the thing though,

2035
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:13,680
in the east,
these kinds of things were cultural 

2036
02:00:13,680 --> 02:00:13,680
norms.
It wasn't a sign of a feminist.

2037
02:00:13,680 --> 02:00:18,420
The Pharaohs and the Egyptians had been 
using the dark coal around the eyes 

2038
02:00:18,420 --> 02:00:20,560
forever.
Just a different cultural thing,

2039
02:00:20,561 --> 02:00:24,700
but the Greeks saw it as just another 
sign of these oriental.

2040
02:00:25,210 --> 02:00:28,360
If Feminine,
Opulent Week,

2041
02:00:28,810 --> 02:00:30,280
Clever,
sneaky,

2042
02:00:30,340 --> 02:00:31,690
you know,
fill in the blank.

2043
02:00:31,870 --> 02:00:36,870
Easterners,
I will leave it to the credible 

2044
02:00:36,870 --> 02:00:41,370
historians to decide some day whether 
there's any truth to this motif about 

2045
02:00:41,651 --> 02:00:45,850
the medes sort of slouching towards 
Gomorrah or what have you.

2046
02:00:45,851 --> 02:00:50,851
Most of the modern stuff I read today 
looks at that as a as a terribly old 

2047
02:00:50,851 --> 02:00:52,480
fashioned way to view the situation,
but as I said,

2048
02:00:52,481 --> 02:00:54,460
how do you quantify something like that 
anyway,

2049
02:00:55,030 --> 02:00:58,810
but if you follow that narrative the way
a guy like Hurghada test is taking it or

2050
02:00:58,811 --> 02:01:01,720
a guy like will durant writing in 1935 
is taking it.

2051
02:01:02,380 --> 02:01:07,380
There's an almost opportunity created by
the decadence of the medes and the 

2052
02:01:07,380 --> 02:01:08,200
cruelty of their ruler.
Right,

2053
02:01:09,010 --> 02:01:14,010
and that can be exploited by somebody 
who has the opposite values from the 

2054
02:01:14,010 --> 02:01:14,920
people that are busy,
slouching towards Gomorrah.

2055
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:20,040
In other words,
people that were less corrupted by 

2056
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:20,040
luxury,
who were not as decadent,

2057
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:21,160
who were more,
shall we say,

2058
02:01:22,030 --> 02:01:25,450
possessors of the old time virtues,
if you will,

2059
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:30,960
and this gets us back to a secondary 
value that a guy like Herat at this has 

2060
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:30,960
for us.
Remember,

2061
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:31,710
like I said,
he's like the color era,

2062
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:34,520
the first real screenwriter,
writer show runner,

2063
02:01:34,600 --> 02:01:38,710
and and you learn two things from a guy 
writing the way he writes in the way.

2064
02:01:38,711 --> 02:01:39,950
A lot of after him,
right?

2065
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:41,630
One,
you learn about these events.

2066
02:01:41,631 --> 02:01:46,631
He's trying to relate to you,
which may or may not be true and are 

2067
02:01:46,631 --> 02:01:46,631
probably a combination of the two.
Right?

2068
02:01:46,631 --> 02:01:47,850
We learned about,
you know,

2069
02:01:48,140 --> 02:01:51,020
the rise of Cyrus,
at least the story that this guy heard,

2070
02:01:51,410 --> 02:01:56,410
but at the same time you're having like 
a Vulcan Mind Meld with a 2,500

2071
02:01:58,581 --> 02:02:03,581
year old basically alien mind,
a one way conversation with a 2,500

2072
02:02:06,171 --> 02:02:07,100
year old guy

2073
02:02:08,540 --> 02:02:10,750
and when you read Hurghada,
just this,

2074
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:11,490
you know,
I,

2075
02:02:11,700 --> 02:02:16,700
I really wish I could speak the ancient 
Greek and read it and understand the 

2076
02:02:16,761 --> 02:02:21,761
little nuances so I could really hear 
this guy in his own words as he meant 

2077
02:02:21,761 --> 02:02:24,860
every specific word.
But you getting a chance to see,

2078
02:02:25,370 --> 02:02:30,370
you know,
what this guy from a completely 

2079
02:02:30,370 --> 02:02:32,741
different time period likes and dislikes
his worldview.

2080
02:02:34,011 --> 02:02:36,080
What he thinks is good and what he 
thinks is bad.

2081
02:02:36,380 --> 02:02:39,200
You know,
his view sort of on the supernatural and

2082
02:02:39,201 --> 02:02:42,500
the gods,
his biases and his prejudices.

2083
02:02:43,370 --> 02:02:47,870
You're learning about he and his world.
When you read his stuff,

2084
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,850
part of what you have to filter it so 
carefully because just like all of us,

2085
02:02:51,851 --> 02:02:54,420
his world pollutes his worldview so that
you know,

2086
02:02:54,460 --> 02:02:58,840
we don't get as nonbiased a view now as 
we might want,

2087
02:02:59,290 --> 02:03:04,290
but what Hurghada tests does in this 
story is kind of say that because 

2088
02:03:04,290 --> 02:03:08,920
[inaudible] was the way he was a cyrus 
arises on the scene.

2089
02:03:10,690 --> 02:03:15,520
Modern Day historians can't decide or 
argue over whether or not there was some

2090
02:03:15,521 --> 02:03:18,100
war fought between the medes and the 
Persians.

2091
02:03:18,101 --> 02:03:20,320
Remember,
these are for the most part,

2092
02:03:20,620 --> 02:03:23,770
semi tribal peoples probably at this 
time.

2093
02:03:24,040 --> 02:03:25,720
They used to think they were more like 
states.

2094
02:03:25,721 --> 02:03:27,070
Now,
no one's sure.

2095
02:03:27,071 --> 02:03:32,071
Maybe a combination of some cities with 
some pastoral people that were lied to 

2096
02:03:32,071 --> 02:03:36,160
it.
It's an interesting sort of hybrid and 

2097
02:03:36,160 --> 02:03:38,401
there might've been a lot of these kinds
of societies around back then when 

2098
02:03:38,401 --> 02:03:38,500
they're transitioning from,
you know,

2099
02:03:38,501 --> 02:03:43,501
an old tribal world to something more 
along the lines of a centralized 

2100
02:03:43,501 --> 02:03:45,340
bureaucratic state.
When you're in sort of a tweener zone,

2101
02:03:45,341 --> 02:03:50,341
if you will.
So either a war between these medes and 

2102
02:03:50,341 --> 02:03:50,980
the Persians or the tribes that they 
controlled,

2103
02:03:51,610 --> 02:03:54,490
or sort of like,
as one historian described it,

2104
02:03:55,030 --> 02:03:59,230
the Medean empire getting a change in 
management

2105
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:05,840
with maybe some Medea nobles helping to 
rebel against this osteology person and 

2106
02:04:06,691 --> 02:04:11,691
modern historians have some interesting,
understandable sort of common sense 

2107
02:04:11,691 --> 02:04:14,460
reasons why they might want to.
The theory is that this osteology guy is

2108
02:04:14,461 --> 02:04:19,461
trying to convert the leads into more of
a typical centralized Mesopotamian 

2109
02:04:21,151 --> 02:04:24,060
government.
Where the king is is more autocratic.

2110
02:04:24,061 --> 02:04:29,061
It has a lot more authority.
It sounds like maybe he has to share a 

2111
02:04:29,061 --> 02:04:31,560
lot of authority with these different 
tribal rulers and as you might imagine,

2112
02:04:31,561 --> 02:04:35,820
it's almost like a law of nature.
They're unlikely to like that.

2113
02:04:36,150 --> 02:04:41,150
This may have some modern historians 
think to sort of an uprising and 

2114
02:04:41,150 --> 02:04:41,850
internal coup,
if you will.

2115
02:04:42,150 --> 02:04:47,150
And this Cyrus,
the second guy might be the person who 

2116
02:04:47,150 --> 02:04:50,751
gets to lead this now as the greatest 
early screen writer,

2117
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:56,010
Hirata tess has his own view of sorta 
what turns the tables on this.

2118
02:04:56,580 --> 02:04:57,870
Now.
It's one of these stories that,

2119
02:04:57,871 --> 02:05:02,871
again,
maybe tells us more about Hurghada and 

2120
02:05:02,871 --> 02:05:06,021
the audience he's trying to please,
but he must've heard this story 

2121
02:05:06,021 --> 02:05:10,071
somewhere.
This is a typical tale by the way of 

2122
02:05:10,071 --> 02:05:12,441
oriental cruelty,
but he setting up something that 

2123
02:05:12,441 --> 02:05:16,400
actually seemed to happen in the story 
and trying to give you a reason why it 

2124
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:20,271
happened without having any real way of 
knowing other than these people he's 

2125
02:05:20,271 --> 02:05:23,841
talking to.
He tells one of the most horrific 

2126
02:05:23,841 --> 02:05:26,271
stories in his writings,
but he tells it like Alfred Hitchcock or

2127
02:05:26,701 --> 02:05:31,260
west craven or someone like that.
We alluded to it earlier when we said in

2128
02:05:31,261 --> 02:05:32,660
an earlier story,
you know,

2129
02:05:32,661 --> 02:05:34,130
those [inaudible],
you know,

2130
02:05:34,140 --> 02:05:37,860
killed a boy and served it to the and 
king and he didn't like that.

2131
02:05:38,190 --> 02:05:39,720
Well,
in this story,

2132
02:05:39,721 --> 02:05:41,850
it's that same thing,
but with an extra twist.

2133
02:05:41,910 --> 02:05:44,480
I have several different versions of 
Heraclitus.

2134
02:05:45,150 --> 02:05:47,460
Um,
but let me set this up.

2135
02:05:47,461 --> 02:05:52,050
What happens in the story is it concerns
this osteology guy,

2136
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:57,080
the son of succe accessories and nowhere
near his father in terms of greatness 

2137
02:05:57,511 --> 02:06:00,060
and kind of a jerk.
And that's the way he's portrayed.

2138
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:04,080
And he has a dream and that these 
dreams,

2139
02:06:04,081 --> 02:06:06,540
you got to love ancient history because 
they're always so wild.

2140
02:06:06,541 --> 02:06:11,541
Hurghada tests related by the way the 
dream has something to do with his 

2141
02:06:11,541 --> 02:06:13,410
daughter urinating over the whole world 
or something,

2142
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:15,390
as I said,
got to love the ancient history.

2143
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:19,140
And he asked the Magic to interpret it 
and they say,

2144
02:06:19,260 --> 02:06:24,260
I'm not very good.
This daughter's gonna give birth to 

2145
02:06:24,260 --> 02:06:24,990
something or she's the seed of something
that's maybe going to overthrow you.

2146
02:06:24,991 --> 02:06:29,190
And so to play it safe,
Hurghada says he marries her off to some

2147
02:06:29,191 --> 02:06:30,990
Persian,
um,

2148
02:06:31,050 --> 02:06:32,550
you know,
maybe a great Persian guy,

2149
02:06:32,551 --> 02:06:37,551
but this is the muddy and empire and,
and no son of a Persian is going to be 

2150
02:06:37,551 --> 02:06:37,590
ruling the midian empire.

2151
02:06:37,590 --> 02:06:40,320
So that's been taken care of.
But then about a year later,

2152
02:06:40,321 --> 02:06:45,321
Herat at this says he has another dream 
about his daughter who's about to give 

2153
02:06:45,321 --> 02:06:47,640
birth to her first child.
And in this dream he sees,

2154
02:06:47,940 --> 02:06:52,940
I think it's,
it's like vines coming out of her womb 

2155
02:06:52,940 --> 02:06:53,130
and then encompassing the whole earth or
something.

2156
02:06:53,190 --> 02:06:55,550
Again,
akin to that and the match.

2157
02:06:55,551 --> 02:06:57,960
I come in and interpret that,
and as you might imagine,

2158
02:06:57,961 --> 02:07:01,830
it's not good and it scares osteology 
who thinks that she,

2159
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:04,920
his daughter is going to give birth to a
person who takes his throne.

2160
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:08,550
So in a story that you see in other 
tales,

2161
02:07:08,551 --> 02:07:13,551
in other words,
it's a pretty common motif with 

2162
02:07:13,551 --> 02:07:15,420
different twists.
Osteology calls in the general.

2163
02:07:16,290 --> 02:07:21,290
A guy named Harper Gus,
who seems to be a historical figure and 

2164
02:07:21,290 --> 02:07:23,700
tells harper guests to get rid of the 
baby.

2165
02:07:24,780 --> 02:07:27,840
Now Harper Guess Herata says,
doesn't want to get rid of the baby.

2166
02:07:28,290 --> 02:07:30,900
Just let me stop for a second.
In this story,

2167
02:07:30,910 --> 02:07:33,240
Heraclitus is lovingly telling this 
story.

2168
02:07:33,241 --> 02:07:38,241
He knows what the colorful pieces are 
and he says he doesn't want to get rid 

2169
02:07:39,251 --> 02:07:40,870
of the baby,
doesn't want to kill a baby.

2170
02:07:41,140 --> 02:07:45,970
So he gives the job to a shepherd and 
gives the shepherd the baby and says,

2171
02:07:45,971 --> 02:07:48,040
get rid of the baby,
expose it,

2172
02:07:48,160 --> 02:07:50,200
you know,
out into the open and let it die,

2173
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:56,040
and the shepherd doesn't want to get rid
of the baby and it just so happens his 

2174
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:58,780
wife is pregnant and she gives birth.
Adjust this time to a stillborn child.

2175
02:07:59,230 --> 02:08:02,230
Doesn't this sound like a bunch of old 
grimms fairy tales at this point?

2176
02:08:02,620 --> 02:08:07,620
So as you might imagine,
they take the stillborn child rapid in 

2177
02:08:07,620 --> 02:08:09,460
the royal close,
keep the live when they were supposed to

2178
02:08:09,461 --> 02:08:11,630
kill and give the stillborn child back 
to heart,

2179
02:08:11,650 --> 02:08:13,710
biggest to give to his boss,
to king and stacy.

2180
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:18,840
It was done fast forward 13 years later 
or something like that and a boy is 

2181
02:08:19,991 --> 02:08:24,991
brought before.
This is the headwater two story 

2182
02:08:24,991 --> 02:08:26,971
osteology because he's been whipping 
boys higher on the social standing 

2183
02:08:26,971 --> 02:08:27,310
scale.
Then he,

2184
02:08:27,610 --> 02:08:32,610
after a bunch of questioning it is 
determined and again this is the 

2185
02:08:32,610 --> 02:08:33,630
wonderfulness of the ancient mind meld 
you're having with Hurghada.

2186
02:08:33,680 --> 02:08:38,350
This that basically osteology can tell 
that this boy is a king.

2187
02:08:38,650 --> 02:08:42,010
It's like in your DNA.
You can tell the difference between blue

2188
02:08:42,011 --> 02:08:45,790
bloods and non blue bloods by the way 
they handle situations and it's inbred.

2189
02:08:46,600 --> 02:08:51,600
Besides that osteology notices that the 
kid looks like him and after all he is 

2190
02:08:51,600 --> 02:08:53,770
his grandfather.
He calls in hospice.

2191
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:56,380
Then he calls in the shepherd.
He does a little investigation,

2192
02:08:56,381 --> 02:09:01,381
figures the whole story out and pretends
he's not mad.

2193
02:09:02,470 --> 02:09:04,150
Tells heart biggest.
He's often felt,

2194
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:06,040
I'm paraphrasing here from paralysis,
but,

2195
02:09:06,190 --> 02:09:09,250
but tells harper because he's often felt
bad about the whole thing afterwards.

2196
02:09:09,250 --> 02:09:14,250
So He's,
he's secretly relieved that the whole 

2197
02:09:14,250 --> 02:09:14,250
thing went the way it did.
Why don't you go home,

2198
02:09:14,590 --> 02:09:19,590
tell your wife we're going to have a 
banquet to celebrate all this and you 

2199
02:09:19,590 --> 02:09:19,590
can come over and,
and,

2200
02:09:19,590 --> 02:09:20,730
and we'll,
we'll highlight you at the banquet.

2201
02:09:20,740 --> 02:09:24,160
Send your son over your 13 year old son 
so he can keep the new boy,

2202
02:09:24,161 --> 02:09:26,250
you know,
my grandson company and uh,

2203
02:09:26,260 --> 02:09:31,260
you know,
we'll have a party tonight and 

2204
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:33,690
Heraclitus says that heartbeat has goes 
back home and he's relieved because he 

2205
02:09:33,690 --> 02:09:36,811
knows he could have gotten in big 
trouble and the wife is happy and they 

2206
02:09:36,811 --> 02:09:38,050
go to this banquet.
And this is where Alfred Hitchcock,

2207
02:09:38,051 --> 02:09:41,080
Hurghada test of helicopter takes the 
story over.

2208
02:09:41,830 --> 02:09:43,360
And again,
I keep telling myself,

2209
02:09:43,420 --> 02:09:45,520
I don't think this is making this stuff 
up.

2210
02:09:45,760 --> 02:09:50,760
Somebody told him this story.
This is what somebody somewhere 

2211
02:09:50,760 --> 02:09:55,381
believed.
Now listen to this and try to imagine a 

2212
02:09:55,381 --> 02:09:58,921
story like this from the Assyrians,
the Babylonians or the ancient 

2213
02:09:59,711 --> 02:10:00,850
Mesopotamians.

2214
02:10:00,850 --> 02:10:03,910
They just didn't write this way.
Hurghada is a story.

2215
02:10:03,911 --> 02:10:08,911
Has the 13 year old son of heart biggest
going to the palace as requested and 

2216
02:10:09,191 --> 02:10:14,191
then picks up the story and says,
this is from my discipline core 

2217
02:10:14,191 --> 02:10:14,830
translation.
By the way,

2218
02:10:15,430 --> 02:10:17,440
quote,
when Harper gets his son,

2219
02:10:17,441 --> 02:10:19,370
arrived at the palace,
last Dr,

2220
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:22,600
had him butchered,
cut up into joints and cooked,

2221
02:10:22,870 --> 02:10:27,870
roasting some boiling the rest and 
having the whole properly prepared for 

2222
02:10:27,870 --> 02:10:32,611
the table.
Dinner Time came and the guests 

2223
02:10:32,611 --> 02:10:33,740
assembled with heart.
Biggest among them dishes of mutton were

2224
02:10:33,741 --> 02:10:38,741
placed in front of osteology is then if 
everyone else except purpose to purpose 

2225
02:10:38,741 --> 02:10:42,320
was served the flesh of his son.
All of it except for the head,

2226
02:10:42,380 --> 02:10:47,380
the hands and feet,
which had been put separately on a 

2227
02:10:47,380 --> 02:10:47,380
platter,
covered with a lid.

2228
02:10:47,380 --> 02:10:49,700
When heartbreak is thought he had eaten 
as much as he wanted.

2229
02:10:50,050 --> 02:10:52,400
I asked him if he enjoyed his dinner.

2230
02:10:52,700 --> 02:10:55,130
He answered that he had enjoyed it very 
much indeed.

2231
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:59,750
Where upon those whose business it was 
to do so brought in the boy's head,

2232
02:10:59,810 --> 02:11:03,000
hands and feet in the covered dish,
stood by heart,

2233
02:11:03,001 --> 02:11:08,001
biggest his chair,
and told him to lift the lid and take 

2234
02:11:08,001 --> 02:11:08,001
what he fancied.
Heart biggest,

2235
02:11:08,001 --> 02:11:12,971
remove the cover and saw the fragments 
of his son's body as he kept control of 

2236
02:11:12,971 --> 02:11:17,651
himself and did not lose his head.
If the dreadful cite us dog has asked 

2237
02:11:17,651 --> 02:11:19,550
him if he knew what animal it was,
whose flesh he had just eaten.

2238
02:11:19,970 --> 02:11:24,970
I know my Lord was her biggest this 
reply and from my part may the kings 

2239
02:11:24,970 --> 02:11:27,020
will be done.
He said no other word,

2240
02:11:27,021 --> 02:11:32,021
but took up what remained of the flesh 
and went home intending I suppose to 

2241
02:11:32,021 --> 02:11:34,790
bury all of it together.
And that was how Harper Gus was punished

2242
02:11:35,300 --> 02:11:39,020
and quote.
If that had been in the Syrian record,

2243
02:11:39,021 --> 02:11:41,680
it would have said something like his 
son.

2244
02:11:41,690 --> 02:11:44,030
I divided the pieces I fed to him.
I mean,

2245
02:11:44,031 --> 02:11:45,860
it would be a straightforward sort of 
thing.

2246
02:11:46,100 --> 02:11:49,400
You wouldn't have anybody setting up the
suspense of,

2247
02:11:49,650 --> 02:11:52,010
you know,
having him eat and not know what it is.

2248
02:11:52,011 --> 02:11:55,400
And then having the platter brought in,
having the king asked the question,

2249
02:11:55,401 --> 02:11:56,780
do you know what you ate?
Did you like it?

2250
02:11:56,781 --> 02:12:01,781
And then the platters lifted up.
I mean those moments where you set up 

2251
02:12:01,781 --> 02:12:03,710
the tension and the drama,
it's a movie.

2252
02:12:04,940 --> 02:12:08,630
You could do that movie and change 
nothing.

2253
02:12:10,670 --> 02:12:13,700
It's living color.
What's more,

2254
02:12:13,701 --> 02:12:18,701
Heraclitus is clearly setting up these 
moments for his audience to do the 

2255
02:12:18,701 --> 02:12:23,111
equivalent of what we would do in a 
movie theater when some great seen on 

2256
02:12:23,111 --> 02:12:25,190
the screen happens that we're all really
glad to see and you clap or something.

2257
02:12:25,400 --> 02:12:29,300
He's got these moments because when you 
make osteology out to be such a jerk,

2258
02:12:29,660 --> 02:12:31,850
when he gets what's coming to him in the
story,

2259
02:12:31,851 --> 02:12:34,400
it's a crowd pleaser.
And then this story,

2260
02:12:34,401 --> 02:12:39,401
of course he does.
And while it's tempting to think that 

2261
02:12:39,401 --> 02:12:41,210
the entire thing is just a great tale,
somebody great tale,

2262
02:12:41,211 --> 02:12:46,211
maybe not initially,
there are definite facts mixed in and 

2263
02:12:46,211 --> 02:12:49,970
you can see her test.
Trying to explain the reasons behind the

2264
02:12:49,971 --> 02:12:54,971
facts.
Today may be a screenwriter would call 

2265
02:12:54,971 --> 02:12:56,951
it dramatic license because Babylonian 
records indicate that there was a 

2266
02:12:58,551 --> 02:13:03,551
general who corresponds to this heart 
biggest guy and that that general was 

2267
02:13:04,041 --> 02:13:06,500
involved in a battlefield.

2268
02:13:07,250 --> 02:13:11,630
Betrayal,
maybe you could say in a key battle,

2269
02:13:11,631 --> 02:13:15,350
osteology has had a large part of his 
army,

2270
02:13:15,800 --> 02:13:19,010
desert him on the battlefield and go to 
the other side.

2271
02:13:20,090 --> 02:13:25,090
It very well may have been this heart 
biggest person who led them to do that 

2272
02:13:26,090 --> 02:13:29,450
and Hurghada test wants you to think 
that see,

2273
02:13:29,870 --> 02:13:32,880
he was a jerk and now this is what he 
gets,

2274
02:13:32,881 --> 02:13:37,881
and and who would think that you could 
trust a man whose son you had served to 

2275
02:13:37,881 --> 02:13:39,990
him for dinner with the entire army in 
the first place,

2276
02:13:39,991 --> 02:13:44,991
but nonetheless,
the moment when Harper guests and the 

2277
02:13:44,991 --> 02:13:45,960
medes crossover to cyrus aside of the 
battlefield,

2278
02:13:45,961 --> 02:13:49,170
must've been a crowd pleasing and 
satisfying moment for the audience,

2279
02:13:49,171 --> 02:13:51,810
right?
That jerk got what he deserved.

2280
02:13:52,440 --> 02:13:54,960
In the Babylonian records,
it's much more stark,

2281
02:13:54,961 --> 02:13:59,961
as you might imagine,
one of the texts from Babylon as quoted 

2282
02:13:59,961 --> 02:14:02,370
by peer Briana reads,
quote,

2283
02:14:03,060 --> 02:14:07,110
osteology is mobilized his army and he 
marched against Cyrus King.

2284
02:14:07,110 --> 02:14:09,360
Avant Sean,
to conquer the army,

2285
02:14:09,361 --> 02:14:12,270
rebelled against osteology and he was 
taken prisoner.

2286
02:14:12,450 --> 02:14:16,580
They handed him over to Cyrus Cyrus 
march towards Batna,

2287
02:14:16,620 --> 02:14:21,620
the royal city and quote by 5:50
bce or thereabouts,

2288
02:14:23,100 --> 02:14:28,100
Cyrus and the Persians were basically in
control of the old Isla might 

2289
02:14:29,641 --> 02:14:34,641
territories and now had inherited 
control of the Medea and empire,

2290
02:14:35,070 --> 02:14:40,070
which was already one of the great 
empires in this particular world stage.

2291
02:14:41,700 --> 02:14:44,850
It's kind of possible that the Lydian 
King,

2292
02:14:44,851 --> 02:14:49,260
for example,
that in three years Cyrus will be at war

2293
02:14:49,261 --> 02:14:54,261
with,
doesn't even really have a key idea who 

2294
02:14:54,261 --> 02:14:54,261
the Persians are.
I'm not sure,

2295
02:14:54,261 --> 02:14:58,440
but I mean judging from the sources,
this is quite the turnaround.

2296
02:14:58,860 --> 02:15:03,860
And as I said in 5:47,
cyrus and the new Persian empire is 

2297
02:15:05,101 --> 02:15:10,101
fighting those same people.
The means were fighting when that 

2298
02:15:10,101 --> 02:15:10,101
eclipse,
you know,

2299
02:15:10,101 --> 02:15:11,310
caused everyone to think that maybe they
shouldn't be fighting,

2300
02:15:12,060 --> 02:15:17,060
and it's a great story because the guy 
who runs the lydian empire now at this 

2301
02:15:17,060 --> 02:15:18,270
time is a guy named creases.

2302
02:15:18,270 --> 02:15:21,480
And there's a saying about him.
You may have heard rich as creases,

2303
02:15:21,930 --> 02:15:23,790
and that's the stereotype of the 
Lydians.

2304
02:15:23,791 --> 02:15:25,220
At this time,
uh,

2305
02:15:25,230 --> 02:15:30,230
as I said,
they're known as people who invented 

2306
02:15:30,230 --> 02:15:31,020
metal coinage,
don't know if that's really true or not,

2307
02:15:31,021 --> 02:15:34,920
but that's their reputation and it's 
attached to them because they're thought

2308
02:15:34,921 --> 02:15:39,921
to be extremely wealthy and creases is 
supposed to have gone to one of the 

2309
02:15:41,131 --> 02:15:45,450
famous Oracle's maybe the most famous 
oracle in the entire Greek world,

2310
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:50,960
the Oracle at Delphi,
which he may have been giving money to 

2311
02:15:50,960 --> 02:15:55,761
influence.
There was a whole big problem during 

2312
02:15:55,761 --> 02:15:56,490
this period where some questioned the 
reliability of these oracles.

2313
02:15:56,520 --> 02:16:00,870
Can you imagine a because of them taking
money to keep operating from people.

2314
02:16:00,871 --> 02:16:05,871
Increases was a bridge and he gave money
to everybody's a little Donald Trump 

2315
02:16:05,871 --> 02:16:05,871
ish.
Maybe you might say.

2316
02:16:05,871 --> 02:16:06,430
And,
um,

2317
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:09,600
asked the oracle,
you know,

2318
02:16:09,601 --> 02:16:13,620
now what would happen if I went to war 
with the Persian empire?

2319
02:16:14,610 --> 02:16:16,740
Now,
little sidetrack here,

2320
02:16:16,770 --> 02:16:20,370
maybe only worthwhile for the bedding 
people amongst you,

2321
02:16:21,060 --> 02:16:26,060
but if you went to an advisor in Las 
Vegas who gave you advice and you said,

2322
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:30,400
will the Green Bay packers win the 
superbowl?

2323
02:16:30,520 --> 02:16:35,520
And the answer was,
if the Green Bay packers play in the 

2324
02:16:35,520 --> 02:16:37,180
superbowl,
they will add to a great legacy.

2325
02:16:37,870 --> 02:16:42,850
Do you bet?
Creases was told by the Oracle at Delphi

2326
02:16:43,210 --> 02:16:47,830
that have creases attacks the Persians,
he will destroy a great empire.

2327
02:16:48,910 --> 02:16:51,190
You could take that a number of 
different ways,

2328
02:16:51,191 --> 02:16:53,500
couldn't you?
You could say,

2329
02:16:53,501 --> 02:16:55,270
hey,
the greenbay packers are going to win.

2330
02:16:55,271 --> 02:17:00,271
Or You could say,
listen to the Dallas cowboys beat the 

2331
02:17:00,271 --> 02:17:03,660
Green Bay packers.
They have added to a great championship 

2332
02:17:03,660 --> 02:17:07,321
legacy too.
It's just the Dallas cowboys 

2333
02:17:07,321 --> 02:17:09,760
championship legacy.
When creases and the lydians fight,

2334
02:17:10,150 --> 02:17:13,270
Cyrus and the Persians,
he loses.

2335
02:17:14,050 --> 02:17:18,160
He destroys a great empire.
The one that invented metal coinage.

2336
02:17:19,390 --> 02:17:24,390
I would love to get into the kind of 
army that Cyrus had and what he used to 

2337
02:17:24,390 --> 02:17:25,690
accomplish this victory over the 
Lydians.

2338
02:17:25,691 --> 02:17:30,691
But no,
the acumen and military system is not 

2339
02:17:30,691 --> 02:17:34,951
well understood anyway.
And it was only in the 19 eighties that 

2340
02:17:34,951 --> 02:17:38,190
they started putting together realistic 
reconstructions of the army in the days 

2341
02:17:38,190 --> 02:17:39,610
that are much better known than this 
period.

2342
02:17:39,611 --> 02:17:44,611
I mean during the Greek inversion wars 
or after against Alexander in this 

2343
02:17:44,611 --> 02:17:47,941
period.
It's all conjecture what the heck cyrus 

2344
02:17:47,941 --> 02:17:47,941
was using.
I mean,

2345
02:17:47,941 --> 02:17:47,941
you can say,
well,

2346
02:17:47,941 --> 02:17:50,020
he probably use this and it's logical to
assume that,

2347
02:17:50,320 --> 02:17:51,340
but nobody knows.

2348
02:17:52,930 --> 02:17:57,170
When you read Herodotus,
he's always got some little stratagem in

2349
02:17:57,180 --> 02:18:02,180
play that keeps you from having to know 
in a really what the army was doing in 

2350
02:18:02,180 --> 02:18:02,290
one of these big battles against 
creases.

2351
02:18:02,690 --> 02:18:07,690
You know,
the Persians were told we'll take their 

2352
02:18:07,690 --> 02:18:09,541
baggage camels and take the baggage off 
of them and put them in front of the 

2353
02:18:09,541 --> 02:18:12,340
army so that when the Lydian horses 
who've never seen camels right up to the

2354
02:18:12,341 --> 02:18:14,110
front,
they'll be scared off by the camels.

2355
02:18:14,111 --> 02:18:14,470
I mean,
you know,

2356
02:18:14,471 --> 02:18:19,471
you get a victory in the battle just 
with that doesn't really help you know 

2357
02:18:19,471 --> 02:18:19,810
much about an army that must've been 
really,

2358
02:18:19,811 --> 02:18:22,630
really good to do all these things cyrus
was doing with it.

2359
02:18:24,570 --> 02:18:28,080
He does look like a very bold commander 
from the sources.

2360
02:18:28,081 --> 02:18:33,081
I mean,
one of the things he brought it just 

2361
02:18:33,081 --> 02:18:34,251
talks about is this,
shall we call it a misunderstanding 

2362
02:18:34,251 --> 02:18:37,761
between creases and Cyrus after this big
battle that starts off the campaign and 

2363
02:18:37,761 --> 02:18:40,170
it's bloody and inconclusive and 
winter's coming,

2364
02:18:40,171 --> 02:18:45,171
so creases does with any ancient 
commander would have done during that 

2365
02:18:45,171 --> 02:18:45,171
period.
He went home,

2366
02:18:45,450 --> 02:18:50,450
went to the capital at stardust,
this giant fortified city and dismissed 

2367
02:18:50,450 --> 02:18:52,830
mercenaries and let most of the army go 
home and told his allies,

2368
02:18:53,310 --> 02:18:54,270
you know,
in four months,

2369
02:18:54,271 --> 02:18:57,300
show up here and we'll deal with this 
emerging Persian threat.

2370
02:18:57,930 --> 02:18:58,830
His allies,
by the way,

2371
02:18:58,870 --> 02:18:59,730
included,
you know,

2372
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:02,430
the great powers,
Babylonia and Egypt.

2373
02:19:02,431 --> 02:19:07,431
So maybe cyrus was starting to be seen 
as the destabilizing force in that 

2374
02:19:07,431 --> 02:19:11,280
little geopolitical ecosystem in that 
part of the world.

2375
02:19:11,281 --> 02:19:14,820
Nonetheless,
Cyrus didn't disband the army.

2376
02:19:15,300 --> 02:19:18,510
He didn't go home for winter.
He were told,

2377
02:19:18,511 --> 02:19:20,280
pursued the Lydians right on their 
heels.

2378
02:19:20,281 --> 02:19:25,281
This is bald strategy,
and he forced another battle and were 

2379
02:19:25,281 --> 02:19:26,910
told it was after creases had already 
basically sent most of the people,

2380
02:19:28,760 --> 02:19:30,010
the Persians,
but not paddling.

2381
02:19:30,020 --> 02:19:35,020
That's the camel battle.
And then they faced this monstrous 

2382
02:19:35,020 --> 02:19:38,491
fortification at Sardis.
The capital of Libya that could easily 

2383
02:19:38,491 --> 02:19:39,470
hold out until all those allies show up 
in four months,

2384
02:19:39,471 --> 02:19:42,860
you would think we're told it holds out 
for like 14 days,

2385
02:19:43,350 --> 02:19:48,350
and again,
we have another story about a a back 

2386
02:19:48,350 --> 02:19:51,880
path to the citadel being found by a 
Persian who spies one of the guards.

2387
02:19:52,581 --> 02:19:54,980
Hats falling off,
helmets falling off in the guard,

2388
02:19:54,981 --> 02:19:57,110
retrieving it down some path.
Again,

2389
02:19:57,800 --> 02:20:02,030
you wouldn't know about what amazing 
siege engines maybe cyrus had because we

2390
02:20:02,031 --> 02:20:07,031
always have some little story that 
accounts for how one of the great 

2391
02:20:07,031 --> 02:20:09,140
fortified cities in this part of the 
world gets taken in 14 days.

2392
02:20:09,770 --> 02:20:14,770
Nonetheless.
We also get some accounts now of of of 

2393
02:20:14,770 --> 02:20:16,130
something we've spoken about,
about how the Persians may be like darth

2394
02:20:16,131 --> 02:20:21,131
vader to the Greeks,
but they have something and and you 

2395
02:20:21,131 --> 02:20:24,071
know,
you don't know if you want to call this 

2396
02:20:24,071 --> 02:20:26,320
propaganda or a sincere and clever and 
common sense and realistic approach to 

2397
02:20:28,731 --> 02:20:31,130
things.
If you could sort of take either way,

2398
02:20:31,580 --> 02:20:36,580
but shall we call it the tolerance bomb.
We're told Theodora stimulus,

2399
02:20:37,071 --> 02:20:42,071
especially mentions that cyrus gave a 
deal to the lydians before this whole 

2400
02:20:42,071 --> 02:20:42,071
thing started.
He said,

2401
02:20:42,071 --> 02:20:46,901
listen,
submit to me and I'll leave you in 

2402
02:20:46,901 --> 02:20:47,810
charge of this whole area.
It's basically the same deal.

2403
02:20:47,811 --> 02:20:50,570
Xerxes offered the spartans.
If they're awfully,

2404
02:20:50,610 --> 02:20:51,620
come on,
let's make a deal.

2405
02:20:51,621 --> 02:20:55,040
Put down those weapons and not only will
you get to go home,

2406
02:20:55,280 --> 02:20:56,900
I'll put you in charge of all these 
people.

2407
02:20:56,901 --> 02:21:00,110
You'll benefit,
submit and profit.

2408
02:21:00,200 --> 02:21:05,200
Maybe you could call this combination of
sort of machiavellian thinking with a 

2409
02:21:07,521 --> 02:21:10,550
sort of Gandhi like ethic that's going 
too far,

2410
02:21:10,551 --> 02:21:15,551
but I love the connection.
A realistic hardheaded knife in the 

2411
02:21:16,701 --> 02:21:21,701
back,
sort of diplomacy with tolerance and 

2412
02:21:21,701 --> 02:21:24,410
mercy and leniency as your weapon.
Get a knife,

2413
02:21:24,411 --> 02:21:29,411
you with leniency and you know,
you would have to suggest perhaps that 

2414
02:21:30,321 --> 02:21:35,321
there were two ways this lenient idea 
could go either not work at all and then

2415
02:21:35,901 --> 02:21:40,901
you see why the Assyrians had to be as 
harsh as they were or because the 

2416
02:21:40,901 --> 02:21:43,130
Assyrians were as harsh as they were in 
the Babylonians who followed after them.

2417
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:48,290
The area was ripe for somebody who would
offer.

2418
02:21:48,380 --> 02:21:53,380
I mean,
if everybody was going to be under 

2419
02:21:53,380 --> 02:21:54,641
somebody control,
when did you want to go with the 

2420
02:21:54,641 --> 02:21:55,760
tolerant guy and remember we are grading
on a curve here.

2421
02:21:56,090 --> 02:22:01,090
When we talk about tolerance,
the Persians could be every bit as 

2422
02:22:01,090 --> 02:22:03,260
atrocious as any other ancient people on
occasion.

2423
02:22:03,620 --> 02:22:08,620
It just seemed like once they took over,
there were a lot fewer of those 

2424
02:22:08,620 --> 02:22:12,101
occasions,
maybe the historians or some of them 

2425
02:22:12,101 --> 02:22:12,101
that I grew up with would say something 
like,

2426
02:22:12,101 --> 02:22:17,050
well,
that's because the Assyrians already 

2427
02:22:17,050 --> 02:22:18,461
broke.
All the troubles in people to the yoke 

2428
02:22:18,461 --> 02:22:20,171
of Empire seems a bit far fetched.
Certainly you can say though that the 

2429
02:22:22,340 --> 02:22:27,340
whole sort of mood and attitude was 
altered and you don't get any more of 

2430
02:22:27,541 --> 02:22:31,050
those really intimidating reliefs 
showing things like,

2431
02:22:31,340 --> 02:22:36,340
you know,
heads of your enemies staring up at you 

2432
02:22:36,340 --> 02:22:39,020
or horrible violence or the flying of 
live captives and you don't get the 

2433
02:22:39,320 --> 02:22:43,620
writings where there's a boasting and a 
propaganda value where you're saying,

2434
02:22:43,621 --> 02:22:46,860
this is what will happen to you if you 
rebel against us.

2435
02:22:47,310 --> 02:22:51,000
Recess are gummy quotes.
The SOM cylinder,

2436
02:22:51,001 --> 02:22:52,680
it's called and it's Osher,
Bonnie Paul,

2437
02:22:52,681 --> 02:22:57,090
the last great king of Assyria,
boasting of what he did to Babylon after

2438
02:22:57,091 --> 02:22:59,520
his brother,
who he put on the throne of Babylon,

2439
02:22:59,521 --> 02:23:03,750
rebelled against him in 6:49
bce.

2440
02:23:04,140 --> 02:23:06,780
First,
he's besieged the people until they were

2441
02:23:06,781 --> 02:23:09,810
cannibalistic and then picks up the 
narrative saying,

2442
02:23:09,811 --> 02:23:10,230
quote,

2443
02:23:11,530 --> 02:23:16,530
out of hunger,
the flesh have their sons and daughters 

2444
02:23:16,530 --> 02:23:16,530
they ate.
Afterwards,

2445
02:23:16,530 --> 02:23:19,210
I ripped out the tongue of those 
officers whose mouth said,

2446
02:23:19,211 --> 02:23:21,880
blast themed against Asher,
my master,

2447
02:23:21,881 --> 02:23:25,180
and then slaughtered them.
Any soldiers found still alive,

2448
02:23:25,330 --> 02:23:28,400
were flogged in front of the wing.
Good bowls built by Senaca.

2449
02:23:28,401 --> 02:23:33,401
Rip My grandfather.
I whipped the Naca ribs tomb and then 

2450
02:23:33,401 --> 02:23:35,020
tossed.
They're quivering flesh for the jackals,

2451
02:23:35,021 --> 02:23:36,490
the birds,
and the fish to eat.

2452
02:23:36,730 --> 02:23:41,730
In this way,
I placated the wrath of the gods who 

2453
02:23:41,730 --> 02:23:42,550
would become incensed by their ignominy,
his deeds,

2454
02:23:43,450 --> 02:23:46,810
and then start gummy picks up the 
narrative saying,

2455
02:23:46,811 --> 02:23:51,811
quote,
this grizzly passage related to events 

2456
02:23:51,811 --> 02:23:55,681
that transpired in Babylon proceeds a 
brief description of the restorative 

2457
02:23:55,681 --> 02:23:56,350
work that Osher,
Bonnie,

2458
02:23:56,351 --> 02:24:01,351
Paul undertook in that city that the 
Assyrian king was unabashed about 

2459
02:24:01,351 --> 02:24:05,731
intertwining the account of his 
brutality with that of his clemency 

2460
02:24:05,731 --> 02:24:10,410
indicates that Mesopotamian royalty did 
not frowned upon the infliction of 

2461
02:24:10,410 --> 02:24:12,400
vicious reprisals against conquered 
populations.

2462
02:24:12,730 --> 02:24:17,730
This attitude enabled the Assyrian and 
Babylonian kings to base their policies 

2463
02:24:17,730 --> 02:24:22,501
largely on terror.
During the two centuries proceeding 

2464
02:24:22,501 --> 02:24:24,730
Cyrus's rise to power,
the Assyrians and Babylonians had sacked

2465
02:24:24,760 --> 02:24:29,760
nearly every major near eastern capital 
and their preferred practices of 

2466
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:31,660
population,
deportation and kidnapping.

2467
02:24:31,661 --> 02:24:36,661
Sacred Images had deeply traumatized the
people of the ancient near east end 

2468
02:24:36,701 --> 02:24:38,770
quote.
In other words,

2469
02:24:39,490 --> 02:24:43,420
if you had ever wanted to find a winning
military strategy,

2470
02:24:43,960 --> 02:24:48,960
this might be the time where mercy 
tolerance and being the cool conquerors 

2471
02:24:50,650 --> 02:24:52,030
really worked in your favor.

2472
02:24:53,880 --> 02:24:58,880
Cyrus is the one who initiated this idea
that we're not going to impale everybody

2473
02:25:00,550 --> 02:25:03,880
and we're not going to fly them and 
we're not going to force them to convert

2474
02:25:03,881 --> 02:25:06,400
to our religion.
You join us,

2475
02:25:06,880 --> 02:25:11,880
pay your taxes.
I may have some representatives in a 

2476
02:25:11,880 --> 02:25:13,030
garrison in your city,
but life will be good.

2477
02:25:13,031 --> 02:25:16,240
This Persian deal was very seductive.

2478
02:25:17,860 --> 02:25:22,660
Now here's where the story begins to 
dove tail with what we've already talked

2479
02:25:22,661 --> 02:25:26,470
about earlier.
The peoples that we spoke about,

2480
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:31,800
these Greeks who were in Anatolia,
some of them spoke a language that was 

2481
02:25:31,811 --> 02:25:34,060
called Ionian,
so they're often called Ionians,

2482
02:25:34,061 --> 02:25:38,830
but there were other types of Greeks 
there to Asiatic Greeks is a term that's

2483
02:25:38,831 --> 02:25:43,831
sometimes used.
These people had been paying tribute to 

2484
02:25:43,831 --> 02:25:47,050
creases and the Lydians and Cyrus had 
gone to them before the war with creases

2485
02:25:47,051 --> 02:25:48,340
in the Lydians and said,
listen,

2486
02:25:48,760 --> 02:25:52,360
how about you revolt against creases?
And they said no,

2487
02:25:52,630 --> 02:25:54,640
and some of them fought on creases 
aside.

2488
02:25:54,641 --> 02:25:59,641
So after Cyrus winds,
all the people in the region are coming 

2489
02:25:59,641 --> 02:25:59,641
to him to kind of say,
Hey,

2490
02:25:59,641 --> 02:26:00,370
boss,
I always wanted you to win.

2491
02:26:00,371 --> 02:26:01,990
I'm glad.
I'm glad you're victorious.

2492
02:26:01,991 --> 02:26:04,750
And Dha in the case of these Greeks,
they went to him and said,

2493
02:26:04,751 --> 02:26:09,751
can we have the same deal we had with 
the lydians and cyrus gets mad at them.

2494
02:26:09,881 --> 02:26:11,200
We're told.
He basically says,

2495
02:26:11,320 --> 02:26:14,080
you could've had that deal if you join 
me and didn't fight against me.

2496
02:26:14,081 --> 02:26:19,081
Now you want a special deal over all the
other people in this region who didn't 

2497
02:26:19,081 --> 02:26:19,081
fight against me

2498
02:26:20,790 --> 02:26:23,880
and got mad.
And those Greeks went back home,

2499
02:26:23,900 --> 02:26:28,900
had a big meeting amongst each other,
started rebuilding the walls of their 

2500
02:26:28,900 --> 02:26:32,661
cities,
which they had knocked down and you 

2501
02:26:32,661 --> 02:26:32,661
know,
as part of their deal with creases,

2502
02:26:32,661 --> 02:26:34,350
um,
and put the word out for help.

2503
02:26:34,950 --> 02:26:39,950
And they sent word to the spartans.
Now the spartans had also promised help 

2504
02:26:40,721 --> 02:26:45,450
decrease this when he was in trouble.
Supposedly they were just getting in the

2505
02:26:45,451 --> 02:26:47,040
boats,
getting ready to go help.

2506
02:26:47,041 --> 02:26:52,041
When in 14 days the Lydian capital falls
didn't give him enough time to get 

2507
02:26:52,041 --> 02:26:52,620
there.
Now they get,

2508
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:54,780
you know,
in a very short period of time,

2509
02:26:54,781 --> 02:26:58,410
a second call for help.
And this time from Greeks,

2510
02:26:59,870 --> 02:27:01,910
it's about the Persians,
just like that last call,

2511
02:27:01,911 --> 02:27:03,770
these Persians must be a troublesome 
people.

2512
02:27:04,040 --> 02:27:07,430
The spartans were a little busy when the
message came,

2513
02:27:07,820 --> 02:27:11,510
but they sent an emissary to talk to 
this Persian.

2514
02:27:11,511 --> 02:27:16,511
Now every historian I'm reading is 
assuming that these Persians and these 

2515
02:27:16,511 --> 02:27:20,701
spartans do not know each other,
that this may be the first time they 

2516
02:27:20,930 --> 02:27:25,930
ever encounter one another.
It seems illogical considering all the 

2517
02:27:25,930 --> 02:27:29,420
trading and whatnot going on,
but let's understand best case scenario,

2518
02:27:29,421 --> 02:27:32,480
it's unusual and these people don't 
really know each other,

2519
02:27:32,720 --> 02:27:35,780
and a spartan diplomat shows up in front
of Cyrus,

2520
02:27:35,781 --> 02:27:40,781
we're told,
and we have one of these wonderful 

2521
02:27:40,781 --> 02:27:42,851
periods.
We can imagine our Clint Eastwood type 

2522
02:27:44,271 --> 02:27:48,800
figures showing up in front of this king
on the rise.

2523
02:27:48,801 --> 02:27:53,801
Again,
I try to imagine in Alexander the great 

2524
02:27:53,801 --> 02:27:56,141
light like figure on the rise must've 
been a pretty good looking guy because 

2525
02:27:56,391 --> 02:28:01,391
we're told that the Persians standards 
of beauty were modeled on him ever 

2526
02:28:01,391 --> 02:28:01,391
afterwards.

2527
02:28:03,350 --> 02:28:07,790
This is the way Hurghada tests from my 
purpose translation,

2528
02:28:07,791 --> 02:28:12,791
describes the diplomat talking to the 
king of the Persians,

2529
02:28:13,401 --> 02:28:18,401
who conquered lydia and who's just about
to put the hammer down on the Greeks of 

2530
02:28:18,441 --> 02:28:20,660
Asia.
Herata says quote,

2531
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:27,070
and when they arrived at Ikea,
they sent the most distinguished man 

2532
02:28:27,070 --> 02:28:30,251
with them,
name latrines to Sardis to declare to 

2533
02:28:30,251 --> 02:28:32,861
Cyrus in the name of the lack of 
Simonian's that he must not inflict 

2534
02:28:32,861 --> 02:28:36,791
reckless damage on any of the Greek 
territory since the lack of Simonian's 

2535
02:28:36,791 --> 02:28:38,120
would not tolerate it.
Remember,

2536
02:28:38,121 --> 02:28:40,340
liking ammonium is another name for 
spartans.

2537
02:28:40,910 --> 02:28:45,910
Now,
this people that Cyrus has never heard 

2538
02:28:45,910 --> 02:28:46,700
of is just told him not to mess with any
of these people.

2539
02:28:46,701 --> 02:28:51,701
He just conquered and he basically turns
to the Greek advisor next to him and 

2540
02:28:51,701 --> 02:28:56,471
says,
who are these people and how many of 

2541
02:28:56,471 --> 02:28:57,110
them are there?
Hirata to says quote.

2542
02:28:57,650 --> 02:29:00,530
They say that when the Herald had 
delivered this message,

2543
02:29:00,710 --> 02:29:04,310
cyrus question,
the Greeks who were with him asking them

2544
02:29:04,490 --> 02:29:08,810
who were these lack of pneumonia,
who would send such a command to him and

2545
02:29:08,811 --> 02:29:11,880
how many of them were there when he 
heard their response?

2546
02:29:11,930 --> 02:29:15,020
Hirata says,
he said to the Spartan Harold quote,

2547
02:29:15,530 --> 02:29:20,530
I have never yet feared any men who have
a place in the center of the city set 

2548
02:29:20,530 --> 02:29:25,511
aside for meeting together,
swearing false oaths and cheating one 

2549
02:29:25,511 --> 02:29:26,720
another,
and if I live long enough,

2550
02:29:26,960 --> 02:29:30,740
lack of Simonian's will have troubles of
their own about which to converse rather

2551
02:29:30,741 --> 02:29:34,610
than those of the Ionians.
Hurghada test then says,

2552
02:29:35,180 --> 02:29:40,180
quote Cyrus,
thus insulted the Greeks because of 

2553
02:29:40,180 --> 02:29:43,481
their custom of setting up a Gorillaz,
which are marketplaces in their cities 

2554
02:29:43,481 --> 02:29:46,610
for the purpose of buying and selling,
which is unknown among the Persians,

2555
02:29:46,611 --> 02:29:51,611
who do not use markets and indeed have 
no such place as an a gore in any of 

2556
02:29:51,611 --> 02:29:51,890
their cities.

2557
02:29:52,100 --> 02:29:57,080
And to quote this is worth a little 
digression for a second.

2558
02:29:57,081 --> 02:29:58,970
Just from an interest standpoint.
First of all,

2559
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:02,900
Hurghada tests would have probably known
what Persian cities were like.

2560
02:30:03,080 --> 02:30:06,920
He himself was an Ionian Greek or lived 
in an Iranian Greek city.

2561
02:30:06,921 --> 02:30:11,921
He would have known this and that's 
fascinating when you consider that you 

2562
02:30:11,921 --> 02:30:15,131
think of the Middle East now and you 
think of the bazaars and the 

2563
02:30:15,131 --> 02:30:17,501
marketplaces and all that,
but the Persians had this really 

2564
02:30:17,501 --> 02:30:21,140
interesting cultural carrot and stick 
thing going themselves.

2565
02:30:21,141 --> 02:30:26,141
You know,
we've talked about the human laboratory 

2566
02:30:26,141 --> 02:30:26,141
experiment a few times in this program,
like the spartans for example.

2567
02:30:26,540 --> 02:30:30,110
The Persians had a different one going 
and it's fascinating to me.

2568
02:30:30,500 --> 02:30:32,510
Everything you read about them says 
that,

2569
02:30:32,511 --> 02:30:34,460
you know,
of the top three things that,

2570
02:30:34,461 --> 02:30:39,110
that society places import on.
One of them is the truth.

2571
02:30:40,070 --> 02:30:41,990
And the funny thing is,
is in our world today,

2572
02:30:41,991 --> 02:30:42,620
we think,
oh yeah,

2573
02:30:42,621 --> 02:30:43,970
sure,
everybody should tell the truth,

2574
02:30:44,240 --> 02:30:49,240
but what if you made this like a 
commandment that people took ultra 

2575
02:30:49,240 --> 02:30:53,741
seriously?
We told you earlier that when the 

2576
02:30:53,741 --> 02:30:53,741
Spartan told xerxes about the Persians,
he said,

2577
02:30:53,741 --> 02:30:54,770
if I'm lying,
you know,

2578
02:30:54,771 --> 02:30:59,771
treat me like a liar.
And I told you that that's a death 

2579
02:30:59,771 --> 02:31:02,681
penalty.
The Persians took lying really 

2580
02:31:02,681 --> 02:31:03,860
seriously.
We're told that the education of Persian

2581
02:31:03,861 --> 02:31:06,920
male youth was to learn to ride,
to learn,

2582
02:31:06,921 --> 02:31:08,510
to shoot the bow,
and to learn,

2583
02:31:08,511 --> 02:31:11,240
not to lie,
to tell the truth.

2584
02:31:12,590 --> 02:31:17,590
Isn't it fascinating to imagine a 
society where this was both a state and 

2585
02:31:17,590 --> 02:31:20,310
legal requirement perhaps,
and certainly

2586
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:22,830
a heavily,
you know,

2587
02:31:22,860 --> 02:31:25,710
encouraged and incentivized cultural 
norm.

2588
02:31:25,800 --> 02:31:30,800
Thou shalt not lie.
It almost becomes like the plot to one 

2589
02:31:30,800 --> 02:31:30,800
of those movies,
you know,

2590
02:31:30,800 --> 02:31:33,660
where the main character drink some 
potion and all of a sudden,

2591
02:31:33,820 --> 02:31:38,820
you know,
is forced to tell the truth all the 

2592
02:31:38,820 --> 02:31:38,820
time.
What if you had a society like that?

2593
02:31:38,820 --> 02:31:40,530
What what Cyrus is saying to the 
spartans is,

2594
02:31:40,531 --> 02:31:45,531
I can't respect any people who have 
these places in their cities set up 

2595
02:31:45,531 --> 02:31:47,400
where people can specifically go to lie 
to one another,

2596
02:31:48,310 --> 02:31:50,230
and by the way,
without going too deeply into it,

2597
02:31:50,500 --> 02:31:55,500
there's a lot of connection to Persian 
religious beliefs during this time 

2598
02:31:55,500 --> 02:31:58,891
period.
And how that plays into the question of 

2599
02:31:58,891 --> 02:32:01,240
lying.
The Persians were worshipers of who were

2600
02:32:01,241 --> 02:32:06,241
a Mazda was a God's name and the old 
needs used to worship a god named 

2601
02:32:06,241 --> 02:32:07,420
Mithra.
And there's connections between good and

2602
02:32:07,421 --> 02:32:11,200
evil that some religious experts tied to
Christianity and ancient Judaism.

2603
02:32:11,201 --> 02:32:12,490
And,
and who the heck knows?

2604
02:32:12,491 --> 02:32:15,820
All you know is that it's not just a 
cultural and legal question,

2605
02:32:15,821 --> 02:32:17,170
it's a religious one.
Two,

2606
02:32:17,860 --> 02:32:22,860
it's interesting to speculate how much 
people still lied in a society with that

2607
02:32:23,531 --> 02:32:28,531
many things favoring the truth.
It's interesting to think about now 

2608
02:32:28,531 --> 02:32:30,160
they're human laboratory experiment,
if you will,

2609
02:32:30,161 --> 02:32:33,100
the truthful society.
And how realistic is that?

2610
02:32:34,610 --> 02:32:39,610
Nonetheless,
we have now set the stage for problems 

2611
02:32:39,771 --> 02:32:43,970
between the Greeks and the Persians.
From this point on,

2612
02:32:44,060 --> 02:32:46,580
if you want to call it a clash of 
civilizations,

2613
02:32:46,581 --> 02:32:49,250
you who have marketplaces in lie and we 
who don't.

2614
02:32:49,251 --> 02:32:52,190
It's about to happen.
Lucky for the spartans.

2615
02:32:52,191 --> 02:32:55,700
They'll get to stay out of it for awhile
because Cyrus isn't done conquering yet.

2616
02:32:55,820 --> 02:32:57,050
Not by a long shot.

2617
02:32:58,510 --> 02:33:03,510
Historians still discuss whether or not 
cyrus should be seen as an intentional,

2618
02:33:05,231 --> 02:33:07,030
you know,
a conscious conquer river.

2619
02:33:07,100 --> 02:33:09,490
Allah Alexander the great or Napoleon.
You know,

2620
02:33:09,491 --> 02:33:14,491
somebody who's sat down and said,
I'm going to recreate the old Assyrian 

2621
02:33:14,491 --> 02:33:18,450
Empire or somebody that got involved in 
a bunch of conflicts each for their own 

2622
02:33:18,450 --> 02:33:19,090
reason and you know,
when you,

2623
02:33:19,091 --> 02:33:22,780
when you take over their territory in 
and kind of tripped into empire.

2624
02:33:23,170 --> 02:33:24,910
I mean,
obviously that's a little simplistic,

2625
02:33:25,450 --> 02:33:28,270
but um,
I think it's indicative of how in,

2626
02:33:28,300 --> 02:33:31,420
in certain really key motivational 
areas,

2627
02:33:32,170 --> 02:33:34,060
this guy is still a bit of a mystery.

2628
02:33:35,970 --> 02:33:40,970
He will disappear behind the veil of our
historical site,

2629
02:33:41,011 --> 02:33:44,790
I guess you could say for several years 
after his.

2630
02:33:44,791 --> 02:33:49,791
I'm taking over of Lydia,
he will leave a general who may be this 

2631
02:33:49,791 --> 02:33:53,520
historical heart biggest guy and an army
behind in western Turkey,

2632
02:33:53,521 --> 02:33:58,410
what's now modern day western Turkey to 
reduce these Asiatic Greek cities.

2633
02:33:59,190 --> 02:34:04,190
And he will go.
It's assumed to the eastern part of his 

2634
02:34:04,190 --> 02:34:09,021
realm and the northern part of his realm
and conquer further and also shore up 

2635
02:34:09,871 --> 02:34:14,790
his defenses against the many powerful 
tribes that sort of ring his territory.

2636
02:34:15,660 --> 02:34:20,110
Probably a combination of fighting.
Some of them showing the flag to some of

2637
02:34:20,111 --> 02:34:25,111
them are intermarrying and making 
diplomatic agreements with some of them 

2638
02:34:25,111 --> 02:34:28,690
accepting vassalage from others.
I mean it was years of work.

2639
02:34:29,110 --> 02:34:34,110
So this guy is doing the Yeoman's work,
the hard slogging of creating a stable 

2640
02:34:35,231 --> 02:34:40,231
state and that requires years of 
constant effort and he disappears from 

2641
02:34:40,231 --> 02:34:40,600
the historical record while he's doing 
this.

2642
02:34:41,560 --> 02:34:44,920
And then in 5:39
bce,

2643
02:34:45,370 --> 02:34:50,350
he reappears again at the head of an 
army heading toward Babylon.

2644
02:34:52,090 --> 02:34:57,090
Now what Cyrus is going to do to Babylon
is probably his crowning achievement in 

2645
02:34:57,161 --> 02:35:01,300
his career and I have to remind myself 
that his career is already incredible.

2646
02:35:01,960 --> 02:35:06,960
This is a guy who by 5:39
bce has been a king for about 20 years 

2647
02:35:06,960 --> 02:35:10,390
and in 20 years he's taken this people 
from a virtual,

2648
02:35:10,560 --> 02:35:13,570
you know,
backwater Nowheresville to a point where

2649
02:35:13,571 --> 02:35:18,571
they've conquered half of the great 
nation states in their little ecosystem 

2650
02:35:18,571 --> 02:35:18,571
that exists,
you know,

2651
02:35:18,580 --> 02:35:23,580
after the fall of Assyria.
And he's outside the gates of number 

2652
02:35:23,580 --> 02:35:27,960
three of four with an army.
That's pretty awesome right there for a 

2653
02:35:27,960 --> 02:35:32,130
king of an Sean who will very soon be 
referring to himself as part of his 

2654
02:35:32,831 --> 02:35:35,860
official royal titles as the King of the
universe.

2655
02:35:36,520 --> 02:35:38,620
When you go from an Sean to King of the 
universe,

2656
02:35:38,621 --> 02:35:41,260
that's quite a jump and he's kind of a 
self made conqueror.

2657
02:35:41,410 --> 02:35:46,410
You compare him to someone like 
Alexander the great who is of course 

2658
02:35:46,410 --> 02:35:49,231
awesome,
but Alexander reminds you of sort of a 

2659
02:35:49,231 --> 02:35:52,591
historical rich kid who inherits his 
father's already thriving corporation 

2660
02:35:52,601 --> 02:35:55,180
with tons of ready cash and does great 
things with it.

2661
02:35:55,630 --> 02:35:58,000
No offense to Alexander,
it's awesome,

2662
02:35:58,870 --> 02:36:03,870
but Cyrus never had any of those 
advantages and look where he is only 20 

2663
02:36:03,870 --> 02:36:07,741
years into his reign.
Now let me just voice my own opinion 

2664
02:36:07,741 --> 02:36:11,860
that that what Cyrus is about to do to 
Babylon is strange.

2665
02:36:11,920 --> 02:36:15,400
You can't tell what the sources,
what's really going on and the different

2666
02:36:15,401 --> 02:36:20,401
histories have different approaches to 
it and it's been argued about and and 

2667
02:36:20,401 --> 02:36:20,980
the views have changed and updated over 
time.

2668
02:36:21,220 --> 02:36:26,220
There's just not enough hard sources 
though for anyone to really know for 

2669
02:36:26,220 --> 02:36:30,121
anyone to conclusively when I'm 
certainly not going to take a position 

2670
02:36:30,121 --> 02:36:33,991
on it,
but I am going to explain sort of the 

2671
02:36:33,991 --> 02:36:33,991
weirdness of it.

2672
02:36:33,991 --> 02:36:36,990
The first thing you have to ask is 
whether or not cyrus arriving outside 

2673
02:36:37,001 --> 02:36:42,001
Babylon when he did was a coincidence 
because the timing is awesome if you're 

2674
02:36:42,001 --> 02:36:45,760
hoping to take over Babylon.
Is that just because he gets lucky or is

2675
02:36:45,761 --> 02:36:50,761
that just because of the Babylonian 
propaganda would say later the hand of 

2676
02:36:50,761 --> 02:36:54,241
Marduk had seized him and brought him to
Babylon to get rid of the horrible king 

2677
02:36:54,241 --> 02:36:58,591
of Babylon and restore things.
Just lucky or did Cyrus and the Persians

2678
02:36:59,801 --> 02:37:03,250
have advanced information that things 
suck in Babylon right now?

2679
02:37:03,370 --> 02:37:08,370
You come now and half the population 
will be ready to welcome me with open 

2680
02:37:08,370 --> 02:37:12,391
arms.
Was that may be part of the reason he 

2681
02:37:12,391 --> 02:37:13,120
showed up when he did or as some have 
argued for years.

2682
02:37:13,150 --> 02:37:16,610
Could you make a case that the reason 
that people were so disaffected

2683
02:37:16,610 --> 02:37:21,380
in Babylon was in part due to Persian 
propaganda that undermined it?

2684
02:37:22,180 --> 02:37:25,430
No,
the entire wheel to resist and I have to

2685
02:37:25,431 --> 02:37:30,431
be honest,
I did not understand that part of the 

2686
02:37:30,431 --> 02:37:33,071
story for years growing up,
but something has changed in the way 

2687
02:37:33,071 --> 02:37:33,071
historian's view it,
so now makes more sense to me.

2688
02:37:33,350 --> 02:37:35,660
When I was growing up,
the attitude was that in 5:39

2689
02:37:35,661 --> 02:37:37,700
BC,
this was when Cyrus arrived.

2690
02:37:38,030 --> 02:37:43,030
So something happens and occurs in 
Babylon falls and Cyrus takes it over 

2691
02:37:43,030 --> 02:37:44,510
and there you go.
So this idea that he had this propaganda

2692
02:37:44,511 --> 02:37:48,050
undermining Babylon made you think about
when,

2693
02:37:48,680 --> 02:37:53,680
when was that going to happen?
I mean just everything happened so 

2694
02:37:53,680 --> 02:37:53,780
quickly.
The modern way of viewing this amongst a

2695
02:37:53,781 --> 02:37:58,781
lot of historians is that may be the 
Persians in the Babylonians had been 

2696
02:37:58,781 --> 02:38:00,380
fighting battles for a couple of years 
and that in 5:39

2697
02:38:00,381 --> 02:38:03,230
when Cyrus in his army show up outside 
of Babylon,

2698
02:38:03,620 --> 02:38:06,770
that's like the end of the Second World 
War when the Russians show up outside of

2699
02:38:06,771 --> 02:38:09,290
Berlin and you're having your last 
climactic battle,

2700
02:38:09,670 --> 02:38:11,780
you know,
in a multi battle long war.

2701
02:38:12,590 --> 02:38:17,590
Again,
the sources are just not there to 

2702
02:38:17,590 --> 02:38:17,590
confirm any of this,
you know,

2703
02:38:17,590 --> 02:38:21,790
categorically.
But it would make a heck of a lot more 

2704
02:38:21,790 --> 02:38:24,461
sense if you were saying that Cyrus and 
the Persians were undermining the 

2705
02:38:24,461 --> 02:38:27,011
Babylonians with propaganda.
If you had years to do it right now,

2706
02:38:27,081 --> 02:38:32,081
understanding what Cyrus might've been 
doing requires talking about Babylon 

2707
02:38:32,081 --> 02:38:34,130
itself a little bit like the Assyrian 
city of Nineveh.

2708
02:38:34,640 --> 02:38:39,640
This is a great urban center and it's 
large enough and complex enough so that 

2709
02:38:39,681 --> 02:38:42,620
you see a lot of the same sorts of 
dynamics going on.

2710
02:38:43,010 --> 02:38:48,010
You know,
I'll be it through an ancient lens that 

2711
02:38:48,010 --> 02:38:48,010
you would see in any modern large city 
today.

2712
02:38:48,800 --> 02:38:51,050
There are fissures,
there are divisions,

2713
02:38:51,350 --> 02:38:55,100
there are tensions,
there are disagreements there.

2714
02:38:55,101 --> 02:38:57,740
There are all sorts of things that if 
someone wanted to come in,

2715
02:38:57,741 --> 02:39:02,741
they could widen the disagreements and 
it's slowly but surely increase the 

2716
02:39:02,741 --> 02:39:05,510
level of anger and discontent.

2717
02:39:06,800 --> 02:39:08,750
There's a number of things to be 
exploited.

2718
02:39:08,751 --> 02:39:12,980
To start with the fact that the king is 
unpopular.

2719
02:39:14,150 --> 02:39:19,150
The king of Babylon during this time 
period almost certainly suffers from 

2720
02:39:19,150 --> 02:39:21,590
from bad,
bad historical publicity.

2721
02:39:21,591 --> 02:39:26,591
His name is nab Unitus,
and by the time all of this is going 

2722
02:39:26,591 --> 02:39:26,591
down,
nab and I.

2723
02:39:26,591 --> 02:39:30,770
This is about 70,
70 years old in a world,

2724
02:39:31,350 --> 02:39:33,560
you know,
with the lifespan is so much shorter.

2725
02:39:33,650 --> 02:39:37,730
How many 70 year old people are there?
He's like a wizard,

2726
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:43,160
you know,
to the population in terms of this is a 

2727
02:39:43,160 --> 02:39:45,431
guy whose memory goes back to events.
Most people can't get anywhere near 

2728
02:39:45,431 --> 02:39:50,280
memory wise.
He may have been the general who helped 

2729
02:39:50,280 --> 02:39:52,730
seal the deal between those two sides at
the battle of the eclipse.

2730
02:39:52,731 --> 02:39:55,600
Remember when they suck each other's 
blood as part of a,

2731
02:39:55,830 --> 02:39:56,870
you know,
sealing the deal.

2732
02:39:56,871 --> 02:39:57,290
This,
this,

2733
02:39:57,440 --> 02:40:02,440
this nab unitus guy when he was much 
younger and more vigorous may have been 

2734
02:40:02,440 --> 02:40:05,621
one of the generals on site.
Now he's old and it's really hard to get

2735
02:40:06,081 --> 02:40:08,330
your mind around what this guy was 
really like.

2736
02:40:09,560 --> 02:40:14,560
He sort of portrayed as a,
as a kind of a doting antiquarian

2737
02:40:15,390 --> 02:40:20,390
by some historians.
Some people consider him the first 

2738
02:40:20,390 --> 02:40:23,631
official archeologist.
I think that's got to be crazy because 

2739
02:40:23,631 --> 02:40:23,880
because there were lots of earlier kings
who were into digging up,

2740
02:40:24,090 --> 02:40:26,280
you know,
earlier versions of their civilization.

2741
02:40:26,281 --> 02:40:30,630
But this guy is portrayed as somebody 
who almost prefers it to being a king.

2742
02:40:30,631 --> 02:40:33,300
He'd rather be out there,
Indiana Jonesing,

2743
02:40:33,630 --> 02:40:37,830
some old Babylonian stuff from the 
previous kings and then dealing with the

2744
02:40:37,831 --> 02:40:38,850
day to day government.

2745
02:40:40,490 --> 02:40:44,030
He also looks like a guy who doesn't 
mind getting out of Babylon.

2746
02:40:44,630 --> 02:40:49,630
I have this image for the movie of some 
I want to use like the guy who played 

2747
02:40:49,630 --> 02:40:50,330
the the scientists,
the doctor,

2748
02:40:50,331 --> 02:40:55,331
and back to the future and have him be 
nab rhinitis and just have him sort of 

2749
02:40:55,331 --> 02:40:58,070
did finding the hustle and bustle of 
Babylon too much in those young kids and

2750
02:40:58,071 --> 02:41:03,071
they're loud music and all that stuff.
So he and the priesthood of Babylon,

2751
02:41:04,250 --> 02:41:09,250
especially the main important God Marduk
begin to have these disagreements.

2752
02:41:10,430 --> 02:41:13,760
Now understand something in the world 
before modern times.

2753
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:19,000
There is really only one reliable 
counterbalance to the power of a king or

2754
02:41:19,011 --> 02:41:20,540
an emperor pharaoh.

2755
02:41:21,810 --> 02:41:26,810
And that's the priesthood and the 
religion because the power that that 

2756
02:41:26,810 --> 02:41:28,800
they have stems from the same source,
right?

2757
02:41:28,801 --> 02:41:30,150
You're,
you're king by divine,

2758
02:41:30,151 --> 02:41:32,100
right?
It's the gods who want you to be a king,

2759
02:41:32,580 --> 02:41:37,580
but who has a special relationship with 
the gods and who helps placate the gods 

2760
02:41:37,580 --> 02:41:41,311
and who does the work of the Gods and 
who knows what the God really wants 

2761
02:41:41,311 --> 02:41:41,311
while the priesthood and the religion.
Right?

2762
02:41:41,311 --> 02:41:45,471
So the only other source of legitimate 
power in these societies before modern 

2763
02:41:46,711 --> 02:41:51,711
times are often,
you know the priest and the priest and 

2764
02:41:51,711 --> 02:41:51,711
Martech don't like this nab.
Tonight is guy,

2765
02:41:51,711 --> 02:41:55,971
and part of the reason why is he seems 
to be kind of will favoring another God 

2766
02:41:56,910 --> 02:41:57,790
over.
There's.

2767
02:41:58,890 --> 02:42:03,890
This is what I mean by it's hard to get 
your mind around Nabonidus because he 

2768
02:42:03,890 --> 02:42:05,310
may be like an [inaudible] type 
character.

2769
02:42:05,311 --> 02:42:10,311
You know the Egyptian Pharaoh that may 
have been a monotheist and may have 

2770
02:42:10,311 --> 02:42:10,530
tried to change Egypt's religion.

2771
02:42:10,950 --> 02:42:12,270
Another similar story,
right?

2772
02:42:12,271 --> 02:42:17,271
Where you have the autocratic ruler 
opposed by a powerful priesthood and 

2773
02:42:17,340 --> 02:42:22,340
after Aka not died,
things returned back to normal and they 

2774
02:42:22,340 --> 02:42:22,340
kind of were carving his face off of all
of the old things.

2775
02:42:22,340 --> 02:42:23,940
Trying to forget he ever lived.
Now,

2776
02:42:23,941 --> 02:42:26,370
urbanite is may have been one of these 
guys to the one of the change,

2777
02:42:26,371 --> 02:42:30,540
the religion.
His mother was supposedly a priestess of

2778
02:42:30,541 --> 02:42:33,930
a religion devoted to a god named sin,
a Moon God,

2779
02:42:34,980 --> 02:42:37,230
and so nab tonight is right before this 
time period,

2780
02:42:37,231 --> 02:42:42,231
gives the ultimate middle finger to the 
priesthood of Marduk by leaving Babylon 

2781
02:42:43,231 --> 02:42:45,960
and going to some Arabian oasis.

2782
02:42:47,470 --> 02:42:52,470
Now,
historians in modern times if found all 

2783
02:42:52,470 --> 02:42:54,400
sorts of really good logical patriotic 
reasons why the king might do that.

2784
02:42:54,430 --> 02:42:58,180
In past times it was much more portrayed
like this guy is a mystic,

2785
02:42:58,990 --> 02:43:03,280
either a mystic or an old man or a 
combination of the two and he just wants

2786
02:43:03,281 --> 02:43:08,281
to get away from is unworthy people and 
he appreciates it more in these Arabian 

2787
02:43:08,281 --> 02:43:12,601
oasis.
It's probably what modern historians 

2788
02:43:12,601 --> 02:43:12,601
think.
He's probably,

2789
02:43:12,601 --> 02:43:12,670
they're doing important work for the 
country,

2790
02:43:12,671 --> 02:43:15,580
but he's missing important work.
At the same time,

2791
02:43:16,330 --> 02:43:21,330
the Babylonians required their king to 
be there once a year for a New Year's 

2792
02:43:21,330 --> 02:43:25,141
festival.
It was important he had to physically 

2793
02:43:25,141 --> 02:43:27,721
grasp the hand of the God in front of 
the population once a year to ensure 

2794
02:43:27,721 --> 02:43:32,310
success and good things and all these 
kinds of deals and he stayed away for 

2795
02:43:32,310 --> 02:43:35,881
like a decade on the Babylonian records 
will say every year the king was not 

2796
02:43:35,881 --> 02:43:40,591
here for the ceremony or what have you,
and they're getting pissed that he's 

2797
02:43:40,591 --> 02:43:43,630
putting more money into creating more of
these temples for the other religion,

2798
02:43:43,720 --> 02:43:48,720
denying some money that the people of 
Marduk expect and and you can just see 

2799
02:43:48,720 --> 02:43:48,820
it boiling over.

2800
02:43:48,820 --> 02:43:50,710
Right.
And then the kings not even there.

2801
02:43:50,860 --> 02:43:55,150
His son Belshazzar is ruling as a region
and he's not popular either,

2802
02:43:56,230 --> 02:44:01,230
so the king is part of it,
but Babylon is going through tough 

2803
02:44:01,230 --> 02:44:04,090
economic times two and that's putting 
the squeeze on people.

2804
02:44:04,091 --> 02:44:06,760
They're having problems with disease and
that's causing unrest.

2805
02:44:07,570 --> 02:44:10,420
Archeologists,
Dr Joan oats describes,

2806
02:44:10,830 --> 02:44:13,030
you know the down and dirty parts of,
of,

2807
02:44:13,130 --> 02:44:15,190
of day to day suffering and let's 
remember something.

2808
02:44:15,191 --> 02:44:19,210
Babylon's banking system and financial 
system was developed enough so that they

2809
02:44:19,211 --> 02:44:24,211
had great banking houses there that were
very powerful and lived on long after 

2810
02:44:24,211 --> 02:44:28,921
this period and the end,
and that's just another one of those 

2811
02:44:28,921 --> 02:44:29,560
dynamics that makes us think about 
modern times.

2812
02:44:29,561 --> 02:44:33,580
These are powerful interests that have 
some authority in the state.

2813
02:44:34,030 --> 02:44:39,030
What happens when things seemed to be 
falling apart and people are losing 

2814
02:44:39,030 --> 02:44:42,121
money and times are bad and and you 
start getting Persian propaganda about 

2815
02:44:42,121 --> 02:44:44,440
this king who sounds like things are 
going his way,

2816
02:44:44,441 --> 02:44:49,441
which remember during this time period 
might have caused a lot of people to 

2817
02:44:49,441 --> 02:44:52,501
figure the gods are smiling on that guy 
and our kings not even showing up to 

2818
02:44:52,501 --> 02:44:53,770
shake the God's hand every New Year's.

2819
02:44:53,770 --> 02:44:58,770
Right.
Here's the way Dr Joan oats describes 

2820
02:44:58,770 --> 02:45:01,321
the situation in Babylon considering 
also remember that this king looks like 

2821
02:45:01,321 --> 02:45:02,890
a guy who's trying to change religious 
traditions,

2822
02:45:02,891 --> 02:45:04,240
trying to change a bunch of other 
things,

2823
02:45:04,300 --> 02:45:05,440
and Dr.
oates writes,

2824
02:45:05,441 --> 02:45:10,441
quote clearly Nabil [inaudible] is 
religious and administrative reforms 

2825
02:45:10,441 --> 02:45:15,330
provoked great resentment.
While the wars and extensive building 

2826
02:45:15,330 --> 02:45:19,021
programs of his predecessors had proved 
a severe burden on the country's 

2827
02:45:19,021 --> 02:45:22,951
resources,
large numbers of economic texts reveal 

2828
02:45:22,951 --> 02:45:24,670
severe inflation.
A situation now made worse by the spread

2829
02:45:24,671 --> 02:45:28,340
of plague between five slash 60 bce and 
5:50

2830
02:45:28,600 --> 02:45:32,170
bce,
prices rose by up to 50 percent and from

2831
02:45:32,171 --> 02:45:34,450
five 62,
four 85 bce,

2832
02:45:34,451 --> 02:45:39,451
the total increase amount of some 200 
percent and not just that,

2833
02:45:40,780 --> 02:45:42,670
but again,
take this with a grain of salt.

2834
02:45:42,671 --> 02:45:47,671
It's argued about but,
but there are people inside Babylon who 

2835
02:45:47,671 --> 02:45:49,600
might be considered,
shall we say,

2836
02:45:49,630 --> 02:45:54,190
vulnerable to propaganda that created 
descent.

2837
02:45:54,910 --> 02:45:59,910
There are a lot of people in Babylon who
are there because they were forcibly 

2838
02:45:59,910 --> 02:46:04,621
taken once upon a time from where they 
came from and some of the propaganda 

2839
02:46:06,670 --> 02:46:08,680
afterwards.
Certainly the post,

2840
02:46:09,380 --> 02:46:09,980
but maybe some

2841
02:46:09,980 --> 02:46:14,980
of the pre propaganda to from Cyrus told
these people that if the Persians were 

2842
02:46:14,980 --> 02:46:17,420
to take over,
they get to go home.

2843
02:46:18,500 --> 02:46:23,500
Start with the deportees from Judah.
Jewish people today.

2844
02:46:24,381 --> 02:46:25,340
There are,
there are still,

2845
02:46:25,760 --> 02:46:27,060
I'm sure still,
you know,

2846
02:46:27,061 --> 02:46:32,061
even with all the troubles Jews in that 
part of the world today that are 

2847
02:46:32,061 --> 02:46:36,071
descendants of people who were forcibly 
removed after the Babylonians sacked 

2848
02:46:36,071 --> 02:46:38,840
Jerusalem.
What if Cyrus was telling those people,

2849
02:46:39,260 --> 02:46:41,090
if I get a fight,
could empower you,

2850
02:46:41,091 --> 02:46:43,340
can go home,
and what if he was telling all the other

2851
02:46:43,341 --> 02:46:47,960
deportees the same thing.
Now in historians refer to Cyrus and the

2852
02:46:47,961 --> 02:46:52,961
Persians propaganda.
The first idea that comes to mind is 

2853
02:46:52,961 --> 02:46:56,441
like negative propaganda,
like the Nazi stuff designed to lie to 

2854
02:46:56,441 --> 02:46:56,960
people and get you to believe things 
that aren't true,

2855
02:46:57,740 --> 02:47:02,740
but you could make a case that that 
since we know that Cyrus and the 

2856
02:47:02,740 --> 02:47:05,720
Persians will eventually actually do 
what they're saying here,

2857
02:47:05,750 --> 02:47:06,050
right?

2858
02:47:06,080 --> 02:47:07,700
That they will,
for example,

2859
02:47:07,701 --> 02:47:12,701
allow the Jews to go back to Judah and 
reestablish their religion and even 

2860
02:47:12,701 --> 02:47:16,040
eventually pay for some of the 
rebuilding of the second temple.

2861
02:47:16,280 --> 02:47:19,130
What will be the second temple with,
with royal funds,

2862
02:47:19,460 --> 02:47:21,080
when you know that they're actually 
going to do that?

2863
02:47:21,290 --> 02:47:26,290
Maybe you could say that this propaganda
is a lot more like dropping leaflets 

2864
02:47:26,290 --> 02:47:28,790
over enemy military lines that say 
something like,

2865
02:47:28,791 --> 02:47:29,870
you know,
surrendered to us.

2866
02:47:29,871 --> 02:47:33,090
We don't hurt prisoners and we'll give 
you a hot meal and you know,

2867
02:47:33,110 --> 02:47:34,670
a few bucks in your pocket and some 
cigarettes.

2868
02:47:34,671 --> 02:47:35,810
What would they have done in the old 
days?

2869
02:47:37,370 --> 02:47:41,390
Maybe this is like telling the people 
inside Babylon do not fear.

2870
02:47:41,690 --> 02:47:46,070
I may be coming,
but I'm going to send you home now.

2871
02:47:46,820 --> 02:47:51,820
Real experts on this Ip embryonic 
caution us against thinking about this 

2872
02:47:51,820 --> 02:47:55,991
the way that I just described to you 
that this is a a conscious policy of 

2873
02:47:56,601 --> 02:47:57,230
toleration.

2874
02:47:57,230 --> 02:48:00,260
He says,
the way the marketing really is is a lot

2875
02:48:00,261 --> 02:48:05,261
more like cyrus's,
Assyrian and Babylonian predecessors 

2876
02:48:05,261 --> 02:48:09,220
where he's essentially promising 
continuity and because continuity means 

2877
02:48:10,251 --> 02:48:13,910
allowing these people to do things the 
way that they're accustomed to do it,

2878
02:48:14,420 --> 02:48:19,420
it seems like tolerance and he points 
out that it's normal for conquerors in 

2879
02:48:19,420 --> 02:48:24,281
this region even before this time period
to come in and promise to restore 

2880
02:48:24,281 --> 02:48:25,760
everything that's wrong.
The gods are upset.

2881
02:48:25,761 --> 02:48:28,040
I will fix that.
The economy is bad.

2882
02:48:28,041 --> 02:48:33,041
I will fix that.
You are kept away from your home and 

2883
02:48:33,041 --> 02:48:33,041
your gods are just,
you know,

2884
02:48:33,041 --> 02:48:36,080
I will fix that,
the restore and recreate her of order.

2885
02:48:37,540 --> 02:48:41,690
So whatever you want to call this.
In 5:39,

2886
02:48:42,260 --> 02:48:47,260
cyrus and the Babylonian army meet and 
in a battle where there seems to have 

2887
02:48:47,841 --> 02:48:50,150
been a really nasty massacre.
At the end,

2888
02:48:50,660 --> 02:48:55,660
the Babylonian army was defeated the 
rest of the troops that are run back to 

2889
02:48:55,660 --> 02:49:00,611
the very formidable defenses of the city
and within two days,

2890
02:49:01,850 --> 02:49:06,850
somehow the gates of the city are opened
and Cyrus's general is marching through 

2891
02:49:06,850 --> 02:49:08,070
the streets and triumph in Babylon

2892
02:49:08,070 --> 02:49:13,070
falls.
And now tonight is fleas and he's 

2893
02:49:13,070 --> 02:49:13,890
eventually captured and supposedly 
treated well by Cyrus.

2894
02:49:13,891 --> 02:49:17,220
Just like all the other kings were 
Hurghada.

2895
02:49:17,221 --> 02:49:22,221
This of course has to give us a 
stratagem story of how it happened this 

2896
02:49:22,221 --> 02:49:22,221
time.
It involves,

2897
02:49:22,221 --> 02:49:26,540
you know,
waiting till they can get the river 

2898
02:49:26,540 --> 02:49:28,461
down,
the flows through the city to a certain 

2899
02:49:28,461 --> 02:49:30,501
length or to a point where the troops 
can go through the marshes or what have 

2900
02:49:30,501 --> 02:49:34,221
you and capture the city.
And I think he's one of the ones that 

2901
02:49:34,221 --> 02:49:37,521
say that the city didn't even know it 
was being captured because there was 

2902
02:49:37,521 --> 02:49:37,521
some,
you know,

2903
02:49:37,521 --> 02:49:41,920
revelry going on attached to a religious
cult and the city so big anyway mean 

2904
02:49:42,931 --> 02:49:47,931
modern excavations put the city size is 
over 2000 acres and the wall 

2905
02:49:48,961 --> 02:49:53,160
circumference at about 11 miles.
So it's possible that in one part of the

2906
02:49:53,161 --> 02:49:56,310
city where they were partying it up and 
the Persians got in,

2907
02:49:57,360 --> 02:50:00,330
the natural thing to do would be to 
throw out a story like that and blame it

2908
02:50:00,331 --> 02:50:01,630
on typical,
you know,

2909
02:50:01,750 --> 02:50:03,380
Greek stereotypes and whatnot.

2910
02:50:03,420 --> 02:50:08,420
But it should be pointed out one that 
oftentimes in these ancient religions 

2911
02:50:08,420 --> 02:50:12,630
there was an awful lot of decadent or 
fun or depends on your point of view,

2912
02:50:12,631 --> 02:50:15,750
I guess stuff that was part of the 
religious rights.

2913
02:50:15,751 --> 02:50:20,751
And you'll see this in Greece and Rome 
and a ton of other religions the world 

2914
02:50:20,751 --> 02:50:20,751
over,
especially in the ancient period.

2915
02:50:20,751 --> 02:50:22,830
And these people are immensely 
religious.

2916
02:50:22,831 --> 02:50:25,620
The Babylonians especially,
it's a holy city of Mesopotamia,

2917
02:50:25,621 --> 02:50:26,850
right?
These are very religious people.

2918
02:50:26,851 --> 02:50:30,990
So imagine people with the commitment of
like a Taliban,

2919
02:50:31,260 --> 02:50:36,260
right?
The seriousness with which they take 

2920
02:50:36,260 --> 02:50:36,260
this in stride and militancy and all 
that,

2921
02:50:36,260 --> 02:50:40,790
but you might be commanded to party.
It's a party for God and if you're not 

2922
02:50:40,790 --> 02:50:42,720
there,
the ramifications could be huge.

2923
02:50:42,930 --> 02:50:47,930
Right?
I'm inclined to think that it's a Greek 

2924
02:50:47,930 --> 02:50:51,501
stereotype of course,
but there's a part of me that wants to 

2925
02:50:51,501 --> 02:50:51,501
believe it's the latter.

2926
02:50:51,660 --> 02:50:52,380
Now,
the one thing,

2927
02:50:52,381 --> 02:50:55,470
this conquest,
if that's even the right word of Babylon

2928
02:50:55,471 --> 02:51:00,471
is known for is the fact that it's 
generally considered to be bloodless and

2929
02:51:01,890 --> 02:51:06,890
forget that battle we talked about with 
the nasty potential massacre at the end 

2930
02:51:06,890 --> 02:51:10,650
when the city of Babylon is taken,
it's taken essentially voluntarily.

2931
02:51:10,651 --> 02:51:12,780
I mean it's like the Babylonians open up
the door and Cyrus says,

2932
02:51:12,781 --> 02:51:15,480
general comes in and 17 or so days 
later,

2933
02:51:15,481 --> 02:51:17,910
Cyrus himself comes in and we're told 
that the population,

2934
02:51:18,190 --> 02:51:23,190
you know,
gets in front of his chariot and lays 

2935
02:51:23,190 --> 02:51:25,011
down palm fronds and stuff,
which some historians in the old days 

2936
02:51:25,011 --> 02:51:27,350
used to be sure was a sign of how much 
people wanted them.

2937
02:51:27,360 --> 02:51:32,360
They're more modern day historian's.
Point out that that's generally how you 

2938
02:51:32,360 --> 02:51:35,901
get treated when you come into a city 
that's trying to show that they're no 

2939
02:51:35,901 --> 02:51:36,090
threat at all and please don't hurt us.

2940
02:51:37,350 --> 02:51:42,090
That's perhaps what the Persian takeover
of Babylon is most known for.

2941
02:51:42,450 --> 02:51:46,620
Cyrus didn't hurt anybody,
and as I said earlier,

2942
02:51:46,680 --> 02:51:51,680
Naba is his life is spared,
which supposedly is the same fate that 

2943
02:51:52,621 --> 02:51:55,170
Cyrus has made it out to all the kings 
he's faced,

2944
02:51:55,171 --> 02:51:59,370
which by the way is not only unusual,
but it's not even maybe true.

2945
02:51:59,371 --> 02:52:04,371
Who knows?
There are always little hints somewhere 

2946
02:52:04,371 --> 02:52:04,371
that maybe Cyrus killed these kings and 
the propaganda covered it up.

2947
02:52:04,371 --> 02:52:06,250
Nonetheless,
historically and traditionally,

2948
02:52:06,460 --> 02:52:10,330
he supposed to have spared and given 
good lives to all these other kings.

2949
02:52:10,331 --> 02:52:13,420
He defeated osteotomies of the medes 
creases of the Lydians.

2950
02:52:13,570 --> 02:52:15,730
Now,
now benign cysts of the Babylonians.

2951
02:52:16,880 --> 02:52:19,910
What is the message Cyrus is trying to 
send here?

2952
02:52:19,911 --> 02:52:21,380
I mean,
that's what I find interesting.

2953
02:52:21,620 --> 02:52:24,890
You want to know a little bit about the 
guy himself and maybe what he was trying

2954
02:52:24,891 --> 02:52:26,780
to do.
What's the message when he does that?

2955
02:52:26,781 --> 02:52:31,781
Because the Assyrian King,
who last conquered Babylon brags about 

2956
02:52:31,781 --> 02:52:36,101
how he tied the king of Babylon up like 
a pig and display them in the center of 

2957
02:52:36,111 --> 02:52:41,111
Nineveh.
So this is not standard operating 

2958
02:52:41,111 --> 02:52:41,111
procedure.
It's one of the things,

2959
02:52:41,111 --> 02:52:42,170
by the way,
that fascinates me about Cyrus,

2960
02:52:42,950 --> 02:52:45,200
because the outcomes razor approach to 
history,

2961
02:52:45,201 --> 02:52:46,790
which is the right way to go.
I mean,

2962
02:52:46,791 --> 02:52:50,120
what else are you going to do is to 
assume the most logical things,

2963
02:52:50,121 --> 02:52:51,950
right?
You don't assume illogical things.

2964
02:52:52,250 --> 02:52:57,250
So the assumption always is that someone
like Cyrus is playing a hardcore cynical

2965
02:52:57,651 --> 02:52:59,480
propaganda game.
And again,

2966
02:52:59,481 --> 02:53:01,640
odds are probably is most people would 
be,

2967
02:53:02,240 --> 02:53:07,240
but occasionally you're going to get 
some different kind of human being 

2968
02:53:07,240 --> 02:53:07,310
because we see them,
they exist.

2969
02:53:08,610 --> 02:53:12,180
It's just if you're using the alchemist 
razor approach to try to determine,

2970
02:53:12,420 --> 02:53:17,420
you know,
what a gone Gandhi was really like a 

2971
02:53:17,420 --> 02:53:17,420
thousand years from now,
you might be looking at listened.

2972
02:53:17,420 --> 02:53:17,850
Gandhi was really,
um,

2973
02:53:18,150 --> 02:53:20,160
you know,
this was a cynical attempt to figure out

2974
02:53:20,161 --> 02:53:21,480
a way to gain power to level.
I mean,

2975
02:53:21,481 --> 02:53:24,480
you could figure out all these real 
logical reasons why a guy might do this.

2976
02:53:26,330 --> 02:53:31,330
Sometimes people who are doing things 
for mystic reasons or morality reasons 

2977
02:53:31,401 --> 02:53:33,380
or humanistic reasons or any of these 
things.

2978
02:53:33,381 --> 02:53:38,381
Sometimes those people slipped through 
the cracks because it's just so easy to 

2979
02:53:38,381 --> 02:53:40,820
assume they had a more real world,
terra firma reason for doing things.

2980
02:53:41,150 --> 02:53:45,940
Is it possible that cyrus was kind of a 
humanist?

2981
02:53:46,190 --> 02:53:49,370
Maybe you know,
this is how he's portrayed by the way,

2982
02:53:49,371 --> 02:53:51,950
by his real fans and a lot of people 
back in Iran.

2983
02:53:52,230 --> 02:53:57,230
I mean as the guy who invented human 
rights sort of at least as a ruler is 

2984
02:53:58,251 --> 02:54:03,251
concerned.
And Babylon is one of the number one 

2985
02:54:03,251 --> 02:54:03,251
pieces of evidence,
you know,

2986
02:54:03,251 --> 02:54:06,971
that gets trotted out in defense of this
idea that this isn't just some sort of 

2987
02:54:06,971 --> 02:54:11,381
policy of tolerance for expediency sake.
That this is how Cyrus really believes 

2988
02:54:13,640 --> 02:54:14,750
you can govern.

2989
02:54:16,210 --> 02:54:21,210
And it should be pointed out that that 
not only has babylon kind of surrender 

2990
02:54:21,210 --> 02:54:24,991
without a fight.
There's another Babylonian city or two 

2991
02:54:24,991 --> 02:54:26,770
that kind of opens their doors to Cyrus.
And it's interesting because,

2992
02:54:26,790 --> 02:54:31,790
you know,
resists Origami has an interesting take 

2993
02:54:31,790 --> 02:54:31,890
on something that the Babylonian King 
did as part of the,

2994
02:54:31,920 --> 02:54:36,920
the,
the fighting with Cyrus for Babylon 

2995
02:54:36,920 --> 02:54:39,990
supposedly,
and this is a way to look at nab 

2996
02:54:39,990 --> 02:54:39,990
tonight,
is showing that maybe he was this really

2997
02:54:39,990 --> 02:54:43,450
responsible king after all,
before Cyrus gets to Babylon nab night,

2998
02:54:43,460 --> 02:54:45,390
it goes around to all the surrounding 
towns and,

2999
02:54:45,391 --> 02:54:48,280
and takes their gods,
takes all their little,

3000
02:54:48,450 --> 02:54:52,510
the statues and the representations of 
their gods and takes them to Babylon.

3001
02:54:53,590 --> 02:54:56,360
And traditionally this is considered to 
be an act of safekeeping,

3002
02:54:56,470 --> 02:54:58,420
right?
You know that you don't want your statue

3003
02:54:58,421 --> 02:55:03,421
of Liberty falling into the hands of the
elamites and ending up in their trophy 

3004
02:55:03,421 --> 02:55:03,421
case,
right?

3005
02:55:03,421 --> 02:55:07,560
So you take all these village,
God's back to Babylon for safekeeping 

3006
02:55:07,560 --> 02:55:12,340
reasons are gone.
Me Though has an interesting take on 

3007
02:55:12,340 --> 02:55:12,470
this in his book,
discovering Cyrus,

3008
02:55:12,740 --> 02:55:15,470
he does a great job reminding us of the 
interesting,

3009
02:55:15,520 --> 02:55:20,520
uh,
belief systems of the people who have 

3010
02:55:20,520 --> 02:55:22,481
these gods.
And then how maybe you could see what 

3011
02:55:22,481 --> 02:55:25,511
nab and knight is doing is the 
equivalent of perhaps kidnapping the 

3012
02:55:25,511 --> 02:55:30,071
gods of these towns.
And holding them hostage for good 

3013
02:55:30,071 --> 02:55:30,071
behavior,
right?

3014
02:55:30,560 --> 02:55:33,860
Stay loyal to Babylon or your God gets 
it in the neck.

3015
02:55:33,950 --> 02:55:35,840
Something like that.
Here's what's our gummy rights,

3016
02:55:36,110 --> 02:55:41,110
and remember,
this only makes sense if nab tonight is 

3017
02:55:41,110 --> 02:55:42,890
a seriously worried that some of these 
towns are just going to go over to cyrus

3018
02:55:42,891 --> 02:55:45,740
because of the propaganda or whatever he
writes,

3019
02:55:45,741 --> 02:55:50,741
quote,
faced with the very real prospect that 

3020
02:55:50,741 --> 02:55:53,861
is,
cities would open up their gates to the 

3021
02:55:53,861 --> 02:55:53,861
conqueror.

3022
02:55:53,861 --> 02:55:54,470
Nab Tonight is settled upon a drastic 
policy.

3023
02:55:54,710 --> 02:55:59,710
He decided to hold hostage.
The sacred idols of Babylonia is 

3024
02:55:59,710 --> 02:56:01,790
outlying cities to ensure the loyalty of
their inhabitants.

3025
02:56:02,060 --> 02:56:06,080
So when Cyrus in his army resumed their 
march in the late summer of 5:39

3026
02:56:06,081 --> 02:56:11,081
bce,
a series of caravans laden with divine 

3027
02:56:11,081 --> 02:56:13,850
images and other religious artifacts 
made its way to Babylon.

3028
02:56:14,180 --> 02:56:19,180
Living today,
we can hardly grasp the full 

3029
02:56:19,180 --> 02:56:19,850
psychological impact of nab.
Unitus is action.

3030
02:56:20,120 --> 02:56:25,120
The idol was the centerpiece of the 
ancient Mesopotamian cult and the most 

3031
02:56:25,120 --> 02:56:29,051
important symbol of the community.
The inanimate statues were treated like 

3032
02:56:29,051 --> 02:56:29,840
royalty,
bathed,

3033
02:56:29,960 --> 02:56:31,580
perfumed,
groomed,

3034
02:56:31,670 --> 02:56:35,540
and even fed lavish meals by an 
entourage of domestic servants.

3035
02:56:35,570 --> 02:56:40,570
Priests and personal attendance,
Ancient Mesopotamian cults were 

3036
02:56:40,570 --> 02:56:44,180
geographically centralized and the God's
power's territorially limited.

3037
02:56:44,450 --> 02:56:48,620
That is why Cyrus could not receive the 
divine approval he desired with the gods

3038
02:56:48,621 --> 02:56:52,160
concentrated in Babylon.
He then continues,

3039
02:56:52,161 --> 02:56:57,161
but nab unitus was playing a dangerous 
game by emptying is cities have their 

3040
02:56:57,161 --> 02:56:57,161
idols.

3041
02:56:57,161 --> 02:57:01,810
Proximity to the cult statue meant 
everything to the superstitious masses 

3042
02:57:01,810 --> 02:57:04,220
who believed that the sacred images of 
their gods could perform miracles,

3043
02:57:04,400 --> 02:57:06,590
cure illness,
and most importantly,

3044
02:57:06,740 --> 02:57:11,740
protect their settlements.
Cities last divine protection when 

3045
02:57:11,740 --> 02:57:15,281
they're God's left and quote,
one of the first things that Cyrus will 

3046
02:57:16,281 --> 02:57:21,281
brag about doing when he takes over 
Babylon is returning all those gods to 

3047
02:57:23,511 --> 02:57:27,860
the outlying communities,
and those people freaking out at,

3048
02:57:28,030 --> 02:57:29,450
you know,
having their gods back.

3049
02:57:29,810 --> 02:57:30,950
Once again,
as Pierre,

3050
02:57:30,951 --> 02:57:35,951
Brianna says,
Cyrus's portraying himself as the 

3051
02:57:35,951 --> 02:57:36,770
restorer of order of things as they 
should be.

3052
02:57:37,610 --> 02:57:42,610
He's beginning to tie himself to the 
ancient Assyrian tradition.

3053
02:57:43,880 --> 02:57:48,880
Some historians suggest consciously,
he'll talk about repairing something in 

3054
02:57:48,880 --> 02:57:50,750
the city and coming across some 
proclamation by Asha,

3055
02:57:50,751 --> 02:57:52,430
Bonnie Paul,
the Assyrian King.

3056
02:57:52,431 --> 02:57:57,431
He'll tie himself to Assyria and this 
ancient in a royal tradition.

3057
02:57:57,890 --> 02:58:01,100
When he starts calling himself king of 
kings and King of the universe,

3058
02:58:01,440 --> 02:58:02,480
these are old,

3059
02:58:02,480 --> 02:58:07,480
a Syrian and even acadian terms,
but if cyrus was starting to use these 

3060
02:58:08,531 --> 02:58:13,531
ancient titles for himself,
you can see why he thought he might 

3061
02:58:13,531 --> 02:58:17,251
deserve it because 80 or 90 years after 
you know the ancient kingdom of Assyria 

3062
02:58:18,910 --> 02:58:23,910
fell,
Cyrus had put Humpty dumpty back 

3063
02:58:23,910 --> 02:58:27,361
together again with sort of a different 
form and different marketing and 

3064
02:58:29,381 --> 02:58:33,670
different branding,
but all of a sudden,

3065
02:58:33,671 --> 02:58:38,671
once again,
just as head existed during later a 

3066
02:58:38,671 --> 02:58:41,990
Syrian times,
one power had had Gemini in that part of

3067
02:58:42,191 --> 02:58:47,191
the world.
Now trying to rule immensely different 

3068
02:58:50,021 --> 02:58:55,021
people.
People from you know everything from 

3069
02:58:55,021 --> 02:58:55,540
from deeply urban environments and 
places like Babylon,

3070
02:58:56,290 --> 02:59:01,290
to Phoenecian cities.
Two tribes that existed off in the edges

3071
02:59:01,391 --> 02:59:06,391
of the Eurasian Steppe and incorporate 
all these different people into one 

3072
02:59:06,391 --> 02:59:06,880
empire.

3073
02:59:08,140 --> 02:59:13,140
Much is made of the different strategies
that the Persians used over the 

3074
02:59:13,140 --> 02:59:14,890
Assyrians.
Instead of trying to shoo everybody into

3075
02:59:14,891 --> 02:59:16,020
one,
you know,

3076
02:59:16,190 --> 02:59:19,450
cultural style,
convert everybody to your religion.

3077
02:59:20,650 --> 02:59:23,350
Make Good Assyrians,
have these conquered people.

3078
02:59:23,890 --> 02:59:28,890
The Persians used a much lighter touch 
that the idea of toleration really was 

3079
02:59:28,890 --> 02:59:32,971
to allow local customs to continue.
The Assyrians wouldn't have tolerated 

3080
02:59:33,491 --> 02:59:36,070
that the fact that the Persians didn't 
try to change all that,

3081
02:59:36,071 --> 02:59:39,370
whether it was a question of religion or
language or anything else.

3082
02:59:39,371 --> 02:59:44,371
In fact,
when the Persian empire gets up and 

3083
02:59:44,371 --> 02:59:46,531
running,
Persians will be put in all the most 

3084
02:59:46,531 --> 02:59:48,901
important positions,
but Persian will not be the language of 

3085
02:59:48,901 --> 02:59:53,511
the empire.
There will always be only a tiny 

3086
02:59:53,511 --> 02:59:53,511
minority of people actually speaking 
Persian.

3087
02:59:53,511 --> 02:59:56,280
All of the official proclamations will 
be multilingual,

3088
02:59:56,281 --> 02:59:57,810
so the different people can read them.

3089
02:59:59,190 --> 03:00:02,010
All the local gods are respected and 
supported.

3090
03:00:02,760 --> 03:00:03,330
Now,
again,

3091
03:00:03,331 --> 03:00:05,310
is this some sort of,
you know,

3092
03:00:05,311 --> 03:00:10,311
humanitarian gesture on Cyrus's part or 
is it a guy who is a humanitarian and 

3093
03:00:10,311 --> 03:00:10,830
thanks.
Listen,

3094
03:00:10,831 --> 03:00:13,650
I'm just telling you this is the best 
way to treat people and it will work out

3095
03:00:13,800 --> 03:00:14,520
best.
In other words,

3096
03:00:14,521 --> 03:00:19,521
a guy who believes his own humanitarian 
beliefs and morals dove tail into good 

3097
03:00:19,521 --> 03:00:23,691
outcomes,
or is it somebody who cynically looked 

3098
03:00:23,691 --> 03:00:23,691
at this and just says,
listen,

3099
03:00:23,691 --> 03:00:24,120
I'm just telling you,
if we do it this way,

3100
03:00:24,121 --> 03:00:29,121
we'll have less revolts.
It'll be much better than the way the 

3101
03:00:29,121 --> 03:00:29,121
Assyrians did it.
Who knows?

3102
03:00:29,790 --> 03:00:33,390
It's tempting to think of Cyrus as 
brilliant and visionary,

3103
03:00:33,720 --> 03:00:36,360
regardless of which one of those things 
is true.

3104
03:00:37,860 --> 03:00:42,860
He organizes this empire.
He starts creating things that are 

3105
03:00:42,860 --> 03:00:45,831
called satraps in sat trapeze,
which are administrative units that will

3106
03:00:45,961 --> 03:00:50,961
be built upon by his successors,
and then the next major thing we hear 

3107
03:00:51,091 --> 03:00:56,091
about Cyrus,
it's almost like you know when these 

3108
03:00:56,091 --> 03:00:57,861
people live that far back,
you get the highlights of their lives 

3109
03:00:57,861 --> 03:00:57,861
right?
Highlight number one,

3110
03:00:57,861 --> 03:01:00,310
you know conquest of Medea.
Highlight number to conquest

3111
03:01:00,310 --> 03:01:05,310
of Lydia.
How that number three conquest of 

3112
03:01:05,310 --> 03:01:06,961
Babylon highlight number for the 
expedition against a queen of one of the

3113
03:01:10,301 --> 03:01:14,530
most powerful tribal coalitions in 
Central Asia.

3114
03:01:16,510 --> 03:01:21,510
Now the fact that there is a clean 
involved in this story should tip you 

3115
03:01:21,510 --> 03:01:23,140
off to the idea that it's going to be a 
good one,

3116
03:01:23,800 --> 03:01:27,550
and Hurghada test by the way knows this.
He's eager to get to this story and he's

3117
03:01:27,551 --> 03:01:29,890
going to spend a ton of time on it.
He's been setting it up.

3118
03:01:30,550 --> 03:01:35,550
He knows his audience is ready.
He's got a little moral twists that may 

3119
03:01:35,550 --> 03:01:35,710
or may not have anything to do with 
reality,

3120
03:01:36,130 --> 03:01:41,130
but you get a look at that 2,500
year old mind that your mind melding 

3121
03:01:41,130 --> 03:01:44,310
with one way at this point in the story,
but it becomes the time where Heraclitus

3122
03:01:44,460 --> 03:01:47,950
is at his least reliable too.
I mean,

3123
03:01:48,070 --> 03:01:52,090
he jumps from highlight number three to 
highlight number four in Cyrus's life in

3124
03:01:52,091 --> 03:01:54,790
one second.
If you look at the actual dates involved

3125
03:01:54,791 --> 03:01:57,550
though,
you'll see that there is like nine years

3126
03:01:57,551 --> 03:02:02,551
between highlight number three and 
highlight number four and nine years 

3127
03:02:02,551 --> 03:02:05,521
when Cyrus is well to use his own 
marketing and branding king of the 

3128
03:02:05,521 --> 03:02:09,991
universe.
What the heck was this guy doing for 

3129
03:02:09,991 --> 03:02:12,331
nine years while he was putting out some
propaganda?

3130
03:02:12,351 --> 03:02:16,850
We know something called the Cyrus 
cylinder is a famous,

3131
03:02:17,180 --> 03:02:22,180
and it's this piece where first cyrus 
has the Babylonian gods saying I was 

3132
03:02:22,180 --> 03:02:26,111
with him the whole way,
and then he introduces himself as this 

3133
03:02:26,111 --> 03:02:26,111
good guy

3134
03:02:26,111 --> 03:02:28,230
again,
propaganda and makes it easier to rule a

3135
03:02:28,231 --> 03:02:29,100
subject.
People,

3136
03:02:29,250 --> 03:02:32,490
if you make it feel like it was your God
that wanted me here

3137
03:02:34,660 --> 03:02:36,460
I came because he took my hand.
Right,

3138
03:02:36,461 --> 03:02:41,461
so so you're legitimizing your rule and 
tying you into the to the age old power 

3139
03:02:41,461 --> 03:02:45,751
structure and basically saying that king
you defeated was the real weirdo that 

3140
03:02:45,751 --> 03:02:46,750
the god didn't want.
I am restoring,

3141
03:02:47,120 --> 03:02:52,120
you know,
the kingship to the people that mark 

3142
03:02:52,120 --> 03:02:54,211
wants to have it.
You can see that the same is true in a 

3143
03:02:54,211 --> 03:02:56,020
lot of the other religions that Cyrus is
involved with.

3144
03:02:56,021 --> 03:03:01,021
This is why a lot of people think his 
whole propaganda tolerance thing was 

3145
03:03:01,021 --> 03:03:03,841
much more of a political move because 
look at how it helps him politically in 

3146
03:03:04,091 --> 03:03:09,091
a way that by the way,
he could not have foreseen it made them 

3147
03:03:09,091 --> 03:03:09,091
immortal.

3148
03:03:10,340 --> 03:03:14,210
This is from peer Brown's book from 
Cyrus to Alexander,

3149
03:03:14,480 --> 03:03:19,480
but at the translation from the Bible 
that he uses in the same way that the 

3150
03:03:19,480 --> 03:03:20,360
cyrus cylinder says,
the Babylonian God,

3151
03:03:20,361 --> 03:03:23,630
Marduk took Cyrus's hand and swept away 
all the opposition.

3152
03:03:24,260 --> 03:03:26,750
This is what the Israeli God,
Yahweh did,

3153
03:03:26,751 --> 03:03:31,751
according to the Bible quote that says 
y'all way to his appointed to Cyrus,

3154
03:03:32,420 --> 03:03:37,420
whom he has taken by his right hand to 
subdue nations before him and stripped 

3155
03:03:37,420 --> 03:03:41,690
the loins of kings to force gateways 
before him that their gates be closed no

3156
03:03:41,691 --> 03:03:46,691
more.
I will go before you leveling the 

3157
03:03:46,691 --> 03:03:47,060
heights.
I will shatter the bronze gateways,

3158
03:03:47,180 --> 03:03:50,870
smash the iron bars.
I will give you the hidden treasures,

3159
03:03:50,960 --> 03:03:54,030
the secret hordes that you may know that
I am your way.

3160
03:03:55,110 --> 03:03:59,210
And so once again,
cyrus has these gods on his side.

3161
03:03:59,360 --> 03:04:00,410
Why are they on this side?
Well,

3162
03:04:00,411 --> 03:04:02,240
he's always helping,
isn't he?

3163
03:04:02,480 --> 03:04:05,600
He's always doing what the priesthood of
Marta would like.

3164
03:04:05,601 --> 03:04:10,601
In general.
It's interesting how Martin follows 

3165
03:04:10,601 --> 03:04:10,820
along.
He likes if you treat as priests well in

3166
03:04:10,821 --> 03:04:13,220
the case of y'all way.
Well,

3167
03:04:13,221 --> 03:04:15,100
according to the Bible again and Pierre 
Briana,

3168
03:04:15,120 --> 03:04:17,340
skeptical of the details but says in,
in,

3169
03:04:17,341 --> 03:04:18,830
in the bigger picture,
at least,

3170
03:04:18,831 --> 03:04:20,540
it was consistent with what actually 
happened.

3171
03:04:20,930 --> 03:04:24,560
The Bible says that in the reign of a 
king to kings,

3172
03:04:24,590 --> 03:04:29,590
after two official kings after Cyrus,
they found the actual order that would 

3173
03:04:29,590 --> 03:04:31,850
have made y'all way pleased with 
investing,

3174
03:04:31,851 --> 03:04:36,610
shall we say in the Cyrus conquests,
according to the Bible and Pierre brands

3175
03:04:36,620 --> 03:04:38,930
description of it.
This is from Ezra,

3176
03:04:38,931 --> 03:04:42,400
by the way,
out of the royal archives,

3177
03:04:42,410 --> 03:04:43,470
a baton.
Ah,

3178
03:04:43,970 --> 03:04:45,080
the order said,
quote,

3179
03:04:46,070 --> 03:04:48,260
in the first year of Cyrus,
the king,

3180
03:04:48,590 --> 03:04:52,250
King Cyrus decreed temple of God in 
Jerusalem,

3181
03:04:52,640 --> 03:04:57,640
the temple will be rebuilt as a place at
which sacrifices are offered and by 

3182
03:04:57,640 --> 03:04:58,560
which offerings are brought to be burnt.

3183
03:04:58,860 --> 03:05:01,550
It's height as to be 60 cubits.
It's width,

3184
03:05:01,610 --> 03:05:04,310
60 cubits.
They're going to be three thicknesses of

3185
03:05:04,311 --> 03:05:09,311
stone blocks and one of would the 
expenses to be met by the king's 

3186
03:05:09,311 --> 03:05:10,190
household.
Furthermore,

3187
03:05:10,370 --> 03:05:13,460
the vessels of gold and silver from the 
temple of God,

3188
03:05:13,640 --> 03:05:18,640
which Nebuchadnezzar took from the 
sanctuary in Jerusalem and brought to 

3189
03:05:18,640 --> 03:05:22,301
Babylon,
are to be restored so that everything 

3190
03:05:22,301 --> 03:05:25,181
may be restored to the sanctuary in 
Jerusalem and put back in the temple of 

3191
03:05:25,181 --> 03:05:29,111
God and quote that dovetails nicely with
that story of the ghostly hand,

3192
03:05:30,471 --> 03:05:35,471
doesn't it?
Because what that Guy Belshazzar was 

3193
03:05:35,471 --> 03:05:38,561
drinking out of that made you know you 
always so mad to begin with are all 

3194
03:05:38,561 --> 03:05:39,950
these sacred vessels from the old temple
in Jerusalem,

3195
03:05:39,951 --> 03:05:43,820
Solomon's Temple.
Now Cyrus was decreeing that you rebuild

3196
03:05:44,060 --> 03:05:49,060
Solomon's Temple and you pay for it out 
of the king's treasury and you bring 

3197
03:05:49,371 --> 03:05:54,371
back all these things that are still 
around and restock the temple with them,

3198
03:05:54,830 --> 03:05:57,830
and then you send the people who have 
been deported here,

3199
03:05:57,831 --> 03:05:58,910
back home.

3200
03:06:00,410 --> 03:06:05,410
Now here's the thing,
this reconstituted area that will become

3201
03:06:05,931 --> 03:06:08,900
a sad trap by the way,
does not have its political freedom.

3202
03:06:09,050 --> 03:06:10,760
They're not going to be the way they 
were.

3203
03:06:11,060 --> 03:06:14,000
You know when the Babylonians and 
Egyptians were arguing over them,

3204
03:06:14,630 --> 03:06:17,390
but you got to see that they're pretty 
darn far ahead.

3205
03:06:17,391 --> 03:06:21,800
They went from a people that might have 
died out religiously.

3206
03:06:22,430 --> 03:06:23,360
In fact,
the book I had,

3207
03:06:23,361 --> 03:06:28,361
the places Cyrus has one of the top,
most 100 influential people of all time 

3208
03:06:28,361 --> 03:06:32,301
says that that's one of the things.
Maybe you credit him with the fact that 

3209
03:06:32,301 --> 03:06:35,351
if he doesn't do this,
there's a chance Judaism doesn't 

3210
03:06:35,351 --> 03:06:37,340
continue over the long haul.
In this case,

3211
03:06:37,341 --> 03:06:39,620
he builds what's known as the second 
temple,

3212
03:06:39,860 --> 03:06:44,860
and if you want to see continuity,
the wall that is still one of the 

3213
03:06:44,860 --> 03:06:45,560
holiest,
if not the holiest sites,

3214
03:06:45,561 --> 03:06:47,090
I guess the Temple Mount will be holy or
but,

3215
03:06:47,091 --> 03:06:51,170
but it's part of the temple.
Mount is the famous Western Wall.

3216
03:06:51,320 --> 03:06:55,980
The Western Wall is a Roman era addition
to the

3217
03:06:55,980 --> 03:07:00,980
second temple,
which cyrus allegedly according to the 

3218
03:07:00,980 --> 03:07:03,120
Bible,
paid for and authorized.

3219
03:07:03,960 --> 03:07:05,220
It's so interesting,
isn't it?

3220
03:07:05,221 --> 03:07:08,950
To consider how connected the stories of
the ancient Iranians,

3221
03:07:08,970 --> 03:07:12,360
the ancient Persians are to the ancient 
Jewish folks,

3222
03:07:12,600 --> 03:07:15,960
especially considering the current 
antagonism between them.

3223
03:07:16,470 --> 03:07:17,970
You know,
as late as the 19 seventies,

3224
03:07:17,971 --> 03:07:22,971
the shah of Iran was,
was touting this ancient closeness 

3225
03:07:22,971 --> 03:07:23,460
between the peoples and their 
relationship.

3226
03:07:24,780 --> 03:07:26,940
If not for the ancient Persians and 
Iranians,

3227
03:07:26,950 --> 03:07:31,950
there's a chance there wouldn't be 
Judaism today and depending on when it 

3228
03:07:31,950 --> 03:07:36,261
died out,
there's a very good chance you wouldn't 

3229
03:07:36,261 --> 03:07:37,140
have had the religions that sprouted off
that branch.

3230
03:07:37,141 --> 03:07:39,390
You wouldn't have had Christianity,
you probably wouldn't have had Islam.

3231
03:07:39,391 --> 03:07:44,391
In other words,
is Cyrus the great actually did do this 

3232
03:07:44,391 --> 03:07:47,070
and he had never lived to do it.
What would the world look like today?

3233
03:07:47,850 --> 03:07:52,850
Another thing it says in that 100 most 
influential people of all time that I 

3234
03:07:52,850 --> 03:07:56,061
thought was interesting is that many of 
the people that get credited as being 

3235
03:07:56,061 --> 03:07:59,181
very important and dynamic and 
instrumental human beings in terms of 

3236
03:07:59,401 --> 03:08:04,401
their effect on history,
did something that would have been done 

3237
03:08:04,401 --> 03:08:05,580
anyway might not have been done at that 
time or that way,

3238
03:08:05,850 --> 03:08:07,140
but a lot of this stuff would have 
happened.

3239
03:08:07,140 --> 03:08:12,140
Someone else would have discovered the 
light bulb probably the author thought 

3240
03:08:12,140 --> 03:08:13,800
it likely that if cyrus the great had 
never lived,

3241
03:08:14,370 --> 03:08:19,370
none of this stuff happens.
He was a unique individual and even 

3242
03:08:19,370 --> 03:08:24,361
though you can't get your mind around 
the specifics of how he was a unique 

3243
03:08:24,361 --> 03:08:26,931
individual,
you can sort of look at what built up 

3244
03:08:26,931 --> 03:08:26,931
even if he ever wants.
Right,

3245
03:08:26,931 --> 03:08:31,041
and you have to assume that there was a 
lot of foundation bubbling up up under 

3246
03:08:31,041 --> 03:08:34,161
the surface for Cyrus to work with.
This is still a pretty incredible human 

3247
03:08:34,161 --> 03:08:37,881
being.
I think you could probably say with a 

3248
03:08:37,881 --> 03:08:42,081
decent chance of being right that he is 
in the five thirty's bce,

3249
03:08:42,901 --> 03:08:46,440
the greatest geo political figure who's 
ever lived,

3250
03:08:48,330 --> 03:08:52,400
which makes the next thing I'm going to 
say no.

3251
03:08:52,410 --> 03:08:53,980
So hard to believe.
You know?

3252
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:59,000
Why should I say it?
How about letting historian 80 olmsted 

3253
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:00,180
in a book published in Nineteen Forty 
Eight?

3254
03:09:00,960 --> 03:09:05,960
Say it again.
Is there any more of a telling example 

3255
03:09:06,271 --> 03:09:08,900
that these people live at the very tail 
end,

3256
03:09:08,920 --> 03:09:13,920
the black and white era of recording of 
human history because how can this guy 

3257
03:09:13,920 --> 03:09:16,170
be as big as he is and yet this next 
line be true?

3258
03:09:16,260 --> 03:09:19,530
Olmsted said,
quote here,

3259
03:09:19,531 --> 03:09:22,950
we must leave Cyrus for suddenly and 
without warning.

3260
03:09:23,160 --> 03:09:28,160
Our information comes to an end and to 
quote 200 years after this period,

3261
03:09:30,540 --> 03:09:35,540
we will know Alexander the Great's 
symptoms to such a degree that doctors 

3262
03:09:35,540 --> 03:09:38,850
today try to diagnose what he may have 
died of and they still don't know.

3263
03:09:38,851 --> 03:09:43,851
I'm not saying everything's perfect,
but you know where when the how's the 

3264
03:09:43,851 --> 03:09:46,830
why's,
how can you not know how this guy dies?

3265
03:09:48,300 --> 03:09:53,300
Highlight number four in his life as 
portrayed by Heraclitus is Hurghada 

3266
03:09:53,300 --> 03:09:54,040
tells a story of how

3267
03:09:54,040 --> 03:09:59,040
he dies and I love the fact that 
Hurghada does goes to the trouble to 

3268
03:09:59,040 --> 03:10:00,640
point out that he's heard several 
different versions of this story,

3269
03:10:00,641 --> 03:10:05,641
but the one he's going to give you is 
the one he thinks is most likely and 

3270
03:10:05,641 --> 03:10:10,021
maybe it's just a coincidence that the 
story that Hurghada thinks is most 

3271
03:10:10,021 --> 03:10:14,641
likely is the one with the most exotic 
interesting movie like elements to it.

3272
03:10:16,361 --> 03:10:19,390
You can imagine.
I can't imagine he left a better version

3273
03:10:19,391 --> 03:10:20,830
on the table somewhere saying,
nope.

3274
03:10:20,890 --> 03:10:25,890
You know,
I just don't believe that because the 

3275
03:10:25,890 --> 03:10:25,890
one he used is so awesome.
Now,

3276
03:10:25,890 --> 03:10:27,640
is it believable?
That's the problem here.

3277
03:10:27,641 --> 03:10:31,090
Nobody knows what's believable off the 
top of my head,

3278
03:10:31,091 --> 03:10:35,360
if you asked me what percentage bought 
into the general idea of Hirata story,

3279
03:10:35,430 --> 03:10:40,430
I'd say it's like 80 percent.
Most of them don't believe any of the 

3280
03:10:40,430 --> 03:10:41,980
details,
but the broad idea that in 5:30

3281
03:10:41,981 --> 03:10:46,981
bce,
cyrus the great died somewhere out in 

3282
03:10:46,981 --> 03:10:48,280
this step area as Hurghada to said 
details,

3283
03:10:48,281 --> 03:10:52,360
probably unknown about 20 percent I'd 
say,

3284
03:10:52,361 --> 03:10:57,361
of the historians,
don't think he died a completely 

3285
03:10:57,361 --> 03:10:57,361
different way.

3286
03:10:57,361 --> 03:10:58,540
Something against different tribes than 
Hirata says in different areas.

3287
03:10:58,720 --> 03:11:00,250
Others that he didn't die that way at 
all.

3288
03:11:00,270 --> 03:11:02,320
Xenophon renting a couple centuries 
afterwards,

3289
03:11:02,321 --> 03:11:07,321
we'll say died in bed peacefully.
So there are some historians who buy 

3290
03:11:07,321 --> 03:11:07,420
that too.
In Iran,

3291
03:11:07,421 --> 03:11:12,421
it's a generally,
I think a higher percentage of 

3292
03:11:12,421 --> 03:11:12,421
historians that think he didn't die the 
way Heraclitus says,

3293
03:11:12,650 --> 03:11:15,280
and in part you,
you can understand why you'd be a little

3294
03:11:15,281 --> 03:11:20,281
skeptical.
It's just too darn interesting the way 

3295
03:11:20,281 --> 03:11:20,281
he does it.
You can see,

3296
03:11:20,550 --> 03:11:25,550
you know,
the admonition that I got when I was 

3297
03:11:25,550 --> 03:11:25,550
starting in journalism,
the one that said,

3298
03:11:25,550 --> 03:11:29,300
you know,
tell what really happened in the most 

3299
03:11:29,300 --> 03:11:31,630
interesting way possible.
What happens to an admonition like that?

3300
03:11:31,990 --> 03:11:35,200
If there's no way you could possibly 
know what really happened,

3301
03:11:35,800 --> 03:11:38,680
but you have to tell it anyway.
What are your standards?

3302
03:11:38,681 --> 03:11:43,681
Then?
You're pretty much left with the most 

3303
03:11:43,681 --> 03:11:43,681
interesting way you can at that point,
right?

3304
03:11:44,650 --> 03:11:48,130
The story is herodotus tells,
it involves this little twist.

3305
03:11:48,131 --> 03:11:53,131
You're going to end up leaving his 
theatrical presentation with a deeper 

3306
03:11:53,131 --> 03:11:53,320
message.
Again,

3307
03:11:53,321 --> 03:11:58,321
the deeper message may or may not be 
true Hurghada this couches this story 

3308
03:11:58,321 --> 03:12:02,041
now into the ID of overreach.
Maybe the idea of absolute power 

3309
03:12:02,041 --> 03:12:04,930
corrupts absolutely,
and before we write this off,

3310
03:12:05,110 --> 03:12:08,530
as many historians do right away because
it's just such an obvious moral message.

3311
03:12:08,650 --> 03:12:11,200
Remember,
you could make that case about Hitler.

3312
03:12:11,810 --> 03:12:16,810
You know,
with the absolute power turning you mad 

3313
03:12:16,810 --> 03:12:17,020
after awhile with Alexander,
you can make that case.

3314
03:12:17,021 --> 03:12:22,021
I mean,
I guess there are historical figures 

3315
03:12:22,021 --> 03:12:24,540
where this is both a motif because it's 
this recurring theme you see all the 

3316
03:12:24,540 --> 03:12:24,970
time,
but it also happens to be true.

3317
03:12:25,750 --> 03:12:29,650
Maybe after years of being king of the 
universe,

3318
03:12:30,040 --> 03:12:32,140
Cyrus got a little full of himself.
Who knows,

3319
03:12:32,141 --> 03:12:33,610
but that's the way this is portrayed,
right?

3320
03:12:33,611 --> 03:12:38,611
There's going to be an object lesson 
here and the person that is going to 

3321
03:12:38,611 --> 03:12:40,690
stick it to cyrus and teach him this 
lesson is going to be a queen,

3322
03:12:41,570 --> 03:12:46,570
you know,
but you have to think of like an 

3323
03:12:46,570 --> 03:12:47,851
Amazonian Queen.
This isn't some woman who's walking 

3324
03:12:47,851 --> 03:12:47,851
around in velvet,
you know,

3325
03:12:47,851 --> 03:12:52,141
on a throne being fan.
I mean this is a person who probably 

3326
03:12:52,141 --> 03:12:52,190
once upon a time was killing

3327
03:12:52,190 --> 03:12:56,270
men in hand to hand combat.
Now,

3328
03:12:56,271 --> 03:12:59,780
did this woman really exist?
Who the heck knows?

3329
03:12:59,781 --> 03:13:02,750
There is no historical confirmation that
I've ever seen that says that they found

3330
03:13:02,751 --> 03:13:05,240
anything that proves this queen who's 
name,

3331
03:13:05,241 --> 03:13:10,241
by the way,
I used to call her tomorrow when I was 

3332
03:13:10,241 --> 03:13:10,241
growing up,
but I've seen timorous,

3333
03:13:10,241 --> 03:13:11,600
Tom Morris,
number of different pronunciations.

3334
03:13:12,020 --> 03:13:13,990
I think Shakespeare might've used her as
a character,

3335
03:13:14,010 --> 03:13:16,730
one of his plays.
Nonetheless,

3336
03:13:16,731 --> 03:13:18,410
you can say a couple of things.
One,

3337
03:13:18,800 --> 03:13:22,460
it wouldn't have been outrageous to 
think of her as a female warrior because

3338
03:13:22,461 --> 03:13:27,461
these tribes actually had them.
It may have been the actual root of the 

3339
03:13:28,440 --> 03:13:33,440
idea of Amazon's in sort of a mythology,
so she could have actually been a killer

3340
03:13:35,911 --> 03:13:40,911
warrior and also the tribe she was 
supposed to have lead was real all too 

3341
03:13:42,481 --> 03:13:47,481
real to some people.
They were called the master guitar or 

3342
03:13:47,481 --> 03:13:49,040
the message tie.
A dangerous,

3343
03:13:49,041 --> 03:13:53,270
powerful,
numerous tribal coalition that,

3344
03:13:54,010 --> 03:13:55,790
you know,
Hurghada is in his writings.

3345
03:13:55,791 --> 03:13:57,710
He has to set it up and tell you what he
knows,

3346
03:13:57,711 --> 03:13:58,440
which isn't much.
He,

3347
03:13:58,490 --> 03:14:00,710
he says,
I hear there a skiffy in people,

3348
03:14:00,711 --> 03:14:01,730
which they kind of were.

3349
03:14:03,480 --> 03:14:06,960
You'd have to think of Mongolia type 
culture,

3350
03:14:07,410 --> 03:14:12,410
but with people who were probably 
predominantly light skinned and ranging 

3351
03:14:13,891 --> 03:14:18,891
on the scale of looks from like a Turkic
kind of look all the way up to people 

3352
03:14:18,891 --> 03:14:23,010
with blonde and red hair,
blue and green eyes tall.

3353
03:14:23,580 --> 03:14:28,580
There's a little viking side to them,
a little bit of the Viking Ethos and 

3354
03:14:28,580 --> 03:14:29,550
building little sword worshiping and 
things like that.

3355
03:14:29,551 --> 03:14:33,480
Supposedly once a year these people 
would have a scaffold erected and they'd

3356
03:14:33,481 --> 03:14:36,100
put a sword on top of the scaffolding.
Then they would march in,

3357
03:14:36,150 --> 03:14:39,180
meet the scaffold.
One out of every 100 prisoners that they

3358
03:14:39,181 --> 03:14:43,620
captured over the year and execute them 
as a sacrifice to the sky.

3359
03:14:43,621 --> 03:14:44,400
God,
the son,

3360
03:14:44,401 --> 03:14:45,990
God Mithras,
I think it was.

3361
03:14:47,310 --> 03:14:49,620
These are colorful,
scary people.

3362
03:14:49,621 --> 03:14:51,890
Just what you want in a story like this.
Iran,

3363
03:14:51,990 --> 03:14:54,580
this has already talked about their head
hunting.

3364
03:14:54,960 --> 03:14:56,760
The fact that they make,
you know,

3365
03:14:56,761 --> 03:15:01,761
drinking cups out of skulls and the 
really nasty warriors are the ones with 

3366
03:15:01,761 --> 03:15:01,761
the most cops.

3367
03:15:02,580 --> 03:15:05,010
He talks about their cannabis use.
Again,

3368
03:15:05,040 --> 03:15:07,470
this was the exotic barbarian.
You want to hear what they do.

3369
03:15:07,740 --> 03:15:12,740
He says they found this fruit that they 
can burn and then they sit around the 

3370
03:15:12,740 --> 03:15:16,161
fire,
burning the fruit and it gets them 

3371
03:15:16,161 --> 03:15:16,161
intoxicated like wine gets Greeks 
intoxicated.

3372
03:15:16,161 --> 03:15:18,660
So another little bit of that barbarian 
colored to throw in.

3373
03:15:19,290 --> 03:15:23,160
He also points out according to him that
they are very promiscuous.

3374
03:15:23,161 --> 03:15:28,161
You might call them free love types or 
swinger is maybe anybody can sleep with 

3375
03:15:28,161 --> 03:15:30,330
anybody else's wife.
He just has to put his bow,

3376
03:15:30,600 --> 03:15:35,600
you know,
alongside their tend to let them know 

3377
03:15:35,600 --> 03:15:36,510
you're interested I guess.
So weed,

3378
03:15:36,511 --> 03:15:39,600
smoking,
headhunting blood drinking,

3379
03:15:39,601 --> 03:15:41,100
wife sharing,
Viking types.

3380
03:15:41,101 --> 03:15:46,101
Who would not want that in a good story 
if you don't know anything and you're 

3381
03:15:46,101 --> 03:15:49,911
just trying to make the best story,
make sure you include these people are 

3382
03:15:49,911 --> 03:15:50,190
test that Cyrus leads

3383
03:15:50,190 --> 03:15:55,190
and army up to this queens territory and
then basically proposes marriage to her 

3384
03:15:56,070 --> 03:15:58,350
so it would be like a diplomatic 
alliance thing.

3385
03:15:58,351 --> 03:16:03,351
And in Hurghada this says that she sees 
through this reus immediately saying 

3386
03:16:03,351 --> 03:16:05,430
that he just wants to conquer her people
by marrying her.

3387
03:16:06,630 --> 03:16:11,190
So then when she says no,
he begins to try to set up what we would

3388
03:16:11,191 --> 03:16:16,191
call today an amphibious river crossing.
There's a big river that divides the 

3389
03:16:16,191 --> 03:16:16,350
territory.
He's coming from,

3390
03:16:16,710 --> 03:16:21,710
from the territory of these Central 
Asian horse nomads up in places like 

3391
03:16:21,720 --> 03:16:26,720
Kazakhstan and places like that today.
And as Cyrus and the Persians were told,

3392
03:16:27,241 --> 03:16:30,270
are building these boats,
some of which have like towers,

3393
03:16:30,271 --> 03:16:33,480
like fighting towers on them.
She sends him a message.

3394
03:16:33,481 --> 03:16:38,481
Now remember,
she's going to be like the voice of 

3395
03:16:38,481 --> 03:16:40,740
Avenging Karma here in teaching cyrus a 
lesson.

3396
03:16:40,920 --> 03:16:42,910
So her voice and the words that are 
brought,

3397
03:16:42,911 --> 03:16:44,410
it just puts in her mouth from a screen.

3398
03:16:44,410 --> 03:16:49,410
Writers show runners point of view are 
designed to set this idea up right?

3399
03:16:50,070 --> 03:16:51,720
You should know,
but you don't.

3400
03:16:51,721 --> 03:16:53,160
You know you're going to get what's 
coming to you.

3401
03:16:53,161 --> 03:16:58,161
Here's what Hirata to says.
This is the discipline core translation 

3402
03:16:58,161 --> 03:16:58,161
of her audit.
This,

3403
03:16:58,161 --> 03:17:00,510
by the way,
quote King of the Medes,

3404
03:17:00,720 --> 03:17:05,720
I advise you to abandon this enterprise 
for you cannot know if in the end it 

3405
03:17:05,720 --> 03:17:10,251
will do you any good rule your own 
people and try to bear the sight of me 

3406
03:17:10,251 --> 03:17:14,841
ruling mine,
but of course you will refuse my advice 

3407
03:17:14,841 --> 03:17:15,120
as the last thing you wish for us to 
live in.

3408
03:17:15,121 --> 03:17:16,740
Peace listened.
Then.

3409
03:17:17,010 --> 03:17:20,670
If you are so bent upon trying your 
strength against the massacre tie,

3410
03:17:20,970 --> 03:17:25,970
give up the laborious task of building 
that bridge and let my army withdraw 

3411
03:17:25,970 --> 03:17:27,060
three days,
March from the river,

3412
03:17:27,180 --> 03:17:29,940
and then you come over yourself or if 
you prefer it,

3413
03:17:30,210 --> 03:17:35,210
retire the same distance yourselves and 
let us meet you on your side of the 

3414
03:17:35,210 --> 03:17:39,081
river and quote,
this barbarian Warrior Queen is 

3415
03:17:41,971 --> 03:17:46,971
basically saying to a guy whose title 
includes king of kings and King of the 

3416
03:17:46,971 --> 03:17:51,921
universe to come and get it,
or I'll come over and take it from you.

3417
03:17:54,090 --> 03:17:56,970
That's a pretty strong female character,
isn't it?

3418
03:17:57,300 --> 03:18:02,300
And I was thinking that it makes 
Hurghada to at times look a little pro 

3419
03:18:02,300 --> 03:18:02,300
feminist,
right?

3420
03:18:02,300 --> 03:18:02,880
Like he like he's been looking for a 
good,

3421
03:18:02,881 --> 03:18:07,881
strong female character.
There's another reason maybe that would 

3422
03:18:07,881 --> 03:18:09,870
play well,
maybe some of the people in his audience

3423
03:18:09,871 --> 03:18:14,871
are women and it would be good to have a
character that they can both relate to 

3424
03:18:14,871 --> 03:18:15,720
in cheer for.
Finally,

3425
03:18:15,721 --> 03:18:19,710
it might just be a dig at the manliness 
of the Persians,

3426
03:18:19,711 --> 03:18:20,400
right?
I mean,

3427
03:18:20,790 --> 03:18:25,790
here's the greatest king that Asia has 
ever produced and he's about to be 

3428
03:18:25,790 --> 03:18:29,871
beaten and killed by a woman.
Nonetheless in the story when she says,

3429
03:18:30,431 --> 03:18:31,620
you know,
do you want it over here?

3430
03:18:31,621 --> 03:18:35,220
Do you want it over there?
Cyrus in his generals and whatnot,

3431
03:18:35,221 --> 03:18:36,690
sit down and have a conference about 
this.

3432
03:18:36,691 --> 03:18:38,280
What do we do?
Which choice do we take in?

3433
03:18:38,281 --> 03:18:40,710
All his advisors say,
let her come to our side of the river.

3434
03:18:41,010 --> 03:18:42,420
One advisor though,
says,

3435
03:18:42,421 --> 03:18:42,710
no,
no,

3436
03:18:42,711 --> 03:18:44,040
no.
Go over to her side.

3437
03:18:44,400 --> 03:18:48,010
That advisor is our old friend,
the king of Lydia

3438
03:18:48,010 --> 03:18:50,980
creases,
who instead of being killed Hurghada.

3439
03:18:50,981 --> 03:18:51,850
This has,
you know,

3440
03:18:51,851 --> 03:18:56,851
going in the story,
sort of acting as advisor to Cyrus all 

3441
03:18:56,851 --> 03:18:56,851
the way through

3442
03:18:57,140 --> 03:18:59,270
increases.
His advice is totally different.

3443
03:19:00,020 --> 03:19:00,680
First of all,
he says,

3444
03:19:00,681 --> 03:19:03,590
you can't let her come over here and 
give grounded in front of her.

3445
03:19:03,591 --> 03:19:05,090
It's a woman.
It would look terrible.

3446
03:19:05,091 --> 03:19:08,060
So there's that other little dig.
He says,

3447
03:19:08,061 --> 03:19:11,240
go over to her side.
And then he says,

3448
03:19:11,630 --> 03:19:16,630
and how about we do a little trick and 
he proceeds to tell Cyrus that they 

3449
03:19:19,011 --> 03:19:24,011
should essentially do the same thing to 
these people that the medes did to 

3450
03:19:24,440 --> 03:19:29,440
either these people are their cousins a 
generation before in a story you may 

3451
03:19:29,440 --> 03:19:32,060
recall,
get them all drunk and kill them.

3452
03:19:33,320 --> 03:19:36,560
My discipline core translation has 
creases,

3453
03:19:36,590 --> 03:19:41,590
telling Cyrus to do it this way.
Quote here then is my advice crossed the

3454
03:19:42,501 --> 03:19:47,501
river advanced to the limit of the 
enemy's withdrawal and then get the 

3455
03:19:47,501 --> 03:19:48,200
better of them.
Buy a piece of strategy.

3456
03:19:48,530 --> 03:19:53,530
I have heard that these people have no 
experience of such luxuries as the 

3457
03:19:53,530 --> 03:19:55,700
Persians and joy and know nothing about 
the pleasures of life.

3458
03:19:56,060 --> 03:20:01,060
Let us take advantage of this fact and 
set out a banquet in our camp on the 

3459
03:20:01,060 --> 03:20:05,831
most generous scale with a great many 
sheep slaughtered and dressed all sorts 

3460
03:20:05,831 --> 03:20:10,130
of other dishes and bowls of strong wine
in liberal quantities.

3461
03:20:10,550 --> 03:20:13,250
Then when the banquet is all prepared,
he says,

3462
03:20:13,580 --> 03:20:18,580
let us March back to the river,
leaving only a detachment of inferior 

3463
03:20:18,580 --> 03:20:22,751
troops behind.
Unless I'm very much mistaken when our 

3464
03:20:22,751 --> 03:20:26,171
enemies.
See all those good things they will set 

3465
03:20:26,171 --> 03:20:28,901
to work upon them and that will be our 
chance to distinguish ourselves by a 

3466
03:20:28,901 --> 03:20:32,621
bold stroke and quote again,
is that a recurring motif or is that 

3467
03:20:33,441 --> 03:20:36,290
just a tactic that seems to work quite a
bit?

3468
03:20:36,291 --> 03:20:41,291
Who knows,
but in the story we're told that the a 

3469
03:20:41,291 --> 03:20:45,170
third of the army shows up,
kills the inferior troops,

3470
03:20:45,290 --> 03:20:47,840
sees all the food and the wine proceeds 
to get,

3471
03:20:48,400 --> 03:20:50,030
you know,
very full and very drunk,

3472
03:20:50,031 --> 03:20:53,300
and then the Persians come in and kill a
bunch of them and capture some others.

3473
03:20:53,301 --> 03:20:58,301
About a third of the army according to 
Hurghada tests included amongst the 

3474
03:20:58,301 --> 03:21:03,131
prisoners a general who also happens to 
be this barbarian queens son.

3475
03:21:06,020 --> 03:21:09,260
So now in this scenario,
Hurghada is playing with his movies,

3476
03:21:09,261 --> 03:21:14,261
turned into a little bit of a thriller 
with little chest match and all of a 

3477
03:21:14,261 --> 03:21:15,140
sudden the cyrus's side is captured a 
major piece,

3478
03:21:15,680 --> 03:21:19,670
the son of the Queen.
And so she issues one of these.

3479
03:21:20,390 --> 03:21:25,390
I'll let you go now if you give me back 
my son kinds of speeches from the 

3480
03:21:25,941 --> 03:21:28,340
pervious translation.
I brought it to says,

3481
03:21:28,341 --> 03:21:33,341
quote,
when to my wrist learned what had 

3482
03:21:33,341 --> 03:21:35,621
happened to her army and her son.
She sent a herald to Cyrus with this 

3483
03:21:35,621 --> 03:21:37,040
message,
blood thirsty cyrus.

3484
03:21:37,190 --> 03:21:39,440
Do not gloat over what has happened 
here.

3485
03:21:39,590 --> 03:21:44,590
You Persians.
Indulge yourself with the fruit of the 

3486
03:21:44,590 --> 03:21:46,550
vine to the point of madness so that the
wine into your bodies,

3487
03:21:46,730 --> 03:21:51,730
ugly words flow up and out of you.
By such means you have tricked me and 

3488
03:21:51,730 --> 03:21:52,640
you've taken my son,
prisoner,

3489
03:21:52,820 --> 03:21:57,820
but not by supremacy and battle.
Well then I urge you to follow this 

3490
03:21:57,820 --> 03:21:59,450
advice.
Return my son to me.

3491
03:21:59,600 --> 03:22:04,600
And despite the damage you have,
cunningly wreaked upon a third part of 

3492
03:22:04,600 --> 03:22:07,901
the army of the massacre tie.
You may leave this land unharmed if you 

3493
03:22:07,901 --> 03:22:09,530
do not do this.
I swear by the sun,

3494
03:22:09,531 --> 03:22:14,531
the Lord of the massacre.
Tie that I will satisfy your thirst for 

3495
03:22:14,531 --> 03:22:14,531
blood in.

3496
03:22:14,531 --> 03:22:19,220
Well as you are in quote.
So what Cyrus going to do with this 

3497
03:22:19,621 --> 03:22:22,500
interesting,
powerful chest piece.

3498
03:22:23,850 --> 03:22:28,850
He doesn't get the chance to decide 
because we're told that as soon as the 

3499
03:22:28,850 --> 03:22:31,430
queen's son sobers up finds himself,
you know,

3500
03:22:31,470 --> 03:22:36,150
hands tied or bound.
He beseeches cyrus to undo his hands.

3501
03:22:36,810 --> 03:22:41,810
Somehow Cyrus is convinced,
and I like the way my relevance and 

3502
03:22:41,810 --> 03:22:43,680
translation puts it.
The minute his hands were free,

3503
03:22:43,681 --> 03:22:47,130
Rawlinsons Hurghada to says he destroyed
himself,

3504
03:22:48,390 --> 03:22:51,540
so he committed suicide.
Now all of a sudden,

3505
03:22:51,750 --> 03:22:56,750
cyrus just lost his piece,
and this is when we're told the battle 

3506
03:22:57,301 --> 03:23:02,301
happens.
This from the discipline core 

3507
03:23:02,301 --> 03:23:02,301
translation quote,

3508
03:23:02,990 --> 03:23:06,170
the queen on hearing that Cyrus ignored 
her terms,

3509
03:23:06,290 --> 03:23:09,500
engaged him in the field with all the 
forces she possessed,

3510
03:23:09,740 --> 03:23:14,740
the battle which followed,
I judged to have been more violent than 

3511
03:23:14,740 --> 03:23:15,080
any other fought between foreign 
nations.

3512
03:23:15,410 --> 03:23:17,300
According to the information that I 
have.

3513
03:23:17,420 --> 03:23:22,420
The engagement began with the two armies
coming to a halt within range of each 

3514
03:23:22,420 --> 03:23:25,910
other and exchanging shots with bows and
arrows until their arrows were used up,

3515
03:23:26,210 --> 03:23:30,530
after which there was a long period of 
close fighting with spears and daggers,

3516
03:23:30,680 --> 03:23:33,260
neither side being willing to retreat.
Finally,

3517
03:23:33,261 --> 03:23:35,960
however,
the massacre Gutei got the upper hand.

3518
03:23:36,110 --> 03:23:41,110
The greater part of the Persian army was
destroyed where it stood and Cyrus 

3519
03:23:41,110 --> 03:23:43,910
himself was killed.
He had been on the throne for 29 years

3520
03:23:43,920 --> 03:23:45,630
years,
and to quote,

3521
03:23:47,070 --> 03:23:52,070
of course that doesn't quite twist the 
knife enough and have you leaving the 

3522
03:23:53,221 --> 03:23:58,221
performance,
really thinking about some of the 

3523
03:23:58,221 --> 03:24:00,801
greater themes in life.
So hirata tests from my pervious 

3524
03:24:00,801 --> 03:24:05,421
translation adds a Coda to the story.
He writes,

3525
03:24:05,491 --> 03:24:05,940
quote,

3526
03:24:06,830 --> 03:24:11,830
queen terrorists then filled a wine skin
with human blood and searched for the 

3527
03:24:11,830 --> 03:24:13,520
corpse of Cyrus amongst the Persian 
dead.

3528
03:24:13,850 --> 03:24:17,150
When she found him,
she thrust his head into the wine skin,

3529
03:24:17,360 --> 03:24:20,300
and as she does abused the corpse,
she declared to it,

3530
03:24:20,690 --> 03:24:23,420
I am alive and if conquered you in 
battle,

3531
03:24:23,600 --> 03:24:26,690
but you have ruined me by taking my son 
through guile.

3532
03:24:26,990 --> 03:24:30,350
Well then just as I threatened,
I will slake your thirst

3533
03:24:30,590 --> 03:24:35,590
blood and quote.
So if as the recurring Greek motif will 

3534
03:24:37,881 --> 03:24:40,970
later show that the Persians are surreal
overreaches,

3535
03:24:42,290 --> 03:24:47,290
I'm sure Hurghada does.
His attitude here is that they should 

3536
03:24:47,290 --> 03:24:49,761
have learned their lesson with cyrus by 
the time cyrus exits the scene,

3537
03:24:50,541 --> 03:24:55,541
though he's built an empire that 
stretches from modern day Pakistan all 

3538
03:24:57,141 --> 03:25:02,141
the way to the Mediterranean.
I've been to Turkey down by the Red Sea 

3539
03:25:02,141 --> 03:25:07,031
to the borders of Egypt and out to the 
Central Asian step when he's taken you 

3540
03:25:08,920 --> 03:25:12,080
know,
efforts and spent years organizing it in

3541
03:25:12,081 --> 03:25:16,640
putting it in a form where it has a 
chance to live on after he's gone.

3542
03:25:17,810 --> 03:25:22,810
Nonetheless,
you cannot lose a person of that 

3543
03:25:22,810 --> 03:25:22,810
magnitude.
You cannot lose an Alexander.

3544
03:25:22,810 --> 03:25:27,761
You cannot lose an Napoleon.
You cannot lose and have these people 

3545
03:25:27,761 --> 03:25:30,401
from such lofty heights removed from the
scene without there being this huge 

3546
03:25:30,401 --> 03:25:34,601
vacuum a couple of hundred years after 
this time period,

3547
03:25:36,820 --> 03:25:41,820
one of the people who will fill a vacuum
and play a similar role and maybe 

3548
03:25:42,191 --> 03:25:47,191
eclipse this person will visit his tomb.
Alexander the great along with some 

3549
03:25:49,571 --> 03:25:54,571
influential colleagues will go to the 
spot and the building that is assumed to

3550
03:25:55,361 --> 03:25:57,130
be the tomb of Cyrus the great.

3551
03:25:58,920 --> 03:26:02,610
That tomb is still standing by the way,
in modern day Iran,

3552
03:26:02,611 --> 03:26:07,611
if indeed it was the tomb.
It's interesting to think of Alexander 

3553
03:26:07,611 --> 03:26:11,730
climbing up there in a fully colorized 
historical era now,

3554
03:26:11,731 --> 03:26:16,731
by the way,
bringing with him people who will write 

3555
03:26:16,731 --> 03:26:16,731
about it afterwards.
We actually have through another guy,

3556
03:26:16,731 --> 03:26:19,710
the writings of someone who was with 
Alexander and kind of describes what the

3557
03:26:19,711 --> 03:26:22,500
tune looked like,
a lot of clothing,

3558
03:26:22,501 --> 03:26:24,600
a lot of souvenirs,
a lot of things that just sort of helped

3559
03:26:24,601 --> 03:26:29,601
the guy into the afterlife sort of deal 
and then a body that was preserved in 

3560
03:26:30,391 --> 03:26:32,330
wax.
We're told this,

3561
03:26:32,400 --> 03:26:34,290
this was kind of a Persian custom too.

3562
03:26:35,990 --> 03:26:39,380
Now this might just be me,
but I had this feeling that if the queen

3563
03:26:39,381 --> 03:26:43,670
of the massive Gd or the Messa di had 
taken his head or something,

3564
03:26:44,120 --> 03:26:48,260
that's a mutilation that they would have
probably told us about.

3565
03:26:48,261 --> 03:26:53,261
It's probable that the body looked 
pretty darn good because no one talked 

3566
03:26:53,261 --> 03:26:55,880
about it looking any other way.
We're told that there was an inscription

3567
03:26:57,170 --> 03:27:02,170
on the tomb.
Now some historians think it must've 

3568
03:27:02,170 --> 03:27:02,170
been in front of the tomb because it's 
missing,

3569
03:27:02,170 --> 03:27:06,191
but they were a couple of different 
descriptions from people who supposedly 

3570
03:27:06,191 --> 03:27:07,520
saw them.
Some are more flowery than others.

3571
03:27:08,000 --> 03:27:13,000
One that I liked that has a couple of 
different versions says quote mortal.

3572
03:27:14,780 --> 03:27:19,780
I am cyrus son of Cam by ses who founded
the Persian empire and was King of Asia.

3573
03:27:20,930 --> 03:27:23,120
Grudge me not then my monument

3574
03:27:24,620 --> 03:27:29,620
and the quote,
but there are other traditions also from

3575
03:27:29,840 --> 03:27:34,840
eyewitness accounts originally that 
record a very different sort of epitaph.

3576
03:27:36,890 --> 03:27:41,890
Some of the historians are like say it's
much more traditionally Iranian to it's 

3577
03:27:41,890 --> 03:27:43,870
much more pithy and right to the point 
the Persians,

3578
03:27:43,871 --> 03:27:48,871
when they were leading the empire,
could put on the airs as well as any 

3579
03:27:48,871 --> 03:27:52,111
Mesopotamian dynasty ever did.
They could heap on all the traditional 

3580
03:27:52,111 --> 03:27:55,240
titles.
Queen Victoria had the empress of India.

3581
03:27:55,720 --> 03:27:58,390
The kings of this area had king of the 
universe,

3582
03:27:58,840 --> 03:28:01,780
King of the four corners of the earth,
King of lands,

3583
03:28:01,800 --> 03:28:06,800
and the Persians could do that,
but sometimes when they were just 

3584
03:28:06,800 --> 03:28:10,231
recording for eternity,
which is what a tomb inscription like 

3585
03:28:10,231 --> 03:28:14,300
this is,
they adopted a different style.

3586
03:28:15,970 --> 03:28:20,970
When the tomb inscription supposedly 
from an eyewitness that I liked the 

3587
03:28:20,970 --> 03:28:21,100
most,
and I like to use Cyrus's Persian,

3588
03:28:21,101 --> 03:28:24,750
he creek ish form of the name Kourosh or
Kourosh.

3589
03:28:25,780 --> 03:28:30,780
It says here I lie Kourosh,
king of kings.

3590
03:28:40,740 --> 03:28:44,940
The Persians grew up in the equivalent 
of a tough neighborhood

3591
03:28:46,690 --> 03:28:47,560
to show.
You just heard,

3592
03:28:47,561 --> 03:28:52,561
involved a lot of context.
It didn't it where we discussed the 

3593
03:28:52,561 --> 03:28:53,170
background,
where they sprung from,

3594
03:28:53,530 --> 03:28:55,240
because this does a bunch of things.
One,

3595
03:28:55,241 --> 03:28:58,060
it makes their achievements all the more
astounding.

3596
03:28:59,170 --> 03:29:04,170
I mean they arose in this world with all
these amazing competitors and manage to,

3597
03:29:05,180 --> 03:29:06,730
you know,
climb to the top of the heap.

3598
03:29:06,731 --> 03:29:11,731
Anyway,
it also helps us set a baseline for 

3599
03:29:11,731 --> 03:29:13,210
comparison.
When we say things like the Persians are

3600
03:29:13,690 --> 03:29:17,320
tolerant or lenient,
you want to immediately say,

3601
03:29:17,321 --> 03:29:22,321
compared to what the show you just heard
gives us some idea what they might be 

3602
03:29:23,021 --> 03:29:24,040
compared to.

3603
03:29:26,650 --> 03:29:28,540
Finally,
it's a fantastic story.

3604
03:29:28,541 --> 03:29:32,530
This story that's usually relegated to 
dead air between two other stories,

3605
03:29:32,531 --> 03:29:37,531
right?
Somewhere between the fall of the Syria 

3606
03:29:37,531 --> 03:29:37,690
and the rise of Persia is the,
you know,

3607
03:29:37,880 --> 03:29:41,320
latter part of the six hundreds and the 
high five,

3608
03:29:41,321 --> 03:29:42,820
85,
95,

3609
03:29:42,821 --> 03:29:43,690
five,
85.

3610
03:29:43,691 --> 03:29:48,691
What's going on during that era.
Normally it's sort of just a transition 

3611
03:29:48,691 --> 03:29:48,990
point between,
you know,

3612
03:29:49,000 --> 03:29:54,000
two chapters in a book.
Whereas all by itself it's twisted and 

3613
03:29:54,000 --> 03:29:57,361
fascinating.
And I love the idea of the great power 

3614
03:29:57,361 --> 03:30:00,511
like the US or the Soviet Union 
collapsing and the rest of the world 

3615
03:30:00,511 --> 03:30:00,850
sort of looking at each other over the,
you know,

3616
03:30:01,060 --> 03:30:06,060
smoke and ruins,
trying to figure out who gets what and 

3617
03:30:06,060 --> 03:30:06,060
what are the things look like.
Now.

3618
03:30:06,060 --> 03:30:10,500
I love that.
The key to this whole story at this 

3619
03:30:10,500 --> 03:30:10,950
point is,
you know,

3620
03:30:10,960 --> 03:30:14,560
when it took such a singular figure to 
put this improbable,

3621
03:30:15,180 --> 03:30:16,330
you know,
event together.

3622
03:30:16,450 --> 03:30:18,940
What happens when that figure exits the 
scene?

3623
03:30:19,480 --> 03:30:22,810
What are the odds of getting to Cyrus,
the greats in the same family,

3624
03:30:22,870 --> 03:30:24,160
one right after another.

3625
03:30:26,130 --> 03:30:28,380
Remember this is the largest empire in 
world history.

3626
03:30:28,381 --> 03:30:30,960
The distance from one part to another is
daunting.

3627
03:30:31,740 --> 03:30:33,300
Then you have all these different 
people,

3628
03:30:33,570 --> 03:30:38,430
people that are very independent minded 
and fractious and who gave the Assyrians

3629
03:30:38,660 --> 03:30:42,770
fits all the time.
So many different religions,

3630
03:30:42,771 --> 03:30:47,771
so many different languages.
How is in a one small minority of people

3631
03:30:48,321 --> 03:30:53,321
going to rule this giant entity,
especially without the specially gifted 

3632
03:30:53,321 --> 03:30:57,011
guy who built the whole thing.
In the next episode we'll examine how 

3633
03:30:57,011 --> 03:31:01,920
you combat isis.
The son of Cyrus manages all this and 

3634
03:31:01,941 --> 03:31:06,941
they will be coups and there will 
potentially be armies disappearing in 

3635
03:31:06,941 --> 03:31:10,210
sandstorms.
There will be far too many Greeks 

3636
03:31:10,210 --> 03:31:10,730
probably for what the story really 
warrants,

3637
03:31:11,240 --> 03:31:16,240
but you have to understand while we all 
know instinctively there important 

3638
03:31:16,240 --> 03:31:17,990
things going on in the east and the 
north and the other parts of the Persian

3639
03:31:17,991 --> 03:31:21,830
empire that don't touch Greek lands.
They only people writing about it in any

3640
03:31:21,831 --> 03:31:25,000
sort of extended colorful way are the 
Greek,

3641
03:31:25,001 --> 03:31:30,001
so just like everyone else will talk 
about the Greek and Persian wars will 

3642
03:31:30,001 --> 03:31:33,551
give some context of that battle of 
their monopoly movie scene with the 

3643
03:31:33,551 --> 03:31:33,551
Spartan.
Say,

3644
03:31:33,551 --> 03:31:34,460
come and take them

3645
03:31:37,070 --> 03:31:42,070
and then we'll deal with the guy.
The next guy really in this story,

3646
03:31:42,471 --> 03:31:47,471
who's personal talents are such that 
he's a game changer all by himself.

3647
03:31:48,230 --> 03:31:53,230
The natural successor to Cyrus the great
and the person who finally puts the 

3648
03:31:53,230 --> 03:31:56,420
stake in the heart of the black and 
white world,

3649
03:31:58,830 --> 03:32:03,830
the son of Philip of Macedonia.
All that and more in the next episode of

3650
03:32:06,811 --> 03:32:11,811
kings of kings.
If you think the show you just heard is 

3651
03:32:14,071 --> 03:32:16,770
worth a dollar,
Dan and Ben would love to have it.

3652
03:32:17,070 --> 03:32:19,170
A buck a show.
