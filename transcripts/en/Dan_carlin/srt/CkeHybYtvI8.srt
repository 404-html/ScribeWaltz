1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,280
It's hardcore history,

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,870
I've always said some of the best things
we do around here,

3
00:00:10,871 --> 00:00:15,871
our apologies,
and so I want to apologize if it seems 

4
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:18,850
as though our subject matter and um,
and the stuff we're talking about lately

5
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:23,851
all kind of falls into a narrow sort of 
subject matter or a historical period.

6
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:27,880
It's mostly been 20th century stuff.
It's not by design,

7
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:32,881
but I don't work by design.
I work on inspiration and sometimes 

8
00:00:32,881 --> 00:00:37,081
opportunity for example,
the opportunity to get a guest like the 

9
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:39,961
one we have today.
So things don't always work out in a 

10
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:43,381
balanced sort of way.
What'll probably happen is that we'll 

11
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:45,961
end up flipping at a certain point and 
then I'll start getting emails from 

12
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:46,450
people saying,
why do you never talk about 20th century

13
00:00:46,451 --> 00:00:51,451
stuff?
So we're just probably balancing things 

14
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:51,770
out in the other direction.
I'm going to talk to her.

15
00:00:51,771 --> 00:00:55,180
Max Hastings today.
Those of you who like military history,

16
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:56,500
uh,
have certainly read his work.

17
00:00:56,501 --> 00:00:58,920
He's fantastic.
You wrote inferno,

18
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:04,050
he wrote a lot of other books.
If you look at his resume as it exists 

19
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,411
now,
well if you had shown that to me when I 

20
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:07,540
was 21 years old,
I would have said,

21
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,040
oh,
that's the guy I want to be

22
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,440
his resumes long as heck.
I mean foreign correspondent for the BBC

23
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:20,460
editor in Chief of the Daily Telegraph,
editor of the evening standard,

24
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,360
a war correspondent.
I'm author,

25
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,850
prolific author,
all around,

26
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:31,851
interesting person and he's written a 
new book on Vietnam and 800 pages.

27
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:34,580
By the way,
I mean,

28
00:01:34,581 --> 00:01:37,040
it's a tome at the same time,
you know,

29
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:41,360
if your library is like mine and you 
like having certain subjects covered,

30
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:46,690
uh,
this is a necessary thing on my Vietnam 

31
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,600
section for any number of reasons.

32
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,980
Hastings has a connection to the war.
He was a war correspondent in it and it 

33
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,340
was sort of where he made his bones as a
young guy.

34
00:01:56,341 --> 00:02:00,510
Go Google him and look at the images of 
him when he was there.

35
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:05,511
And my wife thought he looked like a 
beetle war correspondents are an 

36
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:08,730
interesting species.
They don't make them like they used to,

37
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:13,731
I should say,
but at the same time there are still 

38
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:14,970
some good ones.
They sort of have a foot in both worlds.

39
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:19,971
The soldier world and the civilian world
here of people that maybe don't know war

40
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:26,751
at all,
and so somehow you need to be able to 

41
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:27,990
translate things into a language where 
you can,

42
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,840
you know,
reliably convey information so that they

43
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:35,841
can understand it.
There's no way to reliably transmit 

44
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:39,890
information on what it's like to see a 
disemboweled village chief who's had his

45
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:45,681
stomach cut out in front of the 
villagers by the Viet Cong as a lesson 

46
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,470
not to cooperate with the Americans or 
the South Vietnamese.

47
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,590
How do you,
how do you even relate that in a way 

48
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,770
that people can understand and in a way 
where they just don't not read about it.

49
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:57,330
At a certain point,
if you get graphic enough,

50
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:59,070
people won't read about it,
but then you haven't done.

51
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,330
You're supposed to do as a war 
correspondent now.

52
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:03,580
Just so you know,
it's only personal weakness.

53
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:06,910
That probably kept me from doing 
something like that.

54
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:09,280
I started reading because I was enamored
with it.

55
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,720
I'm all this stuff written and sometimes
written about their own lives that these

56
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:18,721
war correspondents had put into print 
and at a certain point you start to 

57
00:03:18,721 --> 00:03:18,880
realize,
wait a minute,

58
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,390
do you really want to live with the 
memories these guys have?

59
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:24,520
And they're sort of warning you 
sometimes when you read their books.

60
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:26,950
I mean they're telling you what they're 
dreaming about at night.

61
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,630
You deliberately over and over and over 
again go to places where awful,

62
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:35,110
awful things have happened.
Things soldiers see,

63
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:40,111
by the way,
although they don't often want to be 

64
00:03:40,111 --> 00:03:40,111
there when it happens,
the war correspondent,

65
00:03:40,111 --> 00:03:41,260
you know,
to them that's like the story,

66
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,670
right?
Let's go to the bad place.

67
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:47,671
Now.
Most of the soldiers are of the opinion 

68
00:03:47,671 --> 00:03:47,671
that they don't want to go to the bad 
place.

69
00:03:47,671 --> 00:03:47,671
They don't want to be there.

70
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,500
So Max Hastings did this job,
which always for me,

71
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:56,501
makes an interesting read because he's 
filtering in real personal experiences,

72
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,760
tastes,
smells,

73
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:04,510
the lifestyle,
the culture at the time that you just 

74
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,780
can't get researching secondhand 
sources.

75
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:10,781
It would have been a very different book
of Dan Carlin had written it from other 

76
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:13,691
people's stuff than to have a guy who 
was there who participated in the 

77
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:18,671
activities,
who interacted with all the people and 

78
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:21,701
then has had decades and decades to see 
how history played out since and to 

79
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:24,680
think about it and to sort of integrate 
it into his overall worldview.

80
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,880
The result is this new book and it's 
worth picking up if you have interest or

81
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,250
you know a lot of you,
I know the Vietnam section on your 

82
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,880
shelf.
If you wanted to say what the focus of 

83
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:36,950
the book is,
I think it's rightly put where it should

84
00:04:36,951 --> 00:04:38,540
be.
Although it covers everything.

85
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,950
That's the hardcore history books.
I mean,

86
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,360
you know,
the godlike view,

87
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,030
the hindsight view,
the leadership view,

88
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:45,710
the mid level view,
the hamlet view,

89
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:50,711
the,
the what it's like to be the guy on the 

90
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:50,711
ground view,
which is why you get 800 pages or 26.

91
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:52,010
Our hardcore history series in the first
world war.

92
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,290
Either way it's like it's explainable,
you know,

93
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,250
understandable.

94
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,090
The most interesting part to me since I 
already know the battle stuff,

95
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,290
although if you're into the battle 
stuff,

96
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,970
he's awesome.
Historically,

97
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:04,210
he's awesome.
Um,

98
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,720
the most interesting thing for me though
is to see how he can synthesize all this

99
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:12,300
stuff that's happened in the decades 
since that era.

100
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,520
I was born in 1965,
1960.

101
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:19,521
I was born by the way on,
on the one of the worst battles of the 

102
00:05:19,521 --> 00:05:19,521
war,
the one that made the movie about,

103
00:05:19,521 --> 00:05:20,460
that's my birthday.
November 14th,

104
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:23,030
nine 65 battle of the I valley.
Um,

105
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,360
but when I was a kid just starting to 
become aware,

106
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:31,370
you know,
the older brothers and those people who 

107
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:31,890
were the ones being drafted who were 
living through all this stuff.

108
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,640
So in the 19 seventies it was,
it's hard to explain.

109
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:37,470
This was a transition period in US 
history.

110
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,200
So this is what I want this introduction
to Max Hastings,

111
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,970
Sir Max Hastings interview to be.

112
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,180
Let me sort of cover the bases again for
those who weren't there and try to set 

113
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,180
up a little of this and,
and,

114
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,410
and let you know why it's important to 
you.

115
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:52,050
And why it matters in history,
in this case,

116
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:57,260
there is a before and after in us 
history and we all know there are 

117
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:57,260
several,
right?

118
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,000
You've got before,
after the civil war is a classic one for

119
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:01,430
people to use before and after the 
Vietnam era,

120
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,460
go look at a photograph of Americans 
will just choose a big city because 

121
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,200
there was a lot of continuity in some of
the less big cities where people look 

122
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,260
the same over the decades,
right?

123
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:13,520
They,
they are more conservative,

124
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:14,360
change,
less slowly,

125
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:16,220
less flashy,
more down to earth people.

126
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,310
But you get some photos from an la,
Chicago,

127
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,690
Miami,
New York,

128
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,870
some of the hip places supposedly.
And you show a photo from 1963 and you 

129
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:29,690
compare those same people in a photo in 
1973.

130
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,940
And you don't even have to say another 
word.

131
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:34,010
You know,
that the culture has totally changed.

132
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,300
The Vietnam War is one of the major 
factor points that account for this.

133
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:40,420
And there's several and they're much 
talked about it.

134
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,380
A birth control pill.
The sexual revolution,

135
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,120
uh,
music,

136
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,400
I mean just there,
there's a number of major factors,

137
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:50,840
but without the Vietnam war you might 
not have any of those things.

138
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,870
It's one of the prime movers and as a 
friend of mine who was at the protest 

139
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,981
back in the day pointed out and the 
prime mover was the fact that many 

140
00:06:59,981 --> 00:07:02,090
people might have to go and suffer in a 
war that they really didn't want to be a

141
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:07,091
part of that tends to concentrate the 
mind in a way that just some ideological

142
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:12,581
cause wouldn't that prime mover pushed 
forward a lot of the era's change in the

143
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:16,820
Zeit geist for lack of a better phrase.

144
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,580
I know that's kind of strange change in 
the guys,

145
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:22,310
but I mean the rape culture flipped now,
once again,

146
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:26,390
not in some places the American 
heartland was remarkably consistent,

147
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:31,660
but in many places and in terms of what 
Madison Avenue is feeding you and we're 

148
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:31,660
Hollywood's feeding you and all that 
stuff,

149
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,420
the culture really changed.
Vietnam is an important point in that it

150
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:38,090
was also an era of extreme disillusion 
with the government.

151
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:43,091
It's hard to explain once again how 
different Americans were before Vietnam 

152
00:07:43,091 --> 00:07:46,730
and after if I just said,
we believed our government,

153
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:52,450
that right there is hard to square.
It's so far beyond what most people 

154
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:58,370
today are raised with and it wasn't just
you believed the person in your party in

155
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:03,371
general,
Democrats and Republicans believed the 

156
00:08:03,371 --> 00:08:03,620
president.
It didn't matter who the president was,

157
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,290
you didn't think your government lied to
you.

158
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:11,291
Now that's naive of course,
but maybe if you look at us history as 

159
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:15,830
equivalent to a person growing up,
maybe you're still in your dumb teens in

160
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:20,831
that era as a country and learning some 
of these hard lessons like you know in 

161
00:08:20,831 --> 00:08:22,160
power politics,
people lie.

162
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,990
The problem is though,
is that you ended up with something 

163
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,331
called a credibility gap where the 
president had lied so many times that 

164
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:32,420
the American people weren't buying it at
all.

165
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,020
Maybe if you had returned to some level 
of perceived because it was always 

166
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,011
happening,
some perceived normalcy with the next 

167
00:08:42,011 --> 00:08:43,370
president of Americans could have had 
their faith in the honesty of government

168
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:48,371
restored.
But then you had Richard Nixon after 

169
00:08:48,371 --> 00:08:48,371
Lyndon Johnson.
So,

170
00:08:48,371 --> 00:08:51,520
I mean,
that's like being hit with a left and a 

171
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:51,520
right.
Lyndon Johnson would probably,

172
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,730
you know,
hooky and an upper cut,

173
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:54,590
you and Richard Nixon would hit you 
below the belt,

174
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:54,890
whatever.

175
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:01,310
But as a country,
the seventies was about sort of 

176
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,000
reevaluating a lot of the things 
Americans had taken for granted in terms

177
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:08,001
of our self image and whatnot.
It's hard to describe how lone ranger 

178
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:12,270
ish we felt at the time period,
how,

179
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,330
you know Philip Caputo in,
um,

180
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,080
well he,
he,

181
00:09:15,081 --> 00:09:17,070
he was the veteran who wrote rumor of 
war,

182
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:19,480
but he's quoted in supermax hastings new
book too.

183
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,060
Um,
let me read it to you.

184
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:26,380
He sort of describes the way Americans 
felt about themselves.

185
00:09:26,381 --> 00:09:31,381
Or remember this is in the Post Second 
World War era where the US is just in 

186
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:32,850
our own minds.
We saved Europe twice.

187
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,370
Then we rebuilt it with our own tax 
dollars.

188
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:39,300
Then we protected it from the Soviet 
Union and Communism and the Cold War.

189
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:39,930
I mean,
we were.

190
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:44,931
The good guys have history.
Hastings writes about Phil Kaputo quote,

191
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,500
Lieutenant Kaputo like General 
Westmoreland saw himself fulfilling the 

192
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,930
vision of John f Kennedy Kaputo then 
says,

193
00:09:53,931 --> 00:09:58,931
quote,
if he was the king of camelot than we 

194
00:09:58,931 --> 00:09:59,130
were his knights and Vietnam,
our crusade,

195
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:04,340
there was nothing we could not do 
because we were Americans and for the 

196
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,400
same reason,
whatever we did was right and quote,

197
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,760
their communist photos were quote the 
new barbarians who menace the far flung 

198
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,650
interests of the new Rome and to quote,

199
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:20,460
but it's hard to describe how the United
States saw itself as and the people,

200
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:26,371
especially in the marketing materials as
this force of good around the world and 

201
00:10:26,891 --> 00:10:31,891
with this dominance during the second 
world war gave the United States a 

202
00:10:31,891 --> 00:10:35,800
dominance that lasted for 15,
20 years in terms of of a headstart over

203
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:40,801
a broken world and the power that that 
gave you made you feel almost a 

204
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:43,780
responsibility to do something good with
it.

205
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,500
In his book,
Sir Max Hastings writes,

206
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:52,501
quote,
there was in the US and enormous self 

207
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:56,731
confidence and pride,
not unlike that of the Germans before 

208
00:10:56,731 --> 00:10:56,731
19,
14,

209
00:10:56,731 --> 00:10:59,860
a consciousness of national greatness 
seeking an outlet,

210
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:05,190
a searching for an appropriate challenge
to their powers and refusal to believe 

211
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:10,051
that any problem was beyond their 
capacity to solve statesmen who might 

212
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:14,371
themselves have doubts were conscious of
a great ground swell of public opinion 

213
00:11:14,371 --> 00:11:16,690
bearing them on and quote.

214
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,560
This was the era where John F Kennedy 
was saying,

215
00:11:20,561 --> 00:11:25,561
you know,
we will bear any burden for the success 

216
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:29,341
of liberty,
the sacrificing that the country was 

217
00:11:29,341 --> 00:11:32,011
willing to make.
It was the era where young people were 

218
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:34,801
motivated by a sense of idealism that in
some cases lead people to go to other 

219
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:35,390
countries and build,
you know,

220
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:40,550
farms and chicken coops and his work in 
the Peace Corps to others who saw a 

221
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:45,511
similar sort of mission to help people,
especially poor people in undeveloped 

222
00:11:46,061 --> 00:11:51,061
countries who needed it.
By giving them a government that was 

223
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:54,211
free.
So you see this idealism amongst all of 

224
00:11:54,211 --> 00:11:56,170
these people across a wide spectrum of 
types.

225
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,520
Now,
as far as background in the war,

226
00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:04,521
so we have some context here.
I didn't go into this with a Somax Max 

227
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:05,160
because you know,
let's not deal with the stuff we can all

228
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:07,620
find out beforehand,
but the Vietnam war,

229
00:12:07,621 --> 00:12:12,621
as many of you know,
is something that grows out of 

230
00:12:12,621 --> 00:12:16,130
colonialism.
It was one of those territories that a 

231
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:16,950
colonial power from Europe,
in this case,

232
00:12:16,951 --> 00:12:18,630
the French,
a controlled.

233
00:12:18,631 --> 00:12:23,631
It was French Indochina.
They treated it the way that colonial 

234
00:12:23,631 --> 00:12:26,690
powers usually treat these places.
Puppets,

235
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,690
they were bringing civilization was the 
line,

236
00:12:29,691 --> 00:12:34,691
but truthfully,
I mean it was a bunch of French people 

237
00:12:34,691 --> 00:12:35,120
in Nice hotels with Vietnamese waiters 
and whatnot.

238
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,560
That doesn't mean that there weren't 
people that liked it in Vietnam,

239
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,290
but when the Second World War was over 
and you know,

240
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:47,480
the anti colonialism wave was unleashed 
across the world.

241
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,810
Vietnam fell into a pattern of a lot of 
other places that we're trying to throw 

242
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:56,360
off the yoke of their colonial masters.
And in the case of Vietnam,

243
00:12:56,361 --> 00:13:01,361
there was a war before the American 
version of the Vietnam War for a long 

244
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:02,570
time.
A very bloody nasty,

245
00:13:02,571 --> 00:13:06,260
dirty war between the French and what 
were called the Viet Minh.

246
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,480
It was sometime during this period where
the ideas of fighting for Vietnam 

247
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,300
nationalism,
you know,

248
00:13:14,301 --> 00:13:14,840
the,
the,

249
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,650
the nation state a free Vietnam for 
Vietnamese run by Vietnamese.

250
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,980
Um,
at some point there are communists who 

251
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,360
become part of that movement are always 
part of it.

252
00:13:26,361 --> 00:13:29,030
And so there's this connection between 
these,

253
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,350
these militant nationalist Vietnamese 
movements and communism.

254
00:13:33,351 --> 00:13:38,351
And this will be a poison pill for 
countries like the United States 

255
00:13:38,511 --> 00:13:39,770
throughout the later

256
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,960
part of this conflict because when the 
Vietnamese eventually,

257
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:49,961
after some nasty,
nasty battles are able to win their 

258
00:13:49,961 --> 00:13:53,951
independence from the French,
the United States has already gotten 

259
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:57,551
their toe in the water in that region.
Not because they really want the French 

260
00:13:57,551 --> 00:14:01,301
to be the colonial masters anymore.
But because of that worry over 

261
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:04,841
communism.
And that's another thing that's hard to 

262
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:07,511
describe to people today is the role 
that the fear of communism played in all

263
00:14:08,721 --> 00:14:10,730
the decision making and all the 
calculations.

264
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,740
Vietnam was just one of the many 
countries that was supposedly part of 

265
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,050
the domino effect where you might say to
yourself,

266
00:14:18,051 --> 00:14:20,150
as many Americans did,
they didn't know what Vietnam was.

267
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,130
They couldn't pronounce it,
they couldn't find it on a map,

268
00:14:22,131 --> 00:14:26,120
so why do we have to send our boys on 
our money to go fight and die there?

269
00:14:26,121 --> 00:14:27,590
Well,
here's what happens,

270
00:14:27,591 --> 00:14:29,720
and remember,
this isn't Malarkey.

271
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,060
The people who are spouting it generally
believe it,

272
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:37,450
but this is just another country that 
will be toppled by the communists and 

273
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:41,771
then that country will be consolidated 
and start to try to topple the person 

274
00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:43,490
next door.
The French had a different analogy.

275
00:14:43,491 --> 00:14:44,780
They didn't use dominoes.
They they,

276
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,740
they use bowling pins,
but the idea and the image is the same,

277
00:14:48,741 --> 00:14:49,540
right?
It's A.

278
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,600
It's a toppling from one another to 
another and eventually you'll have the 

279
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,590
Soviet Union.
In Mexico there were a lot of problems.

280
00:14:57,591 --> 00:15:00,050
It turns out in hastings is book as good
at pointing this out.

281
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:05,290
There were a lot of problems in the 
decision makers understanding of all 

282
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:09,671
this,
which in hindsight seems crazy because 

283
00:15:09,671 --> 00:15:11,891
when you look at how many people would 
die and all these wars and how many 

284
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:14,681
would be killed.
Hastings book focuses on the civilians 

285
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:14,840
more than anything and,
and rightly so,

286
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:16,010
I think,
um,

287
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:21,340
but when you see all of that,
you yearn for a reason and you yearn for

288
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:28,690
just wanting to believe that the people 
who are making the decisions are at 

289
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,650
least well informed that they've gotten 
the experts,

290
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:32,390
that they,
they've got people explaining to them,

291
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:37,391
well,
let me explain the difference between 

292
00:15:37,391 --> 00:15:37,730
Soviet communism in Chinese communism 
and the relationship of,

293
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,520
of Vietnam to either of those,
I mean that,

294
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:45,521
that was already in some cases below 
where the threshold where anybody was 

295
00:15:45,521 --> 00:15:49,670
paying attention and for much of this 
conflict and for others during this time

296
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:53,390
period,
there's this belief that Moscow controls

297
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,240
everything in the communist world and 
that just wasn't true.

298
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,260
But if that's something you're basing 
all your decision making on,

299
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,080
well it's no wonder that things worked 
out the way they did.

300
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:04,430
Sometimes.
I mean,

301
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:09,490
there were occasions where our 
government just thought the other side 

302
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:14,471
was being stubborn when in reality we 
were talking to the people who had no 

303
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:16,880
control over the events we wanted to 
influence and we didn't even know it.

304
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,320
It's hard to believe you could have such
momentous decisions regularly made with 

305
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:27,350
such either bad intelligence or lack of 
understanding,

306
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,800
but let's be honest,
this is one of the things that waiting a

307
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:35,801
couple of decades or in this case five 
decades after the events so that makes 

308
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:37,730
clear you have a chance and another 
thing,

309
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:42,731
hastings,
because very good at you have a chance 

310
00:16:42,731 --> 00:16:42,731
to get the other side's point of view to
interview those people.

311
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,950
I'm considering that we're starting to 
lose that generation.

312
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,060
Just like the Second World War 
generation hastings is booked,

313
00:16:49,061 --> 00:16:54,061
might turn out to be one of those really
important things on a shelf for a very 

314
00:16:54,061 --> 00:16:57,461
long time because you can't replicate 
those discussions he had with the 

315
00:16:57,461 --> 00:16:58,580
principals.
Nevertheless,

316
00:16:58,581 --> 00:17:01,490
if you remember this period,
you remember that part of the problem,

317
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:07,090
you know,
in terms of our good guy image to 

318
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,131
ourselves was some of the news that was 
coming out of this place and what ended 

319
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:13,541
up happening in a nutshell is something 
that you see happen in a lot of other 

320
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,931
places.
You saw it with the French in their war 

321
00:17:16,931 --> 00:17:16,931
in North Africa,
right?

322
00:17:16,931 --> 00:17:20,281
In places like Algeria in the 19 fifties
where it becomes a dirty war when you 

323
00:17:20,281 --> 00:17:25,151
have civilians carrying bombs and kids 
throwing grenades into restaurants and 

324
00:17:25,151 --> 00:17:25,370
people hiding.
I mean,

325
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:31,090
it's difficult after a while to keep 
your troops from doing the sorts of 

326
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:34,970
things that the folks back home imagine 
that their troops don't do.

327
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,110
In the case of the United States,
things happen in the Vietnam War.

328
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:42,320
That if you had gone back a mere 15,
16,

329
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:47,321
17 years before and asked the American 
public whether anything like this was 

330
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:51,370
ever possible from American soldiers,
they would have denied to high heaven 

331
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,590
the Mee Lai massacre,
for example.

332
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,250
But there was regular bad stuff going 
on.

333
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:01,580
I mean,
if you're going to proclaim something 

334
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,880
like a free fire zone,
which of course in Vietnam was famous,

335
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:08,180
which means that anyone you see in this 
area is considered a bad person by 

336
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:09,870
default.
Well,

337
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:14,670
it's not going to be a good tally at the
end of the year when you start trying to

338
00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:19,671
figure out how many actual enemy you 
killed versus how many people who just 

339
00:18:19,671 --> 00:18:23,811
got in the way wrong place at the wrong 
time and that became another problem 

340
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,370
with the war.
The war had very many.

341
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,220
There were constraints on the war and 
the constraints are things that we still

342
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:34,221
talk about today because it was the cold
war and because people had nuclear 

343
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:38,421
weapons and because the Soviet Union and
the Chinese were on the other side and 

344
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:41,100
because we had just fought a sort of an 
undeclared will,

345
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,910
really undeclared war that started 
against Korea,

346
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:48,450
but ended up being American troops and 
Chinese troops killing each other.

347
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,050
The last thing that anybody wanted was 
another one of those,

348
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,470
so there was always an attempt to keep 
the war confined to certain parameters.

349
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,080
Imagine you've got this fire burning and
you just want to make sure that the fire

350
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:07,710
doesn't spread,
but at all times any conflict,

351
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:12,711
especially one going on as long as the 
Vietnam war did is a potential flash 

352
00:19:12,711 --> 00:19:15,210
point in world war three and let's 
remember as bad as Vietnam was,

353
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:20,780
imagine how bad something like that 
could have been if it became the 

354
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,420
equivalent of,
you know,

355
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:25,830
Gavrilo Princip shooting an archduke in 
Sarajevo in 1914.

356
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:32,150
We wouldn't be talking about two or 3 
million Vietnamese civilians dying in 

357
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,740
this war.
We would be talking about 100,

358
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,820
200 million people and us still clearing
out the ashes today.

359
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,950
So let's try to remember the,
the,

360
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,040
the big picture that the leaders in this
story are trying to juggle it all times.

361
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,980
So you have lack of good information 
with nuclear weapons as your punishment 

362
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,440
if you screw up.
No pressure there.

363
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:52,770
Right.

364
00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:00,380
But the 19 seventies were about coming 
to some sort of emotional terms with 

365
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,380
this and then there's those of us who 
lived through it,

366
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:06,381
it's almost not worth talking about 
because we remember it so well and it 

367
00:20:06,381 --> 00:20:06,381
was so.
I mean,

368
00:20:06,381 --> 00:20:07,770
it was beaten to death by the end,
let's be honest,

369
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,430
but new generations coming up,
don't remember any of this.

370
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,760
It was a very different postwar world 
for the veterans who came back from 

371
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,420
Vietnam because this was a war we lost 
and Americans.

372
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,600
I can again say from experience,
we used to be very proud of the fact 

373
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,901
that you could say we never lost a war.
You Canadians do not need to write me 

374
00:20:26,901 --> 00:20:27,000
about the war of 18,
12.

375
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:32,001
I realized that that's a eye of the 
beholder issue a little bit and I don't 

376
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:32,001
want to get into a couple of others with
you,

377
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:32,760
but you know,
you know what I mean?

378
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,710
Theoretically,
kind of sort of,

379
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,550
you know,
in our own minds,

380
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:37,890
we never lost a war.
Vietnam was hard to deny.

381
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,720
Vietnam also broke the army for a while 
and this is a a point that's well 

382
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:50,061
understood.
If you read about this kind of stuff 

383
00:20:50,061 --> 00:20:50,920
that's not talked about a lot,
what it did to the US army between let's

384
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:55,921
just say 65 and 70 was amazing.
Again,

385
00:20:56,261 --> 00:20:58,960
something you wouldn't have thought 
could happen to an American army,

386
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:01,780
but then it hadn't been put in that kind
of situation before.

387
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,310
As we said,
look at the French.

388
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:08,311
In Algeria,
you find yourselves in these kinds of 

389
00:21:08,311 --> 00:21:09,010
situations and all of a sudden it's a 
little bit different.

390
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:13,180
You had drug abuse,
you add the short tour of duty.

391
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:18,181
There were a lot of things.
The army really looked at a lot of 

392
00:21:18,181 --> 00:21:20,641
things after the war to try to figure 
out what had happened and if you're 

393
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:20,641
interested in that subject.

394
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:24,060
By the way,
Andrew j Bacevich has written several 

395
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,911
books.
I'm describing the rebuilding of the US 

396
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:32,040
military after Vietnam and what was 
required and the safeguards that the 

397
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,691
military brass tried to put into place 
to keep the civilians from ever putting 

398
00:21:36,691 --> 00:21:36,850
them in.
That situation again,

399
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,240
didn't work,
but there were safeguards put into A.

400
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,240
Colin Powell is written about this too 
and he was involved in some of this 

401
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,941
stuff,
but people don't talk about that very 

402
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:47,941
much for the.
You know,

403
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:51,890
you could look at the American army in 
1973 who and that's from the Vietnam War

404
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,210
and it wasn't just,
you know,

405
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:57,550
the,
the morale and whatnot.

406
00:21:57,551 --> 00:21:58,960
I mean,
there was um,

407
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:04,410
a real,
I mean fragging was something that was 

408
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:04,410
talked about a lot and you know what 
fragging is,

409
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:08,161
right?
The shooting of your own officers or 

410
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:08,161
the,
you know,

411
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:08,161
you throw a grenade at them when no 
one's looking.

412
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:12,690
We were fragging our officers sometimes 
you don't find a lot of that from the 

413
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:18,210
Second World War,
but in the Second World War we had a 

414
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,300
very different kind of us image.
And the thing about the images,

415
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,060
you kind of live up to that where you 
try to write.

416
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:23,650
So you just stayed away.
Americans don't do this.

417
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,530
It became hard to say Americans don't do
this.

418
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,940
After Vietnam.
It was,

419
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,850
it was the war that proved that we were 
human,

420
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:32,440
right?
We were,

421
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,810
we,
we were as good guys as we tried to be,

422
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:39,811
but we were human.
Anybody who goes back and dives deep 

423
00:22:39,811 --> 00:22:41,680
into things like the Filipino 
insurrection or,

424
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,090
you know,
some of the native American war,

425
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,070
certainly,
uh,

426
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,150
we've proven this point before in us 
history.

427
00:22:46,151 --> 00:22:51,151
Nonetheless.
You kind of need to relearn it every 

428
00:22:51,151 --> 00:22:51,151
generation or two.
It seems

429
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,650
one of the other things hastings focuses
on and I think it's,

430
00:22:58,651 --> 00:23:03,030
it's an excellent point is how bad the 
other side was there.

431
00:23:03,031 --> 00:23:04,230
His,
as he said,

432
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,930
a little self flagellation on the part 
of Americans.

433
00:23:06,931 --> 00:23:09,150
But he was a hard thing for us to 
absorb.

434
00:23:09,151 --> 00:23:11,040
I mean,
it's a huge deal.

435
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,500
Uh,
the country was,

436
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:17,510
was wrestling with huge issues in the 19
seventies to early 19 eighties about 

437
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:17,510
this.
I was,

438
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,510
um,
I was in,

439
00:23:18,511 --> 00:23:23,511
uh,
one of the early courses and 60 minutes 

440
00:23:23,511 --> 00:23:25,731
did a whole big thing on this because it
was groundbreaking at the time that 

441
00:23:25,731 --> 00:23:29,180
undergraduates were taking it at 
universities where the Vietnam War was 

442
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,380
on the curriculum.
And one of the things that they would do

443
00:23:31,381 --> 00:23:33,500
is bring in these veterans to talk to 
you,

444
00:23:33,501 --> 00:23:34,350
you know,
in every class.

445
00:23:34,351 --> 00:23:38,100
So I took one of the University of 
Colorado and we had a veteran who sat in

446
00:23:38,101 --> 00:23:40,470
the back of the class and we didn't know
he was a veteran because these guys were

447
00:23:40,471 --> 00:23:45,471
like 32 or 33 years old when they were 
talking to her class and sat in the 

448
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:49,881
back,
the classroom the whole time and then 

449
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:49,881
like after eight weeks or something,
stood up and said,

450
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:50,630
I've been watching this whole class as 
part of my recovery.

451
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,220
I'm trying to come to grips with all 
this.

452
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:55,610
We actually showed a movie in the class 
that showed a helicopter door gunner and

453
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:57,200
he said,
that movie showed me.

454
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,300
I was the helicopter door gunner you saw
in that film,

455
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,830
boom.
But we,

456
00:24:01,831 --> 00:24:05,720
we're all wrestling with things back 
back then and it's hard to describe to a

457
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:10,721
generation now who grows up in an era 
where no one ever believes their 

458
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:13,481
government.
And that's just the right way to be by 

459
00:24:13,481 --> 00:24:15,281
the way.
And the United States is fully seen as 

460
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,420
a,
basically a good guy,

461
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:19,550
but fully fallible.
I'm fallible.

462
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:23,710
Part was not something that people 
thought of say in the early 19 sixties.

463
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:28,750
We were a force for good only in our 
minds and so it was this huge mental 

464
00:24:31,341 --> 00:24:34,310
rearrangement in the seventies.
If you look at the material,

465
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:39,311
I mean there was a lot of introspection 
and it wasn't just introspection amongst

466
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:44,921
the general population,
but the military also and the political 

467
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:46,880
class when we eventually,
I believe,

468
00:24:46,881 --> 00:24:49,640
was it Panama,
like 1989 or something.

469
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,190
When that happened,
I think President Bush,

470
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,480
the first had said something like,
you know,

471
00:24:53,481 --> 00:24:56,030
we finally kicked the Vietnam Syndrome 
or whatnot,

472
00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:01,150
and the Vietnam Syndrome was the,
the after effect where all of a sudden 

473
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:05,320
the United States didn't want to go and 
mess with other countries for awhile.

474
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,340
We'd had enough of that for a while.
It wasn't just,

475
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:08,750
um,
the,

476
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:10,660
the soldiers who had died and were 
willing to do,

477
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:15,700
or the veterans who were increasingly 
showing signs of being a badly effected 

478
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,751
by what happened to them in the war.
But the cost and the blow back and there

479
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:22,070
was just this feeling for a while,
no more.

480
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:27,730
But again,
time passes and people change and you 

481
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,720
forget just how bad it can be when 
things go wrong.

482
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,630
And make no mistake about it,
things went wrong in Vietnam.

483
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,800
The idea that the United States of 
America after the Second World War were 

484
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,680
still at this pinnacle of of industrial 
might and military power.

485
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:48,010
The idea that a bunch of backward 
gorillas in what we called a third world

486
00:25:49,491 --> 00:25:52,850
country with no money and no,
I mean they've got no.

487
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:58,140
There's,
there's nothing that they could beat us 

488
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,530
that right there was a hard pill to 
swallow,

489
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:03,380
but it reminded military and political 
leaders once again,

490
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:08,770
that war is not disconnected from 
politics as Clausewitz so famously said,

491
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:14,410
and what you're really after in any of 
these situations is a political 

492
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:18,041
settlement or a political change.
If your enemy or your adversary or your 

493
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:23,651
opponent does not give in when you beat 
the hell out of them and give you what 

494
00:26:23,651 --> 00:26:24,260
you want politically,
you don't.

495
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:29,090
When the United States did not lose a 
major encounter in the Vietnam war,

496
00:26:29,091 --> 00:26:34,091
and the bigger the encounter,
the more likely the United States one 

497
00:26:34,091 --> 00:26:34,460
and one big,
one of the most famous.

498
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,090
Most Americans that know anything about 
this war.

499
00:26:38,091 --> 00:26:43,091
I have heard the words Tet offensive 
before it was a famous Vietnamese 

500
00:26:43,091 --> 00:26:46,650
northern Vietnamese attack in many 
places at once.

501
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,420
That was a disaster for them,
but it was not portrayed that way at the

502
00:26:51,421 --> 00:26:56,421
time.
I remember one veteran explaining to me 

503
00:26:56,421 --> 00:26:58,131
just how unbelievable the casualties 
were that the north Vietnamese and Viet 

504
00:26:58,131 --> 00:27:02,900
Cong suffered in that offensive,
but it wasn't about body counts.

505
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,460
They weren't fighting a war for body 
counts.

506
00:27:06,461 --> 00:27:10,870
They were fighting a war for a political
settlement and because the United States

507
00:27:10,871 --> 00:27:14,590
had lied to it's people so often about 
how the war was going,

508
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:20,070
what the other side did by sacrificing a
ton of their people and material was 

509
00:27:20,531 --> 00:27:21,190
say,
Hey,

510
00:27:21,191 --> 00:27:23,470
war's not over.
And at the same time,

511
00:27:23,471 --> 00:27:27,160
basically demonstrate to everyone that 
what they'd been told was false,

512
00:27:27,161 --> 00:27:29,950
which turned the people once more 
against the political regime.

513
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,020
If you're in,
if you're,

514
00:27:32,021 --> 00:27:34,000
if you think about this,
I hate to do this because it's,

515
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:34,930
it's,
um,

516
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,700
there's no respect.
I mean,

517
00:27:36,701 --> 00:27:37,660
it just,
it seems wrong.

518
00:27:37,661 --> 00:27:42,661
But if you think about it like a game 
and you're playing one side or the 

519
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:46,861
other,
it's fascinating to see how if you get 

520
00:27:46,861 --> 00:27:47,530
to be the north Vietnamese communists 
side in this,

521
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:52,531
how,
how little you have to play with in 

522
00:27:52,531 --> 00:27:53,860
terms of real pieces that have any 
power,

523
00:27:53,861 --> 00:27:58,510
the other side's got all the good pieces
and yet there's ways to win without them

524
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,570
and that's what I mean.
The guy when I was growing up as guys in

525
00:28:01,571 --> 00:28:06,400
black pajamas beat the US military 
incomprehensible,

526
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,920
but an entire generation of military 
personnel who were mostly junior 

527
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,481
officers in that war would grow up to 
influence the way the US military 

528
00:28:17,481 --> 00:28:18,810
developed 10,
15,

529
00:28:18,811 --> 00:28:23,811
20,
25 years and now all the way to now in 

530
00:28:23,811 --> 00:28:26,040
the footprints of Vietnam are all over 
this military.

531
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:31,510
It's back mostly.
And while it would be sort of outside 

532
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:35,820
the norms of human history to expect us 
not to make the same mistakes,

533
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,400
they certainly changed a bunch of things
so that,

534
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,210
well,
this war will never be lost in America's

535
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:43,290
living rooms.
Again.

536
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:46,470
As the old saying was,
it's astounding and I'll wrap it up.

537
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:47,820
So to hear when you,
when you listen to,

538
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:52,870
or Max Hastings as a war correspondent,
the kind of freedom that they had to 

539
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:58,041
cover that war.
And it was a weird situation because if 

540
00:28:58,041 --> 00:28:58,800
you look at press coverage in the second
world war and Korea,

541
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:04,160
it's highly regulated and censored.
So then the next big war after Korea,

542
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:05,910
Korea ends in what?
Fifty one,

543
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,850
52.
The next big war starts ramping up 63,

544
00:29:08,851 --> 00:29:12,720
64 in Vietnam with a lot of advisors.
I mean who has 16,500

545
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:15,240
at one point before the real troops came
in.

546
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:15,990
Um,

547
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:22,510
the media all of a sudden doesn't have 
those constraints for really the first 

548
00:29:22,611 --> 00:29:24,500
time in modern American history 
certainly.

549
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,150
And they seem to get less and less 
constrained as the war goes on.

550
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:34,151
And when you see some of these,
there's one famous firefight where the 

551
00:29:34,151 --> 00:29:35,060
reporter is what?
I think it's during tet,

552
00:29:35,061 --> 00:29:37,730
where the reporter walks up to US troops
that are,

553
00:29:37,731 --> 00:29:42,731
um,
at a wall I think may be marines that 

554
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:44,080
are a wall and they are fighting 
something right on the other side of the

555
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:47,260
wall.
And they are reloading their weapons and

556
00:29:47,261 --> 00:29:52,261
then standing up and shooting at the 
other side of the wall and the reporter 

557
00:29:52,261 --> 00:29:52,690
walks right up and starts interviewing.
The guy is,

558
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:54,790
he's reloading is gun during the 
firefight.

559
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,560
Now two things stand out at you right 
there.

560
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,290
Number one is that's a ballsy reporter,
right?

561
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:02,020
That's a war correspondent of the sort 
that are just,

562
00:30:02,021 --> 00:30:02,950
they're amazing,
right?

563
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:07,990
I've always had an admiration for their 
willingness to go get the story when 

564
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:12,241
they go get the story like that.
I don't mean Ernie pyle was killed by a 

565
00:30:12,241 --> 00:30:12,241
sniper machine gun.
I think actually,

566
00:30:12,241 --> 00:30:12,600
um,
you know,

567
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,810
covering the Second World War.
But the other thing you realize is that,

568
00:30:16,811 --> 00:30:21,811
that is absolutely uncensored work 
content coming right back to America's 

569
00:30:21,811 --> 00:30:24,880
living rooms.
And if I recall going from memory here,

570
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,070
when the reporter asked the soldier 
something like,

571
00:30:27,071 --> 00:30:28,090
you know,
what did he want to reach?

572
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,560
I want to get outta here.
You know what I mean?

573
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,060
It was one of these,
I just want to get out of here.

574
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:31,990
I just want to get.
I mean,

575
00:30:31,991 --> 00:30:36,991
it was not a pro war Rah Rah Rah thing.
It was something that the folks at home 

576
00:30:36,991 --> 00:30:37,150
would go,
oh my goodness,

577
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,650
now here's two sides to this,
um,

578
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:44,970
side number one is that's reality and 
please put me firmly in the camp of,

579
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:50,470
you know,
if you're going to go to these wars and 

580
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,051
you can expect people to support them,
they have to know what it is and they 

581
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:52,870
have to know what it is in living color 
just like that.

582
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:56,380
So I'm on that side,
but let's understand that the other side

583
00:30:56,381 --> 00:31:01,381
is Max Hastings points out in this book 
didn't show their people that kind of 

584
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:01,390
press coverage,
right?

585
00:31:01,391 --> 00:31:04,780
So they're rigidly controlling what the 
communist people see.

586
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,840
They don't get to see all their death or
their suffering all their atrocities and

587
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:12,841
the other side's got it in living color.
And our friends who don't like us so 

588
00:31:12,841 --> 00:31:13,900
much,
there were some countries that love hate

589
00:31:13,901 --> 00:31:15,550
relationships.
So do they play this stuff up?

590
00:31:15,551 --> 00:31:20,551
Huge.
And you'll notice we didn't have 

591
00:31:20,551 --> 00:31:21,220
Americans doing much protesting during 
the second world war.

592
00:31:21,221 --> 00:31:26,221
We were bombing Germany and Japan and we
haven't had by Vietnam standards much in

593
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:30,220
the way of those things since Vietnam.
We had a few big ones,

594
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,200
but you know,
nothing's to stain Vietnam,

595
00:31:32,201 --> 00:31:36,460
the sustained pressure with lots and 
lots of people protesting for long time.

596
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,140
I haven't had that sense either.

597
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:44,050
Could you suggest that maybe it's 
because they aren't being exposed to the

598
00:31:44,051 --> 00:31:49,051
same sort of a video and photos and 
stories that the American people saw in 

599
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:54,520
the 1960 [inaudible] and 19 seventies?
Well,

600
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,220
if so,
and you can call that one of the,

601
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:02,340
I guess successful reforms that the army
and Navy and Marine Corp leaders,

602
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,820
the Air Force leader is learned from 
that era.

603
00:32:06,821 --> 00:32:09,190
If they believed that the war was lost 
in the living room.

604
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,380
Well,
don't do that again and we don't.

605
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:16,030
But back in supermax Max Hastings Day,
we did.

606
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:20,020
So I'm pleased to introduce,
if you've never heard him,

607
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,790
well my goodness,
if you never read his books,

608
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:26,530
if you're a military history fan,
well then you have a whole bunch to pick

609
00:32:26,531 --> 00:32:26,980
up.
I mean,

610
00:32:26,981 --> 00:32:28,240
in Ferno,
go get in front of.

611
00:32:28,241 --> 00:32:30,370
That's a good one.
But this latest one of Vietnam also.

612
00:32:30,371 --> 00:32:31,630
Fantastic.
Uh,

613
00:32:31,631 --> 00:32:33,030
so without further ado,
uh,

614
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:37,840
I'm honored to talk to Sir Max Hastings 
today about his new book,

615
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,980
Vietnam.

616
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,800
Hello,
Max?

617
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:43,900
Yeah,

618
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,630
listen,
thank you so much.

619
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,520
I'm sure they've got you on the book,
publicity,

620
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:53,580
a factory assembly line to.
We'll try to make this as painless and 

621
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:53,580
fun as possible.

622
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,610
It'll be completely painless.

623
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,910
Oh,
I'm a big fan actually.

624
00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:00,560
Um,
I will admit though,

625
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,940
I haven't gotten through the latest 
book.

626
00:33:01,941 --> 00:33:05,150
I didn't get it in time.
I'm enjoying it immensely though,

627
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:10,151
and it's a subject near and dear to my 
heart as all Americans and in my 

628
00:33:10,151 --> 00:33:11,540
generation probably had no way to avoid.
Um,

629
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,810
I was born during the battle of the,
uh,

630
00:33:15,811 --> 00:33:16,800
of the.
I drank valley,

631
00:33:16,801 --> 00:33:18,510
so November 14th,
1965.

632
00:33:18,511 --> 00:33:19,470
I'm 52.

633
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,590
Oh,
well that makes you a generation younger

634
00:33:22,591 --> 00:33:23,010
than me.

635
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:24,220
Well,
listen,

636
00:33:24,221 --> 00:33:29,221
I want,
and I want to talk about that a little 

637
00:33:29,221 --> 00:33:30,661
bit.
It's fascinating to read something from 

638
00:33:30,661 --> 00:33:33,830
a 21st century perspective that I 
actually grew up in,

639
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:36,980
in the wake or the wash of a.
and I was wondering,

640
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,320
how different is this book from 
something you would have written much 

641
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,580
more closer to the time you were in 
country now,

642
00:33:45,581 --> 00:33:46,890
for example,
the audience doesn't know this.

643
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,460
Let me make sure that they do.
Um,

644
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,560
this is a book from a British 
perspective,

645
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:53,020
which we don't normally get with Vietnam
war books.

646
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,400
Uh,
it's also,

647
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,560
um,
it's also able to,

648
00:33:56,561 --> 00:33:58,570
as I said,
give us a 21st century,

649
00:33:58,571 --> 00:34:03,571
look back at something that many of the 
books I was reading were written in the 

650
00:34:03,571 --> 00:34:04,270
19 eighties for example.
And you were actually there.

651
00:34:04,271 --> 00:34:06,400
So,
so give me a perspective a little bit on

652
00:34:06,401 --> 00:34:08,320
how writing this book now was different 
than,

653
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:13,150
than how the 25 or 28 year old,
Sir Max Hastings would have written it.

654
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,480
Stupid officer back in the 19 sixties.
Although I'm British America and its 

655
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:30,880
history has been deeply etched into my 
own experience because I lived here in 

656
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,410
[inaudible] 67 or 68.
Uh,

657
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:35,860
and I witnessed up the huge 
demonstrations.

658
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:41,020
Um,
I met a lot of the key players of the 

659
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,320
Robert Kennedy's,
the Eugene McCarthy is,

660
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:46,680
um,
and I went the White House and listened 

661
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,321
to Lyndon Johnson haranguing,
a group of US foreign journalists about 

662
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:53,990
up,
about why he was so passionate and 

663
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:54,920
committed to the war.
And this was in January 1968.

664
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:59,870
And of course we were hugely impressed 
to be meeting the president.

665
00:34:59,871 --> 00:35:04,871
That was me,
22 years old sitting in the cabinet 

666
00:35:04,871 --> 00:35:04,871
role.
Um,

667
00:35:04,871 --> 00:35:06,140
Johnson.
He behaved in many ways,

668
00:35:06,141 --> 00:35:10,310
quite like his character to in the dea.
Started out by saying saying,

669
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:15,490
uh,
some of you may like blondes and some 

670
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,130
who may like redheads and some of you 
may not like women at all,

671
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:18,700
but I'm here this morning to tell you 
what kind I like.

672
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,040
He said,
I'm prepared to sit down with Holcim in 

673
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,300
a nice hotel with nice food and sit down
to talk to settle this thing.

674
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,720
And he spoke for 40 minutes and then he 
got up and he didn't take questions,

675
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,430
you said.
Right.

676
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,170
Very nice to meet you.
Already went out the room.

677
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:38,890
But then suddenly,
just as we were gathering together all 

678
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,440
notes and we'd been hugely impressed 
those how could we not be.

679
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,990
I'm an I was by far the youngest of the 
group,

680
00:35:42,991 --> 00:35:46,090
but nonetheless we were all quite a 
young group and meeting the president of

681
00:35:46,091 --> 00:35:51,091
the United States.
But suddenly he put his head round the 

682
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:54,021
door again.
I'm a little bit sheepishly and he came 

683
00:35:54,021 --> 00:35:54,690
back in and he said,
before you all go,

684
00:35:54,691 --> 00:35:58,470
I'd like to ask your one question 
meeting me.

685
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:03,620
Have any of you changed your minds about
anything you've read or heard about 

686
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:03,620
maybe before you came?

687
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:07,950
And we were absolutely stunned into 
silence by spectacle as the president of

688
00:36:07,951 --> 00:36:12,951
United States.
I'm carrying six months what a load of 

689
00:36:12,951 --> 00:36:16,370
kids like us thought.
But that was a reflection of how 

690
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:16,920
vulnerable Johnson felt that.
And then of course,

691
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:21,230
couple of years later I went to Vietnam 
for BBC television on.

692
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:26,840
I did quite a lot of reporting there 
right through until 75 when I came out 

693
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,500
of the embassy compound and the final 
evacuation.

694
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,860
So this was all etched,
deepen my experience.

695
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:37,190
But the key thing that has changed 
meanwhile is that I very much bought 

696
00:36:38,341 --> 00:36:42,780
into the idea that not only was this a 
disastrous war,

697
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:46,230
which indeed it was,
but the because of the United States was

698
00:36:46,231 --> 00:36:50,130
tied up with a bad cause.
Therefore the other sides must be a good

699
00:36:50,131 --> 00:36:55,131
cause.
And I've come to believe having studied 

700
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:59,290
a huge amount of material from north 
Vietnam and from the communist side and 

701
00:36:59,290 --> 00:36:59,290
so on.

702
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:04,180
That's really north Vietnam and South 
Vietnam I've come to believe were two 

703
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:08,871
rival tyrannies and the idea that g men 
was a good guy anymore than march its 

704
00:37:08,871 --> 00:37:13,590
own walls or Jay Guevara.
These were absolutely ruthless 

705
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,360
revolutionary and they did terrible 
stuff.

706
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:20,740
And whereas everybody has seen the 
pictures of the south Vietnamese police 

707
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:25,611
chief of executing the viet cong 
prisoner in 1968 on the naked kid 

708
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:28,530
running away after a south Vietnamese 
napalm strike.

709
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:34,190
The communists made very sure that when 
our photographs of many of the dreadful 

710
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:37,690
things that their side did,
the terrorism that I'm in,

711
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:42,710
for instance,
a entirely reliable or story of one 

712
00:37:42,811 --> 00:37:47,811
among many village chiefs who was being 
buried alive in the Mekong Delta in the 

713
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:54,050
early 19 sixties by the local communists
in front of all these fellow villages to

714
00:37:54,721 --> 00:37:59,721
demonstrate that the price of all on 
redacting the revolution was much worse 

715
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:04,911
than death and he pleaded for most of 
our bullet and the prominence cadres 

716
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,410
just said that they save the bullets for
the,

717
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:12,890
for the imperialists and in the tet 
offensive of 1968 when thousands of 

718
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,450
perfectly innocent people whose worse 
crime as to support the south.

719
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:22,500
That means government were executed in 
cold blood by the Communist.

720
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:27,740
Again,
no pictures of we didn't see all this 

721
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,651
stuff and I've come to believe that 
although I don't believe for a moment 

722
00:38:31,771 --> 00:38:33,920
that the war was winnable,
that we weren't.

723
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:37,060
We did allow ourselves,
those of us who were correspondence that

724
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:39,010
are all those of us who are reporting 
the war.

725
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:45,150
All we could see,
and most of the stuff we were writing 

726
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:48,031
about was what a terrible mess United 
States and the South Vietnamese were 

727
00:38:48,031 --> 00:38:52,321
making of it.
And yet we saw in 1975 that when the 

728
00:38:52,321 --> 00:38:53,750
communists game par,
um,

729
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:57,080
the ruthlessness and the incompetence 
with which they behaved,

730
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:03,090
starvation descended on the Vietnamese 
people in the 19 eighties and any idea 

731
00:39:03,371 --> 00:39:08,371
that the other side,
we're the good guys now seems to be out 

732
00:39:08,371 --> 00:39:08,371
of order.
And I've come very strongly to believe.

733
00:39:08,371 --> 00:39:13,260
One is to,
of most events in history that neither 

734
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,470
side had a monopoly of a virtue or vice.

735
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:19,470
So that's one thing.
The second thing I think is hugely 

736
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,790
important is that we are overwhelmingly 
fact.

737
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,880
We were with the Americans,
um,

738
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,590
and with the US army and the US Marine 
Corps and so on.

739
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,840
And we saw this through an American 
prison.

740
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:32,830
And yet this was overwhelming.
They're Vietnamese tragedy.

741
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,250
But while 58,000
Americans died in Vietnam,

742
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:40,420
something over 2 million,
2 million Vietnamese died,

743
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:45,840
at least 40 for every American.
Not to mention countless low on 

744
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,951
Cambodians as well.
So I spent a huge amount of time 

745
00:39:49,951 --> 00:39:53,940
researching a Vietnamese sources and 
interviewing Vietnamese and sure there 

746
00:39:53,941 --> 00:39:58,941
are a lot of Americans in my story 
because the Americans made the big 

747
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:02,461
decisions,
but I've also tried to put the 

748
00:40:02,461 --> 00:40:06,031
Vietnamese where they belong,
which is the central of the stage of 

749
00:40:06,031 --> 00:40:06,310
this huge tragedy.

750
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:11,870
Well,
I think you bring up an interesting 

751
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,451
quandary that people can understand 
because we're confronted with it not 

752
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,770
uncommonly,
even in the modern world,

753
00:40:15,771 --> 00:40:19,070
which is with the communist as bad as 
they were,

754
00:40:19,071 --> 00:40:24,071
and doing all these things you were 
talking about without knowing how the 

755
00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:27,941
war was gonna turn out.
Does that legitimize the involvement of 

756
00:40:27,941 --> 00:40:29,480
a of one of the two great superpowers of
the time?

757
00:40:29,481 --> 00:40:31,400
In other words,
can you make a moral case that the right

758
00:40:31,401 --> 00:40:36,401
thing was done because this sort of 
thing was happening and it was 

759
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:36,401
understood that if the communists took 
over South Vietnam,

760
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:37,880
there'd be a bloodbath and all these 
other things,

761
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:43,180
and yet all of the things that you talk 
about in the later part of your book 

762
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:47,231
after the US get involved shows exactly 
how nasty it is for the Vietnamese 

763
00:40:47,231 --> 00:40:51,731
people.
As you pointed out when we did get 

764
00:40:51,731 --> 00:40:52,160
involved for all the right reasons.
How should you know?

765
00:40:52,161 --> 00:40:57,161
Fifty years of thinking about this and 
seeing how things play out in the 

766
00:40:57,161 --> 00:41:01,001
region.
How do you square the difference 

767
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:01,001
between.
It might be morally right to go in there

768
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:04,250
and try to save these people from a 
terrible fate and yet while doing so,

769
00:41:04,251 --> 00:41:06,320
inflicted even worse fade on them.
I mean,

770
00:41:06,321 --> 00:41:07,670
how do you square?
How does that.

771
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,990
How does that go in your head these 
days?

772
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:16,460
Absolutely.
In my book to people who I got to know a

773
00:41:19,851 --> 00:41:24,851
bit when I was a young reporter covering
his campaign in 68 general gave Jim 

774
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:28,240
Galvin,
whom I also knew who was a world war two

775
00:41:28,241 --> 00:41:32,680
power true here on Jim Gavin and Eugene 
McCarthy.

776
00:41:32,681 --> 00:41:35,960
Both said I'm at a pretty early stage.
They said,

777
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,560
whatever the virtue of your cause,
if you fight over a village of five or 

778
00:41:41,871 --> 00:41:46,871
six times,
an awful lot of people are going to die 

779
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:49,811
and you find yourself thinking at some 
point there's got to be some 

780
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:52,481
proportionality that even if what you 
want to achieve in a place and 

781
00:41:53,451 --> 00:41:56,160
especially in Vietnam is,
is uh,

782
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:01,300
something that is worthwhile and decent.
But in the end you find yourself in 

783
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,890
danger of destroying the very thing that
you're trying to try to save on.

784
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:07,820
The has to be proportionality on one 
point,

785
00:42:07,821 --> 00:42:12,821
which is at the core of my own book,
is that I think a mistake we've made in 

786
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:16,220
the past and we go on making and 
remember the British have been very much

787
00:42:16,221 --> 00:42:20,060
associated with the United States in 
Iraq and in Afghanistan and so on.

788
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:24,860
Is that although there has to be a 
military dimension,

789
00:42:24,861 --> 00:42:26,330
if you're going to do these 
interventions,

790
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,950
the key thing is always cultural and 
social and economic,

791
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:36,050
and if you can't have some sort of 
cultural engagement with these societies

792
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:39,050
in which you intervene,
then you're completely wasting your time

793
00:42:39,051 --> 00:42:44,051
winning firefights and to me,
and I've said this in the last chapter 

794
00:42:44,051 --> 00:42:48,461
of my book,
you go on winning firefights and these 

795
00:42:48,461 --> 00:42:48,560
bases and killing bad guys till the cows
come home,

796
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:53,450
but unless you've got some linkage with 
the local people,

797
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:57,350
and I was always very struck by somebody
who's become a friend.

798
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:02,380
Hr mcmaster,
who more recently was Donald Trump's 

799
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,360
national security advisor that hr 
mcmaster,

800
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:08,150
who's an outstanding American army 
officer.

801
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:11,060
Um,
one day about 2006,

802
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:16,061
we were having lunch together and he was
telling me about all the great things 

803
00:43:16,061 --> 00:43:18,260
that his armored calvary regiment had 
done in Iraq.

804
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:23,090
And then he ended up by saying the 
trouble was there was nothing to join up

805
00:43:23,091 --> 00:43:24,440
to.
Now,

806
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,160
what he meant was that there was no sort
of local government,

807
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:33,190
the local community to be able to fill 
in after they'd finished winning the 

808
00:43:34,731 --> 00:43:37,950
battles and exactly the same.
Neil Sheehan,

809
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:40,940
I'm a very famous American correspondent
in Vietnam.

810
00:43:40,941 --> 00:43:43,070
When I was telling him that story a 
couple of years ago,

811
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:48,710
um,
we were discussing and you said it was 

812
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:48,710
the same problem in Vietnam.
There was nothing to join up to.

813
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:53,680
And I've said in my book that I think 
the main reason that the communists 

814
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,071
ended up winning in,
in Vietnam was not because they were 

815
00:43:57,071 --> 00:44:01,181
particularly better soldiers,
but because they were Vietnamese and 

816
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:04,700
always this problem and it's one sees it
in Iraq and Afghanistan again,

817
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,090
but a lot of the time the locals don't 
like foreigners,

818
00:44:08,091 --> 00:44:09,950
whether they are British or American or 
whatever.

819
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,440
And um,
I,

820
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:17,550
I talked to a Vietnamese who's now 
become a very successful businessman in 

821
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:21,620
California.
And he was saying to me that when he was

822
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:26,770
living in Vietnam as a young man,
you said the communists were constantly 

823
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:30,710
reminding us how humiliating it was to 
be occupied by the Americans.

824
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,020
They had the monopoly of patriotism.
Um,

825
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,900
what we have to find ways of doing and 
these interventions is,

826
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:43,010
is hard to,
while trying to help these people we 

827
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,430
can't take over their country is out.
Of course,

828
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:48,030
the United States was effectively 64,
65.

829
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:54,470
Everybody knew that the South Vietnamese
who were supposed to be running the 

830
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:57,861
country couldn't get out of bed in the 
morning without asking the Americans 

831
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:01,251
which side to get out.
And the Communists were able to exploit 

832
00:45:01,251 --> 00:45:03,540
that.
So although I'm in any idea that was all

833
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:08,541
the kids thought in the sixties,
that was a sort of saintly figure out 

834
00:45:08,541 --> 00:45:09,870
members,
a ruthless revolutionary,

835
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:15,500
but he achieved a state of status or 
stature as the victor in the colonial 

836
00:45:17,971 --> 00:45:22,110
war against the French,
which the United States and the,

837
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,150
the,
the what the United States called.

838
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,130
I've still got my old press card from 
Vietnam.

839
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:31,340
Free Weld forces were never able to find
anybody who looked like the Patriots and

840
00:45:31,831 --> 00:45:33,440
the hero and the nationalist.
And how'd she.

841
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:36,540
Men died on the southern side.
Um,

842
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,990
but I don't know.
The longer I write history books and the

843
00:45:39,991 --> 00:45:44,991
more you come to learn that very often 
you can't say it's good Vivo on the 

844
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:51,620
blackfeet why?
These things were always very 

845
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,800
complicated and I felt even when I was a
young reporter in Vietnam,

846
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,430
I never thought the United States look 
like winning this war,

847
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,820
but even then I never felt the other 
side deserved to either.

848
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:05,570
You bring up some very interesting 
points in the book of things that make 

849
00:46:06,261 --> 00:46:09,100
you feel like the government is inept 
and then you realize,

850
00:46:09,101 --> 00:46:11,710
but we do it over and over again,
so maybe it's built into the,

851
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:12,850
to the cake.
As we say.

852
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:18,030
For example,
and to piggyback off the point you just 

853
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:20,971
made about the south Vietnamese 
government trying to appear as though 

854
00:46:20,971 --> 00:46:20,971
you know they're,
they're,

855
00:46:20,971 --> 00:46:25,530
they're,
they're fighting as much of a 

856
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:27,301
nationalist war as the north is.
And yet when we first put marines on 

857
00:46:27,301 --> 00:46:30,190
shore in 1965,
as you put pointed out in your book,

858
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:34,060
we didn't even tell the south Vietnamese
government we were going to do it.

859
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:39,900
Those are the kinds of things where you 
would have loved to have been a fly on 

860
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,050
the wall in the,
in the meetings about this.

861
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:43,590
Did somebody bring that up and say this 
is going to look really bad if,

862
00:46:43,591 --> 00:46:48,591
if if we spring this on them or was it 
or was the tenor of the times such that 

863
00:46:48,591 --> 00:46:53,401
worrying about what a puppet government.
I guess maybe some people would have 

864
00:46:53,401 --> 00:46:56,710
called it thought about this was was not
on their top 10 list of concerns.

865
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:02,100
You're absolutely right.
One of the things that always struck me 

866
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:05,291
as I also said in the book,
all the hot shot meetings in Washington 

867
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:12,050
about Vietnam policy,
no Vietnamese ever attended any of them.

868
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:17,140
It was always Americans who held the 
meetings to decide what was going to be 

869
00:47:18,081 --> 00:47:21,710
done in Saigon and you find,
and again I have quoted all the examples

870
00:47:21,711 --> 00:47:26,711
were several times when they discussed 
in Washington whether they should change

871
00:47:26,871 --> 00:47:31,380
the Vietnamese government,
but when president two and 1970,

872
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:32,940
74,
I'm sorry,

873
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:38,190
73 look like refusing to sign the peace 
deal that Henry Kissinger and stitched 

874
00:47:38,711 --> 00:47:41,200
up.
I'm in Paris with the North Vietnamese.

875
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:45,730
There was a serious discussion in 
Washington about whether to just get rid

876
00:47:45,731 --> 00:47:48,220
of president to input in another 
Vietnamese president.

877
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,880
Well,
it's not too surprising that the 

878
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:53,880
Vietnamese feel humiliated.
I mean,

879
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,201
all human relations about who makes her 
feel good and Americans did not make,

880
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:00,220
um,
Vietnamese feel good.

881
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,440
And I say this is not unique to 
Americans.

882
00:48:02,441 --> 00:48:07,441
I mean,
I've seen it myself in Afghanistan with 

883
00:48:07,441 --> 00:48:07,890
British troops and Salma,
um,

884
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:13,230
unless you can,
although I don't particularly like that 

885
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:13,230
phrase,
hearts and minds,

886
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:18,100
unless you can make and help other 
nations to have self respect and to feel

887
00:48:18,101 --> 00:48:20,290
good about themselves.
Well,

888
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:22,510
it's always going to be already a tough 
row to hoe.

889
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:27,780
But one thing I do want to say,
which I've also tried to get into my 

890
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,901
book.
I do think that Americans today are 

891
00:48:30,901 --> 00:48:32,350
sometimes almost floods and atria and 
their approach to the war.

892
00:48:32,351 --> 00:48:33,100
Oh God.
Oh God.

893
00:48:33,101 --> 00:48:35,050
We were so wicked.
Well,

894
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:37,780
although there's no doubt the war was a 
disaster.

895
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:43,680
A lot of Americans,
some of whom I've interviewed for the 

896
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,190
book went to Vietnam where the highest 
ideals of service,

897
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:50,110
both some soldiers and some civilians.
I've been hugely moved by.

898
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:52,030
Some of the Americans I interviewed for 
the book.

899
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:56,680
They really cared some of the civilians,
especially the language.

900
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,920
They completely threw themselves into 
the whole thing and they weren't sort of

901
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:07,950
wicked imperialists who wanted to do 
terrible things that they were people 

902
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:13,020
who really wanted to do good deeds and a
wicked world and I think that a lot of 

903
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:18,721
the histories of the war don't pay 
sufficient tribute to some of these 

904
00:49:18,721 --> 00:49:18,721
people.
I mean,

905
00:49:18,721 --> 00:49:21,040
one guy who made an enormous impression 
on me,

906
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:26,520
I was done on the west coast.
I'm interviewing Vietnamese and I heard 

907
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,480
about a guy called Dave Ramsey who might
heard about it,

908
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:32,890
but I never had no idea.
He was still alive and I was told he was

909
00:49:32,891 --> 00:49:37,891
still alive and living in boulder city.
Nevada and I looked at the map and it 

910
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:41,740
was more than 300 miles driving my car 
over from the west coast,

911
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,580
the boulder city.

912
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:47,580
But I just thought I may be able to go 
and see this guy and I got the car and 

913
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:52,310
it's a hell of a long drive across the 
desert and I got to build a city on.

914
00:49:52,311 --> 00:49:57,311
There was Doug Ramsey and I spent four 
hours with him and it was an amazing 

915
00:49:57,311 --> 00:50:00,250
business because Doug Ramsey was a 
foreign service officer,

916
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:05,080
a really outstanding American who I'm in
1962.

917
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:10,320
He made up his mind,
he wants you to go and serve in Vietnam 

918
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:14,370
and was involved in pacification 
programs or systems for time to John 

919
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,610
Paul Vann the,
um,

920
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:19,870
the very famous American advisor out 
there.

921
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:24,910
And Doug Ramsey passionately cared about
the Vietnamese.

922
00:50:24,911 --> 00:50:27,010
He learned.
He learned Vietnamese.

923
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:27,860
Um,
he,

924
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:30,560
he wrote a lot of stuff for some of his 
letters home,

925
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:32,300
which you gave me were huge,
hugely moving.

926
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:37,810
But then beginning of 66,
he was driving a truck with a load of 

927
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:41,360
rise up to some village and he got out 
Bush by the Viet Cong and captured on.

928
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,600
He spent the next seven years,
not in the Hilton,

929
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:49,330
but in a bamboo cage in the jungle.
Seven years you have malaria,

930
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:54,350
123 times he had every kind of other 
tropical disease are you survive?

931
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:59,300
God only knows.
And yet he came out of this experience,

932
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:02,660
um,
is health absolutely destroyed.

933
00:51:02,661 --> 00:51:03,470
I mean,
when I saw him,

934
00:51:03,471 --> 00:51:08,471
he could hardly move his body at all,
but his mind was still right on and he 

935
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:13,691
taught so moving live because even 
though he'd suffered so terribly at the 

936
00:51:13,691 --> 00:51:15,270
hands of the Communist,
um,

937
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:20,530
that he was completely even handed in 
seeing the good stuff and the bad stuff 

938
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:24,101
about.
And he knew the Viet Cong having been a 

939
00:51:24,101 --> 00:51:24,101
prisoner for seven years,
better than almost anybody else.

940
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,330
I mean,
he taught me some very funny stories.

941
00:51:26,331 --> 00:51:31,331
I mean,
one of them that always stuck in my 

942
00:51:31,331 --> 00:51:31,331
mind.
Um,

943
00:51:31,331 --> 00:51:34,000
you said one day when he was being 
interviewed by his interrogators and he 

944
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,711
told them that he thought that the 
Americans were in Vietnam 10 percent to 

945
00:51:38,711 --> 00:51:43,231
help the Vietnamese people are 90 
percent to hold back the Chinese and 

946
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,231
artsy tongue.

947
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:46,700
And he said the communist interrogator 
applied.

948
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:52,090
In that case,
why do you not go and fight him in 

949
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:52,090
China?
We do not like the Chinese either.

950
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:55,220
Um,
another story he told,

951
00:51:55,221 --> 00:52:00,221
which was sort of somehow the subject of
Tom Hayden came into conversation.

952
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:05,690
Jane Fonda's,
a husband who are of course fall in love

953
00:52:05,691 --> 00:52:08,220
with Oge men and Koa and spent half his 
time in,

954
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,570
up in north Vietnam telling you the 
North Vietnamese are wonderful.

955
00:52:11,571 --> 00:52:15,830
They were.
And when Tom Haynes name was mentioned,

956
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,240
uh,
uh,

957
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:19,920
Doug Ramsey,
he asked his interrogators these.

958
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:20,540
He said,
well,

959
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:22,670
what do you think of Tom Hayden?
And they said,

960
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,430
we think his ideology is excellent,
was a man,

961
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:29,150
we despise him.
How could you respect to manual?

962
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:31,130
But Tracy's own country like that,

963
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:39,410
alluded to it with the,
as you said,

964
00:52:39,411 --> 00:52:42,530
these soldiers who went in here for such
idealistic reasons.

965
00:52:42,531 --> 00:52:43,610
I mean,
you quoted a,

966
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:48,880
uh,
a man named Harry Williams who had 

967
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:48,880
mentioned,
you know,

968
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:49,820
we were doing good.
We were making a real contribution.

969
00:52:49,821 --> 00:52:51,800
We were making things better.
Um,

970
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:57,780
it reminds me because I was sort of the 
younger brother of that baby boom 

971
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:01,991
generation that gets so much heat these 
days and so much flack and yet at the 

972
00:53:01,991 --> 00:53:05,291
same time,
it's hard to not notice that that 

973
00:53:05,291 --> 00:53:07,841
generation is a bunch of younger people 
were extremely idealistic and motivated 

974
00:53:07,841 --> 00:53:09,740
by their idealism.
Some went into the peace corps.

975
00:53:09,741 --> 00:53:10,910
A lot of this,
as you point out,

976
00:53:10,911 --> 00:53:13,940
was in response to John f Kennedy's 
famous sacrifice speech,

977
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:19,150
but some of these people did a similar 
sort of approach and trying to make the 

978
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:23,021
world a better place by doing what you 
mentioned parachuting into Laos and 

979
00:53:23,021 --> 00:53:23,450
trying to,
to,

980
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:28,670
uh,
cut off the Ho Chi Minh trail so that 

981
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:28,670
the people in the south good.
I mean,

982
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:32,840
it's,
it's fascinating to know the word 

983
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,720
watershed moment.
The phrase watershed moment is overused,

984
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,440
but it's hard to not notice the 
difference between 19,

985
00:53:37,441 --> 00:53:42,441
63 United States of America in 1973 
United States of America and not 

986
00:53:43,711 --> 00:53:48,711
attribute a large part of the 
disillusionment and the change in 

987
00:53:48,711 --> 00:53:49,800
attitudes to that war.
Does that seem right?

988
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:57,350
To go back to your question about why do
I think a lot of people make the mistake

989
00:54:01,971 --> 00:54:04,190
when they look back at historical 
events,

990
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,330
but they look at them through a 2018 
prism.

991
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,670
For me,
the only way to ride history is to close

992
00:54:10,671 --> 00:54:13,280
your eyes and try and remember how 
things look to people.

993
00:54:13,281 --> 00:54:17,500
Then on the first thing to be said about
the 19 fifties and sixties,

994
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:22,430
the really was a communist threat,
but worldwide.

995
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,390
Um,
the,

996
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:28,500
um,
the Soviet Union and the Chinese did 

997
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,710
represent deeply unpleasant totalitarian
forces of history.

998
00:54:30,711 --> 00:54:35,711
I'm quite confident will show that the 
United States with absolutely right to 

999
00:54:35,711 --> 00:54:40,210
lead the western nations in resisting.
We were the good guys in the Cold War 

1000
00:54:40,371 --> 00:54:44,330
and I have no doubt about that.
So sometimes when people say,

1001
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:45,890
oh,
well,

1002
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:51,260
they never really was a common thread.
The most certainly was a communist 

1003
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:51,260
threat.
They were very nice to people.

1004
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:56,380
However they did not.
They did get a terrible tangle and into 

1005
00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:00,770
China because there weren't enough 
people in Washington who really 

1006
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:01,610
understood the nuances and understood 
the nuances,

1007
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:06,620
the nationalism.
And one of the things I discovered in 

1008
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:09,791
the course of researching the book,
which I had no idea about the Chinese 

1009
00:55:09,791 --> 00:55:12,850
and the Russians fall from being I'm 
enthusiastic about the Vietnam war,

1010
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:16,940
hated the whole business because they 
were having to throw shed loads of money

1011
00:55:16,941 --> 00:55:18,710
and resources of weapons.
I mean,

1012
00:55:18,711 --> 00:55:23,711
the Russians were giving the north 
Vietnamese half a billion dollars a 

1013
00:55:23,711 --> 00:55:23,711
year,
which they could afford,

1014
00:55:23,711 --> 00:55:25,640
but they felt because they,
the Chinese,

1015
00:55:25,641 --> 00:55:27,470
the Russians for competing for 
leadership,

1016
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:31,720
all the socialist world,
they had to go on backing this war.

1017
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:36,970
But our intelligence,
Western intelligence was so bad that 

1018
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:39,380
nobody had the inkling of the so that 
right through to Nixon and Kissinger,

1019
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:43,660
they still believed in the early 
seventies that all our actions had to do

1020
00:55:43,661 --> 00:55:46,130
is pick up the phone to talk to,
um,

1021
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,390
I know I,
and,

1022
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:50,150
um,
the north Vietnamese and make a deal.

1023
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:55,390
And it wasn't like that at all.
That I've quoted Brezhnev when he was 

1024
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:58,340
leader Russia saying to the Russian 
ambassador in Washington,

1025
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,300
I have no desire to drown in the swamps 
of Vietnam.

1026
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:06,800
And he felt himself almost as much a 
prisoner of all this stuff as,

1027
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:08,780
um,
as the American step.

1028
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:14,080
He hated it,
but they were all stuck in this 

1029
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:14,080
situation.
The other thing too,

1030
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,830
which I saw the tail end of when I was 
living here in the sixties,

1031
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:21,890
was that America after the Second World 
War and had achieved such awesome 

1032
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:25,450
success.
I was so powerful and so rich,

1033
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:30,780
but it seemed to that generation of 
Americans that nothing was impossible 

1034
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,940
and no presidents on this very much 
applied to Lbj,

1035
00:56:33,941 --> 00:56:38,941
but also to Kennedy.
None of them wanted to be the ones to 

1036
00:56:38,941 --> 00:56:42,271
tell the American people that before 
might of the United States couldn't see 

1037
00:56:42,271 --> 00:56:44,050
often load a raggedy ass communist 
guerrillas.

1038
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:49,590
And there's a very good phrase of 
Kennedy's that made a great impression 

1039
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:49,590
on me.
I mean,

1040
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:51,100
I often hear people say,
and I don't believe it,

1041
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:54,040
but if Kennedy had lived either God 
America out of Vietnam,

1042
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:58,360
Kennedy told Jay k galbraith is key.
An economic advisor,

1043
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,850
um,
a few weeks before he was killed,

1044
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:05,340
he said they're only just so many 
concessions I can make to the communists

1045
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:08,350
in any one year.
And asked the American people to reelect

1046
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:13,351
me and American expectations,
the belief among the American people,

1047
00:57:14,981 --> 00:57:18,010
and certainly in American government 
that if America wanted something,

1048
00:57:18,011 --> 00:57:20,590
it must be doable.
This was very strong,

1049
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:23,170
but of course,
as you so rightly said,

1050
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:28,810
Vietnam went forward to destroying this.
And one of my heroes in this book,

1051
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:33,850
or boomer,
a marine officer who might spend a lot 

1052
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:34,210
of time with and admired enormously 
won't boomer,

1053
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,040
um,
said,

1054
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:37,330
um,
said to me,

1055
00:57:37,331 --> 00:57:40,300
he said,
nothing you said in my lifetime,

1056
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:43,390
uh,
has changed America more than Vietnam.

1057
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:48,391
He said it created a mistrust and 
suspicion of government and of the 

1058
00:57:49,271 --> 00:57:52,330
people in charge that we've never been 
able to undo.

1059
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:54,340
And I think he's right about that,
don't you?

1060
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:57,810
I think that's maybe one of the most 
persistent things in the war,

1061
00:57:57,811 --> 00:58:02,811
that credibility gap.
And it's hard to describe to Americans 

1062
00:58:02,811 --> 00:58:03,560
now how,
as you pointed out in your book,

1063
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:07,040
Americans would believe their president 
most of the time,

1064
00:58:07,041 --> 00:58:11,540
regardless of which he even was.
And it's never been the same.

1065
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:13,040
The other thing,
as you point out,

1066
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:15,770
and as everyone knows,
but it's not talked about enough that it

1067
00:58:15,771 --> 00:58:20,771
changed,
is it sort of because it was the second 

1068
00:58:20,771 --> 00:58:22,760
major time,
it sort of codified the change,

1069
00:58:22,761 --> 00:58:27,110
the unspoken change in the US 
constitutional system where we no longer

1070
00:58:27,111 --> 00:58:32,111
declared war.
You could describe Korea as an outlier 

1071
00:58:32,111 --> 00:58:36,040
if it was once upon a time,
but Vietnam becomes the time where we 

1072
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,250
sort of codified this and I was 
interested very much in,

1073
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:42,520
in how you pointed out that the,
the legal advisor to the president was 

1074
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:42,520
explaining,
you know,

1075
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,240
how you could get around having to 
declare a war.

1076
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:46,190
Um,
I was also very interested in the,

1077
00:58:46,191 --> 00:58:51,191
in the Munich question.
It was fascinating to me how this 

1078
00:58:51,191 --> 00:58:53,870
specter of appeasement and Munich was 
sort of hanging over the decision making

1079
00:58:53,871 --> 00:58:58,871
process and how it played into the 
domestic politics and how it could 

1080
00:58:58,871 --> 00:59:01,040
almost be used if you,
if you compare it to a schoolyard brawl,

1081
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,800
one side,
calling the other a coward and demanding

1082
00:59:03,801 --> 00:59:08,801
they move.
Even if moving wasn't the right 

1083
00:59:08,801 --> 00:59:08,801
political choice.
Um,

1084
00:59:08,801 --> 00:59:13,090
we still have the whole Munich 
appeasement cudgel at work in today's 

1085
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:17,471
modern American politics.
Can you talk about that and the 

1086
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:17,471
credibility gap a little bit?

1087
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:20,920
What was a big scene to be weak?
But it's,

1088
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,160
it's very difficult.
I mean,

1089
00:59:22,161 --> 00:59:24,260
I think one of the things I find as I 
get older,

1090
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:29,680
and I hope that one is a different 
person from what I was when I was a 

1091
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,120
young reporter.
I meant to tell you a terrible story.

1092
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:37,610
Um,
I grew up in a household in which all 

1093
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:40,391
the men in the house,
including my father banged on and on 

1094
00:59:40,391 --> 00:59:40,700
about what a wonderful time they'd had 
in world war two.

1095
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:46,090
And I grew up believing with 
extraordinary neighbor to the wars were 

1096
00:59:46,191 --> 00:59:51,191
great adventures and um,
I started out that way and I did the 

1097
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:57,750
parachutes with our own,
our own people and all the restaurant 

1098
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:00,340
when I was 17.
And I really thought that this was all 

1099
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:03,290
terrific romantic stuff.
And really my whole life as a writer has

1100
01:00:03,291 --> 01:00:06,590
been a sort of journey of discovering 
the walls are like that.

1101
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:11,650
That was a very serious stuff.
And there's a great phrase which I 

1102
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:14,270
sometimes quote to student audiences,
but,

1103
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:19,690
um,
I suppose the lesson it's taken me 50 

1104
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:22,241
years to learn was quoted by Norwegian 
Resistance Shero called knute constant 

1105
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,790
knute Hanson,
um,

1106
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:26,870
after doing wonderful things with world 
war two.

1107
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:30,920
You raised memoirs in 1948.
And in his book he wrote,

1108
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,670
although was bringing adventures that 
stirred the heart,

1109
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:40,060
the true nature of war is composed of 
innumerable personal tragedies and 

1110
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:43,520
sacrifices.
Wholly evil are not redeemed by glory.

1111
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:49,300
Now he,
I think he's absolutely right about 

1112
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:49,300
that.
And I find in my books these days,

1113
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:51,890
I write far more about victims that I do
about soldiers.

1114
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:57,220
But I think one of the things,
there are many things that you do learn 

1115
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:00,461
to have a,
a sort of respect for the dilemmas 

1116
01:01:00,461 --> 01:01:03,671
facing governments.
That it's very difficult for all 

1117
01:01:03,671 --> 01:01:05,990
governments at all times to decide when 
to be strong and when to give way.

1118
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:10,770
And it's,
it used to seem so easy to just send the

1119
01:01:10,771 --> 01:01:14,900
hundred and first airborne all the US 
Marine Corps to sort out your problems.

1120
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,150
What are,
we know it's not that simple,

1121
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:22,760
but in the end if you can't sort out the
cultural issues in these countries,

1122
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:26,870
the hundred and first airborne,
all the US Marine Corps can't solve them

1123
01:01:26,871 --> 01:01:30,740
for you any more than our own army camp 
and up.

1124
01:01:30,741 --> 01:01:33,900
But I think if one looks at history one 
see moments,

1125
01:01:33,901 --> 01:01:38,901
I mean we can all.
We all see now that Kennedy was both 

1126
01:01:38,901 --> 01:01:42,791
courageous and bold at the time of the,
of the Cuban missile crisis,

1127
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:48,170
which could have gone horribly wrong,
but sometimes when presidents.

1128
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:53,500
I'm in Lyndon Johnson,
terribly wanted to be seen to be 

1129
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,070
courageous and to be doing the right 
thing as the leader of the United States

1130
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:58,850
by sending in troops to Vietnam.
But of course you've got it wrong,

1131
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:00,590
but I,
I.

1132
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:03,590
What I'd like to feel is that through my
own narratives,

1133
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:09,310
one is all the time trying to realize 
that governments are trying to do very 

1134
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:12,491
difficult things.
I don't just mean in the United States 

1135
01:02:12,491 --> 01:02:15,071
government in the context of Vietnam,
but most governments most of the time 

1136
01:02:15,071 --> 01:02:16,220
and the same way for military 
commanders.

1137
01:02:16,221 --> 01:02:21,221
I mean,
I've seen enough wars myself as a 

1138
01:02:21,221 --> 01:02:21,221
reporter,
I'm one scene,

1139
01:02:21,221 --> 01:02:22,500
the not terrible things on the 
battlefield,

1140
01:02:22,501 --> 01:02:24,980
but it is very difficult to,
uh,

1141
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:30,000
to fight wars.
It is not as my father and his friends 

1142
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,000
used to say,
oh,

1143
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,940
it's all a great wrong.
Um,

1144
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:33,330
it's very tough out there on the 
battlefield and,

1145
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:36,090
and I've,
I find that at the age of 72,

1146
01:02:36,091 --> 01:02:41,091
I have a huge sympathy with the people 
who make the decisions that I didn't 

1147
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:42,390
have a when I was a stupid young kid.

1148
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:50,170
Everyone involved in the decision making
process of moving from a,

1149
01:02:51,361 --> 01:02:56,361
a,
a more passive advisor role to putting 

1150
01:02:56,361 --> 01:02:56,361
troops on the ground.
I'm going to quote you here.

1151
01:02:56,361 --> 01:03:01,190
You wrote quote,
none doubted that the war would be long 

1152
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:02,670
and the cost immense quite unlike,
for instance,

1153
01:03:02,671 --> 01:03:07,671
to 2002 decision to invade Iraq in 1965,
every hazard was anticipated.

1154
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:10,980
I not only found that an interesting 
line,

1155
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:14,520
I found that to be a new piece of 
information for me.

1156
01:03:14,521 --> 01:03:16,410
And I've read quite a few books on 
Vietnam,

1157
01:03:16,411 --> 01:03:17,900
but it's been a while.
And,

1158
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:21,690
and that was something that I think 
changed my paradigm a little.

1159
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:26,940
Um,
can you explain that because it is 

1160
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:26,940
interesting to think you would commit 
eventually half a million troops and,

1161
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:31,970
and yet understand how it might not even
be winnable and understand how tough 

1162
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:33,840
it's going to be a and not understand,
as you said,

1163
01:03:33,841 --> 01:03:36,930
the difference between Asian communism 
and Soviet communism.

1164
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,380
Um,
can you talk about that a little bit?

1165
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:47,290
Not in the Johnson White House State 
Department is Memoranda on the things 

1166
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:53,470
you said in conversations with the White
House,

1167
01:03:53,471 --> 01:03:58,471
with the president.
He wound all along as in thethe does 

1168
01:03:58,471 --> 01:03:58,960
some of the generals,
uh,

1169
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:02,320
that they didn't think that a jungle war
in,

1170
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:07,530
in the swamps of the mountains of 
Vietnam was going to be the kind that 

1171
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:08,900
suited the US army.
Um,

1172
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,230
I'm,
I'm,

1173
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:15,400
one of the problems I'm afraid we're 
already prone to is that we can be 

1174
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:19,621
terribly impressed by how my trn forces 
look that if you see I'm a US carrier 

1175
01:04:20,891 --> 01:04:25,891
group at sea and if you see a always 
terrific on jets taking off from the 

1176
01:04:25,891 --> 01:04:30,690
flight decks and if you see your,
your marines storming through the surf,

1177
01:04:30,761 --> 01:04:35,761
and so they all look so impressive that 
you can't believe anything can stand up 

1178
01:04:35,761 --> 01:04:36,670
to them,
but the word people,

1179
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:42,030
smart people in positions of influence 
in the sixties who did clearly identify 

1180
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:47,700
the fact that this was going to be very 
tough and that kind of war in the jungle

1181
01:04:48,341 --> 01:04:51,010
against guerrillas might well not suit 
Americans.

1182
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,830
I'm part of it.
One of the things a lot of people George

1183
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:55,960
Ball said very smartly,
he said,

1184
01:04:55,961 --> 01:04:56,710
Mr.
President,

1185
01:04:57,070 --> 01:04:59,080
if I thought this could be done in a 
year.

1186
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:00,850
He said,
I went back through all the way,

1187
01:05:00,851 --> 01:05:02,740
but he said,
I think it's going to take much longer,

1188
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:06,370
and I do not believe that the American 
people will have the patients for a long

1189
01:05:06,371 --> 01:05:11,371
walk.
And one of the key things is 

1190
01:05:11,371 --> 01:05:13,620
democracies.
Light was to be over quick and I always 

1191
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:15,930
say it's sort of half amuses me that 
Mike,

1192
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:18,350
the last job I did a as a war 
correspondent,

1193
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:23,460
I reported the British Falklands War and
no to the British love the Falklands War

1194
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:29,080
because we had an incredibly incompetent
enemy in the eyes and tight army and it 

1195
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,560
was all over very quickly and we won.
Um,

1196
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,160
and that's the sort of war everybody 
wants,

1197
01:05:33,161 --> 01:05:35,470
but unfortunately it's not the kind of 
war you will get.

1198
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,350
Um,
but now I am impressed,

1199
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:43,351
but the number of smart people,
some of them in uniform who clearly saw 

1200
01:05:43,351 --> 01:05:44,230
but,
but one of the problems facing chiefs of

1201
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:49,231
staff and that was true now and that if 
your a political leader,

1202
01:05:49,511 --> 01:05:53,140
your president or prime minister says,
can you do this?

1203
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:56,870
Well,
senior generals and admirals and an Ama,

1204
01:05:57,130 --> 01:06:00,850
they know they've got to justify this 
stupendous costs of the armed forces.

1205
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:05,650
And you've got to be quite a brave man 
to tell your head of state or your,

1206
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,880
your chief executive,
um,

1207
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:11,110
that your forces can't do this or that.
I'm in.

1208
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:16,170
I remember being amused.
I'm a 2002 just before the invasion of 

1209
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:20,941
Iraq and I was friendly with our then 
head of the army and I met him one day 

1210
01:06:20,941 --> 01:06:22,720
when you just come back from.
I'm from Washington,

1211
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:25,540
we've been at a planning meeting for the
invasion of Iraq.

1212
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:27,820
And I said,
well,

1213
01:06:27,821 --> 01:06:29,740
what do you make of?
And he said,

1214
01:06:29,741 --> 01:06:34,741
well,
he said getting into Baghdad it's going 

1215
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:36,440
to be dead easy.
But he said that in the slightest idea 

1216
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:36,440
what they're going to do when they get 
that.

1217
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:38,830
Um,
but at that time,

1218
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:40,990
um,
that to um,

1219
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:41,980
the,
um,

1220
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:47,080
the,
the people making the decisions in 

1221
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:47,080
Washington didn't seem too much of a 
problem.

1222
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,780
But I'm the worst smart people back in 
64,

1223
01:06:49,781 --> 01:06:53,980
65 who did see that this was going to be
a very tough road to hoe.

1224
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:55,900
Um,
but so,

1225
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:59,530
but the people to be,
I don't know,

1226
01:06:59,531 --> 01:07:04,531
again,
was always mixed up between horror at 

1227
01:07:04,531 --> 01:07:07,120
some of the stupid people who did bad 
things both in uniform and out of it.

1228
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:09,750
And also admiration.
Again,

1229
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:15,240
I'm in some of the soldiers and some of 
the Marines on some of the abstinence 

1230
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,590
song within the framework of a disaster.

1231
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:22,890
They did very fine things and I find 
myself still admiring hugely what they 

1232
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:24,730
achieved.
An alright.

1233
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,650
You may say you're going to be a,
you say,

1234
01:07:26,651 --> 01:07:27,730
well,
it was all for nothing.

1235
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:31,160
But mind you,
I have to say one story that sticks very

1236
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:36,170
much in my mind.
One of the most impressive people I 

1237
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:39,151
interviewed was a former corpsman,
a medic with the infantry guy called 

1238
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:44,221
David Rogers.
I'm a David Rogers described being very 

1239
01:07:44,221 --> 01:07:48,241
movingly.
His experiences with his platoon of who 

1240
01:07:48,241 --> 01:07:52,381
we said about a third were killed or 
wounded up north of Saigon in about 69 

1241
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,840
70.
And um,

1242
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:56,560
he said,
I mean,

1243
01:07:56,561 --> 01:08:00,730
he was very emotionally affected by the 
war and remain so.

1244
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:04,270
But he said,
I'm in 1993.

1245
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:09,870
He was one of those who have the 
Vietnamese invited back as a guest to 

1246
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:14,821
come and visit the country again.
And he went as a reporter and he said 

1247
01:08:14,821 --> 01:08:19,180
they took him to the area where he'd 
fought with his unit and he said all the

1248
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:20,600
Viet Cong embraced him,
um,

1249
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:25,810
because they rolled under strict orders 
to be incredibly nice to Americans 

1250
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:26,720
because they wanted Congress to pass a 
trade deal on.

1251
01:08:26,721 --> 01:08:29,360
David Rogers said to me what I had to 
Redo a couple of years ago.

1252
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:34,660
He said I couldn't help thinking they've
all these guys while he was a 

1253
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:37,800
Mcdonald's,
couldn't we have sorted this out a long 

1254
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:37,800
time ago?

1255
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:42,520
Johnson was offering if they would just 
stop infiltrating the south.

1256
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,750
Let me ask you something that's a little
close to home.

1257
01:08:45,751 --> 01:08:50,751
Maybe I want to talk about the media 
coverage because this proverbially the 

1258
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:53,490
war that was lost in America's living 
rooms and all that kind of stuff.

1259
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,460
I've found some of the things you said 
very interesting.

1260
01:08:56,461 --> 01:08:57,180
I mean,
for example,

1261
01:08:57,181 --> 01:08:59,460
you brought up a point that had never 
occurred to me.

1262
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,110
I'm quoting here,
I think,

1263
01:09:01,111 --> 01:09:02,630
or close to it that,
um,

1264
01:09:02,670 --> 01:09:07,670
that Vietnam war era reporters enjoyed a
notable advantage over most of their 

1265
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:12,141
successors in the 21st century because 
they themselves at often served in 

1266
01:09:12,141 --> 01:09:15,330
uniform and we're familiar with weapons 
and military ways.

1267
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:16,520
Sure.

1268
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:17,050
Uh,
and,

1269
01:09:17,051 --> 01:09:22,051
and the other thing that I found 
interesting was when you talked about 

1270
01:09:22,051 --> 01:09:25,380
the line that some Americans went to 
their graves believing that reporters 

1271
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:29,581
betrayed their country while winning 
applaudance from the media counterparts 

1272
01:09:29,581 --> 01:09:30,590
around the world.
Um,

1273
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:32,440
can you talk a little bit about media 
coverage?

1274
01:09:32,441 --> 01:09:33,160
I mean,
for example,

1275
01:09:33,161 --> 01:09:35,650
I don't think we've seen because before 
that war,

1276
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:38,560
the war coverage was very censored,
world war type stuff.

1277
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:41,950
And yet somehow after that war,
they've toned down.

1278
01:09:41,951 --> 01:09:46,951
I mean,
now we have embedded reporters who are 

1279
01:09:46,951 --> 01:09:46,951
essentially working with the 
governments.

1280
01:09:46,951 --> 01:09:49,630
I don't think we've ever seen the kind 
of freedom to show news the way they did

1281
01:09:49,631 --> 01:09:54,631
in that war.
And do you think that was a good thing 

1282
01:09:54,631 --> 01:09:57,511
or a bad thing?
And do you think the reporters at the 

1283
01:09:57,511 --> 01:09:57,511
time did a good enough job pointing out 
what you mentioned,

1284
01:09:57,511 --> 01:10:01,180
the other side's transgressions and 
atrocities and everything so that things

1285
01:10:01,181 --> 01:10:02,350
would be equal a little bit

1286
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:09,360
in the introduction to my book,
think many of the reporters who served 

1287
01:10:09,701 --> 01:10:14,701
in Vietnam did not standing job of 
reporting entirely accurately what they 

1288
01:10:14,701 --> 01:10:19,321
themselves saw and knew where they 
failed was because it was so much going 

1289
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:21,880
on on the other side that they had no 
access to,

1290
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:27,410
but I'm an incredibly bad stuff,
but the other side was doing never got 

1291
01:10:27,911 --> 01:10:32,911
any sort of show and I quite understand 
in a very small way I was party to it 

1292
01:10:32,911 --> 01:10:37,381
myself because you know,
when I was reporting for BBC and 

1293
01:10:37,381 --> 01:10:41,260
newspapers in the early seventies and 
all the time you were seeing shocking 

1294
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:46,201
stuff been going on all around you and 
you were witness to the corruption on 

1295
01:10:46,201 --> 01:10:47,590
the incompetence of the South Vietnamese
government.

1296
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:53,110
But we just didn't pay enough attention 
to this stuff we couldn't see and the 

1297
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:58,200
United States.
Whereas it was absolutely true that 

1298
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:58,700
there was a huge credibility gap because
a lot of the stuff that was a,

1299
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:01,330
we were told that briefings and solve 
with absolute garbage,

1300
01:11:01,610 --> 01:11:03,430
um,
but the numbers,

1301
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,900
all this stuff up,
body counts and so on.

1302
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,210
The frightful lies were told in fact,
boomer,

1303
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:14,220
the General Marine Corps general.
And he said to me that one of the 

1304
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:14,790
lessons he brought home from three tours
in Vietnam was telling the truth.

1305
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:20,360
But the curious thing that the sort of 
contradiction on the one hand a lot of 

1306
01:11:21,070 --> 01:11:25,320
senior Americans did not tell the truth 
to the world about what was happening.

1307
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:31,120
But on the other hand,
America dippers have a commitment that 

1308
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,450
was very honorable to let us see for 
ourselves.

1309
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:37,260
So that in a way that's never been 
repeated in any war sense.

1310
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:42,710
That if any of us,
I'm sort of didn't believe what we were 

1311
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:45,651
being told about.
Some bell going off in the middle of 

1312
01:11:45,651 --> 01:11:48,200
nowhere.
We could get access on me as a British 

1313
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:51,351
journalist,
as much as anybody on fixed wing 

1314
01:11:51,351 --> 01:11:53,871
aircraft and helicopters to go there and
look for ourselves and the Communists 

1315
01:11:53,871 --> 01:11:57,480
would never let anybody but Jane Fonda 
go up and see what the hell was going on

1316
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:58,680
in that neck of the woods.

1317
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,460
Um,
and I do not believe that the business,

1318
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:06,330
the media lost the war,
but I certainly do believe that,

1319
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:11,940
uh,
the way the war was covered up made it 

1320
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:13,070
more difficult for the United States.
But,

1321
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,280
um,
I mean a point,

1322
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:19,370
my father was a war correspondent in 
world war two and I once said to him 

1323
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:21,610
that having been reading some of his 
wartime dispatchers,

1324
01:12:21,611 --> 01:12:26,611
they seem to be pretty gung Ho.
And he said what we were doing as part 

1325
01:12:26,611 --> 01:12:26,611
of the war effort.
Now,

1326
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:31,640
of course,
nearly all the senior officers who were 

1327
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:31,640
in Vietnam,
American senior officers,

1328
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:36,140
they'd been in world war two and they 
were accustomed to dealing with the 

1329
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:39,111
media that would play the game.
I'm in what was seen to be in the 

1330
01:12:39,111 --> 01:12:39,870
national interest.
They wouldn't break ranks.

1331
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:44,370
And now suddenly in Vietnam they find 
that you've got a whole lot of reporters

1332
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:49,200
refused to accept that I'm telling the 
story the way that Mac v is,

1333
01:12:49,210 --> 01:12:51,890
they've always known of one of the toll 
was,

1334
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:56,990
was not going to happen,
and they found it very difficult to 

1335
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:56,990
adjust to this.

1336
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:58,920
Um,
and I think what is also fair,

1337
01:12:58,921 --> 01:13:03,921
but some John,
this I think it would be dishonest 

1338
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:03,921
about.
I mean I was taking apart the television

1339
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:08,841
discussion a year or so ago with a group
of former war correspondents,

1340
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:14,360
including some Americans.
And I said they were talking about their

1341
01:13:14,491 --> 01:13:18,000
commitment to tell the truth and tell 
the world what was going on.

1342
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:21,780
And I said,
shouldn't we also met that when you're,

1343
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,900
when you're as young as we all were and 
so on.

1344
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:27,150
It was a great adventure.
And we had the time of our lives in many

1345
01:13:27,151 --> 01:13:29,030
ways.
We were all responsible kids.

1346
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:34,370
Well,
none of the others would admit that at 

1347
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:34,370
all.
In fact,

1348
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:34,370
they got very angry with me for saying 
that.

1349
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:38,780
But I'm afraid the were in Vietnam.
A lot of the journalists were frankly,

1350
01:13:38,971 --> 01:13:41,520
what I would call war tourists.
Um,

1351
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:46,940
there was some brilliant,
serious minded super people like Neil 

1352
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:46,940
CNN,
David Halberstam,

1353
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:51,821
and so,
so there were some very fine 

1354
01:13:51,821 --> 01:13:51,821
correspondence,
but I'm in,

1355
01:13:51,821 --> 01:13:53,850
it was a great life.
There were unlimited girls drugs,

1356
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:57,270
delicious food,
beautiful country and all rest of it.

1357
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:01,080
Um,
and although some of the media,

1358
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:03,560
how they find this in Vietnam,
um,

1359
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:06,510
I would also say that some of the media 
had the unfinished style,

1360
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:11,440
like the television crew that provided a
knife for a soldier to cut the ears off,

1361
01:14:11,441 --> 01:14:13,780
some dead Viet Cong on camera and that 
sort of stuff.

1362
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,100
So,
um,

1363
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:18,340
the media,
his record in Vietnam was pretty mixed.

1364
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:23,660
Um,
there was some stuff we're proud open 

1365
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:23,660
some stuff,
frankly the same dog

1366
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:32,630
in terms of protests and everything else
because it's interesting as a kid 

1367
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:36,491
growing up in the post Vietnam era,
I just thought that was the new reality 

1368
01:14:36,491 --> 01:14:38,480
that would be expected in future 
conflicts.

1369
01:14:38,481 --> 01:14:41,120
And yet now looking 50 years back on 
things,

1370
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:43,970
if you really,
if you start in the second world war,

1371
01:14:44,210 --> 01:14:48,170
there's very little of that large spike 
in anti war activity.

1372
01:14:48,171 --> 01:14:53,171
I mean,
not only were there no protesters 

1373
01:14:53,171 --> 01:14:53,171
protesting the bombing of Germany and 
Japan,

1374
01:14:53,171 --> 01:14:57,760
but they're really by 1960 standards 
weren't that much after the Vietnam War 

1375
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,841
for any of the conflicts.
What do you think accounts for that 

1376
01:15:01,841 --> 01:15:01,910
being such an outlier situation?

1377
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:06,430
I've suggested in my book,
I remember I was living here in the late

1378
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:08,460
sixties,
so I saw it,

1379
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:14,280
the demonstrations and the whole thing,
but all sorts of stuff got tangled up 

1380
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:18,101
together.
It was the worldwide youth movement 

1381
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:21,781
against the established order on the 
revolt against the old sexual morality 

1382
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:28,300
and the enthusiasm of a part of the and 
all this stuff got rolled up with 

1383
01:15:28,701 --> 01:15:29,790
Vietnam.
Um,

1384
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:35,320
and you've got to remember,
kids in those days were putting posters 

1385
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:38,540
on their college walls or we Tang who,
anybody who knows anything knows was one

1386
01:15:38,541 --> 01:15:41,480
of the great mass murderers of the 20th 
century up there with,

1387
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:43,370
with Hitler.
So,

1388
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:44,430
um,
the walls,

1389
01:15:45,050 --> 01:15:49,150
incredible naivety among the kids.
The kids were right about one thing,

1390
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:54,170
the war was a disaster,
but of course one of the things that 

1391
01:15:54,170 --> 01:15:57,100
drove the protest movement was the fact 
that a lot of them were terrified of 

1392
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:57,140
being drafted,
um,

1393
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:02,300
that they were afraid they were going to
have to waste two years of their lives 

1394
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:03,800
in uniform and maybe lose their lives 
all together.

1395
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:09,220
So I'm mixed up with the principle 
objections to the war and mixed up with 

1396
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:13,040
the whole youth revolt was they felt 
they had skin in the game about,

1397
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:17,960
about the danger to themselves.
And they were,

1398
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:20,060
I mean,
it was an extraordinary time to be here.

1399
01:16:20,061 --> 01:16:22,100
I mean,
some of the stuff that I saw myself,

1400
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:27,540
um,
was you actually felt America was 

1401
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:28,280
falling apart in 1968.
And in fact,

1402
01:16:28,281 --> 01:16:33,281
the fact that it didn't fall apart.
I've never gone to a bank of America 

1403
01:16:33,281 --> 01:16:33,281
ever since.
One's always,

1404
01:16:33,281 --> 01:16:37,961
I always believed passionate this day.
And America is capacity of reinvention 

1405
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:41,890
because I saw what a mess it could get 
itself into it in [inaudible] 68 and 

1406
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:43,880
come out the other side,
but no subsequent war.

1407
01:16:43,881 --> 01:16:48,881
The other thing we must remember,
the whole thing was much smaller and we 

1408
01:16:48,881 --> 01:16:52,371
probably talked too much in this 
conversation about all the battlefields 

1409
01:16:52,371 --> 01:16:54,320
stuff and um,
if you look at casualties,

1410
01:16:54,321 --> 01:16:59,321
I mean I've written about one battle in 
one chapter of my book called Dido that 

1411
01:16:59,321 --> 01:17:03,500
absolute nobody's ever heard of and this
was a three day battle in May,

1412
01:17:03,501 --> 01:17:06,170
19,
68 in which are marine battalion.

1413
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:11,170
It was more or less wiped out,
up near the demilitarized in three days 

1414
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:15,491
of bottling,
which they lost 81 killed and I forget 

1415
01:17:15,491 --> 01:17:18,700
about 250 wounded and they ended up with
one on wounded officer and I'm about 150

1416
01:17:20,631 --> 01:17:25,631
men still fit for combat and nothing 
remotely like that happened in Iraq or 

1417
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:28,880
in Afghanistan.
I mean,

1418
01:17:28,881 --> 01:17:30,600
the scale.
This was a,

1419
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:35,570
a really murderous bloody business in,
in some of the stuff people did and some

1420
01:17:35,571 --> 01:17:37,800
of the stuff people experienced.
Um,

1421
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:39,470
I mean it was,
it was,

1422
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:43,130
it was as bad as well too,
or career at times.

1423
01:17:43,131 --> 01:17:44,000
I mean,
um,

1424
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:48,590
but I don't think.
I don't buy the line that Vietnam is the

1425
01:17:48,591 --> 01:17:51,230
worst world that ever was.
I'm in all wars are pretty ghastly,

1426
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:53,510
but it was a hell of a lot worse,
um,

1427
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:58,870
in the scale of the bloodbath than 
anything remotely in Afghanistan or Iraq

1428
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:04,510
and these are volunteer.
They've been fought by volunteer 

1429
01:18:04,510 --> 01:18:04,510
soldiers

1430
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:12,140
magazine killed that week and sometimes 
the casualty levels could get high 

1431
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:13,470
enough,
a hundreds a week.

1432
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:14,400
Then I would say.

1433
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:20,640
And I was trying to figure out how we 
would react today in the United States 

1434
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:20,640
to casualty.
Well,

1435
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:22,790
and that brings me back to something you
had talked about,

1436
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:26,360
the war being a disaster and then we had
talked about the protesters in the media

1437
01:18:26,361 --> 01:18:28,580
and everything.
It does make me wonder though,

1438
01:18:28,581 --> 01:18:32,810
what is the responsibility if your 
government seems on a course to continue

1439
01:18:32,811 --> 01:18:37,811
doubling down on something that everyone
knows is a disaster in a democratic or 

1440
01:18:37,811 --> 01:18:42,551
republican system.
What is the role of the population in 

1441
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,210
terms of checking a government that,
as you said,

1442
01:18:44,211 --> 01:18:49,211
didn't know what they were getting into 
or didn't know what they were getting 

1443
01:18:49,211 --> 01:18:49,211
into but found no way out of where they 
were going.

1444
01:18:49,211 --> 01:18:53,921
I mean,
could one make the case that it was 

1445
01:18:53,921 --> 01:18:56,471
better to have that kind of pressure on 
the part of the electorate versus what 

1446
01:18:56,471 --> 01:18:57,710
might have happened if that pressure had
not been there?

1447
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:03,140
What I was living in the United States,
I could see a lot of Americans,

1448
01:19:03,961 --> 01:19:06,780
especially in middle America,
Middle America,

1449
01:19:06,781 --> 01:19:10,950
very well in that era in Minnesota and 
Wisconsin.

1450
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:16,730
And you saw very patriotic Americans 
wrestling with the dilemma of,

1451
01:19:16,731 --> 01:19:17,970
well,
loyalty.

1452
01:19:17,971 --> 01:19:22,971
Les,
did you just blindly go on supporting 

1453
01:19:22,971 --> 01:19:22,971
your president or,
or did you not?

1454
01:19:22,971 --> 01:19:25,290
They weren't to kind of go out and 
protest in the streets,

1455
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:30,270
but it's a very difficult issue and I 
think it is right.

1456
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:31,500
Just speak up.
But,

1457
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:36,580
um,
it's never easy to decide where the 

1458
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:39,351
patriotic root lies.
And I remember one of the most moving 

1459
01:19:39,351 --> 01:19:39,351
things that,
that happened to me,

1460
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:44,600
um,
when I was there in 71 and I've been up 

1461
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,070
reporting for BBC of Battle of 
playschool Farber's six up in the,

1462
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:48,390
in the,
you know,

1463
01:19:48,391 --> 01:19:53,391
the border hell of a murderous business.
And we hitched a ride back.

1464
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:55,780
Saigon on a c 1:30.

1465
01:19:55,790 --> 01:19:57,680
That was only one other camera crew,
wally,

1466
01:19:57,710 --> 01:20:02,710
he was so in the cargo hold of this huge
aircraft on down at the end of the plane

1467
01:20:03,450 --> 01:20:06,780
or the opposite.
Then from us was the body bag,

1468
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,860
an American sergeants and advisor,
um,

1469
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:15,000
who have been killed in the battle and 
there's his body bag with all his stuff 

1470
01:20:15,091 --> 01:20:20,091
around him,
his guitar and the sound system on all 

1471
01:20:20,091 --> 01:20:20,091
these kids.
And so on.

1472
01:20:20,091 --> 01:20:24,720
Um,
we had an hour and a half or two hours 

1473
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:25,770
on the plane down to Saigon looking.
I was sort of looking at this,

1474
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:27,890
that poor bastard,
he,

1475
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:29,640
he's an,
he's a body bag and so on.

1476
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:35,060
And I thought we're now in a situation 
where nobody wants to be the last 

1477
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:36,570
American to die in a war that's 
obviously lost.

1478
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:42,140
And I think one of the things that one 
does bitterly reproached Nixon and 

1479
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:44,790
Kissinger for from the moment they 
assumed office in [inaudible] 69.

1480
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:47,190
They knew there was no hope of winning 
the war,

1481
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:49,950
but they were desperate for purely 
political reasons,

1482
01:20:49,951 --> 01:20:54,951
to conceal from the American people 
about the war was lost and 22,000

1483
01:20:55,111 --> 01:21:00,111
Americans died under the Nixon 
presidency and I'm Vietnamese and it was

1484
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:06,140
in many ways the worst period because 
you've got the whole black power thing.

1485
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,700
You've got the army in Vietnam falling 
apart,

1486
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:12,420
a huge drug problems and so on and so 
forth and all this.

1487
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:17,780
They knew all the way down the street.
There was no way they were going to win 

1488
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:21,531
this,
but they were just desperate to avoid 

1489
01:21:21,531 --> 01:21:21,930
anybody finding out about this.
And to me,

1490
01:21:21,931 --> 01:21:26,931
one of the grizzlies bits,
the White House tapes were relatively 

1491
01:21:26,931 --> 01:21:30,141
recently released in 2015 is a kissinger
coming back from the secret Paris peace 

1492
01:21:30,571 --> 01:21:35,571
talks in October 72 and he rushes into 
the of the Oval Office and he says,

1493
01:21:36,110 --> 01:21:37,200
next.
He says,

1494
01:21:37,201 --> 01:21:37,380
Mr.

1495
01:21:37,470 --> 01:21:42,470
President,
we have got a better deal than you have 

1496
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:43,170
ever dreamed on.
And remember,

1497
01:21:43,171 --> 01:21:48,171
this is a month before Nixon faces 
George Mcgovern in the presidential 

1498
01:21:48,171 --> 01:21:52,110
election and Kissinger doesn't say this 
is going to bring peace.

1499
01:21:52,111 --> 01:21:55,680
There's going to save countless lives.
He said this will absolutely,

1500
01:21:55,681 --> 01:22:00,120
totally screwed mcgough and the cynicism
of these guys at this stage,

1501
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:03,520
um,
and it was all about politics and,

1502
01:22:03,521 --> 01:22:05,260
and that's a pretty.
It's,

1503
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:05,930
it's,
it's,

1504
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:07,850
it's hard.
It sticks in your crawl,

1505
01:22:07,851 --> 01:22:10,140
you know.
But actually one thing I would say,

1506
01:22:10,141 --> 01:22:13,230
which I think is important as a sort of 
closing note on this,

1507
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,390
to me,
the supreme irony of the war,

1508
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:18,100
if you go to Vietnam today,
um,

1509
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:21,150
if you'd said to an American and about 
66,

1510
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:23,970
how would you like Saigon to look in 
2018?

1511
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:29,230
We'll actually,
it'd be pretty much the way it looks 

1512
01:22:29,230 --> 01:22:30,831
now.
And although it's still a very 

1513
01:22:30,831 --> 01:22:33,570
unpleasant totalitarian state vet now 
they do now have license to make money.

1514
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:38,570
They want to be Americans.
They're incredibly nice to Americans 

1515
01:22:38,570 --> 01:22:39,360
because they realize that the American 
system is,

1516
01:22:39,730 --> 01:22:44,730
um,
worth countless more valuable and can't 

1517
01:22:44,730 --> 01:22:45,990
this a more valid than their own Richard
government.

1518
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:51,460
Um,
but they're all completely hooked on 

1519
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:55,520
American culture and on making money.
And I've suggested in the last chapter 

1520
01:22:56,131 --> 01:22:59,940
of my book,
the United States failed in Vietnam,

1521
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:05,270
will be 52 years and spooky gunships and
defoliation the united trial.

1522
01:23:06,570 --> 01:23:11,570
I'm with Johnny Depp on Youtube,
but what we've learned is that is the 

1523
01:23:11,801 --> 01:23:16,801
economic forces can be at least as 
important if not more so than than 

1524
01:23:16,801 --> 01:23:18,790
soldiers.
And deciding how history plays out.

1525
01:23:21,450 --> 01:23:25,670
Rock and roll and Playboy magazine.
It'll become American.

1526
01:23:25,870 --> 01:23:27,630
You said it the way

1527
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:33,210
Max.
We've hardly touched upon all the good 

1528
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:33,500
things in this book though,
and I would like to encourage anyone who

1529
01:23:33,501 --> 01:23:38,501
would love to get an updated really 
interesting view of Vietnam from 

1530
01:23:38,501 --> 01:23:42,071
somebody who wasn't just there but has 
had a chance to think and talk and do 

1531
01:23:42,071 --> 01:23:45,401
research about it ever since sir.
Max Hastings and the book is Vietnam a 

1532
01:23:45,401 --> 01:23:45,620
certain Max.
Thank you so much for coming on.

1533
01:23:45,621 --> 01:23:48,930
The program.
Had a great time.

1534
01:23:48,931 --> 01:23:49,410
Hey,
come on.

1535
01:23:49,411 --> 01:23:50,250
The next book.
Okay.

1536
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:52,150
Take care.

1537
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:01,020
Wrath of the cons,
punic nightmares,

1538
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:06,350
Apache tears,
and of course ghosts of the Austin 

1539
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:10,490
Front.
Just a few of the classic hardcore 

1540
01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:10,890
history titles available from Dan Carlin
Dot com.

1541

These favorites.

1542
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,960
Hey,
they make great gifts too.

1543
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:18,680
If you think the show you just heard is 
worth a dollar,

1544
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:23,030
Dan and Ben would love to have it,
but it's all we ask.
