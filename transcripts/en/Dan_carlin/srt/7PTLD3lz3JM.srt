00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,910
It's hardcore history.
When I was designing this hardcore 

7
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:29,541
history denim format,
I knew that we were going to want to do 

8
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:32,271
interviews.
It's a good way for us to get out 

9
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:34,620
content quickly.
That's interesting and that it involves 

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:34,620
other people,
other voices,

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,991
people that you might want to know more 
about and I knew that we would have 

12
00:00:38,991 --> 00:00:43,911
authors on because there's always a lot 
of good people writing intriguing books 

13
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:43,911
because I'm reading them.

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,870
I knew we would want to have experts on 
from time to time because after all it's

15
00:00:48,871 --> 00:00:50,610
a great use of the medium,
isn't it?

16
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,630
And I was hoping that we could get some 
primary source people on from time to 

17
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,900
time participants in the events that we 
were talking about.

18
00:00:57,901 --> 00:00:58,980
In other words,
you know,

19
00:00:58,981 --> 00:01:01,010
I'm not a historian because historians 
chronicle,

20
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,810
you know,
things for history and for footnotes and

21
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:08,811
stuff in books.
But maybe we could do a little bit of 

22
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:10,851
that if we were interviewing people who 
were participants in these sorts of 

23
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:14,961
events.
Will today I have somebody that is sort 

24
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:17,121
of the Trifecta of interviews for this 
program cause he meets all three of 

25
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:19,830
those specifications.
He's an author,

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,310
he's an expert and he's a primary source
and participant.

27
00:01:23,311 --> 00:01:28,311
His name is Merrill Mcpeak.
He happens to be a four star air force 

28
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:31,860
general.
He flew with the thunderbirds,

29
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:36,861
the acrobatic team for the air force.
He is a commander or a chief of staff in

30
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:42,891
the air force and did so during the 
first Gulf War and he flew more than 250

31
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:48,240
combat missions in Vietnam.
Imagine that for a second.

32
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:55,370
He's also a noted author who's got a 
brand new book out to add to his catalog

33
00:01:55,411 --> 00:02:00,411
of books.
His new book is called roles and 

34
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,500
missions,
which goes over his time as the 14th air

35
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:02,970
force chief of staff.
By the way,

36
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,030
sort of a bipartisan guy,
worked for the Bob Dole Republican 

37
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,451
campaign,
also supported and was in the Barack 

38
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,470
Obama administration in terms of it 
military capacity.

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,550
He writes about his time in Vietnam and 
his book called Hangar flying.

40
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,890
He's got another one called below the 
zone,

41
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,820
another one called the Vietnam chapters.
If you like military history,

42
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,960
especially air force history,
Merrill,

43
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,040
Tony Mcpeak is somebody whose books 
should be on your bookshelf.

44
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,670
We talked to the four star general now 
who was nice enough to come and talk 

45
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:34,670
with us.
By the way,

46
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,610
you may have recently seen him in Ken 
Burns,

47
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,530
recent multipart documentary on the 
Vietnam War as well.

48
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,540
Welcome to the show general mcpeak.

49
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,110
First of all,
let's get started by suggesting,

50
00:02:53,111 --> 00:02:53,650
um,
you know,

51
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:58,651
the person we were,
we were contacting your publicist or 

52
00:02:58,651 --> 00:02:58,651
whatever,
uh,

53
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:00,010
was discussing the 50th year,
the Tet offensive.

54
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:01,510
And when I was thinking about how to 
start this,

55
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:02,110
I thought,
you know,

56
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,650
I grew up in that generation where we 
weren't in the war.

57
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:07,990
We were in the early eighties,
middle eighties.

58
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:12,991
We were the ones learning about the war 
in college and the veterans would come 

59
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:15,901
and speak in our classes.
And I remember 60 minutes did a whole 

60
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:17,230
big thing on how here we were studying 
the lessons of Vietnam.

61
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:22,231
And what did we learn?
And I thought now here we are decades 

62
00:03:22,231 --> 00:03:23,620
later and I thought I would ask you 50 
years after the Tet offensive,

63
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,520
what do you think we learned and do you 
think the things we learned,

64
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:29,620
for example,
by the 19 seventies or 19 eighties,

65
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:31,990
do you think those lessons stuck?

66
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,720
Well,
speaking as a professional military guy,

67
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:41,360
we learned a lot.
We learned,

68
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,010
for instance,
just as an air force fighter pilot,

69
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,630
we learned we had to hit what we were 
aiming.

70
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,740
We've missed most of the targets.
I think our average distance of Vietnam 

71
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,381
was like a 100 meters and that's not 
good enough if you're going after a 

72
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,790
target,
like a bridge or a vehicle,

73
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:07,791
like a tank or a truck.
So we invented precision guided 

74
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,890
munitions and you've seen the results 
that we learned.

75
00:04:10,891 --> 00:04:15,891
We had to be able to operate at night 
and we now or nobody wants to fight us 

76
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:22,131
at night nowadays.
They don't want to find the daytime 

77
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:22,131
either,
but we,

78
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:26,890
we re really dominate knife fighting.
Now we've learned that we had to be 

79
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,880
invisible on radar.
So in invented aircraft.

80
00:04:29,881 --> 00:04:31,030
So,
I mean,

81
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,330
from the standpoint of the professional 
military,

82
00:04:33,331 --> 00:04:38,331
we learned a lot and we improved a lot 
because the war lasted so long.

83
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,240
Tenure for all of us got to go there at 
least once.

84
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,270
We all saw what needed to be fixed and 
we fixed it.

85
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:51,130
Now,
if you now ask a what did we learn 

86
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,860
politically or socially,
I think that the,

87
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,510
by and large,
the lessons were not learned at all.

88
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,090
Or if they were,
they were forgotten.

89
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,870
Uh,
we repeat the same mistakes,

90
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,220
you know,
a war after war,

91
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:07,290
it seems to me.
So,

92
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,320
uh,
technically we learned a lot,

93
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,940
but big picture wise,
I think we,

94
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,280
we missed the boat,

95
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:20,070
you know,
I'm thinking about the concept in 

96
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,070
business of like institutional memory,
right?

97
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,700
The idea is that,
you know,

98
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:21,690
you have,
you have the,

99
00:05:21,691 --> 00:05:22,280
uh,
the,

100
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,780
the fact that the people can come and go
in a large corporation,

101
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:26,880
but theoretically when new people come 
in,

102
00:05:26,881 --> 00:05:29,640
they're trained with the lessons learned
by the previous generation.

103
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,490
I'm thinking about institutional memory 
in the military.

104
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:37,491
So if you guys get a guy like William 
Westmoreland who was a second world war 

105
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:37,491
veteran,
knows how to fight,

106
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:42,411
that kind of war,
has to deal with this counterinsurgency 

107
00:05:42,411 --> 00:05:45,680
situation in Vietnam,
theoretically learns what he's going to 

108
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,500
learn there.
But then Westmoreland retires the people

109
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:49,480
who were right below him retire.
It is,

110
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:54,481
is,
is institutional memory in the military 

111
00:05:54,481 --> 00:05:57,471
sphere.
A little like something like a Bush in 

112
00:05:57,471 --> 00:05:59,691
front of your yard that you have to keep
cut back because every generation comes 

113
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:04,211
up,
we have to relearn some of those same 

114
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:04,211
things.

115
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:04,211
Is there,
you know,

116
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:05,090
when you read like the Peloponnesian war
and the stuff from ancient Athens,

117
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:07,800
there's the hubris element.
Is Hubris something that,

118
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,760
that a good punch in the nose can,
can teach you permanently?

119
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:13,850
Or do you need to be reminded every now 
and then?

120
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:18,851
I mean,
I look at the dominance we have right 

121
00:06:18,851 --> 00:06:20,381
now on the battlefield and I worry that 
if we got into a major conflict right 

122
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,460
now,
we don't have anyone in the institutions

123
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,260
at the higher levels now that have 
fought,

124
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,380
for example,
in a real war against another first 

125
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:29,380
world military.
Um,

126
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,420
would they almost have to do like the 
reverse of what Westmoreland had to do,

127
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:37,421
where he had to learn to go from a world
war mentality to a counterinsurgency 

128
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:40,220
mentality mentality if we ever had to 
fight China in some islands off,

129
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,510
you know,
in the east China Sea,

130
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,990
is that relearning a kind of warfare 
that westmoreland understood.

131
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,290
But we haven't done in so long we don't 
know how to do anymore.

132
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,570
I'm sorry,
that's a really long question.

133
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:57,730
Yeah.
But it's a wonderful question because 

134
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:01,430
this,
we're a practice to fight the last war.

135
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,600
I think that's even giving too much 
credit.

136
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:13,310
Look a your question is our military 
organizations learning organizations 

137
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:20,540
that can benefit through experience.
I think they are,

138
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,200
but remember we fought Vietnam with a,
a draft force conscripted army,

139
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:33,910
and it was only after that that Nixon 
was really forced to abandon the draft 

140
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:39,731
and to create the all volunteer force.
The all volunteer force is that 

141
00:07:39,731 --> 00:07:44,450
different kind of army from the army.
And,

142
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:49,590
uh,
I think it's probably true that a 

143
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,840
professional force can be a learning 
organization,

144
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,120
whereas buying large citizen based,
uh,

145
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,630
army,
uh,

146
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,660
are not because they're constantly 
taking in new guys or short term of 

147
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:08,831
service and they have to train them from
the beginning every six months and,

148
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:10,880
but,
uh,

149
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:11,930
but,
but look,

150
00:08:11,931 --> 00:08:13,190
it's a good question.

151
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:18,250
It's a profound question.
It goes back to the Peloponnesian wars 

152
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,870
or before that,
as you say,

153
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,560
and I'm not sure you know,
that I have a total totally good answer 

154
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:32,471
to it.
I know that the army coming out of 

155
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:33,560
Vietnam was not happy with its 
performance.

156
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:39,430
Uh,
Westmoreland Westmoreland's failures in 

157
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,440
particular,
uh,

158
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,580
and guys like Norm Schwarzkopf and Colin
Powell set about rebuilding the culture 

159
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:53,621
of the army and the army we have today,
I think it's considerably better than 

160
00:08:55,351 --> 00:09:00,351
the one we had in Vietnam,
which was guilty of fragging,

161
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:05,391
its own officers and senior NCO and drug
abuse and other forms of,

162
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,980
of disciplined on the front lines.
I don't think you see that kind of army 

163
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,170
anymore.
So you'd have to say,

164
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:17,040
I think that that we did learn from that
experience.

165
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,470
For me,
the larger lessons.

166
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:24,471
So are the policy level less than 
political lessons and there I've seen no

167
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:27,660
evidence that we've learned very much.
I am there.

168
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:32,661
I see that this ancient Greek a problem,
a few breaths to still around,

169
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,630
you know,
in spades

170
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,110
and again,
this may just be one person.

171
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,400
I'm shooting an Arrow and painting a 
bullseye around it afterwards.

172
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:49,401
But it,
it seems to me that there's always this 

173
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:52,011
wonderful out that people who want to do
something like I want to invade Russia 

174
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:53,280
and I'm the,
I'm the Nazi.

175
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,080
Often someone comes up to me and says,
well,

176
00:09:55,081 --> 00:10:00,081
you know,
that didn't work out very well for 

177
00:10:00,081 --> 00:10:01,491
Charles.
The twelfth didn't work out very well 

178
00:10:01,491 --> 00:10:01,491
for Napoleon,
but I want to invade Russia.

179
00:10:01,491 --> 00:10:05,721
So I say yes,
but they didn't have the offer and they 

180
00:10:05,721 --> 00:10:08,871
didn't have the off.
Therefore those historical lessons from 

181
00:10:08,871 --> 00:10:11,661
the past are not applicable and I feel 
like there's a human tendency to do 

182
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:11,661
that.
Even now,

183
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:16,641
for example,
to say if our military today went and 

184
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:17,940
rethought the Vietnam War in the 21st 
century,

185
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:23,330
we could do that and we could win 
because of all this stuff we have that 

186
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:23,460
we didn't have back then.
In other words,

187
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,840
we can go into Afghanistan and it won't 
be the graveyard of empires because they

188
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:30,030
didn't have smart bombs in those old 
days.

189
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:35,250
Um,
do you think that there's any validity 

190
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:35,250
to that way of thinking?
Is that a little bit of a,

191
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,740
of a human nature sort of thing?
Or is there something you can do 

192
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:39,740
institutionally that says,
listen,

193
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,971
this is how human beings behave.
So let's insulate ourselves from that 

194
00:10:43,971 --> 00:10:45,060
typical human tendency.
Does that make sense?

195
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,550
There is an element of a Shakespearean 
tragedy,

196
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,810
man is a creature,
right?

197
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,620
And so,
uh,

198
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,740
you see these foibles pop up time.
And again,

199
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,450
let me,
I will say this,

200
00:11:02,451 --> 00:11:06,860
that I think the professional military,
especially at the senior level,

201
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:12,680
uh,
are reluctant fighters a fish.

202
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:14,440
That's been my experience.
Now I,

203
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,370
you know,
I didn't know George Patton,

204
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:21,970
but by and large from my experience in 
the JCS and senior Washington levels,

205
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,190
there's nobody looking for a fight.
They're,

206
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:33,050
uh,
their advice uniformly has been slow 

207
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:33,350
down.
You know,

208
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,640
it really didn't work for Napoleon.
So,

209
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,570
uh,
it's on the civilian side,

210
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,620
uh,
in case of the Middle East problems that

211
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:50,000
we're having still today,
the neo-cons know the guys who had never

212
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,370
worn a uniform,
a dick.

213
00:11:52,371 --> 00:11:54,550
Cheney had,
uh,

214
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,510
seven,
uh,

215
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:02,310
excuses for not going to Vietnam and the
people around him in those levels.

216
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,850
We're anxious to go back and do Iraq 
again.

217
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,880
You don't have to really get Saddam.
We're saying this time that wasn't 

218
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,970
military,
that was a political people.

219
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,840
And so the Hubris that I have seen has 
been wearing the dark blue suits not to 

220
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,620
uniforms.

221
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,240
Interesting.
I had met General Mattis wants,

222
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:25,060
and he had basically said something 
similar.

223
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:30,061
He was very cognizant of the limitations
of military power when I was talking to 

224
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:33,130
him.
So then let me ask you this then.

225
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:38,430
It seems to me that there's an 
institutional bias in this country and 

226
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:38,430
it's a human thing.
It's,

227
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,710
I don't blame anyone against,
let's call it the can't do general as 

228
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:47,221
opposed to the can do general.
So let's say we're talking about the 

229
00:12:47,221 --> 00:12:50,911
50th anniversary of Ted and we're 
talking about Vietnam and Johnson or 

230
00:12:50,911 --> 00:12:52,990
Nixon brings in a couple of military 
advisors and out of the five of them,

231
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:55,180
four of them say,
of course we can win this war.

232
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:57,310
Let me tell you how to do it,
put me in charge and I'll do it.

233
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,540
And one guy says,
no,

234
00:12:58,541 --> 00:12:58,760
no,
no,

235
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,040
you're not going to win this.
It's over.

236
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,780
Let's figure out a way to get out of 
here with honor.

237
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,780
Isn't there a natural tendency to say,
listen,

238
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:07,480
the can't do guy,
I'm not going to go with that.

239
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:09,340
I'm going to go with somebody who tells 
me he can get it done.

240
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:11,260
And isn't there a sense in the military 
of,

241
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,080
I don't want to be the guy that says we 
can't do this.

242
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:16,930
I don't want to be thought of as the guy
who says this is unwinnable.

243
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:19,000
Of course you put me in charge and I'll 
get it done.

244
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,570
Um,
seems to me that it's,

245
00:13:20,571 --> 00:13:23,710
it's tough for someone to stand up in 
that sort of situation and say,

246
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,080
let's not do this.
We wouldn't be successful.

247
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:28,760
It wouldn't be prudent.
Does that have any,

248
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:34,260
when you're talking about the 
institutional failures with the people 

249
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,451
who wear suits,
is that a problem that they're going to 

250
00:13:36,451 --> 00:13:36,451
run into?

251
00:13:36,451 --> 00:13:37,160
You know,
Dan,

252
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,060
again,
you put a very deep question,

253
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,400
but let me just say that isn't the way I
have seen the problem formulated during 

254
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:54,211
my time in Washington now.
I'm sure this changes as the cast of 

255
00:13:54,211 --> 00:13:58,591
characters changes in Washington,
but typically the president doesn't ask 

256
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:04,410
advice of five guys and uh,
you know,

257
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:05,290
for him.
So yeah,

258
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,510
I can do it.
One Says No.

259
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,050
What the president says is,
Hey,

260
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,860
we've got a problem here.
What are my options?

261
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,850
So he's not looking for a yes,
no answer.

262
00:14:15,851 --> 00:14:19,810
It's not a binary problem.
What he's looking for is,

263
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,900
you know,
Gimme a half a dozen things I might do 

264
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,380
here.
Tell me the pros and cons of each thing.

265
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,290
Let me make a decision.
So,

266
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,820
uh,
in that case,

267
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,910
it's,
if you're opposed to taking a military 

268
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,370
action,
you just put it in the conscious.

269
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:41,380
So here's the deal,
we're going to lose friends around the 

270
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,031
world,
we're going to lose international 

271
00:14:45,031 --> 00:14:45,031
standing,
a trade's going to dry up or whatever.

272
00:14:45,031 --> 00:14:47,380
You can put an econ and you want,
but,

273
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,520
but the,
the proper approach from the military 

274
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:52,760
advisors is to say,
okay,

275
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,030
if you want to do this,
here's how you,

276
00:14:56,031 --> 00:15:00,130
here are a set of options and the,
and the and the,

277
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:05,131
uh,
and the pluses and minuses to go with 

278
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:07,931
them and then it's up to you.
So it's a little different formulation 

279
00:15:07,931 --> 00:15:07,931
than the one you put.

280
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:13,420
Okay?
So if you're the military advisor and 

281
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:13,800
you've been in the role of been chief of
staff before you,

282
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,160
you've been the air force,
uh,

283
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,130
a four star general here.
I mean,

284
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,220
if somebody comes to you,
the presence that I need your advice on 

285
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:22,320
this and he says something to the effect
of,

286
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,750
um,
Oh God,

287
00:15:24,751 --> 00:15:26,040
I'm losing my train of thought.
General.

288
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,330
I'm getting old now.
Fifty two,

289
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,360
just a little low.
I know I'm getting their aging quickly.

290
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,150
Okay,
here's what I wanted to get with that.

291
00:15:36,151 --> 00:15:36,500
So,
so,

292
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,540
so the old line about the Vietnam War 
was the political nature of the 

293
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,440
president,
for example,

294
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,920
operating as a person who's picking 
tactical targets for aircraft to bomb.

295
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,810
And yet the old argument that we learned
back in,

296
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:56,830
in military history class for why that 
might have been necessary was the 

297
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,510
president's got to worry about,
you know,

298
00:15:57,511 --> 00:16:00,240
Soviet involvement,
the threats of nuclear war,

299
00:16:00,241 --> 00:16:01,530
you know,
other things happening,

300
00:16:01,531 --> 00:16:06,531
including maybe funding a,
the very people you're fighting at a 

301
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:06,531
higher level to compensate.

302
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:09,090
Whereas the guys on the ground,
the military leaders are worried about,

303
00:16:09,091 --> 00:16:14,091
okay,
how do I get victory in this theater of 

304
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:16,011
operations?
What is the proper balance in your mind 

305
00:16:16,011 --> 00:16:20,930
between a president who's got to worry 
about the grand strategy across the 

306
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,100
world and the general who's got to say,
listen,

307
00:16:23,101 --> 00:16:27,060
if you just take your hands off of me,
I'll win this theater for you.

308
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,300
Um,
how do you see the balance of the 

309
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:32,300
general says,
you know,

310
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:32,460
general mcpeak,
if the President says,

311
00:16:32,461 --> 00:16:36,330
General Mcpeak help me out here,
what do you tell them to do?

312
00:16:36,331 --> 00:16:40,920
Visa VI allowing generals to have a free
hand versus a Lyndon Johnson who's maybe

313
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,240
more worried about the Soviet Union than
he is about making sure no more resupply

314
00:16:45,241 --> 00:16:46,860
ships get into Haiphong harbor.

315
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,520
Yeah.
Well,

316
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,300
this is a problem which is at the heart 
of limited warfare.

317
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,730
Uh,
if for instance,

318
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,160
you asked Curt Lemay

319
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:09,960
representative

320
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,230
a bomb went back into the stone age.
In fact,

321
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:18,231
he did say that and we could have won 
had we knew Tannoy the war would've been

322
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:23,620
over right.
So the war was always winnable.

323
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:29,550
It was just a question of what means,
how limited are the means you want to 

324
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,990
use you.
So you go to the presenter,

325
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
okay.
I'm assuming you don't want to use 

326
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,000
nuclear weapons.
I mean,

327
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,770
we have an instance case right now 
that's very relevant.

328
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,160
North Korea.
So if we seek to intervene in North 

329
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:49,170
Korea,
the first question we should ask 

330
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,400
ourselves is,
is this a limited war or the means we're

331
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:53,770
going to use limited now?
And not just the message,

332
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,500
it will have a limited amount of time.
No.

333
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,340
Are you going to put a limit on the 
amount of money we're going to spend?

334
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,620
So you have to decide all of the 
boundaries of the limitations you're 

335
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:11,421
going to put on warfare and then that 
has to be bought by the president.

336
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,750
I mean you have to tell President 
Johnson,

337
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:20,670
okay,
if I have to worry more about the Soviet

338
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:25,670
Union and I do a winning in quotes and 
say in South Vietnam,

339
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,270
that's fine.
Just tell me that and that means I can't

340
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,660
mine Hanoi harbor and blow up some 
Soviet boat.

341
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,380
Now are you willing to live with that?
So the president has to understand that 

342
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,600
the nature of the war,
it's going to be limited and that means 

343
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,440
we may or may not win.
If it's unlimited,

344
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:50,730
I know we can be north Vietnam or North 
Korea anytime.

345
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,400
So the first question you have to ask 
are,

346
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:55,410
what limitations are you going to put on
me?

347
00:18:55,411 --> 00:19:00,411
So we understand all of that.
Typically today we don't talk in terms 

348
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:04,710
of limited war.
We talk in terms of rules of engagement.

349
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,990
What rules of engagement is the 
president or the secretary of defense or

350
00:19:09,991 --> 00:19:13,920
the theater commander or whatever going 
to impose on operations,

351
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:18,030
and we need to be eyes wide open about 
that upfront.

352
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,500
Now inside the rules of engagement,
I would argue you ought to give the 

353
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,620
military guy as much flexibility as 
possible.

354
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:30,830
I don't want the president picking 
targets in the basement of the White 

355
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,860
House,
you know,

356
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,280
because he doesn't know much about 
targeting a no.

357
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,420
He's going to pick the wrong targets.
Where are you gonna?

358
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,440
Tell me to attack them from the wrong 
direction or it's going to tell me to 

359
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,591
use the wrong munitions or he's gonna.
Tell me to send to few airplanes or too 

360
00:19:48,591 --> 00:19:50,580
many airplanes.
Those are.

361
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,640
Those are questions that he knows very 
little about and what he needs to do is 

362
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:01,580
impose rules of engagement.
Tell me what the limitations are and 

363
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,480
leave me alone.
And then as long as I operate inside the

364
00:20:03,481 --> 00:20:08,481
limitation,
she should never have no any kind of a 

365
00:20:08,481 --> 00:20:12,470
quibble or complaint about how I'm,
how I'm doing and what the result is.

366
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,790
So the consequence,
you know,

367
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:19,230
the fact is we never lost a battle in 
Vietnam.

368
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,710
We just lost the war and uh,
so he has,

369
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:29,810
and I'm not a big fan of West Berlin,
I regard him miss rather dumb and mean 

370
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,710
that is what he tried to do with stupid 
in my opinion and not much,

371
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,970
not much improved when he was succeeded 
by the Abrams,

372
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:43,971
although there's a big school of thought
that says Abrams was a much more 

373
00:20:43,971 --> 00:20:46,760
talented officer and we were on the 
right track once we got rid of.

374
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,600
But in any case,
you know,

375
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,680
the point is that there are things that 
politicians are expert in and there are 

376
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:01,510
things that professional military or 
expert in and we need to understand who,

377
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,060
who,
who does what here,

378
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:07,360
when you're picking targets in the 
basement of the White House,

379
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,810
you're on the wrong track and you are 
going to lose,

380
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:15,811
in my opinion,
because you got the wrong guy doing the 

381
00:21:15,811 --> 00:21:15,811
wrong thing

382
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,370
on the right track.
I think that's a key point.

383
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,980
So when I'm watching Ken Burns Vietnam 
documentary,

384
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,440
one of the things that just screams at 
you,

385
00:21:25,441 --> 00:21:30,441
I was reminded once again at the 
veterans coming into the class I was in 

386
00:21:30,441 --> 00:21:30,570
the 19 eighties,
was it screams at you,

387
00:21:30,571 --> 00:21:35,571
is that you don't have any real way of 
determining how you're doing at any 

388
00:21:35,731 --> 00:21:38,040
given time.
I mean the classic way that was used was

389
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,350
body count,
but we understand that if you don't have

390
00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:42,950
body counts,
it's how you.

391
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:48,170
How do you measure progress in a way 
that's helpful to the heads of the 

392
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:52,341
military,
the political heads and the population 

393
00:21:52,341 --> 00:21:52,590
as a whole.
And we could apply this to the situation

394
00:21:52,591 --> 00:21:54,690
in the Middle East for example,
right now.

395
00:21:54,691 --> 00:21:59,691
I mean,
how do you gauge progress and if 

396
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:01,731
progress isn't going the way you want,
do you double down on the efforts or do 

397
00:22:01,731 --> 00:22:01,731
you determine that?

398
00:22:01,731 --> 00:22:06,570
Maybe.
I mean are we even capable of cutting 

399
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:06,570
loose?
Was there ever another choice?

400
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,460
In Vietnam we act like we could have 
just said,

401
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,230
listen,
we're losing the war so let's get out.

402
00:22:10,231 --> 00:22:15,231
But you know,
isn't the most difficult thing in the 

403
00:22:15,231 --> 00:22:16,800
world to disengage from combat with an 
enemy strategic level or tactical level.

404
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,510
So I guess what I'm asking is,
um,

405
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,900
how do you gauge progress whether or not
you're winning or losing,

406
00:22:21,901 --> 00:22:26,490
and then do you notice if it's not in 
your interest to notice that your,

407
00:22:26,491 --> 00:22:28,290
for example,
not winning,

408
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,060
you know,
can you get.

409
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:35,170
Because in the Vietnam War you're 
looking at these people that just seem 

410
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:38,450
in retrospect,
they look like they know the war is 

411
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,240
over,
but they can't say it,

412
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,100
they can't prove it,
they can't,

413
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,880
they can't operate or do anything about 
it.

414
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:49,881
They seem frozen in the condition.
So there seems to me to be a real need 

415
00:22:49,881 --> 00:22:53,631
to be able to measure progress and then 
have some sort of reaction to the data 

416
00:22:53,631 --> 00:22:54,810
you're getting.
Um,

417
00:22:55,050 --> 00:23:00,050
can you,
can you suggest a way maybe we could do 

418
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:00,720
that in the Middle East right now.
And if we decided it wasn't going well,

419
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,870
what do you do then?
Well,

420
00:23:03,871 --> 00:23:05,610
I mean,
isn't this the crux of the issue?

421
00:23:05,611 --> 00:23:06,840
Right?
Are we winning or losing?

422
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:08,610
And if we're winning or losing,
what do you do about it?

423
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,150
Just quickly for the answer.
But no,

424
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:19,000
there used to be a way of judging.
It was pretty easy territory.

425
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,930
Uh,
you want,

426
00:23:20,931 --> 00:23:22,550
if,
if you prevail,

427
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,910
if you held the battlefield at the end 
and the other guy left,

428
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,250
you were winning,
right?

429
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,700
So Churchill could be very worried about
what was going on in north Africa 

430
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,460
because Ronald pushed all the way to 
Alabama,

431
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,050
you know,
he was inside Egypt,

432
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:39,770
right?
For Cairo.

433
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,800
And the Suez Canal was threatened 
because the geography told Churchill 

434
00:23:46,081 --> 00:23:51,081
that he was losing.
So we replaced a whoever it was with,

435
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,870
uh,
uh,

436
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,380
Montgomery,
uh,

437
00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:00,470
it's not so in a linear war where armies
face each other,

438
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,840
you can tell who's winning by,
where the front line is and what 

439
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,960
direction it's moving.
Or at least that's,

440
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:10,500
that's one gross approximation.
No,

441
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,770
if you're fighting and Gettysburg,
you're not in good shape.

442
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,580
Totally.

443
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:21,150
Okay.
So you got to be fighting and 

444
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,431
Chancellorsville or someplace downtown.
Now it's not so easy anymore with a 

445
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:30,850
stateless actors like Isis or,
uh,

446
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,820
you know,
a suicide bombers.

447
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:39,570
How can you tell if you're winning?
I mean the guys doesn't have any 

448
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:43,060
territory to capture.
He doesn't have a national treasury that

449
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:46,900
you can loot.
He doesn't even really have a life worth

450
00:24:46,901 --> 00:24:49,850
living otherwise you wouldn't be in the 
suicide bombing does.

451
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,760
Right?
He doesn't care about his own life.

452
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,790
So in this,
in this kind of war,

453
00:24:56,050 --> 00:25:01,050
how do you judge where you are?
I don't think we have already answered 

454
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:05,610
to that.
You know there's there,

455
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,590
if we had a sort of an index of 
violence,

456
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,400
he would say,
well the violence is down and we kind of

457
00:25:12,401 --> 00:25:17,401
have that,
but in Afghanistan now we have the 

458
00:25:17,401 --> 00:25:19,660
Taliban bombing again inside Kabul.
Right.

459
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,500
And so the number,
you can plot the number of incidents on 

460
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,351
a graph and say and just say,
well they're more incidents this month 

461
00:25:28,351 --> 00:25:28,351
and there were less month.

462
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:32,770
You're not doing very well.
And in fact that's what I'm doing in the

463
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:35,290
Middle East now,
sort of subjectively.

464
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:38,680
I don't know.
I don't have a chart in my office that I

465
00:25:38,681 --> 00:25:42,480
keep track of this specifically,
but it seems to me I get.

466
00:25:42,481 --> 00:25:47,481
I have the sense that we're not doing 
very well in Afghanistan and Iraq and 

467
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:50,620
uh,
you know,

468
00:25:50,621 --> 00:25:55,621
I,
I don't know how to come unstuck from 

469
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:58,651
it.
This is a tar baby kind of deal where 

470
00:25:58,651 --> 00:25:58,651
you say,
Gee,

471
00:25:58,651 --> 00:26:02,191
I wish I could figure out how to get out
of here with my pride and,

472
00:26:02,411 --> 00:26:04,750
you know,
a reputation and shape.

473
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,590
I don't see a way to do it.
Uh,

474
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,600
we're,
we're kind of stuck to the problem in 

475
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,521
the Middle East and who knows how to 
judge whether we're doing better or 

476
00:26:15,371 --> 00:26:17,680
poorer than we were.
Uh,

477
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,720
you know,
not to go a year ago,

478
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,430
five years ago,
hard to say.

479
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:28,710
It's funny you say that.
I wasn't expecting that answer because 

480
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:28,710
it leads you to the next question,
which is,

481
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:32,961
if you can't figure out how you're doing
and if you really don't have any 

482
00:26:32,961 --> 00:26:33,930
options,
if you're totally stuck.

483
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,570
You know,
I remember being told a long time ago by

484
00:26:36,571 --> 00:26:41,571
my stepfather who was trying to explain 
to me the wide range of presidential 

485
00:26:41,571 --> 00:26:44,550
actions that I always assumed was 
possible was a myth.

486
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,590
And that when you actually got into the 
office,

487
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:51,240
it was really much more constrained by,
by what your predecessor left you,

488
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,620
a bunch of other things like,
you know,

489
00:26:52,621 --> 00:26:57,621
I can't fight the Vietnam war the way I 
want because the Soviet Union might get 

490
00:26:57,621 --> 00:26:57,621
involved.
Um,

491
00:26:57,621 --> 00:27:01,520
when you look at the current,
let's call it the war on terror 

492
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,000
situation,
I don't see.

493
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:04,560
I mean,
how do you get out of that when,

494
00:27:04,561 --> 00:27:04,980
I mean,
you know,

495
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:06,270
the old,
the old equation,

496
00:27:06,271 --> 00:27:11,271
which is it costs these elements that 
we're fighting pennies on the dollar 

497
00:27:11,271 --> 00:27:13,350
compared to what it costs for us to 
counter them.

498
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,040
I mean the longterm graphing out of that
situation looks horrible.

499
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,100
If you know,
it's,

500
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:23,150
I,
I feel like we could be doing a 

501
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,510
documentary with Ken Burns 150 year old 
Ken Burns years from now having the same

502
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:27,090
conversation about the current situation
we're in,

503
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:32,091
in the war on terror that I just saw the
other night when I was watching the 

504
00:27:32,091 --> 00:27:32,460
Vietnam war documentary.
And if that's the case,

505
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:37,850
you know,
you get this feeling like Deja Vu all 

506
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:40,011
over again or a train wreck that you've 
seen before and that it's happening in 

507
00:27:40,011 --> 00:27:44,121
slow motion,
but you're finding out exactly how 

508
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:45,630
limited the people in the late sixties 
were in terms of their options.

509
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,270
Does it feel like that to you at all?
Or does it seem like a tough.

510
00:27:48,271 --> 00:27:51,090
Because the context of the Cold War and 
all that is so different.

511
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,030
Um,
how similar to you would you feel if you

512
00:27:54,031 --> 00:27:57,690
were a president in office in Lyndon 
Baines Johnson's chair versus,

513
00:27:57,691 --> 00:27:59,040
um,
Donald Trump's chair.

514
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,470
Don't ask me that one.

515
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:08,940
Okay.
We can go back and see if it makes it 

516
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:08,940
easier.

517
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:14,490
Key issue is how do you define factory?
Another way of saying what,

518
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,480
what's our purpose?
What's our goal?

519
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,370
If you tell me what our purpose is in 
the Middle East,

520
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:28,820
I'll tell you how we're doing.
You tell me how to define victory in the

521
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:33,950
Middle East.
And I'll tell you whether we're on the 

522
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,360
10 yard line,
the 15 yard line and 50 yard line where 

523
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,940
we are.
But I don't recall anybody ever saying,

524
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,850
here's our objective,
here's,

525
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,880
here's how we would define victory.
And if you don't have a definition of 

526
00:28:47,431 --> 00:28:52,431
victory,
then you don't know when to quit or our 

527
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:54,000
window retire or how to get out,
you know,

528
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,930
because you can't tell.
You know,

529
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,500
we,
we'd like to.

530
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:02,570
I mean,
George W dot Bush famously went on a 

531
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:05,460
aircraft carrier instead under a sign 
that said mission accomplished.

532
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,270
I remember that.
That was how many years ago?

533
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,560
So at least 15.
We're still in Iraq.

534
00:29:13,561 --> 00:29:18,561
If our mission was accomplished when 
George W dot Bush went on that boat and 

535
00:29:18,571 --> 00:29:23,571
declared victory,
what the heck are we still doing in 

536
00:29:23,571 --> 00:29:23,571
Iraq?

537
00:29:23,571 --> 00:29:28,250
Well then you get back to your question 
though about is this is everything we're

538
00:29:28,251 --> 00:29:30,440
facing now,
sort of a bit of blowback.

539
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:35,530
I mean,
do we stir up a hornet's nest and we're 

540
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:38,321
still dealing with individual Hornets 
and it would have been better had we 

541
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:38,321
left,
you know,

542
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:42,230
the Hornet and chief Saddam Hussein in 
charge because at least we weren't the 

543
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:42,230
ones who had pick up the pieces.
I mean,

544
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:47,190
I guess you know what,
what amateur armchair historians like 

545
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,491
yours truly do general as you almost 
certainly know as we look at these and 

546
00:29:50,491 --> 00:29:52,060
we try to find meaning from the past,
which is this,

547
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,310
this,
this horrible fool's game.

548
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:54,980
But,
but,

549
00:29:54,981 --> 00:29:55,900
but I mean,
when you look at this,

550
00:29:55,901 --> 00:29:56,560
you go,
I mean,

551
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:02,410
you almost get to a point where you say,
would Saddam Hussein and the Middle East

552
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:06,910
we had in 1991 be an applicable trade 
that a modern politician would,

553
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:09,250
would trade today if they could get back
to that?

554
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,040
Yes.
In fact,

555
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:17,041
I would have traded at the time I wrote 
an op Ed pieces and made speeches 

556
00:30:17,591 --> 00:30:21,580
against Iraq.
It drove me out of the Republican Party.

557
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:26,790
You know,
I ended up supporting Obama in 2008.

558
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:33,570
In fact,
I was the national culture of his 

559
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,740
presidential campaign and the issue for 
me was how badly a that whole thing had 

560
00:30:42,221 --> 00:30:47,221
been handled and putting my buddy Colin 
Powell going in front of the General 

561
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:49,570
Assembly and making outrageous claims 
claims.

562
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:52,210
Did I?
I thought I knew.

563
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,440
In fact,
at the time,

564
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:58,441
we're wrong about Saddam Hussein's 
having weapons of mass destruction or 

565
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:01,720
the other lies that were told,
you know,

566
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,220
Saddam Hussein and bin Ladin,
we're good buddies.

567
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,970
Bologna.
There wasn't any al Qaeda in Iraq,

568
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
as long as the dom was saying was they 
hated each other or that we would be 

569
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,220
welcomed as liberator's.
You know,

570
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,690
people would throw bouquets of roses as 
our guys going into Baghdad.

571
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:26,130
Bologna as it turned out.
So I said that it's a diamond and you 

572
00:31:26,141 --> 00:31:31,141
know,
a trillion dollars later and thousands 

573
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:33,901
of lives later,
we're stuck with in Iraq that is much 

574
00:31:33,901 --> 00:31:37,460
worse than what it was when Saddam 
Hussein was running it.

575
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,460
So,
uh,

576
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:44,890
you know,
the real issue here is what are our 

577
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:45,460
purposes?
How do we define victory?

578
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:50,970
What limitations are we going to put on 
our use of violence to achieve these 

579
00:31:51,131 --> 00:31:54,580
purposes?
These are very deep questions,

580
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,270
very hard questions to answer.
And,

581
00:31:58,271 --> 00:32:00,100
uh,
and then frankly,

582
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:05,101
most,
most presidents need as much help as 

583
00:32:05,101 --> 00:32:06,070
possible to get to these answers that 
they need help from,

584
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,580
you know,
wise and good military advisors,

585
00:32:09,581 --> 00:32:11,920
which I don't think they,
they always get.

586
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:18,900
You were just talking a second ago about
Colin Powell respected military 

587
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,020
authority,
but using that authority,

588
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:21,850
uh,
um,

589
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,120
as part of an effort to sell the 
American people and the world on,

590
00:32:26,121 --> 00:32:29,240
on a particular foreign policy move.
And it occurs to me,

591
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:30,200
you know,
one of the things that,

592
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:35,250
that watching the Ken Burns Vietnam 
documentary really brings home is the 

593
00:32:35,511 --> 00:32:38,960
context of what a different America.
It was back in the,

594
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,880
when Vietnam was heating up the early 19
sixties.

595
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,610
I was born during the Yod rang battle.
I mean,

596
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:48,450
so 1965 when things are really heating 
up with ground troops.

597
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,720
Um,
the government at that time was assumed 

598
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,910
to be telling the truth by just about 
everyone.

599
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:58,320
It was a black and white good and evil 
world.

600
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,800
Um,
you know,

601
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,190
I always tell young people when I'm 
talking to them,

602
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:07,191
I always bring up the first world war 
and I talk about a generation of people 

603
00:33:07,191 --> 00:33:07,250
that could watch,
uh,

604
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,820
the,
the unit in front of them,

605
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:13,821
step out of the trenches and go over the
top and be machined gun within 10 yards 

606
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:13,821
of the trench.

607
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:16,200
And then the next wave will do the same 
thing.

608
00:33:16,201 --> 00:33:20,070
And I said we wouldn't do that today in 
the same way that much of the stuff that

609
00:33:20,071 --> 00:33:24,360
in 1962 era American would've considered
a truism,

610
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:27,870
um,
would be much more skeptically by a 21st

611
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:30,170
century American.
How much did you know the,

612
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:35,270
the,
so called credibility gap over several 

613
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,791
administrations in that era,
do you know lasting the boy who cried 

614
00:33:37,861 --> 00:33:42,861
wolf type damage to our government's 
ability to be trusted with statements 

615
00:33:43,051 --> 00:33:45,780
like how the war is going or anything 
else?

616
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,080
What did we sort of.
Did we lose our innocence?

617
00:33:49,081 --> 00:33:51,390
I guess as a classic phrase from my 19 
eighties,

618
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,580
Vietnam War,
military history class?

619
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,720
Well,
in particular,

620
00:33:57,721 --> 00:34:02,721
the Pentagon papers,
you know,

621
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:09,090
after they were published in the New 
York Times,

622
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:12,390
The Washington Post,
uh,

623
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:18,140
Americans came to understand that a 
succession of administrations,

624
00:34:19,561 --> 00:34:24,561
both Democrat and Republican had 
systematically lied to the American 

625
00:34:25,381 --> 00:34:30,381
people.
And I don't think that was that our 

626
00:34:30,381 --> 00:34:34,200
country has ever been the same again,
the skepticism,

627
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:40,210
uh,
which that whole episode properly 

628
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,360
aroused has been with us ever since.
And I frankly,

629
00:34:45,361 --> 00:34:48,590
it is a loss of medicines for us.
And,

630
00:34:48,591 --> 00:34:53,591
and if you look at our history,
we were never a great power until after 

631
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,590
World War One.
So our,

632
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,210
our,
uh,

633
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:01,170
experience on the world stage was pretty
limited,

634
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:02,790
uh,
you know,

635
00:35:02,791 --> 00:35:07,791
maybe 50 years of experience as a,
as a real actor in international 

636
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:10,120
affairs.
And then finally we,

637
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:14,450
we woke up a bit,
we saw how that sort of thing happens.

638
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,540
It's not,
the government weren't cynical before.

639
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:22,560
I think the Brits were,
the British government has been cynical,

640
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,850
you know,
for a long time,

641
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,760
but Americans were truly a children of 
the frontier,

642
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:31,220
uh,
you know,

643
00:35:31,221 --> 00:35:32,910
with,
with a sort of a,

644
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:39,290
a Western heritage frontier parentage.
And we wanted to believe that our 

645
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:47,241
government was telling the truth,
but we learned in the Pentagon papers 

646
00:35:47,241 --> 00:35:48,810
that that's not so.
And ever since we've been,

647
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,360
I think properly skeptical.

648
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,670
I guess the logical question is why do 
you think,

649
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:02,730
you know,
I think the tendency would be to blame 

650
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:03,480
some president from the opposite 
political party and,

651
00:36:03,481 --> 00:36:05,410
and demonize them.
But as you said,

652
00:36:05,411 --> 00:36:10,411
this was a,
a multi administration effort to keep 

653
00:36:10,411 --> 00:36:14,160
from the people who are supposed to 
understand what's going on so they can 

654
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,090
be informed voters from really knowing 
what's going on.

655
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:17,810
And it started with,
you know,

656
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:22,950
Eisenhower even,
but even to the end with Nixon and 

657
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:23,780
Christmas bombings that were secret.
I mean,

658
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,290
what was,
I guess,

659
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:30,630
was it kept secret in your mind for,
for military reasons or was it kept 

660
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:34,951
secret because the reaction of the 
American people to their own policies 

661
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:36,490
was what the government was worried 
about.

662
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,620
I think it was the latter.
Really.

663
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:47,510
The government didn't.
The president didn't want to be 

664
00:36:47,531 --> 00:36:52,531
embarrassed.
Embarrassment is the worst possible 

665
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:57,990
situation for a public figure.
And so the bombing of Cambodia,

666
00:36:58,331 --> 00:37:01,180
for instance,
was a secret from the American people.

667
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:06,480
It's sure as hell wasn't secret from the
Cambodians what are the north Vietnamese

668
00:37:06,611 --> 00:37:09,280
army,
which was using Cambodia for sanctuary.

669
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:12,340
They knew all about it.
So the secrecy,

670
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:15,700
there wasn't a military necessity at 
all.

671
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,670
The enemy quite understood what was 
going on.

672
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,200
The,
the,

673
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:24,310
the secrecy was required to keep the 
American people in the dark.

674
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:29,850
And the only,
the only reason for that is the 

675
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,240
government would have been embarrassed 
to admit what was going on.

676
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:35,210
That's the worst possible reason to,
uh,

677
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:39,250
classify a,
any information is to protect,

678
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,570
to protect yourself from embarrassment.
But that's exactly what was going on.

679
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:48,970
Do you think that the efforts of the 
media today are.

680
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,920
I want to compare them to the media 
efforts in Vietnam,

681
00:37:52,921 --> 00:37:57,921
which we're so scrutinized and yet 
perhaps so influential on what went on 

682
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:03,110
and I just,
I'm not even sure we're talking apples 

683
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:03,110
and oranges here in the,
in the ability to compare them,

684
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:07,940
but how would you compare today's media 
coverage of America's conflicts and 

685
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,300
that,
for example,

686
00:38:09,301 --> 00:38:10,500
take 19,
67,

687
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:12,780
68?
Because it was very different in 62,

688
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,440
but how would you,
how would you compare the media's job,

689
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:19,680
how they cover with the restrictions by 
the way that we understand?

690
00:38:19,681 --> 00:38:22,200
I mean they don't have the same kind of 
ability to show this.

691
00:38:22,201 --> 00:38:24,200
I mean the combat footage that,
it,

692
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:29,210
not to change the subject but,
but the thing that rocked me in Ken 

693
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,300
Burns' documentary the most,
and I have no idea how he did it,

694
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:35,630
is there's segments where you'll see 35 
seconds in a row of that looks like it 

695
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:38,920
was shot yesterday,
high definition stuff.

696
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:43,921
And you know,
for people like me who've seen a lot of 

697
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:46,021
that footage,
I couldn't figure out if it's computer 

698
00:38:46,021 --> 00:38:46,021
enhanced or what,
but,

699
00:38:46,021 --> 00:38:50,010
but when you're looking at what the 
media is able to show back then and the 

700
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:52,810
difference in the coverage today,
can you compare in your mind's eye,

701
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:58,060
um,
the pros and cons of the way we did it 

702
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:58,060
then and how we do it now?

703
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:08,320
Media coverage in Vietnam was by and 
large positive in my opinion,

704
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:16,780
except for photo coverage.
You know,

705
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:17,660
the,
the,

706
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:22,750
the impact of a photograph or today 
video is so much more,

707
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:29,050
uh,
a pervasive or influential or stocking 

708
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:34,190
know you got a photograph of a,
of a police general in Saigon shooting 

709
00:39:34,671 --> 00:39:38,080
or a guy in the head or a,
or a,

710
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:42,500
a very young girl running away from the 
village.

711
00:39:42,501 --> 00:39:46,970
It's been an avon.
Whether skin on fire these pictures,

712
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:52,450
uh,
convey a message in a way that written 

713
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,120
journalism or broadcast journalism 
cannot.

714
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,790
And,
and they were very negative.

715
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:00,110
I mean a Buddhist monks,
you know,

716
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:05,290
emulating themselves in the streets of 
Saigon when you show that you show it on

717
00:40:05,691 --> 00:40:10,691
television,
it just is merciless and the message it 

718
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:13,370
can base.
And so for my money,

719
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,850
until Walter Cronkite,
uh,

720
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,590
came on CBS news and said,
hey,

721
00:40:18,591 --> 00:40:19,830
we're not winning guys.

722
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,060
After 10,
uh,

723
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:28,260
the,
the coverage was pretty universally 

724
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:28,970
supportive.
The written coverage,

725
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,700
but the photographic coverage underlie 
just,

726
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:33,770
just,
uh,

727
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,500
undermined everything that was being 
said in print.

728
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,260
Now today it's a,
the coverage is much more visual,

729
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:46,190
much more video oriented and photo 
oriented.

730
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:52,150
And so the bad news hits earlier I think
because photo,

731
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:56,060
you know,
you don't see a photograph of,

732
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:01,430
of a ribbon cutting,
so it has downtown Baghdad is liberated.

733
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:07,180
You see these awful scenes of devastated
towns that we're creating in the Middle 

734
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,230
East.
I mean there's no getting around it.

735
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,460
We're,
we're in a large scale destructive mode.

736
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:19,790
They're in the Middle East and that's 
what people are seeing.

737
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,850
They're not seeing any upside,
you know,

738
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:26,510
you can talk about upside all you want 
and how well we're doing and so forth.

739
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:31,540
But what we are seeing is awful.
The consequences of combat there.

740
00:41:32,121 --> 00:41:37,121
And so I think the coverage today is 
much more pessimistic and skeptical and 

741
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:47,230
even perhaps a cynical but because they 
are showing not just telling and from 

742
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,550
now on I expect that's a way that 
coverage will be.

743
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,050
Because this gentleman,
you know,

744
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:59,060
our younger generation is much more 
video oriented and won't read the New 

745
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,340
York Times.
Watch it on,

746
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,500
you know,
on facebook.

747
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:08,690
Yeah.
Once upon a time it used to be Radio 

748
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,620
Free Europe trying to get a little teeny
signal over the iron curtain.

749
00:42:11,621 --> 00:42:14,020
Now that if we were fighting the north 
Vietnamese army,

750
00:42:14,021 --> 00:42:16,000
they would have a troll of people on 
twitter,

751
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:21,270
you know,
giving their side of the story or 

752
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:21,270
pretending to be Americans

753
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:21,920
complete with photographs.

754
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,570
Fake photographs.
Yes,

755
00:42:25,571 --> 00:42:26,470
exactly.
You're right.

756
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:31,680
Well then let me,
let me ask you a little bit of not 

757
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,901
really changing subjects,
but I can't have a four star general on 

758
00:42:33,901 --> 00:42:36,430
here without mining you a little bit for
some knowledge and wisdom myself.

759
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,940
I'm looking at Syria and I'm looking.
You had talked about,

760
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,340
you know,
in destructive mode right now,

761
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:47,700
but to have an arm chair person like me,
it looks like a terribly small theater 

762
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:53,550
to have that many different forces 
operating in and us hoping to keep 

763
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,870
everything clean with no major mistakes 
and whatnot.

764
00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:01,170
Um,
you had talked about North Korea as 

765
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:03,931
well.
Can you talk to me a little about those 

766
00:43:03,931 --> 00:43:06,541
two hot spots and if there's a third one
you would add to the mix of places we 

767
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:06,541
need to be careful right now

768
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:13,990
is the most important and threatening 
problem that we face anywhere in the 

769
00:43:16,091 --> 00:43:21,091
world or have faced for a long time.
I really think we're up against a,

770
00:43:21,331 --> 00:43:26,331
a sort of a Cuban missile crisis,
so it's been that long since we've 

771
00:43:28,181 --> 00:43:33,181
really been looked down the barrel gun 
drill as far as Syria goes.

772
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,800
Um,
it is an awfully small theater of 

773
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,430
operations,
especially on the air side.

774
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,440
We're talking about aircraft like the,
uh,

775
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,850
[inaudible] that that's super cruise.
In other words,

776
00:43:45,851 --> 00:43:50,851
there are supersonic there.
They're running around the sky at one 

777
00:43:50,851 --> 00:43:54,331
point seven,
one point eight bucks all the time and 

778
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:57,460
that makes Syria pretty small countries 
even do a one,

779
00:43:57,461 --> 00:44:00,250
a two,
a 180 degree turn in,

780
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,140
you know,
and the Russians are,

781
00:44:02,141 --> 00:44:07,141
they're sharing that airspace now.
We've so far been able to coordinate 

782
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:13,050
that air activity pretty well,
even though the Russians did lose a 

783
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:16,780
fighter to a circuit,
to a target or a ground fire.

784
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,670
So,
but the less,

785
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:23,850
you know,
we're running a head to head against 

786
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:26,880
each other in a very small airspace and 
it's a tribute to the professionalism of

787
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:33,030
our air force that we haven't already 
shot down a few of those guys.

788
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:35,370
Uh,
but that's,

789
00:44:35,371 --> 00:44:37,020
uh,
that's terribly dangerous.

790
00:44:37,021 --> 00:44:42,021
We could be any day involved in a head 
to head fight with Russian aircraft and 

791
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,760
where that,
you know,

792
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:50,400
that that's got the potential to go,
to escalate,

793
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,870
to go anywhere.
So it's dangerous in my opinion.

794
00:44:54,871 --> 00:44:59,871
It's less dangerous than the situation 
in North Korea where we have apparently 

795
00:45:00,091 --> 00:45:05,091
a crazy guy in charge of a,
a government that is the,

796
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:10,710
does possess nuclear weapons and is 
rapidly developing the capability if it 

797
00:45:11,371 --> 00:45:16,371
doesn't already have them to deliver 
those nuclear weapons against American 

798
00:45:16,371 --> 00:45:17,300
cities.
Uh,

799
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:22,310
I think that's an awful situation.
I think we can't allow that to continue.

800
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:27,530
I believe we must intervene and do 
something there.

801
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:29,520
Now what should we do?
Well,

802
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:33,440
I'm in favor of using all the tools in 
the toolbox.

803
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,120
If you think diplomacy will work,
by all means,

804
00:45:36,121 --> 00:45:38,400
let's do it.
If you think we can,

805
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:38,860
uh,
you know,

806
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:42,030
economic sanctions will work.
Let's impose them.

807
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,880
If you think the Chinese can help us or 
the Russians can help us.

808
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,890
Well,
I all means let's involve them.

809
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,640
At the end of the day,
I think we've tried just about 

810
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,221
everything here and nothing has worked 
so far because what we have to do is 

811
00:45:58,471 --> 00:46:02,220
dismantle its nuclear capability.
We can allow,

812
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:07,490
in my opinion,
North Korea to continue to develop a 

813
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,610
nuclear,
uh,

814
00:46:08,611 --> 00:46:13,611
me threats against the American American
homeland,

815
00:46:14,191 --> 00:46:19,080
property and citizens and institutions 
and so forth that,

816
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:24,380
that has to be dismantled and I believe 
it has to be dismantled relatively 

817
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:28,881
quickly.
We don't have forever to deal with this 

818
00:46:28,881 --> 00:46:30,680
problem or it will get to a point where 
we can't deal with it now.

819
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:35,690
I think we should deal with it with 
conventional weapons and I rather than 

820
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:41,270
use nuclear weapons against North Korea.
And I think we still have the capability

821
00:46:42,301 --> 00:46:44,600
to do that too.
Just to help the,

822
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:47,250
you know,
them dismantled its capability.

823
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:52,750
Well,
we need to get with it pretty soon 

824
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:52,750
because,
uh,

825
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:52,750
you know,
Time's running out on him.

826
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:57,310
Go back to some of the constraints maybe
that a guy like Johnson was operating 

827
00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:01,691
under.
What if the Chinese or Putin's 

828
00:47:01,691 --> 00:47:02,240
government tell us,
no,

829
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:03,170
don't do that.

830
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:07,010
Well,
I don't think.

831
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,630
Well,
we know that already.

832
00:47:08,631 --> 00:47:13,631
First of all,
but remember the North Korean nuclear 

833
00:47:13,631 --> 00:47:15,950
capability is a bigger threat to 
Beijing,

834
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:21,850
a bigger threat of glad of a stock and 
it is to Honolulu or Chicago,

835
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:29,080
so there's every reason to believe that 
they would wish to cooperate us.

836
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:32,320
If not,
then so be it.

837
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,300
No,
we,

838
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:37,570
we have the means to deter China and 
Russia.

839
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:42,220
We've shown that already.
The question is we don't,

840
00:47:42,221 --> 00:47:46,510
I think know for sure or,
or with great enough probability that we

841
00:47:46,511 --> 00:47:49,960
can deter North Korea.
I mean,

842
00:47:49,961 --> 00:47:54,961
I've heard it argued that this guy,
Kim Jong Gun is a rational person.

843
00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:01,540
All he wants to do is hold power.
Therefore he has something to lose.

844
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:06,280
Therefore he detour trouble and I think 
that's probably right.

845
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:09,820
My question is,
what if it's well,

846
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:12,970
what are the odds that he's not the 
terrible?

847
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:16,720
Say there,
say it's only 10 percent,

848
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:19,280
so do we want to make it a bit?

849
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:24,630
Again,
we want to bet Chicago or New York City 

850
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:29,100
that he's deterrent will when the odds 
are 10 percent say that he's not the 

851
00:48:29,231 --> 00:48:32,320
terrible.
I don't think we want to take that bet.

852
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:37,770
And by the way,
at the overview ought to be here about 

853
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:41,680
nuclear proliferation.
Where are we going to draw the line?

854
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:47,580
Is it okay for Nigeria or Honduras or a 
Bailey's to have nuclear weapons?

855
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:58,590
What is the,
what is the point of which we are going 

856
00:48:58,590 --> 00:48:58,590
to put our foot down and say,
no,

857
00:48:58,590 --> 00:48:59,980
we've gone far enough,
you know,

858
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:05,140
it's enough that 10 or so countries that
are acting responsibly so far have 

859
00:49:06,731 --> 00:49:11,731
nuclear weapons.
But that's enough where the world is 

860
00:49:11,731 --> 00:49:11,731
dangerous enough,
you know,

861
00:49:11,731 --> 00:49:16,620
without a Astonia having a full up 
nuclear delivery capability.

862
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:19,210
So,
but in any case,

863
00:49:19,211 --> 00:49:24,211
we now have a case which I think is as 
clear as can be that says we need to 

864
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:32,701
stop this process here.
If America possesses armed forces for 

865
00:49:35,021 --> 00:49:40,021
any reason,
it is to protect the property and the 

866
00:49:40,021 --> 00:49:44,311
institutions and the lives of Americans 
against threats like North Korea as a 

867
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:51,300
nuclear armed North Korea,
I believe we ought to draw the line and 

868
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:56,550
we ought to give a deadline by one 
January next year.

869
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:03,030
Either the new,
the North Koreans are dismantling this 

870
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:06,631
capability under international 
inspection or we will help dismantle it.

871
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:12,620
It's funny you jumped the gun and went 
right to my next question,

872
00:50:12,621 --> 00:50:15,680
which was about nuclear nonproliferation
because I wanted to ask you,

873
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,940
is it specifically in North Korean 
problem or is it a,

874
00:50:18,941 --> 00:50:21,050
is it,
you mentioned believes,

875
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:21,410
right?
Okay.

876
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,530
Is it a beliefs problem?
So here's my question though.

877
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:29,590
This reminds me a little of like certain
naval treaties between the two world 

878
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:31,500
wars where we're telling certain powers,
listen,

879
00:50:31,501 --> 00:50:35,120
this is 70 plus year old technology,
the,

880
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,040
the basis for nuclear weapons,
right?

881
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:38,020
Um,
and,

882
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:43,070
and when you're telling other countries 
that they can never develop that 

883
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:46,451
capability,
isn't that the equivalent of locking 

884
00:50:46,451 --> 00:50:49,310
them into second power status 
permanently in the way that the,

885
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,370
you know,
the Japanese had to have six battleships

886
00:50:52,371 --> 00:50:54,710
to every 10 British battleships.
I mean,

887
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:55,360
is that,
uh,

888
00:50:55,590 --> 00:51:00,590
it,
it seems to be the farther we get away 

889
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:00,590
from,
from when that technology was invented,

890
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,630
the weirder it gets to tell people,
listen,

891
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:07,750
you can have anything.
But something that was invented darn 

892
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:10,241
near 100 years ago is that she should 
the foreign policy of the country be 

893
00:51:10,241 --> 00:51:14,351
that no nuclear powers that aren't 
currently nuclear powers should be 

894
00:51:14,351 --> 00:51:15,170
allowed to become nuclear powers.

895
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,920
No,
the foreign policy of nuclear zero that 

896
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:26,640
we would like to see a world without 
nuclear weapons.

897
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:32,090
We would be much safer.
I mean our superiority and conventional 

898
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:37,041
warfare is so pronounced that if nuclear
weapons disappeared everywhere in the 

899
00:51:38,881 --> 00:51:41,700
world,
it would improve the safety and security

900
00:51:41,701 --> 00:51:46,701
of the American people.
And so our policy ought to be a zero 

901
00:51:48,421 --> 00:51:51,480
nuclear weapons for anybody.
Now,

902
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:56,510
how do we get there?
I have no idea because a country like 

903
00:51:56,510 --> 00:52:00,681
say Israel,
which commonly is understood to possess 

904
00:52:00,681 --> 00:52:04,101
an inventory of nuclear weapons is not 
going to renounce them a given its 

905
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,560
security situation,
you know,

906
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:12,600
and the geography lives.
So I don't know if a practical way to 

907
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,240
get to zero.
I think it ought to be our objective and

908
00:52:15,241 --> 00:52:19,830
I think we ought to work on it and try 
to get there and eventually hopefully we

909
00:52:19,831 --> 00:52:20,790
can get there.

910
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,940
But that ought to be our policy 
objective.

911
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:28,050
And in the meantime,
we ought to say a yes,

912
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:33,770
nobody else can do it,
doesn't have them now is going to get 

913
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:38,091
them and it's going to reduce them to 
second class status and that's too bad 

914
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:42,330
going to have to live with it.
But you know,

915
00:52:42,331 --> 00:52:47,331
the world is increasingly dangerous.
The more people get that capability.

916
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:53,630
And uh,
so it does freeze people into a sort of 

917
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:58,611
a formulaic,
a position like we tried to do with 

918
00:52:58,611 --> 00:53:01,620
capital ships at one time.
Remember though,

919
00:53:01,621 --> 00:53:03,380
we,
this is not the first time we've,

920
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,810
we've outlawed chemical munitions,
right?

921
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,610
Sure.
Worldwide,

922
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:13,640
hopefully and now,
and we to enforced that a bit so we can,

923
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:18,480
uh,
put certain limitations that we hope are

924
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:23,120
universal on the kind of munitions that 
are available for use in hostile,

925
00:53:23,121 --> 00:53:24,450
uh,
engagements.

926
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,000
Okay.
About a conventional

927
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,240
situation then of,
of a,

928
00:53:27,241 --> 00:53:30,090
of a change in power.
So you look at something like in Iran,

929
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:31,580
in their region,
uh,

930
00:53:31,581 --> 00:53:36,500
all of us history not to know that,
that traditionally Iran or Persia is one

931
00:53:36,501 --> 00:53:41,501
of the,
we'll call them the regional 

932
00:53:41,501 --> 00:53:41,501
superpowers.
Right?

933
00:53:41,501 --> 00:53:42,200
And they wax and wane,
but sometimes they dominate the region.

934
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:47,520
Um,
it seems like the policy sometimes is 

935
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,500
we're not going to let anyone change the
power relationships that are currently 

936
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,340
in place.
Is that a viable,

937
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:55,910
it seems to be a hedge demonic power 
sort of way of looking at it.

938
00:53:55,911 --> 00:53:58,970
But is that a viable way to look at 
something like the Middle East and say,

939
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:01,070
no,
you're not going to expand your,

940
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:06,071
um,
influence into Syria even if that's a 

941
00:54:06,071 --> 00:54:06,740
traditional Persian area of expansion?
Do you see where I'm going with this?

942
00:54:06,741 --> 00:54:08,000
I mean,
how much can we,

943
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:13,280
uh,
we'll call it the United States is the 

944
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,891
tip of the spear,
but we all represent a bunch of major 

945
00:54:14,891 --> 00:54:17,171
powers.
How much can we be the congress of 

946
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:17,171
Vienna,
but constantly,

947
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:20,090
you know,
making sure that things stay stable,

948
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:22,310
we'll call them stable,
for lack of a better word.

949
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:23,730
So,
nuclear stability,

950
00:54:23,731 --> 00:54:26,660
you're all for what about even like 
regional power,

951
00:54:26,661 --> 00:54:27,920
shifting stability?

952
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:35,230
We are no doubt a status quo power 
because we're the top dog.

953
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,650
So we don't want that to change.
And hopefully I've never changes.

954
00:54:41,651 --> 00:54:46,651
I mean,
if this country lasts a thousand years 

955
00:54:46,651 --> 00:54:46,651
and we all prayed,
well,

956
00:54:46,651 --> 00:54:48,970
we,
we want to be at the top of the heap for

957
00:54:48,971 --> 00:54:53,971
that whole period of time.
However,

958
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:59,820
you can't stand up the beaches edge and 
an order that tied not to get your feet 

959
00:54:59,981 --> 00:55:00,820
wet,
you know,

960
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:04,860
so change is inevitable.
And uh,

961
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:10,850
what we have to do is to find a 
constructive ways to allow change to 

962
00:55:13,421 --> 00:55:18,421
occur.
It doesn't threaten our position and 

963
00:55:18,421 --> 00:55:19,270
there's every reason by the way,
that we ought to be able to do that.

964
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:21,200
I mean,
uh,

965
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:26,350
certainly the tech technical change that
we see in the last,

966
00:55:26,351 --> 00:55:28,870
uh,
couple of decades has been led by us.

967
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:32,730
We've created the instability onto the,
you know,

968
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:37,800
the technological front.
So it serves our purposes to be in the 

969
00:55:38,051 --> 00:55:43,051
vanguard of change where it's positive.
We just have to figure out where is it 

970
00:55:43,901 --> 00:55:45,520
positive negative.
Now,

971
00:55:45,521 --> 00:55:50,521
in the case of Iran,
think it's been a long time since there 

972
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:53,910
is the great,
it's a,

973
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:55,740
as a,
you know,

974
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,240
Syria recently,
it's certainly been the Ottoman Empire,

975
00:55:59,241 --> 00:56:03,680
which not version Syria was a,
was a Ottoman province.

976
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:07,040
It was packed up by a

977
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:09,060
Yay

978
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,540
at the end of World War One.
And,

979
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:16,720
and by the way,
Lebanon was created separately.

980
00:56:16,721 --> 00:56:21,721
I mean,
Syria considers Lebanon a Serbian 

981
00:56:21,721 --> 00:56:21,721
province,

982
00:56:21,721 --> 00:56:22,030
Christian French enclave,
right?

983
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:25,920
So,
uh,

984
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,120
this,
this,

985
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:33,230
the question you asked requires 
sophistication in the answering.

986
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,730
It required sophistication in the 
asking,

987
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:39,400
but uh,
so,

988
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:45,240
so statesmen are judged by their ability
to recognize what change is coming 

989
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:50,740
anyway and running around and getting in
front of it.

990
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:55,980
Right?
That's how we define statesmanship and 

991
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:58,600
cheap politicians are defined as people 
who don't understand,

992
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:04,130
don't understand besides the depth I've 
sat here and,

993
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:08,590
and mind you for wisdom on current 
affairs and wisdom on the Vietnam War.

994
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:13,591
At no point did I ask you about the 
drama though of flying hundreds of 

995
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:17,730
missions into that situation and what I 
would assume was a,

996
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:22,750
a more tense situation as,
as a anti air defenses got stronger and 

997
00:57:22,871 --> 00:57:27,871
stronger.
This is the understated question of all 

998
00:57:27,871 --> 00:57:31,471
time,
but can you describe to me just for a 

999
00:57:31,471 --> 00:57:31,471
second what the heck?
I mean,

1000
00:57:31,471 --> 00:57:33,760
when you look back on it,
I did things that were nothing like what

1001
00:57:33,761 --> 00:57:34,750
you did and I think,
God,

1002
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:39,751
I was crazy.
And do you ever look back on that and 

1003
00:57:39,751 --> 00:57:42,691
just think to yourself,
was that a different person or is it 

1004
00:57:42,691 --> 00:57:43,690
like yesterday for you?
Do you miss it?

1005
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:51,960
Combat is partly because of Hubris.
I mean,

1006
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:58,260
I was arrogant.
Still am probably.

1007
00:57:58,261 --> 00:58:00,180
I mean,
my friends,

1008
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:05,480
my friends say I was arrogant,
but when I did a strapped into an 

1009
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,750
airplane,
I don't think anybody can beat me.

1010
00:58:06,751 --> 00:58:07,990
So,
uh,

1011
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I never was a,
for me it wasn't a matter of bravery or 

1012
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:18,531
courage to go out there because I,
I knew I was going to kick the crap out 

1013
00:58:19,411 --> 00:58:22,140
of the other guy rather than the 
reverse.

1014
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:26,540
So for me,
combat I food 285 combat region.

1015
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:28,710
Uh,
I loved every,

1016
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:32,250
every minute of it and I miss it.
I mean,

1017
00:58:32,251 --> 00:58:34,320
it's really,
really fun.

1018
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:38,030
Uh,
and it's hard to explain.

1019
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:41,340
I mean,
I am a professional warrior,

1020
00:58:41,341 --> 00:58:42,220
you know,
so that's,

1021
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,480
that's what I was cut out to do and I 
enjoyed it a lot.

1022
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:49,370
And I'm going to recommend that people 
read your books to get a really,

1023
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:54,310
a more detailed version of everything we
were just talking about general.

1024
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,180
Uh,
did I,

1025
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:57,580
did I ask everything you would like to 
talk about?

1026
00:58:57,581 --> 00:59:00,070
Is there anything that you'd like to 
bring up that I left out?

1027
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:06,220
No,
this has been a pretty wide ranging 

1028
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:06,230
conversation and more philosophical 
then.

1029
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:09,390
And uh,
I'm uh,

1030
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,980
equipped to deal with you.
Ask Your questions or are too good.

1031
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,760
I mean,
nobody had including your,

1032
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:18,550
this,
uh,

1033
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:24,240
you spoke to the Peloponnesian wars.
Nobody has the answers to these 

1034
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,350
questions and they're not,
it's not good to ask her professional,

1035
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,740
a military guy.
You got to.

1036
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,390
These are questions for the philosophy 
professor.

1037
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:37,400
Not For me,
but certainly it's been as wide ranging 

1038
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,710
as I could desire.
And,

1039
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,240
and,
and more so than I'm pretty,

1040
00:59:41,241 --> 00:59:43,070
uh,
any good at handling

1041
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:45,010
general,
you appreciate yourself.

1042
00:59:45,011 --> 00:59:47,620
I tailored those questions after 
watching you talk.

1043
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:52,650
And I think you're absolutely.
And you know what's funny is when I met 

1044
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:52,650
General Maddis,
I thought that's how he thought to.

1045
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,420
You're very well versed in wide ranging 
yourself.

1046
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:57,080
Dan.
Thanks very much.

1047
00:59:57,081 --> 00:59:58,510
I enjoyed talking to you buddy.

1048
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:07,860
My thanks to General Mcpeak for coming 
on the program and putting up with my 

1049
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:09,220
traditionally unusual and long winded 
questions.

1050
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:12,670
His books are available everywhere.
We willing to.

1051
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:14,320
Some of them on our website.
His latest,

1052
01:00:14,321 --> 01:00:16,240
as I said,
is roles and missions.

1053
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:20,830
Cataloging his time as the 14th chief of
staff of the air force.

1054
01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:26,130
He's a fascinating guy.
I think you can agree and I appreciate 

1055
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:26,130
him coming on the program.

1056
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:35,880
I am a true believer in the idea that 
reading makes you a more formidable 

1057
01:00:36,791 --> 01:00:41,380
version of you and it's hard to read 
these days,

1058
01:00:41,381 --> 01:00:45,970
isn't it?
To find time to devote to simply looking

1059
01:00:45,971 --> 01:00:48,430
at a page for hours.
It's wonderful.

1060
01:00:48,431 --> 01:00:49,960
I love it,
but it's hard to do,

1061
01:00:49,961 --> 01:00:51,340
isn't it?
In this busy world,

1062
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:56,690
a lot of people like to combine things 
they have to do with things they'd like 

1063
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:57,280
to do.
Got to drive somewhere in traffic.

1064
01:00:57,281 --> 01:01:02,281
Why not make yourself a more formidable 
version of you and enjoy a good book 

1065
01:01:03,011 --> 01:01:08,011
while you're doing it?
Cause you got to keep your hands on the 

1066
01:01:08,011 --> 01:01:08,011
wheel.
You got to keep your eyes on the road.

1067
01:01:08,011 --> 01:01:09,940
So let's make it an audio book and if 
you're going to do that,

1068
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:15,330
let's get it from audible.
The long running sponsors of this 

1069
01:01:15,341 --> 01:01:19,690
program who helped make it possible for 
you to educate yourself,

1070
01:01:19,691 --> 01:01:22,750
entertain yourself,
and read while you do something else.

1071
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:26,410
It would be hard to find anyone who's 
made it easier,

1072
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:30,370
figured out more angles and things that 
you would like as part of the process.

1073
01:01:30,371 --> 01:01:32,680
I mean,
you sign up for audible,

1074
01:01:32,681 --> 01:01:35,620
you get a free 30 day trial membership,
you'll get a free audio book.

1075
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:40,920
You sign up for good.
They just keep coming and audibles 

1076
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,490
figured out a way to do this better than
anyone else.

1077
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:44,230
I mean,
take for example,

1078
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:49,530
they're whisper sync for voice aspect of
this whole thing where you can switch 

1079
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:54,630
back and forth between reading texts and
listening to the audio book across a 

1080
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:57,610
whole bunch of devices.
I mean you're reading on your kindle and

1081
01:01:57,611 --> 01:02:02,611
then you have to leave.
So you go into your car and you'll 

1082
01:02:02,611 --> 01:02:02,611
listen in there.
You get out of your car,

1083
01:02:02,611 --> 01:02:04,420
your Amazon Echo,
place it right from where you left off.

1084
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:05,650
That's pretty cool,
isn't it?

1085
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:11,160
Don't miss a word.
You can share a book from your library 

1086
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:16,170
with anyone.
If it's their first time accepting a 

1087
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:18,481
book and they can listen to it for free 
and you own your books.

1088
01:02:18,611 --> 01:02:19,350
This is key.
Me.

1089
01:02:19,351 --> 01:02:21,180
I don't want to buy something and then 
not own it.

1090
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:26,690
With audible.
You own the books that you purchase 

1091
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:26,880
through them now.
What books should you purchase?

1092
01:02:26,881 --> 01:02:27,510
Well,
of course,

1093
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,660
whatever you think is going to make a 
more formidable you,

1094
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:36,170
but for me,
I am just addicted to reading the 

1095
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:39,060
accounts of participants in things like 
the extremes of the human experience.

1096
01:02:39,061 --> 01:02:40,170
I mean,
take for example,

1097
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:43,440
I'm Tony Mcphee,
who we just had on the four star general

1098
01:02:43,441 --> 01:02:48,441
love that stuff,
but at Vietnam is not your thing or 

1099
01:02:48,441 --> 01:02:48,441
you're more of a land war person.
Well,

1100
01:02:48,441 --> 01:02:51,810
how about war as I knew it by General 
George Patton,

1101
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:57,200
probably the most famous,
arguably the most famous second world 

1102
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:57,200
war US general.

1103
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:02,120
This book is a little different because 
it is his remembrances and stuff out of 

1104
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:06,381
his diary,
but he died before the actual work that 

1105
01:03:06,381 --> 01:03:06,540
he was going to put together,
came out,

1106
01:03:06,541 --> 01:03:09,990
but it's about as close as you can get.
The narrator even sounds a little patent

1107
01:03:09,991 --> 01:03:10,680
issue.
I mean,

1108
01:03:10,681 --> 01:03:15,681
if you want the definitive account that 
exists from general George s dot 

1109
01:03:15,681 --> 01:03:17,520
patents,
own written words,

1110
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:19,860
go get wars.
I knew that if you're a military history

1111
01:03:19,861 --> 01:03:22,050
person,
it should be on your bookshelf anyway.

1112
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:24,840
If you are a person who does a lot of 
driving,

1113
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:27,540
who can listen to books while they work,
well,

1114
01:03:27,541 --> 01:03:32,541
then maybe you need the audible version 
to war as I knew it by General George 

1115
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:36,700
Patton.
Go pick that 

1116
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:37,821

forward slash hardcore history and you 

1117
01:03:37,821 --> 01:03:39,060
know,
basically virtually digitally.

1118
01:03:39,061 --> 01:03:42,240
Tell him I sent you.
You can also text all one word,
