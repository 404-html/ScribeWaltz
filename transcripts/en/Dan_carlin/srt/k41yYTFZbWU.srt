1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,140
How much time do you put into explaining
the development of a gap?

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,400
That's a perfect example of the sort of 
question that bedeviled us in this 

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,930
episode,
which covers by the way a ridiculously 

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,260
short span of time,
but one of the most important,

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,340
let's just say month or so's in human 
history.

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,540
It represents the greatest mass 
outpouring of organized violence that 

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,521
the world had ever seen and I don't 
think there's ever been anything quite 

8
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:33,521
like it.
You know,

9
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:38,231
the Second World War begins with a 
German attack on Poland and fighting 

10
00:00:38,231 --> 00:00:40,010
between Germany and Poland.
That's over rather quickly and it's like

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,830
eight months before the major powers 
actually come to blows.

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,570
This war starts with all the major 
powers coming to blows head on instantly

13
00:00:47,571 --> 00:00:52,571
on multiple fronts with casualties that 
no one had ever even seen in their 

14
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:56,801
wildest dreams.
At the same time at speed.

15
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,370
And I started to realize as the program,
you know,

16
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,570
it was happening that you can't get into
the minds of the people in the human 

17
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:13,431
stories and the drama in the story 
without getting into the military 

18
00:01:13,431 --> 00:01:13,431
affairs.
And it's.

19
00:01:13,431 --> 00:01:16,770
It's day to day progression because 
that's the driving force.

20
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,130
That's what sets the timeline,
that's what determines the turn in 

21
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,330
fortune and that's what creates,
you know,

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,400
the human impact on the ground.
When we quote a reporter talking about 

23
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:31,860
what it looks like in the hospitals in 
France,

24
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,820
there's a reason that the hospitals are 
full of hurt people and that's because 

25
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,450
the events on the ground continue to 
dictate what's going on,

26
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,480
but the military affairs are complex as 
all get out.

27
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,950
How much time do you spend on a gap mean
the battle of the Marne,

28
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:53,991
right?
The famous miracle on the Marne is 

29
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:53,991
determined by this gap in the enemy 
line.

30
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:56,730
How much time do you spend on?
You know why there's a gap.

31
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:58,890
I mean,
if that really is a war,

32
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:01,980
losing situation to have developed,
you get into that.

33
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:02,850
Well,
if you get into that,

34
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,030
you're starting to follow a line of 
detail that just will take you off into 

35
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,060
the weeds.
The difficult story to decide when to go

36
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:12,480
off into the weeds and when to stay put 
on the main road.

37
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,710
This is our attempt at explaining this 
most complex and yet,

38
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,320
you know,
filled with human drama and great events

39
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:27,321
and larger than life figures and really 
a changing of the guard in terms of,

40
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,940
you know,
one century to another as best as we can

41
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:37,941
do it.
The Dan Carlin approach to the first 

42
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:39,200
world war,
it's called blueprint for Armageddon and

43
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,080
this is part two,

44
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,100
be some bus seven,
19,

45
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,160
41 date which will live in infamy.

46
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,020
It's history.

47
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,890
Perfect.

48
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,870
The events

49
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,660
that dude

50
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,880
figure it out from this time and place.
I take pride in the words,

51
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,620
been the Alina,
tear down the drama.

52
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:29,910
Hi,

53
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,760
welcome.
This kind of examination because people 

54
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,620
have got to know whether or not their 
question well,

55
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,590
I'm not a crop if we dig deep in art,
history and art and remember that we are

56
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:48,960
not descended from fearful of man.

57
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:57,110
It's hardcore history.
What year did humankind acquire the 

58
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,280
capability to destroy itself?
I think that's an interesting idea,

59
00:04:09,411 --> 00:04:14,411
isn't it?
The idea that every civilization in the 

60
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:18,671
universe,
if it continues to progress 

61
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:21,131
technologically down the road,
we'll reach a period when it can kill 

62
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:23,030
itself,
either on purpose or accidentally.

63
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:30,430
This fits into something,
some physicists theories on what's 

64
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:35,510
called the Fermi paradox,
and this idea of reaching a danger point

65
00:04:35,511 --> 00:04:38,990
in your civilization is called the great
filter.

66
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,220
The fermi paradox is a famous paradox 
that was,

67
00:04:43,221 --> 00:04:48,221
um,
initially talked about supposedly by a 

68
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,951
bunch of the great physicists in the 
world on their lunch break where they 

69
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:54,251
had done the math,
trying to figure out the possibilities 

70
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:55,100
of intelligent life being elsewhere in 
the universe.

71
00:04:55,101 --> 00:05:00,101
And the math is so overwhelmingly in 
favor of the idea that there must be 

72
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:01,970
right.
There's hundreds of billions of stars in

73
00:05:01,971 --> 00:05:06,971
our galaxy,
hundreds of billions of galaxies in the 

74
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:06,971
universe.
It just seems like a slam dunk,

75
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:08,930
right?
So then Enrico Fermi,

76
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:12,410
famously one of the great physicist ever
famously then says to the group,

77
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:16,070
so where is everybody?
And that's the Fermi paradox.

78
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:18,350
If the math says they should be there,
but they're not there,

79
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,000
what's the reason they're not there?

80
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:25,090
And that's where the great filter comes 
in because some of these people who 

81
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,571
study this stuff have suggested that 
there might be a point in every 

82
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:33,250
intelligent civilizations development 
where they acquire this ability to 

83
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,851
destroy themselves and have to get 
through the period where they have that 

84
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:40,220
capability and get to the point where 
they figure out how not to do that.

85
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,090
And it's kind of like a pass fail test 
for intelligence,

86
00:05:44,091 --> 00:05:48,560
civilizational growth everywhere in the 
universe and sort of by its very nature,

87
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:53,561
most civilizations don't pass it.
And so maybe that's the reason they're 

88
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:53,960
not all out there.

89
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,620
And guys like Nick Bostrom who study,
you know,

90
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,130
global catastrophic risk and stuff like 
that.

91
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:02,270
And you know,
what,

92
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:07,271
if a comment hit the planet,
what if nanotechnology goes out of 

93
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:07,271
control?
I mean,

94
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:10,211
it looks at all these issues.
He suggests that the earth entered this 

95
00:06:10,211 --> 00:06:13,511
civilizational phase,
this great filter period in our own 

96
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:16,070
history in 1945 when the atomic bombs 
were first used.

97
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:22,030
Now I think about this in terms of the 
first world war because I think that's 

98
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:28,481
when people first realized that human 
beings had acquired a military 

99
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:33,011
capability that was frightening,
not frightening because your enemy had 

100
00:06:33,011 --> 00:06:34,160
it frightening because human beings had 
it.

101
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,960
You can go back and look at history and 
there are lots of times when people were

102
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:43,961
afraid of the deadliness of weapons,
but they were afraid of the deadliness 

103
00:06:43,961 --> 00:06:47,651
of weapons either because they were 
afraid themselves of getting killed or 

104
00:06:47,651 --> 00:06:47,870
their country of getting taken over 
whatever.

105
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:53,020
They weren't afraid for the species.
They weren't afraid for civilization as 

106
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:55,250
a whole.
In the closest you'll see,

107
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,600
um,
you know,

108
00:06:56,601 --> 00:07:01,601
with that coming is you'll have like a 
Mongol invasion or invasion from the 

109
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:01,601
step and it,
it,

110
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:05,210
it,
it strikes the subtle civilizations a 

111
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,890
bit like a wave and it washes up a 
certain amount of civilization up on the

112
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:10,700
beach,
but it doesn't destroy everything in the

113
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:15,701
19th century.
That's the first time period where you 

114
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:19,391
can read writings from people who are 
asserting that maybe what they're 

115
00:07:19,391 --> 00:07:21,350
developing battlefield capability wise 
can destroy everything.

116
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,640
Now their version of everything is a 
little bit different than ours.

117
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,790
When we talk about things like 
existential risk,

118
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,760
we're talking about the survival of life
on the planet.

119
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:36,170
That's a post atomic you no idea of what
existential risk means.

120
00:07:36,171 --> 00:07:36,920
We understand,
you know,

121
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:41,921
you have a nuclear war amongst all the 
great powers and you can kiss life on 

122
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:45,080
earth goodbye or certainly our level of 
civilization.

123
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,620
You've heard that phrase bomb someone 
back to the stone age.

124
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,380
What we modern people have the 
capability to do that,

125
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:55,040
right?
But it was in the 19th century that the,

126
00:07:55,130 --> 00:08:00,130
that the idea that that's what a major 
war between the major powers might 

127
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,210
amount to.
That's when that idea takes hold.

128
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:07,450
Those people are worried about 
definition number two of existential 

129
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,240
threat.
You know,

130
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:10,250
guys like Nick Bostrom have two 
definitions.

131
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:13,130
One is the one we think about wiped out 
life on earth,

132
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,670
but the other definition of what an 
existential threat is,

133
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,240
is being knocked back down a few rungs 
on your level of civilization and then 

134
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:26,750
never finding your way back to your 
former greatness.

135
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,430
You know to have a statue of liberty in 
the sand moment design,

136
00:08:32,431 --> 00:08:35,360
I like to call it where you look up and 
you see the statue of Liberty,

137
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:40,361
like in the planet of the apes coming 
out of the sand and you instantly 

138
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:43,271
realize in a blinding flash of light 
that you're living in an era that is off

139
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,620
the civilizational highs and that's what
the people writing in the late 19th,

140
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,680
early 20th century,
especially in places like Great Britain 

141
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,200
and the United States where everything 
seems just great.

142
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,830
Why don't we have to screw up with a war

143
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,960
and really nothing to gain and 
everything to lose.

144
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:03,020
Those people are writing about living in
a golden age that they believe is 

145
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:07,521
fragile and that these giant war 
machines that are equally deadly in 

146
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:10,890
terms of their abilities to kill people 
on the battlefield,

147
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,250
but also their ability to simply 
bankrupt the societies that have to 

148
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,091
maintain them is causing consternation 
and end the very weapons systems 

149
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:23,010
themselves and the arms races that 
they're having.

150
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,610
Create more opportunities for some sort 
of violent outbreak of war that will 

151
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:34,071
then see these things employed.
The funny thing about human history,

152
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:38,790
if you study military history,
is that up until about 200 years ago,

153
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:44,090
you can imagine armies from a very long 
time ago fighting and beating armies 

154
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:47,040
from.
Not that long ago.

155
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:52,380
I mean Alexander the Great's Army I 
think beats the Carolingian army of 

156
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,100
Charlemagne,
which is,

157
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:58,370
you know,
a first rate army a thousand years 

158
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:58,370
later,
I don't think they must.

159
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:03,290
The Macedonians must their hair.
I mean there are books like Arthur 

160
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:03,290
Pharaohs,
the origins of war,

161
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:08,260
where that,
that credible historian can't help but 

162
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,541
play with the battle of Waterloo 
inserting Alexander and his Macedonians 

163
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:15,770
from the thirties bce in the place of 
Napoleon and his French sending the 

164
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,671
Macedonians up against the Duke of 
Wellington and his British and their 

165
00:10:19,671 --> 00:10:23,571
coalition allies and having Alexander in
the Macedonians do at least as well as 

166
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:26,310
Napoleon.
So what does that show you?

167
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,220
Well,
it shows you how all of human military 

168
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,761
history changes at about the time of the
Napoleonic wars because all of a sudden 

169
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,340
a new law of historical nature takes 
over,

170
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,640
which says that earlier armies do not 
beat later.

171
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,480
Armies mean the rules changed a thousand
percent.

172
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,800
First of all,
think about today,

173
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,980
if you took the US army from today,
how to fight a battle against the US 

174
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,360
army of 1945.
Today's US army destroys that Second 

175
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
World War Army,
mid 20th century army and maybe doesn't 

176
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,010
lose a man when they do it,
but that 19,

177
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:06,480
45 us army would defeat easily any army 
from the first world war.

178
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,960
Any army from the first world war of the
major powers would easily defeat the 

179
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,190
United States in the US civil war and 
those civil war armies,

180
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,450
if they went back to waterloo,
you know,

181
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:21,470
beat Napoleon.
So that's sort of the rule of the law of

182
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:24,930
technological battlefield development 
for the last 200 years.

183
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:30,080
And that's what the people in this story
have had to try to suck up and 

184
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,231
understand.
In 1700 some ruler can decide on a new 

185
00:11:33,231 --> 00:11:35,190
musket design and not change it for 100 
years.

186
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,760
And he still probably okay.
In the 19th century,

187
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,540
if you miss 15 years of development in 
rifle technology,

188
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,870
you might lose a war because of that.
I mean,

189
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:50,871
think about something like the naval 
arms races and how this just destroyed 

190
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,590
everybody's treasuries and everything 
else,

191
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:58,020
but at the beginning of the 18 hundreds 
you are using ship of the line type 

192
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,120
stuff.
I mean,

193
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,480
you know,
the same naval technology of giant 

194
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,840
wooden ships with cannons all in the 
side that's been the way things had been

195
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:09,841
done for a couple centuries and when you
build a ship and spend all that money 

196
00:12:09,841 --> 00:12:11,500
and all that time,
it's good for a long time.

197
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:14,710
If it doesn't get destroyed in battle,
that ship conserve you for 20,

198
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:17,080
30 years and just be fine.
Great investment.

199
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:20,470
Pay off over time.
If you amortize and call siloed over the

200
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,260
decades,
um,

201
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,940
that goes away at the end of the 19th 
century.

202
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:25,810
And yet

203
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:32,100
the cost explodes.
You look at a battleship from 1900 and 

204
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,110
it doesn't look like anything from 
Napoleon's time.

205
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:37,090
It looked like a thoroughly modern 
battleship.

206
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:42,091
The problem is is technology is changing
so fast now that in the time it takes 

207
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:46,681
you to design that new battleship,
the two or so years it takes to build 

208
00:12:46,681 --> 00:12:50,551
and launch and finish it,
it may be outdated by the time it's 

209
00:12:50,551 --> 00:12:53,851
ready to be used.
You take a first class,

210
00:12:54,261 --> 00:12:56,090
first rate,
you know,

211
00:12:56,091 --> 00:13:01,091
fleet from a global power in 1914 and 
you pitted in battle against a first 

212
00:13:01,641 --> 00:13:04,970
rate top of the line fleet from a mere 
14 years ago,

213
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:10,630
and the one from 1914 destroys the one 
from 1900 and maybe doesn't lose a major

214
00:13:11,451 --> 00:13:13,220
surface vessel while doing so.

215
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:19,970
That is mind boggling to the people who 
lived back then because that means if 

216
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:24,021
you can't keep up technologically with 
what your neighbor is doing at great 

217
00:13:24,021 --> 00:13:27,771
expense,
you can negate all the money you spent 

218
00:13:27,771 --> 00:13:30,180
on that fleet in the first place.
Better to not have that fleet from 1900.

219
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:35,420
If you're just gonna lose the whole 
thing and not even sink one of your 

220
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,241
enemies ships.
The need to keep up with the killing 

221
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:41,721
power of everyone else was impacting the
treasuries of these countries in ways 

222
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:46,850
that created just as big of a threat to 
their continued existence as the threat 

223
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,890
of all these dangerous armies did.
There was a catch 22 for them.

224
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:55,070
Take the role that the Russian czar 
found himself in in 18,

225
00:13:55,351 --> 00:14:00,351
98,
a guy named Nicholas the second maybe 

226
00:14:00,351 --> 00:14:00,351
the single most powerful person on the 
planet,

227
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,170
he's got a shaky regime,
is a lot of revolution.

228
00:14:04,171 --> 00:14:08,010
There's a lot of discontent and a lot of
it is exacerbated by the costs of trying

229
00:14:08,011 --> 00:14:12,030
to keep up a modern military and even 
with all these costs,

230
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,120
he's falling behind rushes to 
illiterate.

231
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:22,590
It's industries are too small.
It's society still needs so much 

232
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,240
modernization before it can keep up with
places like Germany and France and Great

233
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,240
Britain and even the United States.
The problem is is that the czars power 

234
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,441
is all in the country's size and the 
population and that's becoming less and 

235
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:39,151
less important as technology begins to 
determine who wins and who loses 

236
00:14:39,151 --> 00:14:43,231
battles,
and that's being demonstrated all 

237
00:14:43,231 --> 00:14:45,481
through the 19th century as these small 
colonial armies from the technologically

238
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:50,671
sophisticated powers destroys,
sometimes giant armies of tribal natives

239
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,340
all over the world.

240
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,690
I mean that line,
a famous one that says whatever happens,

241
00:14:56,691 --> 00:15:01,691
we have got the maximum gun and they 
have not is about using machine guns on 

242
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:07,090
tribal peoples.
The Russian czar is looking ahead and 

243
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,830
seeing that if he can't keep up with 
this technological arms race,

244
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:12,530
that seems to be never ending and 
endlessly expensive.

245
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,040
The Russians are just going to be the 
new tribal peoples and yet he has to 

246
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,871
have this modern military machine 
because if his adversaries have it and 

247
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:24,740
he doesn't,
he's going to lose any war he gets into.

248
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,920
He loses his dynasty potentially.
Either way.

249
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,340
How do you get out of a mess like that?
In 18,

250
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:36,341
98?
The Russians are things he finds a way 

251
00:15:36,341 --> 00:15:40,480
and he issues a public invitation to 
representatives from the other great 

252
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,420
powers who are one degree or another in 
the same boat he's into.

253
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,300
No one knows what the next major war 
will look like,

254
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:54,570
but everybody's had a chance to see some
minor wars in the meantime and if you 

255
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,530
sort of extrapolate what what they were 
telling you,

256
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,050
the next war is going to be horrifying.
And Nicholas,

257
00:15:59,051 --> 00:16:04,051
the second was actually reading the Guy 
who turned out to be one of the most 

258
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:07,800
accurate prognosticators of what the 
next war was going to be like we talked 

259
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,590
about in the last show.
I've been blocked.

260
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,980
Nicholas.
The second is reading Ivan Block and 

261
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,610
blocks predictions are horrific.
So the czar wants out.

262
00:16:15,611 --> 00:16:20,611
He wants.
He wants to figure out a way to stop 

263
00:16:20,611 --> 00:16:22,591
this dangerous cycle that the modern 
world seems to be forcing all the great 

264
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:26,371
powers into.
And I think it's a wonderful sort of 

265
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:29,910
commentary on the attitude of the Times 
that these guys thought that they could 

266
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:33,841
do this.
It looks like rainbows and Unicorns to 

267
00:16:33,841 --> 00:16:33,841
we modern people,
but to then they must have thought,

268
00:16:33,841 --> 00:16:36,370
reasonable people can sit down over 
cigars and whiskey.

269
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,220
See this dynamic that we've got 
ourselves caught up in,

270
00:16:39,221 --> 00:16:44,221
realized that it's in no one's interest 
in reasonable people can figure a way 

271
00:16:44,221 --> 00:16:45,220
out of this,
and in 18,

272
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:50,221
98,
the czar of Russia proposed something 

273
00:16:50,221 --> 00:16:51,070
that will be called The Hague conference
to deal with this.

274
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,970
There are many ways to look at the 18,
Ninety Nine Hague conference and 

275
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,750
there'll be another one in 1907 by the 
way,

276
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:05,470
and truthfully it looks like an early 
version of arms control agreement.

277
00:17:05,881 --> 00:17:07,610
You will see throughout the 20th 
century,

278
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,120
which you can also view through multiple
lenses.

279
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,550
The first one is you can take it at face
value.

280
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,490
The way the czar sold it,
you know,

281
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:21,491
if you want to use modern terms,
the czars pr people when he issues this 

282
00:17:21,491 --> 00:17:23,150
invitation to the rest of the world 
leaders,

283
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,200
you know,
couches.

284
00:17:24,201 --> 00:17:28,520
This whole thing as a common sense 
effort at a high minded idea.

285
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,410
He says,
the goal of this conference,

286
00:17:30,411 --> 00:17:35,411
he wants to put together as quote,
seeking to make the great idea of 

287
00:17:35,411 --> 00:17:37,430
universal peace,
triumph over the elements of trouble and

288
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:42,431
discord and quote,
we might sell an arms control conference

289
00:17:43,421 --> 00:17:46,690
today like that.
This is the era where you really see for

290
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,980
the first time in human history the 
growth of what today we would

291
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,980
call the international peace movement.
It's had many conferences before the 

292
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,721
Hague conference to promote these ideas 
and there was a general feeling of 

293
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:02,430
progress on these issues and so the czar
may have been playing into that.

294
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:05,190
Although the tsar was kind of an 
interesting dude.

295
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:10,220
I'm very much a similar role on the 
monarchy dice as the Germans got with 

296
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,170
Kaiser Wilhelm,
a very mediocre sort of guy,

297
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:18,171
not the sort of person you could imagine
ever getting this job if it were merit 

298
00:18:18,171 --> 00:18:18,540
based.
He's the same czar,

299
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,520
the last czar,
by the way,

300
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,900
who will fall victim and under sort of 
the sway of the person that is sometimes

301
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:27,150
called the mad monk,
Gregory Rasputin.

302
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,710
Although he's more interesting than 
that.

303
00:18:28,711 --> 00:18:30,030
It probably deserves more credit than 
that,

304
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,360
but it kind of again shows you the Zar 
as a kind of an idealistic romantic.

305
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,110
I mean he might have bought into this 
stuff.

306
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,090
It might be legitimate on the czar's 
part,

307
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,930
but like most arms control agreements,
there's a real politic side to this 

308
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:50,001
thing.
The czar knows that his armies are 

309
00:18:50,001 --> 00:18:50,340
falling behind in this technological 
race.

310
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,460
The old line about arms control 
agreements is if you're losing an arms 

311
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,340
race,
it's a good time to have an arms control

312
00:18:56,341 --> 00:19:01,341
agreement and when the powers that are 
invited to this Hague conference asked 

313
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:03,750
for clarification of what's on the 
agenda,

314
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,990
the tsar and his people give them eight 
or nine points that are going to be 

315
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,201
goals of the conference and the eight or
nine points to a 21st century mind are 

316
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:17,061
fascinating because it really shows you 
what the czar wants to come out of this 

317
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:18,540
conference.
The is number two goal,

318
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,780
for example,
that the agenda gives to the rest of the

319
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:26,781
participants says quote,
to prohibit the use in the armies and 

320
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:29,190
fleets of any new kinds of firearms,
whatever,

321
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,970
and have new explosives or any powders 
more powerful than those.

322
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,920
Now we use either for rifles or Canon 
and quote,

323
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:43,380
now this is a staple to some degree of 
arms control agreements ever since.

324
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:48,381
I mean if the US and the Soviet Union or
having an arms control agreement or an 

325
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:49,290
anti ballistic missile agreement or 
whatever,

326
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,290
they may have rules on technological 
progress,

327
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,520
but they aren't trying to stop all 
technological progress.

328
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:01,410
What the czar wants to do is freeze 
things where they are.

329
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:07,220
He doesn't want any more research to 
increase the killing power that already 

330
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,170
exist in militaries.
He doesn't want any more deployment.

331
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:15,650
If you accidentally discover that new 
battleship gun that will shoot twice as 

332
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,740
far as your current one,
you can't deploy it.

333
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,890
He wants the size of armies frozen and 
then reduced.

334
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,100
He wants the size of military budgets 
frozen and then reduced.

335
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:28,610
This is a person who clearly shows that 
his main issue with the way things are 

336
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:34,220
is the pace of change and he wants this 
conference to address it now to modern 

337
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:39,891
people who will often freak out if the 
promised phone upgrade that's supposed 

338
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:45,201
to be released today is late.
You know the Internet will blow up with 

339
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:46,290
angry people who have had their pace of 
change sabotaged.

340
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,280
The people in the late 19th

341
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,280
century can probably be forgiven for 
thinking something we will assume is 

342
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,941
impossible is possible.
The first time I ever encountered this 

343
00:20:56,941 --> 00:20:59,530
idea by the way,
was in James Burke's wonderful TV series

344
00:20:59,531 --> 00:21:04,531
from the 19 eighties of the day.
The universe changed where he asked the 

345
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:04,930
question,
if humankind looks,

346
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:10,140
you know,
down the road we're a particular branch 

347
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,751
of knowledge seems to be taking them.
Can they decide if they don't like the 

348
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:15,280
destination to just not learn that 
branch of knowledge at all or to wall it

349
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,640
off so that no one learns it to modern 
people.

350
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:21,670
That sounds impossible to people in the 
late 19th century.

351
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:26,671
They would have been able to show you 
multiple historical examples where that 

352
00:21:26,671 --> 00:21:30,241
had been done.
The Catholic Church was very good at it 

353
00:21:30,241 --> 00:21:30,241
in medieval times.
For example,

354
00:21:30,241 --> 00:21:31,660
there have been Chinese emperors who 
could do it well.

355
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,230
Um,
the idea of creating forbidden knowledge

356
00:21:35,231 --> 00:21:40,231
and then preventing people from having 
it or using it was not unusual in this 

357
00:21:40,231 --> 00:21:41,800
time period.
That's what the czar wants.

358
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:47,950
He wants to slow or retard the pace of 
change and I always try to remind myself

359
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,520
how whipsawed all these people were in 
this time period by the pace of change 

360
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,421
too.
That's really what the 19th century is 

361
00:21:58,421 --> 00:21:59,840
the era where it all speeds up.
If you could,

362
00:21:59,841 --> 00:22:04,841
for example,
graph human technological progress the 

363
00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:07,850
way you would a stock market performance
graph starting at the beginning of human

364
00:22:07,851 --> 00:22:09,800
history ending yesterday,
you know,

365
00:22:09,801 --> 00:22:11,930
and having your ups and downs all 
throughout history,

366
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,970
you'd noticed a couple of things right 
off the bat.

367
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:18,230
The first thing you notice is that there
are ups and downs.

368
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:23,770
One thing the modern mind seems to find 
incomprehensible is that progress ever 

369
00:22:24,201 --> 00:22:28,090
moves backward.
The people who lived in 1900,

370
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:33,100
for example,
we're reading history books that made 

371
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,380
that sound like a historical law of 
nature.

372
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,540
They had every reason to believe that 
the era they were living in might be the

373
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,990
last of a golden age before a fall,
because after all,

374
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,320
that's what had happened to every other 
golden age that they look back on.

375
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:50,890
The first thing the modern mind sees 
when it looks at the historical stock 

376
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,240
performance charts showing human 
technological progress is that there's a

377
00:22:53,241 --> 00:22:57,230
bunny hop sort of dynamic going on two 
steps forward,

378
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,410
one step back.
You might get a big upturn.

379
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,560
You know when the new kingdom Egyptian 
come on the scene,

380
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,230
maybe another uptake when the Han 
Chinese arrive,

381
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:08,150
another uptick when the Roman Empire 
arrives,

382
00:23:08,151 --> 00:23:11,120
but after your Roman Empire highs,
you get your Roman Empire bubble,

383
00:23:11,121 --> 00:23:16,121
don't ya?
And a couple hundred years later when 

384
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:18,251
it's gone,
you have dramatic barbarians and 

385
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:20,681
formerly Roman territory looking up at 
crumbling aqua ducks and wondering what 

386
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:24,290
sort of giants once roamed the earth 
that could build stuff like that.

387
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:32,240
So the first thing you're gonna notice 
as a modern person is the technology 

388
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,571
doesn't always move forward.
The second thing you're going to notice 

389
00:23:35,571 --> 00:23:38,400
is the throughout most of human history,
whether it's going up or going down,

390
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,460
it's moving at a glacially slow pace.

391
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,160
The amount of change from the beginning 
of time too about

392
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:51,160
the renaissance is nowhere near what you
would expect if we were anywhere near 

393
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,271
the pace of change.
We have now very little overall growth 

394
00:23:55,271 --> 00:23:58,900
until you hit the renaissance and then 
you see a little uptick and then the 

395
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:58,900
century after that a little bit more,
and then about 18,

396
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,851
10 slash 1820,
the graph becomes almost vertical 

397
00:24:03,851 --> 00:24:07,781
overnight.
It shoots up and instead of ever 

398
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:07,781
plateauing,
as we all know,

399
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:10,880
it goes ever more vertical every day.
Now we're used to this because it's been

400
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:13,670
going that way for awhile.
The czars generation.

401
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,690
Yeah,
that century,

402
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,470
that's the first time it really takes 
off and those people are looking at that

403
00:24:18,471 --> 00:24:23,471
as an extremely destabilizing force.
The czar thinks perhaps an arms control 

404
00:24:23,471 --> 00:24:26,390
agreement will help Russia from falling 
too far behind.

405
00:24:26,391 --> 00:24:29,360
They're more technologically 
sophisticated neighbors now,

406
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:34,361
as you might expect,
they're more technologically 

407
00:24:34,361 --> 00:24:36,701
sophisticated.
Neighbors see this as an artificial 

408
00:24:36,701 --> 00:24:36,701
constraint on the fact that they're 
winning.

409
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:42,670
Take the Germans as a perfect example of
people who are trying very hard to make 

410
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:45,470
up for what they see as the rest of the 
power is treating them like dirt.

411
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:51,790
They're the ones building more ships 
than anybody and trying to catch up to 

412
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,521
Britain.
They're the ones modernizing their 

413
00:24:54,521 --> 00:24:56,321
military every day.
They're the ones who instead of being 

414
00:24:56,321 --> 00:24:58,160
panicked by the pace of change or taking
advantage of it to them,

415
00:24:58,161 --> 00:25:01,430
this looks like an agreement that will 
lock in their inferiority,

416
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:04,760
and by the way,
that's a situation that will repeat many

417
00:25:04,761 --> 00:25:07,370
times after this period in arms control 
negotiations,

418
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:12,110
trying to gain an edge on your opponent 
if you are losing the arms race,

419
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:17,111
as I said,
good time to have an arms control 

420
00:25:17,111 --> 00:25:17,111
agreement.
Finally,

421
00:25:17,111 --> 00:25:20,780
there's an interesting group of people 
and they really don't exist anymore.

422
00:25:20,781 --> 00:25:24,260
Not openly that are on the opposite side
of the ledger from say,

423
00:25:24,261 --> 00:25:26,720
the international peace movement.

424
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,610
That's,
you know,

425
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:32,620
ramping up during this era.
The people who think that war is a good 

426
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,830
thing,
forget about international,

427
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:39,590
you know,
goals or real politic people that 

428
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:42,131
literally believed that humankind 
thrives on war and without war we will 

429
00:25:42,131 --> 00:25:46,271
drown in materialism.
It's the only thing that keeps us 

430
00:25:46,271 --> 00:25:49,031
focused on the higher things.
That's an idea that has sort of gone by 

431
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:52,871
the wayside in Western culture today.
It's peace activists who argue against,

432
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,800
you know,
real politic people in the 18 eighties 

433
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,950
for example,
you have guys like the elder Helmut von 

434
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,320
Moltke who tries to explain to people 
why peace is not even a good idea.

435
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,640
You're diluted.
He said,

436
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:09,641
quote,
perpetual peace is a dream and not even 

437
00:26:09,641 --> 00:26:13,181
a beautiful dream,
and war is an integral part of God's 

438
00:26:13,181 --> 00:26:13,640
ordering of the universe.
In war,

439
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,040
man's noblest.
Virtues come into play.

440
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:21,190
Courage and renunciation,
fidelity to duty and a readiness for 

441
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,240
sacrifice that does not stop at giving 
up life itself.

442
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,480
Without war,
the world would be swamped in 

443
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,851
materialism and to quote others will 
point out that if you decide to try to 

444
00:26:32,151 --> 00:26:34,520
make war,
you know a thing of the past.

445
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:38,060
What happens to all those people that 
are in situations where you know they're

446
00:26:38,061 --> 00:26:40,340
struggling against four and oppression,
for example,

447
00:26:40,341 --> 00:26:44,220
you're going to tell someone they can't 
free themselves from a oppressor because

448
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,870
you know violence is bad,

449
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:52,480
but finally you also have the people 
that the modern peace activists would 

450
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,501
recognize very well.
Those who adhere to a belief system that

451
00:26:57,681 --> 00:27:01,820
is difficult to argue with in terms of 
you know historical proof.

452
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,190
You're going to use history as your 
guide.

453
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:09,610
You're going to argue that the best way 
to keep the peace is to be so strong 

454
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:12,470
that it is almost suicidal to fight with
you.

455
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:17,990
Best exemplified perhaps by British 
admiral Sir John Fisher,

456
00:27:17,991 --> 00:27:22,991
who tries to explain to a friend of his 
that when he sounds horrific,

457
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,750
he's really an advocate of peace and he 
said,

458
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,170
quote,

459
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,490
I am not for war.
I am for peace.

460
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:35,670
That is why I am for Supreme Navy.
Did I not write in your autograph book 

461
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,660
at The Hague,
the supremacy of the British navy as the

462
00:27:37,661 --> 00:27:39,550
best security for the peace of the 
world?

463
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:44,820
My sole object is peace.
What you call my truculence is all for 

464
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,470
peace if you rub it in both at home and 
abroad,

465
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:51,640
that you are ready for instant war with 
every unit of your strength in the first

466
00:27:51,641 --> 00:27:56,641
line and waiting to be first in and hit 
your enemy in the belly and kick him 

467
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:59,200
when he's down and boil your prisoners 
in oil.

468
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:02,140
If you take any and torture is women and
children,

469
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:05,350
then people will steer clear,
review and quote,

470
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,570
well,
as harsh as that is,

471
00:28:08,571 --> 00:28:11,990
it has a certain amount of historical 
evidence to back it up,

472
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:15,950
doesn't it?
When asked how to make war more humane,

473
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,090
the nephew of Helmut von Moltke,
the elder,

474
00:28:20,091 --> 00:28:25,091
that would be Helmut von Moltke,
the younger the field marshal in charge 

475
00:28:25,091 --> 00:28:27,170
of Germany's war effort at the start of 
the first world war famously said,

476
00:28:27,171 --> 00:28:30,080
the only way to make war humane is to 
make it short.

477
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,600
Hence the Schlieffen plan.

478
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,690
We talked about this so called 
Schlieffen plan.

479
00:28:37,691 --> 00:28:42,100
In the last episode of it.
It's the almost mythological prewar plan

480
00:28:42,101 --> 00:28:44,860
for how Germany was going to deal with 
this terrible to front problem.

481
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:51,040
My analogy is like a bar fight.
Isn't there a meme online that I saw is 

482
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,060
comparing world war one to a bar fight,
but it's a little like,

483
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:58,260
you know,
Germany knows it's going to have a bar 

484
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:58,730
fight with France and Russia,
but they know that France is going to be

485
00:28:58,731 --> 00:29:01,550
there five minutes before Russia,
so they get to the bar right on time,

486
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,400
knock France out and five minutes later 
when Russia shows up late,

487
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,240
they get to fight the Germans 
one-on-one.

488
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,210
That's the war plan in a nutshell,

489
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:14,570
but the questions surrounding this war 
plan have become maybe the number one 

490
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:19,431
most controversial issue that historians
argue with each other and froth at the 

491
00:29:19,431 --> 00:29:20,850
mouth over and yours truly.
You know,

492
00:29:20,851 --> 00:29:22,830
I don't have a dog in this fight.
I'm just gonna sit back,

493
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:28,190
eat popcorn and watch the very 
entertaining discussions on the 

494
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:31,710
Schlieffen so called Schlieffen plan 
because it's not just a this or that.

495
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,800
It's like a Kennedy assassination thing 
where,

496
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:38,100
I mean every different theory you can 
think of is out there.

497
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,110
There was a Schlieffen plan.
No,

498
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,920
there wasn't.
The schlieffen plan wasn't even planned,

499
00:29:41,921 --> 00:29:42,010
but

500
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,720
it was modified.
It was modified by Mocha.

501
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:45,200
Then why not call it the Schlieffen 
plan?

502
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:50,310
I may just goes on and on and on,
and the people often on multiple sides 

503
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,690
of this issue are very credible,
so I'm not getting.

504
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:55,570
It's like trying to weigh in on a 
discussion with scientists.

505
00:29:55,571 --> 00:29:57,190
You just have to sort of watch 
sometimes,

506
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,770
so I'm not going to take a position on 
this so culturally even plan,

507
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:04,890
and we'll call it the Schlieffen plan 
because that's what everybody knows it 

508
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,870
by them,
but suffice it to say this shall Ethan's

509
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,090
retired for quite a long time before the
first world war breaks out.

510
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,240
So whatever plan the Germans were going 
to use are in the hands of Helmut von 

511
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,570
Moltke.
The younger,

512
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,760
the guy who's leading this whole,
you know,

513
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:23,790
early war on the Germans part and he's 
been the one designing this plan for a 

514
00:30:23,861 --> 00:30:24,370
long time.

515
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,400
After the first world war is over,
you will get a bunch of German generals 

516
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,211
writing memoirs,
sort of castigating this multiple guy 

517
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,210
for deviating from Schlieffen is 
amazingly brilliant.

518
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:42,211
Plan is the way it was pronounced if 
you'd just stayed with the plan that 

519
00:30:42,211 --> 00:30:42,211
way.
It was supposed to be,

520
00:30:42,211 --> 00:30:44,320
you know,
we win the war and so it's worth talking

521
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:47,920
about the plan a little bit from a 
military history standpoint,

522
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,390
the sleep and plan,
and again I have to say as it's normally

523
00:30:52,391 --> 00:30:57,391
understood because somebody out there's 
going to have a very good piece of 

524
00:30:57,391 --> 00:30:58,540
evidence showing it was totally 
different than I'm saying right now,

525
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,840
but as it's as it's commonly understood,
the Schlieffen plan is a fantastic 

526
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,180
military gamble.
It involves taking troops from basically

527
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:12,210
everywhere else.
You might have to fight and taking as 

528
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,570
many of them as you can and sticking 
them on that one part.

529
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:18,570
That's going to be the sledge hammer.
The head of the sledgehammer and your 

530
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:22,981
superiority in numbers at the head of 
that sledge hammer is going to be so 

531
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:26,221
overwhelming.
It's going to crush everything and then 

532
00:31:26,221 --> 00:31:29,071
you can swing it around and trap all the
French armies that are sitting on the 

533
00:31:29,071 --> 00:31:29,720
French border.
You know,

534
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,930
waiting to fight the Germans on the 
other side of the German border.

535
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,540
But the head of the hammer's coming 
through Belgium,

536
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:40,650
a neutral country.
It's going to swing from above and then 

537
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:45,331
it's going to collapse down on all those
French armies facing the Germans and 

538
00:31:45,331 --> 00:31:48,640
trap them in the rear,
but it's a huge gamble.

539
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:53,970
What if you screw up?
What if the Russians mobilized faster 

540
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:54,700
than you think they're going to?
Well,

541
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:59,760
they'll be mowing down your tiny little 
forces left there to stop them and 

542
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,130
they're not that far from Berlin and the
first territory they're gonna take over,

543
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:06,610
happens to be the ancestral home of 
Prussian nobility,

544
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,760
including Kaiser Wilhelm,
so nobody wants to see the Russians 

545
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,721
anywhere near Prussia,
but they happened to be kind of near 

546
00:32:15,721 --> 00:32:15,721
Prussia anyway,
so that's a problem.

547
00:32:15,721 --> 00:32:20,130
Also,
everyone knows the French are going to 

548
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,621
want to retake those territories that 
the Germans took a generation before 

549
00:32:22,621 --> 00:32:23,320
which is down at the Franco German 
border,

550
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:25,360
which means the French are gonna attack 
there with a lot of forces.

551
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:27,010
You pull too many people away from 
there.

552
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:32,220
The French could be breaking through 
into southern Germany while the head of 

553
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,600
your sledge hammers still working its 
way around French flags.

554
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:34,300
I mean it's,
it's a.

555
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,340
it's a terrible gamble because if you 
screw it up,

556
00:32:36,341 --> 00:32:40,040
you could lose the war,
but let's remember things when she in

557
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,830
is writing the war plan and he 
supposedly came up with this idea.

558
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:48,020
The conditions are different.
The German army is different in size,

559
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,500
so was the French army.
The Russians have almost seen a complete

560
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:52,820
collapse in 19.
Oh,

561
00:32:52,821 --> 00:32:55,040
five of their whole dynasty mean they're
falling apart.

562
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:58,430
They just lost a war against Japan.
There are no where near as formidable as

563
00:32:58,431 --> 00:32:59,580
they'll be,
you know,

564
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,250
10 years later,
right?

565
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:06,280
Nine years later.
But that's when von Moltke has to deal 

566
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,131
with things and the situations are 
different and he has to recalculate 

567
00:33:09,131 --> 00:33:11,660
things and the second part of that whole
equation is sleeping and could afford to

568
00:33:11,661 --> 00:33:15,790
be a gambler because he doesn't actually
have to do it.

569
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:21,130
Schlieffen is a gambler on paper.
Mulch is a guy who has to make this work

570
00:33:21,131 --> 00:33:26,131
in real time and not have the downside 
happen and live through it and he's more

571
00:33:27,061 --> 00:33:32,061
of a pessimist maybe you would say more 
of a realist and he won't put as many 

572
00:33:33,541 --> 00:33:38,541
troops in the sledge hammer.
Part of the attack as Schlieffen would 

573
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:38,580
have dictated you should,

574
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:45,910
he won't denude the other fronts too,
is greater degree and leave them that 

575
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:50,621
wide open.
He can't assume that the war will be 

576
00:33:50,621 --> 00:33:54,101
one,
so automatically that you can just know 

577
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:54,750
that Germany will be safe and won't be 
broken through in all these areas you've

578
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:55,850
denuded,
in other words,

579
00:33:55,990 --> 00:34:00,320
mold because a more conservative guy.
But if this plan is true,

580
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,670
I'm going to keep saying that 
disclaimer,

581
00:34:01,671 --> 00:34:03,650
so don't get in trouble.
If this plan is true,

582
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,860
um,
it puts Mocha in a position of accepting

583
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,860
a gamble of a plan for a guy who's not a
gambler,

584
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:12,630
but that's the plan.

585
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,080
And in order to understand the sledge 
hammer side of this plan,

586
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,440
you have to have some sort of conception
of the size of the army's involved for 

587
00:34:22,931 --> 00:34:24,580
comparison purposes.
And again,

588
00:34:24,581 --> 00:34:28,750
it sort of demonstrates how much things 
have changed in a military sense and how

589
00:34:28,751 --> 00:34:33,751
they've exploded since napoleonic times.
If you look at assumptions made by 

590
00:34:34,211 --> 00:34:39,211
people who study the Roman Empire,
one of the favorite subjects that they 

591
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:42,871
will debate is how many human beings 
were in the military of the Roman Empire

592
00:34:43,571 --> 00:34:48,220
at its height to police and take care of
that massive ancient state,

593
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:53,730
and I don't mean in any one battle.
I mean the total military power of the 

594
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:58,440
Roman Empire at its height,
and you will get numbers anywhere from 

595
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,651
450,000
men at the low end and about 750,000

596
00:35:01,691 --> 00:35:06,691
men at the higher end.
Now the numbers of Germans that are 

597
00:35:08,351 --> 00:35:13,351
making their way through Belgium in 
August 1914 as part of the sledge 

598
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:19,011
hammers head is at least 750,000.
Some numbers put that up to a one point 

599
00:35:21,551 --> 00:35:25,530
$2 million.
That means that the flanking force,

600
00:35:25,531 --> 00:35:27,510
the head of the sledgehammers,
we keep calling it.

601
00:35:27,511 --> 00:35:30,780
That's moving through Belgium to smack 
the French like a door.

602
00:35:30,781 --> 00:35:35,781
Swinging on a hinge is at least as large
as the entire military of the Roman 

603
00:35:36,241 --> 00:35:41,241
empire at its.
And if those lower numbers are actually 

604
00:35:41,241 --> 00:35:44,940
closer to the truth for the empires 
total military capability,

605
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:49,560
than you might have a German army moving
through Belgium that's twice the size of

606
00:35:49,561 --> 00:35:51,180
the entire Roman empire at its height,

607
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:57,370
that totally justifies all of the worst 
fears of these people in the 19th 

608
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,340
century.
Worried about this,

609
00:35:58,341 --> 00:36:01,640
to kind of folks who would call a Hague 
conference and and write about peace and

610
00:36:01,641 --> 00:36:06,641
all that kind of stuff.
And the people who understood what the 

611
00:36:06,641 --> 00:36:06,641
growth in the military technology was 
going to do.

612
00:36:06,641 --> 00:36:10,400
I haven't blocks ideas are about to be 
proven true in no uncertain fashion.

613
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,770
I mean these people were used to 
Napoleon,

614
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,740
well,
Napoleon's in a giant gamble of invading

615
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:19,910
Russia may have had at its highest 
750,000

616
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,090
men across the entire front from a giant
front of Russia.

617
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:30,050
That's what you have moving through the 
tiny little road system and railroad 

618
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:33,801
system of Belgium.
Napoleon's grand army is your flanking 

619
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:35,250
force.
Wow.

620
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,750
No,
I keep trying to remind myself that what

621
00:36:39,751 --> 00:36:44,751
the Germans are trying to do here is not
perhaps as much of a of a weird gamble 

622
00:36:44,751 --> 00:36:48,831
as you might think,
and we also need to remember that most 

623
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:51,531
of the people in the higher leadership 
positions in the German military have 

624
00:36:51,531 --> 00:36:52,860
done all this before.
In fact,

625
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:58,220
they fought France before.
It's probably the most important war 

626
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:01,371
that happened between Napoleon's times 
and the first world war and most people 

627
00:37:01,371 --> 00:37:02,040
outside of Europe.
No,

628
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:04,410
nothing about the Franco Prussian war of
18,

629
00:37:04,411 --> 00:37:07,530
78 slash 71,
but essentially forget what it says,

630
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,300
you know,
in the history books because it makes it

631
00:37:09,301 --> 00:37:11,550
look like a nine month war.
Essentially.

632
00:37:11,551 --> 00:37:13,860
The Germans smash the French in a month 
and a half.

633
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,930
It's a fantastically interesting 
conflict and it's shaped the perceptions

634
00:37:18,931 --> 00:37:23,931
and views of these people in the higher 
leadership positions because they were 

635
00:37:23,931 --> 00:37:24,660
junior officers who fought in that war.
Right?

636
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:32,010
They watched two amazing things happen.
They watched the German army's trap and 

637
00:37:33,321 --> 00:37:36,580
entire French army of like 80,
90,000

638
00:37:36,581 --> 00:37:39,040
men in one of the French fortresses that
was there to,

639
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:44,320
you know,
keep the Germans from crossing the 

640
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,721
border.
And then the actual emperor Franz 

641
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:45,721
himself,
a guy named Napoleon,

642
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:50,281
the third,
another one of those interesting roles 

643
00:37:50,281 --> 00:37:50,380
of the monarchy dies,
leads a relief army.

644
00:37:50,381 --> 00:37:55,381
He's going to break the seeds,
right and rescue his other army of 

645
00:37:55,381 --> 00:37:57,961
another 80 or 90,000
guys and the Germans manage to surround 

646
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,620
the whole army with the emperor and 
forced them to surrender,

647
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,800
which then of course means that entire 
army that's also trapped nearby has to 

648
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,861
surrender to,
I mean the French fault on for a long 

649
00:38:10,861 --> 00:38:10,861
time doggedly,
um,

650
00:38:10,861 --> 00:38:12,340
the,
the people of Paris rose up.

651
00:38:12,341 --> 00:38:17,341
I mean,
there was a fantastic resistance after 

652
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:19,621
this,
but the war was over in a month and a 

653
00:38:19,621 --> 00:38:22,200
half.
That was the way the Germans wanted to 

654
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:22,200
do it again.
This time.

655
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,010
And the people who did it last time are 
the ones in command of a lot of these 

656
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:28,750
cores and armies.
And in the general staff

657
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:35,470
now,
as the Germans try to make their way 

658
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,000
through Belgium and not this important 
time schedule screwed up,

659
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:41,230
the French on the other side are trying 
to figure out what the heck's going on.

660
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,280
Part of what we modern people have to 
remember and I always try to try to put 

661
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,001
myself in their position very hard 
because when we're in an era where the 

662
00:38:51,001 --> 00:38:54,241
battlefield,
especially to western powers and most 

663
00:38:54,241 --> 00:38:56,821
especially to the United States,
the battlefield is totally visible for 

664
00:38:56,821 --> 00:39:00,121
the most part.
You can hide yourself and foliage 

665
00:39:00,121 --> 00:39:00,121
sometimes.
Maybe we're nearby.

666
00:39:00,121 --> 00:39:01,330
We're going to have know thermal sensors
and stuff,

667
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:06,690
but the battlefield is visible to us now
and we're used to this in most of human 

668
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,950
history.
The fog of war as it's known,

669
00:39:08,951 --> 00:39:13,951
is huge because it keeps you from seeing
what's about to happen until it just is 

670
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:19,291
about to happen.
You don't get a lot of advanced notice 

671
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:19,291
to plan.

672
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:23,070
That's why aircraft start becoming 
really important because they take the 

673
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,701
eyes of the military,
put them up in the air and extreme 

674
00:39:26,701 --> 00:39:30,780
extend how far back you can see if you 
see armies moving to another area,

675
00:39:31,391 --> 00:39:32,740
you can safely assume,
oh,

676
00:39:32,741 --> 00:39:34,450
I better move my arm,
you to another area.

677
00:39:34,451 --> 00:39:37,720
Something's going to happen over there 
during this early part of the battle.

678
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,660
No one is sure what's happening on the 
allied side,

679
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:45,661
the French or is worried about how they 
get the British over here to fight with 

680
00:39:45,661 --> 00:39:49,110
as many men as they can bring over as 
they are about where the Germans come in

681
00:39:49,111 --> 00:39:49,480
and,
and,

682
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:52,690
and,
and in what sort of strength you see the

683
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:57,691
French have suspected for a very long 
time that the Germans were going to do 

684
00:39:57,691 --> 00:40:00,460
this outflanking move in Belgium that 
was not totally unexpected.

685
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,990
The part that may have caught them off 
guard is what they were out flanking.

686
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,650
You know,
the French through Belgium with the guys

687
00:40:08,651 --> 00:40:10,510
running the French military at this 
time,

688
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,720
working on their own war plans.
Assumptions simply won't believe that 

689
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,310
the size moving through Belgium is as 
big as it is.

690
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:23,311
And let's remember,
mold guy will be criticized after the 

691
00:40:23,311 --> 00:40:23,410
war by other German generals who are 
mad.

692
00:40:23,411 --> 00:40:24,190
It's not bigger.

693
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:26,770
I mean,
and the,

694
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:31,810
the French have huge problems here 
because they have one of the loosest 

695
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:35,830
agreements I've ever run into in my life
for,

696
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,680
you know,
military cooperation there,

697
00:40:38,681 --> 00:40:43,681
battle plans call for the British army 
to guard their entire lines.

698
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:48,811
And when we talk about a line,
the French military line runs from 

699
00:40:48,811 --> 00:40:50,320
Switzerland in the south to Belgium,
in the north,

700
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:54,370
millions of men in multiple armies.
And by the way,

701
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:56,560
on the other side of the border,
the Germans had the same thing,

702
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,970
first time in human history that you've 
had millions of men squaring off against

703
00:41:00,971 --> 00:41:05,971
millions of men,
but the French left flank is counting on

704
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:08,890
having the British army there to anchor 
it.

705
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:15,060
That agreement has less paperwork 
attached to it than you would normally 

706
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,470
generate when you buy a house.
For all intents and purposes,

707
00:41:17,471 --> 00:41:19,060
as we said,
it's a handshake deal,

708
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,080
a handshake deal that we will go to war 
with you.

709
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:28,081
If war breaks out and a handshake deal 
with only one government in a country 

710
00:41:28,081 --> 00:41:32,251
where governments can come and go and 
we're public opinion isn't unified and a

711
00:41:32,621 --> 00:41:34,190
nation that you've had

712
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:39,250
centuries of antagonistic history with 
and only like five or eight years of,

713
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,170
you know,
friendly cooperation,

714
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:47,770
what's more when Britain gets into this 
war and then the first thing that the 

715
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:51,881
British people here is we're going to 
send the troops that would defend us if 

716
00:41:51,881 --> 00:41:53,420
the Germans decided to land on our 
coastline to France.

717
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:56,330
There's a lot of questions over how many
troops despair.

718
00:41:56,450 --> 00:42:01,130
Eventually the BDF we'll get to France 
with 70,000

719
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:06,250
men,
five divisions for infantry.

720
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:11,360
One cavalry to give you an idea of what 
70,000

721
00:42:11,361 --> 00:42:14,030
men are.
Five divisions means on this front,

722
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:19,450
the Germans are deploying like 85 
divisions on the western front.

723
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,880
70,000
men seems like nothing.

724
00:42:24,881 --> 00:42:26,360
That's the tiny little,
you know,

725
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,660
it's the army of a sea power,
isn't it?

726
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:31,780
That's the tiny little force that 
bismarck.

727
00:42:31,781 --> 00:42:35,740
A generation before that iron and blood 
German diplomat had famously said,

728
00:42:35,741 --> 00:42:37,510
when one of his aids said,
what if the British land,

729
00:42:37,511 --> 00:42:38,810
their army on our coast,
he says that,

730
00:42:38,811 --> 00:42:43,811
then I'll have them arrested.
This is the army that was so small you 

731
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,850
could joke about arresting them,
but here's the difference.

732
00:42:45,851 --> 00:42:49,840
Unlike all the other major armies of the
participants in this war,

733
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:55,590
the British army or professional long 
standing regular force with a lot of 

734
00:42:58,301 --> 00:43:03,301
people in the specialty,
the noncommissioned officer ranks who 

735
00:43:03,301 --> 00:43:06,601
were lifers and who when this war 
started immediately called up there 

736
00:43:06,601 --> 00:43:09,160
reservists guys who served 10,
15,

737
00:43:09,161 --> 00:43:14,161
20 years before and had fought in places
like South Africa and the Boer War and 

738
00:43:14,161 --> 00:43:18,751
the turn of the century.
The institutional memory of these units 

739
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:23,710
was deep.
The quality of these forces was intense.

740
00:43:23,711 --> 00:43:25,010
They used to have,
you know,

741
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:29,650
unlimited marksman practice and get 
financial rewards for winning it.

742
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,040
They'd actually,
you know,

743
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:36,060
a lot of the people in these units 
fought in actual combat with modern 

744
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:36,060
weapons.

745
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,090
My favorite source from this early 
period is an Irishman.

746
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:41,740
You know,
as you might imagine,

747
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:45,100
a WHO's actually fighting in the BDF,
his name is John Lucy,

748
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:48,720
and he's one of the few British side 
reporters,

749
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:53,820
I guess you could call him,
but he's a soldier who writes from this 

750
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,260
very early period because he was right 
in the first wave and he explains,

751
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:01,550
you know,
the difference between his unit and the 

752
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:02,630
rest of the continental troops and he 
does so in a very chauvinist stick,

753
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:06,610
a very proud fashion,
but he claims quote,

754
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:11,950
the British army in 1914 was more used 
to battle than that of any other nation.

755
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:17,220
It possessed the highest and bravest 
traditions that can be engendered in a 

756
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:21,151
fighting force and its experience of 
wars was such that our own regiment 

757
00:44:21,151 --> 00:44:24,160
though a young one in the army,
had so many battle honors that they were

758
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:29,161
difficult to memorize and quote.
Now John Lewis is only 20.

759
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:32,490
He doesn't have a long service history 
under his belt,

760
00:44:32,491 --> 00:44:37,491
but when the reservists arrive,
he watches men who appear to be just 

761
00:44:37,491 --> 00:44:42,141
regular folks off the street,
transformed themselves into grizzled 

762
00:44:42,141 --> 00:44:43,110
British veterans.
Quote

763
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,700
are reservists came streaming into 
makeup,

764
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,440
our war strength,
cheerful careless fellows of all types,

765
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,230
some in bowler hats and smart suiting 
things,

766
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,360
others in descending scale down to the 
garb of tramps soon like us.

767
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:01,210
They were uniformed and equipped with 
field kits,

768
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:06,360
and the change was remarkable.
Smart Sergeants and corporals and beer 

769
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,830
ribbon veterans of the South African war
hatched out of that crowd of nondescript

770
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:14,230
civilians and took their place in duties
as if they had never left the army.

771
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,670
They were an excellent lot,
but their numbers increased our strength

772
00:45:17,671 --> 00:45:22,671
to an uncomfortable extent and quote 
what John Lucy found to be an 

773
00:45:23,051 --> 00:45:28,051
uncomfortable increasing of numbers when
they arrived at the continent.

774
00:45:28,401 --> 00:45:31,240
Seemed like a tiny little trickle of 
British soldiers,

775
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:36,990
but the quality of this army that came 
to be known as the old contemptible was 

776
00:45:37,121 --> 00:45:40,630
of the highest level matching the top 
German units.

777
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,050
It was ironically under the command of a
British general name,

778
00:45:47,051 --> 00:45:52,051
French,
who didn't very much like the French Sir

779
00:45:52,421 --> 00:45:54,660
John French will lead the B,
e,

780
00:45:54,661 --> 00:45:59,661
f the British expeditionary force onto 
the continent just in time to play their

781
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:05,491
historic role in what Sir Arthur Conan 
doyle called the most terrible August in

782
00:46:06,611 --> 00:46:08,020
the history of the world.

783
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:15,080
There'll be involved in several battles 
that are all called the battle of the 

784
00:46:16,681 --> 00:46:21,681
frontiers.
There's a bunch of little battles that 

785
00:46:21,681 --> 00:46:23,691
are all sort of wrapped up into this one
big event called the battle of the 

786
00:46:23,691 --> 00:46:25,310
frontiers.
What it really means is,

787
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:28,620
is all the fighting that was going on 
along this front,

788
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:33,120
and there are several sort of thrusts 
and Perry's encounter thrust that go on.

789
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:39,290
I'm going to spend a little bit more 
time than I normally plan to for the 

790
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:39,420
rest of this series on this battle 
because this,

791
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:44,930
this battle of the frontiers is in so 
many ways the most interesting moment of

792
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:47,820
this war.
First of all,

793
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:50,520
it's what we've talked about for an 
episode and a half.

794
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:53,160
Now.
It's the rubber meets the road moment,

795
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:58,310
the testing moment for all this military
theory and hypothesis that's been 

796
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:00,110
happening in some cases,
you know,

797
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:05,120
for the last hundred years,
you get to see if people's assumptions 

798
00:47:06,161 --> 00:47:10,000
about how this weapon system would work 
or that tactic would fare.

799
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,840
You get to see which of those turn out 
to be correct and which ones don't,

800
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:19,350
and a lot of the time these armies will 
go into combat hamstrung by decisions 

801
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:25,171
that were made a decade before in terms 
of what the army's doctrine's going to 

802
00:47:25,171 --> 00:47:26,260
be or the tactics or how they're going 
to be.

803
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,730
You know,
dressed and equipped.

804
00:47:27,731 --> 00:47:28,750
I mean,
take the French.

805
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,100
The French will go

806
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:35,100
into this modern war and it is almost 
impossible to understand this today 

807
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:39,700
because there's a ludicrousness to it 
that shows off another century.

808
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,810
You want to see the 19th century clash 
with the 20th century.

809
00:47:43,811 --> 00:47:45,850
It happens in this battle of the 
frontiers.

810
00:47:45,851 --> 00:47:47,320
In August 19,
14,

811
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,800
the French go into combat with almost 
the exact same uniform.

812
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:55,890
Their grandfathers war in 1870,
a blue jacket with tails wide red pants 

813
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:05,190
that look like targets and acted like it
to their officers would have white hats 

814
00:48:07,661 --> 00:48:09,310
and white gloves.
I mean again,

815
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:14,340
targets.
They will send cavalry to go fight that 

816
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:18,721
look like.
I mean you can go look at your history 

817
00:48:18,721 --> 00:48:18,790
books in 1914 and they often have 
pictures of this cavalry.

818
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,310
I told my friend who was always asking 
for,

819
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:26,340
you know,
I would love to see a picture of 

820
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:26,340
Napoleon's queer sears.
You know,

821
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,580
his famous cavalry with the breast 
plates in the horse hair,

822
00:48:27,581 --> 00:48:28,930
plumed helmets,
you know,

823
00:48:28,931 --> 00:48:30,460
when the sabres and the whole thing.
And I said,

824
00:48:30,461 --> 00:48:33,790
you don't have to wish for a picture of 
Napoleon's queers ears.

825
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:38,800
They're going off to war in 1914.
They look identical armor and all.

826
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:46,310
That's the old world going off to war.
And you can see it visually.

827
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,320
Think of how the French soldiers 
hamstrung by that.

828
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:54,400
The British had been using khaki,
you know,

829
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:58,760
for themselves since the colonial wars 
in the 18 eighties.

830
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,850
The French are going to go into this war
looking like walking.

831
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,650
Peacocks and a ton of French soldiers 
will pay the price for that.

832
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:12,040
They'll pay the price for not having 
much in the way of heavy artillery to.

833
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:17,041
Again,
these were all ideas that you could 

834
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:19,501
logically back up.
The French decided they wanted to have 

835
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:19,501
more mobile army,
so we don't need that big,

836
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:19,780
heavy,
cumbersome,

837
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:22,840
slow artillery to slow us down.
By the time that gets anywhere,

838
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:25,090
the battle's going to be over anyway.
Sounds great.

839
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:30,600
In theory,
until you try it and you find out your 

840
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,451
soldiers are in terrible trouble on the 
actual battlefields because they don't 

841
00:49:33,451 --> 00:49:33,451
have any heavy artillery.

842
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:37,680
There's a reputation.
The French have militarily in the United

843
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,910
States that is in ordinance influenced 
by the way the Second World War went.

844
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:47,240
I always try to tell people,
you misunderstand Francis military 

845
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,661
reputation then because for hundreds of 
years they're considered one of the 

846
00:49:50,661 --> 00:49:52,590
finest,
if not the finest land army in the world

847
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:57,690
100 years before this time,
a little coarser can guy is using,

848
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,270
you know,
especially as the hardcore of his armies

849
00:50:00,271 --> 00:50:05,271
to conquer the majority of the world 
that mattered at this time and the one 

850
00:50:05,271 --> 00:50:09,591
that owned the rest of the majority of 
the world is colonies and did it with 

851
00:50:09,591 --> 00:50:09,990
French troops.

852
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:16,550
They will often heroically throw their 
lives down to try to overcome these 

853
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:21,261
deficiencies that they enter war width.
I think you could make a case that in 

854
00:50:21,261 --> 00:50:23,250
all three wars,
that over 75 years,

855
00:50:23,251 --> 00:50:26,760
the French and Germans fought with each 
other from 1870 to 1945,

856
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:32,060
that the average French soldier on the 
ground was hamstrung by his leadership 

857
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,890
in all three of those conflicts in the 
Second World War.

858
00:50:33,891 --> 00:50:35,660
I mean historically,
tragically,

859
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,760
but I would suggest that the war out of 
those three in which French leadership 

860
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,510
performed the best was in the first 
world war.

861
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:49,990
There are a bunch of different generals 
that I think Second World War France 

862
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:50,180
would have given their right arm to 
have,

863
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:54,320
um,
led by a guy who is iconic.

864
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,860
I've always thought of him as like the 
French Churchill,

865
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:03,100
you know,
what Churchill was to Britain in the 

866
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:03,100
Second World War.
This guy is to France in the first world

867
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:07,031
war and he has all these same 
stereotypically interesting anecdotes 

868
00:51:07,031 --> 00:51:08,690
and characteristics that Churchill had.

869
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:13,690
But instead of them being 
stereotypically British as Churchill's 

870
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:14,810
were their stereotypical Golic,
they're French.

871
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:20,770
You know,
Churchill had this thing with alcohol 

872
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:21,110
that was part of his image and part of 
the fun with this guy.

873
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:26,111
It's food and that's because it fits 
perfectly with his physical sort of 

874
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,970
image.
He's huge in every way.

875
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:31,640
He's tall,
he's fat.

876
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:36,820
He's got a giant,
bushy white mustache and a placid look 

877
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:37,470
on his face all the time.
His name is Joseph.

878
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:40,940
That,
and if I mispronounced that again,

879
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,320
that's just going to be the first of 
many,

880
00:51:42,321 --> 00:51:44,600
my apologies because he still,
you know,

881
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,300
the lion of France in a lot of French 
households.

882
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:50,480
He's a fabulously interesting guy.
But you know,

883
00:51:50,481 --> 00:51:54,410
I've read a significant amount on this 
person and I'm not sure I understand him

884
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:57,170
any better than before I started.
And what's more,

885
00:51:57,171 --> 00:51:59,120
I'm not sure these authors did either.

886
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:03,270
He is like an obelisk and he is 
imperturbably.

887
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,770
Good luck scratching the surface of 
figuring out what you have there.

888
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:08,960
And even his contemporaries felt that 
way.

889
00:52:08,961 --> 00:52:13,961
One thing when you read quotes that 
people who knew him say about him is 

890
00:52:13,961 --> 00:52:13,961
one,
they,

891
00:52:13,961 --> 00:52:17,970
they say different things sometimes and 
to sometimes they didn't know what this 

892
00:52:18,591 --> 00:52:19,820
guy was up to.
I mean,

893
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:25,110
you know,
sometimes you look at something and you 

894
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:25,110
wonder if he's just a little doll or 
slow or receive,

895
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:29,190
you know,
sly like a Fox and just hiding 

896
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:29,190
everything.
I mean it's,

897
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:29,190
it's,
he's an interesting guy.

898
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:33,611
You could probe this guy a long time and
still not really get a good idea about 

899
00:52:33,611 --> 00:52:38,261
what you're dealing with here.
The one thing you can say about him is 

900
00:52:38,261 --> 00:52:42,070
he,
he's got one of those qualities of 

901
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:43,931
generalship that's just going to be a 
perfect match for what's needed at the 

902
00:52:43,931 --> 00:52:43,931
time.

903
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:49,210
And I've always said that you general 
generalship is absolutely an art and in 

904
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:49,370
the same way that art,
you know,

905
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:54,390
sees the manifestation of the artist's 
personality sort of translated in its 

906
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:57,890
own unique way in the art form.
Generalship is like that too.

907
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:03,760
You can see all these different kinds of
generals who all have these different 

908
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,060
kinds of personalities and they command 
that way.

909
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:09,560
And the key is to try to find your 
strengths and then you know,

910
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:12,500
figuring out a way to make those 
strengths work for you on a battlefield.

911
00:53:12,501 --> 00:53:15,560
Take for example,
these really aggressive commanders,

912
00:53:15,561 --> 00:53:17,540
these quick thinking,
hard pushing,

913
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:22,541
dashing sort of guys.
Hind Scuderia in the famous guy who 

914
00:53:22,541 --> 00:53:25,770
basically created the German tank 
approach in the World War.

915
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,780
He was that kind of guy.
The Guy,

916
00:53:27,781 --> 00:53:31,290
by the way,
who's commanding the most important army

917
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,960
on the German side in this war,
the Sledge Hammer,

918
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:37,410
head army first army's a guy just like 
this too hard driving,

919
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:38,760
aggressive kind of guy.

920
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:43,110
That sort of approach is perfect in some
situations and in some armies.

921
00:53:43,111 --> 00:53:45,780
But then you need the bean counter guy 
sometimes too.

922
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:47,940
That's what von Moltke is.
He's a bean counter.

923
00:53:47,941 --> 00:53:52,941
He sits there and and plans everything 
out to the nth degree and make sure all 

924
00:53:52,941 --> 00:53:54,370
the t's are crossed and the i's dotted 
and you don't have anything,

925
00:53:54,371 --> 00:53:57,570
and those guys are very useful to the 
inspirational general,

926
00:53:57,571 --> 00:54:02,571
like an Alexander the great who get out 
there and get your troops to perform 

927
00:54:02,571 --> 00:54:06,030
feats of heroism that may be a lesser 
man or a woman couldn't have gotten them

928
00:54:06,031 --> 00:54:11,031
to perform this.
There's all these different kinds of 

929
00:54:11,031 --> 00:54:13,251
generals.
Jennifer is the kind that doesn't ever 

930
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:14,700
get ruffled.
That's what he brings to the table.

931
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:20,900
He refuses to panic.
He's almost frightfully calm in 

932
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,710
situations that he's about to experience
that,

933
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:26,250
that,
that are not only stressful to the point

934
00:54:26,251 --> 00:54:31,251
of panic,
but the perhaps panic is the right 

935
00:54:31,251 --> 00:54:31,251
emotion to have.

936
00:54:31,251 --> 00:54:35,510
Now,
there are historians out there who 

937
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:35,640
suggested that we should not look at 
that as such a great quality to bring to

938
00:54:35,641 --> 00:54:40,641
the table because it might be Jennifer's
own shortcomings in some of the other 

939
00:54:40,831 --> 00:54:45,831
arts of generalship that made it 
necessary for there to be a guy who 

940
00:54:45,831 --> 00:54:49,521
wouldn't panic at the top to begin with.
Wouldn't be needing to panic if you'd 

941
00:54:49,521 --> 00:54:53,561
have been a better player of that blind 
chess game that we talked about earlier 

942
00:54:53,561 --> 00:54:54,060
and maybe offer is not that good at that
game.

943
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:57,060
Hence the situation becomes panic 
inducing.

944
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,430
Hence a leader that's very good at 
stopping.

945
00:54:59,431 --> 00:55:02,070
Panic is just what you need at the time 
anyway,

946
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,500
might be a self reinforcing sort of 
thing,

947
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:09,800
but I think it's hard to deny that 
France would have given up a right arm 

948
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:13,521
and both legs to have this guy in the 
second world war and the reason that 

949
00:55:13,521 --> 00:55:18,141
this guy is going to be so necessary 
this imperturbability is going to be so 

950
00:55:18,141 --> 00:55:21,381
necessary is because of how this first 
round in this heavyweight championship 

951
00:55:21,381 --> 00:55:23,760
fight that's gonna go on for four years 
is going to go.

952
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,400
And if you're going to use a boxing 
analogy here for this,

953
00:55:26,401 --> 00:55:30,630
this is gonna be a boring fight.
As the fight goes on,

954
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:35,780
you know,
we're things slow down to a dull roar 

955
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:35,780
and everybody's looking for tactical 
opportunities and,

956
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:39,810
and but the first round is wild.
Massive haymakers swings.

957
00:55:39,811 --> 00:55:41,760
Mrs.
dropping the other guy for,

958
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:42,600
you know,
an eight count.

959
00:55:42,601 --> 00:55:47,601
I mean,
it's going to be a wild first round and 

960
00:55:47,601 --> 00:55:48,090
if you lose your head you could lose the
war.

961
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:53,300
So having Jennifer at the,
at the French high command shows that 

962
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:53,300
the French are not going to lose their 
head.

963
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:57,960
I can't help but think about the German 
commander at this point though.

964
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:03,350
Von Moltke [inaudible] a very 
interesting guy in the sense that he 

965
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:04,770
almost looks like a guy who doesn't want
to be there.

966
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:10,460
You know,
he is the nephew of one of the greatest 

967
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:10,460
heroes in German military history.

968
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:12,720
It's almost like he went into the family
business,

969
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:16,530
but whereas those guys thought about 
nothing but war all the time.

970
00:56:16,531 --> 00:56:21,531
And remember Schlieffen,
the legendary writer of the Schlieffen 

971
00:56:21,531 --> 00:56:24,711
plan is supposed to have died.
Still saying stuff about the Schlieffen 

972
00:56:24,711 --> 00:56:28,771
plan.
The last words on his lips are 

973
00:56:28,771 --> 00:56:28,771
supposedly make sure to keep the right 
wing strong.

974
00:56:28,771 --> 00:56:33,680
I mean,
these are people who have no hobbies 

975
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,940
other than war von Moltke.
The younger is a guy who famously said 

976
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:39,400
that art was what he lived for,
and I think about this guy in the most,

977
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,950
one of the most stressful positions in 
all history.

978
00:56:41,951 --> 00:56:46,951
Once this war breaks out,
remember he has no illusions about what 

979
00:56:46,951 --> 00:56:51,481
the stakes are.
He's the one who famously said that the 

980
00:56:51,481 --> 00:56:54,481
war that he's launching will decide the 
course of history for the next hundred 

981
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,110
years,
and it certainly has.

982
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,000
Think of the pressure on that though.

983
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:03,330
Think about the fact that his plan that 
he's operating with is a terrible 

984
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:06,991
gamble.
And then watch how every flip of the 

985
00:57:06,991 --> 00:57:09,220
coin so far in this conflict has gone 
against him.

986
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:14,710
I mean,
if you're judging this fight based on 

987
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:17,400
who landed the latest punch,
von Moltke and the Germans are losing 

988
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,530
right from the very beginning when 
thinking about the Conan flips that have

989
00:57:20,531 --> 00:57:22,030
already happened.
I mean,

990
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:25,360
think about the Belgium one to begin 
with.

991
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:30,690
I mean,
you were hoping that when you invaded 

992
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:32,881
Belgium,
they just sort of stood by the side of 

993
00:57:32,881 --> 00:57:33,700
the road and let you go through.
Maybe it would feed you and everything,

994
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:34,810
right?
You would.

995
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:37,690
That's what your hope was.
It could have been a flip of the coin.

996
00:57:37,691 --> 00:57:39,850
Instead,
the Belgians resisted you.

997
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:43,540
They destroyed the communication and 
transportation system you were hoping to

998
00:57:43,541 --> 00:57:46,510
use and then to make matters worse,
some of them were shooting at you,

999
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:51,660
allegedly,
so your troops had been executing 

1000
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:54,121
Belgians,
which makes you look terrible on the 

1001
00:57:54,121 --> 00:57:54,121
world stage.

1002
00:57:54,121 --> 00:57:55,750
So that coin flipped the wrong way.
And then you flip the coin again.

1003
00:57:55,751 --> 00:57:57,970
Maybe Britain won't get involved when we
violate,

1004
00:57:58,210 --> 00:57:59,710
you know,
the neutrality of Belgium,

1005
00:57:59,711 --> 00:58:01,090
right?
It's just a scrap of paper.

1006
00:58:01,091 --> 00:58:02,860
As the German diplomat,
famous Luke said,

1007
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:08,460
oh,
that landed on the wrong side of the 

1008
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:08,460
coin to the British came in and you lost
that flip.

1009
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:13,740
Another flip happens starting on August 
15th and the timetables going to get 

1010
00:58:13,751 --> 00:58:18,751
weird now because there's stuff 
happening on multiple fronts that 

1011
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,630
overlap with each other because while 
this is going on,

1012
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:24,990
you know,
the first maneuvers are going on in the 

1013
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:24,990
West do,
but,

1014
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:27,830
but on the 15th of August,
if you're on multiple watching how your 

1015
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:27,880
planned attack is,
is going,

1016
00:58:27,881 --> 00:58:31,510
and you haven't even gotten your sledge 
hammer head through Belgium yet.

1017
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:34,540
So you're still a ways away from your 
attack doing anything,

1018
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:37,090
but you've got things starting to 
collapse around you.

1019
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:42,480
On August 15th,
the Serbs remembered this as a moderate 

1020
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,010
country fighting a great power.
You know,

1021
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:48,340
some Serbian gunman killed the Austrian 
archduke and that's why we're here,

1022
00:58:48,341 --> 00:58:49,330
right?
I mean,

1023
00:58:49,331 --> 00:58:54,331
the one thing everyone was sure about is
that no matter what happens in this 

1024
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:54,331
conflict,
Serbia is going to get their butt kicked

1025
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,990
because they're fighting Austria,
Hungary,

1026
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:58,420
who is right next door,
and they're a global power.

1027
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:03,570
The austro-hungarian are camped out sort
of on a hillside by a river on the 15th 

1028
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:04,920
of August.
One hundred and 80,000

1029
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:05,890
serves.
Attack them.

1030
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:09,370
The Austria.
Hungarian army has about 200,000

1031
00:59:09,371 --> 00:59:13,240
people and it,
it's morale just collapses.

1032
00:59:13,241 --> 00:59:18,241
And we told you before,
the Serbs are one of those people 

1033
00:59:18,241 --> 00:59:20,860
historically who in the military sense 
kind of punch above their weight class.

1034
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:24,290
They're ferocious fighters.
They were aggressive,

1035
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:29,530
aggressively lead.
And the Austro-hungarian forces were 

1036
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:30,950
apparently more riddled with problems 
than anyone knew.

1037
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:35,060
And a lot of them will drown routing 
across this river,

1038
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,470
um,
pursued closely by 180,000

1039
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:43,310
Serbians in three armies.
Think about what this does if you're von

1040
00:59:43,311 --> 00:59:48,311
Moltke in terms of stress,
because you're hoping that the ostrow 

1041
00:59:48,311 --> 00:59:52,100
Hungarians can help you keep the 
Russians off your neck until you're done

1042
00:59:52,101 --> 00:59:53,030
in France.
Remember,

1043
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:54,980
you've got to deal with enemies on each 
side here.

1044
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:58,220
You're hoping your ally right there is 
going to be able to help.

1045
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:03,460
And yet they just got their tailed 
kicked by a moderate size power.

1046
01:00:04,281 --> 01:00:06,620
What's going to happen when they face 
the Russians?

1047
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:13,100
And then on the 17th of August,
the biggest disaster at all,

1048
01:00:15,061 --> 01:00:19,920
if you're von Moltke occurs and the 
Russians arrive early,

1049
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,680
talk about flipping the coin before the 
war,

1050
01:00:22,681 --> 01:00:27,681
assuming you can get all this stuff done
before the Russians mobilized and then 

1051
01:00:27,681 --> 01:00:31,050
they mobilize early.
So by August 17th,

1052
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,850
von [inaudible] has problems everywhere 
and,

1053
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:38,860
and,
and it becomes a real question whether 

1054
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:41,211
or not he's ever going to be able to use
his war winning sledge hammer because 

1055
01:00:41,401 --> 01:00:44,220
maybe he'll have lost the war everywhere
else before that even happens.

1056
01:00:44,221 --> 01:00:45,540
I mean,
there's writings you can,

1057
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:47,790
you can read from this time period in 
1914.

1058
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:49,560
They think that the war is almost 
already over.

1059
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,560
Meanwhile,
on the 14th of August,

1060
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:56,890
Jennifer and the French launch and 
attack into Alsace Lorraine,

1061
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,530
the first real attack I should say,
they,

1062
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:01,930
they,
they sent it token force in there on the

1063
01:01:01,931 --> 01:01:03,460
seventh of August.
Um,

1064
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:04,240
which is,
you know,

1065
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:09,410
you gotta remember seventh of August is 
four days after France and Germany 

1066
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:10,210
declared war on each other.
They send a token force in there,

1067
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:12,700
you know,
with messages from the French leadership

1068
01:01:12,701 --> 01:01:13,330
about,
you know,

1069
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,490
here we're home.
You're back in the bosom of France.

1070
01:01:15,491 --> 01:01:16,720
All these wonderful things,
kisses,

1071
01:01:16,721 --> 01:01:18,280
picnic baskets,
flowers,

1072
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:19,570
wine,
the whole deal,

1073
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:21,130
you know,
welcomed with open arms.

1074
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:26,340
And then all of a sudden that little 
token for us with the roses and wine and

1075
01:01:26,411 --> 01:01:31,411
everything has to run back across the 
French border because the German force 

1076
01:01:31,411 --> 01:01:33,490
that's nearby is not a token force.
So on August 14th,

1077
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:37,480
the day before the Serbs smash that 
Austro-hungarian Army,

1078
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:39,640
um,
that so discomforts,

1079
01:01:39,641 --> 01:01:41,260
von Moltke,
the French,

1080
01:01:41,261 --> 01:01:43,480
launched two armies into Alsace 
Lorraine.

1081
01:01:43,481 --> 01:01:45,430
And it's serious now.
Now it's on,

1082
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:50,910
now we have to have the best armies in 
the world clashing head on with 

1083
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:53,950
significant numbers of people and the 
French push the Germans back

1084
01:01:55,150 --> 01:02:00,150
and then the next day they push them 
back again and then the next day they 

1085
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:03,461
push them back again.
Now it should be noted that while the 

1086
01:02:03,531 --> 01:02:08,531
rest of the world thinks,
this looks like just one more disaster 

1087
01:02:08,531 --> 01:02:09,590
for Germany side and you have all these 
other problems,

1088
01:02:09,591 --> 01:02:12,200
the Russians are already in east Prussia
and now look at the French.

1089
01:02:12,201 --> 01:02:13,910
The first time they launch a significant
attack.

1090
01:02:13,911 --> 01:02:18,080
The Germans are backing up,
but that's one thing I'm sure von Moltke

1091
01:02:18,081 --> 01:02:23,081
wasn't stressed about because that 
retreat by the Germans was all part of 

1092
01:02:23,081 --> 01:02:27,860
the plan.
The Germans of course,

1093
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:31,890
for decades knew that the French would 
involve Alsace.

1094
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:36,900
Lorraine in any war effort,
and so they put troops there who had 

1095
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:40,061
orders to retire to just sort of keep 
the French engaged,

1096
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:44,450
but move backwards as they move forward.
Let them even into Germany,

1097
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:50,430
shoot them as they're pursuing you.
Take your toll on them as they're 

1098
01:02:50,711 --> 01:02:52,600
pursuing you,
but retire in good order.

1099
01:02:52,601 --> 01:02:57,580
Take your guns with you and just sort of
pull them away from all the parts of the

1100
01:02:57,581 --> 01:03:02,581
war that matter.
You see when the French figure out about

1101
01:03:02,811 --> 01:03:07,811
this sledgehammer.
I've also compared it to a door on a 

1102
01:03:07,811 --> 01:03:10,331
hinge because you have all these German 
armies stretching from the Swiss border 

1103
01:03:10,331 --> 01:03:14,260
all the way up to Belgium and most of 
them are just there to keep the French 

1104
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:15,530
occupied.
The damage that's going to be done.

1105
01:03:15,531 --> 01:03:20,531
It's going to be done by that door sort 
of in Belgium and Luxembourg that swings

1106
01:03:21,351 --> 01:03:23,450
closed on top of the French nation.

1107
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:29,490
The other German army's job is to keep 
the French in front of them occupied so 

1108
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:33,391
they can't turn around and move in a 
different direction and do anything 

1109
01:03:33,391 --> 01:03:36,991
about that hammer and those French 
army's way down south in Alsace and 

1110
01:03:36,991 --> 01:03:40,741
Lorraine,
which are down by the Swiss border that 

1111
01:03:40,741 --> 01:03:40,741
are,
you know,

1112
01:03:40,741 --> 01:03:43,440
pursuing German armies back into the 
interior of Germany are just getting 

1113
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,760
farther and farther away from where they
can help.

1114
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:50,110
Once the French realize they need every 
army they can get their hands on to deal

1115
01:03:50,111 --> 01:03:55,111
with that threat.
So fond [inaudible] not upset about 

1116
01:03:55,111 --> 01:03:56,530
this.
This is part of the deal and that starts

1117
01:03:56,531 --> 01:03:58,540
on August 14th,
15th,

1118
01:03:58,541 --> 01:03:59,590
16th,
17th.

1119
01:03:59,591 --> 01:04:02,260
That continues there.
The Russians are in east Prussia now.

1120
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:06,430
The Austrians have been defeated on 
their front since the seventh of August,

1121
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:08,890
but really big on the 11th and twelfth 
of August.

1122
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:14,010
The British Expeditionary Force has been
arriving on the continent and they keep 

1123
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:15,700
saying they're not going to be ready to 
fight until maybe the 26th of August,

1124
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:18,430
but the French would like them there 
sooner.

1125
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:23,910
One Frenchmen in particular is desperate
to have the British show up as early as 

1126
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:27,961
possible.
This is the French general who was 

1127
01:04:27,961 --> 01:04:29,200
commanding the army on Francis left 
flank,

1128
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:31,930
right?
The last army,

1129
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:33,520
you know,
so it's kind of facing.

1130
01:04:33,521 --> 01:04:36,160
So to Belgium,
where if you look to your right,

1131
01:04:36,161 --> 01:04:41,161
they've got several armies,
millions of men all the way down to the 

1132
01:04:41,161 --> 01:04:45,061
Swiss border,
totally protected from anybody 

1133
01:04:45,061 --> 01:04:45,061
penetrating our ranks and hitting us in 
the flank.

1134
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:47,500
But if that fifth army under a general 
name,

1135
01:04:47,501 --> 01:04:51,040
Lynn Rasic looks to the left,
looks north,

1136
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:54,670
there's nobody there.
There's open land,

1137
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:59,910
there's maneuvering room for an enemy to
get around his flanks and destroy him 

1138
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:04,561
and roll the whole French line up all 
the way down to Switzerland if 

1139
01:05:04,561 --> 01:05:07,681
necessary,
so he's got a vested interest in being 

1140
01:05:07,681 --> 01:05:11,671
aware of any potential threats out there
because he's going to take it in the 

1141
01:05:11,671 --> 01:05:11,671
flank,
you know,

1142
01:05:11,671 --> 01:05:16,201
when,
when it shows up and he perceives even 

1143
01:05:16,201 --> 01:05:18,391
before the war starts,
he's sending messages in July to 

1144
01:05:18,391 --> 01:05:22,651
Jennifer saying going all signs point to
a German advanced through Belgium 

1145
01:05:22,651 --> 01:05:26,761
basically,
which is one reason you knew the high 

1146
01:05:26,761 --> 01:05:26,761
command knew about it.

1147
01:05:26,761 --> 01:05:27,820
They just,
nobody knew how big it was going to be,

1148
01:05:27,821 --> 01:05:32,821
but this general and resit keeps telling
them every couple of days he's sending 

1149
01:05:32,821 --> 01:05:33,760
messages to the high command going,
you know,

1150
01:05:33,761 --> 01:05:36,570
latest reports are or you know,
huge attack.

1151
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:39,850
I mean he basically,
the Way History will vindicate this guy,

1152
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:45,060
is he correctly perceived the power and 
destination of this German blow long 

1153
01:05:46,451 --> 01:05:51,451
before anyone else does and one of the 
historical what ifs in this time period 

1154
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,680
is what if Jennifer had taken what he 
was saying?

1155
01:05:53,681 --> 01:05:55,810
Seriously,
sooner again,

1156
01:05:55,811 --> 01:05:58,660
maybe you don't need to be such a 
wonderful,

1157
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:03,960
um,
stability factor when panic is all 

1158
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,931
around you if you don't make a mistake 
like not listening to this general in 

1159
01:06:06,931 --> 01:06:08,530
which creates the panic inducing 
situation to begin with.

1160
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:13,610
Gioffre basically thinks the guy's 
panicking and then he starts saying,

1161
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:15,410
you know,
as it becomes apparent that something is

1162
01:06:15,411 --> 01:06:17,870
moving through Belgium and those forts 
are going down,

1163
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,530
he starts thinking this is going to be a
good thing for the same reason.

1164
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:26,590
It's a good thing for the Germans to 
have those French go through Alsace 

1165
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:27,110
Lorraine and keep advancing away from 
where the action's going to be.

1166
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,040
A offers ideas.
Listen,

1167
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:33,290
even if the Germans are going through 
Belgium with a large force,

1168
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:38,680
all the better.
Our plans going to be to cut that large 

1169
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:39,890
force off.
If this is a swinging gate or door,

1170
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:45,010
we will hit it at the hinge and then we 
will roll up behind it all the way up to

1171
01:06:45,291 --> 01:06:46,400
the water,
you know,

1172
01:06:46,401 --> 01:06:51,401
in the,
in the North Sea or the English Channel 

1173
01:06:51,401 --> 01:06:51,401
right there.
And then your cutoff.

1174
01:06:51,401 --> 01:06:54,800
And then this wonderful sledge hammer 
blow becomes a surrounded,

1175
01:06:54,801 --> 01:06:59,801
trapped cream of your army.
So he turned a negative into a positive 

1176
01:06:59,801 --> 01:07:03,080
and basically would tell len rasic that 
you have nothing to worry about.

1177
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:08,900
One resnick thought different and 
figured his chances would be improved if

1178
01:07:08,901 --> 01:07:13,901
that British force would hurry up and 
come up on his left so that even though 

1179
01:07:13,901 --> 01:07:15,830
the British might have an open left 
flank,

1180
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:20,831
he wouldn't have one anymore.
And it's at that point that the battle 

1181
01:07:21,171 --> 01:07:22,730
of the frontiers breaks out.

1182
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:31,400
Now the battle of the frontiers is named
that because it's the time where the 

1183
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,650
general eruption of violence,
um,

1184
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:38,690
on the Franco German border happens.
And there are a lot of different 

1185
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:42,390
encounters that are all a part of this 
larger conflict essentially though is an

1186
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:46,200
umbrella term that covers all the 
violence on the Franco German border.

1187
01:07:46,201 --> 01:07:48,150
That breaks out almost simultaneously.

1188
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:55,290
And it turns out to be a really 
important thing for the German war 

1189
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:56,440
effort that it did.
Because,

1190
01:07:56,670 --> 01:07:58,900
you know,
by about August 19th,

1191
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:02,110
the German situation really is bad as we
said earlier.

1192
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:07,130
But things I've even gotten worse.
Those Russians in East Prussia that had 

1193
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:10,321
shown up sooner than expected had 
defeated some German forces that went 

1194
01:08:10,321 --> 01:08:11,670
out and tried to deal with them.
All of a sudden it looks like that flank

1195
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:16,710
might be collapsing.
It's hard to get really excited about 

1196
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:16,940
anything if you're Molko whose nickname 
you know,

1197
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:20,570
given to him by the Kaiser was something
that translates loosely,

1198
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:22,580
too gloomy.
Gus.

1199
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:25,130
Anyway,
not exactly an optimist.

1200
01:08:25,131 --> 01:08:30,131
Anyway,
he couldn't have been feeling too good 

1201
01:08:30,131 --> 01:08:30,131
about the situation.
On the 19th or 20th,

1202
01:08:30,131 --> 01:08:33,650
he receives a request from one of his 
generals in the field.

1203
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,580
It's the guy who is retreating from all 
those French forces,

1204
01:08:37,581 --> 01:08:42,581
retiring in good order,
taking his guns with them and sort of 

1205
01:08:42,581 --> 01:08:42,581
drawing them away from the action.

1206
01:08:42,581 --> 01:08:44,660
He's one of the wonderful German royalty
that's part of this.

1207
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:47,480
This isn't in the Wehrmacht.
In the Second World War,

1208
01:08:47,481 --> 01:08:50,060
you didn't have any of this and this 
first where you have all these guys like

1209
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:53,120
Prince Rupert,
prick of Bavaria,

1210
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:56,570
and he commands the forest that's 
retreating.

1211
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,880
He doesn't like retreating.
You know,

1212
01:08:58,881 --> 01:09:00,890
you don't get a lot of metals for 
retreating.

1213
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:04,310
It's not exactly what he was hoping to 
do with an army in this war,

1214
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:08,510
so we requests to von Moltke can I 
attack now?

1215
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:11,060
This goes against the idea of what he 
supposed to do,

1216
01:09:11,061 --> 01:09:16,061
right?
He's the retreat or he pulls his French 

1217
01:09:16,061 --> 01:09:16,061
force away from where the hammer is 
going to hit,

1218
01:09:16,061 --> 01:09:19,760
but he makes a pretty good case.
These French are asking for it.

1219
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:24,890
They're sitting ducks.
They have been sort of like getting more

1220
01:09:24,891 --> 01:09:29,891
and more disordered and strung out after
days of pursuing us and we'd been 

1221
01:09:29,891 --> 01:09:31,640
shooting them with artillery and 
weakening them.

1222
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:34,880
They are ripe for a counter attack,
will crush them,

1223
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:41,050
and this is one of several incidents 
that will happen literally in the next 

1224
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:45,520
few days that some historians have 
pointed to for years as the moment when 

1225
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:45,520
the Germans lost the war.

1226
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:51,700
In this case,
some historians say that mold because 

1227
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:53,630
responds to Crown Prince Rubric Dot 
Riveria last him the war.

1228
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:58,400
He told group raked that he could 
counter attack.

1229
01:09:58,401 --> 01:10:02,480
The French were strung out and 
disorganized and asking for it,

1230
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:07,400
and on August 20th he does.
He crushes them.

1231
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:14,810
Now,
this is the time where you get to see 

1232
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:19,160
perhaps from a soldier's perspective,
the thing that had changed battle and 

1233
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:23,721
warfare the most really coming into its 
own machine guns made a huge difference.

1234
01:10:24,361 --> 01:10:26,730
Make no mistake about it,
and there were a lot of things that seem

1235
01:10:26,731 --> 01:10:30,180
relatively benign when you look at them 
that made huge differences too,

1236
01:10:30,181 --> 01:10:35,181
like barbed wire,
but the element that technology in land 

1237
01:10:35,181 --> 01:10:39,711
warfare had altered the most in terms of
something that would change the face of 

1238
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:45,111
warfare and how it was fought and 
experienced by human beings on the 

1239
01:10:45,111 --> 01:10:48,291
ground.
Artillery had come leaps and bounds 

1240
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:53,510
beyond anything anyone had expected and 
it's artillery that on August 20th hits 

1241
01:10:53,971 --> 01:10:58,971
the French when they're still in tight 
columns marching and mustering and just 

1242
01:11:01,021 --> 01:11:02,850
sitting around.
I mean later in the war,

1243
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:06,540
Ernst,
young or German soldier will write about

1244
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:08,280
the effect on a shell.

1245
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:12,120
One single artillery shell landing in a 
group of people that were just,

1246
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:17,240
you know,
sitting around a town square 150 of his 

1247
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,150
soldier comrades.
And he said,

1248
01:11:18,151 --> 01:11:20,370
the one shell killed 70 of them 
outright.

1249
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:25,710
Now imagine if you're in March column or
if you're gathered around a a mess,

1250
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:31,070
a senator or a taking a religious 
service in,

1251
01:11:31,771 --> 01:11:36,771
in the field or whatever when you're 
closely matched with your buddies and 

1252
01:11:36,771 --> 01:11:40,251
then modern artillery hits you and 
remember part of this is the technology 

1253
01:11:40,251 --> 01:11:45,111
of the guns.
The other part of it is the science and 

1254
01:11:45,111 --> 01:11:45,111
engineering that goes into,
you know,

1255
01:11:45,111 --> 01:11:47,880
making artillery effective,
not just shooting the gun up in the air,

1256
01:11:47,881 --> 01:11:50,910
but you should see the,
the scientific calculations,

1257
01:11:50,911 --> 01:11:55,911
these soldiers on the ground,
so the mathematics they had to do to 

1258
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:58,461
make sure that everything was honed in 
the right way and everything and that 

1259
01:11:58,461 --> 01:12:00,630
really differentiated by the way the 
good armies from the less good armies.

1260
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:03,990
The Russians had a ton of artillery.
They didn't have good engineering people

1261
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:09,020
shooting it,
so it was often inaccurate and not 

1262
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:11,031
effective.
The British and the French and the 

1263
01:12:11,031 --> 01:12:12,741
Germans had exceptional people working 
their artillery and it was very 

1264
01:12:12,741 --> 01:12:15,780
effective and the German artillery was 
bigger and better than anything that the

1265
01:12:15,781 --> 01:12:20,781
French had.
This is where they find out that that 

1266
01:12:20,781 --> 01:12:22,911
idea of that light mobile,
75 millimeter artillery getting the job 

1267
01:12:22,911 --> 01:12:24,360
done in every situation was horribly 
flawed.

1268
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:27,570
In fact,
it was outraged by the German pieces.

1269
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:30,630
The Germans could hit it when they 
couldn't hit the Germans.

1270
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:36,260
When the German army under Crown Prince 
Rupert hits the French in a counter 

1271
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:38,940
attack on August 20th,
the artillery just devastates them.

1272
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:43,130
As historian Eric burroughs writes,
quote,

1273
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:48,570
the first furious fighting occurred in 
southern Lorraine were the French second

1274
01:12:48,571 --> 01:12:53,571
army having progressed 35 kilometers was
hit at Marangu by the German army,

1275
01:12:54,001 --> 01:12:59,001
the counterattack with superior 
artillery fire from 105 millimeter and 

1276
01:12:59,001 --> 01:13:00,450
150 millimeter howitzers.

1277
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:05,750
The barrage crushed second army 
formations that we're assembling in 

1278
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:09,351
tight ranks for the day is March,
forcing it to flee and thereby 

1279
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:11,610
compelling and exposed first army to 
retreat as well.

1280
01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:17,150
End Quote.
Now what Bros is talking about there is 

1281
01:13:17,150 --> 01:13:19,740
that when the Germans crushed the French
second army and it has to retreat,

1282
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:25,340
it creates a hole in the line and that's
the most dangerous thing for any of 

1283
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:30,051
these armies.
They want to main maintain an unbroken 

1284
01:13:30,051 --> 01:13:32,010
line because if there are places that 
can be penetrated by enemy forces,

1285
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:37,250
those forces can move into those gaps 
and then if they turn right or turn 

1286
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:41,541
left,
they're hitting another army in the 

1287
01:13:41,541 --> 01:13:43,551
flank where it's terribly vulnerable or 
they could continue to go deeper into 

1288
01:13:43,551 --> 01:13:46,770
the interior and strike at logistics and
supply and rear areas.

1289
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:49,840
I mean the whole point is don't allow 
you know,

1290
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:54,860
a gap to open up in your line and do 
whatever you can to create or exploit,

1291
01:13:55,750 --> 01:14:00,750
you know,
your enemy doing something like that 

1292
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:00,750
with their forces.

1293
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:03,870
So when second army gets smashed and has
to retreat backwards,

1294
01:14:03,871 --> 01:14:08,871
first army has to go with them just to 
make sure that the line stays unbroken 

1295
01:14:08,871 --> 01:14:12,831
and nobody can get into our interior.
Now there's a lot of different things 

1296
01:14:13,271 --> 01:14:16,360
you might be able to draw a conclusion 
wise from what happened,

1297
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:21,760
you know,
in Alsace and lorraine were those two 

1298
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,230
armies were hit by the Germans.
Gioffre decided that this allowed him to

1299
01:14:23,231 --> 01:14:26,440
see where the Germans were weak.
As we mentioned earlier,

1300
01:14:26,441 --> 01:14:28,450
this is about playing chess without 
knowing,

1301
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:30,790
you know,
where the other guys pieces are.

1302
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:36,570
Part of what [inaudible] offers got to 
do as a commander is some detective 

1303
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:39,451
work.
He has a rough idea how many forces the 

1304
01:14:39,451 --> 01:14:39,610
Germans have.
If he can identify,

1305
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:41,500
you know,
where those forces are,

1306
01:14:41,501 --> 01:14:43,600
he can start to figure out where the 
rest are.

1307
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:48,820
He figures if he's getting so hammered 
down in the south on August 20th,

1308
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:52,660
and if he believes that general on his 
flank,

1309
01:14:52,661 --> 01:14:57,661
the fifth army general that keeps 
telling him the Germans are making a 

1310
01:14:57,661 --> 01:14:59,380
major effort through Belgium,
where are all those troops coming from?

1311
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:01,870
They have to be pulled from somewhere.
You offer.

1312
01:15:01,871 --> 01:15:06,871
Figured the Germans are weak.
At that point he decided that they had 

1313
01:15:06,871 --> 01:15:10,110
been pulled from the German center,
so there's strong down in Alsace.

1314
01:15:10,111 --> 01:15:15,111
Lorraine by Switzerland.
They're strong up in Belgium where 

1315
01:15:15,111 --> 01:15:15,111
they've knocked down those sports in 
there.

1316
01:15:15,111 --> 01:15:16,210
They're coming at us like a door on a 
hinge,

1317
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:21,270
so they're weak in the middle.
Shot for made a major mistake here and 

1318
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:24,100
the major mistake was assuming the 
Germans would treat their reserve forces

1319
01:15:24,101 --> 01:15:27,400
the same way the French did,
the reserve forces are those forces that

1320
01:15:27,401 --> 01:15:32,401
are not as competent,
not as highly trained as the regular 

1321
01:15:32,401 --> 01:15:34,891
military forces and the French practice 
with those forces was to keep them in 

1322
01:15:34,891 --> 01:15:35,230
the reserve,
you know,

1323
01:15:35,231 --> 01:15:37,040
keep them back away from the action,
you know,

1324
01:15:37,041 --> 01:15:39,970
use them to support people when you need
more troops thrown in,

1325
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:45,210
but don't put them anywhere vulnerable 
where you could lose the war with 

1326
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:45,210
inexperienced,
you know,

1327
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:46,660
not up to standard troops like that.

1328
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:52,110
The Germans totally integrated their 
reserves into their armies and it 

1329
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:55,291
planned for this for a long time.
They were using all their reserves so 

1330
01:15:55,721 --> 01:15:59,200
they had greater numbers actually 
involved in all these combats.

1331
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:04,560
Then Jennifer's estimations,
and this will cost him dearly when he 

1332
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:09,181
attacks the center of the German line in
the battle of the frontiers on August 

1333
01:16:09,181 --> 01:16:10,030
20,
first 22nd.

1334
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:16,200
And the center is a weird area because 
if the left is up by Belgium and the 

1335
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:16,570
right is down by,
you know,

1336
01:16:16,571 --> 01:16:20,110
Alsace Lorraine and Switzerland.
The center is the part where the terrain

1337
01:16:20,111 --> 01:16:21,530
is hard to fight in.
You know,

1338
01:16:21,531 --> 01:16:26,531
the giant Ardin forest is there and it's
hilly terrain with not a lot of roads,

1339
01:16:26,921 --> 01:16:28,600
difficult country,
right?

1340
01:16:28,601 --> 01:16:32,200
It's the same country that everyone was 
so shocked when the Germans came through

1341
01:16:32,201 --> 01:16:37,201
it with tanks in the second world war 
because it was thought to be 

1342
01:16:37,201 --> 01:16:37,201
impenetrable.

1343
01:16:37,201 --> 01:16:37,870
Well,
in the first world war,

1344
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:41,020
that's where the Shatford decides to 
attack because he's determined that they

1345
01:16:41,021 --> 01:16:42,520
must.
The Germans must be weak there.

1346
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:48,120
What's more,
this is how he's going to deal now with 

1347
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,180
this sledgehammer issue.
If it really exists,

1348
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:54,270
he's going to cut it off.
He's going to launch his attack at the 

1349
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:57,211
German center,
right where that hinge point is with a 

1350
01:16:57,211 --> 01:16:59,821
door swings between the forces of the 
Germans that move and the forces of the 

1351
01:16:59,821 --> 01:17:04,501
Germans that stay stationary.
There should be a gap smashed through 

1352
01:17:04,501 --> 01:17:04,501
there.
Get behind them,

1353
01:17:04,570 --> 01:17:09,570
drive all the way up until you hit the 
North Sea or the English Channel and cut

1354
01:17:09,601 --> 01:17:14,601
off that sledge hammer head.
It's not a bad idea if he can make it 

1355
01:17:15,551 --> 01:17:16,870
work.
It's like judo.

1356
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:21,190
You just took that great enemy advantage
of so many good troops in one location.

1357
01:17:21,191 --> 01:17:26,191
They're like a steam roller and turned 
it into a negative because now you're 

1358
01:17:26,191 --> 01:17:27,790
going to cut off the best part of the 
enemy army surrounded and kill it.

1359
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:32,940
You know in one place.
It's a great idea if you can make it 

1360
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:32,950
work.
The French are totally incapable at this

1361
01:17:32,951 --> 01:17:34,900
point in the war of making something 
like that work

1362
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:38,770
because they hadn't learned what kind of
war they were in yet.

1363
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:41,290
That's what the battle of the frontiers 
is going to be.

1364
01:17:41,470 --> 01:17:44,830
This first round of this fight where 
where everybody's throwing haymakers and

1365
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:49,831
getting smacked on the jaw.
It's going to teach a lot of lessons to 

1366
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:51,160
people.
Jennifer will fire more generals in this

1367
01:17:51,161 --> 01:17:56,161
first month of the war than anybody's 
ever fired in history and a lot of the 

1368
01:17:56,161 --> 01:17:58,150
other militaries will do similar things 
because this is where we find out,

1369
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:03,280
you know,
which generals can really fight in war 

1370
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:05,191
time and which ones are more peace time 
kind of generals and within a couple of 

1371
01:18:05,191 --> 01:18:07,880
months you'll have much more competent 
people you know,

1372
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:10,870
at the helmet a lot of places,
which makes it a little less fun.

1373
01:18:10,871 --> 01:18:12,310
I mean,
right now it's,

1374
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:17,980
you know,
the wild west out here and you have all 

1375
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:19,981
kinds of different quality people.
Take the Russian generals that were 

1376
01:18:19,981 --> 01:18:23,020
going to deal with in a minute.
I mean there's variable quality and this

1377
01:18:23,021 --> 01:18:26,590
becomes a real live fire test for a lot 
of these people

1378
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:33,180
on the 21st of August and the 22nd of 
August,

1379
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:36,520
I'm Jennifer launches his big offensive 
in the yard.

1380
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:40,110
Dan,
he assumes he's running into an inferior

1381
01:18:40,111 --> 01:18:43,080
number of German forces based on his 
calculations.

1382
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:48,560
He's instead walking into a situation 
where he's facing almost equal numbers 

1383
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:53,451
of troops and their dugin.
I'm waiting for him and this is where 

1384
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:59,660
the idea of bay and net attacks and 
charging machine guns and not digging in

1385
01:19:02,941 --> 01:19:03,990
with your red pants.
I mean,

1386
01:19:03,991 --> 01:19:06,150
we didn't even mention the fact that 
none of these armies,

1387
01:19:06,151 --> 01:19:09,090
none of them are going into this war 
with helmets.

1388
01:19:09,210 --> 01:19:11,130
There are no helmets,
folks,

1389
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:13,830
they're wearing caps.
Okay.

1390
01:19:13,831 --> 01:19:16,440
You know how many people are going to 
die because of that mistake.

1391
01:19:18,450 --> 01:19:22,260
This is all kind of when that romance in
war gets shot down,

1392
01:19:22,410 --> 01:19:23,130
literally,

1393
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:28,880
I mean to people of a 19th century sort 
of worldview and attitudes about honor 

1394
01:19:29,311 --> 01:19:31,530
and duty and the things that are 
expected of,

1395
01:19:31,531 --> 01:19:33,300
for example,
officers in the field,

1396
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:38,600
this idea of French officers standing up
with a sword and in a white gloves and 

1397
01:19:39,511 --> 01:19:44,511
often the white hat in a storm of steel 
in a move that is absolutely suicidal 

1398
01:19:45,721 --> 01:19:48,390
and those brave people must have known 
it.

1399
01:19:48,391 --> 01:19:53,391
Imagine how the soul gets conflicted and
knowing to do your duty and live up to 

1400
01:19:53,391 --> 01:19:58,041
the standards and expectations of your 
countrymen and your people during this 

1401
01:19:58,041 --> 01:20:01,311
time period.
You were expected to stand up there and 

1402
01:20:01,311 --> 01:20:05,160
and essentially face sure death when you
might survive simply by laying on the 

1403
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:09,951
ground and throw away that white hat and
just just kind of hide behind that tree 

1404
01:20:09,951 --> 01:20:13,881
or whatnot,
but at the top permitted is a romance 

1405
01:20:13,881 --> 01:20:13,980
and certain standards and this is a 
heroic death.

1406
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:16,170
This is what the elder von Moltke was 
talking about.

1407
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:19,770
You know that we quoted earlier where we
talked about how perpetual peace was not

1408
01:20:19,771 --> 01:20:24,771
even a good dream because you lose all 
these wonderful values that warfare 

1409
01:20:24,771 --> 01:20:26,580
brings out to him,
that officer,

1410
01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:30,780
those officers,
those many hundreds of officers dying on

1411
01:20:30,781 --> 01:20:33,810
these fields in their white gloves 
because they wouldn't take cover.

1412
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:37,410
We're doing something beautiful,
an admirable.

1413
01:20:37,890 --> 01:20:42,890
Remember he said in that quote,
we used that in war man's noblest.

1414
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:46,620
Virtues come into play.
Courage and renunciation,

1415
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:51,890
fidelity to duty and a readiness for 
sacrifice that does not stop at giving 

1416
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:54,330
up life itself.
To him,

1417
01:20:54,331 --> 01:20:57,660
this is the charge of the light brigade 
over and over and over again.

1418
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:02,900
Modern people look at this as foolish to
us.

1419
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:05,910
It's a waste of that officer's life and 
potential.

1420
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:11,240
Use Him in a way that will achieve a 
useful and if he has to give up his 

1421
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:12,180
life,
sell it more dearly than that.

1422
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:17,070
Two people of the time period.
You know that that ends really with this

1423
01:21:17,071 --> 01:21:22,071
war.
There was value in what those officers 

1424
01:21:22,071 --> 01:21:25,851
were doing simply by dying like that and
upholding the standards,

1425
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:31,880
you know,
that they were upholding by doing so a 

1426
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,341
higher fidelity to duty and readiness to
sacrifice as von mold cassette.

1427
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:39,980
One of the things that this war changes 
is that whole view,

1428
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:46,030
the people in 1918 at the end of this 
war would feel very similar to the way 

1429
01:21:46,030 --> 01:21:50,381
we do about how stupid it is to stand up
in a hailstorm of steel and just,

1430
01:21:51,110 --> 01:21:52,760
you know,
sacrifice your life for nothing.

1431
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:58,120
The generation that does that in 1914 
and most of which doesn't make it 

1432
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:01,901
through the war.
They had a different way of looking at 

1433
01:22:01,901 --> 01:22:05,351
things and older way and that's why this
war is often seen as a separation point 

1434
01:22:07,551 --> 01:22:09,500
in history between one world and 
another.

1435
01:22:11,470 --> 01:22:16,470
The running into this new world as part 
of this attack against the giant center 

1436
01:22:17,351 --> 01:22:22,351
of the front,
through the yard in forest and 

1437
01:22:22,351 --> 01:22:22,351
everything comes off sounding like a dry
affair.

1438
01:22:22,351 --> 01:22:23,890
Um,
when historians write about it,

1439
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,530
not that they're dry,
but listen,

1440
01:22:25,570 --> 01:22:29,620
history sometimes takes the emotion and 
the blood and everything out of it.

1441
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:34,920
I mean,
David Stevenson has a great one volume 

1442
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:38,041
work on the war and here's how he 
describes these offensives by genre and 

1443
01:22:38,041 --> 01:22:41,080
the French to strike against what is 
certainly a week German center,

1444
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:43,000
right?
He says,

1445
01:22:43,001 --> 01:22:45,940
quote,
the result was a multiple disaster.

1446
01:22:46,090 --> 01:22:51,090
The French forces entering the arden 
were weaker than the Germans in 

1447
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:53,110
reconnaissance cavalry.
And on the morning of 22nd August,

1448
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:58,260
missed grounded their aircraft groping 
forward in echelon along the few roads 

1449
01:22:58,511 --> 01:23:01,930
through the forest,
they blundered nodding to weaker forces,

1450
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:05,110
but into 21 divisions against their own 
20.

1451
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:06,160
They're 75

1452
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:11,160
millimeter field guns were ineffective 
in the hilly terrain and poorly linked 

1453
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:15,301
by telephone with the infantry.
They were no answer to the German 

1454
01:23:15,301 --> 01:23:17,110
machine,
guns and field howitzers which retallack

1455
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:18,760
and quote,

1456
01:23:20,570 --> 01:23:22,280
what is wreaking havoc.
Mean.

1457
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:28,660
Historian Peter Hart's book on the Great
War has many wonderful firsthand 

1458
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:33,070
accounts of what these experiences were 
like and hard himself writes about the 

1459
01:23:33,651 --> 01:23:37,670
stumbling into each other that are these
battles in the middle of the front,

1460
01:23:37,671 --> 01:23:42,110
through this forested hilly terrain 
quote in these battles,

1461
01:23:42,111 --> 01:23:47,111
few people at any level of command had 
much idea of what was happening and for 

1462
01:23:47,111 --> 01:23:49,190
the troops on the ground.
It was all utterly baffling.

1463
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:54,400
Prewar tactic seemed to have no impact.
Bayonet charge is lead only to more 

1464
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:58,160
slaughter while calling up artillery.
Support was often doomed to failure.

1465
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,710
He says,
quote,

1466
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:03,170
sometimes the gunners were too far 
behind,

1467
01:24:03,290 --> 01:24:06,770
sometimes too close and caught under 
fire from the longer range.

1468
01:24:06,771 --> 01:24:09,380
German guns,
whatever the reason he writes.

1469
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:12,320
The infantry were often left in 
desperate straits,

1470
01:24:12,710 --> 01:24:17,710
and then he quotes a captain from the 
hundred and third regiment who was 

1471
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:17,710
caught in desperate straits.

1472
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:20,810
Quote,
my company was sustaining heavy losses.

1473
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:26,020
Evidently,
it's action was hampering the enemy who 

1474
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:26,270
concentrated the combined fire of his 
infantry,

1475
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:28,580
artillery,
and machine guns on us.

1476
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:33,790
We were surrounded by a heavy cloud,
which at times completely veiled the 

1477
01:24:33,790 --> 01:24:36,560
battlefield from our eyes.
Little Burger guy or sprang up shouted,

1478
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:41,060
Viva La France at the top of his voice 
and fell dead among the men lying on the

1479
01:24:41,061 --> 01:24:46,061
ground.
One could no longer distinguish the 

1480
01:24:46,061 --> 01:24:48,311
living from the dead.
The first were entirely absolved by 

1481
01:24:48,311 --> 01:24:48,920
their grim duty.
The others lay motionless.

1482
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:51,530
The wounded offered a truly impressive 
sight.

1483
01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:56,450
The quote continues sometimes they would
stand up bloody and horrible looking.

1484
01:24:56,540 --> 01:25:01,540
Amidst burst of gunfire,
they ran aimlessly around arms 

1485
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:04,190
stretching out before them,
eyes staring at the ground,

1486
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:07,790
turning round and round until hit buy 
fresh bullets.

1487
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:11,420
They would stop and fall heavily.
Heart rending cries,

1488
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:16,510
agonizing appeals and horrible groans 
were intermingled with the sinister 

1489
01:25:16,510 --> 01:25:20,651
howling of projectiles.
Furious contortions told of strong 

1490
01:25:20,651 --> 01:25:22,820
youthful bodies refusing to give up 
life.

1491
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:27,410
One man was trying to replace his bloody
dangling hand was shattered wrist.

1492
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:32,600
Another ran from the line holding the 
bowels falling out of his belly and 

1493
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:33,380
through his tattered clothes.
Before long,

1494
01:25:33,381 --> 01:25:37,640
a bullet struck him down.
We had no support from our artillery,

1495
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:40,550
and you have to Reagan's in our division
and in the army corps.

1496
01:25:40,551 --> 01:25:43,280
Besides those destroyed on the road.
Where were they?

1497
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:47,340
Why didn't they arrive?
We were alone in quote

1498
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:54,400
27,000
freshmen will die on the 22nd of August.

1499
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:59,090
Many,
many more will be badly,

1500
01:25:59,091 --> 01:26:01,550
badly wounded,
and maimed and scarred for life.

1501
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,060
Now,
let's put

1502
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:07,540
this in perspective.
One hundred years before this time,

1503
01:26:07,541 --> 01:26:12,070
Napoleon used to brag to his opponents 
that you cannot stop me.

1504
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:17,370
I spend 30,000
lives a month as though that was a big 

1505
01:26:17,370 --> 01:26:21,280
deal in back when Napoleon said it.
It was the French had just lost 30,000

1506
01:26:21,281 --> 01:26:26,281
lives that day and their contact against
the other major army that had 

1507
01:26:27,821 --> 01:26:32,350
precipitated all those deaths has only 
been about 24 hours long.

1508
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:35,830
What's tomorrow going to look like?
And the next day

1509
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:40,410
already troops were dealing with,
you know,

1510
01:26:40,411 --> 01:26:43,530
a new phenomenon created by this 
artillery,

1511
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:48,770
the bigger heavy guns,
the extra ammunition and the fact that 

1512
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:51,260
battles are going on for a long time now
and people stay in place for awhile mean

1513
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:55,680
that people are staying under artillery 
barrage for longer and longer periods of

1514
01:26:55,681 --> 01:27:00,681
time.
This is a frightfully upsetting 

1515
01:27:00,681 --> 01:27:00,681
experience,
as you might imagine,

1516
01:27:00,681 --> 01:27:03,960
and it begins to drive people insane,
right?

1517
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:08,990
As the war starts,
a French sergeant wrote in his diary 

1518
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:11,640
about these offensives and Dr Dan on 
August 20,

1519
01:27:11,641 --> 01:27:12,870
first 22nd,
and he said,

1520
01:27:12,871 --> 01:27:16,320
quote,
the guns recoil at each shot,

1521
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:21,620
night is falling and they look like old 
men sticking out their tongues and 

1522
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:22,380
spitting fire.
Heaps of corpses.

1523
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,750
French and German are lying every which 
way.

1524
01:27:24,751 --> 01:27:27,180
Rifles in hand,
rain is falling.

1525
01:27:27,181 --> 01:27:30,390
Shells are screaming and bursting shells
all the time.

1526
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:35,600
Artillery fire is the worst.
I lay all night listening to the 

1527
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:35,600
wounded,
groaning.

1528
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,710
Some were German.
The Canon nading goes on.

1529
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:40,620
Whenever it stops,
we hear the wounded crying from all over

1530
01:27:40,621 --> 01:27:43,460
the woods.
Two or three men go mad every day

1531
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:45,930
and quote,

1532
01:27:47,890 --> 01:27:52,890
a man who will turn out to be one of 
France's greatest public figures in the 

1533
01:27:52,890 --> 01:27:56,941
20th century was at these battles too.
He had been indoctrinated like everyone 

1534
01:27:57,071 --> 01:28:02,071
else in the romance and the heroism and 
the ideas of the band at charge and the 

1535
01:28:02,071 --> 01:28:05,590
offensive and all these military ideas 
from another age.

1536
01:28:06,190 --> 01:28:10,870
It took him one bottle to learn the 
lessons that it would take commanders on

1537
01:28:10,871 --> 01:28:13,240
all sides in this war,
quite a bit longer to learn.

1538
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:18,780
Lieutenant Charles de Gaulle wrote of 
these battles and his experience in 

1539
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:18,980
them,
quote,

1540
01:28:19,630 --> 01:28:24,630
suddenly the enemy's fire became precise
and concentrated second-by-second the 

1541
01:28:24,641 --> 01:28:27,430
hail of bullets and the thunder.
The shells grew stronger.

1542
01:28:27,730 --> 01:28:32,730
Those who survived the lay flat on the 
ground amidst the screaming wounded in 

1543
01:28:32,730 --> 01:28:36,631
the humble corpses with affected calm.
The officers let themselves be killed,

1544
01:28:36,791 --> 01:28:40,630
standing upright.
Some obstinate platoons stuck their band

1545
01:28:40,631 --> 01:28:43,810
that's into their rifles.
Bugle sound into the charge.

1546
01:28:43,930 --> 01:28:48,130
Isolated heroes made fantastic leaps,
but all to no purpose.

1547
01:28:48,310 --> 01:28:53,310
In an instant,
it did become clear that not all the 

1548
01:28:53,310 --> 01:28:53,310
courage in the world could withstand 
this fire,

1549
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:54,650
and to quote

1550
01:28:55,770 --> 01:29:00,770
the machines that had always been 
important on the battlefields of 

1551
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:03,720
humankind had become the dominant 
factor.

1552
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:08,750
What had become a tool to be used by man
was now something that was so 

1553
01:29:09,571 --> 01:29:14,571
devastating in the hands of each other 
that the entire ideas about warfare that

1554
01:29:15,511 --> 01:29:20,511
had been in play in most societies 
during those time periods up until this 

1555
01:29:20,511 --> 01:29:23,550
era are all of a sudden no longer 
viable.

1556
01:29:25,950 --> 01:29:30,950
The Battle of the frontiers in just a 
couple of days manages to completely 

1557
01:29:31,651 --> 01:29:36,651
change the whole complexion of the war.
What it seemed to be leading up to a 

1558
01:29:36,931 --> 01:29:41,931
German defeat all of a sudden looks like
maybe the Germans are going to win this 

1559
01:29:42,931 --> 01:29:47,760
war and quickly nobody expects the 
French to lose and a couple of days more

1560
01:29:47,761 --> 01:29:52,130
than 75,000
men killed and more than 250,000

1561
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:57,140
wounded.
That stuns everyone but the French 

1562
01:29:57,140 --> 01:30:01,431
especially,
and you have to understand how many 

1563
01:30:01,431 --> 01:30:01,800
people this is the American still 
celebrate.

1564
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,660
You know,
in a morbid sort of way.

1565
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:09,110
The famous civil war battle of Antietam 
famously called the bloodiest day in 

1566
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:13,431
American history in terms of warfare and
partly because it's a civil war and 

1567
01:30:13,431 --> 01:30:14,670
everybody dying on both sides happens to
be American,

1568
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:19,710
but those casualty levels for comparison
purposes are about 6,000.

1569
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:21,280
A little less than 6,000
dead,

1570
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:24,090
I think,
and a little less than 20,000

1571
01:30:24,091 --> 01:30:25,980
wounded.
6,000

1572
01:30:25,981 --> 01:30:26,820
dead,
20,000

1573
01:30:26,821 --> 01:30:30,690
wounded compared to more than 75,000
dead in 260,000

1574
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:34,470
wounded in the first couple of days of 
action on the western front.

1575
01:30:34,471 --> 01:30:38,430
The French are just stunned and now if 
you're the German general,

1576
01:30:38,431 --> 01:30:43,431
put yourself in von Moltke shoes.
Remember the stress we talked about and 

1577
01:30:43,431 --> 01:30:43,860
all of a sudden you are presented with a
dilemma.

1578
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:47,610
If you just did this to your opponent 
and you've stunned them in,

1579
01:30:47,611 --> 01:30:50,250
they're on the ropes and they look like 
deer in the headlights for a minute.

1580
01:30:50,370 --> 01:30:55,370
What do you do?
Do you stick with the original plan and 

1581
01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:55,370
say,
listen,

1582
01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:57,510
we're not supposed to attack here.
We have the sledge hammer going.

1583
01:30:57,511 --> 01:31:02,511
Stick with a sledge hammer and just let 
the French recover in front of you 

1584
01:31:02,511 --> 01:31:03,330
because it's part of the plan,
or do you say,

1585
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:08,340
as the uncle of unmold Qa so famously 
did that.

1586
01:31:08,341 --> 01:31:13,341
No battle plan survives first contact 
with the enemy and look at this as an 

1587
01:31:13,341 --> 01:31:17,811
opportunity,
a battlefield opportunity that presents 

1588
01:31:17,811 --> 01:31:20,481
itself multiple has to make some 
decisions here and it becomes another 

1589
01:31:20,481 --> 01:31:22,590
place in the story where historians have
argued ever sense whether or not he lost

1590
01:31:22,591 --> 01:31:24,310
a war here?
No,

1591
01:31:24,490 --> 01:31:26,820
those who didn't believe you lost it 
earlier in the story.

1592
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:32,060
A lot of them believe he lost it here 
and a lot of German generals writing 

1593
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:32,060
memoirs after the war,
you know,

1594
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:34,920
needle him about this savagely making 
bad decisions,

1595
01:31:34,921 --> 01:31:35,790
weakening the plan.

1596
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:40,970
What we all have to understand about the
plan as it's normally thought of and 

1597
01:31:41,371 --> 01:31:44,790
some very good modern historians have 
done a great job of pointing this out,

1598
01:31:45,090 --> 01:31:50,090
is that the plan was probably flawed 
from the get go and was probably never 

1599
01:31:50,090 --> 01:31:53,110
meant to be implemented in the way a lot
of these German generals portrayed it.

1600
01:31:53,130 --> 01:31:58,130
And even more important than that,
evidence seems to show that members of 

1601
01:31:58,130 --> 01:31:59,500
the general staff,
maybe von Moltke included,

1602
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:02,620
never thought the plan was going to win 
the war anyway,

1603
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:06,250
which means it becomes your plan for 
starting the conflict.

1604
01:32:06,251 --> 01:32:08,000
And then once everything is in motion,
you know,

1605
01:32:08,001 --> 01:32:10,060
you look for opportunities,
you try to create some,

1606
01:32:10,070 --> 01:32:13,160
you try to exploit French mistakes.
That's traditional generalship,

1607
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:18,270
right?
So what the French are doing on their 

1608
01:32:18,270 --> 01:32:20,101
side.
And so von Moltke make some decisions 

1609
01:32:20,101 --> 01:32:21,220
based on having slammed the French so 
hard.

1610
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:23,980
He's got prince rubric does very,
uh,

1611
01:32:23,981 --> 01:32:27,550
down in the south screaming that now 
that he's pushed the French back all the

1612
01:32:27,551 --> 01:32:28,960
way to the French border.
Why did he,

1613
01:32:28,990 --> 01:32:33,990
why did he just slammed them?
He could collapse the whole southern 

1614
01:32:33,990 --> 01:32:36,580
flank and if the whole southern flank 
collapses and you still get the northern

1615
01:32:36,581 --> 01:32:38,740
flank collapsing because of your sledge 
hammer,

1616
01:32:38,741 --> 01:32:41,080
my gosh,
you've recreated the battle of cannae.

1617
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:43,750
It's like the Romans and handle all over
again.

1618
01:32:43,751 --> 01:32:47,470
It's every generals dream.
A double envelopment,

1619
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:51,100
a total surrounding.
I mean it von Moltke.

1620
01:32:51,101 --> 01:32:54,340
We're less of an art fanatic and more of
a military,

1621
01:32:54,341 --> 01:32:55,380
um,
you know,

1622
01:32:55,420 --> 01:33:00,420
hobbyist.
I would think he would find that 

1623
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:00,420
irresistible.
Who knows,

1624
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:02,920
maybe he's just looking for 
opportunities to outflank French forces.

1625
01:33:02,921 --> 01:33:05,320
As historian David Stevenson suggests 
here,

1626
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:07,420
um,
quote,

1627
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:10,600
mold,
because actions at this juncture suggest

1628
01:33:10,601 --> 01:33:13,510
that he was determined to protect 
Germany's territory,

1629
01:33:13,660 --> 01:33:15,880
whether in east,
Prussia or Alsace,

1630
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:21,000
but willing to strike wherever the enemy
seemed weak rather than staking 

1631
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,360
everything on his right flank and to 
quote.

1632
01:33:23,930 --> 01:33:28,090
So the staking everything on the right 
flank idea is just what you do.

1633
01:33:28,091 --> 01:33:30,220
If no other better opportunities 
develop.

1634
01:33:30,370 --> 01:33:34,330
And when Crown Prince rubrics suggest 
attacking the French down in the south,

1635
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:37,450
again,
fun Mocha thinks about it and says,

1636
01:33:37,451 --> 01:33:42,451
okay,
and agrees to take some forces that 

1637
01:33:42,451 --> 01:33:46,501
would be used to bolster the sledge 
hammer head and instead use them on the 

1638
01:33:46,501 --> 01:33:51,031
total other side of the flank down south
to help rubric in his offensive against 

1639
01:33:51,521 --> 01:33:56,521
the French in the south,
to the plan is now being diluted in the 

1640
01:33:56,521 --> 01:33:58,150
minds of the purists and they may be 
right.

1641
01:33:58,151 --> 01:34:00,410
I'm not taking sides,
I'm just saying the traditional ideas,

1642
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:05,460
but the Maloca screwed up the war here 
now and some very good historians are 

1643
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:05,460
saying,
not at all.

1644
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:10,291
This is what you were trying to do.
Look for opportunities and exploit them 

1645
01:34:10,291 --> 01:34:14,161
without losing the war elsewhere,
which creates a situation though that 

1646
01:34:14,161 --> 01:34:18,181
Malacca himself even says after the war 
was a mistake and it involves his 

1647
01:34:18,181 --> 01:34:20,170
attempts to try not to lose the war 
elsewhere.

1648
01:34:20,170 --> 01:34:21,910
But again,
if you put yourself in his position,

1649
01:34:22,210 --> 01:34:27,210
it's hard not to do this.
Multiple looks at the western front and 

1650
01:34:27,210 --> 01:34:30,270
it looks like it's going pretty well.
Know the battle of the frontiers and the

1651
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:35,420
battle in Alsace Alsace-lorraine.
All these things seem to show that the 

1652
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:36,970
Germans are better than the French.
As I said in the last episode.

1653
01:34:36,971 --> 01:34:38,140
This is,
in my opinion,

1654
01:34:38,141 --> 01:34:43,141
one of the great armies of all time and 
what they just showed is that they 

1655
01:34:43,141 --> 01:34:44,410
dominate another great army,
you know,

1656
01:34:44,411 --> 01:34:49,411
pretty easily.
And if you're von Moltke you could sit 

1657
01:34:49,411 --> 01:34:49,411
there and look at that and go,
okay,

1658
01:34:49,411 --> 01:34:49,411
well all of our calculations are out the
window.

1659
01:34:49,411 --> 01:34:51,760
Maybe we don't need such dominance in 
numbers.

1660
01:34:51,990 --> 01:34:56,990
You know,
where quality is such that maybe we 

1661
01:34:56,990 --> 01:34:57,980
could get away with taking a few troops 
from here and taken them to

1662
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:00,740
the east because the Russians are taken 
towns in east Prussia

1663
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:07,880
and that's what Malka did.
First he changed the commander's over 

1664
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:11,721
there.
He's sack the guys he was having 

1665
01:35:11,721 --> 01:35:13,011
problems with and he puts an old retired
guy who is more known for the Franco 

1666
01:35:13,011 --> 01:35:16,020
Prussian war services and in fact calls 
him out of retirement so quickly that he

1667
01:35:16,021 --> 01:35:19,020
has to put on his old blue uniform 
because he doesn't have one of the newer

1668
01:35:19,021 --> 01:35:24,021
gray ones.
The blue ones date back to the earlier 

1669
01:35:24,021 --> 01:35:25,890
war and combines this older retired guy 
whose name is Hindenburg,

1670
01:35:25,891 --> 01:35:30,891
Paul von Hindenburg with the hero from 
the German point of view of that attack 

1671
01:35:31,141 --> 01:35:32,130
against,
you know,

1672
01:35:32,131 --> 01:35:35,430
the Belgian city of Leanne and the 
fortress there who banged on the door of

1673
01:35:35,431 --> 01:35:40,431
the fortress with the hilt of a sword 
and took the surrender of the city kind 

1674
01:35:40,431 --> 01:35:41,490
of by himself,
sort of Erich Ludendorff,

1675
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:46,880
Ludina,
orphan Hindenburg get this job or sent 

1676
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:49,371
to the east to figure the situation out.
And then von Moltke sends them these 

1677
01:35:49,371 --> 01:35:49,371
troops,
which,

1678
01:35:49,371 --> 01:35:50,280
you know,
historians later said,

1679
01:35:50,281 --> 01:35:55,281
well,
it really needed those troops in the 

1680
01:35:55,281 --> 01:35:56,691
west.
He shouldn't defend them and he 

1681
01:35:56,691 --> 01:35:56,691
shouldn't have sent him,
but he didn't know that.

1682
01:35:56,691 --> 01:35:57,300
He said after the war was one of his 
biggest mistakes,

1683
01:35:57,390 --> 01:36:00,360
he shouldn't have them because it'll 
turn out that by the time the troops get

1684
01:36:00,510 --> 01:36:04,320
from the west to the east on the trains,
they are no longer needed.

1685
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:07,020
Now again,
you know what?

1686
01:36:07,021 --> 01:36:12,021
I'm not a historian,
although historians debate this and 

1687
01:36:12,021 --> 01:36:12,780
argue about it ever since.
So who knows?

1688
01:36:13,470 --> 01:36:15,030
Maybe we can all take a position on 
this,

1689
01:36:15,031 --> 01:36:18,660
but looking at it from the sources that 
I have,

1690
01:36:18,661 --> 01:36:21,840
looking at von Moltke as decision here 
looks like prudence.

1691
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:26,270
I mean the Russians are taking towns in 
east Prussia,

1692
01:36:26,271 --> 01:36:30,020
forcing the little teeny German forces 
that are there to retreat.

1693
01:36:30,170 --> 01:36:32,780
It looks like they're going to be 
threatening Berlin.

1694
01:36:32,781 --> 01:36:34,340
Meanwhile,
on the western front,

1695
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:39,760
it looks like the force you put there to
simply keep the French occupied while 

1696
01:36:40,131 --> 01:36:45,131
the killing force maneuvers around their
flank may have defeated the French all 

1697
01:36:45,381 --> 01:36:50,381
by themselves.
What happens when you beat the French 

1698
01:36:50,381 --> 01:36:50,381
before the killing thing even gets 
there,

1699
01:36:50,381 --> 01:36:54,940
and then someone wanders.
If you can spare a couple of cores for 

1700
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:57,851
the eastern front in von Moltke 
supposedly even asks one of the 

1701
01:36:57,851 --> 01:37:02,531
commanders of one of the armies that 
makes up this sledge hammer swinging 

1702
01:37:02,531 --> 01:37:07,061
gate thing.
You know that flanking force that's the 

1703
01:37:07,061 --> 01:37:09,911
size of Napoleon's grand army or the 
size of the Roman Empire's complete 

1704
01:37:10,161 --> 01:37:13,400
military at tight.
He asks the commander of Second Army von

1705
01:37:13,401 --> 01:37:16,010
Bulow,
can you spare a few core for the east?

1706
01:37:16,011 --> 01:37:17,240
And von Bulow says,
yeah,

1707
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:18,710
you know why?
He says,

1708
01:37:18,711 --> 01:37:20,960
yeah,
in part because he just matched a French

1709
01:37:20,961 --> 01:37:23,090
army in front of him during the battle 
of the frontiers,

1710
01:37:23,390 --> 01:37:28,130
which happened to be the poor fifth army
commanded by that one French general who

1711
01:37:28,131 --> 01:37:31,460
saw the sledge hammer forming even 
before the war started.

1712
01:37:31,461 --> 01:37:32,840
Poor General Len resnick,

1713
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:38,080
and because he argues with the high 
command to let him just shift his army a

1714
01:37:38,081 --> 01:37:43,081
little bit to protect its flanks.
Some historians think he saved Fifth 

1715
01:37:43,081 --> 01:37:45,070
Army from total annihilation.
He does have to retreat though,

1716
01:37:46,210 --> 01:37:51,210
move backwards once again to keep in 
line with the rest of the French forces 

1717
01:37:51,210 --> 01:37:52,390
that are retreating.
Sort of all along the line.

1718
01:37:53,110 --> 01:37:55,980
Meanwhile here,
the British.

1719
01:37:56,910 --> 01:38:00,600
Now this is a source of contention and 
legend like all this stuff.

1720
01:38:00,601 --> 01:38:03,120
Isn't it funny how much of this early 
war is,

1721
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:08,720
but the French had been badgering the 
British since the beginning of the war 

1722
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:08,720
to move faster,
move faster,

1723
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:13,101
move faster.
We need someone up here on our left 

1724
01:38:13,101 --> 01:38:13,101
flank.
It's critical,

1725
01:38:13,101 --> 01:38:13,101
right?
The French territorial,

1726
01:38:13,170 --> 01:38:18,170
a units together which are like an old 
man and reservists and stuff and put 

1727
01:38:18,170 --> 01:38:18,960
them out on the flank just so that 
there's something out there,

1728
01:38:18,961 --> 01:38:20,910
but against what's coming.

1729
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:26,360
I mean it's nothing and so they,
they hurry the British and the British 

1730
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:29,721
rush up and they,
they run into Belgium so that they can 

1731
01:38:29,721 --> 01:38:30,090
take the position on the left flank and 
protect,

1732
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:32,490
you know,
poor general [inaudible] army.

1733
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:35,790
And before they even get their lead 
resnick's moving the other direction,

1734
01:38:36,150 --> 01:38:41,150
he's backing up to stay in line with the
French armies exposing the British 

1735
01:38:41,150 --> 01:38:42,270
army's flank.
Again.

1736
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:47,450
You can read the British historians 
who've been mad about that ever since 

1737
01:38:47,450 --> 01:38:51,200
being left in the lurch by the French.
What's so funny is I read all these 

1738
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:52,710
accounts,
like the Irishman's account,

1739
01:38:52,950 --> 01:38:57,950
Lucy's account of a,
of arriving in France and how much the 

1740
01:38:57,950 --> 01:39:00,981
French loved them and these wonderful 
welcomes and then you read other 

1741
01:39:00,981 --> 01:39:01,080
accounts,
you know from later in the war where the

1742
01:39:01,081 --> 01:39:01,840
soldiers are going,
yeah,

1743
01:39:01,841 --> 01:39:03,810
the French don't much like us.
We don't like them.

1744
01:39:03,810 --> 01:39:08,810
They don't like us.
And the leadership in the British army 

1745
01:39:08,810 --> 01:39:09,720
didn't seem particularly pro French or 
vice versa.

1746
01:39:10,590 --> 01:39:14,370
There seemed to be a lot of arguing 
between them and then some weird order.

1747
01:39:14,371 --> 01:39:19,371
Although it's totally understandable by 
the head of the British military right 

1748
01:39:19,371 --> 01:39:20,610
before the f goes to France,
complicates everything,

1749
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,420
Lord her ratio,
kitchener,

1750
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:27,360
the British legend from the colonial 
wars.

1751
01:39:27,361 --> 01:39:28,770
You've never seen a guy like this,
by the way.

1752
01:39:28,771 --> 01:39:33,771
I always look at his picture and wonder 
what he would look like without that 

1753
01:39:33,771 --> 01:39:35,910
Victorian era,
waxed mustache thing he has going.

1754
01:39:35,911 --> 01:39:36,560
But.
But he's a.

1755
01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:40,290
he's a fantastic figure,
a character in his own right.

1756
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:42,540
But he famously tells the British 
commander,

1757
01:39:42,541 --> 01:39:44,940
who's going over to friend's something 
to the effect of,

1758
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:47,190
look,
this 70,000

1759
01:39:47,191 --> 01:39:51,780
men is 90 percent of all.
We have France and Germany.

1760
01:39:51,781 --> 01:39:53,760
They got millions of men in the field.

1761
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:56,490
This is our army.
Don't lose it.

1762
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,010
In other words,
be careful.

1763
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:04,640
The problem is he's in a war where men 
are thrown into meat grinders in very 

1764
01:40:04,861 --> 01:40:09,861
large numbers.
The French will lose the equivalent of 

1765
01:40:09,861 --> 01:40:13,440
the British expeditionary force often in
this war in a short period of time.

1766
01:40:13,441 --> 01:40:18,441
So will the chairman's,
so the British are moving up into 

1767
01:40:18,441 --> 01:40:19,860
Belgium to have their first real contact
with modern war.

1768
01:40:19,861 --> 01:40:24,861
They fought in South Africa against a 
bunch of bore farmers and guerrilla 

1769
01:40:25,561 --> 01:40:27,690
fighters got an idea of what,
you know,

1770
01:40:27,691 --> 01:40:29,550
the rifle,
fire and all that stuff could do.

1771
01:40:29,730 --> 01:40:34,730
They haven't moved up against an army 
that can fight like Daikin fight and 

1772
01:40:34,730 --> 01:40:38,301
that outnumbers the many times over.
They stumble into this army at a place 

1773
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:44,060
called the battle.
That shaping up will be a legendary 

1774
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:45,450
British battle.
It's called the battle of moms.

1775
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:51,080
And um,
it will be mythologized in a very 

1776
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:54,340
similar way to the dunkirk affair in the
Second World War.

1777
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:58,180
You know what that was right when 
Germany smashes France in 1940,

1778
01:40:58,450 --> 01:41:00,820
the British managed to evacuate their 
army.

1779
01:41:00,821 --> 01:41:03,610
Miraculously every ship that can float 
comes across in.

1780
01:41:03,611 --> 01:41:05,350
Every little rowboat comes across the 
channel,

1781
01:41:05,351 --> 01:41:08,170
takes British soldiers away and the 
Luftwaffe has held at bay.

1782
01:41:08,171 --> 01:41:10,690
And then they can flip the Germans off 
from across the English Channel.

1783
01:41:10,691 --> 01:41:12,310
Say,
ha ha missed us.

1784
01:41:13,090 --> 01:41:14,590
Technically it's a defeat,
right?

1785
01:41:14,591 --> 01:41:19,591
But you sort of a it and spin it in a 
way that makes it look like a glorious 

1786
01:41:19,591 --> 01:41:20,640
victory that ends up biting,
you know,

1787
01:41:20,650 --> 01:41:22,150
the enemy in the rear end,
in the long run.

1788
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:23,500
There is some truth to that,
right?

1789
01:41:23,501 --> 01:41:25,630
You can,
you can work with that as the publicists

1790
01:41:25,631 --> 01:41:28,660
say,
the battle of Mons is very similar.

1791
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:31,690
One of those things that's technically 
no matter how you look at it,

1792
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:37,020
a defeat.
But there are heroic narratives that 

1793
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:37,840
sort of come out of it.

1794
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:43,140
To me,
it's like the moment where the cloaking 

1795
01:41:43,140 --> 01:41:45,541
device is removed from the German 
flanking attack because up till now 

1796
01:41:45,541 --> 01:41:49,831
there's been this uncertainty about is 
it coming in and what strength is it 

1797
01:41:49,831 --> 01:41:53,641
coming in and how many men are we 
talking about here in where exactly is 

1798
01:41:53,641 --> 01:41:53,641
it going?
All these different kinds of things that

1799
01:41:53,641 --> 01:41:58,411
British run in to the tip of the spear.
They run into the most honored,

1800
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:03,880
um,
of the armies that are involved in this 

1801
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:03,880
attack.
The one that has the,

1802
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:05,860
the important,
most important position.

1803
01:42:05,861 --> 01:42:10,861
The one that the great schlieffen 
famously said that these guys should 

1804
01:42:10,861 --> 01:42:12,520
brush their sleeves against the English 
channel,

1805
01:42:12,521 --> 01:42:17,521
meaning that that's how wide a flanking 
maneuver they should make through 

1806
01:42:17,521 --> 01:42:20,971
Belgium.
They should make it so wide that they 

1807
01:42:20,971 --> 01:42:20,971
actually almost touched the last man on 
the right,

1808
01:42:20,971 --> 01:42:25,230
touches a sleeve into the water and it's
commanded by one of these great German 

1809
01:42:26,111 --> 01:42:31,111
generals.
A guy named Alexander von and 

1810
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:36,520
[inaudible] is one of these guys that's 
like Hind Scuderi and I think I said in 

1811
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:37,720
the Second World War,
he's an aggressive general.

1812
01:42:37,721 --> 01:42:41,020
He's a hard driver.
He seizes the initiative.

1813
01:42:41,021 --> 01:42:44,500
He gets you off balance.
He keeps pushing and he moves.

1814
01:42:44,501 --> 01:42:49,501
It's all about speed and deadliness when
he gets to the place where you don't 

1815
01:42:49,501 --> 01:42:49,501
expect him yet,

1816
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:55,800
he's commanding 320,000
men in Germany's first army right next 

1817
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:58,420
to him as Germany,
second army also moving through Belgium.

1818
01:42:58,421 --> 01:43:01,750
Also part of this outflanking maneuver 
to 160,000

1819
01:43:01,751 --> 01:43:06,751
men under von Bulow on housing.
Third Army below him as 180,000

1820
01:43:07,991 --> 01:43:09,850
men.
This is the flanking maneuver.

1821
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:14,140
The British run into the German army on 
the farthest right flank.

1822
01:43:14,141 --> 01:43:15,940
They only run into a part of it 
actually,

1823
01:43:15,941 --> 01:43:20,941
but 160,000
men who are surprised to find the 

1824
01:43:20,941 --> 01:43:24,661
British waiting for them behind 
defensive positions along 25 miles of a 

1825
01:43:26,950 --> 01:43:30,850
canal,
which we call a defensive obstacle,

1826
01:43:30,851 --> 01:43:35,851
right?
This is something that magnifies the 

1827
01:43:35,851 --> 01:43:38,611
power of the defense because now the 
Germans have to cross this canal under 

1828
01:43:38,611 --> 01:43:42,331
fire and everything.
Now the British think they're going to 

1829
01:43:42,331 --> 01:43:46,021
face a core of Germans maybe to instead 
they're facing four plus cores and 

1830
01:43:49,391 --> 01:43:52,460
they're doing it in this kind of another
worldly setting.

1831
01:43:52,690 --> 01:43:53,420
Uh,
again,

1832
01:43:53,421 --> 01:43:54,920
Barbara Tuchman's good for this kind of 
stuff.

1833
01:43:54,921 --> 01:43:56,420
And she explains that,
you know,

1834
01:43:56,421 --> 01:44:01,421
you might think that this is like the 
wonderful Belgian farm countryside in 

1835
01:44:01,421 --> 01:44:02,600
the canal with blue water going through 
it.

1836
01:44:02,830 --> 01:44:07,830
But she explains that this is a mining 
town and the water that runs through 

1837
01:44:07,830 --> 01:44:10,970
this canal is more of a sludge and it's 
black and it gives off chemical fumes.

1838
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:16,240
And she said it amongst the flower 
gardens and vegetable gardens are these 

1839
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:19,580
slag heaps that are pointed and looked 
like tall witches hats all around the,

1840
01:44:19,790 --> 01:44:24,790
the landscape,
and she says it doesn't look like a bad 

1841
01:44:24,790 --> 01:44:26,300
place for a modern battle.
It's gone down in history though,

1842
01:44:26,790 --> 01:44:28,100
uh,
with one narrative.

1843
01:44:28,101 --> 01:44:33,101
And then of course,
as in everything else you're going to 

1844
01:44:33,101 --> 01:44:33,101
get tired of me saying this.
But as everything else with this war,

1845
01:44:33,101 --> 01:44:33,710
there's a whole nother counter 
narrative.

1846
01:44:34,010 --> 01:44:36,390
The original narrative is the dunkirk 
one that,

1847
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:41,440
that turns this thing into something 
that is so legendary that within a year 

1848
01:44:42,890 --> 01:44:46,160
or two legends,
popular legends will spring up.

1849
01:44:46,430 --> 01:44:50,720
That there are angels on the British 
side of this battle,

1850
01:44:52,070 --> 01:44:52,730
which,
you know,

1851
01:44:52,970 --> 01:44:57,970
to me,
I wouldn't push that rumor because even 

1852
01:44:57,970 --> 01:44:58,460
though it makes it look like God might 
be on your side if you've got the angels

1853
01:44:58,461 --> 01:45:03,461
on your side and you still end up having
to move backwards in retreat after the 

1854
01:45:03,461 --> 01:45:07,031
battle.
That doesn't speak too well about the 

1855
01:45:07,031 --> 01:45:07,031
fighting power of the particular angels 
involved.

1856
01:45:07,031 --> 01:45:07,760
But let's not go there.
Let's talk about,

1857
01:45:08,140 --> 01:45:13,140
you know,
the parts we can confirm about this 

1858
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:14,120
battle.
It's a 25 mile front that these 70,000

1859
01:45:14,121 --> 01:45:17,210
guys have to hold most of it behind this
canal as we said,

1860
01:45:18,170 --> 01:45:23,170
and it starts with encounters between 
cavalry because remember they're trying 

1861
01:45:23,170 --> 01:45:27,611
to use these aircraft and and,
and the Germans are better than most 

1862
01:45:27,611 --> 01:45:30,880
adults to look at things and see things,
but every time anything's misty or 

1863
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:35,141
foggy,
they can't see anything from these 

1864
01:45:35,141 --> 01:45:35,141
things.

1865
01:45:35,141 --> 01:45:37,870
So it's still cavalry that does this job
and while you're cavalry's out front 

1866
01:45:37,870 --> 01:45:39,410
trying to be the eyes and ears of your 
army,

1867
01:45:39,411 --> 01:45:42,500
the enemy's cavalry is out front being 
the eyes and ears of their army and they

1868
01:45:42,501 --> 01:45:44,990
fight.
This is what you normally have.

1869
01:45:44,991 --> 01:45:48,590
Your reconnaissance forces get into it.
And so the first stuff that goes on here

1870
01:45:48,591 --> 01:45:51,190
is the British eyes and ears and counter
the German eyes and ears.

1871
01:45:51,290 --> 01:45:56,290
There's some cavalry skirmishes and John
Lucy or are Irishman in the BDF talks 

1872
01:45:57,561 --> 01:45:58,280
about this.
He says,

1873
01:45:58,580 --> 01:46:00,170
you know,
we run into are cavalry and there's some

1874
01:46:00,171 --> 01:46:01,180
wounded people,
but they,

1875
01:46:01,350 --> 01:46:06,350
they,
they beat the Germans at a little 

1876
01:46:06,350 --> 01:46:07,901
cavalier engagement.
But the Germans are coming and so the 

1877
01:46:07,901 --> 01:46:10,760
British and his unit all get ready.
The they kind of scratch them out.

1878
01:46:10,761 --> 01:46:13,130
Dig would be too strong of a word 
scratch themselves out,

1879
01:46:13,131 --> 01:46:18,131
a little depression in the soil and they
wait for the Germans to arrive and I 

1880
01:46:18,131 --> 01:46:21,020
should point out something that maybe 
I'm estimating here,

1881
01:46:21,021 --> 01:46:26,021
but I would say between 85 and 90 
percent of all the accounts you read 

1882
01:46:26,030 --> 01:46:31,030
from soldiers going off to war in 1914,
and it doesn't matter which army you 

1883
01:46:31,030 --> 01:46:31,340
choose.

1884
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:36,550
Most of it is overwhelmingly positive in
terms of the emotion that these young 

1885
01:46:37,191 --> 01:46:39,830
men feel going off to war.
Now,

1886
01:46:39,831 --> 01:46:44,831
there were some Russian accounts,
especially when you know people are 

1887
01:46:44,831 --> 01:46:44,831
pulled off of farms and don't want to go
do this,

1888
01:46:44,831 --> 01:46:47,990
but most of the young men going off to 
war here are excited.

1889
01:46:47,991 --> 01:46:52,140
It sounds like an adventure.
Full Romance of war is still in bloom to

1890
01:46:52,141 --> 01:46:53,790
them.
This is excitement.

1891
01:46:53,791 --> 01:46:55,530
Remember,
a lot of these people have pretty dreary

1892
01:46:55,531 --> 01:46:57,380
lives and now all of a sudden they're 
caught up in,

1893
01:46:57,550 --> 01:46:59,790
in,
in world affairs that are huge,

1894
01:46:59,791 --> 01:47:04,791
momentous,
biggest thing that's ever going to 

1895
01:47:04,791 --> 01:47:04,791
happen to most of these people.
Right,

1896
01:47:04,791 --> 01:47:05,220
and they know it and they're,
they're caught up in the excitement that

1897
01:47:05,221 --> 01:47:10,221
they don't have a lot of negative 
stories yet that have filtered into the 

1898
01:47:10,221 --> 01:47:10,221
public realm.
You know,

1899
01:47:10,221 --> 01:47:11,640
explaining what's happened to the guys 
who came before you because there are no

1900
01:47:11,641 --> 01:47:15,000
guys that came before you are Irish,
British,

1901
01:47:15,001 --> 01:47:20,001
Expeditionary Force soldier,
John Lucy is moving up towards malls in 

1902
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:23,730
the period right around August 22nd,
August,

1903
01:47:23,731 --> 01:47:28,710
23rd and says that when he first heard 
the guns,

1904
01:47:29,370 --> 01:47:34,370
it was a queer,
thrilling sort of feeling that it 

1905
01:47:34,370 --> 01:47:38,961
brought on,
but it also worried him but maybe not 

1906
01:47:38,961 --> 01:47:42,591
for the reason we would think of as an 
adventurous young man who finds all 

1907
01:47:42,591 --> 01:47:42,890
this,
you know,

1908
01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:44,100
interesting and exciting.

1909
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:48,690
He had a different reason to be scared.
He writes about his unit as he comes up,

1910
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:52,410
you know,
toward the situation at models like this

1911
01:47:53,610 --> 01:47:58,610
quote,
we swapped news with the nearest men in 

1912
01:47:58,610 --> 01:48:01,671
the ranks and learn that nothing 
exciting had happened to the battalion 

1913
01:48:01,671 --> 01:48:04,611
in our absence,
except that a line of trenches had been 

1914
01:48:04,611 --> 01:48:07,221
dug as a defensive measure about a mile 
behind and then abandoned on the orders 

1915
01:48:07,221 --> 01:48:11,871
of a staff officer who wish the 
battalion to move forward toward the 

1916
01:48:11,871 --> 01:48:13,050
town of Maus now visible through the 
slag,

1917
01:48:13,051 --> 01:48:16,440
heaps of many minds on the right front 
of the marching regimen.

1918
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:21,740
This dirty looking factory town had no 
particular interest just then for us 

1919
01:48:21,740 --> 01:48:24,480
until suddenly above the sound of the 
tread of our marching feet.

1920
01:48:24,660 --> 01:48:27,720
We heard the blooming of field guns,
a queer,

1921
01:48:27,721 --> 01:48:32,721
thrilling,
and menacing sound about which there 

1922
01:48:32,721 --> 01:48:35,331
were many conjectures,
the most popular being that they were 

1923
01:48:35,331 --> 01:48:38,331
French,
70 fives and that they were giving the 

1924
01:48:38,331 --> 01:48:38,331
Germans hell.

1925
01:48:38,331 --> 01:48:40,530
This notion greatly depressed us.
We should really hurry up now.

1926
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:44,310
Otherwise we would miss the battle.
The French would get all the glory while

1927
01:48:44,311 --> 01:48:47,840
we with our capacity for deadly rifle,
fire and dash,

1928
01:48:47,841 --> 01:48:52,841
and the attack would miss that crowning 
moment of victory culminating in a 

1929
01:48:52,841 --> 01:48:53,460
sweeping,
bayonet charge,

1930
01:48:53,580 --> 01:48:58,580
relentless and invincible,
the grand assault that would drive the 

1931
01:48:58,580 --> 01:49:01,260
enemy off the field so we dammed the 
French were not waiting for us.

1932
01:49:02,540 --> 01:49:07,200
And to quote,
there's that romance of war again,

1933
01:49:07,590 --> 01:49:09,600
the great adventure.
It's going to be fun.

1934
01:49:09,930 --> 01:49:13,470
We're going to be heroes.
And it's funny when he first gets to the

1935
01:49:13,471 --> 01:49:18,471
line,
he and his men take up positions and 

1936
01:49:18,471 --> 01:49:21,741
what they call knee trenches.
These shallow little kind of holes and 

1937
01:49:21,741 --> 01:49:23,070
they're not too happy to not be moving 
forward and doing something offensive,

1938
01:49:23,071 --> 01:49:28,071
but,
but they sit down there and then the 

1939
01:49:28,071 --> 01:49:29,631
first shells come by them and again they
find it more interesting and they kind 

1940
01:49:29,731 --> 01:49:30,990
of have fun with it.

1941
01:49:31,530 --> 01:49:32,250
He says,
quote,

1942
01:49:32,790 --> 01:49:37,790
the salvo of shells passed over our 
heads and burst about 80 yards in the 

1943
01:49:37,790 --> 01:49:41,250
rear with a terrific clattering crash.
We were highly interested,

1944
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:46,460
more came and still more all going over 
the heads of our curious men appeared 

1945
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:48,520
above the trenches.
Looking back to see the burst,

1946
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:52,960
look,
they shouted a black one or one only,

1947
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:58,200
or for more whites,
some laughingly imagine themselves on 

1948
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:02,110
duty at rifle ranges at home and shouted
advice to the German gunners,

1949
01:50:02,250 --> 01:50:06,580
wash out another miss and lower your 
sights.

1950
01:50:06,910 --> 01:50:09,880
One wag simulating great terror,
cried,

1951
01:50:09,940 --> 01:50:14,940
send for the police.
There's going to be a row on here and 

1952
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:15,160
another in mock despair.
Oh mother,

1953
01:50:15,161 --> 01:50:19,030
why did I desert you?
Than the enemy gunners shortened and the

1954
01:50:19,031 --> 01:50:24,031
shell is exploded above our trenches and
the men already taken in hand for 

1955
01:50:24,031 --> 01:50:25,780
exposing themselves.
Crouched low.

1956
01:50:26,770 --> 01:50:28,690
So it's getting real,
right?

1957
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:33,430
But it shows you the attitude that they 
had at the time they are having fun with

1958
01:50:33,431 --> 01:50:35,260
it.
It's a great adventure.

1959
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:39,880
And you read accounts from every major 
army of this period.

1960
01:50:39,881 --> 01:50:44,881
As I said,
the Russians have a little bit more 

1961
01:50:44,881 --> 01:50:44,881
people that were sort of dragged into 
this kicking and screaming.

1962
01:50:44,881 --> 01:50:45,090
Um,
and,

1963
01:50:45,091 --> 01:50:47,680
and the country people always more than 
the urban people,

1964
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:51,010
but the 20 year olds who are marching 
off to do this,

1965
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:54,280
it's hard to find accounts where they're
dreading it.

1966
01:50:54,281 --> 01:50:57,010
Yet,
there'll be accounts down the road where

1967
01:50:57,610 --> 01:51:02,610
you know everyone has a good idea where 
they're going and there's a lot more of 

1968
01:51:02,610 --> 01:51:04,420
planning for your own death and worrying
about that kind of stuff.

1969
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:05,620
Right now,
as I said,

1970
01:51:05,621 --> 01:51:08,350
John Lewis,
Lucy's worrying about missing the fun.

1971
01:51:09,550 --> 01:51:11,650
He doesn't have to worry because the 
funds come into him.

1972
01:51:13,470 --> 01:51:17,190
Field Marshal,
Alexander von Cluck is aiming the German

1973
01:51:17,191 --> 01:51:19,710
first army,
the tip of the spear,

1974
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:21,000
right?
Adam

1975
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:26,330
and Alexander von cluck is like the 
German general,

1976
01:51:26,331 --> 01:51:31,331
that central casting in the TV Hollywood
world would've put together scarred 

1977
01:51:31,641 --> 01:51:33,350
face,
you know,

1978
01:51:33,351 --> 01:51:38,351
iron cross carrying a soldier's rifle 
and a pistol at the same time while he's

1979
01:51:38,901 --> 01:51:43,901
walking around.
Fearsome is a great description of him 

1980
01:51:43,901 --> 01:51:45,470
where a French observer,
you know,

1981
01:51:45,471 --> 01:51:48,890
during the early stages of this combat,
you know right around now,

1982
01:51:49,220 --> 01:51:54,220
ends up witnessing the arrival of von 
cluck somewhere and says it reminded 

1983
01:51:54,220 --> 01:51:55,610
them of Attila the Hun.
And he said,

1984
01:51:55,611 --> 01:51:58,730
quote,
an automobile drove up from it,

1985
01:51:58,731 --> 01:52:03,731
descended it,
an officer of arrogant and impressive 

1986
01:52:03,731 --> 01:52:06,341
bearing.
He stopped forward alone while the 

1987
01:52:06,341 --> 01:52:07,040
officers standing in groups in front of 
the villa made way for him.

1988
01:52:07,310 --> 01:52:11,570
He was tall and majestic with a scarred 
clean shaven face,

1989
01:52:11,690 --> 01:52:15,140
hard features in a frightening glance in
his right hand.

1990
01:52:15,141 --> 01:52:19,280
He carried a soldier's rifle and his 
left rested on the butt of a revolver.

1991
01:52:19,430 --> 01:52:24,430
He turned around several times striking 
the ground with the butt end of his 

1992
01:52:24,430 --> 01:52:25,850
rifle and then halted in a theatrical 
pose.

1993
01:52:26,090 --> 01:52:31,090
No one seemed to dare to approach him 
and indeed he wore a terrible air and to

1994
01:52:31,470 --> 01:52:33,770
quote,
and as we said earlier,

1995
01:52:33,771 --> 01:52:38,771
he's like the Hind Scuderi of this war.
He's the hard driving impetuses.

1996
01:52:38,811 --> 01:52:42,290
Everything commanding 320,000
men,

1997
01:52:42,291 --> 01:52:47,291
commander of the first army and he's 
going to have with German generals who 

1998
01:52:47,291 --> 01:52:49,850
are not as aggressive and hard driving 
as he is.

1999
01:52:50,990 --> 01:52:52,490
It's his army.
Well,

2000
01:52:52,580 --> 01:52:57,580
about half of it that will run into the 
British at mom's and the traditional 

2001
01:52:58,281 --> 01:53:02,870
story is that they're in for a shock 
because as we said earlier,

2002
01:53:03,260 --> 01:53:05,810
the British are good rifleman,
but even this,

2003
01:53:05,811 --> 01:53:09,380
just so you know,
even this is contested in a second.

2004
01:53:09,381 --> 01:53:14,381
I'll read some stuff about this same 
battle from the military historian of 

2005
01:53:14,381 --> 01:53:17,800
Britain's imperial war museum who will 
kind of go after every single point 

2006
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:22,331
that's traditional in this narrative,
but traditionally Alexander von 

2007
01:53:22,331 --> 01:53:24,590
[inaudible] forces in sort of an 
encounter battle,

2008
01:53:24,740 --> 01:53:29,740
stumble in to the British lines and take
it on the Chin and are hit by so much 

2009
01:53:30,621 --> 01:53:34,310
rifle fire that is so precisely aimed 
and so quickly,

2010
01:53:34,780 --> 01:53:39,780
you know,
fired that the German supposedly think 

2011
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:39,780
they're under machine gun fire.

2012
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:43,750
John Lucy's very proud of this moment 
and describes what happens to the 

2013
01:53:43,750 --> 01:53:45,560
Germans thusly quote.
Finally,

2014
01:53:45,561 --> 01:53:50,561
the shelling ceased and we put up our 
heads to breathe more freely than we 

2015
01:53:50,561 --> 01:53:52,100
heard.
Conch like sounds strange.

2016
01:53:52,101 --> 01:53:54,530
Bugle calls.
The German infantry,

2017
01:53:54,590 --> 01:53:58,220
which had approached during the shelling
was insight and about to attack us.

2018
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:01,310
Not a shot had been fired from our 
trenches up till now,

2019
01:54:01,430 --> 01:54:05,480
and the only opposition to the Germans 
had been made by our field gun battery,

2020
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:10,600
which was heavily engaged behind us and 
making almost as much clamor as the 

2021
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:11,060
enemy shelling.
To my mind,

2022
01:54:11,061 --> 01:54:16,061
it seemed that the whole battalion must 
have been wiped out by that dreadful 

2023
01:54:16,061 --> 01:54:17,330
reign of shells,
but apparently not an answer.

2024
01:54:17,420 --> 01:54:20,420
He writes to the German bugles are 
trumpets came,

2025
01:54:20,421 --> 01:54:23,510
the cheerful sound of our officers,
whistles and the rifleman.

2026
01:54:23,630 --> 01:54:27,770
Casting aside the amazement of their 
strange trial sprang to action,

2027
01:54:28,550 --> 01:54:33,550
a great roar of musketry rent the air 
varying slightly in intensity from 

2028
01:54:33,550 --> 01:54:37,040
minute to minute as whole company ceased
fire and opened again.

2029
01:54:37,250 --> 01:54:42,250
The satisfactory sharp blasts of the 
directing whistles showed that our 

2030
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:46,211
machinery of defense was working like 
the drill book and that the recent 

2031
01:54:46,211 --> 01:54:48,770
shelling had caused no disorganization.
The clatter of our machine guns added to

2032
01:54:48,771 --> 01:54:50,930
the den for us.
He writes,

2033
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:54,290
the battle took the form of well ordered
rapid rifle,

2034
01:54:54,291 --> 01:54:59,291
fire at close range as the field gray.
Human targets appeared or were struck 

2035
01:54:59,291 --> 01:55:04,181
down the enemy infantry,
advanced according to one of our men in 

2036
01:55:04,181 --> 01:55:08,441
columns of masses which withered away 
under the galling fire of the well 

2037
01:55:08,541 --> 01:55:13,541
trained and Cooley lead Irishman,
the leading Germans fired standing from 

2038
01:55:13,541 --> 01:55:15,470
the hip.
Let me interrupt him here.

2039
01:55:15,471 --> 01:55:18,110
Now that's John Wayne style walking 
toward the enemy.

2040
01:55:18,350 --> 01:55:23,350
Shooting from your hip,
so they're coming toward the British 

2041
01:55:23,350 --> 01:55:25,100
trenches doing that.
The leading Germans,

2042
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:28,430
as he said,
fired standing from the hip as they came

2043
01:55:28,431 --> 01:55:29,690
on,
but they're scattered.

2044
01:55:29,691 --> 01:55:31,430
Fire was ineffective and ignored.

2045
01:55:31,580 --> 01:55:34,580
They crumbled up mown down as quickly as
I tell it.

2046
01:55:34,820 --> 01:55:39,820
They're reinforcing waves in sections 
coming on bravely and steadily to fall 

2047
01:55:39,820 --> 01:55:43,560
over as they reached the front line of 
slain and wounded behind the death line,

2048
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:47,460
thicker converging columns were being 
blown about by our field guns.

2049
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:52,320
He then says,
our rapid fire was appalling even to us,

2050
01:55:52,470 --> 01:55:57,470
and the worst marksman could not miss as
he had only to fire into the Brown of 

2051
01:55:57,470 --> 01:56:00,510
the masses of the unfortunate enemy who 
won the fronts of two of our companies.

2052
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:05,660
We're continually and uselessly 
reinforced at the short range of 300 

2053
01:56:05,660 --> 01:56:06,750
yards.
Such tactics amazed us,

2054
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:11,900
and after the first shock of seeing men 
slowly and helplessly falling down as 

2055
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:15,441
they were hit,
gave us a great sense of power and 

2056
01:56:15,441 --> 01:56:15,441
pleasure.
It was also easy.

2057
01:56:16,530 --> 01:56:18,930
He says,
the German attack had to be broken off.

2058
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:23,960
Quote,
the German survivors began to go back 

2059
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:24,900
here and there from align the attack had
been an utter failure.

2060
01:56:25,060 --> 01:56:30,060
Soon all that remained was the long line
of the dead heaped before us motionless 

2061
01:56:30,060 --> 01:56:33,270
except for the limb movements of some of
the wounded and quote

2062
01:56:35,070 --> 01:56:37,050
as a person interested in military 
history,

2063
01:56:37,680 --> 01:56:42,680
this era of the conflict is the one most
interesting to me because you know later

2064
01:56:42,961 --> 01:56:45,540
in the war,
everybody's pretty experienced,

2065
01:56:45,780 --> 01:56:47,130
you know,
with what you're dealing with.

2066
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:52,400
It's at this point in the war that 
everybody's learning the reality of 

2067
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:54,570
modern warfare at the same time,
through bloody hard experience.

2068
01:56:54,571 --> 01:56:59,571
The British expeditionary force and von 
[inaudible] First Army are both kind of 

2069
01:56:59,571 --> 01:57:02,670
getting a real initial taste of what the
new weaponry can do.

2070
01:57:02,671 --> 01:57:06,690
And as you heard from John Lucy,
the Irish rifleman in the BDF,

2071
01:57:06,990 --> 01:57:11,990
he and his compatriots were actually 
appalled at how effective and deadly it 

2072
01:57:11,990 --> 01:57:11,990
was.
It's a whole different thing,

2073
01:57:12,330 --> 01:57:17,330
you know,
firing it live people than a parade 

2074
01:57:17,330 --> 01:57:18,150
ground,
but if you happen to emerge unscathed,

2075
01:57:18,510 --> 01:57:23,070
it almost seems to bolster that idea 
that this is fun,

2076
01:57:23,071 --> 01:57:24,240
heroic,
romantic.

2077
01:57:24,660 --> 01:57:29,660
I'm Lynn Mcdonald in her book,
1914 quotes a bunch of people who were 

2078
01:57:29,660 --> 01:57:30,090
there,
including Lieutenant Chapman,

2079
01:57:30,330 --> 01:57:33,390
who as the British are dealing with the 
battle,

2080
01:57:33,391 --> 01:57:38,391
tells what's going on to a compatriot of
his and says about the repulsing of the 

2081
01:57:38,971 --> 01:57:40,530
German human wave attacks.

2082
01:57:40,530 --> 01:57:45,530
Quote.
They came at us over a bank directly in 

2083
01:57:45,530 --> 01:57:45,810
front of us and as soon as they topped 
it,

2084
01:57:45,870 --> 01:57:48,480
we let them have it.
The range was 70 yards,

2085
01:57:48,481 --> 01:57:50,340
so we were firing at them.
Point blank.

2086
01:57:50,550 --> 01:57:52,560
I've never seen anything like it.
Legs,

2087
01:57:52,620 --> 01:57:53,550
arms,
heads.

2088
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:57,150
They were flying all over the place.
We absolutely smashed them.

2089
01:57:57,270 --> 01:58:00,900
They simply melted away.
Then the blighters got some machine guns

2090
01:58:00,901 --> 01:58:03,390
into action and at that distance we were
like sitting ducks.

2091
01:58:03,510 --> 01:58:06,660
So we had to get out of it.
And by Jove it was a close shave.

2092
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:12,240
And to quote as though it's a fun story,
right?

2093
01:58:13,350 --> 01:58:16,560
There was a 16 year old trumpeter and 
that's not unusual.

2094
01:58:16,561 --> 01:58:19,500
Going back a very long time.
They always would have boys,

2095
01:58:19,890 --> 01:58:20,910
um,
you know,

2096
01:58:20,911 --> 01:58:23,400
as drummers and trumpeters and on the 
ships they'll have,

2097
01:58:23,550 --> 01:58:25,110
you know,
they actually have a position in,

2098
01:58:25,180 --> 01:58:28,230
in Britain's navy called first boy,
second boy,

2099
01:58:28,470 --> 01:58:29,610
and they are,
they're kids,

2100
01:58:29,910 --> 01:58:34,910
but a 16 year old British trumpeter at 
Moz describes how he just admired what 

2101
01:58:35,701 --> 01:58:36,510
the British were doing.

2102
01:58:36,510 --> 01:58:37,110
It,
it.

2103
01:58:37,170 --> 01:58:39,930
He never forgot the fire discipline of 
these rifleman.

2104
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:45,260
He says he was sitting,
watching an officer countdown the range 

2105
01:58:45,260 --> 01:58:48,421
of this advancing gray human wave and 
getting very nervous as it got closer 

2106
01:58:48,421 --> 01:58:52,651
and closer and closer.
And he was saying that the British 

2107
01:58:52,651 --> 01:58:56,160
officer was holding the rifle fire until
the Germans got really close and he was 

2108
01:58:56,261 --> 01:59:01,261
counting down the range.
Trumpeter j Dot Naylor from the third 

2109
01:59:01,261 --> 01:59:04,300
division reports quote he was saying at 
400,

2110
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:07,330
at 3:50,
at 300.

2111
01:59:07,660 --> 01:59:10,180
The rifles blazed,
but still the Germans came on.

2112
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:15,300
They were getting nearer and nearer and 
for the first time I began to feel 

2113
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:18,331
rather anxious and frightened.
They weren't an indeterminant mass 

2114
01:59:18,331 --> 01:59:19,000
anymore.
You could actually pick out details,

2115
01:59:19,180 --> 01:59:22,330
see them as individual men coming on and
coming on.

2116
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:26,680
And the officers still cool as anything 
was saying at 2:50,

2117
01:59:27,010 --> 01:59:31,060
at 200,
and then he said 10 rounds rapid and the

2118
01:59:31,061 --> 01:59:34,390
chaps opened up and the Germans just 
fell down like logs.

2119
01:59:34,540 --> 01:59:36,820
I've never seen anything like it.
The discipline,

2120
01:59:36,940 --> 01:59:39,850
the fire discipline of these troops.
I've never forgotten that.

2121
01:59:39,851 --> 01:59:42,130
I was so impressed.
As a boy of 16,

2122
01:59:42,131 --> 01:59:44,080
I was simply astounded.
I thought,

2123
01:59:44,290 --> 01:59:48,070
what a marvelous army we are.
The attack was completely repulsed,

2124
01:59:48,130 --> 01:59:50,620
probably not for long,
but it was long enough for us to get the

2125
01:59:50,621 --> 01:59:53,650
guns away.
It saved us and

2126
01:59:55,590 --> 02:00:00,590
now I probably have more than 20 books 
sitting around me here from historians 

2127
02:00:00,590 --> 02:00:03,740
talking about this same event.
And it is amazing to go from historian,

2128
02:00:03,790 --> 02:00:08,790
historian,
historian and see the different ways 

2129
02:00:08,790 --> 02:00:08,790
this is viewed,
interpreted.

2130
02:00:08,790 --> 02:00:11,460
I'm a perfect example is Peter Hearts a 
wonderful book.

2131
02:00:11,461 --> 02:00:16,461
He's a historian at Britain's imperial 
war museum and he's one of those 

2132
02:00:16,461 --> 02:00:18,090
contrarians who says all this is a bunch
of nonsense

2133
02:00:19,740 --> 02:00:24,740
and let's understand quickly that it's.
It's normal in war time for this to 

2134
02:00:24,740 --> 02:00:29,691
happen.
There's not a single power involved in 

2135
02:00:29,691 --> 02:00:31,440
the conflict that wants to talk about.
Defeats or bad things.

2136
02:00:31,441 --> 02:00:36,441
Everybody wants propaganda victories.
Everybody wants stuff that helps 

2137
02:00:36,441 --> 02:00:39,501
recruiting.
You're looking for stuff that you can 

2138
02:00:39,501 --> 02:00:39,501
play up,
maybe a,

2139
02:00:39,501 --> 02:00:42,570
as Peter Harte suggests,
that's what this miracle at malls is,

2140
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:47,960
but he shoots down a number of the 
typical arguments pointing out that the 

2141
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:50,020
Germans handled themselves very well and
in fact,

2142
02:00:50,021 --> 02:00:55,021
if the casualty numbers or what he 
thinks they are probably deserve a 

2143
02:00:55,021 --> 02:00:55,290
victory at the battle of Mons.
In fact,

2144
02:00:55,291 --> 02:01:00,291
the French and the Germans both thought 
the British were defeated there at the 

2145
02:01:00,291 --> 02:01:00,291
time.
He writes,

2146
02:01:00,291 --> 02:01:04,161
quote,
when Yvonne Glucose First Army smashed 

2147
02:01:04,161 --> 02:01:05,340
into Smith Dorian and second core at 
6:00

2148
02:01:05,340 --> 02:01:10,340
AM on the 23rd of August.
The battle that ensued was to enter 

2149
02:01:10,340 --> 02:01:12,240
British military folklore.
The myth is one of the heroic successful

2150
02:01:12,241 --> 02:01:17,241
defense with well trained British 
Tommy's mowing down hordes of Germans 

2151
02:01:17,241 --> 02:01:19,680
repeatedly attacking in mass formations.
Finally,

2152
02:01:19,681 --> 02:01:23,280
the British would be forced to retreat 
only because the fickle French had given

2153
02:01:23,281 --> 02:01:28,281
way on their right flank.
This view of the battle is a great yarn 

2154
02:01:28,281 --> 02:01:31,790
he writes,
but like the angels have moms at its 

2155
02:01:31,790 --> 02:01:34,641
heart,
it is the product of wishful thinking 

2156
02:01:34,641 --> 02:01:34,641
and quote.

2157
02:01:35,200 --> 02:01:38,320
He then goes on to deal with every 
single reality.

2158
02:01:38,321 --> 02:01:41,900
We've talked in this battle,
shooting down each one of them.

2159
02:01:42,380 --> 02:01:43,790
Again,
as best he can.

2160
02:01:43,791 --> 02:01:48,791
It's controversial,
but he's a fantastic historian who's 

2161
02:01:48,791 --> 02:01:51,881
qualified to do this.
I should like to point out though that 

2162
02:01:51,881 --> 02:01:52,550
this was no different,
you know,

2163
02:01:52,551 --> 02:01:57,500
manufacturing of victory or playing up a
victory and and magnifying the very real

2164
02:01:57,501 --> 02:02:02,501
heroism on both sides.
There's not only nothing wrong with 

2165
02:02:02,501 --> 02:02:05,771
that,
that's pretty standard behavior for 

2166
02:02:05,771 --> 02:02:05,771
every military and every war you can 
think of.

2167
02:02:05,771 --> 02:02:06,140
I mean,
for example,

2168
02:02:06,590 --> 02:02:09,590
he'll say,
I'm quote as to the second core,

2169
02:02:09,591 --> 02:02:13,670
being undefeated and forced to fall back
only to conform with the French on their

2170
02:02:13,671 --> 02:02:15,530
right flank.
This is pure nonsense.

2171
02:02:15,740 --> 02:02:20,740
He says,
the reality is that on many occasions 

2172
02:02:20,740 --> 02:02:23,170
the Germans seemed to have been all too 
successful in forcing a retreat and to 

2173
02:02:23,170 --> 02:02:23,170
quote.

2174
02:02:23,170 --> 02:02:27,550
In other words,
probably the best army in the world is 

2175
02:02:27,550 --> 02:02:29,300
operating that way in the field and it's
disconcerting.

2176
02:02:29,301 --> 02:02:30,920
If you're on the other side,
for example,

2177
02:02:30,921 --> 02:02:31,610
he says,
quote,

2178
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:34,910
it is undeniable that several of the 
British battalions fought well,

2179
02:02:35,060 --> 02:02:40,060
but modern scholarship has revealed that
the Germans maneuvered skillfully to 

2180
02:02:40,060 --> 02:02:43,851
secure a local superiority against the 
weak points in the British defenses 

2181
02:02:43,851 --> 02:02:44,930
wherever possible they operated against 
the flanks,

2182
02:02:45,110 --> 02:02:50,110
forcing the British to fall back or risk
being cutoff and totally destroyed 

2183
02:02:50,110 --> 02:02:52,400
throughout the Germans seemed to have 
handled their artillery and machine guns

2184
02:02:52,401 --> 02:02:55,790
with a great tactical dexterity born of 
long practice,

2185
02:02:55,940 --> 02:03:00,940
operating them in tandem to dominate the
British and the firefight effectively 

2186
02:03:00,940 --> 02:03:02,690
rendering rifle fire of secondary 
importance.

2187
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:06,530
The British were turned out of their 
defensive positions in a matter of a few

2188
02:03:06,530 --> 02:03:09,440
hours and even failed to destroy several
of the canal bridges.

2189
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:11,360
End Quote.

2190
02:03:11,990 --> 02:03:15,680
He then goes on to take issue with the 
casualties that are often cited.

2191
02:03:15,681 --> 02:03:19,280
One of the things that British uses,
claiming that this is a major victories,

2192
02:03:19,490 --> 02:03:23,870
how many more Germans they killed versus
the casualties they suffered themselves.

2193
02:03:23,871 --> 02:03:28,871
He suggests that even the interpretation
of what those casualties are are 

2194
02:03:28,871 --> 02:03:29,480
overblown.
Again,

2195
02:03:29,750 --> 02:03:32,750
this really doesn't matter in the grand 
scheme of things.

2196
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:37,960
Every nation was doing this for me,
what's most interesting is to watch 

2197
02:03:37,960 --> 02:03:42,431
these nations and these militaries try 
to learn on the fly while they're being 

2198
02:03:43,011 --> 02:03:47,870
shot at and translate years of theory 
into practice.

2199
02:03:49,220 --> 02:03:54,220
By the 24th of August,
the French will change their mind about 

2200
02:03:54,220 --> 02:03:54,700
this whole idea of,
you know,

2201
02:03:54,770 --> 02:03:58,400
the offensive at all costs.
When did offer is force to say,

2202
02:03:58,490 --> 02:04:00,620
listen,
we need to go on the defensive a while,

2203
02:04:00,621 --> 02:04:01,220
which is,
you know,

2204
02:04:01,240 --> 02:04:03,700
like heresy a Amir,
you know,

2205
02:04:03,770 --> 02:04:04,460
five,
six,

2206
02:04:04,461 --> 02:04:05,780
seven,
eight days before.

2207
02:04:06,260 --> 02:04:09,230
The reality of the situation on the 
ground is changing.

2208
02:04:09,231 --> 02:04:10,610
Everybody's mind about,
you know,

2209
02:04:10,640 --> 02:04:12,710
those tactics we thought before the war,
we're going to be good.

2210
02:04:12,830 --> 02:04:13,730
Yeah.
In practice,

2211
02:04:13,731 --> 02:04:18,731
not so good the British,
whether you want to believe that they 

2212
02:04:18,731 --> 02:04:22,781
were forced to retire because the French
left them in the lurch or whether you 

2213
02:04:22,781 --> 02:04:26,441
want to believe as a heart does that the
Germans were just really quite good at 

2214
02:04:26,511 --> 02:04:30,370
turning flanks and employing combined 
arms as it's called to,

2215
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:35,520
to,
to get the British in an untenable 

2216
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:35,520
position as it's called.
It doesn't matter.

2217
02:04:35,660 --> 02:04:37,470
The British have to retire,
just the French.

2218
02:04:37,471 --> 02:04:40,320
They have to get out of there.
The first armies,

2219
02:04:40,321 --> 02:04:42,780
um,
leader von Luke writes in his memoirs,

2220
02:04:42,810 --> 02:04:47,810
the British fought excellently,
but that if he had been allowed to sweep

2221
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:53,360
as widely around the flank as he had,
wanted to and has as he requested it at 

2222
02:04:53,360 --> 02:04:57,441
the time,
that the British would have been in no 

2223
02:04:57,441 --> 02:04:59,011
position to fight at all,
he would have outflanked them and 

2224
02:04:59,011 --> 02:04:59,520
smashed them from the rear.
Remember,

2225
02:04:59,521 --> 02:05:01,710
there will be a lot of finger pointing 
after the war,

2226
02:05:02,070 --> 02:05:05,190
over whose fault all of this stuff is,
and a lot of the generals who were still

2227
02:05:05,191 --> 02:05:10,191
alive,
we'll write things to defend their 

2228
02:05:10,191 --> 02:05:10,191
reputation.

2229
02:05:10,191 --> 02:05:13,440
The one thing that you could actively 
say is going on here though,

2230
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:18,800
is that neither the British or the 
French were able to stop this movement 

2231
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:22,611
through Belgium that's coming down on 
them now and they're all retiring at 

2232
02:05:22,611 --> 02:05:25,530
speed and this is the part of this,
you know,

2233
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:29,520
early war narrative that's known as the 
great retreat.

2234
02:05:31,290 --> 02:05:36,290
The great retreat is a wonderful example
of one of those moments where I try to 

2235
02:05:36,661 --> 02:05:38,460
get in the minds of these people and you
know,

2236
02:05:38,461 --> 02:05:43,461
that's a fruitless task.
I mean there's no reason to play with 

2237
02:05:43,461 --> 02:05:44,760
history and study history if you don't 
want to try to do that,

2238
02:05:44,761 --> 02:05:47,190
but we all have to recognize how 
impossible it is,

2239
02:05:47,880 --> 02:05:50,460
but at the same time you try to put 
yourself in their shoes.

2240
02:05:50,820 --> 02:05:55,820
If you are one of the commanders of any 
of these armies and you're over about 

2241
02:05:55,820 --> 02:05:56,820
the age of 58,
59,

2242
02:05:57,210 --> 02:06:00,960
this entire affair is beginning to look 
horribly familiar to you.

2243
02:06:00,961 --> 02:06:03,750
If you're on the German side,
wonderfully familiar to you,

2244
02:06:04,080 --> 02:06:05,550
it looks like 18,
70 18,

2245
02:06:05,590 --> 02:06:08,100
71.
It looks like 44 years ago.

2246
02:06:08,340 --> 02:06:09,660
It looks like,
you know,

2247
02:06:09,661 --> 02:06:14,661
when the Germans managed to surround to 
entire French armies and get them to 

2248
02:06:14,661 --> 02:06:18,891
surrender Sir John French,
the British commander is already making 

2249
02:06:19,601 --> 02:06:24,601
plans to get his army to the other side 
of Paris and then starting to think 

2250
02:06:24,601 --> 02:06:27,310
about the challenges,
the logistical challenges of getting the

2251
02:06:27,311 --> 02:06:32,311
army,
the British army out of France 

2252
02:06:32,311 --> 02:06:32,311
altogether and back to the safety of 
Britain.

2253
02:06:33,060 --> 02:06:37,260
He's worried about a completely 
legitimate threat that the British could

2254
02:06:37,261 --> 02:06:41,850
end up like two French armies ended up 
in the last war completely surrounded by

2255
02:06:41,851 --> 02:06:46,851
the enemy and forced to surrender.
Imagine if 90 percent of Britain's 

2256
02:06:46,851 --> 02:06:51,800
military forces are on the continent and
have to give up to the Germans and go 

2257
02:06:51,800 --> 02:06:53,910
into captivity.
That's quite a hostage situation.

2258
02:06:53,911 --> 02:06:57,180
You have pretty easy to get a pretty 
good.

2259
02:06:57,420 --> 02:07:02,420
Our Miss Disagreement,
wouldn't you think if you're holding 90 

2260
02:07:02,420 --> 02:07:02,420
percent of the British army hostage

2261
02:07:03,950 --> 02:07:06,020
and French.
It's confusing,

2262
02:07:06,021 --> 02:07:07,400
isn't it?
The British commander named French,

2263
02:07:07,401 --> 02:07:09,650
but French is not confident in the 
French.

2264
02:07:10,460 --> 02:07:11,990
He hasn't been impressed,
you know,

2265
02:07:12,020 --> 02:07:17,020
with his dealings with them so far,
and he's complained a lot to his 

2266
02:07:17,020 --> 02:07:18,410
superior who I think we said was the 
military leader in this war.

2267
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:21,790
Lord Horatio's kitchener who happens to 
be a field marshal,

2268
02:07:21,890 --> 02:07:24,410
but in fact at this time he's a cabinet 
member,

2269
02:07:24,411 --> 02:07:29,411
the secretary for war,
but kitchener at times will feel the 

2270
02:07:29,411 --> 02:07:33,011
need to discard his bowler hat and his 
suit and tie and throw on his field 

2271
02:07:33,011 --> 02:07:34,850
marshal's uniform.
Jump on a destroyer,

2272
02:07:34,851 --> 02:07:39,851
go across the English Channel and know,
give French a little piece of his mind,

2273
02:07:39,881 --> 02:07:44,680
bolster his confidence a little bit,
but French has a legitimate worry.

2274
02:07:45,250 --> 02:07:50,250
This great retreat that's going on is an
extremely precarious moment because and 

2275
02:07:50,561 --> 02:07:55,180
organized retirement can easily turn 
into a disorganized,

2276
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:58,930
panicked route and everyone knows that 
in fact,

2277
02:07:59,350 --> 02:08:04,350
only a couple of days after the battle 
of Mons British forces will be required 

2278
02:08:04,350 --> 02:08:07,180
to turn around and beat off German 
attacks against them,

2279
02:08:07,181 --> 02:08:12,181
which is wild when you consider that the
Germans are trying to catch people that 

2280
02:08:12,181 --> 02:08:14,260
move away from them at the same maximum 
speed.

2281
02:08:15,400 --> 02:08:16,990
If you're a military history,
not like I am,

2282
02:08:17,380 --> 02:08:22,380
the one thing that's interesting to 
follow at this point in the war is 

2283
02:08:22,380 --> 02:08:26,221
something that that is very unusual and 
military history because if you were 

2284
02:08:26,221 --> 02:08:27,460
going to take a class on military 
history,

2285
02:08:27,461 --> 02:08:32,461
this is the point in the war where they 
would tell you if you're the Germans 

2286
02:08:32,461 --> 02:08:34,810
that you need to send out your mobile 
units now and destroy the enemy.

2287
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:40,040
That's why you have cavalry right now.
You go talk to a Genghis Khan or at any 

2288
02:08:40,040 --> 02:08:43,480
medieval or ancient general in history,
and they're going to tell you,

2289
02:08:43,690 --> 02:08:47,050
go Ghanim sends your cavalry after them,
harassed them,

2290
02:08:47,051 --> 02:08:49,570
just organize them.
Never give them a moment's peace cutoff.

2291
02:08:49,571 --> 02:08:54,571
Stragglers.
I mean if you look at where people die 

2292
02:08:54,571 --> 02:08:55,990
in premodern warfare,
but even modern warfare,

2293
02:08:56,200 --> 02:09:01,200
they die in the pursuit.
The job of the battle is to get the 

2294
02:09:01,200 --> 02:09:03,130
other side to turn and run,
and when they turn and run,

2295
02:09:03,460 --> 02:09:04,510
you crushed them.

2296
02:09:05,080 --> 02:09:07,060
I mean,
look at the Iraqi highway of death,

2297
02:09:07,061 --> 02:09:12,061
right?
We're so many Iraqis died fleeing 

2298
02:09:12,061 --> 02:09:12,061
Kuwait.
What were they doing?

2299
02:09:12,061 --> 02:09:14,380
They were fleeing throughout most of 
human history.

2300
02:09:14,620 --> 02:09:19,620
The casualty,
I mean Alexander the great supposedly 

2301
02:09:19,620 --> 02:09:21,160
only suffered less than a thousand 
casualties in his entire career,

2302
02:09:21,730 --> 02:09:23,430
although I don't know if I believe that,
but that's.

2303
02:09:23,530 --> 02:09:28,530
That's what some military historian side
and the reason those numbers are so low 

2304
02:09:28,530 --> 02:09:31,741
is because comparatively few people died
in the battles they died while being 

2305
02:09:32,051 --> 02:09:37,051
pursued after the battle,
and since Alexander never lost a battle 

2306
02:09:37,051 --> 02:09:37,210
of his troops,
never had to face that.

2307
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:43,320
This is the moment when the German 
cavalry should be unleashed and finish 

2308
02:09:43,320 --> 02:09:47,411
the job.
The problem is is we had this tiny 

2309
02:09:47,411 --> 02:09:50,371
little window in military history where 
the cavalry is so vulnerable that even 

2310
02:09:50,371 --> 02:09:54,841
disorganized,
which the French and the British aren't 

2311
02:09:54,841 --> 02:09:56,911
by the way,
but even retreating forces can turn 

2312
02:09:56,911 --> 02:09:59,201
around form of firing line really 
quickly and destroy the pursuing 

2313
02:09:59,201 --> 02:10:01,570
cavalry.
Add a few howitzers in there and it will

2314
02:10:01,571 --> 02:10:05,350
be carnage.
Now in the next war,

2315
02:10:05,770 --> 02:10:10,770
mechanized forces,
armor and aircraft will recreate the 

2316
02:10:11,051 --> 02:10:14,440
ability to do what light cavalry did 
before this period.

2317
02:10:14,710 --> 02:10:19,710
But in this weird little interim era,
the cavalry can't pursue and destroy 

2318
02:10:19,710 --> 02:10:24,571
forces like this.
So the Germans have to do this same job 

2319
02:10:24,571 --> 02:10:27,991
with infantry.
The problem is the German infantry 

2320
02:10:27,991 --> 02:10:29,830
maximum speed is the speed of a marching
man,

2321
02:10:30,220 --> 02:10:33,740
which is the exact same speed of the 
people they're trying catch.

2322
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:39,460
And yet nevertheless,
and even though the Germans had marched 

2323
02:10:39,460 --> 02:10:42,521
along way already,
they get darn near to catching them 

2324
02:10:42,521 --> 02:10:42,521
several times.
In fact,

2325
02:10:42,521 --> 02:10:47,081
on the 26th of August,
the British have to turn around and try 

2326
02:10:47,081 --> 02:10:50,660
to get a little breathing space from 
these German pursuers by,

2327
02:10:51,280 --> 02:10:52,310
you know,
fighting them again.

2328
02:10:52,311 --> 02:10:57,311
Can we get them to slow down,
cause them to form up and have to 

2329
02:10:57,311 --> 02:10:57,580
reorganize again and get a little,
you know,

2330
02:10:57,680 --> 02:11:01,430
distance between us and them.
On the 26th of August,

2331
02:11:01,460 --> 02:11:06,460
the British,
including our friend John Lucy from the 

2332
02:11:06,460 --> 02:11:08,440
AEF fight,
another battle with the Germans this 

2333
02:11:08,440 --> 02:11:10,790
time in about 11 hours,
the British suffer 8,000

2334
02:11:10,791 --> 02:11:12,710
casualties.
Now,

2335
02:11:12,711 --> 02:11:17,711
8,000
casualties in the war that's about to 

2336
02:11:17,711 --> 02:11:17,711
happen isn't going to seem like that 
much.

2337
02:11:17,711 --> 02:11:20,570
And my goodness,
the French have suffered 260,000

2338
02:11:20,571 --> 02:11:23,870
wounded in the last few days.
But to the British army,

2339
02:11:23,871 --> 02:11:25,760
which is historically small,
as we said,

2340
02:11:25,761 --> 02:11:27,320
this is a naval powers army.

2341
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:29,840
That's a lot.
In fact,

2342
02:11:29,841 --> 02:11:34,841
when Lieutenant General Sir Archibald 
Murray who is with the general staff 

2343
02:11:34,841 --> 02:11:35,420
behind the lines is informed of the 
8,000

2344
02:11:35,421 --> 02:11:38,420
casualties.
A couple hours later he collapses,

2345
02:11:39,890 --> 02:11:44,890
just faints and collapses.
And what this shows you mean these are 

2346
02:11:44,890 --> 02:11:47,740
hard bitten military men,
but it shows you the stress and the 

2347
02:11:47,740 --> 02:11:49,880
tension that these people are under and 
you add to that the fog of war.

2348
02:11:49,970 --> 02:11:53,270
No one knows what's going on and it's 
happening so quickly.

2349
02:11:53,271 --> 02:11:58,271
There's a huge amount of stress.
A German general shoots himself on 

2350
02:11:58,271 --> 02:12:02,951
August 20th.
I mean all these administers the real 

2351
02:12:02,951 --> 02:12:05,411
supreme test.
It separates the men from the boys as 

2352
02:12:05,411 --> 02:12:07,991
the old saying goes,
this is the moment of greatest danger.

2353
02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:12,100
Winston Churchill who was a high 
official with the Navy,

2354
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:14,860
writes about this period in this 
retirement,

2355
02:12:14,861 --> 02:12:16,030
this great retreat,
and says,

2356
02:12:16,031 --> 02:12:16,390
quote.

2357
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:22,760
Then came the days of retreat.
We saw that the French armies of the 

2358
02:12:22,760 --> 02:12:22,760
right,
we're holding their own,

2359
02:12:22,760 --> 02:12:27,740
but all the center and left was marching
southward toward Paris as fast as 

2360
02:12:27,740 --> 02:12:31,911
possible while our own five divisions 
were for several days plainly in the 

2361
02:12:31,911 --> 02:12:34,980
very jaws of destruction,
he says that the admiralty,

2362
02:12:35,160 --> 02:12:40,160
we received requests to shift the base 
of the whole army from Avera to send 

2363
02:12:40,160 --> 02:12:41,730
those ear,
and with this complicated business,

2364
02:12:41,731 --> 02:12:43,950
we had to cope.
The process of retreat,

2365
02:12:43,951 --> 02:12:48,951
continue day after day.
A seemingly irresistible compulsion was 

2366
02:12:48,951 --> 02:12:51,120
pressing and forcing backwards the brave
armies of France.

2367
02:12:51,450 --> 02:12:54,120
Why should it stop?
Would they ever be able to turn?

2368
02:12:54,420 --> 02:12:58,470
If France could not save herself,
nothing could save her and quote,

2369
02:12:59,310 --> 02:13:04,310
the Germans are coming toward Paris and 
the allied soon to be officially allied 

2370
02:13:04,321 --> 02:13:06,240
armies are moving back in that 
direction.

2371
02:13:06,690 --> 02:13:11,690
Here's the thing though,
remember the war plan and you know that 

2372
02:13:11,690 --> 02:13:14,100
the French military leaders offer has 
not forgotten the plan.

2373
02:13:14,101 --> 02:13:16,350
Even if the Germans get within sight of 
Paris,

2374
02:13:16,760 --> 02:13:20,190
they're going to lose the war.
If at the same time that happens,

2375
02:13:20,490 --> 02:13:25,490
the Russians from the east are marching 
through the streets of the German 

2376
02:13:25,490 --> 02:13:29,391
capital in Berlin has to offer and the 
whole allied higher command realizes 

2377
02:13:30,570 --> 02:13:31,590
that they're on way.

2378
02:13:32,980 --> 02:13:37,980
The war can still be won.
Even with allied forces in the west 

2379
02:13:37,980 --> 02:13:41,821
retreating.
They just have to prolong this conflict 

2380
02:13:41,821 --> 02:13:45,061
long enough to let the Russian smash the
Germans in the east and the war will be 

2381
02:13:45,061 --> 02:13:48,541
over.
No matter how well the Germans in the 

2382
02:13:48,541 --> 02:13:50,971
West are doing,
enter Hindenburg and Ludendorff arriving

2383
02:13:53,200 --> 02:13:58,200
even as all this is going on by train in
the east to take command of that one 

2384
02:13:58,391 --> 02:14:02,770
lone German army that got to hold off 
the Russian steamroller as it approaches

2385
02:14:05,110 --> 02:14:10,110
now,
the Russians biggest victory at this 

2386
02:14:10,110 --> 02:14:10,960
point is the fact that there's an army 
there to fight it all.

2387
02:14:11,470 --> 02:14:16,470
Remember the entire German prewar plans 
assumed a certain speed for everyone's 

2388
02:14:17,531 --> 02:14:21,760
mobilization and the Russians are the 
slow ones and here they are,

2389
02:14:21,761 --> 02:14:22,840
you know,
in two weeks,

2390
02:14:23,170 --> 02:14:25,510
and they're already taking towns in east
Prussia.

2391
02:14:25,750 --> 02:14:26,730
East Prussia,
by the way,

2392
02:14:26,731 --> 02:14:29,980
is this area that was conquered a in the
14th,

2393
02:14:29,981 --> 02:14:32,710
15th century.
By the famous Teutonic Knights,

2394
02:14:33,130 --> 02:14:36,730
which included a large proportion of 
Germanic nobility,

2395
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:40,060
who eventually will settle down in those
areas.

2396
02:14:40,061 --> 02:14:43,620
And so this is where some of the 
historic German nobility,

2397
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:45,940
you know,
has their biggest states and everything.

2398
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,200
The Kaiser himself,
you know,

2399
02:14:47,201 --> 02:14:52,201
this is,
this is historic German territory with 

2400
02:14:52,201 --> 02:14:54,490
an abnormal number of the aristocracy 
there.

2401
02:14:54,491 --> 02:14:59,491
It's an important area and it's a 
gateway to Berlin and it's not far from 

2402
02:14:59,491 --> 02:15:03,160
Berlin and the Russians manage within 
like two weeks of the war.

2403
02:15:03,160 --> 02:15:08,160
Start,
forget the six weeks that guys like 

2404
02:15:08,160 --> 02:15:10,561
Schlieffen accounted on.
Within two weeks they've got half a 

2405
02:15:10,561 --> 02:15:14,410
million men operating in that area and 
they've got even more down south against

2406
02:15:14,411 --> 02:15:16,030
the ostrow Hungarians.
And,

2407
02:15:16,180 --> 02:15:19,120
and it's one of those things where,
I mean there's an author,

2408
02:15:19,121 --> 02:15:24,121
there's a professor named Shawn mcmaken 
who's written a whole book called the 

2409
02:15:24,121 --> 02:15:25,960
Russian origins of the first world war 
where he says,

2410
02:15:25,961 --> 02:15:30,961
the Russians are the ones who should 
bear the entire lion share of the guilt 

2411
02:15:30,961 --> 02:15:31,330
for starting this war.
They wanted it.

2412
02:15:31,331 --> 02:15:36,331
They planned for it.
And part of the reason that they 

2413
02:15:36,331 --> 02:15:38,760
surprised everybody with their quick 
mobilization is because they were ready 

2414
02:15:38,760 --> 02:15:43,261
for this war.
They wanted it and they put up two 

2415
02:15:43,261 --> 02:15:46,141
fifths of their army in Poland,
which is right next to east Prussia 

2416
02:15:46,141 --> 02:15:46,870
ahead of time.
So that when the war starts,

2417
02:15:46,871 --> 02:15:49,450
when they have to mobilize people,
they're not coming from all over Russia.

2418
02:15:49,451 --> 02:15:52,540
There's a ton of them right there and 
good units to.

2419
02:15:53,380 --> 02:15:55,720
It doesn't make any difference.
The Russians are a mess,

2420
02:15:56,530 --> 02:16:01,030
an absolute chaotic disaster.
And you know,

2421
02:16:01,031 --> 02:16:03,520
if you look at Russian history,
Soviet history too,

2422
02:16:03,521 --> 02:16:03,940
I mean,
you know,

2423
02:16:03,950 --> 02:16:08,950
just consider that a,
a piece of Russian history that's so 

2424
02:16:08,950 --> 02:16:08,950
traditional.
It's crazy.

2425
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:13,150
I mean the Russians always start these 
wars as disasters.

2426
02:16:13,660 --> 02:16:18,660
I mean in the Second World War,
they can hardly deal with the fins in 

2427
02:16:18,881 --> 02:16:23,881
Finland,
which is crazy when you think about the 

2428
02:16:23,881 --> 02:16:24,820
disparity in everything from resources 
to size of the numbers of troops,

2429
02:16:24,821 --> 02:16:29,821
everything.
And they can hardly deal with the fins 

2430
02:16:29,821 --> 02:16:30,010
in the very early part of Second World 
War.

2431
02:16:30,670 --> 02:16:33,400
But six years after the second world war
starts,

2432
02:16:33,401 --> 02:16:36,250
they're feeling one of the greatest 
armies in human history,

2433
02:16:36,850 --> 02:16:40,300
very typical for the Russians.
Takes them a long time to get started,

2434
02:16:40,301 --> 02:16:43,090
but they can be extremely formidable 
once they get going.

2435
02:16:43,360 --> 02:16:45,790
Hindenburg and Ludendorff aren't going 
to let them get going.

2436
02:16:47,320 --> 02:16:49,720
When Hindenburg and ludendorff arrive in
the east.

2437
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:53,350
Remember,
these guys are probably a little.

2438
02:16:53,710 --> 02:16:55,990
What would you call jet lagged.
Train lagged.

2439
02:16:55,991 --> 02:17:00,991
I mean Hindenburg is 66 or something and
just out of retirement a couple of days.

2440
02:17:02,590 --> 02:17:07,590
Ludendorff has been on the western front
since about the start of the war room 

2441
02:17:07,590 --> 02:17:12,320
where he banging on the door of Leah and
accepting the surrender there a couple 

2442
02:17:12,760 --> 02:17:17,760
of days ago.
He's helping push land resnick's army 

2443
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:21,661
back on the western front and now here 
he is in the east trying to get 

2444
02:17:21,661 --> 02:17:23,170
acclimated to what's going on.
There's a lieutenant colonel,

2445
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:28,200
which is a pretty low rank for a guy to 
make the history books like Max Hoffman 

2446
02:17:28,200 --> 02:17:32,251
did on the scene though,
who's an expert on the Russian army and 

2447
02:17:32,251 --> 02:17:37,141
of course has been there the whole time.
So quickly fills ludendorff and 

2448
02:17:37,141 --> 02:17:38,080
Hindenburg in on the situation,
which is this,

2449
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:42,460
there's about a half million Russians 
nearby and about 175,000

2450
02:17:42,461 --> 02:17:43,540
Germans to deal with them.

2451
02:17:43,750 --> 02:17:46,030
The Russians are divided into two 
armies,

2452
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:51,240
the first and the second army,
and they're making their way across a 

2453
02:17:51,240 --> 02:17:55,501
really difficult piece of terrain.
It's a series of lakes and forests and 

2454
02:17:56,021 --> 02:18:01,021
marshes and rivers that just is going to
make these two armies have a hard time 

2455
02:18:01,961 --> 02:18:03,640
helping each other out.
You know,

2456
02:18:03,720 --> 02:18:06,970
while they're on opposite sides of this 
big terrain feature.

2457
02:18:07,660 --> 02:18:12,660
He also tells him to Bergen Ludendorff 
that they have a pretty good idea about 

2458
02:18:12,660 --> 02:18:17,101
what the Russians are trying to do 
because the Russians had been 

2459
02:18:17,101 --> 02:18:19,570
broadcasting radio messages and 
telegraph messages to each other without

2460
02:18:19,571 --> 02:18:24,571
using any code.
They also find a Russian officers body 

2461
02:18:24,731 --> 02:18:27,400
after they killed him and it has the 
plans on it.

2462
02:18:27,640 --> 02:18:32,640
In fact,
there is so much information that's 

2463
02:18:32,640 --> 02:18:34,480
giving the Russian plans to the Germans 
that they start to wonder whether or not

2464
02:18:34,481 --> 02:18:37,540
it's just a reus.
Maybe the Russians are trying to trap us

2465
02:18:37,541 --> 02:18:41,050
and they're just broadcasting all this 
to fool us because it's so obvious.

2466
02:18:41,050 --> 02:18:42,970
I mean,
who would make these kind of mistakes?

2467
02:18:44,230 --> 02:18:49,230
Well,
it's not the greatest time in Russian 

2468
02:18:49,230 --> 02:18:51,870
military history.
I wrote down a list of 12 mistakes that 

2469
02:18:51,870 --> 02:18:56,011
were made or or areas that the Russians 
were having terrible problems and it's 

2470
02:18:56,011 --> 02:18:59,080
not only understandable because of the 
Russian tradition of starting wars,

2471
02:18:59,081 --> 02:19:02,620
a little chaotically and disorganized,
but also because you know,

2472
02:19:02,621 --> 02:19:06,010
even the really best armies are trying 
to figure out,

2473
02:19:06,250 --> 02:19:08,380
you know,
how to deal with all this new technology

2474
02:19:08,381 --> 02:19:13,381
in 100 years of theory.
Returning into fact the British and the 

2475
02:19:13,381 --> 02:19:14,650
French and the Germans are all dealing 
with this on the western front,

2476
02:19:14,860 --> 02:19:19,860
so it's understandable that an army 
that's I'm really not up to those 

2477
02:19:19,860 --> 02:19:21,760
standards is dealing with it all too.
In fact,

2478
02:19:21,970 --> 02:19:25,780
even though the numbers on paper say 
there's half a million Russians here,

2479
02:19:26,050 --> 02:19:30,590
they've been leaving guns and soldiers 
all along the way to get here.

2480
02:19:30,730 --> 02:19:35,730
I mean there are actual strength when 
they get to combat is going to be a lot 

2481
02:19:35,730 --> 02:19:38,651
less than it looks like.
The logistics and supply situation is 

2482
02:19:38,661 --> 02:19:41,360
disastrous.
The troops in some cases aren't eating.

2483
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:44,180
They have rags instead of shoes on their
feet.

2484
02:19:44,181 --> 02:19:47,930
Some don't have rifles.
The two commanders,

2485
02:19:48,410 --> 02:19:53,410
a guy named Brendan,
Brendan comp will command the first 

2486
02:19:53,410 --> 02:19:55,961
army.
I'm the second arm is a guy named 

2487
02:19:55,961 --> 02:19:55,961
Samson.
I'll they hate each other,

2488
02:19:55,961 --> 02:20:00,700
which is going to be a problem because 
the plans that the Germans had become 

2489
02:20:00,700 --> 02:20:05,081
aware of through all these different 
methods say that the Russians are going 

2490
02:20:05,081 --> 02:20:08,621
to try a pincer movement on them.
There's only one German army in the 

2491
02:20:08,621 --> 02:20:11,471
region,
so this first army will come from the 

2492
02:20:11,471 --> 02:20:13,991
north.
The second army will come from the 

2493
02:20:13,991 --> 02:20:15,701
south,
surround this German army and destroy 

2494
02:20:15,701 --> 02:20:17,921
it,
but at the commander's hate each other 

2495
02:20:17,921 --> 02:20:20,680
and the communications is awful and they
have to pass this terrain feature for 50

2496
02:20:22,341 --> 02:20:24,800
or 60 miles that will keep them from 
working together.

2497
02:20:25,130 --> 02:20:26,960
This pincer movement is going to be 
tough.

2498
02:20:28,130 --> 02:20:31,370
The German reconnaissance is so much 
better.

2499
02:20:31,371 --> 02:20:32,990
I mean,
the Russians aren't even using aircraft.

2500
02:20:32,991 --> 02:20:37,550
The Germans have air airplanes and 
Zeplin is up there watching what's going

2501
02:20:37,551 --> 02:20:42,551
on.
The Germans have an advantage with 

2502
02:20:42,551 --> 02:20:45,080
railroads because railroads help armies 
move fast obviously,

2503
02:20:45,081 --> 02:20:47,930
but the problem is is that attacking 
armies,

2504
02:20:47,931 --> 02:20:52,931
once they leave their railroads almost 
never get the ability to use the 

2505
02:20:52,931 --> 02:20:54,980
railroads in the territory they are 
going through.

2506
02:20:55,160 --> 02:20:58,100
Whereas the defenders in their own 
territory can.

2507
02:20:58,101 --> 02:21:03,101
This is one of those things that makes 
the defensive more powerful than the 

2508
02:21:03,101 --> 02:21:03,101
offensive.
In this war.

2509
02:21:03,101 --> 02:21:07,280
The Germans are able to use railroads to
reinforce points where they need to be.

2510
02:21:07,281 --> 02:21:10,100
The Russians are past their railroads 
now they're walking.

2511
02:21:11,840 --> 02:21:14,660
Finally,
the Germans know this country.

2512
02:21:14,661 --> 02:21:16,790
They know the terrain and they know the 
geography.

2513
02:21:16,791 --> 02:21:21,791
This is an area where sometimes the 
German army conducts peacetime 

2514
02:21:21,791 --> 02:21:25,151
maneuvers,
so they set a trap for the Russians and 

2515
02:21:25,151 --> 02:21:26,120
it's a very napoleonic strategy.

2516
02:21:26,120 --> 02:21:31,120
Indeed,
they're going to attack these armies 

2517
02:21:31,120 --> 02:21:34,570
while these armies are separated by this
terrain and unable to help each other 

2518
02:21:34,730 --> 02:21:39,730
and smash them individually.
They're going to nullify that 

2519
02:21:39,730 --> 02:21:42,530
disadvantage and numbers and the 
Russians,

2520
02:21:42,970 --> 02:21:47,970
you know,
make this a lot easier because they 

2521
02:21:47,970 --> 02:21:49,481
don't know what's going on.
They literally are clueless as to what 

2522
02:21:49,481 --> 02:21:51,500
they're facing and the high command 
isn't helping the situation.

2523
02:21:51,501 --> 02:21:53,720
They're telling General Samson off at 
the second army,

2524
02:21:54,070 --> 02:21:55,850
listen to.
We don't see any German forces.

2525
02:21:55,851 --> 02:22:00,851
We don't expect an attack.
I mean Samson was taking his time blind 

2526
02:22:00,851 --> 02:22:04,040
to what's going on around him.
Whereas the Germans are moving very fast

2527
02:22:04,041 --> 02:22:08,000
and seizing areas to the flank and 
taking up positions and setting a trap.

2528
02:22:09,110 --> 02:22:11,240
This historians,
Michael Nyberg and David Jordan,

2529
02:22:11,830 --> 02:22:16,830
you know,
pick up the narrative about springing 

2530
02:22:16,830 --> 02:22:18,110
the trap on the Russian Second Army.
They write,

2531
02:22:18,170 --> 02:22:19,420
quote,
nervous,

2532
02:22:19,421 --> 02:22:24,421
intense hours,
followed as the rest of the trap was 

2533
02:22:24,421 --> 02:22:26,891
sprung.
By the morning hours of the 28th of 

2534
02:22:26,891 --> 02:22:26,891
August.
The Germans had control

2535
02:22:26,891 --> 02:22:28,680
of almost all the main roads leading to 
Samson offs.

2536
02:22:28,681 --> 02:22:33,681
Forces combat began in the north when a 
Russian core advancing without support 

2537
02:22:34,140 --> 02:22:39,140
ran into a German core.
The Germans who were fully aware of the 

2538
02:22:39,140 --> 02:22:39,960
Russian presence and we're lying in,
wait for them,

2539
02:22:40,050 --> 02:22:42,900
smashed the Russians,
and sent them reeling back in,

2540
02:22:42,901 --> 02:22:47,901
panic,
surprised at the unanticipated presence 

2541
02:22:47,901 --> 02:22:50,901
of German forces in the area.
Samson off ordered a general withdrawal 

2542
02:22:50,901 --> 02:22:54,891
that night.
The full severity of the situation came 

2543
02:22:54,891 --> 02:22:56,220
slowly to him as he realized that he was
completely cut off.

2544
02:22:56,490 --> 02:23:00,900
His men began to panic throwing down 
weapons and running east as fast as they

2545
02:23:00,901 --> 02:23:05,901
could,
only to end up trapped by strong German 

2546
02:23:05,901 --> 02:23:06,390
forces already sitting on their lines of
retreat.

2547
02:23:06,840 --> 02:23:11,840
Confusion and panic reigned in the 
Russian lines without supplies and 

2548
02:23:11,840 --> 02:23:14,880
without communications.
Panic spread quickly run in comms.

2549
02:23:14,881 --> 02:23:19,881
Forces were more than 70 miles away and 
would obviously not provide any help at 

2550
02:23:19,881 --> 02:23:19,881
all.

2551
02:23:19,881 --> 02:23:23,340
On the 29th of August,
Samson off himself gave into the panic.

2552
02:23:23,460 --> 02:23:26,520
He told a staff officer,
this is our trusted me.

2553
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:28,950
How can I face him?
After such a disaster,

2554
02:23:29,160 --> 02:23:34,160
he then headed off into the woods where 
he committed suicide rather than face 

2555
02:23:34,160 --> 02:23:36,000
capture by the Germans.
He was one of the lucky ones.

2556
02:23:36,240 --> 02:23:41,240
Samsonov powerful army of 150,000
men had suffered one of the most 

2557
02:23:41,240 --> 02:23:44,430
lopsided defeats in military history,
more than 30,000

2558
02:23:44,431 --> 02:23:48,690
Russians were killed and almost 100,000
injured prisoner of war camps where they

2559
02:23:48,691 --> 02:23:52,860
faced a dismal future of forced labor 
and appallingly bad conditions.

2560
02:23:53,100 --> 02:23:58,100
The German's needed 60 trains to move 
all of the Russian equipment they 

2561
02:23:58,100 --> 02:24:00,270
captured.
German casualties were less than 20,000

2562
02:24:01,080 --> 02:24:06,080
and quote,
the Germans had this fantasy of maybe 

2563
02:24:06,080 --> 02:24:10,530
emulating the famous battle of Kony 
Hannibal's victory of total encirclement

2564
02:24:10,531 --> 02:24:15,531
over the Romans and the ancient world,
but instead they got that in the east 

2565
02:24:15,780 --> 02:24:18,420
and right after defeating Samsonov 
second army.

2566
02:24:18,780 --> 02:24:23,780
Those troops that had been taken maybe 
at great cost very soon from the western

2567
02:24:23,881 --> 02:24:26,940
front arrived not in time for the 
initial battle,

2568
02:24:26,941 --> 02:24:29,520
just as lieutenant had told Melissa 
earlier,

2569
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:33,850
but in time to take on the first army of
rent income,

2570
02:24:34,020 --> 02:24:39,020
which the Germans then smash with 
similar nasty casualty numbers.

2571
02:24:39,271 --> 02:24:44,271
Now Renon comp will do a better job of 
pulling his forces back and saving his 

2572
02:24:44,271 --> 02:24:46,890
army from total destruction.
He won't get totally surrounded like the

2573
02:24:46,891 --> 02:24:48,960
battle of [inaudible],
but it doesn't matter.

2574
02:24:48,961 --> 02:24:53,190
The results are the same.
All of a sudden in shocking fashion.

2575
02:24:53,640 --> 02:24:58,640
The Germans have removed the threat of 
the Russians coming in and taking Berlin

2576
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:03,390
before the Germans can take Paris.
All of a sudden,

2577
02:25:03,391 --> 02:25:08,391
the whole strategy that the French and 
British were delaying and operating 

2578
02:25:08,391 --> 02:25:10,020
under the assumption of,
if we can just hold on a little longer,

2579
02:25:10,021 --> 02:25:12,900
the Russians will solve this war problem
for us.

2580
02:25:13,110 --> 02:25:18,110
All of a sudden the French and the 
British are going to have to manage to 

2581
02:25:18,110 --> 02:25:20,970
be victorious on the western front if 
they want to save themselves.

2582
02:25:21,300 --> 02:25:23,040
That helps not coming from the east

2583
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:27,370
in the West.
As the great retreat continues,

2584
02:25:28,140 --> 02:25:31,780
you know,
you begin to see what the level of human

2585
02:25:31,781 --> 02:25:33,520
suffering is going to be in this 
conflict,

2586
02:25:33,521 --> 02:25:35,890
and I have to keep reminding myself 
about this.

2587
02:25:35,891 --> 02:25:38,890
You know the old Joseph Stalin line is 
so true.

2588
02:25:39,250 --> 02:25:42,550
One death is a tragedy,
a million deaths,

2589
02:25:42,730 --> 02:25:47,730
a statistic,
and these numbers that we will 

2590
02:25:47,730 --> 02:25:49,210
constantly throw out in this conflict,
which are enormous numbers.

2591
02:25:49,480 --> 02:25:53,080
They fail to register after a while.
You become numb.

2592
02:25:53,700 --> 02:25:58,570
We take what the last several days on 
the western front have done to France,

2593
02:25:58,571 --> 02:26:00,070
as we said,
75,000

2594
02:26:00,071 --> 02:26:02,350
dead,
more than 250,000

2595
02:26:02,351 --> 02:26:07,351
wounded in a couple of days.
How would our modern medical 

2596
02:26:07,351 --> 02:26:08,560
establishment deal with a crisis like 
that?

2597
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:14,280
You forget what it's like on the ground.
That's why you need these reports that 

2598
02:26:14,280 --> 02:26:17,251
come from people who were there in one 
of the most famous books ever written 

2599
02:26:17,251 --> 02:26:17,370
about the.

2600
02:26:17,460 --> 02:26:19,870
It's called now.
It can be told,

2601
02:26:20,110 --> 02:26:25,110
or British reporter named Philip Gibbs 
went over to the continent right when 

2602
02:26:25,110 --> 02:26:26,650
this whole conflict breaks out and he 
reported from it,

2603
02:26:27,270 --> 02:26:28,570
you know,
during the great retreat.

2604
02:26:28,810 --> 02:26:33,100
Now what he reported that made it into 
the media is not what he put in the book

2605
02:26:33,101 --> 02:26:34,390
because what he put in the book,
he can't.

2606
02:26:34,420 --> 02:26:39,420
He couldn't tell during the war.
This is the kind of nasty stuff that 

2607
02:26:39,420 --> 02:26:44,041
none of the governments would allow to 
be published because it was too raw and 

2608
02:26:44,041 --> 02:26:44,860
too real.
That's why gibbs named his book.

2609
02:26:44,950 --> 02:26:47,290
Now it can be told [inaudible] after the
war,

2610
02:26:47,291 --> 02:26:52,291
he wrote it and he describes the 
conditions during the great retreat and 

2611
02:26:52,291 --> 02:26:53,590
the human suffering,
and he reminds us,

2612
02:26:54,040 --> 02:26:59,040
you know what it means to have that 
level of death and destruction and 

2613
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:01,540
injuries and what kind of injuries we're
talking about.

2614
02:27:01,541 --> 02:27:03,880
Remember,
this is like having what?

2615
02:27:03,970 --> 02:27:08,970
Five,
eight football stadiums worth a people 

2616
02:27:08,970 --> 02:27:12,781
in a few days injured and we're not 
talking about hangnails and sprained 

2617
02:27:12,881 --> 02:27:17,470
ankles here.
Gibbs wrote in August 19,

2618
02:27:17,471 --> 02:27:21,160
14 for publication.
Later,

2619
02:27:21,400 --> 02:27:21,790
quote

2620
02:27:22,630 --> 02:27:26,710
for Emea at night had come,
a French army in retreat there were dead

2621
02:27:26,711 --> 02:27:31,711
and wounded on their wagons.
Queer c stumbled as they lead their 

2622
02:27:31,711 --> 02:27:35,461
tired horses.
Crowds of people with white faces like 

2623
02:27:35,461 --> 02:27:38,350
ghosts in the darkness,
stared at their men retreating like this

2624
02:27:38,351 --> 02:27:41,590
through their city and knew that the 
enemy was close behind.

2625
02:27:41,830 --> 02:27:45,760
No Som pedeu whispered a woman and gave 
a wailing cry.

2626
02:27:46,030 --> 02:27:51,030
People were fighting their way into 
railroad trucks at every station for 

2627
02:27:51,030 --> 02:27:51,700
hundreds of miles across northern 
France.

2628
02:27:51,970 --> 02:27:54,910
Women were beseeching a place for the 
sake of their babies.

2629
02:27:55,090 --> 02:27:58,330
There was no food for them.
On journeys of 19 hours or more,

2630
02:27:58,540 --> 02:28:02,800
they fainted from heat and hunger and 
old woman died and her corpse blocked up

2631
02:28:02,801 --> 02:28:07,801
the lavatory.
At night they slept on the pavement in 

2632
02:28:07,801 --> 02:28:10,891
cities invaded by fugitives at fornay in
Belgium and at Dunkirk on the coast of 

2633
02:28:10,961 --> 02:28:15,961
France.
There were columns of ambulances 

2634
02:28:15,961 --> 02:28:18,270
bringing in an endless tide of wounded.
They were laid out stretcher stretcher 

2635
02:28:18,270 --> 02:28:20,560
in station yards,
500 at a time.

2636
02:28:20,740 --> 02:28:22,490
Some of their faces were masks,

2637
02:28:22,490 --> 02:28:25,670
have clotted blood.
Some of the bodies were horribly torn.

2638
02:28:25,850 --> 02:28:29,660
They breathed with a hard snuffle.
A foul smell came from them.

2639
02:28:29,870 --> 02:28:32,330
That shout tread.
They were swilling over the station hall

2640
02:28:32,331 --> 02:28:37,331
with disinfecting fluid.
After getting through with one day's 

2641
02:28:37,331 --> 02:28:38,000
wounded.
The French doctor in charge had received

2642
02:28:38,001 --> 02:28:42,350
a telegram from the director of medical 
services make ready for 40,000

2643
02:28:42,351 --> 02:28:47,351
wounded.
It was during the first battle of the 

2644
02:28:47,351 --> 02:28:47,600
Marne.
It is impossible set of French doctor.

2645
02:28:48,050 --> 02:28:53,050
Four hundred thousand people were in 
flight for man twerp into which big 

2646
02:28:53,050 --> 02:28:56,651
shells were falling.
As English correspondence flatten 

2647
02:28:56,651 --> 02:28:59,390
themselves against the walls and said 
God in heaven to 150,000

2648
02:28:59,391 --> 02:29:02,180
people coming across the shelf in rowing
boats,

2649
02:29:02,181 --> 02:29:05,690
sailing crafts and rafts invaded one 
village in Holland.

2650
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:08,720
They had no food.
Children were mad with fright.

2651
02:29:08,960 --> 02:29:11,120
Young mothers had no milk in their 
breasts.

2652
02:29:11,240 --> 02:29:16,240
It was cold at night,
and there were only a few canal boats 

2653
02:29:16,240 --> 02:29:16,240
and fisherman's cottages.

2654
02:29:16,240 --> 02:29:20,330
And in them were crowds of fugitives.
The odor of human filth exuded from them

2655
02:29:20,450 --> 02:29:25,450
as I smell it now.
And it sickens me in remembrance and 

2656
02:29:25,450 --> 02:29:29,500
quote.
This is a human tragedy of monumental 

2657
02:29:29,901 --> 02:29:34,901
proportions.
And I have to keep telling myself it's 

2658
02:29:34,901 --> 02:29:35,630
just getting started.
The French have lost in a couple of days

2659
02:29:36,170 --> 02:29:41,170
what the United States,
more than the United States lost in 

2660
02:29:41,170 --> 02:29:43,511
terms of killed and wounded in the 
tenure involvement they had in the 

2661
02:29:43,511 --> 02:29:47,650
Vietnam war in a few days.
That right there should put the lie to 

2662
02:29:47,650 --> 02:29:49,850
the idea that the French are somehow to 
quote,

2663
02:29:49,851 --> 02:29:50,810
um,
you know,

2664
02:29:50,811 --> 02:29:55,811
one American surrender monkeys,
they're not surrendering their standing 

2665
02:29:55,811 --> 02:29:58,160
and dying on French soil.
Um,

2666
02:29:58,520 --> 02:30:03,520
you know,
for the sake of just buying their 

2667
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:03,980
comrades a little extra time,
Francis showing not only that the French

2668
02:30:03,981 --> 02:30:08,981
can take a punch,
which I think everyone at this time 

2669
02:30:08,981 --> 02:30:10,520
period was fully aware of,
but that modern nation states can.

2670
02:30:11,570 --> 02:30:16,570
It's a mixed blessing though in the same
way that boxers say that a clean early 

2671
02:30:17,721 --> 02:30:20,780
quick knockout is more merciful than 
along punishing fight.

2672
02:30:21,080 --> 02:30:26,080
There are historians who say maybe it 
would have been better for European 

2673
02:30:26,080 --> 02:30:27,950
culture,
civilization standards.

2674
02:30:27,960 --> 02:30:29,510
They are golden age,
if you will.

2675
02:30:29,750 --> 02:30:31,490
If the Germans,
he just won this war quickly,

2676
02:30:32,660 --> 02:30:35,540
you would have had sort of a changing of
the guard of the great powers,

2677
02:30:35,780 --> 02:30:38,120
the Germans moving into a more prominent
position.

2678
02:30:38,330 --> 02:30:40,760
Remember there are a new country only 
about 44,

2679
02:30:40,761 --> 02:30:45,761
45 years in existence and they've been 
moving up the power chart ever since 

2680
02:30:46,491 --> 02:30:49,010
with a bullet as they say in radio.
But it works here too.

2681
02:30:49,940 --> 02:30:54,940
Maybe this just seems like a natural 
progression of things and if you could 

2682
02:30:54,940 --> 02:30:58,841
save all the casualties that we know are
coming in a multiyear long carnage fest,

2683
02:30:59,331 --> 02:31:04,331
which we'll get to later and maybe save 
countries from communism and Nazi-ism,

2684
02:31:05,150 --> 02:31:08,000
maybe prevent a second world war and the
Cold War after that.

2685
02:31:08,240 --> 02:31:13,240
I mean the dominoes that fall.
If you talk about this war maybe ending 

2686
02:31:13,240 --> 02:31:14,060
here,
well you can play that game forever,

2687
02:31:14,061 --> 02:31:19,061
can't you?
But you can see knowing how bad it's 

2688
02:31:19,061 --> 02:31:19,890
going to get and how bad it already is.
Why some historians have wondered how

2689
02:31:20,460 --> 02:31:24,780
anything it wouldn't be better than what
they're going to experience.

2690
02:31:25,770 --> 02:31:27,690
If you are French,
you may say to yourself,

2691
02:31:27,691 --> 02:31:29,790
we would never have wanted to live under
the German boot.

2692
02:31:30,020 --> 02:31:32,040
You know,
victory was all important.

2693
02:31:32,840 --> 02:31:37,840
Yeah,
but what if you could have all those 

2694
02:31:37,840 --> 02:31:37,840
freshmen who die in the rest of the 
story back?

2695
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:39,780
What if you can avoid the second world 
war?

2696
02:31:39,781 --> 02:31:41,310
I mean,
when does it become worth it?

2697
02:31:41,850 --> 02:31:43,380
Same thing to the Germans.
I mean,

2698
02:31:43,800 --> 02:31:46,140
you look back and you say,
what if we could have those people,

2699
02:31:46,141 --> 02:31:49,190
but what if we could have that wealth 
back now?

2700
02:31:49,250 --> 02:31:54,250
What if we could have that time where we
were in 1900 back?

2701
02:31:57,610 --> 02:32:00,490
That's called crying over historical 
spilled milk,

2702
02:32:00,491 --> 02:32:05,491
but it doesn't prevent historians from 
doing that all the time and it has even 

2703
02:32:05,491 --> 02:32:09,421
less of a inhibition on people like 
yours truly who aren't historians at 

2704
02:32:09,421 --> 02:32:09,460
all.

2705
02:32:11,010 --> 02:32:16,010
The question of what decision should 
have happened is obviously a 

2706
02:32:16,010 --> 02:32:19,491
historically moot point.
The question of what's going to happen 

2707
02:32:19,491 --> 02:32:23,150
is about to be determined now and one of
the things that sort of makes this 

2708
02:32:23,150 --> 02:32:27,561
battle,
what it is that shaping up if battles 

2709
02:32:27,561 --> 02:32:30,111
even the right word for it,
is that everybody kind of knows it's 

2710
02:32:30,111 --> 02:32:31,920
coming.
It's either coming or the war's over.

2711
02:32:32,130 --> 02:32:37,130
Basically the Germans are moving forward
across almost the entire line and the 

2712
02:32:37,171 --> 02:32:42,171
French and British or moving backwards 
across almost the entire line and at 

2713
02:32:42,171 --> 02:32:44,250
some point they've got to turn around.
They've got to make a stand.

2714
02:32:44,550 --> 02:32:49,550
They've got a punch.
The Germans in the nose or there's 

2715
02:32:49,550 --> 02:32:49,550
nothing that's going to stop them.
And the problem is,

2716
02:32:49,550 --> 02:32:51,510
is that everybody's at the end of their 
rope.

2717
02:32:52,260 --> 02:32:54,720
Everybody has been marching and fighting
for days.

2718
02:32:54,721 --> 02:32:56,850
These units that weren't missing a 
buckle,

2719
02:32:57,270 --> 02:32:59,940
you know,
in parades across Belgium as the Germans

2720
02:32:59,941 --> 02:33:04,941
started this war,
or missing a heck of a lot more than 

2721
02:33:04,941 --> 02:33:04,941
that as are the other allied armies.

2722
02:33:05,190 --> 02:33:10,190
This is why it's so important.
If you can actually get fresh troops 

2723
02:33:10,190 --> 02:33:11,490
into the combat who don't look the way 
you know.

2724
02:33:11,491 --> 02:33:16,491
For example,
these soldiers that had been in contact 

2725
02:33:16,491 --> 02:33:18,831
now for almost two weeks,
look at one point during his 

2726
02:33:18,831 --> 02:33:21,861
inspections,
Jennifer's riding around and he runs 

2727
02:33:21,861 --> 02:33:24,741
into some French soldiers and Barbara 
Tuchman describes the experience quote 

2728
02:33:24,741 --> 02:33:28,940
on this same day,
August 30th is you offer a visited the 

2729
02:33:28,940 --> 02:33:32,181
front of the third and fourth armies to 
look for forces he could assign to 

2730
02:33:32,181 --> 02:33:35,841
Foshe.
Another French general talk man 

2731
02:33:35,841 --> 02:33:37,050
continues on the road.
He passed the retreating columns who had

2732
02:33:37,051 --> 02:33:39,510
fought in the den and on the heights of 
the muse,

2733
02:33:39,780 --> 02:33:42,240
red trousers had faded to the color of 
Pale.

2734
02:33:42,241 --> 02:33:46,620
Brick coats were ragged and torn shoes 
caked with mud.

2735
02:33:46,830 --> 02:33:51,830
I's cavernous in faces dulled by 
exhaustion and dark with many days 

2736
02:33:51,830 --> 02:33:54,750
growth of beard,
20 days campaigning seemed to have age,

2737
02:33:54,751 --> 02:33:59,751
the soldiers,
as many years they walked heavily as if 

2738
02:33:59,751 --> 02:33:59,751
ready to drop it.
Every step,

2739
02:33:59,751 --> 02:34:02,670
emaciated horses with bones sticking out
and with bleeding.

2740
02:34:02,671 --> 02:34:07,140
Harness sores sometimes dropped in the 
shafts were hurriedly unharnessed by the

2741
02:34:07,141 --> 02:34:12,141
artillery men and dragged off to the 
side of the road so as not to obstruct 

2742
02:34:12,141 --> 02:34:15,891
the way guns looked old and blistered 
with barely a few patches of their once 

2743
02:34:15,891 --> 02:34:17,890
new gray paint showing through the mud 
and dirt

2744
02:34:18,970 --> 02:34:22,410
and quote,
our Irish friend from the BDF,

2745
02:34:22,420 --> 02:34:25,480
John Lucy entitles a whole chapter of 
his book,

2746
02:34:25,780 --> 02:34:29,200
sleep marching,
and he talks about how there were people

2747
02:34:29,201 --> 02:34:34,201
that would just stop at the side of the 
road and not care if the Germans were 

2748
02:34:34,201 --> 02:34:35,020
going to capture them.
They wouldn't move for anything.

2749
02:34:35,021 --> 02:34:40,021
Everybody was exhausted and you know,
we had talked about how the Russian 

2750
02:34:40,060 --> 02:34:45,060
supply and logistics and all that was 
falling apart because they weren't one 

2751
02:34:45,060 --> 02:34:48,601
of the best armies out here.
Trying to cope with the new modern 

2752
02:34:48,601 --> 02:34:48,601
realities.
Well,

2753
02:34:48,601 --> 02:34:52,051
the Germans probably are the best army 
trying to cope with the new modern 

2754
02:34:52,051 --> 02:34:53,020
realities and their logistics aren't 
keeping up either.

2755
02:34:53,330 --> 02:34:58,330
I mean,
a perfect example is the number of 

2756
02:34:58,330 --> 02:35:00,031
shells that they're using in the number 
of bullets they're using is so far 

2757
02:35:00,031 --> 02:35:01,840
greater than anything anyone had 
predicted that they're running out.

2758
02:35:02,230 --> 02:35:03,070
They're rationing.

2759
02:35:03,370 --> 02:35:07,030
Some of these generals are are limited 
to a few shells a day for their gun.

2760
02:35:07,031 --> 02:35:11,710
It makes it very difficult to fight the 
battles that you know on paper.

2761
02:35:11,980 --> 02:35:16,980
The German prewar planned had sort of 
depended on this is where the 

2762
02:35:17,201 --> 02:35:19,840
operational plans designed before the 
war,

2763
02:35:19,841 --> 02:35:24,841
whether you want to call them the 
Schlieffen plan or their sleep and 

2764
02:35:24,841 --> 02:35:27,130
multichip plant or just whatever it was 
the German generals thought they were 

2765
02:35:27,130 --> 02:35:28,810
going to do,
doesn't ever take into account enough.

2766
02:35:29,170 --> 02:35:34,170
The human element and the variables.
It's wonderfully planned and you know,

2767
02:35:34,630 --> 02:35:39,630
t's crossed and I's dotted,
but there are things you just can't 

2768
02:35:39,630 --> 02:35:42,841
know.
You can't know how tired people are 

2769
02:35:42,841 --> 02:35:45,631
going to get,
how quickly you can't know how many 

2770
02:35:45,631 --> 02:35:48,151
times they can fight battles before they
can't fight anymore and you can't 

2771
02:35:48,151 --> 02:35:51,661
predict when they're going to be things 
like hold ups in food and supplies.

2772
02:35:53,110 --> 02:35:55,780
The schlieffen plan or whatever you want
to call it,

2773
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:58,690
is falling apart due to the human 
variables.

2774
02:35:58,810 --> 02:36:03,810
The number one human variable is clues 
and von Bulow first and second army 

2775
02:36:03,911 --> 02:36:08,911
troops cannot March 15 or 20 miles a day
every single day while fighting battles 

2776
02:36:11,020 --> 02:36:13,600
and getting far ahead of their supplies 
and not eating.

2777
02:36:13,601 --> 02:36:18,601
I mean they're just,
they're worn down by the time they 

2778
02:36:18,601 --> 02:36:18,601
reached this stage in the war.
These vaunted,

2779
02:36:18,730 --> 02:36:23,730
you know,
tips of the spear are worn down to a 

2780
02:36:23,730 --> 02:36:23,730
dullness.
In fact,

2781
02:36:23,730 --> 02:36:25,960
they're almost down to 50 percent 
strength.

2782
02:36:26,290 --> 02:36:31,290
What's more,
remember they've had units pulled from 

2783
02:36:31,290 --> 02:36:31,290
them,
you know,

2784
02:36:31,290 --> 02:36:34,441
for over the last several weeks.
Multiple took some and put them down 

2785
02:36:34,441 --> 02:36:34,441
south and gave him to Prince Rupert.
He,

2786
02:36:34,441 --> 02:36:36,760
he sent a couple to the east to help 
against the Russians.

2787
02:36:37,030 --> 02:36:40,450
Just when you kind of want some nice 
fresh troops to throw into this thing,

2788
02:36:40,451 --> 02:36:45,451
they aren't there.
The troops you do have though are very 

2789
02:36:45,791 --> 02:36:49,870
excited about the prospect of ending 
this war and capturing Paris.

2790
02:36:51,160 --> 02:36:56,160
A member of staff talks about how 
getting nearby Paris has reenergized 

2791
02:36:58,421 --> 02:37:03,421
exhausted.
Men are soldiers are worn out for four 

2792
02:37:03,421 --> 02:37:07,981
days.
They'd been marching 40 kilometers a 

2793
02:37:07,981 --> 02:37:07,981
day.
The ground is difficult.

2794
02:37:07,981 --> 02:37:11,630
The roads are torn up.
Trees felled the fields pitted by shells

2795
02:37:11,631 --> 02:37:14,800
like strainers.
The soldiers stagger at every step.

2796
02:37:15,110 --> 02:37:16,430
Their faces are plastered

2797
02:37:16,430 --> 02:37:18,830
with dust.
Their uniforms are in rags.

2798
02:37:19,010 --> 02:37:24,010
One might call them living rag bags.
They marched with closed eyes and sing 

2799
02:37:24,010 --> 02:37:26,270
in chorus to keep from falling asleep.
As they march.

2800
02:37:26,540 --> 02:37:31,540
The certainty of victory close at hand 
and have their triumphal entry into 

2801
02:37:31,540 --> 02:37:33,440
Paris sustains them and whips up their 
enthusiasm.

2802
02:37:33,710 --> 02:37:36,680
Without this certainty of victory,
they would fall exhausted.

2803
02:37:36,860 --> 02:37:40,280
They would lie down where they are to 
sleep it last no matter where,

2804
02:37:40,400 --> 02:37:44,810
no matter how and to give their bodies a
drunkenness like that of their souls.

2805
02:37:44,990 --> 02:37:49,990
They drink enormously,
but this drunk and this also helps to 

2806
02:37:49,990 --> 02:37:49,990
keep them up.
Today,

2807
02:37:49,990 --> 02:37:52,190
after an inspection,
the general was furiously angry.

2808
02:37:52,310 --> 02:37:54,680
He wanted to put an end to this 
collective to botch.

2809
02:37:54,860 --> 02:37:57,290
We've just persuaded him not to give 
severe orders.

2810
02:37:57,500 --> 02:38:02,500
It is better not to be too strict 
otherwise the army could not go on at 

2811
02:38:02,500 --> 02:38:03,080
all.
For this abnormal weariness,

2812
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:08,200
abnormal stimulants are needed in Paris.
We shall remedy all this end quote 

2813
02:38:10,580 --> 02:38:15,580
indeed.
When they saw signs saying that Paris 

2814
02:38:15,580 --> 02:38:17,450
was 20 slash 22 slash 23 miles in the 
distance,

2815
02:38:17,750 --> 02:38:22,750
it was as though they've been given a b,
12 shot one German officer on September,

2816
02:38:24,321 --> 02:38:25,220
third road,
quote,

2817
02:38:26,160 --> 02:38:29,640
one of our battalions was marching.
We're really forward all at once.

2818
02:38:29,730 --> 02:38:34,730
While passing a crossroad,
they discovered a sign post on which 

2819
02:38:34,730 --> 02:38:38,520
they read Paris 37 kilometers.
It was the first sign posts that had not

2820
02:38:38,521 --> 02:38:42,330
been erased on seeing it.
The battalion was as though shaken up by

2821
02:38:42,331 --> 02:38:45,090
an electric current.
The word Paris,

2822
02:38:45,120 --> 02:38:47,460
which they have just read,
drives them crazy.

2823
02:38:47,580 --> 02:38:49,800
Some of them embrace the wretched 
signpost.

2824
02:38:49,950 --> 02:38:52,080
Others dance around,
it cries,

2825
02:38:52,140 --> 02:38:55,230
yells of enthusiasm,
accompany these mad actions,

2826
02:38:55,470 --> 02:38:58,290
this sign post.
Is there evidence that we are near Paris

2827
02:38:58,470 --> 02:39:00,840
that without a doubt we shall soon 
really be there.

2828
02:39:01,050 --> 02:39:03,000
This notice board has had a miraculous 
effect.

2829
02:39:03,210 --> 02:39:06,270
Faces light up.
Weariness seems to disappear.

2830
02:39:06,480 --> 02:39:11,480
The march has resumed.
Alert cadenced in spite of the 

2831
02:39:11,480 --> 02:39:13,770
abominable ground in the forest.
Songs burst forth louder.

2832
02:39:14,580 --> 02:39:19,580
End Quote.
One can only imagine the disappointment 

2833
02:39:19,580 --> 02:39:23,700
those soldiers must've felt,
and probably a little bit of 

2834
02:39:23,700 --> 02:39:26,221
bewilderment went on August 30.
First they changed course and instead of

2835
02:39:26,261 --> 02:39:29,860
heading toward Paris,
they make us sort of a left hand turn,

2836
02:39:30,800 --> 02:39:34,400
so then they're going to march by Paris 
and they're gonna see it on there,

2837
02:39:34,401 --> 02:39:39,401
right?
And supposedly according to the 

2838
02:39:39,401 --> 02:39:41,891
accounts,
some of Von cluck soldiers were able to 

2839
02:39:41,891 --> 02:39:41,990
see the Eiffel Tower in the distance.

2840
02:39:42,820 --> 02:39:47,820
Imagine the confusion and disappointment
and there must've been some 

2841
02:39:47,921 --> 02:39:49,420
bewilderment,
like what are we doing?

2842
02:39:49,421 --> 02:39:53,320
There's Paris where we're right there.
Believe me,

2843
02:39:53,321 --> 02:39:56,890
the government in Paris realizes it on 
September second,

2844
02:39:56,920 --> 02:39:58,390
they flee.
They had to Bordeaux,

2845
02:39:58,391 --> 02:40:02,470
which is as far away as you can get from
where the Germans are without,

2846
02:40:03,180 --> 02:40:04,680
you know,
not being in France anymore.

2847
02:40:04,681 --> 02:40:07,110
It's on the Atlantic coast,
basically the Bay of Biscay,

2848
02:40:07,350 --> 02:40:11,400
so they leave a lot of refugees leave 
and the soldiers who think,

2849
02:40:11,401 --> 02:40:16,401
okay,
the city is basically wide open for us 

2850
02:40:16,401 --> 02:40:16,401
and we're heading

2851
02:40:16,401 --> 02:40:16,401
in a different direction.

2852
02:40:17,030 --> 02:40:20,930
This turn by these soldiers in a 
different direction.

2853
02:40:20,990 --> 02:40:25,990
We'll create a million questions and a 
million opportunities and it will make 

2854
02:40:27,171 --> 02:40:31,520
this story almost impossible to 
understand if you're even able to follow

2855
02:40:31,521 --> 02:40:36,521
it to this point.
The battle that is shaping up here is 

2856
02:40:36,521 --> 02:40:37,850
the most complicated I've ever 
encountered.

2857
02:40:39,110 --> 02:40:44,110
It takes forever to really try to 
understand this and then once you think 

2858
02:40:44,110 --> 02:40:48,551
you got it,
you can't figure out how to explain it 

2859
02:40:48,551 --> 02:40:50,441
to anyone.
It doesn't even really meet the 

2860
02:40:50,441 --> 02:40:53,200
definition of battle at all,
but let's understand why it's possible.

2861
02:40:53,570 --> 02:40:58,570
Remember,
we've been comparing this little 

2862
02:40:58,570 --> 02:41:00,161
conflict here to a heavyweight fight and
you know they often have three knocked 

2863
02:41:00,731 --> 02:41:01,880
down rules,
which means you know,

2864
02:41:01,881 --> 02:41:04,310
if you're knocked down three times in 
any one round,

2865
02:41:04,340 --> 02:41:09,340
the fights over the French at this point
have been knocked down twice in the 

2866
02:41:09,340 --> 02:41:13,031
first round.
There's nothing seemingly to keep it 

2867
02:41:13,031 --> 02:41:16,481
from happening again,
except that giant of a man who comes 

2868
02:41:17,241 --> 02:41:18,590
into his own.
Now,

2869
02:41:19,090 --> 02:41:20,460
you know,
the first world war,

2870
02:41:20,461 --> 02:41:23,060
his version of the second world wars,
Churchill,

2871
02:41:23,690 --> 02:41:26,090
but for France,
Joseph,

2872
02:41:26,330 --> 02:41:29,180
Jennifer,
and this is where he makes his name.

2873
02:41:29,181 --> 02:41:32,780
This is his moment in history.
This is his destiny right here.

2874
02:41:32,781 --> 02:41:34,010
You know,
as Churchill had said,

2875
02:41:34,190 --> 02:41:37,370
I felt like I had lived my whole life 
just for this moment.

2876
02:41:38,020 --> 02:41:41,870
Gioffre is exactly what France needs now
and what they missed in 1940.

2877
02:41:42,560 --> 02:41:47,560
This is when he takes charge and 
performs miracles and his one of his 

2878
02:41:47,560 --> 02:41:51,101
generals later said,
I don't know what we would've done 

2879
02:41:51,101 --> 02:41:51,101
without him.

2880
02:41:51,101 --> 02:41:55,400
As we said earlier,
it's possible there are only in this 

2881
02:41:55,400 --> 02:41:57,351
situation because of poor decisions by 
the guy earlier during the blind chess 

2882
02:41:57,351 --> 02:41:58,290
playing side.
Of this thing,

2883
02:41:58,950 --> 02:42:03,950
but now when everyone's panicking and 
the French government is moving as far 

2884
02:42:03,950 --> 02:42:05,610
away as they can and the British 
commander on the scene's pretty sure the

2885
02:42:05,611 --> 02:42:09,540
war's already over and is worried about 
how he gets his army out of here and the

2886
02:42:09,541 --> 02:42:11,890
Kaiser's slapping everybody on the 
backend,

2887
02:42:11,940 --> 02:42:13,800
as Churchill says,
is in a horrible mood.

2888
02:42:13,960 --> 02:42:18,000
I mean everything looks really good for 
the Germans at this point and the French

2889
02:42:18,060 --> 02:42:23,060
could easily lose heart here except 
Jennifer is taking charge and starts by 

2890
02:42:24,661 --> 02:42:29,661
firing generals that aren't within about
a week or 10 days.

2891
02:42:30,830 --> 02:42:35,750
He fires a 140 of them to have five army
commanders,

2892
02:42:36,050 --> 02:42:41,050
nine corps commanders,
38 of 82 divisional generals and he's 

2893
02:42:42,201 --> 02:42:45,830
replacing them with much,
much better people.

2894
02:42:45,831 --> 02:42:46,970
He even said,
you know,

2895
02:42:46,971 --> 02:42:51,971
a lot of these guys were great 
professors and they taught at the 

2896
02:42:51,971 --> 02:42:51,971
academy while,
in other words,

2897
02:42:51,971 --> 02:42:55,691
good peace time generals.
He's replacing them with people who've 

2898
02:42:55,691 --> 02:42:57,590
already demonstrated in this short 
period of time that they can get the job

2899
02:42:57,591 --> 02:42:59,030
done.
They're fighting generals,

2900
02:42:59,031 --> 02:43:00,620
they're names are famous,
they're false.

2901
02:43:00,830 --> 02:43:02,370
They're pitocin there,
golly,

2902
02:43:02,371 --> 02:43:02,810
any,

2903
02:43:04,960 --> 02:43:09,960
and they're going to help him turn the 
tide here as soon as they get some 

2904
02:43:10,391 --> 02:43:13,690
troops to with,
and that's what you offer does next.

2905
02:43:13,960 --> 02:43:18,960
He gets involved in figuring out ways to
get troops to the crucial points in the 

2906
02:43:18,960 --> 02:43:23,701
battle.
He changes his strategy right after the 

2907
02:43:23,701 --> 02:43:23,701
battle of the frontiers,
you know,

2908
02:43:23,701 --> 02:43:26,590
to have all this offensive operations.
He has people sit down,

2909
02:43:27,530 --> 02:43:32,530
you know,
hold off the Germans on the defensive 

2910
02:43:32,530 --> 02:43:35,071
while he figures out a way to get enough
truth to the important place to make 

2911
02:43:35,071 --> 02:43:37,870
things happen.
And during all of this,

2912
02:43:38,380 --> 02:43:43,380
the guy is absolutely freakishly calm,
which is exactly what France needs at 

2913
02:43:46,231 --> 02:43:51,231
this time.
Remember we said the art of generalship 

2914
02:43:51,231 --> 02:43:53,510
is kind of bringing what qualities you 
bring to the table to bear at the right 

2915
02:43:53,510 --> 02:43:58,101
time.
And of course there's a little luck 

2916
02:43:58,101 --> 02:43:58,110
involved in that too,
but this is your first time

2917
02:44:00,390 --> 02:44:04,800
and while all the panic was going on as 
Gj Meyer says,

2918
02:44:05,460 --> 02:44:10,460
Jennifer was imperturbable quote,
but in the midst of it all for remained 

2919
02:44:11,221 --> 02:44:12,960
impassive,
maddeningly,

2920
02:44:12,961 --> 02:44:14,460
silent,
calm.

2921
02:44:14,700 --> 02:44:18,390
No matter how alarming the situation,
how terrible the emergency,

2922
02:44:18,540 --> 02:44:22,230
the tall and road ton to generalists and
Mo never seemed disturbed.

2923
02:44:22,500 --> 02:44:26,130
He became famous for the care he always 
took to have a good lunch,

2924
02:44:26,280 --> 02:44:31,280
followed by a nap in the day with a good
dinner and always get a full night's 

2925
02:44:31,280 --> 02:44:35,541
sleep in bed at nine back to work at 
five even when things seem to be at 

2926
02:44:35,541 --> 02:44:40,221
their worst Meyer rights.
He made his staff understand that under 

2927
02:44:40,221 --> 02:44:42,210
no circumstances was his rest to be 
disturbed,

2928
02:44:42,630 --> 02:44:47,630
but between meal times in bedtimes,
he was steadily on the move using a big 

2929
02:44:47,630 --> 02:44:52,011
touring car driven by a grand prix 
racing champion to make repeated visits 

2930
02:44:52,011 --> 02:44:54,090
to his generals,
especially those on the left,

2931
02:44:54,330 --> 02:44:55,260
meaning the left flank.

2932
02:44:55,950 --> 02:45:00,950
Thus he was able to keep himself in 
touch with events and observe his 

2933
02:45:00,950 --> 02:45:02,820
subordinance inaction and quote and 
fire.

2934
02:45:02,821 --> 02:45:07,821
A lot of them obviously,
but what this is doing is steadily 

2935
02:45:07,821 --> 02:45:09,780
creating better leadership in key 
positions,

2936
02:45:09,900 --> 02:45:12,810
learning from mistakes and taking real 
time knowledge,

2937
02:45:12,811 --> 02:45:16,920
not theory,
and applying it and taking men who could

2938
02:45:16,921 --> 02:45:21,921
inspire troops in hopeless situations.
Of course,

2939
02:45:22,230 --> 02:45:26,670
Jennifer doesn't command all the 
generals in this war on his side.

2940
02:45:27,180 --> 02:45:32,180
He's fighting a coalition battle and 
there's a British army that makes up a 

2941
02:45:32,180 --> 02:45:36,081
part of his battle line that is hesitant
about involving itself in anything 

2942
02:45:37,471 --> 02:45:41,980
involving combat at the moment,
Sir John French,

2943
02:45:41,981 --> 02:45:45,160
the ironically named leader of the 
British Expeditionary Force,

2944
02:45:45,520 --> 02:45:50,520
doesn't trust the French.
He thinks he's already had his flank 

2945
02:45:50,520 --> 02:45:51,460
exposed once and didn't put in great 
danger.

2946
02:45:51,670 --> 02:45:55,360
He doesn't see any evidence that the 
French can be trusted to win this war.

2947
02:45:56,830 --> 02:46:01,830
I mean the Germans have basically thrown
a the Schlieffen plan if there ever was 

2948
02:46:01,830 --> 02:46:06,370
one out the window here and attacked 
along the entire Franco German border,

2949
02:46:06,371 --> 02:46:11,371
which is that area that is so well 
protected by forts that the Germans 

2950
02:46:11,371 --> 02:46:15,710
thought it worth violating Belgium's 
neutrality and bringing the British into

2951
02:46:15,711 --> 02:46:19,850
the war just so they could avoid that 
area and those forts.

2952
02:46:20,210 --> 02:46:22,130
Well now you know,
three weeks into the war,

2953
02:46:22,250 --> 02:46:25,100
they're attacking along that entire 
front and if they break through,

2954
02:46:25,400 --> 02:46:28,160
they will completely surround the French
and destroy their armies.

2955
02:46:29,090 --> 02:46:32,180
The problem is is that those forts were 
originally avoided for a reason.

2956
02:46:32,390 --> 02:46:36,410
They're formidable and all of a sudden 
the French troops in that area are doing

2957
02:46:36,411 --> 02:46:39,800
a pretty decent job on the defensive.
They're still losing lots of people,

2958
02:46:39,801 --> 02:46:44,801
but all of a sudden they get a chance to
find out that this war that we're going 

2959
02:46:44,801 --> 02:46:48,821
to call the first world war is the one 
where the defense has the temporary 

2960
02:46:48,821 --> 02:46:50,900
dominance over the offense and the 
French.

2961
02:46:51,350 --> 02:46:53,270
In the last battle.
Only days ago,

2962
02:46:53,271 --> 02:46:58,271
we're doing band net charges and 
advancing in close order and all those 

2963
02:46:58,271 --> 02:46:59,750
things you're not supposed to do 
standing up during the shrapnel attacks.

2964
02:47:00,140 --> 02:47:05,140
Now they get a chance to be the ones 
behind the machine guns and behind the 

2965
02:47:05,140 --> 02:47:07,400
field guns firing behind them,
into Germans,

2966
02:47:07,401 --> 02:47:12,401
advancing in the open while the French 
gunners dig themselves a little holes 

2967
02:47:12,401 --> 02:47:16,241
that are almost deep enough to be called
trenches already and see what the power 

2968
02:47:16,241 --> 02:47:18,290
of defense means.
You know,

2969
02:47:18,440 --> 02:47:18,920
for them,

2970
02:47:20,550 --> 02:47:22,680
the good news is they don't get over run
by Germans.

2971
02:47:22,681 --> 02:47:25,320
The bad news is it looks like they can 
spare a few troops,

2972
02:47:25,590 --> 02:47:29,130
which is what Jennifer is doing now.
This is where the real miracle comes in.

2973
02:47:29,370 --> 02:47:31,560
The guy can scrounge troops from 
everywhere.

2974
02:47:32,770 --> 02:47:37,770
He pulls them off of the line in all 
these battles near the French fortress 

2975
02:47:37,770 --> 02:47:38,560
line where the French needed every man 
they've gotten.

2976
02:47:38,561 --> 02:47:41,980
Jennifer's taken people anyway.
He needs them elsewhere more.

2977
02:47:42,310 --> 02:47:47,310
He's taking newly returned wounded back.
He's got know colonial troops coming on 

2978
02:47:47,411 --> 02:47:52,411
boats.
He's taking people from the far west of 

2979
02:47:52,411 --> 02:47:54,091
France and he's.
He's using the rail system to get them 

2980
02:47:54,091 --> 02:47:54,940
to an important concentration points 
fast.

2981
02:47:55,750 --> 02:48:00,750
He creates a new army.
He calls the sixth and he puts it over 

2982
02:48:00,750 --> 02:48:04,291
by the,
the flank of the British expeditionary 

2983
02:48:04,291 --> 02:48:04,291
force.
He creates another one called the night.

2984
02:48:04,291 --> 02:48:05,620
He puts it over as a reserve kind of by 
Paris.

2985
02:48:05,920 --> 02:48:08,020
He doesn't want to have an army in 
Paris,

2986
02:48:08,021 --> 02:48:13,021
which is a great fortress actually,
but the government of France makes him 

2987
02:48:13,021 --> 02:48:16,651
have one,
so they put Jennifer's old commander 

2988
02:48:16,651 --> 02:48:19,450
Galliani.
I'm in charge of it and put him in Paris

2989
02:48:19,451 --> 02:48:21,870
and basically everyone thinks he's just 
going to stay there and you know,

2990
02:48:21,880 --> 02:48:23,650
man,
the walls with his men.

2991
02:48:23,650 --> 02:48:27,040
That's the plan anyway.
Theoretically and day after day,

2992
02:48:27,041 --> 02:48:30,420
more French trains are arriving and more
troops are,

2993
02:48:30,880 --> 02:48:33,310
you know,
de training and moving over to the front

2994
02:48:33,311 --> 02:48:34,870
over by Paris,
facing,

2995
02:48:35,290 --> 02:48:37,820
you know,
the projected direction that this sledge

2996
02:48:37,940 --> 02:48:42,940
is gonna fall.
And remember they're losing troops 

2997
02:48:42,940 --> 02:48:43,040
everyday they're down to half their 
original strengthened.

2998
02:48:43,060 --> 02:48:46,990
Here's Shawfer everyday bringing in more
French troops to face it.

2999
02:48:46,991 --> 02:48:50,140
All of a sudden the numerical advantage 
begins to diminish.

3000
02:48:51,100 --> 02:48:55,150
And then on August 31st aircraft,
yes,

3001
02:48:55,810 --> 02:49:00,810
aircraft again starting to make an 
impact already in this early 20th 

3002
02:49:00,810 --> 02:49:03,871
century war aircraft,
notice that the Germans have changed 

3003
02:49:03,871 --> 02:49:07,531
direction.
The same thing we told you that those 

3004
02:49:07,531 --> 02:49:08,010
troops have been bewildered

3005
02:49:08,010 --> 02:49:10,710
by all of a sudden they're not heading 
toward Paris anymore.

3006
02:49:10,711 --> 02:49:13,170
What's going on?
And more importantly,

3007
02:49:13,410 --> 02:49:18,410
when they changed direction,
they present their flanks to the newly 

3008
02:49:19,981 --> 02:49:23,160
created forces,
especially the one in Paris.

3009
02:49:24,690 --> 02:49:27,270
There's a chance for a counter attack 
here,

3010
02:49:27,450 --> 02:49:32,450
a chance to turn around,
you know the entire great retreat and 

3011
02:49:32,450 --> 02:49:36,951
attack Joffrin needs to convince Sir 
John French of the BDF that now's the 

3012
02:49:37,621 --> 02:49:39,450
time,
the opportunities there,

3013
02:49:39,510 --> 02:49:44,510
we need you,
and he gives one of these great 

3014
02:49:44,510 --> 02:49:47,481
speeches.
This is the way he recorded himself and 

3015
02:49:47,481 --> 02:49:50,571
remember Sir John French doesn't speak 
French and Gioffre doesn't speak 

3016
02:49:50,571 --> 02:49:54,030
English,
and the translator is another British,

3017
02:49:54,031 --> 02:49:58,350
generally guy named Wilson who's much 
more diplomatic and likes the French,

3018
02:49:58,351 --> 02:50:03,351
much more than Sir John French does,
and so there's some fun moments there 

3019
02:50:03,351 --> 02:50:08,061
too.
Here's what Jennifer's own account of 

3020
02:50:08,061 --> 02:50:10,941
his encounter with French to try to 
convince them that now is the time to 

3021
02:50:10,941 --> 02:50:10,941
strike.

3022
02:50:10,941 --> 02:50:11,220
This was our opportunity.
It's the last chance.

3023
02:50:11,221 --> 02:50:16,221
All the cards are on the table.
Shows that there was another side to 

3024
02:50:16,221 --> 02:50:20,691
this man.
He wasn't just the impenetrable obelisk 

3025
02:50:20,691 --> 02:50:22,650
where you couldn't figure out what that 
placid look on his face meant.

3026
02:50:22,710 --> 02:50:25,680
Sometimes he could be positively 
Churchillian,

3027
02:50:25,830 --> 02:50:28,380
and this was one of them.
He told French,

3028
02:50:28,440 --> 02:50:32,300
a suspicious and pessimistic French 
quote.

3029
02:50:33,480 --> 02:50:37,020
I put my whole soul into the effort to 
convince the Field Marshal,

3030
02:50:37,230 --> 02:50:42,230
I told him that the decisive moment had 
arrived and that we must not let it 

3031
02:50:42,230 --> 02:50:43,560
escape.
We must go to battle with every man both

3032
02:50:43,561 --> 02:50:46,080
of us had and free from all 
reservations.

3033
02:50:46,380 --> 02:50:49,410
So far as the French army is concerned,
I continued.

3034
02:50:49,590 --> 02:50:51,960
My orders are given and whatever may 
happen,

3035
02:50:52,080 --> 02:50:57,080
I intend to throw my last company into 
the balance to win victory and save 

3036
02:50:57,080 --> 02:50:58,830
France.
It is in her name that I come to ask you

3037
02:50:58,831 --> 02:51:02,700
for British assistance and I urge it 
with all my power I have in me.

3038
02:51:02,910 --> 02:51:06,120
I cannot not believe that the British 
army will refuse to do it.

3039
02:51:06,121 --> 02:51:10,530
Share in the supreme crisis history 
would severely judge your absence.

3040
02:51:10,860 --> 02:51:15,860
Then as I finished,
carried away by my convictions and the 

3041
02:51:15,860 --> 02:51:18,951
gravity of the moment,
I remember bringing down my fist on a 

3042
02:51:18,951 --> 02:51:19,980
table which stood at my elbow and 
crying.

3043
02:51:20,130 --> 02:51:23,460
Ms Dot Marshall,
the honor of England is at stake.

3044
02:51:23,760 --> 02:51:26,880
Up to this point,
French had listened imperturbably to the

3045
02:51:26,881 --> 02:51:28,950
officer who was translating what I'd 
said,

3046
02:51:29,250 --> 02:51:32,640
but now his face suddenly reddened there
ensued a long,

3047
02:51:32,641 --> 02:51:35,400
impressive silence and then with visible
emotion,

3048
02:51:35,401 --> 02:51:40,401
he murmured.
I will do all that I possibly can not 

3049
02:51:40,401 --> 02:51:41,130
understanding English.
I asked Wilson,

3050
02:51:41,131 --> 02:51:42,300
what's her?
John had said,

3051
02:51:42,480 --> 02:51:45,540
he merely replied,
the field marshal says yes.

3052
02:51:46,050 --> 02:51:51,050
I had distinctly felt the emotion which 
seemed to grip the British commander in 

3053
02:51:51,050 --> 02:51:53,190
chief above all,
I had remarked the tone of his voice and

3054
02:51:53,191 --> 02:51:58,191
I felt as did all the witnesses to the 
scene that these simple words were 

3055
02:51:58,191 --> 02:52:01,620
equivalent to an agreement signed and 
sworn to tea,

3056
02:52:01,680 --> 02:52:04,170
which was already prepared,
was then served.

3057
02:52:06,460 --> 02:52:07,690
Barbara Tuchman,
of course,

3058
02:52:07,700 --> 02:52:12,700
related a little bit more dramatically.
She says that a tear welled up in Sir 

3059
02:52:13,181 --> 02:52:16,720
John French's I and it rolled down his 
cheek before.

3060
02:52:16,721 --> 02:52:18,040
He said,
I don't know how to tell him.

3061
02:52:18,041 --> 02:52:23,041
Just tell him.
We'll do everything we can to one of 

3062
02:52:23,041 --> 02:52:25,951
those critical dramatic moments in 
history when you want that you want the 

3063
02:52:25,951 --> 02:52:29,380
guy who would have been the real best 
first house of hardcore history,

3064
02:52:29,381 --> 02:52:33,340
I think if it weren't hg wells,
would have to be Churchill winded and in

3065
02:52:33,341 --> 02:52:36,250
his account of the first world war,
which you know,

3066
02:52:36,251 --> 02:52:38,380
is full of Churchillian bias,
all,

3067
02:52:38,381 --> 02:52:40,030
all the things that you normally get 
with him,

3068
02:52:40,031 --> 02:52:45,031
but what's fun about it is no one 
explains it like he does even with the 

3069
02:52:45,031 --> 02:52:49,171
biases and he was there.
Churchill's histories are always a 

3070
02:52:49,171 --> 02:52:51,100
combination of romance,
um,

3071
02:52:51,220 --> 02:52:55,570
history,
and if he's in them in a personal memoir

3072
02:52:55,571 --> 02:53:00,571
too,
I love the way he sort of explains how 

3073
02:53:00,571 --> 02:53:01,420
many things had to line up.
Right?

3074
02:53:01,600 --> 02:53:03,130
All along,
you know,

3075
02:53:03,131 --> 02:53:08,131
the war for this opportunity to be 
presented to the general in Paris who 

3076
02:53:08,891 --> 02:53:13,891
sees fun,
Cook's First Army turned their flank to 

3077
02:53:13,891 --> 02:53:13,891
him.

3078
02:53:14,980 --> 02:53:16,820
Here's how Churchill puts it,
quote,

3079
02:53:17,410 --> 02:53:22,410
assuredly,
no human brain had conceived the design 

3080
02:53:22,410 --> 02:53:23,710
nor had human hand set the pieces on the
board.

3081
02:53:23,920 --> 02:53:28,360
Several separate and discrepant series 
of events had flowed together first.

3082
02:53:28,540 --> 02:53:32,350
The man Galliani is on the spot fixed in
his fortress.

3083
02:53:32,410 --> 02:53:37,410
He could not move toward the battle,
so the mighty battle has been made to 

3084
02:53:37,410 --> 02:53:37,450
come to him.
Second,

3085
02:53:37,720 --> 02:53:40,960
the weapon has been placed in his hands,
the army of mental re.

3086
02:53:41,140 --> 02:53:44,290
It was given him for one purpose,
the defensive Paris.

3087
02:53:44,500 --> 02:53:47,590
He will use it for another,
a decisive maneuver in the field.

3088
02:53:47,830 --> 02:53:49,840
It was given him against the wishes of 
buffer.

3089
02:53:49,990 --> 02:53:52,570
It will prove the means of gioffre 
salvation.

3090
02:53:52,810 --> 02:53:55,270
Third,
the Opportunity Cook,

3091
02:53:55,330 --> 02:54:00,330
swinging forward in hot pursuit of as he
believed the routed British and 

3092
02:54:00,330 --> 02:54:04,411
demoralized French will present his 
whole right flank and rear as he passes 

3093
02:54:04,411 --> 02:54:06,580
Paris to Galliani and men are in his 
hand.

3094
02:54:07,060 --> 02:54:12,060
Observe,
not one of those factors would have 

3095
02:54:12,060 --> 02:54:12,250
counted without the other two.
All are interdependent.

3096
02:54:12,340 --> 02:54:14,620
All are here and all are here.
Now,

3097
02:54:14,770 --> 02:54:17,290
Galliani realize the position in a 
flash.

3098
02:54:17,470 --> 02:54:19,720
I dare not believe it.
He exclaimed.

3099
02:54:19,810 --> 02:54:22,390
It is too good to be true,
but it is true.

3100
02:54:22,480 --> 02:54:25,900
Churchill writes,
confirmation arrives hour by hour.

3101
02:54:26,020 --> 02:54:29,710
He vibrates within through Z.
Asm and quote,

3102
02:54:31,010 --> 02:54:33,620
this is what sets up the famous battle 
of the Marne.

3103
02:54:35,270 --> 02:54:37,670
The most complicated battle you'll ever 
find,

3104
02:54:39,620 --> 02:54:42,410
the battle of the Marne is so hard to 
understand for a couple of reasons.

3105
02:54:42,680 --> 02:54:47,680
The first one is just like the battle of
the frontiers that just recently 

3106
02:54:47,680 --> 02:54:47,810
happened.
These World War One,

3107
02:54:47,811 --> 02:54:52,811
battles are modern in scale and scope.
They are so much larger and so much 

3108
02:54:53,481 --> 02:54:56,480
longer than battles in the past were,
I mean a hundred years ago,

3109
02:54:56,481 --> 02:55:01,481
Napoleon is being defeated at Waterloo,
a giant battle involving three global 

3110
02:55:01,671 --> 02:55:06,671
powers and you could from one end to the
battlefield to the other in no time.

3111
02:55:07,160 --> 02:55:12,160
You could see one side from the other 
with those little telescopes.

3112
02:55:12,520 --> 02:55:17,520
They would just put two there.
I the battle started in the morning and 

3113
02:55:17,520 --> 02:55:21,260
was over at the end of the day.
I mean that's 100 years ago now.

3114
02:55:21,261 --> 02:55:25,280
The battles last for,
well this one will last for officially a

3115
02:55:25,281 --> 02:55:27,110
week,
but really last longer than that,

3116
02:55:27,650 --> 02:55:31,550
the battlefield is at least 100 miles 
long depending on who you believe or the

3117
02:55:31,551 --> 02:55:32,630
entire front.

3118
02:55:33,080 --> 02:55:34,910
You know,
according to other historians,

3119
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:40,000
you could legitimately have fought at 
the battle of the Marne and not know it.

3120
02:55:41,150 --> 02:55:42,890
Turn to a buddy that fought there with 
you and say,

3121
02:55:42,891 --> 02:55:47,891
now where are we at?
The Marne was fighting officially part 

3122
02:55:47,891 --> 02:55:51,221
of that or not,
because really it's a catchall term for 

3123
02:55:51,221 --> 02:55:55,660
all the fighting that is going on when 
what really the Marne is all about 

3124
02:55:55,660 --> 02:55:59,030
happens,
which is that the great retreat ends and

3125
02:55:59,031 --> 02:56:03,830
the French and British armies turnaround
and launch into contact.

3126
02:56:03,831 --> 02:56:06,410
Again,
not to be fair,

3127
02:56:06,540 --> 02:56:10,850
there are parts of the front that have 
never not been in contact in the south.

3128
02:56:11,060 --> 02:56:13,880
They've been fighting pretty much since 
minute one and it's never stopped.

3129
02:56:13,881 --> 02:56:16,070
That's why he told them that they were 
in the battle of the Marne.

3130
02:56:16,730 --> 02:56:19,640
They might not even understand it 
because they've never not been fighting.

3131
02:56:21,470 --> 02:56:26,470
Historians like Eric Bros suggests that 
the battle of the Marne is everything 

3132
02:56:26,470 --> 02:56:28,100
that was fought in this one area.

3133
02:56:28,730 --> 02:56:33,320
You know from the center of France up.
He describes it this way,

3134
02:56:33,321 --> 02:56:38,321
quote,
what has come to be known as the battle 

3135
02:56:38,321 --> 02:56:40,661
of the Marne should really be thought of
as the battle of France for all 

3136
02:56:40,661 --> 02:56:44,141
together.
50 six allied and 43 and a half German 

3137
02:56:44,141 --> 02:56:47,120
divisions engaged one another in a 
titanic struggle along the line,

3138
02:56:47,121 --> 02:56:52,121
stretching from Paris to the eastern 
frontier and quote in a sense what 

3139
02:56:53,601 --> 02:56:58,601
really happened is the opportunity that 
was presented by an open flank as we 

3140
02:56:59,571 --> 02:57:02,090
said,
fun first army turns,

3141
02:57:02,570 --> 02:57:07,570
shows his flank to Paris.
Paris now has an army that can hit him 

3142
02:57:07,570 --> 02:57:09,020
in the flank and here we're going to 
have a battle,

3143
02:57:09,260 --> 02:57:14,260
but that just becomes the opportunity 
that everybody was waiting for before 

3144
02:57:14,260 --> 02:57:15,560
they turn these armies around.
Anyway,

3145
02:57:15,650 --> 02:57:18,980
this had to happen at some point.
This is Francis last throw.

3146
02:57:19,910 --> 02:57:21,830
Everybody knows that this has to occur.

3147
02:57:22,040 --> 02:57:25,880
The problem is is that the commanders 
who are actually with the troops,

3148
02:57:25,881 --> 02:57:30,881
not these guys,
that the general headquarters and the 

3149
02:57:30,881 --> 02:57:33,251
highest staff officers,
the ones who are marching with the 

3150
02:57:33,251 --> 02:57:35,951
actual soldiers,
are appalled that this is being 

3151
02:57:35,951 --> 02:57:37,600
considered with the exception of a 
couple of notable commanders.

3152
02:57:37,850 --> 02:57:38,780
I mean,
one commander,

3153
02:57:38,781 --> 02:57:43,781
one general supposedly looks like he'd 
been hit in the head with a club when 

3154
02:57:43,781 --> 02:57:44,720
somebody said that they were going over 
to the attack.

3155
02:57:44,990 --> 02:57:49,970
His troops had been retreating for days 
and days and days at an amazing pace.

3156
02:57:49,971 --> 02:57:52,880
They're closer in rags.
They're weapons hardly fire.

3157
02:57:52,881 --> 02:57:57,881
Their shoes are falling off their feet.
They can't stand because they're so 

3158
02:57:57,881 --> 02:57:58,820
sleepy and then you get the word that 
you're going to attack.

3159
02:58:00,350 --> 02:58:02,010
But several these French generals

3160
02:58:02,040 --> 02:58:04,950
that Jennifer has put in,
commander tough,

3161
02:58:05,250 --> 02:58:07,260
hardcore fighting generals.
I mean,

3162
02:58:07,590 --> 02:58:08,950
Ferdinand Farash says,
right.

3163
02:58:09,500 --> 02:58:11,100
You know,
during this encounter,

3164
02:58:11,660 --> 02:58:12,710
quote,
attack,

3165
02:58:12,711 --> 02:58:17,711
whatever happens,
the Germans are at the extreme limit of 

3166
02:58:17,711 --> 02:58:20,651
their efforts.
Victory will come to the side that 

3167
02:58:20,651 --> 02:58:20,651
outlast the other,

3168
02:58:20,651 --> 02:58:24,810
and to quote the French general who 
takes over from land resnick at the 

3169
02:58:24,810 --> 02:58:29,371
fifth army,
when Jennifer fires him famously comes 

3170
02:58:29,371 --> 02:58:30,820
to the phone like one second after he 
takes command.

3171
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:33,370
Here's from a commander in the scene 
that says it's impossible.

3172
02:58:33,371 --> 02:58:35,230
His troops are falling down,
tired.

3173
02:58:35,231 --> 02:58:40,210
They can't march and he says,
March or die and offer issues.

3174
02:58:40,211 --> 02:58:45,211
His famous notice to the army's when he 
tells them that the great attack is 

3175
02:58:45,311 --> 02:58:49,750
beginning and it's a classic stand or 
die exhortation.

3176
02:58:50,830 --> 02:58:53,020
This is France,
leaving it all on the table.

3177
02:58:54,050 --> 02:58:57,520
Jaffra announces the turnaround and the 
attack.

3178
02:58:57,880 --> 02:59:02,260
Really the recommencement of contact 
along the entire battle line,

3179
02:59:02,261 --> 02:59:07,180
and we've seen how deadly on a day to 
day basis contact with the enemy in 20th

3180
02:59:07,181 --> 02:59:10,840
century warfare is he announces it 
thusly quote,

3181
02:59:11,770 --> 02:59:16,770
we are about to engage in a battle on 
which the fate of our country depends 

3182
02:59:16,770 --> 02:59:21,300
and it is important to remind all ranks 
that the moment has passed for looking 

3183
02:59:21,300 --> 02:59:25,681
to the rear.
All our efforts must be directed to 

3184
02:59:25,681 --> 02:59:28,411
attacking and driving back the enemy 
troops that can advance no farther must 

3185
02:59:28,411 --> 02:59:33,120
at any price hold onto the ground.
They've conquered and die on the spot 

3186
02:59:33,120 --> 02:59:35,860
rather than give way under the 
circumstances which face us.

3187
02:59:36,070 --> 02:59:36,950
No active week,

3188
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:42,000
yes can be tolerated and quote when the 
general in charge of Paris Gal Yanni,

3189
02:59:44,410 --> 02:59:47,590
and I think I pronounced his name 
differently every time I've said it,

3190
02:59:48,820 --> 02:59:53,820
but Galliani famously is asked by the 
general of sixth army what their plans 

3191
02:59:54,251 --> 02:59:55,410
are.
If they're overrun,

3192
02:59:55,570 --> 02:59:57,930
you know what a Paris gets over running 
the enemy over runs.

3193
02:59:57,970 --> 02:59:59,550
Where are we going to go and go?
Yeah,

3194
02:59:59,551 --> 03:00:03,400
and he looks at him,
just says nowhere.

3195
03:00:04,770 --> 03:00:05,550
This is it.

3196
03:00:08,020 --> 03:00:11,830
Imperial War Museum,
oral historian Peter Harte describes the

3197
03:00:11,831 --> 03:00:16,831
crux of the battle of the Marne about as
well as anyone can in the short space of

3198
03:00:16,961 --> 03:00:18,550
words.
He says,

3199
03:00:18,551 --> 03:00:18,880
quote,

3200
03:00:19,180 --> 03:00:23,320
what followed was a complex battle that 
defies easy explanation.

3201
03:00:23,560 --> 03:00:28,560
By this time,
the German right wing was actually 

3202
03:00:28,560 --> 03:00:30,601
outnumbered by the French divisions 
rushing up from the south as the German 

3203
03:00:30,601 --> 03:00:33,610
first army tried to turn to face the 
assault from the French sixth army along

3204
03:00:33,611 --> 03:00:38,611
the line of the river ORC,
a huge chasm of some 30 miles opened up 

3205
03:00:38,611 --> 03:00:42,250
between cluck and the second army on his
left flank amidst the chaos,

3206
03:00:42,370 --> 03:00:43,460
the men of the B,
e,

3207
03:00:43,461 --> 03:00:48,250
f having beautifully about turned,
found themselves advancing alongside the

3208
03:00:48,251 --> 03:00:52,840
French fifth army into the gap between 
the German first and second armies.

3209
03:00:53,080 --> 03:00:55,750
There was no great battle,
no huge drama,

3210
03:00:56,020 --> 03:01:00,550
but the penetration between their armies
threatened utter for the Germans

3211
03:01:00,700 --> 03:01:05,700
and on the ninth of September,
von Moltke ordered his right wing to 

3212
03:01:05,700 --> 03:01:06,280
retreat and to quote

3213
03:01:08,060 --> 03:01:11,570
now Peter Hearts,
a great reputable modern historian,

3214
03:01:11,900 --> 03:01:16,900
and that's about as,
as wonderful a passage there as you 

3215
03:01:16,900 --> 03:01:17,480
could ever hope to get from one of those
folks,

3216
03:01:17,481 --> 03:01:20,450
but see if they would jettison some of 
their wonderful history,

3217
03:01:20,451 --> 03:01:23,270
Asante and throw a little juror and 
drama,

3218
03:01:23,590 --> 03:01:28,590
um,
maybe little exaggerations and romance 

3219
03:01:28,590 --> 03:01:31,241
in there.
You could get something like this from 

3220
03:01:31,241 --> 03:01:31,241
Churchill who describes the same thing 
as only he can.

3221
03:01:31,880 --> 03:01:36,880
And he says this about the British army,
along with the fringe advancing into 

3222
03:01:36,880 --> 03:01:41,201
this crucial gap that will change this 
whole conflict and turn the battle of 

3223
03:01:41,201 --> 03:01:42,650
the Marne,
which let's be honest,

3224
03:01:42,800 --> 03:01:47,800
the French are once again taken it on 
the Chin when they're in full contact 

3225
03:01:47,800 --> 03:01:51,071
with the fabulous German army.
This is what we'll decide the occasion 

3226
03:01:51,071 --> 03:01:51,830
though,
and Churchill puts it in Churchill,

3227
03:01:51,831 --> 03:01:52,910
Ian terms,
quote,

3228
03:01:53,240 --> 03:01:57,500
no human genius planned that the British
army should advance into this gap.

3229
03:01:57,710 --> 03:02:02,360
A series of tumultuous events had cast 
them into this position in the line.

3230
03:02:02,540 --> 03:02:07,540
When they advanced,
there was a gap in front of them on the 

3231
03:02:07,540 --> 03:02:10,511
whole front.
It was the line of least resistance 

3232
03:02:10,511 --> 03:02:13,360
along it.
They board and punched and it led into 

3233
03:02:13,360 --> 03:02:14,540
the strategic vitals of the German right
wing.

3234
03:02:14,780 --> 03:02:19,780
Hi Destiny.
Blind fate regulated the nun too 

3235
03:02:19,780 --> 03:02:21,740
vigorous but nevertheless decisive 
movements of this British army.

3236
03:02:21,980 --> 03:02:26,980
It marches on wondering what has 
happened to the monster which has 

3237
03:02:26,980 --> 03:02:30,701
pursued it with weapon yell since Mom's 
von Bulow finds his right wing being 

3238
03:02:30,701 --> 03:02:35,561
rolled back by the fifth French army and
himself cutoff continually from his 

3239
03:02:35,561 --> 03:02:38,710
right hand to comrade Kluk by the 
British advance Kluk.

3240
03:02:38,810 --> 03:02:43,810
Just as he's got himself into a position
to fight machinery finds his left and 

3241
03:02:43,941 --> 03:02:48,860
all the rear of his left hopelessly 
compromised and exposed and quote.

3242
03:02:50,960 --> 03:02:53,420
It's a crazy moment.
It reminds one of,

3243
03:02:53,660 --> 03:02:58,660
of of warfare in the 18th century.
They used to call it positional warfare 

3244
03:02:58,671 --> 03:03:00,620
where a lot of the fighting was simply 
trying to,

3245
03:03:00,780 --> 03:03:05,780
you know,
March around a flank or or get to a 

3246
03:03:05,780 --> 03:03:08,021
point where you forced your enemy into a
place where they had to retreat just 

3247
03:03:08,021 --> 03:03:11,501
because of positioning by accident.
As Churchill so eloquently put it,

3248
03:03:13,370 --> 03:03:18,370
the British army had almost accidentally
probed its way into the German liver.

3249
03:03:21,100 --> 03:03:24,130
Doesn't get much better than that in 
terms of the high drama does it,

3250
03:03:24,970 --> 03:03:29,970
and it completely obscures the soldier's
perspective on the ground of which we 

3251
03:03:30,701 --> 03:03:34,690
have very little more and more firsthand
accounts,

3252
03:03:34,691 --> 03:03:39,691
especially from the German side,
will be made available as the war goes 

3253
03:03:39,691 --> 03:03:42,871
on.
I keep having to tell myself that a lot 

3254
03:03:42,871 --> 03:03:45,361
of the people fighting in these battles 
will never make it home to write their 

3255
03:03:45,361 --> 03:03:49,861
memoirs.
These are people who don't get to go 

3256
03:03:49,861 --> 03:03:51,730
home until either the war is over or 
there are so vitally injured.

3257
03:03:51,731 --> 03:03:55,030
They can't fight anymore,
and a lot of the German soldiers on this

3258
03:03:55,031 --> 03:04:00,031
frontal might leave memoirs that someone
like yours truly might be lucky enough 

3259
03:04:00,031 --> 03:04:02,960
to have translated into English,
leave their bones on.

3260
03:04:02,961 --> 03:04:06,570
Some of these battlefields nonetheless,
you know,

3261
03:04:06,590 --> 03:04:11,590
one thing's clear,
I remember reading an account once and 

3262
03:04:11,590 --> 03:04:14,261
there's lots of accounts like these and 
you can specifically find them in 

3263
03:04:14,261 --> 03:04:15,110
publications that came out not long 
after the war.

3264
03:04:15,560 --> 03:04:18,200
I remember I have one in my house 
actually in many of you do too.

3265
03:04:18,201 --> 03:04:23,201
It's in a great series of books written 
just after the war and you read it and 

3266
03:04:23,201 --> 03:04:25,070
it's an account of this unbelievable 
battle.

3267
03:04:25,071 --> 03:04:30,071
It sounds like something out of the Lord
of the rings or some Napoleonic thing 

3268
03:04:30,071 --> 03:04:33,440
with charges of 10,000
cavalry mowed down by canons.

3269
03:04:33,441 --> 03:04:35,120
These amazing,
heroic moments,

3270
03:04:35,121 --> 03:04:37,070
German heroism,
French heroism,

3271
03:04:37,400 --> 03:04:41,780
really thrilling moving stuff,
and it turns out that that's just one of

3272
03:04:41,781 --> 03:04:43,820
the little battles.
Well,

3273
03:04:43,880 --> 03:04:47,270
I mean comparatively that formed 
something called the battle of Nancy.

3274
03:04:47,600 --> 03:04:52,600
The Battle of Nancy is just something 
that formed a part of the battle of the 

3275
03:04:52,600 --> 03:04:55,580
Marne.
There are individual stories,

3276
03:04:55,581 --> 03:05:00,581
many battles whose names have been 
forgotten by almost everyone that form 

3277
03:05:01,010 --> 03:05:06,010
the whole here.
The Battle of the Marne is that human 

3278
03:05:06,010 --> 03:05:10,181
tragedy,
as we said earlier about what the 

3279
03:05:10,181 --> 03:05:11,981
civilians are suffering on a mass scale 
and the drama and the suffering and the 

3280
03:05:11,981 --> 03:05:15,461
heroism and the stories that would break
our hearts if we knew them are going on 

3281
03:05:15,461 --> 03:05:18,440
up and down the line from Switzerland to
the Belgian border.

3282
03:05:18,440 --> 03:05:23,440
In fact,
they're going on in the eastern front 

3283
03:05:23,440 --> 03:05:25,571
to.
We haven't even talked about the 

3284
03:05:25,571 --> 03:05:25,571
simultaneous events that are happening.
While this is going on,

3285
03:05:25,820 --> 03:05:27,090
the armies of Luton,
Dorfman,

3286
03:05:27,110 --> 03:05:32,110
Hindenburg,
and the east are wrapping up their 

3287
03:05:32,110 --> 03:05:34,211
conflict.
They're against renon comps army after 

3288
03:05:34,211 --> 03:05:36,581
Tannenberg in Galicia,
which is over kind of were 

3289
03:05:36,581 --> 03:05:39,440
austro-hungarian,
Poland and Russian interests meet.

3290
03:05:39,441 --> 03:05:44,441
There are terrible battles going on.
The Austro-hungarian Hungarians are 

3291
03:05:44,441 --> 03:05:44,660
getting smashed in a way that they will 
never recover from,

3292
03:05:44,810 --> 03:05:47,240
and this is all happening at the same 
time.

3293
03:05:48,020 --> 03:05:53,020
Part of what makes this conflict so 
disorienting for everyone who's facing 

3294
03:05:53,020 --> 03:05:57,701
it is how quickly it's all happened.
When you think about the Second World 

3295
03:05:57,701 --> 03:05:57,701
War,
for example,

3296
03:05:57,701 --> 03:06:02,140
realize that there's no big fighting 
between the major powers for about eight

3297
03:06:02,751 --> 03:06:05,420
months after the Second World War is 
declared.

3298
03:06:05,421 --> 03:06:07,460
Hitler goes into Poland,
Poland falls fast.

3299
03:06:07,630 --> 03:06:12,590
I mean that's all quick and relatively 
painless by world war standards.

3300
03:06:12,890 --> 03:06:15,350
It'll be eight months before the Germans
are in,

3301
03:06:15,710 --> 03:06:18,380
you know,
real big contact with French and British

3302
03:06:18,470 --> 03:06:23,470
armies.
This was three weeks old and all the 

3303
03:06:23,470 --> 03:06:26,951
major participants have clashed head on.
There's more than a million people dead.

3304
03:06:27,920 --> 03:06:32,920
This is the worst nightmare of every 
prewar profit predicting what was going 

3305
03:06:34,641 --> 03:06:39,320
to happen when you combined the mass 
armies that the Napoleonic era unleashed

3306
03:06:39,380 --> 03:06:44,380
on steroids by the way,
with the modern technology and weapons 

3307
03:06:44,380 --> 03:06:48,050
and systems that were being developed 
all through the 18 hundreds.

3308
03:06:48,710 --> 03:06:53,150
This is a great filter.
When you lose more than a million people

3309
03:06:53,270 --> 03:06:56,280
in the first blink of an eye and the is 
now

3310
03:06:56,640 --> 03:07:01,640
obviously going to last a while,
how many people are going to die before 

3311
03:07:01,640 --> 03:07:05,160
this thing reaches a resolution?
What is the resolution

3312
03:07:07,070 --> 03:07:08,300
again?
To simplify it?

3313
03:07:08,301 --> 03:07:13,301
What really happens is when the entire 
French and British line turns around and

3314
03:07:13,371 --> 03:07:18,371
smashes back into the German line,
there's one spot where they just 

3315
03:07:18,371 --> 03:07:22,540
penetrate.
There's nothing really in front of them 

3316
03:07:22,540 --> 03:07:22,790
and that's the spot that the BDF,
the British expeditionary force and some

3317
03:07:22,791 --> 03:07:27,791
French forces go through and see head.
Vaughn and von Bulow not already been 

3318
03:07:29,781 --> 03:07:34,781
fighting somebody they could have turned
and crushed these forces that we're 

3319
03:07:34,781 --> 03:07:39,461
penetrating into that gap,
but they are fighting other people 

3320
03:07:39,461 --> 03:07:43,331
that's known as pinning the enemy.
Clucas fighting those forces that are 

3321
03:07:43,331 --> 03:07:47,141
coming at him from Paris.
Von Bulow is fighting other armies so 

3322
03:07:47,141 --> 03:07:48,230
they can't turn,
and if they do turn than the armies they

3323
03:07:48,231 --> 03:07:49,790
were fighting or hitting them in the 
back,

3324
03:07:50,210 --> 03:07:55,210
they're trapped.
The only thing they can do to alleviate 

3325
03:07:55,210 --> 03:07:59,170
this open flank issue is to pull back 
von Moltke when all this is going on,

3326
03:08:03,040 --> 03:08:06,760
falls apart,
and if you ask me,

3327
03:08:06,880 --> 03:08:11,880
understandably so,
this is a guy who's been under 

3328
03:08:11,880 --> 03:08:15,930
tremendous pressure already and as he 
watches this plan,

3329
03:08:17,380 --> 03:08:22,380
so important that for years it had been 
known as dare tog the day when this plan

3330
03:08:23,171 --> 03:08:24,430
is finally used.
You know,

3331
03:08:24,431 --> 03:08:25,990
whatever the heck the plan was.
Really,

3332
03:08:25,991 --> 03:08:29,170
this day means the day that the Germans 
launched the war,

3333
03:08:29,860 --> 03:08:32,170
he's watching it collapsed in front of 
his eyes,

3334
03:08:33,340 --> 03:08:38,170
realizing also that this will all be 
blamed on him.

3335
03:08:38,171 --> 03:08:39,970
He's coming apart at the seams

3336
03:08:41,890 --> 03:08:46,260
he writes to his wife.
Has all of this is becoming clear quote,

3337
03:08:46,930 --> 03:08:51,930
I cannot find words to describe the 
crushing responsibility that is weight 

3338
03:08:51,930 --> 03:08:55,000
upon my shoulders during the last few 
days and still weighs on me today.

3339
03:08:55,420 --> 03:08:58,060
The appalling difficulties of our 
present situation.

3340
03:08:58,061 --> 03:09:02,020
Hang before my eyes like a dark curtain 
through which I can see nothing.

3341
03:09:03,430 --> 03:09:07,240
And to quote one of UNMOLD costs.
Staff officers,

3342
03:09:08,110 --> 03:09:11,140
a colonel named Bauer wrote,
quote,

3343
03:09:11,680 --> 03:09:16,060
desperate panics seized severely the 
entire army or to be more correct.

3344
03:09:16,120 --> 03:09:21,120
The greater part of its leaders.
It looked at its worst at the supreme 

3345
03:09:21,120 --> 03:09:22,510
command.
Multaka completely collapsed.

3346
03:09:22,660 --> 03:09:26,080
He sat with a Pallid face gazing at the 
map dead.

3347
03:09:26,081 --> 03:09:30,250
Do all feeling a broken man.
End Quote.

3348
03:09:32,340 --> 03:09:37,340
Churchill was sympathetic when he wrote,
quote everything now converged upon 

3349
03:09:38,260 --> 03:09:40,140
[inaudible],
who was [inaudible].

3350
03:09:40,380 --> 03:09:45,380
He was the shadow of a great name.
He was the nephew of the old field 

3351
03:09:45,380 --> 03:09:48,750
marshal and had been his aide de camp.
He was an ordinary man rather,

3352
03:09:48,751 --> 03:09:50,910
according air,
a man about the palace,

3353
03:09:50,911 --> 03:09:53,770
agreeable to the emperor in the me of 
peace,

3354
03:09:54,070 --> 03:09:59,070
the sort of man who does not make too 
much trouble with the sovereign who 

3355
03:09:59,070 --> 03:09:59,500
knows how to suppress his own 
personality,

3356
03:09:59,590 --> 03:10:01,960
what there is of it,
a good harmless,

3357
03:10:02,020 --> 03:10:04,060
respectable,
ordinary man,

3358
03:10:04,270 --> 03:10:08,650
and onto this ill fated being crashes,
the brutal remorseless,

3359
03:10:08,680 --> 03:10:13,680
centripetal impingement of tides and 
compulsion's under which the greatest 

3360
03:10:13,680 --> 03:10:17,731
captains of history might have blanched 
and quote Multaka had later written 

3361
03:10:18,730 --> 03:10:23,080
while he still lived that in the moment 
of supreme crisis,

3362
03:10:23,081 --> 03:10:28,081
he had grown quite nervous and quote 
lots of sources.

3363
03:10:31,831 --> 03:10:36,180
Report that von Mold Cup went to the 
Kaiser at this point and said,

3364
03:10:36,181 --> 03:10:38,580
majesty,
we just lost the war.

3365
03:10:39,820 --> 03:10:42,150
I have never been able to confirm that 
though,

3366
03:10:42,890 --> 03:10:46,470
and truth be told they didn't lose the 
war here.

3367
03:10:47,900 --> 03:10:52,900
What's just happened is the chances for 
an early knockout blow an outright 

3368
03:10:52,900 --> 03:10:55,340
German victory.
That's what's been compromised,

3369
03:10:55,341 --> 03:10:58,250
and I'm going to say compromise because 
it's an open question.

3370
03:10:58,251 --> 03:11:03,251
Whether or not the Germans blew this or 
the French simply rallied and gain the 

3371
03:11:04,011 --> 03:11:07,490
victory.
There are lots of mistakes on the German

3372
03:11:07,491 --> 03:11:11,480
side that people will point to basically
insinuating that without those mistakes,

3373
03:11:11,630 --> 03:11:16,630
the French go down and yet look at the 
fact that they were still there after 

3374
03:11:17,751 --> 03:11:22,751
suffering unprecedented levels of 
casualties and punishment

3375
03:11:24,920 --> 03:11:29,920
and forget about that for a minute and 
understand the condition that those 

3376
03:11:29,920 --> 03:11:31,670
armies are in before they turn around at
the battle of the Marne.

3377
03:11:31,880 --> 03:11:34,730
They are falling apart,
dead on their feet,

3378
03:11:35,060 --> 03:11:40,060
you know,
wearing rags and unable to keep their 

3379
03:11:40,060 --> 03:11:42,200
eyes open and that's who the general 
from the first army,

3380
03:11:42,201 --> 03:11:47,201
von Cluck,
that's who he singles out when he talks 

3381
03:11:47,201 --> 03:11:50,090
about the part you know of this war so 
far that surprised him.

3382
03:11:50,840 --> 03:11:55,010
He wrote quote that men will let 
themselves be killed where they stand is

3383
03:11:55,011 --> 03:11:58,610
a well known thing and counted on in 
every plan of battle,

3384
03:11:58,940 --> 03:12:03,940
but that men who have retreated for 10 
days sleeping on the ground and half 

3385
03:12:03,940 --> 03:12:08,591
dead with fatigue should be able to take
up their rifles and attack when the 

3386
03:12:08,591 --> 03:12:12,551
bugle sounds.
It is a thing upon which we never 

3387
03:12:12,551 --> 03:12:15,341
counted,
it was a possibility not studied in our 

3388
03:12:15,341 --> 03:12:15,440
war academy and quote.

3389
03:12:17,210 --> 03:12:22,210
So he was obviously impressed.
There's no way to deny and,

3390
03:12:22,581 --> 03:12:24,620
and listen,
we don't want to shortchange the British

3391
03:12:24,621 --> 03:12:29,621
expeditionary force either,
that they proved to be potentially 

3392
03:12:29,621 --> 03:12:31,580
crucial to this whole thing and as 
Churchill pointed out,

3393
03:12:31,581 --> 03:12:35,510
sort of providential he at the right 
place and at the right time sometimes,

3394
03:12:35,960 --> 03:12:40,960
but this is one of those victories where
you just have to tip your hat a little 

3395
03:12:40,960 --> 03:12:43,430
bit to what the French achieved.
This is monumental stuff.

3396
03:12:43,740 --> 03:12:45,620
Um,
it is truly heroic.

3397
03:12:45,621 --> 03:12:47,840
It's a little like the Alamo for 
Americans,

3398
03:12:47,841 --> 03:12:52,841
but on an enormous scale.
And at the same time I want to remember 

3399
03:12:52,841 --> 03:12:55,490
the Germans in all this too.
As we said earlier,

3400
03:12:56,120 --> 03:13:01,120
they get a bad rap from a lot of us 
because of the Second World War and 

3401
03:13:01,281 --> 03:13:06,281
rightly so,
but a lot of that is connected to the 

3402
03:13:06,281 --> 03:13:06,281
first world war in a funny way.
I see them,

3403
03:13:06,530 --> 03:13:11,530
you know,
not to bring up some sort of science 

3404
03:13:11,530 --> 03:13:11,530
fiction reference.

3405
03:13:11,530 --> 03:13:11,530
I mean,
where would that come from?

3406
03:13:11,530 --> 03:13:15,071
But,
but they're a little like an akin 

3407
03:13:15,071 --> 03:13:15,071
skywalker,
this,

3408
03:13:15,071 --> 03:13:17,240
this nation that's new and young and has
so much promise and potential.

3409
03:13:17,630 --> 03:13:20,750
Hg Wells had the greatest name for them 
I've ever heard at this point.

3410
03:13:20,751 --> 03:13:24,890
He called them the best and the 
wickedest nation in the world.

3411
03:13:25,190 --> 03:13:27,710
You know,
the militarism that so scared him in his

3412
03:13:27,711 --> 03:13:32,660
socialistic sensibilities was balanced 
out by the fact that the Germans were so

3413
03:13:32,661 --> 03:13:36,020
admirable in so many respects what the 
Germans called color tour,

3414
03:13:36,200 --> 03:13:41,200
their music and their and their writings
and their sophistication and and and 

3415
03:13:41,200 --> 03:13:42,140
their science,
my gosh,

3416
03:13:42,141 --> 03:13:47,141
and their education.
We wells is overflowing with all these 

3417
03:13:47,141 --> 03:13:49,691
wonderful things to say about Germans,
but they've got this flaw and it's this 

3418
03:13:49,691 --> 03:13:53,120
militarism and they're the best and the 
wicked is people in Europe and somewhere

3419
03:13:53,121 --> 03:13:56,840
along the line and akin skywalker turns 
into darth vader in the poor.

3420
03:13:56,841 --> 03:14:01,841
Germans get that to be their image for 
the 20th century.

3421
03:14:02,510 --> 03:14:07,510
You wonder again what the enormous 
stakes of this in a German really defeat

3422
03:14:08,900 --> 03:14:11,440
our.
If unmold can.

3423
03:14:11,450 --> 03:14:16,450
The Germans had been victorious here.
The entire German history in the 20th 

3424
03:14:16,450 --> 03:14:17,990
century is different and perhaps much,
much,

3425
03:14:17,991 --> 03:14:22,991
much more positive,
almost certainly for Germans and for 

3426
03:14:22,991 --> 03:14:23,390
everyone else too.
I think

3427
03:14:24,820 --> 03:14:26,620
it's a very interesting what if 
scenario,

3428
03:14:28,040 --> 03:14:33,040
and it's important to remember that when
you think about these soldiers dying on 

3429
03:14:33,040 --> 03:14:33,590
the ground in these nameless awful 
battles,

3430
03:14:33,890 --> 03:14:35,360
whether they be French,
British,

3431
03:14:35,540 --> 03:14:37,460
German,
or very soon,

3432
03:14:37,461 --> 03:14:42,100
a lot more people from Canada and South 
Africa and Australia and India,

3433
03:14:42,101 --> 03:14:47,101
China,
I mean this is going to become an 

3434
03:14:47,101 --> 03:14:48,641
internationalized war soon.
All these people are good people caught 

3435
03:14:48,641 --> 03:14:48,960
up.
Well,

3436
03:14:48,961 --> 03:14:50,540
they're just people caught up in,
in,

3437
03:14:50,570 --> 03:14:55,570
in the grand plans and grinding wheels 
of of nation states.

3438
03:14:56,750 --> 03:15:00,830
They went into these conflicts for 
reasons that are understandable today,

3439
03:15:01,520 --> 03:15:05,570
patriotism duty,
love of country to protect your family,

3440
03:15:05,571 --> 03:15:10,571
all those kinds of things.
They also went for reasons that were 

3441
03:15:10,571 --> 03:15:11,270
really important still in the 19th 
century,

3442
03:15:11,660 --> 03:15:15,680
but that are a little different today.
Glory heroism,

3443
03:15:15,710 --> 03:15:17,270
Romance,
as I said,

3444
03:15:17,271 --> 03:15:20,480
they still exist but not quite like they
did back.

3445
03:15:21,020 --> 03:15:22,460
You know,
from the beginning of history,

3446
03:15:22,461 --> 03:15:25,760
until right around this time in 
September 19,

3447
03:15:25,761 --> 03:15:30,761
14,
a general named von [inaudible] talked 

3448
03:15:30,761 --> 03:15:34,331
about the changes that this first month 
of the first world war and created in 

3449
03:15:34,331 --> 03:15:37,040
that facade of romantic war when he said
quote,

3450
03:15:37,340 --> 03:15:42,340
if war was once a chivalrous dual,
it's now a dastardly slaughter and 

3451
03:15:43,070 --> 03:15:43,550
quote,

3452
03:15:45,040 --> 03:15:48,270
the suffering on the ground,
regardless of which side you're on,

3453
03:15:48,271 --> 03:15:52,230
is pitiable and horrific.
And you know,

3454
03:15:52,280 --> 03:15:57,280
I always try to make sure,
and I hope I'm successful at this that 

3455
03:15:57,280 --> 03:16:01,220
were never exploitive of the,
of the terrible things that are going on

3456
03:16:01,221 --> 03:16:03,030
to the people in these stories.
We retell.

3457
03:16:04,050 --> 03:16:06,990
The reason that I use them is because 
for me,

3458
03:16:07,350 --> 03:16:12,300
these stories intrigue me because I 
always put myself in them and then I try

3459
03:16:12,301 --> 03:16:17,301
to imagine handling these things and as 
a person who's interested in the 

3460
03:16:17,791 --> 03:16:22,791
extremes of human experience,
there are almost no exceptions to the 

3461
03:16:23,641 --> 03:16:26,040
stories we talk about on this program.
I can't imagine it.

3462
03:16:26,700 --> 03:16:31,700
I mean,
I just feel like I would wilt under the 

3463
03:16:31,700 --> 03:16:32,220
pressures that these people lived 
through.

3464
03:16:34,240 --> 03:16:39,240
I mean,
when you talk about being interested in 

3465
03:16:39,240 --> 03:16:42,641
the extremes of human nature and 
wondering what I would do in the same 

3466
03:16:42,641 --> 03:16:46,961
situation,
I think about the worst places in the 

3467
03:16:46,961 --> 03:16:46,961
world you can think of.
Um,

3468
03:16:46,961 --> 03:16:49,370
and if there's a top three or four or 
five lists out there,

3469
03:16:49,700 --> 03:16:54,700
one of them on my list is the western 
front in the first world war and we're 

3470
03:16:54,700 --> 03:16:59,651
about to get there.
And it is about the worst experience in 

3471
03:16:59,651 --> 03:16:59,651
the world.

3472
03:17:06,330 --> 03:17:08,790
I was joking on the hardcore history 
twitter feed,

3473
03:17:09,150 --> 03:17:14,150
which by the way,
you can follow it at hardcore history 

3474
03:17:14,150 --> 03:17:17,480
that it's taking us longer to get the 
episode you've just heard released and 

3475
03:17:17,671 --> 03:17:19,170
to you.
And by the way,

3476
03:17:19,171 --> 03:17:21,570
thank you for your patients.
It's always appreciated.

3477
03:17:22,150 --> 03:17:25,380
Then the amount of time that was 
actually covered in the episode itself.

3478
03:17:26,810 --> 03:17:31,520
And I think if you were crunching the 
data and projecting outward based on how

3479
03:17:31,521 --> 03:17:36,521
long the show you just heard was,
you've probably figured that it's going 

3480
03:17:36,521 --> 03:17:38,810
to take us about 250 episodes to cover 
the first world war.

3481
03:17:38,811 --> 03:17:40,880
And God forbid we go afterwards and to 
19,

3482
03:17:40,881 --> 03:17:45,881
19 and the treaties and all that,
we'll be doing this the rest of our 

3483
03:17:45,881 --> 03:17:46,100
lives.
We're obviously not going to do that.

3484
03:17:46,140 --> 03:17:49,850
Um,
the episode you just heard focused on,

3485
03:17:50,000 --> 03:17:52,550
to be honest,
I'm a series of events,

3486
03:17:52,551 --> 03:17:57,551
the prewar stuff and the,
the first and opening moves that's 

3487
03:17:57,551 --> 03:18:00,230
common in almost all the approaches of 
the first world war because they set the

3488
03:18:00,231 --> 03:18:02,210
stage for what comes afterwards.
For example,

3489
03:18:02,570 --> 03:18:04,040
already,
you know,

3490
03:18:04,041 --> 03:18:08,840
as this story ends,
the trenches are cropping up organically

3491
03:18:08,960 --> 03:18:13,390
along the western front.
It's the iconic image of the first World

3492
03:18:13,390 --> 03:18:13,600
War,
right?

3493
03:18:13,601 --> 03:18:16,180
Trenches have always been known.
Fortifications always been known.

3494
03:18:16,181 --> 03:18:19,540
Going back to ancient history,
but never on this scale,

3495
03:18:19,780 --> 03:18:22,360
never this long,
never in positions,

3496
03:18:22,730 --> 03:18:27,730
you know,
that we're on as almost immobile as 

3497
03:18:27,730 --> 03:18:27,730
this.
Never under these sorts of conditions.

3498
03:18:27,730 --> 03:18:31,951
It's going to create an almost unique 
experience for the people who have to go

3499
03:18:32,461 --> 03:18:32,940
through it.

3500
03:18:33,910 --> 03:18:38,910
And again,
something fascinating when I consider 

3501
03:18:38,910 --> 03:18:40,090
how I myself would have behaved in 
similar circumstances,

3502
03:18:41,020 --> 03:18:45,160
but it's going to make the battles 
somewhat similar,

3503
03:18:45,780 --> 03:18:50,780
you know,
so you'll be able to a little bit about 

3504
03:18:50,780 --> 03:18:53,970
the big ones,
but not have to go too much into the 

3505
03:18:53,970 --> 03:18:56,341
experience over and over again because 
it becomes similar in each of the 

3506
03:18:56,341 --> 03:19:00,121
battles.
The people fighting in the trenches in 

3507
03:19:00,121 --> 03:19:01,831
one battle often have similar sorts of 
day to day experiences from people 

3508
03:19:01,831 --> 03:19:03,460
fighting in the trenches in another 
battle.

3509
03:19:03,760 --> 03:19:08,760
So we will have the opportunity as the 
program moves along to zoom in and zoom 

3510
03:19:08,760 --> 03:19:13,471
out as needed.
This is going to allow us though to 

3511
03:19:13,471 --> 03:19:17,551
focus on a bunch of other things,
including how the generals managed to 

3512
03:19:17,551 --> 03:19:20,080
deal with the fact that they're no 
longer operating with prewar plans.

3513
03:19:20,230 --> 03:19:24,850
They have to actually think now learn,
apply their thinking in novel ways.

3514
03:19:24,850 --> 03:19:29,850
We're going to find out how flexible 
these 19th century men are as they try 

3515
03:19:29,850 --> 03:19:34,171
to adjust on the fly in real time to the
challenges of 20th century warfare,

3516
03:19:35,230 --> 03:19:40,230
which no one's ever really tried yet.
They're going to have to contend with 

3517
03:19:40,230 --> 03:19:43,090
and we are going to deal with questions 
like changes in the air,

3518
03:19:44,050 --> 03:19:49,050
changes at c,
changes involving WMD and things we're 

3519
03:19:49,511 --> 03:19:54,511
still dealing with today and changes 
involving the scope of this war that 

3520
03:19:55,871 --> 03:19:57,610
encompasses,
you know,

3521
03:19:57,611 --> 03:20:00,640
the rest of the world basically in one 
way or another.

3522
03:20:01,660 --> 03:20:06,580
The first world war is about to go 
global and underground.

3523
03:20:07,330 --> 03:20:10,990
In the next episode of blueprint for 
Armageddon,

3524
03:20:18,810 --> 03:20:23,810
we just want to make it clear that we 
are bought and paid for around 

3525
03:20:23,810 --> 03:20:27,261
here@DanCarlin.com.
Thanks again for all your bucket show 

3526
03:20:27,261 --> 03:20:28,410
donations.
They're the reason we're still here.
