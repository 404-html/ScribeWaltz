1
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:17,950
Which military was superior?
The first world war,

2
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:23,130
military of the German imperial state 
where the Second World War,

3
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,020
military of Nazi Germany.

4
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,760
I know that sounds like a random 
question,

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,020
but it's actually something that I get 
asked about all the time.

6
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,830
All the time.
It's not so random either because these 

7
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:40,980
people are not just asking me that 
question out of thin air.

8
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,510
They are asking me to elaborate on a 
statement that I once made kind of a 

9
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,810
throw away line,
if I'm remembering correctly,

10
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:51,890
where I had pointed out that I thought 
that the first world war,

11
00:00:51,891 --> 00:00:56,891
a German military,
and when we say that we mean the entire 

12
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:56,891
defense apparatus,
right?

13
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:59,190
The entire structure.
Not the army per se,

14
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:04,191
not the navy per se,
but all of it put together with the 

15
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:04,690
industry,
the grand strategy,

16
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:09,691
the.
I mean the states and and armies are 

17
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:11,790
intertwined in ways that are key.
So let's understand that,

18
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:14,430
but when we compare or when I do compare
the two,

19
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:16,980
I was comparing the entire structure 
against the entire structure.

20
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:21,981
First World War Germany is military 
against Second World War Germany 

21
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:21,981
military.

22
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:25,860
Now what I was not prepared for was the 
fact that this would be so surprising to

23
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:28,170
so many people and interesting to them 
to be honest.

24
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:28,920
I mean,
like I said,

25
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:33,921
I've,
I've been asked to elaborate on that 

26
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:37,101
question many times and no one is 
argumentative by the way or upset 

27
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,350
they're interested.
They're curious and it took me a while 

28
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,811
to realize why,
but I think I figured out that it's 

29
00:01:44,811 --> 00:01:48,621
because it's counterintuitive.
Most people out there who are not World 

30
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:51,510
War II buffs just assume because my 
goodness,

31
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:55,020
who hasn't heard seen hours of black and
white footage or what have you,

32
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,500
you know,
all the stuff that Nazi Germany was 

33
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,481
working on from ballistic missiles to 
Panzer divisions to jet aircraft.

34
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:03,190
I mean,
you know,

35
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,200
there's Nazi scientists are such great 
fodder even today that that's why you 

36
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,490
have them in all the comic books and the
Red Scout on the captain American.

37
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,580
I mean Odessa said the boys from Brazil.
I mean it goes on and on.

38
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:17,100
This Nazi science thing is fascinating 
and so,

39
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,000
so mid.
You know,

40
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,060
it's not steam punk because it's too 
late.

41
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:26,061
It's whatever.
The mid 20th century version of steam 

42
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:26,940
punk is first World War Germany really 
is steam punk.

43
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,440
I guess what I'm trying to say is I 
think there's been a lot of hype for 

44
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,010
Second World War Germany,
the first World War Germany doesn't get,

45
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,300
and that's what makes it compelling to 
hear a different opinion to some people.

46
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,180
Now,
why the heck am I talking about this now

47
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:47,181
and what?
What are we even doing here towards a 

48
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:49,161
little explanation since this is the 
first new podcast we started in more 

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
than a decade and really the first thing
we were going to do is just throw all 

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,420
this on the history feed,
figuring that it's history,

51
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,260
but you people have taught me a valuable
lesson over time and that's that you 

52
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,050
don't want anything that isn't what 
you're expecting on that feed.

53
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,660
You may be okay with me interviewing 
people,

54
00:03:08,661 --> 00:03:13,661
but you don't want it on your hardcore 
history feed when you think you're 

55
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,181
getting a hardcore history episodes 
downloaded and it turns out to be an 

56
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:16,181
interview.
So we've learned you want something very

57
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:19,130
specific on the hardcore history,
proper feed.

58
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,680
The problem for us of course,
and maybe you too,

59
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,450
is that we're averaging about two point 
five new shows a year on that feed,

60
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,840
which is a long time to be out of touch 
with your audience.

61
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,650
So for a very long time we have been 
looking for some sort of content,

62
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,710
I guess you could call short form 
content.

63
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:40,670
I'm obviously a long form guy.
Takes me 20 minutes to clear my throat.

64
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:45,150
As you all know,
originally a long time ago,

65
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:49,140
the idea of blitz additions which was 
supposed to mean short now it just means

66
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:54,141
a completely different kind of focus on 
the show that was supposed to fill this 

67
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:54,141
gap,
didn't work.

68
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,590
We are cutting back and that might be 
um,

69
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:03,520
that might be an optimistic way of even 
putting it on the common sense stuff 

70
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:03,710
right now.
So how do you better use the time that,

71
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:04,760
that would free up?
Well,

72
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,400
how about touching base with the 
hardcore history audience?

73
00:04:07,401 --> 00:04:10,130
More than two point five times a year.
So that's what we're trying to do here.

74
00:04:10,131 --> 00:04:15,131
And just so you know,
I couldn't decide on a format because I 

75
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:18,281
liked all of them to a degree,
but I didn't want to get locked into 

76
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:18,281
anything.
I mean,

77
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:22,181
I like interviews,
but I don't want to have to do them all 

78
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:22,181
the time.
I don't want to do an interview show per

79
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:25,631
se.
I like doing short little history 

80
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:29,970
things.
If I can manage to do anything short 

81
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:29,970
that don't turn into hardcore history 
show,

82
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,820
but I don't want to be responsible for 
doing that every time.

83
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:32,770
Right.
The last thing we want to do is do a new

84
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:35,950
show that takes away from the old show 
that already takes too long to do.

85
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:40,951
Right?
So we understand the parameters with 

86
00:04:40,951 --> 00:04:44,071
which we're working here.
Led Zepplin once said that their format 

87
00:04:44,281 --> 00:04:46,410
for their music was tight,
but loose.

88
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,800
That's the way I like to operate to.
Let's say let's have a format where,

89
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:51,420
you know,
it's our stuff,

90
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,760
right?
We are recognizably us.

91
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,500
But what's you're going to get?

92
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,400
That's anybody's guess.
Um,

93
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,000
this is,
for lack of a better word.

94
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:00,500
And I still don't know what we're going 
to call this.

95
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,990
This is the hardcore history overflow 
feed.

96
00:05:02,991 --> 00:05:05,030
This is everything we're not putting in 
the regular feed,

97
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:07,970
whether it's interviews with historians,
biographers,

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
or maybe historical participants from 
time to time.

99
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:16,001
Love to do some primary source work 
where we could record somebody's 

100
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:20,740
memories in digital stone and then maybe
somewhere down the line historian can 

101
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,971
mine that for useful info someday.
Be great to contribute to the storehouse

102
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:30,821
of personal experiences and knowledge.
I do have weird things I'd like to throw

103
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,130
out there.
Sometimes I may love to have a recurring

104
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:36,580
segment that I call the worst place to 
be in the world.

105
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,960
I think it's self explanatory,
but I have a bunch of little things like

106
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:41,620
that.
Nothing that.

107
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,920
Nothing that I think you could base a 
whole podcast series on forever but 

108
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,800
enough so maybe we can throw some stuff 
out there.

109
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:48,370
Not,
you know,

110
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:53,371
we couldn't figure out how to make it 
anything but Matt to you when you're 

111
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:57,000
expecting five hours or hardcore history
depth and you get 20 minutes of 

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,430
scampering over thin ice.
I mean,

113
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,370
is there anything we could do in 20 
minutes where you would go,

114
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:06,371
yeah,
that was great when you were expecting 

115
00:06:06,371 --> 00:06:06,371
five hours.
I don't know,

116
00:06:06,371 --> 00:06:09,020
but we feel like if nothing else,
I would love to say hi to you more often

117
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:14,021
and that's what this is,
so the reason we're talking about the 

118
00:06:14,021 --> 00:06:17,591
two World War militaries of Germany and 
comparing them is because after the 

119
00:06:17,591 --> 00:06:22,340
thousandth person asked me recently to 
elaborate on that question,

120
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,540
I was walking away from the discussion 
and a person who may or may not be real,

121
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,950
who was with me,
turned to me and said,

122
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:32,951
why don't you make that a podcast?
Just do a whole show on answering that 

123
00:06:32,951 --> 00:06:37,181
question.
Which military was better first or 

124
00:06:37,181 --> 00:06:37,181
Second World War Germany?
He goes,

125
00:06:37,181 --> 00:06:38,750
you get asked about it enough.
There's obviously an interest out there.

126
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,090
Why can't that just be a show answered 
that question?

127
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:42,380
Twenty minutes,
25 minutes,

128
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:43,100
whatever it is.
Boom.

129
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:44,660
Thrown out on the end,
done right,

130
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,700
said hi to the audience and everything.

131
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,450
I think if we could get one of those out
a month,

132
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:53,960
wouldn't that fill in the gap a little 
bit between epic hardcore history shows,

133
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,670
but I don't know if it's going to 
provide anything of venture,

134
00:06:57,671 --> 00:06:59,870
so we're experimenting here a little 
bit.

135
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:04,871
I'd like to answer that question if I 
can and maybe this'll be one of the 

136
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:08,291
recurring segments where I essentially 
stand up amongst all of you and I make 

137
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,710
my case.
I'm not saying I'm right.

138
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,040
I certainly am coming at this from an 
angle of a,

139
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,400
this is my opinion,
but let me throw out my viewpoint and 

140
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,211
then you can talk amongst yourselves and
decide whether you give it any validity 

141
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:25,811
or not and of course me being me,
I had planned to come in here and just 

142
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:28,961
do it off the off the cuff so it didn't 
take any hardcore history recording 

143
00:07:28,961 --> 00:07:29,540
time,
but I can't add to pull out the books,

144
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,960
look up some stuff.
I figured who wants to just hear my 

145
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:34,960
opinion?
You've got to have a few supports.

146
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,711
Carlin,
you can't walk in there and just you 

147
00:07:38,711 --> 00:07:38,711
know you to.
If you're gonna be a lawyer.

148
00:07:38,711 --> 00:07:38,930
You've got to cite some things,
so I have a few things to site.

149
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:44,400
Obviously this whole question is a bit 
silly and war Gamey,

150
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,510
if you will,
but I like my silly wargame he questions

151
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:49,310
to be as scientific,
hardheaded,

152
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:51,590
realistic and logical as possible,
don't you?

153
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:58,100
So let's lay out some parameters.
The first thing we have to point out is 

154
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,160
we are not talking about these two 
armies fighting each other,

155
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,250
right?
We all understand how silly that would 

156
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,201
be.
It wasn't always silly and I've always 

157
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:06,810
found that interesting up until a 
certain point in history,

158
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:12,140
each not wild to imagine armies that 
existed in very different time periods 

159
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,430
successfully fighting one.
Another few said Alexander,

160
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:19,290
the great's army's going to take on 
Julius Caesar's.

161
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,200
Romans,
which were about 250 years later.

162
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,230
You don't automatically say Alexander's 
doomed.

163
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,690
You Bet your money on Caesar and the 
Romans,

164
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:30,330
but if you said Alexander had a 25 
percent chance of winning,

165
00:08:30,331 --> 00:08:35,331
I don't think that's wrong,
but that's 250 years difference in time 

166
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:38,370
by about what would you say,
the mid 19th century,

167
00:08:38,371 --> 00:08:43,371
somewhere that all changes when the pace
of change speeds up and all of a sudden 

168
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,570
if you're a great power and you find 
your battlefield technology 30,

169
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,250
30,
five years out of date,

170
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,570
you're in big trouble

171
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:58,630
and by the 20th century you can see this
pace of change acceleration going so 

172
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,381
fast that the innovations that occur 
inside of a war can win or lose you.

173
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:09,211
The war.
I think you most clearly see this for 

174
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:12,301
the first time in the air war in the 
first world war where if you get a leap 

175
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:17,580
in terms of a technological innovation 
for airplanes ahead of the other side 

176
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,250
and you get your planes in the air,
it could be six months of owning the sky

177
00:09:21,251 --> 00:09:26,251
before the other side catches up and in 
certain circumstances that could cost 

178
00:09:26,251 --> 00:09:27,430
you the war.
So this technological race is getting so

179
00:09:27,431 --> 00:09:28,720
fast.
We end up,

180
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,840
certainly by the early 20th century with
the

181
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,900
dynamic that we see all the time now and
that we're very comfortable with the 

182
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,661
idea of innovation happening all the 
time during the war and the Second World

183
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,170
War all you second world war buffs.
I mean,

184
00:09:41,171 --> 00:09:46,171
how often do you think of which 
particular variant of this particular 

185
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:46,171
plane is this an emi one?
Oh,

186
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:49,030
nine e or g because it makes a huge 
difference.

187
00:09:49,031 --> 00:09:49,600
Right?
Why?

188
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,890
Because the pace of change will 
literally when you were lose you the war

189
00:09:53,891 --> 00:09:58,891
by about the first or Second World War.
So we're not comparing these two armies 

190
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:01,990
against each other because even the 1918
version of the German army,

191
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,170
which is really an Alpha or a Beta 
version of the wehrmacht and yet it 

192
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:12,481
ain't facing the Wehrmacht successfully 
at all and it's only a 20 year 

193
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:16,431
difference between the two.
So we're not pitting them against each 

194
00:10:16,431 --> 00:10:16,431
other.
We're petting them,

195
00:10:16,431 --> 00:10:21,010
you know,
on a curve based on their historical 

196
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,041
enemies.
And that point I made a second ago I 

197
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:23,290
think is very relevant.
Only 20 years between each other.

198
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,020
When you're 20 years old,
that seems like a long time,

199
00:10:26,021 --> 00:10:28,030
but when you get to 50,
like I am,

200
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:31,090
50 1:20
years looks short.

201
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,410
As one historian said,
20 years is not peace.

202
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,990
It's an intermission.
I had a air force colonel I grew up next

203
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:44,020
door to.
He always said it was the equivalent of 

204
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,081
reloading.
It always boggles the mind a little bit 

205
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:52,370
to realize how quickly the Germans were 
moving to get around the treaty 

206
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:57,561
restrictions.
I mean some historians have pushed it 

207
00:10:57,561 --> 00:10:57,561
all the way back to like 19,
19,

208
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,840
which if true would mean that the seeds 
of rearmament we're already being sown 

209
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,910
as the agreement to end.
The first World War was being concluded.

210
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,170
That's wild.

211
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:16,670
You all know that there were things 
going on in the Soviet Union where they 

212
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,581
had hidden deals to develop weapons 
systems and tactics and factories and 

213
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:22,731
all that stuff on Russian soil hidden 
from the prying eyes of the people who 

214
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:27,051
would enforce these treaties.
The German attitude would probably be 

215
00:11:27,051 --> 00:11:30,930
that the treaties were forced upon 
Germany under false pretenses.

216
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:35,931
I mean,
there's a lot of criticism you can make 

217
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:35,931
against those versailles,
treaty restrictions.

218
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:35,931
In fact,
the allies,

219
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,770
you know,
before Hitler came to power,

220
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:42,771
there were lots of negotiations about 
cutting slack on some of this stuff 

221
00:11:42,771 --> 00:11:42,771
later.

222
00:11:42,771 --> 00:11:43,810
Nonetheless,
the point is,

223
00:11:43,811 --> 00:11:47,560
is that long before Hitler was in 
anybody's rearview mirror,

224
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,370
even in the Weimar Republic,
early days,

225
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:57,030
you know,
you already an attempt to rearm Germany 

226
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:01,171
or set the groundwork,
laid the groundwork for rearmament and 

227
00:12:01,171 --> 00:12:04,891
it provides an interesting what if 
scenario to wonder if Hitler had never 

228
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:08,491
come to power?
How much of his early agenda happens 

229
00:12:08,491 --> 00:12:10,420
under any German government?
I mean,

230
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:15,421
in my mind,
it's hard to imagine any German 

231
00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:17,210
government not eventually remilitarizing
the land,

232
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:22,230
you know,
even if you're a Weimar republic 

233
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,911
democratic ones.
So it's interesting to wonder about the 

234
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,090
early stuff that Hitler did and whether 
a Weimar Republic might've done it too.

235
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,810
And it's also intriguing to note,
you know,

236
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,840
that long before Hitler,
the foundation was being laid for the 

237
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,720
rebuilding of the German military.
For those who don't know,

238
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:38,680
the German military at the end of the 
first world war was essentially I'm torn

239
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:42,970
apart.
An army that had numbered in the several

240
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:47,971
millions at one point in the field was 
reduced to 100,000

241
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:52,981
men,
a one person at the time called them a 

242
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:56,071
police force.
Paramilitary is the way there somehow 

243
00:12:56,071 --> 00:12:58,951
described now,
which basically means something between 

244
00:12:58,951 --> 00:12:59,680
a police force and a soldier,
100,000

245
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:02,710
men,
their neighbors all had many more.

246
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,010
All kinds of weapons systems are 
prohibited.

247
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:12,370
The reason all this stuff matters is 
because in this short period of time 

248
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:16,631
between the two world wars,
the Germans have to recreate an army 

249
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:20,531
from scratch and they can't even really 
get going until the Middle Nineteen 

250
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:24,821
thirties.
So how deep do the roots of this thing 

251
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:30,041
go?
Even if you attach it to the earlier 

252
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,250
military traditions when you compare it 
to the first World War German state,

253
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
which has these deep old roots and they 
can trace it to to before Germany was a 

254
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,801
state with the histories of several 
different individual German states like 

255
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:42,650
Prussia in Bavaria and all these places.

256
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:49,690
The first World War German state is one,
you're like a bodybuilder who's been 

257
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,770
eating right and building themselves up 
slowly but surely the one in the second 

258
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:58,151
world war as somebody who had to go 
heavily into steroids because of a 

259
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:01,541
terrible injury and they come into the 
war looking pumped up and initially 

260
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:05,981
doing good,
but when you know something that was 

261
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:07,160
supposed to be an easy knockout,
turns into a slug fest.

262
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,580
If you had the legs to weather the storm
into the later rounds,

263
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,270
you know I can't help but use the boxing
analogies.

264
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,500
Can I?
And in that sense,

265
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:17,300
you'd have to say that both of these 
armies,

266
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:22,301
the first and Second World War German 
armies are big punchers knockout 

267
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:26,381
artists.
But the Second World War One is like 

268
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:28,370
Mike Tyson,
malevolent,

269
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,480
intimidating,
awesome throws.

270
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:33,550
These knockout blows,
knockout,

271
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,580
knockout people spectacularly.
Can't take your eyes off him,

272
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:44,130
but foundationally week maybe psyche 
stamina,

273
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:49,321
all those things.
First World War Germany a little bit 

274
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:53,681
more controlled,
although they're a big gambling army 

275
00:14:53,681 --> 00:14:56,720
too.
They remind me a lot more.

276
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,630
Have a boxer like Joe Lewis,
the heavyweight champion of the world in

277
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,100
the 19 thirties,
19 forties,

278
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:08,101
and end of the 19 fifties.
Louis was a fantastic puncher to a 

279
00:15:08,101 --> 00:15:08,101
killer,

280
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,440
but a little bit more defensive,
more careful plotting was the way 

281
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,790
Muhammad Ali described him,
but that's a little unfair,

282
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,030
but they're not as wild as the second 
world war.

283
00:15:19,031 --> 00:15:24,031
Tyson ask one.
They too can knock out opponents and 

284
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:29,170
they do with regularity in the first 
world war,

285
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:33,100
but the difference is is that their 
foundation is much more solid.

286
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:39,240
They're much more stable and they can 
take you into the later rounds and knock

287
00:15:39,241 --> 00:15:44,241
you out.
Remember the Second World War was 

288
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:47,600
essentially over in terms of knowing the
outcome by about mid 1943.

289
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,450
That's two years before the war against 
Germany ended,

290
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,200
but everyone knew the Germans weren't 
winning anything two years earlier,

291
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,760
so Tyson is defeated.
It just is uncertain which round he will

292
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:03,190
actually be knocked out in.
Whereas in the first world war,

293
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:08,670
you know the Joe Lewis First World War,
German military is still throwing 

294
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,000
potential knockout blows in the last 
year of the war.

295
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,880
I don't know what value I put on this,
but let's note that the German army that

296
00:16:17,921 --> 00:16:22,921
went to war in 1914 is an undefeated 
force and going back almost to Napoleon 

297
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,930
they trace and almost unbroken string of
victories.

298
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,500
Whereas the army in the second world war
is literally and figuratively the child 

299
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:33,660
of defeat,

300
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,210
the rank and file soldiers likely to 
have had a father who fought,

301
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:43,270
maybe died,
maybe grievously wounded in the first 

302
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,650
world war,
the upper echelons of the officer corps,

303
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:50,060
uh,
almost to a man first world war 

304
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,630
veterans.
And of course the totalitarian leader at

305
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:55,631
the apex of the leadership pyramid.
Hitler himself was a corporal in the 

306
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:59,741
trenches.
How much did that defeat and seeing what

307
00:16:59,761 --> 00:17:04,761
they saw in that war changed them?
I don't know that you could ever put a 

308
00:17:04,761 --> 00:17:08,991
number on it.
I will just say if you have to boxing 

309
00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:09,210
champions facing each other and one is 
undefeated and the other,

310
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:13,090
isn't there something that helps the 
undefeated fighter?

311
00:17:13,091 --> 00:17:16,050
It may be different person to person and
I couldn't tell you how much and in what

312
00:17:16,051 --> 00:17:19,050
way,
but everyone notices it and acknowledges

313
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:20,820
it.
I would say the same is true here,

314
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:26,450
but that's hard to make a case if I'm 
standing up here as a lawyer 

315
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,901
representing this point of view,
so let me represented in a way that 

316
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:31,950
maybe I can pull some evidence together 
and convince you.

317
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Let's start with the army's themselves 
as opposed to the navy's the air forces 

318
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:38,500
in the rest.

319
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,160
Both these armies were very similar to 
each other,

320
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:47,030
so you have to kind of compare the 
things that are different about them.

321
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:52,390
Both of these armies have at core,
the magnificent German fighting soldier 

322
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,160
at the squad level,

323
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,700
trying to figure out what makes them as 
good as they are.

324
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,530
A very hard to measure.
I remember Neil Ferguson in his book,

325
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:07,531
a pity of war,
tries to break it down to some sort of 

326
00:18:07,531 --> 00:18:07,531
chart,
you know,

327
00:18:07,531 --> 00:18:08,540
how much more deadly are the German 
soldiers then,

328
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,330
you know,
soldiery of other countries.

329
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,030
But remember,
it's a lot of things working together.

330
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,440
Uh,
and a lot of things that the German 

331
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:18,440
military had been good at for a long 
time.

332
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:18,440
Discipline,
drill,

333
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,830
obedience,
tactical efficiency coordination between

334
00:18:20,831 --> 00:18:22,000
various arms,
et Cetera,

335
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:27,001
et cetera.
The same adjectives that are used about 

336
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:30,481
the German soldiers in both world wars 
are adjectives that are used to describe

337
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,360
Frederick degrades mid 18th century,
Prussian troops and the and the German 

338
00:18:36,761 --> 00:18:41,761
military tradition of both world wars is
one that can be traced back easily to 

339
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:42,460
Frederick,
the grades,

340
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:47,470
Prussia,
some people like to go a lot earlier 

341
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,371
than that,
but it's easy to look at the military 

342
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:52,771
traditions of of 18th century Prussia 
and see those infused into 20th century 

343
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:56,110
German armies and so they're comparable 
at the soldier level.

344
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,230
There are also comparable in terms of 
their tactical equipment.

345
00:18:59,231 --> 00:19:01,060
I mean you look at like,
okay,

346
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:02,770
what were the rifles like?
What were the machine gun?

347
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,710
All this stuff is predictably very good 
in the German army.

348
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:11,460
The artillery was good.
All these things are pretty much the 

349
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:11,460
same.
So when you try to figure out what would

350
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,381
make one less strong than the other,
you look at the underpinnings and in 

351
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:20,101
this case,
I try to imagine the German army in the 

352
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,060
Second World War without Nazis.

353
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,390
If you take the Nazis out of the Second 
World War,

354
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:28,850
German army,
it instantly gets better.

355
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,900
Then I think you could compare the two.
I still think I'd go first world war 

356
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,250
better because of the underpinnings of 
the state being much more old and strong

357
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,980
like a well constructed building.
You know,

358
00:19:39,981 --> 00:19:41,510
whatever happens.
The Second World War,

359
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:44,630
German military is a rickety,
hastily thrown up structure.

360
00:19:44,631 --> 00:19:47,300
If you're talking about the economy that
supports it,

361
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,900
every World War II buff knows that the 
people who were trying to build up the 

362
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,520
stockpile of weaponry and whatnot did 
not want to go to war.

363
00:19:56,521 --> 00:20:01,521
As early as 1939,
Adam two's points out the economic 

364
00:20:01,521 --> 00:20:05,460
realities that made Hitler decided not 
to wait until the equipment and all that

365
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:08,010
was ready for that good reasoning of 
both sides.

366
00:20:08,011 --> 00:20:13,011
Believe it or not,
but I'm going to hang my hat on the idea

367
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:20,270
that the fact that the Second World War 
German military is infested and run by 

368
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:24,330
Nazis is what makes it inferior to the 
first world war military.

369
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:27,300
So let's start with why this would 
matter at all.

370
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:33,230
And the basic answer that covers most of
these bases is that the ideological 

371
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:36,990
question now becomes at least as 
important,

372
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:41,991
and I think you can easily make the 
argument more important than the 

373
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:41,991
question of merit

374
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,840
or technical expertise.

375
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,390
Once ideology becomes more important 
than merit,

376
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:54,870
and once the Nazis begin to place people
in positions all up and down the 

377
00:20:56,231 --> 00:21:00,910
leadership tree from top to bottom,
just like Stalin did in his system,

378
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:06,450
then you begin to see the impact of 
people that are less competent on the 

379
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:09,310
system.
People that never would have gotten jobs

380
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:14,200
in first World War Germany because there
would have been much better than they to

381
00:21:14,201 --> 00:21:19,201
occupy those positions are getting work 
in Second World War Germany and it 

382
00:21:19,201 --> 00:21:19,480
degrades everything.
In fact,

383
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,590
let's look at the guy.
To me this.

384
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,600
This is the person who proves the rule.
He's just maybe the highest ranking 

385
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,200
competent official,
unless of course you include Hitler 

386
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,200
himself.
There are still,

387
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,751
by the way,
those people who consider Hitler some 

388
00:21:36,751 --> 00:21:37,630
sort of military genius.
I would make the case,

389
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:42,631
and maybe this is a question for another
show that if you had Hitler transported 

390
00:21:42,631 --> 00:21:47,371
back to the deliberations of the first 
World War German general staff and 

391
00:21:47,371 --> 00:21:49,420
there's only 20 people that can fit in 
the room.

392
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,420
They're having this discussion in and 
they're only going to let the 20 best 

393
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,901
strategist in the room.
I don't think Hitler gets anywhere near 

394
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:57,901
the front of the line to even get in the
room.

395
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,760
But let's not talk about him.
Let's talk about his second in command.

396
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:09,040
A guy who is.
He's in charge of,

397
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:14,070
maybe you could say the most 
disappointing underperforming wing of 

398
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:19,261
the German military and the one that 
probably was most responsible for a lot 

399
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:24,751
of the problems because you know,
they put a lot of weight and a lot of 

400
00:22:24,751 --> 00:22:27,850
resources into the German air force and 
then they handed those resources,

401
00:22:27,851 --> 00:22:32,851
that responsibility and the weight of 
the war in so many areas and put it on 

402
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:37,771
the shoulders of Hermann goring.
A guy who was so incompetent at his job 

403
00:22:38,981 --> 00:22:43,981
at one point that if you were sending 
out commandos from the allied side,

404
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:48,610
hit teams to take out German leadership,
you would specifically want to make sure

405
00:22:48,611 --> 00:22:53,611
you did not shoot Hermann goring because
he's one of the best things that ever 

406
00:22:53,611 --> 00:22:57,451
happened to the allied war effort 
because he was incompetent and he would 

407
00:22:57,451 --> 00:22:58,690
not have had that job in the first world
war system.

408
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,900
Now let's understand something.
The first world war system had it's own 

409
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:03,900
problem with nepotism,
were not forgiving them.

410
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,600
They're part of that tradition of blue 
blooded aristocracy.

411
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:12,601
Right?
And you'll look at the nominal 

412
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:15,001
commanders have a lot of the first world
war armies on the German side and their 

413
00:23:15,001 --> 00:23:17,911
prints this and crown prince that and 
some of those guys were decent generals 

414
00:23:17,911 --> 00:23:21,721
by the way,
but you'll notice that for the ones who 

415
00:23:21,721 --> 00:23:24,991
weren't,
the German military was extremely adept 

416
00:23:24,991 --> 00:23:28,690
at walling off their ability to 
negatively impact things too much.

417
00:23:28,691 --> 00:23:31,420
And the best example of that,
of course at all,

418
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:36,930
is how the military dictatorship of 
Germany were able to sort of isolate and

419
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:42,040
quarantine the Kaiser himself,
the imperial war,

420
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,250
Lord of Germany,
or you know,

421
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,040
sit in the corner,
play with your maps and your ships.

422
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,940
We have a war to conduct and they did.

423
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,210
Who's going to do that in the Second 
World War?

424
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,240
Who's going to coordinate off Hitler and
Quarantine Hitler from his bad decisions

425
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:57,440
being transmitted to the military?
Nobody.

426
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:02,470
Because it's an ideological state and 
the ideology plays as larger role or a 

427
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:05,690
larger role in everything.
And ideology by the way,

428
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,930
is absolutely key for understanding the 
Second World War at all.

429
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,420
Adam two's,
the wonderful economic historian,

430
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:14,150
makes these wonderful points in his 
book,

431
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:15,500
and I'll have to quote a little bit of 
it,

432
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:20,501
but he points out essentially.
And it occurred to me when I read the 

433
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:20,501
lines,
I'm like,

434
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:20,501
oh,
this is wild.

435
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,910
Basically my words put in his mouth,
you know,

436
00:24:23,911 --> 00:24:28,911
it's the question is what would happen 
if a major nation state got taken over 

437
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:32,861
by a,
by a leader who was a fanatical 

438
00:24:32,861 --> 00:24:34,940
conspiracy theorist.
And saw the world strictly through their

439
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:38,840
conspiracy lens and then acted upon.
You know,

440
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:39,920
what they thought they saw.

441
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,920
For example,
let's imagine that the person running a 

442
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,741
major nation state believes that aliens 
from outer space had been controlling 

443
00:24:47,741 --> 00:24:52,630
nations and world leaders for 100 years.
And when they get into power and they 

444
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,800
start acting as if that's what's really 
going on,

445
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:59,801
right?
We don't base our decisions on what 

446
00:24:59,801 --> 00:24:59,801
these countries say.
They're puppets for the aliens.

447
00:24:59,801 --> 00:24:59,801
It's Kooky,
isn't it?

448
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,660
But you know,
to reminded me something we all know,

449
00:25:02,661 --> 00:25:07,661
but we tend to forget,
especially we war gamers will sit down 

450
00:25:07,661 --> 00:25:09,260
there and we're thinking about this tank
and that gun and you forget the ideology

451
00:25:09,261 --> 00:25:11,990
that that's pushing these armies forward
to begin with.

452
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,630
Hitler is a fanatical conspiracy 
theorist,

453
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,680
but he's not thinking of space aliens.
He's thinking of Jews running the world.

454
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,410
And there's a tendency to think yes 
asked,

455
00:25:22,411 --> 00:25:23,180
she asked,
but you know,

456
00:25:23,181 --> 00:25:24,920
these other things matter until you 
realize that,

457
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,100
and this is what was so good at in his 
2006 work,

458
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:29,210
the wages of destruction.

459
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,570
I mean,
you have to understand that it explained

460
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:35,990
so much of the crazy stuff that they did
because when I was growing up,

461
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,660
this was still the end of the era.
We're in the United States.

462
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:43,830
The classic thing to say about Hitler 
was that he was crazy and then you'd 

463
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,390
read about what they would do and they 
would go,

464
00:25:44,391 --> 00:25:45,140
yeah,
that's crazy.

465
00:25:45,141 --> 00:25:46,880
Only crazy man would do that.
Well,

466
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:51,910
two's points out that only if you 
consider these fanatical conspiracy 

467
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:52,460
theorists to be crazy,
would that work?

468
00:25:52,461 --> 00:25:57,461
Because Hitler's got a logical plan and 
is actually acting logically,

469
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,400
but only if you're able to see things 
through that same fanatical conspiracy 

470
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:06,500
theorist lens he's looking at,
for example,

471
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:11,950
the classic stupid maneuver of the 
Hitlarian regime in the Second World 

472
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,130
War.
Was there anything worse?

473
00:26:13,131 --> 00:26:14,720
Everybody always likes to say attacking 
Russia,

474
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:19,721
which was bad,
but remember when Hitler was already at 

475
00:26:19,721 --> 00:26:24,341
war with Britain and Russia,
he then declared war on the United 

476
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:25,250
States.

477
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:30,050
The United States didn't declare war on 
Germany first and there's a great.

478
00:26:30,051 --> 00:26:35,051
What if scenario that some people play 
with about what would have happened if 

479
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:38,831
Hitler hadn't declared war on the United
States at all because there was still a 

480
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:42,971
lot of isolationist in the US.
A lot of people that would not have 

481
00:26:42,971 --> 00:26:43,230
wanted to go to war with Germany would 
have been able say,

482
00:26:43,231 --> 00:26:48,231
hey,
they didn't do anything to us or at the 

483
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:48,231
Japanese bombed us,
but the Germans didn't.

484
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:52,310
Interesting counterfactual to play with 
their kettler takes it right out of 

485
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,550
everyone's hands and declares war on the
United States,

486
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:55,530
and when I was younger,
you just thought crazy,

487
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:02,250
but his points out,
Adam points out that not if you see the 

488
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:06,811
world controlled by a cabal of Jews who 
use whole nation states is they're 

489
00:27:08,471 --> 00:27:11,680
puppets to do their bidding.
One of the great,

490
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:16,980
weird ironies of Nazi-ism is that Hitler
saw Stalin's Soviet Union as a Jewish 

491
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,390
Bolshevik Communist.
In his mind,

492
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,340
communism is Judaism.
They're mixed up.

493
00:27:24,341 --> 00:27:25,150
I mean,
it's all the same,

494
00:27:25,151 --> 00:27:30,151
right?
So that's a main Jewish stronghold to 

495
00:27:30,151 --> 00:27:32,401
Hitler.
But Hitler also thinks that the United 

496
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:37,290
States,
because it's democracy and freedom and 

497
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,020
capitalism,
is also somehow a sign of Jewishness,

498
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,960
that that's also another one of these 
Jewish puppets.

499
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:46,590
If you're fighting Jews and not nation 
states will then declaring war on the 

500
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:52,860
United States if you think they're this 
Jewish puppet all of a sudden makes 

501
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,211
sense.
And what two's kind of woke me up to is 

502
00:27:56,211 --> 00:27:58,540
that if you're operating with this 
conspiracy theory as your guide,

503
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,760
yeah,
the United States is just another one of

504
00:28:00,761 --> 00:28:04,890
these alien controlled countries that 
the space aliens are using against us.

505
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,610
You might as well go after him.
Now,

506
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,950
here's the way Adam two's encourages us 
to think about,

507
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:16,660
you know,
the way that these Nazis worldview 

508
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:16,660
explains a lot

509
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:17,770
quote,

510
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:23,420
President Roosevelt was identified as 
the chief agent of a worldwide Jewish 

511
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,490
conspiracy bent on the destruction of 
national socialist Germany.

512
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,760
It was no coincidence that Hitler's 
famous threat of annihilation of 30th 

513
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,541
January 1939 came as a direct response 
to Roosevelt state of the Union address.

514
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,040
The United States,
as everyone understood,

515
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,800
was the key to deciding the balance of 
the arms race.

516
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,950
It Britain and France could count firmly
on American aid.

517
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,480
Their position would be well nigh 
unassailable,

518
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,100
but the position of the United States 
was precariously balanced.

519
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:55,340
Whilst Roosevelt led the rhetorical 
assault against Hitler and encouraged 

520
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:55,340
Britain,
France,

521
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:59,811
and Poland in their resistance to Nazi 
expansionism isolationist currents in 

522
00:28:59,811 --> 00:29:01,110
the United States.
We're still strong.

523
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:03,510
Hitler in the rest of the Nazi 
leadership.

524
00:29:03,511 --> 00:29:08,511
He writes,
could not help but interpret this 

525
00:29:08,511 --> 00:29:10,440
complex situation through the dark haze 
of Manichaean antisemitism.

526
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:15,740
For them,
it was obvious that it was Jewish 

527
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,201
elements in Washington,
London and Paris bent implacably on the 

528
00:29:18,201 --> 00:29:21,981
destruction of Nazi Germany,
that we're tightening the international 

529
00:29:21,981 --> 00:29:25,191
encirclement and it was this paranoid 
sense of menace that precipitated 

530
00:29:25,191 --> 00:29:29,121
Hitler's decision to launch a strike 
against Poland and then against the 

531
00:29:29,121 --> 00:29:32,310
Western coalition that continued to 
stand obstinately in his way and quote,

532
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,130
if you wanted to say,
you know what?

533
00:29:36,131 --> 00:29:41,080
The Germans in both world wars did 
poorly because they were tactically.

534
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,680
Most of the time it was the grand 
strategy stuff.

535
00:29:44,681 --> 00:29:49,681
It was deciding for example,
which countries to go to war with and 

536
00:29:49,681 --> 00:29:53,071
which wars to fight or not to fight.
That they really screwed up in and in 

537
00:29:53,071 --> 00:29:57,181
the Second World War,
the reason for declaring wars and 

538
00:29:57,181 --> 00:29:59,740
accruing more and more enemies was 
ideologically based.

539
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,370
Right?
So the doom of the German military,

540
00:30:03,371 --> 00:30:06,280
no matter how good it might have been on
the battlefield,

541
00:30:06,281 --> 00:30:11,281
was sealed by the politicians who put 
them in wars that no one could hope to 

542
00:30:11,281 --> 00:30:15,511
win,
but that's getting a little off the 

543
00:30:15,511 --> 00:30:20,201
subject.
Let's talk about how the Nazis made the 

544
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:24,551
German army weaker in the Second World 
War and the difference that you would 

545
00:30:24,551 --> 00:30:25,580
have had in a system like the first 
World War Germany,

546
00:30:25,581 --> 00:30:28,160
that was more merit based.
You can't say it was merit based,

547
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:33,161
but more merit based.
Start with the idea that you have all 

548
00:30:33,161 --> 00:30:36,191
these Nazis in key positions that are 
incompetent or untrained or non expert.

549
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,620
This is not,
by the way a bug.

550
00:30:39,621 --> 00:30:44,621
This is a feature as Hitler sees it.
There are lots of critiques.

551
00:30:45,751 --> 00:30:48,300
One could pull off the shelf.
How about,

552
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:53,830
and again,
all of these people have access to 

553
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,671
grind,
so take everything that these ex Nazi 

554
00:30:55,671 --> 00:30:55,671
people,
right?

555
00:30:55,671 --> 00:30:58,620
With a grain of salt,
but in his famous book,

556
00:30:58,621 --> 00:31:00,720
inside the Third Reich,
which may be,

557
00:31:00,721 --> 00:31:05,721
I'm not sure,
maybe the closest account you'll ever 

558
00:31:05,721 --> 00:31:06,300
get of the Nazi situation

559
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,370
originally his architect,
but then the minister of armaments,

560
00:31:10,371 --> 00:31:14,060
Albert Speer wrote his memoirs after the
war and when you read them,

561
00:31:14,061 --> 00:31:19,061
he'll say things.
It's like reading churchill stuff 

562
00:31:19,061 --> 00:31:19,061
because instead of saying they said,
and then they said it's,

563
00:31:19,061 --> 00:31:19,790
I said,
and then he said,

564
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:22,160
and a lot of the he says is Hitler.
Um,

565
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,270
so in Albert speer,
his book,

566
00:31:23,271 --> 00:31:28,271
he talks about Hitler's tendency to put 
people in positions of authority and 

567
00:31:29,751 --> 00:31:34,751
great importance in the survival of the 
state who had never done anything like 

568
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,680
what their jobs were going to require in
the past,

569
00:31:36,681 --> 00:31:38,240
including spear himself.
Right?

570
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:43,241
A guy who had become Hitler's friend 
because he was an architect who was 

571
00:31:43,241 --> 00:31:45,320
going to design Hitler's new Berlin.
And Hitler takes a liking to him and all

572
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:46,850
of a sudden tells the architect,
yeah,

573
00:31:46,851 --> 00:31:47,780
you're going to be the,
uh,

574
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,290
the armaments minister with no 
experience at all.

575
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:56,290
Here's the way spirit described it.
Quote one can only wonder at the 

576
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:00,041
recklessness and the frivolity with 
which Hitler appointed me to one of 

577
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:03,680
those three or four ministries on which 
the existence of estate depended.

578
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,040
I was a complete outsider to the army,
to the party,

579
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,760
and to industry,
never in my life had anything to do with

580
00:32:10,761 --> 00:32:12,320
military weapons,
for.

581
00:32:12,321 --> 00:32:15,650
I'd never been a soldier.
And up to the time of my appointment had

582
00:32:15,651 --> 00:32:20,651
never even used a rifle as a hunter to 
be sure it was in keeping with Hitler's 

583
00:32:20,651 --> 00:32:25,190
dilettantism that he preferred to choose
nonspecialists as his associates.

584
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,640
After all,
he'd already appointed a wine salesmen,

585
00:32:28,641 --> 00:32:31,790
as his foreign minister is party 
philosopher as,

586
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:36,791
as minister for eastern affairs and an 
erstwhile fighter pilot as overseer of 

587
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:38,330
the entire economy.
Now,

588
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:42,380
he was picking an of all people to be 
his minister of armaments.

589
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:48,010
Undoubtedly Hitler preferred to fill 
positions of leadership with layman all 

590
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:52,391
his life.
He'd respected but distrusted 

591
00:32:52,391 --> 00:32:54,761
professionals.
And to quote any names or professional 

592
00:32:54,761 --> 00:32:54,890
how marsh locked,
who was fantastic.

593
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:55,880
And,
um,

594
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,760
a perfect example of the kinds of 
people,

595
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,430
um,
that were merit based.

596
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:08,340
Now,
the perfect example that should prove 

597
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,471
the rule of what a spear was just saying
was the guy who was second in command in

598
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,940
the Nazi regime,
the famous Hermann goring,

599
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,470
head of the Luftwaffe,
a right,

600
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:21,880
arguably the most underperforming branch
of the German military

601
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,540
goring story of course,
is fascinating.

602
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:30,541
He was a dashing,
handsome fighter pilot in the first 

603
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,320
World War,
shall we say,

604
00:33:32,321 --> 00:33:37,140
gone to seed by the second between the 
wars.

605
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:42,141
He was one of Hitler's comrades,
took a bullet in the groin area during 

606
00:33:42,141 --> 00:33:46,701
the early Nazi marches.
The pain of that was what was blamed on 

607
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:51,441
him becoming a morphine opioid addict.
And,

608
00:33:51,481 --> 00:33:52,950
um,
I love the way,

609
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:58,270
uh,
the great tank General Hind Scuderi in 

610
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:01,550
describes a goring.
You have to understand another thing 

611
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:01,980
that made that the Nazi state so much 
weaker,

612
00:34:01,981 --> 00:34:06,981
I think,
than the first World War state is the 

613
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:07,200
Nazi state was full of,
of the most.

614
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:08,670
I mean,
it was like,

615
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,470
you know,
if Hitler is Taylor Swift,

616
00:34:10,471 --> 00:34:11,340
sorry,
Taylor Swift,

617
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,060
uh,
his,

618
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,400
his little gang,
his entourage,

619
00:34:14,401 --> 00:34:18,810
we were a bunch of backbiting.
I you can't even describe the drama,

620
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:24,660
but hind spewed Arion describes goring 
and he's just the most one.

621
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:27,820
The Nazis are the most in the 20th 
century.

622
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,320
Perverse,
wonderful,

623
00:34:29,321 --> 00:34:30,640
colorful,
awful.

624
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,310
I mean you can't even the adjectives are
not even there.

625
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,140
Here's what hines good Erin writes 
about,

626
00:34:35,141 --> 00:34:38,170
goring who's in charge of the German air
force,

627
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:43,380
the arm that is receiving an inordinate 
amount of the state's resources because 

628
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:47,491
it's seen as this cutting edge thing 
that can win you the war and then it's 

629
00:34:47,491 --> 00:34:48,880
going to underperform time and time 
again.

630
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:52,240
Here's what one of the great tank 
theorists of all time,

631
00:34:52,241 --> 00:34:55,570
General Heinz good area and wrote in 
this post war memoirs of Goring,

632
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,460
and you can just feel,
well,

633
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,060
I'm not even sure what the emotion is.
It's dripping off the page.

634
00:35:01,061 --> 00:35:02,320
You tell me.
He writes,

635
00:35:02,321 --> 00:35:04,230
quote,
once,

636
00:35:04,231 --> 00:35:08,490
however goring had seen the young German
air force through its teething troubles,

637
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,450
he surrendered more and more to the 
charms of newly one power.

638
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,620
He adopted a futile manner of life,
collecting decorations,

639
00:35:16,621 --> 00:35:21,621
precious stones and antiques,
building his famous country seat Karen 

640
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:26,750
Hall,
concentrating with visible results on 

641
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,330
the joys of the table.
That just means he's getting fat.

642
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,440
He continues on one occasion while sunk 
in contemplation of old pictures in an 

643
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,560
east,
Prussia and castle,

644
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,100
he suddenly cried out.
This is goring magnificent.

645
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,060
I too am a man of the renaissance.
I adore splendor,

646
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,760
good area,
and continues quote.

647
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:50,190
His style of dress grew ever more 
eccentric at Karen Hall or while 

648
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:54,721
hunting,
he adopted the costume of the ancient 

649
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:56,800
two tons and went on duty.
His uniform was always unorthodox.

650
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:01,330
He either wore red boots of Russian 
leather with Golden Spurs,

651
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,480
an item of dress scarcely essential to 
an aviator or else he would appear at 

652
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,390
Hitler's conferences in long trousers 
and black patent leather pumps.

653
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,510
He was strongly scented and he painted 
his face.

654
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:18,840
His fingers were covered with heavy 
rings in which were set the many large 

655
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,410
gems that he loved to display and quote

656
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:27,210
Kadarian taking a shot at going there 
for a perhaps a little cross dressing 

657
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,400
goes a little beyond the metrosexual 
probably,

658
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,140
but at the same time,
you know,

659
00:36:32,141 --> 00:36:37,141
that's just one of the wonderful 
hypocrisy of the Nazis is that they 

660
00:36:37,141 --> 00:36:40,111
always had a strain of people doing 
things like that and there's nothing 

661
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:43,261
wrong with that unless of course you 
hypocritically make them one of the top 

662
00:36:43,261 --> 00:36:44,320
targets that you send to your 
concentration camps.

663
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:49,620
The Nazis were extremely hard on sexual 
minorities and the fact that they have 

664
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:53,560
people in them that probably could have 
passed for some just makes it extra,

665
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,770
as I said,
hypocritical.

666
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,630
Now once again,
you think,

667
00:36:59,631 --> 00:37:01,430
well,
what does this have to do with the army?

668
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:06,530
Right?
This isn't a guy in the field with the 

669
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:06,530
weapon,
but it is.

670
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,240
They're all interconnected in ways that 
you can't separate.

671
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:13,540
So for example,
when Albert speer gives an account of 

672
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:18,230
Hermann goring shouting down a German 
general who was explaining to him really

673
00:37:18,231 --> 00:37:21,170
important things that will affect what 
happens to the German army,

674
00:37:21,171 --> 00:37:23,210
which will affect what happens on the 
battlefield.

675
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,770
Spear writes,
quote,

676
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,400
I took part in a session with goring in 
the course of which General Thomas 

677
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,690
expressed his anxieties about the vast 
demands the leadership was making upon 

678
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:37,400
the economy.
Goring answered the respected general by

679
00:37:37,401 --> 00:37:41,090
roaring Adam quote,
what business is that of yours?

680
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:46,270
I'm handling that I am.
Do you hear or are you by any chance in 

681
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:49,190
charge of the four year plan you have 
nothing to say in this matter.

682
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:52,310
The fewer has entrusted all those 
questions to me alone.

683
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,110
End Quote.
Spear says,

684
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:01,140
quote in such disputes,
General Thomas could expect no support 

685
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:05,011
from his chief General Keitel,
who was only too glad to escape being 

686
00:38:05,011 --> 00:38:08,971
bullied by goring.
The well-conceived economic plan of the 

687
00:38:08,971 --> 00:38:11,710
Armaments Office of the High Command of 
the armed forces was never carried out.

688
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,200
But as I had already realized by the 
end,

689
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:18,220
goring did nothing about these problems.
Whenever he did do anything,

690
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:23,340
he usually created total confusion since
he never took the trouble to work 

691
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:27,061
through the problems,
but made his decisions on the basis of 

692
00:38:27,061 --> 00:38:27,310
impulsive inspirations and quote

693
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:34,010
goring's one of these guys,
and you see this amongst a lot of the 

694
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:34,110
Nazi officials were theoretically on 
paper.

695
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:37,930
Goring is not a bad guy to run the air 
force.

696
00:38:37,931 --> 00:38:40,030
I mean with his qualifications.
The problem is,

697
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,950
is those qualifications were created at 
a time when goring was a different guy.

698
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,480
He's a hardcore addict by this time,
and his decisions concerning the 

699
00:38:53,801 --> 00:38:54,490
Luftwaffe,
uh,

700
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:59,510
are catastrophic if you're German mixed 
in with these Nazi officials put in 

701
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,260
place,
even in the army for ideological reasons

702
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:10,740
are hardcore professional merit based 
people in all these services who are 

703
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:15,601
horrified when his generals helmet,
forester set of goring quote.

704
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:21,460
I've seen the Reich's Marshall not off 
in mid conference.

705
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:26,610
For instance,
if the conferences went on too long and 

706
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:29,551
the morphine wore off,
that was the commander in chief of our 

707
00:39:29,551 --> 00:39:30,640
air force exclamation point.
End Quote.

708
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,320
So imagine this goring question up and 
down the chain of command and how much 

709
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:38,650
that affects everything.

710
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:43,650
And if you took those Nazi officials out
and put people that were more merit 

711
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:48,271
based,
let's not get utopian here from the 

712
00:39:48,271 --> 00:39:50,731
first world war sort of standards,
you'd have a better army in the Second 

713
00:39:50,731 --> 00:39:54,390
World War in my opinion.
So let's discuss some of the other 

714
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:54,700
things besides the Merritt question that
play into this.

715
00:39:54,701 --> 00:39:57,580
In my opinion,
as I'm making my case here,

716
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:03,060
the Nazi ideology of racial exclusion 
and superiority makes the army weaker.

717
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:11,790
If you go to or some of the German 
graveyards from the first World War in 

718
00:40:12,281 --> 00:40:17,281
France,
you will come across a every now and 

719
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:17,281
then,
but with regularity,

720
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:19,030
a German grave that has a star of David 
on it.

721
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:21,160
The reasons are obvious,
right?

722
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:26,050
That is a German Jew who fell in service
to his country,

723
00:40:26,051 --> 00:40:28,210
a patriotic Germans.
You have the time period.

724
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:32,740
They were everywhere from the rank and 
file soldiery to the,

725
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:36,250
uh,
scientist bankers,

726
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:38,710
industrialists,
business people.

727
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:39,730
Uh,
it's,

728
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:43,300
it's a long list of people who helped 
the German war effort in the first world

729
00:40:43,301 --> 00:40:45,490
war as loyal Germans,
you know,

730
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,670
to the Kaiser,
the Nazi ideology,

731
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:51,580
of course,
turns the state against those people.

732
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:54,520
And whereas you had good Germans helping
the state,

733
00:40:54,521 --> 00:40:58,030
now you have an enemy within the first 
thing that happens of course,

734
00:40:58,031 --> 00:41:03,031
as you see a brain drain,
and Albert Einstein will be just one of 

735
00:41:03,031 --> 00:41:04,300
the people who leaves Germany as times 
get tough.

736
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,310
He will famously come over to the United
States,

737
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,400
send that letter to President Roosevelt 
saying it might be possible to harness 

738
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:11,400
the power of the atom,
blah,

739
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:11,400
blah,
blah.

740
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,930
Right?
In the first world war,

741
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:19,290
Albert Einstein stays in Germany and 
worked his physics calculations for the 

742
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,320
Kaiser's regime.
Likely.

743
00:41:20,321 --> 00:41:23,020
Anyway.
Not only that,

744
00:41:23,021 --> 00:41:28,021
but now you have this people who 
would've been helping the war effort 

745
00:41:28,021 --> 00:41:28,390
that now you have to figure out how to 
at first get rid of.

746
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,360
And there was a balance of payment 
problems that was complicating matters.

747
00:41:31,361 --> 00:41:34,190
But by and large,
it just basically means at some point in

748
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,140
the war,
you look at a Germany that really,

749
00:41:36,141 --> 00:41:41,141
really,
really needs to allocate its resources 

750
00:41:41,141 --> 00:41:41,660
carefully and wisely and yet because of 
their ideology,

751
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:46,310
have to apportion a certain amount to 
wiping out this ethnic group.

752
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,630
Well,
one of many,

753
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:52,631
but the Jews most prominently.
And you had your Gypsies and you had 

754
00:41:52,631 --> 00:41:52,820
your poles and you had your Russians and
you had your.

755
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,680
I mean,
the list goes on and on and you had your

756
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:57,200
homosexuals,
you had your priest and all of them have

757
00:41:57,201 --> 00:42:01,610
to be warehoused and exploited and then 
killed.

758
00:42:01,611 --> 00:42:06,611
And I mean that takes resources from the
war effort and why are they doing that 

759
00:42:06,611 --> 00:42:06,611
again?
Oh yeah.

760
00:42:06,611 --> 00:42:10,840
Ideology.
Let's switch to what the ideology means 

761
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,931
in terms of your commanders.
Both World War saw the traditional high 

762
00:42:15,211 --> 00:42:19,740
standards of German general ship upheld 
great generals in both wars,

763
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:22,020
but in the first world war,
once again,

764
00:42:22,021 --> 00:42:24,990
if you did a good job commanding troops 
and you were a winner,

765
00:42:24,991 --> 00:42:26,370
you were commanding troops

766
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:32,010
in the Second World War.
How much the Nazis like you or feel that

767
00:42:32,181 --> 00:42:37,181
you are loyal to them plays a part in 
whether or not you get an important 

768
00:42:37,181 --> 00:42:41,141
role.
There were guys like Gudera and who we 

769
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:43,811
just quoted that were sometimes 
sidelined because they weren't 

770
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,170
ideologically supportive or pure enough.
And of course,

771
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:50,171
I mean,
we all know that a decent number of 

772
00:42:50,171 --> 00:42:50,171
German generals were killed by the 
regime,

773
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:52,030
the Desert Fox,
or when Rama,

774
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,690
one of their great ones,
right?

775
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:56,120
Patent thought he was one of the best 
ever.

776
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,400
What did they do to him?
They forced him to commit suicide.

777
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:02,210
Why?
Ideological problems again?

778
00:43:02,211 --> 00:43:05,210
So not only is it not merit based in 
some ways,

779
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:10,630
but if the people who do deserve those 
jobs don't conform to the ideology 

780
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,450
enough,
they're gone too.

781
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:15,750
That's another thing that's going to 
make the first World War German military

782
00:43:15,751 --> 00:43:16,770
better than the second.

783
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,510
Let's talk economics for a second.
Without getting too deeply into it,

784
00:43:21,511 --> 00:43:22,710
you wouldn't want me to.
Anyway,

785
00:43:22,711 --> 00:43:24,900
that's where I'll start making some 
mistakes.

786
00:43:24,901 --> 00:43:29,901
But by and large,
the Nazis had their own theories on 

787
00:43:29,901 --> 00:43:29,901
economics.
And this is well understood.

788
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:32,190
In the first world war,
they were more,

789
00:43:32,191 --> 00:43:35,520
shall we say,
Orthodox on their economics.

790
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:41,120
The Germans were very much in the second
world war and we described steroids 

791
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:41,730
earlier.
That's not a bad way to put it.

792
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:47,210
Uh,
leveraging their economy for the short 

793
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:50,031
term is another way to put it.
It's another reason why they were more 

794
00:43:50,031 --> 00:43:53,121
like Mike Tyson and they're front 
loading their power and if the fight 

795
00:43:53,121 --> 00:43:54,240
goes into the later rounds,
they in trouble and it did,

796
00:43:54,241 --> 00:43:59,241
and they were in the first world war 
with a better understanding of 

797
00:43:59,241 --> 00:44:03,801
economics,
smarter people at the helm who were not 

798
00:44:03,801 --> 00:44:06,141
blinded by ideology.
They did better with what they had 

799
00:44:06,141 --> 00:44:06,141
longer.

800
00:44:06,141 --> 00:44:11,130
Finally,
you look at how the ideology boxed the 

801
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:15,090
German government in the Second World 
War from any sort of outcome that wasn't

802
00:44:15,431 --> 00:44:20,431
a total catastrophe.
Take a look at the performances of the 

803
00:44:20,431 --> 00:44:23,830
two armies and what they did right?
The German army from the first world war

804
00:44:23,831 --> 00:44:28,831
from the Kaiser.
Those guys are fighting a two front war 

805
00:44:28,831 --> 00:44:32,940
from day one.
The worst nightmare of any central 

806
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:32,940
continental state,
right?

807
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,250
You have Russians in the east,
French and British in the West.

808
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:38,400
How do you deal with that?
Year by year,

809
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,330
the Germans in the first world war went 
around knocking out their enemies.

810
00:44:42,331 --> 00:44:44,460
I mean,
they knocked Russia out of the war.

811
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,220
How'd they do that?
Well,

812
00:44:47,221 --> 00:44:52,221
their plan was to hurt them and then go 
and get a settlement with them and take 

813
00:44:52,221 --> 00:44:53,760
as much of a deal as they could get.
Right?

814
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:55,260
They got one of the great treaties of 
all time.

815
00:44:55,261 --> 00:44:58,620
Breslow task right?
Famously in Germany's favor.

816
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,710
Why in Germany of the Second World War 
do that?

817
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:04,890
I mean they had a lot more going for 
them.

818
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,950
They didn't have to fight a two front 
war until 1943.

819
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:13,490
You're knock France out,
which they did with a Mike Tyson like 

820
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:18,220
spectacular knockout.
You're not fighting in any front war for

821
00:45:18,221 --> 00:45:23,221
a while.
Then you fight the Soviet Union without 

822
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,610
having to worry about anyone on your 
western flank there on the continent.

823
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:30,510
Perfect situation.
But by 1942 perhaps maybe 19,

824
00:45:30,581 --> 00:45:33,910
43,
you've lost on the eastern front and the

825
00:45:33,911 --> 00:45:36,400
second front is just opening up in 
Europe,

826
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:37,000
in Italy.

827
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:39,350
So you say,
well,

828
00:45:39,351 --> 00:45:44,351
why did the Germans cut their losses?
When you have all this territory in the 

829
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,110
Soviet Union?
Well,

830
00:45:45,111 --> 00:45:46,940
in the first world war,
that's when you make a deal,

831
00:45:46,941 --> 00:45:48,770
right?
You'd go to the Russians and you go,

832
00:45:48,771 --> 00:45:51,320
listen,
we all this territory of yours and we're

833
00:45:51,321 --> 00:45:52,880
going to stay here,
but I'll tell you what,

834
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,980
you give us a good peace deal.
We'll pull back a little.

835
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,110
You know,
you can negotiate from that,

836
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:02,140
right?
But the Nazis were hemmed in by their 

837
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:03,860
ideology.
They can't make a deal here.

838
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:05,930
This isn't a battle,
you know,

839
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:08,810
for the best deal we can get.
This is in Hitler's mind,

840
00:46:08,811 --> 00:46:13,130
a life or death struggle.
The plans that the Nazi leaders have for

841
00:46:13,131 --> 00:46:18,131
this area in the east requires them to 
move millions of people eastward,

842
00:46:18,681 --> 00:46:23,681
maybe have a starvation plan to start 
calling the numbers and then inserting 

843
00:46:23,681 --> 00:46:24,860
German farmers into this whole.

844
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,450
I mean,
the entire thing.

845
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:31,451
There is no plan b here.
There is no place for compromise and 

846
00:46:32,661 --> 00:46:36,200
what's more,
the extreme brutality,

847
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:39,500
Nazi racial superiority and the 
ideology,

848
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,370
um,
that pushed for a brutal campaign in the

849
00:46:43,371 --> 00:46:48,371
east pretty much made the people on the 
other side in no mood to be cutting any 

850
00:46:48,951 --> 00:46:51,980
deals with anyone.
Once again,

851
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:57,250
didn't have to be that way.
The German military is always tough on 

852
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:57,250
people throughout history,
right?

853
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:59,360
Remember Belgium in 1914,
you know they're,

854
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:04,420
they're.
They're not a lightweight army when it 

855
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:05,120
comes to justice ever,
but the crimes of the Nazis,

856
00:47:05,121 --> 00:47:10,121
because of the ideological question were
so much greater that there was nobody 

857
00:47:10,121 --> 00:47:14,921
willing to compromise,
so my opinion,

858
00:47:15,101 --> 00:47:20,101
you take the Nazis,
you pry the infestation out of the 

859
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:23,140
German military and all the influence 
that had had over the equipment,

860
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:24,550
tactics,
doctrine,

861
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:26,590
strategy and approach of the German 
military,

862
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:31,980
and you instantly get stronger.
You put the World War leadership and 

863
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:32,680
ideology.
You know what?

864
00:47:32,681 --> 00:47:37,681
There was,
it was an aristocratic kind of an 

865
00:47:37,681 --> 00:47:39,190
ideology in 19th century ideology,
but you put that in charge of the Second

866
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,090
World War German army and I bet it's 
better.

867
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:45,910
Let me end my attempt at making a case 
here by once again,

868
00:47:45,911 --> 00:47:50,911
turning to General Heinz Kadarian who 
was not afraid to go up to Hitler and 

869
00:47:52,481 --> 00:47:56,570
ask the kinds of questions that might 
get some people you know,

870
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,050
hanging from the end of a meat hook.
So it pretty gutsy.

871
00:47:59,051 --> 00:48:01,120
But of course,
we don't know if this really happened or

872
00:48:01,121 --> 00:48:02,680
not,
this is a man's memoirs,

873
00:48:02,681 --> 00:48:07,681
but he says that after he watched Hitler
basically yell in the face of goring 

874
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:09,840
that he was a disaster,
good area,

875
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,190
and walks up to him and says,
so why is he still here?

876
00:48:12,191 --> 00:48:13,000
He writes,
quote,

877
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:19,140
as a result of this conversation,
meaning the dressing down of Hermann 

878
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,291
goring,
I urged Hitler to act according to what 

879
00:48:22,291 --> 00:48:25,141
he now realized,
and to appoint some competent air force 

880
00:48:25,141 --> 00:48:25,990
general just exceed the Reich's 
Marshall.

881
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:31,110
I told him that we dare not risk losing 
the whole war on account of the 

882
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:33,730
incompetence of one man like goring,
but Hitler replied,

883
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:39,100
and this is Hitler talking,
and he's showing why the ideology 

884
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:39,370
trump's merit.
Hitler,

885
00:48:39,371 --> 00:48:41,320
according to God's Marion said,
quote,

886
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,320
for political reasons I cannot do as you
suggest,

887
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:48,400
the party would never understand my 
motives and quote.

888
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:54,780
So if you can't fire Hermann goring in 
1944 near the end of the war for 

889
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:59,791
political reasons,
well that might explain why your 

890
00:48:59,791 --> 00:49:02,860
military is less formidable than the 
first world war military right there.

891
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:08,250
Remember,
we didn't even mention the goring isn't 

892
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:08,650
just in charge of the German air force.
He's in charge of the German economy.

893
00:49:08,651 --> 00:49:13,651
When the four year plans going on,
you could make an argument that at least

894
00:49:13,691 --> 00:49:18,691
goring has a background in fighter 
aircraft and all that stuff because he 

895
00:49:18,691 --> 00:49:19,690
did,
but why would you put that guy in charge

896
00:49:19,691 --> 00:49:24,691
of the German economy and who is good 
enough even among the uber competent to 

897
00:49:24,791 --> 00:49:29,791
be in charge of both,
and of course we only chose Hermann 

898
00:49:29,791 --> 00:49:31,610
goring because he's the most obvious 
target,

899
00:49:31,611 --> 00:49:36,611
the tip of the iceberg.
The Nazis had people like this up and 

900
00:49:36,611 --> 00:49:39,110
down as we said,
the leadership chain mixed with a lot of

901
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:41,840
uber competent people.
We should point that out.

902
00:49:41,841 --> 00:49:46,841
Otherwise the Germans are not as 
formidable as they were in the Second 

903
00:49:46,841 --> 00:49:47,210
World War.
Lots of traditional German competency.

904
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,940
That's why I compare these Nazis to 
their war effort,

905
00:49:49,941 --> 00:49:53,690
like like some sort of parasite 
infestation,

906
00:49:53,691 --> 00:49:56,360
sucking some of the blood of competency 
out of them,

907
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:01,750
leaving them still very competent but 
weaker than they otherwise would be 

908
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:02,150
compared,
for example,

909
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,970
in my opinion,
to their first world war version.

910
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:10,900
Now in my account for brevity's sake,
not really my strong point,

911
00:50:10,901 --> 00:50:12,730
as you know,
I left out a lot of stuff.

912
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,460
We didn't even deal with things like the
navy,

913
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:16,930
you know,
in comparison,

914
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:18,610
first world war,
German navy,

915
00:50:18,611 --> 00:50:21,520
second most powerful navy in the world,
Second World War,

916
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:24,120
German navy,
nowhere near that.

917
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:27,740
I mean there's no comparison there.
And the air force,

918
00:50:27,741 --> 00:50:32,741
I mean,
let's remember to get back to goring 

919
00:50:32,741 --> 00:50:34,541
again.
This is an air force that continually 

920
00:50:34,541 --> 00:50:37,181
delayed the influx of new equipment in 
terms of new designs,

921
00:50:37,191 --> 00:50:39,350
which as we pointed out earlier,
is critical,

922
00:50:39,351 --> 00:50:44,351
right?
The technology changes during the war 

923
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:44,351
itself because they're changing things 
like,

924
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:48,791
well,
do we want this new jet to be a fighter 

925
00:50:48,791 --> 00:50:48,950
or a bomber or a fighter,
but I mean back and forth and every time

926
00:50:48,951 --> 00:50:53,951
they changed their mind as they lose 
months and months of production time 

927
00:50:53,951 --> 00:50:55,180
could have had jet aircraft years 
earlier,

928
00:50:55,181 --> 00:51:00,181
perhaps goring's the guy who told Hitler
to have his army stop and not annihilate

929
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:06,041
the British who,
who were trapped did dunkirk in 1940 

930
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:06,980
because the luftwaffe a wood finish them
off.

931
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:11,981
They didn't goring's the guy that said 
he could supply the encircled German 

932
00:51:11,981 --> 00:51:13,060
troops of Stalin Grad.
Don't worry,

933
00:51:13,061 --> 00:51:14,500
we'll do it by air.
Couldn't.

934
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:19,450
And you said you can't fire him in 1944.

935
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,160
Well,
to me,

936
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,080
in my opinion,
as I said,

937
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:28,620
that is exhibit a right there,
that the German first world war military

938
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:33,190
would have been in more formidable 
opponent to face in its day.

939
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:36,430
Then the Second World War German 
military was in its day.
