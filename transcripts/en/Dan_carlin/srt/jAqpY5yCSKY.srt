1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,590
What you're about to hear is part four 
of a multipart series on the first world

2
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:05,850
war,
if you like,

3
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:10,110
your stories to have some sort of 
cohesive linear narrative flow.

4
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:12,780
Although I'm not promising that I 
probably couldn't deliver on that,

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,840
but if that's what you like,
we're probably better off suggesting you

6
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:18,690
go check out episode number one and work
your way to hear.

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,850
If you don't care about that kind of 
stuff at all,

8
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:25,851
or you just don't trust me to deliver a 
cohesive linear narrative flow and I 

9
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:26,940
wouldn't blame you.
Well then by all means,

10
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:31,500
start here at part four and check out 
this series that we're calling blueprint

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,490
for Armageddon.

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,540
Be Bus seven,
19,

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,600
41,
a date which will live in infamy.

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,110
It's history.

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:48,740
Perfect.

16
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,080
The events

17
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,310
that dude figures from this time and 
place,

18
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,460
I take pride in the words,
been the Alina,

19
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,220
tear down,
complete collapse.

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,120
Welcome this kind of examination because
people have got to know whether or not 

21
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,150
the president said,
well,

22
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:38,151
I'm not a crop.
If we dig deep in our history and our 

23
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:38,850
doctrine,
I don't remember if we are not descended

24
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,400
from fearful of man,

25
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,380
it's hardcore history.
How do you market war,

26
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,700
how do you sell combat to the people who
are actually going to have to engage in 

27
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:05,560
it?
It's not a hypothetical question,

28
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:10,561
by the way.
Any military that requires volunteers to

29
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:15,940
decide they want to join the service has
to think about how you actually sell the

30
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:19,180
idea to the people who you know have to 
take part in it.

31
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:24,420
An idea that carries with it the 
potential for some very nasty outcomes 

32
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:26,800
in the very worst of circumstances,
doesn't it?

33
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:30,850
So difficult job perhaps to market 
combat.

34
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,610
It's easier to do in peace time though,
right?

35
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:37,510
If you have to sell Suntan oil to people
in Alaska,

36
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,320
you might be able to pull that off in 
the summer in December.

37
00:02:41,321 --> 00:02:45,400
It's a really tough sell before the 
first world war breaks out.

38
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,330
If you're trying to market recruitment 
into the British army,

39
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,000
you can sell the same sort of talking 
points,

40
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:57,010
the same soda angles that have worked 
for governments and monarchies and 

41
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:57,400
tribes.

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,170
Going back to the beginning of 
civilization,

43
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,230
the military has long had certain 
selling points.

44
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:07,290
I think we're all familiar with them.
You could add regular pay thrown in to 

45
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:10,240
that as well.
The heroism,

46
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,480
the adventure,
the status.

47
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:13,900
I mean,
you know,

48
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:16,390
there's a lot of things.
Some people just like to fight.

49
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:17,320
I mean,
you never know.

50
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,780
The problem is is that that's a pre 
1914,

51
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:28,540
you know,
talking point when it comes to what 

52
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,931
happens when the first world war breaks 
out and how that just totally messes 

53
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:35,821
with your marketing strategy.
Unless you're marketing hell as a travel

54
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:39,310
destination,
you can't,

55
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,890
no matter how much precedence or ship 
you have,

56
00:03:41,891 --> 00:03:43,810
and the British had plenty in the first 
world war,

57
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:48,811
just like everyone else,
you can't mask those kinds of casualty 

58
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:49,600
number.
Now you can mask the reality,

59
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:54,601
the sort of stuff that some of these 
newspaper reporters who were censored 

60
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:54,601
during the war,
after the war,

61
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,990
you know,
they would write books,

62
00:03:55,991 --> 00:04:00,991
telling you the real story,
what really happened because you 

63
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:00,991
couldn't have imagined it and it was all
censored by the press.

64
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,740
Even with the censorship,
you can't hide the death and destruction

65
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:10,741
and dismemberment and you see the people
returning to your hometown with the 

66
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:11,530
horrible wounds and you hear some of the
rumors and stories,

67
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,100
you know it's not going to be fun.
All of a sudden the marketers in Great 

68
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,870
Britain's recruitment operation have to 
play hard ball no more just throwing out

69
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:28,570
carrots they're going to use some sticks
to.

70
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,040
In the US.
We have a 21st century volunteer army 

71
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,201
ourselves and the US uses just carrots 
to encourage people to join up.

72
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,000
We'll pay you more.
We'll pay you for college.

73
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,920
You'll make something of your life.
I mean,

74
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:44,050
there's all these different things that 
they used to motivate people,

75
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:46,840
but there's not very many sticks in the 
US system.

76
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,950
Once the first couple of weeks of the 
first world war happened and everybody 

77
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,500
together finds out how enormous this is 
going to be an in an absolutely stunning

78
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:56,830
group.

79
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,680
Wake up call where the light goes on 
over everyone's head and they're going,

80
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,310
oh my gosh,
we don't have enough resources and oh my

81
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:08,311
gosh,
we don't have enough money for a war 

82
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:08,311
like this,
and Oh my gosh,

83
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:11,071
we don't have enough people,
and even some of these larger states 

84
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:11,350
where you think to yourself,
all you know,

85
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:13,750
people shouldn't be a problem.
Look at how many people are coming up.

86
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:18,070
Every generation.
Remember manpower in the old,

87
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,490
you know,
air quotes means manpower across the 

88
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,431
board.
Not just the people fighting on the 

89
00:05:26,431 --> 00:05:28,051
front line,
but the people that can still be minors 

90
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:31,351
to extract the material you need to 
carry on the war or people working in 

91
00:05:31,351 --> 00:05:36,240
arms manufacturing plants so that they 
can build the bombs you need to fight 

92
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,490
the war.
In other words,

93
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:39,490
if you take too much to throw on the 
fighting line,

94
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,940
you won't have enough people back home 
making the stuff that the people on the 

95
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:44,940
fighting line need to win.

96
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,140
Man,
power becomes a very big deal.

97
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,240
All these other countries in the war,
Germany,

98
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:49,840
France,
Russia,

99
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,850
no problem.
They've spent decades working out a 

100
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,360
conscription operation where they draft 
people,

101
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,200
you know,
you come of age,

102
00:05:57,201 --> 00:06:02,201
you do a couple of years in the service 
and then you become parts of the 

103
00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:04,781
reserves and then you become parts of 
the other reserve and the heavier and 

104
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,601
older reserve and you know,
after a while they've got a whole 

105
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:08,270
revolving self perpetuating system in 
place.

106
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:12,410
Whereas every generation comes up,
they're cranking out new soldiers except

107
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:17,411
for Great Britain there,
the last volunteer service in involved 

108
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:19,730
in this conflict.
When it breaks out,

109
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,760
it puts unique pressures on them.
The first thing they do is simply ask 

110
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:30,281
people to join up.
And remember in 1914 you didn't quite 

111
00:06:30,281 --> 00:06:33,041
know what you were in for.
You could still sell the old selling 

112
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:33,041
points.

113
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:33,110
The uniforms are wonderful and the 
women,

114
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,330
you'll look dashing and it just be,
you know,

115
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,240
I mean war adventure killed the Bosch,
you know,

116
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:40,190
all the good methods that king needs.
You,

117
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:45,250
king and country,
all the things that have always worked 

118
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:45,250
and still work by the way.
And a lot of cases,

119
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,170
especially in peace time.
Um,

120
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,280
worked in more folks in Britain.
And Scotland and Canada and Australia 

121
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,390
and all these places signed up than they
even could handle.

122
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,670
They were looking for a couple of 
hundred thousand,

123
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,700
got a lot more than that,
but that's before the casualties start 

124
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,110
happening.
A lot of patriotic Britain signup,

125
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,500
but you don't know how many patriotic 
Britain's journey you're going to need 

126
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,740
and not just in one big lump,
but every month to replace the troops.

127
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:12,530
You lose.
In late 1915,

128
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,560
the British just lose at Gullapalli and 
they walk away after a couple of months 

129
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:20,240
with 250,000
casualties.

130
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,650
You don't just replace those by playing 
nice and easy and saying,

131
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:28,070
come and fight for king and country.
You're using more hardball methods,

132
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,670
and one of the ones that I've always 
thought was just indicative of something

133
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:36,671
that if you imagined it in modern times,
it boggles the mind using a strategy 

134
00:07:36,671 --> 00:07:37,250
like this today,
but it's absolute genius.

135
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,080
It shows exactly the most vulnerable 
point in a young man's psyche.

136
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,260
I mean the place where if you're a 
marketer,

137
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:47,540
you're looking for,
for you know,

138
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,760
what motivates people,
how you can touch these,

139
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,350
these elements of influence in the order
of the feather.

140
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:57,860
The white feather movement is absolutely
brilliant in that regard.

141
00:07:57,861 --> 00:07:58,850
I mean,
it's almost devious.

142
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:03,851
You try to imagine our government doing 
something like this today with modern 

143
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:04,310
21st century technology.
It's interesting to think about,

144
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,620
but basically,
you know when August,

145
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:07,520
early September,
19,

146
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:12,521
14 rolls around,
there's an admiral in the British 

147
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:15,071
admiralty who's,
who's working like everyone else to 

148
00:08:15,071 --> 00:08:15,071
think about,
well,

149
00:08:15,071 --> 00:08:17,950
how can we encourage more people to sign
up for this horrible war and comes up 

150
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,660
with,
you know,

151
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:21,650
and an attack on a motivation,
a marketing strategy.

152
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:27,070
He's going to enlist patriotic young 
British women to walk the streets of all

153
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:29,600
these towns in Britain,
their hometowns.

154
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,620
You know,
where there are people they know and if 

155
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,341
they see men not in uniform,
who looked like they could be or should 

156
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:37,760
be,
they are going to go up,

157
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,810
surround this person and start saying 
the most horrible thing.

158
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:44,480
You are a coward and all these terrible 
things to them.

159
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:50,290
In know pretty women in public dressing 
you down if you're 18 years old,

160
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,780
that's a pretty good marketing chink in 
arm or to exploit,

161
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,640
not just that you're probably in.
Usually we're on the streets of your 

162
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,440
hometown where the pastors by no you or 
your family.

163
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,250
This is a profoundly embarrassing 
moment,

164
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,150
you know,
for,

165
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:11,550
for everyone around you,
everyone connected with you.

166
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:16,910
God forbid if you have a girlfriend,
she's gonna think this looks pretty bad 

167
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:16,910
for her too.
I mean,

168
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,730
the effect was,
was huge.

169
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,680
And then before this little group of 
women,

170
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,420
um,
we're done with you.

171
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,750
They would put a white feather 
signifying cowardice on your lapel or 

172
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:29,490
somewhere very visible,
you know,

173
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:30,240
on you.

174
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:37,140
This was not an unusual occurrence.
There are accounts for people that say 

175
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,611
they were afraid to go outside the house
sometimes because these patriotic and 

176
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:44,830
zealous women who were really just 
trying to help.

177
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,170
That's the funny part.
This is the society motivating,

178
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,520
patriotism,
all these things,

179
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:48,810
right?
It's,

180
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,040
it's all the right virtues.
But I've got an account from a 16 year 

181
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,831
old boy who had to go through this and 
then he signed up for the service 

182
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:03,571
because he was so deathly embarrassed 
and afraid and an inch and ashamed and 

183
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:05,230
the service person laughed him out of 
the room,

184
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:08,230
but then said he looked so downtrodden,
he exaggerated this height,

185
00:10:08,231 --> 00:10:09,340
exaggerated,
does age,

186
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:14,341
exaggerated his weight,
and he was in at 16 under 110 pounds on 

187
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:22,030
the western front.
It's absolutely deviously clever.

188
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,550
Once again,
I try to imagine us using it today.

189
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,510
You know,
these ideas could backfire though.

190
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,060
These creative marketing recruitment 
ideas,

191
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:36,450
for example,
the government felt the need to put out 

192
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,851
symbols that people could wear who had 
already done their service overseas and 

193
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:41,950
had been wounded and honorably 
discharged or who worked for some really

194
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:46,951
important armaments or war related 
industry and couldn't be spared because 

195
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:50,851
apparently enough of those people were 
being mistakenly given the order of the 

196
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:55,021
white feather treatment to make that an 
important thing for the government to 

197
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:58,471
do.
There were other creative marketing 

198
00:10:58,471 --> 00:10:58,690
plans,
not sticks but carrots and one of them,

199
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,390
another brilliant one.
When you think about it on the surface,

200
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:06,660
involve the British government 
explaining to recruits that if you sign 

201
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:06,660
up with your pals,
your buddies,

202
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:11,590
you could all serve together as well.
People joined up from the same street or

203
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:16,591
the same pub or the same community or 
the same fraternity or the same 

204
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:18,910
profession and they all serve together 
and they had wonderful names.

205
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,730
These are like military unit names that 
they're still known by.

206
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,880
I mean there were the Liverpool pals or 
the grimsby chums and these friends all 

207
00:11:27,491 --> 00:11:29,080
went to the service.
She figured if you've got to serve,

208
00:11:29,081 --> 00:11:30,370
you might as well do it with your 
friends,

209
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,950
but then you get to watch your friends 
die.

210
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,220
It's the part we didn't really consider 
when we signed up and it sounded kind of

211
00:11:36,221 --> 00:11:39,490
fun.
Not just that when these units would get

212
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,410
decimated in some of these terrible 
encounters.

213
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:43,720
For example,
you can be walking down a road with your

214
00:11:43,721 --> 00:11:47,890
pals in the open and all of a sudden get
caught by our Taylor refire,

215
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:53,070
suffer 80 percent casualties and then 
instead of the losses and the suffering 

216
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:58,260
and the grief being spread out,
sort of diluted across the width and 

217
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,820
breadth of the entire British isles or 
British empire for that matter,

218
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:06,210
some local community or some fraternity 
or some profession just gets pounded and

219
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:12,991
there are villages and towns in Britain 
now that had these terrible days just 

220
00:12:12,991 --> 00:12:17,791
happened to the whole community and 
pretty much everybody suffers a major 

221
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,151
loss one way or the other,
and if the downside of that clever 

222
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:23,911
marketing plan by 1916,
there's nothing clever enough to get 

223
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,150
enough people in uniform.

224
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:30,010
The losses are so high that the British 
finally do what the British really don't

225
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:32,860
do and they started conscripting their 
people.

226
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,930
It's hard to blame the British for 
starting the same sort of draft that the

227
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:40,870
continental great powers use.
All you have to do.

228
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:42,310
As we said,
the casualties were so high.

229
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:43,930
Look at the.
By the end of Nineteen 15,

230
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,030
the British have suffered half a million
casualties,

231
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,700
200,000
of those are dead by the way,

232
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:54,180
for a traditionally naval power who has 
traditionally are rather small army by 

233
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,980
continental standards.
Those are huge numbers.

234
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,880
Now you want to see what continental 
standards look like.

235
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,120
Look at the British ally,
the French who had a huge army in the 

236
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,960
meat grinder since the first minute of 
this whole affair,

237
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,230
and by the end of Nineteen 15 there 
casualties are over 2 million.

238
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,520
More than 700,000
of those are dead and all these great 

239
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,471
powers are looking at their principal 
enemies and trying to figure out how 

240
00:13:22,471 --> 00:13:24,940
close they are to the throwing in the 
towel moment.

241
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,360
The Germans are looking at the French 
and all the casualties they have 

242
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,611
suffered,
and then you're looking in their 

243
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:33,751
thinking.
They must be close to the end of their 

244
00:13:33,751 --> 00:13:36,601
rope.
The Germans have suffered more 

245
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:36,940
casualties by the end of 1915,
then the French,

246
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,920
but they're fighting on more fronts,
right?

247
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:40,480
They're fighting the French and the 
British in the west,

248
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:45,810
the gigantic Russian forces in the east 
and they're involved in the Balkans a 

249
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,320
lot.
In 1915 there,

250
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,590
casualties by the end of 1915 or over 
two and a half million,

251
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,450
about 750,000
of those are dead hard to know.

252
00:13:55,451 --> 00:14:00,040
The Germans list 250,000
missing in this war.

253
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:04,690
People got blown to bits.
They got covered up by a giant mountains

254
00:14:04,691 --> 00:14:06,670
of earth that Shell's had blown up in 
the air,

255
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:09,670
falling back on the ground.
A lot of missing people probably between

256
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:14,671
750 and 800,000
dead for the Germans at this point in 

257
00:14:14,671 --> 00:14:15,040
the war.

258
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:19,270
The Russians have suffered titanic 
losses from minute one.

259
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,750
They lost a huge battle in 1915 called 
um,

260
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,960
Gorley's tarnoff.
We're to least a ton off.

261
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:31,240
And that battle all by itself,
they lost 150,000

262
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,940
dead,
almost 700,000

263
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:37,120
wounded and basically a million 
prisoners.

264
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,680
Those titanic losses,
maybe it's easier to understand their 

265
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:48,030
monthly burn rate by October 1915.
The Russians are losing 235,000

266
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:52,550
men a month.
How sustainable is that?

267
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:57,551
You again,
you got to be looking at the Russians 

268
00:14:57,551 --> 00:14:58,280
thinking they're almost done and the 
German high command kind of is now.

269
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:02,300
The Germans can't be too happy though 
because their main ally,

270
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,690
the Austrian Hungarians are suffering 
casualties that are every bit as 

271
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,430
momentous as the Russians,
but they don't have the manpower to back

272
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:14,990
that up.
I mean in one four month period in 1915,

273
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:18,710
one four month period,
the Austrian suffer 750,000

274
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:20,270
casualties.
Boom.

275
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:26,380
That's in addition to the already 
astounding casualties they took in the 

276
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,160
few months right after the war started.

277
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,460
The Germans several times we'll have to 
prop up the Austrians just to keep them 

278
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,911
able to continue in the conflict and the
Austrians are a pain in the rear to 

279
00:15:36,911 --> 00:15:41,741
their German allies.
A lot of the time mean for Eric on 

280
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:42,920
Falcon and the German commander in 
charge in January of 1916.

281
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:47,921
He can't stand them.
They are always getting into some sort 

282
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:51,431
of disaster that they then go to Falcon 
Hein and ask for help getting out of and

283
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:54,740
to make matters worse,
it's usually a disaster that fund falcon

284
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:57,170
hind and warned them about in advance.
Don't do that.

285
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:02,470
It'll be a disaster.
And then they do it against his wishes 

286
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,260
and then come and ask to be bailed out 
multiple times.

287
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,560
They can always play their,
their trump card though,

288
00:16:06,561 --> 00:16:07,820
against,
on Falcon Hine,

289
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,180
legitimately considering the huge 
casualties they've suffered.

290
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,860
They can kind of go there and say,
well listen,

291
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:13,400
I mean,
you know,

292
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:14,360
if you don't help us,
uh,

293
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,520
we're not that far from dropping out of 
the war.

294
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,520
I don't know.
I can't guarantee you will be here and 

295
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:21,520
you know,
you have to help them.

296
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,480
Or it's a strategic disaster if the 
Austro-hungarian dropout of the war.

297
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:28,481
Right,
but fun Falcon Hind doesn't want to pay 

298
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:28,610
any attention to any of these other 
friends.

299
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:30,110
He doesn't want to worry about the 
Russians.

300
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:33,170
There are German generals and whatnot.
They keep saying,

301
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:35,240
we need to focus on the Russians.
That's how we win the war.

302
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,770
Falcon.
I didn't want to hear about that,

303
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,260
doesn't want to focus in the Balkans,
although in 1915 they destroy Serbia,

304
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,400
just get that out of the way,
fall behind,

305
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,020
doesn't want to hear about the Middle 
East and the Turkey doesn't want to talk

306
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:50,840
about Australia and her problem doesn't 
want to know what he's doing.

307
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,900
He wants to focus on this maybe war 
winning or war,

308
00:16:56,421 --> 00:17:01,421
losing Gordian Knot.
That is the puzzle that must be solved 

309
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,050
if you are a general task with winning 
this war.

310
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:08,470
It's the western front.
How do you deal with that and it and 

311
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:12,371
it's an unprecedented problem.
You know there's a famous German saying 

312
00:17:12,371 --> 00:17:16,211
that may or may not have happened,
but it's infused this whole period where

313
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:22,031
one German general is supposed to have 
commented about how amazingly the 

314
00:17:22,031 --> 00:17:26,051
British troops fought and he said 
they're lions and the sub commander with

315
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:29,960
him is supposed to have said something 
to the effect of Yes,

316
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,150
lucky for us,
they are led by donkeys.

317
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,380
Nineteen 15 is western front.
Battles are where the donkeys first get 

318
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,830
labeled with that sort of reputation.
At the same time,

319
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,840
when you realize that they have no 
metrics for what they're doing in 1915,

320
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,990
this has never been done before.
Nobody's ever had this kind of firepower

321
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,940
and nobody's ever put these kinds of 
defenses up.

322
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:58,941
I mean,
we're playing with all sorts of new 

323
00:17:58,941 --> 00:17:58,941
military toys and they've never been 
tested.

324
00:17:58,941 --> 00:18:03,560
In a situation like this,
how much slack do you cut the generals 

325
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,570
and give them what is sometimes called 
by historians,

326
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:11,571
in this case,
a learning curve when you're playing 

327
00:18:11,571 --> 00:18:14,991
with people's lives,
how slowly are you allowed to figure 

328
00:18:14,991 --> 00:18:18,291
things out?
We didn't go into any of the 1915 

329
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:22,131
battles.
Winston Churchill is just one of many 

330
00:18:22,131 --> 00:18:23,670
people who object to the whole idea of 
calling those battles.

331
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,700
In the 19,
15 year or 1916 year or 1917 year 

332
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,471
battles,
he says it's a disservice to what the 

333
00:18:33,471 --> 00:18:36,531
name means.
You said there were battles in 1914 at 

334
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:37,320
the start of the war and there were 
battles in 1918 at the end of the war,

335
00:18:37,321 --> 00:18:39,700
but that stuff in the middle was a 
siege.

336
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,010
He writes,
quote,

337
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:47,030
these sanguinary prodigious struggles 
extending over many months are often 

338
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:51,891
loosely described as battles,
judging by the number of men who took 

339
00:18:51,891 --> 00:18:56,181
their turn in the fighting at different 
times by the immense quantities of guns 

340
00:18:56,181 --> 00:18:58,770
and shells employed and by the hideous 
casualty totals.

341
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,040
They certainly rank taken as a whole 
among the largest events in military 

342
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,511
history,
but we must not be misled by 

343
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:08,511
terminology.
You have to call them.

344
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:13,371
Battles was merely a method of 
presenting a general view of an 

345
00:19:13,371 --> 00:19:16,080
otherwise confusing picture.
It might well pass unchallenged,

346
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:21,350
but an attempt has been made by military
commanders and buy a whole school of 

347
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:25,521
writers to represent these prolonged 
operations as events comparable to the 

348
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:31,431
decisive battles of the past.
Only larger and more important to yield 

349
00:19:31,431 --> 00:19:35,460
to this specious argument is to be drawn
into a wholly wrong impression,

350
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:40,610
both of military science and of what 
actually took place in the Great War and

351
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:45,950
quote,
these battles on the western front for a

352
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:51,411
full three years in the conflict look 
pretty much like this as described by 

353
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,120
historian older.
Her vague quote,

354
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,940
the fighting on the western front had 
taken on a deadly regularity.

355
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:05,180
Attackers stormed enemy trenches in 
waves only to be mowed down by hostile 

356
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:09,180
machine gun firing artillery,
as they tried to cut the wire,

357
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:12,690
entanglements that protected the 
earthworks and quote,

358
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,580
there's a repetitiveness to the fighting
on the western front.

359
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:22,730
It's a repetitiveness that actually is 
associated with World War One and the 

360
00:20:22,891 --> 00:20:25,770
western front specifically.
It's part of the tragedy.

361
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:31,010
It adds to the pain because after all,
if you've seen this same event over and 

362
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:37,701
over and over again,
doesn't it become a different kind of 

363
00:20:37,701 --> 00:20:41,901
tragic?
If you watch the first wave of those 

364
00:20:41,901 --> 00:20:43,140
young soldiers leave the safety of their
trench,

365
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,470
go over the top at the whistle of their 
officer,

366
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:51,250
get down by machine gunfire before 
they've even gone 10 feet.

367
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,310
That's tragic.
It's another level of tragedy.

368
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:58,480
When the next wave gets up right behind 
them to follow in their footsteps.

369
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,180
Having already seen what happened to 
them.

370
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:08,510
That's what we wanted to capture in our 
discussions of the western front because

371
00:21:08,941 --> 00:21:13,941
it became an issue early on how we were 
going to deal with all these battles 

372
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:18,261
that were roughly the same,
equally tragic and for the soldiers on 

373
00:21:18,261 --> 00:21:21,930
the ground.
Eerily similar when trying to figure out

374
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,630
what we wanted to highlight.
A shakespeare quote kept popping into my

375
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:32,631
head when I was working on this and it 
was his line that all the world's a 

376
00:21:32,631 --> 00:21:36,090
stage and all the people merely players 
and I thought to myself,

377
00:21:36,091 --> 00:21:37,680
well,
that's what we have here.

378
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,280
We have one of the most extreme stages 
in human history we've created with 

379
00:21:47,131 --> 00:21:49,560
these western front battles in 1915,
19,

380
00:21:49,561 --> 00:21:50,640
16,
1917,

381
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:55,910
a hell like environment and then we 
force millions of people to act in it,

382
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:06,710
but some of the most extreme situations 
people have been put into ever in 

383
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:11,781
history and watching how they endured is
sometimes soul crushing.

384
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,300
But at other times it's absolutely life 
enhancing.

385
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:24,410
No,
sometimes you can benefit quite a bit 

386
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,890
from the suffering of other people.

387
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:34,260
As we sat down when we started this 
series and tried to figure out a 

388
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,310
creative approach to dealing with all 
these battles,

389
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:41,730
one thing becomes very clear and we did 
some creative experiments and you 

390
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:46,501
quickly find out that the battles in an 
emotional sense reach a point of 

391
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:51,721
diminishing returns very quickly.
You just become been benumbed by them 

392
00:22:52,091 --> 00:22:53,860
all the scale,
the intensity,

393
00:22:53,861 --> 00:22:58,861
the sheer horrific repetitive pounding 
eventually makes you stop feeling.

394
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,360
And so rather than go from I'm 
indecisive and horrific battle to the 

395
00:23:07,271 --> 00:23:11,980
next indecisive and horrific battle,
we thought we would focus on a few,

396
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,550
what we would consider to be almost 
signature battles,

397
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:18,880
if you will.
But they provide a very similar backdrop

398
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:23,620
for the poor individuals who have to 
live in that environment and allow us to

399
00:23:23,621 --> 00:23:28,621
sort of examined at a human level what's
going on here a little bit as best we 

400
00:23:28,621 --> 00:23:33,091
can.
And to explore some of the questions 

401
00:23:33,091 --> 00:23:36,061
that are very intriguing about the story
and not just about the human suffering 

402
00:23:36,061 --> 00:23:37,690
that about command decisions and some of
the technology and some other things.

403
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,720
Um,
hopefully interspersed with a little bit

404
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:43,870
of comment about what's going on in the 
rest of the world.

405
00:23:43,871 --> 00:23:47,900
Wild this is happening.
And part of what makes 1916 so difficult

406
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:50,090
is there's a lot of overlapping stuff.

407
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,060
So if you tell it in a he said,
she said then he said fashion.

408
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,360
It becomes very confusing very quickly.
The first thing to understand though is 

409
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,921
that 1916 comes about obviously because 
of plans made in late 1915.

410
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,760
We'd said to you earlier that this was a
real question for the generals about how

411
00:24:11,831 --> 00:24:15,730
you solve this Gordian knot that is the 
western front will.

412
00:24:15,731 --> 00:24:20,731
In late 1915,
the allied command's got together at a 

413
00:24:20,731 --> 00:24:22,420
place called chantilly and France to 
deal with this question.

414
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,840
They're plan was going to be to continue
to pound and pound harder,

415
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,640
but the new aspect was they were going 
to make sure that everybody,

416
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:37,690
all the different allied powers pounded 
the central powers,

417
00:24:37,691 --> 00:24:40,330
Germany and friends at the same time,

418
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,630
they were going to coordinate their 
efforts.

419
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,920
This was going to nullify what the 
Germans had been doing.

420
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:48,630
So far.
The Germans have a great army,

421
00:24:48,631 --> 00:24:53,400
but they can't be everywhere at once.
Luckily for them up until 1916,

422
00:24:53,401 --> 00:24:55,440
they weren't attacked everywhere at 
once,

423
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,890
so they would use something called 
interior lines.

424
00:24:58,891 --> 00:25:02,850
It's a little like taking the center 
square in a game of tic TAC toe.

425
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:08,180
The Germans were able to use their 
wonderful railway system to transfer 

426
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:12,081
troops from less threatened sectors to 
more hotspots and thereby frustrate 

427
00:25:12,081 --> 00:25:17,031
allied efforts.
So the allied plan for knocking down 

428
00:25:17,031 --> 00:25:18,390
German fortifications in 1916 is that 
they're all going to attack it basically

429
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:23,391
the same time frustrating.
The Germans ability to move troops to 

430
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:26,541
hotspots.
The Germans had a different plan 

431
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:28,911
entirely.
You see the people at chantilly in 1950 

432
00:25:28,911 --> 00:25:32,721
new get together and decide to attack 
the Germans from multiple locations at 

433
00:25:32,721 --> 00:25:36,291
the same time are still for the most 
part in visioning the classic military 

434
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:41,540
end to this war.
They see the chances increased by 

435
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:46,461
attacking at multiple locations that 
you're going to crack the Germans 

436
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,820
somewhere and when you crack them,
you're going to send your forces through

437
00:25:47,821 --> 00:25:52,821
the breach and you're going to send the 
cavalry through and now the Germans are 

438
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:55,581
going to break in.
They're going to be on the run and they 

439
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:57,081
got to be routed towards Berlin and you 
know that's how these things and in the 

440
00:25:57,081 --> 00:26:00,171
minds of people who have a very.
Especially in old fashioned view of war,

441
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:04,650
there are dissidence to this idea who 
say,

442
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,990
even on the allied side,
you got it all wrong.

443
00:26:06,991 --> 00:26:09,060
It's not going to happen that way.
The technology,

444
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,910
the specific circumstances,
the fact that there are no flying on the

445
00:26:11,911 --> 00:26:16,911
western front,
you were dreaming and because you're 

446
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:16,911
dreaming,
your plans aren't going to work.

447
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:18,440
Right?
On the German side,

448
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:23,470
the people who have this attitude that 
that old fashioned viewpoint is just 

449
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,701
that old fashioned happened to be in 
positions of higher authority than the 

450
00:26:27,701 --> 00:26:28,940
dissident generals.
On the other side.

451
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:36,240
They've looked at the way the war is 
going and figured out that the 

452
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,361
casualties are the difference maker,
and then all these countries are 

453
00:26:39,461 --> 00:26:41,650
suffering because of the numbers of 
people that are dying.

454
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:44,520
You need to increase the numbers.
People who were dying,

455
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,620
not only does it become hard to replace 
them,

456
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,920
but it puts huge stresses and strains on
the societies that are losing these 

457
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,320
people,
their families,

458
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:57,321
their governments.
Some of these societies are fragile 

459
00:26:57,321 --> 00:26:59,250
enough to simply fall apart like a house
of cards.

460
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,210
Others could have the entire population 
turned on the government and say,

461
00:27:03,211 --> 00:27:08,211
we know we've had enough.
That becomes the best path to end the 

462
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:08,760
war in the minds of some of these 
generals.

463
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:14,390
A guy like the leader in Germany,
Eric von Falcon Hine is looking at what 

464
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:18,981
these 1915 battles taught him and they 
taught him that modern warfare on the 

465
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:22,500
western front turns into a meat grinder.

466
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:26,280
No matter what you do when he comes up 
with the brilliant idea.

467
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:27,990
Again,
most historians still think,

468
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,520
uh,
some people say it's,

469
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,640
you know,
shooting an Arrow and painting a 

470
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,141
bullseye around it afterwards.
But he comes up with the brilliant idea 

471
00:27:36,141 --> 00:27:38,811
that these meat grinders are happening 
no matter what you designed the battle 

472
00:27:38,811 --> 00:27:42,381
to be like,
what if you designed the battle to be 

473
00:27:42,381 --> 00:27:44,181
like a meat grinder?
What if you create a meat grinder and 

474
00:27:44,181 --> 00:27:49,011
then entice the enemy to come into it if
that's what's so effective on the 

475
00:27:49,011 --> 00:27:52,941
battlefield?
What if you planned to grind meat 

476
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:55,830
instead of having it be a byproduct of 
other activities and plans?

477
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,120
And Falcon 19,
late 1915 determines that the French are

478
00:28:00,121 --> 00:28:01,110
already,
you know,

479
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:06,111
near their breaking point in terms of 
the casualties they've suffered and he 

480
00:28:06,111 --> 00:28:06,270
goes to the rest of the military 
command.

481
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:10,290
He starts talking about what he'd like 
to do in 1916 to try to win the war.

482
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,600
He wants to set a trap for the French 
army.

483
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
The idea is to create one of these,
you know,

484
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:25,900
Modern Twentieth Century Attrition 
Amplifiers,

485
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:30,190
one of these meat grinders and then Lou 
or the French army into it.

486
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,040
For that,
you need bait

487
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:38,970
and the determination on where this 
awful battles going to happen is 

488
00:28:39,101 --> 00:28:44,101
dependent on what site can be chosen 
that would best play the role of Bait,

489
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:50,070
and I should point out that historians 
from different countries disagree on 

490
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:52,891
this.
Americans and British historians often 

491
00:28:52,891 --> 00:28:54,280
point out that this site chosen has no 
real military value at all,

492
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:59,490
that it was solely chosen because it's 
the perfect emotional bait to lure the 

493
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:02,710
French army into the meat grinder.
German and French historians,

494
00:29:02,711 --> 00:29:07,711
though often assert that this site did 
have military importance and that that 

495
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:12,140
you know,
did create a real military need to do 

496
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:12,490
what the French ended up doing.
Nonetheless,

497
00:29:12,491 --> 00:29:17,491
the German plan is to use all this 
artillery first to pulverize the 

498
00:29:17,741 --> 00:29:22,741
defenses around this important site that
the French have an emotional and 

499
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:26,770
political and everything else attachment
to below the French,

500
00:29:26,771 --> 00:29:29,860
off of these hills that overlooked this 
city.

501
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,310
This city called Verdun,
and then four to five the hills.

502
00:29:34,311 --> 00:29:38,630
Bring your guns up there,
start shooting at the city of Verdun and

503
00:29:38,631 --> 00:29:42,760
wait for the French army to show up and 
try knock you off those hills.

504
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,900
And knowing the superiority of prepared 
defenses,

505
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:51,310
the French are just going to bash 
themselves up against your barbed wire,

506
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:52,870
your trenches,
your machine guns,

507
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:58,140
your cannon,
and everything else in a place that was 

508
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:58,140
specifically designed to be a killing 
field.

509
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:03,380
So thoroughly attritional bloody 20th 
century,

510
00:30:03,381 --> 00:30:07,450
way to conduct warfare,
but it's not a bad idea.

511
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:13,620
It also should be no surprise that a 
battle that was designed to act like a 

512
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:19,000
meat grinder turns into one of the most 
horrible battles of all time.

513
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,870
Even the name,
when I hear it Verdun,

514
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,280
it's like Stalin Grad.
It really is.

515
00:30:27,281 --> 00:30:31,450
It's one of those names that just 
conjures up a specific image and,

516
00:30:31,451 --> 00:30:36,451
and level of horror that puts it in a 
special place in military history.

517
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:37,990
You know,
it's,

518
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,700
it's sort of like if you said,
you know,

519
00:30:39,701 --> 00:30:42,880
where's the worst place in the world to 
ever be in military history?

520
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:45,730
It's like a tie between a million 
different spots,

521
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:48,250
right?
Mankind's had a long enough past so that

522
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:53,050
there are recurring examples of horrific
places to end up on any given day.

523
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:58,051
We like to cite the famous battle 
between the Romans and the 

524
00:30:58,051 --> 00:30:58,051
Carthaginians.
Thousands of years ago,

525
00:30:58,051 --> 00:31:03,051
Kenny were all those Romans were 
surrounded and trapped and killed over 

526
00:31:03,051 --> 00:31:03,051
the whole long day.
I mean,

527
00:31:03,051 --> 00:31:07,701
it's terrible,
but probably about as bad as a lot of 

528
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:09,600
other terrible situations.
There's a few where you just go,

529
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,690
okay,
that's as bad as the battle of Kony sort

530
00:31:12,691 --> 00:31:14,680
of.
But add artillery.

531
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,290
I mean Verdun is like nothing

532
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,530
that has ever happened really on a large
scale.

533
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,510
I'm sure.
Again,

534
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,850
mankind's long history,
everything's Kinda tried.

535
00:31:22,851 --> 00:31:25,850
Nothing's new under the sun as they say,
but for dentists,

536
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,890
Special Verdun is so special,
in fact,

537
00:31:27,891 --> 00:31:32,540
and so different and so outside the box 
for the thinking of the time period that

538
00:31:32,541 --> 00:31:37,541
when fall heightened comes up with the 
idea that he's going to bleed France 

539
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:42,400
white his words.
It's so runs against the grain of the 

540
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:45,770
19th century,
sort of morality of warfare.

541
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:50,630
Remember we started this war a mere year
and a half ago wearing white gloves with

542
00:31:50,631 --> 00:31:55,631
people who dewald when they were in 
school together and who thought of this 

543
00:31:55,631 --> 00:31:56,300
in an almost,
especially on the western front,

544
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,340
Golan kind of sense,
right?

545
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:00,980
We should exchange swords when we 
surrender and all this stuff,

546
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,930
and now we have generals thinking,
okay,

547
00:32:02,931 --> 00:32:07,931
how can I lewer millions of men into a 
confined space and just pound them into 

548
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:14,291
Marmalade to quote one French soldiers 
way of explaining what happened.

549
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:18,170
One of the things I love by the way 
about this period,

550
00:32:18,171 --> 00:32:20,030
just like I love it about the Second 
World War,

551
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:24,740
is that we have a lot of the actual 
words of the generals themselves.

552
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,350
They all wrote memoirs,
as we said after the war,

553
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:31,610
most of the time trying to defend their 
reputation against their critics because

554
00:32:31,611 --> 00:32:36,611
after this war,
everyone's pointing fingers at 

555
00:32:36,611 --> 00:32:36,611
everybody,
you know,

556
00:32:36,611 --> 00:32:40,241
because it was so terrible and people 
were so angry and so mad generals 

557
00:32:40,241 --> 00:32:42,380
amongst other people that they were 
looking to blame.

558
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,710
Then all these generals would write 
pieces defending their ideas.

559
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,140
We have faulconer Heinz,
we have looted and doors.

560
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,640
We have all these guy's memoir's now you
can't take them at face value.

561
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,380
Remember,
they're trying to stake out a historical

562
00:32:54,381 --> 00:32:58,100
position here in defense of their own 
historical reputation.

563
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,750
Nonetheless,
Falcon Nine,

564
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,760
you know,
and you either love fall behind or hate 

565
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:04,760
him.

566
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:04,760
He has his fans and he has his 
detractors.

567
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,620
I'm one of his fans.
I liked the way his mind works and the 

568
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:08,620
way he writes in his book where he,
you know,

569
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,210
written right after the war where he's 
trying to explain his thinking on this.

570
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,460
He runs down in logical fashion,
you know,

571
00:33:13,461 --> 00:33:17,810
where he sees the war in 1915 and it's 
not that bad for the central powers.

572
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:22,811
You'll hear a lot of people that will 
say after the Germans failed with that 

573
00:33:22,811 --> 00:33:25,751
initial knockout blow in 1914,
it was all a hard slog downhill for 

574
00:33:25,751 --> 00:33:26,030
them.
Not Necessarily

575
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,450
Nineteen 15 was a good year for the 
central powers.

576
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:35,570
They'll have some other attempts where 
they'll almost win the war later in the 

577
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:35,570
war.
So this is like,

578
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,390
as we've said all along the heavyweight 
fight,

579
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,690
and there are times when both sides have
the other side in trouble.

580
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:43,500
A quick look at Fall Ghanaians Memoir 
shows that he thinks Francis in trouble,

581
00:33:43,501 --> 00:33:45,330
but it's not that far from the breaking 
point.

582
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:50,810
Here's what Falcon Hind writes about,
his thinking leading up to his planning 

583
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,830
for this battle that he's most known for
it for done.

584
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,010
Falcon hine writes,
quote,

585
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:01,460
as I've already insisted,
the strain on France has almost reached 

586
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:05,001
the breaking point,
though it is certainly borne with the 

587
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,491
most remarkable devotion.
If we succeeded in opening the eyes of 

588
00:34:07,491 --> 00:34:09,870
her people to the fact that in the 
military sense they have nothing more to

589
00:34:09,871 --> 00:34:12,990
hope for.
That breaking point would be reached and

590
00:34:12,991 --> 00:34:17,040
England's best sword knocked out of her 
hand to achieve that object.

591
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:22,190
The uncertain method of a massive 
breakthrough in any case beyond our 

592
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:25,971
means is unnecessary.
We can probably do enough for our 

593
00:34:25,971 --> 00:34:29,661
purposes with limited resources within 
our reach behind the French sector of 

594
00:34:29,661 --> 00:34:34,401
the western front.
They are our objectives for the 

595
00:34:34,401 --> 00:34:37,071
retention of which the French general 
staff would be compelled to throw in 

596
00:34:37,071 --> 00:34:38,610
every man they have.
If they do so,

597
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:43,880
the forces of France will bleed to death
as there can be no question of a 

598
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,140
voluntary withdrawal,
whether we reach our goal or not.

599
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,520
And to quote

600
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:52,740
British military historian John Keegan 
put it this way,

601
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:56,700
quote Falcon Heinz plan was brutally 
simple.

602
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:01,970
The French forced to fight in a crucial 
but narrowly constricted corner of the 

603
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:06,441
western front would be compelled to feed
reinforcements into a battle of 

604
00:35:06,441 --> 00:35:09,840
attrition where the material 
circumstances so favored the Germans.

605
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:13,290
That defeat was inevitable.
If the French gave up the struggle,

606
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,840
they would lose verdun.
If they persisted,

607
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:21,080
they would lose their army.
And to quote this plan of Falcon Heine 

608
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:25,260
was given the sinister sounding name of 
Operation Gallery,

609
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,170
which I've seen translated multiple 
different ways.

610
00:35:28,171 --> 00:35:33,171
Usually it's called operation judgment,
which implies a sort of finality that is

611
00:35:34,501 --> 00:35:37,140
the high hope of fall behind going into 
this campaign.

612
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:42,350
Maybe this will decide the war,
another translation you sometimes run 

613
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:45,500
into his court of Justice.
Same sort of an idea,

614
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:49,110
a decision point.
The third translation though that you'll

615
00:35:49,111 --> 00:35:54,111
sometimes run into is more indicative of
the tactics and approach that Falcon 

616
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,760
Heights going to take to win this 
battle.

617
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:02,690
It's operation place of execution and 
while the Kaiser and fall behind and all

618
00:36:05,161 --> 00:36:07,470
these generals are coming up with this 
plan in late 1915,

619
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:12,510
the allies,
the entente forces are doing the same 

620
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,310
thing and the allies a little bit 
lackadaisical about the whole thing.

621
00:36:14,311 --> 00:36:19,311
Not the Russians,
not the people in the Balkans had been 

622
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:19,380
feeling German attacks over the last 
year,

623
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:24,740
but the British and the French who 
haven't seen the German army on the 

624
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:28,311
offensive since way back in 1914.
They're kind of leisurely planning what 

625
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:33,111
they think will probably be their war 
winning giant offensive slated for late 

626
00:36:33,111 --> 00:36:37,640
spring or early summer,
1916 over on the river somme and 

627
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,630
enormous joined British and French 
effort with months of planning and and 

628
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,800
just sweeping everything in front of 
them.

629
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:48,830
That kind of rosy outlook and the 
Germans instead in late February,

630
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,490
19,
16,

631
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,940
go on the offensive on the western front
for the first time in more than a year 

632
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,010
and catch everyone off guard.

633
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:01,730
It's ridiculous that they could have the
amount of effort that was required to 

634
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:07,371
put together a modern offensive is 
something we modern people take for 

635
00:37:07,371 --> 00:37:11,481
granted,
but when you hear how much planning and 

636
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:15,741
stockpiling and engineering feats are 
required to pull off something like the 

637
00:37:15,781 --> 00:37:19,950
battle of Verdun,
you begin to see why it was so different

638
00:37:19,951 --> 00:37:22,230
than anything these people had ever 
known in the past.

639
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:27,740
As we said,
100 years before and Napoleonic battle 

640
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,441
was considered extraordinary.
If it went on for three days throughout 

641
00:37:30,441 --> 00:37:32,010
most of human history battles take 
hours.

642
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:37,850
These battles that these allied and 
central power planners are conducting 

643
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:44,240
require months of preparation.
They all go on for months to how do you 

644
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,131
get enough stuff there to make sure your
soldiers don't starve or run out of 

645
00:37:49,131 --> 00:37:49,890
ammunition?
Well,

646
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:55,550
for the battle of Verdun,
it was more than seven weeks of actual 

647
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:59,430
unloading of supplies.
Here's the way writer Gj Meyer describes

648
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:04,380
the planning and stockpiling before the 
February 1916 battle quote,

649
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,390
the Germans.
Meanwhile,

650
00:38:06,391 --> 00:38:09,930
we're accomplishing prodigious feats in 
getting everything in place,

651
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,600
helped by the Heli,
wouldn't countryside,

652
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,210
and the cloudy winter weather of the 
Verdun region.

653
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:20,450
They were doing an astonishingly good 
job of keeping the French from learning 

654
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:24,261
what they intended to do,
or when or even exactly were no fewer 

655
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:28,761
than five new railway lines were 
constructed across the German held 

656
00:38:28,761 --> 00:38:32,040
portion of the plateau immediately to 
the east of the verdant hills in a seven

657
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:35,190
week period between late December and 
early February,

658
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,430
1300

659
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,830
trains,
not railway cars,

660
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:43,660
but entire trains hauled in two point 5 
million shells,

661
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,960
earthmoving equipment,
construction machinery and everything 

662
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,860
required to prepare the offensive and 
support 300,000

663
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:53,740
troops in winter came rolling up to 
Verdun.

664
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:59,010
The guns were positioned in the woods 
and covered with camouflage and new 

665
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:01,570
development in warfare made necessary by
aerial reconnaissance.

666
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,070
Underground chambers capable of holding 
as many as $500,

667
00:39:05,071 --> 00:39:07,960
million each.
We're escovedo opposite the French lines

668
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,750
and lined with steel and concrete in the
sky.

669
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:15,751
Above all,
this was the greatest concentration of 

670
00:39:15,751 --> 00:39:16,930
aircraft yet seen on any front 150 
aircraft,

671
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:22,110
a German umbrella,
so impenetrable that even on the rare 

672
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,590
days when visibility was good,
the French pilots were unable to get a 

673
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,130
close look at what was happening.
By the second week of February,

674
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,280
everything was in place for an offensive
with the potential to change the course 

675
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,641
of the war and the German plan was 
complicated and it was complicated 

676
00:39:38,621 --> 00:39:43,621
because this was one of the great 
defensive spots in French history for 

677
00:39:43,621 --> 00:39:45,610
Don wasn't just a fortress.
It was a fortress zone.

678
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,990
Multiple fortresses all working together

679
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:55,490
ground that had been fought over since 
the day of Julius Caesar and the Romans 

680
00:39:56,370 --> 00:40:01,370
fortifications that had been upgraded.
Even as recently as 1914 when the 

681
00:40:01,861 --> 00:40:05,100
lessons of what happened to those 
Belgian forts were incorporated,

682
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:10,610
and then when the war started,
the French high command decided that 

683
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:15,171
fortresses we're old fashioned due to 
the limits of new technology or rather 

684
00:40:15,241 --> 00:40:20,241
the lack of limits.
They decided that those Belgian forts 

685
00:40:20,241 --> 00:40:21,870
being pounded by,
that artillery signaled that these forts

686
00:40:21,871 --> 00:40:26,871
were nothing but a death trap,
and it would be better to take the 

687
00:40:26,871 --> 00:40:30,591
weapons on them and the troops that man 
them and put them to where the hotspots 

688
00:40:30,591 --> 00:40:30,600
were in the fighting.
After all,

689
00:40:30,601 --> 00:40:34,790
if Francis in a life or death struggle,
what are we putting a 100,000

690
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:39,810
or more troops in the ridden region to 
man a bunch of fortresses that are just 

691
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:40,380
going to trap them and get them killed 
by artillery.

692
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,420
Let's put them where they're needed.
Oh yeah.

693
00:40:42,421 --> 00:40:45,270
Make sure they bring the guns and the 
ammunition and everything else.

694
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:50,660
So they did for don was a relatively 
relatively quiet sector in 1916 before 

695
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:54,450
the big German buildup.
Nonetheless,

696
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:59,451
you can't hide preparations as extensive
as the German preparations for wherever 

697
00:40:59,451 --> 00:41:02,580
the French become aware of it a couple 
of weeks before the Germans launch their

698
00:41:02,581 --> 00:41:05,460
attack and are quickly trying to make up
for lost ground and get stuff,

699
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,720
you know,
to these areas because they can sense a 

700
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:10,720
buildup.
And the Germans are launching,

701
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,760
um,
distracting attacks elsewhere to sort of

702
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,920
confused the French on where 
everything's coming from.

703
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,030
And on February 21st after a couple of 
postponements due to bad weather,

704
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:23,450
the storm breaks,
it's kicked off by a giant naval gun 

705
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:26,370
whose nickname,
by the way,

706
00:41:26,371 --> 00:41:29,100
as long Max,
just like naming swords,

707
00:41:29,101 --> 00:41:34,101
got a name the guns to apparently and 
long Max fires a shell that travels

708
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,440
somewhere between 15 and 20 miles.
These are enormous weapons.

709
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:45,040
And that becomes the first shelter drop 
as part of the giant barrage that kicks 

710
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:51,071
off the battle of Verdun.
And right after long Max is barrage 

711
00:41:51,071 --> 00:41:53,960
kicks off all these enormous weapons 
open up.

712
00:41:53,961 --> 00:41:58,340
See,
it's not just between 1200 to 1500 guns,

713
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:03,230
it's that half of them are huge.
You have all those guns that pounded the

714
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:08,231
fortunate Belgium,
those giant 420 millimeter gamma 

715
00:42:08,231 --> 00:42:11,261
mortars.
You had the 380 millimeter Skoda pieces 

716
00:42:11,261 --> 00:42:11,960
from Austria and you have more of each 
of them.

717
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:15,330
And then you have an enormous number of 
210 millimeters and,

718
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:18,950
and one seventies and 1:55.
And I mean my goodness,

719
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:24,640
and they open up all at once and begin 
pounding this relatively small area of 

720
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:30,191
the front.
What makes this so incredibly damaging 

721
00:42:30,191 --> 00:42:33,491
is do you have these huge weapons 
pounding this relatively tiny area on a 

722
00:42:33,491 --> 00:42:37,490
map and you fire an enormous number of 
shells by any standard,

723
00:42:37,491 --> 00:42:40,520
the first world war in a short period of
time.

724
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:46,150
So if you're on the ground at some of 
those 1915 battles and they're firing 

725
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:49,541
one point 7 million shells,
but they're doing it over two or three 

726
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:52,841
or four weeks,
the intensity on the ground is very 

727
00:42:52,841 --> 00:42:55,451
different than if they're firing 2 
million shells in six days

728
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:59,940
over a tiny area.
One little wood on the battlefield,

729
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:04,050
a thousand yards by 500 yards,
took 80,000

730
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:07,470
shells in the first week.
What does that look like?

731
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,890
There's no human reference for this.
I'm going to try to picture.

732
00:43:10,891 --> 00:43:15,891
I closed my eyes and I try to picture 
forests disappearing in front of my 

733
00:43:15,891 --> 00:43:16,720
eyes.
This is heavily wooded,

734
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,600
forested,
hilly terrain and burden.

735
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,900
And right after the bombardment,
you know,

736
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:22,830
24 hours,
there's no forest laughed.

737
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:28,190
I've watched forests belonged over weeks
and months and it's still appalling to 

738
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:32,451
wake up and more forest is gone.
What if you got to watch the entire 

739
00:43:32,451 --> 00:43:32,970
thing churned up in front of you in a 
matter of hours,

740
00:43:32,971 --> 00:43:37,890
like a giant celestial weed whacker and 
chewing up grass.

741
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,620
There are accounts that say that,
you know,

742
00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:43,320
you'd have the shelling is so intensive 
to a giant tree,

743
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:45,750
would get blown up in the air and before
it lands on the ground again,

744
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:47,850
another shell hits it and blows it right
back up in the air.

745
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:53,090
A veteran said that the battlefield 
quickly looked like an asparagus farm 

746
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:55,290
with giant shoots shooting up all over 
the soil everywhere,

747
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:57,990
which are the tree stumps and wood 
everywhere.

748
00:43:57,991 --> 00:44:02,991
Needless to say to me,
this is something I would have to have 

749
00:44:03,421 --> 00:44:06,480
some sort of video have to imagine when 
I was a kid.

750
00:44:06,481 --> 00:44:08,130
I used to wonder what a tsunami looked 
like.

751
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,420
And um,

752
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:15,230
now of course we have video of that.
It was unimaginable when I was young.

753
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:20,231
Now it's something anyone who wants to 
see it can go look up on youtube or 

754
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:25,600
something.
That was a very rare sight and natural 

755
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:25,600
phenomenon or a manmade phenomenon for 
people to see.

756
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,320
Shelling is the same way,
and by the way,

757
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:32,560
there's a lot fewer accounts than you 
might imagine of the first day shelling 

758
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:36,080
at the battle of Verdun and,
um,

759
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:41,330
that's an English.
Then I'm sure there must be more German 

760
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:44,391
and French,
but it's important to point out that 

761
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:46,581
there aren't a lot of people that 
probably survived the war in tact after 

762
00:44:46,581 --> 00:44:50,841
those battles.
And the ones who did were probably not 

763
00:44:50,841 --> 00:44:51,990
all that excited to relive the 
experience.

764
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:56,160
We do have some things though,
even though it's 40 years old.

765
00:44:56,161 --> 00:45:01,161
Alister Horns,
the price of glory has some of the best 

766
00:45:01,161 --> 00:45:03,750
accounts in English of what it was like 
on the ground.

767
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:08,750
When the shelling started.
He tells one story of a corporal who is 

768
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,380
with his buddies and they're just 
grinding some coffee.

769
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,230
When the first shell start dropping,
he writes,

770
00:45:13,231 --> 00:45:18,231
quote,
suddenly the whole world seemed to 

771
00:45:18,231 --> 00:45:19,350
disintegrate around him with the 
condition to Alacrity of old soldiers.

772
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,380
The two men with the coffee grinder 
disappeared below ground,

773
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:26,670
cursing and unprintable French.
Why couldn't the bastards wait until I'd

774
00:45:26,671 --> 00:45:31,671
finished my coffee?
The air in the way that little forested 

775
00:45:31,671 --> 00:45:35,961
area,
they are seemed solid with whirling 

776
00:45:35,961 --> 00:45:38,511
material to Corporal Stephane.
It was as if it were swept by a quote 

777
00:45:38,511 --> 00:45:41,550
storm,
a hurricane attempt tempest growing ever

778
00:45:41,551 --> 00:45:46,551
stronger where it was raining,
nothing but paving stones and quote Horn

779
00:45:46,741 --> 00:45:51,741
continues,
quote upon the terrible dean of the 

780
00:45:51,741 --> 00:45:54,060
explosions were superimposed.
The splintering crashes of rending would

781
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:59,240
as the great 210 millimeter shells 
lopped off branches or uprooted the 

782
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,500
trees themselves,
barely had the tree trunks fallen.

783
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:07,530
Then they were spewed up into the air 
again by fresh eruptions from his own 

784
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:08,940
position,
still relatively immune to the shelling.

785
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:14,210
Stephane watched it's methodical,
progress with the certain macabre 

786
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:16,350
fascination.
It was like a garden hose he thought and

787
00:46:16,351 --> 00:46:21,351
quote,
and then he describes how the shells 

788
00:46:21,351 --> 00:46:24,600
would move like a wave from one location
to another,

789
00:46:24,601 --> 00:46:29,601
pounding everything in between and then 
methodically go back in the direction 

790
00:46:29,601 --> 00:46:33,741
that just came from as though it's 
continually mowing the same piece of 

791
00:46:33,741 --> 00:46:37,491
ground over and over again.
It shows you what the plan had been 

792
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:42,030
before they started to make sure every 
inch of ground was covered.

793
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,500
German aircraft are flying over the 
battlefield,

794
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:51,860
having knocked the French air force out 
of the sky and are spotting for their 

795
00:46:51,931 --> 00:46:56,931
guns and keeping the French planes from 
locating the German guns so the French 

796
00:46:57,361 --> 00:47:02,361
guns could shoot at them.
This leads to a very one sided initial 

797
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,170
encounter.
Historian Polygon.

798
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:08,190
Koski compares the initial bombardment 
here to the 1915 bottle of champagne,

799
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:12,450
which at the time seemed momentously 
titanic.

800
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,010
That was a year ago.
Now,

801
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:19,011
a year later,
it seems like chump change compared to 

802
00:47:19,011 --> 00:47:21,050
what the first day at Verdun is sort of 
priests aging.

803
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:26,400
Jen Koski writes quote,
it was partly because of such air cover,

804
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:30,350
partly because it enjoys such free rein 
that morning that the German

805
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:35,350
shelling could exceed in intensity 
anything the French or anyone else had 

806
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:39,811
ever endured.
This was the bottle of champagne 

807
00:47:39,811 --> 00:47:42,631
multiplied 10 times over,
but where the difference in kind as 

808
00:47:42,631 --> 00:47:46,291
well,
the German artillerist were blanketing 

809
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:48,930
entire zones with their shells.
They directed their fire not merely onto

810
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:53,050
positions they wished to take or onto 
lines they wish to obliterate,

811
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:57,670
but into all that nature had grown and 
that man had erected as well,

812
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,960
making up in density for what they 
lacked in precision that day.

813
00:48:01,961 --> 00:48:06,760
They saturated successive zones within a
25 mile arc between albacore on the left

814
00:48:06,761 --> 00:48:11,761
bank and attained on the right bank of 
the Muse with a million high explosive 

815
00:48:11,761 --> 00:48:13,240
shells of the heaviest caliber known 
demand,

816
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:16,780
200 8,305,
380,

817
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,960
even 420 millimeters wide and with 
lesser shells bearing toxic gases as 

818
00:48:22,061 --> 00:48:27,061
well method rather than rage.
The system of the power hammer rather 

819
00:48:27,061 --> 00:48:30,580
than the obstinacy of the battering ram 
drove the destruction,

820
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:35,820
the morbid calculus per se,
aged the carpet bombing of later wars 

821
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:38,680
that would raise entire cities and 
ignite entire landscapes.

822
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:43,890
But for now the thought was purely 
tactical to devastate so that the 

823
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:44,680
infantry could infiltrate

824
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,600
into quote.
Now,

825
00:48:47,601 --> 00:48:50,180
as Jen Koski says,
the difference in this artillery barrage

826
00:48:50,181 --> 00:48:52,610
is not just in the amount of stuff,
but the way they do it.

827
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:58,190
I mean,
they're employing every little trick 

828
00:48:58,190 --> 00:48:58,400
that they've learned in the last year,
year and a half of warfare,

829
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:02,780
including one that they probably think 
it was a clever enhancement.

830
00:49:02,781 --> 00:49:04,190
I'm sure the British and the French must
have thought it.

831
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:07,610
Another example of deviousness on the 
German part,

832
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:09,860
but the Germans start this artillery 
barrage,

833
00:49:09,861 --> 00:49:14,861
you know,
a little after seven in the morning and 

834
00:49:14,861 --> 00:49:15,890
they pound these French positions all 
morning and into the lunchtime hour,

835
00:49:15,891 --> 00:49:19,250
and then they stop at midday.
They stop on Cue all at once.

836
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:25,330
Now even to the punch,
drunk French survivors on the receiving 

837
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,200
end of the worst artillery barrage and 
human history.

838
00:49:27,201 --> 00:49:30,170
Know what this means.
It always means the same thing.

839
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:33,320
It means the German ground troops are 
coming in an offensive.

840
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,140
That's why you stopped shooting so that 
you don't blow your own men up.

841
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:37,370
Now that they're on the way,
right?

842
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:39,830
So the French runup to their positions,
they man,

843
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:45,280
their defensive spots,
they uncover any guns they've got hit 

844
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,190
and they get ready to push back the 
German assault.

845
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:48,650
Now that it's coming,
except that it isn't coming.

846
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:53,920
It's a trick and all of a sudden all the
guns opened up again and start smashing 

847
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,901
the now exposed French survivors who 
show those planes up in the air among 

848
00:49:58,901 --> 00:49:59,630
other observers.
Oh yeah.

849
00:49:59,631 --> 00:50:00,740
That guy's revived.
Oh,

850
00:50:00,741 --> 00:50:02,390
there's a machine gun nest we didn't 
see.

851
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:08,020
It was an intermission to get the French
to expose themselves and this shelan 

852
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:11,210
goes for the rest of the day until the 
late afternoon,

853
00:50:11,211 --> 00:50:14,720
so from seven something in the morning 
to force something in the afternoon,

854
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,200
and then the French survivors see the 
first signs of German infantry activity 

855
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:25,061
approaching what they see looks like 
something out of a time machine from the

856
00:50:28,341 --> 00:50:33,341
hitlarian Arab gone are the iconic 
pickle.

857
00:50:34,191 --> 00:50:39,191
How by the pointed helmets that the 
German troops were that hearkened back 

858
00:50:39,191 --> 00:50:41,930
to the greatness of Prussia in Europe at
the height of its 19th century,

859
00:50:41,931 --> 00:50:46,931
sort of colonial dominance.
It's symbolic and it's been replaced 

860
00:50:46,931 --> 00:50:47,690
with something that looks like a minor 
should wear it

861
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,070
thoroughly working class,
nothing romantic,

862
00:50:52,071 --> 00:50:54,750
gentlemanly officer or a risk socratic 
about it.

863
00:50:56,090 --> 00:51:01,090
These tip of the spear troops here are 
wearing the German style helm,

864
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,760
which with a minor modification or two 
is the exact same helmet the German 

865
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,810
troops will were in the Second World 
War.

866
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:13,490
These storm troopers,
as they're called and have been known to

867
00:51:13,491 --> 00:51:18,491
history,
look like the Wehrmacht and they're 

868
00:51:18,491 --> 00:51:22,600
carrying flame throwers among other 
nasty surprises for anyone.

869
00:51:23,061 --> 00:51:25,190
They might run into the gun machine guns
with them.

870
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:30,220
They got men who are wearing clothes 
that have big bags sort of as part of 

871
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:34,190
the where they can stuff hand grenades 
because you just can't carry enough hand

872
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:37,040
grenades when you need them.
They've even got in this,

873
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:38,390
you know,
shows you what they think.

874
00:51:38,391 --> 00:51:40,820
They're up against melee weapons with 
them.

875
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:46,030
I mean they're famous.
All these storm troop type units are 

876
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:48,161
famous for the clubs they carry or the 
hatchets or the long knives or even 

877
00:51:48,381 --> 00:51:50,060
things like brass knuckles and stuff.

878
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:54,740
These are people who expect to get into 
physical combat at very close range.

879
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,760
They are using what at the time seemed 
like very new fangled,

880
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:04,070
very modern techniques on the 
battlefield.

881
00:52:04,071 --> 00:52:08,000
They're known as infiltration tactics.
They pretty much are the same small unit

882
00:52:08,001 --> 00:52:10,460
tactics every military in the world uses
today.

883
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,980
They've been in development for a while 
too.

884
00:52:12,981 --> 00:52:17,981
It's a myth to suggest that the first 
time anybody sees them as with these 

885
00:52:17,981 --> 00:52:21,781
storm troops,
but these storm troops are the first to 

886
00:52:21,781 --> 00:52:22,460
integrate everything into their system 
here.

887
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,860
Not only are they going to use these 
infiltration tactics,

888
00:52:24,861 --> 00:52:29,861
but look at the weapons that they've 
armed themselves with and they've 

889
00:52:29,861 --> 00:52:29,861
trained with all this.
In other words,

890
00:52:29,861 --> 00:52:33,041
they've integrated all the various ideas
and theories from all the militaries 

891
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:36,161
around the world for the last 15 years 
and are the first to put these troops 

892
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:39,491
out in the field whose job it is to look
for weak spots and they call them the 

893
00:52:40,221 --> 00:52:42,560
field and when they run into,
you know,

894
00:52:42,561 --> 00:52:47,561
significant opposition,
they stop or move around it in places 

895
00:52:47,561 --> 00:52:50,740
where everyone's been killed by the 
artillery barrage they punched right 

896
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:54,071
through there.
Their goal is to capture bait.

897
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,480
Remember,
this is a trap.

898
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:03,290
The cheese in the trap has to be 
captured by the Germans before it can 

899
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:06,300
play the role of cheese.
That's what this is all about.

900
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,650
That is,
if you believe,

901
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:09,330
you know,
the standard historical approach,

902
00:53:09,331 --> 00:53:14,331
this quite a few historians who believe 
this whole idea of let's create this 

903
00:53:14,331 --> 00:53:16,710
meat grinder is bs propaganda at the 
time.

904
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:18,300
And um,
you know,

905
00:53:18,301 --> 00:53:20,700
mia culpa avoidance later on,
right?

906
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,550
If you believe that they're not trying 
to capture bait,

907
00:53:23,551 --> 00:53:25,680
they're trying to capture her done 
either way.

908
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:26,010
The

909
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:29,250
point of this initial attack is to get 
the heights.

910
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:35,270
The problem is the Germans find out to a
degree exactly what the French and the 

911
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:36,120
British had found out the whole year 
before,

912
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,780
which is that no matter how good the 
artillery barrage,

913
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:44,970
there are just units that survive.
And then when they strike back at you,

914
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:50,130
it's amazing and the casualties mounted 
up unbelievably fast.

915
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,880
On the very first day as the German 
troops pour into an area and begin to 

916
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,480
coalesce and sort of muster in us in a,
in a specific area,

917
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,310
French artillery opens up on them.
And this is an account by a French staff

918
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:10,311
officer with the artillery who first 
describes what the German artillery 

919
00:54:10,311 --> 00:54:14,421
attack on his positions is like,
and then describes responding in kind 

920
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:18,210
his was one of the few batteries that 
did by the way he writes,

921
00:54:18,211 --> 00:54:23,211
quote,
thousands of projectiles are flying in 

922
00:54:23,211 --> 00:54:23,550
all directions,
some whistling,

923
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:25,530
others howling,
others moaning,

924
00:54:25,531 --> 00:54:30,531
low and all uniting into one infernal 
roar from time to time and Ariel torpedo

925
00:54:30,871 --> 00:54:35,871
passes,
making a noise like a giant motor car 

926
00:54:35,871 --> 00:54:38,960
with a tremendous thud,
a giant shell bursts quite close to our 

927
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,981
observation post,
breaking the telephone wire and 

928
00:54:42,981 --> 00:54:43,290
interrupting all communication with our 
batteries.

929
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:48,560
A man gets out at once for repairs,
crawling along his stomach through all 

930
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:52,260
this place of bursting minds and shells,
it seems quite impossible.

931
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:57,320
He writes that he should escape the rain
of shells which exceeds anything 

932
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:01,281
imaginable.
There has never been such a bombardment 

933
00:55:01,281 --> 00:55:03,741
and war.
Our man seems to be envelops and 

934
00:55:03,741 --> 00:55:06,291
explosions and shelters himself from 
time to time in the shell craters which 

935
00:55:06,291 --> 00:55:07,080
honeycomb the ground.
Finally,

936
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:10,230
he reaches a less stormy spot,
men's his wires,

937
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,990
and then as it would be madness to try 
to return,

938
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:16,440
settles down in a big crater and waits 
for the storm to pass.

939
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:21,390
Now he looks up and sees the German 
assaults.

940
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:26,450
Approaching quote beyond in the valley,
dark masses are moving over the snow 

941
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:31,791
covered ground.
It is German infantry advancing impact 

942
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:32,610
formation along the valley to the 
attack.

943
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,270
They look like a big gray carpet being 
unrolled over the country.

944
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:39,930
We telephone through to the batteries 
and the ball begins.

945
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:44,610
The site is hellish in the distance in 
the valley and upon the slopes,

946
00:55:44,611 --> 00:55:49,170
regimens spread out and as they deploy,
fresh troops come pouring in,

947
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:52,620
there's a whistle over our heads.
It's our first shell.

948
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,380
It falls right in the middle of the 
enemy infantry.

949
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:59,340
We telephone through telling our 
batteries of their hit and a delusion of

950
00:55:59,341 --> 00:56:03,840
heavy shells is poured on the enemy.
Their physician becomes critical through

951
00:56:03,841 --> 00:56:05,340
glasses.
We can see men,

952
00:56:05,341 --> 00:56:09,300
maddened men covered with earth and 
blood falling one upon the other.

953
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,970
When the first wave of the assault is 
decimated,

954
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:14,430
the ground is dotted with heaps of 
corpses,

955
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:17,580
but the second wave is already pressing 
on once more.

956
00:56:17,581 --> 00:56:19,980
Our shells carve awful gaps in their 
ranks.

957
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,260
Nevertheless,
like an army of rats,

958
00:56:22,261 --> 00:56:23,980
the bushes continue to advance in

959
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:27,490
spite of our Mar Mites,
a term the French use for their shells.

960
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:28,570
He says,
quote,

961
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:31,510
than our heavy artillery burst forth.
In theory,

962
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:36,630
the whole valley is turned into a 
volcano and it's exit is stopped by the 

963
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:40,651
barrier of the slain and quote.
That's a foretaste of what's to come 

964
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:47,250
right there.
The Germans have to be on the offensive 

965
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:50,050
for a little while in this battle,
a battle that is probably built upon the

966
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:53,740
presumption that the defense has a huge 
advantage on the offense.

967
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:56,290
This artillery was meant to make up for 
some of that,

968
00:56:56,291 --> 00:57:00,790
but the Germans are taking higher than 
expected losses from minute one.

969
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:03,640
This is a problem too,
because remember,

970
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:08,970
regardless of which historical school 
you adhere to on the point of this 

971
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:12,481
battle,
it was always part of the plan to lose 

972
00:57:12,481 --> 00:57:14,000
as few people as possible.
So the Germans are concerned with losses

973
00:57:14,001 --> 00:57:19,001
and part of the reason they're suffering
so many is the French are resisting 

974
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:20,080
heroically on these first few days.

975
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:25,680
There are units that surrender,
there are units that are just gone from 

976
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,491
the artillery barrage,
but there are units including elite 

977
00:57:29,491 --> 00:57:29,560
ones,
but also rather pedestrian.

978
00:57:29,561 --> 00:57:34,060
One's sitting there and dying to the 
last man to delay this German advance.

979
00:57:34,061 --> 00:57:36,610
These infiltration troops are looking 
for places to push through.

980
00:57:36,611 --> 00:57:41,611
They find a couple,
but they find a bunch with these 

981
00:57:41,611 --> 00:57:44,290
decimated defenders resisting heroically
to buy the country.

982
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:49,291
Time to get fresh troops reinforcing 
that area to that area of Verdun is 

983
00:57:49,481 --> 00:57:52,510
actually supplied on the French side by 
one little teeny road.

984
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:58,590
The Germans had built multiple railway 
lines and their site to supply the 

985
00:57:58,590 --> 00:57:58,590
battlefield.
Right?

986
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:00,040
So as French reinforcements are coming 
up,

987
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:03,880
these heroic defenders are holding the 
Germans off as long as they can.

988
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:09,120
There are more big bombardments that 
Germans push more troops in with more 

989
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,890
tenacity.
On February 25th,

990
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:17,610
the Germans in an almost Indiana Light 
Jones movie kind of drama capture the 

991
00:58:19,241 --> 00:58:20,680
big fort in this region.

992
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:25,680
That's sort of overlooks the whole 
battlefield and we told you that the 

993
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,071
French high command kind of lost 
interest in force after the Germans and 

994
00:58:29,071 --> 00:58:30,490
smashed the ones in Belgium and smash 
the early ones in France,

995
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:33,730
but they still had people in them and 
there were still guns in them and slowly

996
00:58:33,731 --> 00:58:38,731
but surely they were starting to realize
that sometimes and in some places they 

997
00:58:38,731 --> 00:58:38,890
were worth having,
didn't matter.

998
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,250
These troops were in this fort,
which is mostly below ground.

999
00:58:42,251 --> 00:58:47,251
When a German soldier gets blown into it
somehow due to a shell exploding nearby,

1000
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:53,340
lands down on the ground,
has a pistol with him and eventually 

1001
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:57,091
will lead in some friends,
but by and large is walking around this 

1002
00:58:57,091 --> 00:58:58,810
underground giant fort and as he opens 
doors into rooms,

1003
00:58:58,811 --> 00:59:03,811
there's a couple of French soldiers 
playing cards or whatever and he 

1004
00:59:03,811 --> 00:59:06,361
captures them and locked them in a room 
and he does this over and over and over 

1005
00:59:06,361 --> 00:59:07,240
again.
He finally has everybody Kinda captured.

1006
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:12,600
Nobody dies on either side and this 
major feature in the early part of the 

1007
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:17,101
battle falls to the Germans.
It's one of those situations that sort 

1008
00:59:17,501 --> 00:59:22,501
of rocks the French morale and they to 
fall apart.

1009
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:28,810
They've been through eight ton and now 
there's this crisis moment where all of 

1010
00:59:29,571 --> 00:59:32,090
a sudden it looks like the Germans are 
going to break through in the French are

1011
00:59:32,091 --> 00:59:35,330
just going to fall apart before any 
reinforcements can stiffen the line.

1012
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:37,850
This is where things get really wiggy in
this battle.

1013
00:59:37,851 --> 00:59:38,450
By the way,

1014
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:43,680
it gets right down to what the hell.
The point of it is.

1015
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:49,730
If you're a falcon hein and the 
historians who think he's trying to 

1016
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:49,830
create a meat grinder fall,
that's true.

1017
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:53,820
You don't want to break through.
You don't want Verdun.

1018
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:57,480
It's not really what you want.
It's the cheese in your trap.

1019
00:59:57,690 --> 01:00:02,690
If you take it,
then you're just going to get 

1020
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:02,690
counterattack and you're going to lose a
lot of troops again and that then that's

1021
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:03,870
19,
15 all over again.

1022
01:00:03,871 --> 01:00:05,070
What did we do differently?
Right?

1023
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:08,720
If you're from the other school of 
thought though,

1024
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:14,230
the idea of breaking through to Verdun 
at this point is to nearly achieved what

1025
01:00:14,721 --> 01:00:17,360
the whole battle was designed to do 
unexpectedly quickly.

1026
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:22,540
The crown prince who's commanding those 
armies really excited and there's all 

1027
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:22,540
sorts of messages where they say,
Oh,

1028
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:23,050
I will take it.
I mean,

1029
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:28,210
didn't expect it this fast,
but we'll take it and then they get 

1030
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:32,321
within two miles of the city at one 
point and then the French put a new 

1031
01:00:32,321 --> 01:00:36,581
commander in charge.
A guy who will be famous by the way in 

1032
01:00:36,581 --> 01:00:38,350
both world wars for different reasons.
A guy named Pattan

1033
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:41,160
and pitocin becomes,
you know,

1034
01:00:41,161 --> 01:00:46,161
it's so hard to,
to separate the myth from the man when 

1035
01:00:46,161 --> 01:00:46,950
he,
with his connection to Verdun.

1036
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:52,460
But the narrative is that baton gets in 
there and changes the French morale by 

1037
01:00:54,571 --> 01:00:55,680
himself.
Practically.

1038
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,890
There's all these generals traveled with
their own press corps.

1039
01:00:58,891 --> 01:01:03,891
So there's going to be,
this guy is going to have a bunch of 

1040
01:01:03,891 --> 01:01:03,891
people helping to,
to pump up the myth,

1041
01:01:03,891 --> 01:01:06,030
but he's famous for coming to the 
battlefield and you know,

1042
01:01:06,031 --> 01:01:08,730
in these situations where the French 
just look desperate,

1043
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:10,200
you know,
looking at troops and going,

1044
01:01:10,201 --> 01:01:12,600
now we have them.
We got them right where we want them.

1045
01:01:12,601 --> 01:01:13,800
That kind of thing.
And you know,

1046
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:17,040
maybe it's the 19th century mentality,
but that seems to work.

1047
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:20,040
They famously says,
or somebody says for him,

1048
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:22,920
and then he stands behind it.
They shall not pass.

1049
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:25,300
And this becomes the big narrative of 
redundant.

1050
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:30,320
It turns into like a French thermopylae,
but the French aren't going to die to 

1051
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,230
the last man.
They're going to win in the end,

1052
01:01:31,231 --> 01:01:31,770
right?
It's again,

1053
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:34,260
part of this,
this overriding narrative.

1054
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:40,460
Now,
morale is kind of a hard to quantify as 

1055
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:40,460
sort of thing,
hard to measure,

1056
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:41,730
hard to look back in history and prove 
anything.

1057
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:45,900
You don't have to prove the real world 
terrafirma things that Bhutan did.

1058
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:51,140
Buttons and artillery guy,
he's a defensive specialist and the 

1059
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:54,621
first thing he does is bringing his own 
artillery and consolidate it and asked 

1060
01:01:55,071 --> 01:02:00,071
for more and slowly but surely begins to
build up his own meat grinder for two 

1061
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:05,720
can play at that game and Pitocin,
start stocking up the French side with 

1062
01:02:05,881 --> 01:02:10,881
our chiller re to.
And all this artillery turns this entire

1063
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:17,120
area into the moon.
But weirder these shell holes in your 

1064
01:02:19,831 --> 01:02:20,040
head.

1065
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,100
You think of something symmetrical like 
an immediate right crater.

1066
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:26,040
But it doesn't happen that way because 
you get these shell holes,

1067
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:30,090
which can be 30 feet deep with 
absolutely straight up and down edges,

1068
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:33,990
but then they get hit with another shell
at some weird angle or an on an edge and

1069
01:02:33,991 --> 01:02:36,180
then they get hit with another one and 
another one and another one,

1070
01:02:36,181 --> 01:02:39,210
and it turns it into super weird 
formations.

1071
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,670
It still looks weird today.
If you go look at modern pictures of the

1072
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:47,680
verdant battlefield,
it looks totally alien and it creates a 

1073
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:53,331
battlefield.
There's a painting by a Frenchman Larue 

1074
01:02:53,331 --> 01:02:53,331
I think is his name,
called hell,

1075
01:02:53,331 --> 01:02:57,590
and it shows a couple of French soldiers
in one of these craters and a dead body 

1076
01:02:57,811 --> 01:03:02,811
near them and they're wearing gas masks 
and the barrage is going on in giant 

1077
01:03:02,811 --> 01:03:07,011
timbers are part of this enormous crater
and craters everywhere in the distance 

1078
01:03:07,011 --> 01:03:07,011
as far as you look.

1079
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:13,230
We said this is like making war worse 
and these craters are the grossest thing

1080
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:16,290
you can imagine.
I mean really just awful.

1081
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:21,770
They fill with water very quickly.
Every one of them practically with a 

1082
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:22,020
dead body or two in them,
they fill with water.

1083
01:03:22,021 --> 01:03:23,700
There's tons of trash,
tons of stuff.

1084
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:27,210
I'm all kinds of.
I mean they're mostly used as latrines.

1085
01:03:27,211 --> 01:03:28,800
If it's close enough to where you can 
get to them.

1086
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:34,580
The water is fed ID and horrible and 
Greasy from the bloated bodies that 

1087
01:03:34,981 --> 01:03:39,840
float in it and interestingly enough 
poisonous because the gas that's used on

1088
01:03:39,841 --> 01:03:44,841
these battlefields,
I know it's tempting to think of it as 

1089
01:03:44,841 --> 01:03:47,781
vapor,
but it's really almost a solid where 

1090
01:03:47,781 --> 01:03:51,051
when a gas shell explodes,
it covers an entire area with like a 

1091
01:03:51,051 --> 01:03:54,510
pollen like coding and that pollen.
Light coding is deadly,

1092
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:59,840
so it's like putting insecticide on a 
given area to keep you out of it for 

1093
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:00,930
awhile and eventually the rain will come
and dissolve that,

1094
01:04:00,931 --> 01:04:05,931
but the dissolve runoff goes into all 
these shell holes that are filled with 

1095
01:04:05,931 --> 01:04:06,840
water and makes them just poisonous.

1096
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:10,830
There will be a writer who will talk 
about how at first in in the spring,

1097
01:04:10,831 --> 01:04:15,831
the Verdun battlefield,
we'll try to recover a little of its 

1098
01:04:15,831 --> 01:04:18,111
life and they will see little green 
shoots pop up for a minute before the 

1099
01:04:18,111 --> 01:04:20,970
poisonous air and soil and water and 
everything just kills them right away.

1100
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:26,270
It's a giant burnt out insecticide zone.
That's what Verdun is and and the,

1101
01:04:27,731 --> 01:04:32,731
the landscape itself is horrifying to a 
degree that's hard to describe unless 

1102
01:04:33,121 --> 01:04:38,121
you want to say that this is more door.
This is Jrr tolkien's conception of the 

1103
01:04:41,071 --> 01:04:42,270
dark land.
I mean,

1104
01:04:42,271 --> 01:04:45,060
he was in the first world war.
Maybe he got it from there.

1105
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,660
The match is perfect though.
I mean once they start to.

1106
01:04:47,661 --> 01:04:52,661
Hillary has been going for not even that
long at this levels of intensity you 

1107
01:04:52,661 --> 01:04:56,721
have around you on this battlefield and 
we talked about stage and all the people

1108
01:04:57,301 --> 01:05:00,150
merely players will look at this stage.
These people are playing on,

1109
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,100
you know,
very shortly into the battle.

1110
01:05:02,101 --> 01:05:04,410
It's a lunar landscape.
It's the moon.

1111
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:09,740
Okay.
And these trenches are places where 

1112
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:12,921
people meet their end very often.
I mean lots of stories about soldiers 

1113
01:05:12,921 --> 01:05:13,740
with big heavy packs in the night,
losing their way,

1114
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:18,090
falling into one of these terrible 
craters and just

1115
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:23,100
drowning.
The worst stories are these people who 

1116
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:23,100
you know,
you hear stories by people drinking,

1117
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:27,990
kneeling down and drinking out of these 
green colored poisonous waters with 

1118
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:30,370
bodies floating in it because the water 
isn't making it up to the front.

1119
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:35,640
The people whose job it is to bring food
and water to the people on the front 

1120
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,070
edge of the meat grinder are getting 
killed,

1121
01:05:36,071 --> 01:05:39,580
trying to bring it up.
This is a terrible battle.

1122
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:43,660
It's the battle of 1915 taken to the 
next level,

1123
01:05:43,661 --> 01:05:45,190
which is what this war is going to be 
about.

1124
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:48,580
Every time the world thinks they've come
to the limits of their endurance,

1125
01:05:48,581 --> 01:05:50,740
surely this is the worst battle there 
will ever be.

1126
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:55,600
The standard gets up again and this 
happens continually.

1127
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:02,540
It's a pressure cooker.
It's who's going to break first and you 

1128
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:06,471
know you thought last year was bad.
Welcome to next year and while next year

1129
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:11,980
is deadlier and while the scale is more 
and perhaps unsustainably titanic,

1130
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:17,910
the pattern is unfortunately for the 
troops on the ground horrifically 

1131
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:20,590
familiar,
about a week into the assault,

1132
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,530
the German attack at Verdun stalls.

1133
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:28,930
Just like all these other battles we've 
seen in a lot more,

1134
01:06:28,931 --> 01:06:33,931
we will see the initial assault is the 
most tense nail biting up in the air 

1135
01:06:33,931 --> 01:06:36,010
kind of time.
Once it stopped,

1136
01:06:36,011 --> 01:06:38,440
there may be ebbs and flows and scary 
moments,

1137
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:43,740
but by and large we have descended into 
what Churchill call did he say prolonged

1138
01:06:43,751 --> 01:06:48,751
operations or extended operations.
We're now into combat and for the troops

1139
01:06:49,901 --> 01:06:53,890
on the ground,
it's the most horrifying environment.

1140
01:06:53,891 --> 01:06:58,120
When we want to study the idea of what 
human beings can do,

1141
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:00,950
it seems to me you want to see them in 
some of the most.

1142
01:07:00,990 --> 01:07:02,980
If you want to see,
just like a product test,

1143
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:06,160
did you want to put it under the most 
extreme stress and see how it behaves.

1144
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:10,900
Look at what Verdun becomes over the 
next many months.

1145
01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:13,960
For the people on the ground who have to
live this.

1146
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:16,120
How do they endure?

1147
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:20,200
And when you hear the stories from this 
place,

1148
01:07:20,201 --> 01:07:23,440
I mean start with the approach.
March the French,

1149
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:28,770
as we've said,
spend a lot of trouble to rotate their 

1150
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:31,981
troops in and out of this battle because
they get worn down like a pencil and a 

1151
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:33,370
pencil sharpener,
so you have to rotate them.

1152
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:38,650
When the soldiers approach Verdun,
they can see it along way away.

1153
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:43,950
I mean the guns of the opening barrage 
were said to be audible a hundred miles 

1154
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:45,480
away,
so when they're approaching verdant,

1155
01:07:45,481 --> 01:07:48,520
it looks like a giant forest fire in the
distance.

1156
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:54,690
One French soldier on the way to it said
that it reminded him of a gigantic forge

1157
01:07:55,361 --> 01:08:00,361
that ceased neither day or night,
and to quote it's the fires are more 

1158
01:08:00,361 --> 01:08:01,210
door,
like I said,

1159
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:06,870
and then all of a sudden the air becomes
smokey and hazy and you don't see the 

1160
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:09,280
sun clearly anymore and all the 
vegetation disappears.

1161
01:08:09,281 --> 01:08:14,281
One artist said the only color in the 
landscape after a while because it's 

1162
01:08:14,281 --> 01:08:15,800
just overturned dirt and bodies and and

1163
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:19,520
churned up concrete.
It's a hellish environment,

1164
01:08:19,521 --> 01:08:24,521
but there is a smear of red here or 
there where the horses have just been 

1165
01:08:24,521 --> 01:08:25,880
splattered by artillery.
Have I mentioned that?

1166
01:08:25,881 --> 01:08:30,881
It sounds like hell yet.
We mentioned earlier how hard it was to 

1167
01:08:31,601 --> 01:08:34,360
get food and water to the troops 
fighting at the front line,

1168
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:38,410
but it was hard to get anything to the 
troops fighting at the front line,

1169
01:08:38,411 --> 01:08:43,411
for example,
to get new troops to the front line 

1170
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:46,480
could kill off half your troops in his 
book the price of glory.

1171
01:08:46,481 --> 01:08:47,200
Alistair horn

1172
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:53,810
takes a couple of different accounts and
puts them together and quotes a few 

1173
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:57,950
people who were there about what it was 
like simply trying to get to the front 

1174
01:08:57,950 --> 01:09:00,480
of the meat grinder at Verdun.
Imagined suffering in a 40 or 50 percent

1175
01:09:00,481 --> 01:09:03,030
casualties trying to get to the meat 
grinder.

1176
01:09:03,031 --> 01:09:05,640
Here's what he writes.
I'm quote,

1177
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:11,450
a mile or two from the front line.
Troops entered the first communication 

1178
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:15,441
trenches though to call them.
This was generally both an exaggeration 

1179
01:09:15,441 --> 01:09:18,980
and an anachronism.
Parapets gradually grew lower and lower 

1180
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:21,630
until the trench became little deeper 
than a roadside ditch.

1181
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:26,990
Shells now began to fall with increasing
regularity among closely packed men in 

1182
01:09:27,031 --> 01:09:28,530
the darkness.
He says,

1183
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:33,531
for obvious reasons,
approach marches were usually made at 

1184
01:09:33,531 --> 01:09:33,531
night.
The columns trampled over,

1185
01:09:33,531 --> 01:09:35,310
the howling wounded that lay under a 
foot.

1186
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:40,700
Suddenly the trench became nothing more 
than a track hardly traced out amid the 

1187
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:45,141
shell holes in the mud,
which the shelling had now turned to a 

1188
01:09:45,141 --> 01:09:45,510
consistency of sticky butter.

1189
01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:50,690
Troops stumbled and fell repeatedly 
cursing in low undertones as if fearful 

1190
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:54,300
of being overheard by the enemy who 
relentlessly pursued them with uh,

1191
01:09:54,301 --> 01:09:59,301
shells at every step.
Sometimes there were duck boards around 

1192
01:09:59,301 --> 01:10:01,560
the lips of the huge shell craters,
but more often there were not,

1193
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,320
and heavily laden men falling into the 
water.

1194
01:10:04,321 --> 01:10:07,110
Filled holes remained there until they 
drowned,

1195
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:12,240
unable to crawl up the greasy sides.
If a comrade pause to lend a hand,

1196
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:17,330
he writes,
it often meant that too would drowned 

1197
01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:17,890
instead of one in the chaos of the 
battlefield.

1198
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:20,910
We're all reference points had long 
since been obliterated.

1199
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:25,320
Relieving detachments often got lost and
wandered hopelessly all night,

1200
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:29,100
only to be massacred by an enemy.
Machine gunner is dawn betrayed them.

1201
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:34,340
It was not unusual for reliefs to reach 
the front line with only half the 

1202
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:36,630
numbers that set out,
nor for this nightmare approach march to

1203
01:10:36,631 --> 01:10:41,631
last 10 hours or longer.
And quote seems to me,

1204
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:47,520
maybe I can speak for some of my 
generation if I just spent 10 hours 

1205
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:51,880
struggling through that and lost half 
our people while doing so.

1206
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:55,630
Just so I got to take my turn on the 
front lines.

1207
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:58,750
I'm going to be severely

1208
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:01,520
these stabilized,
let's put it that way.

1209
01:11:01,521 --> 01:11:02,720
Is that a good way to describe it?

1210
01:11:04,230 --> 01:11:07,140
And even though these French units will 
be rotated,

1211
01:11:07,141 --> 01:11:09,720
maybe only spent five or six or seven 
days up at the front,

1212
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,570
I mean,
that was designed to keep them from just

1213
01:11:12,571 --> 01:11:17,571
being and being shattered.
But judging from some of the witness 

1214
01:11:17,571 --> 01:11:17,680
accounts,
uh,

1215
01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:22,950
it didn't work very well.
British historian John Keegan delayed 

1216
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:26,790
John Keegan a rights that a French 
officer named Augustine coaching spent 

1217
01:11:27,421 --> 01:11:32,421
from the ninth to the 14th of April on 
one of these important hills and Keegan 

1218
01:11:32,491 --> 01:11:37,491
rights quoting this officer quote,
the last two days soaked in icy mud 

1219
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:43,350
under terrible bombardment without any 
shelter other than the narrowness of the

1220
01:11:43,351 --> 01:11:46,080
trench.
The Bosch did not attack naturally.

1221
01:11:46,081 --> 01:11:50,610
It would have been too stupid result.
I arrived there with 175 men.

1222
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:55,260
I returned with 34 several half mad,
not replying anymore.

1223
01:11:55,261 --> 01:12:00,261
When I spoke to them and quote,
a French lieutenant described watching a

1224
01:12:00,601 --> 01:12:05,601
unit,
his own unit actually coming down and 

1225
01:12:05,601 --> 01:12:06,870
back from Verdun after being relieved 
and he says,

1226
01:12:06,871 --> 01:12:11,871
quote first came the skeletons of 
companies occasionally led by a wounded 

1227
01:12:12,181 --> 01:12:17,181
officer leaning on a stick,
all marched or rather advanced in small 

1228
01:12:17,181 --> 01:12:20,250
steps,
zigzagging as if intoxicated.

1229
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:24,210
It was hard to tell the color of their 
faces from that of their tunics.

1230
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:27,090
Mud had covered,
everything dried off,

1231
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:29,520
and then another layer had been 
reapplied.

1232
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:34,880
They said nothing.
They'd even lost the strength to 

1233
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,491
complain.
It seemed as if these mute faces were 

1234
01:12:37,491 --> 01:12:37,491
crying,
something terrible,

1235
01:12:37,491 --> 01:12:39,690
the unbelievable horror of their 
martyrdom.

1236
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:43,080
Some territorials who were standing near
me became pensive.

1237
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,570
They had that air of sadness that comes 
over.

1238
01:12:45,571 --> 01:12:50,571
One one,
a funeral passes by and I overheard one 

1239
01:12:50,571 --> 01:12:53,871
say it's no longer an army.
Those are corpses to have the 

1240
01:12:53,871 --> 01:12:57,990
territorials wept in silence like women 
and to quote,

1241
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:04,370
so what's going on to those guys that 
they go in one way and they come out so 

1242
01:13:05,251 --> 01:13:08,940
shattered and sometimes it only takes a 
couple of days to go from one reality to

1243
01:13:08,941 --> 01:13:13,941
the other.
That's where you know these firsthand 

1244
01:13:13,941 --> 01:13:15,240
accounts from these people are so 
moving.

1245
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,360
First of all,
from the perspective of these men on the

1246
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:23,361
ground,
everything seems so pointless because 

1247
01:13:23,361 --> 01:13:25,730
they only know this little world of this
big battlefield they're operating on and

1248
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:29,970
a perfect example is how you know these 
generals were now fighting over the same

1249
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:35,150
terrain,
features over and over and over month 

1250
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:37,731
after month after month.
They take them and then they're retaken 

1251
01:13:37,731 --> 01:13:40,240
and then they take them again and 
they're all fighting over the same 

1252
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:40,240
carnage,
stained ground over and over again,

1253
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:41,560
and they develop names.
I mean,

1254
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:43,560
one of these hills is hill three.
Oh,

1255
01:13:43,561 --> 01:13:48,561
four becomes a famous hill with a lot of
people paying with their lives to take 

1256
01:13:48,561 --> 01:13:53,451
it and retake it again.
There's another one known as the dead 

1257
01:13:53,451 --> 01:13:55,440
man or dead man's hills and other way to
translate it.

1258
01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:57,560
And that's another one of these hills.
Um,

1259
01:13:57,690 --> 01:14:01,110
I mean they've had the tops blasted all 
off them by both sides.

1260
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:05,040
Artillery there smoking like volcanoes 
pretty much at all times.

1261
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:10,280
We're told sort of a dual mount doom if 
we want to keep our more door analogy 

1262
01:14:10,471 --> 01:14:15,040
going.
And when a unit retakes a position on,

1263
01:14:15,041 --> 01:14:20,041
for example,
one of those long fought over terrain 

1264
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:21,400
features,
then you have that around you.

1265
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:22,960
I mean,
for example,

1266
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:27,970
I'm in passing him has several quotes 
where he talks about soldiers having to 

1267
01:14:28,961 --> 01:14:33,961
retake this ground that are nothing more
than sort of open cemeteries combined 

1268
01:14:35,681 --> 01:14:37,390
with butcher shops.
And he writes,

1269
01:14:37,391 --> 01:14:40,180
quote on the ground,
soldier and writers,

1270
01:14:40,181 --> 01:14:43,240
Jack Meyer describes the real 
rightfulness when he noted,

1271
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:48,360
quote everywhere there were distended 
bodies that your feet sank into the 

1272
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:53,281
stench of death,
hung over the jumble of decaying corpse 

1273
01:14:53,281 --> 01:14:55,570
is like some hellish perfume and quote,
passing him continues quote,

1274
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:57,520
when the Germans captured hill three,
oh,

1275
01:14:57,521 --> 01:15:02,521
four in May,
one of the first demands of the assault 

1276
01:15:02,521 --> 01:15:04,780
troops was for a double ration of 
tobacco to mask the overwhelming reek of

1277
01:15:04,781 --> 01:15:08,540
corpses routing around them.
Like Jacques Meyer,

1278
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:11,470
a fellow French soldier wrote at this 
time that quote,

1279
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:16,740
quoting this French soldier now,
we all had on us the stench of dead 

1280
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:17,740
bodies,
the bread we ate,

1281
01:15:17,741 --> 01:15:22,741
the stagnant water.
We drank everything we touched how to 

1282
01:15:22,741 --> 01:15:25,681
rotten smell,
owing to the fact that the earth around 

1283
01:15:25,681 --> 01:15:26,740
us was literally stuffed with corpses.
And quote,

1284
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:29,980
how do you not lose your mind?

1285
01:15:32,030 --> 01:15:37,030
French barrel maker and Corporal Louis 
Bartos arrives at the famous hill three,

1286
01:15:38,001 --> 01:15:43,001
oh four at one point in this bottle and 
looks up and contemplates this piece of 

1287
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:48,490
ground that is cost.
So many people on both sides there,

1288
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,840
earthly existence.
He writes,

1289
01:15:50,841 --> 01:15:55,841
quote,
I looked out upon this famous nameless 

1290
01:15:55,841 --> 01:15:58,841
hill,
our trench lay at the foot of it for 

1291
01:15:58,841 --> 01:16:01,391
several months.
The hell had been disputed as if it had 

1292
01:16:01,391 --> 01:16:01,391
diamond mines on it slopes,
alas,

1293
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:05,000
all it contained now with thousands of 
shredded pulverized corpses.

1294
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:07,550
Nothing distinguished it from 
neighboring hills.

1295
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:09,950
It seemed to have been partly wooded at 
one time,

1296
01:16:09,951 --> 01:16:13,760
but no trace of vegetation remained.
The convulsed overturned.

1297
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:17,310
Earth offered nothing but a spectacle of
devastation and quote.

1298
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:22,290
Now eventually in for reasons that we'll
get into in a minute,

1299
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:27,380
the situation changes at for Don and the
Germans go from essentially a sort of an

1300
01:16:27,721 --> 01:16:32,721
offensive position to a defensive one as
they transfer forces to another part of 

1301
01:16:33,421 --> 01:16:35,660
their front for something else that's 
going on,

1302
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:40,700
taking their attention and so the French
use this as an opportunity to retake 

1303
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:45,141
ground and now we get the same kind of 
battles we had when the Germans were 

1304
01:16:45,141 --> 01:16:49,311
moving forward in this.
Now that the French are and now the 

1305
01:16:49,311 --> 01:16:49,311
Germans had taken a bunch of their 
artillery away.

1306
01:16:49,311 --> 01:16:54,040
So now the French have the artillery 
dominance and now the Germans get to 

1307
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:55,410
experience what the French experienced 
on the other side and you know,

1308
01:16:55,411 --> 01:17:00,411
nine or 10 months into this battle,
we have human beings living on the edge 

1309
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:03,540
of what human beings can tolerate.
There's an extended,

1310
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:08,950
a pair of quotes from the same guy,
a German soldier who is in of these 

1311
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:11,330
faults and these faults.

1312
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:13,370
They're all over this area.
This is a fortified zone.

1313
01:17:13,371 --> 01:17:18,371
They have several Ford's covering one 
another and a lot of the most terrible 

1314
01:17:18,371 --> 01:17:21,071
battles happen over these forts and 
they're battered down so that they're 

1315
01:17:21,071 --> 01:17:25,361
just shells of what they were,
but they could still hold hundreds of 

1316
01:17:25,361 --> 01:17:28,301
men and protect them from shrapnel.
So oftentimes you had tons of men in 

1317
01:17:28,301 --> 01:17:31,760
these underground blown up forts with 
blood everywhere and everything else.

1318
01:17:32,330 --> 01:17:36,140
And here's the way the environment is 
described by this German soldier quote.

1319
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,020
His name is private William Harmon's,
by the way,

1320
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:42,620
of the 67th infantry regiment.
And I get this from Peter Hart's book,

1321
01:17:42,621 --> 01:17:44,450
the Great War.
He said,

1322
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:49,451
quote,
the entrance was a mere hole in the 

1323
01:17:49,451 --> 01:17:51,830
scarred battlefield and the silhouettes 
of cowering men constantly crawling into

1324
01:17:51,831 --> 01:17:56,831
rod looked like huge ants in the dark.
I descended an iron ladder some 40 feet 

1325
01:17:57,051 --> 01:17:58,640
into the concrete cavern.

1326
01:17:58,850 --> 01:18:02,390
It was an enormous place,
crowded with many hundreds of soldiers.

1327
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:04,280
Some lay on bunk,
sleeping,

1328
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:09,400
snoring and moaning,
some cluttered the passages between the 

1329
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:09,680
bunks,
chatting or writing letters,

1330
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:14,030
other set or Nelton corners,
packing or unpacking their belongings.

1331
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:15,560
Here,
a flashlight there,

1332
01:18:15,561 --> 01:18:20,561
a candle match your cigarette,
dotted the dark with flickering islands 

1333
01:18:20,561 --> 01:18:24,251
of light continually shifting and 
brightness from this subterranean 

1334
01:18:24,251 --> 01:18:28,300
stronghold.
A small patch of sky could be seen when 

1335
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:31,661
one stood close to the iron ladder or 
look through the shaft which contained 

1336
01:18:31,661 --> 01:18:34,970
the ventilator fans occurrent of warm,
stale air from 40 feet beneath,

1337
01:18:34,971 --> 01:18:38,750
brought to my nostrils the sickening 
smell of first aid medications.

1338
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:42,230
Every one of the chicken wire births 
were filled with mutilated,

1339
01:18:42,231 --> 01:18:43,040
muddy,
torn,

1340
01:18:43,041 --> 01:18:45,710
and befallen uniforms.
A dismal site.

1341
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:50,000
There was a man with closed eyes,
a blood soaked bandage around his head,

1342
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:52,520
another beside him lay twisting in pain.

1343
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:55,730
I saw some lights written.
Men who would scratch their bandages off

1344
01:18:55,731 --> 01:19:00,731
to ease the itching.
The passages between the bunks were 

1345
01:19:00,731 --> 01:19:03,521
crowded.
There must have been a thousand men 

1346
01:19:03,521 --> 01:19:03,521
there,
some had been relieved,

1347
01:19:03,521 --> 01:19:07,450
but could not withdraw to the rear and 
some who had come to relieve the others 

1348
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:10,901
could not proceed to the front lines.
All were imprisoned deep within the 

1349
01:19:10,901 --> 01:19:12,200
concrete and rock entrails and the 
quote.

1350
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:18,490
Now,
that's a scene that up until that point 

1351
01:19:18,490 --> 01:19:20,150
could have happened in a lot of wars.
What happens next in that underground 

1352
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:25,540
environment that that soldiers writing 
from is something that on a large scale 

1353
01:19:26,210 --> 01:19:29,420
between great powers only happened in 
this war.

1354
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:30,830
He says,
quote,

1355
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:34,070
I heard the cry,
poison gas,

1356
01:19:34,190 --> 01:19:36,710
and I saw people around me putting on 
their gas masks.

1357
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:39,740
I adjusted mine,
which still hung over my shoulder.

1358
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:43,730
There it was a yellowish gas glimmering 
near the iron ladder.

1359
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:46,850
A gas bomb must have been thrown into 
the entrance shaft.

1360
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:52,090
The CRI gas masks on electrified.
The whole shelter soldiers ran to get 

1361
01:19:52,431 --> 01:19:57,431
their masks,
which they had hung on the walls and in 

1362
01:19:57,431 --> 01:20:00,071
the corners or laid on their packs.
Many who had lost their is on the 

1363
01:20:00,071 --> 01:20:00,071
battlefield,
began to cough,

1364
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:05,350
the wounded in the bunks tried to climb 
into the upper births while beneath the 

1365
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:08,040
gas crept forward along its way,
extinguishing candle.

1366
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:13,040
After another,
soon many were dying and the bunks and 

1367
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,910
floors were filled with bodies over 
which the living stepped and stumbled in

1368
01:20:14,911 --> 01:20:19,911
search of air.
The alarm surge like away from bunk to 

1369
01:20:19,911 --> 01:20:23,361
bunk.
Before long it had reached the farthest 

1370
01:20:23,361 --> 01:20:25,671
man 100 yards away.
The panic was so great that I saw badly 

1371
01:20:25,671 --> 01:20:29,511
wounded men throw themselves onto the 
floor as though they wanted to drink in 

1372
01:20:29,511 --> 01:20:31,800
the gas while others tour the masks from
their neighbors faces.

1373
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:35,600
Some had a reddish foam oozing from 
their mouths and quote.

1374
01:20:37,070 --> 01:20:42,070
I always try to remind myself when we're
talking about these big grand battles 

1375
01:20:42,530 --> 01:20:46,400
that what this really is is a million 
stories like that.

1376
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:52,030
The pain of that incident magnified over
the entire scope of the war.

1377
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:56,470
And while I'm sure there's some people 
who are harder than I am in terms of,

1378
01:20:56,730 --> 01:21:01,730
you know,
saying that that's life and that's what 

1379
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:01,730
history is filled with and all those 
kinds of things.

1380
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:04,890
It's hard not to sit there and feel a 
sense of all.

1381
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:10,220
I think for the people who faced this 
and not out of any sort of patriotic,

1382
01:21:11,881 --> 01:21:13,710
you know,
glorification of war or anything else,

1383
01:21:14,130 --> 01:21:19,130
as I said,
just sort of the unexpectedly strong 

1384
01:21:19,130 --> 01:21:19,470
limits of human endurance.

1385
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:24,810
How did they sustain this effort?
How did they,

1386
01:21:24,811 --> 01:21:29,811
when told they had to advance into this 
or just not run away at top speed.

1387
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:35,511
How did they do it?
And let's acknowledge that not all of 

1388
01:21:35,511 --> 01:21:38,271
them did.
There were a lot of people shot in this 

1389
01:21:38,271 --> 01:21:42,750
war for running away,
but the large majority of them did not.

1390
01:21:42,751 --> 01:21:44,550
And you sit there and go,
how did they not rebel?

1391
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:47,220
How did they not revolt?
What would we do today?

1392
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:52,780
There's a great quote from a f Scott 
Fitzgerald novel.

1393
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:58,050
It's fictional,
but he puts words into the mouth of a 

1394
01:21:58,050 --> 01:22:01,411
man who showing one of these 1916 
battlefields to his compatriots there 

1395
01:22:01,901 --> 01:22:06,901
touring the battlefield and he has a 
discussion with him and he tries to 

1396
01:22:06,901 --> 01:22:09,991
explain to them the almost soup that was
required to bring up a generation of 

1397
01:22:14,201 --> 01:22:16,390
people who could do this.
In other words,

1398
01:22:16,690 --> 01:22:20,350
it's not just yours truly wondering how 
people sustain this effort.

1399
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:25,710
Even right after the war,
people were trying to figure out how 

1400
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:29,580
people could do this and here's the 
section from the f Scott Fitzgerald 

1401
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:34,051
novel where Fitzgerald character 
explains it and he points in the 

1402
01:22:34,051 --> 01:22:36,710
distance to a little body of water and 
says,

1403
01:22:36,711 --> 01:22:38,800
quote,
see that little stream?

1404
01:22:39,070 --> 01:22:44,070
We could walk to it in two minutes.
It took the British a month to walk to 

1405
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:46,120
it.
A whole empire walking very slowly,

1406
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:51,390
dying in front and pushing forward 
behind and another empire walked very 

1407
01:22:51,461 --> 01:22:54,100
slowly backward,
a few inches a day,

1408
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:56,980
leaving the dead like a million bloody 
rugs.

1409
01:22:57,250 --> 01:23:02,250
No Europeans will ever do that again in 
this generation and the other character 

1410
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:02,920
says,
why?

1411
01:23:02,921 --> 01:23:06,430
They've only just quit over in Turkey 
and in Morocco.

1412
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:10,270
The response quote,
that's different,

1413
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:13,270
this western front business couldn't be 
done again,

1414
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:16,300
not for a long time.
The young men think they could do it,

1415
01:23:16,301 --> 01:23:19,390
but they couldn't.
They could fight the first modern again,

1416
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:24,510
but not this.
This took religion and years of plenty 

1417
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:28,740
and tremendous sureties and the exact 
relation that existed between the 

1418
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:32,881
classes.
The Russians and Italians weren't good 

1419
01:23:32,881 --> 01:23:34,000
on this front.
You had to have a whole sold sentimental

1420
01:23:34,001 --> 01:23:36,520
equipment going back further than you 
could remember.

1421
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:41,760
You had to remember Christmas and 
postcards of the crown prince and his 

1422
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:45,601
fiance and little cafes and valance and 
beer gardens and entertain Linden and 

1423
01:23:46,211 --> 01:23:50,830
weddings at the Murray and going to the 
Derby and your grandfather's whiskers.

1424
01:23:51,970 --> 01:23:55,060
General grant invented this kind of 
battle at Petersburg.

1425
01:23:55,061 --> 01:24:00,061
In 65 came the reply,
meaning general grant in the civil war 

1426
01:24:00,061 --> 01:24:00,061
in 18,
65,

1427
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,170
the main character says quote.
No,

1428
01:24:02,171 --> 01:24:04,930
he didn't.
He just invented mass butchery.

1429
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:10,140
This kind of battle was invented by 
Lewis Carroll and Jules Verne and 

1430
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:14,701
whoever wrote Ondine and country deacons
bowling and Marianne's in Marsay and 

1431
01:24:16,121 --> 01:24:19,320
girls seduced in the back lanes of 
Wittenberg and Westphalia.

1432
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:19,960
Why?

1433
01:24:20,290 --> 01:24:25,290
This was a love battle.
There was a century of middleclass love 

1434
01:24:25,290 --> 01:24:28,991
spent here and quote a century of middle
class love spent here that is profound 

1435
01:24:33,161 --> 01:24:35,960
and that's how the generation that lived
through this war side,

1436
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:40,330
so basically fitzgerald answer to that 
question of,

1437
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:45,750
you know,
how did these people endure is that you 

1438
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:48,541
had to have grown up the way they did 
with the same cultural influences and 

1439
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:53,071
expectations,
including societal and class based ones 

1440
01:24:53,071 --> 01:24:54,430
either had to have seen the world the 
way they did,

1441
01:24:54,431 --> 01:24:57,190
had similar concepts of,
you know,

1442
01:24:57,191 --> 01:25:02,191
duty and expectations and even manhood 
and you'd have to have in some ways the 

1443
01:25:05,591 --> 01:25:10,591
same illusions to because in certain 
circumstances having illusions could 

1444
01:25:12,851 --> 01:25:17,851
help you carry out military operations 
that people who were more cynical and 

1445
01:25:18,881 --> 01:25:22,840
realistic would never do.
And you know,

1446
01:25:22,841 --> 01:25:27,841
when you think about the endurance to.
I mean it's so normal to focus on the 

1447
01:25:27,841 --> 01:25:27,841
horrific war side of this.

1448
01:25:28,150 --> 01:25:33,150
But the simple life part of this is 
sometimes what pushes people over the 

1449
01:25:33,150 --> 01:25:33,280
edge.
You know,

1450
01:25:33,281 --> 01:25:35,590
you'll hear stories sometimes were they 
will say,

1451
01:25:35,591 --> 01:25:38,320
well,
they were able to adapt to the shelling.

1452
01:25:38,321 --> 01:25:40,300
They just couldn't handle the rats or 
something.

1453
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:44,230
Something gets to them sometimes above 
and beyond what you might think.

1454
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:49,440
I mean,
a perfect example is start looking at 

1455
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,721
what day to day life was like for these 
people who any of us would think we're 

1456
01:25:51,721 --> 01:25:56,281
focused on staying alive,
but sometimes it got down to even more 

1457
01:25:56,281 --> 01:26:00,120
base level than that.
Louis Bartos fighting in the Verdun 

1458
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:03,680
inferno writes about at night being in 
one of trenches.

1459
01:26:03,681 --> 01:26:04,190
When the rain

1460
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:05,540
just comes pouring down,
he says,

1461
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:10,541
quote,
we were crouching down so it's not to 

1462
01:26:10,541 --> 01:26:10,820
catch a stray bullet or shell fragment 
passing by,

1463
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:14,420
and if this weren't bad enough,
a heavy rain started to fall.

1464
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:19,630
It didn't take long for the water to 
fill in the ditch and to submerge our 

1465
01:26:19,630 --> 01:26:23,261
shoes.
Our helmets were transformed into drain 

1466
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:26,111
spouts.
Little waterfalls ran down our packs 

1467
01:26:26,111 --> 01:26:26,480
onto our hips,
off our shoulders and along our arms.

1468
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,780
We didn't know what or whom we were 
waiting for.

1469
01:26:29,930 --> 01:26:34,930
The night was pitch black where they 
just going to leave us stuck in the 

1470
01:26:34,930 --> 01:26:34,930
sewer

1471
01:26:34,930 --> 01:26:35,320
and quote.

1472
01:26:36,850 --> 01:26:41,850
Sewer is such an apt name too,
besides the bodies and the poison and 

1473
01:26:41,850 --> 01:26:45,070
the decay and the lice and the rats have
not even dealt with them.

1474
01:26:45,071 --> 01:26:48,430
They're both absolutely beyond 
imagination.

1475
01:26:48,431 --> 01:26:49,960
Living with the lions,
living with the rats.

1476
01:26:50,290 --> 01:26:55,030
You also have the problems of men 
fighting in an inferno.

1477
01:26:55,031 --> 01:27:00,031
We're getting out of your trench meant a
pretty good chance of dying when you 

1478
01:27:00,031 --> 01:27:01,690
have to go to the bathroom.
Louis parked us writes quote,

1479
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:04,690
and to make it worse,
as I've already described,

1480
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,470
all of us,
one after the other,

1481
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:09,280
suffered from an epidemic of intestinal 
disorders.

1482
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,680
The resulting diarrhea sure cleaned us 
out,

1483
01:27:11,890 --> 01:27:16,890
but in opportunity,
as soon as one of us got over at his 

1484
01:27:16,890 --> 01:27:19,681
next door,
neighbor was afflicted with it and had 

1485
01:27:19,681 --> 01:27:20,650
the bad luck to have to climb out of the
trench and head for the shell hole which

1486
01:27:20,651 --> 01:27:22,570
served as our latrine.
Of course,

1487
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:25,960
we did this only in the last resort at 
the last moment of agony,

1488
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:28,390
stretching our guts until they were 
about to burst.

1489
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:33,660
One of us was surprised in the latrine 
by one of these sudden fusel aids and 

1490
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:37,561
collapsed into his own excrement.
So as not to expose oneself to similar 

1491
01:27:37,561 --> 01:27:40,780
incidents,
some used sardine or monkey meat cans as

1492
01:27:40,781 --> 01:27:42,910
chamber pots,
so it was not to have to leave.

1493
01:27:42,911 --> 01:27:47,911
One's hold in the ground,
won't even sacrificed his cast iron 

1494
01:27:47,911 --> 01:27:47,911
dinner plate

1495
01:27:48,030 --> 01:27:51,840
end quote.
How do you keep your sanity?

1496
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:55,490
You have to risk your life to I'm in the
whole thing again.

1497
01:27:55,491 --> 01:27:57,080
Ellen,
in Lincolnshire Battlefield,

1498
01:27:57,081 --> 01:28:02,081
there might've been one horrible day 
where if you're unlucky enough to have 

1499
01:28:02,081 --> 01:28:03,110
dysentery that day,
it's a horrible day in the ranks.

1500
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:05,180
It isn't a day after day after day 
thing.

1501
01:28:05,181 --> 01:28:08,540
These people are putting up with a 
pounding on their psyche,

1502
01:28:09,990 --> 01:28:14,990
but understanding what they went through
is in large part what makes this story 

1503
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:18,890
so incredibly compelling.
The extremes of human experience,

1504
01:28:18,891 --> 01:28:20,270
right?
I talk about it all the time.

1505
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:25,130
There's a wonderful paragraph by 
historian Eric Dorn,

1506
01:28:25,131 --> 01:28:30,131
Bros who tries to describe why this 
isn't gratuitous to talk about this,

1507
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:35,920
why it's part of being astounded by your
ancestors.

1508
01:28:37,210 --> 01:28:37,620
Here's what

1509
01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:38,830
Bros says,

1510
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:39,590
quote,

1511
01:28:40,770 --> 01:28:45,770
most historians today depart from the 
traditional practice of omitting 

1512
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:49,521
casualty figures.
What was once left out for respect of 

1513
01:28:49,521 --> 01:28:53,001
the dead and to avoid any indecent hint 
of criticizing or questioning the 

1514
01:28:53,001 --> 01:28:56,961
sacrifices they made is now included in 
order to eliminate the magnitude of the 

1515
01:28:56,961 --> 01:29:00,420
horror men faced by citing numbers.
In other words,

1516
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:05,630
historians the process of turning back 
towards describing what war was really 

1517
01:29:05,630 --> 01:29:10,131
like,
and they do this despite the 

1518
01:29:10,131 --> 01:29:12,351
understandable loading of the veterans 
themselves to remember or speak about 

1519
01:29:12,351 --> 01:29:16,671
traumatic experiences they have tried 
usually unsuccessfully to suppress the 

1520
01:29:16,861 --> 01:29:19,380
problems historians encounter with 
casualty figures.

1521
01:29:19,381 --> 01:29:24,381
However,
especially the astronomical numbers of 

1522
01:29:24,381 --> 01:29:27,201
dead and wounded in 20th century wars is
that numbers have a numbing quality to 

1523
01:29:27,201 --> 01:29:29,160
them.
Although shocking to read initially,

1524
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:34,370
they quickly lose descriptive 
effectiveness as mines fail to grasp 

1525
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:38,601
horror in the abstract,
in order to do historical justice to 

1526
01:29:38,601 --> 01:29:38,601
combat on the ground.

1527
01:29:38,601 --> 01:29:41,220
Therefore,
it is necessary to go beyond the numbers

1528
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:46,430
to the gruesome eyewitness accounts,
shaking off criticism that to go there 

1529
01:29:46,430 --> 01:29:50,811
is gratuitous.
The Great War can only be fully 

1530
01:29:50,811 --> 01:29:50,811
understood if all its aspects are 
exposed.

1531
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:56,090
Dimensions of the front experience that 
not only affected soldiers' morale and 

1532
01:29:56,090 --> 01:30:00,501
eventually the outcome of the war,
but also home fronts and they are 

1533
01:30:00,501 --> 01:30:02,340
critically important to willingness to 
continue shouldering the war effort.

1534
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:07,740
All wars are horrible.
Bros writes tragedies for the dead,

1535
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:12,980
their relatives and friends hobbling,
sometimes disfiguring injuries for 

1536
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:13,500
others,
turning wives,

1537
01:30:13,530 --> 01:30:18,530
children and parents and the caregivers 
for life and psychological mind fields 

1538
01:30:18,530 --> 01:30:20,490
for veterans who may have escaped death 
and injury,

1539
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:24,720
but not the terrible memories with which
loved ones too are then forced to live.

1540
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:27,660
The Great War was especially helacious.
However,

1541
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:32,840
because it was the first to unleash the 
full mechanized fury of sophisticated 

1542
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:37,251
industrial technology and quote,
men had never been asked to endure 

1543
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:45,500
anything quite like this.
Some of these French soldiers had to go 

1544
01:30:47,401 --> 01:30:51,030
back to verdun more than one time.
What does that do to you?

1545
01:30:51,090 --> 01:30:56,090
I read somewhere where one of them said 
the first time you can kind of handle 

1546
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:56,090
because you don't know what you're in 
for.

1547
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:59,871
It's particularly hard when you're going
back to more door after you've been to 

1548
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:02,961
more door,
so happy to have survived and now you 

1549
01:31:02,961 --> 01:31:02,961
get to take your chances all over again,

1550
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:09,360
so the majority of the French army gets 
a chance to rotate through this area at 

1551
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:09,400
least once and they never get over.
It.

1552
01:31:10,210 --> 01:31:15,210
Pattan himself will say about the Verdun
experienced to the French army quote,

1553
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:20,880
the constant visions of death had 
penetrated the French soldier with a 

1554
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,590
resignation that bordered on fatalism 
and quote,

1555
01:31:26,150 --> 01:31:30,650
the fighting wind end for 10 months.
About half that time the Germans were on

1556
01:31:30,651 --> 01:31:35,651
the attack.
The other half the time the French were 

1557
01:31:35,651 --> 01:31:35,651
on the attack and by the time it was 
over,

1558
01:31:35,651 --> 01:31:38,480
this is disputed,
but about a million total casualties.

1559
01:31:38,481 --> 01:31:41,630
Both sides added up together,
give or take 200,000.

1560
01:31:41,631 --> 01:31:46,631
Either way at the end of the war,
it will be mandated in the treaty that 

1561
01:31:49,041 --> 01:31:51,950
win.
This battle field is cleared and it will

1562
01:31:51,951 --> 01:31:55,100
take decades just to get the bodies off 
of it.

1563
01:31:55,130 --> 01:31:59,560
The shells are still there and many of 
these areas are cordoned off until,

1564
01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:00,220
well,
probably

1565
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:02,080
a good 100,
200 years from now.

1566
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:06,130
I'm the treaty stipulated that when 
French bodies were dug up and buried,

1567
01:32:06,131 --> 01:32:10,540
they needed to be buried singularly and 
with white crosses for purity.

1568
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:16,050
The Germans didn't have to be in a 
single grave and their graves were to 

1569
01:32:16,050 --> 01:32:20,851
carry black crosses signifying shame.
The depth of emotion that Verdun created

1570
01:32:26,461 --> 01:32:31,461
in the immediate post war generation,
but even in France today is unlike quite

1571
01:32:31,770 --> 01:32:36,770
any other military endevor French arms 
have participated in

1572
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:44,320
and the mythmaking about this crazy 
battle starts before the fighting's even

1573
01:32:44,321 --> 01:32:49,321
done and there's a whole group of 
revisionist historians who've been 

1574
01:32:49,321 --> 01:32:53,851
trying ever since the battle happened to
poke holes in the myths that obscure the

1575
01:32:54,191 --> 01:32:59,191
reality of her done.
It's got such a sacred hold on both 

1576
01:32:59,191 --> 01:33:01,390
France and Germany.
It's hard to separate the facts from the

1577
01:33:01,391 --> 01:33:06,391
fiction and there's a huge amount of 
heroism and sacrifice connected to this 

1578
01:33:06,391 --> 01:33:07,540
event.
It's understandable that you would get,

1579
01:33:08,030 --> 01:33:13,030
you know,
some mythmaking and the revisionist 

1580
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:14,200
historians often portray Falcon high and
the German commander.

1581
01:33:14,201 --> 01:33:15,940
And the one behind this plan as an 
idiot,

1582
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:21,280
it was dumb plan executed in competently
and after the war,

1583
01:33:21,281 --> 01:33:22,690
when people went to Falcon,
heightened said,

1584
01:33:22,691 --> 01:33:24,100
what were you thinking there?
He said,

1585
01:33:24,270 --> 01:33:25,600
oh,
I was trying to kill a lot of people.

1586
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:30,780
That was my goal.
Mission accomplished a lot of these 

1587
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:30,780
revisionist historians.

1588
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:34,360
I'm Paul Koski is a perfect example.
We'll say something like,

1589
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:38,950
to make verdun out to be any worse than 
any number of terrible world war one.

1590
01:33:38,951 --> 01:33:40,540
Battles is to play into the myth.
I mean,

1591
01:33:40,541 --> 01:33:40,990
he says,
if,

1592
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:45,820
if being in a trench with the rain 
falling on you with your feet up to your

1593
01:33:45,821 --> 01:33:50,821
knees in mud under shell fire and sniper
fire day after day is terrible.

1594
01:33:51,371 --> 01:33:56,371
While there's plenty of first world war 
battles where as a soldier you would 

1595
01:33:56,371 --> 01:33:56,650
have found yourself in that situation 
with bodies all around.

1596
01:33:56,651 --> 01:33:58,840
I mean that's not that abnormal in the 
first world war.

1597
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:01,120
And they're right about that too.
But you know,

1598
01:34:01,270 --> 01:34:06,010
maybe it's fairer to say that there are 
several really unbelievably horrible and

1599
01:34:06,011 --> 01:34:09,850
unprecedented battles in the first world
war that are equally hellacious.

1600
01:34:09,851 --> 01:34:11,530
And you would not want to be at any of 
them.

1601
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:16,660
They each have their own awful unique 
flavor to them that makes them different

1602
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:19,180
and nothing smells quite like for done.

1603
01:34:19,570 --> 01:34:24,570
And if you said to me,
you have to be at one of these horrible 

1604
01:34:24,570 --> 01:34:26,910
battlefields for Dunn is the lowest on 
my list for Dunn is the last place out 

1605
01:34:27,131 --> 01:34:31,780
of all of them that I want to be.
If you ask what Verdun achieved,

1606
01:34:31,870 --> 01:34:36,870
again,
there's a wide variety of opinions on 

1607
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:40,651
this.
The most popular is that it achieved 

1608
01:34:40,651 --> 01:34:43,021
nothing.
One of the broad symbols of the general 

1609
01:34:43,021 --> 01:34:46,741
wastefulness of this war,
about a million people either are killed

1610
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:52,590
or wounded or you know,
have never returned from that 

1611
01:34:52,590 --> 01:34:54,840
battlefield and nothing of huge 
importance.

1612
01:34:54,850 --> 01:34:59,600
It was gained because of that one thing 
that certainly did happen as it moved up

1613
01:34:59,601 --> 01:35:04,601
the timetable for several other battles 
that we're going to happen a little bit 

1614
01:35:04,601 --> 01:35:08,951
later.
But when the French got pressed by the 

1615
01:35:08,951 --> 01:35:10,601
Germans have ridden,
they said the British and they send to 

1616
01:35:10,601 --> 01:35:10,601
the Russians.

1617
01:35:10,601 --> 01:35:10,601
You know those battles you were planning
on starting.

1618
01:35:10,610 --> 01:35:12,890
Could you move up the timetable and 
start them sooner?

1619
01:35:13,070 --> 01:35:16,910
We could use the help over here and 
finally,

1620
01:35:17,630 --> 01:35:20,150
the one thing in 1916 you're beginning 
to see,

1621
01:35:20,151 --> 01:35:24,620
and we've alluded to this before,
is that these people have put up already

1622
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:28,610
with a lot more pounding than we would 
probably put up with today,

1623
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:32,930
but there's a breaking point for all 
human beings in my mind.

1624
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:38,350
The breaking point that's coming was 
quickened by the experience at Verdun 

1625
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:44,440
and we'd mentioned that the French had a
policy of rotating troops during the 

1626
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:47,831
battle to keep them fresh at Verdun,
but what that meant was virtually the 

1627
01:35:48,201 --> 01:35:50,570
entire French army at one time or 
another,

1628
01:35:50,810 --> 01:35:54,800
was rotated through that sector for 
done,

1629
01:35:55,520 --> 01:36:00,520
took the French and ratcheted up the 
discontent levels in ways that were 

1630
01:36:01,251 --> 01:36:06,251
probably out of proportion to what you 
could have expected from a more normal 

1631
01:36:06,251 --> 01:36:06,251
battle.

1632
01:36:06,251 --> 01:36:10,000
It got you closer to the breaking point.
The idea of pushing your adversary to 

1633
01:36:12,261 --> 01:36:17,261
the point where their society literally 
implodes is a thoroughly modern idea.

1634
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:23,440
By 1916,
most of the military leaders in this 

1635
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:26,120
conflict see that as the end game in 
this conflict.

1636
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:30,140
The reason it's a thoroughly modern 
concept isn't because people of the past

1637
01:36:30,141 --> 01:36:35,141
didn't understand it.
It was because they could never take 

1638
01:36:35,141 --> 01:36:38,390
enough damage to get to that point.
As we've said throughout this series,

1639
01:36:38,810 --> 01:36:40,700
nations in the past,
for the most part,

1640
01:36:40,701 --> 01:36:45,701
couldn't take a punch.
The ones who could stand out like sore 

1641
01:36:45,701 --> 01:36:46,580
thumbs.
The Roman republic,

1642
01:36:46,581 --> 01:36:49,040
for example,
what makes it so unusual in the military

1643
01:36:49,041 --> 01:36:54,041
history sense,
they could sustain defeat after defeat 

1644
01:36:54,041 --> 01:36:58,900
after defeat and not capitulate.
They could lose a battle of Kony.

1645
01:36:59,301 --> 01:37:04,301
They could lose a battle of Lake 
[inaudible] in the same war and keep 

1646
01:37:04,301 --> 01:37:05,030
coming back for more theory.

1647
01:37:05,030 --> 01:37:07,160
Unusual.
You know,

1648
01:37:07,161 --> 01:37:11,420
a generation before those defeats.
Alexander the great defeats,

1649
01:37:11,421 --> 01:37:14,960
the massive and the greatest empire the 
world has ever seen.

1650
01:37:14,961 --> 01:37:17,660
The Acumen did Persian empire with a 
couple of big shots.

1651
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:21,830
There's never enough time for the 
society to implode.

1652
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:28,140
A society collapsing at the foundation's
requires that they be able to stand 

1653
01:37:29,061 --> 01:37:31,700
there and exchange enough punches to get
to that point.

1654
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:37,420
By 1916,
the grinding down of nations as well 

1655
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:41,460
underway as author David Fromkin says 
the real war had become an economic and 

1656
01:37:42,591 --> 01:37:47,591
social survival contest,
and the generals are beginning to 

1657
01:37:47,591 --> 01:37:51,170
organize their strategies to quicken and
hasten this outcome.

1658
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:56,620
For example,
when Falcon high and talks about you 

1659
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:56,620
know the idea using attrition

1660
01:37:56,620 --> 01:38:00,060
to bleed the French White,
he explains that you don't have to worry

1661
01:38:00,061 --> 01:38:05,061
about the Russians anymore because 
they're well on their way to having 

1662
01:38:05,061 --> 01:38:06,330
their entire society collapsed.
He says,

1663
01:38:06,331 --> 01:38:08,790
quote,
according to all reports,

1664
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:13,950
the domestic difficulties of the giant 
empire are multiplying rapidly.

1665
01:38:14,250 --> 01:38:18,300
Even if we cannot perhaps expect a 
revolution in the grand style,

1666
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:22,820
we're entitled to believe that Russia is
internal troubles will compel her to get

1667
01:38:22,821 --> 01:38:26,340
in within a relatively short period.
In this connection,

1668
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:30,240
it may be taken for granted that she 
will not revive her military reputation.

1669
01:38:30,241 --> 01:38:33,090
Meanwhile,
we need not be anxious about that.

1670
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:39,080
On the contrary,
it is probable he writes that any such 

1671
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:42,801
attempt and the loss is it must involve,
will only hasten the process of 

1672
01:38:42,801 --> 01:38:46,641
disintegration and quote.
I should also point out that in the 19th

1673
01:38:47,541 --> 01:38:48,500
century,
for example,

1674
01:38:48,501 --> 01:38:52,070
that kind of disintegration not only 
wasn't the goal,

1675
01:38:52,340 --> 01:38:57,340
it would have been seen as a negative 
byproduct in the era where a military 

1676
01:38:58,191 --> 01:39:03,191
defeat meant that one general gave his 
sword to the other general and we 

1677
01:39:03,191 --> 01:39:04,460
exchanged some provinces are some 
colonies or whatnot.

1678
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:07,490
The goal wasn't for the society to 
collapse.

1679
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:09,320
It was now

1680
01:39:11,490 --> 01:39:16,490
and military leaders began to employ 
strategies designed to make that outcome

1681
01:39:16,861 --> 01:39:18,810
a reality.
For example,

1682
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:24,140
when the war starts,
the British used their navy to clamp 

1683
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:28,851
down a blockade on Germany.
Now the French don't look at that as a 

1684
01:39:28,951 --> 01:39:33,951
very useful strategy because after all,
something like that's going to take a 

1685
01:39:33,951 --> 01:39:35,890
long time and no one win.
This war starts or you know,

1686
01:39:35,980 --> 01:39:39,900
a very small minority who turned out to 
be Cassandra's and prophetic.

1687
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:45,140
No one thinks the war is going to go 
long enough for something like a 

1688
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:47,850
blockade to actually take effect.
But by 1916,

1689
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:53,180
everyone is starting to understand that 
those longterm anaconda like strangling 

1690
01:39:53,371 --> 01:39:58,371
strategies are very viable and the 
British are not the only ones who can do

1691
01:39:59,731 --> 01:40:01,710
this.
After all,

1692
01:40:02,430 --> 01:40:06,750
the Germans have a fleet to right,
and this is the point in the story where

1693
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:09,420
it becomes worth talking about again for
a minute.

1694
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:14,310
You see,
this German fleet was a key reason.

1695
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:16,240
The tensions,
especially with Brittany,

1696
01:40:16,241 --> 01:40:17,760
increased in the prewar years,
right?

1697
01:40:17,761 --> 01:40:20,130
It's called the Anglo German naval 
tensions,

1698
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:25,640
but it was considered to be worth it by 
a kaiser and a government that thought 

1699
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:27,720
it was important to be able to hold your
own at sea.

1700
01:40:27,721 --> 01:40:32,100
So these ships were built and they cost 
an amazing amount of money.

1701
01:40:32,730 --> 01:40:35,970
A huge amount of industrial capacity is 
sucked up into this.

1702
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:37,120
As we said,
[inaudible].

1703
01:40:37,140 --> 01:40:42,140
You turn up at a basically friendly 
Britain into an enemy and now that you 

1704
01:40:42,601 --> 01:40:47,601
got what you wanted,
it's sitting in port continually and 

1705
01:40:47,881 --> 01:40:50,930
here you've got your country straining 
every fiber you know,

1706
01:40:51,130 --> 01:40:52,950
to sacrifice for the war effort.
Heck,

1707
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:57,960
the civilians are starting to cut back 
on their caloric intake and here's this 

1708
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:01,171
fleet,
so expensive to build and every month 

1709
01:41:01,171 --> 01:41:01,270
sucking up resources and sitting in 
port.

1710
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:07,920
This is the time in the story where 
because the Germans get a new admiral,

1711
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:13,680
things start to happen on the surface 
naval front for really the only time in 

1712
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:13,690
this war.

1713
01:41:14,830 --> 01:41:17,620
And if you are our nut for this period 
like I am,

1714
01:41:17,621 --> 01:41:22,621
I like to call it the battleship era,
somewhere between 1890 ish in 1940 ish 

1715
01:41:23,351 --> 01:41:28,351
about 50 years.
The era where you get these armored 

1716
01:41:28,351 --> 01:41:29,140
Lavania fans that are just,
to me,

1717
01:41:29,141 --> 01:41:30,250
they're fascinating,
right?

1718
01:41:30,251 --> 01:41:35,251
And they're such incredible vehicles 
that you may have to fast forward this 

1719
01:41:35,251 --> 01:41:37,420
show when I start going off on some 
detailed tangent that,

1720
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:39,250
you know,
only I find interesting.

1721
01:41:39,730 --> 01:41:40,750
Um,
but I,

1722
01:41:40,751 --> 01:41:45,751
I think these vehicles are incredible 
and there is so little evidence of them 

1723
01:41:45,881 --> 01:41:49,900
actually being used that on the few 
occasions where it happens,

1724
01:41:49,901 --> 01:41:53,320
I tend to look at them rather deeply.
There's only one occasion in history.

1725
01:41:53,321 --> 01:41:56,410
I don't think I count the Rusa Japanese 
war pre dread.

1726
01:41:56,411 --> 01:42:01,411
I think only one occasion in history 
where these armored ships from this era,

1727
01:42:01,780 --> 01:42:06,780
the 50 years battleship era,
actually fought the way these admirals 

1728
01:42:06,780 --> 01:42:10,390
had envisioned they would in long lines,
miles long lines,

1729
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:12,610
stretching off to the horizon,
you know,

1730
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:16,900
Lord Nelson Style pirates of the 
Caribbean style and facing a fleet.

1731
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:18,970
Similarly arrayed and shooting,
you know,

1732
01:42:18,971 --> 01:42:23,020
in the distance between them.
That only happened once in this whole 50

1733
01:42:23,021 --> 01:42:25,990
year battleship era and only happened 
once in this war.

1734
01:42:25,991 --> 01:42:30,991
Obviously it's a battle in 1916 called 
the battle of Jutland to Kooks like 

1735
01:42:31,391 --> 01:42:32,200
yours.
Truly.

1736
01:42:32,201 --> 01:42:34,660
This is a fantastically interesting 
encounter.

1737
01:42:35,610 --> 01:42:37,570
When we were thinking about organizing 
this story,

1738
01:42:37,930 --> 01:42:38,270
you know,
you,

1739
01:42:38,271 --> 01:42:41,710
you try to carve out places to take a 
little direction,

1740
01:42:41,711 --> 01:42:43,090
change in a momentum change.
You know,

1741
01:42:43,091 --> 01:42:48,091
you go from the carnage of ridden and 
those of you who know the story know 

1742
01:42:48,091 --> 01:42:51,661
what's coming up in the future of it and
you take a little interlude to talk 

1743
01:42:51,661 --> 01:42:53,320
about other elements.
Not just the naval side of this,

1744
01:42:53,321 --> 01:42:58,321
but also the fact that the navy really 
is a wonderful canvas on which to 

1745
01:42:58,321 --> 01:43:01,801
represent the technology of this era.
And how big of a deal that is to the 

1746
01:43:01,801 --> 01:43:03,970
people here and that's a perpetual 
problem,

1747
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:04,510
isn't it?

1748
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:09,780
Me going back in time and seeing what 
looks to be ancient technology to US 

1749
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:11,920
looking at it the way the people back 
then are looking at it,

1750
01:43:11,921 --> 01:43:14,830
to whom it's cutting edge stuff.
I mean,

1751
01:43:14,831 --> 01:43:17,260
first of all,
I was trying to think about the best way

1752
01:43:17,261 --> 01:43:22,261
to sort of explain,
create an analogy for how these people 

1753
01:43:22,261 --> 01:43:25,051
see the fleets they have and the fleets 
and the navy's along with this new 

1754
01:43:25,051 --> 01:43:27,310
thing.
These aircraft are the real cutting edge

1755
01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:32,340
technology out there.
And the reason why is because it's just 

1756
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:34,360
death to be too far behind.
And as I said,

1757
01:43:34,361 --> 01:43:39,361
the best navy from 1900 would lose to 
several navies from 1914.

1758
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:45,300
That's a mere 14 years.
I don't think those 1914 navy's lose a 

1759
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:45,970
ship.
That's how quickly things are changing.

1760
01:43:47,140 --> 01:43:51,290
Robert Massey and his book dreadnought 
has a great line where he says in 1900,

1761
01:43:51,470 --> 01:43:54,140
and that's a mere 14 years before the 
first world war breaks out.

1762
01:43:54,710 --> 01:43:59,710
Every single British admiral commanding 
a British battleship had been trained 

1763
01:44:00,290 --> 01:44:02,960
when they came up in the navy and the 
age of sail.

1764
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:06,790
So that's an example of how cutting edge
this is.

1765
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:09,130
Um,
if you want a mental image,

1766
01:44:09,131 --> 01:44:14,131
think of the titanic,
the ship that struck the iceberg and 

1767
01:44:14,131 --> 01:44:14,131
went down and everything that's from 
this era.

1768
01:44:14,131 --> 01:44:17,740
It's sort of a steam,
punky Sherlock Holmes.

1769
01:44:17,741 --> 01:44:20,830
He kind of feel.
I always think about it as.

1770
01:44:20,831 --> 01:44:22,660
I mean if you,
if you are up in the command center,

1771
01:44:22,661 --> 01:44:27,661
one of these battleships,
it's like star trek meets Sherlock 

1772
01:44:27,661 --> 01:44:30,250
Holmes or steam punk and you,
instead of having a digital display,

1773
01:44:30,251 --> 01:44:35,050
you'd have one of those in around dials 
with one of those arrows that looks like

1774
01:44:35,051 --> 01:44:40,051
the elevator Arrow in a nice New York 
hotel that goes around on a gold 

1775
01:44:40,051 --> 01:44:40,051
background.
I mean,

1776
01:44:40,051 --> 01:44:40,720
you know,
very,

1777
01:44:40,990 --> 01:44:42,250
very beautiful.
Actually.

1778
01:44:42,251 --> 01:44:44,500
These ships were beautiful,
polished wood,

1779
01:44:44,501 --> 01:44:49,501
the whole thing.
They were just gorgeous and they were 

1780
01:44:49,501 --> 01:44:49,501
the cutting edge technology of their 
day.

1781
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:55,200
And I had to resist comparing them to 
space ships as a way to try to have us 

1782
01:44:56,651 --> 01:44:59,200
feel like the people back then felt.
Because you know me,

1783
01:44:59,201 --> 01:45:01,630
that would just be so meta,
so it's just like a star ship,

1784
01:45:02,050 --> 01:45:04,660
but it's a little like one but not 
enough for the comparison.

1785
01:45:04,661 --> 01:45:05,740
Right.
As I thought to myself,

1786
01:45:05,741 --> 01:45:06,400
I thought,
you know,

1787
01:45:06,940 --> 01:45:08,520
those people saw battleships,
uh,

1788
01:45:08,530 --> 01:45:09,520
as,
as really cutting edge,

1789
01:45:09,521 --> 01:45:14,521
but not as much as we would spaceships 
with an equal number of crew members on 

1790
01:45:14,521 --> 01:45:15,550
board.
That would be a bigger deal.

1791
01:45:15,551 --> 01:45:18,610
But then I remembered the submarines

1792
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:20,870
for the people,
again,

1793
01:45:20,871 --> 01:45:24,440
hard for us to get all wild about them,
but to the people back then,

1794
01:45:24,650 --> 01:45:29,650
that is science fiction,
the very definition of the word right 

1795
01:45:29,650 --> 01:45:29,650
out of Jules Verne's,
20,000

1796
01:45:29,650 --> 01:45:33,370
leagues under the sea and all of a 
sudden we have ships that go underwater.

1797
01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:38,780
It's like they have cloaking devices.
They become invisible and worse,

1798
01:45:38,990 --> 01:45:43,990
if you're a naval official back then is 
that they now carry new weapons that 

1799
01:45:45,441 --> 01:45:50,441
threatened everything you have.
This is what really accounts for the 

1800
01:45:50,691 --> 01:45:53,870
cautious nature of naval warfare in this
period,

1801
01:45:53,871 --> 01:45:58,871
right?
Why didn't the ships just all come out 

1802
01:45:58,871 --> 01:45:58,871
blazing and everything while there's all
these uncertainties?

1803
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:04,660
Part of this period's attraction is that
you begin to see a show down in naval 

1804
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:08,540
warfare when you haven't had any test of
any of this technology to long time.

1805
01:46:08,541 --> 01:46:13,541
No one knows what's going to happen when
you get whole fleets out here blazing 

1806
01:46:13,541 --> 01:46:15,650
away with this modern technology.
It hasn't happened before.

1807
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:20,950
One of the things everyone's kind of 
scared about is you know these torpedoes

1808
01:46:20,951 --> 01:46:22,540
for example,
and these minds,

1809
01:46:22,541 --> 01:46:27,541
you know these floating minds that that 
lay in the water and then a ship runs 

1810
01:46:27,541 --> 01:46:30,541
into them and boom,
they explode because these weapons are 

1811
01:46:30,541 --> 01:46:30,541
very,
very cheap,

1812
01:46:30,541 --> 01:46:35,011
right?
You can make a lot of them and they can 

1813
01:46:35,011 --> 01:46:36,570
sync these massively expensive,
you know,

1814
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:41,200
ships that take years to build and who's
lost as catastrophic.

1815
01:46:41,470 --> 01:46:42,580
They can sync those.

1816
01:46:43,490 --> 01:46:45,980
That's a huge change because in most 
naval warfare,

1817
01:46:46,250 --> 01:46:51,250
generally there are exceptions,
but when you want to sync a expensive 

1818
01:46:51,250 --> 01:46:55,580
first class ship,
you generally need either another 

1819
01:46:55,580 --> 01:46:57,150
massive firstclass ship or a lot of 
other ones.

1820
01:46:57,810 --> 01:46:59,940
They have huge survival strength,
right?

1821
01:46:59,941 --> 01:47:04,941
They,
they can justify their cost and the 

1822
01:47:04,941 --> 01:47:04,941
investment.
Now all of a sudden,

1823
01:47:04,941 --> 01:47:09,320
for example,
Churchill talks about the British 

1824
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:09,320
admiralty,
just being petrified that you would turn

1825
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:14,181
around one day and these great,
huge expensive ships that took forever 

1826
01:47:14,181 --> 01:47:17,451
to build and that you only had a limited
number of were just disappearing in the 

1827
01:47:17,451 --> 01:47:17,451
blink of an eye boom,
quick explosion,

1828
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:21,210
another ship gone,
and then when the war starts in like the

1829
01:47:21,211 --> 01:47:24,990
first couple of months that happens,
they lose a super dreadnought.

1830
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:30,140
The Creme de la creme of the British 
battleship forces or the HMS audacious 

1831
01:47:30,811 --> 01:47:32,550
strikes a mine like,
you know,

1832
01:47:32,551 --> 01:47:34,560
a month or two after the war starts and 
that's a,

1833
01:47:34,590 --> 01:47:36,240
that's a pretty brand new ship almost.

1834
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:37,530
And Boom,
goes down.

1835
01:47:37,531 --> 01:47:39,090
One mine,
one battleship.

1836
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:40,980
Wow.
Again,

1837
01:47:40,981 --> 01:47:42,270
if you're in the admiralty,
you're going,

1838
01:47:42,271 --> 01:47:43,440
okay,
what does this mean?

1839
01:47:44,010 --> 01:47:48,050
And then a submarine like sinks,
a couple of old British cruisers,

1840
01:47:48,090 --> 01:47:48,450
boom,
boom,

1841
01:47:48,451 --> 01:47:50,010
boom.
I mean one right after another,

1842
01:47:50,250 --> 01:47:55,250
and now all of a sudden you know,
these people who've got these big 

1843
01:47:55,250 --> 01:47:58,521
expensive ships are petrified about 
using them in military history as like 

1844
01:47:58,521 --> 01:47:59,850
Martin van [inaudible] have spoken about
this.

1845
01:47:59,851 --> 01:48:04,851
We just have this strange dichotomy 
where you spend so much money on these 

1846
01:48:04,851 --> 01:48:06,490
vessels because they are very important,
but they,

1847
01:48:06,491 --> 01:48:08,820
because you spend so much money on them,
you don't want to reach them.

1848
01:48:08,970 --> 01:48:13,970
And so you have the German navy in the 
British navy dealing with each other as 

1849
01:48:14,101 --> 01:48:17,310
maybe two snipers hunting each other 
would deal with each other,

1850
01:48:17,670 --> 01:48:20,010
waiting for the other side to make a 
mistake.

1851
01:48:20,011 --> 01:48:23,370
And then when they do pouncing,
the problem is,

1852
01:48:23,371 --> 01:48:28,080
is that when the war starts,
the British clamp down that blockade and

1853
01:48:28,081 --> 01:48:29,580
that's all they need to do.

1854
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:32,730
The pressures on the Germans to do 
something about it.

1855
01:48:33,510 --> 01:48:34,980
And as we said,
Winston Churchill,

1856
01:48:34,981 --> 01:48:36,450
who was the civilian,
uh,

1857
01:48:36,690 --> 01:48:40,140
head of the navy for awhile in this 
conflict wrote down that really,

1858
01:48:40,260 --> 01:48:42,990
while there would've been a lot of 
advantages to sending the,

1859
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:45,300
you know,
numerically superior British fleet to go

1860
01:48:45,301 --> 01:48:50,301
in there and just kick German tail.
The downside if you failed to do that 

1861
01:48:51,390 --> 01:48:53,370
was so bad it wasn't worth it.
He said,

1862
01:48:53,371 --> 01:48:53,740
yeah,
you know,

1863
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:56,970
we could get all these good things if we
decisively defeated the German.

1864
01:48:56,971 --> 01:48:58,620
But he goes,
but if we lost,

1865
01:48:58,650 --> 01:49:02,770
and remember this is all untried 
technology and naval combat,

1866
01:49:02,771 --> 01:49:04,560
it's weird and unpredictable.
Anyway,

1867
01:49:04,830 --> 01:49:09,830
you could bring the superior fleet in 
there and somehow lose or just lose 

1868
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:12,720
enough so that you don't have the 
numerical advantage anymore.

1869
01:49:12,721 --> 01:49:15,300
You've got parody with the enemy and 
that was unthinkable,

1870
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:19,020
and Churchill said the chances of that 
happening might not be great,

1871
01:49:19,021 --> 01:49:21,450
but if it happens,
it could cost us the whole war.

1872
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:24,570
I remember reading that and thinking to 
myself,

1873
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:29,600
I don't know if I buy it,
but a whole lot of interesting thoughts 

1874
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:32,250
come to mind if you believe what 
Churchill says about it.

1875
01:49:32,670 --> 01:49:35,130
Basically having the potential to end 
the war.

1876
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:36,900
Now,
here's how he explained it in his book,

1877
01:49:36,901 --> 01:49:41,901
he said,
if the German navy were even to have a 

1878
01:49:41,901 --> 01:49:44,541
nice victory against the British and cut
down the numerical superiority so that 

1879
01:49:44,541 --> 01:49:48,291
they both have the same number of big 
ships than the German navy would be to 

1880
01:49:48,291 --> 01:49:52,740
interdict the stuff heading for Britain.
And Churchill says that that would 

1881
01:49:52,740 --> 01:49:55,360
result in quote,
the trade and food supply of the British

1882
01:49:55,361 --> 01:50:00,361
isles would have been paralyzed.
Our armies on the continent would have 

1883
01:50:00,361 --> 01:50:02,110
been cut off from their base by superior
naval force.

1884
01:50:02,350 --> 01:50:07,350
All the transportation of the allies 
would have been jeopardized and 

1885
01:50:07,350 --> 01:50:10,641
hampered.
The United States could not have 

1886
01:50:10,641 --> 01:50:10,641
intervened in the war.

1887
01:50:10,641 --> 01:50:12,280
Starvation and invasion would have 
descended upon the British.

1888
01:50:12,281 --> 01:50:16,930
People ruin under and final would have 
overwhelmed the allied cause.

1889
01:50:17,590 --> 01:50:21,370
He says the great disparity of the 
results at stake in a battle between the

1890
01:50:21,371 --> 01:50:25,210
British and German navy's can never be 
excluded from our thoughts.

1891
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:31,500
And so if you buy Churchill's theory,
that means instead of being the most 

1892
01:50:32,051 --> 01:50:35,500
secure of the great powers that I think 
most of us assume Britain is,

1893
01:50:35,501 --> 01:50:37,890
after all,
you're talking about an island nation to

1894
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:39,610
country with a moat around it,
right?

1895
01:50:39,611 --> 01:50:41,170
And then you add the greatest navy in 
the world.

1896
01:50:41,171 --> 01:50:44,140
Looks pretty secure to me,
but Churchill's idea here is that,

1897
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:47,710
yeah,
but we're one lucky punch away from that

1898
01:50:47,711 --> 01:50:52,711
situation.
Changing to stay with our boxing 

1899
01:50:52,711 --> 01:50:52,780
analogy,
and if that's true,

1900
01:50:53,290 --> 01:50:58,290
the Germans maybe are justified in 
keeping that fleet safe and port in case

1901
01:50:58,421 --> 01:50:59,800
you need a lucky punch.

1902
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:04,120
Maybe you're losing the war elsewhere 
and you decide you'll send your ships on

1903
01:51:04,121 --> 01:51:07,180
a death run and take your chances.
Maybe you get lucky,

1904
01:51:07,181 --> 01:51:08,680
right?
Maybe you get a knockout blow.

1905
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:11,620
If again,
you buy into what Churchill saying,

1906
01:51:11,621 --> 01:51:16,621
it means that the Germans will,
as long as they still have a fleet 

1907
01:51:16,621 --> 01:51:17,770
somewhere,
maintain the ability to win the war with

1908
01:51:17,771 --> 01:51:20,110
a lucky punch at anytime.
I find that fascinating.

1909
01:51:20,111 --> 01:51:21,880
Don't know if I believe it,
but find it fascinating.

1910
01:51:23,710 --> 01:51:28,710
Now,
the only time in this war that the 

1911
01:51:28,710 --> 01:51:30,970
attempt at a lucky punch happens.
It wasn't thrown that way,

1912
01:51:31,270 --> 01:51:36,270
but the only time that this decisive 
encounter that could be potentially 

1913
01:51:36,270 --> 01:51:38,680
horrifying if it totally went the wrong 
way for Britain.

1914
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:41,560
The only time this happens is in this 
part of the story.

1915
01:51:41,561 --> 01:51:44,170
We're in now,
1916,

1916
01:51:44,230 --> 01:51:46,210
and it happens because of that album we 
mentioned earlier.

1917
01:51:46,210 --> 01:51:51,210
His name is Ryan Hart Shear and he takes
over in early 1916 and he feels about 

1918
01:51:51,311 --> 01:51:53,830
the German fleet pretty much the same 
way everyone else does.

1919
01:51:54,250 --> 01:51:57,700
It's time to earn your keep and let's 
start acting more aggressively with it.

1920
01:51:58,060 --> 01:51:59,920
And so he'll start trying to,
um,

1921
01:52:00,550 --> 01:52:02,410
the best way to put it as trap the 
British,

1922
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:05,950
the British have more big ships than the
German.

1923
01:52:05,951 --> 01:52:07,210
So sheers ideas.
Well,

1924
01:52:07,211 --> 01:52:10,750
let's see if we can ambush small numbers
of those big ships,

1925
01:52:11,110 --> 01:52:16,110
overwhelmed them and slowly but surely 
widdled down the advantage in numbers 

1926
01:52:16,110 --> 01:52:20,221
that the British have and it's one of 
these attempted traps that results in 

1927
01:52:20,891 --> 01:52:24,490
this really only time for enthusiasts 
like yours truly,

1928
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:29,880
to see what these fleets could do in an 
all out encounter with both sides,

1929
01:52:31,630 --> 01:52:35,440
hurling steel at the horizon and with 
all these weapons that,

1930
01:52:35,441 --> 01:52:37,690
you know,
from a spectator standpoint,

1931
01:52:38,050 --> 01:52:40,960
you're just dying to see what the heck 
they can do.

1932
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:43,060
I mean,
let's start with the guns.

1933
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:48,480
The guns on these ships,
the same kind of guns you saw leveling 

1934
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:49,760
the Belgian fortune that the Germans 
were using it for.

1935
01:52:49,830 --> 01:52:54,830
Done.
Those are the big naval guns being used 

1936
01:52:54,830 --> 01:52:54,830
on land.
Well,

1937
01:52:54,830 --> 01:52:54,980
why do you think they call them naval 
guns?

1938
01:52:54,981 --> 01:52:57,100
Right?
These new battleships,

1939
01:52:57,101 --> 01:53:00,560
I mean for example,
the British are bringing in four or five

1940
01:53:01,070 --> 01:53:06,070
brand new ones that will fight in the 
Second World War Two that have 15 inch 

1941
01:53:06,070 --> 01:53:09,611
guns and multiple,
I mean like eight to 1215 inch guns.

1942
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:12,110
That's incredible.
13 inches of armor.

1943
01:53:12,111 --> 01:53:14,120
They were like 30,000
tons.

1944
01:53:14,510 --> 01:53:16,100
The new Queen Elizabeth Class,
they're called.

1945
01:53:16,101 --> 01:53:19,130
They can do like 25 knots if they're 
really smoking.

1946
01:53:20,540 --> 01:53:25,540
These are incredible,
incredible modern warships and when you 

1947
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:28,460
realize that they can hurl a shell the 
size of a small Volkswagen,

1948
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:34,240
18 miles across the horizon at a target 
that's a hundred feet wide while both 

1949
01:53:36,471 --> 01:53:41,471
shooter and target are moving and hope 
to hit it reasonably well.

1950
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:45,440
That's shocking.
I mean the Spanish American war,

1951
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:50,960
uh,
less than 20 years before this time 

1952
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:52,841
period,
they would fire hundreds of shots at 

1953
01:53:52,841 --> 01:53:53,750
about just less than three miles 
distance.

1954
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:55,910
And every now and then they'd score a 
hit,

1955
01:53:55,940 --> 01:53:59,450
you know,
hundreds to get a few in the Russo,

1956
01:53:59,451 --> 01:54:04,451
Japanese war,
they broke all records when they opened 

1957
01:54:04,451 --> 01:54:05,150
fire at each other at eight miles 
distance.

1958
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:08,840
That's 11 years before the battle of 
Jutland.

1959
01:54:08,900 --> 01:54:12,080
Eight miles breaking all records.
The Battle of Jutland has ships that can

1960
01:54:12,081 --> 01:54:17,081
fire 18 miles.
How do you even hit anything on the 

1961
01:54:17,081 --> 01:54:17,120
horizon?
Well,

1962
01:54:17,121 --> 01:54:19,580
both sides,
British and German are incorporating,

1963
01:54:19,581 --> 01:54:21,410
again,
it's like steam punk technology,

1964
01:54:21,420 --> 01:54:26,420
maybe a rudimentary fire control 
computer you might call it and both 

1965
01:54:26,420 --> 01:54:30,911
sides have different versions and the 
Germans have superior optics and so 

1966
01:54:30,911 --> 01:54:31,700
they'll score the early hits in,
in,

1967
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:36,760
in,
in this encounter that happens in large 

1968
01:54:36,760 --> 01:54:39,671
part because the British are reading the
naval communications of the Germans.

1969
01:54:40,970 --> 01:54:45,970
See,
I love the battle of Jutland for a 

1970
01:54:45,970 --> 01:54:48,370
couple of reasons,
not just because it's the battleship 

1971
01:54:48,370 --> 01:54:48,370
encounter of the war,
but also because it's a rubber meets the

1972
01:54:48,370 --> 01:54:53,201
road moment a put up or shut up 
historical acid test where all of the 

1973
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:57,350
military theories and the debates and 
the,

1974
01:54:57,680 --> 01:55:02,680
the philosophical differences amongst 
experts over the proper way to build 

1975
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:06,731
these ships and what naval battles going
to be like in the next war and all that 

1976
01:55:06,731 --> 01:55:09,020
stuff leaves the realm of the 
theoretical and gets,

1977
01:55:09,390 --> 01:55:14,390
you know,
laboratory tested on the naval 

1978
01:55:14,390 --> 01:55:16,430
battlefield.
The land powers already saw this happen 

1979
01:55:16,430 --> 01:55:19,541
to them right at the start of the war,
their military land theories and all 

1980
01:55:19,541 --> 01:55:21,080
that the people had speculated about for
decades,

1981
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:25,880
got their acid test in the first month.
Places like the battles of the frontiers

1982
01:55:25,881 --> 01:55:30,881
where those sort of high minded all 
academic debates at military war 

1983
01:55:30,881 --> 01:55:35,801
colleges about whether or not charging 
cavalry will have any sort of a role on 

1984
01:55:35,801 --> 01:55:37,040
the modern battlefield with machine guns
and everything.

1985
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:42,250
I mean that kind of stuff gets tested in
the first month of the war and the 

1986
01:55:42,250 --> 01:55:43,620
results are of course bloody and 
decisive.

1987
01:55:43,621 --> 01:55:45,540
Even if they won't be absorbed right 
away.

1988
01:55:46,650 --> 01:55:49,530
The naval side of this war hasn't had 
this kind of an acid test yet.

1989
01:55:49,770 --> 01:55:54,770
There've been little encounters,
one of the Falkland Islands and other 

1990
01:55:54,770 --> 01:55:57,210
one dog or bank between a few cruisers 
here in a battle cruiser to there,

1991
01:55:57,450 --> 01:55:59,640
but nothing like what's going to happen 
at Jutland.

1992
01:56:00,090 --> 01:56:04,470
And when you realize how careful these 
admirals are being because of the nature

1993
01:56:04,471 --> 01:56:09,471
of naval combat,
I mean you could provide an opportunity 

1994
01:56:09,471 --> 01:56:10,140
for someone to get a lucky punch if 
you're not careful.

1995
01:56:10,141 --> 01:56:11,820
So none of these admirals wants to go 
out,

1996
01:56:11,970 --> 01:56:16,970
unless they have an edge,
unless they have an advantage on their 

1997
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:16,970
side,
favorable conditions,

1998
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:21,171
it would be called the British don't 
have to do anything because they've got 

1999
01:56:21,171 --> 01:56:21,990
this blockade going.
So worst case scenario,

2000
01:56:21,991 --> 01:56:26,991
if things just stay as they are,
they are wearing the Germans down with 

2001
01:56:26,991 --> 01:56:26,991
this blockade.

2002
01:56:26,991 --> 01:56:31,640
They're going to create the 
disintegration of a state just like we 

2003
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:32,210
told you,
you know,

2004
01:56:32,220 --> 01:56:34,230
was the goal.
Now of these leaders,

2005
01:56:34,231 --> 01:56:39,231
you know,
if the Germans begin to starve at home 

2006
01:56:39,231 --> 01:56:42,150
and the caloric intake is already being 
reduced for their civilians,

2007
01:56:42,330 --> 01:56:47,330
you will see revolution in the streets.
So this British strategy of blockade 

2008
01:56:47,330 --> 01:56:48,180
will eventually bring Germany to its 
knees.

2009
01:56:48,510 --> 01:56:52,020
So it's incumbent upon the Germans to do
something about that situation when they

2010
01:56:52,021 --> 01:56:56,070
get their new admiral Reinhardt's shear 
in 1916 who wants to be more aggressive?

2011
01:56:56,250 --> 01:56:59,370
He decides to create his own edge,
you know,

2012
01:56:59,371 --> 01:57:03,570
the conditions for his own advantage on 
the naval battlefield.

2013
01:57:03,810 --> 01:57:08,810
So he sets traps and in late May 1916,
he sets one for what he hopes will be a 

2014
01:57:09,991 --> 01:57:12,630
detachment of big British warships.
You know,

2015
01:57:12,631 --> 01:57:16,870
get five or six battle cruisers and 
entice them pastures,

2016
01:57:16,871 --> 01:57:21,871
submarines or into your mind fields or 
into an area where they think they can 

2017
01:57:21,871 --> 01:57:26,481
feast on some of your light forces and 
then pounce on them with your big fleet 

2018
01:57:26,481 --> 01:57:27,720
and that's what she plans to do.

2019
01:57:27,990 --> 01:57:32,990
And so he sets out all these forces and 
prepares this little ambush and what he 

2020
01:57:32,990 --> 01:57:35,670
doesn't know is that the British,
as we said,

2021
01:57:36,150 --> 01:57:38,520
our reading,
all these naval communications,

2022
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:43,880
are the British the greatest 
cryptographers on the planet or is that 

2023
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:46,620
just the 20th century?
Sort of coloring my view because boy,

2024
01:57:46,621 --> 01:57:48,630
were they great in the 20th century,
in the Second World War.

2025
01:57:48,631 --> 01:57:52,350
They will famously be reading all the 
German enigma traffic among other things

2026
01:57:52,650 --> 01:57:57,650
in this war and the first couple of 
months the German naval codes fall into 

2027
01:57:57,650 --> 01:58:01,131
their hands and while they may not be 
deciphering every single message when 

2028
01:58:01,801 --> 01:58:06,801
the entire German high seas fleet as 
it's called 100 ships about decides to 

2029
01:58:07,621 --> 01:58:09,230
way anchor and go out.
You know,

2030
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:12,180
looking to play in the North Sea.
The British know about that.

2031
01:58:12,181 --> 01:58:14,130
There'll be big communication spikes and
everything.

2032
01:58:14,370 --> 01:58:16,590
So when sheer decides to set this 
ambush,

2033
01:58:16,890 --> 01:58:19,260
the British reading the naval codes tell
the fleet,

2034
01:58:19,261 --> 01:58:19,710
guess what?

2035
01:58:19,710 --> 01:58:24,060
The Germans are out there and they don't
know that we know they're out there.

2036
01:58:24,061 --> 01:58:25,980
And so the British grand fleet,
thanks.

2037
01:58:25,981 --> 01:58:27,390
Okay,
now we have the advantage.

2038
01:58:27,391 --> 01:58:32,391
We will trap the trappers.
And so the British Grand Fleet,

2039
01:58:32,431 --> 01:58:34,570
which is like 28,
you know,

2040
01:58:34,620 --> 01:58:39,620
super dreadnoughts and dreadnoughts.
I mean it's the biggest fleet in the 

2041
01:58:39,620 --> 01:58:42,561
world.
It's the most powerful fleet in world 

2042
01:58:42,561 --> 01:58:43,180
history up to this point.
And in terms of size and tonnage,

2043
01:58:43,181 --> 01:58:46,480
it may be the biggest fleet ever.
It weighs anchor.

2044
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:51,720
It starts making its way to where this 
ambush point is and it leaves so early 

2045
01:58:52,601 --> 01:58:57,601
by the way,
because it's got all this advanced 

2046
01:58:57,601 --> 01:58:58,360
information that it totally screws up a 
lot of ab role sheers ambush because his

2047
01:58:58,370 --> 01:58:59,190
forces,
you know,

2048
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:02,880
he had these submarines that were going 
to be outside the British ports and that

2049
01:59:02,881 --> 01:59:04,570
they could shoot it.
The British ships,

2050
01:59:04,571 --> 01:59:06,730
as they left the harbor,
none of that stuff's ready.

2051
01:59:07,420 --> 01:59:12,420
And so the British ships make their way 
to the rendezvous point where with the 

2052
01:59:12,420 --> 01:59:16,141
Germans.
And you're setting up another trafalgar 

2053
01:59:16,141 --> 01:59:16,141
here.
I mean,

2054
01:59:16,141 --> 01:59:20,281
if the British fleet emerges into view 
and catches the German fleet there,

2055
01:59:21,461 --> 01:59:23,860
you could sink half of it before they 
get away.

2056
01:59:24,190 --> 01:59:29,190
And then Murphy's law joins the battle.
Murphy's law takes center stage in this 

2057
01:59:30,611 --> 01:59:31,510
encounter,
by the way,

2058
01:59:31,511 --> 01:59:36,511
which would have made a great dress 
rehearsal for early 20th century naval 

2059
01:59:36,511 --> 01:59:37,990
warfare.
Unfortunately,

2060
01:59:37,991 --> 01:59:42,991
it's opening night and you know you have
troubles on opening night with all of 

2061
01:59:43,091 --> 01:59:44,680
the loose ends that haven't been fixed 
yet.

2062
01:59:44,681 --> 01:59:47,740
Imagine instead of opening night,
you're doing the dress rehearsal and yet

2063
01:59:47,741 --> 01:59:51,010
you have 250 ships in about 15 square 
miles.

2064
01:59:51,011 --> 01:59:56,011
When these things come together,
I mean the things that can go wrong and 

2065
01:59:56,011 --> 01:59:56,920
do go wrong,
effect this battle mightily.

2066
01:59:56,921 --> 01:59:59,950
And it's a good argument for why these 
admirals are so cautious.

2067
01:59:59,951 --> 02:00:00,850
They know this.

2068
02:00:02,120 --> 02:00:07,120
So Murphy's law intervenes while the 
British are about to pounce on the 

2069
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:10,871
Germans because the British send a 
message back to their intelligence 

2070
02:00:10,871 --> 02:00:10,871
service wanting a confirmation of this 
or that.

2071
02:00:10,970 --> 02:00:15,970
And the intelligence people reading the 
German naval codes tell them that they 

2072
02:00:15,970 --> 02:00:17,480
made a mistake earlier.
They said,

2073
02:00:17,510 --> 02:00:22,510
Oh yeah,
the German fleets not at sea like we 

2074
02:00:22,510 --> 02:00:22,510
thought there's still safely important,
don't worry about it.

2075
02:00:22,940 --> 02:00:27,940
So now these admirals,
who five minutes ago knew where the 

2076
02:00:27,940 --> 02:00:28,250
German fleet was and we're ready to 
pounce on it,

2077
02:00:28,580 --> 02:00:32,990
don't know they're there anymore,
but of course they are.

2078
02:00:33,710 --> 02:00:38,710
And so now we have both main fleets 
close to each other in the North Sea.

2079
02:00:39,950 --> 02:00:43,070
None of them aware of the other's 
existence.

2080
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:48,870
So the rhythm of this battle of Jutland 
is wonderful,

2081
02:00:48,871 --> 02:00:51,780
starts off as a trap,
flips into a counter trap,

2082
02:00:51,781 --> 02:00:56,781
and now it is serendipitously morphed 
into an encounter battle and that's how 

2083
02:00:57,841 --> 02:01:02,841
it gets started.
German light forces on one side of the 

2084
02:01:02,841 --> 02:01:07,081
horizon.
British light forces on the other side 

2085
02:01:07,081 --> 02:01:09,331
of horizon spot,
a civilian trawler between the two of 

2086
02:01:09,371 --> 02:01:14,371
them.
They can't see each other because 

2087
02:01:14,371 --> 02:01:15,601
they're so far away.
The curvature of the earth limits their 

2088
02:01:15,601 --> 02:01:15,601
site,
but they can both see the trawler.

2089
02:01:15,601 --> 02:01:15,700
So these light units,
you know,

2090
02:01:15,790 --> 02:01:17,560
converge on the trawler to investigate 
it,

2091
02:01:17,561 --> 02:01:22,561
discovery each other's,
starts shooting and send messages back 

2092
02:01:22,561 --> 02:01:22,960
to the main fleet saying,
guess what I have found over here on the

2093
02:01:22,961 --> 02:01:25,570
other side of the horizon,
the enemy fleet,

2094
02:01:25,630 --> 02:01:25,990
right?

2095
02:01:26,950 --> 02:01:31,950
And so this creates like a war vortex 
where all these naval forces start 

2096
02:01:32,020 --> 02:01:37,020
converging on this area.
The ships that arrive first are the 

2097
02:01:37,020 --> 02:01:40,400
battlecruisers.
This is an side of the story because the

2098
02:01:40,401 --> 02:01:45,401
battle cruisers are experiencing a test 
right now and it's the test of whether 

2099
02:01:45,981 --> 02:01:50,981
or not the admirals that backed this 
entire design in the decades before this

2100
02:01:52,070 --> 02:01:57,070
period were correct about it.
This is a theoretical argument until 

2101
02:01:57,531 --> 02:02:02,531
there's data,
there hasn't been a chance to have any 

2102
02:02:02,531 --> 02:02:02,531
data.
Now we're going to have data.

2103
02:02:02,531 --> 02:02:05,000
Are these ships viable?
Now,

2104
02:02:05,010 --> 02:02:06,290
first of all,
you need to know what they are.

2105
02:02:06,291 --> 02:02:11,291
A battle cruiser is a hybrid design.
It's supposed to combine the punching 

2106
02:02:11,661 --> 02:02:15,200
power of a battleship with the speed of 
a cruiser.

2107
02:02:15,770 --> 02:02:19,880
So if a battleship is like some giant 
lion,

2108
02:02:19,910 --> 02:02:22,010
for example,
or tiger,

2109
02:02:22,370 --> 02:02:25,490
these battle cruisers are more like 
panthers.

2110
02:02:26,030 --> 02:02:31,030
Now this is going to be confusing 
because they are all named after like 

2111
02:02:31,030 --> 02:02:34,091
giant cats,
and so the flagship of this battle 

2112
02:02:34,091 --> 02:02:34,490
cruiser squadron on the British side is 
the lion.

2113
02:02:34,490 --> 02:02:36,710
So don't get confused if I start talking
about the lion.

2114
02:02:37,090 --> 02:02:39,740
Um,
but that describes it pretty well.

2115
02:02:39,890 --> 02:02:44,890
The hypothetical problem here though,
is that you had to give up to get the 

2116
02:02:44,991 --> 02:02:49,991
speed of a cruiser.
You had to give up the armor of the 

2117
02:02:49,991 --> 02:02:53,411
battleship.
So what we have here is a ship with all 

2118
02:02:53,411 --> 02:02:57,461
the striking power of a battleship,
but one that can't take a punch by a 

2119
02:02:57,531 --> 02:03:02,531
battleship or its counterparts.
Another battle cruiser.

2120
02:03:03,830 --> 02:03:05,600
When this was pointed out before the 
war,

2121
02:03:05,601 --> 02:03:10,601
the admirals who liked the battle 
cruiser concept waved off this worry by 

2122
02:03:10,601 --> 02:03:13,160
saying don't worry,
speed will be their armor.

2123
02:03:13,670 --> 02:03:18,670
And that's where the argument is because
nobody knows if speed will be their 

2124
02:03:18,670 --> 02:03:20,270
armor.
These battlecruisers approach,

2125
02:03:20,271 --> 02:03:25,271
this battle at 26 or 27 knots,
which is amazingly fast for a ship their

2126
02:03:26,001 --> 02:03:31,001
size,
there are six of them on the British 

2127
02:03:31,001 --> 02:03:31,001
side and five of them on the German 
side.

2128
02:03:31,001 --> 02:03:35,860
And when they meet,
they begin to open fire and only about 

2129
02:03:35,860 --> 02:03:37,700
like eight miles,
which is short.

2130
02:03:38,630 --> 02:03:41,030
And the British have the longer range 
guns by the way.

2131
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:46,240
But don't open fire first.
This becomes the first of many things 

2132
02:03:46,240 --> 02:03:47,120
that the British admiral of these 
battlecruisers,

2133
02:03:47,121 --> 02:03:49,760
a guy named beatty will be critiqued 
about.

2134
02:03:50,210 --> 02:03:51,470
You know,
after this battle,

2135
02:03:52,790 --> 02:03:55,940
the battle opens up at about 3:45
in the afternoon.

2136
02:03:56,360 --> 02:04:01,360
Visually it is hard to see the ships if 
you actually see a picture of them at 

2137
02:04:02,841 --> 02:04:05,690
full tilt are smoking like they're on 
fire.

2138
02:04:05,900 --> 02:04:10,900
And when you have a bunch of them,
they're putting tons of this dark suit 

2139
02:04:10,900 --> 02:04:11,000
into the air.
Add to that,

2140
02:04:11,001 --> 02:04:14,360
the fact that we're over by Denmark in 
the North Sea,

2141
02:04:14,510 --> 02:04:16,970
there's fog there,
squalls,

2142
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,250
there's missed,
there's rain,

2143
02:04:19,251 --> 02:04:22,700
there's all kinds of things that inhibit
the ability to see very well.

2144
02:04:22,790 --> 02:04:27,790
And sometimes one fleet will be in a 
position where they see the other fleet 

2145
02:04:27,790 --> 02:04:29,360
really well,
but the other fleet doesn't see them and

2146
02:04:29,361 --> 02:04:30,050
vice versa.

2147
02:04:30,050 --> 02:04:34,010
So the part of being a good Amaryllis,
trying to arrange your fleet so that the

2148
02:04:34,011 --> 02:04:39,011
other fleet is highlighted against the 
horizon or in some way makes them an 

2149
02:04:39,011 --> 02:04:40,680
easier target and your fleet is kind of 
obscured and hard to hit,

2150
02:04:41,370 --> 02:04:46,370
but ships had not tried to shoot at each
other and some of the ranges they're 

2151
02:04:46,370 --> 02:04:46,860
going to try to shoot at each other.
Here.

2152
02:04:48,090 --> 02:04:51,180
When these battle cruisers start 
shooting at about 3:45,

2153
02:04:51,780 --> 02:04:56,780
the British shoot long,
initially over the heads of the German 

2154
02:04:56,780 --> 02:05:00,771
ships,
the German ships are disconcertingly 

2155
02:05:00,771 --> 02:05:03,531
accurate.
They strike the battle cruiser Tiger 

2156
02:05:03,531 --> 02:05:06,060
like six times in quick succession with 
11 inch shells.

2157
02:05:08,550 --> 02:05:11,970
Then at 4:00
they strike the flagship,

2158
02:05:12,180 --> 02:05:17,180
the lion with Admiral Beatty on board.
The shells penetrate the Turret,

2159
02:05:17,820 --> 02:05:21,900
which is the sort of armored bubble that
that contains the big guns.

2160
02:05:22,260 --> 02:05:26,040
The touristy either explodes or catches 
on fire and there are photographs,

2161
02:05:26,041 --> 02:05:28,710
by the way,
have moments in the battle of Jutland.

2162
02:05:28,711 --> 02:05:32,490
They're not great and I always imagine 
them zoomed in and colorized,

2163
02:05:32,790 --> 02:05:37,790
but you can see the lion burning and it 
looks bad and admiral beatty didn't 

2164
02:05:38,371 --> 02:05:43,320
realize at the time how closely he came 
to being blown to kingdom come.

2165
02:05:43,950 --> 02:05:48,950
They'll find out later that a guy who 
was dying and who had lost both his 

2166
02:05:49,291 --> 02:05:52,020
legs,
I'm on the lion,

2167
02:05:52,230 --> 02:05:57,230
saved the ship by flooding the magazine.
The last order he gave was to to flood 

2168
02:05:57,230 --> 02:06:01,620
the whole area where the explosives or 
to keep them from blowing the ship up.

2169
02:06:02,100 --> 02:06:04,320
Now,
if beatty was wondering what it would be

2170
02:06:04,321 --> 02:06:09,321
like to see one of these modern amazing 
ships explode,

2171
02:06:09,780 --> 02:06:14,780
he only had to wait about two minutes.
If you actually look at the moment by 

2172
02:06:14,780 --> 02:06:18,861
moment rundown of this battle,
and that's part of the fun of naval 

2173
02:06:18,861 --> 02:06:21,501
battles.
All these ships kept a very descriptive 

2174
02:06:21,501 --> 02:06:24,240
and detailed logs about their movements 
moment by moment by moment.

2175
02:06:24,241 --> 02:06:29,241
They've reconstructed this entire battle
from almost each individual ships 

2176
02:06:29,241 --> 02:06:32,811
viewpoint and the part that strikes you 
when you read a rundown is how quickly 

2177
02:06:32,811 --> 02:06:34,290
everything is happening.
So beatty suffers.

2178
02:06:34,291 --> 02:06:37,350
This hit on his own target at like 4:00,
two minutes later,

2179
02:06:37,680 --> 02:06:41,790
the HMS indefensible,
a somewhere in the 20,000

2180
02:06:41,820 --> 02:06:45,840
tons of battle cruiser explodes,

2181
02:06:47,350 --> 02:06:52,350
just explodes in a moment.
It's Churchill in the admiralty is 

2182
02:06:52,350 --> 02:06:53,680
nightmare come true.
I mean in a blink of an eye,

2183
02:06:53,950 --> 02:06:58,300
you have a towering cloud reaching up 
like 1500 feet.

2184
02:06:58,330 --> 02:07:00,470
Witnesses say you could see,
you know,

2185
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:06,000
funnels and guns and everything shooting
up into the horizon and both sides.

2186
02:07:07,631 --> 02:07:09,820
German and British watched this happen 
together

2187
02:07:12,130 --> 02:07:16,840
out of the more than 1000 sailors on 
board the indivisible to survive.

2188
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:20,170
It's hard not to include an account by 
one of them.

2189
02:07:20,470 --> 02:07:25,470
How do you not include an account of a 
survivor of a ship who's magazine gets 

2190
02:07:25,481 --> 02:07:30,481
penetrated and explodes with him on it?
I guess he was way up high in the top 

2191
02:07:30,481 --> 02:07:32,830
observational area.
D Still Call that a crows nest.

2192
02:07:32,831 --> 02:07:37,831
He said he was 180 feet high.
His name is c Follmer,

2193
02:07:38,290 --> 02:07:42,160
and here's how he describes the 
explosion of the hms into forgettable.

2194
02:07:42,580 --> 02:07:47,580
While he was on board,
there was a terrific explosion aboard 

2195
02:07:47,580 --> 02:07:48,670
the ship.
The magazines went.

2196
02:07:48,940 --> 02:07:52,390
I saw the guns go up in the air just 
like matchsticks 12 inch guns.

2197
02:07:52,391 --> 02:07:57,391
They were bodies and everything.
She was beginning to settle down within 

2198
02:07:57,391 --> 02:08:01,801
half a minute.
The ship turned right over and she was 

2199
02:08:01,801 --> 02:08:03,931
gone.
I was 180 feet up and I was thrown well 

2200
02:08:03,931 --> 02:08:03,931
clear of the ship.

2201
02:08:03,931 --> 02:08:04,780
Otherwise I would have been sucked 
under.

2202
02:08:05,050 --> 02:08:08,680
I was practically unconscious turning 
over really at last.

2203
02:08:08,681 --> 02:08:10,960
I came on top of the water.
When I came up,

2204
02:08:10,961 --> 02:08:14,410
there was another fellow named Jimmy 
Green and we got a piece of wood.

2205
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:18,490
He was on one end and I was on the other
end a couple of minutes afterwards.

2206
02:08:18,491 --> 02:08:21,670
Some shells came over and Jim was minus 
his head,

2207
02:08:21,850 --> 02:08:26,850
so I was left on my lonesome and to 
quote now about 20 minutes after that,

2208
02:08:30,550 --> 02:08:35,550
the HMS Queen Mary,
another one of these battle cruisers 

2209
02:08:35,550 --> 02:08:37,060
explodes same way.
I mean a little bit different.

2210
02:08:37,061 --> 02:08:42,061
I mean she gets hit and then there's 
this pause and sailors are jumping into 

2211
02:08:42,061 --> 02:08:45,571
the water and then she explodes.
We have accounts from sailors who were 

2212
02:08:45,571 --> 02:08:49,351
in the water who said that the sky was.
All of a sudden just filled with all 

2213
02:08:49,351 --> 02:08:52,381
this massively heavy debris that was 
falling down on them in the water and 

2214
02:08:52,391 --> 02:08:57,391
they're all diving under the water 
trying to escape giant funnels and big 

2215
02:08:57,391 --> 02:08:59,890
metal objects falling on them and 
probably a lot of them didn't escape.

2216
02:09:00,100 --> 02:09:03,220
Again,
more than a thousand of these sailors on

2217
02:09:03,221 --> 02:09:06,070
board.
A small handful rescued afterwards,

2218
02:09:06,071 --> 02:09:11,071
less than less than 25 and at one point 
admiral beatty turns to a subordinate 

2219
02:09:11,781 --> 02:09:16,781
and says,
there seems to be something wrong with 

2220
02:09:16,781 --> 02:09:16,781
our bloody ships today.
And he's right.

2221
02:09:17,350 --> 02:09:22,350
They're not passing the acid test.
The hypothesis that you know was the 

2222
02:09:23,291 --> 02:09:26,580
philosophical underpinnings of this 
entire class of warships,

2223
02:09:26,590 --> 02:09:29,980
at least on the British side,
is proving to be flawed.

2224
02:09:31,420 --> 02:09:36,420
They don't have enough armor.
Speed is not turning out to be their 

2225
02:09:36,551 --> 02:09:41,551
armor and when their armor gets pierced,
you know the way they're handling this 

2226
02:09:41,861 --> 02:09:46,861
ammunition and the lack of flash 
protectors and some other things means 

2227
02:09:46,861 --> 02:09:50,110
that the magazine is catching on fire 
and exploding way too easily and you can

2228
02:09:50,111 --> 02:09:52,660
tell that it's happening too easily 
because I'm my German side.

2229
02:09:52,661 --> 02:09:56,770
It's not happening.
They sacrificed in some other areas,

2230
02:09:56,771 --> 02:09:58,270
their guns are smaller,
for example,

2231
02:09:58,271 --> 02:10:01,050
they're a little slower in order to a 
slab,

2232
02:10:01,060 --> 02:10:03,430
some more armor over,
some of these vulnerable points,

2233
02:10:03,431 --> 02:10:08,431
and they're not blowing up again.
These Germans build ships like Mercedes 

2234
02:10:10,861 --> 02:10:15,861
and they're taking a pounding while they
are running away.

2235
02:10:17,140 --> 02:10:22,140
Now that's,
that's what you have to notice and 

2236
02:10:22,140 --> 02:10:22,140
what's happening in these battles.
You know these ships are not stationary,

2237
02:10:22,140 --> 02:10:23,860
they're not anchored in staying in the 
same spot.

2238
02:10:23,861 --> 02:10:27,070
They're all moving and they're all 
moving in a specific direction.

2239
02:10:27,071 --> 02:10:30,790
The British are chasing the Germans and 
the Germans are moving away.

2240
02:10:31,300 --> 02:10:33,040
Now,
if you were the British admiral,

2241
02:10:33,050 --> 02:10:35,480
this makes perfect sense to you.
You've got the bigger ships,

2242
02:10:35,481 --> 02:10:40,481
right?
And until they start exploding around 

2243
02:10:40,481 --> 02:10:40,481
you,
you have more of them.

2244
02:10:40,481 --> 02:10:41,660
Besides that,
you have a bunch of big brand new,

2245
02:10:41,661 --> 02:10:44,510
the newest,
most awesome battle ships in the world.

2246
02:10:44,511 --> 02:10:48,500
Their Queen Elizabeth Class,
I've already mentioned war spite,

2247
02:10:48,501 --> 02:10:49,360
Malaya,
valiant,

2248
02:10:49,361 --> 02:10:52,340
and all these famous ships that will all
fight in the second world war.

2249
02:10:52,510 --> 02:10:55,460
They are fresh off the docks,
15 inch guns,

2250
02:10:55,461 --> 02:10:56,600
30,000
tons,

2251
02:10:56,810 --> 02:11:01,810
13 inches of armor and babies got them 
with him so you darn right,

2252
02:11:02,451 --> 02:11:03,860
these Germans are going to run away.

2253
02:11:03,860 --> 02:11:05,630
Nevermind that.
You know,

2254
02:11:05,631 --> 02:11:09,680
I tried to communicate with those 
battleships using flags.

2255
02:11:10,660 --> 02:11:13,420
When you talk about Murphy's law,
interposing,

2256
02:11:13,450 --> 02:11:18,450
it's will on this battle.
Part of it has to do with things that 

2257
02:11:18,450 --> 02:11:18,450
just look so silly.
In hindsight.

2258
02:11:18,450 --> 02:11:23,081
You know these ships have radio.
Sometimes these admirals are not that 

2259
02:11:23,081 --> 02:11:24,110
cool about using it.
Sometimes it has problems by the way,

2260
02:11:24,111 --> 02:11:29,111
so sometimes they're blameless,
but a lot of times these animals are 

2261
02:11:29,111 --> 02:11:32,411
like the old guy trying to use the 
computer and there's so much more 

2262
02:11:32,411 --> 02:11:36,881
comfortable with the way they were 
brought up and the things that they did 

2263
02:11:36,881 --> 02:11:40,631
in the maneuvers in peace time.
And one of the ways these ships 

2264
02:11:40,631 --> 02:11:43,640
communicate is by running the orders of 
the admiral up on a flagpole.

2265
02:11:43,641 --> 02:11:46,250
They have all these different flags and 
each one means something different.

2266
02:11:46,251 --> 02:11:49,130
So when the admiral wants to communicate
to the fleet,

2267
02:11:49,131 --> 02:11:54,131
his orders,
they run a flag up the flag pole on his 

2268
02:11:54,131 --> 02:11:54,131
ship,
the flagship,

2269
02:11:54,131 --> 02:11:54,560
and then every other ship is supposed 
to,

2270
02:11:54,561 --> 02:11:59,561
as they see it,
run up the same one and you get the 

2271
02:11:59,561 --> 02:11:59,561
message across.

2272
02:11:59,561 --> 02:12:02,470
But this is a method that was used a 
hundred years before in Lord Nelson's 

2273
02:12:02,470 --> 02:12:07,361
time when they're fighting Napoleon at 
ranges that are exponentially shorter.

2274
02:12:08,841 --> 02:12:11,300
Does that make sense?
Exponentially shorter than the distances

2275
02:12:11,301 --> 02:12:14,210
in this battle without the smoke and all
these other things.

2276
02:12:14,211 --> 02:12:19,211
And in the peace time training,
it seemed to work fine in the rigors of 

2277
02:12:19,211 --> 02:12:21,200
combat.
It's not working fine.

2278
02:12:21,230 --> 02:12:26,230
And the big battleships don't see the 
flag change when beatty tells them to do

2279
02:12:27,111 --> 02:12:28,250
things.
And um,

2280
02:12:28,280 --> 02:12:31,200
they're not here when this battle first 
happens,

2281
02:12:31,220 --> 02:12:32,750
they've been playing catch up the whole 
bottle,

2282
02:12:32,751 --> 02:12:37,751
but now you know,
are arriving on the scene and their 

2283
02:12:37,751 --> 02:12:37,751
shells are falling sort of by the 
Germans.

2284
02:12:37,751 --> 02:12:40,760
And now the British think they've got 
these German battlecruisers pin down.

2285
02:12:40,790 --> 02:12:45,790
Even if you know you're losing a few of 
your battle cruisers while you chase 

2286
02:12:45,790 --> 02:12:48,881
them.
But what they don't know is that those 

2287
02:12:48,881 --> 02:12:51,341
battlecruisers are leading them into the
mall of the entire German navy,

2288
02:12:52,071 --> 02:12:54,050
which is coming up from about 40 miles 
away,

2289
02:12:54,051 --> 02:12:59,051
moving towards them.
What started off as the German trap 

2290
02:12:59,051 --> 02:13:03,850
flipped into the British counter trap,
evolved and morphed into the encounter 

2291
02:13:03,850 --> 02:13:08,261
battle has now by almost improvisational
luck,

2292
02:13:09,590 --> 02:13:14,590
become a German ambush again,
if successful,

2293
02:13:15,290 --> 02:13:20,290
the German fleet could wipe out four or 
five battle cruisers and four of the 

2294
02:13:21,771 --> 02:13:25,340
newest ships in the British navy,
it would be,

2295
02:13:25,430 --> 02:13:28,340
I'm sure Winston Churchill would say,
I'm sure I could speak for him here,

2296
02:13:28,670 --> 02:13:32,850
a catastrophe and the Germans on the 
verge of making it happen,

2297
02:13:34,380 --> 02:13:39,380
and then a light cruiser scouting for 
the British sees the entire German fleet

2298
02:13:42,780 --> 02:13:47,780
on the horizon and radios the message 
back to Amarillo beatty and the grand 

2299
02:13:47,780 --> 02:13:52,551
fleet under Admiral Jellicoe farther 
away and beatty sees those Germans very 

2300
02:13:52,551 --> 02:13:56,820
quickly too with the naked eye.
The first thing he does when he realizes

2301
02:13:56,821 --> 02:14:01,821
he's been baited into this trap is turn 
his battle cruisers a hundred and 80 

2302
02:14:01,821 --> 02:14:04,500
degrees in the other direction and start
booking out of there.

2303
02:14:05,310 --> 02:14:07,410
Once again,
Murphy's law,

2304
02:14:07,470 --> 02:14:10,650
I'll say that many times in this battle 
if I go too deeply into it,

2305
02:14:10,950 --> 02:14:15,950
um,
once again he runs up the flag saying 

2306
02:14:15,950 --> 02:14:17,040
turnaround and the big battleships,
the brand new ones don't see it and they

2307
02:14:17,041 --> 02:14:21,030
will end up exposed out there to the 
entire German fleet for a while taking a

2308
02:14:21,031 --> 02:14:25,710
pounding and dishing one out too.
It should be pointed out nonetheless,

2309
02:14:26,040 --> 02:14:29,610
what Admiral Beatty has done by turning 
180 degrees away,

2310
02:14:30,090 --> 02:14:35,090
his turn himself into bait and the 
Germans are following and beatty is 

2311
02:14:36,211 --> 02:14:41,211
running back towards his big fleet,
which is coming up from also about 40 

2312
02:14:41,211 --> 02:14:45,591
miles away.
So now he's flipped the ambush once 

2313
02:14:45,591 --> 02:14:48,441
again and now the Germans are heading 
toward the only fleet that is still 

2314
02:14:48,841 --> 02:14:51,840
invisible on this naval battlefield to 
anyone.

2315
02:14:52,590 --> 02:14:55,620
The Germans don't know that the British 
grand fleet is up ahead of them,

2316
02:14:58,070 --> 02:15:01,490
but now the British Grand Fleet knows 
that the Germans are coming.

2317
02:15:02,120 --> 02:15:05,390
An Admiral Jellicoe in a,
in a very brave move.

2318
02:15:05,391 --> 02:15:07,160
I mean he's operating without enough 
information.

2319
02:15:07,161 --> 02:15:09,670
Once again,
admiral beatty gets blamed for not given

2320
02:15:09,671 --> 02:15:10,030
him,
you know,

2321
02:15:10,040 --> 02:15:15,040
good positional information or whatnot,
but a lot of this falls into the 

2322
02:15:15,040 --> 02:15:16,250
category of.
It's a dress rehearsal to these guys.

2323
02:15:16,251 --> 02:15:21,251
A lot of their errors are the kinds of 
things they would have corrected if 

2324
02:15:21,251 --> 02:15:22,020
they'd had a chance to practice it in,
you know,

2325
02:15:22,130 --> 02:15:25,370
combat situations.
Unfortunately these are a lot of,

2326
02:15:25,371 --> 02:15:27,440
you know,
you wouldn't call them rookie mistakes,

2327
02:15:27,441 --> 02:15:32,441
but.
But you would correct these before the 

2328
02:15:32,441 --> 02:15:32,441
next battle.
Nonetheless,

2329
02:15:32,441 --> 02:15:35,480
jellicoe takes a chance,
deploys the entire British grand fleet,

2330
02:15:35,481 --> 02:15:39,170
which is more than 100,
ships over 15,

2331
02:15:39,171 --> 02:15:42,410
20 square miles of ocean.
It takes 15 to 20 minutes.

2332
02:15:42,411 --> 02:15:47,411
That's how well trained this fleet is.
And he deploys the whole thing and he's 

2333
02:15:47,411 --> 02:15:50,120
waiting for the Germans to arrive and 
the Germans are now in the midst,

2334
02:15:50,630 --> 02:15:51,610
right?
This battlefields,

2335
02:15:51,620 --> 02:15:56,620
very misty and you'll,
you'll run through fog banks and you 

2336
02:15:56,620 --> 02:15:57,380
won't see things for awhile and the 
Germans can't see what's going on.

2337
02:15:58,310 --> 02:16:03,310
And famously Amro hipper,
who's the German admiral in charge of 

2338
02:16:03,310 --> 02:16:06,311
the battlecruisers radios,
Admiral Shear the head of the entire 

2339
02:16:06,311 --> 02:16:08,810
German navy,
who's with the German fleet here,

2340
02:16:08,990 --> 02:16:13,990
and he famously looks off into the mist 
and tell sheer something lurks in that 

2341
02:16:13,990 --> 02:16:18,971
soup.
We would do well not to thrust into it 

2342
02:16:18,971 --> 02:16:19,280
too deeply,
too late.

2343
02:16:20,940 --> 02:16:24,780
The first thing that happens is,
is the German start taking some fire and

2344
02:16:24,781 --> 02:16:29,781
they don't know from where big guns.
And then all of a sudden the missed 

2345
02:16:29,781 --> 02:16:30,040
parts for a.
and

2346
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:34,840
it's a nother British battlecruisers the
invincible.

2347
02:16:35,830 --> 02:16:39,220
And as soon as the mist parts in the 
invincible becomes clear,

2348
02:16:39,520 --> 02:16:44,520
you know,
it doesn't take 90 seconds before big 

2349
02:16:44,520 --> 02:16:46,771
German guns are opening fire,
the shells pouring down on the 

2350
02:16:46,771 --> 02:16:48,730
invincible.
And like the other two battle cruisers,

2351
02:16:48,731 --> 02:16:50,350
the invincible explodes.

2352
02:16:51,850 --> 02:16:54,430
So if anybody has forgotten in the 
intervening,

2353
02:16:54,820 --> 02:16:56,620
you know,
hour or two,

2354
02:16:56,650 --> 02:16:58,870
since the earlier battlecruisers 
exploded,

2355
02:16:59,140 --> 02:17:01,780
that this design is proving to be 
somewhat flawed.

2356
02:17:02,020 --> 02:17:07,020
The explosion of the invincible before 
the two main fleets collide is a 

2357
02:17:07,020 --> 02:17:09,400
historical reminder.
Nonetheless.

2358
02:17:09,401 --> 02:17:14,401
It's only soon after that that the 
Germans emerge from the mist to find the

2359
02:17:15,041 --> 02:17:20,041
entire deployed British fleet waiting 
for them in like a crescent around the 

2360
02:17:20,921 --> 02:17:25,210
horizon and sheer says the minute that 
they can see what's happening,

2361
02:17:25,240 --> 02:17:28,390
the entire horizon erupts in a sheet of 
flame.

2362
02:17:28,800 --> 02:17:30,460
Now these ships are a long way from each
other,

2363
02:17:30,461 --> 02:17:34,330
almost invisible to the naked eye,
smudges up against the horizon.

2364
02:17:34,600 --> 02:17:39,600
You see like the smoke of all the ships 
and then you see like the flash of the 

2365
02:17:39,821 --> 02:17:43,210
guns and just like lightening and 
thunder where you see the lightening and

2366
02:17:43,211 --> 02:17:45,100
then there's this delay and then the 
thunder arrives.

2367
02:17:45,220 --> 02:17:50,220
Same thing.
You see this flash and it's silent and 

2368
02:17:50,220 --> 02:17:53,551
then boom,
the boom hits you after the shells have 

2369
02:17:53,551 --> 02:17:55,600
already passed over and you know there 
are destroyers in these battles.

2370
02:17:55,601 --> 02:17:56,790
We haven't even talked about all the 
lights.

2371
02:17:56,791 --> 02:17:58,110
Ships running around,
you know,

2372
02:17:58,120 --> 02:18:01,420
sort of parrying and like,
like a bunch of little gnats between the

2373
02:18:01,421 --> 02:18:06,421
battle fleet and these destroyers 
sometimes describe what it's like when 

2374
02:18:06,421 --> 02:18:09,670
these giant shells pass over their heads
and they say they sound like locomotives

2375
02:18:09,850 --> 02:18:12,460
when they screech over your little ships
head,

2376
02:18:13,060 --> 02:18:15,310
but when they fall in front of your 
little ship,

2377
02:18:15,311 --> 02:18:19,450
you're like your little destroyer.
They raise geysers of water,

2378
02:18:19,810 --> 02:18:24,810
sometimes 100,
sometimes 200 feet up into the air and 

2379
02:18:24,810 --> 02:18:27,850
it's composed of tons of liquid,
which then falls back down to earth.

2380
02:18:27,851 --> 02:18:32,851
And these destroyers,
these little ships are sometimes beaten 

2381
02:18:32,851 --> 02:18:34,270
up pretty severely by all this water 
smashing back down into them.

2382
02:18:34,271 --> 02:18:37,750
Some people are splashed overboard and 
all these kinds of things.

2383
02:18:39,380 --> 02:18:44,380
Nonetheless,
Admiral Jellicoe has performed a famous 

2384
02:18:44,380 --> 02:18:48,371
naval maneuver that you never want to be
on the receiving end of called crossing 

2385
02:18:48,371 --> 02:18:51,530
the t where he's formed the top crossbar
of the t and poor shear.

2386
02:18:51,531 --> 02:18:53,750
And the Germans form the,
um,

2387
02:18:54,510 --> 02:18:59,510
you know,
vertical line of the t and every one of 

2388
02:18:59,510 --> 02:19:02,261
the British ships can fire on the German
ships individually as they come to the 

2389
02:19:02,261 --> 02:19:04,610
front of the line.
It's a disaster very quickly.

2390
02:19:04,620 --> 02:19:08,000
Sheer gets hit with more than 22 heavy 
shells fast.

2391
02:19:08,001 --> 02:19:13,001
And within 10 minutes shear has quite 
tactically adroitly by the way,

2392
02:19:13,431 --> 02:19:18,431
turned his fleet around and disappeared 
back into the mist and once again 

2393
02:19:18,431 --> 02:19:19,460
without radar and all that kind of 
stuff,

2394
02:19:19,800 --> 02:19:20,660
uh,
hard to,

2395
02:19:20,820 --> 02:19:25,820
you know,
know where he is at that point and he 

2396
02:19:25,820 --> 02:19:27,251
sends out a bunch of light units and 
destroyers and what not to cover his 

2397
02:19:27,251 --> 02:19:27,251
escape.
So the,

2398
02:19:27,251 --> 02:19:27,980
the British can't just after them,
they might

2399
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:30,230
run into a bunch of torpedoes and mines 
and stuff.

2400
02:19:31,100 --> 02:19:36,100
And then inexplicably,
not too long after the sheer arrives 

2401
02:19:36,100 --> 02:19:39,941
back into visual range and you know,
people fire again and then sheer escapes

2402
02:19:40,221 --> 02:19:43,610
again because he got his t crossed for a
second time in one battle,

2403
02:19:43,611 --> 02:19:48,611
which is almost unheard of.
It shows you jellicoe is pretty darn 

2404
02:19:48,611 --> 02:19:51,041
good admiral.
And then there's a little night action 

2405
02:19:51,041 --> 02:19:53,591
between the light units,
but about this time admiral shares had 

2406
02:19:53,591 --> 02:19:55,280
enough.
You get your tea cross twice in one day.

2407
02:19:55,580 --> 02:20:00,580
It's time to call it a battle.
And Shear in the Germans manage to limp 

2408
02:20:00,580 --> 02:20:00,580
home

2409
02:20:02,180 --> 02:20:05,060
when all is said and done.
The British lose three battlecruisers,

2410
02:20:05,270 --> 02:20:10,270
three armored cruisers and destroyers,
while one German battle cruiser,

2411
02:20:10,670 --> 02:20:15,670
one pre dreadnought battleships for 
light cruisers and destroyers are sent 

2412
02:20:15,670 --> 02:20:20,021
to the bottom.
The casualties at Jutland are not 

2413
02:20:20,021 --> 02:20:22,520
significant.
They don't hurt either navy badly.

2414
02:20:22,970 --> 02:20:27,970
Uh,
the British learned their lesson about 

2415
02:20:27,970 --> 02:20:27,970
the battle cruiser design,
but the Germans are humbled,

2416
02:20:28,610 --> 02:20:31,190
you know,
they don't come out again in strength.

2417
02:20:31,191 --> 02:20:36,191
I mean there's,
there'll be a little encounter here and 

2418
02:20:36,191 --> 02:20:36,191
a little try there.
But,

2419
02:20:36,191 --> 02:20:38,671
but this is it.
They gave it an attempt and they seemed 

2420
02:20:39,020 --> 02:20:44,020
permanently shaken because of it.
The German surface fleet will not 

2421
02:20:44,020 --> 02:20:48,971
perform another militarily significant 
move in the war.

2422
02:20:50,680 --> 02:20:55,210
The only part of the German navy that's 
going to be relevant for the rest of the

2423
02:20:55,211 --> 02:21:00,211
war is the part that uses torpedoes to 
go after.

2424
02:21:00,401 --> 02:21:03,700
Not military targets,
but economic ones.

2425
02:21:05,470 --> 02:21:10,470
By 1916,
the economic side of this war is coming 

2426
02:21:10,841 --> 02:21:11,710
to the fore.

2427
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:19,000
We begin to see what war on this scale 
is like when it becomes part of the 

2428
02:21:21,231 --> 02:21:26,231
normal life of all of these countries.
Do you know this isn't a new phenomenon 

2429
02:21:26,361 --> 02:21:28,400
anymore?
By 1916,

2430
02:21:28,580 --> 02:21:33,580
by the middle of 1916,
we've been doing this for two years and 

2431
02:21:33,580 --> 02:21:37,931
it's been sucking up more and more of 
the energy of these nation states that 

2432
02:21:37,931 --> 02:21:42,401
are involved in the conflict.
It's very unlike the way most wars by 

2433
02:21:42,401 --> 02:21:46,901
these powers had been fought where the 
civilian population might not even know 

2434
02:21:46,901 --> 02:21:51,311
a war is happening if it was happening,
they certainly weren't directly or 

2435
02:21:51,921 --> 02:21:55,220
importantly impacted.
This war is different.

2436
02:21:56,360 --> 02:21:57,950
First of all,
it's life or death.

2437
02:21:59,120 --> 02:22:04,120
The stakes are so high that everybody's 
involved and the armies are requiring 

2438
02:22:04,120 --> 02:22:06,680
such immense amounts of stuff.
You know,

2439
02:22:06,681 --> 02:22:11,681
the Germans will call this material 
schlock the war of material that the 

2440
02:22:11,681 --> 02:22:16,091
entire civilian population and the 
production capacity of all these 

2441
02:22:16,091 --> 02:22:18,140
countries gets warped.
Trying to provide it.

2442
02:22:19,420 --> 02:22:23,050
As historian Gwynne Dyer says,
quote,

2443
02:22:23,470 --> 02:22:26,130
it is significant that the phrase 
homefront

2444
02:22:26,460 --> 02:22:30,720
came into use during World War One when 
the role of munitions workers,

2445
02:22:30,721 --> 02:22:35,721
enough civilian production more 
generally was becoming as important to 

2446
02:22:35,721 --> 02:22:39,411
victory as the soldiers in the trenches 
without a constant flow of supplies 

2447
02:22:39,411 --> 02:22:41,520
equal to the vast consumption at the 
front.

2448
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:45,940
The soldiers would soon be helpless,
and since the mobilization of so huge,

2449
02:22:45,941 --> 02:22:49,980
a number of men left vast gaps in the 
normal workforce,

2450
02:22:50,250 --> 02:22:53,610
France had put 20 percent of its entire 
population into uniform,

2451
02:22:53,880 --> 02:22:56,610
Germany,
18 percent and the other major powers,

2452
02:22:56,611 --> 02:23:01,611
not much less.
The remaining adult civilians had to be 

2453
02:23:01,611 --> 02:23:05,091
directed by government into whatever 
jobs were needed to keep production 

2454
02:23:05,091 --> 02:23:05,190
going.
In effect,

2455
02:23:05,370 --> 02:23:10,370
the civilian economy he writes,
was conscripted to the governments of 

2456
02:23:10,370 --> 02:23:13,530
Europe quickly took control over labor 
and raw materials,

2457
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:16,050
imposed rationing,
scarce goods,

2458
02:23:16,140 --> 02:23:21,140
and created true war economies.
Women flooded into factories to replace 

2459
02:23:21,140 --> 02:23:26,121
the men at the front and most production
beyond the basic needs of subsistence 

2460
02:23:26,121 --> 02:23:28,440
was diverted into the war effort and 
quote,

2461
02:23:29,640 --> 02:23:31,890
diyers,
also the one that said,

2462
02:23:31,891 --> 02:23:33,630
by this time,
quote,

2463
02:23:33,960 --> 02:23:38,160
battles had become an industrial 
operation in reverse.

2464
02:23:38,460 --> 02:23:42,510
In which the rates of destruction at the
front matched the rates of production in

2465
02:23:42,511 --> 02:23:44,670
the industry's at home.
And to quote,

2466
02:23:45,090 --> 02:23:49,350
I think of guys like the British 
military leader,

2467
02:23:49,440 --> 02:23:54,440
Hey meg,
or even the German military leader 

2468
02:23:54,440 --> 02:23:57,650
General Eric Von Falcon Han and I think 
about all these skills that they're 

2469
02:23:57,650 --> 02:24:02,151
required to have now above and beyond 
what you would think of as a normal 

2470
02:24:02,251 --> 02:24:05,400
generals skills.
And you saw this in earlier wars.

2471
02:24:05,401 --> 02:24:10,401
There's famous stories of General 
Sherman in the civil war in the United 

2472
02:24:10,401 --> 02:24:14,780
States being extra qualified for modern 
warfare because of all these failed jobs

2473
02:24:14,911 --> 02:24:19,911
in private industry.
He'd had the taught him all these 

2474
02:24:19,911 --> 02:24:20,700
lessons that no one knew at general 
would need in modern warfare.

2475
02:24:20,701 --> 02:24:22,740
Things about logistics and stuff like 
that.

2476
02:24:23,190 --> 02:24:26,310
But by 1916,
you a guy like,

2477
02:24:26,311 --> 02:24:28,630
hey,
a cavalry commander.

2478
02:24:28,631 --> 02:24:31,230
It looks like he would be totally out of
his element,

2479
02:24:31,650 --> 02:24:34,290
uh,
dealing with the modern production needs

2480
02:24:34,291 --> 02:24:37,010
of warfare as indeed he was Falcon 
Hines,

2481
02:24:37,020 --> 02:24:38,820
a bit more scientific of a guy.

2482
02:24:39,060 --> 02:24:39,870
And he's,
you know,

2483
02:24:39,871 --> 02:24:42,400
I was trying to think if I were general 
fall behind,

2484
02:24:42,410 --> 02:24:43,830
if this were a war game.
And,

2485
02:24:43,831 --> 02:24:48,831
you know,
I played a lot of those in my time and 

2486
02:24:48,831 --> 02:24:49,350
I,
and I got a signed because I don't think

2487
02:24:49,351 --> 02:24:50,810
I would take Germany,
uh,

2488
02:24:50,860 --> 02:24:53,580
if I had a choice of which side of the 
war game I wanted to play,

2489
02:24:53,700 --> 02:24:57,210
but let's say I get assigned to Germany 
and I command and played Germany in this

2490
02:24:57,211 --> 02:25:00,210
war game and I'm Falcon,
you know,

2491
02:25:00,390 --> 02:25:05,390
the estimates are,
especially during this time period that 

2492
02:25:05,390 --> 02:25:05,670
if you include the colonial subjects of 
the,

2493
02:25:05,700 --> 02:25:07,860
of the powers in Europe during this time
period,

2494
02:25:08,160 --> 02:25:13,160
my enemies in this war,
if I'm falling behind and have $750 

2495
02:25:13,160 --> 02:25:18,051
million people they can call on for 
their value in their effort.

2496
02:25:18,451 --> 02:25:23,451
And in some cases their lives.
My side of the alliance has about $150 

2497
02:25:23,921 --> 02:25:24,370
million.

2498
02:25:25,390 --> 02:25:27,550
My enemies have the greatest fleet in 
the world.

2499
02:25:27,551 --> 02:25:30,790
And I just learned at the battle of 
Jutland that my navy can't come anywhere

2500
02:25:30,791 --> 02:25:31,540
near touching them

2501
02:25:34,150 --> 02:25:37,150
and they've shut down all of my overseas
trade.

2502
02:25:37,750 --> 02:25:40,540
So if I'm General Falcon High and 
already I'm sitting here going,

2503
02:25:40,930 --> 02:25:45,930
wow,
now you look at the lineup in terms of 

2504
02:25:45,930 --> 02:25:47,020
the kinds of countries in each alliance,
right?

2505
02:25:47,021 --> 02:25:52,021
You have the British and the French and 
the Russians as the three big guys in 

2506
02:25:52,021 --> 02:25:55,150
the allied Entente alliance.
These are all first rate powers.

2507
02:25:55,151 --> 02:25:56,980
Betsy power,
best land power,

2508
02:25:57,360 --> 02:25:59,470
biggest power,
all three together.

2509
02:25:59,560 --> 02:26:04,560
Wow.
And then they have a bunch of other 

2510
02:26:04,560 --> 02:26:05,530
countries like Italy and smaller powers.
That's a very powerful force.

2511
02:26:05,531 --> 02:26:08,650
Who Do I have on my side?
Austria,

2512
02:26:08,651 --> 02:26:10,780
Hungary,
Bulgaria and Turkey.

2513
02:26:10,781 --> 02:26:14,110
Basically,
none of those powers are first rate.

2514
02:26:14,290 --> 02:26:17,440
At least the Turks aren't asking me for 
help all the time.

2515
02:26:17,441 --> 02:26:20,140
If I'm Falcon nine though,
they're putting on a pretty brave fight.

2516
02:26:20,141 --> 02:26:22,570
They've managed to kick the British,
French,

2517
02:26:22,630 --> 02:26:23,980
South Africans,
Indians,

2518
02:26:24,160 --> 02:26:27,510
New Zealanders and Australians out of 
Gullapalli in January,

2519
02:26:27,530 --> 02:26:30,760
1916.
That's unexpected.

2520
02:26:31,340 --> 02:26:33,830
They've managed to beat the British 
forces,

2521
02:26:33,831 --> 02:26:38,831
mostly Indian troops in a place called 
coot and modern day Iraq trap them in a 

2522
02:26:38,831 --> 02:26:43,121
fortress.
They're forced them to surrender and 

2523
02:26:43,121 --> 02:26:44,450
took them on a death march,
but it really doesn't impact Falcon hind

2524
02:26:44,480 --> 02:26:45,530
very much.
One way or the other,

2525
02:26:45,800 --> 02:26:50,800
it's just nice for him to know that the 
Turks are winning as opposed to losing 

2526
02:26:50,800 --> 02:26:50,840
because they are losing against the 
Russians,

2527
02:26:50,841 --> 02:26:52,310
but it's a mixed bag.
Remember,

2528
02:26:52,490 --> 02:26:57,490
the Turks are tough,
but they are not quite a 20th century 

2529
02:26:57,490 --> 02:27:01,841
army,
so those are all that's gravy to Falcon 

2530
02:27:01,841 --> 02:27:01,841
Hein.
The bigger problem,

2531
02:27:01,841 --> 02:27:04,130
if you're [inaudible] hine is your,
your close allies,

2532
02:27:04,131 --> 02:27:07,460
the Austro-hungarian,
they're a pain in the rear.

2533
02:27:07,610 --> 02:27:12,610
They don't listen to you to begin with.
You're having fights with their main 

2534
02:27:12,610 --> 02:27:15,341
military leaders and then they go do 
what they want anyway and then they 

2535
02:27:15,341 --> 02:27:18,791
screw up because they didn't follow your
advice and then they come to you and 

2536
02:27:18,791 --> 02:27:18,791
say,
will you bail us out?

2537
02:27:18,791 --> 02:27:23,200
If you're falling behind?
They're a pain in the rear and he's 

2538
02:27:23,200 --> 02:27:25,541
continually having to take scarce troop 
from places like Verdun and instead 

2539
02:27:26,360 --> 02:27:31,360
taking the train,
sending them over east and and saving 

2540
02:27:31,360 --> 02:27:31,640
the Hungarians Bacon.

2541
02:27:32,820 --> 02:27:35,280
Can't really blame them though.
They're in big trouble anyway.

2542
02:27:35,460 --> 02:27:37,680
They may not have been a country in 
1920,

2543
02:27:37,681 --> 02:27:39,510
even if there hadn't been a first world 
war.

2544
02:27:39,780 --> 02:27:42,990
They're made up of 11 major ethnic 
groups in that state,

2545
02:27:43,230 --> 02:27:48,230
some of whom don't want to be there,
and their army is a microcosm of their 

2546
02:27:48,230 --> 02:27:52,611
state and you've got troops who don't 
even want to be in your empire at times 

2547
02:27:53,790 --> 02:27:57,390
on the front line that you're asking to 
die for your empire.

2548
02:27:57,420 --> 02:28:02,420
It's not a good situation.
They're constantly getting into trouble 

2549
02:28:02,420 --> 02:28:05,871
and as one German diplomat famously says
about Germany's situation with Austria 

2550
02:28:05,971 --> 02:28:10,020
hungry,
we are fettered to a corpse were tied to

2551
02:28:10,021 --> 02:28:13,140
a dead guy,
and that's the Austro-hungarian forced.

2552
02:28:13,141 --> 02:28:15,960
Now in your favor,
if you're Falcon Hine,

2553
02:28:16,200 --> 02:28:19,920
you probably have the best army in the 
world.

2554
02:28:20,280 --> 02:28:21,890
The 1916

2555
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:27,100
German army is fantastic.
It's a combination of the best aspects 

2556
02:28:27,621 --> 02:28:30,260
of the 1914 force that Germany went to 
war with,

2557
02:28:31,010 --> 02:28:36,010
but battle hardened by experience.
Here's the way writer in Passingham 

2558
02:28:36,560 --> 02:28:37,520
describes it,
quote,

2559
02:28:38,120 --> 02:28:42,020
it is true that the German army on the 
western front by early 1916,

2560
02:28:42,200 --> 02:28:45,290
was more skilled and better equipped for
trench warfare.

2561
02:28:45,291 --> 02:28:48,740
The neither the British or the French.
This is not too surprising.

2562
02:28:48,741 --> 02:28:51,130
He says,
as the British expeditionary force,

2563
02:28:51,131 --> 02:28:54,800
it only just expanded its army from 
around 250,000

2564
02:28:54,980 --> 02:28:59,980
in 1914 to just over a million,
largely inexperienced men and the French

2565
02:29:00,441 --> 02:29:05,441
he writes,
had always been uncomfortable with the 

2566
02:29:05,441 --> 02:29:06,530
notion of defensive operations rather 
than the offensive spirit.

2567
02:29:07,130 --> 02:29:08,330
He then says,
quote,

2568
02:29:08,630 --> 02:29:11,000
many of the German veterans of the 
inconclusive,

2569
02:29:11,001 --> 02:29:16,001
though bitter fighting at IPA,
Chappelle artois champagne and loose in 

2570
02:29:16,001 --> 02:29:20,141
1915 had survived and stiffened,
didn't army that had been well led at 

2571
02:29:20,141 --> 02:29:23,300
the sharp end and remained resolute 
against allied efforts in the West.

2572
02:29:23,570 --> 02:29:28,570
It had come close to beating the Russian
armies on the eastern front in that 

2573
02:29:28,570 --> 02:29:28,570
year.
Also,

2574
02:29:28,570 --> 02:29:30,530
in short,
as John Terrain has noted,

2575
02:29:30,740 --> 02:29:34,370
it must never be forgotten that the 
German army of that period was very good

2576
02:29:34,371 --> 02:29:39,371
indeed and quote.
So that's what you bring to the table.

2577
02:29:40,310 --> 02:29:45,310
Is that enough?
Is having the best army in the world 

2578
02:29:45,310 --> 02:29:45,920
enough.
And by the way,

2579
02:29:45,921 --> 02:29:49,340
that's something you traditionally think
of when you think of the French,

2580
02:29:49,820 --> 02:29:52,540
but it's safe to say,
I think that since about 18,

2581
02:29:52,580 --> 02:29:57,580
70,
the Germans have the best army in the 

2582
02:29:57,580 --> 02:29:59,951
world.
Will that compensate for all the 

2583
02:29:59,951 --> 02:30:01,370
downsides of the central powers?
Have hard to know.

2584
02:30:01,970 --> 02:30:06,970
One of the worst is the fact that the 
left hand and the right hand don't know 

2585
02:30:06,970 --> 02:30:07,010
what each other are doing in the central
powers.

2586
02:30:07,310 --> 02:30:09,230
The Austrians go off the reservation all
the time.

2587
02:30:09,231 --> 02:30:11,600
Don't tell anybody what they're doing,
don't get any approval,

2588
02:30:11,601 --> 02:30:15,530
don't work together with anyone,
and it's a handicap,

2589
02:30:15,531 --> 02:30:20,531
especially when the allies slash entente
forces are pretty darn good at this.

2590
02:30:21,320 --> 02:30:26,320
They have an agreement that they made in
1915 to come to the aid of each other 

2591
02:30:26,320 --> 02:30:29,651
when hard pressed,
when the Germans launch for done within 

2592
02:30:29,651 --> 02:30:32,981
a month,
the Russians come riding to the rescue 

2593
02:30:32,981 --> 02:30:35,681
in Lithuania trying to help they launch 
an offensive that they are clearly not 

2594
02:30:35,901 --> 02:30:40,901
ready for and how could you be?
That would be a very short time in this 

2595
02:30:40,901 --> 02:30:43,700
period to have planned and stocked up 
for and carried out an offensive.

2596
02:30:44,330 --> 02:30:46,180
In March 19,
16,

2597
02:30:46,190 --> 02:30:51,190
the Russians throw human wave attacks at
the Germans and predictably get mowed 

2598
02:30:51,741 --> 02:30:52,910
down.
The Germans,

2599
02:30:53,210 --> 02:30:54,410
you know,
looking at the corpses,

2600
02:30:54,411 --> 02:30:59,411
thought these people totally untrained 
cannon fodder as though the Russians 

2601
02:30:59,411 --> 02:31:03,221
were willing to throw tons of human meat
at the Germans simply to scare them 

2602
02:31:03,831 --> 02:31:06,260
enough so that they would pull some 
units out of redundant,

2603
02:31:06,261 --> 02:31:11,261
takes some pressure off the French.
It was so inept that some of the 

2604
02:31:11,261 --> 02:31:15,881
casualties the Russian soldiers suffered
were because of being shelled by their 

2605
02:31:15,881 --> 02:31:16,220
own sides.
Artillery,

2606
02:31:16,221 --> 02:31:20,460
which is always a tragedy,
and 12,000

2607
02:31:20,460 --> 02:31:25,320
Russian soldiers froze in one night.
A lot of these were wounded,

2608
02:31:25,830 --> 02:31:27,230
bought a bunch,
were people that just,

2609
02:31:27,270 --> 02:31:32,270
you know,
we're out there in the cold without the 

2610
02:31:32,270 --> 02:31:34,101
proper stuff.
I mean the Russian logistics are 

2611
02:31:34,101 --> 02:31:34,740
traditionally pretty horrible,
especially in this period.

2612
02:31:35,100 --> 02:31:39,180
It shows you the nature of operations 
there.

2613
02:31:39,181 --> 02:31:43,020
The Russians are not generally thought 
of is handling these sorts of things.

2614
02:31:43,021 --> 02:31:48,021
Well and in March 1916,
they don't handle it well.

2615
02:31:49,530 --> 02:31:53,130
Again,
the worst part probably from the Russian

2616
02:31:53,131 --> 02:31:58,131
perspective though,
is they went to all that trouble and it 

2617
02:31:58,131 --> 02:31:58,260
didn't take any pressure off the French 
at Verdun.

2618
02:31:59,790 --> 02:32:04,770
The follow up effort though,
by the Russians on June fourth,

2619
02:32:04,771 --> 02:32:09,771
1916 will be handled much better,
surprisingly well.

2620
02:32:09,781 --> 02:32:14,781
If you're a guy like Falcon Hein and 
you've written off with a lot of your 

2621
02:32:14,781 --> 02:32:18,471
other generals,
any chance the Russians have of doing 

2622
02:32:18,471 --> 02:32:20,490
anything significant in 1916 on June 
fourth,

2623
02:32:20,491 --> 02:32:25,491
1916,
the Russians do something very 

2624
02:32:25,491 --> 02:32:27,591
significant lead by their unquestionably
best general in the first world war.

2625
02:32:28,380 --> 02:32:30,120
A guy named Bruce Hill off.

2626
02:32:31,560 --> 02:32:36,560
We had mentioned in an earlier episode 
that the Russians simply couldn't 

2627
02:32:36,560 --> 02:32:37,320
attack.
I mean they were.

2628
02:32:37,350 --> 02:32:40,020
They were okay sometimes on the defense,
but they couldn't attack on.

2629
02:32:40,021 --> 02:32:44,310
The problem is always the same.
They just have such an old fashioned,

2630
02:32:44,311 --> 02:32:49,311
not up to date logistic system that the 
farther you moved away from where you 

2631
02:32:49,561 --> 02:32:54,561
started,
the harder it was to get the supplies 

2632
02:32:54,561 --> 02:32:56,901
necessary for modern army to run.
But Brasil of is the most modern 

2633
02:32:57,331 --> 02:33:02,331
commander the Russians have.
He's been learning from fighting the 

2634
02:33:02,331 --> 02:33:04,500
best army in the world.
The Germans all this time,

2635
02:33:04,890 --> 02:33:09,890
and even though he's a cavalry commander
and they have a reputation for always 

2636
02:33:09,890 --> 02:33:13,011
being sort of old fashioned Bursa love,
embraces the new systems out there in 

2637
02:33:13,291 --> 02:33:14,610
the new technology.
For example,

2638
02:33:14,730 --> 02:33:18,150
he does something almost no Russian army
ever does in the first world war.

2639
02:33:18,151 --> 02:33:23,151
He uses aircraft to help as spotters and
to locate positions behind the lines and

2640
02:33:24,121 --> 02:33:29,121
for reconnaissance right there,
he's acting in a much more modern way 

2641
02:33:29,121 --> 02:33:33,111
than Russian armies do.
Remember we're talking about an army 

2642
02:33:33,111 --> 02:33:36,350
that for the entire length of the first 
world war will still be wearing cloth 

2643
02:33:36,421 --> 02:33:41,421
cap.
They never get metal helmets during the 

2644
02:33:41,421 --> 02:33:44,751
duration of the first world war.
So this is a very old fresh fashioned 

2645
02:33:44,751 --> 02:33:47,781
army law of takes.
What he can do that's modern and uses 

2646
02:33:47,781 --> 02:33:47,781
it.

2647
02:33:49,110 --> 02:33:53,490
He launches his famous offensive named 
after him on June fourth,

2648
02:33:53,491 --> 02:33:56,940
and he does so with a very modern 
artillery barrage intense but short.

2649
02:33:58,170 --> 02:34:01,860
He's used all sorts of camouflage to 
hide his intentions.

2650
02:34:01,861 --> 02:34:06,861
He went as far as painting fake trenches
on the ground behind his lines to 

2651
02:34:07,411 --> 02:34:10,920
confuse the Germans and the 
Austro-hungarian is on the other side.

2652
02:34:13,630 --> 02:34:18,630
And when he launches his attack,
he does so along an enormous front,

2653
02:34:19,780 --> 02:34:21,740
the eastern front,
very different than the western front,

2654
02:34:21,741 --> 02:34:26,741
and instead of being this really 
constrained small area which they can 

2655
02:34:26,741 --> 02:34:27,820
build a wall from side to side real 
easily,

2656
02:34:27,910 --> 02:34:31,540
it's a huge area,
so it's much more thinly defendant.

2657
02:34:31,541 --> 02:34:36,541
And what [inaudible] does is he attacks 
across this giant front with a half 

2658
02:34:36,760 --> 02:34:41,020
million men intending to break upon the 
defenses of the central powers,

2659
02:34:41,021 --> 02:34:46,021
like a way of breaks on a breakwater.
And knowing that in many places his 

2660
02:34:46,021 --> 02:34:49,720
forces will get pushed backwards.
But where he meets weakness,

2661
02:34:49,721 --> 02:34:54,721
they should burst through.
Here's the way writer Gj Meyer explains 

2662
02:34:54,721 --> 02:34:59,580
what happens on June fifth,
within hours after the artillery 

2663
02:35:00,071 --> 02:35:05,071
bombardments starts,
they have million Russian forces step 

2664
02:35:05,071 --> 02:35:08,350
out of their trenches and moved toward 
the mostly Austro-hungarian lines,

2665
02:35:08,351 --> 02:35:13,351
but they're a German troops.
To quote his infantry when it attacked 

2666
02:35:13,351 --> 02:35:15,430
on June fifth,
found the Austrians and confusion.

2667
02:35:15,700 --> 02:35:19,180
It's advanced,
stunned them with its scope extending as

2668
02:35:19,181 --> 02:35:23,090
it did along the line of more than 250 
miles still loves.

2669
02:35:23,091 --> 02:35:25,240
The idea was that by attacking 
everywhere,

2670
02:35:25,360 --> 02:35:29,200
he was sure to find holes somewhere and 
he had moved his reserves,

2671
02:35:29,260 --> 02:35:34,260
scant,
though they were close enough to the 

2672
02:35:34,260 --> 02:35:35,080
front so that they could exploit 
opportunities as soon as any appeared,

2673
02:35:35,420 --> 02:35:40,420
and he continues quote,
and the result was from the first hour a

2674
02:35:41,651 --> 02:35:46,651
success of almost incredible magnitude.
The Austro-hungarian Fourth Army 

2675
02:35:46,651 --> 02:35:50,110
disintegrated when hit 71,000
of its men.

2676
02:35:50,230 --> 02:35:53,440
More than half the army were killed,
wounded or captured.

2677
02:35:53,680 --> 02:35:58,060
The seventh was wrecked even more 
completely losing 133,000

2678
02:35:58,061 --> 02:36:00,370
men.
It was the same almost everywhere.

2679
02:36:00,520 --> 02:36:02,080
After three days,
bruce,

2680
02:36:02,090 --> 02:36:05,050
he found himself in possession of 
300,000

2681
02:36:05,051 --> 02:36:08,920
prisoners before the end of the week.
More than half of the Austrian defenders

2682
02:36:08,921 --> 02:36:13,921
had become casualties and quote Brasil 
have shattered the Austrians,

2683
02:36:16,810 --> 02:36:19,270
and then he ran into the typical 
problem.

2684
02:36:19,600 --> 02:36:24,600
Any Russian commander runs into the 
inability of the Russian army in 

2685
02:36:24,600 --> 02:36:29,251
government to get him enough stuff fast 
enough for him to not slow down and have

2686
02:36:29,411 --> 02:36:30,730
his offensive Peter out.

2687
02:36:31,540 --> 02:36:36,540
But this maneuver had a domino effect on
the war because at Verdun Falcon Hein 

2688
02:36:39,690 --> 02:36:44,690
now had a crisis on his hands in the 
east where he was going to have to pull 

2689
02:36:44,690 --> 02:36:47,950
troops out of Verdun to go save the 
Austro-hungarian army,

2690
02:36:47,951 --> 02:36:52,951
which was disintegrating.
And let's understand the 

2691
02:36:52,951 --> 02:36:53,830
Austro-hungarian forces we told you 
about those,

2692
02:36:54,220 --> 02:36:59,220
those troops who were a microcosm of the
empire as a whole who didn't want to be 

2693
02:36:59,220 --> 02:37:04,021
there.
You had whole units and I mean 

2694
02:37:04,021 --> 02:37:07,140
battalions,
regiments of slobs throw down their 

2695
02:37:07,140 --> 02:37:11,311
weapons and surrender to the Russians,
who by the way are Slavs to let us not 

2696
02:37:11,311 --> 02:37:14,971
forget that this war began when a slavic
national assassinated austro-hungarian 

2697
02:37:16,521 --> 02:37:17,720
heir to the throne,
right?

2698
02:37:17,900 --> 02:37:21,740
And now we're asking slavs to fight for 
that empire.

2699
02:37:22,010 --> 02:37:24,560
Many of them threw down their weapons.
They didn't want to die,

2700
02:37:24,561 --> 02:37:26,600
and they certainly do more die fighting 
for that empire,

2701
02:37:26,750 --> 02:37:31,750
and they certainly didn't want to die 
fighting for that empire against their 

2702
02:37:31,750 --> 02:37:31,910
Slavic brethren.

2703
02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:37,240
In fact,
some of these units are said to have 

2704
02:37:37,240 --> 02:37:37,240
jumped into the trenches with the 
Russians,

2705
02:37:37,240 --> 02:37:39,860
turned around and trained their guns 
back on the side.

2706
02:37:39,861 --> 02:37:44,861
They had just defected from the Germans,
will manage to contain with their 

2707
02:37:44,901 --> 02:37:46,820
wonderful army,
the Russian threat,

2708
02:37:47,450 --> 02:37:50,960
and they will halt mercy,
loves advance,

2709
02:37:50,961 --> 02:37:55,961
and even deal a defeat to the Russians,
but already the single minded focus of 

2710
02:37:57,620 --> 02:37:59,750
falcon heights on Verdun has been 
shattered.

2711
02:38:00,110 --> 02:38:05,110
The Russians who put in such a wonderful
effort in the brewster love offensive 

2712
02:38:05,110 --> 02:38:08,771
and did such terrible damage to the 
Austrians suffered immensely though 

2713
02:38:08,771 --> 02:38:13,031
while doing so well over a million 
casualties suffered in the brewery love 

2714
02:38:13,031 --> 02:38:17,860
offensive,
which once again takes the Russians and 

2715
02:38:17,860 --> 02:38:20,630
begins to ratchet up the level of 
dissatisfaction,

2716
02:38:20,900 --> 02:38:23,780
getting them closer and closer to the 
breaking point.

2717
02:38:23,781 --> 02:38:26,780
You can almost feel it in the air.
In 1916,

2718
02:38:27,020 --> 02:38:32,020
a couple of these major powers are 
within one good punch of going down in 

2719
02:38:33,051 --> 02:38:37,010
the spring of 1916.
French military leader,

2720
02:38:37,011 --> 02:38:42,011
Joseph you offer,
tells his British counterpart that 

2721
02:38:42,011 --> 02:38:42,290
France is one of those nations

2722
02:38:43,860 --> 02:38:46,350
within a good shot of going down.
Remember,

2723
02:38:46,750 --> 02:38:49,380
you know by this time they've had a 
month or two at Verdun.

2724
02:38:49,381 --> 02:38:54,381
The French have suffered like 200,000
casualties and at least this early two 

2725
02:38:55,201 --> 02:38:57,840
months into 10,
but nobody knows it yet.

2726
02:38:57,841 --> 02:38:59,760
At the battle of redundant looks like 
the German leader,

2727
02:38:59,761 --> 02:39:03,090
Falcon Heinz plan to bleed.
The French army white is working.

2728
02:39:03,540 --> 02:39:06,000
That's why you can't take your eyes off 
the first world war.

2729
02:39:06,001 --> 02:39:11,001
They're like two prize fighters and just
when you think one guy's taken over the 

2730
02:39:11,001 --> 02:39:11,001
fight,
the other guidelines,

2731
02:39:11,001 --> 02:39:13,320
a good shot and somebodies knees buckle,
and in the spring of Nineteen 16,

2732
02:39:13,321 --> 02:39:17,100
Jennifer tells Sir Douglas Haig,
the current commander of British forces,

2733
02:39:18,170 --> 02:39:23,170
it's France whose knees had been buckled
and he urges Hague to start that summer 

2734
02:39:23,521 --> 02:39:27,180
offensive that he's been planning for a 
long time on the river somme early.

2735
02:39:27,650 --> 02:39:29,190
He says,
if you don't start it early,

2736
02:39:29,550 --> 02:39:34,240
the French army will cease to exist.
He gets so worked up.

2737
02:39:34,241 --> 02:39:39,241
We're told that he can only be consoled 
and calmed down with lots of 1840 

2738
02:39:40,421 --> 02:39:41,440
brandy,
you know,

2739
02:39:41,441 --> 02:39:46,441
from the year 18,
40 chauffeur needed good brandy to calm 

2740
02:39:46,441 --> 02:39:46,441
down.

2741
02:39:47,200 --> 02:39:52,200
Nonetheless,
Haig speeds up the big offensive plan 

2742
02:39:52,781 --> 02:39:57,781
for the summer of 1916.
Discussed with all the other allies in 

2743
02:39:57,781 --> 02:40:01,441
late 1915,
this is a longterm plan and the going 

2744
02:40:01,441 --> 02:40:04,710
gonna launch it early.
This longterm plan results in the most 

2745
02:40:04,710 --> 02:40:09,550
controversial piece from the British 
standpoint of this whole war,

2746
02:40:09,551 --> 02:40:13,360
maybe of British military history in its
entirety.

2747
02:40:14,130 --> 02:40:15,900
First of all,
Douglas Haig,

2748
02:40:15,901 --> 02:40:20,901
you have to understand that the field 
marshal the Java was talking to is the 

2749
02:40:20,901 --> 02:40:24,441
new guy.
Just like most of the great powers in 

2750
02:40:24,441 --> 02:40:25,980
the first world war.
By 1916,

2751
02:40:25,981 --> 02:40:28,590
they fired the person that got them into
this mess,

2752
02:40:28,591 --> 02:40:30,420
right?
The wars terrible.

2753
02:40:30,750 --> 02:40:34,200
Everybody's predictions were wrong.
Nobody's fighting it well,

2754
02:40:34,201 --> 02:40:39,201
so one by one,
all of these countries are sac in the 

2755
02:40:39,201 --> 02:40:39,201
people that got them into this mess,
the Russians dropped.

2756
02:40:39,201 --> 02:40:43,311
There's the Germans have falcon heights 
because they got rid of unmold killed 

2757
02:40:43,311 --> 02:40:43,311
while the war was,
you know,

2758
02:40:43,311 --> 02:40:47,600
in its early phases,
the French still have shopped for a 

2759
02:40:47,600 --> 02:40:47,600
crazily enough.

2760
02:40:47,850 --> 02:40:48,900
But um,
you know,

2761
02:40:48,901 --> 02:40:53,730
that reputation of the miracle of the 
and in 1914 will only carry you so far.

2762
02:40:53,731 --> 02:40:58,731
He doesn't have long to go either and 
the British in late 1950 and Sir John 

2763
02:40:58,890 --> 02:41:00,030
French,
like we told you in the last episode,

2764
02:41:00,240 --> 02:41:02,820
the guy who gets his gig is a guy named 
Douglas Haig.

2765
02:41:03,390 --> 02:41:08,390
It'll be a field marshal.
He's another one of these cavalry 

2766
02:41:08,390 --> 02:41:08,390
commanders.
So it was weird.

2767
02:41:08,390 --> 02:41:13,281
We have a war where cavalry becomes 
something that you keep off to the side 

2768
02:41:13,281 --> 02:41:15,270
and don't use because it just gets 
killed and the horses are more important

2769
02:41:15,271 --> 02:41:20,271
to move stuff because crazily enough,
and we haven't talked enough about this 

2770
02:41:20,271 --> 02:41:22,260
and we'll get to it.
Horses are everywhere.

2771
02:41:22,261 --> 02:41:26,130
There's millions of them in this war and
their casualties too,

2772
02:41:26,131 --> 02:41:29,280
by the way,
but all these cavalry commanders,

2773
02:41:29,281 --> 02:41:30,180
French,
hey golf,

2774
02:41:30,190 --> 02:41:35,190
these guys have these visions that we're
going to break the German lines 

2775
02:41:35,190 --> 02:41:38,831
somewhere and then the cavalry is going 
to go rushing in the hole we create and 

2776
02:41:38,831 --> 02:41:38,831
go into the back.

2777
02:41:38,831 --> 02:41:40,130
And it's,
it's the pre,

2778
02:41:40,920 --> 02:41:42,480
you know,
Wehrmacht Armor,

2779
02:41:42,481 --> 02:41:47,481
Blitzkrieg version of that.
That's a strategy that's been used 

2780
02:41:47,481 --> 02:41:47,481
throughout history,
right?

2781
02:41:47,790 --> 02:41:51,310
Um,
goes back to pre Alexander time,

2782
02:41:51,311 --> 02:41:53,850
smashed the cavalry into the hole and 
roll up the lines.

2783
02:41:53,940 --> 02:41:55,950
It's blitzkrieg before you have motor 
vehicles,

2784
02:41:55,951 --> 02:41:59,520
and that's what these cavalry commanders
are still dreaming of two years into the

2785
02:41:59,521 --> 02:42:02,360
war that puts the final nail into the 
coffin,

2786
02:42:02,361 --> 02:42:06,570
into the idea that this cavalry has any 
offensive role to play.

2787
02:42:07,620 --> 02:42:12,620
Although you have to remember,
it still is the fastest moving thing on 

2788
02:42:12,620 --> 02:42:12,620
the battlefield.
In large numbers,

2789
02:42:12,620 --> 02:42:14,750
you're starting to get motor vehicles,
but you know,

2790
02:42:14,820 --> 02:42:17,730
tough for the motor vehicles to handle 
terrain and they're very unreliable.

2791
02:42:17,731 --> 02:42:20,160
Horses are still the fastest mobility 
you have,

2792
02:42:20,161 --> 02:42:22,890
so they're valuable just for that point 
alone.

2793
02:42:22,891 --> 02:42:25,860
They're very vulnerable though.
And the stories of,

2794
02:42:26,010 --> 02:42:31,010
of,
of dead horses in the suffering of 

2795
02:42:31,010 --> 02:42:32,820
animals in the story is under discussed.

2796
02:42:33,870 --> 02:42:35,250
Nonetheless.
Douglas Haig,

2797
02:42:35,251 --> 02:42:37,870
the new British cavalry commander,
um,

2798
02:42:38,100 --> 02:42:43,100
has at his disposal some of the largest 
really the largest armies that Britain 

2799
02:42:43,100 --> 02:42:47,661
has ever had ready to go to war because 
those volunteers that started joining 

2800
02:42:48,001 --> 02:42:53,001
when Lord Horacio Kitchener,
you'll remember the British military 

2801
02:42:53,001 --> 02:42:53,280
leader from the beginning of the war.
The guy who,

2802
02:42:53,281 --> 02:42:55,470
when you see his picture,
screams,

2803
02:42:55,471 --> 02:42:57,990
19th century man on it.
I mean,

2804
02:42:58,190 --> 02:43:03,190
you know,
with the giant mustache from another 

2805
02:43:03,190 --> 02:43:04,941
area,
you can almost see him in a British red 

2806
02:43:04,941 --> 02:43:06,831
coat and he's the big face on the 
recruiting poster telling Britain's 

2807
02:43:06,831 --> 02:43:10,700
patriotic Britain's to sign up for king 
and country and a shilling and kitchen 

2808
02:43:10,700 --> 02:43:14,720
is another one of these prewar early war
generals and military leaders who's been

2809
02:43:14,831 --> 02:43:16,410
tarred by,
you know,

2810
02:43:16,750 --> 02:43:18,250
their conduct in the war.
They don't,

2811
02:43:18,280 --> 02:43:23,280
they don't end up looking so genius like
when the first world war gets done with 

2812
02:43:23,280 --> 02:43:23,280
you,
right.

2813
02:43:23,280 --> 02:43:25,330
So as kitchener,
his reputation is starting to wane.

2814
02:43:25,331 --> 02:43:30,331
He still got one real feather in his cap
and that's that those armies that he 

2815
02:43:30,331 --> 02:43:35,221
helped recruit in 1914 in 1915 and that 
he is protected like a proud parent,

2816
02:43:35,810 --> 02:43:37,030
you know,
don't send them to Gullapalli.

2817
02:43:37,031 --> 02:43:38,380
Don't send him to the western front 
early.

2818
02:43:38,381 --> 02:43:40,870
Don't throw them in the meat grinder 
like everything else,

2819
02:43:40,871 --> 02:43:44,290
save them and really make use of their 
patriotic contribution.

2820
02:43:44,291 --> 02:43:49,291
These people want to win the war,
let's put them in a position where they 

2821
02:43:49,291 --> 02:43:51,871
can do that.
He's done an admirable job of that in 

2822
02:43:51,871 --> 02:43:54,571
about three weeks before those soldiers 
known sometimes as the kitchen or armies

2823
02:43:54,761 --> 02:43:59,761
or the kitchen or divisions after him 
are going to lose the guy that was 

2824
02:43:59,761 --> 02:44:03,370
probably most responsible for seeing 
that they weren't used up already in the

2825
02:44:03,371 --> 02:44:08,371
first place.
Kitchener dies about three weeks before 

2826
02:44:08,371 --> 02:44:08,371
his legions are thrown into the frame.

2827
02:44:09,040 --> 02:44:14,040
It's a crazy story.
I'm told that it is the same as any one 

2828
02:44:14,351 --> 02:44:19,351
of those big modern deaths,
so so the same as a princess or lady 

2829
02:44:19,351 --> 02:44:22,780
Diana dying or Winston Churchill dying 
or JFK dying in the United States.

2830
02:44:22,781 --> 02:44:24,760
You say to yourself,
do you remember when that happened?

2831
02:44:24,761 --> 02:44:27,340
And Britain's of the period,
remember where they were when they heard

2832
02:44:27,670 --> 02:44:32,670
that Lord Horacio Kitchen.
They're British military leader and 

2833
02:44:32,670 --> 02:44:34,090
almost Demi God,
at least at the beginning of the war,

2834
02:44:34,360 --> 02:44:39,360
has gone down at sea while on a war ship
on the way to Russia on some military 

2835
02:44:40,271 --> 02:44:45,271
mission and the boat goes down at night 
in a force nine gail after hitting a 

2836
02:44:48,161 --> 02:44:51,730
mine,
and there are survivors who say,

2837
02:44:51,731 --> 02:44:56,731
take this with a grain of salt that they
saw kitchener on the deck as the ship 

2838
02:44:56,731 --> 02:45:00,991
went down in passively sort of accepting
his fate and just standing on the deck 

2839
02:45:00,991 --> 02:45:00,991
as the ship goes,
you know,

2840
02:45:00,991 --> 02:45:05,940
beneath the waves that really works with
that whole 19th century military leader 

2841
02:45:05,940 --> 02:45:06,430
reputation,
doesn't it?

2842
02:45:06,970 --> 02:45:09,280
Nonetheless,
there have been conspiracy theories ever

2843
02:45:09,281 --> 02:45:11,650
since about this.
Believe it or not,

2844
02:45:11,950 --> 02:45:16,950
it's one of the Great Conspiracy Know 
Fountain heads to come out of the first 

2845
02:45:16,950 --> 02:45:16,990
world war.
Nonetheless,

2846
02:45:16,991 --> 02:45:19,060
it meant the three weeks later when 
kitchener's,

2847
02:45:19,190 --> 02:45:24,190
you know,
parentally preserved armies are finally 

2848
02:45:24,190 --> 02:45:25,660
thrown into the fray.
He's not there to have any say in it.

2849
02:45:26,740 --> 02:45:31,740
The Guy who is is Douglas Haig,
the new guy now known to some in history

2850
02:45:32,861 --> 02:45:37,861
as the butcher.
So that should give you an idea of what 

2851
02:45:37,861 --> 02:45:40,000
we're about to get into here on a wide 
variety of fronts.

2852
02:45:41,140 --> 02:45:46,140
This battle is won that Sir Douglas Haig
has been preparing for since the year 

2853
02:45:46,541 --> 02:45:51,541
before when the French told him that 
they were in danger of disintegrating.

2854
02:45:51,940 --> 02:45:56,940
He's moving up something he's been 
working on for awhile now and everyone 

2855
02:45:56,940 --> 02:46:00,961
knows it.
The big 1916 offensive is no secret.

2856
02:46:01,421 --> 02:46:06,421
Hekaton newspapers basically means that 
when you find out all the ways that 

2857
02:46:06,421 --> 02:46:10,981
everybody knew this was coming,
it makes you wonder again how 

2858
02:46:10,981 --> 02:46:14,891
intelligent it is to be launching 
something that everybody knows is 

2859
02:46:14,891 --> 02:46:14,891
coming,
but it couldn't really be helped.

2860
02:46:14,891 --> 02:46:19,400
If you're going to fight at this spot on
the Somme River with the British and the

2861
02:46:19,401 --> 02:46:24,401
French forces meet on the western front 
where the where the British line ends 

2862
02:46:24,401 --> 02:46:28,721
and the French line begins,
that's where they're going to hold this 

2863
02:46:28,721 --> 02:46:31,541
joint offensive.
Maybe for the sole reason that that's 

2864
02:46:31,541 --> 02:46:34,871
where both armies are.
That would be a really silly reason to 

2865
02:46:34,871 --> 02:46:37,910
attack the greatest defenses on the 
western front,

2866
02:46:37,911 --> 02:46:40,910
which are the greatest defenses ever in 
the world right now.

2867
02:46:40,911 --> 02:46:42,830
These are defenses that make the old 
Roman,

2868
02:46:43,280 --> 02:46:44,060
um,
you know,

2869
02:46:44,061 --> 02:46:48,620
lines that you would cross Europe with 
these giant wall miner.

2870
02:46:49,300 --> 02:46:54,300
It has never been defensive like this.
The Germans are at the point now where 

2871
02:46:54,300 --> 02:46:57,140
they're building creature comforts into 
their fortified line.

2872
02:46:57,141 --> 02:46:59,120
I mean,
they're putting wallpaper on and they've

2873
02:46:59,121 --> 02:47:02,180
got electric lights and ventilation and 
then no running water.

2874
02:47:02,181 --> 02:47:07,181
I mean it's crazy though.
The trenches or in some cases all lined 

2875
02:47:07,181 --> 02:47:10,421
with wood boards done with about as much
thorough on this as the Germans are 

2876
02:47:10,421 --> 02:47:10,421
known for.

2877
02:47:10,421 --> 02:47:13,130
These are huge modern fortifications in 
some sense.

2878
02:47:13,131 --> 02:47:18,131
And these Germans on the other side of 
this line where the French and the 

2879
02:47:18,131 --> 02:47:21,071
British are thinking about launching 
this big 1916 offensive have bunkers 

2880
02:47:21,071 --> 02:47:24,851
that are 30 and 40 feet underground,
cut into the chalk of these hills that 

2881
02:47:26,451 --> 02:47:31,451
the Germans occupied.
They are looking down for months as the 

2882
02:47:31,581 --> 02:47:36,581
British load up.
All the stuff you now need for a modern 

2883
02:47:36,581 --> 02:47:36,581
offensive.
All that stuff.

2884
02:47:36,581 --> 02:47:37,520
We said that the German's needed at 
Verdun,

2885
02:47:37,910 --> 02:47:39,380
the British need at the Somme,
right?

2886
02:47:39,381 --> 02:47:40,460
The French too,
by the way.

2887
02:47:41,480 --> 02:47:44,410
They've laid five railroad lines,
you know,

2888
02:47:44,420 --> 02:47:48,560
new tracks to the battlefield because 
that's how often and how many trains are

2889
02:47:48,561 --> 02:47:52,310
going to be running,
just unloading stuff for months,

2890
02:47:53,120 --> 02:47:54,710
$3,
million shells,

2891
02:47:54,980 --> 02:47:59,980
millions of tons of food.
I mean crazy in engineering corps that 

2892
02:47:59,980 --> 02:48:00,890
are building things,
you know,

2893
02:48:00,891 --> 02:48:05,891
full on permanent structures.
While the Germans watched the whole 

2894
02:48:05,891 --> 02:48:06,560
thing and plan for it and trained for 
it,

2895
02:48:06,830 --> 02:48:08,090
they're having drills every day.

2896
02:48:08,610 --> 02:48:13,610
You know,
how quickly can we get up from our 

2897
02:48:13,610 --> 02:48:15,401
underground bunker and get up to the 
trench and man the machine guns before 

2898
02:48:15,401 --> 02:48:15,401
the British soldiers are on top of us,
right?

2899
02:48:15,401 --> 02:48:20,170
Everybody knows this is coming and 
everybody knows how it's going to be 

2900
02:48:20,170 --> 02:48:21,860
fought.
The British take these armies with many,

2901
02:48:21,861 --> 02:48:24,020
many,
many green troops that had never been in

2902
02:48:24,021 --> 02:48:27,050
a battle,
puts them in the trenches opposite these

2903
02:48:27,051 --> 02:48:29,330
German lines.
Again,

2904
02:48:29,390 --> 02:48:34,390
a position so strong that Winston 
Churchill says it was undoubtedly the 

2905
02:48:35,781 --> 02:48:40,781
strongest and most perfectly defended 
position in the world and the quote,

2906
02:48:42,680 --> 02:48:47,270
and start bombarding it with artillery 
starts June 20,

2907
02:48:47,271 --> 02:48:47,900
fourth,
19,

2908
02:48:47,901 --> 02:48:48,740
16,
early.

2909
02:48:48,741 --> 02:48:51,920
By the way,
a lot of artillery.

2910
02:48:52,850 --> 02:48:57,850
As a matter of fact,
the song becomes one of about four or 

2911
02:48:57,850 --> 02:49:00,641
five first world war battles that 
compete for like the Guinness Book of 

2912
02:49:01,160 --> 02:49:03,050
World Records for the biggest,
largest,

2913
02:49:03,051 --> 02:49:04,370
worst,
more intense,

2914
02:49:04,371 --> 02:49:05,360
most numerous,
you know,

2915
02:49:05,450 --> 02:49:08,190
pick your category,
artillery bombardment of the war

2916
02:49:09,860 --> 02:49:10,540
there.
You know,

2917
02:49:10,570 --> 02:49:15,570
as a history geek,
I would be arguing it with my other 

2918
02:49:15,570 --> 02:49:15,570
history geek friends.
And,

2919
02:49:15,570 --> 02:49:15,570
and it's always about criteria,
right?

2920
02:49:15,570 --> 02:49:20,401
Are we talking about the largest number 
of shells fall throughout an entire 

2921
02:49:20,401 --> 02:49:20,401
battle,
you know,

2922
02:49:20,401 --> 02:49:24,241
40 to 60 million of verdun maybe.
Or are we talking about the most number 

2923
02:49:24,241 --> 02:49:28,081
of shells used in the initial part of 
the battle or the most number of shells 

2924
02:49:28,081 --> 02:49:29,740
dropped in the shortest period of time 
or the smallest space.

2925
02:49:29,741 --> 02:49:34,741
I mean,
there's literally a measurement of how 

2926
02:49:34,741 --> 02:49:36,460
many tons of shells fell on each square 
meter of these battlefields.

2927
02:49:36,461 --> 02:49:41,461
And by the way,
if you use that as your criterion for 

2928
02:49:41,461 --> 02:49:43,690
Dunn is the worst artillery bombardment,
um,

2929
02:49:43,840 --> 02:49:45,820
in history.
Nonetheless,

2930
02:49:45,821 --> 02:49:50,821
the fact that the psalm is in this 
argument shows you the level of 

2931
02:49:50,821 --> 02:49:52,900
artillery we're talking about here.
And when it opens up on the 24th,

2932
02:49:53,950 --> 02:49:56,200
it's,
it's incredible and it's volume,

2933
02:49:56,201 --> 02:49:57,760
but the Germans laugh a little.

2934
02:49:58,840 --> 02:50:03,840
I mean it's a huge bombardment,
but the Germans are mostly underground 

2935
02:50:03,840 --> 02:50:05,800
and under cover and most of the 
bombardment is,

2936
02:50:05,801 --> 02:50:07,960
once again,
shrapnel shells,

2937
02:50:08,050 --> 02:50:11,740
sounds like a little teeny point,
doesn't it for a battle to turn on,

2938
02:50:12,160 --> 02:50:14,980
but had those shells been high explosive
instead,

2939
02:50:14,981 --> 02:50:18,880
or maybe even gas,
this battle may go another direction and

2940
02:50:18,881 --> 02:50:22,510
every historian brings up that the 
shrapnel was pretty much pointless.

2941
02:50:23,880 --> 02:50:28,880
It's remember it's like a giant hand 
grenade or shotgun shell exploding in 

2942
02:50:28,880 --> 02:50:28,900
the air and all these little pellets hit
the ground.

2943
02:50:28,901 --> 02:50:30,910
It's devastating to infantry out in the 
open,

2944
02:50:30,911 --> 02:50:32,350
but the Germans aren't in the open,
right?

2945
02:50:33,580 --> 02:50:38,580
In addition,
the artillery is meant to do more than 

2946
02:50:38,580 --> 02:50:41,251
just killed Germans.
The artillery has to clear the 

2947
02:50:41,251 --> 02:50:44,881
battlefield of all this stuff that's 
there as defenses so that the troops on 

2948
02:50:44,881 --> 02:50:47,080
the British side can actually get to the
German trenches.

2949
02:50:47,470 --> 02:50:50,680
It's full of barbed wire.
No Man's land,

2950
02:50:50,950 --> 02:50:54,370
another trench than another no man's 
land than another trench.

2951
02:50:54,550 --> 02:50:59,550
The trenches are all going uphill and 
these no man's land areas besides being 

2952
02:50:59,550 --> 02:51:01,930
filled with concrete bunkers and 
everything we've told you about before,

2953
02:51:01,931 --> 02:51:06,070
the killing zones,
they have yards of barbed wires thick as

2954
02:51:06,071 --> 02:51:06,640
your finger.

2955
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:11,690
It's a physical impediment.
It has to be overcome by the generals.

2956
02:51:11,840 --> 02:51:16,840
The generals have figured out in their 
minds that an artillery barrage of this 

2957
02:51:16,840 --> 02:51:18,410
caliber,
the amounts we're talking about here,

2958
02:51:18,560 --> 02:51:21,140
the barb wire will just explode into 
pieces.

2959
02:51:21,170 --> 02:51:23,990
They will not be an impediment when the 
artillery barrages over,

2960
02:51:24,210 --> 02:51:26,600
except the shrapnel shells,
don't really affect it.

2961
02:51:28,440 --> 02:51:33,440
Now,
there was a benefit to the artillery 

2962
02:51:33,440 --> 02:51:33,480
barrage,
though as we've quoted before,

2963
02:51:33,481 --> 02:51:36,180
Napoleon has this great line that comes 
in handy all the time.

2964
02:51:36,181 --> 02:51:41,181
That quantity has a quality all its own 
and the sheer intensity of this barrage 

2965
02:51:41,731 --> 02:51:46,731
began to have an effect on the Germans,
even though they were physically 

2966
02:51:46,731 --> 02:51:48,930
protected from being injured by it.
It began to play on them.

2967
02:51:48,931 --> 02:51:53,931
First of all,
they know they've got something really 

2968
02:51:53,931 --> 02:51:55,140
nasty awaiting them in their future.
You have to try to put yourself in their

2969
02:51:55,141 --> 02:51:56,160
shoes.
Okay?

2970
02:51:56,730 --> 02:52:01,730
They know that when this artillery 
barrages over the British are going to 

2971
02:52:01,730 --> 02:52:05,661
be on them.
They've been training for this moment 

2972
02:52:05,661 --> 02:52:05,661
for months,
right?

2973
02:52:05,661 --> 02:52:05,980
Run up the stairs.
How quickly can you get in front of the

2974
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:10,980
machine,
gun in time to stop the British from 

2975
02:52:10,980 --> 02:52:11,410
taking over your trench so they're going
to either be killed,

2976
02:52:11,610 --> 02:52:16,610
bee grievously wounded,
see a friend killed or wounded or have 

2977
02:52:16,610 --> 02:52:17,920
to kill some of them.
They're going to have a really nasty day

2978
02:52:17,921 --> 02:52:20,680
and they're very near future.
In the meantime,

2979
02:52:20,830 --> 02:52:25,830
you're going to have one of the greatest
artillery barrages and history going on 

2980
02:52:25,830 --> 02:52:29,520
around you or younger who will be at 
this battlefield in about a month and 

2981
02:52:29,520 --> 02:52:32,080
see a an artillery barrage that is not 
as bad as this one.

2982
02:52:32,710 --> 02:52:35,320
He will compare it to the roar of the 
ocean.

2983
02:52:36,310 --> 02:52:40,180
He will say that there are no individual
sounds and he says he will.

2984
02:52:40,270 --> 02:52:42,820
It will achieve at times and last for 
hours.

2985
02:52:42,850 --> 02:52:47,350
A demented intensity that he says when 
it eventually calms down,

2986
02:52:47,740 --> 02:52:51,550
calms down to mere drum fire,
which is,

2987
02:52:51,551 --> 02:52:53,620
you know the sound of a drum roll.

2988
02:52:53,620 --> 02:52:55,270
That's how fast the artillery shells are
dropping,

2989
02:52:55,271 --> 02:52:56,800
and he says,
even when it's the drum roll,

2990
02:52:56,801 --> 02:52:59,530
you can't pick out any individual 
explosions.

2991
02:52:59,531 --> 02:53:04,531
It's just one big loud sound,
but the demented theory that it reaches 

2992
02:53:04,531 --> 02:53:07,981
sometimes blows that away literally.
And that's the kind of intensity these 

2993
02:53:08,321 --> 02:53:13,321
soldiers are living with,
knowing that they've got this horrible 

2994
02:53:13,321 --> 02:53:15,811
moment in their future and it goes on 
for days and we're told that the German 

2995
02:53:15,811 --> 02:53:20,611
soldiers who were kind of laughing at 
the fact that the British were using 

2996
02:53:20,611 --> 02:53:22,780
like 70 percent shrapnel shells on them 
aren't laughing anymore.

2997
02:53:23,860 --> 02:53:25,750
They're getting tired and stressed and 
you know,

2998
02:53:25,810 --> 02:53:30,040
put yourself in the position of just not
sleeping for five days and now,

2999
02:53:30,290 --> 02:53:32,620
you know,
add all the other things on top of that.

3000
02:53:33,280 --> 02:53:35,320
So there is an effect that this 
artillery is having.

3001
02:53:35,321 --> 02:53:37,720
And the Germans all right about it.
Um,

3002
02:53:37,750 --> 02:53:40,570
the British commander,
this is part of the controversy.

3003
02:53:40,960 --> 02:53:45,960
We're told that there were lots of 
people saying that this artillery 

3004
02:53:45,960 --> 02:53:46,360
barrage was going to make this a cake 
walk.

3005
02:53:46,361 --> 02:53:48,010
And you've heard that before,
right?

3006
02:53:48,670 --> 02:53:52,150
Don't all these battles between to sound
like isn't there a repetitiveness to the

3007
02:53:52,151 --> 02:53:54,100
story?
If there is,

3008
02:53:54,430 --> 02:53:59,430
you're getting the right feeling out of 
it because that's how you know it's 

3009
02:53:59,430 --> 02:54:01,480
always been played and it seems like the
people at the time felt too.

3010
02:54:01,481 --> 02:54:02,830
Oh No,
not again,

3011
02:54:02,950 --> 02:54:07,950
haven't we seen this movie before?
The general seem to always just want 

3012
02:54:07,950 --> 02:54:08,410
more stuff.
Give us more artillery,

3013
02:54:08,411 --> 02:54:10,180
give us more men,
give us deeper defensive,

3014
02:54:10,300 --> 02:54:11,710
you know,
we'll fix this situation.

3015
02:54:11,920 --> 02:54:14,830
So here's the biggest artillery barrage.
The British I've ever launched.

3016
02:54:15,370 --> 02:54:17,320
They shoot off 2 million shells in no 
time.

3017
02:54:18,220 --> 02:54:20,950
And just for comparison purposes,
100 years before this time,

3018
02:54:20,951 --> 02:54:25,951
at the battle of waterloo,
Napoleon is estimated to have had about 

3019
02:54:25,951 --> 02:54:26,440
20,000
Canon balls with the French army.

3020
02:54:27,010 --> 02:54:29,740
So you know,
2 million shells in a week or two versus

3021
02:54:29,741 --> 02:54:30,810
20,000.
It's,

3022
02:54:31,210 --> 02:54:36,210
it's crazy.
The level of artillery we're going to 

3023
02:54:36,210 --> 02:54:38,161
see here and it,
it lowers the commander's into this 

3024
02:54:38,161 --> 02:54:39,910
sense that it's going to accomplish so 
much more than it does.

3025
02:54:40,930 --> 02:54:45,930
It's the soldiers on the ground though 
that produced the historical reminders 

3026
02:54:46,330 --> 02:54:50,650
that most of them were too realistic and
to savvy and too cynical to buy into any

3027
02:54:50,651 --> 02:54:55,651
of that.
Rosie thinking that generals could 

3028
02:54:55,651 --> 02:54:55,651
afford to be rosy.
The guys on the ground going in,

3029
02:54:55,651 --> 02:55:00,060
for example,
the first wave of this assault that the 

3030
02:55:00,060 --> 02:55:00,850
Germans had been waiting for you for 
months.

3031
02:55:01,090 --> 02:55:06,090
They know better and you can tell 
because there are absolutely 

3032
02:55:06,090 --> 02:55:09,560
heartbreaking.
Last letters home that have made it into

3033
02:55:09,561 --> 02:55:10,730
the history books.
Peter Hearts,

3034
02:55:10,731 --> 02:55:12,990
wonderful book on the Great War,
um,

3035
02:55:13,100 --> 02:55:18,100
has one of these letters from a captain 
Charles May who fights in the 22nd 

3036
02:55:18,100 --> 02:55:22,961
Manchester Regiment and he's writing to 
his wife right before he goes over the 

3037
02:55:22,961 --> 02:55:23,930
top in this battle.

3038
02:55:24,760 --> 02:55:25,340
And,
and,

3039
02:55:25,350 --> 02:55:27,470
and again,
imagine,

3040
02:55:27,800 --> 02:55:32,800
imagine how it affects you to be in the 
position of writing a letter like this.

3041
02:55:33,351 --> 02:55:36,050
I always think that that's,
that's a permanent scar on your soul.

3042
02:55:36,051 --> 02:55:39,530
Even if you get the proverbial reprieve 
from the governor,

3043
02:55:39,531 --> 02:55:44,531
right from Captain Charles may have the 
22nd Manchester Regiment who's about to 

3044
02:55:44,901 --> 02:55:47,240
go over the top on the first day of the 
somme.

3045
02:55:47,540 --> 02:55:48,860
And writes his wife,
quote,

3046
02:55:50,030 --> 02:55:52,760
I must not allow myself to dwell on the 
personal.

3047
02:55:52,930 --> 02:55:55,340
There is no room for it.
Here also,

3048
02:55:55,520 --> 02:55:58,820
it is demoralizing,
but I do not want to die.

3049
02:55:59,210 --> 02:56:02,180
Not that I mind for myself.
If it'd be that I am to go,

3050
02:56:02,181 --> 02:56:05,120
I'm ready,
but the thought that I may never see you

3051
02:56:05,330 --> 02:56:08,900
or are darling baby again,
it turns my bowels to water.

3052
02:56:09,230 --> 02:56:12,050
I cannot think of it with even the 
semblance of equanimity.

3053
02:56:12,440 --> 02:56:15,200
My one constellation is the happiness 
that's been ours.

3054
02:56:15,530 --> 02:56:20,530
Also,
my conscience is clear that I've always 

3055
02:56:20,530 --> 02:56:22,991
tried to make life a joy to you.
I know at least that if I go you will 

3056
02:56:22,991 --> 02:56:26,480
not want that is something,
but it is the thought that we may be cut

3057
02:56:26,481 --> 02:56:31,481
off from one another which is so 
terrible and that our baby may grow up 

3058
02:56:31,481 --> 02:56:34,070
without my knowing her and without her 
knowing me.

3059
02:56:34,370 --> 02:56:38,720
It's difficult to face and I know your 
life without me would be a double blank,

3060
02:56:38,950 --> 02:56:43,950
yet you must never let it become holy.
So for to you will be left the greatest 

3061
02:56:43,950 --> 02:56:46,220
charge and all the world,
the upbringing of our baby.

3062
02:56:46,490 --> 02:56:49,040
God blessed that child.
She's the hope of life to me,

3063
02:56:49,250 --> 02:56:54,250
my darling are of law.
It may be that you will only have to 

3064
02:56:54,250 --> 02:56:55,670
read these lines as ones of passing 
interest.

3065
02:56:55,940 --> 02:57:00,940
On the other hand,
they may well be my last message to you 

3066
02:57:00,940 --> 02:57:04,810
if they are no through all your life 
that I loved you and baby with all my 

3067
02:57:04,810 --> 02:57:08,480
heart and soul and that you to sweet 
things were just all the world to me.

3068
02:57:08,750 --> 02:57:09,470
I pray,
God,

3069
02:57:09,471 --> 02:57:13,040
I may do my duty for I know that 
whatever that may entail,

3070
02:57:13,250 --> 02:57:18,250
you would not have it otherwise and to 
quote and Peter Hard with remarkable 

3071
02:57:19,851 --> 02:57:24,851
sensitivity as a postscript and says,
quote Charles may the loving husband to 

3072
02:57:25,791 --> 02:57:29,810
Bessie Mae and father to his baby,
pauline would indeed be killed.

3073
02:57:29,811 --> 02:57:32,370
The next day he is buried in the 
dancing,

3074
02:57:32,380 --> 02:57:33,920
galley,
British cemetery,

3075
02:57:34,150 --> 02:57:36,080
small scale tragedies,
litter,

3076
02:57:36,081 --> 02:57:41,081
the history of war,
sad reminders that the necessities of 

3077
02:57:41,081 --> 02:57:44,441
war ruined the lives of millions and the
quote it says,

3078
02:57:44,901 --> 02:57:49,901
we said all this pain from this war or 
like pebbles dropped in water and the 

3079
02:57:50,031 --> 02:57:53,090
ripples outward effect.
The rest of these societies,

3080
02:57:53,091 --> 02:57:55,040
when you have millions of people 
impacted like this,

3081
02:57:55,520 --> 02:58:00,520
the ripple effect effects tens or maybe 
even hundreds of millions of people

3082
02:58:02,490 --> 02:58:07,490
for a while.
The song becomes one of these pebbles 

3083
02:58:07,490 --> 02:58:10,970
that's like ground zero for a huge 
ripple effect that will affect Britain.

3084
02:58:11,760 --> 02:58:12,750
To this day.

3085
02:58:14,330 --> 02:58:19,330
I try to think about what mental state I
would be in after writing a letter like 

3086
02:58:19,330 --> 02:58:23,630
that and when you think about millions 
of people,

3087
02:58:23,750 --> 02:58:28,750
young people mostly being in situations 
where they're writing a letter like 

3088
02:58:28,750 --> 02:58:30,560
that,
how does that change?

3089
02:58:30,561 --> 02:58:35,561
You mean there are going to be 
noticeable changes in this generation of

3090
02:58:37,071 --> 02:58:40,850
people in the four years during this 
first World War I've been comparing this

3091
02:58:40,851 --> 02:58:43,040
period to a historical estuary,
right?

3092
02:58:43,041 --> 02:58:48,041
Where one generation and another 
generation sort of mingled the the old 

3093
02:58:48,041 --> 02:58:52,211
world and the new world,
but maybe it's more of a worm hole 

3094
02:58:52,211 --> 02:58:54,980
through time and when this 19th century 
group of people,

3095
02:58:55,230 --> 02:58:57,740
you know,
transitions through to the 20th century,

3096
02:58:58,100 --> 02:59:03,100
it's not going to make it intact.
It's going to suffer damage on the way 

3097
02:59:03,100 --> 02:59:07,121
through.
It's like a birthing process to the 

3098
02:59:07,121 --> 02:59:07,640
modern era and that can be bloody and 
painful and potentially fatal to

3099
02:59:10,030 --> 02:59:15,030
the British have thought throughout this
war that they've taken large casualties 

3100
02:59:15,030 --> 02:59:17,530
in the battles of 1915 places like 
deliberately.

3101
02:59:17,710 --> 02:59:19,570
Those are large casualties for the 
British,

3102
02:59:19,571 --> 02:59:24,571
which are a traditionally naval power 
and employee relatively by continental 

3103
02:59:24,571 --> 02:59:25,510
standards,
small armies.

3104
02:59:26,500 --> 02:59:31,500
This was the first time they've had a 
large enough army to suffer the kind of 

3105
02:59:31,500 --> 02:59:35,431
casualties that some nations like the 
French or the Germans or the Russians 

3106
02:59:35,431 --> 02:59:39,190
had been suffering this whole time.
On July first 1916,

3107
02:59:39,940 --> 02:59:44,940
the shelling subsides.
The whistles blow and these troops in 

3108
02:59:44,940 --> 02:59:49,261
the morning or told to get out of their 
trenches and had across into no man's 

3109
02:59:49,261 --> 02:59:53,521
land and continued to take the German 
defenses and this is where they find out

3110
02:59:56,140 --> 03:00:00,970
that the assumptions made in the 
planning stages of this conflict haven't

3111
03:00:00,971 --> 03:00:04,360
come to pass the way the military 
experts assumed they would.

3112
03:00:05,560 --> 03:00:10,560
And because of that,
British forces on the very first day of 

3113
03:00:10,901 --> 03:00:14,350
the battle of the somme will suffer.
60,000

3114
03:00:14,351 --> 03:00:17,050
casualties,
20,000

3115
03:00:17,051 --> 03:00:22,051
dead.
There's never been a day like it in 

3116
03:00:22,051 --> 03:00:25,111
British history and now all of a sudden 
they can understand how the French felt 

3117
03:00:25,111 --> 03:00:28,390
you on that August Day in 1914 when they
suffer 22,000

3118
03:00:28,420 --> 03:00:33,420
dead in an afternoon.
These are thoroughly modern casualties 

3119
03:00:33,420 --> 03:00:37,951
into people not accustomed to them.
They are stunning and the fingers start 

3120
03:00:37,951 --> 03:00:40,090
pointing immediately.
What the heck happened?

3121
03:00:41,570 --> 03:00:46,570
A generation of people who've felt this 
visceral really have kept this debate 

3122
03:00:46,570 --> 03:00:48,800
going and it continues between 
historians even today.

3123
03:00:49,790 --> 03:00:53,180
What the hell happened?
Who's responsible for this?

3124
03:00:53,930 --> 03:00:58,930
What happened to the troops?
Will they got out of the trenches only 

3125
03:00:58,930 --> 03:01:00,010
to find that in most areas,
the that this

3126
03:01:00,010 --> 03:01:04,750
artillery would smash up the wire wasn't
true and the wire was there.

3127
03:01:05,530 --> 03:01:10,530
It was a physical impediment in no man's
land trapping troops in the open so they

3128
03:01:10,931 --> 03:01:14,140
could be raped by machine gun fire,
artillery fire too,

3129
03:01:14,141 --> 03:01:19,141
but mainly machine gunfire from those 
Germans who were not as badly affected 

3130
03:01:19,141 --> 03:01:22,060
by the artillery either as the planners 
had assumed they would be.

3131
03:01:23,860 --> 03:01:27,400
Tens of thousands of British soldiers 
are being mowed down all the time.

3132
03:01:27,401 --> 03:01:31,990
One German on the other side of this 
human tragedy at the battle of the Somme

3133
03:01:31,991 --> 03:01:34,510
on the first day is quoted in Ian 
passing in his book,

3134
03:01:34,511 --> 03:01:37,330
all the Kaiser's men and he says,
quote,

3135
03:01:37,840 --> 03:01:41,530
the leading wave of British troops was 
now halfway across.

3136
03:01:41,531 --> 03:01:45,550
No Man's land.
Get ready was passed along our front and

3137
03:01:45,551 --> 03:01:47,910
heads appeared over each shell crater 
edge,

3138
03:01:47,911 --> 03:01:52,911
just final positions were taken up for 
the best view and machine guns mounted 

3139
03:01:52,911 --> 03:01:52,911
firmly in place.

3140
03:01:53,080 --> 03:01:56,380
A moment later when the first British 
line was within 100 yards,

3141
03:01:56,560 --> 03:02:01,560
the rattle of machine gun and rifle fire
broke out along our whole line of shell 

3142
03:02:01,560 --> 03:02:05,671
holes,
followed soon after by deadly accurate 

3143
03:02:05,671 --> 03:02:06,760
shellfire,
the advanced rapidly crumbled under this

3144
03:02:06,761 --> 03:02:09,580
hail of Shell and bullets.
All along the line,

3145
03:02:09,581 --> 03:02:12,220
men could be seen throwing up their arms
and collapsing,

3146
03:02:12,460 --> 03:02:15,280
never to move again.
The extended lines,

3147
03:02:15,281 --> 03:02:19,180
though badly shaken and with many gaps 
now came on all the faster.

3148
03:02:19,420 --> 03:02:22,390
Instead of a leisurely walk,
they covered the ground in short,

3149
03:02:22,391 --> 03:02:27,391
rushes at the double,
and within a few minutes the leading 

3150
03:02:27,391 --> 03:02:29,881
troops had advanced to within a stone's 
throw of our front trench again and 

3151
03:02:29,881 --> 03:02:34,681
again.
The extended lines of British infantry 

3152
03:02:34,681 --> 03:02:36,841
broke against the German defense like 
waves against a cliff only to be beaten 

3153
03:02:36,841 --> 03:02:41,101
back.
It was an amazing spectacle of 

3154
03:02:41,101 --> 03:02:43,591
unexampled,
gallantry courage and bulldog 

3155
03:02:43,591 --> 03:02:44,560
determination on both sides and quote.

3156
03:02:45,760 --> 03:02:48,070
Now those are the troops who made it 
through the wire.

3157
03:02:48,460 --> 03:02:51,730
There were places where gaps had been 
blown in the wire.

3158
03:02:51,940 --> 03:02:55,180
The problem was as the troops would 
congregate at those gaps because they're

3159
03:02:55,181 --> 03:03:00,181
the only way to the other side,
and then get stuck in giant backups as 

3160
03:03:00,181 --> 03:03:04,361
as a small stream of troops made it 
through the corridor and those those 

3161
03:03:04,361 --> 03:03:08,311
backups in those globs of soldiers just 
waiting for their chance to get through 

3162
03:03:08,311 --> 03:03:11,821
the corridor,
the wire would be mowed down by shell 

3163
03:03:11,821 --> 03:03:14,191
fire and machine gun fire this day has 
so affected the British,

3164
03:03:14,411 --> 03:03:16,160
in fact,
it's their version of redundancy.

3165
03:03:16,180 --> 03:03:19,660
What ridden is to the French soul.
The Psalm is to the British one,

3166
03:03:19,780 --> 03:03:22,330
and in his divided historians ever 
since,

3167
03:03:22,480 --> 03:03:26,260
and you can see normally calm and sedate
rather cold.

3168
03:03:26,261 --> 03:03:30,100
Sometimes British historians lose their 
head over this subject.

3169
03:03:30,510 --> 03:03:31,750
I mean John Keegan,
who,

3170
03:03:31,751 --> 03:03:32,550
um,
I've,

3171
03:03:32,580 --> 03:03:34,600
I've said it's not my favorite but,
but the,

3172
03:03:34,660 --> 03:03:39,660
the two world wars I think are,
are his strong point and you can tell 

3173
03:03:39,660 --> 03:03:43,501
he's a guy who's hung out with some of 
the enlisted troops that were trapped 

3174
03:03:43,501 --> 03:03:48,000
that day at the somme because their 
continued anger and incredibility about 

3175
03:03:49,451 --> 03:03:50,980
this whole thing has rubbed off on him.

3176
03:03:51,070 --> 03:03:53,860
And by the way,
if you were trapped there like a sitting

3177
03:03:53,861 --> 03:03:55,360
duck on,
you know,

3178
03:03:55,500 --> 03:04:00,500
an open plane in no man's land watching 
your buddies get blown to bits and 

3179
03:04:00,500 --> 03:04:00,860
you're freaking out.
You would be thinking to,

3180
03:04:00,861 --> 03:04:03,410
who the hell put me here?
Who's responsible for this?

3181
03:04:03,411 --> 03:04:05,240
If I ever get out of this,
heads will roll.

3182
03:04:05,710 --> 03:04:10,710
And of course,
most of these British troops at this 

3183
03:04:10,710 --> 03:04:13,571
battle or not have a class in British 
society that could have made much of a 

3184
03:04:13,571 --> 03:04:17,260
fuss,
but they've got loyal defenders who 

3185
03:04:17,260 --> 03:04:17,260
will,
when this is over,

3186
03:04:17,260 --> 03:04:18,020
Keegan's one of them,
by the way,

3187
03:04:18,890 --> 03:04:23,890
you can.
You can just feel the anger when he 

3188
03:04:23,890 --> 03:04:23,890
writes quote

3189
03:04:24,140 --> 03:04:26,840
in all,
the British had lost about 60,000

3190
03:04:27,020 --> 03:04:32,020
of whom 21,000
have been killed most in the first hour 

3191
03:04:32,020 --> 03:04:35,801
of the attack.
Perhaps the first minutes the trenches 

3192
03:04:35,801 --> 03:04:36,290
wrote Robert Key.
Fifty years later.

3193
03:04:36,410 --> 03:04:41,410
Now he's quoting Robert key quote where 
the concentration camps of the first 

3194
03:04:41,410 --> 03:04:45,611
world war now Keagan talks again and 
though the analogy is what an academic 

3195
03:04:45,611 --> 03:04:50,381
review or would call an historical,
there is something Treblinka like about 

3196
03:04:50,721 --> 03:04:55,721
almost all accounts of the first of July
about these long dos lines of young men.

3197
03:04:56,300 --> 03:05:01,300
Shoddily uniformed heavily burdened 
numbered about their next to identify 

3198
03:05:01,700 --> 03:05:06,700
after they were killed,
plodding forward across a featureless 

3199
03:05:06,700 --> 03:05:10,031
landscape to their own extermination.
Inside the barbed wire accounts of the 

3200
03:05:10,031 --> 03:05:11,000
psalm,
he writes,

3201
03:05:11,270 --> 03:05:16,270
producing readers and audiences much the
same range of emotions as do 

3202
03:05:16,270 --> 03:05:17,450
descriptions of the running of 
Auschwitz,

3203
03:05:17,780 --> 03:05:20,390
guilty fascination,
incredulity,

3204
03:05:20,450 --> 03:05:21,770
horror,
disgust,

3205
03:05:21,890 --> 03:05:26,890
pity and anger and quote,
and then he goes on to say that this is 

3206
03:05:26,890 --> 03:05:31,520
not just from the peaceniks and 
tenderhearted out there,

3207
03:05:32,180 --> 03:05:37,180
not just from the military historians 
where you get it from either but he 

3208
03:05:37,180 --> 03:05:40,451
goes,
but from the professional troops to he 

3209
03:05:40,451 --> 03:05:40,451
says,
quote,

3210
03:05:40,451 --> 03:05:45,160
anger is the response which the story of
the Somme most commonly evokes among 

3211
03:05:45,160 --> 03:05:45,980
professionals,
meaning soldiers.

3212
03:05:46,400 --> 03:05:48,590
Why did the commander's not do something
about it?

3213
03:05:48,770 --> 03:05:53,770
Why do they let the attack go on?
Why did they not stop one battalion 

3214
03:05:53,770 --> 03:05:56,510
following the wake of another to join it
in death and quote?

3215
03:05:57,940 --> 03:06:00,130
He then goes on to say that some 
battalions were stopped,

3216
03:06:00,370 --> 03:06:03,490
but that's one of the things that so 
many people got angry about is that once

3217
03:06:03,491 --> 03:06:04,990
you saw,
for example,

3218
03:06:05,170 --> 03:06:09,610
that the wire was still there,
why did you let more lines of troops get

3219
03:06:09,611 --> 03:06:14,611
up out of the trenches and followed the 
people who just got destroyed in front 

3220
03:06:14,611 --> 03:06:17,280
of them?
This is how someone like,

3221
03:06:17,281 --> 03:06:21,390
Hey,
Haig gets a reputation for a butcher.

3222
03:06:23,280 --> 03:06:24,990
Now I've gone out of my way in this 
program.

3223
03:06:24,991 --> 03:06:28,380
I think you've probably noticed too in 
1915,

3224
03:06:28,410 --> 03:06:31,410
cut these general slack because they're 
learning,

3225
03:06:31,411 --> 03:06:36,411
right?
This is all new stuff and until you 

3226
03:06:36,411 --> 03:06:36,411
experiment a little,
you don't know how to use it.

3227
03:06:36,411 --> 03:06:40,640
You don't know what it can do,
but at what point can you start holding 

3228
03:06:40,651 --> 03:06:43,830
these people accountable for not 
learning?

3229
03:06:45,780 --> 03:06:50,400
There was a great line from the civilian
political leader,

3230
03:06:50,401 --> 03:06:50,940
Germany,

3231
03:06:52,450 --> 03:06:56,850
a guy named Beth [inaudible] and he was 
telling Kaiser by the end of 1916,

3232
03:06:56,851 --> 03:06:59,430
he's talking about Falcon nine here,
the German military leader,

3233
03:06:59,880 --> 03:07:04,620
but it could equally apply to a lot of 
military leaders in this war,

3234
03:07:04,621 --> 03:07:07,310
especially at this time.
He asked the kaiser quote,

3235
03:07:08,160 --> 03:07:13,160
where does incompetency end and 
criminality begin and to quote,

3236
03:07:14,850 --> 03:07:19,850
how many lives are you allowed to lose 
experimenting before you learn your 

3237
03:07:19,850 --> 03:07:23,511
lessons?
But there are a great many military 

3238
03:07:23,511 --> 03:07:23,790
historians today who are trying once 
again to say,

3239
03:07:23,791 --> 03:07:25,200
listen,
that's what they're doing.

3240
03:07:25,500 --> 03:07:28,230
We're still holding them to too high a 
standard.

3241
03:07:28,231 --> 03:07:31,770
Too much hindsight going on here.
Here's what Peter Harte writes,

3242
03:07:31,800 --> 03:07:33,930
quote,
for many people,

3243
03:07:34,080 --> 03:07:38,700
the Psalm and the equally ugly Verdun 
have come to symbolize the great war.

3244
03:07:38,880 --> 03:07:43,880
Few child battles fought with other 
people's lives by incompetence and 

3245
03:07:43,880 --> 03:07:45,390
uncaring generals in particular for the 
British.

3246
03:07:45,391 --> 03:07:48,120
He says,
the disaster of the first of July on the

3247
03:07:48,121 --> 03:07:53,121
Psalm has become the sole prism through 
which the conduct of the whole of the 

3248
03:07:53,121 --> 03:07:53,340
great war has been viewed.

3249
03:07:53,730 --> 03:07:56,670
There is no light and shade here,
just a dark,

3250
03:07:56,671 --> 03:08:00,180
just spare the numbing horror of the 
teaming casualties,

3251
03:08:00,600 --> 03:08:05,340
explanations of what went wrong and why 
are thrust aside indeed in the past,

3252
03:08:05,430 --> 03:08:10,430
subdued references to a quote end quote,
learning curve for the generals have 

3253
03:08:10,711 --> 03:08:14,520
been seen as an insult to the dead.
There remains a widespread belief.

3254
03:08:14,521 --> 03:08:19,521
He writes that there must have been a 
better way something else could or 

3255
03:08:19,521 --> 03:08:20,700
should have been done.
Someone must be blamed.

3256
03:08:20,970 --> 03:08:24,090
Much of this appropriate has fallen on 
the head of Douglas Haig,

3257
03:08:24,300 --> 03:08:27,300
who has at times been reviled as a mass 
murderer.

3258
03:08:27,570 --> 03:08:32,570
Yet this was the inevitable price of 
engaging in continental warfare on the 

3259
03:08:32,570 --> 03:08:34,290
main field of battle against the primary
enemy.

3260
03:08:34,620 --> 03:08:37,620
France was well accustomed to the pain 
of continental warfare,

3261
03:08:37,890 --> 03:08:41,880
but for Britain it was a new experience.
Germany had no exposed flanks,

3262
03:08:42,030 --> 03:08:47,030
just the imposing fortifications of the 
western front defending their 1914 gains

3263
03:08:47,371 --> 03:08:48,990
rested from France and Belgium.

3264
03:08:49,410 --> 03:08:54,410
Unfortunately for all their tactical 
improvement and technical innovations 

3265
03:08:54,410 --> 03:08:58,310
that British were just simply not able 
to breach those defenses or kill 

3266
03:08:58,310 --> 03:09:02,091
sufficient Germans even in concert with 
the French at Verdun to bring Germany to

3267
03:09:02,401 --> 03:09:07,401
its knees and to quote.
It also makes you wonder a little about 

3268
03:09:08,431 --> 03:09:13,431
the quality of the human beings who are 
commanding these endeavors were making 

3269
03:09:13,981 --> 03:09:18,981
these plans and who are watching all 
these people die and be wounded because 

3270
03:09:19,891 --> 03:09:21,000
of these plans.
In other words,

3271
03:09:21,240 --> 03:09:23,730
how bad does the general field the next 
day?

3272
03:09:24,390 --> 03:09:26,910
Well,
it's not something you can easily figure

3273
03:09:26,911 --> 03:09:27,870
out.
Again,

3274
03:09:27,871 --> 03:09:31,890
John Keegan seems to be so angry at the 
field marshal here.

3275
03:09:32,070 --> 03:09:34,950
I'm still for this conflict that he,
he,

3276
03:09:35,040 --> 03:09:40,040
he writes an answer to that question,
kind of what kind of man do you have to 

3277
03:09:40,040 --> 03:09:42,600
be to suffer those kinds of casualties?
And the next day think about continuing.

3278
03:09:43,920 --> 03:09:44,790
Keegan writes,
quote,

3279
03:09:45,420 --> 03:09:45,970
Hey,
meg,

3280
03:09:46,020 --> 03:09:51,000
whom his contemporaries found difficult 
to know has become today and enigma,

3281
03:09:51,330 --> 03:09:53,560
the successful generals of the first 
world war,

3282
03:09:53,770 --> 03:09:58,150
those who did not crack outright or 
decline gradually into pessimism.

3283
03:09:58,390 --> 03:10:03,390
We're a hard lot as they had to be with 
the casualty figures accumulating on 

3284
03:10:03,390 --> 03:10:07,501
their desk.
Some nonetheless managed to combine 

3285
03:10:07,501 --> 03:10:09,980
toughness of mind with some striking 
human characteristic is y'all.

3286
03:10:10,300 --> 03:10:13,840
He says imperturbability,
Hindenburg,

3287
03:10:14,170 --> 03:10:15,880
gravity,
fall,

3288
03:10:16,330 --> 03:10:19,000
fire,
Kemal certainty.

3289
03:10:19,280 --> 03:10:24,280
Hey,
he says in whose public manner and 

3290
03:10:24,280 --> 03:10:26,200
private diaries,
no concern for human suffering was or is

3291
03:10:26,201 --> 03:10:31,201
discernible,
compensated for his aloofness with 

3292
03:10:31,201 --> 03:10:33,760
nothing whatsoever of the common touch.
He seemed to move through the horrors of

3293
03:10:33,761 --> 03:10:37,360
the first world war as if guided by some
inner voice.

3294
03:10:37,510 --> 03:10:42,510
Speaking of a higher purpose and a 
personal destiny that we now know he 

3295
03:10:42,510 --> 03:10:47,191
says was not just appearance.
Haig was a devoted both of spiritualist 

3296
03:10:47,191 --> 03:10:50,770
practices and a fundamentalist religion.
As a young officer,

3297
03:10:50,890 --> 03:10:55,890
he had taken to attending seances where 
the medium put him in touch with 

3298
03:10:55,890 --> 03:11:00,091
Napoleon as commander in chief.
He fell under the influence of a 

3299
03:11:00,091 --> 03:11:03,451
Presbyterian chaplain who's sermons 
confirmed him in his belief that he was 

3300
03:11:03,451 --> 03:11:08,101
in direct communication with God and had
a major part to play in a divine plan 

3301
03:11:08,101 --> 03:11:13,051
for the world.
His own simple religion Keagan says he 

3302
03:11:13,051 --> 03:11:16,771
was convinced was shared by his soldiers
who were inspired thereby to bear the 

3303
03:11:16,771 --> 03:11:20,350
dangers and sufferings which were there 
part of the war.

3304
03:11:20,410 --> 03:11:22,900
He was directing and quote,

3305
03:11:24,050 --> 03:11:29,050
wow,
welcome to the controversy and the heat 

3306
03:11:29,400 --> 03:11:34,400
that the battle of the Somme has 
generated amongst those who write about 

3307
03:11:34,400 --> 03:11:35,220
it,
but justifiably so,

3308
03:11:35,221 --> 03:11:40,221
I think I'm truthfully,
I think there were military people who 

3309
03:11:40,491 --> 03:11:44,530
were certainly willing to forgive 
Douglas Haig for suffering.

3310
03:11:44,531 --> 03:11:49,531
60,000
casualties on the first day of the 

3311
03:11:49,531 --> 03:11:49,531
battle of the somme.
If he didn't flick,

3312
03:11:49,531 --> 03:11:51,130
did something like 60,000
on the Germans.

3313
03:11:52,100 --> 03:11:57,100
Instead the British suffer.
Those kinds of casualty in the German 

3314
03:11:57,100 --> 03:11:58,340
casualties may have been as low as 
6,000.

3315
03:11:59,210 --> 03:12:04,210
12,000
is the high number of you sometimes see 

3316
03:12:04,210 --> 03:12:04,210
split the difference,
say 8,000,

3317
03:12:04,210 --> 03:12:05,330
so take 60,
give eight.

3318
03:12:05,331 --> 03:12:10,220
You get your face ripped off.
Not exactly the position you want,

3319
03:12:10,520 --> 03:12:12,410
your brand new general,
the new blood.

3320
03:12:12,411 --> 03:12:17,411
The person is going to bring a new sense
of success to the war on the western 

3321
03:12:17,411 --> 03:12:17,870
front.
All of a sudden,

3322
03:12:17,871 --> 03:12:22,871
Douglas Haig doesn't look a whole lot 
better than the people who came before 

3323
03:12:22,871 --> 03:12:22,871
him.
Heck,

3324
03:12:22,871 --> 03:12:24,440
John French could have had your separate
60,000

3325
03:12:24,441 --> 03:12:25,850
casualties on the first day of the 
Somme,

3326
03:12:25,851 --> 03:12:27,530
right?
The previous commander.

3327
03:12:29,400 --> 03:12:34,400
Now to put those numbers in perspective,
because I always have to do this for 

3328
03:12:34,400 --> 03:12:35,340
myself.
60,000.

3329
03:12:35,341 --> 03:12:36,610
That's an amorphous number.
What?

3330
03:12:36,620 --> 03:12:41,620
What does that compare to?
You have to understand that the British 

3331
03:12:41,620 --> 03:12:44,421
for 101 years by the battle of the 
psalms time had been talking about a 

3332
03:12:44,421 --> 03:12:44,970
horrible day.
They'd suffered,

3333
03:12:45,330 --> 03:12:47,190
you know,
finishing off Napoleon,

3334
03:12:47,191 --> 03:12:48,600
the waterloo,
right in 18,

3335
03:12:48,610 --> 03:12:52,340
15 on Napoleon killed 84 British

3336
03:12:52,340 --> 03:12:57,340
soldiers.
Eighty 400 compared to 20 or 21 or 

3337
03:12:57,340 --> 03:12:58,160
19,000.
That's huge difference,

3338
03:12:58,161 --> 03:13:00,380
right?
But how about the Second World War?

3339
03:13:00,381 --> 03:13:05,381
You always think of the second world war
as being worse than the first when the 

3340
03:13:05,381 --> 03:13:08,750
British and Americans landed on the 
beaches of Normandy on June six,

3341
03:13:08,751 --> 03:13:10,760
19,
44 for the famous Dj landings,

3342
03:13:10,761 --> 03:13:15,761
and then pushed inland a not enough 
attention paid to key part of that whole

3343
03:13:16,341 --> 03:13:16,790
thing.
You know,

3344
03:13:16,791 --> 03:13:19,460
widening at the bridge had,
it was hard combat.

3345
03:13:19,461 --> 03:13:24,461
It was historically hard combat,
but it took the British and the 

3346
03:13:24,461 --> 03:13:27,320
Americans combined 20 days to reach 
20,000

3347
03:13:27,321 --> 03:13:31,460
casualties,
so it took them 20 days combined British

3348
03:13:31,461 --> 03:13:35,330
and Americans to reach one third.
The amount of casualties,

3349
03:13:35,840 --> 03:13:38,750
the British alone suffered on the first 
day of the battle of the somme.

3350
03:13:38,780 --> 03:13:40,730
That's wild.
That's crazy.

3351
03:13:42,660 --> 03:13:47,660
And it sounds like Verdun doesn't it?
Those numbers start to sound like what 

3352
03:13:47,660 --> 03:13:50,880
the French are suffering,
that horrible battle to bleed their army

3353
03:13:50,881 --> 03:13:52,470
white.
Well,

3354
03:13:52,530 --> 03:13:57,530
David Fromkin in his book,
a piece to end all peace quotes Norman 

3355
03:13:57,530 --> 03:13:58,000
stone about,
you know,

3356
03:13:58,001 --> 03:14:02,190
how large these battles were compared to
what the people in Europe are used to.

3357
03:14:02,191 --> 03:14:03,060
And he says,
quote,

3358
03:14:04,020 --> 03:14:09,020
it has been estimated that the total of 
military and civilian casualties in all 

3359
03:14:10,741 --> 03:14:15,741
of Europe,
domestic and international conflicts in 

3360
03:14:15,741 --> 03:14:19,221
the hundred years between 18,
15 and 1915 was no greater than a single

3361
03:14:20,701 --> 03:14:25,701
day's combat losses in any of the great 
battles of 1916 and quote,

3362
03:14:28,510 --> 03:14:33,510
that's an incredible statistic when you 
think of all of the battles that 

3363
03:14:33,510 --> 03:14:34,930
Europeans fought in Europe and in 
colonies and all those things,

3364
03:14:35,530 --> 03:14:40,530
all of it put together and all of the 
European countries for a hundred years 

3365
03:14:41,110 --> 03:14:45,370
doesn't equal one of the bad days at 
Verdun or the somme.

3366
03:14:47,570 --> 03:14:52,010
The societies that could handle these 
kinds of casualties were remarkable,

3367
03:14:52,280 --> 03:14:57,280
but they took their toll.
As you might imagine by the time five 

3368
03:14:57,280 --> 03:15:01,581
months of the psalm is over,
you have another million casualties 

3369
03:15:01,581 --> 03:15:06,501
basically in five months.
So freedom gives you roughly about a 

3370
03:15:06,501 --> 03:15:10,611
million.
And the Psalm gives you roughly about a 

3371
03:15:10,611 --> 03:15:11,430
million all at the same time.

3372
03:15:12,940 --> 03:15:16,390
The burn rate on the western front is 
horrifying in 1916.

3373
03:15:16,870 --> 03:15:21,870
And remember,
all of these battles are like a lot of 

3374
03:15:21,870 --> 03:15:25,260
littler battles sort of lumped together 
at the somme.

3375
03:15:25,261 --> 03:15:30,261
For example,
the Germans will counter attack in that 

3376
03:15:30,261 --> 03:15:33,141
five month period,
more than 300 times a ton of those 

3377
03:15:33,141 --> 03:15:34,440
counterattacks in ancient times would 
have been a battle all by itself,

3378
03:15:34,441 --> 03:15:39,441
right?
Part of the reason why it's so hard to 

3379
03:15:39,441 --> 03:15:41,961
follow the nature of these battles.
Churchill has an overall description 

3380
03:15:43,200 --> 03:15:48,200
that is just horrifying of a conceptual 
view of this that makes you understand 

3381
03:15:48,871 --> 03:15:50,010
what really going on,

3382
03:15:50,220 --> 03:15:55,220
if you could view it sort of from space,
and he writes about both the Somme and 

3383
03:15:55,220 --> 03:15:55,640
verdun quote,

3384
03:15:57,010 --> 03:16:00,550
the anatomy of the battles of Verdun and
the Somme was the same.

3385
03:16:00,880 --> 03:16:04,030
A battlefield had been selected around 
this battlefield.

3386
03:16:04,031 --> 03:16:06,400
Walls were built double,
triple,

3387
03:16:06,401 --> 03:16:08,830
quadruple,
have enormous cannon.

3388
03:16:09,250 --> 03:16:14,250
Behind these railways were constructed 
to feed them and mountains are shells 

3389
03:16:14,250 --> 03:16:16,480
were built up.
All this was the work of months.

3390
03:16:16,870 --> 03:16:19,390
Thus,
the battlefield was completely encircled

3391
03:16:19,510 --> 03:16:24,510
by thousands of guns of all sizes and a 
wide oval space prepared in their midst.

3392
03:16:25,180 --> 03:16:30,180
Through this awful arena,
all the divisions of each army battered 

3393
03:16:30,180 --> 03:16:34,711
ceaselessly by the enveloping artillery 
were made to pass in succession as if 

3394
03:16:34,841 --> 03:16:39,841
they were in the teeth of interlocking 
cog wheels grinding each other for month

3395
03:16:39,851 --> 03:16:41,260
after month,
he writes,

3396
03:16:41,410 --> 03:16:46,410
the ceaseless cannonade continued at its
utmost intensity and month after month,

3397
03:16:46,731 --> 03:16:51,731
the gallon divisions of heroic human 
beings were torn to pieces in this 

3398
03:16:51,731 --> 03:16:53,950
terrible rotation.
Then came the winter,

3399
03:16:54,130 --> 03:16:59,130
pouring down rain from the sky to clog 
the feet of men and drawing veils of 

3400
03:16:59,130 --> 03:17:01,690
missed before the Hawk eyes of their 
artillery.

3401
03:17:01,900 --> 03:17:06,900
The arena as used to happen in the 
coliseum in those miniature Roman days 

3402
03:17:06,900 --> 03:17:11,110
was flooded with water.
A vast sea of in sanguine mage earned by

3403
03:17:11,111 --> 03:17:16,111
thousands of vehicles by hundreds of 
thousands of men and millions of shells 

3404
03:17:16,111 --> 03:17:18,760
replaced the blasted dust.
Still,

3405
03:17:18,970 --> 03:17:23,970
the struggle continued still,
the remorseless wheels revolved still.

3406
03:17:24,071 --> 03:17:27,400
The auditorium of artillery roared at 
last.

3407
03:17:27,550 --> 03:17:31,030
The legs of men could no longer move.
They wallowed in,

3408
03:17:31,031 --> 03:17:36,031
floundered helplessly in the slime.
They are food and ammunition lagged 

3409
03:17:36,031 --> 03:17:38,130
behind them along the smash in choked 
roadways.

3410
03:17:39,440 --> 03:17:40,020
And to quote,

3411
03:17:41,920 --> 03:17:46,920
I keep quoting Churchill because wasn't 
that positively tolken ask by the way,

3412
03:17:49,301 --> 03:17:54,301
there are people who you know,
say that Tolkien's experiences with the 

3413
03:17:54,301 --> 03:17:57,880
first world war influenced in his way of
writing and thinking,

3414
03:17:58,540 --> 03:18:03,540
but if it did,
he would have been just one of millions 

3415
03:18:03,540 --> 03:18:05,050
of other people that had their outlook 
transformed by this conflict.

3416
03:18:05,051 --> 03:18:06,130
And how could you not?

3417
03:18:08,050 --> 03:18:13,050
As we said,
you imagine writing that last letter 

3418
03:18:13,050 --> 03:18:14,650
home where it's essentially a goodbye 
letter that can change you,

3419
03:18:14,651 --> 03:18:19,651
can't it?
I known a lot of people who've had 

3420
03:18:19,651 --> 03:18:21,511
terminal illnesses,
had months to know that death was in 

3421
03:18:21,511 --> 03:18:23,380
their near future.
It often changes them.

3422
03:18:23,860 --> 03:18:27,100
It often creates this introspective 
mood.

3423
03:18:27,101 --> 03:18:32,101
We're all of a sudden they're focusing 
on subjects that people don't usually 

3424
03:18:32,101 --> 03:18:34,720
spend hour after hour,
day after day,

3425
03:18:34,721 --> 03:18:36,540
focusing on,
but it's right in front of them,

3426
03:18:36,541 --> 03:18:38,740
right?
If you have terminal cancer,

3427
03:18:39,490 --> 03:18:43,870
it's going to be on your mind and the 
thinking about it changes you.

3428
03:18:44,110 --> 03:18:49,110
What if you had a terminal disease and 
all of a sudden at the last minute the 

3429
03:18:49,110 --> 03:18:52,831
doctors figured out a way to cure you 
when you were dragged back from the 

3430
03:18:52,831 --> 03:18:55,651
brink,
but you'd spend a couple of months 

3431
03:18:55,651 --> 03:18:57,691
thinking intensely about life and death 
and the meaning of things and what you 

3432
03:18:57,731 --> 03:19:02,731
would've done differently in all these 
really heavy duty thoughts that most 

3433
03:19:02,731 --> 03:19:04,380
people can only stand to think about in 
short little bursts.

3434
03:19:04,380 --> 03:19:07,360
Usually there are exceptions.
Now,

3435
03:19:07,361 --> 03:19:11,380
imagine millions of people during this 
19,

3436
03:19:11,381 --> 03:19:12,280
14,
19,

3437
03:19:12,281 --> 03:19:17,281
18 period who would have found 
themselves in a similar sort of a 

3438
03:19:17,281 --> 03:19:21,361
situation.
Pretty much sure they were going to die 

3439
03:19:21,361 --> 03:19:24,961
in the near future.
We'll be horribly disfigured thinking 

3440
03:19:24,961 --> 03:19:27,301
about the heaviest of subjects,
writing letters home to loved ones 

3441
03:19:27,301 --> 03:19:27,301
saying,
you know,

3442
03:19:27,301 --> 03:19:28,930
I'm going to miss not knowing my baby 
daughter,

3443
03:19:28,931 --> 03:19:33,931
and then some of them getting a reprieve
and getting a chance to live this life.

3444
03:19:34,871 --> 03:19:39,640
They were all but writing off during the
worst of these war experiences.

3445
03:19:40,480 --> 03:19:45,480
That is a searing personal experience 
that millions of individual persons went

3446
03:19:47,231 --> 03:19:52,231
through.
How does that not change the society 

3447
03:19:52,231 --> 03:19:55,261
when they go home and you know,
one of the things about battles,

3448
03:19:55,391 --> 03:19:58,090
especially these first world war battles
is they're so dark,

3449
03:19:58,091 --> 03:20:02,230
aren't they and theirs so industrial and
they're so unbelievably horrifying.

3450
03:20:02,230 --> 03:20:07,230
The charnal houses,
Zombie graveyard feel of the 

3451
03:20:07,230 --> 03:20:10,441
battlefields and the first world war 
make that particularly in a mind 

3452
03:20:10,441 --> 03:20:13,480
bending.
You'll see a lot of art around the first

3453
03:20:13,481 --> 03:20:18,481
world war that shows corpses decaying 
and it's not so you feel sympathy with 

3454
03:20:18,671 --> 03:20:23,671
the dead figure.
It's so that you understand what it was 

3455
03:20:23,671 --> 03:20:26,791
like for those people living amongst all
those decaying corpse is to deal with 

3456
03:20:26,791 --> 03:20:31,231
that reality.
Mind bending battles mind bending 

3457
03:20:31,231 --> 03:20:31,231
enough,
right?

3458
03:20:31,231 --> 03:20:35,130
You add all the incredible artillery,
which is disorienting as as all get out 

3459
03:20:35,321 --> 03:20:40,321
and then throw in bodies,
pieces of bodies everywhere when you're 

3460
03:20:40,321 --> 03:20:40,321
living,
as we've said,

3461
03:20:40,321 --> 03:20:41,680
it's a unique experience.

3462
03:20:43,360 --> 03:20:48,360
It's a form of hell and yet to someone 
like yours truly that creates the 

3463
03:20:50,380 --> 03:20:55,380
circumstances where human brotherly love
appears so like a light in the darkness.

3464
03:21:01,270 --> 03:21:05,890
Part of why battles are interesting to 
study is because as you probably figured

3465
03:21:05,891 --> 03:21:10,891
out,
you can see the worst of human behavior 

3466
03:21:10,891 --> 03:21:12,961
and man's inhumanity to man in them,
but you can also see these pieces of 

3467
03:21:13,721 --> 03:21:18,721
humanity slip through and when they do,
they are all the more bright and 

3468
03:21:19,001 --> 03:21:22,000
noticeable because they're happening in 
hell as opposed to,

3469
03:21:22,020 --> 03:21:27,020
you know,
something that happens in your 

3470
03:21:27,020 --> 03:21:27,020
neighborhood,
right little piece of humanity,

3471
03:21:27,020 --> 03:21:30,271
not that surprising in your neighborhood
probably makes your day a little 

3472
03:21:30,271 --> 03:21:33,301
brighter.
A piece of humanity in the hell have 

3473
03:21:33,301 --> 03:21:35,821
these battlefields has a rejuvenating 
effect for ones feel about man.

3474
03:21:37,870 --> 03:21:42,870
Take for example the sacrifice.
These no man's land in the fighting 

3475
03:21:46,191 --> 03:21:49,700
lines of the two sides on the western 
front created something that the battles

3476
03:21:49,701 --> 03:21:51,410
have had forever.
I mean in the Second World War,

3477
03:21:51,411 --> 03:21:53,390
you'd have these crossroads,
for example,

3478
03:21:53,391 --> 03:21:55,580
where some machine gunner had set up and
now all of a sudden,

3479
03:21:55,740 --> 03:21:57,730
you know,
it was death to cross this crossroads,

3480
03:21:57,740 --> 03:22:02,540
but the western front is hundreds of 
miles of trench lines.

3481
03:22:02,870 --> 03:22:07,870
All of them with this dead zone in 
between and on the really big fronts 

3482
03:22:07,870 --> 03:22:11,801
where a lot was happening,
there was tons of drama in those dead 

3483
03:22:11,801 --> 03:22:14,330
zones.
Things would happen that would challenge

3484
03:22:14,331 --> 03:22:18,110
men's morality and what you're willing 
to do.

3485
03:22:18,111 --> 03:22:21,140
A perfect example is in the battle of 
the somme.

3486
03:22:22,310 --> 03:22:25,310
When the 60,000
casualties and a lot of other casualties

3487
03:22:25,311 --> 03:22:26,990
over the course of that battle are 
happening,

3488
03:22:27,350 --> 03:22:32,350
the Germans are often taking pity on 
their fellow human beings and the 

3489
03:22:32,350 --> 03:22:37,181
British right about it.
I mean when these British attacks would 

3490
03:22:37,181 --> 03:22:42,141
break against the German defenses and 
the wounded would start back toward the 

3491
03:22:42,141 --> 03:22:45,891
safety of their own trenches,
grabbing even worse wounded people with 

3492
03:22:45,891 --> 03:22:48,300
them and trying to under machine guns 
and artillery fire get back to their own

3493
03:22:48,540 --> 03:22:53,540
trenches.
A lot of times these Germans would just 

3494
03:22:53,540 --> 03:22:55,521
stop shooting on the first terrible day.
There were oftentimes where the machine 

3495
03:22:55,521 --> 03:22:56,970
gunners in the officers would just say,
stop,

3496
03:22:57,090 --> 03:22:59,650
let them get back.
It's the human thing to do.

3497
03:22:59,680 --> 03:22:59,980
Right?

3498
03:23:00,760 --> 03:23:02,800
On the other hand,
if they had just machine gun them,

3499
03:23:03,160 --> 03:23:08,160
that window surprised anybody either,
but what do you do now about those 

3500
03:23:08,681 --> 03:23:13,681
people who are stuck out there in no 
man's land after the attack is over?

3501
03:23:14,070 --> 03:23:16,960
There are all sorts of stories about 
people who will simply,

3502
03:23:17,020 --> 03:23:19,660
if they can drag themselves to the 
nearest shell hole,

3503
03:23:19,810 --> 03:23:23,080
wrap themselves up in the tarp.
They keep to keep the rain out,

3504
03:23:23,290 --> 03:23:28,290
you know,
open up a Bible and just die in those 

3505
03:23:28,290 --> 03:23:28,290
shell holes,
but when they don't,

3506
03:23:28,420 --> 03:23:31,240
they can often have a terrible effect on
the men in the trenches,

3507
03:23:31,241 --> 03:23:36,241
on both sides.
The Apaches in the American south west 

3508
03:23:36,241 --> 03:23:40,171
used to be able to make such good use of
hostages and if you threatened to 

3509
03:23:40,171 --> 03:23:42,400
torture a hostage or you did torture a 
hostage,

3510
03:23:42,401 --> 03:23:45,850
you could get all kinds of concessions 
from the other side.

3511
03:23:46,330 --> 03:23:51,330
Well,
there are hostages that fate is holding 

3512
03:23:51,330 --> 03:23:51,370
in the middle of those no man's land 
areas.

3513
03:23:51,700 --> 03:23:56,700
And what do you do when one of them 
starts asking for help and they're 

3514
03:23:56,700 --> 03:23:59,950
basically calling to you and your body's
from no man's land.

3515
03:24:01,540 --> 03:24:06,540
If you want to see their heroism and the
sacrifice that human beings can show in 

3516
03:24:06,941 --> 03:24:11,941
in these hellish situations,
read the accounts over and over about 

3517
03:24:11,941 --> 03:24:15,781
how men dealt with screams for help from
no man's land.

3518
03:24:17,800 --> 03:24:22,800
A perfect example of the kind of moral 
dilemmas and self sacrifice that these 

3519
03:24:22,800 --> 03:24:27,040
situations,
you know create is the story that Robert

3520
03:24:27,040 --> 03:24:32,040
Graves tells in goodbye all that when he
was serving at the Somme on the western 

3521
03:24:32,040 --> 03:24:35,731
front and a soldier named Samson gets 
hit in the wave before graves is wave 

3522
03:24:36,611 --> 03:24:38,860
goes over the top.
So graves is just getting ready for this

3523
03:24:38,861 --> 03:24:43,861
intense experience himself of going over
the top of the trench with other human 

3524
03:24:43,861 --> 03:24:44,790
beings right into the teeth of machine 
gunfire.

3525
03:24:44,970 --> 03:24:48,840
And all of a sudden you hear the sound 
of somebody from the last attack,

3526
03:24:49,260 --> 03:24:54,260
from no man's land.
You know where it's death to stand up 

3527
03:24:54,260 --> 03:24:56,820
and move around asking for help or 
screaming out.

3528
03:24:56,821 --> 03:24:58,470
And here's what graves rights.
Remember,

3529
03:24:58,471 --> 03:25:00,720
he's,
he's in the state himself and thinking,

3530
03:25:00,721 --> 03:25:05,721
okay,
I've got to walk into machine gunfire 

3531
03:25:05,721 --> 03:25:05,970
and I've just seen all these other 
people die in front of me.

3532
03:25:05,970 --> 03:25:08,190
Quote,
my mouth was dry,

3533
03:25:08,430 --> 03:25:11,580
my eyes out of focus and my legs quaking
under me.

3534
03:25:11,880 --> 03:25:15,210
I found a water bottle full of Ramen,
drank about half a pint.

3535
03:25:15,450 --> 03:25:17,820
It quieted me in.
My head remained clear.

3536
03:25:18,210 --> 03:25:21,960
Samson lay groaning about 20 yards 
beyond the front trench.

3537
03:25:22,200 --> 03:25:24,180
Several attempts were made to rescue 
him.

3538
03:25:24,181 --> 03:25:29,181
He'd been very badly hit.
Three men got killed in those attempts 

3539
03:25:29,181 --> 03:25:31,230
to officers in two men wounded in the 
end,

3540
03:25:31,350 --> 03:25:33,960
his own orderly managed to crawl out to 
him.

3541
03:25:34,170 --> 03:25:38,640
Samson waved him back saying he was 
riddled through and not worth rescuing.

3542
03:25:38,850 --> 03:25:43,200
He sent his apologies to the company for
making such noise and the quote.

3543
03:25:44,040 --> 03:25:46,680
In other words,
this guy is out there screaming and it's

3544
03:25:46,681 --> 03:25:51,681
so driving his own comrades crazy that 
they keep running out there to do 

3545
03:25:51,681 --> 03:25:54,780
something and everyone who runs out 
there to do something gets killed.

3546
03:25:55,350 --> 03:25:57,540
At what point,
if you're the wounded person,

3547
03:25:57,960 --> 03:26:02,960
do you try to just stop making noise so 
that they don't keep trying to help you 

3548
03:26:02,960 --> 03:26:06,981
out of sympathy when you probably are 
dying anyway and now you've lost three 

3549
03:26:06,981 --> 03:26:10,800
people or more simply trying to prevent 
the inevitable you're going through.

3550
03:26:11,070 --> 03:26:16,070
So at night when we're told the no man's
land area comes to life and you know,

3551
03:26:18,450 --> 03:26:20,430
we're appears deserted during the 
daytime.

3552
03:26:20,431 --> 03:26:22,260
At night,
the trench patrols go out.

3553
03:26:22,620 --> 03:26:25,530
The people who you know fix the barbed 
wire,

3554
03:26:25,710 --> 03:26:29,100
the intelligence folks,
the people conducting trench raids.

3555
03:26:29,101 --> 03:26:31,620
I mean supposedly there's a lot of 
activity in the dark.

3556
03:26:31,621 --> 03:26:36,621
Even though star shells light up the sky
all the time at dark graves in his unit 

3557
03:26:39,240 --> 03:26:42,900
moves out to go cleared any wounded in 
front of their trenches.

3558
03:26:42,901 --> 03:26:44,280
And he writes,
quote at dusk.

3559
03:26:44,281 --> 03:26:47,880
We all went out to get the wounded 
leaving only centuries in the line.

3560
03:26:48,120 --> 03:26:52,680
The first dead body I came upon was 
Samson's hit in 17 places.

3561
03:26:53,010 --> 03:26:58,010
I found that he had forced his knuckles 
into his mouth to stop himself crying 

3562
03:26:58,010 --> 03:26:59,040
out and attracting any more men to their
death.

3563
03:26:59,610 --> 03:27:04,610
And to quote,
so this poor man out there hit 17 times 

3564
03:27:05,400 --> 03:27:08,310
suffering,
horribly unable to keep from crying out,

3565
03:27:08,550 --> 03:27:13,550
can't stand the thought of attracting 
anymore and men to rescue him and dies 

3566
03:27:13,741 --> 03:27:16,920
with his hand in his mouth to keep from 
crying.

3567
03:27:16,920 --> 03:27:17,760
I mean it,
it,

3568
03:27:19,100 --> 03:27:20,900
it's,
it's the beauty that,

3569
03:27:20,940 --> 03:27:25,940
that,
that finds its way into the horrific 

3570
03:27:25,940 --> 03:27:26,580
ness of this war.
If you're that person's parent,

3571
03:27:26,581 --> 03:27:28,860
there's nothing to consoles you that 
doesn't make you feel any better,

3572
03:27:28,861 --> 03:27:31,380
but as a human being,
you look at that and say,

3573
03:27:31,650 --> 03:27:34,050
there's something about that man's 
sacrifice that's beautiful.

3574
03:27:35,130 --> 03:27:39,750
Now graves tells another story,
which not only shows the heroism and the

3575
03:27:39,751 --> 03:27:44,751
beauty of one of his compatriots,
but the same sort of an attitude on the 

3576
03:27:44,751 --> 03:27:47,110
part of the people.
The British thought were the bad guys.

3577
03:27:47,380 --> 03:27:48,340
The Germans,
as we said,

3578
03:27:48,430 --> 03:27:50,440
the Germans had been holding their fire 
quite a bit.

3579
03:27:51,020 --> 03:27:53,680
You know,
during this battle and you see it on the

3580
03:27:53,681 --> 03:27:55,120
French side.
And the British side too.

3581
03:27:55,121 --> 03:28:00,121
I mean this is not abnormal.
It's a little bit like that Christmas 

3582
03:28:00,121 --> 03:28:04,381
truce we talked about in the 1914,
a era of this war were spontaneously 

3583
03:28:04,900 --> 03:28:09,900
troops got up and sort of gave each 
other a little Christmas love in between

3584
03:28:10,031 --> 03:28:10,930
the shellings,
right.

3585
03:28:11,350 --> 03:28:14,200
You see this humanity appear even in 
this hell.

3586
03:28:14,470 --> 03:28:19,470
Graves talks about another soldier in no
man's land who wakes up in a seemingly 

3587
03:28:22,101 --> 03:28:24,530
dead and then all of a sudden is crying 
for help,

3588
03:28:25,190 --> 03:28:30,190
and when this happens,
every man in his trench feels like he's 

3589
03:28:30,190 --> 03:28:34,271
going through some sort of a moral 
tasked and one man passes it with flying

3590
03:28:34,551 --> 03:28:36,710
colors.
Graves writes quote,

3591
03:28:38,690 --> 03:28:42,770
on the morning of the 27th,
a cry arose from no man's land.

3592
03:28:43,040 --> 03:28:46,400
A wounded soldier of the middle sex unit
had recovered consciousness.

3593
03:28:46,401 --> 03:28:49,760
After two days,
he lay close to the German wire.

3594
03:28:50,030 --> 03:28:52,070
Our men heard it and looked at each 
other.

3595
03:28:52,460 --> 03:28:55,400
We had a tender hearted lance corporal 
named Baxter.

3596
03:28:55,700 --> 03:28:59,240
He was the man to boil up a special 
dixie for the centuries of his section.

3597
03:28:59,241 --> 03:29:01,700
When they came off duty,
made them a little soup or tea.

3598
03:29:02,150 --> 03:29:04,730
As soon as he heard the wounded 
Middlesex man,

3599
03:29:04,880 --> 03:29:08,570
he ran along the trench calling for a 
volunteer to help fetch him in.

3600
03:29:08,870 --> 03:29:10,700
Of course,
no one would go.

3601
03:29:10,940 --> 03:29:13,280
It was death to put one's head over the 
parapet.

3602
03:29:13,520 --> 03:29:18,520
When he came running to ask me,
I excused myself as being the only 

3603
03:29:18,520 --> 03:29:19,970
officer in the company.
I would come out with him at dusk.

3604
03:29:20,030 --> 03:29:21,560
I said,
not now.

3605
03:29:21,770 --> 03:29:22,880
So he went alone.

3606
03:29:23,330 --> 03:29:27,530
He jumped quickly over the parapet and 
then strolled across no man's land,

3607
03:29:27,531 --> 03:29:31,220
waving a handkerchief.
The Germans fire to frighten him,

3608
03:29:31,221 --> 03:29:33,290
but since he persisted,
they let him come.

3609
03:29:33,291 --> 03:29:36,470
Close.
Baxter continued toward them and when he

3610
03:29:36,471 --> 03:29:41,471
got to the Middlesex man stopped and 
pointed to show the Germans what he was 

3611
03:29:41,471 --> 03:29:42,980
at,
meaning what he was up to.

3612
03:29:43,550 --> 03:29:48,550
Then he dressed the man's wounds,
gave him a drink of rom and some 

3613
03:29:48,550 --> 03:29:50,840
biscuits that he had with him and 
promised to be back again at nightfall.

3614
03:29:51,050 --> 03:29:54,740
He did come back.
Graves writes with a stretcher party and

3615
03:29:54,741 --> 03:29:59,741
the man eventually recovered.
I recommended Baxter for the Victoria 

3616
03:29:59,741 --> 03:30:01,010
Cross being the only officer who had 
witnessed the action,

3617
03:30:01,190 --> 03:30:06,190
but the authorities thought it worth no 
more than a distinguished conduct medal 

3618
03:30:06,190 --> 03:30:06,190
and the quote

3619
03:30:07,250 --> 03:30:12,250
sounds worthy of a Victoria cross to me,
and that's one of those incidents where 

3620
03:30:12,250 --> 03:30:15,230
you see the opposite of man's 
inhumanity.

3621
03:30:15,231 --> 03:30:19,580
Demand in an environment designed to 
foster the former.

3622
03:30:20,570 --> 03:30:22,310
It stands out all the more,
doesn't it?

3623
03:30:23,380 --> 03:30:26,930
That baxter could have easily been mowed
down and if you don't think it happens.

3624
03:30:26,931 --> 03:30:31,931
Remember three people were mowed down 
trying to say that wounded Samson 

3625
03:30:31,931 --> 03:30:35,801
character in the first graves story,
I can't help but wonder how my 

3626
03:30:36,861 --> 03:30:40,100
generation would handle what these 
people forced to do.

3627
03:30:40,520 --> 03:30:42,590
You think of the first day on the battle
of the somme.

3628
03:30:42,860 --> 03:30:47,860
Think of yourself in the second wave or 
the third wave and you hear all this 

3629
03:30:48,951 --> 03:30:53,951
stuff from the officers about all the 
artillery will destroy everybody that 

3630
03:30:53,951 --> 03:30:57,421
nobody will be left alive,
and then the first wave in front of you 

3631
03:30:57,421 --> 03:31:00,401
units that you know go over the top and 
don't even get near their objective 

3632
03:31:00,401 --> 03:31:01,010
before they're cut to ribbons.

3633
03:31:01,040 --> 03:31:06,040
It's an absolute catastrophe and screw 
up and everybody can see it happening 

3634
03:31:06,440 --> 03:31:08,780
and then they turn into the next wave.
Maybe that's not you.

3635
03:31:08,781 --> 03:31:13,781
Maybe you're in the third and tell them 
to go do the same thing and they do in 

3636
03:31:13,781 --> 03:31:13,781
the same thing happens,
right?

3637
03:31:13,781 --> 03:31:17,390
It's suicide.
Now they turn to you and they say,

3638
03:31:17,391 --> 03:31:18,740
okay,
it's your unit turn.

3639
03:31:19,670 --> 03:31:24,670
What do you do?
Forget cowardice for a second because 

3640
03:31:24,670 --> 03:31:26,780
there are people who simply ran away or 
who's nerves failed them or whatever.

3641
03:31:27,200 --> 03:31:29,000
This is not a question of,
you know,

3642
03:31:29,420 --> 03:31:34,420
what could you do physically?
This is a question of what would you do?

3643
03:31:36,750 --> 03:31:41,750
See,
I think a lot of us would think to 

3644
03:31:41,750 --> 03:31:44,451
ourselves,
there's no way I'm surviving going out 

3645
03:31:44,451 --> 03:31:48,651
onto that battlefield,
but if this officer wasn't here telling 

3646
03:31:48,651 --> 03:31:51,330
me to do this and my buddies and I just 
sort of decided all together,

3647
03:31:51,331 --> 03:31:54,000
we're not doing this.
Maybe something would change.

3648
03:31:54,001 --> 03:31:59,001
You know,
one of the first war novels to come out 

3649
03:31:59,001 --> 03:32:01,491
of the first world war actually came out
during the first world war from a 

3650
03:32:01,491 --> 03:32:05,170
Frenchman named Henri barbless,
and he wrote something where he as a 

3651
03:32:05,191 --> 03:32:07,890
soldier had served already.
He was a disabled veteran.

3652
03:32:07,891 --> 03:32:12,891
He wrote this piece while the war was 
still going on and it's surprisingly 

3653
03:32:12,891 --> 03:32:16,920
antiwar for the government to have put 
up with it during the conflict and he 

3654
03:32:16,920 --> 03:32:21,201
implied that the soldiers on both sides,
the common soldiers should just agree 

3655
03:32:21,201 --> 03:32:23,460
with each other that they're not going 
to fight anymore.

3656
03:32:23,600 --> 03:32:25,440
You know what?
If they gave a war and no one came,

3657
03:32:25,441 --> 03:32:27,390
right?
What if the soldiers on both sides say,

3658
03:32:27,600 --> 03:32:28,950
well,
the government's can tell us to fight,

3659
03:32:28,951 --> 03:32:33,951
but we're not fighting anymore.
And Barbara said that in the book that 

3660
03:32:33,951 --> 03:32:37,050
the truthfully the only people who 
really understood what the French 

3661
03:32:37,050 --> 03:32:40,101
soldier and the British soldier we're 
going through in these hellish 

3662
03:32:40,101 --> 03:32:43,131
conditions where the German soldiers on 
the other side of the no man's land 

3663
03:32:43,131 --> 03:32:45,660
living under the exact same hellish 
conditions.

3664
03:32:47,480 --> 03:32:52,480
When the Germans don't fire on the 
British who are getting their wounded 

3665
03:32:52,480 --> 03:32:54,170
and a lot of times just because there's 
this unwritten deal that says,

3666
03:32:54,770 --> 03:32:59,770
I'm gonna,
leave you alone right now to get your 

3667
03:32:59,770 --> 03:33:02,021
wounded people out of there in the hopes
that when it's my wounded people in no 

3668
03:33:02,021 --> 03:33:03,110
man's land and I'm trying to get them 
out of there,

3669
03:33:03,500 --> 03:33:08,500
you'll let me.
One of the real phenomenons of this war

3670
03:33:10,160 --> 03:33:15,160
is the fact that when left alone,
a lot of soldiers on both sides decided 

3671
03:33:15,161 --> 03:33:20,161
to adopt what's what's officially known 
as a live and let live attitude in this 

3672
03:33:20,471 --> 03:33:22,120
war and it was.
It was common everywhere,

3673
03:33:22,121 --> 03:33:25,450
but the western front more than any 
other where for example,

3674
03:33:26,080 --> 03:33:31,080
soldiers would be required and they 
hated this job to go out at night and 

3675
03:33:31,361 --> 03:33:34,420
put more barbed wire up in the middle of
no man's land.

3676
03:33:34,421 --> 03:33:38,010
So you sneak out because it's dark and 
you bring wire with and wire cutters and

3677
03:33:38,011 --> 03:33:39,990
all these things and you have to go hang
new wire.

3678
03:33:40,080 --> 03:33:42,270
It's an extremely dangerous job in both 
sides.

3679
03:33:42,271 --> 03:33:43,200
Hated it.
Right?

3680
03:33:43,920 --> 03:33:45,900
So a lot of times they just wouldn't 
shoot.

3681
03:33:46,470 --> 03:33:48,320
At the other people who were putting 
wire up,

3682
03:33:48,330 --> 03:33:53,330
now the officers hated this and one of 
the big scandals was after the Christmas

3683
03:33:54,121 --> 03:33:59,121
truce,
the so called Christmas truce in 1914 

3684
03:33:59,121 --> 03:34:01,221
when both sides would have fraternized.
The officers had to make all these 

3685
03:34:01,221 --> 03:34:02,700
arrangements so that next Christmas,
nothing like this happened again,

3686
03:34:02,701 --> 03:34:06,510
and the men had preserved a proper 
fighting spirit would be the way most of

3687
03:34:06,511 --> 03:34:10,890
these militaries would phrase it,
but the troops often found a lot more to

3688
03:34:10,891 --> 03:34:13,020
like about each other than their own 
officers.

3689
03:34:14,810 --> 03:34:19,810
Corporal Louis Bartos in the French army
writes about this incident where a flood

3690
03:34:19,881 --> 03:34:24,881
occurs and all of a sudden the trenches 
on both sides of no man's land have to 

3691
03:34:24,881 --> 03:34:29,771
clear and how you have one of those 
moments where you just look at your 

3692
03:34:29,771 --> 03:34:32,921
enemy and he looks at you and you 
realize the socks and who put us into 

3693
03:34:33,291 --> 03:34:36,170
this mess and why are we doing this?
And he almost writes,

3694
03:34:36,171 --> 03:34:37,700
you know,
Martez is a socialist.

3695
03:34:37,701 --> 03:34:39,770
Like a lot of these troops in the 
trenches are.

3696
03:34:40,040 --> 03:34:43,940
So he has a worldview that kind of sees 
the upper classes,

3697
03:34:43,941 --> 03:34:48,320
the corporate groups and all that is the
problem and that the average soldiers in

3698
03:34:48,321 --> 03:34:53,321
the trenches,
we're all just kind of common workers 

3699
03:34:53,321 --> 03:34:55,691
being exploited by the man and he writes
about this famous a flood that he 

3700
03:34:56,061 --> 03:34:58,880
experiences and what it does and how it 
freaks out,

3701
03:34:59,120 --> 03:34:59,860
you know,
in his mind,

3702
03:34:59,890 --> 03:35:02,900
the upper classes in the officer corps 
that all of a sudden,

3703
03:35:03,140 --> 03:35:08,140
you know,
both sides in this combat are starting 

3704
03:35:08,140 --> 03:35:09,170
to have some sympathy for each other.
And he writes quote.

3705
03:35:11,080 --> 03:35:13,810
But one night when the rain came down in
torrance,

3706
03:35:14,020 --> 03:35:19,020
the tide invaded our dugout and cascaded
down both sets of steps at the height of

3707
03:35:19,691 --> 03:35:24,691
the storm.
Some of the men had to devote all their 

3708
03:35:24,691 --> 03:35:27,271
efforts to building a dam,
which the water then broke through in 

3709
03:35:27,271 --> 03:35:30,691
three or four places.
We spent the rest of the night battling 

3710
03:35:30,691 --> 03:35:30,820
the floodwaters.
The next day,

3711
03:35:30,970 --> 03:35:34,030
December 10th,
at many places along the front line,

3712
03:35:34,031 --> 03:35:35,860
the soldiers had to come out of their 
trenches.

3713
03:35:35,861 --> 03:35:39,070
So as not to drown.
The Germans had to do the same.

3714
03:35:39,340 --> 03:35:44,340
We therefore had the singular spectacle 
of the two enemy armies facing each 

3715
03:35:44,340 --> 03:35:48,580
other without firing a shot.
Our common sufferings brought our hearts

3716
03:35:48,581 --> 03:35:50,820
together,
melted the hatreds,

3717
03:35:51,490 --> 03:35:54,490
nurtured sympathy between strangers and 
adversaries.

3718
03:35:54,730 --> 03:35:57,340
Those who deny it are ignoring human 
psychology,

3719
03:35:57,610 --> 03:35:58,240
French,
German,

3720
03:35:58,241 --> 03:35:59,290
and Germans.
He writes,

3721
03:35:59,500 --> 03:36:02,380
looked at each other and saw that they 
were all men.

3722
03:36:02,560 --> 03:36:04,990
No different from one another.
They smiled,

3723
03:36:05,080 --> 03:36:08,560
exchanged comments,
hands reached out and grasped.

3724
03:36:08,710 --> 03:36:13,710
We shared tobacco,
a canteen of coffee or wine if only we 

3725
03:36:13,710 --> 03:36:18,181
spoke the same language.
One day he writes a huge devil of a 

3726
03:36:18,181 --> 03:36:20,350
German,
stood up on a mound and gave a speech,

3727
03:36:20,530 --> 03:36:22,960
which only the Germans could understand 
word for word,

3728
03:36:23,170 --> 03:36:27,400
but everyone knew what it meant because 
he smashed his rifle on a tree stump,

3729
03:36:27,640 --> 03:36:32,640
breaking it into in a gesture of anger.
Applause broke out on both sides and the

3730
03:36:32,861 --> 03:36:37,861
international was sung.
He says the national anthem of the 

3731
03:36:37,861 --> 03:36:39,040
socialist cause I guess you could say 
the workers,

3732
03:36:39,041 --> 03:36:41,200
cause he says,
quote,

3733
03:36:41,440 --> 03:36:42,910
well,
if only you'd been there.

3734
03:36:42,911 --> 03:36:46,780
Mad King's bloody generals,
fanatical ministers,

3735
03:36:46,870 --> 03:36:51,870
jingoistic journalists,
Rear Echelon Patriots to contemplate 

3736
03:36:51,870 --> 03:36:54,220
this sublime spectacle.
But it wasn't enough.

3737
03:36:54,250 --> 03:36:57,280
He says that the soldiers refused to 
fight one another.

3738
03:36:57,460 --> 03:37:02,460
What was needed was for them to turn 
back on the monsters who were pushing 

3739
03:37:02,460 --> 03:37:02,460
them,
one against the other,

3740
03:37:02,460 --> 03:37:06,070
and to cut them down like wild beasts 
for not having done so.

3741
03:37:06,220 --> 03:37:09,790
How much longer would the killing go on?
Meanwhile,

3742
03:37:09,820 --> 03:37:12,970
he says,
our big shot leaders were in a fearer.

3743
03:37:13,090 --> 03:37:16,600
What in the Lord's name would happen if 
the soldiers refused to kill each other?

3744
03:37:16,810 --> 03:37:21,400
Our artillery men received orders to 
fire on any assemblies of men which were

3745
03:37:21,401 --> 03:37:24,220
pointed out to them and to mow down 
indiscriminately,

3746
03:37:24,221 --> 03:37:25,030
both French,
German,

3747
03:37:25,031 --> 03:37:27,910
and Germans.
Just like when an ancient circuses,

3748
03:37:28,090 --> 03:37:33,090
they slaughtered wild beast too.
We're too intelligent to tear each 

3749
03:37:33,090 --> 03:37:33,550
other's throats out and devour each 
other.

3750
03:37:34,090 --> 03:37:39,090
Furthermore,
he says once the front line was 

3751
03:37:39,090 --> 03:37:39,090
established,
again,

3752
03:37:39,090 --> 03:37:42,421
for better or worse,
it was forbidden under penalty of death 

3753
03:37:42,421 --> 03:37:45,631
to leave the trench.
Any active familiarity with the Germans 

3754
03:37:45,631 --> 03:37:45,790
had to cease.
It was over.

3755
03:37:46,060 --> 03:37:48,730
What was really needed was a second 
biblical flood,

3756
03:37:48,970 --> 03:37:53,970
a universal deleuze to stop the war,
to appease all the anger and the bloody 

3757
03:37:53,970 --> 03:37:55,840
madness of our leaders.
Who knows?

3758
03:37:55,841 --> 03:37:58,770
He says,
maybe one day in this corner of law,

3759
03:37:58,930 --> 03:38:03,930
they will raise a monument to 
commemorate this spirit of fraternity 

3760
03:38:03,930 --> 03:38:08,040
among men who shared a horror of war and
who were forced to kill each other 

3761
03:38:08,040 --> 03:38:12,211
against their wills and quote,
there are multiple accounts from 

3762
03:38:14,270 --> 03:38:16,850
socialists,
soldiers that sound like that,

3763
03:38:17,660 --> 03:38:22,660
but it's more complex than that,
and Philip Gibbs tries to make this 

3764
03:38:22,660 --> 03:38:25,190
statement and now it can be told where 
he talks about this horrible life.

3765
03:38:25,191 --> 03:38:27,140
These poor soldiers are forced to 
endure,

3766
03:38:27,680 --> 03:38:32,680
but then about the complexity involved 
in trying to make some statement that 

3767
03:38:32,680 --> 03:38:34,520
the soldiers are all of one mind or 
viewpoint about anything

3768
03:38:36,000 --> 03:38:36,840
we told you.
Ernst,

3769
03:38:36,841 --> 03:38:41,841
Young,
or the German goes through all this 

3770
03:38:41,841 --> 03:38:42,210
terrible stuff and kind of finds it 
uplifting.

3771
03:38:43,230 --> 03:38:48,230
Gibbs writes these horror stories and 
then says this about the psalm and the 

3772
03:38:48,230 --> 03:38:48,570
soldiers,
their quote,

3773
03:38:50,300 --> 03:38:52,670
but however deep the knowledge of 
tragedy,

3774
03:38:52,820 --> 03:38:56,540
a man would be a liar if he refused to 
admit the heroism,

3775
03:38:56,750 --> 03:39:00,830
the gallantry of youth,
even the gaiety of men in these infernal

3776
03:39:00,830 --> 03:39:05,830
months.
Psychology on the somme was not simple 

3777
03:39:05,830 --> 03:39:05,870
and straightforward.
Men were afraid,

3778
03:39:06,140 --> 03:39:09,620
but fear was not there dominating 
emotion except in the worst hours.

3779
03:39:09,890 --> 03:39:12,950
Men hated this fighting,
but found excitement in it,

3780
03:39:13,160 --> 03:39:18,160
often exultation,
sometimes an intense stimulus of all 

3781
03:39:18,160 --> 03:39:20,420
their senses and passions before 
reaction and exhaustion.

3782
03:39:20,720 --> 03:39:24,680
Men became gibbering idiots with shell 
shock as I saw some of them,

3783
03:39:24,950 --> 03:39:29,950
but others rejoiced when they saw our 
shells plowing into the enemy's 

3784
03:39:29,950 --> 03:39:33,941
earthworks,
laughed at their own narrow escapes and 

3785
03:39:33,941 --> 03:39:35,570
at grotesque comma,
calories of this monster is devil tree.

3786
03:39:35,930 --> 03:39:38,150
The officers he writes were proud of 
their men,

3787
03:39:38,330 --> 03:39:43,330
eager for their honor and achievement.
The men themselves were in rivalries 

3788
03:39:43,330 --> 03:39:45,770
with other bodies of troops and proud of
their own prowess.

3789
03:39:46,100 --> 03:39:48,980
They were scoring full of all that the 
enemy might do to them.

3790
03:39:49,200 --> 03:39:51,380
You get acknowledged his courage and 
power.

3791
03:39:51,530 --> 03:39:56,530
They were quick to kill him and yet also
quick to give him a chance of life by 

3792
03:39:56,530 --> 03:39:58,850
surrender and after that we're nine 
times out of 10,

3793
03:39:59,030 --> 03:40:02,060
chivalrous and kindly,
but incredibly brutal.

3794
03:40:02,061 --> 03:40:06,050
On the rare occasions when passion 
overcame them at some tail of treachery,

3795
03:40:07,200 --> 03:40:12,200
they had the pride of a skilled laborer.
He writes in his own craft as machine 

3796
03:40:12,211 --> 03:40:14,580
gunners bombers,
raider trench,

3797
03:40:14,581 --> 03:40:18,060
motor men,
and we're all keen to show their skill,

3798
03:40:18,061 --> 03:40:23,061
whatever the risks,
they were healthy animals with animal 

3799
03:40:23,061 --> 03:40:25,230
courage as well as animal fear,
and they had some of them,

3800
03:40:25,440 --> 03:40:28,680
a spiritual and moral fervor which made 
them risk.

3801
03:40:28,681 --> 03:40:33,420
Death to save a comrade or to save a 
position would have killed the fear that

3802
03:40:33,421 --> 03:40:37,050
tried to fetter them or lead men with 
greater fear than theirs.

3803
03:40:37,410 --> 03:40:42,410
They live from hour to hour and forgot 
the parallel or the misery that had 

3804
03:40:42,410 --> 03:40:45,060
passed and did not forestall the future 
by apprehension,

3805
03:40:45,210 --> 03:40:50,210
unless they were a sensitive mind with 
the worst quality men might have in 

3806
03:40:50,210 --> 03:40:50,250
modern warfare,

3807
03:40:50,680 --> 03:40:55,680
imagination and to quote well,
imagination.

3808
03:40:56,831 --> 03:41:00,400
I can see being a downside if you are in
the trenches under fire,

3809
03:41:01,600 --> 03:41:06,600
you know,
looking at your watch as some of these 

3810
03:41:06,600 --> 03:41:07,450
troops in the trenches did.
Saying I have 15 minutes left to live.

3811
03:41:07,600 --> 03:41:12,600
Now I have 10 minutes left to live.
Now I have five minutes left to live as 

3812
03:41:12,600 --> 03:41:13,360
the countdown to going over the top 
happened.

3813
03:41:13,960 --> 03:41:18,960
Yes,
I can see how that would drive you 

3814
03:41:18,960 --> 03:41:18,960
crazy.
On the other hand,

3815
03:41:18,960 --> 03:41:23,280
we're getting to the part of the war 
were the really imaginative minds can 

3816
03:41:23,591 --> 03:41:28,591
begin to start to have an impact on 
these brand new 20th century problems.

3817
03:41:29,780 --> 03:41:33,220
It only became apparent about two years 
ago when this war started.

3818
03:41:33,520 --> 03:41:37,510
Some of the solutions to the problems.
The first world war you know,

3819
03:41:37,511 --> 03:41:42,430
brings into play debut during the battle
of the Somme and they look once again,

3820
03:41:42,431 --> 03:41:45,220
this is going to make me be a sub theme 
of the show unintentionally.

3821
03:41:45,670 --> 03:41:47,950
They looked like something out of 
science fiction in this case,

3822
03:41:48,280 --> 03:41:53,280
hg wells or if you want to believe some 
people go all the way back to Leonardo 

3823
03:41:53,280 --> 03:41:58,200
Davinci.
People who first come up with the 

3824
03:41:58,200 --> 03:42:00,640
concept of if you will,
a land ship,

3825
03:42:01,630 --> 03:42:05,170
Churchill and the navy called them land 
battle ships.

3826
03:42:05,200 --> 03:42:10,200
Sometimes we know them by the term tank 
on tank is supposedly simply something 

3827
03:42:12,701 --> 03:42:17,701
that caught on.
It was supposed to be a cover word so 

3828
03:42:17,701 --> 03:42:21,241
that no one knew what was being worked 
on in secret in the laboratories of the 

3829
03:42:21,241 --> 03:42:26,221
allies.
They would suggest that this giant 

3830
03:42:26,221 --> 03:42:30,030
armored tractor was intended to bring up
supply.

3831
03:42:30,031 --> 03:42:31,800
You know,
like water to the front line,

3832
03:42:31,801 --> 03:42:34,170
troops under fire,
so a tank if you will,

3833
03:42:34,171 --> 03:42:39,171
a water tank on a battle,
one of these little battles that make up

3834
03:42:40,831 --> 03:42:45,831
all these giant battles,
a part of the battle of the Somme on 

3835
03:42:45,831 --> 03:42:48,501
September 15th and offensive to take a 
particular part of the battlefield is 

3836
03:42:48,501 --> 03:42:51,830
launched and debuting are a bunch of 
these tanks,

3837
03:42:51,840 --> 03:42:53,280
you know,
30 or 40,

3838
03:42:53,281 --> 03:42:55,710
something like that.
A bunch of them broke down on the way.

3839
03:42:58,350 --> 03:43:02,730
You can instantly see that this is the 
solution to the problem,

3840
03:43:02,731 --> 03:43:04,560
right?
If you go to your engineers when the war

3841
03:43:04,561 --> 03:43:05,640
starts and say,
listen,

3842
03:43:05,641 --> 03:43:10,641
we've got this barbed wire machine gun 
artillery situation with no man's land 

3843
03:43:10,641 --> 03:43:12,380
and these big trenches,
you got to get past a.

3844
03:43:12,480 --> 03:43:15,120
put your mind to it.
Come back with a design they did.

3845
03:43:15,121 --> 03:43:20,121
They've got a giant tractor and it's so 
long that it can span most of these 

3846
03:43:20,970 --> 03:43:24,420
trenches so it can go in and not get 
trapped.

3847
03:43:24,421 --> 03:43:28,440
Most of the time it only goes about the 
speed of a walking human being,

3848
03:43:28,441 --> 03:43:30,530
but the point isn't to,
you know,

3849
03:43:30,610 --> 03:43:35,610
drive around real fast everywhere.
The point is to not get killed while 

3850
03:43:35,610 --> 03:43:39,060
you're crossing no man's land and not 
get held up by barbed wire.

3851
03:43:39,061 --> 03:43:42,900
These things are designed to simply run 
over barbed wire machine.

3852
03:43:42,901 --> 03:43:47,360
Gun Bullets won't hurt them,
shrapnel won't hurt them and they'll get

3853
03:43:47,361 --> 03:43:50,420
to the other side and they'll wipe out 
strong points and when they debut,

3854
03:43:50,421 --> 03:43:52,970
nobody has any idea what that's going to
be like.

3855
03:43:53,900 --> 03:43:58,900
It's another one of those moments where 
you kind of bite your nails and you 

3856
03:43:58,900 --> 03:44:01,601
watched the new technology in this case,
not stuff developed in the last hundred 

3857
03:44:02,060 --> 03:44:03,620
years that never had a chance to be 
tested.

3858
03:44:03,621 --> 03:44:06,620
In this case,
stuff developed specifically in response

3859
03:44:06,621 --> 03:44:09,050
to problems.
The first world war you know,

3860
03:44:09,051 --> 03:44:14,051
brings up like no man's land and they 
perform astoundingly well.

3861
03:44:17,740 --> 03:44:22,740
Now they break down a lot and they're 
terribly uncomfortable for the people 

3862
03:44:22,991 --> 03:44:24,250
inside.
These are large too.

3863
03:44:24,251 --> 03:44:29,251
There's like 15 people in these things.
I mean they're like almost a boss and 

3864
03:44:29,251 --> 03:44:31,950
they don't have a turret.
They have either a machine gunner coming

3865
03:44:31,980 --> 03:44:34,000
under the side or a couple of six 
pounder guns,

3866
03:44:34,001 --> 03:44:39,001
which are about 57 millimeter,
and yet the Germans don't know what 

3867
03:44:39,001 --> 03:44:42,991
they're dealing with here,
and we'd have stories of them 

3868
03:44:42,991 --> 03:44:42,991
surrendering the tanks and,
uh,

3869
03:44:42,991 --> 03:44:46,740
the reaction on the part of the British 
troops is either really excited and 

3870
03:44:46,740 --> 03:44:49,090
happy or they almost laughing because it
looks kind of comical,

3871
03:44:50,030 --> 03:44:52,930
but in a sense,
this is what we talked about earlier.

3872
03:44:52,931 --> 03:44:57,931
This is the star wars team punk imperial
Walker thing for real

3873
03:45:00,710 --> 03:45:05,710
now,
Churchill and the people who had backed 

3874
03:45:05,710 --> 03:45:05,820
this idea from the time trench warfare 
got started.

3875
03:45:05,821 --> 03:45:10,821
That's when the first plans were drawn 
up in the ideas brainstormed for 

3876
03:45:10,821 --> 03:45:11,700
something like this in the French were 
working on a two by the way.

3877
03:45:12,960 --> 03:45:17,960
Churchill was mad and forever afterwards
yelled and screamed that this concept 

3878
03:45:17,960 --> 03:45:22,641
could have really done a ton if they had
just waited till there were enough of 

3879
03:45:22,641 --> 03:45:23,340
these land battleships,
um,

3880
03:45:23,370 --> 03:45:25,440
to unleash and have,
have it make a difference.

3881
03:45:25,980 --> 03:45:28,200
The counterargument,
which we also understand,

3882
03:45:28,201 --> 03:45:30,250
right?
Is that what if they don't work?

3883
03:45:30,251 --> 03:45:35,251
What if we don't know how they work,
how do we do this if we don't have a 

3884
03:45:35,251 --> 03:45:38,340
dress rehearsal before opening night,
so churchill and the people on his side 

3885
03:45:38,340 --> 03:45:38,340
are saying,
no,

3886
03:45:38,340 --> 03:45:43,081
you wasted it.
It should've been one big opening night 

3887
03:45:43,081 --> 03:45:44,350
that broke the western front and the 
other side saying,

3888
03:45:44,351 --> 03:45:45,130
are you kidding me?

3889
03:45:45,130 --> 03:45:47,380
There is an open invitation and Murphy's
law,

3890
03:45:48,370 --> 03:45:53,370
but if you were looking to try to decide
how you liked your land battleship 

3891
03:45:53,370 --> 03:45:56,770
concept in practice after it was debuted
at the battle of the somme,

3892
03:45:56,771 --> 03:45:57,910
well,
all you have to know,

3893
03:45:57,911 --> 03:46:02,911
his cavalry commander Douglas Haig,
radioed back to corporate headquarters 

3894
03:46:03,330 --> 03:46:08,330
into the British army and said,
we want more of those tanks now.

3895
03:46:09,460 --> 03:46:12,160
Other things happened because of the 
battle of the somme.

3896
03:46:12,161 --> 03:46:17,161
Two and one was it was just it for poor 
Eric von Falcon Hein,

3897
03:46:17,260 --> 03:46:22,260
the head of the German military.
Remember he's a guy who took over after 

3898
03:46:22,260 --> 03:46:25,291
they sacked von Moltke,
the guy who they started the war with 

3899
03:46:25,291 --> 03:46:28,110
and now like a bunch of leaders who own 
a football team and continually like to 

3900
03:46:29,291 --> 03:46:32,830
change coaches.
Falcon Heinz going to lose his gig.

3901
03:46:34,240 --> 03:46:39,240
He's got verdun on his scorecard,
now he's got the song and then there's 

3902
03:46:39,240 --> 03:46:43,621
this bruce law of offensive and then the
last straw is everybody's whispering 

3903
03:46:43,621 --> 03:46:47,581
that Romania is going to get in the war,
which doesn't sound like a big deal to 

3904
03:46:47,581 --> 03:46:51,211
us now,
but if you actually look at the 

3905
03:46:51,211 --> 03:46:51,211
literature,
especially German Austro-hungarian,

3906
03:46:51,211 --> 03:46:52,120
the stuff from that side of Europe,
oh,

3907
03:46:52,121 --> 03:46:53,810
they're really like biting their nails 
about this.

3908
03:46:54,280 --> 03:46:56,630
Romania could get in the war.
Half million bayonets.

3909
03:46:56,650 --> 03:46:58,600
Oh my goodness.
And everybody's really worried.

3910
03:46:58,601 --> 03:47:03,601
And apparently Kaiser Wilhelm,
the German emperor is really worried in 

3911
03:47:03,601 --> 03:47:03,601
fucking hindsight now.
Don't worry about it.

3912
03:47:03,601 --> 03:47:04,510
They're not going to come in anytime 
soon.

3913
03:47:04,511 --> 03:47:05,310
Maybe later,
but no,

3914
03:47:05,330 --> 03:47:06,550
but no time soon.
And then boom,

3915
03:47:06,551 --> 03:47:10,320
almost right after he issues the,
they won't be coming in.

3916
03:47:10,340 --> 03:47:14,200
They come in August 27th.
Uh,

3917
03:47:14,201 --> 03:47:15,720
and that's it.
Fall behind.

3918
03:47:15,760 --> 03:47:16,510
Get sacked.

3919
03:47:18,610 --> 03:47:19,990
The last card,
by the way,

3920
03:47:19,991 --> 03:47:24,991
I love how he knows his emperor William 
and William's little quirks about power 

3921
03:47:24,991 --> 03:47:26,860
and Falcon Heinz last car that he plays 
is,

3922
03:47:27,160 --> 03:47:32,160
you know,
if you replace me with the people 

3923
03:47:32,160 --> 03:47:32,160
everyone knew they were going to replace
it with.

3924
03:47:32,160 --> 03:47:33,490
If you replaced me with Hindenburg and 
Ludendorff,

3925
03:47:33,491 --> 03:47:34,440
that's it.
They're not gonna.

3926
03:47:34,460 --> 03:47:39,460
Listen to you.
I'm the last chance you have of having 

3927
03:47:39,460 --> 03:47:39,460
an influence.
My words,

3928
03:47:39,460 --> 03:47:40,720
but that's basically what he said to the
Kaiser.

3929
03:47:40,721 --> 03:47:42,130
You wouldn't have any role in this at 
all.

3930
03:47:42,250 --> 03:47:45,550
You better stick with me because if you 
put Hindenburg and Ludendorff in charge,

3931
03:47:45,790 --> 03:47:47,980
they're going to tell you to go play 
with your toys in the corner.

3932
03:47:49,240 --> 03:47:51,490
Apparently the kaiser felt like he had 
no choice.

3933
03:47:51,880 --> 03:47:54,070
Sacks,
Fond Falcon Hein,

3934
03:47:54,250 --> 03:47:57,820
who asks for a military command is 
given.

3935
03:47:57,850 --> 03:48:02,740
Some people think almost as an insult,
the command to go attack Romania,

3936
03:48:03,130 --> 03:48:05,350
which he didn't first see them coming 
into the war.

3937
03:48:05,590 --> 03:48:10,590
He takes over a military command and 
conducts a brilliant campaign against 

3938
03:48:10,871 --> 03:48:13,750
Romania.
Conquering them quickly,

3939
03:48:14,740 --> 03:48:15,880
which makes you turn around and go,
now,

3940
03:48:15,890 --> 03:48:18,220
why were we so scared of those Romanian 
bayonets?

3941
03:48:18,520 --> 03:48:20,050
It's not the Romanians fault,
by the way,

3942
03:48:20,051 --> 03:48:20,680
folks.
I mean,

3943
03:48:20,710 --> 03:48:25,420
think about how that's like a minor 
league team jumping into the middle of a

3944
03:48:25,421 --> 03:48:29,390
game against the perhaps army in the 
20th century.

3945
03:48:29,391 --> 03:48:32,780
So finally Romania.
So unequipped for this without a ramp up

3946
03:48:32,781 --> 03:48:37,781
period.
And they just got smashed and the worst 

3947
03:48:37,781 --> 03:48:37,781
part about the whole thing from the 
allied standpoint,

3948
03:48:37,781 --> 03:48:39,770
again,
the allies worked so hard to get Romania

3949
03:48:39,771 --> 03:48:42,200
in.
The conflict is that one's Germany takes

3950
03:48:42,201 --> 03:48:44,810
over Romania,
they're gonna lose that country of every

3951
03:48:44,811 --> 03:48:49,811
bit of wheat and oil and anything they 
can take to offset the damage that the 

3952
03:48:49,971 --> 03:48:54,971
British blockade is doing.
So in a sense it's like they come upon 

3953
03:48:54,971 --> 03:48:58,181
this Romanian store room and they loot 
the whole thing so it sort of backfires 

3954
03:48:58,400 --> 03:49:01,940
on the allied cause.
Nonetheless,

3955
03:49:02,390 --> 03:49:05,270
Hindenburg and Ludendorff,
this new command team,

3956
03:49:05,271 --> 03:49:10,271
the people who had been in charge on the
eastern front for so long and sort of 

3957
03:49:10,271 --> 03:49:14,230
being the armchair quarterbacks from 
over there telling the rest of the 

3958
03:49:14,230 --> 03:49:17,771
German command what they were doing 
wrong on the western front are now in 

3959
03:49:17,771 --> 03:49:20,381
charge of among other things the western
front and they're going to bring a new 

3960
03:49:20,511 --> 03:49:25,511
perspective and a different way of 
looking at things and they will 

3961
03:49:26,510 --> 03:49:30,080
essentially command this German army for
the rest of the war.

3962
03:49:32,190 --> 03:49:34,350
Now,
how long the rest of the war is going to

3963
03:49:34,351 --> 03:49:39,351
be able to go is an open question.
As 1916 begins to wind up,

3964
03:49:39,691 --> 03:49:44,691
you begin to see the discontent ramping 
up everywhere and on many different 

3965
03:49:44,691 --> 03:49:45,930
fronts.
When you begin to see,

3966
03:49:45,931 --> 03:49:47,610
for example,
hunger really bite,

3967
03:49:47,640 --> 03:49:51,090
there'll be a winter,
the famous winter of 1916 in Germany.

3968
03:49:51,091 --> 03:49:54,120
That's called the turnip winter,
which tells you right there what's going

3969
03:49:54,121 --> 03:49:57,270
on and all the.
All the exports from Romania you can get

3970
03:49:57,271 --> 03:49:58,670
aren't going to,
you know,

3971
03:49:58,800 --> 03:50:02,490
make up for the overseas important needs
of Germany.

3972
03:50:04,100 --> 03:50:07,100
The Russians are in terrible trouble.
Remember,

3973
03:50:07,101 --> 03:50:12,101
this is a regime that almost got 
overthrown 10 years before this time 

3974
03:50:12,101 --> 03:50:14,870
period.
They didn't have exactly the greatest,

3975
03:50:14,930 --> 03:50:19,220
most solid foundation anyway.
These million casualties,

3976
03:50:19,221 --> 03:50:21,470
they suffer in 1916 at the Bristol off 
offensive.

3977
03:50:21,500 --> 03:50:26,500
Among other things are taking its toll.
French soldiers are beginning to bleed 

3978
03:50:28,490 --> 03:50:31,220
like sheep.
When they pass by their officers,

3979
03:50:31,221 --> 03:50:35,420
these replacements will come up marching
by and they'll just hear bleeding.

3980
03:50:35,421 --> 03:50:40,421
Sounds like sheep and lamb being led to 
the slaughter as sort of as one author 

3981
03:50:40,421 --> 03:50:44,891
puts it.
I'm way that the troops can silently 

3982
03:50:44,891 --> 03:50:49,691
protest what they feel is being done to 
them and on the home front you can,

3983
03:50:50,230 --> 03:50:55,230
you know the tragedy is beginning to 
really seep in as more and more people 

3984
03:50:55,230 --> 03:50:57,380
are personally affected for life by this
conflict,

3985
03:50:57,381 --> 03:51:01,940
and obviously while this isn't the 
textbook example,

3986
03:51:01,941 --> 03:51:06,941
I don't think most people find 
themselves in in the same situation as 

3987
03:51:06,941 --> 03:51:09,440
this German couple,
but there's a story from the time period

3988
03:51:09,441 --> 03:51:14,441
from a British observer in Germany 
during the war who was describing a 

3989
03:51:15,051 --> 03:51:20,051
train trip where she saw a couple man 
and a woman on the train and the stories

3990
03:51:20,451 --> 03:51:24,020
absolutely heartbreaking,
but in so many ways shows where we are.

3991
03:51:24,560 --> 03:51:29,560
By the end of 1916 in this conflict,
the observer says,

3992
03:51:30,480 --> 03:51:35,480
quote,
how poor woman the other day on the 

3993
03:51:35,480 --> 03:51:36,240
train was holding up her hand and 
counting the fingers on it.

3994
03:51:36,241 --> 03:51:37,590
Slowly,
one,

3995
03:51:37,920 --> 03:51:39,420
two,
three,

3996
03:51:39,780 --> 03:51:41,490
four,
five.

3997
03:51:41,850 --> 03:51:46,850
Over and over again,
the passengers gradually began to smile 

3998
03:51:46,850 --> 03:51:48,480
at her until at last,
the man sitting next to her said,

3999
03:51:48,481 --> 03:51:51,150
simply don't laugh at my wife,
Ladies and gentlemen,

4000
03:51:51,420 --> 03:51:54,360
I'm taking her to the asylum.
Her wits are gone.

4001
03:51:54,750 --> 03:51:59,750
She's lost her five sons all killed in 
action and quote,

4002
03:52:02,180 --> 03:52:05,990
when you really examine what's already 
happened since August 19,

4003
03:52:05,991 --> 03:52:10,991
14,
you come away with the feeling that if 

4004
03:52:10,991 --> 03:52:15,200
you had bet on a short war like so many 
did,

4005
03:52:15,830 --> 03:52:19,280
you are amazed at the staying power of 
all these states,

4006
03:52:19,310 --> 03:52:24,310
many of whom didn't look that 
particularly stable when the war broke 

4007
03:52:24,310 --> 03:52:24,680
out.
Nonetheless,

4008
03:52:24,681 --> 03:52:26,480
as we've been saying throughout this 
whole program,

4009
03:52:26,810 --> 03:52:31,810
there's a limit to the endurance of 
anyone and we're about to enter the 

4010
03:52:31,810 --> 03:52:36,791
point when nations crack and break and 
in the not too distant future get 

4011
03:52:38,721 --> 03:52:39,410
knocked out.

4012
03:52:46,950 --> 03:52:49,170
If you think the show you just heard is 
worth a dollar,

4013
03:52:49,290 --> 03:52:52,230
Dan and Ben would love to have it.
A buck a show.

4014
03:52:52,320 --> 03:52:55,350
It's all we ask.
Go to Dan Carlin.com

4015
03:52:55,351 --> 03:52:57,840
for information on how to donate to the 
show.

4016
03:52:58,420 --> 03:53:03,420
One of the justifiable criticisms you 
can level at the show we just did was 

4017
03:53:03,521 --> 03:53:06,400
that it focuses in ordinarily on the 
western front.

4018
03:53:08,690 --> 03:53:13,690
I did that on purpose because to me,
when you're talking about the extremes 

4019
03:53:13,690 --> 03:53:18,011
of human experience,
the first thing that comes to my mind 

4020
03:53:18,011 --> 03:53:19,991
when I think of the first world war is 
the situation on the western front and 

4021
03:53:19,991 --> 03:53:21,620
the trench war and all that,
and in that sense I'm not that different

4022
03:53:21,621 --> 03:53:26,621
than most British,
French and German historians who have 

4023
03:53:26,621 --> 03:53:26,621
focused inordinately on the western 
front,

4024
03:53:26,621 --> 03:53:31,600
but I think we all know that there's a 
lot of other things going on in this 

4025
03:53:31,600 --> 03:53:34,931
conflict in a bunch of other theaters 
and in the same way I was able to avoid 

4026
03:53:36,590 --> 03:53:38,890
talking about those other theaters for 
awhile.

4027
03:53:38,900 --> 03:53:40,190
My goodness,
the jumping around.

4028
03:53:40,191 --> 03:53:45,191
We would do if,
if we try to get everything in there 

4029
03:53:45,191 --> 03:53:45,410
would be more confusing than what we're 
already giving you,

4030
03:53:45,411 --> 03:53:47,690
which is more confusing than I like 
already.

4031
03:53:48,200 --> 03:53:53,200
Nonetheless,
you could ignore her just like most 

4032
03:53:53,200 --> 03:53:53,200
people in Britain,
France or heck,

4033
03:53:53,200 --> 03:53:54,560
even in New York City.
In the United States,

4034
03:53:54,561 --> 03:53:57,710
when you open up a newspaper and in the 
far corner of like page eight,

4035
03:53:57,890 --> 03:54:02,890
there's a little blurb about maybe some 
obscure Arab tribe uprising in some.

4036
03:54:04,040 --> 03:54:09,040
Out of the way,
autumn in district or something doesn't 

4037
03:54:09,040 --> 03:54:10,430
mean that much to you.
You're not thinking that much about it.

4038
03:54:10,431 --> 03:54:12,890
After all,
the western front is grinding up a whole

4039
03:54:12,891 --> 03:54:17,891
generation of Europeans and then in 1917
events in faraway peripheral places is 

4040
03:54:20,541 --> 03:54:25,541
the way a lot of people in the West 
might see them rise up and demand to be 

4041
03:54:25,541 --> 03:54:26,230
taken seriously,

4042
03:54:28,590 --> 03:54:33,590
whether it's the Middle East in 1917 and
events that we are still shaking out to 

4043
03:54:34,381 --> 03:54:37,050
this day that are in your headlines 
daily,

4044
03:54:37,740 --> 03:54:42,740
whether it's the collapse of an ancient 
European regime which opens the door to 

4045
03:54:46,050 --> 03:54:51,050
the 20th century's most radical regime 
taking over in a major country.

4046
03:54:54,340 --> 03:54:59,340
So also in 1917 that the vortex of the 
first world war manages to suck in an 

4047
03:55:00,811 --> 03:55:05,811
outside major power.
That for almost a 150 years has managed 

4048
03:55:06,941 --> 03:55:10,720
to stay out of direct involvement in 
European affairs.

4049
03:55:10,721 --> 03:55:13,780
As one of their early presidents had 
said,

4050
03:55:14,350 --> 03:55:19,350
the United States of America doesn't go 
abroad in search of foreign monsters to 

4051
03:55:19,350 --> 03:55:24,241
slay.
And in 1917 they decide we'll maybe just

4052
03:55:24,311 --> 03:55:26,260
this once,
you know,

4053
03:55:26,680 --> 03:55:31,680
to make the world safe for democracy.
Yes,

4054
03:55:31,751 --> 03:55:36,751
indeed.
Many of our modern situations had the 

4055
03:55:36,971 --> 03:55:41,971
seeds for them planted in 1917.
And we'll get to all that and more in 

4056
03:55:46,001 --> 03:55:48,820
part five of blueprint for Armageddon.
